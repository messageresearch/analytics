[13:56] Amen.
[13:58] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[14:01] Oh my. And we've had a wonderful
[14:03] weekend, a wonderful time in the Lord.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; From Friday night, Brother George Smith
[14:09] spoke on keeping a balance and staying
[14:12] with the word. He didn't bring anything
[14:14] new. It was solid. It was sane. It was
[14:18] something you could hold on to. And then
[14:21] Friday uh Saturday morning, brother
[14:23] Trevor Eman spoke on a tremendous
[14:27] message on grace in Romans 7, Romans
[14:29] chapter 8 and bringing the truth of who
[14:33] we are in Christ. Saturday night,
[14:36] brother Ferguson brought that God can't
[14:38] change. His word doesn't change. No
[14:41] matter where you find it, it's the same
[14:43] God. Amen.
[14:45] And then this morning we heard a
[14:47] powerful message on the prophecy that we
[14:50] are that prophecy made manifested. Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [applause]
[14:57] Amen.
[15:00] And so we had to deny some of the song
[15:03] specials during the meetings and we
[15:05] culminated it to this [music] last
[15:07] evening service here for this. But
[15:09] before we do, we have the word of the
[15:11] Lord that we want to hear just one more
[15:13] time
[15:14] &gt;&gt; around our faithful brother, uh, Pastor
[15:16] Malcolm Webster. He's from Montreal,
[15:20] Canada. That's where he [music] pastors
[15:22] the church there. He's worked many years
[15:24] with brother Ferguson. He's been a
[15:26] tremendous example to me when I lived up
[15:29] there for two years and beyond. He has
[15:32] just been a real witness and a
[15:34] testimony. His wife is with us, I
[15:37] believe. Sister Elma, if she would raise
[15:39] her hand. There she is right there. We
[15:42] thank the Lord for her. Let's make her
[15:45] feel welcome. Amen. [applause]
[15:47] Praise the Lord.
[15:51] And so, uh, we kind of reversed the
[15:54] service here just so we're going to go
[15:56] to the word first and then we'll go
[15:59] worship afterwards.
[16:01] And so as we prepare to do that, let's
[16:03] sing Amazing Grace as our [music]
[16:06] brother comes. Amen. Amazing [singing]
[16:12] grace,
[16:14] [music and singing]
[16:15] sweet
[16:18] sound
[16:20] that say [singing]
[16:26] like me.
[16:28] like me.
[16:31] I was [music]
[16:34] lost,
[16:36] but now
[16:39] I'm found.
[16:42] Was blind,
[16:44] but [singing]
[16:46] now
[16:48] I see.
[16:52] Amen.
[16:59] Lord Jesus Christ.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; It's good to be in
[17:08] house of the Lord another time.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little lonely up here. But
[17:14] Frank, where are you? Because usually we
[17:17] preach with my translator.
[17:20] So, if you catch, if I if you see me
[17:23] hesitating,
[17:24] it's because I'm waiting for him to
[17:27] translate.
[17:29] But after a while, I'll get used to it.
[17:32] It's good to be with you. The last time
[17:34] we were here was two years ago, and we
[17:38] had a wonderful time.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; And we enjoyed the hospitalities of the
[17:42] believers,
[17:44] and we thank God it had a great
[17:45] impression upon us.
[17:49] and coming again.
[17:52] I wouldn't mind I've come to listen to
[17:55] brother
[17:57] Israel.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; The last time this last month he was up
[18:02] with us. We had some young people
[18:04] meeting and he preached a wonderful
[18:07] message about Rebecca
[18:09] &gt;&gt; and every time he preach it's sometime I
[18:13] say I could preach like him.
[18:18] But you know,
[18:20] God has his people everywhere.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; It's good to be with you as we listen to
[18:25] the different ministers.
[18:28] And uh
[18:30] you know like in Jesus day,
[18:34] [snorts]
[18:34] the Bible say it was the last day of the
[18:37] feast.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; That Jesus cried and said, "He that is
[18:41] thirsty, let him come."
[18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's something about the last
[18:45] day of the fellowship,
[18:48] you know, it's like in a really
[18:53] you have your first man to start
[18:54] running, the second, but that last man,
[18:58] I don't know. I mean,
[19:01] if you make a wrong move, the whole
[19:03] thing flop [laughter]
[19:07] with all the
[19:09] the great services we had.
[19:13] On Wednesday, we had a wonderful service
[19:15] with Brother Ferguson at our brother's
[19:18] church in Phoenix,
[19:20] and he said, "Come on by." He said, "Uh,
[19:25] your clock isn't turn. Is it? It's It's
[19:28] thinking already. All right.
[19:32] He asked if you can buy the Holy Ghost.
[19:37] And we were wondering where is he
[19:39] getting at?
[19:42] But the scripture said, "Come and buy
[19:44] with money and with a price."
[19:47] &gt;&gt; And he told us we have the purchasing
[19:50] power.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; Which is faith.
[19:54] And then we come and we listen I listen
[19:56] listen to the songs. I listen to the
[19:59] ministers as a minister and then we had
[20:02] the minister's meeting and that was
[20:06] wonderful because you see
[20:09] you see her standing here and minister
[20:13] but you never know what a minister go
[20:16] through.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; He have his battles.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; And he have to be all things for all
[20:22] men. Amen.
[20:24] &gt;&gt; And many times he can't even tell his
[20:25] wife.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; But they too
[20:31] have to fight the battle.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know at the last day of the
[20:36] feast with only 27 minutes left
[20:40] and you know uh it kind of a create an
[20:44] anxiety
[20:47] [laughter]
[20:48] not so much for me for me too but
[20:51] at the last day of the feat we began to
[20:53] think our mind began to think of
[20:56] tomorrow
[20:58] &gt;&gt; catching the plane doing this and the
[21:00] other summer saying Lord in a few hours
[21:03] will will be gone and I didn't get the
[21:06] blessing I needed the way I wanted it.
[21:10] All right.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; So it creates something.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; But the Lord know that the brother was
[21:15] going to give me the bottom of the last.
[21:18] God knew everything.
[21:23] But just before
[21:26] our mind turned completely
[21:29] to tomorrow,
[21:31] let us go to Jeremiah.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:39] Jeremiah the 18th chapter.
[21:44] Let us all stand.
[21:56] the word which came to Jeremiah from the
[21:59] Lord, saying, "Arise, and go down to the
[22:02] potter's house, and there I will cause
[22:05] thee to hear my words." Then I went down
[22:08] to the potter's house, and behold, he
[22:12] wrought a work on the wheel,
[22:15] &gt;&gt; and the vessel that he made of clay was
[22:17] marred in the hand of the potter. So he
[22:21] make it again another vessel that seemed
[22:24] good to the potter to make it. Let's
[22:29] pray. Heavenly Father,
[22:33] we come in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:35] Christ and we thank you for this
[22:37] weekend.
[22:39] You knew everything. You know what we
[22:41] needed.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have a purpose in us being
[22:45] here.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; In ourself,
[22:50] we are nothing.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; We as ministers know Lord that whatever
[22:56] we prepare,
[22:58] no matter how much we study
[23:01] to us is like a little child's lunch.
[23:06] But we know if we give it to you,
[23:09] you will take it
[23:11] &gt;&gt; and divide it to your people as you seem
[23:13] fit.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Into your hands we commit the rest of
[23:16] the service
[23:18] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[23:20] Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[23:26] So I want you to go with me down to the
[23:28] potter's house.
[23:32] And in there we will see
[23:35] many great wonderful works
[23:39] and also
[23:41] many hearts stopping works. And when we
[23:44] look at it we will realize
[23:47] we are what we are by the grace of God.
[23:50] Amen.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; All the blessings we had for the past
[23:55] week,
[23:57] it was not given to us because of our
[24:00] ability.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Romans the 9th chapter.
[24:07] As it written, Jacob have I loved and
[24:11] Esau have I hated. What shall we say
[24:14] then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
[24:17] God forbid. For he said to Moses, I will
[24:21] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[24:24] will have compassion on whom I will have
[24:26] compassion.
[24:28] So here he spoke about this scripture
[24:32] there. When you look at it,
[24:34] you realize you are what you are by the
[24:38] grace of God. Amen.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; All the blessings you have, all the
[24:43] great sermons we listened to the past
[24:46] weekend, we know it's the grace of God.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; It's nothing we done.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; Like you remember, brother Brandham said
[24:54] one time, Abraham as the Lord,
[24:58] he said, I want to see how you're going
[25:01] to save man against his own will.
[25:06] And that man
[25:08] who had as the prophet said an excuse
[25:11] for sin because he will go to the temple
[25:14] with his offering [snorts]
[25:16] and he will leave with the desire to do
[25:19] the same thing. So he said he had an
[25:21] excuse
[25:23] because the bloods of bull and goat
[25:26] could not take away sin. But he says in
[25:28] Calvary,
[25:30] &gt;&gt; you and I can sit here,
[25:32] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[25:32] &gt;&gt; without the desire to sin.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; Now we going down to the bot's house and
[25:39] he put us on that wheel
[25:42] &gt;&gt; so that we will find out, Lord, all that
[25:45] you've done, the effort, was it
[25:48] worthwhile?
[25:49] All the preaching you to listen to the
[25:51] ministers,
[25:53] they were trying to get us to a place so
[25:57] we could be ready for that rapture.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; And we go down there, the Lord will take
[26:04] you, put you on that wheel.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; And all that's not was in his mind, he's
[26:10] going to remove it.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; And sometime the preaching seems to be
[26:15] hard, but God is working out something.
[26:18] Amen.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; And as you sit and listen to the
[26:21] minister, sometime you may see a man.
[26:24] But if you take a second look,
[26:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[26:27] &gt;&gt; It's more than just the man there.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; It's God doing something.
[26:36] God getting a people
[26:38] ready.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; So, we had a great some great messages
[26:44] this morning. There was a quote I wanted
[26:46] to bring. I thought I brought it.
[26:49] But somehow I searched for it and I
[26:51] couldn't. And when brother David was
[26:54] preaching, David was his name, right?
[26:56] &gt;&gt; And he quote the exact thing. You see,
[27:00] because God knew
[27:02] &gt;&gt; he knew you were going to be here. It's
[27:04] not a coincidence.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. He knew you were going
[27:08] to be there. Let me read something for
[27:10] you from the prophet
[27:11] &gt;&gt; to show you that he knew each and every
[27:14] one of you.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Going to be sitting here.
[27:18] listening to this message.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; He knew I was going to be here.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; We didn't plan that because that's a
[27:25] message we believe. That's the God we
[27:26] serve.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; In a message power of transformation, he
[27:30] said Satan tried to spray it like he did
[27:32] Eve. He tried to spray it, but he failed
[27:37] with his repellent on here.
[27:40] He was a predestinated seed. They
[27:43] couldn't take him into make him a
[27:46] Pharisee or Sadducee. They couldn't make
[27:48] him belong to any organization.
[27:51] He was God's predestinated spoken word.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't throw his unbelief on
[27:57] him. He has a repellent on him. God
[28:02] spray us with a repellent is my prayer.
[28:06] Then the spirit moved on him and sent
[28:10] him to Calvary to the cross
[28:12] &gt;&gt; to bring light in this day.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; The light to all the predestinated seed
[28:18] to the church of this day.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Transforming sons and daughters of God
[28:23] into his presence. Don't stumble that
[28:26] word.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Predestination. As our brother was
[28:29] preaching this morning about
[28:30] predestination, God chose you. It was
[28:32] not you that chose this message. Look as
[28:35] the prophet told us [snorts] when a baby
[28:37] is born just before that baby is born he
[28:40] said there's a sweetness that gather
[28:41] around the mother
[28:43] &gt;&gt; now when that baby born there is a
[28:45] spirit waiting to get into that baby now
[28:50] did you make a choice of what spirit get
[28:52] into that baby no
[28:56] some people had a great intelligent
[28:58] spirit some don't some have that spirit
[29:01] that are able to accept the word of God
[29:04] for this day.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; It is God's by his mercy, God by his
[29:09] grace that called you. But listen to
[29:12] this here. [snorts]
[29:14] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't stumble at that word
[29:16] predestination. I've went through that."
[29:20] You see, I want to show you Ephesians
[29:23] 15. You see Jesus, look just as you were
[29:28] in your father. As I said here tonight,
[29:31] just as you were in your father at the
[29:33] beginning, if you wasn't, you wouldn't
[29:36] be here. But you see, it has to go to a
[29:39] bedding ground in order to bring you
[29:41] forth. And now you're his son, you're
[29:44] his daughter. See, it's a seed. If
[29:48] you're a Christian now, a genuine
[29:50] predestinated seed, you were in God
[29:53] before. You always were in God. The germ
[29:56] of your life, which is an attribute of
[29:59] God, which was his thought. He says, so
[30:02] for instance, this pretty little lady
[30:05] sitting here, see, God said,
[30:09] in the day there will be a girl, her
[30:11] name will be so and so. She'll be this
[30:14] thus this and even know the very hour
[30:18] she'll sit and listen at this message
[30:22] dress in a red dress. See that was his
[30:25] thought. Whoever your husband is,
[30:29] whoever he is.
[30:31] And he'll bring this together and you'll
[30:34] sit here in this city at this day. There
[30:38] could be no way for you to fail it
[30:42] because you are growing and as long as
[30:44] your seeds inside growing, you have to
[30:47] produce exactly what the seed said you
[30:51] will do.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly it's his word. He keeps
[30:54] his word. He watches over it. You were
[30:57] in your father as a gem and you come
[30:59] forth as a daughter. You, you, you,
[31:02] everyone, brother and sister, you come
[31:04] forth and if you wasn't in your father,
[31:07] you wouldn't have been here.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like um
[31:16] if you and your wife, the brothers, you
[31:18] and your wife walking down the street
[31:20] and this random person come and say,
[31:22] "Daddy,"
[31:24] your wife's going to say, "Honey, what's
[31:26] going on?"
[31:28] And then you have to tell him look I
[31:30] don't know him. But then the question
[31:33] remain and she said no no no we have to
[31:36] get a blood test
[31:39] and in this day many people are calling
[31:41] God father
[31:43] &gt;&gt; but the prophet said it's that blood
[31:46] test.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; He said if you wasn't in God as a
[31:50] thought
[31:51] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't be here now
[31:54] &gt;&gt; and there is no way you will be able to
[31:56] get there. So your life, my life,
[32:00] &gt;&gt; we are what we are by the grace of God.
[32:03] As Paul said unto us, and he said unto
[32:06] Pharaoh, this very cause have I raised
[32:09] you up. As the Bible said, in a good man
[32:11] house there are many vessels, vessel of
[32:14] honor, vessel of dishonor. So if you by
[32:17] the grace of God know that you're a
[32:19] vessel of honor, cherish it. Amen.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, if you have just a
[32:24] shadow of God, cherish it with all your
[32:27] heart because it was God who decided
[32:29] that.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Listen as we go on.
[32:36] If you wasn't in God,
[32:40] if you believe the message of the Bible
[32:43] and the present message of the day, a
[32:46] vindication of it, the reason you're
[32:48] sitting here because you were
[32:51] predestinated to sit here.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have been here otherwise.
[32:56] You have been on the street, maybe
[32:58] drunk. Some of you, some of you here
[33:02] running around with some other man's
[33:04] wife
[33:05] &gt;&gt; and you woman out will marry and run
[33:08] around with some other woman's husband
[33:10] or something like that. But you are
[33:12] predestinated to be here. See, you can't
[33:15] help it.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; You have a father.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; He is God and you were a seed.
[33:24] [applause]
[33:25] &gt;&gt; So if we hear [cheering]
[33:28] believe in this message,
[33:32] &gt;&gt; you have that ability
[33:35] to receive it the way the messenger
[33:38] receive it from God. Now, that's
[33:39] important. You see, especially for the
[33:42] ministers because the prophet warn us,
[33:44] he said those that go out don't know how
[33:47] necessary it is to say only what the
[33:50] messenger said. They add here, they take
[33:53] away here
[33:55] &gt;&gt; and before long the message is no longer
[33:57] pure
[33:58] &gt;&gt; and they may not realize what it is.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; They might not realize the danger
[34:03] because you see we all looking to go. We
[34:05] looking for rapture. That's our point.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we serve God.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; There is a point in the future when
[34:12] you'll be changed in a moment in the
[34:15] twinkling of an eye. But as he said, a
[34:19] church will seldom live higher
[34:22] &gt;&gt; than the pastor preaches.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; He said because that's the pastor you
[34:26] feed offer. And he said the body you're
[34:29] looking for will materialize around the
[34:33] word that's within you. So if we preach
[34:36] that which is not written,
[34:40] then we'll be waiting for rapture that
[34:42] will never take place.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:44] And as we travel through time, we see
[34:48] how easy it is for us minister to slip
[34:52] in our own idea
[34:55] &gt;&gt; and that is dangerous.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; But as I listen to the services this
[35:01] past week, we give God thanks.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; You that have ministered that can stay
[35:06] with the word, cherish it. cherish it
[35:10] because the prophet told us the day you
[35:13] take in your heart one word that's not
[35:16] the word of God.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S THE day you separate
[35:19] yourself
[35:21] &gt;&gt; from God. Like I told our church, look,
[35:25] if anytime you find us preaching or
[35:29] saying something that's not what that
[35:32] prophecy say, you have the right to come
[35:34] to us because ministers are not the
[35:37] Lord.
[35:39] They are the servant.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; And if you're servant, you serve the
[35:43] people.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; And we must be able to humble ourselves
[35:46] and listen to what they say.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Because the word of the Lord, the word
[35:50] of a prophet take preeminence over
[35:54] everything.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; So I tell them, look, when that time
[35:58] come to make the rapture, you can't
[36:01] blame your pastor
[36:04] &gt;&gt; because God gave you a prophet. So you
[36:07] wouldn't have to hear
[36:09] &gt;&gt; from God second hand.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; You can hear exactly what he said.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; And you, as he said, you're not going to
[36:16] go to restaurant and buy a bowl of soup
[36:18] with a spider. No, you will sue them.
[36:22] But sometime we sit and listen to the
[36:24] minister say any kind of a thing and we
[36:27] say, "Oh, he's a servant of God." The
[36:30] day you put in your heart one word,
[36:33] &gt;&gt; that's not the word of God. Yes,
[36:35] &gt;&gt; you separate yourself from God.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And as the prophet told us, if you want
[36:40] the truth, God will send someone at the
[36:44] pulpit that will preach the exact truth.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Because if I'm looking for a change,
[36:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; And that change will materialize
[36:55] around the words THAT'S WITHIN ME, I
[36:58] MUST be careful in what I receive. We
[37:02] have access to his word
[37:05] &gt;&gt; and did the prophet say we've lost many
[37:08] friends because we try to stay with what
[37:10] that prophet said. But you see [snorts]
[37:14] those of the elect they have the ability
[37:19] to receive what the messenger
[37:22] have already received from God. So when
[37:24] you listen to the brothers preaching,
[37:26] the ministers preaching, we look at a
[37:28] man but the prophet said there is
[37:30] something more than that.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen to this. In [snorts]
[37:34] putting on the whole armor of God,
[37:36] preached 1962, the sixth month and the
[37:38] seventh day, paragraph 75. [snorts]
[37:41] He said, "Oh, God make himself present
[37:44] in his army." Then do you believe that?
[37:47] Now God said, "I send them the word. Eve
[37:51] just walk right over the top of it."
[37:54] Disbelieve it.
[37:56] I made it manifest and they're
[37:58] crucified.
[38:00] I'm just getting tired. I'm coming
[38:03] myself. So here he come. God in you. God
[38:07] above us the pill of fire. God with us.
[38:09] Jesus Christ. God in us the Holy Spirit.
[38:11] What is it? Is the same word, the same
[38:14] God.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; No more trusting in anything else. God
[38:18] comes himself.
[38:20] This was a mansized job. So he just
[38:24] brought it down. He come down himself.
[38:27] They won't have to do nothing about it.
[38:30] Just let them surrender to me and I'll
[38:34] walk in them.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Talk in them. Speak in them. Walk in
[38:41] them. Oh my. That's it. I'll do the do.
[38:44] I'll do the work. Just let them just
[38:46] humble themsel. Let them just empty out
[38:50] and I'll just beat the enemy out there
[38:53] through them.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; That's it. You can't do Joseph now.
[38:57] You're no match for him. But if you'll
[38:59] just let God do it, get the word in you,
[39:04] &gt;&gt; then it'll all be taken care of. That's
[39:07] why we going down to the part of he's
[39:09] going to take us, put us in that wheel
[39:11] and bring back to our memory the things
[39:13] that was said and remember something.
[39:16] When we come across something in the
[39:18] word, in this message
[39:21] &gt;&gt; that stump us, we can't go forward.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; We stop right there. Many people, they
[39:30] disagree with this.
[39:33] They question this and they think
[39:34] they're going on. But no, you stop right
[39:37] there until that is taken care of. He
[39:41] said, "But if they will surrender to me,
[39:43] I will come in
[39:45] &gt;&gt; and I will do the do."
[39:48] &gt;&gt; So as we listen to him, you go back
[39:50] through our mind. Father,
[39:53] did I believe all that was there?
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Did it have an impact on me?
[39:58] &gt;&gt; You see, because the preacher can
[40:00] preach,
[40:01] &gt;&gt; but it's the Holy Spirit that takes the
[40:03] word, place it into the heart of the
[40:05] people. Yes, sir.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; We just come, we have a listening ear,
[40:08] and he is there. Look at the prophet
[40:10] said it's the veil that keep us from
[40:13] seeing the angel of the Lord at the post
[40:14] of duty. He said it's this veil that
[40:17] keeps the flesh that keep us from seeing
[40:19] Jesus right here right around you. The
[40:22] angels are there. He told us that. We
[40:24] believe that but is this veil. So they
[40:26] are watching over the world. Take that
[40:27] word place it in our heart. But what
[40:31] have we done with it? Here it is.
[40:37] Now God fortify his army. What with
[40:41] himself? In the form of prophets,
[40:44] apostles,
[40:46] teachers, pastors. What did he do? What
[40:50] was God doing? Listen. Did you ever
[40:54] think what that office of the church is?
[40:56] It's God's dress.
[40:59] Inside dress. An apostle, a prophet, a
[41:03] seer foresee. Before Satan ever get
[41:06] there, it's done told. What is it? God
[41:09] dressed up in his church. These offices
[41:13] is God's dress wear. When you see these
[41:16] offices, pastors, teachers, evangelists,
[41:20] what it is, that's God's dressear,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; God's presence, God's spirit, and it's
[41:27] working through man.
[41:29] And if that office deny any of the word,
[41:34] then it's not God's dress.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, not that. That's a wolf in
[41:40] sheep clothing.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Watch that fellow.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Beware of him.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; What is it? Death is looking here.
[41:50] Satan is trying to destroy the because
[41:52] it's you that's going in the rapture.
[41:54] And you know, one word could change the
[41:57] whole picture.
[41:58] As the prophet said, watch when people
[42:01] come to the Lord,
[42:03] watch the spirit working there.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of a person he will grow
[42:08] up. And in the meeting, we saw the
[42:11] spirit of God as we watch. You see,
[42:14] because you choose a church that will
[42:16] help guide you to your eternal
[42:19] destination.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; So, we're not here by chance.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; God permitted us to be here and we enjoy
[42:25] the service. We enjoy the fellowship.
[42:27] Especially the ministers
[42:30] meeting it was great. As the ministers
[42:34] express themselves realize human being
[42:38] are the same. The only difference is
[42:39] that God gives some people greater
[42:42] responsibility
[42:44] and in this end time if he call you to
[42:45] be a minister is because there's
[42:48] something in you that great otherwise he
[42:50] was going to choose a lesser person but
[42:53] the battle is there. But he promised to
[42:58] give grace.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; And sometime as the prophet said, we
[43:01] find trials and it seem like we go
[43:04] through trials that we never had when we
[43:06] were out there.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; He said, but God is doing that for a
[43:09] purpose.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; He want a certain dean out of your
[43:13] testimony. He says like this molders
[43:16] molding a special certain bear. He won't
[43:20] put all brass. There's different earth
[43:22] that he put in there because he want a
[43:24] certain ring and trials come,
[43:27] persecution come. Sometime you have to
[43:29] stand alone. But is God testing you?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; He brought you here for a purpose.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; As you listen to the word, it fortifies
[43:39] you.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Because our goal is to make that
[43:44] rapture.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; We'll go through trials. We'll go
[43:48] through persecution. You may have to
[43:49] stand alone. for that which you believe.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; But first of all, believe your prophet.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; People question that.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; And but let me ask you something. If
[44:05] they reject this prophet and say he make
[44:07] mistake here, then what kind of a gospel
[44:11] they going to preach?
[44:14] They have to find their own baptism.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; They can't preach sen.
[44:19] They can't preach deity.
[44:23] What are they preaching? They preaching
[44:25] the Bible. The Bible was a closed book.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; But Jude said
[44:32] some men
[44:34] were ordained for this destruction. You
[44:38] can't help it. It's like Balam's donkey.
[44:41] Bam's donkey was a dain for that. That's
[44:44] all we heard of it. After [snorts]
[44:45] Balam, we didn't hear anything about the
[44:47] donkey. You don't know where he came
[44:48] from, but the donkey had to be there to
[44:50] say, "Baum, what have I done? I'm not
[44:52] your donkey. Did I ever act like that
[44:54] before?"
[44:55] It's like that donkey that when Samson
[44:59] needed a weapon.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; That donkey had to be there. You see
[45:04] your purpose of existence,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; you and I, we have a purpose of
[45:09] existence.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said that is we have a
[45:13] sacred trust. And that is this message
[45:16] that's given to us that we should not
[45:20] compromise it.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; We must keep it pure.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; But to do that, something must have got
[45:27] a hold of you.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; You see, there is a power walking beyond
[45:31] the scene.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; All we can see is our lives. But what
[45:35] gives you the power? Look at He said,
[45:37] look, it's like a lid been removed over
[45:39] hell. Demon power streaming everywhere.
[45:41] Conquer the nation. Conquer the
[45:42] churches. But every now and then he said
[45:44] there's a little light. That's the born
[45:46] again. What is it that keep you in this
[45:48] evil day that can sit here
[45:51] &gt;&gt; without the desire of sin?
[45:56] The only reason you can do that is
[45:58] because the supernatural got a hold of
[46:01] you.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; You may go through trial, may go through
[46:04] persecution.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; But if God change your life, like he
[46:08] said, you look back to the pit where he
[46:09] called you. You're not that no more.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Something got a hold
[46:15] &gt;&gt; of you.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Stay with God.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Stay with the message
[46:21] &gt;&gt; because we only have a few years in the
[46:23] sun.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Like you meet sometime the age people
[46:28] walk in the street and people despise
[46:31] them. What they don't realize in that
[46:34] day there was the stars of the day. And
[46:37] one of these days if we t
[46:40] people have to look after us. But while
[46:44] we here let's serve the Lord.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And at the end we want him to say well
[46:50] done thou good.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; And faithful server.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; And there was a little song
[46:57] that sum it all up.
[47:00] I don't know if I can
[47:03] talk. It's just a sharing you maybe.
[47:11] In shady
[47:14] green pasture,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; so rich and so sweet,
[47:20] God leades
[47:22] their children
[47:25] alone.
[47:28] Where the water cold flow bases, the
[47:32] weary ones feet, godly
[47:37] is their children
[47:40] long.
[47:43] Some through the water,
[47:47] some through the flood,
[47:52] &gt;&gt; some through the fire. [singing]
[47:56] But all true divine
[48:00] [music]
[48:01] some true great [singing]
[48:03] sorrow.
[48:06] But God give us all [music and singing]
[48:11] in the night [singing] season
[48:15] [music] and all.
[48:22] Sometimes on the mountain where the sun
[48:28] [music and singing] shines so bright,
[48:32] God lead his dead children
[48:36] [singing and music]
[48:37] alone.
[48:40] Yes. [music and singing]
[48:42] I'm tired
[48:44] in the valley.
[48:47] The darkest
[48:49] of night
[48:51] [singing and music]
[49:02] sound true.
[49:04] [singing and music]
[49:06] Sound true of love.
[49:11] Sound [singing] true your fire.
[49:16] But all true [music]
[49:21] sound true [singing] sorrow
[49:25] but God give us all
[49:31] in [music] the [singing] night season
[49:35] and all.
[49:42] So go sorrow [music]
[49:45] before [singing] us and say
[49:52] [music]
[49:52] [singing]
[49:55] children
[49:57] our Lord [music]
[50:01] and true grace [singing] we can conery
[50:07] [music]
[50:11] glory
[50:13] anymore.
[50:16] [music]
[50:22] Sound true to your water. [singing]
[50:26] [music] Sound true
[50:29] love
[50:31] and sound [music]
[50:34] your fire.
[50:39] [music]
[50:42] True [singing] sorrow.
[50:50] [music]
[50:51] in the night [singing] season
[50:56] and all [music]
[50:57] the
[51:02] so [singing and music]
[51:08] away from [singing and music]
[51:11] the
[51:13] heart
[51:16] will [music] our
[51:23] way of
[51:26] glory
[51:28] eternal. [music]
[51:32] [singing]

[1:43:56] Is that okay?
[1:44:00] I learned this one from Israel.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; I love the sunsets. I just just take
[1:44:10] down time a horse and take up top the
[1:44:12] mountains and stay a couple days just
[1:44:14] watching the sunrise and go down and
[1:44:17] hearing the EAGLE SCREAM. IT'S GOOD. I
[1:44:20] LOVE TO BE THERE. BUT rather my heart
[1:44:23] begins to thump and to beat when I think
[1:44:26] of unclean, unclean, the evil spirits to
[1:44:30] him.
[1:44:33] ALL IS WELL WHEN JESUS COMES to stay. I
[1:44:37] begin to think of the sick people in
[1:44:38] that call and there's something WITHIN
[1:44:41] ME CRIES OUT. GET DOWN OUT [screaming]
[1:44:42] OF THESE MOUNTAINS RIGHT QUICK.
[1:44:45] Get down there to the people. I WANT TO
[1:44:48] IDENTIFY MYSELF AS HIS SERVANT.
[1:44:51] among his people.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love to identify myself with
[1:44:57] him. Then in regards to that, he comes
[1:45:01] back among us and identifies himself
[1:45:03] with us.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; He's sure tonight,
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; friend.
[1:45:20] One [music] sat alone
[1:45:24] beside the highway, begging.
[1:45:29] His eyes were blind.
[1:45:33] The light he could not see.
[1:45:38] He clutched his rags
[1:45:41] and shivered in the shadows.
[1:45:46] Then Jesus
[1:45:49] came
[1:45:51] and made his darkness flee
[1:45:57] from home and friends.
[1:46:00] The evil spirits drove him
[1:46:05] among the tombs. He [music] dwelt in
[1:46:10] misery. [singing]
[1:46:13] He caught himself
[1:46:16] as [music] demon [singing]
[1:46:17] powers possessed him.
[1:46:21] Then [music] Jesus
[1:46:23] came and set the captive free.
[1:46:31] When Jesus [singing]
[1:46:33] comes,
[1:46:35] the temptor's power is broken. [singing]
[1:46:40] When [music] Jesus comes,
[1:46:43] our fiercy wipes away.
[1:46:48] He takes [music] the [singing] gloom
[1:46:51] and fills the life with glory.
[1:46:57] Your whole [music]
[1:46:59] is changed when Jesus [singing]
[1:47:02] comes to stay.
[1:47:06] Unclean, [singing and music]
[1:47:08] unclean,
[1:47:10] the leper cried in torment,
[1:47:14] the death of dumb. In
[1:47:18] [music and singing] helplessness stood
[1:47:19] near.
[1:47:22] The fever raged.
[1:47:25] disease had gripped its [music] victim.
[1:47:28] [singing]
[1:47:30] Then Jesus came and he cast out
[1:47:35] [singing] every fear.
[1:47:42] So [singing and music] many today
[1:47:46] have found the Savior able. [singing]
[1:47:50] They could not [music] coner
[1:47:53] passion lust and sin.
[1:47:58] Their broken hearts
[1:48:01] had left them sad and lonely.
[1:48:06] Then [singing] Jesus
[1:48:09] came [music] and dwelt himself within.
[1:48:16] When Jesus comes, [singing and music]
[1:48:19] the ttor's power is broken.
[1:48:24] When Jesus comes, [music and singing]
[1:48:27] the tears are wiped away.
[1:48:32] He takes [music] the gloom and fills the
[1:48:36] life with glory.
[1:48:40] for all is changed when Jesus comes to
[1:48:46] stay.
[1:48:49] Their hearts were [music] sad as in the
[1:48:54] tomb they laid him
[1:48:57] for [singing] death had come and taken
[1:49:02] him away.
[1:49:06] Their night was dark
[1:49:09] and bitter tears were falling.
[1:49:14] Then [music and singing] Jesus
[1:49:16] came and night was [singing] turned to
[1:49:21] day. [music]
[1:49:23] When Jesus comes, [singing]
[1:49:26] the temptor's power is broken.
[1:49:31] When [singing] Jesus comes our tears,
[1:49:34] [music] he wipes away.
[1:49:39] He takes [singing] the gloom
[1:49:42] and fills the life with glory.
[1:49:46] [singing]
[1:49:47] For all is changed.
[1:49:52] For all is changed.
[1:49:58] Your whole
[1:50:01] is changed
[1:50:04] [music]

[1:50:08] comes

[2:00:29] testimony real quick. So uh
[2:00:32] [clears throat]
[2:00:33] as most of you know, we live in Airio
[2:00:35] now. So the car working right is kind of
[2:00:38] a big deal. So we get here and then
[2:00:41] Saturday morning, camera runs out to go
[2:00:43] do some things. She comes back to the
[2:00:45] house and she's like, "Oh,
[2:00:48] the the fan's running non-stop. the
[2:00:50] temperature gauge is all the way at zero
[2:00:52] and it's, you know, the fan's just
[2:00:55] running non-stop. So, sure enough, she
[2:00:58] gets home and I can just hear the fan
[2:01:00] running and running and running. We had
[2:01:01] this issue before and Brother Ellie Ezer
[2:01:04] fixed it for us. And so, [clears throat]
[2:01:08] obviously, we're going to want to attend
[2:01:10] the meetings [music] and everything. So,
[2:01:11] we had that on our mind as
[2:01:14] we get in the car, we're leaving to come
[2:01:16] here Saturday morning. [music] um we're
[2:01:18] we're thinking about it and we're both
[2:01:20] bummed, you know, just kind of like, oh,
[2:01:22] this is a bummer. Like, what how are we
[2:01:23] going to do this? And I told Camela
[2:01:26] something in in that [music] moment just
[2:01:27] came over me and I was just like, you
[2:01:29] know what? We're here to we're here for
[2:01:30] these meetings to give God praise to
[2:01:33] [music] hear his word. The Lord's going
[2:01:35] to honor this, hun. We're going to be
[2:01:36] fine. I don't know. I don't know how. I
[2:01:39] don't know if we're gonna meet somebody
[2:01:41] this weekend that's gonna help us or
[2:01:44] somehow, you know, he's gonna send his
[2:01:46] brother at le
[2:01:50] something's going to happen. I I don't
[2:01:52] know what, but something's going to
[2:01:53] happen. God's going to take care of it.
[2:01:54] It's in his hands.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; So, we drive down here, the AC stops
[2:01:59] working. Um, and then Yeah. [laughter]
[2:02:03] Right. Thankfully, it's not summer. But
[2:02:06] so then we get uh we have the the Sunday
[2:02:09] or the Saturday morning service. We get
[2:02:11] back in the car and then get back in.
[2:02:14] Fans running non-stop.
[2:02:16] All the temperatures down. We turn onto
[2:02:19] the road before we get to Grant Road.
[2:02:23] Temperature goes up back normal and AC's
[2:02:25] blowing cold.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; That's fine. [applause and music]

[2:03:50] I don't know what tomorrow [singing]
[2:03:53] will bring.
[2:03:55] I can't tell you what's in store. I
[2:03:59] don't know a lot of things.
[2:04:03] I don't have all [singing and music] the
[2:04:04] answers to the questions of life,
[2:04:10] but I know in [singing] whom I have
[2:04:13] believed.
[2:04:16] And he [music] knows my name.
[2:04:20] Every step that [singing] I take,
[2:04:23] [music] every move that I make,
[2:04:28] every [singing and music] tear that I
[2:04:30] cry.
[2:04:32] And he knows [singing and music] my
[2:04:34] name. When I'm overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:04:40] I can't [singing] see the light of day.
[2:04:44] I know I'll be just fine.
[2:04:48] Cuz he knows [singing] my name.
[2:04:55] Knew who I was when he carried
[2:04:59] [singing and music]
[2:05:00] my cross. cross. He knew that [singing]
[2:05:04] I would fail him, but he took the lo.
[2:05:11] He knows my name.
[2:05:15] Every step [singing] that I take,
[2:05:19] every move that I make,
[2:05:23] every [singing] tear that I cry.
[2:05:27] and he knows [singing and music] my
[2:05:29] name. When I'm overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:05:35] I can't [singing and music] see the
[2:05:36] light of day.
[2:05:39] I know I'll be just [singing] fine.
[2:05:43] Cuz he knows [music] my name.
[2:05:47] Every [singing] step that I take,
[2:05:52] every move that I make, [singing]
[2:05:56] every tear that I cry,
[2:06:00] he knows [singing] my name.
[2:06:39] When the Harvest
[2:06:41] has been gathered
[2:06:44] and all [singing]
[2:06:46] my work is done.
[2:06:49] When the last
[2:06:51] miles been traveled
[2:06:55] and I've sung my final [music] song,
[2:06:59] if I'm called to [singing] give an
[2:07:03] answer
[2:07:05] at heaven's
[2:07:07] judgment [music and singing] seat,
[2:07:10] then let the blood of Calvary
[2:07:16] speak
[2:07:17] for me.
[2:07:20] May he [singing] write me down as
[2:07:23] [music] righteous
[2:07:25] when your [singing] rightousness
[2:07:28] has been
[2:07:30] shielding me [singing]
[2:07:33] from wrath and judgment [music]
[2:07:36] as it covers
[2:07:38] all my sin.
[2:07:41] There's [music] no work that I've
[2:07:44] accomplished,
[2:07:46] nor my goodness
[2:07:48] would I plead.
[2:07:51] Just [singing] let the blood of Calvary.
[2:07:55] [music]
[2:07:57] Speak
[2:07:58] for me.
[2:08:04] There may be some friends who witness
[2:08:08] and speak
[2:08:11] a word so kind,
[2:08:14] but their voice would
[2:08:16] [singing and music] seem so feeble
[2:08:19] at such an awesome time.
[2:08:24] And there's a [singing] voice that calls
[2:08:26] for mercy [music]
[2:08:29] ringing through
[2:08:31] eternity. [singing]
[2:08:33] Oh, just let the blood of Calvary
[2:08:37] [music]
[2:08:38] speak [singing]
[2:08:40] for me.
[2:08:43] May he [music] write me down as
[2:08:46] [singing] righteous where no
[2:08:49] rightuousness [music]
[2:08:51] has been.
[2:08:53] shielding me from wrath
[2:08:55] [singing and music] and judgment
[2:08:58] as it covers [singing and music] all my
[2:09:01] sin.
[2:09:03] There's no work that I've accomplished
[2:09:06] [music]
[2:09:07] nor my goodness [singing]
[2:09:10] what I plead.
[2:09:13] Just [music] let the blood of glory
[2:09:18] spill [singing and music]
[2:09:20] for me.
[2:10:27] One day,

[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord Jesus tonight. It's really
[2:17:26] hard to close. I know you've got a song
[2:17:27] on your heart, a thought on your mind, a
[2:17:29] testimony, but we probably should start
[2:17:32] stop somewhere. Brother Nathan, that
[2:17:34] timer is awesome. I've got more time
[2:17:36] than when we started. We had four. Now
[2:17:38] we got five.
[2:17:41] That might get me into trouble, but we
[2:17:43] just love you so much. We want you to
[2:17:44] have a safe trip. We're try to feed you
[2:17:47] a little bit here. We'll pray for the
[2:17:48] food. We had Art taking care. We tried
[2:17:51] to save him a seat here. We messed that
[2:17:53] up. And so, I'm going to have brother
[2:17:54] Art come and he's got anything on his
[2:17:57] heart and close. If we've missed
[2:17:58] anything for announcements or anything,
[2:18:00] we'll take care of that. But we just
[2:18:02] love you very much.
[2:18:04] Appreciate you coming out. put his
[2:18:05] shoulder to the will and and our
[2:18:08] precious pastor, of course, now we have
[2:18:09] a little bit more faith and power and
[2:18:11] strength to become the children of God.
[2:18:14] Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; And I love you, brother Israel. Give him
[2:18:17] a hand if you would. The Lord Jesus.
[2:18:20] [applause]
[2:18:29] [applause]
[2:18:32] Thank you, brother Israel. We love you
[2:18:33] so much. So many things had to come
[2:18:35] together. You heard the testimony of the
[2:18:36] building and all the things and some we
[2:18:38] forget about and some you can see, some
[2:18:40] you can't. So much work went into these
[2:18:42] things. We just want to thank the
[2:18:43] visitors. Many traveling will be praying
[2:18:46] for you on your way home. The Alaskans,
[2:18:47] the temperature is a lot better here.
[2:18:49] It's pretty warm. Hot. Yeah. But maybe
[2:18:51] we can keep them around for a few days.
[2:18:53] But we know you'll be going home soon. I
[2:18:56] wanted to thank Brian White. So we'll
[2:18:59] feed you here. If you go somewhere else,
[2:19:00] great. You probably won't be going to
[2:19:02] Chick-fil-A today. Who's going to
[2:19:03] Chick-fil-A today? Everybody knows
[2:19:06] they're closed. We've got some big
[2:19:08] patrons over here. We have a couple of
[2:19:10] lovely people that work there and they
[2:19:12] donated all of our drinks, gallons and
[2:19:14] gallons of tea. And so when you go to
[2:19:17] Aina,
[2:19:19] [applause]
[2:19:25] [applause]
[2:19:26] make sure you thank Brian White. He's
[2:19:28] just been a real good boss and things
[2:19:30] and so we we appreciate him so much and
[2:19:32] he will be blessed. We believe it. So,
[2:19:34] we're going to cut things a little
[2:19:35] short. Our local people we didn't get
[2:19:37] to. We're sorry. We'll get you next week
[2:19:39] or when we can. Praise the Lord. So,
[2:19:41] Brother Art, where are you? Come and
[2:19:43] help us, my brother.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you would also remember in
[2:19:55] prayer um I think it was mentioned
[2:19:57] earlier but uh behind every good man
[2:20:01] there's a good woman.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; I think we heard that before but also
[2:20:04] you know brother Israel mentioned it and
[2:20:06] so you know as a saying goes
[2:20:11] there's a shepherd. The goal is to get
[2:20:13] the shepherd but in order to get the
[2:20:15] shepherd if he can't he's going to go to
[2:20:17] the next step down
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; if it's not from his wife he's going to
[2:20:19] go to his family. So
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; K brothers was family in prayer. Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Call him out by name,
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; right? Because even though it takes a
[2:20:27] burden for a man, but it takes a family
[2:20:29] to stand behind him. So, as we go in
[2:20:31] prayer, let's remember that as well.
[2:20:33] Let's all bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[2:20:35] Father, just want to say thank you,
[2:20:37] Lord, we appreciate this opportunity
[2:20:39] first and foremost to appreciate our
[2:20:41] pastor, God. Thank you, Father, for
[2:20:43] putting the burden upon his heart. Lord,
[2:20:45] we appreciate him. We do believe God
[2:20:47] he's [music] not only called of you but
[2:20:49] also Lord we just ask the wisdom and
[2:20:51] leadership Lord for him and his ministry
[2:20:54] God Father the anointing and just Lord
[2:20:57] appreciate all that he's done [music]
[2:20:59] like to especially call out Lord his
[2:21:01] family father we appreciate them so much
[2:21:04] Lord maybe they don't realize [music]
[2:21:06] that we recognize Father that there's
[2:21:10] anointing upon them just as much as
[2:21:12] there is their father and Lord I just
[2:21:14] want to ask a special blessing ing for
[2:21:16] sister Sharon and Karesa and Levi and
[2:21:19] Aaliyah. Lord, I ask Lord God that you
[2:21:22] seal them all with the Holy Ghost,
[2:21:23] Father, to stand behind, Lord, her
[2:21:26] husband [music] and their dad, Lord
[2:21:28] Jesus, God, a special anointing. Help
[2:21:30] them to be examples, Lord God, till they
[2:21:32] come in contact with
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Lord. May you protect them. And also,
[2:21:36] Lord God, for each and every one of us
[2:21:38] here, Father, many have made just such a
[2:21:41] sacrifice in [music] finance and time
[2:21:43] off work. Lord, please God, bless their
[2:21:45] efforts abundantly. And also, Lord
[2:21:48] Jesus, Father, the words that were
[2:21:50] spoken here throughout [music] the
[2:21:51] weekend, Lord, it would only take you to
[2:21:54] take these words from our mind and
[2:21:55] transfer them into our heart and to
[2:21:57] quicken it, Lord, to bring a life away
[2:21:58] in [music] the gospel. Father, we humbly
[2:22:00] ask, Lord God, that you would take these
[2:22:02] things and make them so plain, Lord God,
[2:22:05] [music] that we would walk away just new
[2:22:08] creatures in Christ. And also, Lord, may
[2:22:11] you protect each [music] and everyone
[2:22:12] that's traveling. keep them safe, Lord
[2:22:14] God. Bless them, bless their family,
[2:22:17] bless them and their efforts, Lord God.
[2:22:19] And Lord, as we leave this building,
[2:22:22] Father, we're going to break bread and
[2:22:24] not only spiritually, but also
[2:22:25] physically. May you bless the food, Lord
[2:22:27] God, sanctify it to our body, but Lord
[2:22:30] Jesus, but also there was many brothers
[2:22:32] and sisters that [music] effort, Father,
[2:22:34] they just took the time to cook and
[2:22:37] prepare and Lord just gave themselves.
[2:22:39] Lord God, I just ask you bless these
[2:22:41] sisters, these brothers for all their
[2:22:43] efforts, but I don't know each and every
[2:22:45] one, God, but I've seen them working.
[2:22:46] [music] You know their name as that song
[2:22:48] was sung. Please God, bless them
[2:22:50] abundantly. We just give you thanks,
[2:22:52] Lord. Bless our brother Joe for [music]
[2:22:54] the service here, Lord, as efforts, all
[2:22:56] the song leaders, all the musicians,
[2:22:57] Lord, everything that's been said and
[2:22:59] done, Father, all things are in vain
[2:23:02] without you. And we do it for your honor
[2:23:04] and for your glory. Please, Lord Jesus,
[2:23:06] hear our prayer. We commit this service.
[2:23:09] Father, we thank you. We ask for a
[2:23:11] blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:23:12] Christ. And God's people said, "Amen."
[2:23:14] Amen.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Is there anything
[2:23:17] that we've missed? Brother Levi, Sister
[2:23:19] Sharon, Brother Israel.
[2:23:22] We just love appreciate you so much.
[2:23:24] We'll have the ushers come. If they give
[2:23:26] us more instructions, we'll take more
[2:23:27] instructions. We're going to sing I'm
[2:23:29] looking for a city. It's not the city so
[2:23:31] much, but you'll be there. And most
[2:23:32] importantly, he'll be there and we'll be
[2:23:34] able to thank him. [music] So, we won't
[2:23:35] dismiss until we get to that part. I've
[2:23:37] heard the prophet's message and then
[2:23:38] we'll let them let you go. [music]
[2:23:40] I'm [singing] looking for a city, the
[2:23:44] one not
[2:23:49] and I see promised land. The waters will
[2:23:54] be parted and I'll [music] be on my way
[2:23:59] as we're crossing [singing] over Jordan.
[2:24:09] everlasting [music]
[2:24:10] [singing] joy within. Oh, since he came
[2:24:15] and he took [singing and music] away my
[2:24:17] sin the moment that he blessed me, he
[2:24:21] made me fully Lord. He put that
[2:24:25] [singing and music] everlasting
[2:24:26] joy in my soul.
[2:24:30] [singing]
[2:24:32] Amen. I appreciate brother Art. He
[2:24:34] mentioned [music] the sisters. They do
[2:24:35] all the work and then we come up here
[2:24:37] and sing and stuff. Well, we appreciate
[2:24:38] them and love them so much. So, thank
[2:24:40] you for [music] acknowledging them. Our
[2:24:41] and our sound people just work their
[2:24:43] tails off and up and down and we love
[2:24:47] them [applause]
[2:24:51] and the AV and all those things. And so,
[2:24:53] we just appreciate everybody so much.
[2:24:56] All right, so let's get with the
[2:24:57] program. Sister Sharon, where are we at
[2:24:59] here?
[2:25:01] Let's keep singing that song. Sister,
[2:25:03] I'm drinking from [singing and music]
[2:25:05] the fountain that flowth from on high.
[2:25:09] It's a well of blessing water. [music]
[2:25:12] Well, it never [singing] shall dry. I'm
[2:25:16] feasting on God's man. I'm [music]
[2:25:19] bringing my
[2:25:22] [singing] everlasting joy to stay.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; He came and he took away my sin. [music]
[2:25:41] The moment [singing]
[2:25:42] that he blessed me, he made me fully
[2:25:46] hope for that everlasting joy within my
[2:25:51] soul. [music] I've heard the prophet's
[2:25:53] message. I've heard the [singing]
[2:25:55] prophet's message. I [music] placed it
[2:25:58] in my heart. Well, I [singing] brought
[2:26:01] the revelation
[2:26:03] and it [music] never shall.
[2:26:07] The rapture is among [music and singing]
[2:26:09] us. The sage is said to know and we have
[2:26:14] this precious [music] promise we all
[2:26:17] know.
[2:26:19] Now I [singing and music] have my
[2:26:23] everlasting joy within.
[2:26:26] Oh s [singing and music]
[2:26:29] enter my s
[2:26:34] and my be may
