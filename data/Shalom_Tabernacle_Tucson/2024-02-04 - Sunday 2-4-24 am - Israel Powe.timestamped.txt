[1:29] thing
[1:49] [Music]
[1:58] an
[2:00] that's what
[2:02] started that's exactly what done the
[2:04] whole thing was turning from
[2:15] God's
[2:17] she
[2:21] word she from the word and the first
[2:26] thing started prostitution in the Church
[2:29] of the Living God Christ bride she
[2:31] turned from the word and accepted Roman
[2:35] Dogma instead of God's word what's
[2:39] happened to every organization it did
[2:41] the very same
[2:44] [Music]
[2:47] thing now but promised that in the last
[2:51] days he would make a way to restore
[2:55] again the word of the Lord would drop
[2:58] upon the Earth as he did it in the
[3:01] beginning and all and will restore back
[3:03] what what started it against the word
[3:06] and what is this th supposed to do when
[3:08] he comes Anointed with God Spirit he
[3:11] just brings the faith of the children
[3:13] back to the
[3:14] fathers that's how he restores and you
[3:17] get the same word in the same place that
[3:19] it is here it's going to do the same
[3:22] thing Jesus said If any man be of mine
[3:25] if he that believeth in me the works
[3:27] that I do shall he do also am amen and
[3:31] when he asked him to do certain things
[3:32] he said I do just what the father shows
[3:33] me I don't do nothing till I see it
[3:35] first what I see the father doing that I
[3:38] do also the father worketh and then I
[3:41] worketh hither to see don't you see it
[3:45] well it's just like reading the
[3:47] newspaper now now first then he become
[3:50] an antichrist now it couldn't be
[3:52] Antichrist only in spirit then become an
[3:55] antichrist and that Spirit took a man
[3:58] that taught the same things that that
[4:00] Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he
[4:03] become a false prophet to the Antichrist
[4:06] spirit amen now what about a man in an
[4:10] organization to yourself I don't know
[4:12] what you think about it all right now
[4:14] finally he becomes a beast amen weit
[4:18] we'll get into that after a while see
[4:20] all right now is Satan's Trinity lays
[4:24] like that Satan all the time Satan
[4:28] Antichrist Spirit Antichrist spirit
[4:29] incarnate false prophet then becomes a
[4:32] beast see when not a demon that was in
[4:36] that Antichrist but when Satan himself
[4:38] is kicked out he comes down and takes
[4:40] over the place where the demon was the
[4:44] devil in then the devil is Incarnate in
[4:48] a man it's just repeating itself That's
[4:50] What Judas is Carrot
[4:52] was and what did he do was he one of the
[4:55] th that was against Christ why he was a
[4:58] treasure walk with him surely walked
[5:03] right along with him went out there and
[5:04] cast out devils and done just exactly
[5:07] what they
[5:08] did and Christ was the Incarnate God God
[5:14] incarnate in flesh Emmanuel and Judas
[5:17] was the son of predition as Jesus was
[5:21] Son of God incarnate God incarnate devil
[5:25] some people only SE three crosses at
[5:28] that time there was four of them
[5:30] there was three on gotha that we see
[5:34] that was Jesus in the middle a thief on
[5:37] his left the thief on his right and
[5:40] watch one Thief said to the other or
[5:44] said to Jesus if now you know he's the
[5:47] word but if thou be the
[5:50] word won't you save yourself won't you
[5:53] do something about it that's the same
[5:55] thing today have you heard these old
[5:56] Devils come say if you believe in the r
[5:58] healing here's somebody the ey don't you
[6:00] open their eyes smite me blind smite me
[6:02] blind the same old devil see come down
[6:05] off the cross we believe you if you be
[6:08] the Son of God turn these stones into
[6:09] bread same devil just walk
[6:13] away that's way Jesus did it he never
[6:16] clown for any of them put a rag over his
[6:18] hand over his precious eyes like that
[6:20] and they Tu a stick and hit him on top
[6:22] the said tell us if you're a prophet now
[6:25] tell us who hit you the chain the stick
[6:27] one to another now tell us who hit you
[6:29] we'll believe you're a prophet he never
[6:30] open his mouth he just said
[6:32] that he don't clown he just does as the
[6:36] father
[6:37] says let them go ahead their time's
[6:39] coming don't
[6:41] worry now they touched His Garment they
[6:43] felt no virtue but a poor little woman
[6:45] had a knee just touched His Garment he
[6:47] turned around said who touched
[6:48] me it's lot a different touch it depends
[6:51] on how you're
[6:52] touching what you believe now you see
[6:56] now as
[6:57] Satan is going to has incarnate himself
[7:02] from Antichrist the false prophet now
[7:06] and in the days of the Jew he is
[7:09] Antichrist amongst the early Church in
[7:13] the Dark Ages he become a false prophet
[7:15] to the world see there her couple of
[7:19] iniquity now that's to the church age
[7:22] now but in the age after the church goes
[7:26] home he becomes a beast he becomes the
[7:28] devil in innate the red dragon
[7:32] himself oh my can't you see what I mean
[7:35] he's incarnate in his people land he's
[7:38] got his people Bound by his power amen
[7:41] the false prophet has prophesied him
[7:43] right into it give them over to strong
[7:46] delusions to believe a ly be damned by
[7:49] denying the word with the farm of
[7:51] godliness God works this place in the
[7:54] Trinity justification sanctification and
[7:57] incarnate himself in his people at the
[7:58] baptism of the Holy
[8:00] Ghost same the Devil exist in a time
[8:04] after
[8:05] Christ oh Satan incarnates himself I
[8:09] what
[8:11] Satan when Jesus incarnates himself in
[8:16] his people the very life that was in
[8:19] Christ is in the person that's right
[8:22] what would it do if you took the life
[8:24] out of a grap Vine and put it in a
[8:26] pumpkin vine it wouldn't be pumpkins no
[8:28] more
[8:29] grapes why if you took the life out of a
[8:32] peach tree and put it in a pear tree
[8:34] would it bear pears no bear peaches the
[8:37] life tells what it is see when you say
[8:41] hear people say they got the Holy Ghost
[8:42] and deny this word there's something
[8:44] wrong the Holy Ghost wrote that word and
[8:48] Jesus said this if a man has my spirit
[8:51] in him he'll do my works you want to
[8:54] read that you going put it down St John
[8:56] 14:12 yeah all right
[9:00] he that believeth in me the works that I
[9:02] do shall he do also even more than this
[9:06] shall he do for I go to the father see
[9:09] then he sanctifies him cleans him so he
[9:11] can stand before God that drop of ink
[9:14] Falls there and takes him across the
[9:15] chasm see now watch Satan when he
[9:19] incarnates himself in his
[9:21] subjects they do the work that he
[9:26] did don't you see what did he do come
[9:30] right to that innocent woman to deceive
[9:33] her that's exactly what some of these
[9:35] Devils
[9:36] do come right into a place to say a
[9:39] little Pastor gets started out somewhere
[9:41] come and say oh if you just join up with
[9:44] us the same devil
[9:47] work now that's the truth am and when
[9:51] Satan become incarnate into his church
[9:54] and to be a devil then they are the ones
[9:57] that does the murdering and killing and
[9:59] so forth because Satan is a killer in
[10:01] the first place a liar see all
[10:06] right what does Satan do when he does
[10:09] when he becomes incarnate amongst the
[10:10] people it's his duty to be
[10:13] shrewd he is true you search the
[10:18] Bible and you show me where God ever
[10:21] dealt with intellectual
[10:23] people amen hunt amen and see if it
[10:28] isn't always the intellectuals that's
[10:30] devil
[10:32] possessed that's right it's a big word
[10:35] but it's a
[10:36] truth I challenge you to take the the
[10:39] leage from Abels to
[10:43] King and then 14 Generations run them
[10:46] out and see which ones was on the smart
[10:48] side and which ones are the humble
[10:52] ones why didn't Jesus choose such people
[10:55] you got fishermen and man that couldn't
[10:58] even sign their own
[11:00] name to put him the head of his
[11:04] church that's
[11:06] right wisdom is is nothing it's it's
[11:09] against Christ worldly wisdom is against
[11:12] Christ amen always Jesus never did
[11:15] telescope
[11:17] seminaries he never did it having Bible
[11:21] schools he said preach the word preach
[11:25] the gospel amen and now if he said these
[11:28] signs shall follow them and believe see
[11:31] you'll have to have the in other words
[11:33] he said go demonstrate the power of
[11:37] God to All Nations now watch Satan's
[11:42] duty is to pervert the word of God to
[11:45] wisdom's
[11:46] reasoning oh my oh then he marks his
[11:50] subjects by rejecting the original
[11:56] word will you will will you suffer me
[11:58] just a little bit before we get this
[12:00] listen I don't want you to miss this let
[12:01] me show you the type so you can see it
[12:03] all in typing and word and everything
[12:05] you can't you shouldn't go away confused
[12:08] in the Old Testament when a man have
[12:11] been sold to slavery there come a Year
[12:14] of Jubilee every 50 years 49th year then
[12:17] year Jubilee and when a slave heard this
[12:21] and he wanted to go free there's there
[12:23] isn't nothing that can keep him from
[12:25] going free he can throw down his hole
[12:27] and say so long
[12:29] go back home amen the trumpet sounded
[12:32] that's right but if he don't want to go
[12:35] and he's
[12:36] satisfied with his slave master then
[12:39] he's taken into the uh the temple and
[12:43] they're Tak an all you know what an all
[12:46] is and they press his ear and put a hole
[12:49] in his ear and it's a Mark that he can
[12:54] never go back
[12:57] amen is that that right he has to serve
[13:01] this master for all time I don't care
[13:05] how many more times a jubilee sounds
[13:07] whatever happens he's absolutely has has
[13:11] sold out his birth rights of being
[13:14] free and when a man turns down the
[13:19] gospel
[13:21] truth Satan marks him am where at his
[13:26] ear amen he deafens him so he can't hear
[13:29] the truth no
[13:31] more and he's
[13:33] finished he stays with the group that
[13:36] he's with if you w hear the truth that's
[13:39] right no you shall know the truth and
[13:41] the truth shall make you free the truth
[13:44] makes free God marks his when they come
[13:48] God marks his by vindicating his
[13:50] promised word through them exactly St
[13:54] John uh 14:12 and another thing you
[13:57] going to put Mark 16
[13:59] 16 Jesus said these signs shall follow
[14:03] them that believe now let's just take
[14:06] that a minute was he
[14:09] joking did he just mean U did he just
[14:12] mean the apostles some would tell
[14:14] us watch read the background of It Go ye
[14:19] into where all the world preach the this
[14:22] gospel to what every creature it has not
[14:27] even one third of the way it
[14:31] yet these signs shall follow in all the
[14:35] world to Every Creature wherever this
[14:36] gospels
[14:38] preached these signs shall follow them
[14:40] that believe not just a one little
[14:43] handful like a fellow one time tell me
[14:46] God only give the 12 apostles Gifts of
[14:48] healing
[14:50] and many of the brother sitting here
[14:52] when he raised up to say that
[14:56] see you got enough up in a few minutes
[14:59] so now notice all the world that every
[15:03] creature these signs shall follow don't
[15:07] take Satan's unbelieving
[15:10] Mark now he'll put it on you tonight if
[15:13] you he do
[15:14] it you poke you up against the wall and
[15:16] you walk kind and say I don't know about
[15:19] that you go home and study it and then
[15:23] be sincere and
[15:26] pray because everything too it's too
[15:30] perfectly scriptural at this very hour
[15:32] this sacred hour time it's done been for
[15:36] years prove come right up to it and this
[15:38] is the hour this is the time
[15:42] right and now don't let him poke that in
[15:45] your ear his unbelieving Mark see
[15:48] because he was an unbeliever to begin
[15:50] with he doubted it all right oh don't
[15:54] even let don't let him take the
[15:55] scripture with his wisdom and and twist
[15:59] it and pervert it with his own wisdom
[16:01] into reasoning Powers you just be humble
[16:04] and say God said so and that's
[16:07] all now oh let's we're going to get too
[16:10] late so we better stop right here and
[16:12] start on now let's go with the second
[16:16] seal when the
[16:18] slain risen lamb opened it and the
[16:23] second uh ta like Beast said come see
[16:29] what the seal mystery
[16:34] is now we get it the lamb you remember
[16:37] has to open every
[16:39] seal and the second beast if you notice
[16:43] in the routine of where we just went
[16:44] through at the church stages the same
[16:45] name the second first was a line the
[16:48] next was a was a was like a calf or ox
[16:51] or something you see and this Beast said
[16:55] come
[16:56] see now and and when the lamb opened the
[16:59] seal and then uh went to see and when he
[17:04] walked in what happened let's see what
[17:06] he found come see there's a mystery
[17:08] sealed up here that's been here now for
[17:11] 2,000 years about let's see what it is
[17:15] now we find here that he saw what a red
[17:21] horse go
[17:23] forward now to my understanding this to
[17:27] my understanding
[17:29] this great sword that he had in his hand
[17:33] now we got about three things to look at
[17:35] now for about the next 15 20
[17:37] minutes let's just read and see what he
[17:39] says
[17:42] here and there went out the fourth verse
[17:45] there went out another
[17:48] horse that was red the first and his
[17:51] white and power was given unto him that
[17:54] sat there on to take peace from the
[17:57] earth and they should kill one another
[18:00] and there was given
[18:02] him a great
[18:06] sword now there's symbols here and we
[18:11] want to look at them real
[18:14] close but to my understanding the best
[18:17] that I know now you see Jesus predicted
[18:21] the same thing in Matthew 24 amen see he
[18:25] said now you go to year of wars and
[18:27] rumors of Wars and this wars and rumors
[18:30] of wars and wars and but said all these
[18:32] ain't yet time ain't yet see they asked
[18:36] Jesus three questions see and he
[18:40] answered him in three questions that's
[18:42] where lot of our brethen got tangled up
[18:44] trying to place um the Adventist Breen
[18:47] about those sth day and so forth back
[18:49] there to war to her to give child give
[18:52] something the gates will be closed on
[18:53] the Sabbath day and things like that
[18:56] my it don't even pertain to the question
[18:58] at all not at all he answering what they
[19:02] asked but he didn't he didn't uh it
[19:06] didn't apply at all to the last days he
[19:08] said you'll here now we're working on
[19:10] this one thing here we'll come to some
[19:12] more of it in a few nights look he said
[19:14] you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars
[19:18] and so forth now all this is not see
[19:20] that go back again and they'll deliver
[19:23] you up and so forth like this oh that's
[19:25] not right yet but when he got to the
[19:27] time when go talk to him about what they
[19:30] asked him about the end of the world
[19:32] when will all these things be when there
[19:33] about be one stone left up on what will
[19:36] the sign being when will be coming to
[19:37] the end of the world see they ask him
[19:39] three things then when he got down to
[19:41] the end of the world he said when you
[19:43] see the Fig Tree putting forth his
[19:46] F now you know all that the time is at
[19:49] the door and B I say to you that this
[19:53] generation shall not pass until all be
[19:57] fulfilled how the Infidel without the
[19:59] interpretation likes to lay on to that
[20:01] see he said this generation not the
[20:03] generation is's talking to the
[20:04] generation that's seen the Fig Tree
[20:06] putting forth

[46:54] church amen let me p pull that
[46:57] up she
[46:59] said greetings from Ecuador we've had an
[47:03] amazing trip I just wanted to share a
[47:05] testimony praise report it was so scary
[47:08] I still have trouble talking about it
[47:10] but really want to thank you all for
[47:12] your prayers for us during this trip
[47:14] they've made all the difference the long
[47:16] story short the kids got caught in a
[47:18] strong rip tide in the ocean on our last
[47:21] day in the galpagos after the fact the
[47:24] lady at the Boogie Board Shop and other
[47:26] locals told us that that beach has a
[47:28] really strong current and those waves
[47:30] are only for professionals on top of
[47:32] that it was an extra rough day on the
[47:34] water with no signage it is a third
[47:36] world country no life jackets on that no
[47:40] life jackets on there's another story
[47:42] with that three kids swept out into the
[47:44] ocean in waves as high as a house it was
[47:47] a nightmare I've never prayed so hard in
[47:50] my life someone called 911 a helicopter
[47:53] and a boat showed up but only then and
[47:57] by then the only two Surfers out there
[47:59] had seen that these were in trouble and
[48:01] came over to help it took a really long
[48:03] time to get them into the shore but
[48:06] Lucas actually lost his boogie board and
[48:08] at one point and somehow swam over to
[48:10] saa's board and hung on which is a
[48:12] miracle in itself for he can barely swim
[48:16] as you can imagine there's not much
[48:17] worse to witness as a parent I'm just
[48:20] praising the Lord and I'm here to say
[48:22] our God is real and an everpresent help
[48:24] in a time of trouble I called on him he
[48:27] answered and I know the prayers at
[48:29] Shalom made the difference thank you all
[48:32] for your prayers again and God bless you
[48:34] amen so we just want to thank the Lord
[48:36] for the miracle he done there and I
[48:38] think um she I don't know if he just

[1:04:24] word we ask you to stand I have a place
[1:04:28] in the scripture found
[1:04:31] in uh Mark
[1:04:35] 11:22 and it's a very powerful scripture
[1:04:38] we all know it by
[1:04:40] heart or at least we can remember
[1:04:43] remember very familiar with it I should
[1:04:47] say these are the words of our Lord
[1:04:50] Jesus and um in verse
[1:04:54] number
[1:04:57] 22 actually let me
[1:05:04] see Mark
[1:05:06] 11 vers
[1:05:10] 2223
[1:05:12] and
[1:05:16] 24 25 and 26 let's read that all
[1:05:19] together actually starting verse
[1:05:21] 22 and we'll go to verse 2
[1:05:24] 6 Mark 11 verse 22 Al together and Jesus
[1:05:30] answering saith unto them have faith in
[1:05:34] God for verily I say unto you that
[1:05:37] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:05:40] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:05:43] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:05:47] but Shall Believe those things which he
[1:05:49] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[1:05:53] whato ever he saith therefore I say unto
[1:05:57] you what things soever ye desire When
[1:06:01] you pray believe that you receive them
[1:06:04] and ye shall have them and when you
[1:06:07] stand praying forgive if you have ought
[1:06:10] against any that your father also which
[1:06:13] is in heaven forgive your
[1:06:17] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:06:20] neither will your father which is in
[1:06:22] heaven forgive your your trespasses amen
[1:06:27] amen you know what really we can just we
[1:06:30] can really go home if we internalize
[1:06:33] that those words if we internalize those
[1:06:36] words we can just go home with our hands
[1:06:38] lifted up and say Lord please help me
[1:06:42] amen amen amen and
[1:06:46] um just as another witness in scripture
[1:06:49] we'll find it in Proverbs Chapter 20
[1:06:52] Proverbs chapter 18 excuse
[1:07:01] me of course we want to remember the
[1:07:04] ones that are missing brother George and
[1:07:06] sister Brandy they're
[1:07:08] traveling and uh we pray the Lord would
[1:07:11] bring them back
[1:07:13] safely and uh the work that they're
[1:07:16] doing to help the body of Christ
[1:07:19] wherever they are and also the Saints in
[1:07:21] Phoenix there were Brother Art brother
[1:07:23] Steve
[1:07:25] and those Saints there we pray the Lord
[1:07:27] will bless them richly Proverbs
[1:07:41] 18 in
[1:07:45] verse let's see
[1:07:49] here number
[1:07:52] 21
[1:07:58] when you have that say amen amen death
[1:08:01] and life are in the power of the tongue
[1:08:04] amen and they that love it shall eat the
[1:08:08] fruit thereof you know the scripture is
[1:08:10] interesting it doesn't say death and
[1:08:13] life are in the power of God or power of
[1:08:17] Satan he's bringing this principle death
[1:08:21] and life are in the power of the tongue
[1:08:24] and they that love it shall eat the
[1:08:27] fruit thereof let us pray Lord Jesus we
[1:08:31] ask your blessings on this service this
[1:08:33] morning you bless your people we pray
[1:08:36] and we ask in Jesus name amen amen the
[1:08:40] title of the message this morning kind
[1:08:41] of deviating from what we've been on uh
[1:08:45] and talking about the end time and the
[1:08:48] closing days of the Gentiles and what
[1:08:50] we're to see the sign to take place and
[1:08:53] we we see the door closing and we see
[1:08:56] that these things are supposed to take
[1:08:57] place now and we know what we how to
[1:09:01] stand and what we're looking for but we
[1:09:04] move we're going to move into this
[1:09:06] little message here this morning and the
[1:09:07] title is we win by our
[1:09:10] confession we win by our confession and
[1:09:14] so we pray that the Lord will bless you
[1:09:16] God bless you you may be seated our
[1:09:20] confession or our profession are the
[1:09:23] words that come out of our
[1:09:25] mouth and as a
[1:09:30] sinner when they transition from being a
[1:09:33] sinner to becoming a
[1:09:36] saint there has to be a confession
[1:09:39] that's made corre and that confession
[1:09:42] speaks as to what's going on in their
[1:09:44] heart then they have to speak it out
[1:09:48] with their lips with their mouth amen
[1:09:50] and this is very very important this is
[1:09:53] part part of our experience I want to
[1:09:57] read just a sinner's prayer what we
[1:10:00] would call a sinner's prayer this is in
[1:10:03] the a message life story 1952 just to
[1:10:07] give you just what it entails what it um
[1:10:13] you know there's a confession there's
[1:10:14] coming to a
[1:10:17] recognition you you are here but you're
[1:10:20] now confessing that you want to be over
[1:10:22] here and you're talking to someone these
[1:10:26] are not just words out in the open
[1:10:28] you're talking to someone that actually
[1:10:30] hears what you're saying right and the
[1:10:33] principles of what you're saying he's
[1:10:35] going to catch that and then act upon
[1:10:38] what you are saying to him and so when
[1:10:41] the center this starts this is our very
[1:10:44] starting point of making any
[1:10:46] acknowledgement to God or coming to God
[1:10:49] in any kind of way it starts with a
[1:10:52] confession
[1:10:54] speaking from your mouth to him and this
[1:10:58] is very very
[1:11:01] important this will uh take you all the
[1:11:05] way through your Christian Journey this
[1:11:09] will be the determining Factor on many
[1:11:12] blessings that you will receive and not
[1:11:15] receive this will determine what level
[1:11:19] that you'll live on live at and the
[1:11:23] attitude and the framework that you walk
[1:11:25] in and work in and the atmosphere around
[1:11:28] you it's determined by this a simple
[1:11:32] little principle simple just words you
[1:11:35] say it's just words is it is just words

[1:16:24] few words Saints to God take that sinner
[1:16:29] through a sinner's prayer and make them
[1:16:32] into a saint just a few words
[1:16:36] now this this
[1:16:39] is so beautiful because we can go back
[1:16:44] and hear the words of Jesus Through the
[1:16:46] written
[1:16:47] word and the purpose that it was written
[1:16:51] down was that so that you can come and
[1:16:56] repeat what was written down so words
[1:16:59] are written down anything that's written
[1:17:01] down it's written down so that it can be
[1:17:04] read right that's the purpose that is
[1:17:07] written down it's amazing how we'll come
[1:17:09] into service and we'll think that
[1:17:12] everything going on in the service
[1:17:14] you'll
[1:17:15] remember but you're not going to
[1:17:17] remember I I preach a sermon I don't
[1:17:19] remember everything I said how you going
[1:17:22] to remember everything I
[1:17:24] said it's amazing you come and you'll
[1:17:26] listen to the word you listen to the
[1:17:28] tape and somehow you think your
[1:17:30] beautiful lovely mind as it is is going
[1:17:33] to catch everything retain everything
[1:17:36] and keep everything fresh in your spirit
[1:17:39] and you know that the service was good
[1:17:42] and you know that the presence of the
[1:17:44] Lord was there and you know God was
[1:17:46] speaking to you but yet you won't record
[1:17:50] it you won't write it down
[1:17:53] to rehearse it again I'm here to remind
[1:17:57] you if it's that good write it down in
[1:18:00] your whatever you write it down on and
[1:18:04] read it again in the quietness of your
[1:18:08] home and it might make you say Amen
[1:18:11] again amen it might bless you again but
[1:18:15] this is this is why it is recorded I'm
[1:18:19] going to go through a few scriptures
[1:18:21] here just for a moment
[1:18:23] where the Lord is commanding that the
[1:18:25] Ten Commandments be written down he put
[1:18:29] them in stone he commanded that certain
[1:18:33] curses and Promises write them down so
[1:18:36] they can be rehearsed again and this
[1:18:39] this is what our Bible is it's the
[1:18:41] written accounts of the words of the
[1:18:43] Lord and it's written down so that it
[1:18:45] can be rehearsed again or so that it can
[1:18:48] be read again all right Exodus 17 ver10
[1:18:54] 16 says so Joshua did as Moses had said
[1:18:57] to him yeah fought with amch and Moses
[1:19:00] Aaron and her went up to the top of the
[1:19:03] hill and it came to pass when Moses held
[1:19:06] up his hand that Israel
[1:19:10] prevailed and when we let down his hand
[1:19:13] amch prevailed but Moses's hands were
[1:19:16] heavy yeah and they took a stone and put
[1:19:19] it under him and he sat thereon and
[1:19:22] Aaron and her stayed up his hands the
[1:19:27] one on one side and the other on the
[1:19:29] other side and his hands were steady
[1:19:32] until the going down of the Sun and
[1:19:34] Joshua discomforted amalik and of his
[1:19:38] people with the edge of The Sword and
[1:19:40] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[1:19:44] a memorial in a book and do what and
[1:19:48] rehearse it in the ears of Joshua amen
[1:19:52] for I will utterly put out the
[1:19:55] remembrance of amch from under the
[1:19:57] Heaven from under heaven and Moses built
[1:20:00] an altar called the name of it Jehovah
[1:20:02] nii for he said because the Lord has
[1:20:04] sworn that the Lord will have war with
[1:20:07] AMC from generation to generation so the
[1:20:10] Lord wanted this recorded in a book of
[1:20:16] memory it's written down so that it can
[1:20:19] be read again exactly and when it's read
[1:20:22] read again it brings back your memory
[1:20:26] what took place this is the evidence
[1:20:29] because it's written down it's recorded
[1:20:31] and that's the value of it it's not
[1:20:33] going off I kind of remember I kind of
[1:20:36] remember grandma and them said or
[1:20:38] Grandpa and them said I kind of think I
[1:20:41] kind of remember no this gets rid of all
[1:20:43] of that the personal eyewitness
[1:20:46] testimonies are great but when you have
[1:20:49] a written record of what taking place
[1:20:52] place you yourself the reader can see
[1:20:56] exactly what happened amen amen amen
[1:20:59] Exodus
[1:21:00] 34:1 and the Lord said unto Moses heue
[1:21:04] the two
[1:21:06] tables out of stone like under the first
[1:21:09] and I will write upon these tables the
[1:21:11] words that were in the first tables
[1:21:14] which thou
[1:21:17] breakast verse 27 and the Lord said unto
[1:21:20] Moses write thou these words for after
[1:21:23] the tenor of these words I have made a
[1:21:26] covenant with thee and with Israel so
[1:21:31] the written word now brings the reader
[1:21:35] into the presence of what was said
[1:21:38] exactly now all of Israel didn't have to
[1:21:41] be on the mountain all of Israel didn't
[1:21:44] see every detail that Moses saw but
[1:21:47] Israel knows what God said because Moses
[1:21:51] wrote it down and in writing it down it
[1:21:54] keeps The Word Alive to the
[1:21:58] reader amen this is how it comes alive
[1:22:02] again a closed book ain't saying nothing
[1:22:06] but when you open the book and read it
[1:22:08] then the book begins to speak and the
[1:22:11] promises begin to speak once you read
[1:22:15] them again this is the blessing that
[1:22:17] comes with reading the word meditating
[1:22:20] up on the word and then speaking the
[1:22:24] word amen there's a blessing that comes
[1:22:27] with it amen the scripture tells us that
[1:22:31] death and life lays in the power of the
[1:22:37] tongue amen and this command is not
[1:22:41] something that we just learn by ourself
[1:22:44] these are the this is what the Lord did
[1:22:46] himself in the beginning he says Let
[1:22:49] There Be yes he did he spoke it out
[1:22:53] over and over and over and showing how
[1:22:58] creation happened how things came into
[1:23:00] existence through the spoken word so
[1:23:04] these recordings are on record so that
[1:23:08] we don't have to take somebody's memory
[1:23:12] or faulty you know somebody's version of
[1:23:15] it you know I was when we went back East
[1:23:19] Sharon and I we we went through the one
[1:23:22] of the Bible Tums there of the different
[1:23:24] Bibles and one of the uh they had a
[1:23:28] Bible they call it a slave Bible and
[1:23:32] this Bible they had to scratch out parts
[1:23:35] that talked about their freedom because
[1:23:37] they didn't want the people to read that
[1:23:39] what the B what the good book said about
[1:23:41] them and so that's what the enemy will
[1:23:44] do read part of it read half of it read
[1:23:48] you know that part from way back when
[1:23:50] don't read about the stuff for today
[1:23:52] don't read about the stuff that has to
[1:23:54] deal with you because if you read it and
[1:23:56] then you begin to meditate on that and
[1:23:58] begin to speak it something's got to
[1:24:01] happen something will happen amen amen
[1:24:04] so we don't want to stay ignorant do
[1:24:06] we it's recorded for that reason
[1:24:09] Deuteronomy 7: 18 and 20 and it shall be
[1:24:14] when he sth upon the throne of his
[1:24:16] kingdom that he should write him a copy
[1:24:18] of this law in the book out of that
[1:24:21] which is before the priest of
[1:24:24] Levites and it shall be with him and he
[1:24:27] shall read therein all the days of his
[1:24:31] life that he may learn to fear the lord
[1:24:34] his God to keep all the words of this
[1:24:38] law and these statutes to do them that
[1:24:41] his heart be not lifted up above his
[1:24:44] Brethren that he turn not aside from the
[1:24:47] Commandment to the right hand or to the
[1:24:50] left hand to to the left to to the end
[1:24:53] that he may prolong his days in his
[1:24:56] kingdom he and his children in the midst
[1:25:01] of Israel so the Lord is talking about
[1:25:04] when they come into the land and God
[1:25:06] establishes kings that these Kings need
[1:25:10] to keep the law a copy of the law of the
[1:25:14] book from the priests from through the
[1:25:18] Levites and it shall be with him that
[1:25:21] you read it day and night and in reading
[1:25:26] this it'll keep your heart from getting
[1:25:28] lifted up above others in reading this
[1:25:31] you'll recognize who you are and who God
[1:25:35] is and it keeps the words of the Lord
[1:25:39] alive you know the tape comes alive not
[1:25:43] on the Shelf it comes alive not sitting
[1:25:46] in the player it comes alive when you
[1:25:49] play it and as you play it the the words
[1:25:53] come across you hear it and now you can
[1:25:56] have faith yes amen amen somebody amen
[1:26:01] Jeremiah or uh Deuteronomy
[1:26:04] 27 1-8 and Moses with the Elders of
[1:26:07] Israel commanded the people saying keep
[1:26:10] all the Commandments I which I command
[1:26:12] you this day and it shall be on the day
[1:26:16] when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the
[1:26:18] land which the Lord thy God giveth thee
[1:26:21] that thou Shall Set thee up great
[1:26:25] stones and plaster them with
[1:26:28] plaster and thou shall write upon them
[1:26:31] all the words of this law when thou are
[1:26:35] passed over that thou mayest go in unto
[1:26:38] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[1:26:40] thee a land that floweth with milk and
[1:26:43] honey as the Lord God of thy fathers has
[1:26:47] promised thee therefore it shall be when
[1:26:50] ye be gone over Jordan that ye shall set
[1:26:53] up these Stones yes amen which I
[1:26:56] commanded you this day in the mount ebal
[1:26:59] and thou sh plaster them with plaster
[1:27:02] and there shalt thou build an altar unto
[1:27:05] the Lord thy God and and an altar of
[1:27:08] stones Thou shalt not lift up any iron
[1:27:10] tool upon them Thou shalt build the
[1:27:13] altar of the Lord thy God of whole
[1:27:15] stones and thou shalt offer burnt
[1:27:17] offerings therein unto the Lord thy God
[1:27:21] so he's telling them to take the law
[1:27:25] now take these stones and build them up
[1:27:29] and plaster them and on the plaster
[1:27:32] write the laws as you enter into the
[1:27:35] land make it erected very high so that
[1:27:39] the people can read this can see
[1:27:44] this
[1:27:45] um the people that sell whatever they
[1:27:48] sell they know the power of a beautiful
[1:27:53] advertisement McDonald's knows this uh
[1:27:56] all whatever place you shop they plaster
[1:28:00] these Billboards they take every space
[1:28:02] any space they can to put their name up
[1:28:06] there or picture of what they're trying
[1:28:07] to sell up there so that you can see it
[1:28:11] we all know what the menu is at
[1:28:14] McDonald's we all heard of McDonald's
[1:28:17] how many hasn't heard of
[1:28:19] McDonald's but man they sure don't stop
[1:28:22] advertising do they because they remind
[1:28:25] you that you need a Big Mac they remind
[1:28:29] you that you need a number three or a
[1:28:31] number seven I think is two double
[1:28:33] cheeseburgers there's only two you know
[1:28:35] the number one and number two that's
[1:28:37] where I go and you know you get into
[1:28:39] that before that menu you act like you
[1:28:42] ain't never been there before like what
[1:28:43] do I want you know what you want stop
[1:28:47] playing we all know what you want cuz
[1:28:50] you get the same thing every time
[1:28:53] you drove up here because you already
[1:28:55] knew what you
[1:28:57] wanted I want not Burger King I don't
[1:28:59] want I want a B I want a big back so I
[1:29:01] go to
[1:29:02] McDonald's and just go get it but when
[1:29:05] you get there you start they start
[1:29:06] flashing these other thing here this is
[1:29:08] UN special that's maybe I want that
[1:29:10] maybe well that's not why you came you
[1:29:12] came because they
[1:29:14] advertised yeah and they kept it fresh
[1:29:17] in your mind hey we're still here and
[1:29:20] the Lord is advertising in the laws of
[1:29:24] Moses before the children of Israel for
[1:29:28] the old Elders that were there and for
[1:29:31] the youngers and then for the little
[1:29:32] Bitties the little Bitties would raise
[1:29:36] up from their cradle all the way up
[1:29:39] seeing the laws we can't read yet but
[1:29:43] when I can read I'll know what it says
[1:29:46] amen oh my amen Lord help me this
[1:29:50] morning to deliver this message with all
[1:29:53] of my heart you know in
[1:29:57] reading that ability to read we first
[1:30:00] learn how to
[1:30:02] hear and we learn how to hear and to
[1:30:05] speak before we learn how to
[1:30:07] read but the the the the the readings
[1:30:10] the things that we read are written down
[1:30:13] for that purpose for it to be read it
[1:30:15] might be a secret you want somebody else
[1:30:17] to read it it might be for only certain
[1:30:19] eyes but it's written down for somebody
[1:30:22] to read it again it might be just for
[1:30:24] you to read it again right am remind
[1:30:27] yourself what you're going through or
[1:30:30] remind yourself of these important
[1:30:32] truths and these points so you can go
[1:30:35] and meditate on them again and this what
[1:30:37] it's written down for us so it can be
[1:30:39] read again but this ability to read
[1:30:43] takes some
[1:30:45] skill you someone has to teach you how
[1:30:48] to read amen and so our speech
[1:30:52] and our hearing is developed first and
[1:30:56] that's how we are taught to read many
[1:30:58] times as we're repeating what someone
[1:31:01] else is telling us that word means see
[1:31:03] that word there th sound it out and then
[1:31:06] the the child or the the the student
[1:31:08] hears it they hear it in their ear and
[1:31:12] then they have to repeat it properly the
[1:31:15] way the teacher is trying to teach them
[1:31:18] now the written portion of the ability
[1:31:21] the read the ability to read is great
[1:31:25] and I mean it can be can't be over uh
[1:31:29] emphasize the beauty of being
[1:31:32] literate oh the power that's released
[1:31:35] when you can read it what the laws say
[1:31:39] and what what your rights are and what
[1:31:44] you know what was written about you it's
[1:31:48] beautiful when you come into that
[1:31:50] knowledge of being able to read and then
[1:31:53] when you read it it now comes alive to
[1:31:57] you am amen amen it now means something
[1:32:01] because you can read it you know maybe
[1:32:04] you heard somebody else say it and maybe
[1:32:07] you heard rumors about it but when the
[1:32:10] document comes into your hands and it on
[1:32:14] your desk and it's in your study now
[1:32:18] when you read it it becomes yours now
[1:32:22] God and when it becomes yours you quote
[1:32:25] it like it's yours you Proclaim it you
[1:32:29] declare it you believe it like it's
[1:32:32] yours then it's really alive now amen
[1:32:36] can I get a witness here this this
[1:32:38] morning amen amen this is the power of
[1:32:41] taking your Bible whether you understand
[1:32:44] it all or not start somewhere and just
[1:32:48] read it read it when you don't
[1:32:51] understand read it when you can't
[1:32:53] pronounce it just read it because in
[1:32:57] reading it you'll learn to
[1:33:00] develop the voice of the book and what
[1:33:03] is saying what is telling you and when
[1:33:06] you learn how to read it you it you you
[1:33:09] you uh internalize it in a way like
[1:33:13] nobody else quoting it to you can that's
[1:33:16] why you get your own book your own Bible
[1:33:20] your own study time and read
[1:33:23] it and in reading it it comes alive to
[1:33:28] you
[1:33:29] it amen let's go a little bit further
[1:33:33] glory to God Ezekiel 43 Jeremiah 36
[1:33:36] rather and it came to pass in the fourth
[1:33:38] year of jeim the son of Josiah king of
[1:33:43] Judah that this word came unto Jeremiah
[1:33:46] from the
[1:33:47] Lord
[1:33:49] saying take thee a ro
[1:33:52] of a book and write therein all the
[1:33:56] words that I have spoken unto thee
[1:33:59] against Israel against Judah and against
[1:34:02] all the nations from the day I spake
[1:34:05] unto thee from the day of Josiah even
[1:34:08] unto this day it may be that the house
[1:34:10] of Judah will hear all the evil which I
[1:34:14] purpos to do unto them that they may
[1:34:16] return every man from his evil way that
[1:34:20] I may forgive their iniquity and their
[1:34:24] sin then Jeremiah called baric the son
[1:34:29] of n baric wrote from the mouth of
[1:34:32] Jeremiah all the words of the
[1:34:36] Lord amen can you say praise the Lord he
[1:34:39] wrote it why' he write it God told him
[1:34:44] to what was the purpose in writing it so
[1:34:47] that so that maybe somebody might read
[1:34:51] it and then they might
[1:34:53] repent uh-huh amen and this is this is
[1:34:59] one of the reasons why it's written
[1:35:01] down so that it can tell you how to
[1:35:05] behave and how your future may go and
[1:35:08] how you know you can prepare yourself
[1:35:11] it's written down so that you can have
[1:35:14] the evidence in the proof so when it
[1:35:17] comes to pass you can see oh that was
[1:35:19] written over there it's written down so
[1:35:23] it can be re
[1:35:25] rehearsed to
[1:35:27] somebody maybe it's not to this one or
[1:35:29] that one but it's written for
[1:35:32] somebody everybody don't take it the
[1:35:34] same way when Jesus said come unto me
[1:35:37] all ye that labor and heavy laden I'll
[1:35:40] give you rest he was talking to somebody
[1:35:43] I'm glad they recorded it somewhere cuz
[1:35:46] when I reread it he was talking to me he
[1:35:50] was talking to to you but everybody
[1:35:53] can't read it that way they don't hear
[1:35:55] it that way but it has to be
[1:35:57] reread over and over and over again
[1:36:01] glory to God and then that makes the
[1:36:02] book come alive yes it does now yes it
[1:36:06] does this these few little points in
[1:36:11] Matthew or Mark chap 11 if you take your
[1:36:14] Bible there just for a
[1:36:15] moment Jesus said in verse 22 first
[1:36:20] thing he says
[1:36:22] is have faith in God we all ready
[1:36:26] together didn't we yes he says to have
[1:36:29] faith in God that's to believe in God
[1:36:32] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:36:35] him and in coming to him he is now
[1:36:39] talking to the Believers and he lays out
[1:36:42] these five four or five things to have
[1:36:45] faith in
[1:36:46] God the second thing he says is to say
[1:36:50] or to
[1:36:52] speak what you have need of the third
[1:36:57] thing he says is Not To Doubt in your
[1:36:59] heart what you said so first is have
[1:37:03] faith in God have faith in God and then
[1:37:07] say say what you what what's the
[1:37:10] scripture
[1:37:12] say take
[1:37:14] me verily I say unto you that whosoever
[1:37:17] shall say unto this mountain so first
[1:37:21] have faith in God then say to the
[1:37:25] mountain say to the circumstance or the
[1:37:29] situation say to the piece of
[1:37:32] dirt say to the grain say to several
[1:37:36] grains say it to the
[1:37:39] mountain and then don't be don't doubt
[1:37:42] in your heart what you
[1:37:43] said and then forth he says believe what
[1:37:47] you said amen okay and he he shall
[1:37:53] what he shall have what he
[1:37:56] said this is what our lord Jesus has
[1:37:59] laid out to them now this
[1:38:04] speaking is um is based on our motives
[1:38:10] and
[1:38:12] objectives number one is also based on
[1:38:15] God's perfect
[1:38:17] will it's not going to override his word
[1:38:20] his word is here and you and and you
[1:38:24] could take this principle and and you
[1:38:26] stand on it you have faith in God you
[1:38:29] say to the mountain don't doubt what you
[1:38:32] said then believe what you said and you
[1:38:36] shall have what you
[1:38:38] said you know it's all based on what you
[1:38:41] said what did you
[1:38:43] say and and um the scripture in Proverbs
[1:38:48] tells us that death
[1:38:51] and life am lay in the power of the
[1:38:55] tongue am you know we take this because
[1:38:57] the are these are the words of Jesus and
[1:39:00] this is a positive
[1:39:02] confirmation on claiming what God has
[1:39:05] given you yes amen and I want all of you
[1:39:08] young people and middleaged and old
[1:39:10] whoever you are to remember this that
[1:39:13] you know your positive testimony is so
[1:39:17] important yes it is your positive
[1:39:20] outlook is so important even even if
[1:39:24] it's dark even if you're going to
[1:39:26] surgery even if they don't have an
[1:39:28] answer to your problem and you going to
[1:39:30] the hospital it's better it make you
[1:39:34] feel better your whole atmosphere is
[1:39:36] better if you're positive if you're
[1:39:39] thinking in your mind that you know it's
[1:39:41] never happened before but my life is in
[1:39:43] God's hands Lord I believe all things
[1:39:46] were well you knew I would come here I
[1:39:48] don't desire this pain but I know you're
[1:39:51] my life is in your hands and I'm laying
[1:39:53] it all to you that's so much better
[1:39:56] Hallelujah than reading all the negative
[1:40:00] testimonies of those who died and it
[1:40:02] didn't work for that one and that one
[1:40:04] didn't didn't work it's so much better
[1:40:06] to stay with the
[1:40:09] Positive amen amen what if I came in
[1:40:12] here I thought
[1:40:13] everybody uh didn't like
[1:40:16] me huh yeah of course that's not true I
[1:40:19] know everybody loves me
[1:40:22] uh everybody who love me let me see your
[1:40:24] hand Hallelujah all right I didn't see
[1:40:27] them all but I know it's in
[1:40:31] there what if I came in here thinking
[1:40:33] that nobody loved me huh I walk through
[1:40:37] the door nobody loves me there nobody
[1:40:41] loves me even the ones that say they do
[1:40:44] they don't mean it yeah they just
[1:40:46] playing they don't nobody loves me you
[1:40:48] what what kind of atmosphere are you
[1:40:50] going to have have on you what kind of
[1:40:53] atmosphere does God have to override to
[1:40:55] even speak to
[1:40:57] you what difference does it make who
[1:41:01] likes you and who don't like you God
[1:41:04] wants to speak to you so but the enemy
[1:41:07] gets our atmosphere all messed up on who
[1:41:11] likes us and who doesn't like us so it's
[1:41:13] always better to error if you're going
[1:41:15] to error on the side of the positive
[1:41:18] don't you say Amen just believe that
[1:41:21] everybody loves you believe that
[1:41:24] everybody is on your
[1:41:27] team on your
[1:41:30] side rooting for you amen everybody is
[1:41:34] not worried about how long you're going
[1:41:36] to
[1:41:38] preach well I need to believe that
[1:41:42] that's right come on now I had to slide
[1:41:45] that in there I have to believe that
[1:41:48] everybody would stay here for 3
[1:41:52] hours and never get up and leave right
[1:41:57] so this positive thinking is is that
[1:42:00] that's what God desires for us but let's
[1:42:03] flip that over to the negative side if
[1:42:06] if you believe the
[1:42:08] negative if you talk the
[1:42:11] negative if you don't doubt that the
[1:42:13] negative is not going to happen guess
[1:42:16] what you going to
[1:42:17] get it works both ways MH it works both
[1:42:24] ways you believe negative you hear
[1:42:27] negative you don't doubt that it's it's
[1:42:29] true this negative negative negative and
[1:42:32] what are you going to get you're going
[1:42:34] to get exactly what you expected exactly
[1:42:37] what you believe exactly what came out
[1:42:39] of your mouth that's what it's going to
[1:42:41] be negative negative negative because
[1:42:45] God operates on the principles of
[1:42:48] planting a seed and when you plant a
[1:42:51] seed he'll make that seed grow yes he
[1:42:55] does good seeds are bad seeds yes he
[1:42:58] does so these are the principles that
[1:42:59] God gives to us
[1:43:02] amen all
[1:43:03] right so it's written down in the
[1:43:07] book you know I like this in Luke
[1:43:10] Chapter let's take Hava chapter 2 verse
[1:43:14] number 2 to three says and the Lord
[1:43:17] answered me and said write the vision
[1:43:21] make it plain upon tables that he may
[1:43:25] run that read it for the vision is yet
[1:43:30] for an appointed time but at the end it
[1:43:33] shall speak and not lie though it t wait
[1:43:37] for it because it will surely come it
[1:43:41] will not tar can you say amen amen read
[1:43:44] that one more time and the Lord answered
[1:43:45] me and said write the vision make it
[1:43:47] plain upon the tables that he may run
[1:43:50] that what read if he reads it he'll run
[1:43:55] yes amen he'll run with what he'll run
[1:43:58] with what was written down right amen
[1:44:02] that's why it's written down so it can
[1:44:04] be read and then you read it it takes on
[1:44:09] life Luke 1 1-4 here's an eyewitness
[1:44:14] Luke scholarly uh the physician he's
[1:44:18] called in verse one it says for as much
[1:44:21] as many have taken in hand to set forth
[1:44:24] in order a declaration of those things
[1:44:26] which are most surely believed among us
[1:44:29] even as they delivered them unto us
[1:44:32] which from the beginning were
[1:44:34] eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word
[1:44:37] it seemed good to me also having had
[1:44:41] perfect understanding of all things from
[1:44:45] the very first to write unto thee in
[1:44:49] order amen most excellent
[1:44:52] theopus that thou mest know the
[1:44:55] certainty of those things wherein thou H
[1:44:59] has been instructed so Luke was an
[1:45:02] eyewitness others were eyewitnesses and
[1:45:05] they talked about what they witness but
[1:45:07] here Luke says I thought I need to put
[1:45:09] it on record myself and put it in order
[1:45:14] so that you can read it and know for
[1:45:18] surely that it came to pass amen it's
[1:45:21] not enough just
[1:45:24] to remember it by memory but it's so
[1:45:28] nice to take the words of the Lord and
[1:45:31] then have those words recorded amen
[1:45:35] write it
[1:45:37] down that's why it's written down is so
[1:45:40] that it can be read and then after it's
[1:45:43] read it's meant to be spoken yes amen
[1:45:47] and this speech comes from you yes amen
[1:45:51] these are the words that you speak from
[1:45:54] your mouth this is why our
[1:45:58] testimony has to be
[1:46:01] positive all the time in the negative in
[1:46:04] the negative news cycle in the negative
[1:46:07] generation and a negative negative
[1:46:09] negative negative you have to think
[1:46:13] positive you have to speak positive and
[1:46:17] you have to say what God says about you
[1:46:20] right
[1:46:20] right you need to develop that your
[1:46:24] tongue needs to know how to say it and
[1:46:28] only say the blessings of the Lord the
[1:46:32] scriptural truths of the Lord and the
[1:46:35] things that concern your future your
[1:46:38] life your sickness your health your
[1:46:41] condition your circumstance your family
[1:46:45] oh my just positive testimony according
[1:46:50] to to what the word give us to say so
[1:46:54] this this has to be brought into its
[1:46:57] balance in Romans chapter 8 just for a
[1:46:59] moment we'll turn
[1:47:02] there and the Apostle Paul says shall
[1:47:06] all these things separate us from the
[1:47:08] love of
[1:47:10] God shall Peril shall sickness sell
[1:47:18] death amen
[1:47:21] that's Romans chapter 8 right yes it
[1:47:24] says
[1:47:26] this verse 18 I reckon that the
[1:47:28] suffering of this present time are not
[1:47:30] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:47:33] which shall be revealed in us and he
[1:47:36] goes on we're saved by hope drop down it
[1:47:41] says we know that verse 28 we know that
[1:47:44] all things work together for good amen
[1:47:47] to them that love God Amen to them who
[1:47:50] are the called according to his purpose
[1:47:53] what things work for good all things
[1:47:57] work for good why don't we say that more
[1:48:00] than just saying that you know it's
[1:48:02] never nothing ever works out for me I
[1:48:05] never you know I you know I just
[1:48:07] don't I I don't know why this always
[1:48:11] follows me I don't know why I have this
[1:48:13] lot in life I don't know why this always
[1:48:17] happens to me I knew it was going to
[1:48:20] happen to
[1:48:21] me why don't we quote this that all
[1:48:23] things work
[1:48:24] together for the
[1:48:27] good to them that are called we're not
[1:48:29] talking about everybody we talking about
[1:48:31] them at that sinner's prayer we was
[1:48:33] talking about yeah amen we're talking
[1:48:35] about the Sinners that were made
[1:48:37] Saints all things work together for the
[1:48:42] good don't worry about it it's working

[1:48:46] good amen amen tell some body yeah ex
[1:48:51] let somebody tell you all things are
[1:48:54] working together for the
[1:48:56] good so them that are called for his
[1:49:01] purpose verse 35 who shall separate us

[1:55:59] offend all If any man offend not in word
[1:56:03] the same is a perfect man and able also
[1:56:07] to Bridle the whole body behold we put
[1:56:10] bits into the H's mouth that they may
[1:56:13] that they may obey us and we turn about
[1:56:16] their whole
[1:56:17] body behold also the ships which though
[1:56:21] they be so great and are driven of
[1:56:24] fierce winds yet are they turned about
[1:56:27] with a very small
[1:56:30] helmly withs soever Governor lth even so
[1:56:35] the tongue is a little
[1:56:38] member and boasted great
[1:56:41] things beh great a matter a little fire
[1:56:46] kindleth and the tongue is is a
[1:56:51] fire a world of
[1:56:55] iniquity so is the tongue among our
[1:56:58] members that it defileth the whole body
[1:57:02] amen and sth on fire the course of of of
[1:57:06] Nature and it is set on fire of Hell
[1:57:11] oo whose tongue is he talking
[1:57:15] about for every kind of a beast of birds
[1:57:19] and of the serpents and of things in the
[1:57:22] sea is tamed and have been tamed of
[1:57:26] mankind but the tongue can no man
[1:57:30] tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly
[1:57:38] poison we talking about a man or a snake
[1:57:41] what are we talking
[1:57:42] about therefore we bless God even the
[1:57:45] father and there were curse We Men which
[1:57:49] are made after the similitude of God out
[1:57:51] of the same mouth proceedeth blessings
[1:57:55] and
[1:57:56] cursings Proverbs 18 my brethren these
[1:58:00] things ought not so to be talks about
[1:58:05] the fountain sending forth Sweet Water
[1:58:08] and bitter water talks about how a wise
[1:58:11] man and do with knowledge among you let
[1:58:14] him show forth out of a good
[1:58:17] conversation his works with
[1:58:20] meekness of
[1:58:23] wisdom
[1:58:26] now the Bible's very clear about our
[1:58:30] tongue and how we
[1:58:33] speak now the the
[1:58:37] purpose as we said that the words of the
[1:58:39] Lord have been recorded is so that they
[1:58:42] can be
[1:58:43] read outside of the present writing it
[1:58:47] was written in a certain presence
[1:58:49] written in a certain atmosphere but was
[1:58:51] it's it's meant to be read in another
[1:58:55] time in another atmosphere that's why
[1:58:57] it's written down it's handed down
[1:58:59] generation to generation or it's you
[1:59:01] know given here but then I'm going to
[1:59:03] reive it over there I'm reread it reread
[1:59:06] it reread it doesn't change the words
[1:59:08] but the people hearing it it ought to
[1:59:10] change them yes as they hear it and this
[1:59:15] is the same Principle as to why the
[1:59:19] message we have today has been recorded
[1:59:21] on tape yes amen it was recorded for the
[1:59:24] purpose of storing up food so that the
[1:59:28] people in the future would have
[1:59:30] something to feed on Amen people that
[1:59:33] were born in the 70s and the 80s or the
[1:59:36] 90s on down born in the 60s or born at
[1:59:40] any time maybe you know they were born
[1:59:42] at the time but they never heard the
[1:59:44] words or been to the Tabernacle
[1:59:46] themselves amen they never knew it they
[1:59:48] never understood they didn't know they
[1:59:50] didn't have the privilege of being in
[1:59:52] that local area they're from another
[1:59:54] time another place so the angel of the
[1:59:57] Lord moves brother brandham to record
[2:00:02] the sermons for that purpose exactly
[2:00:04] this is why the Bible is recorded amen
[2:00:06] so that you can read it amen and then
[2:00:09] when you read it then you speak it you
[2:00:13] speak what you
[2:00:15] read and when you speak what you read
[2:00:18] you own that becomes your confession
[2:00:22] your testimony good and so brother
[2:00:25] random tells us here I'll read a couple
[2:00:27] of those
[2:00:29] on
[2:00:31] um his ministry to store up the tapes he
[2:00:35] says this in the message uh wisdom
[2:00:38] versus faith faith paragraph
[2:00:42] 31 so I went back in the little place
[2:00:44] where we've been out a little place
[2:00:46] called Klondike about 40 mi from any
[2:00:48] civil civilization one a little store
[2:00:51] for ranchers and things and looked like
[2:00:53] it was Klondike and I turned out to be
[2:00:55] to it turned out to be this Tabernacle I
[2:00:58] was standing right here I was calling in
[2:01:01] great barrels of the prettiest food I
[2:01:03] ever seen radishes look like three foot
[2:01:06] long and turnips and greens and potatoes
[2:01:09] and everything and he said store in
[2:01:12] plenty of it and I was standing there
[2:01:15] just storing it in and these series of
[2:01:18] messes Jer this is right around
[2:01:22] 1962 um that he uh is starts talking
[2:01:26] about storing up food raises the value
[2:01:29] of recording his sermons right now is it
[2:01:32] valuable to be in the service for sure
[2:01:35] is it valuable to hear it on your
[2:01:37] natural ear sure absolutely but it's it
[2:01:41] it goes further and deeper if we can
[2:01:43] record that sermon now even if I was in
[2:01:47] the service a week later
[2:01:49] play it for me again it's going to
[2:01:52] benefit me is that right and it'll
[2:01:55] benefit those that wasn't in the service
[2:01:58] and if you were in the service you see
[2:02:01] the beauty of it you see why it had to
[2:02:03] be recorded you see the beauty of a
[2:02:06] Bible right and having the bible verses
[2:02:09] to take what the Bible says about water
[2:02:12] baptism what does the Bible say about
[2:02:15] being a Christian what does the Bible
[2:02:17] say about the communion and foot washing
[2:02:20] in the Lord's Supper what does the Bible
[2:02:24] say about speaking in tongues in the
[2:02:28] gifts of the
[2:02:30] Spirit everybody here has something they
[2:02:32] want to say including us we have
[2:02:34] something that we want to say but what
[2:02:35] does the Bible say it's recorded in his
[2:02:39] word yes it so we go back to that
[2:02:42] recording so this was the command given
[2:02:45] to the prophet taking siid with Jesus
[2:02:47] 1962 he he
[2:02:52] says paragraph Number 103 you remember
[2:02:55] what the dream that I got the
[2:02:57] interpretation was go back and store up
[2:03:00] food Hallelujah where was The Storehouse
[2:03:03] this Tabernacle where is there anything
[2:03:05] like it in the country around here
[2:03:08] anywhere that will compare with the
[2:03:10] message that we have now of course our
[2:03:13] little brothers here that's along here
[2:03:15] these are little churches are us we're
[2:03:18] one where would you go to to find it
[2:03:22] show its comparison anywhere you go
[2:03:25] right out into denominational Creeds you
[2:03:28] go right out away from the name of the
[2:03:30] Lord Jesus you go right out away from
[2:03:32] these other things see and here is where
[2:03:35] the food has been stored up well one
[2:03:39] message I preach here look like i' I've
[2:03:42] been preaching from one to six hours to
[2:03:44] you on a message well if I had to use
[2:03:46] one of those message I take a week to
[2:03:49] take it just a little bit here a little
[2:03:52] bit there see because it's been stored
[2:03:55] up here amen it's on tapes it'll go
[2:03:59] worldwide on the tapes where people in
[2:04:02] their houses them tapes will fall right
[2:04:04] into the hand of the predestinated of
[2:04:07] God will he can direct the word he'll
[2:04:10] direct everything just exactly to its
[2:04:13] course that's the reason he sent me back
[2:04:16] to do this store up the food here Lord
[2:04:21] he forbade me to go
[2:04:23] overseas so here the Lord is instructing
[2:04:28] the prophet to store up the food amen
[2:04:31] and why is it to be stored up so we can
[2:04:34] get a copy of it and say we got a copy
[2:04:37] so we can get it and load it up in our
[2:04:39] homes and on our bookshelves and put a
[2:04:42] title over it what is it stored up for
[2:04:45] it's stored up so that we can hear it
[2:04:48] amen amen put the tape on hear it for
[2:04:51] yourself and what you hear repeat am
[2:04:56] amen amen is that okay yes amen what you
[2:04:59] hear said say it again amen and that's
[2:05:02] really what confession means confession
[2:05:06] means to say the same thing by his
[2:05:11] stripes I don't feel too good I don't
[2:05:14] know the doctor gave me this evil report
[2:05:16] by here that ain't in the word
[2:05:19] by his stripes I don't feel well no that
[2:05:23] wasn't in the
[2:05:24] Declaration by his stripes we are what
[2:05:27] healed healed that's the
[2:05:29] Declaration what should be coming out of
[2:05:31] your
[2:05:33] mouth so so wait wait wait wait I'll say
[2:05:36] that after he heals me that's not in the
[2:05:38] Declaration either you can't make up the
[2:05:40] rules amen by his stripes I'm Healed on
[2:05:44] my way to the doctor's office in the
[2:05:47] doctor's office come coming out of the
[2:05:49] doctor's office I declare the word of
[2:05:52] the
[2:05:53] Lord past present and future when he
[2:05:58] said it it was true when he said it back
[2:06:01] then it was true when he says it today
[2:06:04] it's still true amen y'all got a witness
[2:06:07] on that amen am
[2:06:09] amen so none of us are
[2:06:13] sick how can I be healed and sick at the
[2:06:15] same time who's sick in here nobody's
[2:06:17] sick by stripes we
[2:06:21] are
[2:06:23] healed amen isn't that nice don't you
[2:06:26] prefer to be healed than to be sick amen
[2:06:29] that's the Declaration that he makes for
[2:06:32] us so the food is stored up for that
[2:06:35] purpose to hear what the word of the
[2:06:37] Lord has to say to us it's recorded that
[2:06:40] way it was admonished to be that way let
[2:06:43] me take one more in the message Christ
[2:06:46] is the mystery of God revealed paragraph
[2:06:48] number number five and once just a a
[2:06:52] while ago when you showed the vision the
[2:06:55] little Tabernacle here about to store up
[2:06:57] the food that there would come a time
[2:07:00] when this would all be
[2:07:03] needed amen when we seen brother sofman
[2:07:06] and brother wood ready to cross over
[2:07:07] into another country but you said store
[2:07:11] up this food here for the time what time
[2:07:15] would that
[2:07:17] be
[2:07:19] will we ever get to the point where we
[2:07:20] don't need to hear the
[2:07:23] prophets well some people have gotten to
[2:07:25] that
[2:07:27] point huh it's sad yeah God told him to
[2:07:31] store it up now what people do with it
[2:07:34] that's what they do with it can't
[2:07:35] control that what people do with the
[2:07:37] Bible can't control that what people do
[2:07:39] with your your flag you can't control
[2:07:42] that what people do with your race you
[2:07:43] can't control
[2:07:45] that they don't speak for don't speak
[2:07:47] for everybody in the race
[2:07:49] but I can control this right here and I
[2:07:52] can control what God gave me and God
[2:07:55] gave us his word and that's what we
[2:07:59] stand on that's what is positive that's
[2:08:05] what's going to take place and that's
[2:08:07] how we win actually amen that's how we
[2:08:12] win the battle amen now I'd like to go a
[2:08:16] little bit further and I know know and
[2:08:19] trust I trust and know it will be
[2:08:22] blessing to you because it's from the
[2:08:23] word of the Lord the the prophet of God
[2:08:27] goes into this message here and he says
[2:08:30] this
[2:08:34] here in the message position of the
[2:08:37] believer
[2:08:42] 1955 now if you're a Believer paragraph
[2:08:45] 18 now if you're a Believer I I believe
[2:08:49] that I know what the greatest curse
[2:08:51] that's on the church today is not
[2:08:54] knowing what they
[2:08:57] are now with the help of God this
[2:08:59] afternoon the holy scriptures if he will
[2:09:02] help us let us try to try to place the
[2:09:06] believer positionally in Christ and show
[2:09:09] what his authority is in Christ then
[2:09:13] everybody out there will be praying for
[2:09:15] the sick and we'll have a great meeting
[2:09:18] I'm sure so brother mam shows us that
[2:09:21] the greatest curse is Believers not
[2:09:25] knowing who they are their position they
[2:09:28] don't know that death and life lays in
[2:09:33] the power of the tongue they know it but
[2:09:36] that little member of the tongue he so
[2:09:39] quick he'll say it before you can catch
[2:09:41] what he's saying amen he'll say just
[2:09:43] speak negative because he's speaking
[2:09:45] what this is going through the carnal
[2:09:48] he's not speaking what the word
[2:09:50] says no man can tame that tongue but God
[2:09:53] can you ask the Holy Spirit to tame my
[2:09:58] tongue to say what the word of the Lord
[2:10:01] says amen Psalms 37 1-5 says fret not
[2:10:06] thyself because of
[2:10:08] evildoers neither be thou envious
[2:10:10] against the workers of iniquity for they
[2:10:13] shall soon be cut down like the grass
[2:10:16] and wither as the green herd herb trust
[2:10:19] in the Lord and do good so shall thou
[2:10:22] dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt
[2:10:26] be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord
[2:10:30] and He Shall give Thee the desires of
[2:10:33] thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord
[2:10:37] trust also in him and he shall bring it
[2:10:41] to pass
[2:10:44] amen
[2:10:45] amen praise the Lord amen that's good
[2:10:48] food for the believer yes it is trust in
[2:10:52] the Lord with all thy heart lean not to
[2:10:55] your own understanding fret not thyself
[2:10:58] because of
[2:10:59] evildoers Amen oh my the Lord's going to
[2:11:04] bring it to pass you commit it to him
[2:11:07] he'll bring it to pass is that right
[2:11:10] Saints oh my beautiful how it works and
[2:11:16] how this confession works works and I'll
[2:11:19] just take two places
[2:11:22] here and and then and then I'll close
[2:11:25] all right in the
[2:11:31] message my new ministry the prophet of
[2:11:34] God says this here in paragraph 2117 now
[2:11:37] I'm sure you all can see what it is it's
[2:11:40] a coming of a greater deeper anointing
[2:11:43] of the Holy Spirit how to get into it I
[2:11:47] don't know only thing I know it takes
[2:11:49] God to put you into it so you just live
[2:11:53] a sweet and humble and close to go as
[2:11:57] close to God as you
[2:11:59] can don't doubt him amen amen just
[2:12:04] believe that everything is working just
[2:12:07] to the good for you and everything will
[2:12:11] work around all
[2:12:15] right can somebody say man just believe
[2:12:19] everything is working for the good just
[2:12:21] believe that everything is working for
[2:12:24] the
[2:12:25] good you're a Believer it's got to work
[2:12:28] for your favor and if somebody ask
[2:12:32] you tame that tongue somebody asked you
[2:12:36] to say everything is working for the
[2:12:39] good Hallelujah and you might have just
[2:12:41] got off the phone with something that
[2:12:43] broke your heart right but when it's
[2:12:46] time for you to speak what you going to
[2:12:48] say say what the word says everything is
[2:12:51] working for the good place it in God's
[2:12:54] hands he continues on in the same
[2:12:57] message now every one of you not only
[2:12:59] ministers but all of you ought to pray
[2:13:02] for these people you don't know what God
[2:13:04] might do for you while you pray for
[2:13:06] somebody else right amen what if you say
[2:13:09] the right thing amen what if here is a
[2:13:12] woman standing here that's so sick they
[2:13:15] have to hold her up what if your prayer
[2:13:17] would be the right thing just like Bank
[2:13:20] said the right thing like Hattie said
[2:13:23] the right thing what if you would say
[2:13:25] the right thing your prayer to cause God
[2:13:29] to come down and do something amen you
[2:13:33] know sometimes we say what our eyes see
[2:13:36] and our eyes are we're not supposed to
[2:13:39] say what our eyes see that ain't what
[2:13:40] the scripture saying somebody coming in
[2:13:42] here oh they look terrible man wow
[2:13:46] goodness they're hooked they're in a
[2:13:48] wheelchair this and that and then you
[2:13:49] say that that's not what you're supposed
[2:13:51] to say you're supposed to quote what the
[2:13:53] word says we're coming to pray for them
[2:13:56] lay hands upon them by their stripes by
[2:13:58] his stripes they are healed if you're
[2:14:01] going to say anything at all let it be
[2:14:05] positive or don't say
[2:14:07] nothing amen but soon as you declare it
[2:14:10] soon as you say it death and
[2:14:13] life lays in the power of the
[2:14:16] tongue we see a lot of negative but
[2:14:19] we're not supposed to quote a lot of
[2:14:21] negative in fact we're not supposed to
[2:14:23] quote any negative Our Testimony should
[2:14:27] always be positive correct amen amen
[2:14:30] somebody brother brandom
[2:14:33] continues and he says this here oh my
[2:14:37] maybe you might not have that the
[2:14:39] spontaneous Faith to bring something
[2:14:43] this is in the message it shall be even
[2:14:45] as it was told me maybe you might not
[2:14:47] have this spontaneous Faith to bring
[2:14:49] something just a miracle right to you
[2:14:52] you may not have that kind of Faith but
[2:14:55] Jesus said if you had the faith like a
[2:14:57] mustard seed you could say to the
[2:15:00] mountain be moved and by it would come
[2:15:04] to pass it wouldn't vanish it away but
[2:15:07] by and by it would come to pass now the
[2:15:12] Mustard Seed the reason he said you
[2:15:14] could mix kale you can mix spinach breed
[2:15:18] together but you can't mix mustard with
[2:15:20] nothing it won't mix it's just mustard
[2:15:24] to be
[2:15:26] mustard some people this is in the
[2:15:28] second Miracle 1951 brother randam says
[2:15:31] this I have to get this in for
[2:15:33] you some people has great big Faith like
[2:15:37] this Anything Can Happen the next has
[2:15:40] faith that deep takes a little longer
[2:15:42] the next has faith that deep takes quite
[2:15:45] a little while some has faith fa like
[2:15:48] mustard seed but it's Mustard Seed Faith
[2:15:52] genuine if it's Mustard Seed Faith
[2:15:54] genuine Faith hold on to it just keep
[2:15:56] believing it it'll become marble Faith
[2:16:00] then it'll become grapefruit faith and
[2:16:03] then it'll become Mountain Faith it'll
[2:16:06] bring you right out if you just stay
[2:16:09] with it hold on to it it'll bring you
[2:16:13] right straight to the light if you'll
[2:16:16] stay with it
[2:16:18] oh my
[2:16:21] amen don't you love the Lord yes amen
[2:16:25] all
[2:16:29] right yes
[2:16:33] sir this will be my last one here if I
[2:16:36] can find it for you here
[2:16:38] quickly sure I
[2:16:46] can
[2:16:51] yes where I think Pentecostals the
[2:16:54] Pentecostals
[2:16:58] fail he says this here paragraph number
[2:17:03] 14 you can never exhaust God's love and
[2:17:07] mercy to you amen you say well I hate to
[2:17:10] bother you so much father he wants to be
[2:17:14] bothered that way Glory he does
[2:17:18] don't never think that you could ever
[2:17:20] ask ask too much of God I believe the
[2:17:24] scripture says you have not because you
[2:17:27] ask not you ask not because you believe
[2:17:32] not he wants us to ask and believe that
[2:17:35] our Joys will be full he wants you to
[2:17:38] ask
[2:17:39] abundantly ask for big things don't
[2:17:43] limit your faith to some little Mustard
[2:17:45] Seed get on out here to some other kind
[2:17:47] of faith and move out in big things ask
[2:17:52] big things is just as easy to receive as
[2:17:56] little things you just have to believe
[2:17:59] that's all and you've got faith just
[2:18:02] know exactly how to use it and it'll be
[2:18:06] all right you can put it right to work
[2:18:09] and it'll just be
[2:18:12] fine and I believe that that we can ask
[2:18:16] God for the little things for the great
[2:18:19] things
[2:18:21] amen the positive things that he gives
[2:18:23] us in his word he's laid them out for us
[2:18:27] I believe they're for us I believe that
[2:18:29] God has already paid the price for us
[2:18:32] and we just have to confess that know
[2:18:35] what his word says take a stand on it
[2:18:38] and then believe what he said don't
[2:18:41] doubt in our heart amen quote it say it
[2:18:44] and then you'll have it you know that
[2:18:46] last verse in Mark 11
[2:18:48] 24 says this therefore I say unto you
[2:18:52] desire what things you desire what
[2:18:54] things soever you desire When you pray
[2:18:58] believe that you receive them and ye
[2:19:01] shall have them so there are the things
[2:19:05] that he says whatever things you desire
[2:19:08] whatever whatever I say when you desire
[2:19:12] that there's a desire then you pray and
[2:19:17] you believe in what you pray and then
[2:19:20] believe that you receive
[2:19:22] them then you shall have them so what
[2:19:27] kind of prayer should you have Lord I
[2:19:30] hope one day you deliver me oh you claim
[2:19:34] it Lord I claim the Deliverance that you
[2:19:38] purchased at Calvary for me I claim my

[2:19:57] Calvary for me I claim them lord they're
[2:20:01] mine I believe it and I'll take a stand
[2:20:04] for it in jesus' name in these prayers

[2:29:32] man's
[2:29:34] healing and I didn't do
[2:29:37] it I fed
[2:29:40] him but I didn't pray for you to heal
[2:29:43] his foot until I got home
[2:29:49] [Music]
[2:29:56] I even tried to call the police to get
[2:29:58] them to come and take him to the
[2:30:00] hospital because I promised him I would
[2:30:04] not take him to the hospital just to get
[2:30:07] him into my truck so he'd have a warm
[2:30:09] place to eat to
[2:30:12] hemper then I couldn't I couldn't break
[2:30:15] my promise
[2:30:17] I could have laid hands on
[2:30:20] him and ask your blessing to heal his
[2:30:23] broken
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:25] foot and I didn't do
[2:30:32] [Music]
[2:30:34] it please Lord forgive

[2:30:41] us Jesus our negative thoughts our

[2:31:01] failures last was
[2:31:03] [Music]
[2:31:07] there a blessing and a great
[2:31:11] failure and
[2:31:13] then when I turned
[2:31:15] around try and find him and give him my
[2:31:18] coat because he swear he was going to
[2:31:20] sleep out in the open in the night and
[2:31:24] take the bus
[2:31:26] tomorrow to St Mary's Hospital to get in
[2:31:28] the hospital he'd had a broken foot for
[2:31:31] a week and a half and I looked around to
[2:31:34] try and give him more money and give him
[2:31:37] my own
[2:31:39] coat he disappeared
[2:31:42] Lord man who couldn't walk had
[2:31:45] disappeared
