[28:08] Amen. God bless each of you. We're so
[28:10] happy to be in the house of the Lord
[28:12] with you tonight. And we come to hear
[28:14] from the word of God and to worship him
[28:17] in spirit and in truth. So good to be
[28:20] back in the house of the Lord with each
[28:22] of you. And may God bless you richly.
[28:25] We're going into the adoption part four
[28:29] and it's a real beautiful teaching on
[28:33] the adoption and positionally placing
[28:36] the believer and how the Holy Spirit has
[28:39] a position for all of us and is trying
[28:42] to place us. Amen.
[28:44] And brother Brandham goes into this
[28:46] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[28:49] of God. I'm really looking forward to uh
[28:52] this portion of the message and it's uh
[28:55] for scripture reading. We'll go into
[28:57] Ephesians chapter 1.
[29:00] I trust this has been a blessing to you.
[29:03] Amen. as you go deeper into it.
[29:10] I've gone through this series, I think,
[29:12] every year for maybe three or four
[29:15] years. And uh it always brings out so
[29:18] much more every time I go through it.
[29:22] And it shows us where we're headed, what
[29:25] the church should be. In Ephesians
[29:27] chapter 1, the prophet of God is going
[29:30] to take, I believe, verse number eight,
[29:32] and we'll just read from verse seven,
[29:35] 8, nine.
[29:39] When you have that, you can say, "Amen."
[29:40] Amen.
[29:42] It says, "In whom we have redemption
[29:44] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[29:47] sins, according to the riches of his
[29:49] grace, wherein he hath abounded towards
[29:53] us in all wisdom and prudence, having
[29:56] made known to us the mystery of his
[29:59] will, according to his good pleasure,
[30:03] which he hath purposed in himself,
[30:07] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[30:09] of times he might gather together one
[30:12] all things in Christ, both which are in
[30:15] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[30:20] him. In whom also we have obtained an
[30:24] inheritance,
[30:26] being predestinated according to the
[30:28] purpose of him who workketh all things
[30:32] after the counsel of his will. And we're
[30:35] so glad to be predestinated tonight.
[30:38] Amen. He's got a purpose for our life.
[30:40] And we see the great battle, the great
[30:42] showdown, the great test that we're in.
[30:46] I mean, the times have really changed.
[30:49] We're in a really a tremendous testing
[30:52] time. Those of us that follow the word,
[30:55] the message of the hour, and there's
[30:57] been a great attack against this
[30:59] message. It looks like it's against that
[31:01] church or that group, whatever, but
[31:03] they're really after this message
[31:05] because Satan knows that this is the
[31:09] truth.
[31:10] It is the word is it is the truth of God
[31:13] and we have to stand for it. Amen.
[31:17] And um this is where we get our
[31:19] instructions. This is where we get our
[31:20] vitamins.
[31:22] This is the workout room for us. This is
[31:24] how we get stronger
[31:26] so we can fight the enemy in this evil
[31:29] day. I'll tell you this, we won't be
[31:32] able to argue our way out of this.
[31:35] And it won't be an intellectual battle
[31:38] and it won't be me proving you wrong or
[31:40] them proving them right and scripture
[31:42] versus scripture, but it will be a
[31:44] revelation
[31:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ in your life.
[31:48] And that will keep you.
[31:49] Amen. Upon this rock I will build my
[31:53] church and the gates of hell shall not
[31:57] prevail against that. Against what? The
[31:59] revelation. So Lord, give us a
[32:01] revelation tonight. Give it to my
[32:04] children. Give it to the adults. Give it
[32:07] to your pastor. Give it to the deacons.
[32:10] Give us a revelation of the Lord Jesus
[32:14] Christ. And Satan can't stand against
[32:16] that. Amen.
[32:18] So that's what we're looking for. for a
[32:19] little amen moment, a little anointing,
[32:22] a little reare
[32:25] to go there. Let's sing
[32:29] that
[32:31] [Music]
[32:45] composible
[32:49] only.
[32:51] [Music]
[32:54] Oh, holy,
[33:01] holy,
[33:07] all things are possible.
[33:13] All Let's make a confession tonight.
[33:16] Lord, I believe.
[33:18] And Lord,
[33:20] I believe.
[33:24] Lord,
[33:26] I believe
[33:28] [Music]
[33:29] that all things are possible.
[33:35] Lord, I believe.
[33:41] Lord,
[33:43] I believe.
[33:46] Yes, Lord.
[33:49] I believe
[33:52] that all things are possible.
[33:58] Lord, I believe.
[34:03] God bless you. You may be seated.
[34:04] Brother Brandham.
[34:07] Had rather a wonderful afternoon this
[34:09] afternoon talking to a famous doctor in
[34:13] Louisville, his nurse. She heard about
[34:17] the glorious things of the Lord and her
[34:19] father is a doctor and she came over and
[34:22] sat in my room most of the afternoon
[34:23] just come in dropped in wonderful person
[34:28] rather a little hard you know kind of a
[34:30] staunch real Presbyterian to start with
[34:33] but left with tears running down her
[34:37] cheeks.
[34:38] Amen.
[34:38] Oh God's got them just sticking
[34:41] everywhere.
[34:42] Doctor's offices and nurses. I don't
[34:45] believe there's a nurse in Norton's
[34:47] Infirmary Hospital that I didn't testify
[34:49] to about having the Holy Ghost and asked
[34:50] her if she was baptized in the name of
[34:52] Jesus.
[34:53] Amen.
[34:53] Not a doctor I come in contact with
[34:55] anywhere. Nothing. See, tell them about
[34:58] it. We ain't got much time, brother.
[35:00] No matter how hard it seems, just wait
[35:02] till you cross that last breath and see.
[35:04] Then you wish you had done it. Yes, sir.
[35:08] Don't wait till that time. Let's do it
[35:09] right now.
[35:10] This is the hour. Oh, they might
[35:12] disagree and human fuss a little about
[35:14] it, but they don't mean it. They really
[35:16] don't mean it. They they they're all
[35:18] right. And they go to fussing at you.
[35:20] Just just remember they they don't
[35:22] really mean it. They don't mean it. They
[35:25] just maybe been taught something and
[35:26] they just hang to that so you you can
[35:29] see their idea. Don't fuss with them.
[35:32] Don't fuss with no one, but just love
[35:34] them right into it and pray for them.
[35:39] Well, I think we got down to the ninth
[35:41] verse. I'm not sure.
[35:44] That's a long ways from the third
[35:45] chapter, isn't it?
[35:50] But oh, it's honey in the rock to me.
[35:54] Yes.
[35:55] We were speaking now, remember? So, we
[35:58] can get a little background again. And
[36:00] now, Brother Neville, you you pull me a
[36:03] little bit now if I fail to see the time
[36:05] getting away so I can have prayer for
[36:06] the sick.
[36:09] We want to get every little speck that
[36:12] we can. And tonight I want an alder
[36:15] call.
[36:17] Amen.
[36:18] Uh ending up on this which I may be able
[36:21] just to read the rest of it. But the
[36:24] purpose of this is seeing your position
[36:28] in Christ.
[36:30] seeing that it's not something that you
[36:34] just stumbled into or something that
[36:37] might have you merited somewhere, but
[36:39] it's what God did for you himself.
[36:44] Not that you were so good that you went
[36:46] to a church one night
[36:49] that some poor brother led you up to the
[36:51] altar. It wasn't that. It was God before
[36:55] the foundation of the world
[36:56] predestinated you eternal life.
[37:00] When you get there that day, no wonder
[37:02] the 40 24 elders laid off their crowns.
[37:06] Everybody laid down their crowns.
[37:08] Everyone fell on the faces. They didn't
[37:11] have one thing they could say. No
[37:13] preacher, no elder, no nothing. All
[37:15] praise to the lamb.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:19] God will gather in him all things at
[37:23] that day.
[37:24] or if we could ever know and recognize
[37:26] who that was, who they crucified.
[37:30] Now on the we start at the eth verse to
[37:33] get a little background. Wherein he has
[37:35] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[37:38] prudence,
[37:40] having made known unto us the mystery of
[37:43] his will, the mysteries
[37:47] of his will.
[37:51] And remember how we hung on that? How
[37:53] many were here this morning? Let's see
[37:56] how we stuck on that. The mystery of his
[38:01] will. Now, it is not just a little
[38:04] thing. Then it's a mystery. God's will
[38:07] is a mystery. And each man has to seek
[38:10] out the will of God for his or herself.
[38:15] God's mystery. How do we find out Paul
[38:18] was known to him? He said he didn't
[38:20] confer with any man. no flesh and blood.
[38:23] He went to no school, no seminary. He
[38:25] had nothing to do with it. But he it was
[38:27] revealed to him by Jesus Christ.
[38:31] Amen.
[38:32] Who met him on the road to Damascus in a
[38:35] a light like a pillar of fire and it
[38:38] called him and he went to Arabia and
[38:42] there dwelt three years.
[38:45] Oh, don't you imagine that was some
[38:48] time, brother.
[38:49] Amen. three years Paul down there in
[38:52] Arabia ridden him a little somewhere
[38:55] walking up and down the floor with all
[38:57] the old scrolls. They didn't have the
[38:58] new ones. Paul wrote them mostly riding
[39:02] these old scrolls. How that God at the
[39:06] beginning predestinated us unto eternal
[39:09] life. How that he would send Jesus that
[39:12] through this sacrifice we would all have
[39:14] a right to the tree of life. Those who
[39:18] he forneew, he called. Those who he
[39:19] called, he has already justified. Those
[39:22] who he justified, he has already
[39:25] glorified.
[39:27] God since the beginning of the world
[39:29] predestinated us to the adoption of
[39:31] sons. Now the whole creation groaning,
[39:34] waiting for the manifestation of the
[39:37] sons of God.
[39:39] Oh, I'd imagine Paul had a wonderful
[39:41] time. I'd like to have been there with
[39:43] him. Wouldn't you? Amen.
[39:44] Now, he said he made known to us the
[39:47] mystery.
[39:49] Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and
[39:51] start running that and just watch how it
[39:54] goes. This afternoon, I had all about 30
[39:58] minutes to study just to look the lesson
[40:01] over. Maybe not I I'll say half of that,
[40:03] 15 minutes between the times.
[40:07] And I got to running and I thought the
[40:10] mystery, how mysterious.
[40:14] And the scripture packed me back into
[40:17] the Old Testament. Then back over into
[40:20] the New Testament, tied something
[40:23] together. See the mystery of his coming,
[40:26] the mystery of his will, the mystery of
[40:29] the setting together. Remember, it
[40:32] cannot be taught in any seminary.
[40:37] It's a mystery.
[40:39] You cannot know it by education, by
[40:41] theology.
[40:42] It's a mystery that's been hidden since
[40:45] the foundation of the world.
[40:48] Waiting for the manifestations
[40:52] of the sons of God. Tell me, my brother,
[40:56] tell me, my sister, when was the time
[41:00] that the sons of God was ever to be
[41:02] manifested outside of this time now?
[41:06] When was there ever a time in history
[41:10] there's a manifest the time to deliver
[41:12] all nature
[41:14] nature the nature itself is groaning
[41:16] waiting for the time of the
[41:18] manifestation
[41:20] why before the atonement was made before
[41:22] the holy ghost was ever poured out
[41:24] before all the all the old testament on
[41:27] down there there couldn't have been
[41:28] manifestations
[41:30] it had to wait till this time
[41:33] now all things has been brought
[41:36] coming shaping up to a headstone
[41:40] to the manifestations of sons of God
[41:44] coming back and the spirit of God coming
[41:46] into these men so perfectly until their
[41:51] ministry will be so close like Christ to
[41:55] little John him and his church together.
[42:00] How many ever studied the history of the
[42:02] pyrams?
[42:03] I guess maybe one lady here raise your
[42:06] hand. All right.
[42:09] God wrote three Bibles. One of them was
[42:12] the zodiac in the skies.
[42:15] That's the first Bible. Man was to look
[42:17] up to realize that God is from above.
[42:21] Follow the zodiac. Do you ever study it?
[42:23] It even gives every age. Even the cancer
[42:26] age.
[42:28] It gives the beginning, the fir the
[42:29] birth of Christ. What is the first
[42:31] figure in the zodiac? the virgin. What's
[42:34] the last figure? Leo, the lion, the
[42:36] first coming and the second coming of
[42:38] Christ. All of it is written in there.
[42:42] Then the next Bible was written was in
[42:46] stone called pyramids.
[42:49] God wrote in the pyramids. If you study
[42:51] them, watch the ancient histories and
[42:53] wars how they were built before the
[42:56] Andolubian destruction. The third was
[42:58] wrote on paper, the Bible, for the great
[43:03] smart intellectual world to come. Now,
[43:07] as God has moved down through the age,
[43:10] we're at Leo the line. We're at the
[43:14] capping of the pyramid. We're in the
[43:17] book of the Revelations at the last
[43:19] chapter.
[43:21] Science says we're three minutes before
[43:22] midnight.
[43:25] Oh, think of where we're at. And notice,
[43:28] let's take the pyramid. It's easy. It
[43:31] runs kind of like in a triangle.
[43:34] When we were down here, beginning at the
[43:36] early age of the church at the
[43:38] Reformation in Luther's time, just a man
[43:41] to say he was a Christian either meant
[43:44] his life or death.
[43:46] They kill him for even saying he's a
[43:48] Christian. Therefore, to go through
[43:50] persecution,
[43:51] every age through every time there's
[43:54] been persecution.
[43:56] All that live godly in Christ Jesus
[43:58] shall suffer persecution.
[44:00] In the age of Luther, it was horrible to
[44:02] say a Lutheran. He was considered a
[44:05] fanatic and could be put to death. Many
[44:08] times they killed him at stakes, burn
[44:09] them, and everything else for Lutheran.
[44:12] Then the church narrowed as like the
[44:15] pyramid. It come into another step of
[44:17] grace which was sanctification. Wesley's
[44:20] time when he protested the Anglican
[44:22] church taught sanctification. It come
[44:26] into the minority again.
[44:28] Then they were called a bunch of
[44:31] fanatics.
[44:33] How many was Methodist or used to be or
[44:36] was once connected with the Methodist
[44:37] church? Half of you. Did you know the
[44:40] Methodist church all almost had the Holy
[44:43] Ghost one time?
[44:44] Amen.
[44:46] I've went to Methodist churches, see
[44:48] them fall on the floor and they throw
[44:49] water and face and phantom of the fan.
[44:51] Keep the Holy Ghost from coming on them.
[44:53] That's right. Now that's the truth. Down
[44:57] the hills of Kentucky where we had
[44:58] Methodists. You guys are church joiners.
[45:01] I hear we had Methodists back there and
[45:03] Baptist. We get out the order and beat
[45:05] one another in the back till we got
[45:07] something. We come through. We live
[45:09] different after that. But you just come
[45:11] up, put your name on the book and say,
[45:12] "I'm a Methodist." and get the salt
[45:14] shaker and sprinkle a little water on
[45:16] you and that's all of it. Go on out,
[45:19] wear shorts, makeup,
[45:22] run the horse races, bet gamble, play
[45:25] slot machines, everything else. Still
[45:27] good Methodist.
[45:29] That's not Methodist.
[45:32] That's just church joiners. That's
[45:34] right. Baptist the same way.
[45:37] Presbyterian
[45:38] on down the same way. As David
[45:40] Duplicitus said, grandchildren. God
[45:42] don't have any grandchildren.
[45:45] God never had a grandchild.
[45:48] He's got sons but no grandsons.
[45:51] Right?
[45:52] You and people that come into the
[45:54] Methodist church or Pentecostal church
[45:56] or Baptist church because your mother
[45:58] and father was Pentecostal or Baptist
[46:00] and you're grandson. They were sons.
[46:02] You're grandson thing. So God don't have
[46:04] anything like that. The church has a lot
[46:06] of that but not but not the not the not
[46:10] God doesn't. Now notice these on down to
[46:14] it comes down now as it becomes to the
[46:16] minority the church the Pentecostal age
[46:20] come in. That certainly cut off a lot of
[46:22] bumps.
[46:24] Then it what did it do? It just left the
[46:27] Methodist and Lutheran on behind. Now
[46:29] the Holy Spirit's moved right on away
[46:30] from the Pentecostal age.
[46:33] What did they do? They organized
[46:36] made themselves we are the assemblies of
[46:38] God. We are the oneness. We are the
[46:41] tuneness. We are the church of God. We
[46:44] are the this or that. You don't belong.
[46:46] You can't get into heaven unless you got
[46:48] your name on our book. Oh, such
[46:49] nonsense.
[46:51] I don't care if you're Baptist,
[46:52] Methodist, Presbyterian. You put your
[46:54] name on the book of life when God puts
[46:56] it on there.
[46:58] If you were predestinated, the eternal
[46:59] life, God will call you some way,
[47:01] somehow, some way or another.
[47:04] He sure will.
[47:06] All the Father has given me will come to
[47:08] me. Amen.
[47:08] Amen.
[47:09] No matter what church you belong to,
[47:10] that has nothing to do with.
[47:13] But the denomination will never do one
[47:15] thing to you, but might hinder you a lot
[47:18] from going on with God, but it'll it'll
[47:20] never do nothing else.
[47:21] That's right.
[47:22] Congregate you together with a bunch of
[47:24] believers and unbelievers.
[47:25] Of course, you hit that everywhere you
[47:27] go. They even had that in heaven. So,
[47:30] it's all right.
[47:32] But you're looking to your denomination.
[47:34] Look to Jesus.
[47:36] Amen. He's the one to look to. Now, as
[47:39] we're coming right down to the How many
[47:42] I'll be this woman here, raise your hand
[47:44] that you'd study the pyramids. You know,
[47:45] the pyramid never was capped, was it?
[47:47] Never did have a capstone put on it.
[47:49] They never couldn't even find it. They
[47:52] don't know what ever happened to it.
[47:53] Why? Why was the capstone put on the
[47:56] headstone, the top of it? Because he was
[47:59] rejected when he come.
[48:02] He was a rejected stone.
[48:04] That's right.
[48:06] But it will be kept.
[48:08] That's right. And then those stones that
[48:11] fit around that head stone will have to
[48:13] be stones that'll be so completely like
[48:15] that stone that'll fit it joint. And
[48:17] every every where the pyramid is so
[48:20] perfect you can't run a razor blade
[48:22] between them where them stones go
[48:24] together. Such beautiful masonry. Some
[48:27] of them would weigh hundreds of tons up
[48:29] in the air and so perfectly set
[48:32] together. That's why God's bringing his
[48:34] church. Yes,
[48:35] we are fitly joined together.
[48:38] Amen.
[48:38] One heart and one accord.
[48:41] Now, somebody say, "Well, the Lutheran
[48:43] back there had nothing." Don't you
[48:44] believe it? The Lutheran will come forth
[48:47] in the resurrection just the same as the
[48:48] rest will come forth in the
[48:49] resurrection. Baptist, Presbyterians,
[48:52] and all of God's children will come
[48:53] forth in that resurrection. That's the
[48:56] reason today people say, "Oh, well,
[48:58] there'll be a sweeping revival that'll
[48:59] go out here and save a 100 million
[49:01] Pentecostals that'll all get saved and
[49:03] that'll be the rapture." You're
[49:05] mistaken.
[49:06] That rapture will be hundreds of
[49:08] thousands. That's right. But there'll be
[49:09] a made up 6,000 years of salvation, too.
[49:14] 6,000 years back. Man walks in the light
[49:17] as the light comes to him.
[49:19] He crosses the bridges when he comes to
[49:22] them. Now, if he refuses it, then he's
[49:24] left in darkness. But if he keeps moving
[49:27] on, now notice, then the coming of the
[49:31] Lord Jesus is so close at hand
[49:35] until the spirit from way down in here,
[49:38] just barely justification,
[49:41] sanctification,
[49:42] baptism of the Holy Spirit, and now
[49:44] right into the time of the coming of the
[49:47] headstone.
[49:49] The church has got to be so perfectly
[49:52] like Christ until Christ and the church
[49:55] can unite together.
[49:58] The same spirit.
[50:00] And if the spirit of Christ is in you,
[50:03] it makes you live the life of Christ,
[50:05] act the life of Christ, do the works of
[50:08] Christ.
[50:09] He that believeth on me, the works that
[50:11] I do shall he do also.
[50:13] Jesus said that. See, now we going to
[50:17] have we got a ministry coming. It's just
[50:19] exactly like the life of Christ.
[50:23] Amen.
[50:23] What does that ministry identify? The
[50:25] coming of the Lord.
[50:28] Look at it in the world today. Watch
[50:30] what Kruch's saying and all these other
[50:32] great things and great worldwide
[50:35] conflict right at hand at any time could
[50:39] go to power at any second. That's right.
[50:42] And if that we know that that's closed,
[50:46] any sensible person can read in a
[50:48] newspaper or listen to a radio or know
[50:51] that that is closed. Well, remember
[50:53] Christ comes for his church before that
[50:56] happens.
[50:58] Amen.
[50:59] So, how close is the coming of the Lord
[51:01] Jesus?
[51:02] Maybe before this meeting ends tonight.
[51:06] We are at the end time.
[51:09] Certainly true. Watch the church as it's
[51:12] come as it moved. Just take it in your
[51:15] own mind. You historians to study
[51:17] history. Look at the Lutheran church
[51:19] under justification
[51:21] coming just freshly from Catholicism.
[51:25] Look at it moving. Now look at Wesley
[51:27] coming a little closer in the
[51:29] sanctification weaving into the
[51:31] scriptures. Look at right in between the
[51:33] Wesley. Then the next thing coming was
[51:35] the Pentecostal age.
[51:38] I'm the Pentecostal age with the
[51:40] restoration of the gifts, the spiritual
[51:42] gifts. Now look at the age coming now
[51:44] right up to the headstone.
[51:46] Amen.
[51:48] See what I mean?
[51:51] The coming of the Lord, the Magno and
[51:55] God and all creations is waiting for the
[51:59] church to positionally find its place.
[52:03] trouble day I pretty much everyone I met
[52:06] I was rolled out was taking I have to
[52:09] have a physical examination you know for
[52:11] going overseas you missionaries and so
[52:13] forth and all that and when I was taking
[52:15] examination they brought me out of the
[52:16] room there been drinking that old looked
[52:19] to me like do a meal or something and I
[52:21] I'd been drinking it and come out of
[52:24] there sit down wait for a half hour to
[52:25] see whether it went out of my stomach or
[52:27] not I look across there and there's some
[52:29] little woman look like she's just about
[52:31] to die she's So little legs and little
[52:34] arms and I kept moving down from this
[52:36] man to that man, this man to that man,
[52:38] getting closer to her till I got down to
[52:40] where she was. She looked like poor old
[52:42] thing is about to die. I got up close. I
[52:44] said, "Pardon me, madam." She said, "How
[52:47] do you do?" Oh, she was so sick. And I
[52:49] said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I went
[52:51] to Tucson to visit my daughter. I got
[52:53] sick. They can't find what's right." I
[52:55] said, "One thing I want to ask you." I
[52:57] said, "I'm a gospel preacher. Are you a
[53:00] Christian?
[53:01] Are you ready to go if that hour shall
[53:03] come? And she said,"I belong to such and
[53:06] such a church." I said, "That wasn't the
[53:08] question I asked you."
[53:11] Are you a Christian filled with God's
[53:14] spirit and ready to go when he calls
[53:17] you? The woman didn't even know what I
[53:19] was talking about. See? Oh, what a
[53:22] pitiful sight the world is in.
[53:25] Now make known unto us the mysteries of
[53:29] his will. The coming of Let me read you
[53:32] something. I was reading. Let's turn
[53:34] over now to the mystery of his will.
[53:36] Let's turn to Hebrews here just a
[53:38] minute. The seventh chapter of Hebrews,
[53:40] I believe it is. I'd like to read you
[53:42] something that would just make you feel
[53:44] so good when we think we're sitting
[53:46] together in heavenly places. Hebrews the
[53:49] 7th chapter.
[53:52] For this Melzdc, now watch,
[53:56] king of Salem,
[53:58] priest of the most high God. What's a
[54:01] mystery now? Here's a mystery. Watch
[54:03] this.
[54:05] Who is this fella? Making knowing the
[54:08] mystery of his will.
[54:13] This MelzDC, I'm waiting for everybody
[54:15] here. The Bible still turning. Hebrews
[54:18] 7th chapter Paul speaking same man of
[54:21] Galatians
[54:23] for this Melzdc
[54:25] king of Salem priest of the most high
[54:29] God met Abraham returning from the
[54:31] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[54:36] to whom also Abraham gave a part tenth
[54:40] part of all first being interpretation
[54:44] by interpretation
[54:45] king of righteousness
[54:50] after that king of Salem.
[54:53] Who is this fellow
[54:56] which is king of peace
[55:00] without father
[55:03] without mother
[55:05] without descent
[55:07] having neither beginning of days or
[55:08] ending of life.
[55:11] Who was this man?
[55:15] Who was he? No,
[55:18] he never had a father. He never had a
[55:20] mother. He never had when he began and
[55:22] never did have a time to ever die.
[55:23] Amen.
[55:27] He met Abraham
[55:29] coming from the slaughter of the kings.
[55:32] What was he doing? He went out to get
[55:34] Lot his lost brother to bring him back.
[55:38] And he slaughtered the kings which them
[55:40] kings and slaughtered I believe 10 or 15
[55:43] kings in their kingdoms. But Abraham
[55:46] armed his servants and went after him,
[55:49] separated himself by night. See, when he
[55:52] caught him in the night time, now
[55:55] brethren,
[55:57] we're working in the darkness now. The
[55:59] only light we have is the gospel light,
[56:02] but he separated himself and called him
[56:04] and brought him back and on his road
[56:06] back after the battle was over.
[56:11] Let's go to Genesis 14 just a minute to
[56:13] get the story more planer.
[56:17] Let's go over here in Genesis for I
[56:19] believe 14. Genesis 14.
[56:24] Yes. Let's take Genesis 14
[56:28] uh 18
[56:31] begin.
[56:33] Let's start just a little before that.
[56:36] Let's start. Yeah. The 18th verse.
[56:39] Genesis 14:18
[56:42] and Melazedc now that's Abraham
[56:45] returning now from the slaughter of the
[56:47] kings
[56:49] came back on his road back bringing back
[56:51] Lot all the people that they had taken
[56:54] away all like David who went and got the
[56:58] what did David do took the little
[56:59] slingshot went out and grabbed this
[57:02] little lamb out of the lion's mouth
[57:05] think of a slingshot going after a lamb
[57:08] who in the world would do that. Tell me
[57:11] what man in your would do it. Rise up
[57:13] your hand. I'll tell you right quick,
[57:14] you're wrong. You didn't see me put mine
[57:17] up.
[57:19] No, I wouldn't go after him as a 30 six
[57:22] Harley.
[57:24] But he went after him with a slingshot,
[57:27] a little piece of leather length with
[57:30] two strings on it, winding around
[57:33] because and when it come time for
[57:36] Goliath to make his boast, he went out
[57:38] to Goliath and he said, "The God of
[57:40] heaven has let me deliver a lamb out of
[57:44] the mouth of the lion, out of the mouth
[57:47] of the bear." He knew it was a
[57:49] slingshot.
[57:50] It was the power of God that went with
[57:52] him. Amen.
[57:53] He was the one that brought that lamb
[57:55] back.
[57:56] That's what we say today. God's got
[57:59] David sticking around.
[58:01] Amen.
[58:01] Yes, sir. That's feeding father's sheep.
[58:05] And once in a while, a tumor will come
[58:07] or a cancer will come or something and
[58:08] jump out of the hands of the doctor.
[58:11] That won't stop that David. He'll go
[58:13] right on out there after that fella with
[58:15] a little slingshot of ask anything in my
[58:17] name, it shall be given. I don't care.
[58:19] Doctors can laugh and everybody else can
[58:21] make fun of him. me a boy after you
[58:23] anyhow.
[58:24] Amen.
[58:26] Bringing that sheep back to the foe.
[58:28] Yes, sir. He's God's child. Take your
[58:30] hand off of him.
[58:32] Knock this lion down. Then the lion rose
[58:34] up. He grabbed him by the beard and
[58:35] killed him. A little bitty ruddy boy.
[58:37] Probably weigh 80 or 90 pounds.
[58:40] Watch me mazec
[58:43] the king of Salem, which is king of
[58:46] peace, which actually Salem laid across
[58:48] the hill. It's the king of Jerusalem.
[58:50] Who it was? Yes,
[58:52] that's exactly who it was. King of
[58:54] Jerusalem,
[58:56] which Jerusalem was first called Salem,
[58:59] which was peace.
[59:01] That was Jerusalem first before it was
[59:03] called Jerusalem. He was the king of
[59:06] Jerusalem.
[59:07] He was a king of righteousness, the king
[59:10] of peace,
[59:12] the king of Salem.
[59:14] He had no father. He had no mother. He
[59:17] had no beginning of days. He had no
[59:20] ending of life. He had no descent.
[59:22] Amen.
[59:25] Who is this fella? Watch him. After the
[59:29] battle was over, after the victory was
[59:32] won, watch what he said. And Melzdc 18th
[59:37] verse 14th chapter Genesis. And Melzdc,
[59:41] king of Salem,
[59:44] brought forth bread and wine.
[59:48] And he was the priest of the most high
[59:51] God. And he blessed him and said,
[59:54] "Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
[59:58] processor of heavens and earth. And
[1:00:01] blessed be the most high God, which has
[1:00:04] delivered thine enemies into thy hand."
[1:00:06] And he gave him a tenth of all. Let's
[1:00:10] read a little farther. And the king of
[1:00:13] Sodom said unto Abraham, "Give me the
[1:00:15] persons and take the goods for thyself."
[1:00:18] And Abram said unto the king of Sodom, I
[1:00:22] have lifted up my hand unto the Lord,
[1:00:26] the most high God, the possessor of
[1:00:29] heavens and earth. Listen how he
[1:00:31] abbreviated that.
[1:00:33] how he given to him that I will not take
[1:00:36] from a thread even to a shoe latch
[1:00:40] and that I will not take anything
[1:00:45] not anything
[1:00:47] that may say and not of thine lest thou
[1:00:51] should say I made Abram rich save only
[1:00:54] that which the young man eat.
[1:00:56] Notice
[1:00:59] this Melchazdc
[1:01:02] as soon as he met Abraham coming from
[1:01:05] the slaughter of the kings. The mystery
[1:01:07] of God now being made known. Who was he?
[1:01:11] Nobody. They can't find any history of
[1:01:13] him because he didn't have any father.
[1:01:17] He didn't have any mother.
[1:01:19] Amen.
[1:01:20] He never had any time. He began. He
[1:01:23] never had any time he'd ever die.
[1:01:25] Amen. Amen.
[1:01:26] So ever who he was is still alive.
[1:01:29] He never did have a beginning.
[1:01:31] So he couldn't have been nobody else but
[1:01:33] llo Elohim,
[1:01:36] self-existence, self-abiding.
[1:01:39] Almighty God,
[1:01:41] Jesus had a father. Jesus had a mother.
[1:01:45] Jesus had a beginning of days. Jesus had
[1:01:48] an ending of earthly life. But this man
[1:01:50] had neither father nor mother. Amen.
[1:01:53] Amen.
[1:01:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:55] Amen.
[1:01:58] No father nor mother. Jesus had both
[1:02:02] father and mother.
[1:02:03] Amen.
[1:02:04] This man had neither father.
[1:02:07] Amen.
[1:02:08] And what did he do after the battle is
[1:02:12] over? After Abraham
[1:02:16] had took his position.
[1:02:20] After the church takes its position,
[1:02:23] hallelujah,
[1:02:24] we're called to the adoption of sons.
[1:02:27] Oh, amen.
[1:02:28] By the Holy Spirit, and when each man
[1:02:31] takes his position, what God has called
[1:02:34] him to do and stand to the end of the
[1:02:37] road.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:38] Amen.
[1:02:40] Going after the lost.
[1:02:43] First, Paul takes all the scar out of
[1:02:45] it. Now, if you're called, if you're not
[1:02:47] just worked up in your mind with some
[1:02:49] kind of theology, if you're really born
[1:02:52] of the spirit, then God predestinated
[1:02:55] you before the foundation will put your
[1:02:57] name on the lamb's book of life. And now
[1:03:00] we come together to set in heavenly
[1:03:01] places in Christ Jesus, a holy people, a
[1:03:04] holy nation, a peculiar people, royal
[1:03:07] priesthood, offering spiritual
[1:03:10] sacrifices unto God. That is the fruits
[1:03:13] of our lips giving praise to his name.
[1:03:15] Bless the Lord.
[1:03:16] People come and say, "That people are
[1:03:18] crazy." Sure they are. The wisdom of God
[1:03:21] is foolish to man. The wisdom of man is
[1:03:23] foolish to God.
[1:03:25] The contrary one to the other. But a
[1:03:27] real spiritfilled church full of power
[1:03:30] of God sitting together in heavenly
[1:03:32] places offering spiritual sacrifices,
[1:03:35] praises of God, the Holy Spirit moving
[1:03:38] among them, discerning sin and calling
[1:03:40] out the things that's among them. It's
[1:03:42] wrong, straightened out, making it devil
[1:03:45] because why? Always in the presence of
[1:03:48] God is that bloody sacrifice.
[1:03:52] Amen.
[1:03:54] I remember we went through it this
[1:03:56] morning. You wasn't saved by the blood.
[1:03:58] You're kept saved by the blood.
[1:04:01] But you were saved by grace through
[1:04:05] faith, believing it.
[1:04:07] God knocked at your heart because he
[1:04:09] predestinated you. You looked up and
[1:04:12] believed it, accepted it. Now, the blood
[1:04:15] makes an atonement for your sins.
[1:04:18] Remember I said God does not condemn a
[1:04:21] sinner for sinning.
[1:04:23] He's a sinner to begin with.
[1:04:26] He condemns a Christian for sinning
[1:04:30] and then because he has condemning
[1:04:32] Christ tuck our condemnation.
[1:04:35] So there's no condemnation to them which
[1:04:37] are in Christ Jesus that walk not after
[1:04:39] the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:04:41] Amen.
[1:04:42] And if you do anything wrong that isn't
[1:04:44] willfully. You don't sin willfully. A
[1:04:46] man that sins willfully goes out
[1:04:48] willfully sins never come into that body
[1:04:50] yet.
[1:04:50] Amen. But a man that's once in there,
[1:04:53] he's dead and his life is hidden. God
[1:04:55] through Christ, sealed by the Holy
[1:04:57] Ghost, and the devil can't even find
[1:04:58] him.
[1:04:59] He's so far back in there.
[1:05:02] He'll have to come out of there before
[1:05:04] the devil can ever get him. For you are
[1:05:06] dead.
[1:05:07] Amen.
[1:05:07] Tell a dead man he's a hypocrite and see
[1:05:09] what happens.
[1:05:11] Kick him on the side and say, "You old
[1:05:13] hypocrite, you he'll not say a word."
[1:05:16] That's right. He'll just lay there. And
[1:05:18] a man that's dead in Christ, you can
[1:05:20] call him hypocrite, call him anything
[1:05:21] you want to. He'll never rise up about
[1:05:24] it.
[1:05:24] Amen.
[1:05:25] If anything, you sit on somewhere and
[1:05:26] pray for you.
[1:05:28] That's right.
[1:05:30] But oh, some of them is very much alive.
[1:05:33] That's what I think about. We're
[1:05:35] supposed to bury dead people.
[1:05:37] Amen.
[1:05:38] Damn. It's dead in Christ. We bury them
[1:05:39] in water. Sometimes we bury too many
[1:05:42] people. It's alive.
[1:05:44] Too much malice and strife and it's too
[1:05:46] much in the church. Help us, Jesus.
[1:05:48] But we can't separate that that God
[1:05:49] does. He knows his people.
[1:05:52] He knows his sheep. He knows every
[1:05:54] voice.
[1:05:55] He knows his children.
[1:05:57] He knows who he can call out. He knows
[1:05:59] who he's predestinated. He knows who
[1:06:01] he's given these things to. What he's
[1:06:04] making himself known to, how he God can
[1:06:07] put confidence in his children on what
[1:06:08] to do, knowing that they will do it.
[1:06:11] Exactly. You believe God does that?
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:14] Why? Satan said to to Job one day said
[1:06:17] to God one day, "Yeah, you got a
[1:06:19] servant." God said, "There's none in the
[1:06:21] earth like him. He's a perfect man."
[1:06:23] Amen.
[1:06:24] Had confidence in him. Satan said, "Oh
[1:06:26] yes, he's got everything easy. Let me
[1:06:28] have him little while I make him cuss
[1:06:30] you to your face." He said, "It's your
[1:06:32] hands, but don't you take his life."
[1:06:34] Amen.
[1:06:35] And he done everything but take his
[1:06:37] life. But oh, Job and stood out. What
[1:06:40] did he do? Did he cuss God when God tuck
[1:06:43] his children when he done all these evil
[1:06:44] things to him and everything? Job didn't
[1:06:46] question. He fell on his face and
[1:06:49] worshiped.
[1:06:52] Hallelujah.
[1:06:54] Cuz the Lord gave and the Lord taken
[1:06:57] away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:59] Amen.
[1:07:01] Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] There you are. God know his trust in
[1:07:05] Job.
[1:07:07] God knows how much he can trust you. He
[1:07:09] knows how much he can trust me. But what
[1:07:12] we're speaking of now is placing this
[1:07:15] child. Now when the Bible when the
[1:07:17] battle is all over, when everything is
[1:07:20] finished, then what is the next thing we
[1:07:22] do? What is the thing we do after the
[1:07:25] battle is over? Did you know what we do?
[1:07:27] We meet Melzdc.
[1:07:31] Amen.
[1:07:32] Let's turn uh Matthew 16:16
[1:07:35] right quick.
[1:07:38] See if that's right or not.
[1:07:41] St. Matthew 16th chapter and 16th verse.
[1:07:45] I'm pretty sure that's right.
[1:07:49] Matthew 16:16.
[1:08:10] Matthew 6. No, that's wrong. Couldn't be
[1:08:13] that close. 26:26.
[1:08:18] Oh, 16. Here he's talking to sign
[1:08:19] people. Pardon me. I didn't mean to say
[1:08:21] that. 2626. Cause just last supper.
[1:08:24] That's what I'm trying to get to you.
[1:08:29] Matthew the 26th chapter.
[1:08:33] And this
[1:08:35] 26th verse, now we y here we are at the
[1:08:38] last supper. And as they were eating,
[1:08:43] Jesus took bread and blessed it and
[1:08:47] break it and gave it to his disciples
[1:08:49] and said, "Take and eat. This is my
[1:08:51] body." And he took the cup and gave
[1:08:54] thanks
[1:08:57] and gave it to them, saying, "Drink ye
[1:09:00] all of it, for this is my blood of the
[1:09:04] new testament, for which is shed for
[1:09:08] many, for the remission of sins." S I N
[1:09:14] sins.
[1:09:15] Christians, who does things wrong? All
[1:09:17] right. What? But listen, 29th verse, I
[1:09:23] say unto you, I will not drink
[1:09:25] henceforth of the fruit of the vine
[1:09:28] until that day when I drink it and do
[1:09:30] with you in my father's kingdom.
[1:09:33] Amen.
[1:09:35] Hallelujah. What the same thing Melzdc
[1:09:38] did after Abraham had got his position,
[1:09:42] set his men in order and won the battle
[1:09:45] and he come home and Melzdc come out
[1:09:48] with bread and wine.
[1:09:52] Amen.
[1:09:53] After the battle's over,
[1:09:56] then we'll eat the wedding supper with
[1:09:59] the Lord Jesus in the new world.
[1:10:03] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. All
[1:10:05] right.
[1:10:06] The mysteries of his will according
[1:10:10] to his good pleasure. Back over now
[1:10:12] again in Ephesians 9.
[1:10:16] Which he has purposed in himself. That
[1:10:19] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:10:22] time.
[1:10:24] Remember that we just passed over it.
[1:10:27] Ephesians
[1:10:29] first chapter 10th verse. that in the
[1:10:32] dispensation of the fullness of time.
[1:10:36] Now we learned that the fullness of time
[1:10:39] is waiting for what? The fullness of all
[1:10:42] time. The time that when sin will cease.
[1:10:46] A time when death will cease.
[1:10:48] A time when sickness will cease. A time
[1:10:51] when sin will cease. A time when all of
[1:10:55] the perversions that perverted things
[1:10:57] that the devil has perverted will cease.
[1:11:01] when time itself shall cease.
[1:11:06] Watch
[1:11:08] that in the denment station of the
[1:11:10] fullness of time, that he might gather
[1:11:13] in one all things in
[1:11:16] Christ, both which are in heaven and
[1:11:20] which are on the earth, even in him,
[1:11:23] together all things through Christ.
[1:11:26] As I said this morning, all the little
[1:11:29] nuggets that we find, these great little
[1:11:32] things, you can polish them in Genesis,
[1:11:35] you can polish them in Exodus, you can
[1:11:37] polish them in Leviticus and bring them
[1:11:39] through and in Revelations, they'll end
[1:11:41] up being Jesus.
[1:11:43] You take Joseph, you take Abraham, you
[1:11:45] take Isaac, you take Jacob, you take
[1:11:47] David, you take any of those nuggets,
[1:11:50] those men of God, and see if you don't
[1:11:52] see Jesus Christ displayed in each one
[1:11:54] of them.
[1:11:55] Amen. Amen.
[1:11:57] That he might gather all things
[1:12:00] into one Christ Jesus.
[1:12:02] Now a little farther now.
[1:12:06] Now the 11th verse. In whom also we have
[1:12:10] obtained
[1:12:12] an inheritance.
[1:12:16] Oh, an inheritance. Somebody has to
[1:12:19] leave you something to inherit it. Is
[1:12:21] that right?
[1:12:22] Amen.
[1:12:23] An inheritance. What inheritance do we
[1:12:25] have? What inheritance did I have? I
[1:12:27] didn't have any.
[1:12:30] But God left me an inheritance
[1:12:33] when he put my name on the lamb's book
[1:12:34] of life before the foundation of the
[1:12:36] world.
[1:12:37] Oh, you say now wait a minute, brother.
[1:12:38] Jesus did that when he died for you. No,
[1:12:40] he never. Jesus come to purchase that
[1:12:43] inheritance for me.
[1:12:46] Read the very next ver very next line.
[1:12:50] in whom we also have obtain a par
[1:12:53] obtained an inheritance being
[1:12:56] predestinated.
[1:12:58] Amen.
[1:12:59] According
[1:13:01] to the purpose of him who workketh all
[1:13:04] things after the council of his own good
[1:13:07] will.
[1:13:07] Amen. God before the foundation of the
[1:13:10] world as we've tuck it down through the
[1:13:13] lesson you people how we seen God was
[1:13:16] self-existence how that in him was love
[1:13:20] in him was to be God there was nothing
[1:13:22] to worship him in him was to be a father
[1:13:25] he was by himself in him was to be a
[1:13:28] savior nothing lost in him was to be a
[1:13:31] healer that's the attributes of him
[1:13:34] there was nothing there so his own self
[1:13:37] his own good counsel produce these
[1:13:40] things
[1:13:41] that he might through this one man
[1:13:43] Christ Jesus gather all together again
[1:13:49] oh
[1:13:51] I has not seen ears not no wonder it's a
[1:13:55] mysterious thing
[1:13:56] look has predestinated us unto this
[1:14:00] inheritance
[1:14:03] if I'm a right inheritance of something
[1:14:06] if God is knocking my heart and saying,
[1:14:08] William Brandham,
[1:14:11] I called you a long time ago before the
[1:14:13] foundation of the world to preach the
[1:14:14] gospel.
[1:14:16] I have an inheritance,
[1:14:19] an inheritance of eternal life. Now, God
[1:14:22] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:14:25] to me because there was nothing I could
[1:14:27] do to to inherit it.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:29] Amen.
[1:14:30] It was blank. It was valid.
[1:14:32] Amen.
[1:14:33] There's nothing I could do. But in the
[1:14:36] fullness of time, God standing in his
[1:14:40] own good time, Jesus the lamb slain from
[1:14:43] the foundation of the world, his blood
[1:14:45] was shed that I might go to my
[1:14:48] inheritance.
[1:14:50] Amen.
[1:14:51] To be what? What inheritance? The
[1:14:53] sunship.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:55] To be a son of God.
[1:14:57] Amen.
[1:14:59] And now this may just choke you to
[1:15:01] death,
[1:15:03] but did you know that men that are sons
[1:15:05] of God are amateur gods?
[1:15:09] How many ever know that?
[1:15:12] How many knows that Jesus said so?
[1:15:14] Amen.
[1:15:15] The Bible Jesus said, "Did not your law
[1:15:18] say itself that you are gods?" Amen.
[1:15:20] Amen.
[1:15:21] And if you call them gods, which God
[1:15:25] said in Genesis 2, that they were gods
[1:15:28] because they were had full domain over
[1:15:31] the dominion of the world. He gave him
[1:15:34] dominion over all things. And he lost
[1:15:36] his godship.
[1:15:38] He lost his sunship. He lost his domain.
[1:15:43] And Satan took it over.
[1:15:46] But rather,
[1:15:47] Amen. We're waiting for the
[1:15:50] manifestations
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:54] of the sons of God who will come back
[1:15:56] and take over again.
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:16:00] Amen.
[1:16:01] Waiting for the fullness of time when
[1:16:04] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[1:16:07] full sons of God will be manifested.
[1:16:10] When the power of God will walk out.
[1:16:13] Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] I will take every power that Satan's got
[1:16:17] away from me.
[1:16:19] Yes, sir.
[1:16:21] Belongs to me.
[1:16:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:24] He's the logist of God. That is true.
[1:16:28] That was the son of God. Then he made
[1:16:31] man that little God. And he said, "If
[1:16:34] they call those who the word of God came
[1:16:36] to, the prophets, if they call them
[1:16:39] gods, who the word of God came to," and
[1:16:42] God said so himself that they were gods.
[1:16:46] He told Moses, "I made you a god."
[1:16:51] And made Aaron your prophet.
[1:16:55] Amen.
[1:17:00] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:02] I may act like a religious crank, but
[1:17:04] I'm not.
[1:17:07] Oh, when your eyes can come open and see
[1:17:10] those things.
[1:17:12] All right. He made man a god.
[1:17:17] A god in his domain. And his domain goes
[1:17:21] from sea to sea, from shore to shore.
[1:17:25] Lord,
[1:17:26] he has a control of it.
[1:17:28] And when Jesus came being the one God
[1:17:32] without sin, he proved it.
[1:17:35] When the winds blowed, he said, "Peace
[1:17:37] be still."
[1:17:39] Amen.
[1:17:42] And when the trees, no man eat from
[1:17:44] thee, verily I say unto you, you that's
[1:17:47] little gods, if you'll say to this
[1:17:50] mountain, be moved, and don't doubt in
[1:17:51] your heart, but believe that what you've
[1:17:52] said will come to pass, you can have
[1:17:54] what you've said.
[1:17:56] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:58] Go right back to Genesis to the
[1:18:00] original. What is it now? The world and
[1:18:02] nature is groaning, crying,
[1:18:06] everything's a moving what? For the
[1:18:08] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:18:13] When true sons,
[1:18:15] born sons,
[1:18:17] fil sons
[1:18:19] speak into the word is that
[1:18:22] I believe we're on the border of it
[1:18:24] right now.
[1:18:24] Amen.
[1:18:26] Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:18:27] Say to this mountain, "Let it be so."
[1:18:30] Brother, I I desire so and so a certain
[1:18:33] thing done. I'm a believer in Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ. I give it to you in the name of
[1:18:38] the Lord.
[1:18:38] Amen.
[1:18:39] Amen.
[1:18:40] Amen.
[1:18:40] There's a manifestation.
[1:18:42] Yes.
[1:18:43] Oh, brother, my crops are burning up out
[1:18:45] there. I haven't had any rain. I'll send
[1:18:48] your rain in the name of the Lord now.
[1:18:51] Come.
[1:18:51] Amen.
[1:18:52] Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature. Amen.
[1:18:57] Waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:19:00] sons of God. God orained it at the
[1:19:03] beginning. He gave man the domain. He
[1:19:06] gave Jesus Christ that Jesus gave you
[1:19:08] the name with this assurance. Ask the
[1:19:10] father anything in my name and I'll do
[1:19:12] it.
[1:19:14] Amen.
[1:19:16] Oh, brother Palmer.
[1:19:20] Waiting for the manifestations
[1:19:23] of the sons of God. the position the
[1:19:26] church as I said the book of Ephesians
[1:19:29] is the book of Joshua in Joshua placing
[1:19:32] the people where they belong now if they
[1:19:35] wouldn't stand still they put Ephraim
[1:19:37] here were on Manasses land and this come
[1:19:40] back and fuss and steward how they ever
[1:19:43] going to get along when one said I'm a
[1:19:45] Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a
[1:19:47] Pentecostal I'm one this I'm two this
[1:19:48] I'm so how you going to do it
[1:19:52] stand still Yeah.
[1:19:55] God's will to place his church.
[1:19:57] Amen.
[1:19:58] Sons and daughters of God.
[1:20:00] Yes.
[1:20:01] God, let me live to see it. It's my
[1:20:03] prayer.
[1:20:05] So close that I can just feel it with my
[1:20:07] hands. Almost looking just right there.
[1:20:10] That's what I've longed to see.
[1:20:13] Waiting for the time we walk down the
[1:20:15] street. There lays a laying
[1:20:17] there from his mother's womb. Silver and
[1:20:19] gold have I none.
[1:20:22] Oh,
[1:20:23] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:20:25] sons of God.
[1:20:27] Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] When God will make himself known.
[1:20:31] When they'll stop sickness. They'll stop
[1:20:34] cancer. They'll stop diseases. You think
[1:20:37] cancer is something? The Bible said
[1:20:38] there's coming a time when man will rot
[1:20:40] right in their flesh into buzzers.
[1:20:42] They'll eat off their carcasses before
[1:20:44] they even die.
[1:20:46] Cancer is a toothache to what's coming.
[1:20:49] But remember that horrible thing was
[1:20:52] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[1:20:53] had the seal of God.
[1:20:55] That's what we're striving for now.
[1:20:58] To get in and be positionally placed
[1:21:00] into the kingdom of God before this
[1:21:02] horrible plagues strike.
[1:21:06] Oh, how good
[1:21:08] the dispensation of time, fullness of
[1:21:10] time, the inheritance
[1:21:14] in whom we also obtain inheritance being
[1:21:18] predestinated.
[1:21:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank God for his
[1:21:37] word tonight. That's so so good. It
[1:21:42] really gives us something to look
[1:21:43] forward to
[1:21:45] and believe up to.
[1:21:48] Believe that with all my heart that um
[1:21:54] cancer
[1:21:56] and sickness,
[1:21:58] of course, he's not talking about the
[1:22:00] millennium.
[1:22:02] says there won't be that he's talking
[1:22:03] about here on this side manifestation of
[1:22:06] the sons and the daughters of God. I
[1:22:10] want to find my place in there. Don't
[1:22:13] you?
[1:22:14] I want the Holy Spirit to let my spirit
[1:22:16] stay put, stand still so God can place
[1:22:20] me positionally where he wants me. Amen.
[1:22:24] God bless you richly. I missed those um
[1:22:28] requests, but we want to remember
[1:22:30] um of course, Brother Noriega, he's 82
[1:22:34] years old. I think he'll be 83 in
[1:22:36] August. Also, brother
[1:22:39] uh uh Roland McGraw, he's 85
[1:22:43] and he'll be 86 in August as well. We'll
[1:22:47] keep them in prayer. Um Sister Lorie
[1:22:51] Snow is coming back. I want to pray that
[1:22:53] the Lord will completely restore her
[1:22:56] back and give her strength as she's as
[1:22:58] she travels back. There was one more,
[1:23:01] Brother Joe,
[1:23:03] Sister Chris Green. The Lord will touch
[1:23:05] her and her body.
[1:23:09] She's low on her soul. Yes. The Lord
[1:23:12] will touch her, touch my wife Sharon,
[1:23:15] and um she's not feeling too well. and
[1:23:19] um and that um the Lord would just bless
[1:23:22] each and every one of us. Is there
[1:23:23] anyone that has a request you'd like to
[1:23:25] make known tonight? Amen. Spoken
[1:23:28] request. Let's all stand to our feet and
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:35] trust the Lord.
[1:23:37] Amen.
[1:23:39] What's that play? There's no secret what
[1:23:42] God can do. Let's sing that. There is no
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:51] what God
[1:23:53] can do.
[1:23:55] [Music]
[1:23:58] What he's done for others,
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] he'll do for you.
[1:24:12] It's wide open.
[1:24:15] [Music]
[1:24:17] He'll pardon
[1:24:20] you.
[1:24:24] It is no secret
[1:24:30] what God can do. One more time. It is no
[1:24:35] secret.
[1:24:37] It is no secret
[1:24:43] what God can do.
[1:24:50] What he's done for others,
[1:24:56] he knows for you.
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:04] was what
[1:25:07] I
[1:25:09] heard
[1:25:12] you.
[1:25:16] It is no secret
[1:25:22] what God can do.
[1:25:27] Amen. I I have a prayer request and that
[1:25:30] would be I want to read a scripture in
[1:25:32] Acts chapter I think it's 17.
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:49] Oh my. Let's see. I can find it here.
[1:25:53] Yes. Acts 17
[1:25:57] and verse
[1:25:59] number 11 and 12.
[1:26:05] Of course, this is the Apostle Paul
[1:26:06] going around in his missionary journey.
[1:26:09] And if we can get that on the screen,
[1:26:12] that would be good. Thank you. The
[1:26:14] scripture says
[1:26:16] these were more noble than those in
[1:26:18] Thessalonica
[1:26:20] in that they received the word with all
[1:26:22] readiness of mind and search the
[1:26:25] scriptures daily whether those things
[1:26:27] were so. Therefore many of them believed
[1:26:31] also honorable women which were Greeks
[1:26:35] and of men not a few. And that's my
[1:26:37] desire that I that you would be more
[1:26:42] noble and that you would take a series
[1:26:45] like this and the message says that we
[1:26:48] hear the prophet brings to us and then
[1:26:51] we would with all readiness of mind and
[1:26:54] receive it with all of our heart. And
[1:26:56] that's my prayer for each of you. That
[1:26:58] God will settle us deeper into his word,
[1:27:01] deeper into a revelation, and that God
[1:27:04] will pour out his Holy Spirit upon each
[1:27:06] and every one of us from our young ones
[1:27:09] all the way up to the oldest ones. Amen.
[1:27:11] That's my prayer. That's a request that
[1:27:13] I have for this church, for my own life
[1:27:16] and for your life as well. Amen. So, let
[1:27:19] us pray. God bless you. You can come
[1:27:21] forward and pray. You can pray right at
[1:27:23] your seat. Bless you.

[1:45:16] word mystery and search it. So just a
[1:45:21] reminder there I think that'll be a
[1:45:22] blessing to you. Let's see what number
[1:45:25] that is.
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:33] Once my heart and soul were fed

[1:45:42] by
[1:45:44] the binding chain of sin,
