========================================
up our Bibles and stand as we go into the fifth seal here take a portion of it here this morning God bless each of you let's bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for

for the opportunity to come Lord forgive us of all of our shortcomings and our sins Lord Purge us Lord and prepare us father to hear your word anointed we pray anoint our hearing we ask in Jesus name we pray amen amen in Revelations chapter 6 we're on the fifth seal verse number nine and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how Longo Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until the fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as there they were should be fulfilled amen let's sing only believe [Music] only believe only believe that all things are possible only Bel only [Music] be all [Music] believe all things are possible only be bless you may be seated brother Brandon now we see that the Devils changing four um four Beast meant what power they was revealed uh to the what power how he revealed to the world and how they ended on his pale death horse now let's look at God's powers of this Beast to combat them the first Beast of God that he went out to meet the Antichrist with the Antichrist Spirit when it's said it's just his teaching now remember when the Antichrist first road he was in a Teaching Ministry the Antichrist rolled first in a Teaching Ministry and what's the one that went to Mee him the line the line of the tribe of Judah which is the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went to Mee himl that's the reason we had an irus and a polyart and and and and and uh those fellas of St Martin when that Antichrist was riding with his false teaching God sent his teaching out the word the line of the tribe of Judah which is the word made manifest in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and the Holy Spirit there to manifest himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions and power is because it was The Living Word in the farm of the line of the tribe of Judah right now to combat that amen now you got it he sends his power Antichrist God sends his the word Antichrist false teaching the true teaching went with it to combat it that was the first now this was the first church Apostolic that went to me him now the second beast that the Antichrist out was a red Beast which was to he wrote on was to take a pieace and from the earth and and War now the second one that went to comb him was the ox Beast the ox means a labor a beast of burden and um now if we could just stop this let me get let me so you be sure to see this that that's kind of might be a little puzzling to you well let's get thyo here watch and see if it isn't a a a laboring church you see and to the angel of the Church of thara write these things sayth the Son of God who his eyes are like the flames of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy Works see becoming all works now see because that's the the one was riding with and charity and service see it's all just and faith and patience and thy works again twice thy works and the last to be more than the first see that shows that the thyra age after the Antichrist got settle down and come into the thyra age the little church could do nothing but just just simply lay and another thing the ox is also is a beast of sacrifice see they give their lives just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages a thousand years there the Catholicism controled the world and they just went right in yes or no they didn't mind dying if it was death that's all right amen they wouldn't died anyhow why the very Spirit of the age that's the reason I'm that's the reason irus that's the reason poar John Paul those great mighty men out there combating that thing Paul saw it he said I know that after my departing if wolves are going to enter in among you Brethren teaching perverse things and'll draw you away look at that Stern little old Apostle standing there his BackBeat full of Stripes his eyes watering but he could see farther than the that scope playing it out down Earth they see 120 million light here's a light space he can see Plumb into eternity there he was and he predicted it and said that's what would take place and said also went on down to the other age to come I notice there he was along after him St John lived the longest and when St John was trying to take all the sacred Epistles Anointed with the Holy Ghost and put them together to make the Bible the Roman Empire CAU him and put him on the aisle of patmas he was out there on the aisle of patmas for the word of God sake polart was helping him translate I read the other day the letter that Mary herself wrote to poar and abiding not arring him but commanding him for being a gallant man that who could teach and accept the teaching of Jesus Christ the who was borned of her from God Mary's own note that she had wrote to pcarp pcarp was fed to the lines you know no he burned it it's too late for aernal line loose in the arena and so they tore down a bathroom and old Bath House IR put him in a in an arena Ena and and burning and on his road coming down he's walking with his head down the Roman Centurion said you're an old man and well respected why don't you denounce that thing he just kept looking towards heaven and a Bo spoke from somewhere they couldn't understand word said poar don't fear I'm with you hallu why he was standing by that word and when they begin to pile the boards on him to burning him there's a heavenly music come down and and the anthems from some Angelic somewhere sang the song he never even one time batted an eye to the father that's Gall man that's man who can stand a Martyrs down Through the Ages there suffered terribly what was the they were under the inspiration the spirit of God the power Hallelujah I don't forget this church and you brother on tape I want you to examine this how could man do anything else besides the power of God that have been released to them I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain Spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them now we'll prove to you by the history of the church and by the the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church responded to the the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else that's right now the first of that line that word that pure unadulterated word the second and thara was the ox and it was a a big burden uh Beast of Burden pardon me and it was also a sacrificial beast and wasn't that exactly the poor little Church of Rome had settled down there to A Thousand Years of Dark Ages and anything that didn't profess to be of the Roman Church was put to death immediately and they had to labor going from place to place you Masons I call your attention you remember the sign of the cross ah you know what I'm talking about yes now notice now if you if you notice that was packing and preserving that Bible see and they had to labor among one another there you are the ox and when it come time we read it last night see when the thing went forth the sacrifice come and they had to go he said don't you hurt the wine and oil what did they do they willingly walked up there and died they didn't be care because the the spirit of the church and that they were sacrifice labor and they walked up this say freely as they could walk Anointed with the true spirit of God of that age and died like Heroes as sacrifice thousands times thousands 68 million of them on the record Ox sacrifice oh my do you understand it okay all right now sacrifice it only could labor in that age to combat the great opposition for that 1,000 years now the third Beast that went out from the devil was this uh Black Horse see now the third Beast that went out power from God to combat him to combat the powers of the black horse was a man cunning smart with the wisdom of God you know a man is smarter than any of the Beast he's smarter caus he out witht him mostly he's cunning shrew see and the the age from the Dark Age now coming out from the Dark Age down this other side when this black horse is riding when they charge for their their sacrifices and everything they' done and money just so you know how it was now the next thing went out to combat that was the Beast with the face of a man smart educated shrewd fine anointed but that Spirit of that day you notice it now I went to comb him with a cunningness of God's wisdom with him that was the age of the Reformation Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth see it was a Reformation swinging and uh oh who all Knox Calvin and who all see went out it was a kindness and now you watch exactly from the Dark Age from the Reformation this way watch it was the shrewdness of man you drop your windows just a little bit I be people getting kind of little warm maybe in there if you just pull the windows down it's a little bit C it I know me you're preaching getting hot I you're bound to be out there notice it was the shrewdness of man now you understand that third Beast that Satan sent out he becomes shrew too watch Major wheat for a penny three majors of barley for a penny see oh my see the money-making scheme the shrewdness to get the gold of the world and the wealth to brought into it exactly fulfilled that's what begin to charge for prayers and for made a place called Purgatory play their ancestors out and or you had to will your deeds and everything your property the church was state was the same and the church taking your property over and um don't you see some of these evangelist this they still has that same anointing [Music] on that's right making old people give up their pensions and de their homes over to certain things W brother amen am true I don't want to get on that see but now I stay right with this I look back see where I'm going now notice that man that's up to them that's up to them I don't have one thing to do with me I'm just responsible for this year now notice the the Beast come to combat it now was man and we all know that this Beast of man this power of man in his inter uals recognize that that koser that Martin Luther had in his hand when he was climbing those steps it said this is the blood of Jesus Christ this is the body of Jesus Christ and Luther throw it down and said it's Bread and Wine it's not the body of Christ because it's been exalted in setting at the right hand of God making intercession see wisdom He Man and when John Wesley come along Ed just swingle had come in and Calvin and they got the church to a place on security till they didn't want more revivals whatever was going to be is going to be that was all and they just Liv any kind of lives the Lutheran church is so twisted and the angland church oh my the whole country become corrupt just like it is now the churches Twisted when uh King Henry the VII and come into England and after Bloody Mary and all these things taking place and then the church was so full of violence and Corruption man claiming Christianity and living with four or five wives or doing anything they wanted to do and carrying on and filth John Wesley studying the scripture and watch it it was reveal to him that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies a Believer and you shouldn't then what did he do he come out in another Reformation he saved the world in his day like Luther did see what was it that man beast power going on give man wisdom of understanding that the thing is wrong that isn't the blood of Jesus Christ that isn't the the body of Jesus Christ that represents the body that's a still great fuss between Catholic and Protestant now it's the only thing you can't get together on right now everything else didn't get together on with that these counsil are having notice now but this but they couldn't get together on that see that one is the blood and says it's a literal blood that the priest has the power to change this bread to the literal Body of Christ that's what the little Tabernacle is in the the church you know that reason they make signs and any kind of pagan offer is they go by you know and bow theirself and Kip their hats and so forth that is not to the building it's to that c that's in the the Tabernacle and notice how Satan trly pull that but see at that time upon the man's being see God put a spirit of wisdom upon man to understand that's wrong now that was to combat the third Beast that had got the church so corrupt that he was riding that it was terrible the reformers uh uh what did they do then they in the Farmers age they brought the church from its pagan ceremonies of idolatry back to God again see that's what the Beast went for that kind man Rider to do it now but read now verse three and Revelations 3 and two just a minute I got it marked down here for some reason now this is comes in now the Lutheran age in the reformers age Revelations 3 and 2 what they did they organized as soon as Luther got his church started on he organized it all right same thing Wesley did same thing Pentecost did exactly organize it and what do they do they take up the same system that they come out of see I watch this Revelation speaking of this Sardis Church to the angelist church is the first verse of course see Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that is the word word that you've been taught see the things that remain that are ready to die he's right then ready to start back in an organization just like the Catholic Church you come out of see for I have not found thy works perfect before God there you go there's the there it goes right back again don't you see why organizational systems is wrong who started did God did the apostles the Roman Catholic Church did it now just let any historians say different it's not there they are they say they're the mother church and they are but they organize the thing and put a system with man's head to it we didn't take one man like they did we take a whole Council of man put them together then you really got a confusion that's right yeah how can a council anyhow it's just like we think democracy is right I believe it is too but it'll never work right you can't with a bunch of Ricky around here to run it how in the world you going to get it right can notice the real thing was a Godly King notice the Beast the third Beast now was a cunningness of a man he representing the reformers that went forth from the idol of taking say this is the bread this is the wine see the Antichrist is still got something symbolizes Christianity he's got to because he's against you see and then if he's got to be against something if he come all along say well I'm a Buddha well that has got nothing to all do that's just a heathen to begin with but the Antichrist is cunning he's got all kinds of things that represents Christianity want God to off on the other side something against the original doctrine of it see that's what may seem Antichrist see so the reformers when the Beast went forth in the form of a of a man to combat that I don't forget this class don't forget it see remember all the days of your life see these beasts are correct it's thus sayth the Lord notice idolatry brought the the man Beast went forth with the power of God by wisdom that God gave him and brought the church from idolatry back to God but in the we find out in that same church age when they started to denominate to do the same thing that they did in the beginning Rome did now she's going to make daughters to that church and what does she say said now that you're I haven't found you perfect and you got the strength in that little strength you got left now now listen to him warn him in Revelations again 3:3 that's get well I believe I got it just a few minutes ago remember from how thou H has received and heard and hold fast and repent just otherwise remember that you come out of such a corruption as that amen see and look here if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come unto thee as a thief huh and thou shalt know and thou shal not know what hour I will cometh upon thee on down he's going to move the Candlestick see so that's it what is the light of the church and she went right into the same organizational system of pagan darkness that she come out of and there she remains today well honest hearted people thinking that that's the truth just the same as Catholics are and the Protestants like the Catholic one that's a six of one a half a dozen the other exactly according to the Lord man's with you [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h

coming up and the choir coming together to sing again we look forward to that and um I'll do a little bit of traveling I'll be back Sunday but and I'm here this week but we leave on Thursday to go to Sacramento to have a uh the final service there for my brother Jay and just keep us in prayer for that appreciate it in Genesis 24 verse number one and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of Earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but Thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto him pre-venture the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I need bring thy son again unto the land from when thou camest and Abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son there there again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then amen Luke chapter 14 in verse 16 and then he said unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent be to make excuse the first one said unto him I have brought a piece of ground and I must need go see it I pray thee have me excuse another one said I've brought five Yol of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused another said I have married a wife therefore I cannot come so that servant came showed his Lord the things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and the lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor the MIM and the Halt and the Blind and that servant said Lord it is done as thou has commanded yet there is room the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come and that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon your word blessings upon your people we pray we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated we're going to take just for a moment uh this morning to speak of the subject or the title is Lord I'm at your service Lord I'm at your service and we're speaking of this model servant eleazer the model servant brother random calls him the model servant of the Bible Lord I'm at your service and this is really what the Lord wants to hear from all of us today is Lord I'm at your service you know a servant a faithful servant is um very hard to find very hard to find a faithful servant you can find a lot of people that are willing to go but they'll have an agenda behind it and they'll be a part of something and they'll attachs to something but many times these people are looking at what they can get out of it how do I enrich myself how do I EMB better myself but a faithful servant has instructions to follow the one who is sending him I like how Jesus says it in St John Chapter 13 we usually read it during our communion service let's take it there quickly that he that is sent the servant is not greater than his Lord can we turn there quickly we got time St John Chapter 13 and verse number 13 you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I've done to you so he gave us an example to follow him verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him so this sending the servant has to be sent and every one of us have been sent with a commission and that mission is much bigger than us you know we get embarrassed at what we believe many times because we're we're too focused on our ourselves and I think that's part of the problem is that we're embarrassed on how it's going to make us look but it's not about us he sent us to represent something so much bigger than us we're just simply Messengers we're placed here for a purpose we have a motive we have a goal that he has for our lives and when we can keep that Focus zeroed in properly our praise our worship and everything we'll do will be healthy it'll be it'll be stabilized won't be no funny rubs or funny feelings I won't take it hard because you stepped on my toes I will I'm a human being but you know that's part of the deal part of the deal is that some folks will step on your toes they won't like you because they didn't like him they're going to reject you because they rejected him and that's part of the package that's the reality of of it you're called to this work as a servant we don't send ourselves we are sent by something greater than ourselves the one that sends us that's who we're responsible to and this um model servant of the Bible elzer will take him just for a moment uh for a subject this morning this is what came up on my heart yesterday and uh I trust we can deliver it to you this morning this um scripture that we read in Luke chapter 14 is a scripture that brother bandam uses when he preaches the message is your life worthy of the Gospel so here a great man is making a feast for his son a great wedding and then he bids people to come and with one cons one consent they begin to make excuses as to why they can't even come um this um is your life is worthy of the Gospel it highlights a number of things in that message um and maybe what I'll do is um before I go in there because I didn't give you these sis in the back but in the message um ashamed brother brandom is dealing with this eleazer and how the Lord revealed to him that he his message was a type of the elaser and so in the order of things in 1963 Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother vom releases the threefold mystery that God had hid in the back part of his mind and this mystery is the foundation of why we have to go through what we go through what we're doing what church is all about this is a Plan of Redemption you're included into it you're part of it and it it was hid in his mind and then he revealed It Through the Ages can I get a witness and so this is Christ's great mystery he Reveals His threefold purpose and then one year later in the message the Masterpiece he went to California to pay tribute to Amy simple mcferon a woman preacher and her life and while in there he went in Forest Lawn to see this great statue of Moses and that struck him and touched him and it brought forth this message the Masterpiece in the message the Masterpiece he that was July of 64 he reveals that earlier in the year July the 3 he had a vision and this is the first time we see this vision of the Bride played it here many times it's about seven minutes eight minutes or so and I want to play that vision for you one more time this morning if we can get that ready sis um it's in the message to Masterpiece paragraph number 186 and I think I gave you where to where to stop it too so God bless you I got seven minutes to tell you something that happened day before yesterday to get out on time July the third I was over here sitting in the this Center over here shopping center right out from the sh I've been in pig alley in Rome in France and I've been New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see them amongst them people I sat there to my heart AE and the Lord had gave me a vision now I'm going to tell the vision I don't know what I can interpreted but I I'm going to tell the vision for my first time I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just the voice and uh I looked and as I I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for a preview I look coming to me and I seen the most the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women it look kind of I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at a clock why are you looking for I'm looking for people looking at people why are you looking at I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm telling the truth that's what I see now I can only say what I seen I don't I don't know what it all about it I just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at uh the one was talking to me and I standing together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like you could been a dozen or more just I don't know how many was a breast but there just a group of and she passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her as she passed by he said now we shall review said that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come I notice Sam coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a noise and it said next said Here Comes the American group now I am an American but this this made me sick I am not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place uh uh uh and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had a something on an order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper and make an old fly bush how many remembers you know well I think you Us in carnivals you know hanging down like a fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this holding blow them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and Fry looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity now the paper was what was ho in front of them but when they pass the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church and there she went and they were singing this year twisting Roll songs you know what you call going down sing going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and this witch the my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's a she's that World Council of churches leading him right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that car like got walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I look and here they come again and they passed by a sweet looking little ladies that's all looking around at me as say pass by I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched him and then as he started leaving two or three of them in the back car to get out of step and I was going to holler at him and they trying to get back and step again and I seen him just the vision just fade out and change from now here is the interpretation thereof the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I don't I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seene the second both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were D dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and old makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that representing the bride coming out of all Nations see each one represent a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word see then I have to watch her she'll get out of Step of that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever it is watch they was getting back trying their best getting back this getting line is looking out somewhere else watching about that church and just went out of and to chaos but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side it looked like was trying to get back in line as he went by as this passed me Old Forest here at the wall pass me I was standing there and then I just seen all move out and leave but you notice the church only came into to view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice see see what it was now I'm not aning but look at with my message this morning not knowing that see we can say praise the Lord how many can you really say praise the Lord the Lord now that was a vision concerning you and I that's a vision for the first time that was released to the people as brother brandham is relating that experience uh to the people about this vision of this bride coming forth twice and um that is pretty tremendous when you look at in throughout the message he only um identifies the Bride As the Alpha and Omega because of this Vision that he gave and he does that in the message the Masterpiece he says this here in paragraph 198 in the message the Masterpiece he says all others never appear no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture had made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden he took a piece from and made another piece and that was marred and Fa now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten in order that part that was smitten was in order to bring back again that Masterpiece again so the Masterpiece and the Son of God the Masterpiece and the bride and it's a piece of himym which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord can you say Amen so we see that the bride is now Alpha and Omega she came back twice showing that the Bride of the last day would be a piece of the word bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh we are word from beginning to the end this is what we're becoming a part of the word that's the most important part of the service really is the sacred part is the preaching and the ministering of his word word becoming life upon your life becomes your testimony not just the Bible out there but the Bible in here down in your soul and you become one with it and so this model servant very simple message this morning this model servant was eleazer um we don't hear too much about him we hear more about Abraham and Abraham's promises that God made to him that he'd have a son Isaac we hear more and more about Abraham and how God would bless his seed and and here Abraham is coming to the point of death the Lord is warning him of that and now he has to go find a bride for his son not ishmail but for his son Isaac the promised son so he's going to take this responsibility and lay it in the hands of a faithful servant so elzer you're going to be my eyes you're going to be my discernment you're going to be my heart you're G to go where I'm not going to go but I want you to swear to me that you'll call a bride from this area this location she's got to be related to me she got to be willing to go and she's got to have the character so this was the tremendous responsibility if you if you think of it this this young man um gentleman elaser of Damascus if you read another scripture um some say that he was acquired maybe as a servant in in Abraham's lifetime whatever it was um Abraham was considering that this would be the heir in his house he was thinking that this eleazer would fall air to him and the Lord revealed to him no it's not going to be elzer but I'm going to give you a son even in your old age so this is a very faithful man this eleazer of Damascus this was the very faithful individual that Abraham would think to entrust this great decision to and so we see him appear in Genesis chapter 24 now just take your Bibles real quick again and let's read verses 12- 15 as eleazer is now on his his journey to go pick a bride for Abraham it's almost easier to make a decision for yourself because if you mess up well it's my bad I'll eat the cost I'll take the hit but when but when you're going on in representation for somebody greater than you and you're spending their money and you're you're using their name and you're going in their under their um uh power then there's a little more stress because if you mess up everyone's going to know about it everyone's going to know that you missed the mark and so but eleazer I like what he does in verses number 12 he he said he begins to pray first he takes these 10 camels to a country he's never been before verse 11 and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by the will of water and at the time of evening even the time that women go out to draw water so he goes to a place where the women are going to be drawing water he knows the time that they're going to be coming he come from a long journey he's a stranger he places his camels all 10 of them down around the well and then he prays and he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this this day show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water and I don't know who any of these women are these are just women from the city I don't know their last name I don't know who is who or what is what I'm a blind man here but oh Lord show me Grace and show me mercy today and he let and let it come to pass that the damel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thee thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou has appointed for thy servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou H has showed kindness unto my master so he didn't go in the local paper there he didn't go to the local media site or the local you know place where you can find a clean girl find someone to marry for Isaac he goes on his knees I want you to look at the miracle and the chance that this man takes showing up into the City and asking God to answer the prayer for his servant Abraham he's looking for a bride he needs something miraculous to happen something deeper or greater than him must must take place you know the responsibility is on him but now when God gives you an impossible responsibility then he's the one who can make the impossible possible amen so if God is requiring the church to live a clean holy life then the holy God that made the requirement can live that life through the believer today that you can live a clean and holy life amen because that's the requirement we're required to take Jesus's place today we're required to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we're required to preach the gospel we're required to represent this glorious word that is coming our day and that's a tremendous requirement if you really internalize it if you take it seriously then you know some people are looking for an excuse like these servants I gotta go I got to go I got to do this I can't do that right now well I tried and didn't work but this servant really said he he ask he said if if it doesn't work am am I he says you're released from it I you swear to me if you if you can't find it then then you're released from this oath but swear to me that you won't bring a daughter just from the children of men swear to me that it'll be a quality uh girl for my son Isaac so this burden and this weight and this tremendous responsibility is laid upon him now we know that in the message that brother brandham tells us that um the message ashamed brother brandham he is going through the Public Service Company and he has a dream that he's back at the Public Service Company and he keeps you know getting his money mixed up it's just a dream as a serviceman he got his personal money mixed up with the company's money while he was on the job and so this begin to stress him out and he had this dream one time and then he prayed as Lord what have I done and when the city had uh uh had did wrong to him according with with his property he said I just let it go I won't Soo him he had a lawsuit against the city but he said I'll let that go because I'm still bothered by something I did on the Public Service Company and it's bothering me so the dream happens again he still happening this dream and then he remembers while he was at the Public Service Company the company would give him 50 cents worth of a breakfast to eat it was part of all of the employees would get 50 cents to eat brother random says I didn't eat that much I'd only eat 10 cents of it and that's the ticket he would turn in 10 cents and then he said at the great meeting with his company the supervisor said who's the knead turning in only 10 cents everybody else is turning in 50 cents and he says well I don't eat that much he says well turn it in anyways he says but I don't eat that much he says turn it in everybody else is doing it you do it too so with that peer pressure it was a supervis ER he goes ahead and he turns in 50 cents worth of a breakfast that he didn't eat so he'd eat the 10 cents and the rest of it he said he'll give it to other children around and so um and he was thinking that God was holding that against him and that was like 40 cents 40 cents difference that was causing him distress and this you know and so he he kept on and the Lord was sending him this dream about the uh uh and he said well maybe that's what the Lord has against me because I keep getting this dream about me mixing up my money on my job and so the Lord's trying to speak to him so finally he keeps dreaming this dream and then the message of Shame he says that he finally goes to the Lord in prayer and one day the the Holy Spirit leads him to pick up his Bible First he cries out Lord what have I done what have I done wrong why am I still having this dream that I've misused the money at the Public Service Company and the Lord is putting his pressure on him and showing him and he says he went and got his Bible and he takes his Bible he closed his eyes and he just let it fall open and he put his finger it was Genesis chapter 24 and verse 7 now revealing to him that he didn't rat on the job but the stress and the pressure that comes with the ministry that you have it requires that that elaser had this stress and this pressure to go find a bride for his maker find a bride for his master and he was the model servant you know a model servant a real servant and we're all called to that if we are real servants they really care they really don't take things for granted that it means something to them the words that are spoken the tally that must be accounted for the the weights and the balances the quotes and am I getting it right I mean if you are really a true gospel parent or preacher or parishioner whatever you are you really want to get it right and people that are made up of this caliber they they they pay attention to the details and they hold it very dear to them when they make a wrong when there's an error they want to make that right how many you know what I'm talking about sure they want to make sure these things have been have been have been dealt with that I'm handling the word right that I'm not taking it for granted what would you think if if there's a vision and there's many what what would you think if there's a vision that God gave and you don't give it the proper attention that he wanted you to give it would wouldn't you say wouldn't you say there's some accountability to that I gave you that Vision but you you put it to the side and said it didn't mean anything or does it mean as much to you and this is what ministers do this is what people do they'll take portions of the word of God and they'll use it for their own Advantage but when you got to take all of the word of God then you're going to C it's going to cost you some friends it's going to cost you you some you know some relationships it might cost you some membership but you got to stay true to the word and this man eleazer I believe we'll see him again I don't know if he was circumcised I believe he was circumcised he would have been part of the group that went to deliver lot he was part of the group that was there with Abraham's growth from just uh uh no a Barren man to a man having children he was there he was a very important man I believe we'll see him again huh yeah I think so we'll see this elzer again here he is placed with this responsibility and I and this is what I want to place on you uh this morning the question is in the message is your life worthy of the Gospel is your life worthy of the visions is your life worthy of over 1,200 recorded sermons is your life worthy of the Gospel the Bible now the Bible was written with all of the energy and instructions of a well detailed author someone who cared pinned it the way he pinned it put it together the way he put it together and it's not to be handled Loosely or lightly but many people do but we want to live a life that's worthy of the gospel and then we want to be able to stand before him and say Lord I'm at your service amen now the prophet of God takes in the message the evening messenger and he says this paragraph 244 evening messenger elaser sweated it out until he found character that's right who would he get and he trusted God character for what character for Isaac the bride which the church is a type of you know that that was the natural Seed of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of Abraham well if eler the messenger hunting the bride and trying to find character if that man is come a messenger of the last day trying to find a bride for Christ he will not look for denominational membership he will look for character that's willing huh thank you sister Norma she's getting it through the interpreter but she can still say Amen she watch good character her first then to get her ready to meet Isaac some of y'all ain't going to help me preach but I'm going to try and do it anyways God bless you after he found the character I'll keep my glasses on so I can't see your face after he found the character then he got her to stand still get her to stand still long enough to listen to his message of Isaac that's the messenger of the last day the evening light is first find that that church where will they believe the message how many can say you can I believe it here Lord find the church find the Home find the young man find the pastor find the young sister that will believe this is what eler was looking for hunt it can you read what I'm talking about hunt where that church is that'll even let you come in that won't close a door in your face then when you do there then you found character now she will stand long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed she's got to be clothed stand still look at the little Rebecca listening to every word look at your neighbor and say every word if you got a second neighbor look at your other neighbor and tell them every word oh yeah I see y'all y'all ain't going to help me but it's okay every word Rebecca is listening for every word not just this word or that word you know you know what's so nice we have some visions that the prophet pre I'm so glad about him now I thank God for him more and more brother Joe I think you know why couldn't he clean that up a little bit why can he why did he leave us hanging like that why did God had to set us up to look for another great vision to happen and then God take the prophet off the seat oh it's beautiful it's wonderful when the word is written like that because what does it do it reveals who Rebecca is because Rebecca will stay with the word all of the word not just part here and part there uhhuh Lord why don't you make the circles more round why don't you make the squares more even why don't you make the triangles and the quotes fit directly why don't you have brother random explain everything for us it's written that way on purpose the Bible's written that way the message come that way and it reveals the character that's in people you know Rebecca didn't know who she who this man was she had no clue who this man was he shows up out of wherever he come from talking about you know uh he's looking for a bride for his his master son first he has these camels laid out 10 camels around the well and he prays this prayer for the Lord to reveal who the bride would be for us where are the Miracles then he throws out a flea and then he throws out another fleece he's asking for an assurance that what I'm doing is right and the god that you and I serve is a God that will vindicate his word in your life very simple prayer Lord is this the way I should be handling the message is this the way I should be in handling the Bible Lord reveal it to me and when he gives you that confirmation and that Revelation you ought to be the most happiest person that can be because he will do that he'll reveal to you little Rebecca's listening to every word her little heart is beating she now he you sweated it out wh will you go until I find the character when I find the character then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go meet him oh my what a striking thing wish we had a little more time on that clock get her ready stand still to listen to his message of him elzer wasn't speaking of himself but he was speaking of the one who s he was sent from and he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him amen he wanted to cloth clothe her with these things paragraph 248 if you can just get her to wash her face see you know I just felt checked on that so I better keep still notice the end time messenger his job will be to get the Saints ready the bride ready for the bridegroom that will be his message now you want to learn ABC so you can study algebra later when these other seals on the back is open they'll only be revealed to them that's right learn ABC first what does ABC always believe Christ Mount Your Creed Christ see believe what he says not what somebody else is saying all right now what does this elaser do he kind of puts pressure on Rebecca and her people remember they wanted her to take 10 days to make a decision but elzer put pressure on Rebecca and her family says no you need to make a decision now you need to make this decision and this is what a model servant will do he'll be steadfast for a decision he needs to find that decision that has been made he needs to have a Cornerstone something to found upon well maybe I kind of maybe somewhat I'm kind of thinking about it well no the messenger and the word of God puts the pressure on you on where do you stand in the word where do you stand in these things that God is trying to reveal to his church where do you stand in all of the word of God or all of the quotations I'll drop back here just for a minute I was reading a quotation about that brother brandham talks about those servants the Ravens that they kept the voice of Elijah alive during the famine and that's a quotation that brother bam makes and so in that quotation we're ref we're being referenced as Ravens doesn't mean we're all Ravens in all types and shadows but in that particular uh reference there he's showing that they were the servants that kept Elijah's voice alive during the time of the famine so a Believer doesn't have a problem with that why because that's what he said that's the reference point it is I don't have my own quotations to bring we're preaching something that has already been brought to us and it's our job to stay with that word man that's what a true servant will do he'll keep you steadfast for a decision to stay with the word what word this word you know I was I mentioned this in the church in Phoenix about reading in between the lines and I went back again to read some more quotations on it because I did a study on it some some years ago and then I went back to read it again and brother bam was talking about how your Bible is a love letter and that when you fall in love with the author then you can read between the lines it's a love letter and then he gives an example he said that job specified his burying place because you got to read between the Lin to find out why Jacob wanted to be buried there and all the prophets wanted to be buried and Abraham buried his dead there read between the lines you'll see that the resurrection happens there so but a prophet had to show us that didn't he and then he also brings out the example of Abraham and Sarah being turned young again so you got to read in between the lines how did she make this journey after 80 years old how did a young man looking for a new bride pick Grandma to be his wife you got to read in between the lines we saw those scriptures our whole life in the denomination we never read that between the line but when the prophet reads between the line then we can read between a line and them is the only lines we can read in between just keep it real see because now brother bam said read in between the lines so let me take what he preached on the seven seal let me read in between the lines stop that's not how you read in between the line you read in between the lines as he read in between the lines this is where the other doctrines come from because brother so and so is Reading in between the lines and you ain't getting it and brother so so over here is Reading in between the lines and then they ain't getting it and everybody's reading in between the line to where they not even saying what a it's not even a quote anymore so that's a little study for you to do you can do it yourself reading in between the lines and then you go tell me how you going to go read in between the lines yourself and come up with something that the prophet didn't bring stop so we read in between the lines as and there's a quote where he says the prophets were able to read in between the lines that's what he says so we see this the model servant is interested in every word and those that follow this model servant Rebecca will be interested in every word all right let's go a little bit further it's 11:40 okay lean her brother said just give her 10 days to make up her mind she's the one that's going to have to make up her mind give her 10 days so the true servant the model servant said no let her go now so they decided for Rebecca to make up her own mind and that's what you've got to do tonight you've got to make up your own mind you can't take the mind or what somebody else has said it's got to be your attitude towards the message that you hear you can't take if the doctor turns you down he said you're going to die now you either you got to believe what he said said your mother says if you go down to the angelist temple brother bam continues on so I just to save a little time that was in the message time of decision so you have to make up your mind and so I'm bringing this how am I bringing this I'm bringing this at brother brandham elzer was a model servant obviously brother brandham was a model servant preachers pastors and teachers have to be model servants then the believer too has to be a model servant and a faithful servant that can say Lord I'm at your service these principles they transferred to the believer the qualities in elaser transferred to the qualities that was in Rebecca they're related they're connected and those qualities have to translate to the gospel preacher of today and the believer of today they have those same qualities you see the way brother brandham handled the word word he had to be every word if it's not in the word he wouldn't accept it that has to come over into the believer's life today can you all see that so we we all should be model servants men and women young and old preachers non preachers amen amen I get one or two amens it's okay what what is it June or July where we at oh my yes sir the time of decision brother bam continues on and he says this here paragraph number 16 all right I'm just going to close just now okay who said no don't close thank you one two two I got two or three in the witness of two or three everything else be EST staish so let me let me get this out all right but I'm going to close here in just a moment I'm not going to hold you long Lord would help me but I want to lay this out here this this is in the message the time of decision paragraph number 16 brother man says this here God's looking for men today that will move when the spirit moves and anywhere that he may sin that's a model servant did we get that so what is a model servant it's Romans 8 Sons and Daughters of God are led by what by the spirit of God a Son of God is Not led by other groups of people you see these massive groups leaving from one Church going to another I'm not criticizing those who do it but it's just curious to me how did everybody make the same decision to leave at the same time as a big group like that and we supposed to be serving the lord individually ask yourself that question if the Lord leads you to go from point A to point B let him lead you but don't follow a group of people yes sir I know I'm at home now God's looking for men today that will move in the spirit move this is a challenge this is a challenge let's be honest if everybody else is doing it this way all the other preachers all other groups everybody else is doing it this this way isn't it easier to do it that way just to follow that way sure sure do I get that pressure sure do you get that pre peer pressure is what it's caused not just in school it's in every Walk of Life if you're a human being you there's a pressure to be like and accepted by your peers but thank God for the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost comes a man is led by the spirit of God and when God moves that man it don't matter who leaves or who likes he stays with the moving of the Holy Ghost because God reveals it to him it's a revelation I love this about eler he prayed his prayer it seems like internally he prayed his prayer and he's he's he's depending on God to lead him in this decision to find this bride not even for himself it was for his master he's depending on it and God vindicates it doesn't he what happens this little girl comes out sees El eer out there with those 10 camels many of us would have missed it right there 10 camels I mean some of us can't even offer a brother a drink let alone 10 of his dogs or his camels or or 10 of his kids or his boys I mean but the character I've noticed this can I drop this in real quick I noticed this just as a contractor going into homes most of the S most of the women that will offer us something to eat or to drink over the years are typically women no I've been not say it I'll just leave it alone I always take little notes like that but there they seem to be like like I gotta say it now sis they seem to be like um like stay-at-home type moms and I've noticed that they have a care or concern of course we got a contract of course we getting paid of course the deal has been made but they look out the window to see who's thirsty and then they offer something without somebody asking them to do it it's character character sees a need and it goes do what needs to get done before anybody asks him what can you help me with this can you open the door can you do this over here that's what character is that's where Rebecca was Eliezer posted that sign out look whoever Waters my camel whoever gives me water and all the little Honeys and little bunnies and little sweeties probably would have lined up where we going where how much money you got what that much are you kidding me sure I water a camel get my nails done afterwards they ain't the deal the deal is here's the opportunity you're going to go offer this man a drink of water and then I want to give you your camel some water all of them Ellers just set back watch her do it 1 2 3 4 8 n 10 camels she watered them thank you C and I do too think about yourself think about watering 10 men 10 cups of coffee I'm just looking for one but look at 10 cups of water for me but this is 10 camels and this little girl comes out she had to be of the same cloth as Isaac she had to be the same cloth as the god of the Bible she had to be in the same cloth as the Eternal one who knew her name she come skipping out there doing her thing her daily task her daily chore and then she sees an opportunity there's a stranger offer him some water going Hey sir would you like some water huh sure I'm quite thirsty can I get some water for for your camels too all of them yes and he in his heart's like yep that's her I don't even know I don't need to ask any more question that's her that's character that's got to be the one and this is what character does it is led by the spirit you're led to do things not for the money you're led to do it because you're a son or daughter to of God and and and all of this as I said on Wednesday a couple Services ago that all of this has to be motivated by Divine love you know when you really love the sinner I don't have the quotes with me when you really love the sinner brother mam says don't just pray for him he said go talk to them when you really get a l for The Sinner then that'll motivate you to go and contact him create a way a space to go see him not even just Sinners out there what about visitors that come into our mid people visitors come off the streets people come through here two three four times and we don't know their names we don't even think to even ask because we got to go get lunch with brother so and so or we got to go get but look around look around don't know what that person is going through they need that connection you're the one that needs to connect with them amen amen Saints and so this servant is led by the spirit and they're steadfast for a decision and they're led by the spirit and now this true servant this is what he has to contend with this my last quote here it's in the message super sign let let let let's take time of decision one more time paragraph 25 and he says this here every true and every true servant of God that sent out has got a whole book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride I'm so glad of that he's got gifts in there for her he will not he will not hold any of them back he will give every one of them freely a true servant a model servant a servant that God can can put trust in he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows that she is the oncoming Queen there's no good thing withheld from them that'll walk upright before him so a real servant doesn't hide any of the scriptures or the quotes we don't hide any of them they're all valid amen amen somebody look at these two things that brother bam said that this servant has to contend for and the super sign paragraph 134 notice elaser found the woman he know that was her and notice he had to deal with two people her mother and the brother the Father the rest of them had nothing to say mother and brother so has the messenger the Holy Ghost of God in this last day picking out the bride he's had to deal with the church that calls itself the mother Catholic and the brother the preacher that's exactly had to deal with those two they was the one that kicked up a fuss about it now preachers are good people a lot of them are but preachers can be problems too don't say Amen so loud cuz you know I'm setting you up right preacher the preacher is the problem he's the problem the preacher but but all of us got some little preacher in us we preaching right out there in the parking lot we call them parking lot prophets parking lot preachers sisters who preach brothers who preach preachers who preach and everybody's preaching and you got to deal with this Catholic this mother he calls it the Catholic we call it the system we call it that denominational system and then the preacher you got to deal with these interpretations that are out there but a real servant is led by the spirit of God and we thank God for it and we appreciate it because we want to fall in line to be a model servant someone that's not speaking of himself so a model servant maybe looks like this in this congregation here today there's an area in Tucson that needs to hear the word for the first time who who is available from this group here I know we know how to point out who's supposed to be doing what we're famous for that well brother s he's the one that goes to those people or this they can go over there but out of this group here who could God call like just tap them on the shoulder and say you know I need you to go get a bride for me as Abraham did to elaser over into a country I need to swear to me you won't speak of yourself you depend on you and you go get a bride for me how many of us here are willing to do that or are we are we disengaged in that part of the ministry is it just the Sunday morning where we're in the message where we receive receive receive and then one day we get to go into the Rapture or is there still work to be done and if there is work to be done who's supposed to be doing that work is it is it only the brothers is it only the sisters is it only the preachers or pastors is it the brothers in for five years or 10 years who's supposed to be doing that work a model servant will be sent and he'll lay aside his own agendas that's what I'm trying to do in my life today lay aside my own agendas my own you know hopes and dreams and what I want and try to find the mind of the Lord for my service Lord I'm at your service can can you say that today can you come to his Altar and say Lord I'm at your service maybe you want to use me in a way you've never used me or anybody else before maybe but are you willing to do that you know this elaser seemed like a very very good man to have in your house seemed like a faithful man the Bible calls him the faithful servant in all of Abraham's house you know what does that word faithful mean faithful means remaining loyal and steadfast true to the facts or the original that's what that word faithful mean one of the meanings true to the facts or the original remaining loyal and steadfast you know some people they're very intense but they don't have any consistency with that intensity so when you see their intensity they look strong they look like a leader they look like but they don't they don't hold out it's not faithful it's not steadfast but a a faithful servant is steadfast not just the intensity of getting things started or being the loudest Voice or even appearing like a leader uh that's what what what about what about being consistent when the crowd isn't saying Amen on the Sunday morning for you does that happen sometimes I got to get out of here real quick what happens when what happens when it's not friendly for you to be in charge of whatever you're in charge the Sunday school class is normally 30 to maybe 40 and then you show up there's only five I guess we should cancel not not a model servant what's a model servant a model servant shows up and is ready to be called upon even without prior notice what's the Bible say about that that a Workman should be instant win in season when and when else and out of season you're supposed to live ready live ready live ready to serve it might be your Rebecca moment it might be your camel watering moment this little girl watering these 10 camels giving her time to this man she don't even know probably never see him again but she's watering those camels but in the divine revelation she's actually watering her own camels those camels are hers and she's watering this one camel number one camel maybe a little pat on the camel this one paddle on the shoulder little camel what you going to get paid Rebecca we don't know you see this man again probably not what you doing it for because it needs to be get done you must have been raised in the right house yeah my dad and mom are good people watering this man's camel watering this man's camel and come to find out these camels are yours plus and where you going you won't have to water no more camels that's how it turns like that you show the character first and then the blessing comes afterwards and look at elaser a model servant in the Bible how about you and I today are are you willing are you a model servant can you say within your heart Lord I'm at your service you know if I'm invited to preach at a denomination I can go in there with the with the mindset I'm going to go give them the word I'm going go take the message in there if they reject the pillar of fire they're serpent SE I can take that attitude I can say well I got the word I'm in the message they invited me go burn them out of there blast them out give them the word test or or I could take the attitude Lord I'm at your service how do you want to handle me with these people today how do you want to use me in this group today I think that's the right attitude yes yes not your agenda not your gift not your talent but God using your gift your talent for his glory for his honor God bless you so much this morning God bless you another scripture you can take with you in Matthew chapter 24: number 4251 Proverbs 20 and verse 6 says most men will Proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find amen let's pray Lord Jesus thank you for your word this morning we
