[21:03] Oh, in that city where the lamp, there's
[21:07] the light.
[21:09] In that city where there comes no night.
[21:16] I a mansion over there and it's ring.
[21:22] I am going where the lamb is alive.
[21:28] Let sunshine fade. at twilight bring it
[21:32] gloom.

[21:39] pride.
[21:41] For I know that up in heaven there's a
[21:45] roof. Oh, thank you, Lord. In that city
[21:49] where
[21:51] is a light.

[22:58] tonight. Let's sing that song. There is

[23:05] name. I love to hear a name. Love to
[23:08] sing that name. Oh,
[23:11] there is
[23:14] a name
[23:17] I love
[23:20] to hear.

[24:44] me of
[24:47] a savior.

[27:38] it tells
[27:41] of one
[27:43] whose loveing
[27:47] heart
[27:49] can feel
[27:52] my deepest
[27:55] soul.
[28:00] him who in his sorrow
[28:06] wears
[28:08] a part
[28:11] that none
[28:13] can bear
[28:16] below.
[28:20] [Music]
[28:22] Oh,
[28:25] how I love Jesus. Bless you.
[28:32] [Music]
[28:37] How I
[28:39] Jesus?
[28:43] [Music]
[29:03] &gt;&gt; Aren't you so glad that he loved you?
[29:05] Amen. His love is so great.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we come before you
[29:11] tonight, Lord. We approach you, Lord,
[29:14] with all sincerity and our hearts to
[29:16] you, Lord, asking for your leadership,
[29:21] Father,
[29:22] &gt;&gt; for the anointing,
[29:24] &gt;&gt; for for instructions from heaven. that
[29:28] we want to hear from you, Lord. Not to
[29:30] hear from a man or for some carnal
[29:35] avenue, Lord, but to hear from you is
[29:37] our prayer. And Father, just take the
[29:40] few moments that's set aside for that
[29:43] and move right into the word, Lord, and
[29:45] speak to our hearts, we pray. Lord, we
[29:49] have no ability of our own. Without you,
[29:52] we can do nothing. So we trust and
[29:55] depend on you tonight. Asking for your
[29:58] favors.
[29:59] Bless every heart that's gathered, Lord.
[30:02] The youngest ones, the older ones. Each
[30:05] one may receive their portion tonight.
[30:08] In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless
[30:12] you.
[30:14] So good to be in the house of the Lord
[30:15] with you tonight.
[30:17] Amen. So we welcome each of you, our
[30:21] visitors, our friends. Good to see each
[30:24] of you. Welcome. Have brother Jonathan
[30:26] here with us tonight. We look forward to
[30:28] having to see what the Lord has for him
[30:31] to say to the church here on this
[30:33] weekend. So, be in prayer for that
[30:36] service. Amen.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Before we um go into the um
[30:43] prayer meeting, we'd like to take a a
[30:46] few moments to go into the word of the
[30:47] Lord. I have two places in the
[30:49] scripture. Um,
[30:52] brother Joe, those the notes with the
[30:54] prayer requests, I left them on my desk
[30:56] faithfully.
[30:58] Always do that. So, in Acts 1 and8 and
[31:02] also in Luke chapter 22,
[31:19] it's old song. We used to sing, "Can't
[31:21] nobody do me like Jesus.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Can't nobody do me like the Lord.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; He's my friend." Amen.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; What a friend we have in Jesus. Amen.
[31:35] Acts
[31:37] 1
[31:39] verse number 8. But ye shall receive
[31:43] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[31:46] upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto
[31:50] me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea
[31:54] and in Samaria and unto the uttermost
[31:57] parts of the earth. Amen.
[32:00] So we'll take one more scripture in Luke
[32:03] chapter 22.
[32:21] In verse number 15, this is a kind of
[32:25] the a communion. This is our Lord
[32:29] getting ready to give his life at
[32:32] Calvary. And he said unto them, with
[32:35] desire, I have desired to eat this
[32:37] Passover with you before I suffer. For I
[32:42] say unto you, I will not anymore eat
[32:45] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[32:49] kingdom of God. And he took the cup and
[32:52] he gave thanks and said, take this and
[32:55] divide it among yourselves.
[32:59] And let's go down just a little bit in
[33:02] verse number
[33:06] 23.
[33:09] And they began to inquire among
[33:11] themselves which of them it was should
[33:13] do this thing. And there was also strife
[33:16] among them which of them should be
[33:18] accounted the greatest. And he said unto
[33:20] them, the kings of the Gentiles exercise
[33:23] lordship over them, and they that
[33:26] exercise authority upon them are called
[33:29] benefactors.
[33:30] But ye shall not be so. But he that is
[33:33] greatest among you, let him be as the
[33:36] younger, and he that is chief as he that
[33:39] doth serve. For whether is greater, he
[33:42] that sitth that meat, or he that
[33:45] serveth? Is not he that siteth that
[33:48] meat? But I am among you as he that
[33:53] serveth. Ye are they which have
[33:56] continued with me in my temptations.
[34:00] And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my
[34:05] father hath appointed unto me, that ye
[34:07] may eat and drink at my table where
[34:12] &gt;&gt; in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging
[34:16] the 12 tribes of Israel.
[34:19] Now, uh the prophet of God on Sunday, we
[34:23] shared a few places with you on this
[34:26] great thought of the millennium and the
[34:28] millennial reign. How many thank the
[34:30] Lord for that?
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; And that we are headed to that place
[34:35] where we will reign with Christ for a
[34:38] thousand years. Um it's spoken of
[34:41] throughout the scriptures in Isaiah,
[34:44] Ezekiel and many of the scriptures and
[34:47] Jesus refers to it many times in many
[34:51] parables. But this thousand year that
[34:54] millennium millennial is in revelation
[34:57] chapter 20 is where that is uh more
[35:01] spoke of. But tonight um we'll read a
[35:04] few of those notes from Sunday morning
[35:07] Sunday school and u we trust that this
[35:11] word will be a blessing to you. Let us
[35:14] pray. Father bless your word and bless
[35:16] your people. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[35:20] God bless you. You may be seated. Thank
[35:22] you.
[35:24] So,
[35:26] this millennium
[35:29] is a thousand-year reign where the
[35:33] saints of God will reign with Christ for
[35:37] a thousand years. That's here on the
[35:40] earth. That's where we go before we go
[35:44] to heaven. Amen.
[35:46] And in Revelations 20, it tells us in
[35:50] verse 7, "And when the thousand years
[35:52] are expired, Satan shall be loosed out
[35:56] of his prison, and shall go out to
[35:59] deceive the nations which are in the
[36:02] four quarters of the earth. Gog and
[36:05] Magog to gather them together to battle,
[36:08] the number of whom is as the sand of the
[36:11] sea." So, you know, as we uh go forward
[36:15] in this thought of the millennium, the
[36:18] millennial reign and uh the
[36:20] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[36:22] of God, what this subject does, brother
[36:25] Kurt, it it encourages more questions
[36:29] than answers.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And so, it's beautiful, but they're good
[36:33] questions. They're questions of the
[36:35] future. And they asked brother Brandon
[36:38] of the question, will there be children
[36:40] born in the millennium?
[36:44] And he said he wondered about that
[36:45] himself. It kind of looks like it is
[36:47] kind of like like looks like it isn't.
[36:50] And in this reign and in this um
[36:55] governing of cities and towns and
[36:57] building and planting where Satan is
[37:02] bound not with the log chain but with
[37:05] the chain of circumstance, there will be
[37:08] no sin ruling and reigning.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; But the sons and daughters of God will
[37:13] have something to reign over and people
[37:16] to reign over. One of the some of the
[37:20] great theologians
[37:22] believe that these people that Satan
[37:24] finally gathers from the four corners of
[37:26] the earth are the redeemed
[37:31] children, the saints who had children
[37:34] during this thousand years will have
[37:37] children and not all of them will be
[37:39] saved. And so these are the subjects
[37:42] that we reign over and these are the
[37:44] ones that will rebel in the final end.
[37:46] We know at the end of the millennium
[37:48] there'll be another. Of course, there's
[37:50] no sin during the millennium, but um
[37:54] it's still not heaven. And we're still
[37:57] um working, eating, planting, building,
[38:01] and so forth. And brother Brown makes
[38:04] this statement on the millennium
[38:07] about some of the people that
[38:12] we'll be ruling and reigning over. And
[38:15] it's just one little place. I haven't
[38:17] seen any other place where he talked
[38:19] about it in depth, but he says it here
[38:25] in the message Questions and Answers
[38:27] 1962,
[38:29] paragraph 178. And then at the return of
[38:32] the church and the bride, the bride in
[38:35] Christ shall walk out upon the ashes in
[38:37] the millennium when the earth is
[38:39] purified by fire. And there they shall
[38:43] reign, and the heathens that's never
[38:47] heard the gospel shall be raised in that
[38:50] time. And the sons of God will be
[38:54] manifested.
[38:55] If he's to reign, he's got to have
[38:58] something to reign over.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; He's got a domain. And they ruled and
[39:04] reigned with Christ. Christ ruled with
[39:08] the rod of iron, the nations. Then the
[39:11] manifested sons of God with authority
[39:13] just like he had when he was here. See,
[39:15] there will come the millennium in that
[39:17] reign. See, upon the ash ashes. So I
[39:21] have watched for something. Has it
[39:24] slipped by us in humility and we've
[39:27] missed it? Is it gone and the church is
[39:30] left in our sins? If that be so, then
[39:34] it's later than you think. If not, then
[39:38] there's coming one with a message that's
[39:40] straight on the Bible. A quick work will
[39:44] circle the earth. You know what I love
[39:47] about brother Brandham with all of the
[39:50] experiences he's had with the Lord,
[39:52] personal experiences and him knowing who
[39:55] he was and the great signs, wonders, and
[39:57] miracles
[39:59] in his life, even going beyond the
[40:01] curtain of time, he still always
[40:03] possessed this attitude. Could it be
[40:06] that we miss something?
[40:08] &gt;&gt; And he's always, Lord, please help us to
[40:13] go closer to you. It's never this
[40:16] setback. I've already made it.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; It's never he he doesn't possess that
[40:21] attitude. And if anyone could, you would
[40:24] maybe say he could. But this this
[40:27] heathen being raised, it it it just
[40:30] makes it brings more questions
[40:33] &gt;&gt; because there is no sin, but the saints
[40:36] are ruling and reigning for a thousand
[40:38] years. And I just want you to put that
[40:40] in your mind. You know, before the
[40:42] flood, men would live 900 years, 700
[40:46] years, 800 years. After the flood, the
[40:50] lifespan of a man dropped down.
[40:53] 120 years is old man.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; And today, I don't know what the average
[40:57] age is, 80, 90, whatever. If you make a
[41:01] 100, that's pretty good. And so before
[41:06] the flood, the men had this long life
[41:09] and they were able to live almost one
[41:14] day.
[41:16] Not quite a day. And the millennium will
[41:18] be that one day that men will live on
[41:21] the earth for a thousand years. The
[41:24] earth will be fertile.
[41:27] It will produce. Brother Chuck, if you
[41:30] plant it, it will grow.
[41:33] and it will it will grow very well. In
[41:36] one scripture in Ezekiel, it talks about
[41:38] how the planting time and the harvest
[41:41] time will overlap. So while you're
[41:44] planting in one season, the or gathering
[41:47] in one season, the food from last year's
[41:51] crop is still remaining while you're
[41:54] still trying to plant for this year. It
[41:55] over it overtakes it in this fertility.
[41:59] It's beautiful, beautiful thought to
[42:01] think of that. building a house,
[42:03] planting a garden, inhabiting, and
[42:07] enjoying all the things that we enjoy.
[42:09] We read many of those quotes for you on
[42:12] Sunday. Now, the prophet of God makes
[42:15] this statement here in the resurrection
[42:17] of Lazarus, 1953, and he says,
[42:22] "He can't do nothing more for us than
[42:25] what he's already done." He makes this
[42:27] statement. He says, "I wish you'd do
[42:29] something for me." This is the attitude
[42:31] of people many times. Lord, I wish you
[42:34] do. God bless you, Kayen. See you. Lord,
[42:36] I wish you do something for me. But
[42:40] brother Bandom says, he can't do nothing
[42:42] no more for us than what he's already
[42:45] done.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And I want you to let that lay in your
[42:49] mind for a moment. That everything that
[42:51] he's going to do or can do for you, he's
[42:54] already done.
[42:56] healing, power, blessings, whatever it
[42:59] is, is already been purchased.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Now, the sons and daughters of God have
[43:06] to take that and move forward with
[43:10] &gt;&gt; what this was all about.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody died so that you can be free.
[43:16] Not halfway free, not part-time free.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about free all the time with
[43:22] all of the benefits.
[43:25] Amen. And all of the blessings that he
[43:28] has to offer. And brother Brandham has
[43:30] taken his time to show the church that
[43:34] we are living below our privileges.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; And he's the one who separated the
[43:39] Gentiles from the Jew as it pertains to
[43:43] laying on of hands and then receiving it
[43:46] by the spoken word.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; And he said the Gentiles faith should be
[43:49] a higher faith. we should receive it
[43:52] because the word says so. Amen.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; And um it's clear in these parables
[44:01] also that when Jesus is talking about
[44:05] faithfulness
[44:07] and he is given this parable in Luke 22
[44:13] and in Luke chapter 11 and it's talking
[44:16] about being faithful over a little
[44:18] things and in Matthew he talks about
[44:20] being faithful over a few things. I'll
[44:23] make you a ruler over many. I want to
[44:25] take this one in Luke just for a moment.
[44:27] We did it before. I'll take it one more
[44:29] time. Luke 11 and verse number 15. And
[44:34] it came to pass that when he returned,
[44:38] having received the kingdom, then he
[44:40] commanded these servants to be called
[44:42] unto him to whom he had given the money,
[44:46] that he might know how much every man
[44:49] had gained by trading. Then came the
[44:51] first saying,"Lord, the pound, thy pound
[44:54] hath gained 10 pounds." And he said unto
[44:57] him, "Well, uh, well, thou good servant,
[45:01] because thou hast been faithful and a
[45:04] very little, have thou authority over 10
[45:08] cities." And the second came saying,
[45:11] Lord, thy pound gained five pounds. And
[45:13] he said, likewise to him be thou also
[45:17] over five cities.
[45:20] And so, you know, this is
[45:23] a a parable of being faithful over
[45:28] something very small,
[45:29] &gt;&gt; the the the the little details. You
[45:32] know, it's um you know, sometimes we we
[45:35] miss God because of the very fine little
[45:38] points.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; It's not the great big things. And what
[45:42] what this parable is showing that you
[45:45] know the little things actually are big
[45:49] things
[45:51] when it all runs its course.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; See when it when it comes to you it
[45:56] seems like a little thing. Well that's
[45:59] all you want me to do? Is that all you
[46:00] ask me to do? Is that all I can do? It's
[46:02] a little thing but he's watching your
[46:04] attitude over the little things. And
[46:08] here these men had one pound or five
[46:11] pounds, just a few dollars. And they
[46:14] doubled those few dollars. And then
[46:16] those few dollars turned into
[46:19] five cities.
[46:22] 10 cities.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "You've been faithful
[46:26] over this little thing, this little
[46:28] task, this little little monetary thing.
[46:31] You did what it took. I didn't hold your
[46:34] hand. You went out and you traded over
[46:36] here. and you traded over here and you
[46:39] ran through the investments and you
[46:42] counted the cost and you took the risk.
[46:45] You could have lost, but you took the
[46:46] risk and you sweated it out and you
[46:49] thought it through and maybe you prayed
[46:50] and you worked through all these little
[46:52] and it's just a few dollars. It's just a
[46:54] few dollars. And in somebody's eyes,
[46:57] it's just a few dollars. But wait, it's
[46:59] the Lord's few dollars.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; He's the one who placed that in your
[47:04] hands. And any shepherd could just any
[47:07] kind of sheep. Any kind of sheep. But
[47:08] David had his father's sheep. And it
[47:12] looks like just a few little stinking
[47:14] sheep. You You're not going to get your
[47:17] name in the paper over these sheep.
[47:19] You're not We're not You don't We don't
[47:20] give out awards for faithful shepherds.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; There is no faithful shepherd's award
[47:27] ceremony.
[47:29] You know, if you hear about a shepherd
[47:31] in the newspaper, you probably did
[47:33] something bad.
[47:35] something bad happens because
[47:37] faithfulness you we don't we don't
[47:40] broadcast that all the time.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Faithfulness is quiet.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; It's like you don't you don't know you
[47:47] don't know a problem. I if if we do
[47:51] highlight you, it's because there
[47:53] probably was a problem. And here's
[47:55] David's attitude over It's Wednesday
[47:57] night. I'm supposed to be up here.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Here's David's attitude over his
[48:02] father's sheep.
[48:04] He's just a shepherd. He's got his
[48:07] father's sheep. He's all by himself.
[48:10] There's no lights. There is no, you
[48:13] know, crowns.
[48:15] You're not going to get a trophy. You're
[48:17] not going to win at the end of the
[48:19] month. We're not going to put you in
[48:21] front of the crowd and appreciate how
[48:24] great of a shepherd you were. But the
[48:27] Lord put David over those few sheep. And
[48:29] his attitude over those sheep was so
[48:34] much deeper.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Now, if I drove by, you drove by, you
[48:37] just say, "Oh, a little shepherd out
[48:39] there." But no, in the kingdom of God,
[48:40] he's watching David. And when the lion
[48:43] came to take those sheep, he put his
[48:46] life on the line
[48:49] &gt;&gt; to save a stinking,
[48:52] dirty,
[48:54] noame sheep. A sheep don't have a name
[48:57] probably.
[49:00] If I was David's daddy, I say, "David,
[49:03] man, don't you put your life on the line
[49:05] for one of them sheep. I can lose one of
[49:08] them, but I can't lose you."
[49:11] &gt;&gt; You see, but faithfulness,
[49:13] it looks at the task. It looks at the
[49:16] responsibility
[49:17] and it takes it serious. Even though the
[49:19] sheep have no value, even though maybe
[49:22] this position has no value, but the
[49:24] responsibility
[49:27] &gt;&gt; is of great value
[49:30] &gt;&gt; because your father put you in charge
[49:32] over it and your attitude towards it
[49:35] means something great. And we see that
[49:39] with many characters in the Bible, don't
[49:42] we?
[49:44] &gt;&gt; We see that with Abraham. how Abraham
[49:47] treated Lot, an undeserving
[49:50] nephew.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Look at Joseph the way he handled his
[49:55] father's business by giving him report
[49:57] of his brothers even though that causes
[50:00] friction and with the siblings but the
[50:02] father told him give me a report and
[50:04] that's what he did and he was loved and
[50:06] he he gave his father report and it cost
[50:08] him almost cost him his life. What about
[50:11] Job? What about Job being faithful over
[50:16] sacrificing for his children?
[50:19] &gt;&gt; It looks like a nothing, but it's a
[50:21] something.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; What about What about a prayer? What
[50:25] about your little faithfulness to the no
[50:29] name position?
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Huh? Now, this faithfulness
[50:35] be put to the test. And Jesus is given
[50:38] this parable and he's showing us this
[50:43] that faithfulness
[50:45] over a few things
[50:48] equals rulership
[50:51] over many things.
[50:53] So you're faithful over a few things.
[50:55] I'll make you ruler over many things.
[51:00] And
[51:02] that's a nice one.
[51:04] you're faithful over a few things. I'm
[51:07] going to make you ruler. So, so, so they
[51:10] handled the money. They they they they
[51:13] multiplied it. And so, what did the Lord
[51:16] reward them with? Uh a a payment where
[51:19] they didn't have to work again? No. He
[51:20] rewards them with more responsibility.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. But with more
[51:27] responsibility, there's more victories.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; If you can do it here, you can do it
[51:32] over here. If you can't do it over here,
[51:35] promise. I promise you, you can't do it
[51:38] if I give you more.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; I promise I'll be more faithful if you
[51:42] pay me more.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; How many knows that employee?
[51:46] &gt;&gt; How many was that employee? You show up,
[51:49] I want to get paid more. Well, work here
[51:52] for a month, work here for two months,
[51:54] for three months, and then maybe we'll
[51:56] think about, no, no, no. I want I value
[52:00] myself greater than that. Well, that's
[52:01] great. You value yourself greater than
[52:03] that. But I don't know. You uh show
[52:05] yourself
[52:07] &gt;&gt; like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[52:08] Thursday, Friday. Repeat. Monday,
[52:10] Tuesday, Wednesday, th repeat. Are you
[52:13] going to appreciate me today? No
[52:14] appreciations today. Monday, Tuesday,
[52:17] Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be here. That's the
[52:21] contract. That's
[52:23] faithfulness. That's what it is.
[52:27] And many of us want the promise of
[52:30] greater things and more things. We're
[52:32] not even faithful in the few things.
[52:33] What are the few things that God has
[52:35] placed us in charge? Great. They're
[52:39] really great things. this
[52:43] um ruling and reigning in the in the
[52:47] millennium where the Jews will judge
[52:51] over the 12 their the 12 tribes and
[52:54] where the manifestation of the sons of
[52:57] God will come into a great uh
[53:01] fulfillment. Now, this manifestation of
[53:04] the sons of God, as I read that for you,
[53:09] he says it here again.
[53:13] Excuse me
[53:16] as a prophet deals with it here.
[53:21] So, in Jehovah Gyra 1961,
[53:25] he makes this statement here. And all
[53:28] the world is groaning, waiting for the
[53:30] manifestation of the sons of God.
[53:33] Waiting for the church to get back in
[53:35] its place again.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Sons of God to be made manifest. Waiting
[53:41] for that hour. Hope that don't hurt, but
[53:44] I just had to say it. The church is so
[53:47] far away from its place. It needs to be
[53:50] back to be sons of God again. rulers,
[53:55] governors of the earth under the
[53:57] spiritual reign. It will be someday when
[54:01] the chief one comes, Jesus Christ, the
[54:04] great millennium. Nature is groaning for
[54:08] that day.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; So, he's showing this manifestation of
[54:12] the sons of God as a future event in the
[54:16] millennium.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; I read the first one here about in
[54:19] questions and answer when he'll raise up
[54:21] the heathens. He says that again, the
[54:22] manifestation of the sons of God as a
[54:25] future event,
[54:26] &gt;&gt; but it's not only a future event.
[54:29] There's a man manifestation of the sons
[54:31] of God before the rapture.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And brother Random taught that to us.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's what the book, the adoption
[54:40] series was all about, the manifestation
[54:43] of the sons of God. Now, it's a lot of
[54:46] people know how to say amen to the
[54:48] future because it doesn't hold them
[54:50] responsible for right now.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; The future is not your future. If right
[54:56] now isn't right,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; you won't be in the future promise if
[55:01] you're not in the promise right now.
[55:04] What is the word of God to you right
[55:05] now? And I can tell you what it will be
[55:07] in your future. If you don't care now,
[55:10] you won't care then. If it's not
[55:12] important now, it won't be important
[55:14] then. If it's too little now, it won't
[55:17] be enough then
[55:20] &gt;&gt; because now is the time
[55:23] &gt;&gt; for you to take up this word
[55:26] &gt;&gt; and take it seriously.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; You know what? If science, what if this
[55:31] gentleman Eli Musk just simply lived off
[55:35] of what science had already done?
[55:38] What if his mind couldn't imagine
[55:41] greater and deeper depths in scientific
[55:44] achievement? What if that existed? What
[55:47] if what if what if the doctor the
[55:50] medical community stopped research? What
[55:54] if there was no no channel for research?
[55:58] I mean, they spend thousands, millions,
[56:01] millions of dollars just in research in
[56:05] some little office, some closed door.
[56:08] Some people you don't know about. You
[56:09] don't even know what they're
[56:10] researching. But they're constantly
[56:11] researching. Why? Because the medical
[56:14] advancements and they're learning. And
[56:17] they're finding out how atoms work and
[56:19] they're finding out how diseases and
[56:21] germs work. And I really am not
[56:24] interested in in learning how to
[56:27] remember anything of that. But I am
[56:28] dependent on the doctors to continue to
[56:31] do the research
[56:32] &gt;&gt; because when I show up and I get sick, I
[56:34] want the best that the medical community
[56:36] has to offer me. Can I get a witness?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; I'm dependent on that, right? I expect I
[56:44] mean God have mercy on the civilization
[56:46] that their doctors aren't doing research
[56:49] that they aren't learning and continuing
[56:52] to learn. And we we're dependent on
[56:55] that, aren't we?
[56:56] &gt;&gt; That's not my responsibility to learn
[56:58] what the cutting edge on how to do
[57:01] surgery. That's not my responsibility.
[57:03] That's not who I am. But that is
[57:05] somebody's responsibility.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for the ones that are
[57:10] taking it serious.
[57:12] another medical breakthrough. We have a
[57:14] way that we can do this surgery and get
[57:18] it done precisely. Oh my,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in that, aren't you?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; And and and and all these other
[57:26] disciplines are saying, "But what about
[57:28] the church?
[57:29] &gt;&gt; What about the church?
[57:32] Isn't Isn't there a community somewhere
[57:34] that's depending
[57:36] on somebody that believes every word of
[57:41] this
[57:42] &gt;&gt; that is constantly doing research and
[57:46] research and research and going deeper
[57:50] into the power of God into the third
[57:52] pool into whatever God has for us.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; You don't stop your research. Now God
[57:58] have mercy on the soul. that stops
[58:01] researching.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; The doctor's children are depending the
[58:08] doctor's family members that need to be
[58:12] saved. They're depending on the church.
[58:14] That is our responsibility.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; It's not by getting a college degree.
[58:21] It's not by getting some doctorate
[58:22] degree. Nothing against it. Learning
[58:24] Hebrew, Greek, or learning all those
[58:25] things. But it is about getting down on
[58:27] your knees
[58:29] &gt;&gt; and reading the text one more time and
[58:34] reading it with your hands raised and
[58:37] read it on your on your knees. Reading
[58:41] it so God can open up his word to you.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talk that's what I'm
[58:50] interested in.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; It's unlimited.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Is that what he said?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Is that what the prophet said?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; He said it's unlimited. Don't let me or
[59:08] anybody else put a limit on it
[59:12] &gt;&gt; put a limit on how you want to praise,
[59:13] how you want to study, how you want to
[59:15] worship. Don't put that limit on me
[59:19] &gt;&gt; and don't let me put it on you.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; It's unlimited.
[59:25] So that research,
[59:27] that going into it again,
[59:30] that searching and prayer
[59:33] to go into the privileges that the Lord
[59:35] has given us.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; He's trying to show us the authority
[59:40] that was given to the church. So,
[59:44] Brother Random is showing us those
[59:46] future sons. Is that right?
[59:50] Now we know in the millennium there's a
[59:52] quote where brother Random says there
[59:53] will be no scientific achievements over
[59:56] there.
[59:58] We won't need 5G over there or
[1:00:02] electricity. We won't need any
[1:00:03] scientific achievement.
[1:00:06] But um there will be one flag and that
[1:00:10] flag will be the old rugged cross.
[1:00:13] The heathens will be raised to hear the
[1:00:16] gospel. Those that didn't hear it before
[1:00:18] and they'll give be given the
[1:00:20] opportunity. That's what he said. That's
[1:00:21] what he said. I can't connect it. That's
[1:00:23] what he said.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; The he heathen will be raised
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; and given the opportunity
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; and he kind of lays out those order of
[1:00:33] events. And I like reading those out
[1:00:35] loud. And I want to read the order of
[1:00:38] events of what we have to look forward
[1:00:40] to. If I can do that quickly. Is that
[1:00:42] all right?
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers 1964.
[1:00:47] Brother Random says this, paragraph 75.
[1:00:49] Now, no, I wish I could have just have
[1:00:52] more time on that. See, the bride when
[1:00:55] she's taken from the church, then the
[1:00:57] church age will cease. Le Oysia goes
[1:01:01] into chaos. The bride goes to glory. And
[1:01:06] the tribulation period sets in upon the
[1:01:09] sleeping virgin for three and a half
[1:01:11] years while Israel is getting its
[1:01:15] prophecy. Then tribulation sets in upon
[1:01:19] Israel. Then comes the battle of
[1:01:22] Armageddon which destroys all things.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Then the bride returns back with the
[1:01:28] groom for what?
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; I'm interested in going
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; for a thousand years. There's the
[1:01:35] millennial reign. After that comes the
[1:01:38] white throne judgment. After that comes
[1:01:40] the new heavens and the new earth and
[1:01:43] the new city coming down from God out of
[1:01:45] heaven. Eternity and time blends
[1:01:48] together.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; So this is the future. He didn't put it
[1:01:53] in other places. He put it puts in that
[1:01:55] battle of Gog and Magog at the end when
[1:02:00] Satan is loosed to go gather his
[1:02:02] subjects. So what is it that we receive
[1:02:05] as sons and daughters of God? I just
[1:02:07] showed you a couple of quotations
[1:02:09] showing that the manifestation of the
[1:02:11] sons of God is a future event. It's also
[1:02:17] the redemption of our body. This
[1:02:19] adoption and its fullness if you take
[1:02:22] the scriptures on it. But I like how the
[1:02:24] prophet brings this in 19
[1:02:28] 60 and here ye him
[1:02:31] he's talking about this manifestation of
[1:02:33] the sons of God and he really puts it uh
[1:02:37] to us right here very clearly. I love
[1:02:40] this.
[1:02:42] He says paragraph number 87. And now you
[1:02:45] see Jesus had proven to God that he had
[1:02:47] been the right kind of a son. And God
[1:02:49] took him up on top of the mountain,
[1:02:51] brought witnesses out there, heavenly
[1:02:53] witnesses and earthly witnesses. He
[1:02:56] clothed him in immortality. When they
[1:02:59] looked up, they said, "His garments
[1:03:00] shine like the sun. A supernatural
[1:03:03] something taken place. His garments
[1:03:06] garments glisten like the sun in the
[1:03:09] middle of the day, as white as they
[1:03:11] could be. God placed on him that robe of
[1:03:15] immortality,
[1:03:16] showing that he had received him.
[1:03:21] That's the thing that God will do to his
[1:03:24] sons here on earth someday.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; He'll call you aside, church, if you'll
[1:03:32] only obey him and stay on the word and
[1:03:36] believe it. He'll place into the church
[1:03:39] before the coming of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He'll place it into the church. All the
[1:03:46] powers that Christ had in him will be in
[1:03:51] the church.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And all that God was, he poured into
[1:03:55] Jesus. All that Jesus was, he pours into
[1:03:57] the church. God wanting his work done.
[1:04:00] He sent it into his son. The son wanting
[1:04:03] the work done. Sent it into the church.
[1:04:06] All and at that day you'll know that I
[1:04:08] am in the father, the father in me, I in
[1:04:10] you, you in me at that day because the
[1:04:14] same power of God was in Jehovah God
[1:04:18] rested in Jesus Christ. The same power
[1:04:21] that rested in Jesus Christ rests in the
[1:04:25] placed sons in the body of Christ.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Placing of a son, take him out a certain
[1:04:33] place. have a ceremony before the angels
[1:04:36] and place him positionally what he's
[1:04:39] what he is in the body of Christ, then
[1:04:41] that person has the authority.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you count me a
[1:04:49] fanatic from this night on, that very
[1:04:52] same thing that I'm speaking will be
[1:04:55] done.
[1:04:57] There'll be a power put into the church
[1:04:59] and now is coming in that the Holy
[1:05:03] Spirit will so anoint the people till
[1:05:06] they'll speak the word
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; and it'll create itself right there.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; We haven't seen powers like it's coming
[1:05:15] into the church now. I know it for a
[1:05:18] fact.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Say unto this mountain, be moved.
[1:05:23] Don't doubt in your heart, but believe
[1:05:24] that what you said shall come to pass.
[1:05:26] You can have what you said. The placing
[1:05:29] of the church in position
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; where the fullness of the power of the
[1:05:34] Holy Ghost comes into the church.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Then critics's mouths will be shut.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It'll be a short time.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus come right off the mountain, went
[1:05:45] straight to Calvary. Notice it won't
[1:05:48] last long,
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; but it'll be here. Now, now, now that's
[1:05:54] what the prophet said,
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; and I believe that with all of my heart
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; and whether or not the churches can grab
[1:06:04] it or the groups that I think they
[1:06:07] should be saying or should be doing
[1:06:08] that, that really has nothing to do with
[1:06:11] what I just read to you or what the
[1:06:15] prophet just said to all of us that this
[1:06:18] power is going to come and now is coming
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; that sons and daughters of God will
[1:06:25] speak and it'll create. Here he is in
[1:06:27] 1960. He's saying that and he had
[1:06:29] already manifested that.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And he was the first fruits,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; showing what a manifested son looks
[1:06:37] like. He was tested.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; He was tempted. He was tried. Remember
[1:06:43] they tested him in Vermont. Speak death
[1:06:46] to them.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord told him, "Speak
[1:06:49] death. They'll pack him out of here."
[1:06:50] And he he didn't know what to do. He
[1:06:52] said, "I forgive you
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; and Lord, that was the right thing."
[1:06:56] Yes,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; you got the power to do it, but you did
[1:06:59] the right thing with the power.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Now I know I can give you more. You're
[1:07:05] faithful. You were faithful over this.
[1:07:09] Now I can give you this.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:07:15] Let me ask you a question here. Is there
[1:07:18] anywhere in your life you can be more
[1:07:20] faithful?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; You know, faithfulness is not an
[1:07:24] emotion.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; It's not something you feel.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Let's get what faithfulness is. Can I
[1:07:32] read it to you just for a moment?
[1:07:40] Same thing with sincerity.
[1:07:44] the the the the angel of the Lord told
[1:07:48] the prophet, "You must be more sincere."
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; H
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and um
[1:08:00] this the sincerity is the quality of
[1:08:02] being
[1:08:03] without pretense,
[1:08:06] free from deceit or hypocrisy.
[1:08:10] It's the quality of being genuine and
[1:08:13] honest in your thoughts, your feelings,
[1:08:17] and your actions.
[1:08:20] There's no put on about you.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Are you sincere?
[1:08:25] I Is there some showmanship in my
[1:08:28] ministry? Am I up here trying to show
[1:08:30] out or am I really sincere?
[1:08:33] And the Lord told the prophet says if
[1:08:35] you'll be sincere
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; then now you got to be sincere then
[1:08:40] there's more
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; uh I you'll even know the thoughts of
[1:08:46] the heart. So you're here now you're
[1:08:48] pretty sincere but you can be more
[1:08:51] sincere. And if you're sincere then
[1:08:53] you'll it'll get to where you'll know
[1:08:56] the thoughts of the heart. Your ministry
[1:08:57] is right here now. But but if you be
[1:09:00] more sincere it's going to move up to
[1:09:02] here.
[1:09:03] Huh?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Is what the angel of the Lord told him?
[1:09:06] Sincerity is not given. Sincer sincerity
[1:09:09] is something that's on you.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Sincerity is a prayer.
[1:09:16] Lord, make me more sincere.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Take out the pretense. Take out the f
[1:09:22] take out the showmanship. Take make it
[1:09:25] more sincere.
[1:09:27] Make it from my heart,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; from my soul, from my mind, my worship,
[1:09:34] and everything I'm doing. Make it more
[1:09:37] sincere, Lord. Amen.
[1:09:40] You came in here with a level of
[1:09:42] sincerity. You can leave out with a
[1:09:44] greater sincerity.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? Is that right?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; More sincere. And this was the the um
[1:09:54] that came to the prophet there.
[1:09:56] Faithfulness is not an emotion.
[1:09:59] Faithfulness is a character trait.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; It's a value that involves loyalty
[1:10:09] and commitment to someone or something.
[1:10:16] Faithfulness
[1:10:17] it it is um
[1:10:20] more consistent and enduring in quality.
[1:10:25] How many has a faithful friend?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; How many has some friends that you can
[1:10:33] go way back like to high school?
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; It's not a lot of them.
[1:10:41] But if you got one or two, oh, you're
[1:10:44] pretty rich.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; If you got a friend from from your
[1:10:47] neighborhood that stuck it through
[1:10:50] through all your changes, you stuck
[1:10:51] through with all their changes and you
[1:10:52] guys are still friends.
[1:10:55] There's a that's that faithfulness is I
[1:10:58] mean you just don't see it everywhere.
[1:11:01] Not everybody's faithful. Not
[1:11:02] everybody's faithful. They're not loyal.
[1:11:04] They they'll they'll take your your your
[1:11:06] very uh sensitive subjects and spread it
[1:11:09] to everyone else. But a faithful friend,
[1:11:12] he holds that
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; and he he covers you because he's a fa
[1:11:16] he's faithful. A faithful wife, a
[1:11:19] faithful spouse, a faithful friend, a
[1:11:21] faithful brother, somebody that you can
[1:11:24] put your confidence and and trust in and
[1:11:27] even share things with and they will
[1:11:29] protect you because they're faithful to
[1:11:33] you.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And what about if you're faithful to the
[1:11:38] word?
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; What about being faithful to him?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Huh? Help us.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:11:47] make me more faithful.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Can you know some of us we we all should
[1:11:53] be a witness? But are we a faithful
[1:11:55] witness?
[1:11:57] Do we take the opportunities where we
[1:11:59] should Lord make me a faithful witness,
[1:12:03] faithful minister, faithful Christian.
[1:12:06] Those are our prayers that we can we can
[1:12:09] attain to. And these are the qualities
[1:12:13] that our Lord highlighted amongst these
[1:12:16] disciples especially in giving out the
[1:12:19] talents.
[1:12:21] They didn't know
[1:12:23] it was just a test.
[1:12:26] I I you when you study it, I got to
[1:12:30] close here, but when you go deeper into
[1:12:32] this faithful over a few things and
[1:12:35] being ruler over many, then you'll see
[1:12:38] that
[1:12:39] your faithfulness right here, I'm
[1:12:41] talking about 2025 and how many more
[1:12:43] years you live in this age here, is
[1:12:46] definitely correlated to the rewards you
[1:12:49] receive in the millennium.
[1:12:53] Brother Bam says in several places, I
[1:12:55] wish I had time to do it where he talks
[1:12:58] about the day of rewards are coming
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; where re rewards will be given out,
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; you know, and and and some people they
[1:13:11] have taken
[1:13:13] just a terrible
[1:13:16] lot in life. Things horrible things
[1:13:19] happened to them. They it was out of
[1:13:22] their control. They were born a certain
[1:13:24] way. They were born in a certain
[1:13:25] situation. And they have taken that and
[1:13:29] and given their life to the Lord. And
[1:13:31] the Lord has taken that life and just
[1:13:35] exploded it with his blessings and his
[1:13:37] goodness. And then there's others who
[1:13:40] have so many opportunities,
[1:13:43] so many the silver spoon as they say
[1:13:46] that so many things just given to it and
[1:13:48] granted to them and handed to them and
[1:13:50] they let it fall by the wayside. And
[1:13:52] then you have but you have those ones
[1:13:54] that you know everything is a test.
[1:13:56] Everything is a trial. They're coming up
[1:13:57] the rough side of hard things. And when
[1:13:59] you talk to them, you don't see no ill
[1:14:02] effects of all of the foolishness that
[1:14:05] they've been through
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; because they have allowed the Lord to
[1:14:08] take over in their life
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; and they become a tremendous witness.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; You know, some Christians are so down.
[1:14:17] Everything is a complaint. Everything is
[1:14:19] a pain. Everything is hurting.
[1:14:24] Everything. My eyelashes are hurting.
[1:14:28] Everything is hurt. How are you doing?
[1:14:30] Oh, me.
[1:14:32] How you doing, my sister? Oh, do you
[1:14:34] really want to know? Like, I don't think
[1:14:36] I want to know.
[1:14:39] Like, stop.
[1:14:42] You're just supposed to say everything
[1:14:43] is fine. Say, all is well.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And you know, you know, there is a
[1:14:50] there's a um it's connected. What you're
[1:14:53] doing here today is connected in that
[1:14:56] land to come.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; How many know that's true?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; The parables don't lie. The parables
[1:15:05] don't lie.
[1:15:07] I
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder I wonder if pastors and leaders
[1:15:11] and Sunday school teachers will be given
[1:15:13] an opportunity to give their testimony
[1:15:17] of you.
[1:15:21] We we know you faithful because you told
[1:15:23] us, but let your peers testify of your
[1:15:27] faithfulness. I wonder what your peers
[1:15:30] would have to say about you.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You know, your peers are testifying
[1:15:36] about you anyways,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; I've been talking about every one of
[1:15:42] y'all in here,
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; but you never heard me talk about you
[1:15:46] though, have you? And you be talking
[1:15:48] about me too.
[1:15:51] Come on, tell the truth. Shame the
[1:15:53] devil.
[1:15:56] And you know this is definitely is
[1:15:59] definitely connected. You what what what
[1:16:01] we have today. Paul said whatever state
[1:16:04] I am, I learned to be content.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; And this mindset is that we're looking
[1:16:13] far beyond what's going on right now.
[1:16:15] far beyond the temporal things in this
[1:16:18] life. We're looking far beyond. And
[1:16:22] Jesus constantly pointed his disciples
[1:16:24] to this future. So what do we receive
[1:16:27] here? We receive the power,
[1:16:33] but not really power.
[1:16:36] It's authority
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; to use the power is what it is. Now,
[1:16:41] brother Vandom takes this message here
[1:16:45] and he says that um
[1:16:50] he's talking about Elijah, how he used
[1:16:52] that power to curse those children and
[1:16:54] that wasn't the Holy Spirit. It wasn't
[1:16:57] the nature of the Holy Spirit. So, we
[1:17:00] can see where this prophet was given the
[1:17:02] power. He cursed those children and
[1:17:05] kings there. And he says it in at thy
[1:17:08] word. He he talks about it there. Uh let
[1:17:11] me just read it here quickly. My time is
[1:17:12] going. In um paragraph 7, at thy word,
[1:17:18] he says, "You remember that young
[1:17:19] prophet by the name of Elisha who was a
[1:17:22] successor of Elijah? He went ball he
[1:17:25] went baldheaded when he was just a young
[1:17:27] man. Some little children run behind him
[1:17:30] saying, "Oh baldhead, oh baldhead, why
[1:17:32] didn't you go up like Elijah?" And in
[1:17:35] doing so, it angered the that prophet.
[1:17:38] Maybe turning around he had bald no
[1:17:41] maybe a hair on his head. Turned around
[1:17:43] and looked. He knew it was right. The
[1:17:47] children was calling him bald head but
[1:17:49] it angered him and he put a curse on
[1:17:51] those children in the name of the Lord
[1:17:53] and two she bears come out of the woods
[1:17:55] and killed 42 little innocent children.
[1:17:59] Now anyone knows that's not the nature
[1:18:01] of the Holy Spirit. But it was angered.
[1:18:05] It was an angered prophet. See, you have
[1:18:09] to be careful. Examine every case.
[1:18:14] So, if we had that authority and that
[1:18:17] power, I you know, we would probably
[1:18:19] fail the test. We probably fail the
[1:18:20] test. Some of us, we would lose it. I I
[1:18:24] would probably fail the test. But I want
[1:18:26] to get to the place where I won't fail
[1:18:27] that test.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right, somebody?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Where I don't get under pressure, where
[1:18:32] I just slip or I lose it. Amen.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; In a moment, I just lost it. I lost it.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Well, let's get to the place where you
[1:18:39] don't lose it.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; And he he he was put under that pressure
[1:18:43] in that meeting and it said, "Speak
[1:18:45] death." And he passed the test.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Now, in the message, Believe in God,
[1:18:50] prophet of God, says this here,
[1:18:53] paragraph 26,
[1:18:55] the other night there was people here. A
[1:18:57] woman couldn't speak. As soon as that
[1:18:59] evil power was challenged, she spoke
[1:19:04] normally.
[1:19:06] And there was a lady here had a big goer
[1:19:08] on her throat. I just walked up to her
[1:19:10] and said, "Satan, I just have the
[1:19:14] authority to break your power. You have
[1:19:17] to come off of her." I said, "He's
[1:19:20] gone." I said, "Do you believe that?"
[1:19:22] And she said, "Yes."
[1:19:24] So here the prophet of God is given this
[1:19:27] authority over the power of Satan.
[1:19:32] This is in the prayer line of course and
[1:19:34] we see him using this power. He's
[1:19:36] actually spoke to Satan and told him I
[1:19:39] have the power over you. I have the
[1:19:43] authority to move you off of this lady.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52 and believing God. He
[1:19:50] continues. He says is that right? The
[1:19:52] Bible says they'll lay hands on the
[1:19:53] sick. they'll recover. Then when you
[1:19:55] start that, I've tried that and flash
[1:19:57] them through the line, lay hands on
[1:19:59] them, but if they if their life isn't
[1:20:02] combed through by the Holy Spirit to
[1:20:04] find out if there's anything in there,
[1:20:06] they don't feel they've been prayed for.
[1:20:08] Here's my secretary sitting here and
[1:20:10] things that knows gets the letters.
[1:20:13] Isn't that right? They just they're not.
[1:20:15] Now, there I'm up against something. I
[1:20:19] believe I want you to get this one here.
[1:20:22] I believe if I could maybe could preach,
[1:20:25] and I'm not much of a preacher, but if I
[1:20:28] can get the people to see that they've
[1:20:31] got to absolutely come clean with God,
[1:20:35] then I believe I'd have the authority by
[1:20:38] Jesus Christ, break the power of any
[1:20:42] demon there is.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Very nice.
[1:20:49] The people can absolutely come clean
[1:20:51] with God.
[1:20:53] Any demon there is.
[1:20:57] Think about that.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; So, brother Bannon goes forward and
[1:21:02] tells us it's not our power, it's the
[1:21:05] authority.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Christian verse Christianity versus
[1:21:08] idolatry. 1961 287. Now remember, each
[1:21:12] one of you has power in Christ. You
[1:21:15] don't have power. You have authority.
[1:21:18] Your authority. You're just exalted way
[1:21:21] above. Not to be exalt yourself up, but
[1:21:24] Christ has lifted you up. More Christ
[1:21:28] lifts you up, the further you want to be
[1:21:30] down. See, you'll feel so humble. So,
[1:21:33] how would he ever save a wretch like me?
[1:21:36] How did he ever do it? But he did it,
[1:21:39] and I'm so thankful for it. Amen. So
[1:21:43] good. the message inside. You say,
[1:21:45] "Brother Vandom, do you have power?" I
[1:21:47] wish I had power. We don't have power.
[1:21:51] We're not have power. We got authority.
[1:21:55] It's not a power. It's authority. We
[1:21:58] don't need power. Christ has the power,
[1:22:00] but we got the authority. Amen. There's
[1:22:04] a lot of difference. He was the one who
[1:22:06] conquered. He conquered and gave us the
[1:22:10] authority.
[1:22:11] He's got the power but we got the
[1:22:14] authority just like any ambassador going
[1:22:17] to another country.
[1:22:22] Yes.
[1:22:24] And that's what he has given us this
[1:22:29] authority but we are afraid to use it.
[1:22:37] We're afraid to use it.
[1:22:41] My last quote is that faith is a
[1:22:42] substance 1951.
[1:22:45] The musicians can come please.
[1:22:49] And the prophet of God says this here.
[1:22:54] But I can stand and pray for you until
[1:22:56] this time next year. It would never do
[1:22:58] you a bit of good until first you accept
[1:23:01] Jesus Christ as your healer. And if any
[1:23:04] of these ministers standing here would
[1:23:06] be standing in my place and you come and
[1:23:10] believe that God hears their prayer,
[1:23:13] you'd be healed just the same as if you
[1:23:17] would be if Jesus himself was standing
[1:23:20] here praying for you.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; That's a hard word, isn't it? But it's
[1:23:25] the truth. He gave all the power and
[1:23:29] authority that he had to his church and
[1:23:33] you're just afraid to act upon it. Now
[1:23:38] you believe that.
[1:23:40] So God help us to act upon that.
[1:23:44] Ruth caring for Naomi seemed like a
[1:23:47] small thing. Job sacrificing for his
[1:23:50] children, just a small thing.
[1:23:53] David over his father's sheep seems just
[1:23:56] a small thing. Abraham fighting for a
[1:24:01] nephew that really didn't deserve it.
[1:24:03] But God saw all that service and he
[1:24:07] blessed them. And God sees our service
[1:24:11] today. And God has given us the
[1:24:13] authority over every devil, every demon,
[1:24:17] every sickness. It's been given to the
[1:24:19] church of of the living God tonight.
[1:24:21] been given to us and it will continue to
[1:24:25] pour in more. Brother Banner makes a
[1:24:27] statement that um there will be no
[1:24:30] scientific achievements
[1:24:33] over there
[1:24:35] and that you know science they're
[1:24:39] using their great powers
[1:24:43] to
[1:24:44] to rule and reign. they they have their
[1:24:46] great achievements that they're doing
[1:24:49] and um
[1:24:52] but it's all going to come to an end one
[1:24:53] day. But all the power that God poured
[1:24:56] into his church will never come to an
[1:24:58] end. It's just an advance advance
[1:25:01] advancement and that's the way the way
[1:25:03] we'll live in the millennium and the
[1:25:05] great new home that we're going to. um
[1:25:10] this scient scientific achievements.
[1:25:13] They have really they they they they're
[1:25:16] able to you know they say the next the
[1:25:19] next wars will be fought by robots and
[1:25:23] and with this with satellites and so
[1:25:26] your next five-star general could be an
[1:25:29] IT guy
[1:25:31] or a girl. Nobody's on the boots on the
[1:25:34] ground fighting that way. It's all
[1:25:36] technical. all but all that's going to
[1:25:38] be done away with and the power that
[1:25:40] he's investing in his church today
[1:25:43] will ever remain
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; and so we're gaining and we thank God
[1:25:47] for it. We see an great example in the
[1:25:51] life of our our brother Brandham and we
[1:25:54] want that to be our example. God bless
[1:25:56] you richly. Let's take these requests to
[1:26:01] the Lord that we have
[1:26:04] sister Barbara's
[1:26:06] as a request for her two brothers. They
[1:26:09] have two very serious health needs and
[1:26:13] we want to keep them in prayer. Brother
[1:26:14] Bob, Bobby and brother Michael, keep
[1:26:17] them in prayer. Erin and Rachel at not
[1:26:20] feeling well. Sister Aaron, Sister

[1:27:33] his skin and his neck and nose area. So,

[1:27:40] speedily that he can be here Sunday. He
[1:27:43] wants to be here Sunday. Was there
[1:27:44] somebody else? Yes.

[1:50:16] So thankful. I was praying there and
[1:50:18] that song came to mind. So glad I'm
[1:50:21] yours. And it started playing a moment
[1:50:23] later. So it kind of touched me. So, I'd
[1:50:25] like to do that with you. Undeserving
[1:50:27] how we are, but just like our children,
[1:50:29] we want to do every for everything for
[1:50:31] them. Brother John reminding us the big
[1:50:33] ocean pushing through a straw is what he
[1:50:35] wants to do for us if we just accept it
[1:50:38] and and believe him tonight.

[1:52:40] Amen.
[1:52:42] Let's pray together. If Anna you put
[1:52:44] those on the the screen, we'll just run
[1:52:46] through those again and we'll all pray
[1:52:48] together for each of these and the needs
[1:52:49] on your heart. I know we have a family
[1:52:51] member or a a financial or physical or
[1:52:54] spiritual need. We'll just commit that
[1:52:56] to the Lord. Our sister Heather, Sister
[1:52:58] Alexandra, the Samurano family, I think
[1:53:01] portion of them are traveling. Is that
[1:53:03] right, Zach? And uh several others
[1:53:05] traveling. Um remember these sister
[1:53:08] Aaron and Rachel homesick. Uh, brother
[1:53:11] Bobby, brother Michael Wartz, devil
[1:53:14] trying to attack both of them on the
[1:53:15] same same time. And so we hold them up.
[1:53:18] Our sister Barbara family, brother
[1:53:21] Israel, sister Sharon. You know, at
[1:53:23] work, we ask if it's a business trip or
[1:53:25] a PTO, paid time off trip. I suppose
[1:53:28] it's always business trips, but pray
[1:53:30] that they could enjoy their time out of
[1:53:32] the city. and we'll hold them up as he's
[1:53:34] on the the missionary field for our
[1:53:37] precious brother Joe Galante and his

[1:53:42] reservation. The funeral on Friday for
[1:53:44] the Wheeler, Sister Jackie, Sister

[1:54:33] Lord, knowing though you've ordered the
[1:54:36] steps, Lord. And and we commit each one
[1:54:38] of these knees to you in faith,
[1:54:39] believing, Lord. Our hearts certainly go

[1:55:27] the office, at church, even, Lord, that
[1:55:30] you just help us to be humble, to be
