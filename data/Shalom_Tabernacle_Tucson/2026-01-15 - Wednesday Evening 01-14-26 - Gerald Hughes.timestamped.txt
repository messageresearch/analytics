[6:51] word.
[6:52] We just ask you to forgive us where
[6:54] we're short
[6:56] that you'd come and dwell in the midst
[6:59] of us
[7:01] like that day on Pentecost. Lord, we all
[7:05] need that Pentecostal experience.
[7:09] We just ask you, Father, to be with us.
[7:15] Be in our worship.
[7:18] Receive our worship.
[7:20] Receive our incense, Lord, as we turn
[7:23] aside to pray unto you. There's many
[7:26] needs.

[7:32] ask you to come and dwell with us. You
[7:36] came with us, Lord. you.

[8:27] we are sealed.
[8:30] Oh hallelujah.
[8:33] to the lamb
[8:36] of God.

[9:27] I'm living by faith in Jesus above.

[9:38] or rain.
[9:40] The Lord I know rule is for everything
[9:45] and all of my worry is free.
[9:50] Oh, I'm living like faith

[10:16] Thank you, Lord. I'm living my faith.
[10:23] Thank you, Lord.
[10:27] Though tempest may blow and the storm
[10:30] clouds arise obscuring the brightness of
[10:35] light.
[10:37] I hear alarmed as the overcast side. The

[11:23] I know that he saves me will carry me
[11:26] through. No matter what evil it's high,
[11:32] why should I then care though the
[11:35] tempest may blow. If Jesus walks close
[11:39] to my side,

[15:00] God bless you. Sister Lee. Brother
[15:02] Menmo. Do you happen to have a song for
[15:04] tonight as well?
[15:06] If you'd like, you want to think about
[15:08] one after sister
[15:24] Troubled.
[15:33] Oh, trouble's coming.
[15:36] Oh, the squeeze is on its way.
[15:42] But in the time of trouble,
[15:45] he'll hide me in his pavilion.
[15:51] Oh, trouble's coming,
[15:54] but I'll not be afraid.
[15:59] Oh, trouble's coming,
[16:02] but I'm not troubled.
[16:05] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[16:09] its way.
[16:11] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[16:14] me in his pavilion.
[16:17] Trouble's coming.
[16:19] I'll not be afraid.
[16:23] In the days of Sodom,
[16:25] Sodom and Gomorrah,
[16:29] they were sinning left and right,
[16:31] sinning night and day.
[16:34] They wouldn't listen,
[16:37] so they were blinded.
[16:40] When trouble's coming,
[16:43] best get out the way.
[16:46] Oh, trouble's coming,
[16:49] but I'm not troubled.
[16:52] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[16:56] its way.
[16:58] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[17:01] me in his pavilion.
[17:04] Trouble's coming.
[17:07] I'll not be afraid.
[17:10] In the days of Noah,
[17:13] well, they were scientific.
[17:16] They could shoot the moon and say there
[17:19] was no rain.
[17:22] They didn't need
[17:25] no prophet Noah.
[17:28] So God sent Wormwood to wash those
[17:31] foolish men away.
[17:34] Oh, trouble's coming,
[17:37] but I'm not troubled.
[17:40] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[17:44] its way.
[17:46] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[17:49] me in his famil.
[17:52] Trouble's coming, but I'll not be
[17:56] afraid.
[17:58] In the days of Moses,
[18:01] they were a stiff necked people.
[18:04] They could see the hand of God, but
[18:07] still complain.
[18:10] And there were those who spoke against
[18:14] the prophet.
[18:16] Evil's coming,
[18:19] but I'm not troubled.
[18:22] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[18:26] its way.
[18:28] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[18:31] me in his pavilion.
[18:34] Trouble's coming.
[18:37] I'll not be afraid.
[18:40] In the days of Elijah,
[18:43] well, there were many prophets,
[18:46] 450 of Baal worshiping the sun.
[18:52] But only one man could pray down the
[18:56] fire.
[18:58] He took them down to the river and he
[19:01] slew them. Everyone,
[19:04] oh, trouble's coming,
[19:07] but I'm not trouble.
[19:10] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[19:14] its way.
[19:16] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[19:19] in his pavilion.
[19:22] Trouble's coming.
[19:25] I'll not be afraid.
[19:28] Now, there are those
[19:31] who say they knew our prophet.
[19:34] But they say he made mistakes. Oh, what
[19:37] a shame.
[19:40] What kind of watered down message do
[19:43] they follow?
[19:46] I say the prophets's right and Jesus
[19:48] Christ is still the same.
[19:52] Oh, trouble's coming,
[19:55] but I'm not troubled.
[19:58] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[20:01] its way.
[20:04] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[20:07] me in his pavilion.
[20:10] Trouble's coming.
[20:12] I'll not be afraid.
[20:16] Oh, trouble's coming,
[20:19] but I'm not troubled.
[20:22] Trouble's coming. Oh, the squeeze is on
[20:25] its way.
[20:28] But in the time of trouble, he'll hide
[20:31] me in his pavilion.
[20:34] Troubles cometh.
[20:36] I not be afraid.
[20:40] In the time of trouble, he'll hide me in
[20:43] his pavilion.
[20:46] Trouble's coming.
[20:50] Troules coming.
[20:53] I'll not be afraid.
[21:29] Amen. Thank you. It's a blessing to be
[21:32] here again today. And I want to say um
[21:35] this is going to be our last service
[21:37] here with you. And uh it's been kind of
[21:40] refreshing both physically and
[21:42] spiritually with our feet under your
[21:44] tables at the various places and the
[21:47] times we've had both natural and
[21:49] spiritual fellowship. It's been great.
[21:51] And uh thank you so much. If we don't uh
[21:55] cross paths again on this side, we'll
[21:58] we'll be looking for one another. I kind
[22:00] of thinking of how brother Bram said
[22:01] about him going and sister hope and said
[22:04] uh when I come just start hauling Bill
[22:08] and I think that's maybe I don't know
[22:10] what it'll be just like when we get to
[22:11] the other side but I think we'll be look
[22:13] for me for I'll be there somewhere
[22:16] maybe it take a thousand years well well
[22:17] the first thousand years we'll be here
[22:19] but but we're looking for that's the
[22:22] greatest consolation we have the body

[22:58] of Jesus the Nazarine.
[23:04] And I wondered how he could love
[23:10] me a sinner
[23:13] condemned.
[23:16] I guess I don't know that one. How

[32:48] Where
[32:55] is
[33:02] your
[33:10] break ground?
[33:36] If you have your Bibles,
[33:39] turn with me to the book of Ephesians,
[33:42] chapter
[33:44] five. And I'd like to draw your
[33:47] attention to verse 32.
[33:50] And uh
[33:54] you should never come to Sunday school
[33:57] class without your curriculum.
[33:59] Always bring your textbook.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[34:03] &gt;&gt; That's good to see all these Bibles.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We greet you in the
[34:09] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:11] And it's just a real honor for me to be
[34:14] here. Amen. To
[34:20] &gt;&gt; uh testimony of the grace of God in my
[34:23] life.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; And I really do deem this a very special
[34:27] privilege,
[34:28] &gt;&gt; a real honor to me to stand in the
[34:31] presence of God's children and
[34:33] especially with my good friend, brother
[34:35] Israel Pope. Now, one verse of scripture
[34:38] here and then I'll let you be seated. If
[34:40] you promise to stay awake,
[34:43] &gt;&gt; okay? Otherwise, well, I can sit down.
[34:45] You can I'll keep you standing.
[34:49] We don't want you going to sleep on the
[34:50] preacher.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; You know, there's only one thing worse
[34:53] than going to sleep on the preacher.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; That's for the preacher to go to sleep
[34:57] on the congregation.
[34:59] We don't want that to happen. I got a
[35:01] little nap today, so I'm okay. Have to
[35:03] get a little power nap once in a while.
[35:06] Some of these old-timers know what I'm
[35:08] talking about.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was real short, but it was
[35:11] sweet.
[35:15] Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 32.
[35:22] This is a great mystery, but I speak
[35:24] concerning Christ and the church.
[35:28] Let's bow our heads for just a word of
[35:30] prayer now. And uh perhaps you've
[35:33] already had prayer requests, but with
[35:36] our heads bowed, I want you to ask just
[35:39] look into your heart and say, "What's in
[35:42] your heart?" With your eyes closed, say,
[35:44] "Lord, what's my purpose of being here
[35:47] tonight? And what do I need from thee?
[35:50] What do I need from you, Lord?" And then
[35:53] our thoughts, remember now our thoughts,
[35:55] your thoughts, my thoughts, they speak
[35:58] louder in heaven than our words do on
[36:00] earth.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; So God knows the need of your heart. He
[36:04] knows the burden of your heart. And he's
[36:06] able to minister to that need right here
[36:08] in this service tonight. Amen. Do you
[36:11] believe that?
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Sure he is. Heavenly Father, we've read
[36:15] your word and we submit ourselves to you
[36:18] now, endeavoring, Lord, to submit
[36:22] ourselves, surrender ourselves, but
[36:24] Lord, yet it takes you to consecrate us.
[36:27] And we pray now that you'll uh just
[36:30] minister to every need that is among us.
[36:32] We're all needy people, Lord. Some might
[36:35] need healing, some might need financial
[36:38] blessings, Lord, spiritual blessings,
[36:41] whatever it might be. And it's not
[36:44] difficult for us to ask this because
[36:46] it's written in your word.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; You've expressed your desires. You said,
[36:50] "Beloved, I wish above all things that
[36:52] thou mayest prosper and be in health,
[36:55] even as thy soul prosperth."
[36:58] &gt;&gt; So, we're here seeking first the kingdom
[37:00] of God in his righteousness.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; Our righteousness is as filthy rags,
[37:06] Lord. We don't want to trust in that at
[37:08] all. We don't bring that in our prayer.
[37:10] We don't think of our our we have none
[37:13] Lord but your righteousness
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Lord is what we want imputed to us in
[37:18] this prayer and in this service tonight
[37:20] help us we pray minister to us continue
[37:24] to bless this assembly Lord uh with
[37:27] their new church and oh Lord I pray that
[37:30] you'll just fill up every pew Lord and
[37:33] just pour out a blessing Lord that we
[37:36] wouldn't have room to contain it
[37:38] &gt;&gt; and each little liquid fire that has
[37:40] come tonight. Lord, may it manifest as
[37:43] the pillar of fire in our midst. Grant
[37:46] it, Lord. The person of the pillar of
[37:48] fire, the love, the lovely Lord Jesus.
[37:52] Hallelujah. Grant these blessings. Look
[37:54] into every heart. Minister to every need
[37:57] through your word.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If
[38:02] you'll shake your neighbor's hand, I'll
[38:04] let you be seated. Or behind you or in
[38:07] front of you, say, "God bless you,
[38:08] pilgrim. It's good to be in the house of
[38:10] the Lord.
[38:14] First of all, I wanted to bring a good
[38:16] report because the Lord uh has certainly
[38:20] been answering prayer
[38:22] and um there's so many things of course
[38:25] that we could say about that. But uh the
[38:30] prayer request was made last night. a
[38:33] very very special prayer request for me.
[38:36] And uh it was uh
[38:41] it's it's this thing is a lot like my
[38:43] token.
[38:45] It's my passport.
[38:47] And I got a fresh one this morning right
[38:51] here from Tucson. And I'm so thankful
[38:54] because this is part of my purpose of
[38:56] being here today was just to get this
[38:59] passport. And um I just uh what
[39:03] happened? I'll try to be real brief, but
[39:05] um I've had to go in I've had passports
[39:09] lost in the mail so often that they
[39:11] reported it as stolen. Then then
[39:12] whenever you report it stolen, then they
[39:15] they don't want to give you another
[39:16] passport. You know, somebody stole it or
[39:18] you misusing it or whatever. So the last
[39:20] passport I got, they only gave it to me
[39:22] for one year
[39:24] because of that. And so this time I
[39:28] gathered up all all the passports that I
[39:30] could find.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, five, and now I
[39:36] got number six. And I think there's the
[39:38] number seven they kept up there. So I've
[39:40] got about seven or eight passports. None
[39:42] of them, as far as I know, have ever
[39:43] been stolen. Okay?
[39:46] But when I showed them all these
[39:47] passports, they gave me a fresh one.
[39:50] Guess what?
[39:53] This is a great blessing. And I the
[39:56] devil really tried to make me doubt.
[39:58] It's okay to doubt if you doubt your
[39:59] doubts.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:03] Yeah. Brother Brandham was quoting
[40:04] brother Bosorth on that one. I think he
[40:06] said it's okay to doubt as long as you
[40:08] just doubt your doubts.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; But uh
[40:13] this passport is good for another 10
[40:15] years. January 14th of January. Is today
[40:19] the 14th?
[40:20] &gt;&gt; 14th of January. Uh 2026.
[40:25] the 13th of January, 2036.
[40:30] And this old-timer will be 80 in the
[40:33] month of May.
[40:35] And um in the month of May, 10 years
[40:38] from now, I'll be 90.
[40:40] So you pray the Lord just keep me
[40:42] pressing the battle. I appreciate your
[40:45] prayers. the the brothers prayed last
[40:48] night that we'd be able to get this
[40:49] passport and it came one of the easiest
[40:53] um
[40:55] answers to prayer, you know, and of
[40:57] course, uh the enemy has fought me
[41:00] today, but we won't go there. We don't
[41:03] want to give the devil any do. Is that
[41:05] right? We don't want to We're not here
[41:06] to praise the devil. We're here to
[41:08] praise the Lord.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, the devil all he all he
[41:12] is is just a big bluff.
[41:15] Amen. Just a big bluff.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; He was absolutely stripped of any right
[41:21] or authority power that he had at
[41:23] Calvary.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was stripped. And uh so tonight
[41:30] I I want to share with you. I uh just a
[41:33] little brief testimony and then we'll go
[41:35] right into the message.
[41:37] you know, uh I think it was Hudson
[41:40] Taylor or one of the great missionaries
[41:42] might have been uh him I believe it was
[41:45] brother Brennham quoted a young man
[41:47] asked him should I now that I've got
[41:49] converted should I go to Bible college
[41:51] and four years and this that and the
[41:53] other get my degree oh he said no son
[41:56] don't do that he said why don't wait
[41:59] till the candle is have burned out just
[42:01] go tell how your candle got lit
[42:04] &gt;&gt; amen
[42:05] &gt;&gt; and so uh I um I didn't know what to do,
[42:11] but in I'd heard a few tapes in 1960,
[42:16] well actually the Lord got a hold of me
[42:18] in 1964.
[42:21] And I mean, he had to do a a real work
[42:24] on me.
[42:26] He brought sanctification into my heart
[42:28] and life. Took away uh alcohol and
[42:33] nicotine. And by the grace of the Lord,
[42:35] I never did get hooked on drugs. But um
[42:40] he and just by the grace of God, but he
[42:45] he changed my desires.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I drink all I want to and I
[42:50] smoke all I want to, but I just don't
[42:51] want to.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; He took away the want to.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it happened real, you know,
[42:58] supernaturally.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; And um that was in ' 64. I'd been so
[43:04] mean and stubbornheaded and
[43:05] hard-hearted. It took about a year of
[43:08] fasting and praying and trying to, you
[43:10] know, where I could even really believe
[43:12] I could be saved. I I so, you know, but
[43:15] I felt his presence and I knew, oh, I
[43:17] knew he was real.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so then, uh, I had worked with
[43:24] brother Bud Chambers. Some of you might
[43:26] have heard of him, a tent revivalist in
[43:29] there in the latter part of 64 and 65.
[43:32] Then I was drafted into the military. I
[43:34] didn't get to meet brother Brandham. Uh
[43:36] I was drafted in during the Vietnam era
[43:40] and instead of however sending me to uh
[43:44] Vietnam. Now if they'd have got a hold
[43:46] of me a little bit sooner, I'd have been
[43:47] ready to shed blood. But after the Lord
[43:49] got a hold of me, I actually uh it was
[43:53] during the draft, mandatory draft. And
[43:55] so I registered as a conscientious
[43:58] objector. I'd shed enough blood, you
[44:01] know, and uh but now they didn't pay any
[44:05] attention to that. They throwed a rifle
[44:06] in my hand and put me out there and
[44:09] taught me handtohand combat and how to
[44:11] familiarize with the old M14 and so
[44:14] forth. And uh I thought, sure, it looked
[44:16] like they was going to send me to
[44:18] Vietnam, but they sent me to Germany. Uh
[44:21] two months of advanced uh two months of
[44:23] basic training in Fort Benning, Georgia.
[44:26] Two months of advanced individual
[44:27] training. We called it AIT in Fort
[44:30] Leonardwood, Missouri. And then they
[44:32] sent most of my unit, that's the Army
[44:35] Corps of Engineers. And they sent most
[44:37] of my unit to Vietnam and most of them
[44:40] didn't come back. Okay,
[44:43] that's the truth. But they God by his
[44:46] grace sent me to Germany. And so there
[44:49] the Lord blessed me tremendously. I had
[44:52] surrendered to the Lord and was subject.
[44:54] It was those two years in Germany was
[44:57] good for me. And they gave me a
[45:00] honorable discharge, believe it or not.
[45:03] And uh a good conduct medal. In fact,
[45:06] and now it wasn't me at all. It was just
[45:08] the grace of God. You understand? I
[45:10] hadn't even recognized the message yet.
[45:12] But they also chose myself and one other
[45:15] soldier as the two outstanding soldiers
[45:17] of the whole 237th Engineer Battalion.
[45:20] And I got to come home free on a on a 40
[45:23] day 30 40-day leave. And uh but I said
[45:28] all that to say this. I really didn't
[45:31] get my candle lit until I come to the
[45:32] light of this message.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got out of the army in ' 67.
[45:40] Drifted in ' 65, last part of 65. Got
[45:44] out in the latter part of ' 67
[45:47] and uh started my public ministry. I
[45:50] well actually they wanted me to reup.
[45:51] They offered me quite a bit of money if
[45:53] I would reup
[45:55] um take another two or three years stent
[45:58] with them. But I said no I uh I said I'm
[46:03] feeling in my heart that I've got to
[46:05] preach the gospel.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And I said I can't do it as a GI
[46:11] government issue. It's got to be a God
[46:13] issue.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; And I I have to take my orders from him
[46:17] not from you all. Amen. And so um then
[46:22] uh I got out started my public ministry
[46:25] in 1967
[46:27] and uh it really trend in my concept you
[46:31] know uh didn't have any revelation of
[46:33] water baptism but then as the Lord began
[46:36] to unfold the scriptures to me and uh I
[46:39] ministered mostly in Arkansas, Oklahoma,
[46:42] Missouri and Kansas just mostly little
[46:44] independent churches. They tried to get
[46:46] me to join the UPC and the Assembly of
[46:49] God churches, but I just oh I just
[46:52] something in my heart said, "No, you
[46:53] better not do that." And so anyway, I
[46:57] just said that to say this that uh
[46:59] eventually then uh I I seen water
[47:03] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[47:05] Christ.
[47:07] Acts 238,
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Acts 6, Acts 19, you know, it's all
[47:12] through the scriptures. And no, no
[47:15] in titles, father, son, and holy ghost.
[47:18] I seen the importance of the name of the
[47:20] lovely Lord Jesus. Well, when I started
[47:23] preaching one God
[47:26] and water baptism and the name of the
[47:28] Lord Jesus Christ, I become a false
[47:30] prophet to all my trinitarian friends.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; And my popularity went way down real
[47:37] quick.
[47:39] But I believe that I had to walk in that
[47:41] light. You understand? And if you don't
[47:42] walk in the light God reveals to you,
[47:45] regardless of how little it is, what it
[47:47] is, you must walk in that light.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Okay? Then God began to open up more
[47:52] light to me. And that's whenever, now I
[47:56] see I'm just slow and uh actually right
[47:59] after I was the Lord had got a hold of
[48:01] me when I was 17 years old, one of the
[48:03] first books that was given to me was a
[48:05] man sent from God. I read that. But I
[48:08] want you to remember now that really
[48:09] doesn't place brother Brandham in the
[48:11] scriptures. It's an outstanding message
[48:13] book. Uh Gordon Lindsay uh was helped
[48:16] him with that and so forth. But then in
[48:20] 19 after hearing a few tapes uh there uh
[48:25] still in Northwest Arkansas.
[48:28] Uh but after hearing a few tapes of
[48:30] brother Brandham, I still didn't catch
[48:32] it. I couldn't I I knew there was
[48:34] something special about that. And then
[48:36] uh this thought of the baptism of the
[48:38] Holy Ghost, what's the evidence of the
[48:40] Holy Ghost and so forth. And um so then
[48:44] uh I was invited to a service where
[48:47] brother Junior Jackson, you've heard
[48:49] brother uh brother Brandham speak of
[48:51] brother Jackson.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; He was ministering over in Prior
[48:54] Oklahoma in 1968 at brother Ever
[48:58] Thornton's church. And I I was invited
[49:01] to go to that and my friend of mine uh
[49:03] came into the message about the same
[49:05] time with me. We went that night.
[49:07] Brother Jackson preached a message
[49:09] entitled royalty introduced.
[49:12] And of course he was showing Jesus
[49:14] Christ is royalty, right? Amen.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; But he showed he also he had to have an
[49:18] introduction. Proper royalty must have a
[49:21] proper introduction. And so he showed
[49:24] John the Baptist all the scriptures
[49:26] pertaining to his first advent. Malachi
[49:29] 3, uh, Isaiah 40, except the voice one
[49:32] crying in the wilderness, all these
[49:33] scriptures speaking of John's ministry.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; But he said, if you'll notice, John's
[49:39] name wasn't in the Bible
[49:41] until after his ministry. Okay? And so
[49:45] then after he said, now if he is the
[49:47] same, Malachi 3:6, I'm God and I change
[49:50] not.
[49:53] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the same
[49:55] yesterday today and if he's God and he
[49:57] doesn't change his way or his tactics
[49:59] whatever his mannerism you know his
[50:03] principles doesn't change then he must
[50:05] have a forerunner at his second advent
[50:07] and here we are now at the second advent
[50:10] but where is the forerunner where is the
[50:12] message that's the do the forerunning
[50:15] and he began to show then all the
[50:17] scriptures oh my
[50:19] Luke 17, Revelations 10, Malachi 4, all
[50:24] of these scriptures. And then I
[50:27] I seen then Brother Brennham's ministry
[50:30] right in the Bible.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; You understand? And not just Brother
[50:34] Brandham's ministry, it's your ministry.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It's our ministry.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Do you realize
[50:40] um I'm going to embarrass myself. I had
[50:43] such a good time last night with the
[50:45] brothers from Canada and so forth. And
[50:49] um uh right, how do you pronounce that
[50:53] last name, brother?
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Ding.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Ding. Ding. Ding. Brother Dingwall. And
[50:59] of course, brother Minnow. He's a he's
[51:01] been a fish for a long time. Ma. He at
[51:05] one time he was a Ma. Now he's a big
[51:07] rainbow trout.
[51:11] But I had such a good time over brother
[51:13] Israel's and sister Po's place last
[51:15] night and they are well I better be
[51:17] careful. You all be invading their
[51:19] kitchen. But I surely did enjoy that
[51:21] meal too. And we had a wonderful time of
[51:24] fellowship and then I slipped off. Uh we
[51:27] had a little longer service last night
[51:28] than what we're going to have tonight.
[51:30] I'm I've already set my alarm here. So
[51:32] you help me. Uh if you'll listen real
[51:34] fast, I'll try to get done real fast.
[51:36] Okay. And that clock on the wall is not
[51:39] right back there. Something's off, I
[51:41] think, because it's it says 41:22,
[51:45] but I've got a clock right here, and I
[51:47] have no excuses for holding you over
[51:49] time, and I realize it's Wednesday
[51:50] night. Okay, so uh brother uh the
[51:56] brother gave me he gave me a an hour. I
[52:00] asked and he gave me a whole hour.
[52:02] Sometimes back home, I only get 45
[52:04] minutes. But tonight, but I've got I've
[52:07] got my alarm set. And I told him, I
[52:09] said, "Now, if I should happen to go
[52:13] overtime a little bit,
[52:16] I want you to pull my coat.
[52:21] You can pull it. I'm going
[52:24] right there." Where was I at? Okay. But
[52:27] look, uh,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; say it again.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Um,
[52:36] yes. God used brother Jackson. And how
[52:40] many believe God still uses preachers?
[52:44] &gt;&gt; As long as you're saying the same thing,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; you're prophesying again
[52:49] &gt;&gt; as to say the same thing. Eat the book,
[52:51] John.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; And then you must prophesy again for
[52:56] many nations and kings and so forth.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; And the word prophesy means to say the
[53:01] same thing. You've got thus sayaith the
[53:03] Lord. So, uh, anyway, from there on, I
[53:07] really I just, you know, of course, I'll
[53:10] always appreciate Brother Jackson, and I
[53:13] expect to spend eternity with him, but I
[53:16] had to come right under Brother
[53:17] Brandham's ministry, you understand, and
[53:19] stay with the tapes and the the
[53:21] teachings there. And so, I started
[53:23] pastoring a little church there that
[53:25] Brother Brandham was instrumental in
[53:27] starting. Uh, he had come to Columbia,
[53:29] South Carolina twice. You'll find about
[53:31] four different messages recorded there,
[53:34] but I again I didn't get to meet him.
[53:36] Brother Ned Iverson was the first pastor
[53:38] there. And brother Jack Palmer, you've
[53:40] heard brother Brandham speak of brother
[53:42] Palmer. He invited me uh to go over and
[53:45] minister in his church in Mon, Georgia.
[53:47] And then he took me over to South
[53:49] Carolina where I ministered a couple of
[53:51] times there. And then Brother Ned
[53:53] resigned right after that. And um then
[53:56] they asked me to come back and pastor uh
[54:00] there. So actually um yeah, I pastored
[54:03] the same church since 1973.
[54:06] And so um that uh that doesn't make me a
[54:12] better pastor than anybody else. It just
[54:13] makes me more wore out. Okay? And I I'm
[54:17] I should be more without excuse than
[54:19] anybody else having had that opportunity
[54:21] so long. But then while I was there uh
[54:26] pastoring
[54:28] uh actually when I let me back up just a
[54:31] little bit when I got out of the army
[54:32] and this is going to be tying in with my
[54:33] message. Okay.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; I want to read a scripture now before I
[54:37] go forward in my little testimony and
[54:39] let's let's read um
[54:42] uh
[54:44] Song of Solomon chapter 8 and verse
[54:47] eight. Song of Solomon. You've got um
[54:51] Psalms, Proverbs,
[54:54] Ecclesiastes, and then I believe Song of
[54:57] Solomon. All right. And so chapter 8 is
[55:00] the last chapter
[55:02] and um verse eight. See if I can find it
[55:06] here myself.
[55:08] Yes.
[55:10] I want you to notice this and if the
[55:13] brother um yes here we are on the screen
[55:17] as well in case you uh can't find your
[55:19] Bible right quick. We have a little
[55:22] sister and she hath no breast.
[55:28] No breasts.
[55:30] What shall we do for our sister in the
[55:33] day when she shall be spoken for?
[55:37] Now before we go forward, I want to
[55:40] remind you that in the message Christ
[55:42] the mystery of God revealed, brother
[55:44] Brandham said if you can read one
[55:45] scripture in the Bible and you don't see
[55:48] Jesus Christ in that scripture, you need
[55:51] to read it again.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So everything should be focused on him.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because he's the principal theme
[55:59] of the Old Testament. He's the principal
[56:01] theme of the New Testament. And uh
[56:03] brother Brandham didn't really get to
[56:05] speak as much as I'm sure that he would
[56:08] like to have uh concerning uh this um
[56:14] but I'm going to ask my brother to skip
[56:16] forward just a little bit in this group
[56:18] of quotes that I've got. And I said I
[56:21] sure don't want to put my own
[56:22] interpretation to this scripture. So, I
[56:25] found where brother Brennham is
[56:26] referring to the Song of Solomon in the
[56:29] message uh future home of the earthly
[56:32] bride in the heavenly bridegroom. And um
[56:36] this is the only place that I could
[56:37] find. I'm not saying he didn't minister
[56:39] on it anywhere else, but I'm wondering
[56:41] if we could pull up that quote um on the
[56:45] screen if you will, my dear brother. And
[56:49] I want to I want to speak tonight.
[56:54] I want to speak
[56:56] on the subject of the mystery of
[56:58] marriage. Okay.
[57:02] How many people in here, husband or
[57:05] wife, that you are or have been married?
[57:10] Oh, that's the majority by far. Okay.
[57:14] Hands down, how many would need to like
[57:17] to be married?
[57:20] Okay. Well, that's that's good.
[57:22] Wonderful. Praise the Lord. You girls
[57:24] say these hands up front.
[57:28] You these boys don't look back. Okay.
[57:31] But now we all want to be married to the
[57:34] Lord Jesus.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; We should all say, "Amen. I want to be a
[57:38] member of the bride of Christ." Above
[57:40] all,
[57:41] God is a man.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; God wanted a bride before the foundation
[57:46] of the world.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; It's a godly attribute for a young man
[57:49] to want a bride.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. and a young lady to want a a a
[57:54] husband. The best gift that God could
[57:56] give a man outside of salvation, the
[57:59] best gift that God could give a woman
[58:01] outside of salvation,
[58:03] a good husband or a good wife, a
[58:06] Christian one. But remember, he said,
[58:07] "You be sure they believe just exactly
[58:09] like you." Amen. If you get them before
[58:13] they get the Holy Ghost, you might get a
[58:16] &gt;&gt; you might instead of getting
[58:18] &gt;&gt; you you might get water in your blood.
[58:21] Amen. So, we don't want that. And so,
[58:25] here while I was there um in our brother
[58:29] be pointed that quote. It's from um
[58:33] future home of the earthly bride where
[58:35] brother Brandon refers to the Song of
[58:37] Solomon. It's among those little group
[58:39] of quotes that I gave you uh brother
[58:41] Nathan. now. But while I was there
[58:44] pastoring in Colombia, okay,
[58:48] uh confession that I actually uh was um
[58:53] pastoring for about two years before I
[58:56] got married. In those days, I was kind
[58:59] of uh oddball in so much that I was
[59:02] probably the youngest minister in the
[59:04] message. Now, I'm kind of oddball
[59:06] because I'm one of the oldest ministers
[59:08] in the message, but I'm certainly glad
[59:11] to be identified with brother Minnow.
[59:13] He's he's up there. He's my elder. And
[59:16] uh but I said that to say this that I'm
[59:20] not recommending somebody to pastor
[59:21] before they get married. Okay? Even
[59:24] though Paul, you know, he was I guess
[59:27] more than a pastor in so much that he
[59:29] was an apostle and setting the churches
[59:30] in order. But I I I ended up they wanted
[59:34] me to come and pastor. And so I went I
[59:36] said I can't do that exact exactly like
[59:39] that. But I said I'll minister for you
[59:40] for about six months and we'll take a
[59:42] vote and see how you know if you think
[59:45] you can put up with me and vice versa. I
[59:48] might not want to put up with you after
[59:49] six months. So we had a little six
[59:51] months trial and it was about 99%. you
[59:54] got to have some opposition.
[59:57] But it was about 99% that I should stay
[59:59] and pastor. And so, but I didn't really
[1:00:03] have a residence. And I was living in
[1:00:05] the church. Amen. A little church that
[1:00:07] they had bought in 1966.
[1:00:10] Uh, Brother Brandham had told Brother
[1:00:12] Arnett, uh, find a building and follow
[1:00:15] the leadership of the Lord. Brother
[1:00:16] Brandham had, Brother Arnett had asked
[1:00:18] Brother Brandham, should we start a
[1:00:19] church in Colombia? And so that's what
[1:00:22] they did. And I'm living in the back of
[1:00:24] this church. And uh while I was there, I
[1:00:28] had got 300 seed tapes from brother
[1:00:31] Perry Green. He was uh promoting the old
[1:00:34] real toss in those days, making them
[1:00:36] more available and so forth. And that
[1:00:38] was in our tape library at the church.
[1:00:41] And um
[1:00:43] that was that was my spiritual meet at
[1:00:46] due season. And uh then a good old
[1:00:50] fisherman uh there that he and I fished
[1:00:53] a lot together. Brother Kushman
[1:00:56] uh he was a real message believer also.
[1:00:59] Uh he I think he and brother Kelly had
[1:01:01] been to some of the meetings when
[1:01:02] brother Brandham had come to Colombia
[1:01:04] and so forth. In fact, brother Kelly
[1:01:07] told me he said I was sitting behind
[1:01:08] brother Brandham and I said in my heart,
[1:01:10] "Well, Lord, I would just like to shake
[1:01:12] the man's hand." you know he and brother
[1:01:16] Brennham turned his head away from the
[1:01:18] audience, reached back and shook his
[1:01:19] hand just soon as he thought that. He
[1:01:21] said, "God bless you, brother." Went
[1:01:23] back to preaching.
[1:01:26] But yeah, those were my fishing buddies.
[1:01:28] And uh but brother Kushman drowned. Uh I
[1:01:32] don't know if he had a heart attack
[1:01:33] while he's out fishing or whatever, but
[1:01:35] and his wife really wasn't didn't seem
[1:01:38] to be that um interested in the message.
[1:01:41] So she gave me all of his tapes. Now
[1:01:43] I've got 390 tapes. All reals to real.
[1:01:46] Well, I'm listening to one of these new
[1:01:48] tapes and um got to back up a little bit
[1:01:52] because and I'm trying to weave this
[1:01:54] into my message uh when I um was um
[1:01:59] before I was draft actually yeah before
[1:02:01] I was drafted into the army. This would
[1:02:04] have been in 1964
[1:02:06] here. I'm 17 years old and I'm um the
[1:02:10] pastor's daughter was very beautiful.
[1:02:13] and she looked like an angel. She sung
[1:02:14] like an angel.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; She's only 16 years old, of course, but
[1:02:19] u I was infatuated with the pastor's
[1:02:22] daughter. We didn't get engaged, but we
[1:02:25] talked about marriage.
[1:02:27] And I mean, she could sing like an
[1:02:29] angel, come to the altar, speak in
[1:02:30] tongues like a an angel. I thought
[1:02:32] surely you know this is what I'm you
[1:02:34] know but I I I then as it come in I knew
[1:02:40] I was up for the draft and I knew if I
[1:02:42] got married I'd have to leave her
[1:02:44] perhaps you know and I sought the Lord
[1:02:46] about that and the Lord gave me a
[1:02:49] scripture over in Deuteronomy I believe
[1:02:51] it is now I don't remember the exact
[1:02:53] location of that scripture but you can
[1:02:55] do a little Bible search and under the
[1:02:58] law in Israel
[1:03:00] um it was forbidden to draft a man into
[1:03:02] the army that had just got married
[1:03:04] because he had to have two years at
[1:03:06] least to stay home with his wife and
[1:03:08] make a bond, you know, of that marriage.
[1:03:10] But they couldn't take him into into
[1:03:12] battle if he had just got married.
[1:03:13] That's uh was a law. The Lord gave me
[1:03:16] that scripture. I knew that law didn't
[1:03:17] exist in the United States. So I said by
[1:03:20] that, "Well, it's not the perfect will
[1:03:22] of the Lord for me to get married, at
[1:03:23] least at this time." Okay? But I did
[1:03:27] consider it. Okay? Then I was drafted.
[1:03:30] And to make a long story a little
[1:03:31] shorter,
[1:03:34] by the time I got out of the army back
[1:03:37] from Germany,
[1:03:39] my little dove had flew the coupe.
[1:03:44] She had uh
[1:03:46] was as her own mother told me,
[1:03:50] it was a forced marriage. Of course, now
[1:03:52] when I got out of the army, uh, they was
[1:03:57] making her available for me, but I knew
[1:04:00] that was not God's program. She had
[1:04:01] already gotten married. It was a forced
[1:04:03] marriage because she'd become expecting
[1:04:05] before the marriage. They had to get
[1:04:08] married to kind of cover up, I guess,
[1:04:10] the reproach and so forth. But you don't
[1:04:13] want to ever get involved in something
[1:04:14] like that, children.
[1:04:17] And then by the time I got out, she was
[1:04:20] already divorced, backslided, wearing
[1:04:22] pants, whatever, had a little child and
[1:04:27] of course was very available and even
[1:04:30] her. But when I learned that now, now
[1:04:35] listen, you can have an infatuation, you
[1:04:37] can have a feeling, that don't mean it's
[1:04:39] of God. You better check your Bible. You
[1:04:41] better check the message. Amen. You
[1:04:44] don't go by by infatuations, emotions,
[1:04:48] you know, sensations.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; You better take it to the word.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And so I knew that was not God's program
[1:04:57] for me. And when I seen how close I
[1:04:59] come, brother Israel,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; to making the wrong choice.
[1:05:04] Yeah. How close I came to making the
[1:05:07] wrong choice.
[1:05:09] Now remember, if a good wife is the best
[1:05:12] thing God can give a man outside of
[1:05:14] salvation, then you need a revelation.
[1:05:18] If salvation is a revelation, you need
[1:05:19] an understanding and and the leadership
[1:05:21] of the Holy Spirit.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; We need to pray about these things. We
[1:05:24] need to be sure where we stand.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. But I had made a vow
[1:05:30] now in 1967, I believe is when I made
[1:05:33] this vow. And I said, "Lord, I'm not
[1:05:34] getting married unless or until you
[1:05:39] speak to me in an audible voice." This
[1:05:41] was before I come to the message.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Okay? I knew God had a voice.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, unless you speak to
[1:05:51] me in an audible voice, showing me that
[1:05:53] that's the girl that I'm supposed to
[1:05:55] marry, I'm just not going to get
[1:05:56] married." I mean, I was because, hey,
[1:06:00] this little girl, I would stay awake of
[1:06:01] the night thinking about her.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:06:05] it was something there. I had I thought
[1:06:07] I had her in my heart, you know, and
[1:06:08] then I'm so disappointed. I'm so so I
[1:06:11] vowed God almighty. And I know the
[1:06:14] importance of a vow. You don't It's
[1:06:16] better to never make a vow than to make
[1:06:18] a vow a vow and break a vow.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Well, then from 67
[1:06:28] forward. I didn't get married till 75.
[1:06:34] September 7th of last year, 2025.
[1:06:38] Just a couple of months ago, my wife and
[1:06:41] I had our 50th anniversary.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you real quickly
[1:06:45] how it happened.
[1:06:47] Uh
[1:06:48] the I'd heard brother Brennham say on t
[1:06:52] on on one of those tapes that I had, I
[1:06:54] am God's voice to you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Now I'd always wondered, in fact, I had
[1:06:58] hoped, brother Minnow, that I I I wish I
[1:07:02] hadn't made the vow. There was times I
[1:07:03] wished I hadn't made that vow, but the
[1:07:05] vow kept you kept me. As I kept the vow,
[1:07:08] it kept me kept me out of a lot of
[1:07:09] trouble. Okay? And because there back in
[1:07:13] those days, believe it or not, I thought
[1:07:14] I was handsome. They thought I was too.
[1:07:20] But nonetheless, the vow kept me. Okay.
[1:07:25] And uh I by the grace of the Lord, I
[1:07:28] kept the vow.
[1:07:31] Oh, but then I was in Jeffersonville in
[1:07:36] 63.
[1:07:37] 63. No, not 63. Let's see. Wait a
[1:07:40] minute. I said 60. No, it'd be about uh
[1:07:44] three years before it would be 73
[1:07:47] because I didn't get married till 75,
[1:07:50] 1975. So in about 1973, I believe uh is
[1:07:54] when I I was introduced to this young
[1:07:57] lady in during one of the services
[1:08:01] brother Billy Paul would have uh in
[1:08:03] those days with brother Collins. I think
[1:08:05] was is right after I believe it was
[1:08:07] after brother Neville had passed on. I
[1:08:10] did get to meet brother Neville, but
[1:08:13] didn't get to fellowship with him
[1:08:14] personally. Uh I've been in brother
[1:08:17] Collins home. Uh he was the longest
[1:08:19] serving pastor, you know, about over 30
[1:08:21] years there at the pastor at the Brandon
[1:08:24] Tabernacle. Been in his home several
[1:08:26] times. But um there uh
[1:08:31] I had um
[1:08:37] I'd made this vow
[1:08:39] and listening to the tapes then I heard
[1:08:42] brother Brandham say I am God's voice to
[1:08:45] you.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; But I'd met this young lady
[1:08:50] and um then her daddy was a minister and
[1:08:54] they had services in their home. I'd
[1:08:56] been in their home and ministered also.
[1:08:58] And I knew there was something special
[1:09:00] about this girl, but I didn't dare, you
[1:09:03] know, I I I still very, you know, I
[1:09:05] remembered my vow. And so then u I
[1:09:09] believe it I'd known her for two or
[1:09:11] three years and we conversed a little
[1:09:13] bit um and but really didn't didn't get
[1:09:18] close and so forth. But then uh I
[1:09:24] invited her father down to minister for
[1:09:26] us and the she happened to come along
[1:09:29] with her mother and so forth. And u so I
[1:09:33] had the opportunity then to tell her
[1:09:34] about my vow.
[1:09:36] I said now uh this is what I vowed to
[1:09:40] the Lord and kind of what happened
[1:09:41] there. And I said, "But now if
[1:09:44] if the Lord should show me that you was
[1:09:48] the one, you know, big if there would
[1:09:51] would you marry me?"
[1:09:54] Oh, I was expecting her to. Well, of
[1:09:57] course, of course. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:09:59] She didn't do that.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; She said, "Well,
[1:10:03] probably." I said, "Probably."
[1:10:08] She said, "Well, I you if it's the
[1:10:11] Lord's will." Yes, if it's the Lord's
[1:10:13] will. I said, "Well, you wouldn't want
[1:10:14] it and I wouldn't want it either if it
[1:10:16] wasn't the Lord's will."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. But I just wanted to share my vow
[1:10:20] with you there and show you to
[1:10:21] understand maybe why I wasn't, you know,
[1:10:23] communicating anymore or whatever. All
[1:10:25] right. So, she went back to Michigan
[1:10:28] with her parents and I said, "Be pray.
[1:10:32] Pray." Okay. So during that time, I'm
[1:10:35] living in the back of the church and I'd
[1:10:36] got these extra uh 90 tapes and I'm
[1:10:39] listening to the tapes. We're doing a
[1:10:40] little outreach down in Charleston and
[1:10:42] so forth area um on Tuesday nights, you
[1:10:46] know, three services, four services a
[1:10:48] week was having them. And you know, the
[1:10:51] Bible says so much the more as we see
[1:10:53] that day approach. And so, but anyway,
[1:10:56] uh I was searching one of the tapes to
[1:10:59] get some inspiration to minister the
[1:11:01] next night down in Charleston, I believe
[1:11:03] it was, uh on the coast. And uh so I get
[1:11:07] this new tape. I never heard it before.
[1:11:10] Secret sudden going away at the church
[1:11:13] and I already knew, brother Brennham
[1:11:14] said, "Now I am God's voice to you." He
[1:11:16] said, "Now I I felt somebody resent
[1:11:18] that,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; but I when the angel of the Lord moves
[1:11:21] down, I am God's voice to you." He said,
[1:11:23] "That was him." said it that time.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; All right. So, this was in the back of
[1:11:28] my mind, but I didn't know, you know, I
[1:11:31] I it stood out to me. But, uh, here I am
[1:11:35] now listening to the, uh, well, I've got
[1:11:37] to weave this in real quick. My u
[1:11:43] sister Cheryl is my wife's name. And we
[1:11:45] had wrote one or two letters. And in
[1:11:47] this after after the uh after me telling
[1:11:51] her about the vow, she writes this big
[1:11:53] long letter, four or five pages, and she
[1:11:55] says, "I'm sorry. God will never show
[1:11:57] you anything about me. I'm unworthy to
[1:12:00] be your wife."
[1:12:03] That was a real let down. I thought,
[1:12:06] "Well, she knows I'm a a minister. She
[1:12:09] knows a minister supposed to marry a
[1:12:11] virgin. She knows the message."
[1:12:15] I thought, "Well, maybe maybe she's not
[1:12:17] a virgin. Maybe this, maybe that." And
[1:12:20] so, I get on the old crank up telephone,
[1:12:22] you know, called her up and and uh I
[1:12:26] didn't know how to cross-examine her
[1:12:28] exactly, but oh no, Brother Hughes, I've
[1:12:30] never known another man, nothing like
[1:12:32] that. But God's just he'll never show
[1:12:34] you anything about me, you know, and uh
[1:12:38] I'm just unworthy. Okay. Well, I that
[1:12:42] was the
[1:12:44] all the way through that telephone
[1:12:45] conversation, it concluded like that.
[1:12:47] I'm unworthy.
[1:12:49] After getting a letter, saying she's
[1:12:51] unworthy, I called her up and then at
[1:12:53] the conclusion of that, I'm unworthy.
[1:12:55] Okay. So, now I'm listening to this
[1:12:57] message. I'm up in the middle of the bed
[1:12:59] with my legs crossed and um have this
[1:13:02] Sony realtore and I just got it a new
[1:13:05] tape. I used to have an old Wallen sack
[1:13:07] and I and about worry it out. I got a
[1:13:10] new uh Sony from brother Perry Green and
[1:13:13] u uh so I'm listening to this old
[1:13:17] realtore tape and brother Brandham is
[1:13:19] telling about the armor meat packing boy
[1:13:22] that went west to look for a wife
[1:13:26] and he tells it different on different
[1:13:27] tapes you know a little bit different uh
[1:13:30] so forth and uh but on this particular
[1:13:32] tape he he he knew that that wasn't the
[1:13:35] kind of wives that he wanted them shoot
[1:13:37] them up you
[1:13:38] dancers and so forth. And so he went out
[1:13:41] and sit on the corral in disappointed
[1:13:44] uh you know I think it was from Chicago
[1:13:47] area. But anyway uh he sees this little
[1:13:51] uh the little was it a nephew or niece
[1:13:54] or something little orphan girl throwing
[1:13:55] out the dishwater
[1:13:58] and he said now that's the kind of wife
[1:14:00] I'd want somebody to go stay in the
[1:14:02] kitchen
[1:14:04] stay in the home. By the way, did you
[1:14:07] know what brother Brennham said? When
[1:14:09] you take the woman out of the kitchen,
[1:14:10] you take her out of the will of the
[1:14:12] Lord.
[1:14:15] He said it.
[1:14:17] Don't put them out here on the on the
[1:14:19] motorcycles trying to be a police lady.
[1:14:21] Okay? Keep them in their place.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he wasn't legalistic and you
[1:14:26] and I'm not trying to in insert
[1:14:29] something new or different. You
[1:14:30] understand? But we need This is what he
[1:14:32] was looking for. He's looking for a
[1:14:33] housekeeper. He's looking for a wife.
[1:14:35] looking for a mother for his children.
[1:14:37] Amen. Somebody to help build a home. He
[1:14:38] didn't want these dancers and flurers
[1:14:40] and so forth. And so he asked her, you
[1:14:43] know, do you know why I'm here? He got
[1:14:45] out there, you know, and stood between
[1:14:46] her and the house whenever she was
[1:14:48] throwing out the dishwater. She was
[1:14:49] embarrassed, barefooted perhaps, and so
[1:14:51] forth. And he said, would you you know
[1:14:55] why I'm here? She said, "No." She said,
[1:14:57] "I'm looking for a wife." I'm
[1:14:59] paraphrasing now. You can go listen to
[1:15:01] the tape. I think it's secret sudden
[1:15:02] going away the church. Something like
[1:15:04] that. And uh so he said uh uh
[1:15:09] uh would you marry marry me? She said,
[1:15:12] "Oh, I I'm unworthy. I'm unworthy."
[1:15:18] I stopped the tape.
[1:15:24] It was one of those twist knobs. I put
[1:15:26] it on rewind.
[1:15:29] I played that part again. She said the
[1:15:32] same thing. I'm unworthy.
[1:15:35] And I thought,
[1:15:39] you know, people hear what they want to
[1:15:41] hear on tape
[1:15:46] and they people hear what they they they
[1:15:48] they read what they want to read out of
[1:15:50] the Bible, too. See what they want to
[1:15:52] see. Now, I don't during this two or
[1:15:55] three weeks after telling her and we'd
[1:15:57] start praying, I had some dreams. I I
[1:15:59] seen her name in the Bible and my name
[1:16:00] in the Bible, and that's all. But that
[1:16:02] wasn't my vow.
[1:16:04] See, that was the only thing that was in
[1:16:05] this particular Bible that I seen in my
[1:16:08] dream was her first name and my first
[1:16:09] name. Cheryl and Gerald, big deep
[1:16:12] letters,
[1:16:14] like in the Old and New Testament.
[1:16:15] That's the only two names in the book.
[1:16:18] I could have said, "Oh, this is Oh,
[1:16:20] praise the Lord." You know, this is God
[1:16:22] speaking to me. But that wasn't my vow.
[1:16:25] the vow that I made. Lord, you'll have
[1:16:28] to speak to me in an audible voice and
[1:16:31] I'll have to know that it's you and
[1:16:32] you'll have to tell me that's a girl.
[1:16:36] And so I I rewound the tape two or three
[1:16:39] times. You know what it said the third
[1:16:41] time that I played it?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly the same thing. The tapes always
[1:16:48] say the same thing. You can't make them
[1:16:50] say anything different. But I I Lord,
[1:16:53] are you talking to me? Could you be
[1:16:55] speaking to me? I cut off the tape right
[1:16:58] there. I went in out of the little
[1:17:00] bedroom area into the auditorium of the
[1:17:02] church like through the room here and
[1:17:04] just the light shining uh the main I
[1:17:07] didn't turn the main lights on, just let
[1:17:08] it shine through the door. I started
[1:17:09] praying. Lord, I know that people hear
[1:17:12] what they want to hear,
[1:17:16] but is it possible
[1:17:18] that you could be speaking to me through
[1:17:20] this tape,
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; through this?
[1:17:25] Well, I didn't tell anybody. And so, but
[1:17:28] I had I had some assurance there while I
[1:17:30] was in prayer that that was the that was
[1:17:34] the Lord.
[1:17:36] Well, it just so happened the next day
[1:17:37] or so they was having a a meeting in in
[1:17:41] Hardy, Arkansas. I think his brother
[1:17:43] Earl Martin's church, you've heard
[1:17:45] brother me speak of him. And u my
[1:17:47] parents uh my future father-in-law and
[1:17:50] mother-in-law didn't come, but my future
[1:17:52] wife to be was there with her
[1:17:55] brother-in-law and and sister. And so I
[1:17:58] I learned that and I I I got my little
[1:18:00] old I had a little old Jeep Commander U
[1:18:03] convertible hard top. I jumped in that
[1:18:05] little six-cylinder Jeep and I headed
[1:18:07] for Arkansas and u I got permission to
[1:18:10] take her home that night and I we found
[1:18:14] a place to park and I told her just what
[1:18:16] had happened and we talked about my
[1:18:19] background, she talked about her
[1:18:21] background and that night we if it's
[1:18:25] okay with daddy now
[1:18:28] uh I said and then she said, "Oh yes,
[1:18:33] yes, I will." That's the Lord. It's the
[1:18:35] Lord. And I said, "But we got to call
[1:18:38] your daddy." We got him out of bed. His
[1:18:41] name was Charles. How many heard the
[1:18:44] last story how Brother Bannon got
[1:18:45] married?
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; And uh his I think that was with Hope,
[1:18:49] the first one, his father-in-law's name
[1:18:51] was Charles.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Well, my father-in-law's name was is
[1:18:54] Charles was Charles. He's passed on now.
[1:18:57] Uh Brother Charles Ray Davis, a great
[1:19:00] minister of the gospel in this message.
[1:19:03] And uh but he he was already a bit
[1:19:05] asleep and I I got him up on the phone
[1:19:08] and uh and uh
[1:19:11] uh he answered the phone and I said,
[1:19:13] "Would you come out on the porch and
[1:19:15] talk to me a little bit?" He didn't
[1:19:16] catch it, you know. So I finally had to
[1:19:19] ask him um I I the reason I'm calling,
[1:19:23] could I marry your daughter?
[1:19:27] And um why son? He said, "I can't think
[1:19:30] of another man that I'd rather have as a
[1:19:32] son-in-law than you."
[1:19:35] And he said, "In fact, the Lord showed
[1:19:36] me that you was going to be my
[1:19:38] son-in-law."
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; So, a father is very responsible. Young
[1:19:43] man, don't bypass the daddy of the girl
[1:19:45] you're courting. Okay?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Respect. Amen. Don't just go and honk
[1:19:50] the horn.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You show respect. Okay? But here I
[1:19:55] want I want to kind of leave that real
[1:19:58] shortly there. I will say this that uh
[1:20:01] she's been a real jewel and um she has
[1:20:05] bore born nine children. We had three uh
[1:20:11] sons and six daughters and by the grace
[1:20:15] of the Lord they're all serving the Lord
[1:20:18] except at right now except my youngest
[1:20:21] daughter. I want you to remember her in
[1:20:22] prayer. Shakina Joy Melvin and she lives
[1:20:26] down in Destin Florida and they've been
[1:20:28] out of church for some time. So please
[1:20:30] remember them in prayer. But all of our
[1:20:33] children and grandchildren are serving
[1:20:35] the Lord in the light of this message to
[1:20:37] the best of their understanding. I don't
[1:20:38] have a doctrine that you have to come to
[1:20:40] my church to be saved. I didn't require
[1:20:43] that of the son-in-laws that were asking
[1:20:45] for my daughters, you know, and uh so
[1:20:49] but I u we had let's see two years ago
[1:20:54] in November, not November of 25, but
[1:20:57] November of 24, we had a a kind of a
[1:21:01] family reunion and um I was really
[1:21:04] blessed to realize that we hadn't had a
[1:21:07] single death in our family for all these
[1:21:10] 50 years. 50 years. And um with with the
[1:21:15] son-in-laws and the daughter-in-laws and
[1:21:18] the grandchildren, there's 45 of us. We
[1:21:21] have 26 or 27 grandchildren now, I
[1:21:24] think. And then the uh son-in-laws and
[1:21:27] daughter-in-laws, everybody there. Uh we
[1:21:30] had a total of about 45 in the in the
[1:21:32] Hughes tribe. And so I am so thankful. I
[1:21:36] don't get to testify to that very much.
[1:21:38] But I want to come back to my message
[1:21:40] and wrap it up here now. Um because I
[1:21:43] know this phone is going to keep its
[1:21:46] tone here. Um
[1:21:49] you help me please because this thing
[1:21:52] don't look like it. What I did this
[1:21:53] evening, the reason I was about a couple
[1:21:55] minutes late at the church, I set the
[1:21:57] alarm and I must have put PM instead of
[1:22:00] or AM instead of PM because it never did
[1:22:02] go off and I was a couple minutes late.
[1:22:04] So anyway, how many will give me five
[1:22:06] more minutes?
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30. Oh, I can preach
[1:22:11] a long time.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; No, no, not really. We've got a brother
[1:22:15] down in South Carolina. He's a little
[1:22:17] African-American brother. And um he'll
[1:22:20] preach about five or 10 minutes and
[1:22:22] he'll say, "I'm closing."
[1:22:24] He preach about an hour later, he say,
[1:22:26] "I'm closing." Preach another hour. I'm
[1:22:28] closing. They said, "Why do you keep
[1:22:30] saying I'm closing?" He said, 'Well, I
[1:22:33] don't like to preach to people that's
[1:22:35] asleep. Every time I say I'm closing,
[1:22:36] everybody wakes up.
[1:22:40] I want to wrap this up, bring it to a
[1:22:42] little point here. U
[1:22:47] you know,
[1:22:49] marriage is sacred. Marriage, the
[1:22:53] prophet said, belongs in the church.
[1:22:56] And um
[1:23:01] I
[1:23:02] in Revelation chapter
[1:23:05] well look at this. Okay let's look at
[1:23:07] this. Can is it okay if we just play
[1:23:09] this little portion of this little clip?
[1:23:11] Okay let's God's servant and prophet
[1:23:14] brother Brandham. Let's just play this
[1:23:15] little clip right here.
[1:23:20] Wish we had time now. I got March here.
[1:23:22] Solomon courting this girl,
[1:23:26] the bride. Oh, we just have to admit
[1:23:28] it's getting too late. I'll get it
[1:23:31] again.
[1:23:32] When he tries to get her, but she's
[1:23:34] engaged to a shepherd boy. Some Paul
[1:23:36] thought that was a song he sang. Oh, no.
[1:23:40] Solomon was a throne uh inherit of
[1:23:45] David. Yeah.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; On earth, but showed that kingdom had to
[1:23:48] pass away. was a type of Christ
[1:23:51] in love with the bride. See, notice that
[1:23:54] Jesus said John 14, now go and prepare a
[1:23:57] place. Oh, what will it look like? Did
[1:24:02] you ever think now, bride, what it will
[1:24:04] look like?
[1:24:06] It is prepared and designed by the
[1:24:09] divine architect.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; What will that city look like? Now,
[1:24:13] we're going to talk about it for a few
[1:24:14] minutes.
[1:24:15] The divine architect has prepared it.
[1:24:19] Designed it.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; And look, he's designed it with tender
[1:24:23] hands for his beloved bride.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a man marrying a wife
[1:24:30] that's able? How he builds and puts
[1:24:32] every little thing just exactly to her
[1:24:33] touch? Just what she'd like.
[1:24:37] Amen. Now the divine architect
[1:24:41] has designed the new city where he will
[1:24:44] live with his bride just to her touch.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; No wonder the apostle said eye has not
[1:24:51] seen the ear is not heard but neither
[1:24:52] has ever entered the heart of man.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can probe into it just
[1:24:57] for a moment.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; See what it's going to look like.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; brother. Thank you. I just now I did you
[1:25:05] catch that? See, it's a type of Christ
[1:25:10] and the bride.
[1:25:13] Now, when when when you read the Song of
[1:25:15] Solomon,
[1:25:17] be sure that you're thinking of Christ.
[1:25:19] See, you need a pure heart to read the
[1:25:21] Song of Solomon. You need cleansed mind
[1:25:24] to read the Song of Solomon properly.
[1:25:27] And so uh here now I I want to uh just
[1:25:33] see if we can bring in something here
[1:25:37] and uh I'd like to endeavor to speak
[1:25:39] just by inspiration for a few minutes.
[1:25:42] Um,
[1:25:44] I want you to notice and brothers if you
[1:25:49] will just bring these quotes up as I
[1:25:50] refer to them and uh we'll try to
[1:25:53] condense because what I'd like to leave
[1:25:56] with you tonight is how that uh in 19
[1:26:02] 6
[1:26:06] or was it 63 that he preached seed is
[1:26:10] not not seed is not air with spoken word
[1:26:12] is original seed. In that message,
[1:26:15] spoken word is original seed. He read
[1:26:18] what the Holy Spirit told him to write.
[1:26:21] Take up your pen and write. And in
[1:26:24] reading that and weaving it in on the
[1:26:26] tape, he said, "Here's the secret of
[1:26:28] this.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; The word is in the bride."
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now, that's on tape.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; The word. Now, remember, the word is the
[1:26:38] original seed, the spoken word.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? Not just the written word, but the
[1:26:42] spoken word. It's got to be spoken. All
[1:26:43] right. Now, then when the church age
[1:26:46] book came out in 1965,
[1:26:49] he had already preached the seals. And
[1:26:52] interwoven into the church age book is
[1:26:54] the revelation of the seals, even though
[1:26:56] he's just dealing with the church ages,
[1:26:58] chapters 1, two, and three of
[1:27:00] Revelation. But now in there, he adds a
[1:27:04] little word to it. Check your B. Check
[1:27:06] your check your uh Now, he's not adding
[1:27:09] to the word. But it's a further
[1:27:11] information, a little deeper
[1:27:13] understanding. Okay. So now when the
[1:27:16] when he pre when he writes a church age
[1:27:18] book, he records that same thing again.
[1:27:20] Take a pen and write where. Okay. And in
[1:27:23] there he said the word is in the bride
[1:27:27] as it was in Mary.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And that's in parenthesis. Okay. As it
[1:27:33] was in Mary. Okay. My question, how did
[1:27:37] it get in Mary?
[1:27:40] The angel Gabriel brought it to her.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; How did the word get in the bride,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; the angel of Revelation 10:7,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; spoken word?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Vindicated
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; puts the word. See, and he said the word
[1:27:56] is in there. Okay. But now here's my
[1:27:58] thought tonight.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; And I, you know, he will not marry an
[1:28:04] immature bride.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; We have a little sister. What shall we
[1:28:08] do for her in the day that she spoke?
[1:28:10] This is the day. Okay.
[1:28:18] We must mature spiritually and we must m
[1:28:22] ripen in the presence of the Lord
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; to come to this invisible union.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I I I've got these quotes and I
[1:28:30] won't take time to read them tonight. I
[1:28:32] won't have time and we've got some
[1:28:34] different scriptures. I won't take time
[1:28:35] to do that. But if you'd like to get the
[1:28:37] quotes, I've given them to brother
[1:28:39] Nathan. And here I'm just going to refer
[1:28:41] to some of them. Okay. Now, in the
[1:28:44] message proving his word, listen to
[1:28:47] this. I just caught this
[1:28:49] a year or so back, the depth of it, the
[1:28:52] sincerity of it in the message proving
[1:28:54] his word 604.
[1:28:57] Uh, and he preached that twice. So, be
[1:28:59] sure you listen to the right one. But
[1:29:01] there brother Brandham said the union
[1:29:03] see comes right through this when the
[1:29:07] son of man comes down and is manifested
[1:29:10] in flesh. Okay. And that unites the the
[1:29:14] the bride and and Christ together the
[1:29:17] church. And he said we go to the there
[1:29:22] he said we go to the wedding supper not
[1:29:24] the marriage.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; He's making a distinction. go to we go
[1:29:30] to the weddings. She's already united
[1:29:32] here.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; All right. This this ties in perfectly
[1:29:36] with the message entitled the invisible
[1:29:38] union.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; The invisible union of Christ, you know,
[1:29:42] and his bride.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. So then, like I said, my own
[1:29:49] little testimony there is is is
[1:29:51] relevant. If the if the lady
[1:29:56] is pregnant before the marriage,
[1:29:59] something's bad wrong. Something's way
[1:30:00] out of order.
[1:30:02] Somebody got too close. Okay. But God is
[1:30:05] a God of order.
[1:30:08] Fear not to take unto thee marry thy
[1:30:10] wife. He told Joseph. So the engagement
[1:30:14] is is the marriage in God's eyes. But
[1:30:16] that doesn't give you right to that
[1:30:18] young lady or vice versa.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. you you should never even kiss
[1:30:23] until the veil is lifted in the marriage
[1:30:25] uh at the marriage ceremony. Is that
[1:30:26] right? Is that what the prophet taught
[1:30:28] us? And forsaking all others will thou
[1:30:30] cleave only to this man. And forsaking
[1:30:33] all others, will you cleave only to this
[1:30:35] woman?
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That does away with your polygamy
[1:30:38] and all that stuff, you know, in the
[1:30:41] wrong way. But now watch
[1:30:44] here. He he says
[1:30:48] the
[1:30:50] the when that lifegiving flow comes in,
[1:30:54] the womb is sealed.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we're speaking spiritually. The
[1:30:58] womb of your heart, the womb of your
[1:31:00] mind, the womb of your soul is sealed.
[1:31:04] She can't commit adultery.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; So, the invisible union has to take
[1:31:09] place here.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual union. And brother
[1:31:14] Brandham calls it a marriage. Do your
[1:31:16] word search. She's already married to
[1:31:18] the virtuous son of God. He said, "Never
[1:31:20] sinned in the first place."
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. He will not marry a fallen woman.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; God see gave Adam a bride. But before he
[1:31:33] could marry her, she had fallen. He gave
[1:31:36] Christ a bride on the day of Pentecost.
[1:31:38] And brother Brandham in this church age
[1:31:40] book there he says and before he could
[1:31:42] marry her she also had fallen
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; this day. See God saved the best of
[1:31:49] last.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; This is a greater day than that was. It
[1:31:53] was not ordained in the program of God
[1:31:56] for a marriage to take place between
[1:31:57] Christ and his bride 2,000 years ago. In
[1:32:00] the great plan of redemption, God
[1:32:02] reserved it for this day. And this
[1:32:05] message coming forth creates a bride.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom himself creating his own
[1:32:11] bride.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. We've got to come and realize
[1:32:16] that we're already Hey, listen. The the
[1:32:20] what was in the womb of Mary? Isaiah
[1:32:22] 9:6.
[1:32:24] A son is given, a child is born. His
[1:32:26] name shall be called counselor, prince
[1:32:28] of peace, mighty God, everlasting
[1:32:30] father, etc. All right. That's what's in
[1:32:33] you. That's what's in the true bride
[1:32:35] today.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; But listen, here's what I'm going to say
[1:32:41] now in closing. We can't leave it in the
[1:32:44] womb.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; The word that was way back in six, that
[1:32:49] was 60 years ago when brother Benham
[1:32:52] said it's in the bride as it was in
[1:32:56] Mary.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; But see it, we can't leave it there.
[1:33:00] We've got to It's no It's no longer
[1:33:02] Christ. Amen. In the uh in the in in the
[1:33:07] cradle.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; It's no longer It can't be Christ
[1:33:13] in, you know, somewhere else.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It's Christ in you.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's Christ in you.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And and we must come to this fullness of
[1:33:24] the stature of a perfect man.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; To the perfect man. And he who now letth
[1:33:30] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:33:32] way.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; He,
[1:33:35] she, and he becomes one
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; by feeding on this glorious message.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody devalue the the
[1:33:45] message to you. Brother Po, come up
[1:33:47] before I get rounded up here and I can't
[1:33:50] stop. Let's stand together.
[1:33:54] just it ended up being a testimony
[1:33:56] instead of a sermon, but I trust that
[1:33:59] something was said to encourage you
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; and I just wanted to share the
[1:34:03] importance of hearing the the message
[1:34:06] for yourself.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Feed on this message. Amen. It's
[1:34:11] spiritual meeting in due season. Amen.
[1:34:14] Let's bow our heads just a moment maybe
[1:34:15] as they play real softly. Amen. That
[1:34:18] little Where is John? uh our song leader
[1:34:23] uh yeah come my dear brother if you will
[1:34:26] brother Noah
[1:34:28] and uh
[1:34:31] let's just bow our heads for a moment
[1:34:34] heavenly father we do know one thing
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; that
[1:34:41] we
[1:34:43] the testimony of Jesus Christ is a
[1:34:46] spirit of prophecy
[1:34:48] and Lord if We can just tell how our
[1:34:50] candle got lit. Sometimes it means more
[1:34:53] than all of our theology.
[1:34:57] Our experiences, Lord, if they come from
[1:34:59] you, they were ordained from before the
[1:35:01] foundation of the world.
[1:35:05] And Lord, we know that your word can
[1:35:07] never return void.
[1:35:10] in my own mixed up way. Lord, I pray
[1:35:12] you'll take this little testimony
[1:35:14] tonight. These few scriptures we've
[1:35:15] referred to, these few quotes that we've
[1:35:17] referred to.
[1:35:21] And Lord, I pray that you would just
[1:35:23] embed them deep into our hearts and
[1:35:25] cause us to be more sincere, more
[1:35:27] hungry, have a greater capacity to hear
[1:35:29] the word of God, seeking revelation in a
[1:35:33] a more simple way than ever before.
[1:35:37] remembering how your servant and prophet
[1:35:38] said the need for divine revelation by
[1:35:42] the spirit can never be overemphasized.
[1:35:46] And Lord, we know revelation is
[1:35:47] sovereignly given. It doesn't come
[1:35:49] through the preacher. It comes through
[1:35:51] God.
[1:35:52] And Lord, we know you use the preacher,
[1:35:55] but yet Lord, it takes you. So may we
[1:35:58] seek you, seek your face. The first
[1:36:01] recorded words, how is it that you
[1:36:03] sought me? the first recorded words of
[1:36:06] the word when the word was made flesh.
[1:36:10] Knowest thou not that I must be about my
[1:36:12] father's business?
[1:36:14] Lord, let us seek you with all of our
[1:36:16] hearts. Love you.
[1:36:19] You're our
[1:36:22] eternal soulmate, Lord. You're you're
[1:36:24] our breath. You're our life. You're our
[1:36:26] sunshine. Let us love you more than our
[1:36:29] husband, more than our wife, more than
[1:36:32] anything, Lord. You come first, oh God.
[1:36:37] This is the name whereby she shall be
[1:36:39] called to the Lord our righteousness. We
[1:36:42] have none of our own. Lord, it's yours.
[1:36:45] Father, I pray that you'll minister to
[1:36:48] every need that is in our midst tonight.
[1:36:53] Now, with our heads bowed just a moment,
[1:36:56] I wonder if there might be somebody
[1:36:58] here,
[1:37:00] you'd say, "Brother Hughes,
[1:37:02] I I really
[1:37:06] realize that I I need a deeper walk with
[1:37:09] God. I need the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:11] Ghost."
[1:37:13] Lift your hand high. I want to pray for
[1:37:15] you.
[1:37:17] Heavenly Father, you see these hands,
[1:37:19] several hands, and you know their
[1:37:21] hearts.
[1:37:23] Lord, we just want to love you more. If
[1:37:27] we just fall in love with you,
[1:37:29] everything will work out just fine. As
[1:37:31] your servant prophet said, you have your
[1:37:34] day at Calvary and God will have his way
[1:37:36] with you. Lord, let us die to our own
[1:37:39] desires, our own motives, our own
[1:37:41] objectives, Lord, and let us be filled
[1:37:44] with your love and your spirit.
[1:37:47] Oh granted, heavenly father,
[1:37:50] give us a greater capacity
[1:37:53] to receive your word, the living word of
[1:37:56] God, grant it, dear God.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Minister to every need, physically,
[1:38:02] spiritually, financially, whatever the
[1:38:04] need might be. Lord, you said whatsoever
[1:38:07] thing you desire when you pray, believe
[1:38:09] you receive it and you shall have it.
[1:38:12] Grant it, Lord. Minister to every need
[1:38:14] now as we worship you into my chambers.
[1:38:28] And we can say praise the Lord. Amen. We
[1:38:31] thank God for the word tonight. I
[1:38:34] believe that was for every one of us
[1:38:36] here
[1:38:38] uh married or single
[1:38:40] that um we certainly thank the Lord for
[1:38:44] the word. Amen.
[1:38:47] You know, it's uh it's really special
[1:38:49] the way the Lord does things. He it's
[1:38:52] just a mystery how he minister to what
[1:38:55] we have need of. We might think this or
[1:38:58] that, but he he uses the foolishness of
[1:39:01] preaching to give us what we have need
[1:39:03] of. Amen. And we just receive that.
[1:39:06] Amen. I receive that tonight. Uh Sister
[1:39:09] Heather had a praise report. She wanted
[1:39:11] to thank the church for a prayer. Her
[1:39:14] knee is much better. So, we can just say
[1:39:16] praise the Lord for that. Amen.
[1:39:19] Amen. And there was a prayer request for
[1:39:21] um
[1:39:23] Desiree Desiree and her elderly mother
[1:39:28] and um we want to keep that in prayer.
[1:39:33] Also the brother Menow Fzen and them
[1:39:36] will be moving forward towards Phoenix
[1:39:38] and their trip. We certainly enjoyed
[1:39:40] having him uh with us. It's just been a
[1:39:43] real privilege, a real blessing to to
[1:39:46] have them. And I believe the Ding walls,
[1:39:48] I'm not sure what their schedule is
[1:39:50] like, but we just been really blessed to
[1:39:52] have them with us and we certainly
[1:39:54] appreciate them. And um we thank the
[1:39:57] Lord for them. Amen. So we'll keep them
[1:39:59] in prayer.
[1:40:01] And was there prayer requests we wanted
[1:40:03] to make known also spoken requests?
[1:40:06] Anyone?
[1:40:08] No. Yes. Angel
[1:40:13] Sophina
[1:40:16] Oh, Joseph, your mother. Yeah, that's
[1:40:19] Angel's mother, Josephina. They keep her
[1:40:21] in prayer. Someone else. Yes.
[1:40:28] Okay.
[1:40:30] Pretty serious. All right. With the
[1:40:31] blood clot, what's the gentleman's name?
[1:40:35] We don't know the name. All right.
[1:40:40] Okay. We'll pray for this person. Yes.
[1:40:47] Yes, he'll keep them in prayer.
[1:40:51] I don't know if you know the situation
[1:40:52] in Haiti is not really good. And so just
[1:40:57] I mean they don't even want to give them
[1:40:59] a bunch of clothes to take back home
[1:41:01] because the bandits and the people that
[1:41:04] are in charge are just taking anything.
[1:41:06] They took took his medication, took
[1:41:08] everything and they just it's really a
[1:41:12] dire situation for them. But we put them
[1:41:14] in God's hands and we'll continue to
[1:41:16] pray for them. Amen. Yes, brother.
[1:41:22] Yes. The saints in Mesa will keep them
[1:41:24] in prayer. Lord will bless them. Was
[1:41:27] there someone else also? Brother Hughes
[1:41:29] with his travels. He's a brother brother
[1:41:32] Hughes is a missionary. He travels quite
[1:41:34] a bit. And the first time I went really
[1:41:39] to East Africa and Tanzania was with
[1:41:41] brother Hughes and uh just a real and
[1:41:45] he's always going. You see all those
[1:41:47] passports. So we'll pray the Lord will
[1:41:49] strengthen him and bless him. How many
[1:41:51] enjoyed that
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; tonight? That was a blessing. Amen.
[1:42:00] So glad to be associated with these
[1:42:02] ministries. the Lord knows. And so we'll
[1:42:05] take some time to go to the Lord in
[1:42:08] prayer. Um you could pray right at your
[1:42:11] seat or come at the altar and pray.
[1:42:13] We'll just take some time just to ponder
[1:42:16] these things. I think Levi and I were
[1:42:18] talking about Song of Solomon. I think
[1:42:20] we had a little kids sometime where did
[1:42:22] brother Random mention that. I think
[1:42:23] that's the only place. So I was familiar
[1:42:25] with it.
[1:42:27] Um, it's nice how he brought that out
[1:42:29] with the bride and Christ and oh my God
[1:42:33] bless you each of you. So, as we prepare
[1:42:37] to go to the Lord in prayer, let's sing
[1:42:40] um well, we we'll just we won't sing.

[1:42:44] bless you. Amen.

[2:02:06] surgery went well.

[2:02:11] Sophia. She's resting and will be here
[2:02:13] for the next day or two at the hospital
[2:02:16] for observation and she'll need a week
[2:02:18] or two to recover to normal activities.
[2:02:22] Couple of months for full recovery.
[2:02:24] Thank you all for your prayers. This has
[2:02:27] been a very hard very hard on our family
[2:02:30] but I know all your prayers help through
[2:02:33] God is good that sister Raven's mother
[2:02:37] and the Valencia. I put that request in.

[2:04:04] I'll be true, Lord Jesus. I'll be true.
[2:04:12] There's a race.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; I got to run victories.
[2:04:19] Oh,
[2:04:21] power every hour to make that
[2:04:25] confession. I'll be true. I'll be true,
[2:04:29] Lord.
[2:04:33] In the test, I'll be true.
[2:04:38] Jesus, I'll be true.
[2:04:43] There's a race I must run. There are
[2:04:48] victories to be won. Give me power every
[2:04:54] hour to be true.

[2:05:00] which is power to be true. Amen.

[2:08:39] through a spoken word. And Lord, we
[2:08:42] thank you for the word of God that's
[2:08:44] been given to us in this age. And
[2:08:47] through all the tests and trials of this
[2:08:50] life and the things that we would suffer
[2:08:53] and go through, it's not worthy to be
[2:08:56] compared with the glory that will be
[2:08:58] revealed in us. how you've built a bride
[2:09:03] that will not fall, Lord. And Lord, you

[2:09:09] book of life before the foundation of
[2:09:11] the world. And no matter how dark it
[2:09:14] gets, no matter how corrupt this age
[2:09:18] would become, you have a people that
