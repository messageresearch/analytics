in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen we'll be listening to the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church age book we'll start at uh paragraph 95 and we'll end after 143 for those that are following those that may be streaming let's sing only believe only [Music] be only be all things possible only believe only [Music] only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brena and he'll attack the Book of Genesis upon it it's uh uh being authentic he'll say that it isn't authentic he'll stir the minds of people watch where the devil lays that book of Genesis or the Book of Revelations the first and the last and the Book of Revelations has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the Bible it has more symbols because it is a book of Prophecy it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class this book is not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand it hardly this book is made for a certain class of people hallelujah all over Deuteronomy says the hidden things belong to the Lord that is right and he reveals to us his children the hidden things so it doesn't go the carnal cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but to the ones who are lovers of the word of God that's who the book was written to to the church the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church at Ephesus to the Church of Samia to the church to the church it's all down the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church I like that I notice it also is the consummation of the scriptures the complete consummation and it's geographically placed at the right place at the end of the Bible the revelation of the whole thing placed back here with a blessing to who reads it and hears it with a curse to them that'll add to or take away it's the complete Cannon amen all the absolute nothing can be added to it amen and when a man tries to take anything away from it or add anything to it God said he'd take the same part out of The Book of Life see he would take his part from the book if he added to it therefore when we see the manifold revelation of Our Lord who he is what he is if any person shall add something to that or take anything away from it it's a false prophecy many US tried to say they had something later than that but that is a complete revelation of the Lord Jesus in his church age and in his days a revelation of Our Lord now now unveiling the Greek word something that's been hid un UNR uh revealing Christ now the next verse we find in the second verse the first verse is unveiling Christ the Revelation or the uncovering oh how the last age and the coming of the Lord was on was covered up to the apostles they asked the question but only one lived to have the Revelation still he didn't understand it because the history was not yet made now the history of this book or the the context of this book was directed to the seven churches in Asia Minor that van was it was directed to those seven churches there were more churches in those seven at that day but each one of those churches were sign significant about the characteristic in that church that would follow it down through the age the characteristic of that church like Ephesus it had a characteristic Samia pgus and on down Philadelphia each one of those churches had a characteristic in it that would appear again in the ages to come oh if you could only any man can see the the spiritual application of the scriptures and could say that they wasn't inspired Hallelujah your very actions the very motives the very objectives of the people why it proves that the scripture is inspired to see how God applies those things just once you do here is a type of something like Abraham offering up Isaac his only son a type of God gave his son hundreds of years later how that Joseph was sold in in prison hated of his brothers loved of his father Jesus enti how the spirit worked through Joseph A man and simply typed the Life of Christ perfectly how David the son of David sat on the same Mount when David was rejected his King and went up over the hill n of all is looking back weeping as a rejected King a few hundred years after that the son of David climbed the same Hill as a rejected King and WEP over Jerusalem the spirit and type and form oh then can you see the great Pentecostal Church in this last days can you see how God inaugurated at the day of Pentecost that Spirit should remain in the church to all ages they got farming indiff they had to have a denomination they had the United church and state together and they finally did it and caused hundreds of years of persecution then the Reformation they come out in each year they've been cutting off from the spirit and adding on to the Natural off of the spirit and add on to the Natural until now they're just ready to do it again yes we're living in these last closing hours the confirmation of the church we are in the Philadelphia or the lady oan churching God now the first chapter first verse was introduced to to John Now who is the writer John John it was not a revelation of John and uh we know that it wasn't because it was the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ he was he was chosen for a disciple and uh the book itself reveals the thing that it was Jesus Christ to who he was revealing and it was sent to the and signified this by his Angel unto John we do not know who the angel was the Bible doesn't say who the angel was but we know that it was a prophet because the Bible later said that I Jesus has sent my angel to testify these things which must shortly come to pass then we find out that when John started to worship the angel the angel said see that you do it not Revelations 22 I believe it is and he said for I am of thy fellow servants and of the prophets it might have been Elijah it might have been one of the prophets John was an apostle but this Prophet was sent and John being an apostle look at the nature of the rest of his Epistles proved that it wasn't John wrote it because it has no nature natur like John take first John 2 John so forth and read it and look at the nature of that then look at the nature of this John was a riter and was an apostle but this is the spirit of a prophet a different person all together see wasn't John's writing wasn't John's Revelation it was God's revelation of Jesus Christ to the churches amen and it had John was just the writer The Scribe and um and the book declares the same now it wasn't addressed to John it was a address to the church all right John at that time was the pastor of the Ephesian church and now the book is addressed to John or to the church not to John now the third verse he announces the blessings listen to this blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand what time is it hand the time these things take place when this revelation of Jesus Christ is completed in each Church age now the reason he wrote it like this if he' have said um well now there looking if it been revealed if he it would have been revealed to John that he was go to come as soon as those churches there was finished that's the way John thought it but if it was them churches as soon as they was finished they come if he knew if it' been revealed to him there's going to be seven long Church ages several thousand years or several hundreds of years then there wouldn't be no reason of waiting they just live their Church A J therefore God spoke it and it wasn't revealed to them it wasn't revealed to Martin Luther the things that John Wesley knew about the Scripture it isn't revealed to the Baptist what the Pentecostals knows about scripture because it's in a different age it's a different time and God Reveals His things just in the season oh you can't plant corn in the springtime and reap at the same time you plant a seed and it grows to maturity God plants his word and it grows right out and then we look back and say there it was well sure we see it after it's been revealed now blessed the word the announcement of the blessing on the third verse to them that read or hear its Mysteries the carnal mind shuns it because the carnal mind knows nothing about it no wonder the carnal mind doesn't know it because it's Satan in that carnal mind and Satan is exposed and Satan does not want himself exposed do you notice how horrible it is for Satan when he thinks he's going to be exposed watch in one of the services watch the action of the people you watch out on the meeting just before Satan's go to be exposed over a certain person you see their face changing you see they don't know what to think all at once the Holy Spirit comes down and exposes that devil oh he hates that kind of a meeting it's the reason we've had such a battle because the word of God exposes the devil see it tells what he is amen like you say this woman sitting here under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit say her name is Miss Jones she come from so and so what does that do it picks up her spirit brings it up to a place how do you know me that man doesn't know me so it must be some Spirit what kind of spirit is it it's the spirit of God H what's the matter with me you have tuberculosis cancer whatever it is but thus sayith the Lord oh oh how Satan hates that because it exposes him now the carnal mind looks on and says mind reading mental telepathy they don't know it's foolish to them but to those who know what it is oh what blessing what is it a revelation a revelation of who of the man on the pulpit of Jesus Christ in this last Church AG revealing himself like he promised you would do the Revelation see and Satan hates that my how he hates it he's exposed exposes his plan Satan hates the revelations and Genesis they got wrot down here that is exactly true now why does he hate a Revelations why is he so against Revelations is because that the inire cannon of God's word and God's church is solemnly built upon Revelation it will never be through a a school no matter how many fine seminaries we have they are way back in the dmed age the Bible and the church is absolutely a revelation let us turn I've got some scriptures right I here uh Matthew the the 16th chapter and the 18th verse let's just take a little look at Matthew 1618 see where the scriptures is for it's the Revelation coming down from the mountain the 17th verse and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it un to thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it now the Catholic Church says he built it up on Peter well that that's really carnal thinking you couldn't imagine a spiritual mind of comprehending such a thing as that is god with his own son standing there and yet would build his church upon a common hard near sin born man the man proved he with that same Spirit up on him he cursed Jesus and denied him right to his face it wasn't Peter or neither was it a rock that was laying there as some Churches claim it was was not a rock CA Peter the rock that he was speaking about there was not Peter neither was it himself now many of the Protestant people try to say it was Jesus it was him that he built the church upon on he no that's still wrong if you notice it was not Jesus neither was it Peter it was the Revelation flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father which is in heaven has done this this Revelation look I want to asked you in the Garden of Eden there was no scriptures written and then the two boys Cain and Abel and they both wanted to make a sacrifice and to find favor with God when they did so Cain come and built an altar Abel build an altar well if that's all God requires God would be unjust to condemn Cain all right then Cain made a sacrif so did Abel both of them made a sacrifice Kain worshiped and so did Abel Kain did everything that able did so if going to church belonging to church making sacrifices and praying and worshiping God is all God requires then God would be unjust to condemn Cain for doing exactly what he said to do but you see Abel by a revelation he know that it wasn't fruit that brought him out of the Garden of Eden as many carnal minds think today Abel come and offer the fruit of the land and God refused it but it was revealed I mean Cain did excuse me Cain offered the fruit of the land because he thought that's what brought him out of the Garden of Eden What's that revelation watch's the disagreement with it watch how it hurts today but it was not fruit that brought him out Eve never eat no apples certainly how did she realize she was naked if eating apples it pertained to the sexual life had to now we take that as a study and we have get back in they haven't got one scripture some of them say well she said I got a son from The Lord yes sir so do the prostitutes God has to make all life but it's a perverted Li look at the nature that boy was of his daddy the devil hatred mean M see and then how Abel when the parents probably told him that the trees had fruit on it and so forth but it was revealed to Abel Abel went and got a lamb for blood taking life not a fruit tree bringing apples and bananas and pears but Able by spiritual Revelation Hebrews 11 offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice God testifying of it amen for it was revealed to him by faith that's where God build his church for Flesh and Blood never revealed this do you never learned it in a seminary somebody ever taught it you somewhere but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you there the whole thing is on Revelation the whole church Upon This Rock of revelation of Jesus Christ I build my church you might take what the pastor says you might take what the Seminary teaches you might take what the church says and it's not right yet you might be able to explain it with eloquence but until God has revealed to you that Jesus Christ is his son and you are saved to his blood upon that Revelation that he is my savior Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail again so then you see what Satan is so against the Book of Revelation anything that's revealed spiritual Revelation Satan's against it that's why so against the ministry today they call what is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

first came into the message he was in Phoenix and I was in California and then I got to meet Larry I've stayed in when I used to travel to Phoenix I would stay in brother and sister hatton's home and um Philip was married and so I would stay there and I just had just a wonderful example with the hattens um how many new brother and sister Hatton yeah old school Saints just I'm sure they're in glory this morning and so God bless each of you we like to go right in uh right to the word we like to welcome you to the house of the Lord and if you have your Bibles just stand for the reading of God's word um we've been in this Ephesians chapter 6 and we started with um well we've been off and on and it seems like we can't get out of it but I wanted to go into it one more time this morning Ephesians chapter 6 and by way of announcements the little kids the Sunday school has a play for us tonight so I think they'll be ready and so they've worked very hard there's a little skit a little play and uh that's their Ministry I guess so we'll come and support them uh this afternoon I'll be regular service but we'll take time to have that Ephesians chapter 6 verse number 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil amen we'll take one more scripture in in Luke 4 I think we read this last time we read it again this is a conversation that Satan is having with Jesus the son of God you'll find it in Matthew chapter 4 I believe but Luke chap 4 is where we're going to read verses number one and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command these stones that it may that it be made bread and Jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and the devil taking him up into a high mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever I will I give it if thou therefore will worship me all shall be thine and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shal Worship the Lord thy God and him only sh thou serve amen so we're going to be exposing Satan's tactics just the title is Ephesians chapter 6 exposing Satan's tactics let's pray one more time lord Jesus we commit ourselves into your hand once again as we read a portion of your word Lord may you open it up to our heart understanding for this service Lord bless the Saints there in Phoenix Brother Art and the families there the different ones that were streaming Lord the good speeds faithful Saints Lord that you would remember them and feed them is our prayer and each one from our youngest ones to the oldest ones in our midst we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated exposing Satan's tactics now this is a conversation that we see Jesus having with Satan um it's a it's a it's a pattern or a layout of how Satan attacks and his schemes and the ways he goes about doing things and we read many scriptures for you last time on his um you know who he was you know there's a scripture in Ezekiel that says that that you are wiser behold Thou Art wiser than Daniel and we know that Daniel Noah and job were specifically brought out as righteous men that even if they lived in the city that City had gone so far into sin that even if those three righteous men were in the city the Lord points out those characters Noah uh job and Daniel and here the prophet is pulling and catching Satan in the spirit showing that he was wiser than Daniel now in 1 Chronicles chapter 21 we read that for you last time but let's take 2 Samuel chapter 24 briefly if you can turn there in your Bible and this is the word of the lord it's recorded twice this happening we read um first uh 2 Samuel last Sunday let's take we were at 1 Chronicles 21 last Sunday Let's Take 2 Samuel chapter 24 and this is what the Bible says and again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and he moved David against them to say go number Israel in Judah for the king said to joab the captain of his host who which was with him go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan even to berseba and number ye the people that I may know the number of the people and job joab said unto the king now the Lord thy God add unto the people how many soever they be and H hundredfold and that the Eyes of My Lord the king may see it but why doth my Lord the king Delight in this thing not withstanding the king's word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people now it's recorded a little differently in 1 Chronicles how many remember that in Chronicles 21 verse one it says that Satan stood up against Israel and provoke David to number Israel so which one of those are true uh both of them are and Satan was behind it all but he gets it into the mind of David to number the children of Israel which was which ought not to have been so I'm not sure exactly why I don't know if it was because it was his pride to know how many people so you can boast on the number because there's places in the Bible where they were numbered it's called a census you know you want to know how many soldiers foot people and so forth and so numbering the people it was done before but why was it wrong for David to number the people however or whatever we know it was wrong and finally after he did it and remember something moved him to do it the Bible says that the Lord was upset with Israel so he moved David but when you uncover what actually happened in Chronicles along with uh 2 Samuel you see that Satan was behind this and David was a man after God's Own Heart heart David wasn't a a lukewarm person David had experiences with God and he was very well equipped as a true representative of a man that really loved the Lord and served him but look how Satan got into him to number the people and the scripture goes on to say in verse 10 that David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and David said unto the Lord I have sinned greatly in that I have done what I have done now I beseech thee Oh Lord take away the iniquity of thy servant of course we know that the prophet Gad came to him and gave him three options how you want to take this beating David give you three options did your parents ever give you options on it's either a belt or a switch which one you going to get it though and so he gives David these options and David chooses to go into the hands of the Lord the ultimately lose a lot of people but I wanted to point out that in 2 Samuel 24 it doesn't mention Satan at all there's no mention that Satan was behind any of this but as the word of the Lord begins to open up you'll see that it was Satan that moved him to do it and he fell into it it and after he did it he was convicted the Bible says his heart smote him now this um this Satan Desiring and having the power and the ability to give power to whomsoever he will um we see this in the Book of Job and the Book of Job 1 ver 7 says uh just right at the beginning there it says that the sons of God there came a day that they uh came to meet the Lord and Satan came with him he came with this congregation now so what is Satan doing here so the Lord asked him Satan where comest thou what are you doing he says I'm just doing my thing I'm roaming through the Earth to and fro he like this just cruising through the Earth to and fro and then the sons of God meet and he shows up there too twice is recorded in the scripture chapter one and chapter two in chapter one and the Lord asked Satan have you considered my servant job remember if the Lord ask a question it's not because he don't already know the answer but he asked Satan have you considered my servant job and look at what job says job says well yeah and the Lord says he's there's no one like him he says well yeah you got a you got a hedge built around him everything around him is covered taking care of his house his animals everything that he has his very life is covered but but if you remove all that I'll get him to curse you to your face I will get in him and I will cause him to look you in the face and curse you that's what I'll do but I can't get to him now what a powerful thought to see how Satan his bounds are have been ordered he can only come as far as he is allowed to come remember Satan can't make you do anything but he can influence you and he's behind every evil thought every evil you know if he was to Shadow you and Shadow you in your day and follow you at your work which he does and we don't see it like that but he Shadows us and follows us he'd be taking notes on your behavior and he will move against you just as soon as he can but when God has a hedge about his children thank God for it if you have a protection around you that's not in Your Own Strength that's because the Lord has his protection around you and we thank God for it and so we see that this that this power that the enemy has can never be underestimate let's go to the message here just for a moment and here what the prophet of God says about this don't never underestimate his tactics paragraph number 29 in the message bomb of Gilead he says this here that's what's the matter today all the nation goes into sin whiskey joints of people getting cold andal uncensored radio programs uncensored television program and it's so fascinating and sin is so beautiful until it attracts the attentions of the people and if they're not truly born again where their attent attraction is on Christ and and single-minded then they'll go after that stuff they'll act like those people the spirit of that will get on them used to be the old Pentecostals wouldn't let their children go to picture shows the devil pull one over on their eyes he brought the picture show right into the house that's right and so you see how he got it slick wise slimy me as he can be don't you never underestimate him you stay under the cross it's the only place to stay for safety the prophet of God continues in the message expectations and he says this here paragraph 75 he says talking about brother Argan brigh he says A Real Fine brother he's not here tonight or he be on the platform minor arganbright is a gun Barrel straight he's a fine man you can put your trust in minor organ bright arganbright as a Christian I've been with him on all kinds of meetings he was sitting there that night when 15 witch doctors on each side trying to blow the thing away and seeing there the storm lifting around 30 or 40,000 people that tent shaking them witch doctors cutting that feather and pointing it toward Ward me with them scissors and going through there and chanting and said they they call the storm they did it don't you never underestimate them so they called the storm and said we'll blow it away and that great big place moving up and down like that so brother man was talking about some meetings he had in Germany and how those witches and witch doctors came together and he used they used the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost and they cut their little thing their little Wizardry you know in the US we'll laugh at that we're kind of funny we'll joke at it because we don't understand that black magic is real and demon powers are real and witches are real we're not talking about the guy out here playing games but there is a dark demonic power that the prophet of God told us about and this is why we just don't run out on the on the gospel Mission field of our own accord and go out there thinking you can just say whatever you want to and do whatever you want to and not have a life of prayer and not be called of God to do it you'll come up short because them powers are real we see it in the book of Acts we cast out Satan by the one that Paul speaking them demons turned on them quickly wrapped them up handled them kicked them out and they took off AB used so we know that the power of Satan is real and we're not glorifying him but that's the reality today is Sunday that's a reality and Satan is real that's another reality and you got to face the fact that you have a real enemy not just after us as a group but after each and every one of us as individuals you think you are a a servant of the Lord or a Christian for so many years you was born in the message or you were raised around it or you're old and wise you've seen churches split come and go or you've been in it for a long time you seen a lot don't you never ever ever underestimate Satan's power because they are real and demon powers are real and if Satan can keep you satisfied where you're at he'll let you stay there he'll take you as far as he can get you to go but if he's got you hooked up into something he'll keep you right there cold church member whatever it is and brother brandom tells us this in the message one more quote here Israel in the church and he says this here paragraph 34 just a little above that he says when Jesus come they were holy men and Jesus said you are of your father the devil said you do eror not knowing the power of God neither the word of God could you imagine the Lord Jesus Christ calling a holy righteous scholar Bible student a devil but he did now if you go back you'll find out where it come from and watch it's moving right out today in a terrible Force oh it behooves you my brother sister to consider what you're listening at and don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceive don't you never underestimate him you can't listen to everybody come on somebody you can't hear every song you can't download every every ad somebody send you every text somebody every tape somebody send you every quotation or note that somebody sends you has to come through the filter of God's word and God did not call you to listen to every body that's why you it behooves you to consider who you're listening to because his ability to plant a seed and all he has to do is plant a seed of doubt that's it you don't have to backslide today we're not working on you to backslide today but he's looking at you in five years from today he's looking at your future he's trying to destroy you and so it behooves us to consider his tactics it's a real enemy a real devil and we don't hear it much and we don't realize it as much as we should but here on the tape tape after tape the prophet is crying out this warning to stay with the word and every few years a new doctrine starts and folks just fall off their backslide and say what was they listening to that was always in the T what was they listening to good question and so don't never underestimate the watch is moving right out in a terrible force it behooves you my brother and sister to consider what you're listening at and don't you never underestimate Satan's power for deceiving don't you never underestimate him he's smooth as he can be and the Antichrist Spirit isn't communism no the Antichrist spirit is so closed like the real thing till deceive the very elect if possible said Jesus Matthew 24 it's a religious spirit oh while Cain and Abel they were brothers The Crow and the dove sat on the same Roots Esau and Jacob were brothers Judas and Jesus was in the same church one the preacher the other one the treasurer see there's always just the deceiving of course our treasurers are Sanctified and filled with Holy Ghost and Satan told the evil was 90% truth 90% truth the lie that you can't tell how I've heard me men bypass pieces in the scripture just to keep from it hurts their theology they bypass the quotes too they bypass some of the Visions yes they do but if this part's right that's parts right let's put it together and make it fit through the whole Bible now so here that warning the prophet giving us don't ever estimate Satan's power now brother bam tells us and I brought this many times over the years it's a set of quotes on Satan's power to reason to get you the reason in fact brother brandham tells us it was what he studied the human race on it was his most beneficial his most famous attack was human reasoning it he says that it was a supernatural thought for him to catch it to use reasoning and brother bandam tells us that reasoning makes sin appealing so he's not going to come right out because he because he can't make you do anything but he can influence persuade you talk you into you talk you down how many people have been arrested and being interrogated for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and they'll get people to confess to crimes that they never committed this this just a police officer that that'll get a a young guy or young girl in the room and pressurize them so much that the nerves can't take it they're tired and they just give up and they confess and say they did something that they never did it happens all all the time what about Satan talking to you and working on you yes so this is what reasoning does what is reasoning and and remember we're talking about the three man the body the soul and the spirit the body the spirit and the soul and in that Spirit you have conscious memory reasons affections and imaginations what is reasoning this is what reasoning in because we use it every day we use it in driving we use it it to adjust our speed we use it can I take that green light or can I do this or not am I going to fall am I going to stumble should I go down this dark alley we use it all the time it's a part of being a human being and Satan sees that so he's got to use something that you're familiar with it's like a fisherman so what is reasoning reasoning is the action of thinking about something in a logical way a sens of away what's wrong with that what's wrong with that to internalize what the prophet said and say is that reasonable yeah that makes sense to me that that we do it all the time but that's the Avenue of reasoning and Satan uses it it is his most famous tactic to get you to reason with the word of God and then it's the use of Reason especially to to form conclusions we use that to form conclusions so the prophet of God tells us this in so many places I read two or three of them through the set of quotes I gave you back there says let's take this one here in the first one there in the message take on the whole armor of God paragraph 82 the prophet of God says this now notice Satan tried to get in there to spy out to see how he could get a hold of that human race and he took one of the most famous tactics will show well it showed that he had to be a supernatural power to think of it and he used this the first time and was successful and he's done it ever since and still successful to a certain estate now let me ask you something all of the controversial issues that are in the message today why are there controversial they're controversial because they don't make sense with our timeline they don't make sense with that Vision he gave in 1977 or the brown bear or the 10th Vision or the third pool they don't make sense because here we are in 2024 is not reasonable but what did the tape say what did the scripture say so I'm not in the business of explaining the word word of God but as a Believer it is my duty to say what the word says is that right Saints absolutely and Satan will come in and he'll start working on you on some reason of that doesn't make any sense you know that time has passed here we are it doesn't you know we don't need to do that anymore brother B talked marriage and divorce that's not necessary anymore and look at what they did to it foot washing not necessary anymore in many churches what about the gifts of the Spirit why do we need gifts of the Spirit in the church well because the Bible said so he put them in there why do we need a healing service when I got health care and I got a famous doctor and I got a dental plan why do I need Divine Healing what's the big deal with cutting my hair just a little bit of it what difference does it make in water baptism isn't it good enough that they're getting baptized you know what reasoning is a powerful tool that's what gets you to stop because something sounds reasonable but you got to weigh it out with God's word and God's word will always stand the test of time but there why do we need to preach the Holy Ghost today you know we got the word you don't even need this alter here what you got the alter up here for take it out take it out put it in the basement or put it out ain't nobody using it anyways we can use this space up here come on help me preach what do we got to all what do we need the Holy Ghost for huh because that's the only answer for the Rapture and I I don't care if I stop preaching it or every other Pulpit stops preaching in it it's in your Bible and it's on your tapes yes sir that authenticates it and God would always have a man or a woman that believes it do that with all my heart so he used reasoning this great power of reasoning let's take this in the message the trumpet gives an uncer sound 1963 the prophet of God says this in paragraph 121 says now the enemy spy Satan tried to find out what could he do to break into that so he knowed he just couldn't come out and Bluff her so the only thing he could do was to get her on reasoning and that's what God uses today to fortify his church is his word and Satan comes around with reasoning power Satan know that that was the loophole that was the place that people would break the easiest was at reasoning yes can I go a little bit further let's take this one here in the message the way of a true prophet he says that he introduced the program of reasoning against the word being so and it sounded very logical that was in the message the way of a true Prophet but I'm going to take this one here this is in the message there's only one way provided by God 1963 paragraph 92 the prophet of God says this here one word caus every heartache every sickness every death even the coming of the Lord Jesus to die to redeem us Eve she disbelieved she just reasoned with Satan Satan reason with her well honestly God won't do it see that's Lucifer's business today you know Satan's in business Lucifer's in business that's his business right there say God can't turn us down we're too big We Stand tens of thousand million strong you think God turn us down he's sure he's already done it when you reject his word you're on the other side it isn't God turns you down you've turned God down there it is all right let me move off of this here I got one more I want to read in this and this is very important I pray that you'll hear this here paragraph 77 in the message proving his word 1964 prophet of God says this here paragraph 77 Satan led her to to disbelieve it for Satan himself never did believe it he don't believe it so he led her to believe it and he still does the same thing and teaches others the same and they just believe it like she did God fortified his people behind his word that your o that's your only defense not your denomination not your father or your mother it's all right but behind God's word that's the place that the believer is protected behind the word when that little Avenue was broken there with a little wonder if it's right or not it wouldn't reasoning come in and took the place of Faith they broke the bars and God kept his God kept his word he performed it Satan tried to get her to disbelief so you see the little Avenue was broken right there and that's all he has to get the little Avenue to open up so Satan studies the human race he studies and he knows that the most famous tactic was reasoning now if he was shadowing you today um what would he what would he do in studying you do do you think he knows uh what your Temptations are he knows the flavor The Taste whatever whatever you are and he watches you and so you young Brothers know that you're supposed to turn your head on something that's ill Fame you see something that's wrong you look at it 1001 1002 turn your head 1001 100002 and some places you go just have to have your head on the swivel or put your head down or look up because there's so much craziness now I shouldn't have to have my head on a swivel In The House of the Lord I shouldn't have to come to church and I'm just like oh my good unless the sinner's trying to be saved but not amongst our sisters and our brothers right but Satan studies that and he sees that okay he's turning his head he's tur his head he's turning his head but that one took 1,1 1002 13 then he turned his head H why did he take him so long let's write that down we'll make sure his new secretary or the next job he's at will drop somebody along that fits that whatever it is he studies that's what I would do that's what you would do I know there's fish in the lake I know that they live there so I'm going fishing for something that I know it's there it's just a matter of me getting them to bite what color are they biting on what part of the lake and I'm taking notes if I caught him in October then this time next year in October I'm going to be there because I'm studying the species the fish that I'm going after and Satan has studied you my brother my sister this is why for the for you know for those of us that know the word and it's the seven seal message that uncovers who Satan is that's why we know who he is the Bible says that he deceives all both small and great and many temples Tabernacles sanctuaries and religious people are worshiping him thinking they're worshiping God because his power to deceive can never be overestimated but we have we've underestimated him we haven't given him the respect of his ability to crush you if you ever get out of the the program and plan of God you know with our own power we have no power against him he's wiser than Daniel who in here could have the testimony that Daniel had no friends no church no Believers nobody to encourage him and he kept the victory in a foreign land and kept his dietary laws stayed faithful with his prayer life and had the victory in a foreign land we can barely get by if we don't have enough young people in our church who here is better than Daniel not to compare like that but he's wi sir wiser than Daniel M so with that the tempter is there to tempt us on every level on every hand we see it in Matthew that we read with our lord Jesus but then we also know there are three major things that brother Brandon says a man has to be careful of especially a minister how many know what they are huh money women and popularity which one of those would be the worst you'd say oh a brother fall with a woman he's dead in his ministry that's a death blow just pack it up up door the doors have closed that's a horrible one right but is that the worst of the three y'all ain't helping me preach this morning I give you permission to say Amen so here the prophet of God is three places I want to read for you here we all know it but I want to read it for you to bring it into the room so this is what we know that brother brandom tells us and why are people so uh tossed about in paragraph number 13 he says um so I knew that usually in reading that men who get the Lord blessed them just a little bit nice little detail there nice little detail there the Lord bless a man just a little bit so he's preparing himself to go into the meetings with the ministry that nobody has had before he didn't have a contemporary to to go and compare care how they should act when an angel come in because nobody else had Angels coming to them like that he couldn't go to his Pastor Dr Davis he had to go on the field and here he's preparing to go to the battlefield and he notice in the word so brothers and sisters this is for us this is part of the armor that we put on to prepare ourselves Satan don't stop he says here usually in reading that men who get the Lord blessed him just a little bit there's about three major things that usually brings a minister to his back to the rut notice them one of them was money women popularity those three things I noticed in the scripture money was a prophet balum sold out his gift on the account of money when Bayo offer so much money many of you are acquainted with that story Samson it was to Delilah and he goes on he talks about Saul it was popularity paragraph number 18 and this is the three major causes that I see in the Bible that cause men to fall and I ask our heavenly father to please let me shun at all times at all times at all times those things as especially these three major things amen amen and had kept a covering over them I thought you saved brother bam I thought you got the Holy Ghost I thought you were believer I thought you was called of God keep a covering over it yes Lord keep it covered because these are three of the major things he tells us go a little bit further being led of the Holy Spirit Minneapolis paragraph number n9ine then after he told me and sent me into the work I knew that there would be things that we'd have to watch and one of them is money the other one's popularity and women there's three things that man falls with and ministers especially so he's talking about man and ministers especially notice in The Bible series we find out bam so he goes on just a little bit there in the message show us the father prophet of God says this here don't worry I'll preach on Grace next time and we'll all be happy okay but if you can see it this is God's grace show us the father you know safety is is under is under what did you call it it's under um you know we'll praise the hero that saves the day but you know the guy that kept you safe from getting in an accident what's it called underrated preparation and safety is as boring as the day goes by just boring until a trouble happens and then you was like oh where well I didn't have I didn't have insurance I need to back up I need to make sure I got this I got to take care of this if you did all those things every day ain't nobody gonna praise you for nothing but God gave us a way that a man can prepare himself and stay and and watch out for these things through a life of prayer sure so he says here I know there'll be a lot hooked up into this there was nobody on the field in them days and me being a Baptist coming out amongst Full Gospel people I realized what it was going to be and there was three things that I noticed in the Bible that always a minister and one of them was money the other one was popularity and women so I know that Saul fell because of popularity balum because of money Samson because of women so then I know those three things was a hindrance that we must always keep covered up and money of course would be the greatest and or trying to think you're just a little better what than somebody else so we see this Pride that Satan fell because of it and we see that the prophet of God gives a warning to men to keep these three major things covered in prayer now there is a a interesting scripture is found in Hebrews 12 verse1 and it talks about the besetting sin and let's turn there quickly so we can just touch this just for a moment this is not just the everyday sin this is a a sin that constantly besets Hebrews 12:1 I think that's where it is therefore saying we also have compassed about with so great a cloud of witness let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so what easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so brother bandam calls these the besetting sins these are the sins that they don't go away easily and he identifies Moses's temper as a besetting sin and when Satan got Moses to strike the rock twice he got into he got into his anger he got into his temper and it caught him off guard Moses loved the Lord and he loved the people of God he was trying to help these people and these people kept pushing him and pushing him and pushing him to finally he snapped I mean I feel sorry for the guy he sna got his bch water for you rebels brought us through the Red Sea gave us a token the death angel passed signs wonders and miracles food out of the heavens and yet some of y'all still upset not satisfied he cracked cracked he cracked his temper snapped on them brother random tells us here in the message Israel and the church and he was born in this world to be a deliverer just like Christ paragraph 18 and oh how his work how he was a lawgiver he went up into the mountain and stayed 40 days come back out with the law and he his besetting sin was temper he broke the Commandment went back up showing that the priesthood Must Die away all right let's get into this besetting s a little bit more the message making the valley full of ditches the prophet of God says this here paragraph number 11 says drop down a little bit our heavenly father in the name of Jesus thy beloved child we come as humbly as we know how ask you for forgiveness of our sins and trespasses whatever we have did or said into this day or any other time in our life that's against us tonight we humbly bow and confess and I pray for this audience of people as they raise their hands many of them Father are maybe desperately in need of forgiveness some besetting sin some habit some sickness some disease or Affliction some loved one that's in trouble whatever it is father I pray that you forgive and forget all their iniquity and heal all their diseases and the message stands still 1957 amen y'all going to let me finish this message this morning little tight stand still in [Music] Saskatoon am I on my own or what I got somebody on my side I know Satan don't like me y'all love me but Satan don't like me and he don't like you either sure don't no he don't stand still paragraph 22 he says this here and it come to a place where they were totally cut off at the Red Sea seeing as if all nature quivered for them the skies could have wept everything the mountains could have shook they were in terrible condition a covenant people as you are and as we are and had come up against the blockade maybe you're there tonight maybe it's in the way maybe you got an Affliction Maybe you got to have it maybe it's some besetting sin that you can't lay down something has blocked your road and the world was looking saying now let's see how much he's going to keep his religion in this kind of a time that's the way Israel stood but Moses said stand still and see the glory of God don't get flustrated stand still praise the Lord I won't ask you I won't embarrass you but how many of you have ever had a besetting sin you know some things just Dro right off some things drop right off others struggle with it but it didn't bother me drop right off drop right off but this thing right here keeps bothering me I'm tired of it I'm sick of it you know Paul had an issue where he was looking for healing and God wouldn't heal him like in the Bible said he was the Healer why you won't heal me I sought the Lord three times I sought the Lord please Heal Me Lord Heal my eyes I can read better heal my eyes I can preach better heal my eyes I can serve you better then the Lord showed him I've allowed this on you because the abundance of Revelations I got to keep you here Paul because of the revelations you see too much and then Paul knew he put it in perspective he says now I'll glory in my afflictions by his grace his grace is sufficient for me how many need his grace I guarantee you you need his grace sometimes we think we doing it on our own we ain't doing it on our own it's his grace that's keeping us from falling back into the sin that he delivered us from from besetting sins they come back they come back to haunt you you've been prayed for come back to H come back to get you come back to get you by his grace we are saved today thank God for it yes so we know that these besetting sins they exist huh try to lay them down they don't leave like that brother Bram says greater is the power of Christ that's than that little besetting sin that you can't overcome let's take the Holy Spirit and fight the devil down walk out Victorious as the heroes of the Cross let us pray that was in the message the Oneness of unity amen got two or three more on that the setting sin but we'll move on just a little a little bit I just want to show you that you know even with the real adversary a real devil then you got the real you problems the issues that are in you that you you will self-destruct all by yourself did you know that you got the you got the ingredients to do it you will fall back you will fail it's in you it's in your Fallen nature it's in your DNA it's there but when God Saves you we now he now gives us the blood to overcome these weakness these weaknesses and so forth so here brother bandam deals with something here see if I have time to get into this yes he deals with this in the message Christ is revealed in his own word now he's talking about the neurotics of the age how this age is en entirely nervous they have this oppression upon the age he calls it tensions brother bandam calls them it's in the message Christ was revealed in his own word paragraph number 18 I was just talking to a young Minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world rest of the human beings on Earth I said remember Satan's God A Punch coming at you don't care who you are he's got a right for that one punch which would you had it rather be that punch be blind or be an arthritic setting in a chair or be nervous see he's got somewhere he can punch you he's got a right to that open place now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time and to see this nervous age that we're living in and last week's tap I think we'll reveal it to you the great hideous things that we're going to speak on in these days when we can get a place sufficient of the opening of those last plagues to be poured out upon the Earth those vows rather pouring out of the vows in the seven Thunders and those hideous sights that's coming upon the Earth man now and people today are in such a nervous condition the whole world he goes on further in that same message and he's dealing with the imagination of men that they would be tormented they'd be tormenting themselves he goes deeper and talks about how the hybrid foods have caused this you know the food today it's not about nutrition now they've supercharged it with something else it's the experience it's the class it's the it's the notori it's on the you know what's it social media not not political media not the media outside but my media social media and it's all around what we're eating this this is interesting how Satan will use that and supercharge it but brother M is you got to keep that spot covered in prayer so Satan got an open shot at you like you can't brace for it you can't cover your face for it he gets one solid knock against your Noggin right in the face he got a spot to hit you he has a right brother random says have you taking that punch yet that's a real question are you taking it now or is that punch coming up the road for you the this is real information for you Satan does not want to be exposed he does not want to be uncovered and really he has something that he's trying to achieve through you now Satan wants you to do something he wants something from you remember let's go back to our text when he's talking to Jesus he showed him the kingdoms of the world in a moment's time like maybe it was an app he can download and just show it like you can see the world in a moment's time just go look but Satan took him up to a high place showed them the kingdoms of the world in the glory of them he said I'll give it to you because it's been given me the power to give it to whoever I choose I've always wondered about this I've always wondered about this um you know how Satan's kingdoms work the Bible says that Satan cannot cast out Satan or his kingdom would be divided how there's even a Unity amongst that but you know you know in the rap industry or rock and roll or rhythm and blues or country resting or whatever worldly music you'll always have you know just the neighborhood guys and the local guys and the regional guys and then you'll have a superstar that like transcends all Races cultures and everybody it's like everybody wants that everybody wanted to be a Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley or the Beatles who who gives one the power and the ability to excel in their anointing in their notoriety and their Fame Everybody Wants To Be A Tailor Swift some of y'all probably got her music downloaded that's yeah no sir nobody here do praise the Lord delete delete delete yeah but who who gives these people this anointing what do they get it from they all wanted they all in the studio they all putting in work who gives some this ability to rise above the other and so now now everybody underneath that they look ascribe to that everybody wanted to be a Michael Jackson or the latest rap group or whatever I can call them out there and the little little guys in the neighborhood I had a little rap group you see what I'm doing today though don't you it that didn't work out for me did it praise the Lord but everybody's quoting that music Corner think you're a star think you're this in the mirror trying to do why do some achieve and others don't Satan's got got the power he's got the power the Bible says so and here we see it clearly when he comes to job in the worship meeting he wanted job but he couldn't have job until God said go get him till God dropped the protection off of him oh my goodness if you ever can give God praise for his grace and mercy to keep you you ought to be the most grateful and thankful that you're not caught up into some foolishness because if he moves his hand off of you there go your family there go your husband there goes your marriage there goes your morality all of it if God's Grace isn't there to keep you covered so what does he tell us to do in his word he tells us wherefore put put on the whole armor of God put it all on put on the helmet of salvation that you are saved put on the breastplate of his righteousness I think is Psalms 27 I quote it every morning every Sunday morning as I'm preparing it talks about how he the the false Witnesses are risen up against against me Lord lead me into a plain path because of my enemies and this these paths and these Pathways that you go down it's like the Lord delivered you from this anger this temper this lust and all the things of the world and he puts you on a plain path called salvation The Road to Glory but then Satan comes in the pathway now to get you to open up one of them Gates to go down the neighborhood path just for a little while and that's his job he's the tempter he's the wicked one he's behind it all it's not my brother it's not my sister it's the devil that gets in between my brother and my sister that's right that's right and we see this discourse with job I'll take a few moments on this amen I'll leave job alone just for a minute let's take our lord Jesus that was a scripture I read this this morning so the prophet of God takes this message the Harvest Time and he says in paragraph 107 let's take this quickly all right my time is almost gone not gone yet but it's almost gone in the Harvest Time paragraph 1 107 I don't have it here sis so if you can just throw it up there as soon as you get it yes remember the Bible said in the mouth of three Witnesses let every word be established we'll get on that in a few minutes look at this the three Temptations of Jesus the three Temptations of ministers today where they make their fall the three Temptations of the church and where they make their fall three Temptations of the organization where it makes its fall and the three Temptations in the what in individuals and where they make their fall now it all runs in threes so brother bam is now taking this uh dialogue with Jesus and Satan and he breaks it down uh to the temptation of Jesus ministers Church organizations and individuals and there's three Temptations and he deals with it the first Temptation brother brandom says in paragraph 147 in the Harvest time now closely confined this now now he finally this one that would arrive and had to be tempted just exactly like the rest of them was tempted now notice how striking Satan makes his every attack just the same each time he tried to give him the natural bread just like he did Eve if you'll eat this and take this or something another he's got it and that's what he does to every organization that's what he does to every individual he tries to give you the natural things that you can look at he wants you to eat something besides the word that's his first tactic here let me move on just a little bit I want you to get that message you get a chance and hear it for yourself preach right in Phoenix December 1964 preaching right in Phoenix and then the second temptation is this paragraph 2112 he says this here I want you to watch this and I'm going to close here in about 10 minutes I'll try to finish right at noon okay is that okay Saints all right notice if Satan fails here then he'll try his second scheme look at your neighbor and say second scheme all y'all didn't look look at him tell him his his who we talking about your enemy his second scheme first he try to get you to take something that's not the word notice Satan fails here then he tries his second scheme on you get you to disbelieve the word and go to the Seminary he'll try his next scheme now here is where you want to be real careful just sit just for another five minutes minutes on this part if you will then he makes you a supernatural offer I'm going to come back to all this just before closing if he can't tempt you away from the word no I'm going to stay with the word then he'll give you a supernatural offer I tell you you get up there dive off the temple bring it back up see show the people that you can do something Supernatural boy he got him there watch this watch when he get this in where the Temptation come maybe he might let some of you speak in tongues think you got it or he might even let you prophesy though it not be with the word I've seen people stand up prophesy was contrary to the word as East is from West see it's the word that you live by them Supernatural gifts Satan can just hand them out by handfuls they don't mean one thing who who can hand them out huh Satan can hand out Supernatural gifts by handfuls hand them to people gift to sing gift to inspire they go out here and cut a deal and get in business and get greater and greater inspired by a gift that should be used in the church but they they misappropriated and Satan can hand those out by handfuls and and then brother bam tells us this is where Eve was carried away in her Supernatural understanding that was a supernatural offer when he offered her reasoning against the word it looked like a common conversation but it was a supernatural conversation that he was inspiring her to disbelieve God's word what about today now let's take this last one here the third one is found in paragraph number 29 now Satan's third scheme we'll get to it quickly because we don't want to take more time than possible maybe another 15 20 minutes if you want to go that far notice his third scheme his third Temptations If the others had failed this one won't he now offers you a position in the church you know positions in the church is always a touchy touchy spot who's next in charge who's more important than I'm important but I'm more important than which one are you are you number two or number 32 come on somebody y'all not helping me this morning it's all right but but it's still the truth this is a prophet now he said he says I'll give you the world you'll be a king I'll make you an offer if this one failed this one if others fail this one won't he now offers you a position in the church like he did Jesus I'll give you the world you'll be the king I'll make you they all belong to me so I give it to you now this offering of a position is where Satan fell by and when he inspires you inspires us he wants to inspire Us in that realm to make us better than someone else to have us even more anointed than God himself we can actually we'll actually we're actually doing it of Our Own Strength our own power and it Satan all along inspiring that thought that I am better than the our church is better than their Church our church shows more love than their our church has more anointing have you heard our choir sing our praise and worship is on what about our musicians and know we got the baddest musicians in this city that's us yeah yeah come hear us a got nobody praise like we could praise you hear our pastor right he's good he can preach got to come hear him ain't nobody preach like him position yeah those other churches there are brothers but we're above them a position he offers if the other two don't don't don't fail this one will not fail and it's showing us how Satan comes to Jesus the organizations to ministers to the individual and we're trying to uncover him this is why Ephesians 6 is not a scripture you read once it's not something that weering just some words or a play that the kids are going to play out here these are actually the dress wear for the believer that he's got to put on in prayer in prayer each piece of equipment has to equip That Man helmet of salvation breastplate of right Spirit of Truth sword of the spirit Shield to block all the fiery darts does the devil ever throw any fiery darts at you anointed thoughts anointed catch you in a dream catch you at work catch you out of nowhere anoint a thought and throw it at you you got to have the shield of faith my brother you got to pick up your faith Shield say in the name of Jesus think all these things put the tapes on pick up your Bible go to God In Prayer cuz this my brother and sister you got to be able to stand in the evil day and this is the evil day no question about it it's what does he want from us he wants your praise your worship if he can't get you to praise and worship him that's what he wanted Jesus to do then he wants to use you to curse God to say things that's not in the word remember he got Peter to CSE remember that Spirit came on Peter and caused him to say something that was not in the word and Jesus rebuked him remember that it's in 1954 I don't know the message I just got it quoted here 1954 May the 16th paragraph number three he said a spirit it was a spirit that was on the apostle that was making him say that when he rebuked Jesus time to Remember When yeah uh Peter rebuked Jesus when he was talking about he had to go suffer at the cross Peter rebuked him and Jesus turned around and rebuke Satan uhhuh now what does Satan want from you well if we'll just take a few scriptures I'll reference them and maybe we'll get to them another time my time is gone what he wants from you he can't have it but he wants it anyway he wanted to sift Peter as wheat the Lord looked at Peter just like this I I mean that would have shook me up I think if I would have really really internalized he says Peter Satan desires to sift you as wheat you know what the sifting of the wheat is you have the whole wheat grain the whole stock it grows up it's got the whole plant the leaves and everything when that thing comes to maturity the head of the wheat kind of bowels over and there's a little wheat what they call a wheat berry or the wheat grain in there you can hear it rattle like that how me know what I'm talking about it's mature wheat it's grain it's it's in there but you got to get it out of there and so you beat it you break it down you put it through a process and then you got you know you get it separated from the stock and then you have to get the shaft so you they throw that thing up and then the Wind Blows the shaft off of that's a process it continues to happen and Satan desires to sift you Peter as wheat but but I pray for you I pray for you and he can't have you aren't you so glad that he prayed for you that's the only thing you got goingn for you is that he loves you and he built a hedge about you that Satan can't get you until God says it's your time to go but he desires you he'll hinder you he'll trip you up he's after you he's trying to tempt you trying to get you and with all the weaknesses that you have inherently he's still there's a real enemy after you but Peter I pray for you I pray for you and if Jesus prayed for me you think he'll hear his own prayer amen I got to make it who prayed for you Jesus prayed for me he prayed and I forget the scripture there that those that would come into the he prayed for these but not these alone but those that would believe their word a prayer way out to 2024 Jesus prayer caught you this catching you today Jesus prayed for you but he can't have you because I pray for you don't you love the Lord thank God for his goodness to us you know they they did this I'll just drop this in because I looked it up a little bit brother brandom takes the message a thinky man's filter that we heard on Wednesday a portion of it and he talked about how the tobacco companies how they came up with the slogan so I started to look back a little bit how they um they lied to the American public as you know there's a a gentleman Mike Bloomberg that has this organization it's called stop that's where I got some of the information that he talks about and from early in the 50s they knew that this drug was addictive but because of greed and because of the money they kept lying and pushing it to the people and it came up with the slogans in the filter and the filter was a feminist type of thing so the Marboro company comes up with a master plan and they create this Cowboy ain't nothing more tough than a cowboy brother Rick than a cowboy with the filter cigarette and it went into the billion they 300 times the sales went it was all around greed and money and many of the CEOs don't smoke but they'll they'll sell it to people it's all about greed and money but Satan was behind that how he attached himself through brother bam called it a nicotine devil that's what he called it it was on the tape here it's a devil called nicotine but this company now because of money because of greed they are instruments of Satan and they lied and lied and they got that to the people got everybody hooked on it and they they made it smoother they added mint flavors they did all these things things to it they made it go right into your your mental faculties quicker so you can be satiated and then you have to have another one and then you're hooked on it and the Food and Drug Administration the food companies have done the same thing it's not about nutrition it's about hooking you on something so they can keep their pockets full and if marijuana is wrong and we believe it is what about all the other the drugs huh he's a master in his lies and his deceit and that drug that Tobacco Company lied to the people and they continue to lie till today they say it's less harmful less tar they got these heated pro pro you know the vaping products that out there it's still the same devil but it just looks like a business to me an American Business I mean everybody's free to make their own choices right right we're free to make our own choices that businessman just looking after his family not he didn't hurt nobody he didn't put nobody on cancer it's just my business I'm just own a tobacco farm not knowing that Satan is inspired it the prophet picked it up and catches it and then he ties in this food the hybrid food with the mental oppressions that we have today everybody has lost their mind or losing it and everybody's hooked on something but you need to get hooked on Jesus because he is the original lifegiver and he satisfies a man in his soul if you can just only get that filter of his word God bless you God bless you stand with your loins Girt with truth stand with the sword stand with the word of the Lord God bless you let us pray father we thank you for your word this morning I pray oh God these words will not fall on deaf ears Lord but that the ears would hear what the spirit is trying to say we see the wickedness
