[5:46] Lord, in the inner man. Lord, give us
[5:48] strength

[6:49] Oh God.
[6:51] Oh Lord, we we we long to be there,

[7:02] us, Father, and the world is sealed on
[7:04] the outside and we're sealed there,
[7:07] Lord, and there's no room for anybody
[7:08] else but us and you, Lord. That secret
[7:12] place, Father. that that place where we
[7:14] can be a total prisoner.
[7:16] Lord, where all the church and all the
[7:18] everything else is just sealed on the
[7:20] outside, but it's just us and you
[7:22] together.
[7:23] Oh Lord, we want to worship you tonight,

[7:46] God. That we could talk and walk and
[7:48] talk with you tonight, Lord. That that

[8:32] me
[8:35] and yet he loved
[8:39] me.
[8:45] He whose glory
[8:49] makes
[8:51] the heaven shine.
[8:57] I'm so unworthy
[9:06] of such mercy.
[9:14] When he
[9:16] was on the cross,
[9:22] I was on his mind.
[9:32] You may be seated if we could. Let's go
[9:34] to the key of E flat.

[9:45] on holy
[9:48] ground.

[10:15] Jesus.

[10:26] in
[10:28] his presence on holy
[10:32] ground. One more time with all your
[10:35] heart.

[10:47] ground.

[16:38] but now I'm found.
[16:42] A hopeless case,
[16:46] an empty place
[16:50] if not for grace.
[16:54] Precious Lord,
[16:58] please take my hand
[17:02] and lead me on
[17:06] and help me stand.
[17:10] A hopeless case,

[17:55] an empty place
[17:59] if not for grace.

[19:46] I'm afraid, you end all doubt. Your
[19:51] endless love what is about.
[19:56] You are everything to me.

[20:04] Crying out with my voice. I will lift my
[20:10] hands in praise. His presence is here in
[20:15] this place.

[20:44] silent in the grave
[20:47] Save me for thy mercy. Save my life in
[20:52] your hands.

[22:04] beloved rise and come away.
[22:10] Death is passed. The rain is done. The
[22:14] resurrection
[22:16] has begun.
[22:18] I have seen the seven
[22:23] in the cl of the rock.
[22:29] I will sing unto the Lord,
[22:33] crying out with my voice. I will lift my
[22:39] hands and praise. His presence is here
[22:43] in this place.
[22:46] I know troules they abound.
[22:50] And the wolves of hell surround
[22:54] wrapped in his arms and confidence.
[22:58] Here on the rock
[23:01] there's perfect rest.
[23:07] He is
[23:10] a sinless lamb
[23:14] who left his throne.
[23:19] became a man.
[23:23] So come and find
[23:27] me in my sins
[23:31] and raise them all

[24:31] here on the rock.
[24:35] There's perfect rest.
[25:07] A high ring of mystery in the desert
[25:17] formed by seven
[25:20] angels.
[25:22] The second coming
[25:26] of Jesus Christ.
[25:31] The scoffers
[25:33] have risen against him.
[25:39] They stumbled at this time.
[25:46] Deceived by a strong
[25:50] delusion.
[25:54] They are blind and do not know
[26:01] I am
[26:03] with the cloud.
[26:05] It's not a stumbling stone to me
[26:10] indeed returning like man
[26:14] that is all that I can see. Some may
[26:18] dismiss it as a lie.
[26:21] crying crucified
[26:24] crucified
[26:26] but I can't deny the very essence of my
[26:30] being
[26:32] every
[26:36] doubt is my whole identity
[26:50] was caught up among them. The light to
[26:56] shine on the seven stars.
[27:05] Sent to restore the
[27:09] truth.
[27:11] Call the children
[27:14] and turn them hearts.
[27:20] What did you come
[27:23] to see?
[27:29] More than a prophet was here.
[27:36] The lamb was revealed as he opened the
[27:42] seals. It was God hiding in
[27:48] a mist
[27:53] with the cloud.
[27:56] It's not a stumbling stone to me.
[28:00] If you can turn in like man
[28:04] that is all that I can see some may
[28:08] dismiss it as a lie dying crucified
[28:15] crucified
[28:16] but I can't deny the very essence of my
[28:21] being
[28:23] every
[28:27] cloud is my whole life Identity
[28:39] stars are falling from heaven.
[28:45] Great men lose their footing
[28:49] on the rage.
[28:55] The pale horse is riding with her close
[29:01] behind.
[29:04] The storm of unbeliev
[29:07] We can
[29:11] do not
[29:14] shake hands in spirit or night
[29:19] for these things were prophesied.
[29:28] The man
[29:30] is
[29:32] be
[29:34] revealed. Just keep your stand on my
[29:40] side.
[29:45] out with the power
[29:48] is not a stumbling stone to me
[29:53] in life matter
[29:56] that is all that I can see some dismiss
[30:01] it as a lie dying crucified
[30:07] crucified
[30:09] but I can't deny the very essence of my
[30:15] Every cell in me was there in him. That
[30:19] cloud is my whole identity.
[30:26] I am in with
[30:31] a stumbling stone to me.
[30:35] I did return
[30:39] and that is all that I can see. So may
[30:43] dismiss it as a lie crying crucified
[30:50] crucified
[30:51] but I can't deny the very essence of my
[30:56] being
[30:58] everything
[31:02] that is my whole identity
[31:10] dismissed as a lie crying crucified
[31:17] crucified
[31:19] but I can't
[31:21] essence of my being
[31:25] everything
[31:29] that is my identity.
[31:53] Change the order of the service.
[31:56] Go to the key of G.
[32:01] My Jesus,
[32:05] my savior.
[32:08] Lord, there is none like you.
[32:14] All of my days
[32:18] I want to praise
[32:21] the wonders of your mighty
[32:27] love.
[32:33] My comfort,
[32:36] my shelter,
[32:39] tower of reuge and strength.
[32:45] Let every breath
[32:49] and all that I am
[32:53] never cease to worship
[32:59] you.
[33:03] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[33:08] sing.
[33:11] Power and majesty
[33:14] praise to the king.
[33:21] And the seas
[33:24] will roar
[33:26] at the sound
[33:29] of your name.
[33:34] I sing for joy at the work of your
[33:40] hands.
[33:42] Forever I love you. Forever
[33:47] I stand.
[33:50] Nothing compares to that promise I have
[33:57] in you.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say amen to that?
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you saints. You can be
[34:05] seated just for a moment. We have our uh
[34:09] very special guest, Brother Funk, and it
[34:12] was his wife and and some of Nick's
[34:16] family singing for us tonight. And we
[34:18] enjoy that. and brother um
[34:23] Luke Funk is a minister from up north
[34:27] and we want him to come and greet you
[34:30] all. He's done some missionary work and
[34:31] he's a minister, good friend of brother
[34:34] Barrett and so this is my first time
[34:36] meeting him. We're so happy to have him
[34:38] here with us tonight and we're always
[34:41] looking for new friends. I got enough
[34:45] enemies. And so I'm trying to make as
[34:48] many friends as I can get. And so he
[34:51] seems like a friendly brother. And so
[34:53] let's say amen as he comes and takes a
[34:55] few moments to greet you all. Amen. God
[34:58] bless you.
[35:08] Amen. God bless you saints. It's
[35:10] wonderful to be here with you. It's a
[35:12] privilege to be Tucson and uh just
[35:15] seeing the the love of God in your
[35:17] hearts and uh different ones that I've
[35:20] been able to meet uh on our on our short
[35:22] journey here. We're just here for a few
[35:24] days, but I believe that by God's grace,
[35:26] you know, we can just dip down and
[35:28] reconnect with some of the ones that we
[35:29] knew before in eternity. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful to be here in Shalom
[35:33] Tabernacle. I was just listening to the
[35:35] message shalom this this morning as I
[35:37] was looking at the walking into towards
[35:39] the sunrise there at brother Nathaniel's
[35:41] house and uh just in that quote of of
[35:44] the prophet speaking on seeing the the
[35:47] change in the symphony and you have to
[35:48] recognize the hour that you're in you
[35:51] know and I didn't realize that the name
[35:52] of the tabernacle but here we are
[35:54] tonight so God is in all these little
[35:56] things amen they may seem little to us
[35:58] but really they're great things because
[36:00] like he said we have to understand the
[36:01] junction time and you have understand
[36:04] the symphony. And when you know when
[36:05] you're the composer or you have the mind
[36:07] of the composer, then you can anticipate
[36:09] what's coming next. Amen. And we know
[36:11] that we're at a junction in time. We
[36:13] know that we are seeing the changes in
[36:16] the beat. Amen. And that we understand
[36:18] that there's something coming. Amen.
[36:20] That's that great shalom that's breaking
[36:22] across that horizontal line. It's
[36:24] breaking from time into eternity. And
[36:27] one of these days, we're going to break
[36:28] across it. Amen. It's this life is not
[36:30] all it is. Amen. It's not about just
[36:33] going to work and having your family and
[36:35] doing the best that you can do and
[36:37] making enough money to get by and and
[36:39] then coming to church, you know, with a
[36:41] long face and trying to get happy again.
[36:43] Amen. It's something bigger than that.
[36:45] Amen. We're here for an eternal purpose
[36:47] and we just came from eternity and we're
[36:49] going back to eternity. Amen. And that
[36:51] three-fold purpose of the prophet that
[36:53] he told us we came he the desire of God
[36:56] to have a family. He had attributes in
[36:58] the back of his mind. Amen. and he just
[37:00] expressed them into time. He came and
[37:02] redeemed them and he's taken them back
[37:04] with him.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful to be one of them.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm from Vancouver, BC, Canada. I
[37:10] I go to church on the Seattle side near
[37:12] Seattle. My wife is here with me,
[37:14] Joanne. And uh we're just privileged to
[37:16] be with you all and to be able to join
[37:18] our lick of fire with yours. Amen.
[37:20] Because I believe that's uh truly the
[37:22] the age is getting dark. It's getting
[37:24] gross darkness upon the people. But I
[37:26] believe that there is a bride in the
[37:28] land. Amen. There's still a bride in
[37:29] Tucson. Maybe the prophet said it's a
[37:31] dry place spiritually, but there's a
[37:33] there's a well of water right here, my
[37:34] brother. And you're feeding, you're
[37:36] drinking from that water. Amen. And uh
[37:39] you can let all the the prickles out.
[37:40] You know, the prophet said that dryness
[37:42] can make you prickly and all these
[37:43] things, but under the rain of that
[37:45] water, Amen. we become so full of leaves
[37:48] of fellowship and love. And I'm so
[37:50] thankful to see you all today and to be
[37:52] a part of uh this, you know, just to
[37:55] stand behind the sacred desk that's been
[37:57] dedicated to God's service and to meet
[37:59] my precious brother and it's been uh
[38:01] just a privilege and I'm thankful to
[38:03] spend time with the Brett family. It's
[38:05] been a I was telling them this morning,
[38:06] it's just been a a reprieve for me, you
[38:09] know, on the back back side of the
[38:11] desert. And uh but that's where God
[38:14] molds the great men of God into his
[38:16] service. Amen. And women of God. So
[38:18] maybe we'll just stand to just have a a
[38:20] quick reading as we just say a few
[38:22] things as we turn the service back to
[38:24] the pastor. And I would just um I would
[38:28] just like to read out of uh Galatians
[38:31] chapter 4.
[38:37] And uh I believe that
[38:39] having received this great messenger, I
[38:41] mean that we that we have here, it's a
[38:44] time that uh we recognize that he's gone
[38:47] been gone for 60 years. Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; And uh we're in the seventh decade. How
[38:51] many understands that? And these are all
[38:54] symbols in in in in the prophet's me
[38:57] ministry that he gave us. And uh it's
[39:00] not just time going on and on and on and
[39:02] on. You know, sometimes it feels that
[39:03] way, but we're not just going on and on.
[39:05] No, there's a there's an appointed
[39:07] season for the bride to enter into her
[39:10] position and into her place and into her
[39:13] adopted position in Christ. Amen. How
[39:16] many believes in adoption here?
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who who's looking to uh enter into
[39:20] the ultimate ultimate adoption once and
[39:22] for all?
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And that's the body change. Amen. And
[39:26] but before that body change, we have to
[39:28] be already raptured in our souls. Is
[39:29] that right? Because we can't just be
[39:31] living here as as as human beings with
[39:34] no expectation. No, we have to have that
[39:37] expectation alive. And that Holy Spirit
[39:39] has to be in the inside quickening us
[39:41] and bringing us into that place of full
[39:43] adoption. Amen. Let's just read here as
[39:46] we just take a few minutes and we'll get
[39:47] you on your on your seats or you can
[39:49] stand. It's up to you. And uh let me
[39:51] just read in chapter 4.
[39:54] Um sorry here. Let me just uh find
[39:57] exactly.
[39:59] I'll read from uh verse four.
[40:02] But when the fullness of the time was
[40:05] come, God sent forth his son made of a
[40:08] woman made under the law to redeem that
[40:11] were them that were under the law that
[40:14] we might receive the adoption of sons.
[40:17] How many believe that we're at the
[40:18] fullness of time? I believe it.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's come.
[40:23] And it says, "Because verse six, and
[40:25] because ye are sons, God hath sent forth
[40:28] the spirit of his son into your hearts,
[40:31] crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art
[40:34] no more a servant, but a son, and if a
[40:36] son, than an heir of God through Christ.
[40:40] How be it then, when you knew not
[40:43] God, ye did service unto them which by
[40:45] nature are no gods. But now, after that
[40:48] ye have known God, or rather are known
[40:51] of God, how turn ye again to the weak
[40:54] and beggarly elements, where unto you,
[40:57] where unto ye desire again to be in
[41:00] bondage. You can have your seats.
[41:03] And I I just my thought here is just
[41:06] just for a few minutes. Not going to
[41:07] take up the pastor's time. I know he uh
[41:10] has something for you tonight, but I
[41:12] just want to just express, you know, the
[41:14] the heart the burden of my heart just a
[41:16] little bit to you and to introduce
[41:18] myself to you and and just thankful that
[41:20] to be here with you all. And uh to me
[41:22] the the the the subject of adoption. Uh
[41:26] it's it's the ultimate climax really of
[41:29] the ministry of the son, every son and
[41:30] daughter of God. whether we're just uh
[41:33] you know going through our life and as a
[41:35] Christian and looking for that final uh
[41:38] ascension into eternity. Uh but the
[41:40] adoption is really what is is the
[41:43] prophet Paul is showing here that the
[41:45] adoption of sons or daughters is the
[41:48] placing of you in authority in your
[41:51] position. You're already born a son or a
[41:53] daughter. That doesn't change your
[41:56] identity. It was from eternity. But
[41:58] there's a time when you have to come
[41:59] into your placing as that son and
[42:02] daughter. The place where you start to
[42:04] have the authority because the ma your
[42:07] father has now confidence that your
[42:10] actions are going to be in accordance
[42:11] with his will. Amen.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And there's a time and a season when you
[42:16] come into that position, that placing of
[42:18] of a son and daughter that you now prove
[42:21] that his confidence is in you and your
[42:24] actions and your life and your behavior
[42:27] is comely to the Holy Spirit. You know,
[42:30] there's a times where you're you're
[42:31] you're walking and you're stumbling
[42:33] along like your a prophet, he said how
[42:35] that you know, uh when I was a child, I
[42:38] you know, spake as a child and I did
[42:40] childish things. you know, he's so glad
[42:41] that he was coming into his his 50 uh or
[42:45] his third decade or third uh 25 years.
[42:48] He said as he was reaching that 50-year
[42:50] mark and somewhere around there, he was
[42:51] saying how much better it was because he
[42:54] wasn't jumping at snakes like it was. He
[42:56] wasn't trying to, you know, uh figure
[42:58] things out as much anymore, but he could
[43:00] just walk calmly with confidence knowing
[43:03] his position. And he said like an
[43:05] athlete they will maybe uh say sorry a
[43:08] child will stumble down this aisle here
[43:10] and they'll be trying to find their way
[43:12] you know but an athlete he said will
[43:14] just walk from here to the back and they
[43:16] won't even sweat you know won't even
[43:18] think about it you know because they
[43:19] know how to do it right but a child is
[43:22] stumbling along they're trying to find
[43:23] their way they're finding their feet so
[43:25] to speak right but when you become a
[43:27] full-g grown man when you become in your
[43:30] position as an adopted son you are not
[43:33] struggling ling any longer. It's not a
[43:35] struggle to serve God. No, it's a
[43:37] pleasure. You do it from your heart.
[43:39] It's out of a love relationship.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; You know how many like a prophet said,
[43:43] if if he was going on a trip somewhere,
[43:46] you know, and he told his wife, "Now,
[43:47] Mrs. Brandom, how dare you? Uh don't you
[43:50] ever look at another man? Don't you even
[43:52] think about it. Uh if you if I find out
[43:54] that you done it, you're you're going to
[43:56] be a divorced woman when when you get
[43:58] home." He said, "What kind of a
[43:59] household would that make?" Right? But
[44:01] when you serve God out of the love of
[44:03] God in your heart, it's a love
[44:05] relationship. And everything that the
[44:08] dos and the don'ts of legalism in the
[44:10] message will tell you to do, you do it
[44:13] out of love. Those same things, you wear
[44:15] the long skirts, you wear the right
[44:17] clothes, you behave yourself calmly, you
[44:19] act up accordingly, and you do it
[44:21] whether no one's looking or whether
[44:22] someone's looking because you know he's
[44:24] looking and he's the one that you're
[44:26] answering to. Amen. And you do it from a
[44:29] love relationship to him because you
[44:31] love him and he's your husband. He's
[44:33] your bridegroom and the relationship
[44:35] that you're in brings out the life.
[44:38] Amen.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And so that's what adoption is. Adoption
[44:42] is the is going going beyond the
[44:44] salvation stage. It's going beyond the
[44:46] justification stage. It's going beyond
[44:49] the sanctification stage. But there's
[44:51] something that we must attain unto. The
[44:54] prophet said you can have enough of the
[44:55] Holy Ghost that will keep you a moral
[44:56] Christian.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; It will keep you good enough going to
[44:59] church doing the right thing. But you
[45:01] know those people are going right into
[45:02] the tribulation. Some of them people
[45:04] good people wonderful people that love
[45:06] God and that are serving him day in day
[45:09] out and they can brother says they can
[45:11] do a lot of works. They're like a good
[45:12] mule you know they work work work work
[45:15] right and they're doing so many things
[45:17] for the for the church for the pastor
[45:19] you know for the for the music for the
[45:21] you know whatever. But there's something
[45:24] more than that that we have to come
[45:25] into. It's not the works that you can
[45:27] do, but it's the life that you're living
[45:30] that you don't live, but it's the life
[45:32] of God living through you.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's what adoption is, saints. And
[45:36] that's what my This has just been my own
[45:38] personal journey, my revelation. You
[45:40] know, you you start to realize that
[45:41] there's something more than just a
[45:43] church life.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; You know, you get tired of church and
[45:45] religion. How many is a little tired of
[45:47] church and religion? And I don't mean
[45:49] this building and the wonderful
[45:50] atmosphere that you have, but I mean
[45:52] just the the form that we can we can
[45:55] start to enter into because we want to
[45:57] find a way to serve God. I mean, when
[45:59] you think of a cathedral, have ever seen
[46:01] a big cathedral? I mean, I've traveled
[46:02] around the world. I've seen some of
[46:03] these cathedrals that they have like the
[46:05] one in London, St. Paul's, and so forth.
[46:08] And you walk into them and you sense you
[46:10] just you feel this feeling, you know,
[46:12] because it's so massive and so high up
[46:15] there. It's probably 300 feet to the top
[46:16] of the dome. and you feel like as tall
[46:18] as an ant, you know, and that aw struck
[46:21] feeling that that you get, you think
[46:23] people misin misinterpret that for the
[46:26] presence of God. It's not the presence
[46:28] of God. It's just making you feel
[46:29] insignificant, right? It's trying to put
[46:31] God way up somewhere above you and you
[46:33] down way here down below, you know? But
[46:36] that God, this message has done has come
[46:38] to do the exact exact opposite.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; It's to come and take this pillar of
[46:42] fire right here
[46:43] &gt;&gt; and not leave him up here, but to bring
[46:45] him right here. Amen, brother.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; We don't want to leave him up there.
[46:48] That's good for 1950. But that life is
[46:51] now to come indwell in us
[46:53] &gt;&gt; to walk in you and I.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that when you come to us to
[46:58] someone that is in need, you can lay
[47:00] hands on them and you can see them
[47:01] delivered
[47:02] &gt;&gt; because of your faith. Amen.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; You can lay hands. You don't even have
[47:06] to pray. How many knows that the the
[47:08] shadow of Peter
[47:10] &gt;&gt; brought healing?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; The very shadow. And and then we're
[47:14] worried about if someone if we pray for
[47:16] them, if they're going to get healed.
[47:17] Come on. You know, let's start to have
[47:19] confidence in who we are as sons and
[47:21] daughters of God. Amen. We don't need a
[47:23] prophet to return.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't need no return
[47:26] ministry. I'll tell you where the return
[47:28] ministry is. It's sitting right here
[47:29] today
[47:30] &gt;&gt; because that same Holy Spirit has come
[47:32] back in a multi-membered body called the
[47:35] bride of Jesus Christ. And that is the
[47:37] return ministry that I'm a part of and
[47:39] you are a part of because it's the same
[47:41] God in his bride form. I will ride this
[47:45] trail again. He's riding it in you and
[47:48] I.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; That's what the riding is. Amen.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; He said one place he says, I'll ride
[47:52] this trail trail trail again. And then
[47:54] another place says we'll ride this trail
[47:56] again. Because he's putting you and I
[47:58] into the picture. Amen. He's not
[48:00] leaving. We're not being left on the
[48:01] outer court. But it's time to go into
[48:03] the Holy of Holies. I don't want to
[48:05] stand in the outer court where the rain
[48:07] comes and the darkness comes and the
[48:08] heat comes, you know, and the sacrifices
[48:11] and the smoke and everything and then
[48:13] going into the holy place where the
[48:15] where it gets smoky from the the the
[48:17] candlesticks and the clapping of the
[48:18] priest's hands. No, I want to go beyond
[48:20] that. Amen. There's something in the
[48:22] shakina glory that we want to enter into
[48:25] &gt;&gt; because it's in the shakina presence of
[48:27] God that the but that Aaron's rod budded
[48:32] &gt;&gt; overnight. It didn't need seven months
[48:35] to grow blossoms, you know. It didn't
[48:37] need a season to go by, but the very
[48:39] life of God brought forth that budding
[48:43] because it was the very creative power
[48:45] of God. The anointing, the super
[48:47] anointing. Amen. Who, how, how many
[48:49] wants a taste of that super anointing
[48:50] tonight? Do you want to put it off to
[48:52] tomorrow or do you want it right here
[48:53] tonight? The same God that was with the
[48:56] prophet is here today, saints. I don't
[48:58] want to put him in history. Not se not
[49:00] 60 years after he's come and gone. No,
[49:02] there must be a people on the land that
[49:04] know their God and are doing those
[49:06] exploits because that's the people that
[49:08] is going in the rapture. It's not those
[49:10] that hear it. It says where unto you
[49:12] desire again to be in bondage. What is
[49:14] bondage? It's legalism. It's the law
[49:17] only with no grace with not the balance
[49:19] in the middle of the road. Not to know
[49:21] your position as a called son, bornagain
[49:25] son and daughter of God. When you're
[49:27] standing in your position, then you know
[49:29] that the life of God in me is the life
[49:31] of God in my brother and sister. And
[49:33] that we have we've been placed on this
[49:35] earth to finish the work in
[49:37] righteousness. Amen. It's not been 60
[49:39] years of the book of Judges. No, I
[49:41] refuse to believe that. I believe it's
[49:43] been 60 years of the book of Acts. Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Because maybe you don't know. Maybe you
[49:48] don't know exactly what's going on
[49:50] everywhere in the world. But God is
[49:51] doing things. Amen. And I had believe
[49:53] he's doing it here in this little
[49:55] assembly today. That supernatural power
[49:58] of the living God making you a living
[50:01] tabernacle of the living God's dwelling
[50:03] place.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; What do you want to be a powerhouse for
[50:06] God? Amen. How many wants to be a
[50:07] powerhouse for God?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be a a church pew warmer
[50:10] anymore.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Take I don't want that. Forget that. You
[50:14] know, let's let's be a real powerhouse
[50:15] for the living God
[50:17] &gt;&gt; to see the works of God in our life.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Religion kills, saints. Religion kills
[50:24] religion. We have we've had 2,000 years
[50:26] of religion, but the time has come for
[50:29] the bride to come out of her, my people.
[50:32] And let me believe you, the saint. The
[50:34] same the same darkness that was in the
[50:36] Catholic church. It is in the Catholic
[50:38] church. That's that same spirits have
[50:40] moved in the message realm. Or do you
[50:42] think Satan is standing outside and
[50:44] think, "Oh, there's they got a they got
[50:45] the pillar of fire up there. They got a
[50:47] they they believe in a prophet. I'm just
[50:49] going to stay on the outside. I can't go
[50:50] in there." No, he comes right down. He
[50:52] sits on pews, right? And he whispers in
[50:54] your ear. He's that's not good enough
[50:55] for you know you you're not good enough.
[50:58] You what did you do last night? You know
[51:00] what? Who do you think you are coming to
[51:02] church? What's your problem? Yeah, just
[51:03] just get out of here. You know, and
[51:04] causing all that whispering and all the
[51:07] the thoughts that that come in our mind
[51:09] and the greatest battle ever fought. But
[51:10] what do we got to do? We got to cast
[51:12] down reasoning. Amen. Cast down the
[51:14] accuser of the brethren. Revelation 12.
[51:17] Amen. Let's bring these things present
[51:19] tense. Let's not put it off in the
[51:21] future somewhere, but let's say, "No,
[51:23] Lord, that that same reality is my
[51:25] personal experience." And if you haven't
[51:27] experienced it, saints, this is for you
[51:29] tonight. The same God of the Bible is
[51:31] still here. He's still doing the same
[51:33] things. And if there's someone that that
[51:36] desires that supernatural reality in
[51:38] their life, that super anointing can
[51:40] come in every life. All you have to do
[51:42] is say, "Lord, beat unto me according to
[51:44] your word. Lord, fill me with that
[51:46] power. Fill me with make me a a
[51:48] powerhouse for God. Set me on fire with
[51:51] this reality of this message because
[51:53] this message is not creeds and dogma
[51:55] saints. This is not doctrine and
[51:57] correcting us where we had wrong baptism
[52:00] and all these things. That's that's
[52:01] that's true and that's all right. But
[52:02] there's something more. This the life
[52:05] has to move up into the past the shock,
[52:08] past the tassel and has to go into the
[52:11] grain. And what do we have to do? We
[52:13] have to lay in the presence of the sun
[52:15] to ripen, to come to full maturity.
[52:19] We can't be holding back any longer. No,
[52:21] the time has come to go up. And here we
[52:24] are 60 years later, you know, but God
[52:27] has still has a people in the land that
[52:29] know their God and are doing exploits.
[52:31] Amen. The reality of his presence is in
[52:35] is amongst us. Amen. And there's a
[52:39] little just I'll just close with this
[52:42] and turn it back to the pastor just with
[52:43] this little thought. I was just standing
[52:45] out there at brother Barrett's yard and
[52:47] we were having some fellowship and I
[52:49] just went out to just to read and pray a
[52:51] little bit and his son uh little um
[52:54] little Liam there had uh just been uh
[52:58] playing on his bike and he was finally
[53:00] got delivered from the training wheels.
[53:02] Amen. And uh he had those training
[53:05] wheels were so important to him, you
[53:07] know, uh for so many months. I'm not
[53:09] sure how long he must have been riding
[53:10] that bike, you know, and he's he
[53:12] couldn't stand he couldn't ride that
[53:13] bike without those training wheels, you
[53:15] know, and he was probably going back and
[53:17] forth and he was, you know, just so
[53:20] happy to have those wheels to keep him
[53:21] up, right? You know, and but there came
[53:23] one day, you know, he something must
[53:25] have come over him. He's like, you know
[53:26] what? I don't need those anymore. I I I
[53:29] can I can go on my own, you know. I can
[53:32] I can balance this bike, you know, and
[53:34] the all the coordination just started
[53:35] working in him and suddenly he just
[53:37] those training wheels just fell off and
[53:39] I was walking through the yard there and
[53:40] under a tree these two training wheels
[53:42] discarded, you know, but they were so
[53:44] important for so such a long time. But
[53:47] there came a time when he didn't need
[53:48] them anymore. Amen. And I believe that's
[53:50] what we are. Amen. We've had the
[53:52] training wheels, you know, of of of the
[53:54] support structure around us. But
[53:56] sometime there's a there come a time
[53:58] where we can move beyond that and we can
[54:00] enter into the reality. Amen. We can
[54:02] stand on our own two feet and walk into
[54:05] God's presence and know that he's going
[54:07] to answer your prayer. Amen. We don't
[54:09] need the training wheels any longer. Let
[54:11] them go. You know, they serve their
[54:13] purpose. But the time has come for us to
[54:15] walk hand in hand with God alone.
[54:18] Because saints, the rapture is not going
[54:20] to be a group experience. It's not a
[54:23] group experience. It's not a church
[54:24] identity. It's you and God alone.
[54:28] When you walk with God, you have to walk
[54:30] alone. It's not a group experience. You
[54:33] can your pastor can hold your hand for
[54:35] so long, but there comes a time when you
[54:37] have to let go and you have to take on
[54:39] his hand and he has to walk and you have
[54:41] to walk across with him. And I believe
[54:43] we're come down to the wire. There's
[54:45] things that are happening around the
[54:47] world. The modern events are being made
[54:50] clear by vindicated prophecy saints.
[54:53] And there's there's a great junction
[54:55] that we're coming into. And I pray that
[54:57] we'll pray for revelation of this hour
[55:00] because God is still revealing himself
[55:03] to his bride.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; He hasn't stopped that. He's not the God
[55:06] of history. He's the God of the present
[55:08] tense reality. Amen. And I'll just close
[55:12] with one scripture, the next book here
[55:14] in Ephesians,
[55:17] Ephesians chapter 1.
[55:22] And we know that this is the Joshua of
[55:24] the New Testament. Amen. He says
[55:29] verse four, "According as he hath chosen
[55:31] us in him before the foundation of the
[55:35] world, that we should be holy and
[55:37] without blame before him in love, having
[55:40] predestinated
[55:41] us unto the adoption of children by
[55:46] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[55:49] good pleasure of his will, to the praise
[55:52] of the glory of his grace, wherein he
[55:55] hath made us accepted in the beloved. I
[55:58] mean, I could keep going on and on.
[56:00] Where do you stop sometimes? You know, I
[56:01] feel that way with the scripture. You
[56:02] just want to keep going and going, but
[56:04] it's when this word becomes a reality to
[56:07] you. You know that you've been
[56:08] predestinated. You know, that's a big
[56:10] word for us like the prophet said. But
[56:12] that predestination, saints, that shows
[56:14] that there's nothing that can stop you
[56:17] going back into the mind of Christ. You
[56:19] came from his mind and you're going back
[56:20] into him.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; That's the promise that we've been
[56:23] given. And that is the adoption of sons.
[56:26] We recognize God sent a prophet and that
[56:28] life is now come into a bride. And that
[56:32] bride is going to meet her bridegroom.
[56:34] He was not the one. Amen. He is the
[56:36] messenger to connect us to the
[56:38] bridegroom. You know, we don't want to
[56:39] stop at the messenger. We want to
[56:41] recognize no. God sent a prophet to
[56:43] connect us to him.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And outside of him, he cannot meet the
[56:47] bridegroom. Without without meeting the
[56:50] bride, the the Eleazar, Rebecca could
[56:52] not go to meet Isaac. She had to have
[56:54] her eleer and there was no outside of
[56:57] the midnight cry.
[56:59] There's no going in to the bridegroom
[57:02] chamber. And I let me let me tell you
[57:05] one last thought as we close. The
[57:07] foolish virgin and the wise virgin, they
[57:08] both heard the midnight cry. But it was
[57:11] the wise virgin that maintained the oil
[57:13] with their vessels.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Because they had the vessels to top up
[57:17] their lamps, to trim those lamps. Amen.
[57:20] and then they could enter into the
[57:22] bridegroom. But while they were
[57:24] trimming, while they were topping up,
[57:26] they there's others that found. They had
[57:28] oil in the lamps. Don't get me wrong,
[57:30] they had oil, right? They had wicks,
[57:32] they had fire, they had it all. But
[57:35] there came a time, well, maybe God let
[57:37] 60 years go by. Maybe let people dry out
[57:40] a little bit, you know, get caught up
[57:42] with the cares of life a little too
[57:44] much, you know, but there came a time
[57:47] when they had realized they went dry.
[57:50] and they had to go and buy dry and bride
[57:52] and need to buy. But there was a people
[57:55] that were going in at the same time. And
[57:57] in that little season between the
[57:58] midnight cry and the entering in, that's
[58:01] where we are tonight. If you can
[58:02] recognize it, we've heard the midnight
[58:04] cry and now we're in that little season
[58:06] where we're walking into the
[58:08] bridegroom's chamber. Let our hearts and
[58:10] our minds be trimmed tonight. Amen. And
[58:13] full of that oil. How many wants a
[58:15] refilling of the Holy Ghost tonight?
[58:16] Let's just stand to your feet. Amen. And
[58:18] maybe we'll just just pray in our hearts
[58:21] as we turn the service back to our
[58:22] pastor. Just say, "Lord, I've had church
[58:26] and I've had religion." You know, and
[58:28] I'm talking about this church in this
[58:29] building. No, I'm talking about religion
[58:31] in your heart. You've done you've worked
[58:34] and you've done things because you just
[58:36] know that's the right thing to do. You
[58:38] know, you've gone to church because,
[58:39] well, you know, my parents took me to
[58:41] church all my life, you know, and they
[58:43] they believe that, you know, this is the
[58:45] right thing for me to do.
[58:46] Well, I I'm only here because somebody
[58:48] told me to come or, you know, I'm here
[58:50] because I love my pastor, you know, or
[58:52] I'm here because, you know, uh that girl
[58:54] is real cute and I I like her or that
[58:57] boy or, you know, and you had you have
[58:59] all your reasons and you bring it down
[59:01] to religion. It's all religion. But you
[59:04] know what? That's not going to go into
[59:05] the bridegroom chamber. That's going to
[59:07] be left on the outside. But how many
[59:10] wants to go in tonight? Amen. How many
[59:12] wants to go into the holy of holies, the
[59:14] shakina glory? How many wants to enter
[59:17] into adoption tonight? How many wants to
[59:19] be a powerhouse for the living God? How
[59:22] many wants to know that that pillar of
[59:24] fire is in me, is in you? The 120 on the
[59:28] upper room, they weren't all looking at
[59:29] Peter with his nice big pillar of fire
[59:31] and wondering where theirs were. No,
[59:33] every single one. every little
[59:34] insignificant member up there that
[59:36] wasn't an apostle that weren't there at
[59:38] the at the resurrection. Each one of
[59:40] those had a pillar of fire that didn't
[59:42] stay over their head because when they
[59:44] came out of that room were there was a
[59:45] pillar of fires over their head
[59:46] everywhere. No, the pillar of fire was
[59:48] seen over their head and it went inside
[59:49] of them and they became powerhouses of
[59:52] li of the living God. They became the
[59:55] very tabernacles of the living God's
[59:57] dwelling place. And as we bow our heads
[1:00:00] and lift our hearts to him, heavenly
[1:00:02] father, Lord, I pray that you will make
[1:00:04] us all powerhouses for your service,
[1:00:06] Lord. Lord, as we see the the great
[1:00:10] closing of the of time, Father, we see
[1:00:12] gross darkness upon the people, but
[1:00:14] Lord, there's a revival of the just, oh
[1:00:17] God, there is a bride's revival, Father.
[1:00:19] And I believe there's a people here
[1:00:21] today in Shalom Tabernacle in Tucson,
[1:00:23] Arizona, Father. A place that your
[1:00:25] prophet identified so clearly, Lord, and
[1:00:28] that you sent them here for a purpose,
[1:00:30] oh God. And I believe there's still a
[1:00:32] people here, oh God, that have heard
[1:00:34] that midnight cry. And Lord, I believe
[1:00:36] that there's a people that have a
[1:00:37] groaning in their hearts. Oh God, that
[1:00:39] to be caught up in that cloud, Lord, not
[1:00:41] just to hear a song, but to walk into
[1:00:43] the reality of that in their personal
[1:00:45] lives, oh God, that we will become
[1:00:48] tabernacles of the living God's dwelling
[1:00:50] place. adoptions, adopted sons, not
[1:00:52] going back into the bondage of of church
[1:00:55] and religion, oh God, and become and
[1:00:57] staying pew warmers, Lord, but let us
[1:01:00] walk into that reality, Father. Lord,
[1:01:02] where we become, oh God, a a new book of
[1:01:05] Acts, Lord, that that life in that's
[1:01:07] that was in your prophet is still in us,
[1:01:09] oh God, is in us in a in a measure,
[1:01:12] Father. And Lord, we're looking for that
[1:01:14] dynamics, Lord, as he said in there, in
[1:01:16] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[1:01:18] We've worked with that dynamics in a
[1:01:19] measure while the headstone is uniting
[1:01:21] with the body. But oh God, may that
[1:01:23] headstone united with these tabernacles,
[1:01:26] these pyramids, oh God, to make us that
[1:01:29] full powerhouse of the dynamics, Lord,
[1:01:31] that dynamo as your prophet called it,
[1:01:33] Lord. Oh, Father, grant it for the
[1:01:35] Shalom Tabernacle, for each and every
[1:01:37] one, Lord, for myself, Lord. You know,
[1:01:38] my hands are raised, Lord God. We all
[1:01:41] desire refilling of your Holy Spirit. We
[1:01:43] love you, oh God. And we're so thankful,
[1:01:45] Lord, that you are still here, oh God.
[1:01:48] That you are still working and moving on
[1:01:50] hearts tonight, Lord. And I know that
[1:01:52] there's someone here tonight that this
[1:01:54] was for, Father. And I believe your Holy
[1:01:56] Spirit will go after each and everyone
[1:01:58] that it is, Lord, and touch their hearts
[1:02:00] today, oh God, and move in everyone
[1:02:02] life, Lord. And those that have the Holy
[1:02:04] Ghost, we just want a refilling, oh God.
[1:02:07] There's never too too much that of you
[1:02:09] can have that we can have, Lord. But we
[1:02:11] just want to be a fountain, Lord, that's
[1:02:12] just bubbling up, oh God, unstoppable,
[1:02:15] Father, that there's nothing, oh God,
[1:02:17] that can plug it, Lord. There's no
[1:02:20] amount of snow. There's no amount of
[1:02:22] ice. There's no amount of coldness, so
[1:02:23] there's no amount of sickness, oh God.
[1:02:26] There's nothing that can stop that
[1:02:27] fountain, Lord, because it's a bubbling
[1:02:29] fountain, Lord. And it doesn't freeze
[1:02:31] over. It doesn't it's not stopped by the
[1:02:33] climate, oh God. And I'm so thankful for
[1:02:36] for that promise, Lord, to make us those
[1:02:38] fountains, oh Lord. So grant it today,
[1:02:40] Lord. And I thank you for this little
[1:02:42] group, Lord. Bless them, I pray, in a
[1:02:44] special way. We're thankful that we were
[1:02:46] able to drop by and just encourage them
[1:02:49] and encourage myself as well, Lord, to
[1:02:51] see a people here, Lord, that are
[1:02:53] pressing on. So bless them. I pray,
[1:02:55] Lord. I ask a special blessing on them.
[1:02:57] And may you break out a revival in this
[1:02:59] place, oh God, that they've never even
[1:03:01] seen us yet, Lord. Oh God, because you
[1:03:03] are there's always more of you to have.
[1:03:05] And I believe we've never had enough
[1:03:07] yet, Lord. But one of these days, oh
[1:03:09] God, we're going to be so full that
[1:03:10] we'll have to leave this dimension.
[1:03:12] Lord, we just change dimensions, Father,
[1:03:15] by that quickening power, oh Lord,
[1:03:17] that's coming on us, oh Father. Granted,
[1:03:19] I pray. We give you the praise and the
[1:03:22] glory. We thank you. We love you for all
[1:03:24] that you've done and what you're doing
[1:03:26] in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. God
[1:03:29] bless you, saints. I just wanted to just
[1:03:32] give a few words just to tell you that
[1:03:33] we love you and we thank you. We don't
[1:03:34] know you personally, but one day we
[1:03:36] will. Amen. On the other side, we have a
[1:03:39] a table 100 miles long or 3,000 or how
[1:03:42] many we it is. And we'll be there for
[1:03:44] eternity. Amen. Just let's make sure
[1:03:46] we're there. That's the main thing,
[1:03:47] right? And on that day, we'll have all
[1:03:49] the time to talk and to connect and to
[1:03:52] love each other. Amen. God bless you.
[1:03:54] Thank you. Amen.
[1:04:05] Thank you. You can take your seats,
[1:04:07] musicians. God bless you. Sorry. God
[1:04:10] bless each of you saints. So good to be
[1:04:12] in the house of the Lord with you. And
[1:04:14] thank you for our brother and his wife
[1:04:16] and family and sharing those good things
[1:04:19] with us. And uh I'd like to take a a
[1:04:22] scripture found in the New Testament
[1:04:26] just before we go to prayer. And it's
[1:04:28] been something
[1:04:30] on my mind just a little bit and it's in
[1:04:34] Acts chapter 19.
[1:04:39] I believe it falls right in line with
[1:04:41] some of the things our brother was
[1:04:43] saying about the adoption
[1:04:47] and it's by the spirit that we are
[1:04:49] adopted. But we had a Sunday school
[1:04:54] lesson that we've been going through the
[1:04:56] series. What is the Holy Ghost? What was
[1:04:58] it given for?
[1:05:00] And um
[1:05:05] Paul asked a question here
[1:05:08] that I sense just in the few years I've
[1:05:12] been around the message in many
[1:05:15] different church groups.
[1:05:18] You know, to ask this question, have you
[1:05:21] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:05:22] believed? It really it kind of puts it
[1:05:26] right into your face. And this is what
[1:05:27] Paul does in Acts 19 verse1. And it came
[1:05:30] to pass that while Apollos was at
[1:05:33] Corinth, Paul having passed through the
[1:05:36] upper coast came to Ephesus and finding
[1:05:39] certain disciples, he said unto them,
[1:05:42] "Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:05:44] ye believed?" And they said unto him,
[1:05:48] "We have not so much as heard whether
[1:05:50] there be any Holy Ghost." And he said
[1:05:53] unto them, "Unto, what then were you
[1:05:54] baptized?" And they said unto John's
[1:05:57] baptism. Then said Paul, John verely
[1:06:00] baptized with the baptism of repentance,
[1:06:02] saying unto the people that they should
[1:06:05] believe on him which should come after
[1:06:06] him, that is on Christ Jesus. When they
[1:06:09] heard this, they were baptized in the
[1:06:12] name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:06:15] And when Paul had laid his hands upon
[1:06:17] them, the Holy Ghost came on them and
[1:06:21] they spake with tongues and prophesied.
[1:06:24] And all the men were about 12. Let's
[1:06:27] take one more scripture in Acts chapter
[1:06:29] 1.
[1:06:36] The book of Acts was written by Luke.
[1:06:40] And if you take St. Luke
[1:06:43] um chapter 24
[1:06:46] and you just end that and go right into
[1:06:49] Acts, you'll see how they just flow cuz
[1:06:52] he starts about the former trustees.
[1:06:55] He's talking about his gospel that he
[1:06:57] wrote, O Theopilolis, and he's reading
[1:07:01] these things of what the Lord had done.
[1:07:04] He's kind of leaving off where uh the
[1:07:07] disciples were st standing there and
[1:07:10] Jesus was taken up into heaven before
[1:07:13] them. And I'll take verse number six.
[1:07:17] And when they therefore were come
[1:07:18] together, they asked of him, saying,
[1:07:21] Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
[1:07:25] again the kingdom to Israel?
[1:07:28] And he said unto them, "It is not for
[1:07:30] you to know the times or the seasons
[1:07:34] which the Father hath put in his own
[1:07:36] power, but ye shall receive power after
[1:07:40] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you,
[1:07:42] and ye shall be my witnesses unto me
[1:07:46] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and
[1:07:49] in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts
[1:07:53] of the earth." Amen. Let us pray. Lord
[1:07:57] Jesus, we ask you to bless your word,
[1:07:59] this portion of the word. We pray in
[1:08:02] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You may
[1:08:05] be seated. You know, every service is
[1:08:08] unique, isn't it?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; What's going to happen next?
[1:08:13] We don't know, do we?
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; But if it's the Holy Spirit, we want it,
[1:08:17] don't we?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; And we don't even know what tomorrow
[1:08:20] holds for us. We say it's Thursday,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; but Thursday could mean the last day for
[1:08:27] a lot of things and the way things
[1:08:29] change and news and the way they happen.
[1:08:32] And so we just want to embrace whatever
[1:08:34] the Lord has for us. As I was thinking
[1:08:37] about this little message here, um the
[1:08:40] Sunday school, what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:08:42] What was it given for? And I went back
[1:08:44] through it and as a class, Sunday
[1:08:47] school, adult Sunday school class, we
[1:08:49] have listened to 20 minute segments. And
[1:08:52] I think that was about six or seven,
[1:08:55] maybe more segments of listening to the
[1:08:58] prophet. What was the Holy Ghost given
[1:09:01] for?
[1:09:03] First it was, what is the Holy Ghost?
[1:09:04] What was it given for? And when he
[1:09:07] preached, so we like to greet our
[1:09:08] visitors. you find saints and the other
[1:09:11] visitors brother in the back there. Yes.
[1:09:14] Appreciate your singing each of you. So
[1:09:17] as we um would look at that and move
[1:09:20] forward with it, you know, it it it
[1:09:23] seems like and I've seen this amongst
[1:09:26] many of the churches, at least the ones
[1:09:28] I'm affiliated with, that there is a
[1:09:31] general sense of
[1:09:35] some of us don't know when we receive
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:39] And I really believe that in order for
[1:09:42] you to have faith in what you're doing,
[1:09:45] as our brother was speaking about
[1:09:47] adoption,
[1:09:49] do we even know we've received the Holy
[1:09:51] Ghost?
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And I don't believe we should be
[1:09:53] questioning that. So my own personal
[1:09:56] testimony, I was over two years
[1:10:00] tering, what we call tarrying for the
[1:10:03] Holy Ghost. I was begging the Lord,
[1:10:06] brother Luke, to let me speak in
[1:10:08] tongues. I did that in the Pentecostal
[1:10:11] church. I went to different prayer
[1:10:13] meetings where they were doing this
[1:10:15] because in the Pentecostal church, and
[1:10:17] one thing I do admire about them is that
[1:10:21] the Holy Ghost is an experience
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; and there is a day and a time when you
[1:10:27] receive that
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; and they make that very clear. And in
[1:10:32] fact, in our church,
[1:10:34] our pastor wanted me to receive it so he
[1:10:37] can use me in the church more because he
[1:10:39] did not I could not be using the church
[1:10:43] in a greater level until I received the
[1:10:45] Holy Ghost. Everybody in the church knew
[1:10:47] I didn't have it. I knew I didn't have
[1:10:49] it. So when the pastor asked for people
[1:10:52] to come up and pray to receive it, the
[1:10:56] people that didn't have it, it was no
[1:10:58] shame about it. There was no funny
[1:11:01] feeling about it. You got up out of your
[1:11:03] seat and you came to the altar seeking
[1:11:07] the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Now, is that wrong?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; We've made it wrong.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; We our atmosphere have made it wrong.
[1:11:18] And so we want to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:11:21] in our own little quiet way and have it
[1:11:25] happen some way or far away place and
[1:11:28] then you'll show up and then say, "Yeah,
[1:11:30] while I have the Holy Spirit." Well,
[1:11:32] it's a happening.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; It is something that happens.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; And when you take this message, which is
[1:11:39] beautiful, it's in December of 59, just
[1:11:42] before Christmas. And then right after
[1:11:44] that he goes into the adoption. And so
[1:11:48] let's take the intro in what is the Holy
[1:11:50] Ghost just for a few moments and then we
[1:11:52] can pray. All right. Now the prophet is
[1:11:55] just in the intro he says this here.
[1:12:01] Paragraph 6. Tonight I want to speak on
[1:12:03] the subject what is the Holy Ghost? And
[1:12:05] tomorrow night I want to preach on what
[1:12:07] was it given for? and on Friday night
[1:12:09] and to the recorders. I don't want this
[1:12:11] recorded Friday night. How do I get the
[1:12:14] Holy Ghost? How do I know when I have
[1:12:17] it? And then we will just let then see
[1:12:20] what the Lord will lead us for Saturday
[1:12:22] and Sunday, Sunday morning, the healing
[1:12:24] service.
[1:12:26] And he continues on to paragraph 8. You
[1:12:29] know, every church, if you don't have a
[1:12:32] doctrine, you're not a church. You've
[1:12:34] got to have something that you stand
[1:12:36] for, some principles that you're holding
[1:12:39] up. And regardless of what a person's
[1:12:43] affiliation or denomination might be, if
[1:12:46] that person is born of the spirit of
[1:12:48] God, that's my brother or my sister.
[1:12:52] Regardless, we might different in other
[1:12:55] things as far as east from the west, but
[1:13:00] we are still brothers.
[1:13:03] Look at your neighbor and say, "Brother,
[1:13:07] sister." That's what we are, brothers
[1:13:10] and sisters. And I would not do nothing
[1:13:13] but to try to help that brother for a
[1:13:17] closer, better walk to Christ, then I
[1:13:21] believe any real true Christian would do
[1:13:23] the same for me.
[1:13:27] Then he goes into what he wanted this
[1:13:30] meeting to be and what these series of
[1:13:32] services what he wanted them to be. And
[1:13:34] here's what he says in paragraph number
[1:13:37] 11.
[1:13:38] And I know I won't get through all of
[1:13:40] this. I'm just going to say a few things
[1:13:42] just because the intro before he even
[1:13:45] reads the scripture is very very
[1:13:48] powerful
[1:13:50] and it's something you should read and
[1:13:52] internalize
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; and really take it in as as how the
[1:13:56] prophet approached this series on the
[1:14:00] Holy Ghost. Now look at this. and to
[1:14:02] this little tabernacle seeing that I
[1:14:04] believe that it is one of the finest
[1:14:07] people that I believe that's on the
[1:14:09] earth goes to this tabernacle. I never
[1:14:12] said all the finest people. I said some
[1:14:14] of the finest people on the earth go to
[1:14:16] this tabernacle. But as day by day
[1:14:20] entering back from meeting to meeting, I
[1:14:22] see a great need of this tabernacle,
[1:14:25] a great need in it. And that's for a
[1:14:29] filling or a consecration,
[1:14:32] a deeper life, a closer walk with the
[1:14:36] with God.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And I've promised them to do this to
[1:14:39] have this meeting for them. and we're
[1:14:42] glad to bring you in and fellowship with
[1:14:45] us around the word of God as we teach
[1:14:48] and try to bring out
[1:14:50] paragraph 13. The other night around a
[1:14:53] little after midnight, the wife and I
[1:14:56] after setting up and praying and talking
[1:14:58] to the Lord across a little foottool in
[1:15:01] our own front room with two open Bibles,
[1:15:04] we consecrated ourselves a new to God
[1:15:10] for a complete service.
[1:15:13] Now husbands and wives, do you think
[1:15:16] that would be a good thing to do?
[1:15:18] Do you think the prophet was the
[1:15:20] prophet?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Do you think he had the Holy Ghost?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; You think he was a man of God?
[1:15:26] But here he is with his wife
[1:15:29] reconsecrating
[1:15:31] their life for a service to the Lord for
[1:15:36] a complete service that we would
[1:15:40] surrender our own wills and everything
[1:15:45] and every negative thought
[1:15:49] we're coming on upon every negative
[1:15:52] thought and to serve the Lord Jesus.
[1:15:55] And I trust that's been your attitude
[1:15:58] too, that you've done the same thing.
[1:16:02] Then when we're coming tonight, we're
[1:16:04] coming upon holy ground among a people
[1:16:08] who's been praying and fasting and
[1:16:12] making restitutions and getting ready to
[1:16:15] receive something from God. And I know
[1:16:18] that he that will come hungry will not
[1:16:20] go away hungry, but God will feed with
[1:16:24] the bread of life. So look at the
[1:16:27] approach. Look at that approach. So
[1:16:31] receiving the Holy Ghost, let me say
[1:16:33] this to you, my sister, my brother.
[1:16:35] Being raised in the church, as one of
[1:16:38] the ministers said the other night,
[1:16:41] being raised in the message in
[1:16:42] particular can be a liability for some
[1:16:46] because you don't have a starting point
[1:16:49] when you first saw the pillar of fire
[1:16:52] or heard um the serpent seat or whatever
[1:16:57] the message, what we call the message.
[1:16:59] And so it can be difficult to know
[1:17:02] exactly when that experience has taken
[1:17:06] place in your life. And especially if
[1:17:09] many of the churches have taken the
[1:17:12] position, if you believe the message,
[1:17:15] you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:18] And whether they say it, the action of
[1:17:21] it seems to be the prevailing sense
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; that I believe the message, therefore
[1:17:29] I'm okay. I believe the message. Who
[1:17:33] cares whether I had an experience in the
[1:17:35] Holy Ghost like a like a a a definite
[1:17:39] birth in the Holy Ghost. And the way the
[1:17:42] prophet teaches and the way the Bible
[1:17:44] teaches it, when they receive the word
[1:17:48] and they receive the Holy Ghost, it was
[1:17:50] something that happened.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And you need that.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It's a tide post.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's something you can go point back to.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Something happened.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; We must have that. Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; In fact, in one place, in one place,
[1:18:12] it's in the questions and answers,
[1:18:14] Brother Random was talking about a
[1:18:15] sister. He prayed that God would let her
[1:18:18] speak in tongues because she had the
[1:18:20] Holy Spirit, but she didn't have that.
[1:18:22] She didn't know. She didn't have that
[1:18:24] typos. He said, "So, I prayed that God
[1:18:26] would let her speak in tongues for her
[1:18:30] faith."
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; How many know that quote?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; How many's heard that quote? Yes, he
[1:18:34] said it. He said, "But if I taught it
[1:18:36] that way,
[1:18:38] Then everybody would try to receive by
[1:18:41] speaking in tonesues and then they think
[1:18:43] they have the Holy Ghost and they
[1:18:44] wouldn't have it.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Holy the speaking in tonesues is the
[1:18:48] least of the gifts.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And so this tidepost this knowing
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; this absolute assurance
[1:18:56] that you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] since you believed. I believe that's
[1:19:03] what the Lord wants. That's the faith
[1:19:05] you should walk into.
[1:19:07] I don't be I don't believe it's a casual
[1:19:10] happening. I believe that it should be a
[1:19:12] moment in time. Something happened
[1:19:17] and you know it. And so this approach
[1:19:21] was the tabernacle knew he was bringing
[1:19:23] this message. So they came fasting,
[1:19:28] praying,
[1:19:29] consecrating themselves for this
[1:19:33] outpouring of the Holy Ghost upon those
[1:19:36] that needed it.
[1:19:38] And um
[1:19:41] it's a definite difference
[1:19:44] when you've been baptized, if you
[1:19:46] accepted the Lord into your life. I if I
[1:19:49] don't get that message across to you or
[1:19:51] if this church hasn't got that message
[1:19:53] across to you, please I pray God will
[1:19:55] get that message across to you. You must
[1:19:59] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm preach I can preach on the the
[1:20:05] statue of a perfect man and I can bring
[1:20:07] out all the quotations on what's going
[1:20:10] to happen in the future home. And I can
[1:20:12] show you who the great angel was in
[1:20:14] Revelations 18. that great voice that
[1:20:17] called for us to come out of her. And I
[1:20:19] can show you all those deep things and
[1:20:20] all those wonderful things. Show you
[1:20:23] what happened right here in the mountain
[1:20:25] over here where the sword struck his
[1:20:28] hand.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Not just any sword, not anybody's sword,
[1:20:31] but the king sword. The king sword
[1:20:35] struck his hand. I can show you that.
[1:20:38] But if you haven't received the Holy
[1:20:40] Ghost,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; you can't walk with faith and assurance
[1:20:45] for your own Christian walk. Young
[1:20:49] people, old people, new people,
[1:20:51] old-timers, you must receive the Holy
[1:20:55] Ghost.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; That's my responsibility to put that
[1:21:02] forward to you. I believe when I listen
[1:21:04] to the tapes, brother Brandham is
[1:21:06] relieved from that responsibility to us.
[1:21:10] He made it clear to us. Coming to the
[1:21:13] Brandom Tabernacle didn't mean you had
[1:21:15] the Holy Ghost. Believing doesn't mean
[1:21:18] you have the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
[1:21:20] is an experience that has to happen to
[1:21:22] you.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now in this message he goes
[1:21:26] forward and he asks the question in
[1:21:32] he makes a statement in paragraph 22.
[1:21:35] I'm just going to take about 10 more
[1:21:36] minutes. Okay saints and then we'll
[1:21:38] pray.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 22. Upon this place we wish to
[1:21:42] approach the subject which I think is
[1:21:45] the outstanding subject of today of the
[1:21:49] what is the Holy Spirit? What is it? And
[1:21:54] now the reason I've taken this subject
[1:21:56] in line like this, you cannot come and
[1:22:00] receive the Holy Spirit unless you know
[1:22:03] what it is.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive it if you know
[1:22:09] what it is. Unless you believe it's
[1:22:11] given to you and it's for you. And then
[1:22:15] you cannot know whether you've got it or
[1:22:18] not unless you know what results it
[1:22:22] brings.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; So if you know what it is and who it is
[1:22:26] to who it's to and what action it brings
[1:22:29] when it comes then you'll know what
[1:22:31] you've got when you get it. See that's
[1:22:34] ju just would settle it. So for any of
[1:22:38] you hearts here, and I know it's a
[1:22:40] number of you here that are not sure and
[1:22:45] you have signs of the Holy Spirit in
[1:22:47] your life, justification,
[1:22:48] sanctification, and your love for the
[1:22:50] Lord and his word in measures and
[1:22:53] there's many signs that show that the
[1:22:56] Holy Spirit is in your life. But you
[1:22:59] can't definitely say that you have
[1:23:01] received the Holy Spirit. What I would
[1:23:03] like you to do is take this message and
[1:23:06] simply take the scriptures and there's
[1:23:10] many of them that the prophet brings
[1:23:13] because the scriptures tell us what it
[1:23:16] is.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And you can't receive it if you don't
[1:23:20] know what it is. And what it is isn't
[1:23:24] brother Israel's testimony or somebody
[1:23:26] else's testimony. is what the Bible said
[1:23:29] what it was
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and the promise that it was.
[1:23:34] And so many times those of us that are
[1:23:37] wanting to receive the Holy Spirit
[1:23:40] haven't even taken the scriptures to
[1:23:43] find out what the Holy Spirit is as a
[1:23:47] foundation
[1:23:48] to know what that promise is and then
[1:23:51] reading it and praying for it and then
[1:23:54] your expectations is set upon what the
[1:23:57] word of God said the Holy Spirit is.
[1:24:01] and then God by his grace can remove
[1:24:06] those questions from you.
[1:24:10] Now I said brother Jeff he says now now
[1:24:14] the reason I've taken this subject you
[1:24:16] cannot receive it unless you know what
[1:24:18] it is unless you believe it's given for
[1:24:19] you it's for you and then you cannot
[1:24:21] know whether you've got it or not unless
[1:24:24] you know what results is it brings. So
[1:24:26] if you know what it is and who it's to
[1:24:30] and what action it brings when it comes
[1:24:32] then you'll know what you've got when
[1:24:34] you get it. That just would settle it.
[1:24:38] Like I was talking to brother Jeff
[1:24:40] today. He said, "I'd like to be in the
[1:24:42] meeting tonight, but I'll be there
[1:24:44] tomorrow night." He didn't know the
[1:24:45] meeting was going on because he didn't
[1:24:46] announce it just right. Brother Leo and
[1:24:49] then wrote some of our friends and told
[1:24:51] them out of town. Well, now I said,
[1:24:54] "Brother Jeff, if you sent me down to
[1:24:57] turn on one of your oil wells and I
[1:24:59] didn't know nothing about it, I probably
[1:25:02] blow it up.
[1:25:04] I might turn the wrong key or start the
[1:25:06] wrong motor. I'd have to know how to do
[1:25:10] it before I did it. And that's the way
[1:25:14] with receiving the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:17] You've got to know what you're coming
[1:25:19] for and how to receive it and what it
[1:25:24] is.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:25:29] Then he asked this question. How many in
[1:25:31] here has not received the Holy Ghost?
[1:25:37] Been baptized with the Holy Ghost? Raise
[1:25:40] your hands.
[1:25:42] Just look at the hands. He says,
[1:25:46] "Now, if I were to ask that question to
[1:25:49] our church here, some might be offended
[1:25:52] by that question
[1:25:55] or feel the pressure by it, but that
[1:25:57] shouldn't make you feel any pressure.
[1:25:59] That's a real question. How many in here
[1:26:02] has not received the So he's asking his
[1:26:05] congregation just like Paul asked
[1:26:08] Apollos, have you received the Holy
[1:26:11] Ghost
[1:26:12] since you believed?
[1:26:15] This question
[1:26:17] has to be answered and only you can
[1:26:20] answer that. my brother and my sister.
[1:26:24] I believe if every one of us has
[1:26:27] received the Holy Ghost, it would solve
[1:26:31] pretty near or all of our problems as it
[1:26:35] pertains to our attitude in working with
[1:26:37] one another
[1:26:39] and our approach towards the message and
[1:26:43] our approach towards church and our
[1:26:46] approach towards immature believers and
[1:26:49] our approach towards people who talk
[1:26:51] against us and all the other little
[1:26:53] things that human beings do to one
[1:26:55] another. If we all have received the
[1:26:58] Holy Ghost,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; wouldn't this church be a better church?
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't I be a better minister?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Couldn't I be the best pastor if I had
[1:27:08] received the Holy Ghost or another fresh
[1:27:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; What do you say?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I love the way the prophet
[1:27:20] brings us and I'll stop here on page
[1:27:23] number seven
[1:27:25] verse 27 paragraph 27. There is a vast
[1:27:29] difference between just a Christian and
[1:27:33] a holy ghostfilled Christian. Now we're
[1:27:36] going to get this from the scripture and
[1:27:38] place it just exactly in the scripture.
[1:27:41] The first place there is a Christian
[1:27:44] profess to be a Christian. But if this
[1:27:46] Christian has not yet been filled with
[1:27:48] the Holy Ghost, he's only in process of
[1:27:53] being a Christian. See, he's profess to
[1:27:56] believe it. He's working uh to it, but
[1:28:00] God has not yet given him this spirit of
[1:28:03] the Holy Ghost. He's not yet reached
[1:28:06] that goal with God that God recognized
[1:28:10] it.
[1:28:13] Now,
[1:28:16] I believe that's where many of us are.
[1:28:19] Me, many of the saints in our little
[1:28:21] local assembly here are. Some of them
[1:28:24] are. I believe that. I believe many
[1:28:27] people that are honest will say that's
[1:28:28] where they are. Uh they haven't received
[1:28:32] the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:28:36] But is this a promise to you?
[1:28:40] And right at the end of this message,
[1:28:44] the closing scripture that brother Vanom
[1:28:46] takes for us is in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:28:50] 12. I was amazed because that's exactly
[1:28:53] where we have been for quite some time,
[1:28:57] paragraph 133. And he says this
[1:29:02] now watch. See, Paul said, "How you get
[1:29:05] in Christ? How you going to be known as
[1:29:08] a as a circumcision?" Abraham, they give
[1:29:12] a sign. Listen to this now. 1
[1:29:15] Corinthians the 12th chapter. Let's
[1:29:16] begin at the 12th verse. For as the body
[1:29:20] is one and has many members, all members
[1:29:23] of that one body, being many, are one
[1:29:27] body, so also is Christ, not divided,
[1:29:31] one. Listen. For by one church, how many
[1:29:34] you reading behind me? By one handshake,
[1:29:37] by one water. No, then somebody's wrong.
[1:29:40] By one spirit.
[1:29:43] Is it a capital? That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:47] Then see, by one spirit are we all
[1:29:50] baptized into one body, whether we be
[1:29:54] Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
[1:29:57] free, and have been made all to drink
[1:30:01] into one spirit. So we are baptized into
[1:30:06] the body of Christ by this one Holy
[1:30:10] Spirit.
[1:30:12] And every believer
[1:30:16] has to receive the Holy Spirit in order
[1:30:19] to make the rapture.
[1:30:22] It is the Holy Spirit that raptures us.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God tells us that in this
[1:30:28] very message. It is the Holy Spirit that
[1:30:31] is our advocate. It's our sign. It's our
[1:30:33] protection. It's all those things. He is
[1:30:37] the individual that lives inside of you.
[1:30:40] It's the spirit of God living inside of
[1:30:42] you.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; And that is what the Holy Ghost is. And
[1:30:48] have you received it was the theme of
[1:30:53] every apostle?
[1:30:55] That was the theme of every apostle
[1:31:00] was, "Have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:03] since you believed?"
[1:31:06] The prophet of God makes it very clear
[1:31:09] to us
[1:31:11] and he says it here. If I can get it for
[1:31:15] you quickly. Maybe they got it for me in
[1:31:18] the back. No. See
[1:31:36] and the token
[1:31:38] paragraph 148 that was the theme of
[1:31:40] every apostle that was have you received
[1:31:43] the Holy Ghost since you believed?
[1:31:46] Repent every one of you. Be baptized in
[1:31:50] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:31:51] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:31:54] this gift of the Holy Ghost. For it's a
[1:31:57] token, amen, that you've passed from
[1:32:00] death unto life. There you are. When the
[1:32:04] Jewish church faded out, the Gentiles
[1:32:06] taken it over and the perversion like
[1:32:08] that. Now she has come out to get that
[1:32:10] remnant of the Gentiles for his name's
[1:32:14] sake, the bride.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; So what was the theme of every apostle?
[1:32:19] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:32:22] you believed?
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; That's the theme. That's the question I
[1:32:27] would have for you. That's the question
[1:32:29] that I place before my own life. That's
[1:32:31] the question that we place at all times.
[1:32:34] Am I walking in the Holy Spirit? And
[1:32:38] then that great seal to come and the
[1:32:40] great adoption and the child training
[1:32:42] and all those great things as our
[1:32:45] brother had mentioned here. And just as
[1:32:50] we close just to because our brother
[1:32:53] made a statement about riding this trail
[1:32:58] again
[1:32:59] and I just want to bring it to
[1:33:02] what the prophet said. Okay,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; you all know me, right?
[1:33:08] It's got to be what the prophet said.
[1:33:10] And so in Noah at night 1965
[1:33:14] paragraph number 259.
[1:33:18] Okay, I'm just going to bring this
[1:33:21] quotation to you and then you'll know
[1:33:24] that this was a vision. Now
[1:33:26] this isn't a side quote.
[1:33:29] This was a vision that came to the
[1:33:32] prophet. And just like the disciples in
[1:33:35] Acts chapter 1, Lord, will you at this
[1:33:38] time begin to restore the kingdom?
[1:33:42] That's how we like to do. We want to
[1:33:44] know when and how and where in 1984. No,
[1:33:49] it's going to be in 2000. No, it's going
[1:33:51] to be 2017. Look at Hillary's purple
[1:33:54] dress and all this and what happened to
[1:33:57] Cal. We always do it.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; But he has given us his word.
[1:34:03] Can I get the quote here just for a
[1:34:05] moment?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; And this is what you're going to do if
[1:34:08] you're interested in what he said about
[1:34:11] Ry Israel again. You're going to go get
[1:34:13] that tape
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and you're going to press play.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; And find out where the prophet was
[1:34:18] wrong. Right?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Please.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; The term ride this trail again doesn't
[1:34:24] belong to any preacher. Don't belong to
[1:34:27] me.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It belongs to the vision that was given
[1:34:30] to the prophet.
[1:34:32] And this is why sometimes I jab a little
[1:34:35] bit on certain statements that I know it
[1:34:38] twirls the thumbs or toenails of certain
[1:34:40] people in the message because they they
[1:34:44] get upset over certain statements and
[1:34:46] they try to place me in a box or place
[1:34:48] you in a box or something and you get
[1:34:51] upset and get all in the bind and upset
[1:34:53] because brother Israel believes whatever
[1:34:55] or brother whoever believes whatever.
[1:34:58] Did the prophet say it? That's that's
[1:35:01] what you need to come down. Does the
[1:35:03] Bible say it? Did the prophet say it?
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Then say amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; And then go figure out what it means.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; How many you can understand what I'm
[1:35:14] saying?
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; But we get so uptight and I got a little
[1:35:19] my good friend's not here tonight. One
[1:35:21] of my good friends. I'm married to one
[1:35:23] of my good friends.
[1:35:26] You know, I say little things and I flex
[1:35:29] little things, but it's really to, you
[1:35:31] know, if there's a quotation or
[1:35:32] scripture, bring it to me, Brother John,
[1:35:35] and I'll say amen to it,
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; right? And for the rest of my life,
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; for the rest of my life, I'm not going
[1:35:43] to stop for anybody else a and try to
[1:35:47] figure it out. So, but but look at this.
[1:35:49] Paragraph 259. And a voice shook the
[1:35:52] whole earth and said the earth shook
[1:35:54] from under my feet and said after it
[1:35:57] quit shaking I heard a voice and said
[1:35:59] brother Brandham it was your voice and
[1:36:02] said I know there was something said
[1:36:04] said said I'll ride this trail once more
[1:36:09] and I start so go get the message how
[1:36:12] many you want to know what it means go
[1:36:14] get the message
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; and read it listen to it and say amen to
[1:36:20] it all the way through. Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you very much.
[1:36:26] Um,
[1:36:31] we want to go to the Lord in prayer. And
[1:36:34] those were some of the things I wanted
[1:36:35] to bring to you
[1:36:38] to start to bring to you on this Holy
[1:36:42] Ghost, what it is, and those that don't
[1:36:48] have it,
[1:36:50] you need to receive that. It's a
[1:36:52] definite experience, and you shouldn't
[1:36:54] rest. So in that message, he says this.
[1:36:58] He says, "Then on Friday night or
[1:37:00] Saturday night, we're going to go to the
[1:37:02] room." He says, "Now I want you
[1:37:03] ministers to come. I'm going to instruct
[1:37:05] the ministers." He said, "You're going
[1:37:07] to go into the room and you're going to
[1:37:10] stay there if we have to wait until
[1:37:12] Christmas to receive it."
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Now, that's the approach he gave.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; It wasn't this loose appointment like,
[1:37:19] "Yes, I'm a Christian. I believe now.
[1:37:22] I've given my heart to the Lord." And
[1:37:23] then we stop there. No, the next move is
[1:37:26] to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that?
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And if I haven't received it or I have
[1:37:35] received it, then there's a place for
[1:37:38] another feeling of it.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; A refilling.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. That's what we all
[1:37:45] desire. True Christians, true believers
[1:37:49] want another feeling.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; You know what? What if the prophet stood
[1:37:52] here today? If it was here, I'm standing
[1:37:54] here and he said, "I'm going to pray for
[1:37:56] all you believers to get another
[1:37:58] outpouring, another filling of the Holy
[1:38:00] Spirit." How many would sat in their
[1:38:02] seat say, "No, I'm good. I got enough."
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; No. No. That's never been the attitude
[1:38:07] of the believer. The believer wants
[1:38:10] more. They want all that God asked for
[1:38:13] them.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the attitude of the
[1:38:17] prophet. It's in the scriptures. That's
[1:38:19] the way he placed it.
[1:38:22] Amen.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, Sister Lorie Snow had her
[1:38:27] surgery today and it went well what
[1:38:30] we've heard. Is that right? Yes. And the
[1:38:35] Lord is bringing her through.
[1:38:39] I think that's surgery number 30
[1:38:41] something that she's had. brother. Her
[1:38:45] husband told me she's had several
[1:38:47] surgeries and the Lord is just bringing
[1:38:51] her through.
[1:38:53] Holding up. She's looking for a quick
[1:38:54] recovery. Thank you for praying for
[1:38:56] Desiree. Last week, she called her
[1:38:59] elderly mother and then a friend rescued
[1:39:02] her from a dangerous living situation.
[1:39:05] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's from Sister Elanti.
[1:39:13] Um
[1:39:15] yes, some of those that are traveling
[1:39:19] also want to keep Sister Lynette in
[1:39:21] prayer that the Lord will bring her to
[1:39:25] her Lynette Blevens to complete
[1:39:28] recovery. Is there any others that have
[1:39:30] requests here tonight
[1:39:32] her request? Yes.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sister Chris, also brother Chris
[1:39:42] Smith was a little worn out from some
[1:39:44] work he did today. Want to keep him in
[1:39:46] prayer and then we have time. We can go
[1:39:48] to the Lord in prayer. Is there someone
[1:39:50] else that had a request? Yes, brother.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. All right. We'll keep our brother
[1:40:07] in prayer. Brother.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many would join brother
[1:40:14] Nathaniel and say that? How many would
[1:40:16] with would emotion of lifting up your
[1:40:18] hand to heaven and saying, "Yes, Lord. I
[1:40:21] want another
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; refilling of the Holy Ghost." I desire
[1:40:26] that. I really We desire that. So, let's
[1:40:29] stand to our feet and let's go to the
[1:40:31] Lord in prayer. Um actually we'll just
[1:40:36] we'll play some soft music and we can
[1:40:38] come to the altar and pray. You can pray
[1:40:40] right at your seat. Just take a few
[1:40:42] moments and bringing these knees in
[1:40:45] prayer. Remember the saints in Mesa.
[1:40:48] Also there is a angel
[1:40:51] is talking to this young lady. He really
[1:40:54] angel Harris the one that comes around
[1:40:56] here. We baptized him here a year or two
[1:40:58] ago. He really says he's in love with
[1:41:01] this lady and they've been to church
[1:41:04] together. He wants to get married to her
[1:41:07] and um he's moving a bit fast for my
[1:41:11] opinion, but he's he's he looks better
[1:41:14] than he has in a long time with her. So,
[1:41:16] I can't figure it out. I really don't
[1:41:18] know. But it's always appropriate to
[1:41:21] pray this. I told him I'll pray for you.
[1:41:23] I told him I can't do the wedding, but I
[1:41:25] could I'll pray for you. And that's all
[1:41:28] I want for Angel. And her name is um
[1:41:32] her name is Addie.
[1:41:35] Um yes, her name is Addie. Adi, that's
[1:41:39] short for something.
[1:41:41] So keep them in prayer. The saints there
[1:41:44] for the Arts family with those Bible
[1:41:46] studies. They're still going forward
[1:41:48] with those. It's been really nice. So
[1:41:51] we'll ask the Lord's blessing on that.
[1:41:54] Amen. So let us pray. God bless you.
[2:04:23] There's a sweet, sweet spirit in this
[2:04:25] place. Let's just worship the Lord. Hear
[2:04:28] that?
[2:04:30] There's a sweet,
[2:04:32] sweet
[2:04:34] spirit
[2:04:36] in this place.
[2:04:43] And I know that it's the spirit
[2:04:50] of the Lord.
[2:04:56] There are sweet
[2:05:01] expressions
[2:05:03] on each face.
[2:05:10] And I know there is the presence
[2:05:17] of the Lord.
[2:05:25] Oh, sweet
[2:05:27] Holy
[2:05:29] Spirit,

[2:05:53] And
[2:05:55] for these blessings
[2:05:59] we live our heart in prayer.
[2:06:06] Without a doubt, we know that we have
[2:06:11] been revived
[2:06:14] when we shall leave this place.
[2:06:23] There's a sweet,
[2:06:26] sweet
[2:06:28] spirit
[2:06:30] in this place.
[2:06:35] Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] And I know
[2:06:40] that it's the spirit.
[2:06:44] Oh my. I love you, Lord Jesus. I give
[2:06:47] you praise.
[2:06:49] Oh, there are sweet
[2:06:55] expressions

[2:07:00] on each.

[2:07:47] and

[2:08:00] Without a doubt, we'll know that we have
[2:08:04] been revived.
[2:08:32] There's no supernatural
[2:08:43] for these blessings.

[2:08:54] without a doubt. We know
[2:09:04] Hallelujah.

[2:14:35] Oh
[2:14:37] Lord,
[2:14:42] I exalt
[2:14:46] thee.
[2:14:50] I exalt
[2:14:54] thee.
[2:14:57] I exalt
[2:15:01] thee.
[2:15:05] Oh
[2:15:07] Lord,
[2:15:08] let's take that verse.
[2:15:13] Thou, oh Lord,
[2:15:18] art high
[2:15:20] above all the earth.
[2:15:28] Thou art exalted
[2:15:33] far above
[2:15:37] all God.
[2:15:43] Oh thou, oh Lord
[2:15:49] are high
[2:15:51] above all the earth.
[2:15:59] Thou art exalted
[2:16:04] far above
[2:16:07] all
[2:16:09] gods. Let's exalt him tonight.
[2:16:15] We exalt
[2:16:18] thee.
[2:16:22] We exalt
[2:16:26] thee.
[2:16:30] We
[2:16:32] exalt
[2:16:34] thee,
[2:16:38] oh
[2:16:40] Lord.
[2:16:46] We exalt
[2:16:50] thee.
[2:16:52] Yes,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; we exalt
[2:16:57] thee.
[2:17:01] We
[2:17:03] exalt
[2:17:05] thee.
[2:17:18] just like to ask if brother Barrett if
[2:17:20] you could come forward and just dismiss
[2:17:23] us with a word of prayer.
[2:17:40] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[2:17:41] prayer. We thank God for his grace. May
[2:17:44] God create a desire within us. Amen. To
[2:17:46] hear this word speak back to us. And may
[2:17:48] it be alive in our soul. May there not
[2:17:50] be any doubt, any question. Amen. And
[2:17:54] you know, I was just thinking, amen, as
[2:17:55] brother Israel's going through the Holy
[2:17:57] Ghost series and such. Amen. You know,
[2:18:00] go back and listen. And you want to know
[2:18:01] how to receive the Holy Ghost, go back
[2:18:03] and listen to God in Simplicity,
[2:18:05] Albuquerque, New Mexico, the last 30
[2:18:07] minutes. Amen. And friends, we're in
[2:18:10] 2026.
[2:18:12] Amen. And we've had plenty of ordinary
[2:18:14] services, but may God give us some
[2:18:16] extraordinary services this year. Amen.
[2:18:19] May God take off the training wheels of
[2:18:21] our lives. May he make us rugged
[2:18:22] Christians. Maybe you be sick and tired
[2:18:25] of a formal half-hearted experience

[2:29:19] and treasure of the earth,
[2:29:26] there's no way to measure what you're
[2:29:30] worth.
[2:29:34] Crucified,
[2:29:38] laid behind the stone.
[2:29:42] You live to die.
[2:29:46] Rejected and alone.
[2:29:49] Like a rose
[2:29:52] trampled on the ground.
[2:29:57] You took the fall
[2:30:01] and thought of me
[2:30:06] above all. One more time.
[2:30:10] You were crucified,
[2:30:15] laid behind the stone.

[2:31:05] where to stand in the morning?
[2:31:11] Who told the ocean
[2:31:14] you can only come this far?
[2:31:21] And who showed the moon
[2:31:25] where to hide till evening?
[2:31:29] whose words alone can catch a falling
[2:31:34] star.

[2:32:15] The very same God
[2:32:19] that spins things in orbit
[2:32:24] runs to the weary,
[2:32:27] the mourn and the weak.
[2:32:33] And the same gentle hands
[2:32:38] that hold me when I'm broken,
