[25:05] the moment for prayer
[25:08] our heavenly father
[25:10] it is a grand privilege that we have of
[25:13] coming into thy presence
[25:16] in this attitude of worship and praise
[25:19] to thee and know that we can call thee
[25:22] Our Father
[25:26] being born of thy Spirit we are thy
[25:30] children
[25:31] and with the privilege of asking what we
[25:34] will
[25:35] and faith will bring it to us we thank
[25:39] thee for this
[25:40] most holy and righteous God we would ask
[25:44] the night that you would speak to those
[25:47] Lord who aren't needy
[25:49] those that need salvation to their souls
[25:54] and for those that are sick and in a
[25:58] desperate condition
[25:59] to the shut-ins
[26:01] those that are in the hospitals in their
[26:05] hospitalized and cannot get to the
[26:07] meeting
[26:07] all thou Great I Am go to their bedsides
[26:13] tonight and touch their sick bodies that
[26:16] they might be able to come from the
[26:19] hospitals to serve thee
[26:22] forgive us of our sins as we forgive
[26:25] those that sin against us
[26:28] that we might have thy favor in our
[26:31] midst tonight
[26:33] speak to us through Thy word Thy word is
[26:37] the truth
[26:38] make it known unto us Lord make Thy word
[26:42] to live among us for we asked it in the
[26:45] name of thy child the Lord Jesus amen
[26:54] thank you
[26:59] now for just to continue the message I
[27:03] was certainly
[27:05] packed away was standing there listening
[27:07] to brother duplicitous bring that
[27:10] message on
[27:12] the Apostle Peter being able to walk on
[27:15] the water something that he never did
[27:17] before
[27:19] and we can just do many things that we
[27:21] never did before if we'll just listen to
[27:24] his word and take his word part
[27:28] he never made a promise but what you'll
[27:30] stand behind
[27:32] now
[27:34] what time does the service start Sunday
[27:36] better Sunday 2 30. well that means
[27:40] about 1 30 those who want prayer cards
[27:43] should be here at 1 30 then so you won't
[27:45] disturb the meetings while they're
[27:47] giving out the prayer cards and at 2 30
[27:50] the services began and then we'll be out
[27:53] in time for you to go home and have your
[27:56] is it dinner or supper here
[28:00] I'm a southerner and it's supper to me
[28:03] if they call that dinner then what
[28:05] happens in my supper I miss out
[28:07] somewhere so I uh you go home to your
[28:10] supper that's what I would call it
[28:13] and then
[28:14] go to the your churches and the
[28:17] strangers in our gates we want to
[28:20] visiting here these fine churches will
[28:23] be having Sunday school Sunday morning
[28:24] and church Sunday night you find a place
[28:27] of your choice and attend that service
[28:31] and now
[28:35] I'm kindly happy about this meeting for
[28:39] many reasons because I have looked
[28:41] forward to it for some time of getting
[28:44] back
[28:45] I wish the this quote
[28:48] uh verse out of the Book of Job tonight
[28:51] the 23rd chapter and the third verse Oh
[28:56] that I knew where I might find him
[28:59] that I might come even to his seat
[29:03] that's job
[29:05] 23 3.
[29:09] I'm going to speak for a few minutes up
[29:12] on the subject of the
[29:16] unchangeable God
[29:19] if I should call it a subject
[29:22] there are many things and practically
[29:25] all things change
[29:28] time changes people changes weather
[29:32] changes
[29:33] Nations changes but God is in
[29:39] unchangeable he does not change he is
[29:43] the same all times
[29:46] God is an infinite God
[29:49] I do not believe that there would be any
[29:53] word could explain the the word or any
[29:57] way to explain the word infinite
[30:00] because it's the infinite he has never
[30:04] had a beginning or he'll never have an
[30:06] end
[30:07] therefore when God is called on the
[30:11] scene to act or to make a decision
[30:16] the way that he acts are the decision
[30:19] that he makes
[30:21] that is forever the same he cannot
[30:25] change it
[30:27] because he's infinite he's perfect
[30:31] now you and I can say a certain thing
[30:35] and next year we'll have to change it
[30:38] maybe and do something different or
[30:40] because we are finite
[30:43] we we do not know all things but he is
[30:48] perfect and his first decision will have
[30:52] to be his second decision will have to
[30:54] be like the first
[30:56] or if he makes another decision then he
[31:00] did not act right when he made the first
[31:02] decision then that puts him finite like
[31:05] I am or you are
[31:07] what I'm trying to do before this
[31:10] healing service comes is to instill in
[31:13] you of faith in God because that's what
[31:17] it takes for healing our Salvation you
[31:20] must have faith in God and God is no
[31:23] greater than his word are no more
[31:25] perfect than his word because God and
[31:28] His word is the self same thing you are
[31:32] no you're no better than your word God
[31:36] is no better than his word
[31:37] and your word is what you are God's word
[31:40] is what he is
[31:42] now any persons know that if God was
[31:46] called on the scene wants to save a man
[31:49] that was lost and God saved that man by
[31:55] his faith the next man calls on God God
[31:58] will have to save that man if he comes
[32:01] on the same grounds that the first man
[32:03] came on
[32:05] then if there is a sick man and he
[32:08] pleads to God for mercy and God gives
[32:11] him mercy and healing on the basis of
[32:15] his faith the next man that comes on
[32:17] them sane grounds and asks the same
[32:20] question God's got to act the same way
[32:23] or he acted wrong when he acts the first
[32:26] time
[32:27] so you see we must make God real
[32:30] unchangeable
[32:31] Every Soul that comes to God seeking
[32:35] salvation are healing he's got to come
[32:39] on those bases he's got to come
[32:42] believing that God is and a rewarder of
[32:45] those that diligently seek after him
[32:49] did not our lord Jesus say
[32:51] whatsoever things you desire When you
[32:54] pray believe that you receive them and
[32:57] you shall have them
[32:58] did not he say ask the father what you
[33:01] will in my name you will receive it now
[33:05] that is infallibly the truth
[33:08] and there's nobody that ever asked God
[33:12] anything but what God gave it to them if
[33:15] they come with an honest heart
[33:17] now the thing of it is God gives it
[33:20] sometimes in the way that
[33:22] we're not expecting it but God always
[33:25] keeps his word there's no way for God to
[33:28] tell you anything and lie about it and
[33:30] remain God
[33:32] he cannot he must keep his word forever
[33:35] it's the truth
[33:37] and when the Bible says that Jesus
[33:39] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[33:42] forever that is the truth
[33:47] I may not have faith enough to make all
[33:49] the things that he done live again but
[33:52] I'll never stand in the road of somebody
[33:53] who had faith enough to do it I would be
[33:56] thanking God for that faith but just the
[34:00] same every promise that he made is
[34:03] absolutely truth I can go on record for
[34:06] this tonight
[34:07] if any people will take the right mental
[34:10] attitude towards any Divine promise that
[34:13] God ever made and claim it for yours God
[34:17] will bring it to pass
[34:19] if you'll take the right attitude
[34:21] towards you knowing that it God said so
[34:24] the promise is yours and it your
[34:27] personal property the very minute you
[34:30] receive it that way
[34:31] then it has to come to pass for Jesus
[34:35] said the word is a seed that is sore so
[34:38] and a seed if it's a dermatized seed and
[34:41] it goes into the ground
[34:43] then that seed under the right
[34:46] conditions of the Sun and moisture will
[34:49] bring forth the life that's in the seed
[34:52] and so is the word of God if a person
[34:54] can take that word and place it in their
[34:57] heart and give it the right sunshine the
[34:59] right temperature not Su him but s-o-n
[35:02] and right temperature of faith in there
[35:06] that seed and promise will live to you
[35:08] just like it did at the beginning to the
[35:11] one it was given to you because it's
[35:13] God's word and he is the same yesterday
[35:16] today and forever he cannot fail
[35:20] now the thing is with the people is the
[35:24] way God Appears many times we want to
[35:27] make an idol out of God we ask God to do
[35:31] something and then he must do it just
[35:33] the way that we asked it or we'll say he
[35:37] never answered when we do that we weaken
[35:40] our faith in God
[35:42] and we weaken Our Testimony when we do
[35:45] not take him at his word
[35:47] God always answers no one never asks
[35:51] Jesus said ask and you shall receive
[35:55] seek and you shall find
[35:57] everyone that asks will receive everyone
[36:01] that seek shall find everyone that
[36:03] knocks it'll be open to them now that's
[36:06] the only way that I've always found it
[36:09] that I can get anything from God is
[36:12] taking at his word and believe it the
[36:14] way he sends it
[36:16] now if we do not take it just the way
[36:19] that we think it is we build God as an
[36:22] idol he's got to answer just according
[36:25] to our ways our well it's just no good
[36:27] he didn't answer us God answers in many
[36:30] ways
[36:31] you know answers in Peculiar ways times
[36:34] and everything is odd we'll take Francis
[36:37] Moses
[36:39] Moses was 80 years old he was almost you
[36:45] might think too old for God to deal with
[36:47] he was an old man unexpected in his age
[36:51] to be dealt with with God
[36:54] another thing he was under the mount
[36:56] harm
[36:58] unexpected place
[37:00] God met him at an unexpected age at an
[37:04] unexpected place and an unexpected way
[37:09] God didn't meet Moses the way he usually
[37:12] met man he met Moses in an unusual way
[37:16] in the way that he chose to meet Moses
[37:20] in that's the way he answers our prayer
[37:22] in the way that he thinks his best and
[37:26] his way is always right
[37:28] if we ask for anything and it doesn't
[37:30] happen just the way God or the way we
[37:32] think that God ought to let it happen
[37:34] then that makes us lose and fall back
[37:37] let's ask God stand firm on the word and
[37:40] say it's true in it just receive it the
[37:42] way he stands it that's the way you got
[37:44] to believe God it may come disguise it
[37:47] may come in another way a roundabout way
[37:49] but no matter what way it comes if we
[37:52] have asked we shall receive God said so
[37:56] and that settles it forever if God says
[38:00] so that's good now
[38:02] when you get to taking God like that and
[38:05] believing it now Moses what if he had
[38:08] said I prayed for God to make me a
[38:10] military man and here he is in a burning
[38:13] bush no American Universe how God
[38:15] appeared to him just so he appeared
[38:18] that's all that matters here
[38:20] as long as God comes and answers as long
[38:24] as we recognize it to be God Jacob
[38:28] another character he was caught between
[38:31] two occasions
[38:32] he had done some mean things some
[38:34] sneaking little tricks to his his
[38:37] father-in-law Lebanon and he was running
[38:40] from his father-in-law going back home
[38:43] to Mama
[38:44] and when he come to find out here come
[38:47] his brother that he had done some dirty
[38:49] little tricks to was come and meet him
[38:51] with an army
[38:53] just remember your sins finds you out
[38:56] and then Jacob all Disturbed and
[38:59] perplexed and in trouble set his wives
[39:03] across the Little Brook went back on the
[39:05] other side and an unexpected place and
[39:09] an unexpected time he met God in an
[39:12] unexpected way
[39:15] what a way to meet God in a wrestling
[39:17] match
[39:18] but it was gone regardless of what is in
[39:21] a burning bush or a wrestling match it
[39:23] was gone
[39:24] and the main thing was that Jacob
[39:27] he had had dreams and visions and so
[39:30] forth but this is one time he could lay
[39:33] his hand on something and say it's gone
[39:35] and he was able to hold on to it until
[39:39] the blessing came
[39:41] or if we could do that if we could find
[39:44] a spot to where we could see God whether
[39:47] it's in his word wherever it is and
[39:49] recognizes God and hold on to it until
[39:52] the blessing comes blast it out with God
[39:56] promised to do it God said if we'd seek
[39:59] we'd find us and it shall be given knock
[40:03] it'll be opened every word is true when
[40:07] Jacob got a hold of something and he
[40:09] could look at hold two with his hands
[40:11] and seen that it was God he would not
[40:14] turn it loose
[40:16] oh if christianom could do that if you
[40:20] could lay your hand a hold of something
[40:21] that's real
[40:23] catch a vision of God and see his
[40:25] presence and hold on to it
[40:27] until God sends the answer back and the
[40:31] blessing what a Revival or break up here
[40:34] in Tulsa If people could do that could
[40:37] see the power of the Living God
[40:39] something real no matter what form it
[40:42] comes in we have our ideas but God has a
[40:45] way of sending things to us answering
[40:47] our prayer it's been praying he's going
[40:49] on here in this city for a long time for
[40:52] Revival I believe if we would just open
[40:55] our eyes and be ready to receive it God
[40:57] would send it to us in his way of doing
[41:00] it in his time God would Grant it but
[41:05] we've got to recognize we have asked and
[41:07] if we ask them we shall receive and he
[41:10] held on to it unexpected time unexpected
[41:14] place on an unexpected way but when he
[41:18] realized that it was God he held on to
[41:20] it
[41:21] Isaiah the young prophet he had a
[41:25] wonderful life he leaned upon the good
[41:28] King's arm and everything come finding
[41:31] it got all fat and overweight from
[41:33] eating and one day the king died and
[41:36] Isaiah was caught in a vision when he
[41:39] seen the train of the Lord he saw angels
[41:43] flying to the building
[41:44] Wings over their face and wings over
[41:46] their feet and flying with two Wings
[41:48] crying holy holy holy the Lord God
[41:51] Almighty
[41:53] and when he seen that and knows that he
[41:56] was standing in the presence of a holy
[41:58] God
[41:59] he said woe is needed
[42:02] for I am a man of unclean lips
[42:05] and I'm believing among unclean people
[42:08] and the Lord was crying who will go for
[42:11] us and the angel took the tongs and got
[42:15] some coals off the Altar and touched it
[42:18] to his mouth and cleansed him it was an
[42:21] unusual sight for the prophet is an
[42:23] unusual way that God dealt with him but
[42:27] God knows how to deal with man Isaiah
[42:30] had been educated in at a school with
[42:33] the King and so forth he had the best it
[42:36] could be giving mentally I suppose in
[42:38] his intellectual but God had to make a
[42:41] profit out of him by revealing himself
[42:44] to him by giving him something tangible
[42:47] that he could see it was no more so much
[42:49] in literature and reading and writing
[42:52] but the things that he had read about
[42:54] God and heard about God become
[42:56] manifested right before him then he said
[42:58] I'm of Uncle
[43:01] dealing and
[43:02] doing unclean
[43:04] unclean prepared him for his days of
[43:06] Prophecy that's the way God does things
[43:09] he does it in a mysterious way the
[43:12] Prophet Elijah
[43:13] we might think of him for a moment there
[43:16] he is laying back in a cave
[43:18] he had seen the power of God a few days
[43:21] before that 40 days before he had God's
[43:24] power
[43:25] he had prayed and three years and six
[43:29] months it had not rained
[43:31] and then he prayed again on the mountain
[43:33] and fire came down from heaven and
[43:35] devoured the sacrifice
[43:37] and then he prayed again and rain come
[43:40] and bathe the Earth
[43:42] and then father fear of the threat of
[43:46] the queen he run into the Wilderness he
[43:49] knowed he was missing something
[43:52] there was something in him that wasn't
[43:55] right yet when he pulled back in the
[43:57] cave their common earthquake outside
[44:00] that shook the cave where he was all
[44:02] setting there come a mighty Russian wind
[44:05] there come Thunders and Lightnings and
[44:07] boeings and it was all God but it didn't
[44:10] attract the prophet
[44:12] it didn't touch him somehow he know what
[44:14] God's power was he no God had shut the
[44:18] mountains and he'd had Russian winds and
[44:20] so forth and sent far out of heaven but
[44:22] he waited and weighed down inside of him
[44:25] come a little still voice
[44:27] that attracted the prophet there was
[44:30] something he'd seen his power to do
[44:32] things but this time he felt his
[44:34] presence and a still small voice
[44:37] speaking into his heart then the prophet
[44:41] raised up and went out to the end of the
[44:43] cave sometimes we ask for things get
[44:46] something vice versa we make God
[44:49] something here we want to make an answer
[44:51] the way we think he ought to answer
[44:53] Israel there's another king
[44:56] Israel was looking for a mighty king to
[45:00] come to beat the Romans down with the
[45:02] rod of iron what did God give him a baby
[45:06] instead of a mighty king he gave him a
[45:08] baby
[45:09] wrapped in swaddling cloth said you'll
[45:11] find him laying in a Manger he didn't
[45:13] come the way that they expected him to
[45:16] come and they refused it it has to come
[45:19] our way are so good they said take it
[45:22] back and he did
[45:24] Drive you've got to accept it the way
[45:27] God sends it and be happy about it
[45:30] God anchors a little something in your
[45:32] heart and says this is it believe it
[45:34] hold on to it that's God's word he
[45:37] promised he'd confirm it to you and if
[45:39] he confirms the word hold on to it yeah
[45:42] they didn't want that baby if you can't
[45:43] send us the king well we won't have that
[45:46] baby you can just take it back see it's
[45:49] got to be a way that that we think it's
[45:52] got to be we must remember that God does
[45:55] it his way and his way is always the
[45:58] right way we've got to believe what God
[46:02] said about it and know that it's
[46:04] absolutely the truth and stay with it
[46:06] hold on to it
[46:09] Jesus when you become a man he was
[46:11] humble and how could a king of of the
[46:16] heavens have spit in his face and a rag
[46:19] around his head and hit him with the
[46:21] stick and said say that tell me you're a
[46:23] prophet tell us who hits him we'll
[46:25] believe you and he never opened his
[46:27] mouth how could that be the king that
[46:30] they was looking for was going to beat
[46:32] the world down but God sent him the king
[46:34] and because God sent it in his way then
[46:37] they refused to believe it but God had
[46:41] that way of doing the Senate and he
[46:43] never sent it any other way but what his
[46:45] word said he would come
[46:47] but they had their mind made up it had
[46:49] to be some other way that's where we
[46:51] make the mistake frame that's where the
[46:54] trouble is when the Forerunner John the
[46:56] Baptist King the voice of one crying in
[46:59] the wilderness while the Bible said all
[47:01] the high places will be brought down and
[47:03] all the Low Places will be lifted up and
[47:05] all these things that take place them
[47:07] mountains and Skip like little Rams and
[47:09] the leaves that clap their hands well
[47:11] there's expecting a shaking of this man
[47:13] coming down all the quarters of Heaven
[47:16] all dressed in fine linen and crowns
[47:19] upon his head or something what happened
[47:21] God sent him an old preacher down on the
[47:24] Wilderness with a piece of sheepskin
[47:26] wrapped around look like a fuzzy worm
[47:27] his face all full of beard oh way was
[47:31] such a fellows that eating Locust and
[47:33] wild honey we don't want nothing to do
[47:35] with that how could that poor run the
[47:36] Messiah but it was God's way of pulling
[47:39] the Messiah we've got to receive it in
[47:42] the way that God said it God's pleased
[47:44] with it that's his way he's all wisdom
[47:47] he's all powerful he's omnipotent
[47:49] omnipresent oh he's God
[47:52] the I am not the I was or will be but I
[47:55] am forever the same he's gone and he
[47:58] does things in mysterious ways and but
[48:01] he does it for his own Glory he does it
[48:05] because it hits best to do it that way
[48:07] we must receive it the way that he sends
[48:09] it I'm sure that all of our charts and
[48:12] calendars and so forth that we have
[48:14] drawn up Jesus coming on a cloud and
[48:16] Nixon got him on a white horse and all I
[48:18] get it'll be all together different when
[48:20] he comes it won't be the way that we've
[48:23] got it and many will fail to see it
[48:25] many will fail to see this day that
[48:28] we're living in many it fails to see uh
[48:32] the sign of the coming Messiah right now
[48:36] many people fail to see it
[48:38] they they it's right before them yet
[48:41] they they don't see it Jesus said when
[48:44] he's spoken and Luke I believe it was
[48:47] and he said as it was in the days of
[48:49] Sodom
[48:50] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[48:53] of man as it was in the days of Noah did
[48:56] you notice how he said the morals of the
[48:59] people in the days of Noah eating
[49:00] drinking marrying giving and marriage
[49:02] but when he said Sodom he just left it
[49:04] all that was the fire that burnt Sodom
[49:07] it's the fire that catches the Earth
[49:08] today let's review that for a few
[49:11] minutes Abraham setting out there not
[49:14] expecting anything he was in the poorest
[49:17] of the land it was In the Heat of the
[49:19] day a odd time for something to happen
[49:22] but he's seen a man come walking three
[49:24] of them
[49:25] something in his heart told him it was
[49:28] God and he held on to it
[49:31] wouldn't let him die
[49:32] oh God made that happen here
[49:35] don't let it pass by hold on to it
[49:39] come in sit down under the oak I'll
[49:42] fetch a little water I'll be a servant
[49:44] to you let me wash your feet I'll bring
[49:47] you more so bread you satisfy your soul
[49:49] then you may go on for this reason my
[49:52] Lord has come to me yet not too sure but
[49:55] he knew that there's something sparked
[49:57] in his heart it must be the time
[50:00] when that man sit and talk to him look
[50:03] what he did he looked down he said
[50:05] Abraham a stranger
[50:07] how do you know his name was Abraham
[50:10] where is thy wife Sarah
[50:13] he knew he had a wife and oh her name
[50:15] was Sarah
[50:16] and the Bible said that Abraham told him
[50:19] in the tent behind you
[50:23] and he said see that Abraham is the heir
[50:26] of the world will I keep anything from
[50:28] Abraham
[50:30] seeing it is the era of the world
[50:32] and he said according to the time of
[50:34] life I'm going to visit it and Sarah
[50:37] 90 years old back in the tent behind him
[50:40] never seen him never know nothing about
[50:42] anything he know about Sarah
[50:44] and she laughed within herself perhaps
[50:47] like that put her hands up to her mouth
[50:50] and this angel with his back turned
[50:53] said why did Cheryl Ash
[50:55] [Music]
[50:57] who was that
[50:59] he little expected that man to be who he
[51:02] was but when he went to leave Abraham
[51:05] call him Elohim God almighty
[51:08] what was the sign of that God Almighty
[51:12] in the form of the Holy Ghost in the
[51:14] last days before this world shall burn
[51:16] he'll come to his people and brought him
[51:19] all these people
[51:21] [Applause]
[51:24] making himself known to his church
[51:27] just before the fire falls just before
[51:30] the destruction of the world
[51:32] Elohim God the holy spirit will come in
[51:36] among these people and do the signs that
[51:39] he did then oh he's the unchangeable god
[51:42] that's the way he made himself known to
[51:44] the Jews that's how he made himself
[51:46] known to the Samaritans the same way
[51:49] many of the Church believe him or he's a
[51:51] Beelzebub but those who seated and
[51:54] recognized it to be God they recognized
[51:56] who he was
[51:57] the woman at the well she said sir
[52:00] Messiah cometh we know and he'll tell us
[52:02] these things you must be his prophet he
[52:04] said I am he that speaks to you she run
[52:07] into the City and said come see a man
[52:10] unexpected she was to find a man like
[52:12] that unexpected
[52:15] expect the Messiah on Earth dwelling
[52:19] so is it today the people don't expect
[52:21] her expecting something else they're
[52:23] expecting bombs and things to fall which
[52:25] probably will be they're expecting some
[52:28] great Union amongst the church people
[52:30] now it may be but in the midst of all of
[52:33] that God has sent the power of His Son
[52:36] Jesus Christ amongst the people and
[52:39] they're having a new Pentecost the power
[52:41] of God being poured out and the same
[52:43] signs and wonders that did many years
[52:46] ago is in the midst of the people as
[52:48] Jesus said it would be we don't look for
[52:50] a unionized among all the churches and
[52:52] things we look for an outpouring of a
[52:54] Holy Ghost and it'll come and do things
[52:57] that
[52:58] that we might not be expecting I know
[53:01] he's here now I know the holy spirit is
[53:04] here in the meeting and I know that he
[53:06] promised wherever two or three are
[53:08] gathered in my uh uh in their together
[53:11] I'll be in their midst
[53:13] Jesus Promised forever two or three
[53:17] that's a power that's uh what the early
[53:19] church relied upon the presence of Jesus
[53:24] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[53:26] name I'll be in their midst
[53:29] and whatever they agree upon is touching
[53:31] one thing and ask they shall receive it
[53:34] that is true that's God's promise
[53:38] he's unchangeable he's the same
[53:40] yesterday today and forever and he's
[53:42] sure now do you believe it

[55:50] and he's in the charger before him his
[55:53] own garments bloody sitting there seeing

[56:43] sake in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[56:47] you love him
[56:49] with all your heart
[56:51] are you expecting him to do the
[56:54] exceeding the abundance above all that
[56:57] we could do or to think
[57:01] he said he would do the exceeding
[57:04] abundance above all that we could do our
[57:07] thing he promised to do it now when
[57:10] Jesus is sure on Earth how many knows
[57:12] that he did not claim to be a Healer how
[57:15] many knows that he wasn't a Healer
[57:18] no better than that he said it's not me
[57:21] that doeth the works it's my father
[57:24] that dwelleth in
[57:26] works verily verily I say unto you John
[57:29] 5 19 verily verily I say unto you the
[57:33] son can do nothing in himself but what
[57:35] he sees the father doing that doeth the
[57:38] son likewise is that what he said Saint
[57:41] John 5 19 when he knows where a man was
[57:44] laying with an infirmity laying on a
[57:46] pallet told him his faith to make him
[57:49] whole pick up his bed and go to the
[57:51] house and he was questioned amongst the
[57:52] Jews and he left thousands of people
[57:54] laying there lame halt blind Twisted he
[57:57] said I only do what the father tells me
[57:59] or shows me to do I I do want the I see
[58:03] the father doing the father worketh and
[58:06] I worketh hitherto now that's his Spirit
[58:09] now Jesus himself did not perform any
[58:12] healings without first God showing him
[58:14] that's the scripture I do nothing except
[58:18] the father shows me first not tells me
[58:21] shows me first then when he shows him he
[58:25] goes and does what the father tells him
[58:27] the woman had touched His Garment
[58:29] now he never did that he never said he
[58:32] did it he said thy faith has save thee
[58:35] thy faith has save thee blind Barn
[58:38] Emmaus at the gate thy faith has made
[58:41] thee whole he had nothing to do with it
[58:43] the people's Faith did that because they
[58:46] believed that he was the son of God
[58:49] she touched him the woman did and she
[58:52] touched these garment and now he didn't
[58:55] feel it physically because the
[58:57] Palestinian garment has an underneath
[58:58] garment and the robe hangs loose and she
[59:01] touched the border of it for she said
[59:03] within her heart if Alba touch His
[59:06] Garment I'll be made whole
[59:08] and she touched him and when she did
[59:11] while she felt within herself because
[59:14] her faith had been if she could touch it
[59:17] she'll be made well and she did what she
[59:19] thought that would bring the power of
[59:21] God to her and she felt that it was all
[59:24] sufficient
[59:25] and it was because she believed it
[59:28] Jesus turned and looked around the
[59:30] audience
[59:31] he said who touched me Peter rebuked him
[59:33] said who touched you while all of them's
[59:36] touching you why would you say a thing
[59:38] like that he said but I perceive that I
[59:40] have gotten weak or virtues gone from me
[59:43] which means strength I got weak somebody
[59:45] touched me with a different kind of a
[59:47] touch and he looked around over the
[59:49] audience until he found the woman and
[59:53] he's told her about her blood issue had
[59:54] stopped because her faith had made her
[59:57] well
[59:58] now that's the Jesus was yesterday
[1:00:00] that's the same Jesus today that's the
[1:00:03] same Jesus there will be tomorrow if
[1:00:04] there is a tomorrow and we'll be forever
[1:00:07] when people think that God makes a
[1:00:10] promise and don't keep it Muhammad's or
[1:00:12] nothing else I've helped the Bible in
[1:00:14] one hand the Quran and the other one and
[1:00:16] say one of them's right and one's wrong
[1:00:18] both of them can't be right because
[1:00:20] we're contrary one to another I say you
[1:00:22] proved that your Prophet is dead he's in
[1:00:24] the ground our Jesus raised my dead and
[1:00:27] he promised the things that he did we'll
[1:00:29] do also
[1:00:31] I said now let me see you do the works
[1:00:33] of Mohammad can't do it but the works of
[1:00:36] Jesus Christ is done by the Holy Ghost
[1:00:37] when he comes to anoint the people do
[1:00:40] you believe that
[1:00:42] certainly We Believe
[1:00:43] it what would keep us from believing
[1:00:45] because God made the promise God said so
[1:00:48] that settles it now man cannot do that
[1:00:51] it's supernatural
[1:00:53] it's something that man can't do I've
[1:00:55] just got a couple of minutes time on to
[1:00:57] explain that see man cannot do nothing
[1:00:59] it's God in man Jesus said I am the vine
[1:01:03] ye are the brains
[1:01:05] now as long as the branch is in the vine
[1:01:08] it'll bear the fruit of the Vine
[1:01:11] now God always used man for his agent
[1:01:14] that's why he used his own son to unveil
[1:01:17] himself he come down and took the form
[1:01:19] of man in order to Die the death for man
[1:01:22] he could not die in the spirit but he
[1:01:24] was put to Death In the Flesh then God
[1:01:26] was in Abraham God was in Isaac God was
[1:01:29] in Jacob God was in Joseph God was in
[1:01:31] David he was in all those people back in
[1:01:34] there them prophets and so forth it was
[1:01:36] God working through man now in this new
[1:01:39] testament age the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:01:41] cleanses his church and sanctifies it
[1:01:44] that his holy spirit might continue to
[1:01:46] carry the work of God on through all
[1:01:48] ages
[1:01:49] and he's just the same today if it isn't
[1:01:52] then we're false Witnesses of this Bible
[1:01:54] if it if that isn't true then the Bible
[1:01:56] isn't true
[1:01:58] it's time that man preached the gospel
[1:02:01] it's time that the power of God was made
[1:02:04] known when heathens trying to step on
[1:02:06] that word we need man like the Hebrew
[1:02:08] children are God is able to Deliver Us
[1:02:10] from this that's right it's time God
[1:02:13] Remains the Same now God cannot heal you
[1:02:16] because he's already done it when he was
[1:02:19] wounded for your transgressions Bruce
[1:02:21] for your iniquity the chastisement of
[1:02:23] your peace upon him and with his stripes
[1:02:25] you were healed it's a past tense if he
[1:02:29] stood here tonight with this suit on
[1:02:30] that he gave me he could not heal you if
[1:02:33] you asked him he'd say I've already done
[1:02:34] it you believe it he might do something
[1:02:37] to make you know that it was him
[1:02:39] and that's what he does today he makes
[1:02:41] it known to his people by his people
[1:02:44] that he is God not the man but God now
[1:02:49] he's just as real tonight I I know he's
[1:02:52] here
[1:02:53] how many ever seen that picture of the
[1:02:55] Angel of the Lord that line
[1:02:56] there's many of you they got your thing
[1:02:58] somewhere
[1:02:59] boys may have it genome he's got the
[1:03:02] table back there that light
[1:03:04] you remember I don't know if I never
[1:03:06] meet you again in Earth I'll meet you at
[1:03:09] that day that life isn't standing two
[1:03:10] feet from where I'm standing now
[1:03:13] he's right he promised it
[1:03:16] and I believe God
[1:03:18] seen it against tens of thousands of
[1:03:20] heathens I've seen it in times on which
[1:03:23] doctors on both sides and see the power
[1:03:25] of God past I haven't set there
[1:03:28] God's either God or he's not God Jesus
[1:03:32] either the Son of God or he was an
[1:03:34] imposter he is Christ the son of God he
[1:03:37] is not dead but he's alive and he lives
[1:03:40] forevermore the same yesterday today and
[1:03:43] forever
[1:03:45] how many believe that
[1:03:47] God bless you
[1:03:51] how many you believe that he can appear
[1:03:53] right we ain't got no prayer part to get
[1:03:55] out

[1:04:20] Tyler
[1:04:22] um I don't know where you all know him
[1:04:24] or not and brother Gene gold sitting
[1:04:25] here taking the message
[1:04:28] man on the platform I met him last night
[1:04:30] finest bunch of man I ever met in my
[1:04:31] life but the only ones that I really
[1:04:33] know personally is
[1:04:34] brother out there you sponsored me the
[1:04:36] first time last year brother of Williams
[1:04:37] and his son
[1:04:39] brother borders Brother David and
[1:04:42] brother um
[1:04:44] Harvey is the only ones I really know
[1:04:47] here
[1:04:48] but Jesus Christ knows every one of you
[1:04:51] if he is the same yesterday today and
[1:04:53] forever put him to a showdown is he gone
[1:04:56] is it right
[1:04:58] he knows every one of you
[1:05:01] if we are approaching the coming of the
[1:05:03] Son of God how did he prove himself to
[1:05:06] be God and to be the Son of God to the
[1:05:08] Jews when he told Peter who he was
[1:05:11] he said told Nathanael where you've been
[1:05:13] when he was under the Fig Tree when he
[1:05:15] saw him under the tree praying he said
[1:05:17] Thou Art the Son of God you're the king
[1:05:20] of Israel that was the sign of the
[1:05:21] Messiah to the Jewish Nation the priest
[1:05:23] walked back and said he's a fortune
[1:05:25] teller
[1:05:26] and he said you say that it got me I'll
[1:05:28] forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has
[1:05:29] come but not speak against it then
[1:05:32] because it'll never be forgiven and this
[1:05:34] in this world or the world to come
[1:05:35] what's that there's only three classes
[1:05:38] of people that's ham sham and
[1:05:40] japhethah's people that's Jews Gentile
[1:05:42] and Samaritans remember Peter Pentecost
[1:05:45] preached to the Jews open the kingdom do
[1:05:47] the Samaritans one Philip had one out
[1:05:49] and baptized them yet they have not
[1:05:50] received the Holy Ghost now at the house
[1:05:52] of Cornelius then all of them had heard
[1:05:54] ham shame and japheth's people the Holy
[1:05:56] Ghost was then didn't need him anymore
[1:05:58] for that purpose because the Holy Spirit
[1:06:00] went to all the people when Jesus come
[1:06:02] we Gentiles were Anglo-Saxons which did
[1:06:05] not look Faro coming Messiah we were
[1:06:07] heathens of clubs on her back but they
[1:06:10] that was looking for a messiah there was
[1:06:12] the Jews and the Samaritans looking for
[1:06:15] the Messiah when he appeared how what
[1:06:18] kind of a sign did he do he done the
[1:06:20] sign of the Prophet that Moses spoke of
[1:06:22] it would be a god Prophet amen they
[1:06:24] looked at it those who were really
[1:06:26] spiritual LED they seemed do that sign
[1:06:28] they said that's him
[1:06:30] but the others had all their
[1:06:31] intellectual trainings they said this
[1:06:33] guy's Beelzebub he went over to Samaria
[1:06:35] he had need a woman come out of the well
[1:06:38] and he said then bring me a drink of
[1:06:40] water and she says not customary we got
[1:06:42] segregation here Jews and Samaritans
[1:06:44] have no dealing he said woman if you
[1:06:47] knew who you were talking to you'd ask
[1:06:48] me for a drink yes she said the whale's
[1:06:51] deep you have what was he doing he's
[1:06:52] contacting her spirit
[1:06:54] and what he found where her trouble was
[1:06:56] we all know what it was we're her
[1:06:58] trouble ain't he said go get your
[1:07:00] husband to come here she said I don't
[1:07:01] have any husbands said you said right
[1:07:03] you got five and the one you're living
[1:07:05] with now is not your husband she said
[1:07:06] sir I perceive that you're a blzibar no
[1:07:10] sir she said I perceive that you're a
[1:07:13] prophet
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:15] I perceive that you are a prophet now we
[1:07:19] know we know we Samaritans we're taught
[1:07:21] we know when Messiah cometh he'll tell
[1:07:23] us these things yes that was the sign of
[1:07:25] Messiah but who are you he said I'm he
[1:07:28] that speaks to you
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:32] remember not to Gentiles did he ever do
[1:07:35] it he did not do that to Gentiles then
[1:07:38] if he's an infinite God and let them
[1:07:40] with the intellectual teaching as much
[1:07:42] as we have today if we go into the out
[1:07:45] of this our dispensation without the
[1:07:47] same manifestation then he'd done
[1:07:49] something for them he did not do for us
[1:07:51] but he's the same yesterday today and
[1:07:53] forever he promised he would do it what
[1:07:55] did he do many scriptures but the one
[1:07:57] who just quoted as it was in the days of
[1:08:00] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:08:02] the son of man so shall it be the same
[1:08:05] thing will take place just before the
[1:08:07] fire there he is the infinite God he's
[1:08:10] here tonight
[1:08:12] that's a big thing to say but it's a
[1:08:14] something that the Bible said so in the
[1:08:16] Holy Spirit is sure to back it up and
[1:08:18] say it's the truth
[1:08:20] let us pray oh Lord
[1:08:23] there's somebody there suffering no
[1:08:26] doubt some people are in need I pray
[1:08:28] thee father to be merciful and just let
[1:08:31] it be known that thou art God just speak
[1:08:34] the words Lord and I pray that some poor
[1:08:37] soul in here that's seeking you that
[1:08:39] they'll be able to touch the high priest
[1:08:43] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:08:45] our infirmities just granted Lord at
[1:08:48] least one or two that the people might
[1:08:50] know an amount of one or two witnesses
[1:08:52] or two or three Witnesses May every word
[1:08:54] be established granted father I asked it
[1:08:57] for God's glory and for the sake of the
[1:09:00] message tonight Lord and your word that
[1:09:02] declares it to be so that the people
[1:09:04] might know that the time of unfolding
