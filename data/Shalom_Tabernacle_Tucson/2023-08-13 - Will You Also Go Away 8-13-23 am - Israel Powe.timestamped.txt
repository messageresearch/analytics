[47:22] amen so we are going to take the
[47:25] scripture
[47:27] in Exodus chapter
[47:31] what I like to do with this scripture is
[47:33] today
[47:35] Exodus 23 from verse number 20.
[47:46] to save a little time I would just take
[47:49] a couple of verses there and then we'll
[47:50] go to Saint John chapter 6.
[47:54] behold I sent an angel before thee to
[47:56] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[47:59] into the place which I have prepared
[48:03] beware of him and obey his voice
[48:07] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[48:10] your transgressions for my name is in
[48:14] him
[48:15] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[48:18] and do all that I speak then I will be
[48:22] an enemy unto thy enemies and an
[48:25] adversary unto thine adversaries amen
[48:29] Saint John chapter 6.
[48:35] verse 67
[48:37] very familiar portion of scripture
[48:40] is
[48:43] Jesus is asking his disciples a question
[48:50] then said Jesus unto the twelve will you
[48:54] also go away
[48:56] then Simon Peter answered
[48:59] him Lord
[49:01] to whom shall we go
[49:04] thou Hast the words
[49:07] of eternal life and we believe and are
[49:11] sure that thou art that Christ the son
[49:15] of the Living God
[49:17] Jesus answered them have not I chose you
[49:20] 12 and one of you is the devil
[49:23] he spake of Judas is Carrot the son of
[49:26] Simon for he it was that should betray
[49:29] him being one of the twelve will you
[49:32] also go away that's the title of the
[49:35] message this morning Jesus asked this
[49:38] question to his disciples will you also
[49:41] go away
[49:43] let us pray one more time
[49:45] Father in heaven we thank you
[49:48] for the words that we just read I pray
[49:51] that you're moving my thoughts from
[49:53] anything contrary to you and may you
[49:57] take full control of the service this
[49:59] morning Lord let the Holy Spirit take
[50:02] full control and meet our needs we pray
[50:05] let it the words be seasoned with salt
[50:08] and Grace
[50:09] and with your mercy
[50:12] and that's what we need Lord we ask in
[50:14] Jesus name amen God bless you you may be
[50:18] seated just a little bit of an
[50:20] announcement tonight brother Bob Willard
[50:21] will be with us to minister there in
[50:25] um in Mesa the uh
[50:29] um
[50:31] the Tabernacle there The Landmark
[50:34] Christian fellowship and he's here in
[50:37] the city this morning and I pulled him
[50:39] to come and be with us tonight so we're
[50:41] looking forward to that amen
[50:43] will you also go away now this
[50:47] particular message and I know I
[50:50] certainly agreed any visitors here I see
[50:52] some people that I maybe never saw
[50:54] before maybe I'm not real familiar with
[50:57] them but God bless you and we certainly
[50:59] trust that something will be said that
[51:01] will bless you and help you in your
[51:03] Christian Journey that's the motive
[51:05] that's our intentions but this scripture
[51:07] here where our lord Jesus is asking his
[51:11] disciples the question
[51:13] to get the full context of what's going
[51:16] on you got to go to verse number one of
[51:19] Saint John
[51:21] chapter 6.
[51:23] these are two days that of of events
[51:26] taking place here
[51:28] and Jesus
[51:31] ask a question first there is a great
[51:34] multitude following him
[51:37] and this multitude is following him
[51:40] because of the Miracles and of the
[51:44] healing
[51:45] uh people follow things for a reason
[51:48] there's something a human attraction
[51:50] that causes you to follow another group
[51:53] or another man or a woman or whatever it
[51:56] may be and this large group of people we
[51:59] later find out it was over 5 000 people
[52:03] that was coming to his ministry
[52:06] and for the local church here our church
[52:09] here just to say a few things about you
[52:13] know the third pool we're going to talk
[52:15] a little bit about that here this
[52:18] morning just for a few moments and I
[52:20] think we could see the first second and
[52:22] third pool right here in Saint John
[52:24] chapter 6. what are these pools for you
[52:27] that don't know the first pool as
[52:30] brother Branham describes and his
[52:32] ministry was a sign in his hand this is
[52:35] where the Lord the angel of the Lord
[52:37] came to him and told him about these
[52:40] Ministries that were given to him to go
[52:43] to the people he would take his left
[52:46] hand
[52:47] showing that it was closest to his heart
[52:49] and he would take the right hand of the
[52:51] patient and be able to detect diseases
[52:54] in their life the patient's right hand
[52:57] showing that they had confidence and
[52:59] they believed him the second poll was he
[53:03] had the uh the prophesying or the
[53:07] ability to determine the secrets of the
[53:10] heart known as discernment
[53:12] able to
[53:14] pick up pick up those
[53:16] um uh the the you know the angel told
[53:18] them if you'll be sincere the secrets in
[53:21] the heart the third pool was the spoken
[53:23] word or the opening of the word and even
[53:27] God using him in a great and tremendous
[53:31] signs wonders Miracle creation and so
[53:34] forth a control of Nature and those
[53:38] things
[53:39] these three fools will call them healing
[53:43] and then prophesying one he starts with
[53:47] a multitude of people coming to him and
[53:51] the reason they came to him was for the
[53:53] Miracles in healing and
[53:57] um the people the the miracles signs
[54:00] wonders in healing will resonate to any
[54:03] man any black man any white man any poor
[54:06] man any rich man this is debate this is
[54:10] human connection this is where we
[54:13] connect as human beings I need help
[54:16] and you can help me
[54:19] and there's a connection there and so
[54:21] this caused this great crowd this great
[54:24] multitude of people to follow Jesus
[54:27] because of the Miracles the signs and
[54:29] wonders
[54:30] and remember all of these attributes of
[54:35] healing prophesying the opening of the
[54:38] word or the mystery of the word being
[54:40] revealed which is the highest order all
[54:42] of those things we've seen that
[54:44] displayed throughout the Bible they're
[54:47] all throughout the Bible there's nothing
[54:48] new
[54:49] but when brother Branham coins it first
[54:52] pull second pull in third pool he was
[54:55] directly pointing it to the ministry
[54:58] that the Lord had given him and others
[55:01] that have gone on before him amen and so
[55:04] when we say the first pull or the second
[55:07] pool or the third pool that's a it's a
[55:10] lot that goes into that and to be like
[55:13] if you ask me whether Israel what is the
[55:15] Holy Ghost
[55:17] well that's a very big uh that's a very
[55:20] big conversation to have
[55:22] because the Holy Ghost
[55:24] encompasses the adoption it encompasses
[55:28] justification
[55:30] so justification a man could still be
[55:33] smoking cigarettes living in the world
[55:36] and the Holy Ghost can still be working
[55:37] with him
[55:39] and then a man has the adoption or the
[55:42] placing in his life God is still working
[55:45] with him with the same Holy Ghost that's
[55:47] quite a range a man preaching In a
[55:50] Pulpit and a man smoking cigarettes or
[55:52] drinking alcohol or whatever but it's
[55:54] still the working of the Holy Ghost so
[55:57] the point is there's a lot that goes
[55:59] into it we say the Holy Ghost we're talk
[56:02] what holy ghosts are we talking about
[56:03] the realm on the flesh or the realm and
[56:07] the soul is it the Holy Ghost Upon A
[56:09] True Believer is it the Holy Ghost
[56:11] throughout the ages and so there's a a
[56:14] lot that goes with it just like if you
[56:16] say a car or what kind of a car
[56:19] four-cylinder six-cylinder gas diesel
[56:23] sports car or you know a soccer mom's
[56:27] car what kind of car are we talking
[56:29] about because we know they're not all
[56:31] the same
[56:32] they all have different purposes right
[56:34] and when you say a man even talking
[56:38] about a man what kind of man are you
[56:40] talking about a saved man an old man a
[56:43] young man is he 30 is he 60 what kind of
[56:46] man are we talking about so when we talk
[56:49] about the third pool or we talk about
[56:51] the Holy Ghost it's a very big subject
[56:54] to cover
[56:55] and there's a lot that goes to it and
[56:58] it's only going to be interesting to you
[57:00] when you can see yourself in it
[57:04] amen
[57:05] and we all have a part in it amen
[57:09] amen all right so this
[57:11] uh great testimony here in day one with
[57:15] our lord Jesus he tests Philip with the
[57:19] question the Bible says that he knew all
[57:22] along what was going to take place
[57:24] he sees this large crowd of people
[57:27] coming to him and he asked Philip the
[57:29] question where shall we buy bread and
[57:32] food for all of these people
[57:34] now he knows they ain't got enough money
[57:36] to buy it
[57:38] he knows he can't uh uh so there's no
[57:41] place to buy the food but he'll pose a
[57:44] question
[57:45] you have to catch what he's trying to do
[57:48] and what he's trying to say and so he
[57:50] asked this question he sees a great
[57:52] company there he's setting it up because
[57:55] he knew what he was going to do and then
[57:58] another disciple gets involved and
[58:00] that's Andrew and he he somehow finds a
[58:03] little boy with two with two small
[58:06] fishes and five barley loaves
[58:10] he just finds him he's not like the Lord
[58:13] didn't say hey pick that little boy out
[58:15] no he let them he poses the question and
[58:18] then now the the dynamic of how we're
[58:20] going to feed all these people they're
[58:22] coming out here to hear you how are we
[58:24] going to do all of this and the Lord is
[58:26] setting it up
[58:27] he's setting up a blessing
[58:31] and I think he might be setting one up
[58:33] for you too
[58:37] it's usually surrounded around some
[58:40] question in your life
[58:42] some direction some point of reference
[58:45] in your life where you are today let me
[58:49] say this here in a hundred years none of
[58:52] us will be here
[58:57] a hundred years from today everybody's
[58:59] sitting in here will not be here if time
[59:02] just goes on
[59:03] can I get a witness we all got an
[59:06] appointment to leave from here
[59:08] and and that's really the reality is how
[59:13] much time do I have before I leave from
[59:17] here
[59:18] now you have plans in your life I do you
[59:22] do we all have plans in our life of what
[59:24] we're going to do tomorrow but we don't
[59:26] know what tomorrow holds
[59:29] and things can change in just a moment's
[59:32] time here it is day one and the
[59:35] multitudes are coming to him he needs an
[59:38] answer to feed all of these people he
[59:41] asked him a question a little boy just
[59:43] happens to bring a couple fish a couple
[59:47] breads
[59:49] for a sandwich Maybe
[59:52] looked like it was just enough for him
[59:55] somehow I like this boy
[59:58] fish sandwich
[1:00:00] so they grabbed this young boy out of
[1:00:02] the crowd
[1:00:04] he's like what did I do wrong now
[1:00:07] what you got in that lunch pail young
[1:00:09] man
[1:00:10] well don't you don't even want to know
[1:00:11] my name we don't need to know your name
[1:00:13] what you got in that lunch Bell
[1:00:16] give me your lunch man
[1:00:19] they take the boys lunch from him
[1:00:23] in his hands it was just a meal maybe
[1:00:26] his mom and dad gave to him
[1:00:29] I think one place brother Madam said he
[1:00:30] skipped school
[1:00:33] he he probably was thought he was in
[1:00:35] trouble but the Lord the the disciples
[1:00:38] take his lunch from him and
[1:00:41] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:45] jesus takes this bread and his fish and
[1:00:49] he tells his disciples to go order the
[1:00:51] people to sit down put them all in order
[1:00:54] five thousand of them sediment company
[1:00:55] he gives thanks over the bread he gives
[1:00:59] thanks over the fish and he begins to
[1:01:01] give it to his disciples so he's over
[1:01:03] here he blessed it and he just turned
[1:01:06] around give us to the disciples and the
[1:01:08] disciples run and give it to the people
[1:01:10] and he's doing this for quite some time
[1:01:12] you can imagine 5 000 people
[1:01:17] if something else is going on here
[1:01:20] you know when people you know how before
[1:01:22] people eat you know how they chat
[1:01:24] and then after everybody get their food
[1:01:26] how they stop talking
[1:01:29] and then after you stop talking
[1:01:30] everybody's fooled and you start talking
[1:01:32] again
[1:01:33] you start looking around
[1:01:35] like where did all this food come from
[1:01:39] 5 000 people ain't nobody got nothing to
[1:01:42] eat but this boy
[1:01:44] so he takes it from the crowd blesses it
[1:01:48] and then gives it back to the crowd this
[1:01:50] is your Bible
[1:01:52] and this is in day one and so this great
[1:01:55] miracle takes place he's the disciples
[1:01:57] are Distributing in it the people they
[1:02:01] are they all had plenty to eat and then
[1:02:04] I want you to add this up in your math
[1:02:07] class you that go to school you got 5
[1:02:11] 000 hungry people two fish five loaves
[1:02:15] of bread Everybody Eats and when we're
[1:02:18] done we got 12 full baskets left over
[1:02:23] brother Joe give me the equation to help
[1:02:25] me work this one out
[1:02:27] what kind of math what kind of gr what
[1:02:30] kind of trigger number what kind of a
[1:02:32] math is this we have more at the end
[1:02:36] than what we came in with
[1:02:39] it's because they gave what they had to
[1:02:43] the right man
[1:02:44] and the man that had the power to
[1:02:47] multiply what they had he made it bigger
[1:02:51] better greater than they could ever
[1:02:54] imagine
[1:02:56] it was something they had never seen
[1:02:58] before
[1:02:59] it was a miracle that was going to blow
[1:03:02] their mind something that that never had
[1:03:04] happened before was now taking place and
[1:03:08] they'll never ever forget this one
[1:03:10] right
[1:03:12] this is how the Lord does it
[1:03:15] he's setting it up very gratefully
[1:03:18] after this great Mass the Great Master
[1:03:21] did this great miracle before the people
[1:03:24] here's what the conclusion of the matter
[1:03:27] is in Saint John 6
[1:03:29] 20 right in there 19 or 20. the
[1:03:32] conclusion of the matter is that all the
[1:03:35] people said this is a prophet
[1:03:38] and not only is this a Prophet this is
[1:03:42] that Prophet That was supposed to come
[1:03:45] to the world that's what they said in
[1:03:47] day one
[1:03:48] they were going to grab him make him a
[1:03:51] king grab him make him a ruler grab him
[1:03:55] and force him to take ownership and
[1:03:59] Jesus took off he got wind of it he
[1:04:00] perceived it and he took off to a
[1:04:02] mountain and hid from the crowd the
[1:04:05] meantime the disciples jump into the
[1:04:07] boat
[1:04:08] uh the the Bible says that the winds and
[1:04:11] waves they were waiting for Jesus he
[1:04:13] didn't come it got dark it was late at
[1:04:15] night they jump into the boat the winds
[1:04:18] and the wave start to kick up a storm
[1:04:21] they they uh travel eight furlongs uh
[1:04:26] about a mile about four miles or so
[1:04:30] that they traveled on the sea the
[1:04:34] scriptures were very clear how far they
[1:04:35] were off into the water away from the
[1:04:39] sea Bank there and here comes Jesus
[1:04:41] walking on the water
[1:04:44] and then they invite him into the boat
[1:04:47] immediately after they invite him into
[1:04:49] the boat they're back on land again
[1:04:52] tremendous Miracle wasn't it
[1:04:55] right Saints
[1:04:57] how many Saints here know this is the
[1:04:58] word Saint John chapter 6.
[1:05:01] and here he is now they're questioning
[1:05:06] where where were you the the other crowd
[1:05:09] they're on the other side of the of the
[1:05:12] sea now and they can see that the the
[1:05:14] disciples aren't there and Jesus isn't
[1:05:16] there so the Bible says that they hire
[1:05:19] other ships from Tiberius to go to
[1:05:22] Capernaum across the river across the
[1:05:26] sea to get where Jesus was that's what
[1:05:28] they did
[1:05:29] scripture says so they finally ketchup
[1:05:32] to them and they start to ask him these
[1:05:35] questions again
[1:05:37] this is day two now
[1:05:40] they're on the other side
[1:05:44] they took up shipping from to Capernaum
[1:05:47] St John 6 24.
[1:05:49] Jesus they uh they they started asking
[1:05:53] him questions where were you what's
[1:05:55] going on and Jesus says you sought me
[1:05:57] not because of the miracle but you
[1:06:00] sought me because of the fishes in the
[1:06:02] Loaves and he he gives his first
[1:06:04] statement there he says labor not for
[1:06:07] meat natural but labor for the meat that
[1:06:11] is spiritual and say that to you this
[1:06:13] morning there is a natural concern that
[1:06:17] we all have here today
[1:06:19] in our own life as I said a hundred
[1:06:22] years from today
[1:06:23] none of us will be here 50 years from
[1:06:26] today a good portion of us won't be here
[1:06:28] 30 years from today there's a little
[1:06:31] smaller portion but I know for sure
[1:06:33] unless some great great miracle happens
[1:06:36] a hundred years from today you are not
[1:06:39] going to be here but you're going to be
[1:06:40] somewhere
[1:06:44] and our existence will continue on
[1:06:47] somewhere
[1:06:50] and so the time now is really the time
[1:06:54] the answer the questions where will I be
[1:06:56] in a hundred years from today what does
[1:07:00] my future look like really
[1:07:03] and isn't that important what I'm
[1:07:05] stressing over today
[1:07:07] because in the end it's all going to be
[1:07:09] over whatever you're going through right
[1:07:11] now it has the expiration date
[1:07:15] that's right
[1:07:16] that's exactly right
[1:07:18] it's a test it's the trial but it comes
[1:07:22] so it can go
[1:07:24] and then other things happen and life
[1:07:27] continues on and Jesus begins to tell
[1:07:30] the disciples that don't labor for
[1:07:33] natural things but labor for the Eternal
[1:07:36] things
[1:07:39] and then they ask him this question well
[1:07:41] Master what shall we do that we can work
[1:07:45] the works of God
[1:07:48] what can we do to do the works like what
[1:07:51] we just saw you do yesterday
[1:07:54] and what we heard about you did with
[1:07:56] walking on the water what can we do to
[1:07:59] work the works of God and Jesus says
[1:08:01] this is the work of God
[1:08:04] is to believe on him whom God has sent
[1:08:13] I wonder if we can believe on him whom
[1:08:15] God has sent
[1:08:17] sometimes we want to do more for God we
[1:08:20] want to do more for the kingdom we want
[1:08:22] to do something and the the the man
[1:08:25] always is trying to save himself so he's
[1:08:29] constantly looking for some works that
[1:08:31] he can do to make him a good man or a
[1:08:33] good girl but there is no good man in
[1:08:36] the sight of God there is no good girls
[1:08:39] in the sight of God because he's the
[1:08:42] only thing that is good
[1:08:45] and unless he put his hands on your life
[1:08:47] you can never be good
[1:08:49] and you can never rise up above from
[1:08:52] where you are unless God comes into your
[1:08:56] pathway and crosses up with you and find
[1:09:00] you somehow some way to make things a
[1:09:03] little bit different for you
[1:09:05] and when he comes into your life more
[1:09:08] questions will come but he's got all the
[1:09:12] answers
[1:09:13] for the questions in your life
[1:09:17] and he tells them to believe on him whom
[1:09:19] God has sent
[1:09:21] and it seems like a simple thing to do
[1:09:24] but it's very difficult to believe in
[1:09:27] what God has done who God has sent
[1:09:31] it's it's been the challenge throughout
[1:09:34] all of your Bible references all of the
[1:09:37] prophets all of the great moves of God
[1:09:39] they've had the people have had a
[1:09:42] challenge to believe even Moses believe
[1:09:44] John the Baptist Ezekiel Isaiah many of
[1:09:48] the prophets it's a great challenge to
[1:09:50] believe what they're saying is true
[1:09:55] he gives them this quotation
[1:09:58] that
[1:09:59] I am the bread of God and the bread of
[1:10:03] God is he which Cometh From Heaven
[1:10:09] so they're asking him
[1:10:11] show us a sign and our fathers in the
[1:10:15] Old Testament in the wilderness Moses
[1:10:17] gave them bread that was a sign Moses
[1:10:20] fed the children of Israel can can you
[1:10:22] show us a sign he says I am the bread of
[1:10:24] God he says first he says the bread of
[1:10:27] God is he that comes down from heaven
[1:10:29] then he says I am the bread of God that
[1:10:31] cometh down from heaven
[1:10:34] so is his discourse is getting a little
[1:10:37] bit deeper
[1:10:38] it's going a little bit further he went
[1:10:41] from the signs the Wonders the miracle
[1:10:45] now he's going into some teaching areas
[1:10:48] he's going into identifying who he is in
[1:10:51] the scripture
[1:10:53] and you know to be honest for those of
[1:10:57] us who have come into the message and
[1:10:59] heard the signs wonders and miracles if
[1:11:02] we be honest the the probability of the
[1:11:05] flashiest part about the message are the
[1:11:08] Miracles
[1:11:10] that's the that's what tickles our ear
[1:11:12] that to hear about some woman getting
[1:11:15] delivered of cancer or some paralytic
[1:11:18] receiving strength in their body
[1:11:21] but that's really just on the bottom of
[1:11:23] what God wants to do the highest order
[1:11:27] is for God to speak to you the highest
[1:11:31] order is for his word to come alive to
[1:11:34] you
[1:11:34] because that will never go away
[1:11:38] you know a man can get cancer today and
[1:11:41] be healed tomorrow and then die of
[1:11:43] cancer 10 years down the road
[1:11:46] did you know that people get healed of
[1:11:48] all kind of diseases and ailments and
[1:11:51] then years later they get sick again
[1:11:54] they get hurt again
[1:11:57] they have problems again
[1:11:59] but when a man gets a revelation of who
[1:12:02] Jesus Christ is that will endure when
[1:12:07] he's in his 50s in his 60s in his 80s
[1:12:11] what he's got to cross over to the other
[1:12:14] land the Revelation in his heart will
[1:12:17] never leave from him
[1:12:19] so what's the highest order
[1:12:24] if I were to ask you would you like to
[1:12:26] see a miracle today of course we all do
[1:12:31] but what do you need more to see a
[1:12:34] miracle or to become a miracle
[1:12:38] Hallelujah
[1:12:40] when the word of God opens up in your
[1:12:43] soul you become a miracle
[1:12:47] now you see things you never saw before
[1:12:51] amen
[1:12:53] I'm not discrediting Miracles I believe
[1:12:55] in them
[1:12:56] I need one I'm looking for him always
[1:13:00] but the highest order is for God to
[1:13:03] reveal this word and here Jesus is
[1:13:05] walking them as we would say into a
[1:13:07] corner
[1:13:09] I mean it looks like
[1:13:10] if it was a boxing match he's just
[1:13:13] body blow body blow body blow walking
[1:13:17] them into the corner
[1:13:19] and he's got a knockout punch for him
[1:13:23] if I were to express it that way you all
[1:13:25] excuse me
[1:13:26] and here he is
[1:13:28] The Works of God is is to do the will of
[1:13:31] God to believe on him on God's sin the
[1:13:34] bread of God is he who came down from
[1:13:36] heaven
[1:13:37] then I am the bread of God then he goes
[1:13:40] further and he says don't murmur that I
[1:13:43] said that I'm the bread
[1:13:45] but I am the living bread he says it
[1:13:47] again
[1:13:51] he knows you're struggling
[1:13:55] and what he's saying
[1:13:57] remember they wanted to make him a king
[1:13:59] yesterday
[1:14:01] today they're struggling with his
[1:14:02] quotations
[1:14:07] so now they're he's moving into showing
[1:14:10] him that he's the bread he says I will
[1:14:13] give you my flesh
[1:14:15] to eat
[1:14:17] for in my flesh there is life
[1:14:20] and he says how can you give us your
[1:14:22] flesh he said except you eat the Flesh
[1:14:25] of the son of man and drink his blood
[1:14:30] you have no life in you Saint John 6 53.
[1:14:34] now he was in the synagogue when he said
[1:14:36] this
[1:14:37] when he says this the disciples around
[1:14:40] him there's a large group of them that
[1:14:42] said to themselves this is a harsh hand
[1:14:44] this is hard this is a little it's a
[1:14:47] little too much I like the healing part
[1:14:49] I like the walking on the water part I
[1:14:51] like the loaves in the fishes part
[1:14:53] eating your flesh and drinking your
[1:14:55] blood that's a little hard but this is
[1:14:57] the same Jesus
[1:14:59] and he's moving on he's moving up from
[1:15:02] the first phase to a second phase and
[1:15:05] then the second phase over into his
[1:15:07] third phase he's got something to tell
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] he's got something to share with you and
[1:15:15] so
[1:15:15] the conclusion is many of his disciples
[1:15:19] went back and walked with him no more
[1:15:23] then Jesus looks to his disciples 12.
[1:15:28] and he asked this question the title of
[1:15:31] our message this morning
[1:15:33] will you also go away
[1:15:39] he lost a lot already Jesus did looks
[1:15:42] like it
[1:15:44] do you think Jesus's feelings was hurt
[1:15:48] on The Human Side probably yeah
[1:15:51] you lose friends you lose people that
[1:15:53] have confidence in you you lose people
[1:15:55] that wanted you to be a king yesterday
[1:15:59] then you drop all the way down to I
[1:16:01] don't know what you're talking about man
[1:16:03] this is too much
[1:16:06] you're going off on the deep end now
[1:16:09] and you know he took two fishes and Five
[1:16:13] Loaves do you think he could have did it
[1:16:14] with one fish
[1:16:16] and one loaf
[1:16:18] do you think he could have did it with
[1:16:19] no fish and no loaves
[1:16:23] he just took that boy's list to show you
[1:16:25] it don't matter
[1:16:27] yeah
[1:16:28] I can take it if you give it to me I'll
[1:16:31] bless it if you give it to me I'll bless
[1:16:34] it if you keep it yourself you'll be
[1:16:36] you'll be you'll be hindered you'll be
[1:16:39] insufficient you'll never come to your
[1:16:41] com you never come to the place that God
[1:16:43] called you try to work it out yourself
[1:16:45] you'll come up lost you'll come up
[1:16:49] short-handed but if you give it to me
[1:16:53] ain't no blessing like the Lord's
[1:16:55] blessing on your life
[1:16:58] God begins to bless you he'll multiply
[1:17:01] you
[1:17:02] and where do you where do you want God
[1:17:04] to multiply you
[1:17:05] can I take 15 more minutes Saints what
[1:17:08] do you want God to multiply you
[1:17:10] huh
[1:17:11] under the first pool second pool or the
[1:17:14] third pool
[1:17:15] really though
[1:17:17] what do you want God to multiply you I
[1:17:19] want God to multiply my understanding of
[1:17:22] his word
[1:17:24] I want him to open up the book to me
[1:17:27] I want him to make it real to me
[1:17:30] not just I can argue it but I can live
[1:17:33] it and become the word that he sent in
[1:17:37] this day
[1:17:38] it's a beautiful word isn't it
[1:17:41] and there's a lot that goes with it
[1:17:43] um
[1:17:44] will you also go away
[1:17:49] now
[1:17:50] in this
[1:17:52] first second and third pool
[1:17:57] as brother random is talking about it
[1:17:59] here he takes a span of
[1:18:03] it gets eight and a half years eight
[1:18:05] years seven months from when he first
[1:18:07] mentions the third pool in 1956 January
[1:18:10] 1956
[1:18:12] until in 1965 and he he shares many
[1:18:16] things in that eight year span like I
[1:18:18] said when you talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:18:20] or a human being or automobile there's a
[1:18:23] lot that goes with it
[1:18:24] we're just taking out a few of the
[1:18:26] Highlight points because we know that
[1:18:30] the third pool is a promise
[1:18:32] that's a promise to the believer and
[1:18:35] that's that's the land of promise let's
[1:18:38] look at it like that
[1:18:40] there's promises in the word that is the
[1:18:44] territory that belongs to the believer
[1:18:46] that we want to inherit
[1:18:49] and we need a certain maturity level
[1:18:51] before we can have some of these uh uh
[1:18:54] promises revealed to us
[1:18:57] we want the power to create how many
[1:19:00] want that
[1:19:01] he said I promise Lord I wouldn't change
[1:19:04] if I had the power to create I promise I
[1:19:06] would change
[1:19:09] it's like if I if I want 10 million
[1:19:12] dollars I promise all y'all will still
[1:19:13] be my friends
[1:19:16] I wouldn't Chase I promise I wouldn't
[1:19:18] change you say that
[1:19:21] but when you go into the bank and you
[1:19:23] see all those zeros behind the one
[1:19:29] you might have to get some more friends
[1:19:33] because your friend the friends here
[1:19:35] ain't living like that you think you
[1:19:37] would you stay the same we say that but
[1:19:39] we've never been there so let's be
[1:19:41] honest you don't know if you would
[1:19:42] change or not
[1:19:45] can y'all be honest with me this morning
[1:19:48] how do you know if you became a
[1:19:49] multi-millionaire that it's possible
[1:19:52] that you would change
[1:19:54] so that's just being honest
[1:19:56] because you you thinking broke man
[1:19:59] thoughts now
[1:20:01] when you when you become a millionaire
[1:20:03] you don't think like broke men think no
[1:20:06] more
[1:20:07] so let's be honest
[1:20:11] I have to wrestle with this myself I
[1:20:13] don't know Lord I know I want to change
[1:20:14] no I wouldn't change but I realized I
[1:20:17] don't know what happens hey man because
[1:20:19] you don't know what you would do with
[1:20:21] the power that was given to you you
[1:20:23] think that every Minister every man can
[1:20:26] have the character to handle the spoken
[1:20:30] word power
[1:20:33] foreign
[1:20:36] just be honest with ourselves
[1:20:40] and this is why we got to lay on our
[1:20:42] face before God
[1:20:44] Lord don't bring something on me that I
[1:20:46] can't handle
[1:20:48] I think I want that but if it's gonna
[1:20:50] mess me up in my mind then don't let it
[1:20:53] come my way
[1:20:54] don't bless me with something that's
[1:20:56] gonna curse me later on just let me stay
[1:21:00] in your hands Lord
[1:21:02] amen
[1:21:04] mm-hmm
[1:21:07] and so this
[1:21:09] this third pool will look at it as the
[1:21:12] land a land of promise that is to us to
[1:21:15] the believer
[1:21:17] in eight years and seven months brother
[1:21:18] random is talking about different
[1:21:20] aspects of it
[1:21:23] interesting interestingly
[1:21:28] in Revelations chapter 13 I like
[1:21:31] Revelation chapter eight I'd like you to
[1:21:33] read a scripture with me there and verse
[1:21:35] number one
[1:21:37] Prophet is going to be going into the
[1:21:41] greatest message of his life was the
[1:21:44] revelation of the set a little warm in
[1:21:45] here
[1:21:49] but it's better than outside
[1:21:52] maybe I think so
[1:21:55] Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 and when he
[1:21:57] had opened the seventh seal there was
[1:21:59] silence in heaven about the space of
[1:22:03] half an hour brother Branham takes this
[1:22:06] scripture
[1:22:07] as he's bringing the revelation of the
[1:22:10] seventh seal
[1:22:11] here's part of what he says here about
[1:22:15] that seven seal go into the message the
[1:22:18] revelation of the seven seal paragraph
[1:22:21] two
[1:22:23] 42. he's talking about this hour of half
[1:22:26] an hour of Silence
[1:22:29] there's a reason why God doesn't reveal
[1:22:31] things all at one time
[1:22:33] there's a reason why you think you want
[1:22:35] the answer right now but he don't give
[1:22:37] you the answer right now there's a lot
[1:22:39] of you know dark things that he'll he'll
[1:22:42] withhold from you I think of Joseph and
[1:22:45] Jacob Jacob loved his son Joseph and
[1:22:47] Joseph was sold as a slave down in Egypt
[1:22:51] and his brothers came back and said he
[1:22:53] was dead and that man went through the
[1:22:55] funeral service in years of rejection
[1:22:59] because his son Joseph had died
[1:23:01] prematurely and God up above looking at
[1:23:05] Jacob grieve for years but his son was
[1:23:09] alive all along in prison down in Egypt
[1:23:12] and God never opened Jacob's eyes he
[1:23:15] heard it it hurt his heart he went down
[1:23:18] almost to the Grave with that sorrow and
[1:23:21] that grief and God never showed him more
[1:23:24] until it was time for Joseph to reveal
[1:23:29] himself to his brothers that night the
[1:23:32] very night they were coming to tell
[1:23:34] Jacob the Lord comes to him in a dream
[1:23:36] say by the way son
[1:23:39] tomorrow you'll get good news your son
[1:23:42] really is a lie it's like Lord why could
[1:23:45] you just show me that
[1:23:47] well he couldn't get the part that you
[1:23:50] have to play out of it if he would have
[1:23:52] showed you that he had to let you go
[1:23:54] through that and let you grieve and go
[1:23:56] through all of that to bring out another
[1:23:58] promise working up over here and God
[1:24:01] works that way in secrecy
[1:24:04] he opens up some of his word today and
[1:24:07] then he'll reveal it back from you
[1:24:10] that's how he operates doesn't tell you
[1:24:13] the whole story in the beginning because
[1:24:16] he's got to bring out characteristics in
[1:24:19] your life got to develop a prayer life
[1:24:21] in you he's got to develop patience in
[1:24:24] you he wants you to be a real son or
[1:24:26] daughter of God
[1:24:31] there's some things you can't Google
[1:24:35] all right you got to pray it in way to
[1:24:36] steal you don't got the answer you gotta
[1:24:38] wait on no more
[1:24:40] and trust him and believe him and know
[1:24:44] that God's gonna work it out for you
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:51] so look at this seven seal
[1:24:54] John couldn't even write it paragraph
[1:24:56] 240. no he was forbidden to write here
[1:25:01] so you see he didn't write it but this
[1:25:04] is silence in the Four and Twenty Elders
[1:25:06] that stood before God they're harping
[1:25:08] with their Harps they quit playing their
[1:25:10] Harps the Angels Hustler singing in
[1:25:12] heaven think the holy cherubims and
[1:25:15] seraphims that Isaiah saw in the temple
[1:25:19] three sets of wings two over their face
[1:25:22] two over the feet flying day and night
[1:25:24] they were before God singing Holy hope
[1:25:26] no Praises no altar Services no nothing
[1:25:31] there was silence hush deadly silence in
[1:25:35] the book of redemption was broken up
[1:25:37] think of it
[1:25:39] it's broke the lamb breaks it
[1:25:43] you know what they were awed by it I
[1:25:45] believe they didn't know there it was
[1:25:47] they just stopped you're right about it
[1:25:51] even write a symbol about it why this is
[1:25:54] why there was no activity in heaven it
[1:25:58] might give away the secret do you see it
[1:26:00] now
[1:26:01] if it's so great it must be included
[1:26:03] because it's got to happen but when the
[1:26:06] seven Thunders now notice when the seven
[1:26:08] angels come forth to sound their
[1:26:11] trumpets there was one Thunder
[1:26:14] the man knocks on the pulpit once when
[1:26:16] Israel was gathered there was one truck
[1:26:18] there was a trumpet time shall be no
[1:26:20] more the last trumpet one Thunder but
[1:26:22] here are seven straight Thunders right
[1:26:24] in a row one two three four five six
[1:26:26] seven that perfect number seven thunders
[1:26:29] in a row uttered making one two three
[1:26:33] four five six seven
[1:26:35] a hold of it he might do great damage
[1:26:39] there's one thing he don't know now he
[1:26:42] can interpret anything he wants to and
[1:26:45] impersonate any kind of a gift I hope
[1:26:48] you're learning but he can't know this
[1:26:54] it's not even written in the word
[1:26:57] Church Say Amen
[1:27:00] it's a total Secret
[1:27:04] you know that's amazing how some people
[1:27:06] think they know what it is too
[1:27:09] let me think I think I know what it is
[1:27:10] let me think let me think
[1:27:13] he hit hit your head make the thoughts
[1:27:15] come faster right
[1:27:17] let me think let me think
[1:27:20] I think I know what it is no you don't
[1:27:22] know what it is
[1:27:24] no man knows what it is
[1:27:28] Satan doesn't know what it is
[1:27:32] so when you hear somebody preaching
[1:27:33] saying they know what it is
[1:27:36] what you gonna do
[1:27:38] pray for him
[1:27:41] don't get mad at them pray for him
[1:27:46] you say you should get a hold of it but
[1:27:48] he can't know this it's not even written
[1:27:50] in the word it's a total secret the
[1:27:53] Angels everything shut up if they made
[1:27:56] one move it might give something away
[1:27:58] they just shut up quit harping
[1:28:01] everything
[1:28:04] stopped oh my
[1:28:07] what was that other quote I gave you
[1:28:09] there says in the seventh seal
[1:28:12] yes here it is
[1:28:14] paragraph 258 continuing on in this uh
[1:28:18] seven seal if you want something to
[1:28:19] happen uh you have to take my word for
[1:28:21] this if I'm planning on the line tell
[1:28:23] everybody everything
[1:28:25] and I've tried I tell you I tell people
[1:28:26] I'll do a certain certain thing and
[1:28:28] watch the devil cut off every will he
[1:28:30] can to get there see to beat me to it
[1:28:32] but if I can get the Revelation from God
[1:28:34] and just don't say nothing about it then
[1:28:37] it's different
[1:28:40] now where are we at we're in Revelations
[1:28:41] chapter 8 verse 1 right the half an hour
[1:28:44] of Silence remember Satan will try to
[1:28:48] impersonate
[1:28:49] he will try to impersonate everything
[1:28:52] that the church will do he's tried to do
[1:28:55] it we notice it through the Antichrist
[1:28:57] but this is one for him to know it it's
[1:29:02] the third pool
[1:29:04] he just knows nothing about it see he
[1:29:07] does it understand it
[1:29:10] but there's a secret lace beneath that
[1:29:14] so what scripture did I just read there
[1:29:16] Revelations 8 verse 1 half an hour of
[1:29:20] Silence it was silent for a purpose for
[1:29:22] a reason to withhold the great mystery
[1:29:25] of the coming of the Lord in the last
[1:29:27] day final
[1:29:29] the last day close up of all things a
[1:29:31] seal up of everything
[1:29:33] there's a great Secret in there that we
[1:29:36] don't know none of us know we try to
[1:29:39] know we and and Satan will impersonate
[1:29:41] it he'll go he'll go he'll get quotes on
[1:29:44] and he'll try to come up with the answer
[1:29:45] through quotes
[1:29:48] he'll try to go through any kind of
[1:29:49] means to come up and ask me to find my
[1:29:53] place in these things
[1:29:55] all right
[1:29:58] let's take my time is always I got 15
[1:30:00] more minutes my time is almost gone but
[1:30:03] y'all sang a little long so
[1:30:06] help me out here a little bit
[1:30:09] as far as I know paragraph number 16
[1:30:11] present stage of my Ministry brother
[1:30:13] Madam says this here as far as I know
[1:30:17] that every Vision that he's ever given
[1:30:20] me has been fulfilled except the one
[1:30:22] that I'm the change in my Ministry to
[1:30:24] where I'm to pray for people in a little
[1:30:26] place like a little room under a tent or
[1:30:29] a big Auditorium
[1:30:31] or something that looked like to me like
[1:30:33] a tent remember that two or three years
[1:30:36] ago right and what would take place down
[1:30:38] there and he told me my Ministry of the
[1:30:42] first poor remember about catching the
[1:30:44] little bitty fish and missing it second
[1:30:46] one was small fish but then he told me
[1:30:48] on the third pool don't fail see
[1:30:51] heightened up in the room a little bit
[1:30:54] I like that when that happens when all
[1:30:57] right everybody ain't smiling
[1:30:59] that's all right but it but but it
[1:31:02] continues on in the message Look Away to
[1:31:05] Jesus this is a year later so let it
[1:31:07] develop
[1:31:09] he says
[1:31:10] I have come to a place in my Ministry to
[1:31:12] where I have to say something in
[1:31:14] paragraph 27 Jesus said
[1:31:18] that what he heard that was what he
[1:31:21] spoke and he said I called you my
[1:31:23] friends and a friend tells his friends
[1:31:26] all things listen Look Away to Jesus
[1:31:29] 1963 continues on
[1:31:33] says this here
[1:31:36] now you all love the Lord
[1:31:39] so now I'm going to say something to you
[1:31:41] paragraph 38. now that I've said all
[1:31:43] along and
[1:31:45] that is the thing that we've looked
[1:31:46] forward to for so long for as least many
[1:31:50] years four or five years or maybe longer
[1:31:52] the third pool has now been Vindicated
[1:31:56] and I'm sure you all know what it is
[1:32:00] now remember
[1:32:01] there will be never be an impersonation
[1:32:04] of that because it can't be see it
[1:32:07] cannot be now it's in existence and I
[1:32:10] have warned of this that soon right at
[1:32:13] this time
[1:32:14] is now it's just happened so it could
[1:32:17] identify its presence among you see but
[1:32:20] it will not be used in a great way until
[1:32:22] the council begins to tighten up when it
[1:32:25] does when that does the Pentecostals and
[1:32:28] so forth can almost impersonate anything
[1:32:30] can be done
[1:32:31] but when that time comes when the
[1:32:33] squeeze comes down then you'll see what
[1:32:35] you've seen temporarily be manifested in
[1:32:38] the fullness of his power see see see
[1:32:41] now I must continue in evangelism I want
[1:32:44] to stop here just a moment now remember
[1:32:46] he says that it can't be impersonated so
[1:32:49] this bypasses all of First Corinthians
[1:32:52] 13 and 14 in First Corinthians 12 all
[1:32:55] the gifts all of the other gifts of the
[1:32:58] Spirit nine spiritual gifts Satan can
[1:33:00] impersonate any gift any inspiration
[1:33:04] anything he can impersonate but he can't
[1:33:06] know this
[1:33:08] so this is exclusive from anything else
[1:33:12] any other gift he can't impersonate he
[1:33:15] can't know this he'll try but he can't
[1:33:17] impersonate this
[1:33:18] do I have a prayer in church here this
[1:33:20] morning for you have had the word you
[1:33:23] know what to look for how to stand I
[1:33:26] must continue on in evangelism and
[1:33:29] Friends of Mines keep still just keep
[1:33:32] moving on for the hour is approaching
[1:33:35] swiftly what hour
[1:33:38] see that when something is going to be
[1:33:41] done
[1:33:42] now you might see some little odd things
[1:33:44] happen for me nothing sinful I don't
[1:33:47] mean but I mean something odd to the
[1:33:49] regular Trend because where I reach now
[1:33:51] in the ministry I'm dropping back here
[1:33:53] watching the spot watching that spot and
[1:33:56] waiting for the time to use it but it's
[1:33:58] going to be used
[1:34:01] and everyone knows that for as certain
[1:34:03] as the first was identified so has the
[1:34:06] second been identified
[1:34:08] we know where it is so the third pool is
[1:34:13] here
[1:34:15] it's so sacred that I mustn't say much
[1:34:18] about it
[1:34:19] as he told me in the beginning said this
[1:34:22] say nothing of it you remember that
[1:34:24] years ago
[1:34:26] it speaks for itself
[1:34:29] see but I've tried to explain the others
[1:34:32] and I made a mistake this will be the
[1:34:35] thing that to my opinion I don't say the
[1:34:38] Lord tells me this this will be the
[1:34:41] thing that will start the rapturing
[1:34:44] faith for the going away
[1:34:46] see see
[1:34:48] I must lay quiet just for a little while
[1:34:51] and I remember who was listening to this
[1:34:53] tape you might see changing my ministry
[1:34:55] right there is coming a Time upon in
[1:34:58] this nation
[1:34:59] to where this nation is going to
[1:35:02] exercise all the power that the Beast
[1:35:04] had before it which was Pagan Rome would
[1:35:07] it become paparone see that this nation
[1:35:10] will do that Revelations 13 plainly
[1:35:14] explains it the lamb come upon the Earth
[1:35:16] the other beasts come up out of the
[1:35:18] water thickness multitudes of people
[1:35:21] this lamb come up where there were no
[1:35:23] people
[1:35:24] a lamb represents religion the Lamb of
[1:35:27] God remember it spoke
[1:35:30] you have to be in this Council of
[1:35:32] churches or you won't be able to have
[1:35:35] Fellowship
[1:35:37] now this is going to happen Saints
[1:35:41] this is already in the motion to
[1:35:43] happening
[1:35:45] now we're seeing this clearly I've
[1:35:48] always wondered why I have such a an
[1:35:51] attraction to the Holocaust museums when
[1:35:54] I get a chance to go see them it's just
[1:35:56] really strikes me that
[1:35:59] men can do this to other men like to a
[1:36:02] race of people
[1:36:04] and in one of the museums it said there
[1:36:06] were some in one of the plaques that
[1:36:09] says something like this when they
[1:36:10] persecuted the Greek when it persecuted
[1:36:12] the Jews well I was in the Jews so it
[1:36:14] didn't bother me but when they came to
[1:36:16] persecute me there was nobody left to
[1:36:19] help me because everybody was gone
[1:36:22] and that's really looking in the mirror
[1:36:24] you see people act that way well they're
[1:36:27] coming after the Jehovah Witnesses
[1:36:28] whatever that's not us
[1:36:31] they're coming after the enormous
[1:36:32] whatever that's not us they're coming
[1:36:35] after the Baptist well whatever that's
[1:36:37] not us us is next
[1:36:40] right
[1:36:42] now brother random brings it out like
[1:36:44] this and I hope this settles in very
[1:36:47] sweetly into your heart he says that
[1:36:50] that Roman power that caused Hitler to
[1:36:54] do what he did and all the other nations
[1:36:57] stood back and watched this one man go
[1:37:01] crazy against the Jews
[1:37:04] and there's other civil Nations seeing
[1:37:07] it happening from afar act like they
[1:37:09] didn't see it
[1:37:12] but it had to happen and that those
[1:37:15] those are two hundred thousand thousand
[1:37:18] Horsemen were released
[1:37:21] and Hitler released the Mussolini
[1:37:24] released them and they went upon the Jew
[1:37:26] natural
[1:37:28] that's just the highlight of what's
[1:37:30] going to take place to the bride
[1:37:33] spiritual
[1:37:35] now
[1:37:37] this is very very serious
[1:37:40] this is a very very uh uh Awakening time
[1:37:45] this is the hour if I ever was on fire
[1:37:49] for God I should be on fire for God
[1:37:52] today
[1:37:53] if I ever was gonna make a move towards
[1:37:57] his word I need to make that move today
[1:38:01] amen this is the hour this is the time
[1:38:05] listen to the urgency that the prophet
[1:38:08] is giving and as he speaks on this third
[1:38:10] pool and he talks about how this nation
[1:38:13] is going to exercise the power
[1:38:16] to come against
[1:38:18] the true church again
[1:38:22] I mean they're coming against businesses
[1:38:24] now
[1:38:24] you can't do anything righteous or holy
[1:38:27] let somebody some group is going to be
[1:38:29] offended and not just offended they want
[1:38:31] you out of business
[1:38:33] they want to come after you
[1:38:37] I'm not saying something you don't
[1:38:38] already know
[1:38:40] that Spirit has been released we know
[1:38:42] that
[1:38:45] so let me finish this quote and then
[1:38:46] I'll close all right
[1:38:49] it's a tightening
[1:38:52] paragraph 49. paragraph 48 well it's
[1:38:55] practically that way now you can't go to
[1:38:57] a church and preach unless you have a
[1:39:01] fellowship car his brothers already
[1:39:03] doing that to Brothers now
[1:39:05] that's right
[1:39:07] brother George know I'm talking about
[1:39:09] sir
[1:39:10] you can't go and preach in just any
[1:39:12] message Church
[1:39:13] first of all if you preach you out of
[1:39:15] the word will of God anyways some of
[1:39:18] these places
[1:39:19] right
[1:39:21] huh
[1:39:22] it's true that's what's going on right
[1:39:24] now
[1:39:26] and now on purses like ourselves we're
[1:39:29] going to be cut out all of that all
[1:39:31] together that's exactly because they
[1:39:34] won't be able to do it it's tightening
[1:39:37] and then when that time comes and the
[1:39:40] Press comes to a place to where you're
[1:39:43] pressed out they watch what I'm fixing
[1:39:44] to tell you in a few minutes watch
[1:39:48] the third pool who is he talking to
[1:39:53] me he's talking to me and when you read
[1:39:57] it he should be talking to you
[1:39:59] watch the third pool that seems to be I
[1:40:03] don't know when but it's real real close
[1:40:08] I might be building a platform for
[1:40:10] somebody else to step on
[1:40:12] I may be taking before that time I don't
[1:40:15] know that time may be this coming week
[1:40:19] the holy spirit will come and bring
[1:40:22] Christ Jesus
[1:40:24] he may come next week he may come yet
[1:40:27] tonight I don't know when he will come
[1:40:29] he doesn't tell us that
[1:40:32] now
[1:40:35] wow
[1:40:37] what an admonition
[1:40:39] what a word
[1:40:40] that was in um look away to Jesus 1963.
[1:40:46] can I go a little bit further
[1:40:48] look at what the prophet the warning the
[1:40:49] prophet gives in this Feast of the
[1:40:52] trumpet's message
[1:40:54] so he's quoted frady's there it's a
[1:40:56] spiritual place you get a chance to read
[1:40:59] it Revelations chapter 9 verse 13. I'm
[1:41:02] not an interpreter of a scripture the
[1:41:03] prophet is he said what that meant and
[1:41:07] notice what happens under the Sixth
[1:41:09] trumpet they were turned loose on the
[1:41:11] Jews the persecution of the Jews
[1:41:14] Supernatural Devils nearly 2 000 years
[1:41:19] then Loose by Stalin Hitler upon the
[1:41:22] Jews you say well that isn't Roman it's
[1:41:25] the same spirit
[1:41:28] they've done the same things they did to
[1:41:30] the Christians
[1:41:32] so you see them happening to the Jews it
[1:41:35] don't bother you it's the same Spirit
[1:41:38] that's what they did to the Christians
[1:41:42] well I ain't a Jew it ain't bothering me
[1:41:44] you next
[1:41:50] should be sober in the room
[1:41:53] the people there should be Sovereign
[1:41:56] should be the people that's following
[1:41:58] this angel
[1:42:00] this messenger
[1:42:02] amen
[1:42:05] oh that Mercy
[1:42:07] you know this life ain't all we got
[1:42:10] we got to leave here one day
[1:42:12] and I want to be ready
[1:42:14] I'm going to be ready when it's time for
[1:42:16] me to go
[1:42:18] don't you
[1:42:21] paragraph 163 there is that Roman Empire
[1:42:24] bound there by what the ecclesiastical
[1:42:26] Powers which Rome Pagan Rome becomes
[1:42:29] papal Rome was found there in the
[1:42:31] traditions of Christian what part of
[1:42:34] Christian superstitions and how to Rome
[1:42:36] putting it together all these worship of
[1:42:38] women all these other kind of stuff
[1:42:39] Christmas days
[1:42:42] holidays and holy days and things it's
[1:42:44] been bound with the tradition that it
[1:42:46] cannot let loose because it's against
[1:42:48] Christian principles still the same
[1:42:50] ungodly Pagan spirit and that Spirit
[1:42:54] caught into the nations of the world
[1:42:56] according to the Prophecies of his
[1:42:58] vehicle and arrested them
[1:43:00] continue on to paragraph 181
[1:43:02] I'm trying to close right now all right
[1:43:04] paragraph 181 I hope that God
[1:43:08] opens your eyes to this now who's he
[1:43:11] talking to the Branham Tabernacle the
[1:43:13] followers of this message I hope that
[1:43:15] God opens your eyes to this now because
[1:43:18] I realize this is just not speaking to
[1:43:21] this church here this tape goes
[1:43:23] worldwide I don't mean to hurt anybody's
[1:43:26] feelings but just to tell you the truth
[1:43:28] now the ecclesiastical realm has been
[1:43:31] opened from the natural Revival of the
[1:43:34] old Pagan Rome went forth on the Jews
[1:43:36] those Jews which has always been their
[1:43:39] enemy lying with teeth and everything is
[1:43:41] stomped down and broke out the people
[1:43:43] Rome always been God's enemy and it was
[1:43:46] bringing them to a Slaughter just like
[1:43:49] they did the the other and the hour to
[1:43:51] call the bride how Loosely
[1:43:54] ecclesiastical Church Spirit loose upon
[1:43:57] what not upon the denominations upon the
[1:44:01] bride
[1:44:02] here you'll get it the bride will not go
[1:44:05] through that time the Bible says not the
[1:44:09] church Whispers can't you see that
[1:44:11] Brethren so how close are we
[1:44:14] or how many will stay with the word
[1:44:17] Henry can say like the Apostle Peter
[1:44:20] Lord
[1:44:22] to whom shall we go
[1:44:25] for we know
[1:44:27] and we are sure
[1:44:30] that thou
[1:44:31] art the Christ I like to close this
[1:44:35] message and this time I'm closing for
[1:44:37] rear I'm not closing a preacher clothes
[1:44:39] I'm closing closing all right
[1:44:42] what does it mean when the preacher says
[1:44:44] he's getting ready to close
[1:44:46] absolutely nothing
[1:44:49] but I'm closing now and I'd like to
[1:44:51] close with this here in Exodus 23 verses
[1:44:54] 20 through 33.
[1:44:58] this is Israel leaving from
[1:45:01] a great Promised Land
[1:45:04] he's sending them out with the messenger
[1:45:07] or leader to lead the way all right
[1:45:11] if you know this is true Say Amen
[1:45:14] somebody help me preach here all right
[1:45:15] can you help me
[1:45:18] how many is happy
[1:45:20] love the Lord
[1:45:22] look they're out of Junction and and so
[1:45:26] he's calling the people they were slaves
[1:45:28] in Egypt they were you know they did go
[1:45:30] over here go do that go to this where
[1:45:32] you're going to live your name your
[1:45:33] slave number is this this is where y'all
[1:45:35] and then they leave from that in the
[1:45:37] great Exodus and he establishes the laws
[1:45:40] and liberals off but as he's
[1:45:42] commissioning them he lets them know to
[1:45:46] follow this angel
[1:45:49] and he says behold I will send an angel
[1:45:54] before thee
[1:45:56] to keep thee in the way
[1:45:59] and to bring thee into the place which I
[1:46:03] prepared
[1:46:06] so God I will send an angel his angel
[1:46:12] to send you to lead you to a place
[1:46:20] now this message is to encourage your
[1:46:23] heart
[1:46:23] to stick with that Angel's teaching
[1:46:28] and stick with that Angel's leadership
[1:46:31] because the doctrine of the Angel is the
[1:46:35] doctrine of the Lord it was the Lord
[1:46:38] that sent the angel
[1:46:40] and he says Be Be Be fearful of him
[1:46:44] and he will not pardon your
[1:46:46] transgressions but if you if you stick
[1:46:49] with him he'll keep you in the way
[1:46:52] and not only will he keep you in the way
[1:46:54] he'll take you to the place to my place
[1:46:58] that I'm trying to bring you to now we
[1:47:00] are all going somewhere
[1:47:02] every one of us are headed somewhere and
[1:47:05] every one of us is on the journey but
[1:47:07] who is leading you it's the question and
[1:47:11] where are you going
[1:47:13] I'm so glad that God sent an angel in
[1:47:16] this last day to send before me
[1:47:20] that I don't have to go out and try to
[1:47:22] figure it out but I gotta I got a
[1:47:25] message to follow I got a messenger to
[1:47:28] follow and that messenger had an angel
[1:47:31] that led him
[1:47:33] to the place that God wants me to be
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] and therefore
[1:47:42] where can I go
[1:47:44] Lord for you alone have the words
[1:47:48] of eternal life there's a lot of people
[1:47:50] in the park pull you out of this way
[1:47:51] come over here hear this something you
[1:47:54] never heard before come over here see
[1:47:56] this something you never said before
[1:47:57] this brother got a revelation of what
[1:47:59] the third pull is and this one got a
[1:48:00] revelation on the third pool they can't
[1:48:02] know what the third pool is did I read
[1:48:04] the quotes for you did you say Amen to
[1:48:06] him well the quote still said if I read
[1:48:09] it again is it going to change
[1:48:11] so I'm going to stick with the angel
[1:48:13] and the angel is taking me somewhere
[1:48:16] he's taking me to a place
[1:48:19] and what place is that that's the place
[1:48:21] where God wants me to be
[1:48:24] and I believe God wants you to be
[1:48:25] somewhere too
[1:48:27] I pray that you'll find that place God
[1:48:29] bless you let's pray
[1:48:31] Lord Jesus we thank you for your word
[1:48:33] this morning
[1:48:35] we thank you for the admonition Lord as
[1:48:37] I left out some of those warnings of
[1:48:40] persecution to come
[1:48:42] and have we seen it how it looks on the
[1:48:46] natural that persecuted the natives
[1:48:50] and many of those in these European
[1:48:51] countries were persecuted the Romans
[1:48:53] persecuted many of the gypsies you see
[1:48:57] the Africans persecuted
[1:49:00] we've seen the Jews persecuted
[1:49:03] we see so many groups of people it's the
[1:49:06] Roman Spirit that's been
[1:49:08] released out of the river Euphrates
[1:49:12] and there's a tremendous pressure upon
[1:49:15] us today demon powers
[1:49:18] trying to anoint us
[1:49:20] to get out of the way but Lord we want
[1:49:22] to stay in the way that the angel
[1:49:25] has called us to
[1:49:28] that we'll hear that voice will stick
[1:49:31] with that word Lord
[1:49:34] until you call us to the place that you
[1:49:36] want us to be I don't know exactly
[1:49:41] all the details store but
[1:49:43] you've given me the word that I know
[1:49:45] where to stand and how to stand
[1:49:48] Lord you alone have the words of eternal
[1:49:51] life and we see o God that there's some
[1:49:54] flesh eat my drink my blood
[1:49:59] but Lord we know
[1:50:01] where the words of Life are and that's
[1:50:03] where we stand today I encourage the
[1:50:07] people Lord to stay with this message
[1:50:11] stay with the angel that brought it
[1:50:15] to believe it with all of their heart
[1:50:17] Lord and not to
[1:50:20] impose this great ministry
[1:50:24] into the hands of others that were not

[1:58:54] hallelujah amen
[1:58:59] amen
[1:59:01] you know we we certainly think that we
[1:59:04] would
[1:59:05] be able to pass the test if we're put
[1:59:07] under the squeeze I I met this doctor
[1:59:10] here here in the city
[1:59:13] Dr akong a Congo Samson is from Kenya
[1:59:18] and he wrote a little book on his
[1:59:20] persecutions in the Middle East it's an
[1:59:24] African man I sat and had lunch with him
[1:59:25] and he shared his testimony I'm reading
[1:59:28] this book on some of the persecution he
[1:59:29] went through
[1:59:31] and they tortured him so bad in one of
[1:59:34] these uh countries I can't think of I
[1:59:37] can't think of the name of the country
[1:59:38] right now
[1:59:40] that he actually
[1:59:42] recanted and accepted Muhammad as a
[1:59:46] prophet
[1:59:47] he said the pain the torture was so
[1:59:49] great he took these iron bars and ran it
[1:59:51] through his the muscles of his calves
[1:59:54] and turned him upside down
[1:59:56] and and he was beaten I met this man I
[2:00:00] know him and a very humble gentleman
[2:00:02] medical doctor
[2:00:05] and he felt so bad that he actually
[2:00:11] he thought he had it in them they
[2:00:13] squeezed him they squeezed him the pain
[2:00:15] was so great that he
[2:00:17] that he said okay I give up I accept
[2:00:19] Mohammed as a prophet and he said that
[2:00:23] and when they got they gave him
[2:00:25] his freedom sent him out of the country
[2:00:28] he said he lived under that condemnation
[2:00:29] for many many years
[2:00:32] but then God began to heal him and
[2:00:35] strengthen his testimony
[2:00:37] and then I started to think about you
[2:00:40] know the torture and the pain that a man
[2:00:42] would go through
[2:00:43] for for the gospel of the Lord Jesus and
[2:00:46] I I think
[2:00:49] I could take the test
[2:00:52] but there might be something in me that
[2:00:54] might be a little weak
[2:00:57] and I don't want that weakness in me
[2:01:00] I'm just being for real I don't want
[2:01:02] I don't want nothing in me that can
[2:01:04] break
[2:01:06] I want to be faithful to the end
[2:01:10] and you know where that faithfulness
[2:01:11] starts it starts right here
[2:01:14] it starts right here every time I pick
[2:01:16] up the Bible
[2:01:17] can I be faithful in these small things
[2:01:21] I'm supposed to be a pastor I'm supposed
[2:01:23] to be a minister I'm supposed to be an
[2:01:25] example
[2:01:27] but if I was really squeezed down to the
[2:01:29] test
[2:01:30] if it hurt that bad where they're
[2:01:32] torturing me that bad
[2:01:35] what would I do
[2:01:36] but this is where it starts right here
[2:01:38] because they're not torturing me now I
[2:01:40] have the freedom to praise him right now
[2:01:43] if there's anything in my life that
[2:01:46] shouldn't be if there's a breaking point
[2:01:47] in me all the way to the end
[2:01:50] yes
[2:01:51] that's what I want to be if he gave me
[2:01:54] spoken word power if I had the power to
[2:01:57] create would I use it right
[2:02:00] I'm I'm not that clean I don't think
[2:02:04] my heart has some weak places I'm
[2:02:07] my temper my attitude I
[2:02:10] God help me
[2:02:13] I gotta be honest things I got God help
[2:02:15] I want to be honest while there's blood
[2:02:17] on The Mercy Seat
[2:02:19] because there is help from the helper
[2:02:21] and he's got the power to make me what I
[2:02:24] need to be
[2:02:26] and that's the value of a of a time like
[2:02:29] this that's the value
