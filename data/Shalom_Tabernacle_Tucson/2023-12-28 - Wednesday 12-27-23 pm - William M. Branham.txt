he broke that barrier at the cross and he made a way for us to come and worship him in peace amen so it's good to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight we'd like to greet each of you precious name of our Lord and savior Lord Jesus Christ we' like to go right into the scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 and excuse me we're going to be playing the tape um the tape is the church order but I'm I got a few notes I wanted to read just to maybe set it up before we go to that but in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 I move to I move to this handheld verse number 26 and 27 speaking of the speaking in tongues and the gifts here is what the Apostle Paul is setting things in order in verse 26 how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you have a Psalm half a Doctrine hath the tongue ha the Revelation ha an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying yes and if any man speak in an unknown tongue Let It Be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret amen so we'll pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word tonight bless your people that are gathered here Lord we come gathered in your name we pray your blessings to come and touch every heart every light every life Lord we don't come here uh for a form or just a ritual but Lord we come to to to feed on your word to come into your presence to draw strength from you we know there's a great battle Zone and a great journey that's in front of us and we want to be ready Lord to meet the challenge of the day we believe in your word you've given to us what we have need of for that great Challenge and Lord may you speak to our hearts and equipped us with a portion of that word tonight in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated setting the church in order would be the title for my part and then we're going to listen to church order here in just a moment you know um in 1958 brother random preaches a message Church order we're going to listen to that tonight and as I listened to it I think brother art sent a quote from it to the to the brothers on the board and I listened to that today and it just really spoke to my heart and it it touched me a very special way some of the things what the prophet had said in that message that we all know that he said he preached Church order twice it's in 1958 and then or 1959 sorry 1958 of October and then he um also brought it again I think in' 62 or 63 Church order that one's a little bit longer but in this one he goes and he's dealing with the gifts and he's setting the church in order and he's talking about how that those gifts did people need to meet 45 minutes before the service and I thought you know he's really speaking to a church church or a group of people that this would be a pattern or what we should look to as an example even though many of us have never saw a church in the message operate the way we're going to hear on the tape here tonight uh many of us have not maybe some of us have but it still was set in order and brother bandam put it in order in 1958 and then there were repercussions of of him putting that that in order there's a group of people that left the Tabernacle because they wanted the gifts to run rampid on the floor and I believe the Tabernacle ran that way for some time but brother brandham watched those gifts come into fruition and then he brought you say the correction he put it in order and here the Apostle Paul I thought this was interesting that a Gifts of speaking in tongues he said let it be two at the most of three that's per service there shouldn't be more than three of these messages in one of these meetings brother random later tells us that this wasn't just a regular service this was a service specific for the gifts to go in operation and so those gifted people should come together and um pray and wait on their Ministry and then once those gifts uh were manifested prophecy shouldn't just be the the Lord is coming or some praise or some it should be something specific to the people in the church and and uh brother randam sets it very very clear so this isn't a baby Church you know uh this this what we're looking to tonight is an example of a mature church this is an example of what we should be looking to and so hiding behind the corners hiding behind you know you know we have to take our own responsibility and I believe the word of God will will will bless us if we do that so we start with the word we might not ever see it take place in our life's journey but we're still called to preach it and this is the example amen so in 1961 questions and answers brother brandom says this this is in paragraph 140 question number 112 in what order is tongues and prophecies to be used during the service it is not to be used at all during in the service to glorify God not at all and the edifying the church I know that people say the spirit of the Prophet is I know the I guess I beg your pardon Spirit of the Prophet is subject to the prophet exactly spiritual speaking in tongues and prophesying is to edify the church but it has its service of its own see it isn't to bother as long as the prophet of the church is the meetings in order see it's never to interrupt the meeting now see the spirits of the prophets we got another question now let's let that go just for a minute see the real correct way of these operate operate these gifts this is answering many gifts you see when we get to them we'll say we answered it in this first one this person on this one here see that's number five the tongues and prophecy to be used during the service to glorify God you see now the minister if the minister is Anointed of God and the church is set in order now the correct way many of you know how I've talked to you about how you about have to set it in order these gifts are supposed now here's what we do in the Tabernacle the Lord willing now I'm watching I'm seeing something leaving brother Neville and these other Brethren here in order now many of these brothers are young Brothers now I'm an old veteran to all of you in this way I've been 31 years in this it was about 30 years ago I laid the stone there I've had to face everything there was to be faced and you better know what you're talking about too when you come to it you better not only know that better be God there to back it up when you get when you get through with it now the most successful way of doing this now you could have a special meeting I believe that's what they done in 1 Corinthians 14 there something be revealed to one setting by let the other one hold his peace then I believe it was a special meeting for gifts which would be all right if they wanted to have a special meeting where all the gifted people met once a week then with gifts come into the church that be fine let them have that meeting there's no be no preaching it's for the gifts of the Spirit it ain't for The Outsiders and the unbelievers they'd come in and sit down say one raise up and go a speak in tongues the other one say wow what in the world they come and say where's the sinking where's the rest of it see but now these that speaking in tongues many of them and interpreting and so forth are babies in the gospel see don't don't offend them let them grow to that gift some of it you can see how Satan tries to weave into some of course veterans we see that we can catch that and you'll watch it how many can say praise the Lord so 1 Corinthians 14 we'd say was a special meeting for for gifts so we see brother randam placing that for us how many can see that just ready for you amen so here in 1964 so that was in 60 oh excuse me 1961 that was three years after he preached this 58 Church order you had these gifts he put them in order and then people left now here's another message here 19 1964 6 years later questions and answers number two all right brother brandom can Satan use the gift of tongues or prophecy in a person who has the Holy Ghost that's a good one isn't it yes sir it must be watched very very close if you'll notice in 1 Corinthians 14:29 you who wants to put it down the person the person who wrote this never signed their name that just said God bless you see 1 Corinthians 14:29 we find out that any gift in the church has got to be judged first see you have to watch cuz evil spirits slip in cuz remember the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that was sent to ripen the wheat also ripens the weeds the same water how many knows that now that ought to clear the serpent seed to you then how that this sun come I'm trying to pick out of here to get it before my time runs out but I can't find it so how that son was about the serpent seed see God has a law now on this in this law of the spirit of life you have to watch because Satan slips in and Paul when he when something was revealed to somebody it had to have at least two or three judges before it could be told before the church now also here I might bring this out see I don't think my brother's here tonight but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the Tabernacle and went down to brother Junior Jackson's for a church so they went down among the dead birds aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that ever who you are if you're my kid here in Christ I'm ashamed of you don't do a thing like that Junior Jackson is my brother Don rutle is my brother well the reason of it because when I set the church here in a certain order when I come back to see if I could get the manifestation of the gifts half of them pulled away from it because when you start to speak or preach or something it was getting in such a place that you could hardly preach unless there was somebody spoke in tongues somebody interpreting somebody give the interpretation and half of it never even come to pass now I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in interpretation but it must be some something directly to the church not the Lord is coming soon or something which is all right but don't use vain repetitions Jesus said as the heathens do it must be something go tell brother so and so a certain thing he done and to get why go tell brother sister so and so when she did a certain thing down there the other day she transgressed the laws of her husband the vow to her husband unless she makes this right right the holy spirit will cut her off there you've got thus sayith the Lord then bring that sin in then when we get a church like it was when ananas and Safar come in then we got a church that stands solid oh you say brother brandom one guy I told him that he said well you put us too much on the spot I said ain't I on the spot up there to strangers I never seen in my life but I've got faith and conf confidence in my God who sent me to do this and never one time has it been wrong or never will it be as long as God is God that's right now speaking in tongues and things like that I believe those tongues and people that's got them gifts if they're real genuine Christians and interested in it they'll meet themselves together because and give their tongues an interpretation and see what they can do to further the kingdom of God God they got a Ministry of their own but they don't belong here in the middle of the audience where the Sinners are being dealt with and so forth the Bible said they'll say you're unlearned sometimes they get so irreverent with it and so forth not our gang hadn't but I like let them go ahead a while and I said watch it now I told the Brethren there were Witnesses here in know this I said let it alone after a while I'll we'll find out whether it's of God or not if it cannot stand chastisement then it's a bastard child that's exactly what the Bible said and when the chastisement come what happen did I tell you that long ago see asked the pastor here he said what about this and that I said just let it alone they're babies we can't judge it but watch when it really comes to pin down to the word now brother Junior Jackson had had a right to disagree with that he wants his church the people all want to speak with tongues and things in the audience that's brother Junior's troubles that's up to him brother Junior Jackson believes the message the same as any of the rest of us does he's one of us it's not a dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart and it's not and and and it's not here tonight so I can really pour it on the way I want to and Don rutle I don't think Don's here tonight cuz they got a church of their own but if I seen every person come to this Tabernacle walk out and go to Don rle or brother JT Parnell or these brothers here that's our brothers here and fellow citizens of the Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know what to do I say Lord fill this one back up again let's pour it out and fill up another one I love it I love to see those boys they're my my children how many love that what a tremendous attitude Trend a couple of things in here brother Junior Jackson decided not to do the church order the way he wanted to and what brother bam said he believes the same message so it just shows the sovereignty of the local church and those you know brother banam put that in order and then you'll see in 1958 when he talks about the pre-service and he talks about how they gifts should be operated and he talks about you know he's dealing with that in his own church and there's some things that we could you know every local church is growing on its own we're mature or not mature in this area you're growing over here or going over there but I just believe that we have to have a pattern to look to and if these quotes don't mean what they say then then why did he say them and because we've never seen a church in operation ation like that doesn't mean we're not supposed to preach it I believe that that is what a mature church is supposed to be when we talk about the gifts and speaking in tongues is the least of the gifts as he told us and so I thought that would be a blessing for us to hear that it's about 30 minutes or so 34 minutes but um he he he separated that and made that its own special meeting the people with these gifts met 45 minutes before um Pastor wasn't involved in that he said um he talks about every officer God will hold you responsible for that gift and um there should only be two or three of these messages in one of these services and brother bandam says then when you get a church that then we got a church that stands solid and that's what we want to stand solid amen so God bless you let's stand as we sing only believe and go to the message here tonight all things are possible thank you sorry only be only be all things are Possible only reallying only be only be all things are possible only believe God bless you you may be seated we have just closed a big meeting of Five Nights at the Tabernacle where by God's grace and by his help I have tried hard by the scriptures to set in order the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ as we believe at the brandom Tabernacle the first thing I wish to say is that the pastor is always in full charge of the Tabernacle in my absence and I only look to the pastor when I return so he is in full charge to change or to do whatsoever he thinks it's best under the leadership of the Holy Spirit while I am awaiting we believe in an Apostolic Church teaching Apostolic blessings for our peoples of this day we believe in the Full Gospel and believe that all of the signs and the Wonders that was spoken of by our Lord Jesus Christ would accompany his church until he returns we believe in those things things and believe that they are to be set in order that the church has its order and each church has its doctrines and Order and discipline our church has no members as Jers we believe that the whole Universal Church of the Living God is our brothers and sisters and all people are all always welcome regardless of what denomination they belong to at the ram Tabernacle at eth and Penn Street in Jeffersonville Indiana we believe in justification by faith Romans 51 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that's we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 for Jesus also that that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the the person has been Sanctified the unclean habits has gone from the person he's the believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit which comes as a filling of the believer and then when the believer it's just as many times as I have taught it like picking up a glass out in the chicken yard justification is picking it up ready for to use it with a purpose in heart that's what God does to The Sinner he's still filthy then he's cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is uh not another step of Grace but or of the same Grace that fills the believer to the extent where that signs and wonders such as the apostolic gifts spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the Holy Spirit comes in to take up the gift I believe at the scripture teaches that gifts and callings are without repentance that when we're born in this world we are sent here by one purpose that is of god and that before we're even become adults while we're yet children the gifts that we have of God is inoc understand and only the filling of the Holy Spirit puts these gifts into operation but we have them in the beginning such as teachers and apostles and and Prophets and Gifts of tongues and the nine spiritual gifts according to 1 Corinthians 12 now we believe that these gifts are in operation today and they should be in ever local church although in such we have found throughout the world that there's much fanaticism hooked along with people who profess to be uh Apostolic Believers just as they are and other orders and so forth we have Fanatics that's been all along we've had those Through the Ages they had it in the AP Apostolic day and as Paul said there that how that some had come and persuade them away after other doctrines and so forth but in his own teaching he said if an angel from heaven would teach anything else and what he had taught let him be a curse so we as the brandom Tabernacle at ath and Pinn Street year try to follow the teachings of the New Testament for we believe that Jesus Christ being the Son of God and Paul the Apostle was a called and chosen vessel by election of God to be sent to the Gentile Church to set it in order now we believe in water baptism in the brandham Tabernacle by Mercy In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ which is the apostolic uh teaching of the Bible and may all members of the or comers to the Bram Tabernacle who desire such May at any time requesting to be immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus May consult the pastor if they have repented and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the pastor will as soon as possible even then if he can baptize them immediately this does bring them into the Fellowship of the Believers we believe that by water baptism we are brought into a fellowship but by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we're brought into the members being members of the body of Jesus Christ which is all over the world now another thing that we believe that the manifestation of the spirit is giving to every man to profit with all now we believe that when these gifts and so forth are operating in the church which we covet and desire that the people who are gifted by the spirit come and worship with us now in most places we find that when these gifts in the people the people does not understand how and when to use these gifts and in doing so they only bring a reproach which we believe would be just what Satan could do to make The Outsiders the unbelievers and so forth afraid of this wonderful blessing that God has given to the church in these days Paul said when there come a stranger Among Us and we've all speak with tongues won't the man go away and say we were mad but if one would prophesy and make known the secret of the heart then they would fall down and say truly God is with you now we believe that the spiritual gifts among the Believers is the order of the day we cannot believe that a man can preach under inspiration and then or be an inspired teacher and then Deni the gift of healing or the gift of Prophecy or speaking with tongues or interpretation of tongues or any of these other gifts so therefore here is my belief in God's word the way the brandom Tabernacle at ath and Penn Street here in Jeffersonville should be operated I think the first thing and believe that these things which I say is essential and must be carried out in this manner in the brandom Tabernacle for it to prosper in the Lord and if at any time these this would be questioned the person who is in question about it may consult me if they cannot get to the pastor or they could consult the pastor of if I'm home off of some of the trips I'll be glad to to help either the Ley or the pastor at any time and these things are scripturally and I believe it's the order of the church I think first that every member or every worshipper of the brandham Tabernacle should be so much in Divine love with each other until it would their hearts would long for each other when they have to go away to leave each other at the service at night I am a True Believer in Divine love the Apostle Paul said that was the evidence of the Holy Spirit by this man all man will know you're my disciples said Jesus when you have love one for the other and we believe that it's the love of God that sent Jesus Christ to the Earth to die for for us all God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life and the everlasting life here is God's own life because we become Sons and Daughters of God by the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the Seed of Abraham and gives us the faith that Abraham had when he believed God before he was even circumcised now the next thing we believe that these worshippers should meet together these gifted people such as tongues and people who gets Revelations and interpretations and so forth these members or these Believers rather should come together at least 45 minutes or an hour before the services ever began the church should be open early and the Believers come together on these nights and for at least 45 minutes to an hour before the services began I believe the brandham Tabernacle at all time should have a spirit filled pianist who would come early filled with the Holy Spirit and would play softly very softly Spiritual music such as down at the cross where the Savior died down there for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied glory to his name something on that order near my God to thee Rock of Ages cleff or me or near The Cross or something on that order softly slowly as he is meditating constantly on on the Holy Spirit he or she whichever it may be then I believe that the worshippers coming in should be met and their hang their coats and hats shto their seats with hospitality that only ushers are deacons filled with the Holy Spirit can do and in love to see the Church of the Living God go on these worshippers should not talk one with another and be talking across and making noise in the church they should come together first slip up in silent prayer perhaps at the altar for a few moments no loud praying interrupt someone else silent prayer you're in worship that that soak in worshiping in your spirit then return to your seat or you do not have to go to the altar just go in and get your seat sit down Listen To The Music close your eyes bow your head and be in silent worshiping God all along then if the spirit should reveal something to another or or some one be filled with the spirit to a place where he would speak with tongues then this person should rise and give the message and everyone must hold their peace until the interpretation comes when the interpretation comes it must not be just quoting of scripture or something that has no meaning it must be a message directed to the church or we think that it would be in the flesh M we see so much of that and now I believe the the spirit was to speak only for the edifying of the church and now it would be a message something on this order Perhaps Perhaps the people are gathering by this time some sick people has come in perhaps there's a man laying paralyzed or something you've never seen him before but when the interpretation would come would be something in this order when the interpretation of the one who just spoke would say uh well thus saith the Lord the man who is in our midst has come from a certain certain place and describe the place and would say that he is paralyzed because three or four years ago or whatever it may the case may be he did something evil like left his wife and children and run off from them and he's fell from a trussle or something like that order and got hurt and paralyzing thus saith the Lord if he will repent of that and will promise to go to his wife and reconcile himself to her then he shall be healed now and return to his family and then before anyone says anything there must be at least two or more man or peoples in the building who are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine who has a good discernment of spirit shall rise up and say that it is of the Lord and if this thing doesn't take place then tongues should not be mentioned in the church if the person speaks with tongues Paul said there be no interpreter and so forth let them speak at home or wherever they may be for they're only blessing themselves and it's not for edification of the church then this person after speaking in the interpretation and then two or three judges according to St Paul's doctrine of the Bible that it must be judged by two or three judges then let the person whom it calls upon to go it maybe it might designate a certain person or the pastor or someone to go lay hands on this person and it it's sick or Afflicted and they will be healed then let the pastor or the other person whoever it may be that was designated by the Holy Spirit to go pray the prayer of faith let them go and minister to the person according to what the spirit has said then at that time the person and whatever the Holy Spirit has said it shall take place immediately then just as the Holy Spirit has given then the people could rejoice and be thankful and praise and worship God because God wants to be worshiped then they must then they must bow their heads and be in prayer again to see if there be another message that the holy spirit will want these gifts to manifest before and then if any time that a person would speak in tongues and interpret and the the judges would send the person to take to do whatever it was said to be done and it doesn't come to pass then the whole group of them shall go to the Altar and there pray God to take that spirit away from them because there's no one would want a spirit like that we would know it would be false and would be of the enemy and not of God because God can only tell truth let that be clearly understood by the church before you start this this new order then perhaps maybe it would be something like this the message would say to a certain brother maybe it say would live by a railroad track or something to have him to move out because there is going to be a wreck on the road or something something or anything in that order and let the judges after they give the church permission to speak or to exercise this uh message that just went forth if their judgment is it's of God then watch and see if it comes to pass and if it comes to pass thank God and be very graceful graceful in your heart towards him and give him praise and worship and be humble Above All Things be humble don't never get yourself puffed up to a place where you know more about it in your pastor or the church that you're worshiping in if you get to that place then ID advise each one of you to get another place to worship with because I am asking the pastor never to permit anything outside of the Bible order a way we have seen it here in the church and then we want these gifts to be operated in place and the worshippers if it's carried on correctly according to the word you'll see a mighty wonderful church and operation for our Lord Jesus Christ now then the next thing shall take place will be that if these people who have that gets out of order uh during these times that a deacon or some uh Usher that's filled with the Holy H ghost and got lots of Grace in their heart shall go to the person reverently fatherly like and shall correct them in this manner or the pastor whoever it may be which would be more essential for the deacons to do so for the pastor at this time while these spiritual services are going on should be in the prayer room or somewhere a Praying these messages then if there's no messages going on no Revelations then the people would be privileged if they desired to raise and give a testimony a testimony only for the glory of God they're not bound to do this but testimony should be given before the message or any song service starts or anything testimonies in these worship services do you understand church that in doing this you have the whole church in the spirit of worship before the word comes in to be taught then the Holy Spirit gets in the word and manifests God through the word to be a confirmation of your worship now then after this uh time for the pastor to come on if messages are going on say the pastor should come out exactly say 7:30 and or quarter of eight and if these messages are still going on before the pastor comes to his out of the study or wherever he may to take his place at the platform some brother should instruct him because the Saints knows that when the pastor comes on the platform it's his time then for the service and that gives plenty ample time for all the manifestations of the gifts to bring the spirit of God into the the congregation and if any unbeliever would happen to be there be disorderly a kindhearted person would go to them such as an oer or a deacon and would tell them if they would they would ask to be kept reverent or be reverent while the service is in order because the spirit is in the building and the gifts of God are being made manifest for the edifying of the church and this person must be told in love and not harshly unless it would come to a place where they were drinking or some disobedient or something other that would be interfering with the worship of of the Lord uh which the gifts are then are being manifest then the person should will should be led out to one side to one of the back rooms or somewhere and be talked to and dealt with kindly now while the pastor comes to the platform as the pastor comes to platform I would suggest as the brandom Tabernacle here that the pastor lead the congregation and at least one or two good songs for we have found it so that when too many are trying to operate the in the church it brings on only trouble I would suggest as I did while I was pastoring at the church Church i l the songs myself and I feel that it would be a good thing at the pastor did so himself and in all prayer meetings where they're gathered together groups of prayer meetings the pastor must be at each one it should never be left to any individual to go lead such meetings for we have found it so that they get also the track on Doctrine and then called bring it right back into the church and many time bring heresies and so forth which doesn't belong in the Church of the Living God and the pastor should be at all prayer meetings and so forth where congreg Gatherings are and the pastors should never take s in the meeting the saying that one group is this way and one that way the pastor should stand between both of them and go to them and get them reconciled immediately and if he can't get them reconciled let him take a deacon with him and then if the they want your neither Pastor nor Deacon then it should be told to the church and as Jesus said let them be unto you as a heathen and a Publican and whatever you bind on Earth said Jesus I bind in heaven and what you loose on Earth I will loose in heaven now when the pastor comes to the platform let the pastor then lead at least one or two songs and go straight to the word not no time for these long testimony meetings and everybody get up and a word to say that does not prosper in the brandom Tabernacle if any peoples who are listening to this tape and you it has prospered in your church well that's perfectly all right and we are very glad of that that it does prosper in your church but in our CH it does not it only causes confusion I've been pastoring here for 20 some odd years and I have found that it only causes confusion if you've got a testimony give it before the in the congregation of the people while the spirits are blessing and so forth or the real way to testify is not in the church is out in Dark Places let your light shine where it's dark go to Road houses and different places and where sining and thing is heaping then let your light shine there is the place to do it but however if the Lord has blessed you and give you some great special blessing or something that you have to tell the people do it in time of the other service the pre-service the preliminary or when the spirit is blessing and giving testimonies and Revelations and tongues and interpretations and so forth in the worship of the Saints before the word of God is being brought forth than the pastor after leading this himym shall immediately lead the church in prayer and a congregational prayer himself as he stands at the platform asking the rest of them to Bow their heads in prayer this we have found to be a greater blessing and a more ruing and operating in the church and then the next thing the pastor should do then if they had a real spiritual meeting with the gifts making man EST many secrets of the people's hearts and things which should be done by the gifts in the meeting then the spirit of God is in the meeting and it's very easy then for the pastor to find the spirit of God which is already in the meeting on the word of God as he reads and starts preaching the pastor then preach anything that the Holy Spirit would put on his heart whatever he wishes to do standing there but the congregation is the only they can rejoice as he is preaching of course or say Amen when the word comes forth but as far as getting up and giving uh uh messages and tongues and and interpretation while the Holy Spirit is working through the pasture the scripture condemns that and said the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophet the pastor then must call this individual down and ask them to be reverent and to keep their place the pastor must be a man that has got a very humble way about him but not too humble but what he could be like the Lord Jesus Christ when he seen wrong going on in the church he platted ropes and ran them out of the church and now the Church of God is the house of judgment and the pastor is the highest order in the church the Elder is the highest thing in the apostolic church outside of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit brings his message straight to the Elder and the Elder gives it to the people the Saints in their gifts shall have their place first to worship and come together which brings as I have said before the spirit of the Lord in the building for the pastor and it makes it much easier for the Holy Spirit to work through him then when a good spiritual meeting has just proceded his teaching and then the Holy Spirit gets into the word and teaches the word at just been manifested by the gifts and then the older call is being made then afterwards and many then will see and know according to the working of the Holy Spirit and the word of God which a pastor places it on that you are the Church of the Living God and if Paul said of old he'll fall down and say truly God is with you now in these things let it be done with reverence and now to the pastor to our brother Neville at this time remember he is the full head of the church brother nebble has a right to exercise any Authority that the Holy Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit would tell him to say in other words in the church he has a right to anything that God would lead him to do he also has a right over his Deacon board he can change the Deacon board the trustees or or pianist or any other office in the church that he desires to change feeling led by the Holy Spirit uh to do so and whatever he does I'll recognize it as he I believe to be a godly man I'll recognize it that be of the Lord and will sanction the same therefore it gives him the authority then to operate the church the way he feels led to do it now are any office in the church if he desires to to to uh switch uh positions with people or he has the authority to do that which I trust that this will always be lovely and never have to be used now may the Lord bless you all and I trust that this will be uh carried out to the very best of your knowledge and may the Holy Spirit watch over each one of you and may every officer of the church F his post of Duty knowing this that God is going to hold you responsible for how you help your office in the church each one will have to give an account and to the leoty and the dear gifted Saints that's in our church those who who prophesy or speak with tongues or interpret or have Revelations we are just so happy to have you in the church and we will give you full operation and everything that the Holy Spirit shall prove that he has said to you and we love you and we believe that these gifts are in you and that if you have the right opportunity and a scripturally presentation of it that you will make great workers in our midst and may the Lord bless you all is my sincere prayer Christians since listening to this tape I have a one thing that I seen I left out and that is this that while people are speaking with tongues it must be in the courses of two or three according to the scriptures that is there's only two or three messages to be given in each single service after that according to the scriptures at these course this must be only two or three so may you carry these things out accordingly a way the Holy Spirit has D directed it in his Bible and this is the best of my knowledge the way to do it Paul said let them be by courses two or three when they're speaking the Lord bless you how many thank the Lord for his Worden amen what the prophet said and that's what we look to we thank God for it being recorded that we have a standard seems like it puts you on the spot and you think of we're not here to play church but God has it as a church that's coming into this perfect stature amen so let's all stand and good friend of mine is going on to be with the Lord that's brother Al sto he passed away this morning and um he's been very
