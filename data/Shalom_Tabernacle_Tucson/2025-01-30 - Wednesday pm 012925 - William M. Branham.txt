a football player and um he would run the neighborhood really tough guy and he came by my house one day and uh we'll get to that in just a minute he came out of my house one afternoon and he asked me to go out with him I said I told him I said Tim I don't go out no more he said what's going on I said I'm saved he said saved from what he didn't know that language but I was saved from sin saved from myself saved from a lot of things I'm so glad to be saved tonight aren't you how many saved tonight amen praise the Lord God bless you we're going to go into this message tonight that we started I think it was on a two Wednesdays ago on the 9th there Revelations chapter 4 and uh brother brandham reads the scripture it's a lengthy tape we're only going to play a portion a second portion of it but let's get a context as he read in the scriptures if you turn with me to revelation chapter 4 this is after the church age the church ages the church is raptured up and the Book of Revelations is a book of symbols it's literal it's symbols it's types and shadows and it requires the seventh angel to reveal those Mysteries and so Revelations chapter 4 brother random goes into this he actually goes back into Exodus and Leviticus and bring some of these things out but we'll just take from verse number one it says after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne and the sight like unto an emerald and round about The Throne were 4 and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God so brother Adam goes into that a little bit on that first part so we're just going to back the tape up just a bit to paragraph whatever paragraph I gave them there just to get a little bit of the context and then we'll take about an hour or so and let the prophet talk about these voices so let's get into uh this message how many's looking forward to hear what God has to say from his word amen let's sing that old Hymn of the church to prepare our hearts only believe amen only believe only believe that all things are possible only be only believe only believe all things are possible oh let's lift our hands and say Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I yes Lord Jesus I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I be believe God bless you you may be seated brother brandom now the voice of the throne notice in this Throne Before the Throne was the Seven Stars the voice of the Stars voices you see there was more in the revelations four here or five we find out and out of the throne proceeded lightning Thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself to the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God he rejected is to remove the candlesticks voices the voice of the seven Church agents over here in the corner the voices speaking with thunder and lightning nowadays there's so well we don't believe in saying Hell in the pull pit oh mercy so oh we need man of God man who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the pull pit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people of sermon amen let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of God that'll bring reproach to them who rejected you say no one can put a finger on his or her life they're sweet living if there ever was a man of God it's that man or that woman see live your sermons don't try to preach them you're not called to be a preacher get all mixed up anyhow and messed up you'll get people Tangled Up you want to well you you'll ruin them in yourself too just live your sermon am the preacher is called to preach his and to live it too amen you can't live it a stop preaching amen but you're supposed to live your sermons all right here was boices all how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lived boices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around in the Earth today without a blemish yes there real Christians that's Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and move right on oh my that throws him away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil just like why you say if he could preach like a billy Grim or an old Roberts or somebody a great influential speaker if oh no sometimes the devil is last of that he don't pay no more attention to that nothing you get all theology theology you wanted to and all the Seminary training and the devil is set back life at but when he sees that life look at those disciples down there that Maniac child that day with epilepsy saying come out of him devil come out of him devil come out of him devil the devil sit there said now aren't you making a pretty shame of yourself now you see what you're doing Jesus told you you commission you to go cast me out not only one of you can do it but brother when the seen come one come walking quietly oh my you didn't have say nothing that devil already scared right there he know he had to leave well there come a life not only a sermon but a life that come out of him oh my that do it whitly know what he was talking about you know what he was doing now voices the voices of the seven trumpets or voices of the seven uh uh stars seven Messengers but I watch here and seven lamps before of the throne which are the seven spirits of God Seven lamps let's draw a little bit here the throne the holy PL the congregation right there was one 2 three 4 five six seven seven stars seven lamps seven Messengers seven spirits not all together meaning gods and seven spirits but seven manifestations of the same Holy Spirit where's the Holy Spirit here at the throne shining out in each Church age this church age is reflecting back this away the voices of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever see seven there was voices and seven lamps on fire Hallelujah seven spirits which are the seven spirits of God remember a couple Sundays ago we got to it the big diamond but it's cut in many different ways to reflect the fire and lights from it that's way Jesus Christ is the beginning of of the creation of God Revelations 1 that right then R was God created he is the beginning of the creation of God and God is eternal is that right but when God was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin and she began to develop these cells with within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation for God was made flesh and dwell Among Us and become Emmanuel God With Us the beginning of the creation of God than in that great Jewel that come from the dust because he was made of dust is that right eat food like I do eat food like you do which dust of the body he become Calum poish petroleum Cosmic light but in him dwelt Eternal Light amen no wonder of the wise man said to the star guide us to thy perfect life they were just reflecting the light of one Perfect Light and there he was a perfect light of God beginning of the creation of God now in there was he how did he be able to reflect himself back to the stars of the earth as the wise men saw them in heaven and they become ministering Spirits here on the earth he was wounded the big diamond cut off for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chasti with our peace upon him with his stripes we were healed what was it doing reflecting any man that claims to be a servant of God that denies Divine Healing and his power not getting his light from that diamond not getting his light from that th because it's reflecting him the same yesterday today for through the Seven Stars the seven Church ages oh praise be to God thank guess it's appropriate for a minister to worship God from the ppit with Thanksgiving and praise oh how real how it Thrills my soul to feel like I could scream and Run and Jump as high as I could hallelu because there is something within me that's changed me from what I was I'm not what I ought to be and not what I want to be but I know I've been changed from what I used to be something has happened something taken place and stand here and see this Eternal Word that's waved every storm when they tried to burn the Bibles and everything it waved right on this the same because it said heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away up here near Chicago now and a b a Bible lays on a Pulpit of a church way back before the first world war a missionary and fellow was converted and he wanted to get these missionaries Bibles said I can't give you this and my mother give me this inste when I get home I'll send you one you started back across the sea and a German submarine blow the the ship up never found a piece of it two years later way down on the coast they seen a box floating some of them thought it might be something had drowned so they got the box out and opened it up Two Fellas walking along and in there the only thing survived it there was that Bible he's sending back to the missionary it lays on a pullit here near Chicago today and a Methodist Church heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away during a time of the flood year 1937 this little old church and mud floors and so forth that was in it we could ride over the top of it here in a in a rowboat the floods went up that night when I preach the gospel and left my Bible in open on the pulpit when I went home predicting that blood would come I said I seen him measure 22 feet over Spring Street down here old brother Jim wise Haren them last remember that brother George I said he said Oh Billy and 84 only about 6 in on Spring seet I said I seen a man come down from the sky and take a major stick and stick it there on Spring seet said 22 ft he said you're just excited I said I'm not excited thus sayth the Lord that's how many feet was over Spring Street 22t to the inch exactly that old Bible where been preached on that night she started raining the blood breaking through and so forth and this old church the seats went right straight up to the ceiling the Bible went right straight up to the ceiling washing through here all that water raising up the pole pit went right straight up they come right down and every seat set right back in the same place the Bible laid right back in the same place and all that water and still open up the same chap in the same place heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away amen how that Bible floating that salty water for two years without even Starling the words on God's words are true amen I remember at that old brother Jim W's heart was so satisfied with that every time he get a pain on his arm he got some kind of wrong with him when he got about 75 years old he got rheumatism the pain to go to hurt and here he' run get the Bible open up lay it on there another pain down here I come up there one day and he had so many bibles over him I couldn't see brother Jim he just had Bibles all over him he say God's [Music] promise that's it he heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away remember the old fellow used come by see me none of his people sure I don't think I used to help him a little you know along cuz he was old and needed money and he'd come down he said one day I was leaving for Canada turned around as went out the gate and said Billy my son one of these days you'll come back and Old Uncle Jim won't be dragging up and down this road here anymore that was the last time one in Canada got a telegram he died right out there in arms sister margan he had a heart attack and run out the hospital looked up at her and passed away sister Argie is she here this morning she usually comes in you all know one of the great cancer cases were y in the Baptist hospital she's been dead for 17 years on the medical U clinic over there on the record of dying with a cancer 17 years ago she lives at 412 Cano Avenue nursing in the hospital out here oh amazing great s Sweet to Sound Hall Jim Tom Robertson an attorney in Louisville and we all know Jim Tom that's what brought him to believe in this message he went up there and his father's one of the heads of the staff up there at the hospital he went and searched it to find out if it was true if she was died was cancer and was given up and sent home and thought as far as they know she was already dead and his father searched it through and it's a truth and Jim Tom said it's a lie she's sitting right up here now I can take you to her oh he's he's real God is he I'm so glad he can look over our mistakes aren't you makes us love him with all of our hearts Thrones Lightnings watch seven lamps our lamps are Seven Stars called seven spirits meaning the man seven manifestations of the Holy Spirit of the seven Church ages that's the seven seats of Mercy for the people here they are seven seats of Mercy seven seats seven churches seven stars seven manifestations seven spirit seven lamps oh my how God is so perfect ever the pneumatics of the Bible pneumatics of the Bible is the most perfect thing there is on Earth you can't get one flaw from Genesis or revelations in the pneumatics of the Bible not another piece of literature written that you can't find a flaw for you read three verses but not in the Bible they've been trying for over 200 years to add one phrase to the Lord's Prayer or take one away from it it's perfect can't add no more or take any more from it they've been think they make the prayer a little bit better they try to comb this into it and put that into it or take this out of it it just ain't right see it's perfect all of God's ways is perfect therefore we are imperfect but he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can we be through the precious blood of Jesus Christ we forget our own selves and just live in him amen there you are how how precious is it all right the sixth verse now if we get into it seven lanes and Before the Throne was a sea of glass liken a crystal and in the midst of the throne and around about The Throne were four Beast full of eyes before and behind oh my look at this Beast full of eyes full of eyes before and now wait Before the Throne was a sea of glass like into Crystal and in the midst of the throne were four and around the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind now the sea of glass you just go to this a't very much of a stle here but I W to erase this for a minute now now we want to study here just a little bit the sea of glass is symbolized in the old Temple where Moses was commanded of God to build the temple on earth like he saw it in the heavens everyone knows that all right and let me draw a little bit here now say here was the ark in the Old Testament all right the next thing that was called holy of Holly and the next place here was the altar which was called holy place and right before here was the Sea of brass it's called in other words it was a place where the sacrifice sacrifices was washed was wash here before they was received on the altar at the brass altar brazing altar the sacrifice is burned now we want to watch this now where the where now now in this sea of glass was before the throne and before the holy place just I remember the seven golden candles stick set here like this comeing a l see now that's one reflects the light from the holy place out to here now if you you don't have to write this unless you just want to but that's I got something else here I draw out myself that I wanted to get to you on but now you see this was called the sepr it wasn't quite that big it was set over more or less positioning in the temple it was set along about like this here was a sea of brass it was a Laver made out of brass where they wash the sacrifices before the sacrifices was burned or accepted they had to be washed oh wouldn't that make a sermon wasn't that wouldn't that just just was before any sacrifice is received to God it's first got to be washed how not emotionally but Washed by the word now we can go back and get word this Jewish rabbi when I preaching on that sermon of the Waters of Separation The Red for Waters kept up that they were made of waters of separation and before we can every come to God with true faith we first got to come By the Waters of Separation yes you got to come to what the word oh let me just see if I can talk this so you everyone will get it now put on your SP spiritual thinking take off the war bom and put on your spiritual thinking now cause here comes something washed before it can be received at the altar must first be washed By the Waters of Separation now turn with me right quick to Ephesians 5 just hold your place and go back just a few pages back to Ephesians the 5th chapter and the 26 verse that he might sanctify and cleanse it the church he speaking of see now let me go back a little farther than that go back about the 20 first verse while you're looking submit yourselves one to another in in the fear of God submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor submit yourself to your congregation if a little click Rises up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation congregation if you starting to click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God see oh brother wi submit yourselves into your own husband as unto the Lord because he is your lord how many knows that you women exactly right the Bible said so at the beginning still the same way why submit yourself unto your own husband as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of of the body so as a husband you unold that you married people and adult or children is old enough to know the way of life all right as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen don't run over you do that you're not fit to be a husband that's right that he might listen here it is get it now that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by [Music] theise the Lord and every worshiper that ever gains access into this has to come by the words there's too many comes otherwise I believe in little stories and things that my mother died long years ago and she's waiting for you in heaven that does all right after the word has been applied many people come to the altar because want to meet their mother in heaven that's all right you should do that but that's not the reason that you come to the altar you come to the altar confessing your sins because Christ died in your stead amen by the word then any sacrifice do not come according to the word is unaccepted then is that right oh brother I hate to say this I hate to say it forgive me for saying it that's the reason acts 19 stands in the Bible amen have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said we not worth He said and how was you [Music] baptized why Ain you got into here they come some other way besides the word so all we went through the form of was baptized John said that won't work John only baptized into repentance not for remission of sins and when they heard this they were re baptized Why by the word amen washed By the Waters of the word the word said the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah anything that attacks anything else onto that is false now my precious brother I know this is a tape also now don't get excited let me say this with Godly love the hours approach where I can't hold still on these things no more too close to coming see trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord am look where it come from it come from the Ning Council when the Catholic Church BEC in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from Hell there's one God it's exactly right now do you say then you believe it all these people as trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong any man anywhere anytime that wants to talk on the subject come to me any Minister Bishop Archbishop whatever you might be and this is taped go around the world I asent brotherly love for any person that hears me on this tape around the world that will come to me and show me one text of scripture or one paragraph in any history that's authentic history where that any person was ever baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost until the organizing of the Catholic church I'll change my Doctrine thank you [Music] Lord every person was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and my precious Brethren your eyes are blinded to those things pray God give you light now if you got scripture to support it I'll be looking for you're listening for your call you're you beyond this tape you're willfully walking in spiritual ignorance if you don't challenge me on that you want to know what light what's dark let's ask God remember I say thus sayeth the Lord amen oh blessed be if you be me to be his servant and if that wasn't according to the word it would be wrong then if it is according to the word it's your duty to come straight in the out see what happens it's a eror I believe that many thousands of trinitarian people who believe in three Gods is saved because they don't know any difference we're going to get to that on down in the message now don't you all stop your TAP walk out of the house your trinitarian brethren listen to this but you just set still a few minutes you ought to yourself you ow to your congregation don't stop getting the tapes just stay with it search it by the word and see if it's right the Bible said prove all things I know it's UNP so was Jesus so was the message always you love me when I come and heal the sick and Afflicted among you you thought it was great great crowds and build up the church now Jesus did the same thing until one day he had to get down to truth and when he did even 70 turned away from him and he turned to the rest of the 12 and said will you go also and Peter said those notable words Lord who would we go to for thy words alone are Eternal God's word alone is eternal right and find me anywhere that God ever had anybody baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost you go to Matthew 28:19 Father Son and Holy Ghost where Matthew said go to the for teach All Nations baptize them in the name of the father son Holy Ghost and anybody that thinks the father son Holy Ghost is the name it shows there something wrong with their education now for a seventh grade student to say that to Bishops just listen to this father's not a name son's no name and Holy Ghost is no name there are titles that goes to the name of father son Holy Ghost which is Jesus Christen remember that's not in Anger that's said in love and godly respect right amen with love and consideration for the full body of Christ to where I'm invited by my trinitarian brethren and all over the world to come and preach in their congregation but I never mention it when I'm among you I want to be unless you ask me yourself and I'll go to the parish with you and talk with you about it but before your congregation would stir them up it's your place to get the Revelation and go teacher You're The Shepherd of the flock I'm speaking to ministers amen if you don't understand come let's set and reason together the Bible said prove all things and hold fast to that what's good sea of glass where the sacrifice is washed and we are washed oh don't forget that we're coming back to it at you while wash about the water of the word then you've got to hear the word before you get there because only one way you can approach God that's by faith is that right Faith cometh by here hearing of the word washing our conscience not to meet a man not to meet father not to meet Mother not to meet baby that's all true we will do that but the first thing we got to come is God's Avenue of approach we be worse when we hear the word of God by faith we're walking Grace what God did for you that's right you believe God you believe on God and as soon as you're sorry you're already forgiven as I was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of got a little mixed up on him and I said look brother if you said something to hurt your wife's feelings immediately you feel sorry for it you're sorry you did it you're already repented in your heart that's right but you've got to go tell her about it you got to go say honey I I'm sorry I said that then you thoroughly repented that's the way it is with God a man that would go and say I heard her feelings don't make any difference I'll tell her I'm sorry but really am not you're a hypocrite that's right that will never be received by God you've got to thoroughly be sorry for your sins then when you know that you're sorry for your sins and then repentance be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ far the remission of your sins and you shall receive forgiveness receive the Holy Ghost just simple God's made it so simple here the we notice here in the sea of glass it was likened unto Crystal now the sea of glass is assembled hped by the brass sea this is the Glass Sea in heaven Moses saw it as a glass SE and made what was called The Brass SE a bre Brazen altar Brazen sacrifice Brazen altar rather you know what BR speaks of in the Bible judgment he made a brass serpent what does a serpent mean the symbol of serpent meant sin already judged in the Garden of Eden when thy heel shall bruise its head his head shall bruise the heel and Brass represents Divine judgment the brass alar where the sacrifices burned Brazen La where was washed for the water of the word see amen Mo Elijah in his days went out looked up and said the sky looks like brass Divine judgment up on a rejected Nation Oh My brass Brazen now we're at the Laver and you notice this Laver was empty and was as clear as Crystal why the church had already been redeemed amen now now we notice a little later on oh when the tribulation Saints comes up we find it Again full of fire do you know would you like to read that let's go over to Revelations now uh 15th chapter the second verse and read where we see this brassy fire again all right and I saw another angel I saw another sign in heaven right great great and marvelous seven angels having seven last plagues for in them is filled up with the wrath of God now the wrath of God watch and I saw as it was a sea of glass mingled with fire now watch and they that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over the mark and over the number of his name stood on the sea of glass having harps of God and they sang the song of Moses the servant of God oh do you see it amen tribulation period oh are you in a hurry all right listen let's notice something here how do we come we've got to come this Gentile Church to this word sea of glass water water the word is that right amen recognize the word the way it's written then the sacrifices received and filled with the holy ghost from the inside shining through the light of that age this there comes out the holy Place into here out star into here get it notice now at the end of this age John when he saw the Sea of brass there it was clear as Crystal what was it the word had been taken from from the earth raptured in the church and it was clear as Crystal no more blood the church age was over now in Revelations 15 the remnant of the woman seat which was the tribulation saints that went through the tribulation was found look standing on this seed amen and he was filled with fire blood red lasers licking forth the fire of God they had gotten the victory over the Beast Rome over his number over the letter of his name and over his image the confederation of churches and it come out and through the preaching of Moses and Elijah those two prophets that will appear to Israel to pull out the this group of people those tribulation period Saints back in that time that'll be brought in with see the church is UN raptured now but remember the wife is on the throne the tribulation period lived in the kingdoms out and brought all their kings and their honor and Glory into the city as we get down in Revelations 22 you'll see it you're wri this out and holding it when we get to it you'll see what we mean we haven't got time to just catch every little thing and run it back and forth but hit the high spots of it then someday maybe the Lord will will we'll have lot of time and talk of it now these tribulation periods saints that come up and went through great tribulations the church will not go through the tribulation do you see that's already in glory amen and here's the tribulation Saints the Sanctified ones that had been it's mine and your fault they had never heard the word if they heard it and rejected it they went on to hell amen it was cast out in the outer Darkness because they rejected the word but if they would never heard it God just amen tribulation period comes to them now notice just a minute Saints wash by the same word because it's the same altar it's the same sea of glass and the same word Revelations 2:5 uh Revelations 15 or rather 2 to five no notice just a minute well we never took the word to them that's the reason they was they was like that we never took the word to them we were going to be held responsible so we'll not be able to catch all the peoples the church W in this age that's got the truth because they'll go through the tribulation they're not the saints that died way back down in them church because he said they come up out of the Great Tribulation and the great Tri yet future as the church goes home amen oh there you are amen oh I love it listen let's go a little farther I want see what kind of word they heard now let's start again on the second verse of the 15th chapter and I saw as it was a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the Beast over his image over his Mark over the number of his name stood stood on the sea of glass having harps of God I see they never entered in but they heard the word they heard the word now listen see what kind of Doctrine they heard see if it compares to the church now and they sang the song of Moses the servant of God that's after Moses had crossed over and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy works Lord God Almighty who is that lamb Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints see what they recognizing to be not no third person in a trinity but the Lord God Almighty the king of saints listen are you ready fourth verse who shall not fear thee Oh Lord capital l r d Elohim a't glorify who is it left that'll not fear thee and glorify thy name it was washed for the same Waters that you're been washed by now hearing the word in the faith and power of Jesus Christ being the almighty it's the whole Revelation at the beginning the whole thing wrapped up in the revelation of who Jesus Christ is God made flesh Among Us great and marvelous are thy name who will not fear and honor thy name thou for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for th judgments are made manifest in other words we see what it means to not to receive it your judgment has been made manifest so here we stand we're washed now we're being Washed by the Water and we come to the tribulation period we took our stand for you and we believ you and now we stand on the sea of glass and we're honoring and glorifying thee as the reflection of thy holy Len I are true and our judgments is righteous oh my we stay weak on that baptism of the Holy Spirit let's draw something right here now just a minute I got something I want to draw now let's what always take that right there where we are now if we'll notice here's a great picture now here is the holy of holies all right here is a holy place and here is the first before coming there is the uh the sea all right now notice how do we approach God faith cometh byar hearing hearing the word of God word of God has been reflected from the holiest of holies into the messenger of the back in and that in Solomon's Temple it give the reflection those candles reflected its lights out into that brass laad so here the angel of the church age is reflecting into that water who this guy is in here reflecting his Mercy his word his judgment his name all is reflected in here where you're separated by believing it you get it notice how beautiful this is here we talk watch your here therefore being justified justified by faith all right second place that you being wased Sanctified and then filled with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost you see it how this message justification by hearing sanctification is what you do and regard to what you did and appreciation that God seals you by the Holy Ghost now you my Baptist brother I want to ask you something you said what more could Abraham do but believe God and God imputed him for rightous that's all he could do right here he believed God but God to accept his belief give him the Seal of circumcision and sealed him showing that God had accepted his faith amen and if you profess faith in God and has never been stealed by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 if you want to put it down Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed and you're not sealed until you have received the Holy Ghost amen how long does it last till the next Revival unto our Redemption Hallelujah the very day of redemption there's no way of getting away from it you can't get away from it because it won't get away from you see for you are sealed until the day of your Redemption there's nothing future nothing PR perils hunger thirst death or nothing can separate us from the love of God Christ thank you Paul said I'm fully persuaded of that are Hallelujah there are you're sealed until the day of your Redemption notice that'll bring up to last last Sunday again have I got time I just watch watch this the spirit Spirit soul and body all right SE Body Soul Spirit now let me erase that fix something here for you now I'm going to draw something here uh didn't get a chance to draw it that Sunday so I got Dr out here myself on this piece of yellow paper I want so you can mark it down you see what I mean now you your pencils now this is the body and this is the soul and this is the capital SP r i t Spirit holy spirit all right now that's what we're made up of if you notice over here holy Place holies of Hol here altar holy place and here the sea the see that's where you hear the word faith God by hearing hear the word separation SE of Separation separation SE now notice this now there's only one entrance to get into here and that you have to come here first amen amen is that right now I wish I had GRE I put over here the The Virgins one the wedding supper another one see how this man got in here at the wedding supper and he come in some other way here was the door Jesus said I am the door and this wedding table was set in the people all sitting around and here was one man up here that didn't have a wedding garment on and when the king come in he said how'd you get here my friend how'd you ever get in here it showed that he didn't come in but this door he went at the window come in the back way or through some Creed of denomination he didn't come to the door call in the old or they still have the same thing the bridegroom that's going to be married he gives out the invitations and furnishes the Rob to everybody he's invited oh amen how my heart spins around and around when I think it amen no man can come to me except my father's giv him an invitation first and all the father has given me will come to me oh amen how was we called before the foundation of the world are those are put on the Lamb's Book of Life to see the light to receive the Holy Ghost have walk in amen our name for the Lamb of SL was put on the book the same time the Lamb's name was put there the Bible we get to that said he deceived all upon the Earth whose names are not written in the land's book of life since the foundation of the world notice that if he the bridegroom himself when he stood the door the fellow brought the invitation up said here it is thank you he took the invitation laid it down here and put a robe on him so they' all look alike I like that see in the power of God in the Church of the Living God the rich poor Bond free black white brown yellow all look the same Bo they're Rob with the same power of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah see now I showed he didn't come to the door now notice here what if a man tried to go to the holies of holies somebody some Bible teacher tell me if somebody started into this holy so holy is I coming through here he died Aaron's son Strange Fire one day some denominational fire when it wasn't denominational fire and they died at the door is that right amen Eli's Sons it was I believe Eli's Sons tuck them in represent the sons of Aaron which was the priest now now there's one way to get into the body how's this body control now watch real close now and you get your pencils ready here's the gate on this side it goes into the body one 2 3 4 5 now you got that draw now the first gate over here is see smell hear and taste and touch or feel either one wants be doesn't matter now that's the senses of the body is that right how many knows that six senses control the body now we got a soul as you get through this the sensus outside that's the outer system now in here there's one 2 3 four five five attributes in the soul now you'll write them down the first one is imagination imagination the second one is conscience and the third one is memory and the fourth one is um reason and the fifth one is affection now did you get them all if you don't then let me know now you got them all down see taste feel smell and he the body that's open to the body the soul is Imagination conscience memory reason and affection is the sense are the attributes like the senses of the soul and the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside because the soul only puts out an atmosphere of what's on the inside of you it takes a place of sanctification the soul is set to the same category there all right now every everybody got that all down all right now to this gate there's only one one gate that's called self will you're the boss of what goes in there and what does it do what is this the body must be washed the lad Sanctified at here filled with the Holy Spirit here and this becomes God's justice seat again where God sets in your heart and if you do something wrong say my I did wrong some people say it don't condemn me to to wear short hair to women it don't condemn me to wear manicure or makeups or whatever it is it don't condemn me to go to dances it don't condemn me to tell a little white lie don't condemn me to play bridge in my bridge party you know why you ain't got nothing to condemn that's right that don't hurt my conscience you got more conscience than a snake has hips so you just you ain't got no conscience there ain't nothing there to hurt you you're the world but I challenge you to let Jesus Christ come in here try to do it one time brother you'll be so condemned you'll back off and shake your head from that thing it's as certain as I'm standing here because he's holy listen I'm quoting the scripture if you love them things that's a world things of the world it's because the love of God's not even in you that's right how is it self-willed why would you call it self-willed brother Bram because it puts a man and woman back again just like Adam and Eve at the Garden of beeden on what the two trees self willll this one is death this one is life am self-will imor premoral agency God placed the first man Adam and Eve right here on premoral agency he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this thing fixed in here is your own self willll Hallelujah your self will you have the will the do God's will you have to get away of your own will to let God's will come in for this is the only channel that needs to the heart oh you can join Church you Baptist and Presbyterians and you methodists and Pilgrim holders and come to sanctification but you have to will to do God's will self will to let the Holy Spirit come in here bring forth these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall lay their hands on the sick or take up deadly things and so forth these signs shall follow them that as that their will become my will and the works that I do shall they do also I hope you don't miss him there's the will to do God's will you see what I mean look here talking about the Holy place the lad here's the lights the candlesticks 1 2 3 4 5 six seven each one them got a light where are they getting their light where's their light reflecting where's it reflecting too it ain't reflecting over here in corner on some denomination is flirting back there to the word swers of separation amen amen for repentance and remission of sins Luke 24:49 must be preached in his name to All Nations beginning at Jerusalem how was repentance and remission of sins taught at Jerusalem how far is to go to all the world repent ye said Peter in Acts 238 and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins that message is to go to all the world then shall come then the end shall be after this message has gone to all the world how these candles s reflecting over here on some Methodist pres that you're in a Pentecostal denomination well certainly not it reflects him here as the I am not the I was about three or four different people but God setting you there reflecting your out each one of those churches back there and see what they did we just come through history they reflected him as was am as he is and like he always will be he that was as soon as John got the first V of it he said he that was which is and shall come the almighty God the creation of God Alpha Omega the beginning and end that's the true light's being reflected do you see it amen after 12:00 and I I got listen let's just just hurt so you can cop it down I just hate to keep you too long but I don't know when I'll see you again see now want you get this friends this is life now look I don't mean because I'm stand if I if I'm reflecting that sort that I'm you misunderstand my heart I'm not trying to reflect oh this is just uh you're nothing I'm not trying to do that if you haven't received the light I'm trying to point you to one here not to one here at this point the one there at that throne and that Throne want to become in your heart then you'll see exactly the same thing is it's reflected here what is this up here it's reflecting this and this is this the word wash By the Waters of the word by the word wash through the waters of separations and the things of the world the World by the word the word says he's the same this today and forever amen you don't say he's the same in the Pentecostal age back in the disciples then the next age you changed no he's the same amen see you can't make it say nothing else we can just stay on one of those things for hours but I hope that you're getting it now God's called you you'll get it that's what I believe it am all right now what is it justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost soul body spirit all the same now L reflecting the word the true word reflects what what would this L if it was getting it Reflection from this Shina of Glory it would reflection kind of glory amen is that right am if you got in a seminary your like you reflect the Seminary you got in a Methodist Seminary you reflect methodism you reflect you got in a Pentecostal Seminary you reflect Pentecostalism but if you got it in the glory of God by the burning bush why would Moses come out from his presence he had to put some over his face so the people couldn't even look at him is that right am he was full of the power of God Amen Stevens a man full of the Holy Ghost trying to stop him why he's like trying of put out a house on a windy day in a fire put the fire out of in a house on fire on a windy day or the more the more they blow it the worse it got well you couldn't stop him directly when they put him before the S of course the Bible said he stood there looked like an angel I don't think an angel just meant he was a certain being stand there but an angel knows exactly what he's talking about so does any Angel a messenger of the church AG you don't have to go back and see what the Seminary thinks he knows what God Said in his Bible the power that's reflecting to prove that he is the same this not afraid he's telling just exactly what he knows to be TR and God standing right there backing it up with the same kind of signs and wonders and with the same word that's an angel Steven stood there I know what I'm talking about that you stiff necked uncircum CCIS and heart and ears you always rece resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so to you so which one of your fathers hasn't kill the prophets and build their tombs to them you denominations which one of you hasn't done the same thing build big white walled castles and margs and things around here going talk about God you're the very one to put him in the Marg you're the very one put him in the Tomb that's the very thing you put him in the Tomb back there was a big White Castle Church the comination Pharisees and Sadducees put in now then try to build a memorial to it me tell you that Christ is a living being he's not something that died he's something that rose from the dead and liive forever more oh brother sure what does it do it reflects what it's reflecting from here what would be it would what's the true reflection of him then the first thing it would reflect to be his name is that right am it we reflect his name next thing reflect to be his power see what I mean it reflect everything he is so if this is reflecting to this age here everything that he was then he is the [Music] same what is it it's reflecting as he was as he is as he always will be because it's coming straight from the Throne of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever same God same power same
