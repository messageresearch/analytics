And it's a special privilege when we get to uh gather together of like precious faith in in a sanctuary that's dedicated to the praise and worship of of Jesus Christ our Lord. And we just ask that tonight, Lord, for all those who have made an effort to be here that you would not disappoint them, Lord. not we we we disappoint you all the time, but you never disappoint us. And so, Lord, tonight, I'm sure there are those here with with a need on their heart, perhaps a question before you, a decision they have to make. And we just ask that the Holy Spirit would use the ministry tonight to speak to each need. We thank you for it, Lord, knowing that you're fully capable if if we'll get ourselves out of the way and let the Holy Spirit have preeminence in our lives tonight, that you will bless us and that we'll draw closer to you as a result. We thank you for it and uh pray that you would be in every aspect of the service tonight for your honor and glory. We ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.

He brought me out of the miry clay. My heart was distressed Jehovah's bread. And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down. I cried to the Lord from the deep my recay who tenderly brought me out to golden day. Yes, he brought me out of the mighty clay. He set my feet on the rock to stay. He put a song in my soul today. It's a song of praise. Hallelujah. Then he placed me upon a strong rock by his side. My steps were established and here all above. No danger of falling while here I remain. But stand on his grace until the crown I gain. He brought me out of the valley clang. He set my feet on the rock to stay. He puts a song in my soul today. It's a song of praise. Hallelujah. Then he gave me a song. Was a new song of praise. By day and by night, his sweet notes I will raise. My heart's overflowing. I'm happy and free. I will praise my redeemer who has rescued me.

This is put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. So, you may not feel like praising, but we were here to make a sacrifice of praise tonight. &gt;&gt; And that's not to say we don't have sympathy for whatever you're going through. But when David was at his lowest point in his life, says he encouraged himself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to take some notes from from him and we read so many psalms that encourage us. And that's what he did. He put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. So let's do that tonight. Put on the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Oh, lift up your voice to God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his wonderful name. Amen. Let's all stand if we could together. The brothers could come prayer request. There were a couple that were turned into me and I'll just read those. Brother Ben, as you're coming to read the rest of them, our sister Vogle had turned in a couple. One to remember a good friend of Terry Vogel and also a request for Kelly from Austin, Texas. She has cancer. The doctor has not given her any hope. Amen. But we serve the great physician. He specializes in the impossible. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless you all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Want to remember those uh this morning a prayer for the the wheels that are going through and I have a funeral this Friday for Sister Wa. And we want to remember Sister Snow for her quick recovery. And also uh we want to remember our deacon here uh brother Joe Galante. He's having surgery or he had surgery for quick recovery. And um I just kind of want to say something about him. Uh he I got since I got to know him, we I see him out in the foyer. We were here early and he is such a humble sweet brother. He's the real deal. And um He's always concerned about his dog. He's got a dog that's that uh he eats rocks and his uh intestines is full of rocks and he's real concerned. And I was thinking, does does God care about our pets? Yes, he does. &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Because when the prophet went over to the to the other side, he said his little dog Fritz was right there and his horse pit nicker was there. So he cares about our pets. We just want to pray for them. And I want to pray for my four daughters that are traveling along with the Pope sisters this week that God would watch over them &gt;&gt; and give them a grand time over there. &gt;&gt; Yes. We're we're a very privileged people. &gt;&gt; It's uh we were hearing this morning that um we can't lose in this race. We're the winners in this race because if we go before the rapture, the prophet said we it's a limousine ride to the sixth dimension. And if we we go in the rapture, you know, it's we get a body change. We can't lose. We're the winners of this race. And we were in God's thoughts. The prophet said before the foundation of the world. And the prophet taught us that a word ex a thought is a word expressed. So we were before the word. So we're the his thoughts expressed. So we're the word expressed. Believe it or not, you're going to say me. Yeah. You little me and you. We got to accept it and believe it. Thank you. Let uh any anybody I left off. Oh the who's this sister? Oh, you already read it. Okay. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, how we thank you this this evening, Lord, that you allowed us to come here, Lord. I don't have the vocabulary, Father, to express the gratitude that's in my heart, Lord. Oh, Father, that you chose us. You elected us before the foundation of the world, Lord God. And here we are manifested. Why? I don't know, Lord, but I I love you with all my heart, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Pray for the sick and the afflicted, Lord. Those that are going through hard trials and sicknesses, Lord, I pray and intercede for them with with with compassion in our hearts, Lord. This sister that they don't give her a chance to live, Lord, but you're the one that has the last word, oh God. We pray that you would come on the scene for her, Lord. And brother uh Galante, Lord, be with him, Lord. Restore him back to us, Lord. We love him, Lord. Such a humble, sweet brother, Lord. He's a testimony to me, Lord. Thank you for him, Lord. Pray for the the ministry, Lord. I pray for the the brother that's going to bring the word. pray that you would use him in a mighty way, oh God, that you would anoint him, Lord. Anoint his heart, his lips, his mind, that he would speak words of eternal life to us, Lord. I pray that be with brother Israel, Lord, and all his all the things he does, Lord. May you lead him, guide him, and direct them, Lord. So, we're here to worship you, Lord. Why shouldn't we worship you with all our hearts, Lord? Oh God, if we can only [Music] realize and open our eyes who we are and why you you called the prophet here. You told them go to Tucson. Why? It's getting so personal me to me that I believe it was because I was going to be born here. Oh, thank you, Father. I love you with all my heart and soul. Thank you Lord for we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Just look for in his wonderful [Music] face. And the things over will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace. [Music] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. I thought we were going to have three specials and it looks like there's none. So, if you don't mind if I sing one for you this evening, &gt;&gt; and we can all just worship together on this. I'll have the words up, but just wanted to share a quick praise. When brother Ben was talking about God being mindful of the pets, and he one of brother Joe's dogs has rocks in his intestines. We have a dog that I think may have rocks in his head. He's not he's not real bright, but um I know the Lord is mindful of him. And so this last week we uh we were somewhere and garage door opened up and it looked like a little lizard went running across and I looked at it. I'm like, "Oh, that's not a lizard. It was a big scorpion running." And so me looking at it then then our dog Rufus saw it and he goes, "Oh." So he went to do what he normally does with lizards and went and put it in his mouth and Roffus put that down. He dropped it. No bite, no reaction. So his eyes on the sparrow was on Rufus this week. And I know Rufus means a lot to me. My license plate is his nickname, T- Rof. So he it's it's a it's a sickness that I have, but he knows the things that are important to us and and his eyes on the sparrow, his eyes on on the dogs, and his eyes on me tonight. And that's the encouraging things. I know that if he doesn't allow that dog to pick something up that's going to harm him, how much more does he care about what you and I are going through. Amen. The key of Eflat. Sister Jesse, you know that song till the storm passes by. Out on the water, storm raging high. The waters around them were troubled that night. Fear filled their hearts and they thought they would die. They failed to remember that the master was nigh. But he spoke the word and the winds all stood still. Even the waters they obeyed his will and he calmed their storm just like he will mine. If I'll just remember that he lives deep inside. So why should I worry? [Music] Why should I fear when this very same Jesus, he stays always near. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. [Music] Now we read in the Bible how he walked with them, brought light to their darkness. When the way grew so near, how great it would be to have his steps lead in mine and to walk with the master all of the time. So when trials come and death is so nice, I just search for the master. I know we'll be there on time. And when I'm in trouble and my body is in pain, all I have to do is call on his name. So why should I worry? Stand as we sing it together. I fear when this very same Jesus, he stays always near. He lives in my heart and he hears when I cry. I'll call on his name till the storm passes by. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] My heart. [Music] One more time. Why should I worry? Why should I worry? I feel Jesus. [Music] passes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord this evening. So happy to have each of you here gathered with us. All the saints from Amazing Grace uh temple and um from the neighborhood. So happy to have you to join us. I think it's more of you than it is us and uh we appreciate your support of your pastor to come and speak for us tonight. Brother Caleb has had me speak for him many many times over the years. He's always had an open door there and uh it worked out this time for him to come and speak for us this time. when he brought us that apple pie and that cherry pie, I had no choice. I got But we're uh we go way way back and I appreciate brother Caleb and what the Lord has done for him and so we look forward to what the Lord is going to do through his ministry tonight. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you come expecting? &gt;&gt; Amen. All of you are welcome. God bless you. Thank you for coming. It's a few announcements here. Next week, Sunday, Brother Jonathan Davis, that's uh Sister Jesse's brother, will be the assistant pastor from up north there in Alaska. He'll be ministering for us here Sunday morning, Sunday night. I really like him. Real quality brother, quality spirit, and um I certainly appreciate all the Davises actually. Um but he's he's a he's becoming a a real favorite. So, we look forward to have him with us next week. Sunday, my wife and I will be traveling to Bogotaa, Colombia. Thursday, and so you pray for us that the Lord will keep us safe for brother B uh brother Fabio Bernal's 50th anniversary there. Big big meeting. This is our our first time going. Will you be there? Okay. All right. And so um uh keep us in prayer and the Lord would bless those meetings and be with us at that time. Amen. So I think that's all the announcements. As we prepare to go to the word of the Lord tonight, let's sing Amazing Grace. Amen. Amazing. How sweet the sound. [Music] But now I was blind. But now I see was grace. Was grace that my heart to fear and grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Feeling [Music] how great that grace of the hour I burn through many dangerous toils and through In any dangerous stom I have already [Music] heal. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We believe you all there. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. May God sing [Music] God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Can you give the Lord a hand of praise and worship? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Am I on? Okay. Just making sure. Uh God bless you. I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And on behalf of the Amazing Grace Temple, we thank you for the invitation and your fellowship and your hospitality. Most of all, I want to say thank you with all respect to my brother Israel for giving me this opportunity to come and be a blessing to you in the house of God. Amen. I know that the enemy personally has been fighting me tooth and toenail ever since I came back. We came back from Los Cusus, New Mexico. And I think it's wonderful to know that. And I my wife, I'm not sure you she agrees with me or not, but I said it's kind of flattering uh to know and realized that I've upset him that bad to where he won't back off. And I said, I wonder what else I can do to irritate the enemy tonight. And I think this is going to irritate him. So, how many's glad to irritate the enemy? &gt;&gt; I don't say that carelessly now because I know that he he has a job to do and he's very good at it. Very good at his job. But God is better at his job. So, &gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say anything, but since he said it, I wanted to make sure I Yeah, I'm going to be there, too. So, that's going to be good. It's going to be a nice time. U excited to go. I've been there before to Columbia. Really enjoy. The weather up there is really nice. Uh it's the same all like most of the time. It's just really comfortable. So, anyhow, may God bless you and thank you for having me once again. uh if you wouldn't mind, would you turn in your Bibles to uh Genesis the 18th chapter? I try not to take too much of your time. Um but whatever he wants to do, we'll do. &gt;&gt; And uh you saw I bring a towel with me. I I get really sweaty and so it doesn't mean that I'm anointed necessarily. I just sweat a lot. So uh but we'll see if the Lord will anoint his servant tonight to preach his word. We had a great time this morning and I I asked brother Israel said did y'all have a good service last Sunday morning and he said we did matter of fact I said so did we. So did we and it just we're in the same neighborhood. So I expected if we have one y'all are going to have one &gt;&gt; and if y'all have one we're going to have one. So uh and and that's a it's a it's a marvelous thing. We uh had an incident, if you don't mind, just a couple more things where uh I was beginning to preach and all of my deacons ran out the door. I said, "Well, this isn't good." You know, I turned around told Brother Jesse, "Is it something I said?" You know, and he said, "No." And somebody said, "Somebody jumped the fence." &gt;&gt; And you know, in this neighborhood, well, in this world, we don't know what's going on, right? &gt;&gt; And so I just said, "Well, everybody stay calm. We'll just kind of see what's going on." and and here comes this little bitty lady come walking in the door and I said, "Man, all you guys went out there, of course, on the camera, you couldn't tell that it was a lady. She had jumped the fence. Um, she wanted to come to church and she saw the gates shut because we shut them during service and she didn't let that stop her. She jumped over the fence. And I said, "Man, you know, with all of us believers that come up with every excuse not to be in church, &gt;&gt; here's this lady who had never been there before, never heard me preach, never heard the word the way we preach it. She didn't care. She wanted to jump the fence." So I was like, "Uh, next time just stand there. We'll open it for you." But uh, the Lord said something to me. Are you ready? He said, "Do not take for granted what I have freely given you when there are people who are willing to jump over fences and kick down doors and run through walls to get what others have rejected." &gt;&gt; So, we are a blessed people. &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people. We are the bride of Christ. And I do believe that with all my heart and I know that the day is getting closer because he is so he has ramped up his attack. But the Lord has also ramped up his protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, blessed be the name of the Lord. Uh, Genesis 18 and kind of a different way to interpret this scripture, but it's verse 10 and 10 only. And excuse me, I'm not sick. It's allergies. And uh just, you know, I don't say my allergies. Does anybody say my allergies? Don't say it's my They're not my allergies, they're just allergies. uh you know like someone says oh my diabetes is acting up or my you know crooked neck or tubercul they said I had bcitis and I go what's that is that like you know elder person type thing and they said no you've developed bcitis and I go well no I haven't my body thinks it has but we're not going to have that either but it doesn't belong to us it belongs to the enemy amen &gt;&gt; so uh and it says here uh and he oh and he said I will certainly return unto thee &gt;&gt; according to the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the back in the tent there, and she laughed. Amen. So, may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. Father, I love you, and you know this. And I pray, dear God, that you do what you are capable of and just get me out of the way as I yield to you, Lord. Let your word be manifested. We pray. Bless those that have come. Bless those that are watching wherever they might be. And I thank you for already hearing me already in Jesus Christ's name because there is no other name greater. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Um I'm going to preach on uh using some quotes from the seals uh that I have. I want to kind of kind of provoke you in a friendly way if I could that if you haven't and I know that brother Israel we talked about that you you were kind of in the seals not too long ago weren't you? Yeah. Well, I'm going to say this though. I want to kind of provoke you to if you haven't read your your seals in a while, if you haven't heard the sermons in a while, to take some time and go back and listen as there's so much in there that I think that we have either through the years ignored or overlooked or bypassed and uh I don't believe that God waste time. &gt;&gt; I don't believe that his prophet wasted time. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So, let me ask a question here then. Um, so we know that brother Brandham said that there was an angel of the Lord come every night and tell him exactly what that seal was. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So then when he got up until he got to the seal took maybe an hour, an hour and a half for him to get there. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham had the answer already. &gt;&gt; So why didn't he just come out and say it? &gt;&gt; Right? Was he just wasting time? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Was he just wasting words? &gt;&gt; So you agree that everything that brother Brandham said had a purpose behind it? Amen. &gt;&gt; So here's where here's where I stand on that. Brother Brandham, the revelation of the first seal starts with paragraph one and runs all the way to the end. &gt;&gt; Same with two, three, four, five, six, and seven. It isn't just the seal itself. &gt;&gt; There's a lot more in there. &gt;&gt; Brother Green said that people were on the edge of their seats. He said they were waiting for that punchline. Brother Brandham said they he could count on his hand how many people knew what was going on. Is that right? But see, we're not that generation, and it wasn't time for them to see it or understand it. We're of another generation. I believe that Jesus said, "This generation shall not pass away till all these things be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Right? And there's come a time where you say, somebody said to me, they said, "Well, brother," they said, "Well, brother Caleb, why didn't we ever see these things before?" I said, "Because it wasn't time." &gt;&gt; And that's why I use that scripture. I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to visit you to a place where you give you have another birth. You bring forth another birth, right? &gt;&gt; And it's not just a re a born again experience that we're after. We're born again every day. How many understands that? &gt;&gt; Someone said, "How can you say that we're born again every day?" Well, I said, "You tell me how we can repent and die daily, and I'll tell you how we can be born again every day." &gt;&gt; Right? You you can't just keep dying. You got to be born again. And this message, uh, it never stalled. It doesn't it didn't grow dim. It's not it's lost its popularity to the unbeliever. &gt;&gt; And that's okay with me because that means that there's more food for me. &gt;&gt; You ever had that? &gt;&gt; You have people invited over and some people don't show up. We all What do we say? That's all right. That means there's more for me. &gt;&gt; So if you don't want to take it, you don't want to accept it, that's all right. That means there's more for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are in this hour and the opportunity has arisen where the Holy Spirit is showing us that there is more in here not just the punchline. Now look the the the the horse riders and so forth that would have happened anyway whether you know about it or not. &gt;&gt; You understand that? But what else is he saying in there? &gt;&gt; What else is he saying to to to dress you for a wedding? &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's not just the seal that's stressing you or the the punch line. I'll say it like that. It's everything in the from paragraph one to the end. Everything is said for a purpose. &gt;&gt; It's not just wait for this, wait for that. It's for a reason. God's prophets don't waste time. &gt;&gt; They don't stand behind the pulpit and just talk. &gt;&gt; Even his jokes had something behind it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Even even the what they call mistakes. Even the the little oops I you know said it one way he didn't rewrite the Bible friends. If he said it wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong one way it was okay he said it wrong whatever but even that was for a purpose &gt;&gt; because then you got somebody come along and say well the prophet made mistakes well I'm not going to say that even if I think he did I wouldn't say it &gt;&gt; you understand what I mean and then I wonder well since you're busy counting brother Brandon's mistakes have you counted yours lately &gt;&gt; tell me how many you got and then we'll sit down and talk about how many he's got Right. &gt;&gt; I've had people say, "Well, people make too much out of Brother Brandham." Okay, fine. If you don't want me to talk about him, I won't talk about him. Here, let me ask you something. What great thing have you done &gt;&gt; that would match up to what Brother Brandham has done? &gt;&gt; He's done. When he said, uh, laying on his bed there, I'm just warming up. That okay with you? &gt;&gt; He said, uh, while I'm laying there, he said, how old was he going to be? He's in his 50 or something like that. And he said, if I'm ever going to do something for the Lord, I better get started. I thought to myself, what do you mean? Look at all the stuff he's already done. &gt;&gt; So, if he felt that way, how should I be feeling at 48? &gt;&gt; I haven't done anything. If that's the way he feels, I don't measure up. &gt;&gt; But yet, we want to say, "Oh, you make too much out of him." Okay, fine. If you don't want to hear it, like I said, that's more for me. &gt;&gt; So, I took some time a few years back and I've been doing it again and I'm going to continue to do it. I don't want to leave it because every time I glean through it again, there's something else there that I can enjoy. &gt;&gt; There's something else there that pops out says, "Hey man, look at this. Hey, look at this." And I'm finding out that we are in the hours of absolute no hidden mysteries and everything is going to be revealed now. &gt;&gt; That it was already there. It's been there the whole time, but we didn't have the spiritual insight that we do now because God is anointing us with the Holy Ghost to now see what we've never seen before. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you mean you're interpreting it?" I'm not interpreting anything. I'm reading what he said, &gt;&gt; and now I see what it means to me or how it fits. &gt;&gt; All right. So, just for the next few minutes, is it all right if I share a couple? &gt;&gt; I call it seven sealed nuggets. You can't find nuggets if you don't sift through the sand. &gt;&gt; You can't find nuggets if you're not going to read it. &gt;&gt; You're not going to find it if you don't listen. You're not it's not going to do you any good. Look, if you have gold nuggets and you don't use them, it's not going to do you any good. &gt;&gt; So, if you got something you find from the from the from the the message here, if you get it, you better apply it. Otherwise, it's not going to do you no good. &gt;&gt; Right? Use it. Amen. All right. So, let's go here. Uh let's go to the first one in the first seal. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I had a I had my seal book rebound. Isn't that cool? I got seven little. Anyway, I like it. I I I I I could get a new one and I did. But brother, you know, when yours is already marked up, it's got all the quotes highlighted that I enjoy. I got all my T. I said, I just couldn't part with it. So, I just want it rebound. Sister, she said, "My Bible's falling apart." I said, "I could re get it rebound for you." She goes, "Yeah." She said, "It's just got everything highlighted." You know, old tears, stain drops, you know, where God told you something. &gt;&gt; Why do you want to get rid of it? Just hold on. Don't give those things. Your old Bible. Hold on to that. Will you do it? &gt;&gt; It means something. Remember, God spoke to you with it. All right. That's for free. Okay. There's something here that he says that I really enjoy because there's enough people. Can I take my jacket off? Is that all right? Thank you, brother. Uh there there's enough people and I don't know about you because maybe you're all perfect. &gt;&gt; Maybe you ain't ever done nothing wrong. Okay, but brother Caleb ain't outside of the blood. Brother Caleb's done a few things that he's not proud of. All right. So, but there's enough people in the world or at least in the city that likes to remind you &gt;&gt; of how bad you've been &gt;&gt; or what mistakes you made 25 years ago. Like you still hung up on that, &gt;&gt; right? There's people who like to remind you that that there's there may be a slim chance you're not going to make it. And those people who talk that way have got no idea who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; They got no idea what his blood is capable of. &gt;&gt; They have no idea what his grace can do. They don't know what it's like to be completely 100% forgiven. &gt;&gt; In the sea of God's forever as though you've never done it in the first place. So, I feel sorry for people like that. &gt;&gt; Who are you to say that someone's done something wrong? So, that's enough of that. Let me read something that says the opposite. Okay. All right. Let me see where' I start at. 79. Good. I'll read it like this. Be easier for me. Maybe we getting old, brothers. There we go. All right. And how I love this, brother. And I'm not going to give a a quote before and all that because look, just take it. All right, go look it up. I want to provoke you to go and read it again. And how can a man say that the bride of Christ goes through the tribulation? You know those people who think that? &gt;&gt; I had to tell our young people when I did a Bible study because they all thought they had to go through tribulation. I don't know where they they didn't get it from me. I said, "Who taught you this stuff?" And they all think they used to think that they would have to stand before the judgment throne. &gt;&gt; No, we don't. I said, "No, we don't." &gt;&gt; All right. So, look, it said here, I can't understand it. The prophet said, "She has took away from tribulation." If the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have adopted accepted the blood, how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless? &gt;&gt; Uh, oh, wait a minute. Highlight the rest of you. He said they reborn. He said somebody say, "You say there's no such a person." Brother Brandham continues. You see this meant something to me &gt;&gt; because not only does Jesus tell me I'm forgiven, but now the prophet is telling me that I am perfect. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for someone to get excited somewhere. &gt;&gt; He said this. Every born again believer, how many is born again? &gt;&gt; How many is born again? Okay. Then every born again believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God. &gt;&gt; Come on. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So that means something to me because if you want to bring up my sins, I'll just send him a quote. &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to use a quote to condemn me. I'll send you a quote that sets me free. &gt;&gt; See, this is bride material. This is part of your first seal revelation &gt;&gt; that the first seal broke open. This was part of it. &gt;&gt; The angel of God told Brother Random, "Make sure you tell them that they are absolutely totally without sin before God." &gt;&gt; Tell them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See it. He said before God, he is not trusting in his works in the blood of Jesus. That his confession has dropped into the Bible said he that is is born of God does not commit sin. &gt;&gt; Now look, this not a get out of jail free card, okay? Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't go around doing goofy things and saying, "I didn't do it. The Bible said I didn't." &gt;&gt; You need to have a conscience. &gt;&gt; You need to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It'll keep you from doing &gt;&gt; goofy. All right. &gt;&gt; He said, uh oh. That God does not um No. Where was I? Oh, how Okay. Yeah. does not commit sin. Thank you. For he cannot sin. How can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and who? &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So who is your accuser then? Is you see when we go around condemning one another or condemning fellow churches? Well, they believe this, they've done that. You better leave that stuff alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, I I I know some things about some people, you know, we all do, right? But who am I to judge? &gt;&gt; If I if I know, and I I like saying like this, if I give the brother the benefit of the doubt by now, he's made it right. &gt;&gt; Or at least I'd hope so. &gt;&gt; Well, why not be like Job? Huh? Job made sacrifices just in case. just in case his children did something wrong. &gt;&gt; So why don't we act like that then? Instead of judging and spreading uh evil little lies, why don't we get down and say, "Lord, just in case the brother hasn't made it right yet, I want you to know, Lord, that I'm sure brother or sister so and so didn't mean to be that way. &gt;&gt; If they haven't asked for forgiveness, Lord, I'm asking you to forgive them of their sin. See, that's how you know you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; When you get down and pray for somebody who did something against you, &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I know they didn't mean that." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; All right. Can I look? Uh, why don't you get lost? Okay. But okay, it is. Um, that Thank you. that would scatter sin till there be nothing left of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus has annihilated &gt;&gt; your sin. &gt;&gt; Scattered it &gt;&gt; to where there's no proof. &gt;&gt; Destroyed it. &gt;&gt; Utterly done away with it. &gt;&gt; And let me say this, not just the sin of today, but the sin of yesterday &gt;&gt; and today. And whatever you're going to do tomorrow, Jesus has already annihilated it. makes me feel good. &gt;&gt; Uh, how far did I go on that one? What quote? I mean, what paragraph here? Thank you. I keep doing that. See, I get excited and I lose my place. &gt;&gt; We got you. Come on up here, brother. All right. With scatter sin till there be nothing left of it. How can the pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass by? This is something you find in the first seal. &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know, the seals, the seals, I don't even believe. Okay, brother, you you're focused on the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; It's in there &gt;&gt; and it's always been in there. &gt;&gt; Look, I don't need a show of hands and you don't have to. But if you want to be honest, I'll tell you, did you really even think about reading the rest of this stuff? Huh? Maybe you all did, right? Because you spiritual, &gt;&gt; you know, but back in the day, I fast forward the tape because I wanted to hear what the seal said. &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest, right? I was brand new and somebody said, "You got to hear what the seal said." Why is he talking all this stuff? I fast forwarded. Didn't realize what was in there. Oh, it's pure gold. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be you therefore perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect." And how could we even start the thought of being perfect? But Jesus required it. &gt;&gt; And if Jesus required it, he has got to make a way for it. &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love it? &gt;&gt; And he has made a way for it. &gt;&gt; He's taking care of it already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he has his own blood. Now all reveals now all reveals all the mysteries that's gone on in the past. Now the thought is here at the end time that that the mysteries that began way back long ago has come down through the church ages. It is to be revealed here in the breaking of these seals. Look, it was written but it was a mystery. But now you and I, we see it perfectly clear. &gt;&gt; He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a debt I could not pay. I needed someone &gt;&gt; to wash my sins away. &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't realize that before. No, but now you see it wide eyed. &gt;&gt; You know what it is. &gt;&gt; You're not religious about it either. &gt;&gt; It's caused you to fall in love with him. &gt;&gt; It's caused you to want a relationship with this person called Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I did it again. Thank you. Who's Thank you. I appreciate that. All right. Right here, brother Gilly. Here in the last days, breaking the seal. Here the last days after the time of intercession is just about finished. If he said that in 63, where are we at now? &gt;&gt; Do you want to be caught outside the gate? &gt;&gt; He's interceding for you now. &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you take advantage of his intercession between us and God? Lord, don't forget the thing I did yesterday. &gt;&gt; Cover me once more. &gt;&gt; Draw me nearer just a little closer. One more time. &gt;&gt; Fill me up one more time. &gt;&gt; Seal me, Lord. One more time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Lord, whatever you do, don't leave me. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's not going to. But still, Lord, whatever you do, don't leave me. &gt;&gt; I like that. Till the storm passes by, just stay with me. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you, even in you, even until the ends of the world." &gt;&gt; Are we good for that? &gt;&gt; I think we're done. All right. Say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's your first seal. &gt;&gt; Part of it. Just a little Just a little something there &gt;&gt; that we don't even look at. Well, we know all that stuff from the Bible. Well, yeah, but you never paid attention to it till now, right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brand didn't need to waste time. He could have come right up and just the seal is this, the seal is that. But all those people didn't gather for 10 minutes. They needed something more. And if the angel of the Lord thought enough to include it, then we ought to think enough of it to listen to it &gt;&gt; and apply it. If if he says that you're sinless and you're perfect before God, then I want to apply that very principle to my life. &gt;&gt; You don't need to walk around like I'm perfect. No. If I'm perfect, then I want to act perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to behave perfect. &gt;&gt; I want to live as perfect as possible. &gt;&gt; I want to live to where I don't displease him. &gt;&gt; I want to live up to the word perfection. [Applause] Hallelujah. When he sees me, he sees the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Do you know that's true? &gt;&gt; God don't see nothing. Then why do we repent for your own conscience sake? And you were instructed to. But you ought to be glad that he don't see it. &gt;&gt; You understand that now? That's scripture, right? But there's coming a time if intercession is almost over, then that bloodb must be lifting up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying it's gone. I'm not going to go there. But brother, we want to make sure we catch them before it takes off. &gt;&gt; Take advantage of the blood tonight. &gt;&gt; Make everything you can, right? &gt;&gt; And if you make it right, don't do it no more. Nobody said amen. &gt;&gt; If you if you make it right, don't go do it again. &gt;&gt; Huh? you can't. Well, I did it again, Lord. First of all, he didn't know you did it because it's in this it's forgotten. &gt;&gt; But that don't give you a right to continue to do what you just because, you know, if I go out last night, all I got to do is repent and I come to church and I'll still do what I got to do because I was repentant. I know I I got this. It's not a game. &gt;&gt; Man, the Holy Spirit is not even innocent for thinking that way. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like that because it makes him unpleased with me. I want God to see Jesus inside of me. &gt;&gt; You know what else I want? I want the world to see Jesus inside of me. &gt;&gt; Have you noticed you're going to the store lately, Home Depot, something like that, that you're not kidding either. This is kind of I don't know how to take this. But either people are attracted to you and they want to talk to you or I've seen people look, they don't even know me and they're in a hurry to get out of out of the aisle. I'm like, what is going on here? Their spirit sees your spirit &gt;&gt; and that demon don't want nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; And I kind of feel bad about that. I'm like, "Hey, I'm not going to kick you out today, &gt;&gt; come back, and won't talk to you. They don't want to talk to you." But then there's other people that see you and they want to talk about Jesus. Just like that. her little cousin here, she's got a some weird ability to invite her friends to church and they show up. &gt;&gt; All she does is say, "Guys, want to go to church?" Yeah. Where's it at? Over here. You know what's crazy? What's even more nuts? They haven't left. [Applause] I believe these young people are going to carry us on into the resurrection. &gt;&gt; The 11th hour workers going to come in, they're not going to have time to sit down. Brother Brandham said this, not going to have time to sit down and study and pray and fast. He's going to be born with teeth. They're going to skip the milk and go right into the stake. And they're going to have the faith to get us who have been alive and waiting to get out of here. &gt;&gt; There will not be another generation after us. We're going home. Somebody say, "Amen." Praise God. We're going home. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this. &gt;&gt; It almost seems unreal. I &gt;&gt; I think about that all the time. Like, man, is this really happening? &gt;&gt; We've seen more of Brother Brandham's prophecies come to pass in the last eight months &gt;&gt; than we saw since he's been gone. &gt;&gt; Here's there's one. There's another one. You know, here and there's one. But the last eight months, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. You know what's odd is brother Brandham said in his own words, "I don't see anything left to happen &gt;&gt; except the coming of the Lord." &gt;&gt; I'm like, the same brother who said California, this and this, none of that stuff has happened. And then he went on to say, "Everything that's left can be done in the next five minutes." &gt;&gt; Well, nothing happened, but look where we're at now. &gt;&gt; How many more events do we need to see come to pass before we take it seriously? Yeah, I had people tell me, "Well, when I see my dead mother come up from the grave, I'll know it's time." Well, now that person's dead, both gone. I'm going to tell you what. I'm not going to die. &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't care if y'all say amen or not. I know I'm not. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna stay, Brother Israel. We gonna stay alive till the coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And even if I did die at 90, you're going to hear me at 90 going, "I ain't going to die. I'm going to stay here till Jesus comes. You just put me up here in the walker and I'm going to say the same thing that I'm saying right now." But somebody is going to believe this word and somebody is going to hear it, act on it, and do something about it. &gt;&gt; Will you be that person? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's get to the second nugget in the second seal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This kind of hit me out of left field. I wasn't expecting this one when I actually read it in front of our own church and I stopped and I went, "Wait, did I just read that?" Let's go back and hear this again. So, here's what happens. See, Satan raises those up talking about Antichrist and false prophets. Watch the shrewdness of this fellow. You know the devil don't ever come at you in plain view. You know that, right? &gt;&gt; Oh, he's wrapped up in a beautiful girl or a handsome man. Don't nobody want to say amen again. I think that's funny. Come on, young people. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Right. He He wraps up in money. He wraps up in nice cars. You know what I mean? He nice He wraps up in nice careers. He wraps himself in ministries. &gt;&gt; Come on. to entice you. You know, because the pulpit is attractive. &gt;&gt; It is. It looks like power and authority. I'll tell you what, anybody want my job, you can have it. &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. I say it all the time. Is you better be called of God to get behind a pulpit. &gt;&gt; You don't just get up here and talk cuz anybody can do that. &gt;&gt; Anybody. But are you ready for what happens afterwards? The fight that comes down the road, &gt;&gt; that big old target that's on your front, on your back, on your face. Huh? Somebody say, "Well, I think I got I'm ready to be a pastor." Said, "Really? You really?" I said, "Well, here's my notes and here's my Bible." Oh, and here's my phone. What I need your phone for? You'll find out. 90% of the min of our of of being a pastor is nowhere near this desk. &gt;&gt; Nowhere. All right, &gt;&gt; Mitch. All people call you up and tell you how wrong that is and and then share all their ideas. You're going, "Oh, man. What was I thinking?" You weren't. God called you. All right. How'd I get on that anyway? Oh, yeah. He's shrewd. There it is. He'll He'll wrap himself up in a talent of yours. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Brand said, "Money, women, and popularity." Right now, I've always thought that means he's going to have a lot of women or a lot of money or he's very popular. But what about the opposite? What about the lust for those things? &gt;&gt; What about I want to be so popular that you'll assassinate characters to be that guy? &gt;&gt; What if you're you're you're you want to be rich so much that you'll defraud the church and steal their money? What about if you you have a a you want women or this and that that you'll commit adultery and oh no no no just so you can have what you want &gt;&gt; either way you look at it'll destroy you. Do you see people that got a talent and they think they're so good? He come around. They ought to be singing how great I am &gt;&gt; instead of how great thou art &gt;&gt; because they're full of themselves. He's shrewd now. &gt;&gt; They'll get into your brain and say, "Well, you know, you're better than that one. &gt;&gt; You know, this church is better than the other one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If if brother Caleb was doing his job, why'd he move Israel over here? Brother Israel over here?" He actually told me that the devil did. if you were doing your job. How come brother Israel came? I said, "Shut up." &gt;&gt; Yeah. I said, "To help me beat you up." [Applause] Huh? I did say that too out loud. I could have helped me beat you up. I didn't hear nothing no more. I'm like, "Where'd you go? &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; You got nothing to say." &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm messing. You know how I am. I don't Go ahead. I'll tell you. All right. So watch how true he is. All right. Watch the shrewness of this fell that we're talking about here. Satan when we're unfolding him right here. Hold on, brother Caleb. You know the seals are about revealing Jesus. Yeah. You know who else revealed? The devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you're too busy looking for the the next big doctrine, you missed the whole point. &gt;&gt; You see? Hey. Yeah. Well, you know what? A lot of the false doctrines that come out come out of here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because they're looking at just the seal. They weren't looking at the rest of the story. &gt;&gt; Where's the balance in it? &gt;&gt; Where's the take every word? I used to find that interesting that somebody would say, "Say every word. Say every word." I'm sitting there going, "But you don't even live every word." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You mean you want me to say every word you think is right. But that's just the enemy enticing people to feel and believe and think they're the next big shot. You know what? It's strange, huh? There ain't no big shots left. Respectfully speaking, they're all gone. It's just us. It's just us. And we are walking where none of them have ever walked before. &gt;&gt; We ain't got no Moses right now. We don't have Elijah in front of us. You get what I mean? &gt;&gt; But I I I think it's strange. We're in the last church age. Is that right? Just leave that up. We'll be all right. I'll be back in a minute. &gt;&gt; Right. We're in the last church age. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, as an example, when the children of Israel walked out, there was a pillar of fire in front of them and the prophet was at the front. Joshua and Caleb was up there. All the generals and leaders, they were all up there. You know, somebody's got to be last in line. Somebody has to. Not everybody can be at the front. They didn't walk like this. They walk like this. You get what I'm saying? So when the enemy start to chase them, who are they going to see first? The people at the back of the line. The seven church age. You the one getting hit the hardest. &gt;&gt; Paul didn't have to put up with the stuff we were going through now. None of these guys did. They none of them have internet. Bro, Levi, all those uh uh details and points that you brought last time you was there about all this selfies and everything else. I'm just like I don't Wow. You know what I'm proud of? Every week my phone time goes down more and more and more because I realize I don't need it that much. &gt;&gt; I've started leaving in the car when I go in the store. &gt;&gt; I go in the shop. I want to take my time except for when Sister Anne sends me for something because I know if I'm in there, she's gonna want to ask me for something else because I do that to her all the time. Hey, while you're there, right? But you get what I'm saying. So, you're at the back of the line. You're the one who's dealing with everything the devil has. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just regular oldfashioned demons. &gt;&gt; We're not. We're talking about the elite &gt;&gt; of Satan's army. &gt;&gt; We're talking about green berets, if you will. We're talking about n uh the devils seals get it that they have special anointings and they're not just trying to attack your body, your flesh or this and that. Their only job is to infiltrate your mind. &gt;&gt; That's why today the greatest battle ever fought is such a powerful sermon to listen to. &gt;&gt; You have to know your enemy. He certainly knows you. &gt;&gt; Oh, he knows all about you. &gt;&gt; He's been studying man for a long time. &gt;&gt; But I wish he'd get a revelation. Oh, I do. Not that he would be my brother, but that he's not going to get me &gt;&gt; because I've been predestinated, too. &gt;&gt; And I'm not predestinated to fail. &gt;&gt; I've been predestinated to live. Do I have to believe that? Go ahead. Praise God for it. &gt;&gt; There is a difference between believing and knowing. &gt;&gt; You know that. &gt;&gt; I don't have to believe I'm his son anymore. I know I am. &gt;&gt; Now, I had to have faith and believe until I have that revelation. And for other things like money, I still have to have faith and believe it, right? Because I don't know where it's going to come from. You know what I'm saying? But if you're going to ask me if I'm his son, I'm not trying to believe it. I'm not working up faith. I know &gt;&gt; that I'm his son. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have to believe it. Jesus didn't have to have faith. He knew who he was. &gt;&gt; And you and I need to know in this last day exactly who we are. &gt;&gt; How many knows? &gt;&gt; You sure you know &gt;&gt; if the devil came in your face, get out of here, man. You know who who my daddy is. You better scram, buddy. Huh? That's right. Get it. &gt;&gt; So, we're at the back of the line. Then we're there and like the children of Israel, back of the line and they turn around and they see Pharaoh's chariots coming after them. And they start running and screaming because the first ones to get taken down is going to be them. But you see, all of a sudden, the pillar of fire that was at the front of the line &gt;&gt; came to the back of the line &gt;&gt; and stood between God, &gt;&gt; I mean, the enemy and God's people. &gt;&gt; Today, the same pillar of fire that was at the front of the line &gt;&gt; is at the back of the line, &gt;&gt; standing between us and the enemy. &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Say amen. Hallelujah. So watch the shrewdness. All right. We're talking about here Satan. We're unfolding him right here. I guess this is why I upset him the other weekend. Now it's all Now it's all becoming clear to me. But I'm not going to back off. Why should I? &gt;&gt; He don't back off of me. &gt;&gt; Don't you wish he'd like just give you a break? &gt;&gt; Like you know in boxing you got to you know ding you know you rest. Yeah. He don't know what a thing is. All right. Just stripping him down by the scriptures and letting you see who he is. &gt;&gt; See, that's what is supposed to be done. Brother Ken, where'd you find this? In the second seal. &gt;&gt; It's all part of the revealing of the second seal. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not an accident. If he would have just went to the second seal brothers or he would have never said this stuff and we'd be okay. Now what? And you remember he has not tried to go in and be a communist. Nope. Satan hasn't. He's an antichrist. So close that Jesus said would deceive the very elect. Scripture go on and say if possible. All right, you ready? Here's what I got that I love so much. And that's the ones that who the elected that's hid down in these seals. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So, you're telling me that my name is written &gt;&gt; in Revelation the sixth chapter? &gt;&gt; That's right. Well, &gt;&gt; I read it. It don't say Caleb nothing. &gt;&gt; It don't say nothing about the bride. It don't say nothing about it. Just all these mysteries, but your name &gt;&gt; was put there &gt;&gt; and Satan never saw it. &gt;&gt; He hid them. And when they were loosed, &gt;&gt; your name went out. &gt;&gt; Oh man, &gt;&gt; your name went out. And suddenly your mom and dad had the inspiration. Name him Israel. Name him Caleb. Name him Jesse. Why? Because that name has been hid there right there before the foundation. Glory to God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; There's your second seal. &gt;&gt; Oh, but it broke and your name &gt;&gt; has been let loose forever. When the river Euphrates gave up those demons, the seals gave up your name. &gt;&gt; The mystery of who you are and where you're going has been revealed. &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil don't like you no more. A &gt;&gt; we broke up. It's all right. I don't even miss him. He ain't done nothing for me and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the abuse. Right? You know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Whose names are in the book since the foundation of the world. He's a shrewd fellow. And when he sees this thing coming coming up, then he throws everything he can out there to upset it before it gets there. That's what he did to me before I ever became what I am now. He did everything he could to disrupt God's plan. &gt;&gt; How many's got the same story? &gt;&gt; How many is grateful it didn't stop you? &gt;&gt; It didn't stop God's predestination. &gt;&gt; It didn't stop God's plan for you. It might have slowed it down just a bit, but it didn't stop it. &gt;&gt; All right. Where's the arrow? I need the arrow. All right. He throws everything he can out there to upset it before it gets there. Did you know there will be false Christs arrives in the last day? It should follow immediately after this. After what the seals? It did, didn't it? That's another nugget because now we have a time frame. Now we know what we're working with. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about y'all, but I wouldn't even I wasn't even born &gt;&gt; when this came out. So respectfully speaking, I'm glad that they didn't catch the revelation then &gt;&gt; because I wouldn't have been here to hear it. &gt;&gt; See, but my name was hidden. &gt;&gt; So they had to wait until this time. I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; Why is he doing it now? Because I'm going to visit you according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to give you revelation that'll cause a rebirth. Oh, not just a simple born again experience, but a born from a Christian, a simple Christian to a bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You're more than a Christian. You are a believer that has been given the PS. I love you. &gt;&gt; Here's your love letter. Here's your PS. I love you. &gt;&gt; And all those things written there that were hidden before the foundation of the world. And he didn't let nobody see it till he let us see it. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Oh man. I tell you what, if brother Brandon was here, he'd probably be saying, "Amen." I know he'd be saying, "Amen." Of course, I wouldn't be preaching. We We lay him preach, right? Uh oh, thank you. You're so nice. Okay. It should fall immediately after this, after this great message that this uh brother will speak that will actually come. He's talking about himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. be anointed &gt;&gt; in the spirit of Elijah immediately. &gt;&gt; But he didn't wait. He didn't wait very long, did he? &gt;&gt; And they'll mistake him. Some of them will think he is the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Really? They sure did. &gt;&gt; But he'll strictly say no because he's got to come in like John. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what happened in in Los Cruises. The anointing of Elisha fell on us both and it blessed us with a double portion of revelation. So much so I'm not saying we're Elisha. I hope you understand what I mean. Just that anointing has got to be on the bride. &gt;&gt; The double portion of what he has preached all the thus sayith the Lord etc. has got to be double in your life. &gt;&gt; If you don't have thus sayith the Lord, go back and check. Why? Because you should. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're not dressed by now for the wedding, you better come to an altar and find out. Because by now, brother, if you've been walking in this 45 years, why aren't you dressed yet? &gt;&gt; I'm getting dressed, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I am dressed. &gt;&gt; Well, you got some wild ideas, man. Okay, it don't matter what you think. I'm only saying what he said &gt;&gt; and believing it. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. That's good right there. Do you love him? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read all of them because last time I did that took me two and a half hours. There's a lot a lot of fun though. But I'm going to read you the last one. Got to find the seventh seal. I'm going drink some water. I always feel bad drinking in front of y'all. I turn around. My church be like, I just turn around. All right. The seventh seal is controversial. I don't know why. Do you know why? I could never figure it out. Like, what's the big deal? Why is everybody fighting over this? Well, it's open, but or it's closed, but okay, it's open. That's the bottom line. Whether we know all of it or part of it doesn't matter. It's still open. That means that we're allowed to believe that what we don't know will be revealed &gt;&gt; either by us or a short quick work &gt;&gt; when the prophet does come back. &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't believe in return, brother. I said, "What do you mean I don't believe in return?" They all got to come back. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; If I die, I got to return. &gt;&gt; What's so hard to understand about that? I don't know about the rest of it. That's up whatever. I'll tell you what I've always told people this. If you believe that you should look for a tent, that's fine. I don't have that revelation. But here's the thing. If there's going to be one, don't worry. I'll be there. &gt;&gt; Why? Jump on a bandwagon? No. No. Because I'll be predestinated to be there. &gt;&gt; You don't you get it? I wasn't looking for Jesus, but he found me. &gt;&gt; Come on. I wasn't looking for grace, but it found me. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for baptism in the Holy Ghost, but guess what? It found me. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking to be a pastor, but it found me. &gt;&gt; I wasn't asking for these revelations, but they found me. &gt;&gt; And if there's going to be a tent, don't worry. I'll be there. It'll find me. &gt;&gt; You see it? All I was told to do is look up. &gt;&gt; Look up. Watch you therefore and pray. That's all I was told to do. But in the meantime, we don't stop for nothing. &gt;&gt; Don't get narrow-minded either. I don't want to close any idea out. &gt;&gt; If you got someone who's going to help me get further along, well, I want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost inside of you ought to tell you if it's wrong or not. Say, "Well, that whole sermon was wrong." Don't go out criticize it. Just take, Brother Brand said, "Take the cherries. Throw out the pits." Our cherry pie don't have no pits. Just saying. All right. We must remember that the seventh seal is the end of time of all things. Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. The things written in the seventh seal book sealed up the of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world. remembered us when you were put in the seals. My name I can't get beyond that. My name was in the seals, brother Israel. Let's if you want to go look in Revelation chapter 6. Do you see any names listed there? But I see mine there now. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful. All right. Before the foundational world, it every bit ends. It is the end. It is the end of a of the struggling world. Oh, I I like this. I really do because it makes me feel good because it's the end of the struggling nature. &gt;&gt; It's the end of everything. &gt;&gt; It's the end of the trumpets. It's the end of the vials. It's the end of the earth. It's the end of time. Time runs out. The Bible says so. Right. Matthew the 7th chapter, I mean Revelation the 7th chapter. I'm reading how he says it. He goes on say, "Okay, time runs out." The angel said, "What time will be no more?" What? When then in the days of this great things happening going to happen? Everything runs out in this time in the end of the seventh seal. bonus. It's the end of the church age. Somebody say, "Praise God for that." &gt;&gt; The end of the seventh seal. It's the end of the trumpets, end of the vials. It's even the uh and even even in the ushering in of the millennium. In other words, the end of the ushering in, which means the millennium is now set an end. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; There's got to be an ushering in. And that comes to an end once it's here. You got it. &gt;&gt; So, what else can we say on that? That's the seventh seal, he said. So, where's the arguments? Where's the misunderstanding? &gt;&gt; How is that personal, brother Caleb? Well, &gt;&gt; it's the end of my struggle. It's the end of my wondering. It's the end of prayer. It's the end of begging God. It's the end of pleading. It's the end of uncertainty. It's the end of sin. Oh, come on. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It's the end of temptations. &gt;&gt; It's the end of failures. It's the end of being backslid ever. It's the end of life on earth is to be with God and ever so be with the Lord. It's the end of all things. &gt;&gt; It's the end of religion. &gt;&gt; Oh, I said it. I ain't taking it back. I'm tired of religious spirits. &gt;&gt; That religious demon is the worst one to deal with. &gt;&gt; You can pray for someone, they'll forget cigarettes. You can pray and they'll get drugs and they'll pray and get their life right. But man, a religious demon makes you think you ain't got nothing to worry about. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the worst one. It's the end of that, too. &gt;&gt; It's the end of the devil's power over us. &gt;&gt; It's the end of his grip on my neck. As a matter of fact, what happens is I get a grip on his neck. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I I implore you, go back and read it. &gt;&gt; Take your time. Get inspired. Don't get in a hurry. Instead of watching your favorite show, put on a seven seal message. &gt;&gt; So, I ain't got no time for that. You really don't have time for that. But you got enough time on Facebook, don't you? &gt;&gt; Clock your hours, man. Clock your phone hours. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not my business. I'm meddling. But I tell my people the same thing. So, if you're part of shalom, act like I'm not talking to you, okay? I'm going to talk to them. Don't get rid of social media. It's a waste of your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a waste of God's time. It's something that's between you and him. When you could be praying, &gt;&gt; when you could be studying, &gt;&gt; when you could be seeking his face, &gt;&gt; when you could be getting another feeling of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not We're not church. You don't always get a feeling of the Holy Ghost in church. &gt;&gt; I got one time in a Walmart checkout line. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the truth. Yeah. True story. You want to hear it? It goes like this. We'd come back from Phoenix Tabernacle youth meetings up in Hebrew and we had a wonderful time. Spirit fell out and everything. I think brother Jesse it's when you went for the first time and I you know I don't know about you brother Israel but when I come out of meetings like that it's kind of hard on me the next couple of days. You know devil's coming after you. You're tired. You're weak. You just want to lay down. You feel like you're not victorious anymore. I don't know why that happens. You find a juniper tree somewhere. You know, &gt;&gt; I started feeling like, man, did I say everything right? You know, man, I need to get those tapes, find out what I said. I don't know. Devil, man. The devil, right? I think God allows it, too. So, you don't get too full of yourself. &gt;&gt; Then I'm in the checkout line and all I said was, "I just need to know if I'm going to make it." And I heard a sweet little voice said, "I already said you would." &gt;&gt; So, I got teary eyed and I looked up and this bright light just And I started crying man uncontrollably. Not like boohoo just like you know I mean could add a bucket. And I get next lady goes are you all right? And I go she goes absolutely. Then she started crying. She had no idea what's going on with her. And I get in the car. Brother Ellie is just waiting for me. Looks me goes what happened to you? And he starts shaking. He starts crying and we're just worshiping God. &gt;&gt; But you weren't anywhere near church. &gt;&gt; I am a church. I am a temple. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; You are the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; You know that cop's not coming back for people who never did nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; No, he ain't coming back for Pharisees and Sadducees now. &gt;&gt; He's coming back for people that need his grace all the way to the end. [Applause] Lord, I need you once again. &gt;&gt; He's coming back for people that can't live off their own marriage. Brother Joe, I can't make it on my own. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to make it with my virtues or or my my testimony because I don't want to get there and sound like, "Lord, didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't I because we know what happened to them. &gt;&gt; I haven't done nothing yet. And I can't make it with that. I'm only going to make it. You know, we've heard this before. We say we're going to get there and people are going to ask you, "How did you make it through that horrible age?" &gt;&gt; Right? How'd you get there? How'd you make it through disease and internet and all that? And you think you're going to stand there, wow, give me a couple of hours is going. No, you know what you're going to do? Amazing. Grace, how sweet. &gt;&gt; Well, but yeah, you going to tell me your testimony. I am that same. All right. Like who? Like me. &gt;&gt; How'd you make it? I was lost, but now I'm found. &gt;&gt; I was blind, but now I see. &gt;&gt; That's how we're going to tell our story. &gt;&gt; This is my story. This is my song. I'm praising my savior all the day long. Walking into heaven just praising God. I'm so glad that I made it here. [Applause] I've heard people say, it's going to sound funny, but I heard people say, "If I get to heaven and they're there, I'm leaving." I go, "Well, brother, don't worry about it. You won't be going &gt;&gt; with that kind of attitude. The prophet of God said, "When you get there, you'll be surprised he made it." You know why? Because he's talking about me. Jail Drawn got here. Yeah. And his cousin got here, too. Huh? Tell you a little something to lighten you up a little bit. There's this guy who died. Peter's showing him around. Baptist. They're worshiping God. Catholics. Oh, y'all don't think Catholics are going to be there. Some of them will. The real Catholics that only had that much light. You get it? There's going to be somebody from every church age. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It isn't. Well, here we go. Then there's Methodists are there. And who are all those over there screaming and shouting, "Oh, those are Pentecostals. Hey, you want to see something?" Guy says, "Yeah." He said, "Come here." Open the door and there's a whole group of people worshiping. Who's that? He goes, "Oh, they're message believers." But they think they're the only ones here. Don't get that. Don't get that attitude. &gt;&gt; Don't get that attitude. The Bible said Jesus will Jesus was willing that none would perish. &gt;&gt; He said, "I thank you, Father, for all that are in my hand. I won't lose one. Not one. &gt;&gt; Not one." &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy for that? Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I I'll say this and I don't I don't care how it sounds. I get criticized for all the time. I said, "As far as I'm concerned, everybody's going to go." &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave nobody out. &gt;&gt; That's not my job. &gt;&gt; My job is to get as many as I can into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we're all going to spend eternity together. &gt;&gt; Come on, pastor. Would you bow your heads? Father, we love you. I thank you for this short time you give us. I don't know what'll happen after this. If there'll be criticism or the enemy I know the enemy is going to come, but I pray, dear God, that you would look out after our two fellowships, our two flocks that are just down the street. We we may not understand it, but I've heard from different brothers and they turn around and say people all over the world know that you all are that close. It may not seem like a big deal. Well, maybe we don't see how big it is, but this has been an expression of what two brothers who love God can agree to have a a work next door to each other and not be critical or fighting against the other. I ain't got no time for that. It's like I'd said before, I'm glad he's here. That just means that we whoop the devil twice as hard in this area every time we all come together. We may not be in the same four walls, but we are in the same spirit. We are in the same under the same anointing, the same Holy Ghost, covered by the same blood. Lord, I pray I pray that you bless this little church. Make it Lord great in your eyes. Let the pews be filled. Every last one, &gt;&gt; Lord. And if if mine never fills up, I don't matter. Just let this one fill up. It'll be all right. Give us whatever we have coming, Lord. And let us be good stewards with what people you send our way. For they're not brother Israel's people. They're not my people. They're your people. And I want to remember that. Bless brother Israel, Lord, and his wife for the invitation and the hospitality to let us come. I love you, Lord, with all that's within me. I will love you, Lord, if everything is stripped away and taken away. As long as I still have you, Lord, I'll still love you. I know. I mean that with all my heart. I've seen it come close to her. Sister Anne's gotten sick or when our little girl was born and she almost passed. Lord, I just sat there and I said, "Lord, whatever you do, I'll still love you, but you kept her alive." We've had friends come and go. I've been missing Brother Steve a lot lately, buckles, just thinking about how he he'd be excited about what's going on now. But I know that we're going to see each other in the resurrection. I know that's not too far from now. I'm looking for the dead in Christ to rise up. I'm looking for brother Brener. I'm looking for brother Green, brother Garcia, brother Nick Castillo, all the ones, Tom Bettis. I'm looking for them. I'm looking for my grandparents. I'm looking for you. Be with us now. We pray. I give you all the honor, all the glory, and all the praise. For thine alone are worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. For there is no other name greater. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it reaches to the highest mountain. Stand with me. S and it flows to always the free to sing one more time.

Where the redee are gathering in. Sing it one more time. When the redeemed are gathering in like snow and free from all sin.

Fill my way every day with love. &gt;&gt; Let me walk blessed Lord in the way thou has gone leading straight to the land above. Giving cheers everywhere to the end of the Lord. Fill my way every day with love. Lord, fill my way every day with love. As I walk with the heavenly d. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Tell my way every day.

Brother Jeff Smith, would you come and dismiss us with a word of prayer tonight? Amen. God is so good. It's been so good to be together this evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So good to see you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; De Father, we thank you so much for this beautiful evening, dear Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you for allowing that Holy Spirit once again, dear heavenly father. &gt;&gt; To charge the spirits of your saints, dear Lord Jesus.

[Music] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, "My sins are gone." Well, they're all underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As far as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgetfulness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. God, my sins are gone. Oh, it was at the old time altar where God came in my heart and now my sins are gone. Oh, the Lord took full possession. The devil did depart. I'm glad my sins are gone. Well, they're all underneath the blood. On the cross of Calvary, just steps far removed. This darkness is from dawn. In the sea of God's forgiveness, that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Now when Satan comes to temp me and tries to make me down, I say my sins are gone. Oh, you got me into trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm glad my sins are gone. Well, there underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. Just as far as darkness hits from dawn there in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's good enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Well, I'm living out for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music. With all my heart I say, I know my sins are gone. They are all underneath the blood. On the cross of Calvary, as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's for that's good enough for me. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. My sins are gone. Hallelujah.
