[2:25] Right? He is every bit of it. That's
[2:27] reason. He's deity made flesh among us.
[2:31] Now, in order to get I I won't take time
[2:34] for this cuz I got I see it's nine and I
[2:37] I got another thing I want to get in
[2:39] tonight. if God willing. And I want you
[2:41] to just put this down and you read it
[2:42] tomorrow. You put down Numbers
[2:46] 22-2. I want you to read that now. And
[2:49] you can follow behind me. And I
[2:52] now numbers
[2:55] 22-2. We know that
[2:57] Israel Israel was the chosen people of
[3:02] God. Is that right?
[3:05] They were the They were Pentecostal.
[3:08] Amen. They had the spirit among them.
[3:11] You remember last night's message how
[3:13] that Moses when he had crossed over the
[3:17] Red Sea or the Dead Sea and found behind
[3:20] him in the Red Sea of the blood
[3:23] representing the blood all the task
[3:25] masters that ever beat him and all the
[3:28] children of Israel. Moses raised his
[3:30] hand and sang in the spirit.
[3:35] Oh, every one of us can be a Moses. When
[3:38] we look back in the red blood of the
[3:40] Lord Jesus and see every old drunk,
[3:43] every old bottle, every old vulgar
[3:45] woman, every old dirty thing that we
[3:48] ever done in our life, all dead in the
[3:51] blood of the Lord Jesus makes us saint
[3:54] in the spirit.
[3:57] Cigarettes, tobacos, and bad habits and
[4:00] everything else dead in the blood of the
[4:03] Lord Jesus. And we can raise our hands
[4:05] and sing in the spirit.
[4:07] Hallelujah. Look what Miriam done. The
[4:10] prophetist. Now remember, she was a
[4:12] prophetist.
[4:14] She took the tambourine and began to
[4:17] beat the tambourine and dance in the
[4:20] spirit. And the daughters of Israel
[4:22] follow her down the bank beating these
[4:25] tambourines and dancing in the spirit.
[4:28] Real Pentecostal. And then if you notice
[4:32] when they come to
[4:34] Moab, now we're getting back. We're on
[4:37] the scripture now. The doctrine of
[4:39] Balum. And in
[4:41] Moab, Moab was Israel's brother.
[4:47] How many knows where Moab come from? All
[4:50] right.
[4:52] Moab is what I would call the
[4:56] hybrid because that Moab started from
[5:01] Lot's
[5:02] daughters. Lot had a baby by his own
[5:06] daughter and the two children and Moab
[5:10] was one of them. And he formed the
[5:13] nation of Moab, the
[5:16] tribe. And actually Lot was a nephew to
[5:20] Abraham which actually come back in that
[5:23] same line. We know that. Now I want you
[5:27] to notice they were not pagans as some
[5:30] of our plays recently would give you to
[5:32] remember they were believers. Amen.
[5:36] Amen. Now, when here come Israel up on
[5:41] their road to the promised
[5:45] land, making their way right in the line
[5:48] of duty, and here laid Moab right in the
[5:52] way, they sent messengers to Moab and
[5:55] said, "Let us pass through your land. We
[5:58] are your brother." Now, Moab represented
[6:02] the
[6:03] Nickelians. Now you see just in a minute
[6:05] Israel represented the true churchmen
[6:09] and Balam was one of the bishops
[6:12] popes watch and see now carnal
[6:16] Christianity now we'll notice that he
[6:19] was gifted there's no doubt about it
[6:21] many of them are fine speakers doctors
[6:23] of philosophy and and great man you
[6:27] can't deny that but having a form of
[6:29] godliness but denying the power thereof
[6:32] called back to that original Pentecost.
[6:35] Amen. Don't get away from there. When
[6:36] you do, you're lost. Stay with that
[6:39] blessing. That's it. The blesser of the
[6:43] blessing.
[6:45] Now, notice as they journeyed, they come
[6:48] up to this formal hybrid church and they
[6:52] said, "We are passing through to a
[6:56] revival. We're going over to the
[6:59] promised land. Will you permit us to go
[7:02] through? If our cattle lick up any
[7:04] grass, if they drink any water, we'll
[7:07] pay you for
[7:09] it. Then what did the king bail? He got
[7:14] all excited and he didn't want such a
[7:16] meeting as that in his church or his
[7:18] land. So what did he do? He sent over to
[7:21] the Pope or to the
[7:23] bishop, Balam, a Harland
[7:27] prophet, one that loved money more than
[7:30] he loved God. And the king Bail told
[7:33] him, "If you'll come out here and curse
[7:36] this
[7:37] people, I'll make you a great
[7:40] person." And God spoke to Bailo. And I
[7:45] wonder if it had to be I mean Balum.
[7:47] Wonder how many balms is in this world
[7:49] tonight.
[7:52] Methodist ministers, Baptist ministers,
[7:55] Catholic
[7:56] priest
[7:58] mercy that knows that God that you read
[8:01] the same history in the same book I do.
[8:08] Balam now
[8:11] notice then he said come down and curse
[8:14] the people. And Balam said uh I'll ask
[8:16] God. God said don't you go. But the next
[8:19] morning he said went told the priest or
[8:21] the the king and he come back said oh I
[8:24] I'll make you a great man. So Bam kept
[8:26] on. God said go on then you go on. Amen.
[8:30] See if you won't follow
[8:33] truth. You think
[8:36] nickeladenss that because God's doing
[8:39] for you what you're doing like that
[8:41] there's original truth. You're only
[8:43] taking God's permissive will. Amen.
[8:47] You say God gives us the Holy Spirit or
[8:50] blesses us and we're baptized in the
[8:51] name of father, son, holy ghost. You
[8:53] balamite
[8:55] doctrine of balum.
[8:58] God did tell him after you're so
[9:00] arrogant, he just let him go and hang
[9:02] his own self. Amen.
[9:05] You got to get back to truth.
[9:07] Foundational truth. Amen. Back to the
[9:10] Bible.
[9:12] Well, he's blessed us. Oh, I know that.
[9:16] He did told Bam said, "You go ahead.
[9:19] If you want to go that you're bound to
[9:21] go that way and you want your
[9:22] organization route, take it. Go on."
[9:27] Then Balam started jumped on his mule or
[9:30] not his mule, his donkey. Down through
[9:32] there he went. And the first thing you
[9:34] know, the uh angel of the Lord stood in
[9:37] the way. And you know that prophet, that
[9:43] pope, bishop, cardinal, whatever he was,
[9:46] was so blinded to spiritual
[9:49] things, the thought he was going to get
[9:51] promoted because he lived on the river
[9:55] Euphrates. I guess he thought that some
[9:57] inheritance like upon this rock I'll
[9:59] build my church Peter on some rock was
[10:01] in Rome or something. But when he got to
[10:03] the place, there stood the angel with a
[10:06] draw sword. And he was so blinded that
[10:09] he couldn't see it.
[10:13] And the mule smashed his foot against
[10:15] the wall.
[10:17] And then he rolled him on and the the
[10:20] angel stood in the way
[10:22] again. God will block every door. Amen.
[10:26] And this mule still turned around and he
[10:30] jumped off and tuck his stick be to
[10:31] whail him with it. This little donkey
[10:34] laying there getting beat on the head.
[10:37] And I sure what changed him, what let
[10:40] him have the notion or told him where he
[10:42] was wrong. He let that mule speak in
[10:44] tongues.
[10:46] Not a mule. He was a donkey.
[10:50] Don't say it was a mule. He couldn't
[10:52] have got it. He was a hybrid. See,
[10:56] he was original seed.
[10:58] [Music]
[11:00] Hallelujah.
[11:06] Moab was signs past. All things are
[11:10] passed. Israel had signs following.
[11:14] Amen.
[11:15] But this little donkey turned around and
[11:20] said, "Haven't I been your donkey? have
[11:23] ever uh and that that blinded
[11:27] bishop sitting up on there still beating
[11:30] that mule and the mule got talking to
[11:32] him in unknown tongues to the
[11:35] mule and he said yes you're you're my
[11:38] donkey and have I have I ever not
[11:41] carried you have I ever failed you no
[11:43] you haven't if I had a sword I'd kill
[11:46] you I'd stop this meeting I'm on my road
[11:49] down there to stop that bunch of holy
[11:50] rollers from coming through this land I'
[11:52] I'd put it on See, and the first thing
[11:55] you know, you had to look
[11:57] around. You thought, "Well, this is
[11:59] funny. I can hear that mule
[12:03] talking." Oh,
[12:09] Bum. See, God's always spoken unknown
[12:12] tongues to people. Even in the days, you
[12:15] said that's just on Pentecostal. Oh, no,
[12:18] no, no. That bell says your feast. He
[12:21] spoke in tongues. Amen. Wrote it out on
[12:23] the wall. They had a man there had the
[12:25] gift of interpretation. So he
[12:27] interpreted for him. Told him what it
[12:28] was. Same things today.
[12:31] So being that there was no interpreter
[12:33] to it, God just let this old bail him
[12:35] wake up this cardinal and realize what
[12:38] it was. And did you know that blind
[12:42] fellow went right on
[12:43] anyhow? Sure. That's the way they do it
[12:46] today. Same thing. the Moanites,
[12:48] Nickelians, going right on. And he went
[12:51] right on over there and he went, now
[12:53] watch, if God had to
[12:55] regard
[12:57] fundamentalism, he was duty bound to
[13:00] bless Moab because notice Balum built
[13:05] seven altars. That's exactly the number
[13:08] seven. Seven church ages. See how the
[13:10] spiritual application? Now, hold that.
[13:12] Now, spiritual application, I'm going to
[13:14] get to it in a minute in a hard place.
[13:16] See the spiritual application. Seven
[13:20] altars, seven blocks, clean animals, and
[13:25] seven
[13:27] rams. Speaking of the coming of
[13:31] Christ, hundreds of years before he
[13:33] came. But they believed. What did they
[13:36] believe? They believed in Jehovah God.
[13:38] What else did they believe? They
[13:40] believed that a clean sacrifice was to
[13:42] be offered. That's right. And they
[13:45] claimed that they believed that the
[13:47] Messiah was coming because he offered a
[13:49] a male sheep which was a ram. Is that
[13:52] right?
[13:54] Now you just tie for the Baptist one
[13:56] time. Find out if you don't do the same
[13:59] thing. It's exactly right. Well, what's
[14:02] the difference? Here's Israel down at
[14:03] the bottom of the hill offering the same
[14:06] offerings that they offered up here
[14:08] praying to the same
[14:09] God. Can't you see the Nickeladians?
[14:12] Amen. Amen. The hybrid. Amen. See it?
[14:17] Don't you see the true spiritual? What
[14:20] was the difference of them? One of them
[14:23] had signs following. Amen. The other had
[14:26] the farm. The other had signs following.
[14:29] Amen. That's the same thing had taken
[14:31] place here. The nine council nickelians
[14:36] formal
[14:38] Christianity. And the Holy Spirit comes
[14:40] back and said, "You've got the doctrine
[14:42] of Balum among you." Amen.
[14:45] See, and you I hate them deeds of the
[14:48] nickels, them doctrines that they got
[14:51] because it's a doctrine of Balum who
[14:54] taught the children of Israel to
[14:55] stumble. How did he do it then? When he
[14:57] went out to curse that people, God said,
[15:00] "I'll type your tongue. You can't stand
[15:02] what I tell you. You can't curse what
[15:03] I've
[15:04] blessed." So he looked down there and
[15:06] look at this hypocrite. Oh, we just run
[15:09] on out with it. See, look at this old
[15:11] king big the the the the head of all of
[15:14] it. Told this your false prophet said,
[15:17] "Go down there and just look at the back
[15:19] part of
[15:20] them." That's the way the the big
[15:23] churches like to say to God's little
[15:25] minority. Amen. You know what? I know
[15:29] one of them, boy. You know what he done?
[15:31] He he did this and he did that. That was
[15:33] Pentecostals. Sure. Oh, but if you just
[15:36] know the truth about them, but papers
[15:39] and things will keep that quiet. But let
[15:41] a little Pentecostal get out of the rise
[15:43] sometime and watch how the whole country
[15:45] blars it out. Sure. Yes, sir. But now
[15:48] notice he said just look at the back
[15:50] part. The back the worst part of it.
[15:52] They don't said, "Yeah, I just look at
[15:53] the back part, that bad part. What they
[15:55] do? That's what I'll do. I'll just look
[15:57] at the their honoriness. They're no good
[15:59] because he's looking at the no good.
[16:00] They wasn't." That's right. They had
[16:03] done every sin on the calendar. But what
[16:05] he failed to see, he failed to see that
[16:08] smitten rock.
[16:11] That bright serpent, that joy of the
[16:14] king among them, healing signs, wonder,
[16:18] that poor fire hanging over him. That
[16:20] blinded prophet couldn't see it. No,
[16:23] sir. But he's showing the dirty part of
[16:26] Well, I know one runway with another
[16:27] man's wife. I I know this. He stole some
[16:29] money. That's right. That's right. I'll
[16:31] admit that they got the same thing over
[16:33] there, but they didn't say anything
[16:34] about it.
[16:35] So just showing the worst part, but

[30:48] when you come open in a word of prayer.

[31:03] salvation.

[31:26] Dear
[31:27] Lord, we just thank you, Lord, for the
[31:30] truth, Lord, that you've given us, Lord
[31:33] Jesus. May this truth be brought to us
[31:36] today, Lord, through your word, Lord.
[31:39] May you join us, Lord. Bless this group
[31:42] this morning, Lord.
[31:44] We thank you Lord for everything that
[31:47] you provided for us. Lord, you're a
[31:50] great and loving God. We just thank you
[31:54] Lord. We ask this all in Jesus Christ's
[31:57] name.
[31:59] Amen. Amen. How many can say I was happy
[32:02] they said let's go into the house of the
[32:04] Lord. Amen.
[32:07] I I'm happy to be here today. Amen. We
[32:11] have just been having seems like the
[32:13] service just getting better and better
[32:14] and more expectation and just the
[32:17] freedom of of the spirit to move in our
[32:19] midst. And I just pray that he just
[32:21] continues to finish. We don't have to
[32:23] pray. He's going to we have the promise.
[32:24] He's going to finish the good work that
[32:26] he started in us. But let's just pray
[32:29] that anything we're doing that slows
[32:31] down that process that he would just
[32:33] show it to us, quicken that to us, and
[32:35] and we just die out a little more to
[32:37] ourselves today. I think that's each of
[32:38] our desire today. Amen. Every day with
[32:41] Jesus is sweeter than the day
[32:44] before. Every day with Jesus always
[32:49] sweeter than the day
[32:52] before. Every day with
[32:55] Jesus, oh, I love him more and

[34:18] for. Every day with
[34:22] Jesus is sweeter than the day
[34:27] before. You can be seated if you'd like.
[34:30] Well, he is my
[34:33] everything. He is my
[34:38] home. He is my
[34:42] everything. Both great and
[34:47] small. He gave his life for
[34:51] me. Made everything new.
[34:57] He is my
[35:00] everything. Now, how about you? Well,
[35:04] some folks may ask you. Some folks may
[35:08] ask
[35:09] me. And some folks may
[35:14] say, "Who is this
[35:19] Jesus that you talk
[35:21] about every day? He is my
[35:27] savior. He set me free. He set me
[35:32] free. Now listen. Now listen while I
[35:36] tell you just what he means means to me.
[35:41] I trust we can all sing this morning. He
[35:44] is my
[35:46] everything. Yes, he is my all.
[35:52] He is my
[35:56] everything both great and
[36:01] small. He gave his life for
[36:05] me. Made everything
[36:10] new. He is my everything.
[36:16] Now, how about
[36:18] [Music]
[36:20] you? Well, you know, we sing that song
[36:24] sometimes and that he's my Lord and that
[36:27] he wants to be ruler of all the kingdoms
[36:29] of your heart. And, you know, just we're
[36:32] thinking that he's my everything, both
[36:34] great and small. And I just think of it
[36:36] that way. You know, is he my everything?
[36:39] Is he Lord of every kingdom of my heart
[36:41] or is there a door that I'm keeping shut
[36:43] from him this morning? And so let's just
[36:45] How many want him to have complete
[36:47] control? Get out of the flood light in
[36:50] your lives this morning and just search
[36:52] and we can leave here and say he is my
[36:55] everything. Maybe he wasn't when I
[36:56] walked in, but Lord I I thank you for
[36:58] showing me where I was falling short and
[37:00] Lord you are my everything. Amen. Oh
[37:03] welcome Holy
[37:05] [Music]
[37:07] Spirit. Oh we are in your presence.
[37:14] Fill us with your
[37:17] power. Live inside of

[37:24] Holy
[37:27] Spirit. Oh, we are in your
[37:32] presence. Fill us with your
[37:38] power. Live inside of me.
[37:43] And you're the living
[37:47] water, the never drying
[37:53] fountain, comforter and
[37:58] counelor. Take complete
[38:03] control. Oh, welcome Holy Spirit.
[38:09] For we are in your
[38:13] presence. Fill us with your
[38:16] [Music]
[38:19] power. Live inside of
[38:22] me. You're the living. Yes, you're the
[38:25] living
[38:28] water, the ever drying
[38:34] fountain, comforter and
[38:39] counelor. Take complete
[38:43] [Music]
[38:44] control. Welcome Holy
[38:49] Spirit. We are in your presence.
[38:56] Fill us with your
[38:58] [Music]
[39:00] power. Live inside of
[39:07] me. Hallelujah. Let's change the key of
[39:10] B flat if we
[39:13] could. Amen. Thankfully, he brought me
[39:16] out the miry clay. He set my feet on the
[39:19] rock to stay.
[39:21] My heart was distressed neath Jehovah's
[39:26] red frown. Oh, and low in the pit where
[39:30] my sins dragged me
[39:32] down. Cried to the Lord from the deep my
[39:38] clay who tenderly brought me out to
[39:42] golden day. And he brought me out of the
[39:48] mighty clay. Yes. He put a song in my
[39:55] rock to stay. And he puts a song in my
[40:00] soul today. It's a song of praise.
[40:07] Hallelujah. And then he placed me upon a
[40:12] strong rock by his side. My steps were
[40:17] established and here all abide. There's
[40:21] no danger of falling well. Here I
[40:26] remain, but I'll stand by his grace
[40:30] until the crown I gave. For he brought
[40:35] me out of the mighty clay. And he set my
[40:41] feet on the rock to
[40:45] stay. He put a song in my soul today.
[40:52] It's a song of praise now. And he gave
[40:56] me a new song. Well, he gave me a song.
[41:01] Was a new song of praise.
[41:05] By day and by night, the sweet
[41:09] notes on my heart, my
[41:12] heart. I'm so happy and I am free. I'm
[41:16] going to praise my redeemer who's
[41:21] rescued me. For he brought me out of the
[41:27] bar.
[41:30] And he set my feet on the rock to
[41:35] stay. He put a song in my soul
[41:41] today. A song of praise. Hallelujah. And
[41:46] I'll sing of his wonderful mercy. I'll
[41:49] sing of his
[41:51] wonderful mercy to me. I'm going to
[41:55] praise him, too. All men's goodness
[41:59] shall see. I will sing of
[42:03] salvation and all men abroad till many
[42:09] will hear the truth and trust in
[42:12] God. Oh, he brought me out of the mighty
[42:19] glaze. Yes, he put us on the rock to
[42:24] stay. Hey, he put a
[42:29] song. Oh, hallelujah. Wonder if we could
[42:32] just sing that third verse one more time
[42:34] together. He gave me a song. It was a
[42:36] new song of praise. He gave me a song.
[42:41] It was a new song of praise. By day and
[42:46] by night, his sweet
[42:49] notes. Oh my heart, my heart is
[42:52] overflowing.
[42:54] I'm so happy and free. I will praise my
[42:59] redeemer who's rescued me. For he
[43:05] brought me out of the mighty claim. Oh,
[43:11] he set my feet on the rock to
[43:16] stay. He put a song in my soul today.
[43:23] A song of praise.
[43:27] [Music]
[43:31] Hallelujah. Oh, glorious
[43:35] victory. That day he set me
[43:38] free and made my
[43:42] heart his very throne. My life is no
[43:46] longer My life is no longer mine. I'm a
[43:50] prisoner. I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[43:53] Now I live and now I
[43:57] live to praise his
[44:01] name. Oh who I am
[44:06] Lord who I
[44:09] am. Oh I can see
[44:13] now just who I am.
[44:19] A part of my
[44:22] savior, a part of his
[44:26] word. It's a
[44:30] revelation of who I
[44:34] am. On Calvary, he
[44:38] died to redeem his lost bride.
[44:43] The king of
[44:47] kings became my
[44:49] [Applause]
[44:51] savior. This is God's great
[44:55] mystery of love expressed to
[44:59] me that Christ and
[45:03] I might be made
[45:08] one. Oh I am Lord.
[45:13] Oh, who I
[45:16] am. Oh, I can see
[45:21] now just who I
[45:25] am. I'm a part of my
[45:30] Savior, a part of his
[45:34] word. It's a
[45:38] revelation of who? Let's sing that first
[45:41] verse one more time. Oh glorious
[45:43] victory. Oh glorious victory. That day
[45:47] he set me free. The day he set me
[45:52] free and he made my
[45:56] heart his very
[46:01] throne. My heart is no longer mine. I'm
[46:05] a
[46:07] prisoner of love divine.
[46:11] And now I live. Let's stand as we praise
[46:15] his name. We praise his
[46:19] name. Oh, who I am,
[46:24] Lord. Who I
[46:28] am. Oh, I can't see
[46:32] now just who I am.
[46:38] I'm a part of my
[46:41] savior, a part of his
[46:46] word. It's a
[46:49] revelation. It's predestination. It's
[46:53] predestination of who? Of who? Sing that
[46:58] one more time.
[47:00] Oh, who I am,
[47:04] Lord. It's who I
[47:07] am. Thank you, Lord, for I can see
[47:13] now just who I
[47:17] am. A part of my
[47:22] Savior, a part of his
[47:26] word. It's a
[47:30] [Music]
[47:31] revelation. It's
[47:36] predestination of who I
[47:39] [Music]
[47:41] am.
[47:44] Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Ben, if you
[47:46] could come and take the prayer request
[47:48] for us and and the offering. Amen. God
[47:52] is so good. How many just want to slip
[47:54] their hands up? Maybe they didn't take
[47:56] the time to write out a request this
[47:57] morning, but just have an unspoken need
[47:59] on your
[48:00] heart. Amen. We didn't take the time to
[48:04] turn in a praise report, but my sister
[48:06] Jill had their fourth grandchild was
[48:09] born yesterday, so sharing a birthday
[48:12] with my daughter-in-law Emma. So, we
[48:14] just are thankful for for both of them.
[48:17] Amen. But we just thank God for his
[48:21] goodness, his
[48:23] faithfulness. Amen. He knows what's
[48:25] behind each hand that was lifted this
[48:28] morning. If you could take the rest of
[48:32] it, I guess we don't have any petitions
[48:34] this morning.
[48:36] So, kind of want to share a little
[48:38] thought that's in my heart real
[48:42] quick. Let's pray that God would give us
[48:45] a tender heart that we can be pliable to
[48:49] his
[48:50] will. Because I was thinking, who are we
[48:54] anyhow?
[48:57] You know, sometimes the prophet said
[49:00] that we go out with our noses up high
[49:03] that if it would rain, we would
[49:06] drown. And I'm speaking to me so you
[49:10] won't get
[49:11] [Music]
[49:13] offended. But the prophet said we're
[49:16] only 84 cents.
[49:18] That's all we're worth in this
[49:21] flesh. 84 cents. You know that we could
[49:25] be a corpse in the morning and be six
[49:27] foot under and no and we'd be forgotten
[49:31] so
[49:33] quick. That's something to think
[49:36] about. But you know what he the prophet
[49:39] said? That that seed that's inside of
[49:42] us is worth more than a million worlds.
[49:48] Brother Joe, you could you could fact
[49:51] check me on that. That's the truth. He
[49:54] said
[49:56] that we are this seed is worth more than
[50:00] a million worlds. Isn't that
[50:03] tremendous? Oh God, help us this
[50:06] morning, Lord,
[50:08] to open our hearts that he could give us
[50:10] a heart of flesh and be tender.
[50:15] Why shouldn't we worship him with all
[50:17] our hearts for what he's done for us?
[50:21] I got a gratitude in my heart like never
[50:24] before. I love the Lord Jesus with all
[50:27] my heart. Thank you, Lord. Let's pray.
[50:34] Lord Jesus, we want to thank you this
[50:37] morning.
[50:38] Lord, for being so good to us, Lord, for
[50:41] giving us a predestinated seed inside of
[50:45] our heart, Lord, that's worth more than
[50:47] a million worlds because you created the
[50:52] universe and we were in you even when
[50:56] you were creating the universe.
[51:01] Oh God, the prophet said without one of
[51:03] your predestinated seeds, you're
[51:07] incomplete. Oh Lord, that's how much you
[51:11] love us. We got to admit it. You love
[51:14] us, Lord. And we love you, too, Lord. We
[51:17] were with you before the foundation of
[51:20] the world. Back in your mind, the
[51:22] prophet said, "Oh, how grateful we
[51:25] should be this morning, Lord. We want to
[51:29] worship you, Lord, with that thought in
[51:32] our heart, Lord. That you're so awesome,
[51:35] Lord. You're the creator of the
[51:38] universe. Everything that was created,
[51:41] visible and
[51:42] invisible, oh, and you're our father. We
[51:45] come from your loins, oh
[51:47] God. Oh, God. I pray this morning that
[51:50] you would speak to us, Lord. That you
[51:53] would use Brother Israel, Lord God. that
[51:56] you would place it in his heart, Lord
[51:59] God, that speak the words of life, Lord,
[52:02] to us. For you, you you
[52:06] you said that you wanted to use man to
[52:11] bring the gospel. You could have used
[52:12] the wind. You could have used trees, but
[52:15] you use man, the foolishness of
[52:17] preaching. Lord, you woke that seed up
[52:20] inside of us, Lord. Oh, God. Thank you,
[52:23] Lord, this morning, Lord. We bless you.
[52:26] Give you honor and glory. Lord, we pray
[52:30] for the sick and the afflicted, Lord.
[52:32] Those that are tormented in the mind. I
[52:35] go down the streets driving the streets
[52:37] and I see their faces, oh God.
[52:40] Tormented, Lord, in prison. So in
[52:43] prisons now, oh God. But it's not so in
[52:47] our case, Lord. because we have
[52:50] rapturing faith to be changed and taken
[52:54] away. Quoting a song, Lord. Glory,
[52:57] glory, glory, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I
[53:00] love you, Lord. Bless the tithes and
[53:03] offerings, Lord, that you could use them
[53:05] for the furthers of your kingdom, Lord,
[53:07] as we commit this service into your
[53:10] hands. Let your will be done, Lord.
[53:12] Thank you, Father. We ask it in the name
[53:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[53:24] of
[53:25] [Music]
[53:30] Jehovah,
[53:32] God
[53:37] Almighty. You're the
[53:39] prince of peace.
[53:45] [Music]
[53:47] Trles
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:53] van
[53:54] hearts are
[53:57] [Music]
[54:00] mened in the
[54:08] presence of the king.
[54:16] Amen. We'll sing one more chorus as the
[54:17] Ray family comes to sing for us. So good
[54:19] to see them this morning. Welcome. I
[54:21] don't think brother John's going to be
[54:23] singing, but the rest of the family will
[54:24] be singing for us this morning. So,
[54:27] amen. How many can say, "Lord, here I am
[54:29] to worship this morning." So good to see
[54:31] our brothers and sisters, but Lord, the
[54:33] reason I'm here is to worship you today.
[54:36] Amen.
[54:38] Light of the world, you step out into
[54:45] darkness. Open my eyes. Let me
[54:53] see. Beauty that
[54:56] made this
[54:58] heart adore you. Hope of a life spent
[55:05] with you.
[55:08] [Music]
[55:10] Lord, here I am to
[55:14] worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I
[55:20] am to
[55:21] say that you're my God.
[55:26] You are all together
[55:30] lovely, allto together
[55:34] worthy, allto together
[55:38] wonderful to me.
[55:42] King of all
[55:44] days. King of all
[55:47] days. Oh, so
[55:50] highly
[55:53] exalted. Glorious in
[55:56] heaven
[56:00] above. And humbly you
[56:04] came to the earth. You
[56:08] created all for love's sake became
[56:15] [Music]
[56:18] poor. Here I am to
[56:23] worship. Here I am to bow down. Here I
[56:28] am to
[56:30] say that you're my God.
[56:35] You are all together
[56:39] lovely, allto
[56:41] together
[56:43] worthy, allto
[56:45] together
[56:47] wonderful to
[56:51] me. So here I am to
[56:55] [Music]
[56:59] worship. Here I am to
[57:03] worship.
[57:08] Here I am to
[57:12] [Music]
[57:15] worship. Amen.
[57:18] Hallelujah. Amen. You can be seated. And
[57:21] just just kept thinking that I should
[57:24] mention there's was announced Wednesday
[57:27] last Sunday there were several
[57:28] conventions that were going on.
[57:30] Different churches were hosting this
[57:32] past weekend. So, we have looking out.
[57:34] There's a number that are missing from
[57:36] us this morning that are gone. But just
[57:39] pray the Lord will keep everybody safe
[57:40] on the road. Just
[57:43] uh nothing is ever too small to ask and
[57:46] just comes on your heart. Just ask that
[57:48] we would just remember each of of them
[57:50] in prayer as they're traveling back and
[57:52] Lord will refresh them wherever they are
[57:54] and they'll be a blessing wherever they
[57:55] are but just keep them safe till they
[57:57] come back again. Amen.
[58:01] We're so happy to be here and see all of
[58:02] you guys again. We missed you all. Hope
[58:04] you guys know that we love you and just
[58:06] a really simple course. I'm just getting
[58:09] my voice back. I didn't have any voice a
[58:10] couple days ago. So, just bear with me.
[58:18] [Music]
[58:36] I've
[58:37] [Music]
[58:39] been right from
[58:43] wrong. But in every
[58:46] situation, God gave blessed
[58:49] consolation that my trials only come to
[58:53] make me strong.
[58:58] Through it
[59:01] all, through it
[59:04] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[59:08] I've learned to trust in
[59:11] God. Through it
[59:14] all, through it
[59:17] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[59:23] word.
[59:26] I've been a lot of
[59:28] places. I've seen a lot of faces. There
[59:32] were times I felt so all alone.
[59:39] But in my lonely hours, yes, those
[59:43] precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know
[59:48] that I was his
[59:52] own. Through it
[59:56] all, through it
[59:59] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:00:03] I've learned to trust in
[1:00:06] God. Through it
[1:00:09] all, through it
[1:00:12] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[1:00:17] word.
[1:00:20] Through it
[1:00:23] all, through it
[1:00:26] all, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:00:30] I've learned to trust in God.
[1:00:34] Through it
[1:00:36] all, through it
[1:00:39] all, I've learned to depend upon his
[1:00:43] word.
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:52] [Applause]
[1:00:58] Amen. Still a work in progress. I can't
[1:01:01] say that I always just completely have
[1:01:04] faith in God that he's going to honor
[1:01:07] his word. And there's times we do have
[1:01:09] anxiety. Even though he tells us to be
[1:01:10] anxious for nothing, but in all things
[1:01:12] and prayer and supplication, but we find
[1:01:15] ourselves worrying and how's he going to
[1:01:18] take care of this and how's he going to
[1:01:20] work this situation out. But he just
[1:01:22] wants us to trust in him. And I'm so
[1:01:24] glad that we have his word that we can
[1:01:28] depend on this morning. It changes not.
[1:01:30] It's And we have the promise. He's the
[1:01:33] same yesterday, today, and forever. So
[1:01:34] we can look back at a Bible full of
[1:01:37] things that he's done and know that he's
[1:01:38] the same God today. Amen. So thankful
[1:01:41] for that. Amen. Fill my way every day
[1:01:45] with love. We'll sing that. We turn the
[1:01:47] service over to our pastor this morning.
[1:01:50] Well, let me walk, blessed Lord, in the
[1:01:55] way thou has gone, leading straight to
[1:01:59] the land
[1:02:02] above, just giving cheer
[1:02:06] everywhere to the sand and alone. Fill
[1:02:10] my way every day with love.

[1:02:33] a song and a smile. Fill my way every
[1:02:39] day with love. Keep me close. will keep
[1:02:44] me close to the sight of my savior and
[1:02:49] God. Let me never in
[1:02:53] darkness
[1:02:55] roam. Just keep my path free from wrath
[1:03:00] and my soul
[1:03:03] satisfied. Fill my way every day with
[1:03:08] love.
[1:03:10] Oh, fill my way every day with

[1:03:28] a song and with a smile. Fill my way
[1:03:33] every day with love and soon the race
[1:03:37] will be yours. Soon the race will be old
[1:03:41] and I'll travel no more but abide in my
[1:03:47] home
[1:03:50] above. So let me sing. Oh blessed king
[1:03:55] all the way to the shore. Fill my way
[1:04:00] every day with let's stand as we worship
[1:04:04] him again. Oh, fill my way every day
[1:04:09] with
[1:04:11] love as I walk with the
[1:04:15] heavenly
[1:04:18] dumb. Let me go all the while with a
[1:04:23] song and a smile. Fill my way every day
[1:04:30] with love. Sing that last verse one more
[1:04:32] time. Oh, soon the race will be over and
[1:04:36] I'll travel no more but abide in my home
[1:04:45] above. Let me sing. Blessed King all the
[1:04:51] way to the shore. Lord, fill my way
[1:04:55] every day with love.

[1:06:23] Fill my way every day with your love,
[1:06:28] Lord Jesus.
[1:06:30] As I walk with the glory, hallelujah,
[1:06:36] amen. Let me go all the
[1:06:41] while and a smile. Fill my way every day
[1:06:48] with love. Amen. Let's give the Lord a
[1:06:51] hand of
[1:06:52] praise. Amen. Glory to
[1:06:56] God. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:00] That's our desire to be filled with the
[1:07:04] love of God. Amen. God bless you,
[1:07:07] saints. It's so good to be in the house
[1:07:09] of the Lord with you, to see our friends
[1:07:11] here and each of you that's gathered in
[1:07:14] his name. Let us go to the Lord in
[1:07:17] prayer a moment. Heavenly Father, we
[1:07:20] come before you this morning asking your
[1:07:23] blessings on the preaching of your word.
[1:07:27] We feel your presence already, Lord. And
[1:07:29] your Holy Spirit is with us and we're so
[1:07:33] glad for that, Lord. I wouldn't take
[1:07:35] nothing for the old fashioned meeting,
[1:07:38] Lord. The Holy Ghost coming down and
[1:07:41] washing us and Lord, and praising and
[1:07:44] giving you thanks. You've been so good
[1:07:46] to us, Lord. We have a reason. We have a
[1:07:50] reason to shout this morning and to call
[1:07:54] upon your name in thanksgiving.
[1:07:56] Oh God, you redeemed your people today.
[1:08:00] You set us free, Lord. And I'm so glad
[1:08:03] to be set free.
[1:08:06] Lord, we ask your blessings now as we
[1:08:09] come to this portion of the service.
[1:08:11] Speak to every heart, the youngest one
[1:08:15] to the oldest one is our prayer in
[1:08:17] Jesus'
[1:08:19] name. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:22] Amen. So God bless you saints. Amen. So
[1:08:26] happy to be with you this morning. We
[1:08:28] like to go right into the word. So good
[1:08:30] to see the rays, my good friends. Amen.
[1:08:33] God bless them and each of you. Any
[1:08:35] other visitors that are here? Good to
[1:08:37] see the brother Allan, John Allen there.
[1:08:40] Amen. And saints there. Each of you glad
[1:08:44] to have you here with us. And greet the
[1:08:46] saints in Mesa as well. Pray the Lord
[1:08:49] willing bless them. Brother Art and the
[1:08:52] faithful ones that are helping us
[1:08:55] helping out us out with the work there.
[1:08:58] Um, in the scriptures, we like to turn
[1:09:01] to
[1:09:03] uh two places here in Hebrews chapter
[1:09:09] 10. We actually have three places.
[1:09:11] Hebrews chapter
[1:09:13] 10, Hebrews chapter 1, and also in
[1:09:19] Numbers. The prophet of God picked up
[1:09:21] Numbers in the Sunday school
[1:09:23] this morning. Those of you that were
[1:09:26] here, and he
[1:09:28] asked us to read
[1:09:31] that, if you caught that, he said, "Read
[1:09:33] that when you get a chance." And it's it
[1:09:36] just worked right in line with what we
[1:09:39] were
[1:09:40] bringing on this great purge that we've
[1:09:43] been talking about. Hebrews
[1:09:46] chapter 10, we'll take
[1:09:50] first verse number one and two. For the
[1:09:55] law having a shadow of good things to
[1:09:58] come, and not the very image of the
[1:10:00] things which can never with those
[1:10:03] sacrific with those sacrifices which
[1:10:06] they offer year by year continually make
[1:10:09] the comers there unto perfect.
[1:10:13] For then would they not have ceased to
[1:10:15] be offered because that the worshipper
[1:10:18] once
[1:10:19] purged should have no more conscience of
[1:10:24] sin. Amen. Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:10:37] God, who at sunundry times in diverse
[1:10:41] manner spake in times past unto the
[1:10:44] fathers by the prophets, hath in these
[1:10:47] last days spoken to us by his son, whom
[1:10:51] he hath appointed heir of all things, by
[1:10:53] whom also he made the worlds, who being
[1:10:58] the brightness of his glory, and the
[1:11:00] express image of his person,
[1:11:02] and and upholding all things by the word
[1:11:04] of his power. When he had by himself
[1:11:07] purged our sins, sat down on the right
[1:11:11] hand of the Majesty on high, being made
[1:11:16] so much better than the angels, as he
[1:11:18] hath by inheritance obtained a more
[1:11:22] excellent name than they.
[1:11:26] Amen. God bless you. Uh we'll take one
[1:11:30] more scripture.
[1:11:32] in
[1:11:34] Numbers. Chapter
[1:11:55] 22 and verse chapter 23, pardon me.
[1:12:06] In verse
[1:12:08] 11, and Ba said unto Balam, "What hast
[1:12:12] thou done unto me? I took thee to curse
[1:12:16] my enemies, and behold, thou has blessed
[1:12:20] them all
[1:12:21] together." Amen. Let us pray one more
[1:12:24] time. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings
[1:12:27] on your word. bless your people we pray
[1:12:30] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You
[1:12:34] may be seated. We're speaking on the
[1:12:37] great purge again. This is number five.
[1:12:40] But uh the title is our sins
[1:12:43] purged. Our sins are
[1:12:46] purged. How many thank God for that?
[1:12:49] Amen. Amen. Now last week we uh took the
[1:12:53] book of Jude and we read out of the book
[1:12:56] of Jude where the Cain and Bale and
[1:13:01] um um Kora rose up against Moses and we
[1:13:06] had to bring out those things that these
[1:13:09] false brothers and the il illegitimate
[1:13:14] child came a false prophet in Balum and
[1:13:18] then a disgruntled first cousin of Moses
[1:13:22] Kora. We had to bring those out. But
[1:13:24] then at the end of the chapter there, we
[1:13:26] read in Jude, "But ye
[1:13:28] beloved, building up yourselves on the
[1:13:31] most holy faith, keep yourselves in the
[1:13:34] love of
[1:13:35] God, looking for the mercy of our Lord
[1:13:39] Jesus Christ unto eternal life." Verse
[1:13:43] 22 says, "And of some have
[1:13:47] compassion making a difference. and
[1:13:50] another save with fear, pulling them out
[1:13:52] of the fire, hating even the garment
[1:13:55] spotted by flesh. Look at 24. Now unto
[1:13:59] him that is able to keep you from
[1:14:02] falling and to present you faultless
[1:14:05] before the presence of his glory with
[1:14:09] exceeding joy.
[1:14:11] Now, he's able to keep you from falling,
[1:14:14] and he's the one that presents you or
[1:14:16] that will present you faultless.
[1:14:20] um this um portion of the word that we
[1:14:24] read
[1:14:25] here, keeping yourselves from the world,
[1:14:29] unspotted from the world, and this great
[1:14:32] sacrifice that was laid for us at
[1:14:37] Calvary. It is open to us in a greater
[1:14:41] measure as a prophet has revealed to us
[1:14:44] the revelation of the seven seals.
[1:14:48] Because of this great revelation, we can
[1:14:51] go deeper as the word directs us through
[1:14:56] the opening of his word to us in this
[1:14:58] hour. We know that many things were
[1:15:01] hidden from before the foundation of the
[1:15:04] world. Jesus spoke of this and he said
[1:15:08] that he would speak to them in
[1:15:10] mysteries and that uh things that they
[1:15:14] had never heard before. This is why he
[1:15:16] spoke to them in parables. Let me find
[1:15:19] one place here where Jesus speaks of
[1:15:21] this. It's in I believe it's in Matthew
[1:15:27] um
[1:15:28] 13 and verse 34.
[1:15:32] All these things spake Jesus unto the
[1:15:34] multitude in parables, and without a
[1:15:38] parable spake he not unto them, that it
[1:15:41] might be fulfilled which was spoken by
[1:15:43] the prophet, saying, I will open my
[1:15:46] mouth in parables. I will utter things
[1:15:49] which have been kept secret from the
[1:15:52] foundation of the world. So our Lord
[1:15:55] Jesus is speaking parables and opening
[1:15:59] up things scriptures to the Pharisees
[1:16:01] and Sadducees who were students of the
[1:16:05] law of Moses. They were
[1:16:07] professionals in the law of Moses. But
[1:16:10] here Jesus is now speaking things that
[1:16:14] had been hidden from before the
[1:16:17] foundation of the world. And he spoke to
[1:16:20] them in parables and he laid it out to
[1:16:23] them ever so like a childlike ministry.
[1:16:28] It was unlike any other ministry that
[1:16:31] we've heard. But it was the greatest
[1:16:34] ministry. It was the God of creation now
[1:16:38] revealing himself to his people in the
[1:16:42] office of the son of God. Amen. Now, the
[1:16:46] prophet of God shares with
[1:16:48] us, and I've done this before, some of
[1:16:52] the things that had been revealed to us
[1:16:56] since the opening of the seven seals.
[1:17:00] And in the message, is this the sign of
[1:17:02] the end, sir, as the prophet brings out
[1:17:06] Revelations 10:7 that this great angel
[1:17:08] to come would bring the mysteries to us.
[1:17:13] Now, our churches, saints, are not like
[1:17:16] any other church, or it shouldn't be.
[1:17:18] Um, people that are listening to this
[1:17:23] message are different than people that
[1:17:27] are not listening to it. The way we
[1:17:30] conduct ourselves is a reflection on
[1:17:34] what we listen to on them tapes.
[1:17:37] the way we praise and worship the Lord.
[1:17:40] It's a direct reflection on what we've
[1:17:43] listened to in the message of the hour.
[1:17:46] So, I can't I can't compare myself with
[1:17:49] no other group of people. I can only
[1:17:52] compare myself with what's on them
[1:17:55] tapes, what's in the Bible, because that
[1:18:00] was the example set for us in the days
[1:18:02] of the voice of the seventh angel. When
[1:18:06] he shall begin to sound, the mysteries,
[1:18:09] the mysteries of God should be finished.
[1:18:12] Is that right, saints? We're not just
[1:18:15] anybody. Don't downplay yourself. God
[1:18:18] has opened his word to you. He's done
[1:18:20] the greatest thing that he can do to
[1:18:22] you. He has revealed his secrets to you.
[1:18:28] There's many that go to school looking
[1:18:30] for these
[1:18:32] mysteries, looking for God to speak to
[1:18:35] them. And God has spoke to us. And we
[1:18:39] are the people of God. We are the
[1:18:43] children of the most high God. Our God
[1:18:47] is God and he's revealed himself to us.
[1:18:51] We're not ashamed of that, saints. Yes,
[1:18:53] sir. There's no there's no Pentecostal
[1:18:56] that can out praise me. There there's no
[1:18:59] Baptist that can worship beyond what I
[1:19:01] can worship because I am a part of the
[1:19:04] original seed from before the foundation
[1:19:08] of the world. I was in his
[1:19:11] mind before the foundation of the world.
[1:19:15] And Job says, "Where were you?" God
[1:19:17] asked Job, "Where were you when the sons
[1:19:20] and daughters of God shouted for joy?"
[1:19:25] They praise the Lord.
[1:19:28] Before the foundation of the world. Is
[1:19:30] that right?
[1:19:31] Now, the prophet of God goes forward in
[1:19:34] the message uh Revelation chapter 5
[1:19:38] number two, and he says this here.
[1:19:42] Now it's a book of revelation. Paragraph
[1:19:44] 153. Say it's a book of revelation. God
[1:19:47] revealing himself. And now through these
[1:19:50] great mysteries, he's revealing the name
[1:19:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism.
[1:19:55] He's revealing that there's no such a
[1:19:56] thing as eternal hell. It cannot be.
[1:19:59] There's no scripture in the Bible says
[1:20:01] there such a thing. Now, there's a hell.
[1:20:03] There's a lake of fire where the wicked
[1:20:05] will where they're punished, but they're
[1:20:08] finally consumed. maybe 1000 million
[1:20:10] years, but they're finally consumed.
[1:20:13] Drop down to paragraph 155. Now,
[1:20:17] security. Those who he forneew, he
[1:20:19] called. Those who he called, he is
[1:20:22] justified. Those who he is justified,
[1:20:24] he's already glorified. Paul told us in
[1:20:28] the first chapter of Ephesians that God
[1:20:30] before the foundation of the world has
[1:20:33] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:20:36] sons through Christ Jesus. John tells us
[1:20:40] here in Revelation that the enemy in the
[1:20:42] last days, that religious enemy would
[1:20:45] get amongst the people and have
[1:20:47] organizations and so forth and cults and
[1:20:50] so forth as they have today and would
[1:20:53] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:20:56] possible and would deceive all whose
[1:20:59] names are not put on the Lamb's book of
[1:21:02] life since the very foundation of the
[1:21:05] world. When was your name put on the
[1:21:07] lamb's book of life? Before the
[1:21:10] foundation of the world. When was Christ
[1:21:14] slain? 1900 years ago. No, sir. Before
[1:21:18] the foundation of the world. The lamb
[1:21:21] was slain before the foundation of the
[1:21:23] world. See what it's doing? See what
[1:21:27] it's doing? It's these seals opening up.
[1:21:33] just begin to reveal the plan of
[1:21:36] redemption, how he did it. It's all over
[1:21:39] now. Just about finishing up. So, we're
[1:21:43] at the end time. So, that's why things
[1:21:46] are being revealed. Now, this is in
[1:21:50] 1961.
[1:21:52] This is before he even preached the
[1:21:54] revelation of the seven seals. And he's
[1:21:56] talking about how these seals reveals
[1:22:00] it. It opens it up. Let's go a little
[1:22:02] bit further. In the message, a man
[1:22:04] running from the presence of the Lord.
[1:22:06] This was the message brother Random
[1:22:08] preached. He was very nervous as he was
[1:22:10] bringing out the things he had to bring
[1:22:13] out the truth of marriage and divorce.
[1:22:16] Before he brings that out, he preaches
[1:22:19] this message, a man running from the
[1:22:21] presence of the Lord and talked about
[1:22:23] your
[1:22:24] responsibilities and how we all have
[1:22:26] responsibilities and we can't run from
[1:22:30] those responsibilities.
[1:22:32] as uncomfortable as they may be, as you
[1:22:36] know, challenging as it may be, we
[1:22:40] everyone have a
[1:22:42] responsibility and it would be nice if
[1:22:44] we can have things our own way, but life
[1:22:47] doesn't work that way. And neither does
[1:22:49] the word of God work that way. We have
[1:22:52] challenges that we must face. We have to
[1:22:56] go through some things. Can I get a
[1:22:57] witness here? And these are our
[1:23:01] responsibilities. My test is not your
[1:23:04] test. Your test is not somebody else's
[1:23:07] test. Everybody has their own tailor
[1:23:11] tailor made tests. They're tailor made.
[1:23:13] They're made just for you. And you've
[1:23:17] got to go through that. And God has
[1:23:19] equipped you with the power and the
[1:23:22] grace to make it through whatever you're
[1:23:25] going through. If you're 20 years old,
[1:23:27] God knew you. It'd be 20, 25, 50, 60,
[1:23:31] however old you are. God has equipped
[1:23:34] you to face the challenges for your
[1:23:38] life. No matter how old you are, single,
[1:23:41] married, grandpa, whatever you are, God
[1:23:44] has given you a responsibility.
[1:23:47] Amen.
[1:23:51] There's no dish rags here.
[1:23:54] There's no crybab in the kingdom of God.
[1:23:58] I'm talking about every member of the
[1:23:59] bride can handle the sword.
[1:24:02] If he has to cut a devil's head off,
[1:24:05] guess what he's going to do? He going to
[1:24:07] chop I don't care if it's a sister,
[1:24:09] she'll take the word of God and she'll
[1:24:11] chop that devil's head off.
[1:24:15] Yes. Yes. Hallelujah. Precious little
[1:24:18] sister so and so. whacking devil's heads
[1:24:21] off by the word of God. There's no
[1:24:24] crybab in the kingdom of God. And ain't
[1:24:27] nobody feeling sorry for nobody. No.
[1:24:31] We're believer saints. We're soldiers.
[1:24:36] And we are going to overcome.
[1:24:39] In fact, we have already overcome.
[1:24:45] You got the victory right now, sister
[1:24:47] brother. You got the victory.
[1:24:50] Hallelujah.
[1:24:52] Yes, sir. The prophet of God is in this
[1:24:56] running from the presence of the Lord.
[1:24:57] He says about this marriage and divorce,
[1:24:59] I wanted to speak on it. Ever since the
[1:25:01] time that those seals, you know, all the
[1:25:04] mysteries are supposed to be made known
[1:25:07] in the opening of them seven seals, all
[1:25:11] mysteries of the Bible. I'm thinking now
[1:25:14] I'm getting old, kind of old. And
[1:25:16] brother continues on. So in the marriage
[1:25:18] and divorce he says this about this
[1:25:21] opening of the seals. Of course he goes
[1:25:24] forward and he speaks about and who is
[1:25:27] this
[1:25:28] mechdic? Uh the opening of the seals is
[1:25:32] because the opening of the seals it
[1:25:34] revealed who this Melzdc was. But in
[1:25:37] this marriage and divorce he says this
[1:25:40] in paragraph number 80. We have also two
[1:25:43] thoughts of this marriage and divorce.
[1:25:46] Now that our Lord has opened the seven
[1:25:49] seal mystery of his word to us in this
[1:25:53] last day. Now many of you this might be
[1:25:56] Greek to you but my church
[1:26:00] understands. So he's opened up this
[1:26:04] mystery. He moves forward in paragraph
[1:26:07] 233 and he says
[1:26:10] this about this great
[1:26:13] mystery. But now that the seals are
[1:26:16] open, the spirit of truth directs us to
[1:26:20] the word. That explains why all the
[1:26:24] mistakes has bound down through the ages
[1:26:27] because the seals was not open. This was
[1:26:31] not
[1:26:32] revealed.
[1:26:34] Amen. Prophet of God continues in
[1:26:36] paragraph number 272 and he says this in
[1:26:39] this marriage and divorce. Uh he's
[1:26:42] opening it up to us. He says, "Now on
[1:26:45] the marriage and divorce," see, it has
[1:26:47] to be revealed. Until it's revealed, you
[1:26:50] don't know it. But he promised in the
[1:26:52] last days, in this age, that every
[1:26:56] hidden mystery in the Bible would be
[1:26:59] revealed.
[1:27:01] How many knows that? Revelation the 10th
[1:27:04] chapter, 10th chapter, Jesus promised it
[1:27:08] that all these hidden mysteries on
[1:27:10] marriage and divorce and all these other
[1:27:13] hidden mysteries that's been would be
[1:27:15] revealed in the end time. Now you
[1:27:18] remember the voice said go to Tucson.
[1:27:22] Remember the mystic light in the sky,
[1:27:24] the seven angels standing there come
[1:27:27] back and the opening of the seven
[1:27:31] seals. Where my picture
[1:27:33] at? Remember that mysterious light?
[1:27:37] Remember it was like a pyramid first,
[1:27:39] right?
[1:27:40] And then he was looking at it after
[1:27:42] that. Get a good look. Somebody say,
[1:27:44] "Amen."
[1:27:46] Who believes this here?
[1:27:49] Then the picture said, "Turn it to the
[1:27:50] right." He turned it to the right and
[1:27:51] what does he see?
[1:27:54] Oh. Oh, they don't like that one. They
[1:27:57] don't like these pictures. They try to
[1:28:00] take them out of our churches.
[1:28:02] No, no. We putting them up again.
[1:28:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:28:09] God likes taking pictures.
[1:28:12] And when God takes a picture, put it on
[1:28:15] the wall. You don't take it off. You put
[1:28:17] it up on the wall so you can see with
[1:28:21] your eyes.
[1:28:23] This is what I'm identifying myself
[1:28:25] with. He takes a picture. to prove that
[1:28:31] this word is true.
[1:28:35] There's a lot of pictures taken. There's
[1:28:36] a lot of pictures taken. Got your family
[1:28:39] albums and albums in your phone and
[1:28:42] photo scripts of family. You look what I
[1:28:44] ate today and picture of this and a
[1:28:46] picture of that. Look me on the
[1:28:48] mountain. Look at this picture right
[1:28:50] here. That's a picture worth showing
[1:28:53] somebody.
[1:28:56] Yes. Amen. Because the seven seals are
[1:29:00] now being
[1:29:01] opened, the prophet of God continues in
[1:29:04] paragraph number 311 in the same message
[1:29:07] on marriage and
[1:29:08] divorce. Just to highlight the message
[1:29:11] that we're in,
[1:29:12] saints, it wasn't so from the be
[1:29:15] paragraph number 11.
[1:29:24] Now, yes. Now, you believe this to be
[1:29:27] true. Believe it to come from God. By
[1:29:30] the vindication of his cloud, and his
[1:29:32] message has brought me this far. Should
[1:29:35] not God upon the mountain permit me to
[1:29:38] do the same thing, to suffer you to go
[1:29:41] the way you are, and do it no more? Go
[1:29:44] with your wives. Live in peace, for the
[1:29:47] hour is late. The coming of the Lord is
[1:29:50] at hand. We haven't got time to break
[1:29:52] these things up. Don't you dare to try
[1:29:55] to do it again. I'm speaking only to my
[1:29:59] congregation. But if you are married,
[1:30:01] God has bore me witness that on the
[1:30:03] mountain that I could say this a
[1:30:08] supernatural
[1:30:09] revelation because of the opening of the
[1:30:14] seven
[1:30:15] seals. This is a question in God's word.
[1:30:18] Let them go on in as they are and sin no
[1:30:23] more. Now, what a beautiful thing. Now,
[1:30:27] if you was never in that problem, maybe
[1:30:29] you couldn't enjoy the how beautiful it
[1:30:32] was to say your sins are forgiven.
[1:30:38] You're living in a condition that is
[1:30:40] contrary to the word. But because the
[1:30:43] seals are open, this is to my people
[1:30:46] only. Because the seals are open, you
[1:30:50] are forgiven.
[1:30:52] Go and sin no more.
[1:30:55] Isn't that nice? That is very nice. A
[1:31:00] and if you go deeper, you'll see how
[1:31:01] nice it is. But it's because it's not
[1:31:03] just marriage and divorce. It's our
[1:31:06] first
[1:31:08] original nature we were married to. He
[1:31:11] tells us in invisible union, our first
[1:31:14] nature was
[1:31:16] adulterous. Our first nature was sinful.
[1:31:20] And then the invisible union of the
[1:31:22] bridey ties that in that we were sinners
[1:31:26] to begin with.
[1:31:29] Oh, but because of the opening of the
[1:31:31] seven seals,
[1:31:33] there's grace for you. Because somebody
[1:31:36] died at Calvary, there's forgiveness for
[1:31:39] you because somebody loves you.
[1:31:44] I forgive you. Now go and sin no more.
[1:31:49] Go and disbelieve no more.
[1:31:53] I wonder how many people can receive
[1:31:54] that today.
[1:31:56] Forgiveness is a wonderful thing.
[1:31:59] But it goes even deeper than just
[1:32:02] forgiveness. Yes, it
[1:32:05] does. And we'll get into it here for a
[1:32:08] few more moments. Okay.
[1:32:10] Brother Vanov tells us God's power to
[1:32:14] transfer, transform. He says this here,
[1:32:17] paragraph 77. Now, it's hard to say
[1:32:19] this. It's very hard because speaking to
[1:32:22] people who feel the same way I do and
[1:32:25] the way I've been for many years, but
[1:32:27] since the opening of those seven seals
[1:32:30] of them angels just behind the mountain
[1:32:33] yonder, this has become a new
[1:32:36] book. It's the things that's been
[1:32:40] hid is being revealed as God promised in
[1:32:44] Revelations 10 he would do it. And we
[1:32:47] are the privileged people
[1:32:50] that God has chosen of the earth
[1:32:54] that we might see and understand these
[1:32:57] things which is not some mythical
[1:33:00] fleshly mind of a person trying to make
[1:33:03] it up. It's the word of God made
[1:33:05] manifest.
[1:33:06] Proven that it's right. Proven not by
[1:33:09] science but by God that it's right. God,
[1:33:14] as I've said before in a message, God
[1:33:16] doesn't need anyone to interpret his
[1:33:18] word. He's his own interpreter. He says
[1:33:21] it'll happen and it happens.
[1:33:25] He confirms it. That interprets it.
[1:33:33] Now, so how many's happy because the
[1:33:37] seven seals have been open?
[1:33:40] Oh, you should be grateful.
[1:33:43] This is why we got a church today
[1:33:46] because the seals have been open. This
[1:33:48] is God we got something to preach on.
[1:33:50] This is because this is this is this is
[1:33:53] why we baptize the way we baptize
[1:33:56] because the seven seals has been open.
[1:33:58] This is why you can marry somebody and
[1:34:02] trust them all the way to the end
[1:34:05] because of the seven seals. Where'd you
[1:34:08] get your wife, brother? Where'd you get
[1:34:10] your husband, sis? It had to come from
[1:34:12] the word of the Lord. And you ought to
[1:34:15] be grateful. You ought to be thankful.
[1:34:17] You ought to be the most happiest person
[1:34:21] to know that God has provided you
[1:34:25] everything that you have need of.
[1:34:28] Amen.
[1:34:30] Okay, let's go a little bit further.
[1:34:34] Now, another great mystery. As brother
[1:34:38] Brandham brings out the invisible union
[1:34:40] of the bride of Christ, he brings this
[1:34:44] great truth. Let me get one more spot
[1:34:47] that he deals with on this revelation of
[1:34:52] the seven seals. He says this in a
[1:34:56] message, Revelation chapter 5, part
[1:34:59] number two. And he makes this statement
[1:35:02] here. All
[1:35:08] right? He brings in the Old Testament
[1:35:11] type of the year of
[1:35:15] Jubilee. And as brother Brandham is
[1:35:18] bringing that type, he's showing that
[1:35:22] there is coming another year of Jubilee.
[1:35:27] And it's not an Old Testament
[1:35:31] jubilee. It's a jubilee for you and I.
[1:35:36] Huh?
[1:35:37] Looking at some of y'all, y'all need a
[1:35:40] jubilee.
[1:35:43] Your face needs a jubilee.
[1:35:46] Your praise.
[1:35:48] Your excitement needs a You need a
[1:35:50] jubilee in your expectations.
[1:35:53] Lord, send me a jubilee. What's a
[1:35:55] jubilee? That's a good time, my sister.
[1:35:59] That's a wonderful time in the things of
[1:36:01] the Lord. Lord, send this church a
[1:36:06] jubilee. Send the pastor a jubilee. Send
[1:36:10] our young people a jubilee.
[1:36:14] What is this jubilee? The jubilee says
[1:36:16] that you're free.
[1:36:18] You're free. You're free. You're free.
[1:36:22] You're free.
[1:36:24] You're free. Say it low. You're free.
[1:36:26] You're free. Spread the word you're
[1:36:29] free. Whisper. Tell somebody you're
[1:36:31] free.
[1:36:32] Yeah. Then shout it out. You're free.
[1:36:37] Glory to God.
[1:36:42] That's something you don't whisper all
[1:36:44] the
[1:36:45] time. We are free. Prophet of God takes
[1:36:48] this
[1:36:50] 1961 Revelations chapter 5 number two.
[1:36:54] Just showing that this
[1:36:56] message is a seventh seal
[1:37:00] message. It is the revelation of the
[1:37:03] word that has been open to us. Not just
[1:37:06] a series of seals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but
[1:37:11] it's the entire message.
[1:37:14] That's where your liberty is. You got to
[1:37:16] eat the whole lamb. There's no
[1:37:19] quotations that we throw to the side. We
[1:37:21] want it all. If there new tape comes
[1:37:24] out, when that new tape comes out, I'm
[1:37:26] already going to say amen. If it's the
[1:37:28] prophet before I even hear it, I can say
[1:37:31] amen to it because I'm saying amen to
[1:37:35] this ministry.
[1:37:37] I say amen to the tapes that I haven't
[1:37:39] heard yet before.
[1:37:42] Amen. Amen. Yes, I'm crazy like that.
[1:37:46] Now, some of y'all got to read it all
[1:37:48] and then after it's all said and done,
[1:37:50] you can say, "Amen." Amen. But I can say
[1:37:52] amen just so they crap. Only Billy.
[1:37:56] Amen.
[1:38:00] Sooner before they start that tape,
[1:38:02] brother John. My amen. I'm already on.
[1:38:05] Ready to go. Praise the Lord. Somebody
[1:38:09] remember in the Old Testament, a man
[1:38:11] lost his inheritance. a squatter come on
[1:38:14] his land and he could not hold it any
[1:38:17] longer for annaliation from the owner
[1:38:20] until 50 years. After 50 years, the year
[1:38:23] of Jubilee came by and the year of
[1:38:25] Jubilee, when the year of Jubilee come
[1:38:28] along, then everything went back to its
[1:38:30] original beginning again. All slaves
[1:38:33] that went back to the original
[1:38:36] beginning. If a man was hoing in the
[1:38:39] field and the trumpet sounded, he heard
[1:38:41] it, he'd throw down the hoe and say,
[1:38:43] "I'm no more a slave. I go back home to
[1:38:46] my family." Everything was given back.
[1:38:49] If a squatter was on the ground, he had
[1:38:51] to get off the ground. That's all. He's
[1:38:53] got off the ground because why? The
[1:38:56] legal owner was coming back. He had to
[1:38:58] give
[1:39:00] away. Hallelujah.
[1:39:03] One of these days, the kingdom of this
[1:39:06] world will fall and the legal owners
[1:39:11] will come in. One of these days,
[1:39:15] I'm so
[1:39:17] glad that one of these
[1:39:20] days that the meek shall inherit the
[1:39:24] earth. It belongs to the meek. It
[1:39:28] belongs to the beloved. Come on.
[1:39:33] They're destroying it today. They're
[1:39:35] fighting about it today. They're arguing
[1:39:36] today about it. But it belongs to the
[1:39:39] meek. And now
[1:39:42] there was a time it was in dispute.
[1:39:44] Let's move forward just a little bit.
[1:39:46] That's a very nice piece. I hate to skip
[1:39:48] it, but to save a little time, brother
[1:39:50] Bam goes forward in paragraph 177. Now,
[1:39:54] brethren, not to hurt your feelings,
[1:39:55] anything about it. If the organization
[1:39:57] is right, you're just a Catholic by
[1:40:02] organization. Paragraph 179. Drop it
[1:40:06] down a little bit for me. Thank you.
[1:40:08] This is what I want. Now, there will
[1:40:10] come another year of Jubilee.
[1:40:14] And that we've had it just about this
[1:40:16] time. If you notice, Pentecost has been
[1:40:19] falling in America for about 50 years.
[1:40:21] Somewhere on that time, just about 50
[1:40:23] years ago, Pentecost begin Pentecost
[1:40:26] began to fall. Now, what's happening?
[1:40:28] The church is receiving the seven sealed
[1:40:33] book of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:40:37] of the seven seals and not one tenth of
[1:40:40] them can receive it. But when you begin
[1:40:43] to see the year of Jubilee where you
[1:40:46] don't have to fuss and strain and pull
[1:40:48] like this, but we're already secured in
[1:40:52] Christ. We're already have the name of
[1:40:54] the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism. We
[1:40:57] have all these great mysteries that
[1:40:59] we're going to bring up in these seven
[1:41:01] seals and prove to you them was the
[1:41:05] seals that were sealed from the eyes of
[1:41:07] the people of God being my helper. I
[1:41:12] prove to you that they could not see
[1:41:14] that by the Bible. Then sure, if the
[1:41:17] Bible said so, you'll believe it that
[1:41:20] they could not see nothing but father,
[1:41:23] son, and holy ghost until this time.
[1:41:26] They could not see that there was no
[1:41:27] eternal herald until this time. They
[1:41:30] could not see there was no eternal
[1:41:32] security. I mean, for the real believer,
[1:41:34] of course, there's been a mock of it all
[1:41:37] the way around. Uncertain sound they
[1:41:39] give. That's the reason the people they
[1:41:42] say why look at them Presbyterians and
[1:41:45] so forth smoke drink everything else and
[1:41:47] claim they got eternal security. Brother
[1:41:50] Bam continues on yeah but you see that's
[1:41:53] to that's to throw off the real
[1:41:57] trumpet. Now we have had a trumpet sound
[1:42:02] and it's because of the opening of the
[1:42:05] seven seals that we see the things that
[1:42:08] we can see. I like in Hebrews chapter 8,
[1:42:11] it says verse one, it says this is the
[1:42:15] sum of what we've been talking about.
[1:42:17] Then he goes into we have a more
[1:42:20] excellent ministry. We have a better
[1:42:23] covenant. He says we have better
[1:42:26] promises and we have a new covenant. And
[1:42:29] what is this new covenant? The new
[1:42:30] covenant is I will put my laws into
[1:42:35] their mind.
[1:42:37] I will write them in their hearts. I'm
[1:42:40] going to do it. This is what God is
[1:42:42] going to do. I'm going to put my laws
[1:42:45] into their minds. I'm going to write it
[1:42:48] in their hearts.
[1:42:52] Does God know how to write?
[1:42:54] Yes, he does.
[1:42:57] I will be to them a God, and they shall
[1:42:59] be to me a people.
[1:43:03] They have it there. Thank you so
[1:43:05] much. For this is the covenant that I'll
[1:43:07] make with them, the house of Israel,
[1:43:09] after those days, sayeth the Lord. I
[1:43:10] will put my laws into their mind and
[1:43:13] write them in their hearts, and I will
[1:43:16] be to them a God, and they shall be to
[1:43:19] me a people, and they shall not teach
[1:43:23] every man his neighbor, knowing uh uh
[1:43:27] say uh shall sorry, every man his
[1:43:31] brother, saying, "Know the Lord, for all
[1:43:33] shall know me from the least to the
[1:43:37] greatest, for I will be merciful to
[1:43:40] to uh h um to their sins and their
[1:43:43] iniquities will I remember no more.
[1:43:48] Now these
[1:43:50] iniquities and these
[1:43:53] sins, let's talk about that just for a
[1:43:55] moment.
[1:43:57] It seems
[1:43:59] like our Christian
[1:44:02] experience has been relegated
[1:44:05] to from when we were forgiven by our
[1:44:12] Lord. We seem to go to that as our
[1:44:17] pivotal point many times. the day we got
[1:44:20] saved or we got baptized and we look
[1:44:22] back to when he forgave
[1:44:25] us and our sins seem to define us. Uh
[1:44:30] but let's let's not look at from when
[1:44:33] we're our sins when we committed sin and
[1:44:36] then we repented and then we experienced
[1:44:38] the beautiful thing of forgiveness. But
[1:44:41] let's look at before we ever sinned.
[1:44:46] That's really the true picture to look
[1:44:48] at. See, we're constantly looking at
[1:44:52] when we sinned and then we were forgiven
[1:44:55] of our sins and then we were saved in
[1:44:57] water baptism. We thank God for Calvary.
[1:45:00] That's beautiful. But really, when did
[1:45:01] Calvary happen? Not 2,000 years
[1:45:05] ago. It was before the foundation of the
[1:45:08] world. And what were you before you
[1:45:11] sinned? So Satan is always trying to
[1:45:14] bring up our past sins, but he only goes
[1:45:18] so far. What were you before sin ever
[1:45:21] entered?
[1:45:23] That is our original
[1:45:25] inheritance. That's our
[1:45:27] identification for the bride of Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ. And brother Brandham brings this
[1:45:33] revelation out to
[1:45:36] us after the opening of the seven seals.
[1:45:39] And he uses this word Romans chapter 5
[1:45:42] verse one. Therefore being justified by
[1:45:46] faith. Now this word
[1:45:48] justified the Greek word is uh Greek
[1:45:52] word 1344. I won't try to pronounce it
[1:45:55] but he said look it up. He brother says
[1:45:58] look up the word. It don't even mean
[1:46:00] forgiven at all. It means that you were
[1:46:04] declared righteous.
[1:46:07] you were made
[1:46:09] righteous. It's so far beyond
[1:46:12] forgiveness. And forgiveness isn't
[1:46:14] something that we, you know, forgiveness
[1:46:16] is a real thing because we commit sins
[1:46:19] and we have to ask God to forgive us
[1:46:20] every day. But what about
[1:46:24] justification? How does that play into
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:27] believer? Justification says you never
[1:46:31] sinned in the first place.
[1:46:34] You're all stressed out because of the
[1:46:37] mistakes that you made. But what were
[1:46:39] you doing before you ever made a
[1:46:42] mistake?
[1:46:43] What were you doing before the
[1:46:45] foundation of the world? Job says we
[1:46:48] were praising him.
[1:46:52] We were worshiping him
[1:46:55] before the foundation of the world.
[1:46:59] Amen.
[1:47:00] This is our Sunday school lesson that we
[1:47:03] saw the prophet bring to us about Balam
[1:47:06] and Bao.
[1:47:08] Let's go there
[1:47:12] quickly. It's in Numbers
[1:47:15] chapter
[1:47:16] 22 and verse number 12. It's an
[1:47:19] interesting thing it brings up here and
[1:47:21] so we'll get it. I know I won't be able
[1:47:23] to finish but I want to touch this part
[1:47:25] here.
[1:47:28] Numbers 22:1. The children of Israel set
[1:47:31] forward and pitched the plains of Moab
[1:47:34] on this side of Jordan by Jericho. Bailo
[1:47:37] the son of Zippor saw all that Israel
[1:47:40] had done to the
[1:47:44] Amorites. And so he goes forward and
[1:47:47] hires a prophet to uh stop Israel. This
[1:47:53] is where Bale's ministry begins. so to
[1:47:57] speak, doesn't really begin here because
[1:47:59] he already has a reputation that
[1:48:02] whatever he blesses, God blesses. This
[1:48:05] is why Bailo hired him. Balam was
[1:48:09] gifted. He had the same anointing that
[1:48:11] Moses had on him. He had a genuine Holy
[1:48:16] Ghost anointing on him, Brother Brandham
[1:48:18] tells us. And here's a king that has his
[1:48:22] own personal interest in his kingdom. He
[1:48:25] didn't want to lose. He didn't want his
[1:48:27] people being defiled. He didn't want to
[1:48:29] come under. He sees these people just
[1:48:32] taking up all of the country. He's heard
[1:48:34] about them. They're doing all the things
[1:48:36] that they're doing. They're moving
[1:48:38] forward. And they're not one of him. So,
[1:48:41] he needs to answer. Instead of fighting
[1:48:44] them, instead of building an army to go
[1:48:46] out against them, he hires one of them.
[1:48:51] And he he he was he was one of them in
[1:48:55] the sense of coming up under Moab and
[1:48:58] and under Lot's children because they
[1:49:00] they still had the same sacrifices Balam
[1:49:03] did. He knew about how to enter into to
[1:49:07] find the will of God. This is probably
[1:49:09] why his ministry was successful. He was
[1:49:13] a
[1:49:15] prophet with the true anointing on him.
[1:49:20] But then he got caught up with false
[1:49:23] teaching because of of an offer that was
[1:49:26] given to him. And if you're talented,
[1:49:29] gifted, or whatever you are, pretty or
[1:49:31] handsome or available, Satan always gots
[1:49:35] an offer for
[1:49:37] you. Could be a job, could be a
[1:49:39] promotion, it could be something, but
[1:49:41] it's always going to be something that
[1:49:44] causes a conflict with your relationship
[1:49:46] with the Lord. That's what you need to
[1:49:48] watch out for. I'm not talking about
[1:49:50] growing a garden. I'm not talking about
[1:49:52] fishing or riding a horse. I'm talking
[1:49:54] about anything that's in conflict with
[1:49:57] your relationship with the Lord.
[1:49:59] Remember that. Money, women, and
[1:50:01] popularity as it relates to your
[1:50:06] ministry or your calling in
[1:50:09] God. Amen.
[1:50:12] So, let's look at this just for a
[1:50:14] moment. I think I'm going to stop right
[1:50:15] here cuz I can feel this is where I need
[1:50:18] to sit down. Just on this spot right
[1:50:21] here. Here. Here is a man that wasn't
[1:50:25] looking for no position. They actually
[1:50:28] called him. Bam is doing his own thing.
[1:50:31] He's got his anointing. God has used
[1:50:34] him. He has a reputation. Read the text.
[1:50:36] This is why Bao called him. Because we
[1:50:40] know the people that you bless Yes. are
[1:50:45] blessed. So come and help me deal with
[1:50:48] these
[1:50:50] Israelites. Now remember in our journey
[1:50:53] this is after these are the years of
[1:50:57] wandering. Remember that. Remember
[1:50:59] Israel as a whole has rejected God at
[1:51:02] Kadesh
[1:51:03] Barnea and they're wandering through the
[1:51:06] wilderness now and they got 40 years of
[1:51:10] this wandering.
[1:51:14] How many saints are with me this
[1:51:15] morning? And they come up to this
[1:51:18] prophet. Bail hires Balum. Let's look at
[1:51:23] verse number
[1:51:27] 12. Verse
[1:51:33] 19. I'm I'm sorry, not 19. Verse number
[1:51:37] nine. Numbers 22:9. And God came unto
[1:51:41] Balam and said, "What men are these with
[1:51:46] thee?" Wow, that's pretty
[1:51:48] nice. God would even come and talk to
[1:51:51] him. This was a gifted man. This wasn't
[1:51:54] a nobody. This man had a gift in his
[1:51:57] life. God would hear his prayer and he
[1:51:59] was
[1:52:02] vindicated. Brother Branna brings it out
[1:52:04] to us so beautifully. It's a beautiful
[1:52:07] example and a learning spot right here.
[1:52:09] And some of y'all want me to move on,
[1:52:11] but you ain't said amen to this part
[1:52:13] yet. So, I'm gonna stay right here. And
[1:52:16] if I got to close right here, I'll close
[1:52:18] right here cuz I can't finish. I can
[1:52:20] never finish
[1:52:22] anyways, Brother Rick. I ain't going to
[1:52:24] get done. Look at your neighbor and tell
[1:52:26] him, say,
[1:52:27] neighbor, he's not going to finish
[1:52:31] today, so
[1:52:33] relax.
[1:52:36] Verse number
[1:52:38] nine. And God came unto Balam and said,
[1:52:41] "What men are these with thee?" And
[1:52:44] Balam says unto God, "Bail the son of
[1:52:47] Zapor, the king of Moab, hath sent unto
[1:52:50] me, saying, Behold, there is a people
[1:52:53] come up out of Egypt, which coverth the
[1:52:56] face of the earth. Come now, curse me
[1:52:59] them. free adventure, I shall be able to
[1:53:02] overcome them and drive them out. And
[1:53:05] God said unto Balam, "Thou shalt not go
[1:53:10] with them. Thou shalt not curse the
[1:53:14] people for for they are blessed."
[1:53:21] What? These are the people that rejected
[1:53:25] God at Kadis Barnea, but they were still
[1:53:28] God's people. Oh, they are blessed.
[1:53:33] Leave them alone. Don't bother them.
[1:53:35] Just leave them alone. Leave them
[1:53:37] alone. Leave them
[1:53:40] alone. You know, we need to learn that
[1:53:42] lesson. We don't understand all
[1:53:44] ministries. We don't understand Reverend
[1:53:46] so and so, Pastor So and So, but that's
[1:53:48] not my business.
[1:53:51] My business is to leave them alone. They
[1:53:54] ain't got nothing to do with me. Leave
[1:53:56] them alone.
[1:53:59] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:02] They are
[1:54:04] blessed. And Bale rose up in the
[1:54:07] morning and said unto the princes of the
[1:54:09] bail, "Get you into your land, for the
[1:54:13] Lord refused to give me leave to go with
[1:54:16] you." And the princes of Moab rose up,
[1:54:20] went to Bailo, and said, "Balam refused
[1:54:22] to come with us." Bail sent yet again
[1:54:25] princes more and more honorable than
[1:54:30] they. They came to Balam and said to
[1:54:32] him, "Thus said Baleo the king, the son
[1:54:35] of
[1:54:37] Zapor. Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder
[1:54:39] thee from coming unto me, for I will
[1:54:41] promote thee unto very great honor, and
[1:54:44] I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto
[1:54:46] me. Come therefore, I pray thee, curse
[1:54:49] me this
[1:54:51] people. And Balam answered and said unto
[1:54:57] the servants of Bailo, if Bail would
[1:54:59] give me his house full of silver and
[1:55:02] gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the
[1:55:05] Lord, my God, to do less or more. Now
[1:55:09] therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also
[1:55:13] here this night, that I may know what
[1:55:16] the Lord will
[1:55:18] say unto me
[1:55:20] more. It looks
[1:55:22] innocent. It looks like he's just trying
[1:55:25] to check and cover his bases. But God
[1:55:28] didn't stutter when he talked to him the
[1:55:30] first time. And God wasn't playing
[1:55:32] around the first time. So what you
[1:55:35] think? God didn't mean what he said the
[1:55:38] first time. So now he's going to come
[1:55:41] back to the
[1:55:44] Lord again and ask him say,
[1:55:47] "Lord, should I go or should I
[1:55:51] stay?" Now, what's causing him to ask
[1:55:53] the Lord the second time? I'll tell you
[1:55:55] what's causing him. First of all, the
[1:55:57] prophet of God tells us in his heart, he
[1:56:00] didn't like the children of Israel
[1:56:02] anyways. Number one. Number two, that
[1:56:06] pay raise. I've been thinking about
[1:56:09] that because I had a vacation I was
[1:56:12] planning on going to anyways. And that
[1:56:14] promotion, that's exactly what my family
[1:56:20] needs. Y'all ain't going to let me
[1:56:22] preach this morning.
[1:56:24] Oh yes, that promotion is exactly what
[1:56:28] we wanted, what we needed. But you know
[1:56:30] what? No. No. I don't have my mind on
[1:56:32] it. I'm gonna go pray about it again.
[1:56:37] God already gave you the answer, my
[1:56:39] sister, my
[1:56:41] brother. What's there to pray about
[1:56:43] again?
[1:56:46] Huh? Your motive, your objective is now
[1:56:50] going to be highlighted. And the Lord's
[1:56:52] going to expose it right here in his
[1:56:54] word. Verse number 20.
[1:56:57] And God came unto Balam at night, and
[1:57:00] said unto him, If the men come to call
[1:57:03] thee, rise up, and go with him, but yet
[1:57:06] the word which I shall say unto thee,
[1:57:09] that shalt thou do. Oh, wow. The Lord
[1:57:11] said, I can go, Brother Ben, I can go.
[1:57:14] He said it. Did the Lord Yeah. The Lord
[1:57:17] told me I can go. I got the quote right
[1:57:19] here. He said, I can go. And the Bible,
[1:57:22] if you keep reading, it says the angel
[1:57:24] of the Lord was kindled against him.
[1:57:27] Let's read it. We're
[1:57:29] here. And Bale rose up in the morning,
[1:57:31] verse 21, saddled his ass, and went with
[1:57:34] the princes of Moab. And God's anger was
[1:57:37] kindled because he went. And the angel
[1:57:40] of the Lord stood in the way for
[1:57:43] adversary against him, adversary against
[1:57:45] him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and
[1:57:48] his two servants were with him. And the
[1:57:51] ass saw the angel of the Lord standing
[1:57:53] in the way, and his sword drawn in his
[1:57:56] hand, and the ass turned aside, out of
[1:58:00] the way, and went into the field. And
[1:58:02] Balam smoked the ass, and he turned her
[1:58:04] into a way. But the angel of the Lord
[1:58:06] stood in the path in the vineyards, the
[1:58:08] wall being on this side, and a wall on
[1:58:10] that side. And when the ass saw the
[1:58:12] angel of the Lord, she thrust herself
[1:58:15] unto the wall and crushed Balam's foot
[1:58:19] against the wall, and he smoked her
[1:58:21] again. It's the It's the ass's fault,
[1:58:24] right? It's the beast's fault. It's
[1:58:25] everybody else's fault.
[1:58:28] Maybe you're outside of the will of the
[1:58:29] Lord.
[1:58:31] Maybe that's why your ass is running
[1:58:34] into the
[1:58:37] wall. And you got to take that into
[1:58:39] context like how I said it. Okay, read
[1:58:42] the scripture. That's the word of the
[1:58:43] Bible. Now,
[1:58:46] that's the reason why things ain't going
[1:58:48] right for you. Maybe because maybe
[1:58:50] you're out outside of the will of the
[1:58:51] Lord. And this
[1:58:56] donkey
[1:58:58] better. This
[1:59:02] ass can see what the prophet can't see.
[1:59:07] He's
[1:59:09] blinded. He's already on his way. Don't
[1:59:12] even know God's mad at him. All he knows
[1:59:15] is God said he can go. He has
[1:59:17] permission, but it's the permissive will
[1:59:20] of God, not the perfect will of God. And
[1:59:23] the bride of Jesus Christ is not
[1:59:24] interested in the permissive will of God
[1:59:28] as it pertains to the revelation of his
[1:59:31] word. Amen. Now, we live under his
[1:59:33] permissive will for many things. our
[1:59:35] clothes, the way we eat, the way we
[1:59:37] raise our children. That's all
[1:59:38] permissive will that he permits. But we
[1:59:41] don't want the permissive will of God as
[1:59:43] it pertains to his word.
[1:59:49] Is that right, saints?
[1:59:51] And
[1:59:53] now the the beast can see the angel. And
[1:59:57] this this animal's like, "This man don't
[1:59:59] know where he going.
[2:00:02] He want me to go that way, but I ain't
[2:00:04] going that way, man. It's
[2:00:05] like, man, what's wrong with you? And he
[2:00:08] beat her on her. And she run that way.
[2:00:10] And he beat on her. And then finally she
[2:00:11] stopped. She's like, man, what's
[2:00:14] up? Why are you hitting on
[2:00:17] me? Can't you see the
[2:00:19] angel? And then finally, his blindness,
[2:00:22] he was caught. He realized that he was
[2:00:25] operating. And the prophet brings it
[2:00:26] out. The Lord did tell him to go, but it
[2:00:30] was his permissive will to go. Now, I
[2:00:33] have to stop here on this this little
[2:00:36] truth here
[2:00:37] because this, my brother and my sister,
[2:00:41] is where many of us will fall prey to
[2:00:46] bending a quote or bending a scripture
[2:00:49] for our own
[2:00:51] personal and as a pastor or a minister,
[2:00:54] you know, the discipline must be there.
[2:00:56] I can't bend the scripture for myself or
[2:00:59] for nobody else.
[2:01:02] And we're not interested in twisting the
[2:01:04] quote or bending the word of the Lord
[2:01:10] to make it
[2:01:11] fit
[2:01:13] 2024. Remember in 1966,
[2:01:18] 67,68, 1970, most of the pastors in the
[2:01:22] message all believed in all of the
[2:01:25] pictures.
[2:01:27] and all of the visions.
[2:01:31] I've asked them.
[2:01:33] Yes,
[2:01:36] but somehow someway because of time,
[2:01:39] because the, you know, it didn't happen
[2:01:41] the way we thought it's going to happen.
[2:01:43] So, that quote, let's don't read that
[2:01:46] one.
[2:01:47] I'm not interested in bending any
[2:01:49] scriptures, bending any quotes, twisting
[2:01:52] the truth, expanding it out so it can
[2:01:56] reach more people.
[2:02:00] Can I get a witness here, somebody? You
[2:02:02] know, God keeps his word. When it's all
[2:02:04] said and done, you got to leave from
[2:02:06] here. And when you leave from here, you
[2:02:08] don't want nothing against your record.
[2:02:11] You don't want to record something
[2:02:12] against your record where you played
[2:02:13] with God's word over a temporary high
[2:02:18] over a temporary fix over a temporary
[2:02:22] whatever advancement in your personal
[2:02:25] life. You got to stand before God. It's
[2:02:28] just a few more days. You'll be coming
[2:02:31] to one of our funerals.
[2:02:37] Keep living. You got to bury me one day.
[2:02:40] Huh? And all would I preach what it
[2:02:43] mean? What did it
[2:02:44] mean? I failed to preach that. I failed
[2:02:47] to preach that. Oh, God, help me to stay
[2:02:50] with the word. Just a few more days and
[2:02:55] we'll be out of here. Stay with God's
[2:02:58] word,
[2:03:01] not his permissive will. We want his
[2:03:04] perfect will
[2:03:06] because that's where the blessing of God
[2:03:09] is. That's where the Holy Ghost is.
[2:03:12] That's where the rapture is. Hallelujah.
[2:03:16] Hallelujah.
[2:03:23] How many folks are compromising today
[2:03:25] because of these few things? Can I go a
[2:03:27] little bit further?
[2:03:30] Yes. Just a few more moments. I want to
[2:03:31] get into what Balam tried to do.
[2:03:35] Balam now goes to curse God's people
[2:03:42] after God already said they were
[2:03:44] blessed. And what was he looking at? He
[2:03:47] was looking at brother so and so's
[2:03:49] attitude. He was looking at sister so
[2:03:51] and so. She's a gossiper. He's looking
[2:03:54] at this one that can't get his act
[2:03:55] together. And this one can't know how to
[2:03:58] raise his family. And this one's all
[2:04:00] messed up. this one's all messed up. And
[2:04:02] he has evidence. He has proof that these
[2:04:05] are
[2:04:07] sinners worthy to be cursed. But when
[2:04:10] God looked out over him, he didn't see
[2:04:13] none of it. All he saw was the blessing
[2:04:17] of the heritage of my son Abraham.
[2:04:21] These are Abraham's babies.
[2:04:24] These are the children of Abraham.
[2:04:28] They are righteous in my sight. I don't
[2:04:31] see any sin among them.
[2:04:36] Amen.
[2:04:38] So, let's go a little bit further. Five
[2:04:40] more minutes. All right.
[2:04:43] So, let's let's look at this for a
[2:04:45] minute. We're always looking at from
[2:04:48] when we sinned and then we've asked
[2:04:51] forgiveness from that sin and then God
[2:04:54] forgives us. And that seems to be our
[2:04:57] reference point. You know, 1992 I got
[2:05:01] baptized or 1993 I got saved or 2005 I
[2:05:05] received the Holy Ghost. Whatever it
[2:05:09] is, but before the
[2:05:12] sin, where was man?
[2:05:16] Now the seventh seal with the prophetic
[2:05:18] utterance shows us the original man. And
[2:05:23] this is the jubilee that I'm talking
[2:05:25] about. Your original inheritance that
[2:05:28] you lost is nothing here earthly. It was
[2:05:31] beyond. It was way before the foundation
[2:05:34] of the world. And brother Manam goes
[2:05:37] into this. Ain't no message like this
[2:05:38] message. I tell you that the message God
[2:05:42] hiding in simplicity. He says this here.
[2:05:45] Now when paragraph
[2:05:47] number sorry 4 95. Now, when man before
[2:05:52] he sinned, I'm closing, but don't you
[2:05:55] miss it. When man sinned, he separated
[2:05:57] himself from God and crossed a great
[2:06:00] chasm, put himself in death on this
[2:06:02] side. He left. There's no way back.
[2:06:06] Exactly. There's no way for him to get
[2:06:08] back. But then when he did, God accepted
[2:06:11] a substitute, which was a lamb or a goat
[2:06:14] or a sheep, something with blood, which
[2:06:16] Adam spoke of, Abel spoke of on the
[2:06:19] other side of the chasm.
[2:06:21] on that side. He's a son of God. He's an
[2:06:24] offspring from God. He is an inheritance
[2:06:28] of the
[2:06:30] earth. He can control nature. He can
[2:06:33] speak into existence. Why? He's a
[2:06:36] creator himself. He's an offspring of
[2:06:40] God.
[2:06:42] But when he crossed, he separated his
[2:06:44] sunship. He's a sinner by nature. He's
[2:06:47] under the hands and
[2:06:48] dominat. And God took a sacrifice, a
[2:06:51] chemical of the blood. But the blood of
[2:06:53] bulls and goats did not divorce sin. It
[2:06:55] only covers sin. If I got a red spot on
[2:06:58] my hand and cover it with white, the red
[2:07:00] spot is still there. See, it's still
[2:07:03] there. But God sent down from heaven a
[2:07:07] bleach for sin. It was the blood of his
[2:07:11] own son that when our confessed sin
[2:07:14] drops into God's bleach tried to find it
[2:07:18] again. The coloring of sin goes back
[2:07:22] through the mediators down through the
[2:07:25] time until it hits the accuser Satan and
[2:07:28] lays on him till the day of the
[2:07:30] judgment.
[2:07:31] What happens to the son? He becomes in
[2:07:35] perfect fellowship with the father
[2:07:37] again, standing on the other side of the
[2:07:41] chasm with no remembrance of sin against
[2:07:46] him.
[2:07:48] No more. There's no more stain of bleach
[2:07:51] can be seen anywhere. He is free.
[2:07:54] Hallelujah. Just as the Clorox or the
[2:07:58] ink can never be inked no more because
[2:08:00] it's broke up and sent back again. And
[2:08:03] when confessed sin is confessed and been
[2:08:06] dipped into a man or a woman that's been
[2:08:09] dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ,
[2:08:11] it kills all symptoms.
[2:08:18] And every molecule of sin goes back to
[2:08:21] the devil and laid on him to the day of
[2:08:24] the judgment where his eternal
[2:08:26] destination will be thrown into the lake
[2:08:28] of fire. And the chasm is
[2:08:32] bridged and never to come into
[2:08:34] remembrance no more. And man stands
[2:08:38] justified as a son of
[2:08:41] God.
[2:08:43] Simplicity. Brother Bam continues on and
[2:08:47] he says this
[2:08:49] here paragraph 48 4:16. He's talking
[2:08:53] about how Moses entered that spot under
[2:08:57] the blood of bulls and goats and he was
[2:08:59] able to say
[2:09:00] frogs,
[2:09:02] fleas, lies. He was able to speak into
[2:09:06] creation under the blood of bulls and
[2:09:08] goats. And he continues on verse 14,
[2:09:11] "Let there be frogs." And there wasn't a
[2:09:13] frog in the country. In an hour's time,
[2:09:16] they were 10 foot deep in places. What
[2:09:19] was it? It was God the creator hiding
[2:09:22] himself in the simple man. Now I want to
[2:09:25] ask you something. If the blood of the
[2:09:28] bull of a goat be used for bleach which
[2:09:31] can only cover could put a man in
[2:09:33] position to speak the creative word of
[2:09:35] God and bring flies into existence. Why
[2:09:38] would you stumble at the bleach of Jesus
[2:09:41] Christ blood who can speak a squirrel or
[2:09:46] something into existence?
[2:09:49] Don't you do it. Don't stumble over
[2:09:52] simplicity.
[2:09:54] Oh my.
[2:09:58] We don't stumble over it, do we?
[2:10:01] We embrace it. They say, "Oh, stay away
[2:10:04] from that." I want to know what you
[2:10:05] staying away from. Pull it out. Let me
[2:10:08] see it. If it's a quote, I want to say
[2:10:10] amen to it. Let me get my hands on it.
[2:10:15] Let me highlight it. Brother Bobby,
[2:10:18] highlight it with the yellow pen. Then
[2:10:21] grab my pink one and highlight it. Then
[2:10:24] grab a blue one and highlight and say,
[2:10:25] "Amen." Oh, every time I'm highlighting,
[2:10:29] there's none of this stumbles us. Huh?
[2:10:31] We enjoy. We embrace it.
[2:10:35] Why? I'm not talking about when I was a
[2:10:37] sinner and I was out in the hood doing
[2:10:39] the things I shouldn't have been doing.
[2:10:40] I'm talking about before the hood ever
[2:10:42] existed. Where was I? Who were you
[2:10:47] before the sin? We were sons and
[2:10:50] daughters of
[2:10:52] God of the most high God.
[2:10:57] And when he justifies us, he pulls us
[2:11:00] past forgiveness over into justification
[2:11:06] where we never even did it.
[2:11:09] Nowhere in the memories of God.
[2:11:12] How many love the Lord today?
[2:11:17] Amen.
[2:11:19] We love the Lord. Let me close here.
[2:11:22] I'll read one more
[2:11:25] portion of quotes. All right.
[2:11:34] Let me read this last little part here.
[2:11:35] Okay. You need some water? We'll bring
[2:11:39] it to you. Sit right there just real
[2:11:42] quick. All right. All right. Hear what
[2:11:44] the prophet said in the
[2:11:49] message
[2:11:51] justified. You never done it in the
[2:11:53] first place in the invisible union of
[2:11:55] the bride of
[2:11:58] Christ. Paragraph
[2:12:02] 225. Just a little bit about now you're
[2:12:04] not only
[2:12:06] forgiven. Now verse two 224. Now your
[2:12:09] name is now in the new book. Not the
[2:12:12] book of life, but the lamb's book of
[2:12:14] life, but the Lamborghini. Not the old
[2:12:16] book of your nature union, natural
[2:12:18] union, but your new bride. Hallelujah.
[2:12:23] Your new life is in the lamb's book of
[2:12:27] life, your marriage certificate.
[2:12:30] Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ
[2:12:33] from the beginning takes hold.
[2:12:37] Now you're not only forgiven, but you're
[2:12:41] justified. Glory. Justified. Romans 5:1
[2:12:45] says said, "Therefore, being justified
[2:12:47] by faith, look up the word." So I did.
[2:12:52] Amen. Amen. He said, "Look up the word."
[2:12:54] The word don't mean forgiven. The word
[2:12:57] means justified. It don't mean you're
[2:13:00] forgiven.
[2:13:01] For instance, you heard I got drunk and
[2:13:03] done some evil things and everything.
[2:13:04] Then you come around and say to me, "You
[2:13:06] found out I didn't do them." Then you
[2:13:09] come around and say, "Brother Brandom, I
[2:13:10] forgive you. Forgive me. I didn't do it
[2:13:12] at the first place." See, now if you did
[2:13:16] do it, I'm guilty. But you could forgive
[2:13:19] me. I wouldn't be guilty. But yet, I'm
[2:13:23] not justified because I actually done
[2:13:25] it. But the word justified is though you
[2:13:29] never done it. Amen. It's not even
[2:13:32] regarded at all.
[2:13:35] How is it done in God's book of the sea
[2:13:38] of forgetfulness? Your old book of
[2:13:40] marriages,
[2:13:42] divorce and dead. It's not even in the
[2:13:45] memories of God. Amen. You're justified.
[2:13:48] Therefore, being justified, it was
[2:13:50] accused. You was accused. You never done
[2:13:54] it in the first place.
[2:13:58] Oh my. That was that's heavy to
[2:14:01] embrace, but it is the word of the
[2:14:05] Lord. And Satan with my carnal mind
[2:14:08] doesn't want me to embrace this. But
[2:14:10] this is what the word says. Justified as
[2:14:14] though you never done it in the first
[2:14:15] place. You didn't do it. Not guilty. You
[2:14:18] didn't do it. Never even happened.
[2:14:24] Can I receive that today?
[2:14:26] Lord, help us to receive it. The word
[2:14:31] justified as though you never done it.
[2:14:33] You are standing completely justified as
[2:14:37] though you never did it at the
[2:14:40] beginning. This is my message to the
[2:14:44] church.
[2:14:46] Now, how many like that?
[2:14:49] How many like that message?
[2:14:52] Oh, the message don't make you sad. The
[2:14:55] message makes you glad.
[2:14:58] This is my message to the church.
[2:15:04] You never done it in the first place.
[2:15:07] But look what brother so look what
[2:15:08] brother so and so. He's supposed to be a
[2:15:10] preacher. He's supposed to be an elder.
[2:15:12] He's supposed to be a deacon. Look what
[2:15:13] he did. Look what he did. God look and
[2:15:14] say, "I don't see nothing.
[2:15:19] I ain't see nothing. All I see is the
[2:15:22] blood. Amen. Blood of my son. Therefore,
[2:15:26] being justified by faith, we have peace
[2:15:30] with God. His our iniquities and our
[2:15:34] sins, we he remembers no
[2:15:38] more. Now, if he doesn't remember them,
[2:15:43] what do you think you should be doing if
[2:15:45] the mind of Christ is in you?
[2:15:49] The mind of Christ is he doesn't
[2:15:52] remember your
[2:15:54] sins once they've been placed. Now
[2:15:57] remember, you got to go through the
[2:15:58] process of forgiveness. You can't just
[2:16:02] skip to justified. There is a
[2:16:05] forgiveness process that's through
[2:16:07] Calvary. Amen.
[2:16:10] Amen. I have the quotes on that. When
[2:16:12] you're when you've done wrong and you've
[2:16:14] done sin and you haven't and you know
[2:16:17] you've done wrong and you won't make it
[2:16:18] right. Brother Brandham calls that
[2:16:21] iniquity. There sins and iniquity. He
[2:16:23] holds that iniquity against you because
[2:16:25] you haven't repented. And God's not
[2:16:27] going to repent for you. You have to
[2:16:29] repent for yourself. You have to come to
[2:16:32] within yourself. Lord, forgive me for
[2:16:35] this sin. Then he forgives you for your
[2:16:38] sins. And if your name's written on the
[2:16:40] lamb's book of life, it goes further
[2:16:44] than just forgiven. It goes to
[2:16:48] justification that you never done it in
[2:16:50] the first place because he has no crimes
[2:16:52] against you held against you.
[2:16:58] Wow. I wonder what that thing what that
[2:17:00] thought is like to really think I never
[2:17:05] even done it in the first place.
[2:17:09] But that's our original inheritance and
[2:17:11] that's the direction that we're going.
[2:17:13] Lord, please help us. Help us, Lord.
[2:17:17] Amen. To embrace that, to receive that,
[2:17:22] that the Lord Jesus doesn't see our sins
[2:17:25] once they've been placed in the precious
[2:17:28] blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:17:32] Once we have confessed those sins, he
[2:17:35] doesn't hold us hold it against us
[2:17:38] anymore. Said he will write the laws in
[2:17:42] their hearts and in their minds and
[2:17:44] their
[2:17:46] iniquities I will remember no more. How
[2:17:49] many's grateful for that?
[2:17:53] Thankful for
[2:17:55] that. That's not just a salvation
[2:17:58] message now. That's being made
[2:18:00] justified. God bless you if the
[2:18:03] musicians would come. That's being made
[2:18:07] just. Being made
[2:18:10] righteous. He makes you
[2:18:13] [Music]
[2:18:14] righteous. My Lord, please help me to
[2:18:19] embrace my
[2:18:21] inheritance that belongs to me today. I
[2:18:24] bless you. Let us pray.
[2:18:28] I should play something softly
[2:18:33] there tonight. Brother Perry, Benny
[2:18:36] Perry, I believe, will be with us from
[2:18:37] South Carolina. He's in the city there
[2:18:41] of Phoenix and he he'll come by our our
[2:18:43] way, the Lord
[2:18:45] willing. Pastor Benny Perry, let us
[2:18:48] pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings
[2:18:51] on the word of God today. Lord, that
[2:18:55] this truth would settle into our heart
[2:18:58] and in our mind. That you wrote, you
[2:19:01] write your laws in our minds and in our
[2:19:04] hearts. A new covenant, a better way,
[2:19:08] better
[2:19:09] promises, true hearts. Oh God, that's
[2:19:12] our desire today.
[2:19:16] May you bless your people that's
[2:19:19] gathered here today and the other places
[2:19:21] they're gathered gathered,
[2:19:24] Lord. And may they receive this truth of
[2:19:27] the word that's been revealed or open to
[2:19:29] us because of the seventh
[2:19:32] seal. And the enemy is trying to lower
[2:19:36] our
[2:19:37] standards. But there is no word like the
[2:19:41] seven seal word that's been open to us.
[2:19:45] It doesn't exist anywhere else except
[2:19:49] for Revelations
[2:19:51] 10:7. We know the voice has the release
[2:19:57] for justification for the true
[2:20:00] bride. It washes us by your word, Lord.
[2:20:04] And may we climb up higher into those
[2:20:06] realms
[2:20:07] today. Rise up in our faith, Lord.
[2:20:11] moving from just what Balam had to
[2:20:15] really going into the perfect will of
[2:20:17] God. Oh Lord, we don't want to just be
[2:20:20] anointed and
[2:20:21] blessed. As many of the children of
[2:20:24] Israel, they were blessed, but they were
[2:20:26] lost. Many of them. But there was a
[2:20:29] Joshua and Caleb, there were some young
[2:20:31] people under the age of 20 that you had
[2:20:35] your covenant with them. Oh God, we are
[2:20:39] those people today. Lord, we are part of
[2:20:42] the covenant people that believe and
[2:20:44] receive every
[2:20:46] word. Lord, we just commit each one into
[2:20:49] your hands. Lord, we labor with all of
[2:20:52] our heart. Some things are said that
[2:20:55] causes us harsh or hurt feelings, things
[2:20:59] in our life, things that are sent to our
[2:21:02] way, Lord, and it burdens us. It bothers
[2:21:06] us.
[2:21:07] We're only human beings and we
[2:21:10] hurt. And but Lord, a message like this
[2:21:14] raises us up out of any kind of hurt or
[2:21:19] depression, any kind of
[2:21:21] oppression, any kind of past shackle
[2:21:24] that the devil had against us. Lord,
[2:21:27] this seven seal opening to me, to your
[2:21:32] people, makes this Bible a new book to
[2:21:35] us.
[2:21:37] Romans
[2:21:38] 5:1 is new to me. It's new to us. May
[2:21:42] you grant it, Lord Jesus. Bless every
[2:21:45] heart. We pray in Jesus name.
[2:21:50] Amen.
[2:21:53] Amen. Magnify your
[2:22:00] name. Heart is filled with praise.
[2:22:06] Love you, Lord. Said I love
[2:22:19] you. He care for
[2:22:23] me special
[2:22:25] way. And I praise
[2:22:28] you. I lift you
[2:22:31] up. Magnify your name.
[2:22:36] name. That's why my heart is filled with
[2:22:41] your praise. My heart and my mind and my
[2:22:46] heart, my
[2:22:49] mind and my soul belongs to you.
[2:22:56] paid the price for
[2:22:59] me that day
[2:23:02] on
[2:23:03] Calvary. And I praise you and I lift you
[2:23:12] up.
[2:23:15] Oh, why my heart is filled with praise.
[2:23:20] My heart and my mind with all your
[2:23:22] heart. Won't you sing it? And my heart
[2:23:26] and my
[2:23:28] mind, my soul belongs to
[2:23:33] you, Lord. You paid the
[2:23:36] price. Yes, you did.
[2:23:42] Oh, and I praise you, Lord. I lift you
[2:23:47] up.
[2:23:52] magnify your
[2:23:54] name. That's why my heart is filled with
[2:23:59] praise. That's why my
[2:24:02] heart. Oh, that's why my heart is
[2:24:07] filled. My heart is filled with your
[2:24:13] praise. That's why my heart is filled
[2:24:18] with praise.
[2:24:21] Amen. Don't you love the Lord
[2:24:24] today? Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[2:24:26] of praise. Yes. Everybody
[2:24:30] ought to know who Jesus
[2:24:32] is. He's the lily of the
[2:24:35] valley. Everybody ought to
[2:24:40] know. Everybody ought to

[2:25:15] Oh,
[2:25:17] he's the lily of the
[2:25:23] valley. Oh,
[2:25:26] he's the bright and morning star.
[2:25:33] I'm so glad that
[2:25:36] he's the barest of
[2:25:42] 10,000. And everybody
[2:25:44] [Music]

[2:26:08] is. Hallelujah. Everybody ought to know.
[2:26:13] How you ought to
[2:26:18] know. Oh, everybody ought to
[2:26:23] know who
[2:26:25] Jesus is.
[2:26:30] Oh,

[2:26:34] [Music]
[2:26:41] of the bright and star.
[2:26:47] [Music]
[2:27:02] We have another verse up
[2:27:07] there. He's the healer of How many's
[2:27:12] ever been healed by the power of God of
[2:27:15] my body?
[2:27:18] He's the savior of my soul.
[2:27:25] So glad
[2:27:27] he's the Holy Ghost

[2:30:37] Yeah. Everybody
[2:30:40] ought to know. Amen. Let's give God some
[2:30:44] praise. Put those hands together and
[2:30:46] praise the Lord. Put those hands and
[2:30:48] give the Lord a clap offering. Just
[2:30:50] clap, clap, clap. Lord, you're worthy. A
[2:30:54] clap offering to you, Lord Jesus. Oh my.

[2:31:16] because of this word that's come down in
[2:31:20] this day. God richly bless each of you.
[2:31:23] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. We'll go
[2:31:26] down go to the Lord in
[2:31:29] prayer. We'll ask our brother Joel
[2:31:33] Jensen to come and dismiss us in a word
[2:31:35] of prayer.
[2:31:39] Amen. Yes.
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:52] Let's bow our
[2:31:54] heads.
[2:31:57] Father, for some of it, some of us,
[2:32:00] Lord, has been a short
[2:32:02] journey.
[2:32:04] Others 40, 50 years or more.
[2:32:09] Lord
[2:32:24] [Laughter]
[2:32:28] [Music]
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:52] Oh Jesus.
[2:32:59] Holy, holy,
[2:33:03] holy is the Lord God Almighty.
[2:33:10] [Music]
[2:33:28] [Music]
[2:33:36] of our
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:41] Lord. Father, sometimes there's not
[2:33:44] words to express it.
[2:33:49] We're grateful, Lord, that of all the
[2:33:52] billions of people on planet
[2:33:55] Earth, you put a special divine call in
[2:34:00] our lives.
[2:34:15] [Music]
[2:34:18] And Lord, you said I'll never lose a one
[2:34:21] of
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:25] them. And Father, we thank
[2:34:28] you for reminding us this
[2:34:34] morning the food you gave
[2:34:39] us justified.
[2:34:44] justified. We cease from our
[2:34:47] labors. There's a rest in
[2:34:50] Christ. There's no more struggle.
[2:35:04] Oh
[2:35:05] God, as your servant, Lord, I pray for
[2:35:09] Shalom
[2:35:10] Tabernacle that you will
[2:35:13] take take us in deeper depths and higher
[2:35:18] heights. That Lord, you will take us
[2:35:20] into a place before
[2:35:23] you. That
[2:35:25] Lord, we can truly
[2:35:29] say when you go to that
[2:35:32] place, the book of Acts is being
[2:35:35] manifested. The glory of God is resting
[2:35:38] on the people because they've learned to
[2:35:41] humble
[2:35:44] themselves. They've learned to get small
[2:35:46] so Lord, you can
[2:35:48] big. And we want Mama Eagle to wave her
[2:35:52] wings over the nest.
[2:35:55] Oh
[2:36:00] [Music]
[2:36:11] Jesus. Oh dear
[2:36:14] God, we thank you for your sweet
[2:36:17] presence,
[2:36:18] Lord. What would we do without it?
[2:36:25] We're going to leave for a little while
[2:36:27] and let Lord come back for communion
[2:36:30] foot
[2:36:33] washing. And Lord, as we do that, we
[2:36:35] just pray
[2:36:37] that the spirit of Melzdc will come
[2:36:40] while we do foot wash and
[2:36:43] communion. And Lord, there'll be a
[2:36:46] supernatural happening. But that's why
[2:36:48] we come here, Lord. We don't want to
[2:36:50] come just on an intellectual basis or
[2:36:53] come be see what we're dressed at, but
[2:36:56] we want to be with
[2:36:58] you. We want you to we
[2:37:02] welcome. And Lord, you know, you are not
