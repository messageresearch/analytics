[Music] alone amen oh it's been a good day in the house of the Lord I certainly appreciated that message we heard this morning how many have you appreciated that amen amen thank you so much musicians I appreciate those song specials and and uh my how wonderful it is of beautiful atmosphere in the house of the Lord this evening so you know the believer the believer loves this right here amen it's not something we we have to do it's something we get to do and so we're so grateful to be Believers tonight amen while we're all standing let's turn our Bibles to Ephesians the thir chapter and uh read our portion of scripture for this evening so good to be here with you tonight Ephesians the thir chapter we'll start reading at the seventh verse and this is of course Paul speaking and he says whereof I was made a minister he's talking about to the Gentile church or to the Gentiles whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ I'm so glad he preached to the Gentiles aren't you and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from before the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Christ by Jesus Christ now that's maybe sounds a little tricky let me read the uh the English Standard Version it says and to bring to light for everyone which is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things 10th verse to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God let me read English Standard on that also it says so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in Heavenly places 11th verse according to the Eternal purpose God has an eternal purpose tonight Saints which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by faith in him can you say Amen to the word tonight let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful tonight to be assembled together with our brothers and sisters just once more Lord we never know what might be our last time to come together Lord we're expecting your soon appearing and Lord if this was our last time oh God may we leave it all on the table tonight Lord may we give all that we have father and and may we praise you with all of our might may we worship you with all that's within us Lord we don't want to halfway do anything Lord we want to be holy and completely yours surrendered vessels Lord and as our Pastor said this morning to increase in power oh God by the by by Lord the Way Up Is Down Lord and I just pray tonight Lord that you would oh God speak to us out of your word and I pray Lord that you'd watch over me and bind my lips before I'd say anything unpleasing to you and will commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you may be seated and uh uh the title of the message tonight is what's the purpose in all of this now can we get a little bit more monder up here now Paul tells us in the scripture here that it was in the plan of God to bring light by Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles so that the Gentiles might understand the mystery plan of God that had been hidden for ages by God himself so these Mysteries that we uh are looking at or looking for were hidden by God himself and can only be revealed to us by God himself and he said that the Church might know the multifaceted the manifold the multiple wisdom of our Lord Jesus Christ by Revelation so that we might know the Eternal purpose of God by our Lord Jesus Christ so God has an eternal purpose and it was and Paul was saying here that God wants to reveal to his church that Eternal purpose that they might know so God is looking for a people today that understand where they're standing at saints that understand what we're here for why we're here what the purpose in all of this is he wants a people that understand his purpose tonight amen and so if it's something that God wants us to have then it's our right to attain that sort of thing so we each should have a purpose in our life now the word purpose means the reason for which something is done or created or which something exists it means the motive the motivation the cause uh to describe or intend for something of a particular use to have something as one's intention or objective so so our our purpose Should Be Our intention our objective our prescribed use what we're here to do Saints amen so we all should have a purpose we all do have a purpose that God put us here not to just do what we want to do but he put us here to accomplish an intended purpose there's a goal in us being here there's a reason in us being here do y'all believe that tonight God don't do anything just by because but he put you here for a reason and he called you here for a reason and you're in the message today for a reason and there's a reason we're all here tonight and there's a reason we heard the message we heard tonight and whatever take you here tomorrow there's a reason for it because all things work together for good of those that love the Lord and are called according to his purpose so it gives this purpose is what gives our life meaning Saints the purpose is what makes everything worthwhile the purpose is is is why we're here it's what we were put here for and if you want to see somebody that's miserable you can look for somebody that has no purpose in their life and it's a miserable existence it's a miserable way of living brother Ezekiel not to have a purpose and there's no fulfillment in it if you don't have any purpose because there's no meaning to it if there's no purpose see when I was a sinner I had no kind of a purpose outside of my own desires amen and if you're chasing after your own desires you know that there's no real meaning to that so it leads to misery when you're living for yourself it's a miserable life if you turn to many times people turn to alcohol and drugs and things because they're never satisfied if you don't have a purpose and you don't have a goal there's no satisfaction in your life so they try to they try to hush that calling in their life with alcohol or drugs or or any kind of evil or some kind of uh uh whatever kind of sin it is and I'll tell you when I was young that party scene it might look good to me but but I I'd wake up the next day and I realized that there was no value in my life but when God brought me into this message say hallelujah for the first time my life had meaning and my life had value and I was standing for something there was a purpose in me being here is that your is that your testimony tonight Saints and each of Our Lives should have a purpose and this Li this purpose that we're talking about it comes from what what brother Brandon referred to as attributes now attribute that word means a quality or feature regarded as a characteristic or intent part of someone or something it's it's a part of you that's there for a reason for example if if you had the attributes of say an athlete let's say you let's say you got some wheels on you brother Israel and you can run fast and you had that attribute about you then you might purpose to be some kind of a a football player or a basketball player or a baseball player if you got a rocket for an arm maybe a purpose to be a quarterback or a pitcher or something or or or if you got the attributes of a race card driver and you got good reflexes and and and you can drive around Tucson traffic at 8:00 in the morning you might purpose in your life that you want to be a race car driver and and so that that that would you know maybe you start try to get in NASCAR or something like that but but that's the attributes that are inside us and it leads us to our purpose if you had attributes as a musician you might you might purpose to play in the orchestra or something or or maybe you want to play in church whatever those attributes are if you got attributes of liking to eat everything you might purpose to be brother George tonight huh and when you have a purpose Saints the desire is already there when you have a purpose the desire is already there so your attri rutes lead to your purpose and your purpose gives you a desire see if you got a purpose you don't you don't have to be concerned about motivation see motivation goes like this all right motivation goes up and down but when you got a purpose it goes past motivation into conviction and then you don't have to be talked into it you don't have to talk yourself into it you got a desire to do it oh come on somebody tonight amen if you got a purpose of being a professional athlete you don't have to be talked into training you're going to train whether anybody's looking or not you're going to train whether anybody's watching you or not if you got a purpose to be a millionaire ain't nobody gonna have to make you get up in the morning and go to work each day because you got a purpose of being a millionaire you got a desire in you to do the things that you got to do to accomplish your purpose and and if you're a purposed to be a great musician or a great singer Ain't nobody got to talk you in to practicing you desire to practice because you want to be great see purpose gives us an inward Compass an inward compass that get guides us and leads us and pushes us where we should go and and we find so many times that people are going through life without that internal Compass there's nothing guiding them they're just floating about God don't want you just to float about amen God don't want you to float around from Pillar To Post he wants you to settle in and dig your feet in and go forward amen now sometimes we got to seek a while to find our purpose sometimes we got to push hard to to understand what our purpose is it don't always appear to us and you might be sitting here today and say brother George I'm not sure what my purpose is but if you're looking for it God will lead you towards your purpose if you're seeking your purpose God will show you that way so I ain't got it all figured out nobody does Amen but we know there is a purpose in us being here and we got to trust that God's leading us to identify to us the purpose that he has for us all right so if you have tonight the attributes of a believer then you're going to purpose to be a real Christian and if you got the attributes of a Believer and your purpose is to be a real Christian the desire to be a Christian will automatically be there amen and and you won't have to be talked into coming to church you'll come to church because it's Church time amen you might be tired and you might feel like staying at home but you're desire is to be in the house of the Lord your desire is to serve the Lord your desire is to Worship the Lord and ain't nobody to talk you into praising God your desire is to praise God and everybody got to talk you into worshiping God because your desire is to worship God and everybody got to talk you into hearing the message because your desire is to hear the message and nobody got to talk you into reading your Bible because your desire is to read your Bible because your purpose is to be a real Christian and you got the attributes of a Believer yes ain't nobody got to talk into worshiping nobody got to talk you to praise amen Ain't nobody got to beg you to come to church amen if church was closed you'd find another church to go too because you got a desire to be a believer you got a desire to be a Christian right tonight Saints amen and your desire will be there because of your purpose and it won't matter how many websites the devil can come up with it won't matter how many believe the signs is out there it won't matter what any kind of infidel says it won't matter what kind of junk Satan throws out there you'll believe because your purpose is to be a believer and you'll have an anchor that'll hold told you no matter what the internet says no matter what the unbeliever or the make believer says no matter what the nominal says you'll have an anchor and you know I tell you these things that's cropping up in our day and all this that's coming against the message in our day it didn't happen until these old Fighters started dying off I'm gonna tell you right now Saints you you probably you w going to tell you wasn't going to tell brother Muse that sunset Mountain didn't happen CU he was a witness amen you wern't going to tell brother Billy Paul that them Miracles didn't happen because he was a witness and so as these old Fighters die off then we find that other stuff is raising up but Saints it's time for a people that have not seen yet still believe and I might not be a witness but I'm a witness of a witness yes y'all love the Lord tonight and I'll tell you what I Paul said I'm Marvel that you're so soon removed from the gospel that I preached to you it shocked Paul by the early church age that they'd already started to leave away from the gospel that he preached I Marvel that you moved away from it so soon and Saints I didn't come I wasn't called to preach some kind of prop Prosperity Gospel brother will I wasn't called to make everybody think they're saved and everything's going to be great and God's going to give you a million dollars I was called to preach the message and the message is rugged and the message is true and the message is right and the message is straight and the message Cuts but that's what God called us to Saints you don't want what the Prosperity Gospel makes you want what the word makes I can't get messy enough come on somebody and these attributes that are in you were given to you by all my Mighty God when did he give them to you it wasn't when you staggered in here it wasn't when you first gave your heart to the Lord he gave them to you before the foundation of the world brother Ben they've been in you since before the foundation of the world Amen because you were in him before the foundation of the world and before the foundation of the world God saw you and he called you and he said this is my son this is my daughter and this is how they'll be and they'll be sitting here in 2024 at Shalom Tabernacle praising me because I called him to it ohy God man let the devil do what he wants to he cannot stop that predestination it's already done it's already decided amen and they're laying inside of you they're laying inside of me these seed attributes that are laying inside of us and when you give your heart to the Lord these attributes help you identify your purpose when when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it pours water onto those seed attributes and they bring forth life isn't that beautiful Saints but they were laying there all the time but all of a sudden the light brings forth life the water brings forth life amen and so these are things in you that you might not even have known about you didn't know about it you didn't know you called to preach and then all of a sudden God got a hold of your heart and then all of a sudden from the inside that attribute came forth you didn't know you had a gift to sing you didn't know you had a gift of wisdom you didn't know you had a gift of knowledge you didn't know that you could play an instrument but then God brings to light those attributes now sometimes you can have an attribute that God gave you for his purpose and you can use it for the wrong purpose God can give a man a gift of leadership to used for God's purpose and that man can take that gift of leadership and use it for his own kingdom God can give somebody a gift of music for his purpose to praise him with and they can and but but they can use it for their self and they end up some kind of pop star or something is that what happened with Elvis Presley so you find saints that God gives us these attributes and it's they G they are given to us for him now brother Brown says this he says you have to will to do God's will let me read it for you Revelations chapter 4 he says God placed the first man Adam and Eve right here on free moral agency and he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this fixed in here is your own self-will Hallelujah your self-will you have to will to do God's will you have to get rid of your own will to let God's will come in for it's the only channel that leads to the hearts your self-will is the only channel that leads to the hearts and you got to get your will out of there so that God's will can come in so that God can control your hearts so God places these attributes in us to help us find our purpose which is actually his purpose our purpose then becomes his purpose ain't that what you want tonight Saints my purpose to become his purpose my my want too to become his wants amen and he gives you a will to do God's Will and the only way that we can find real joy and fulfillment in this life is to live for God's purpose there's no other way amen you see people trying to keep their self busy with the things of the world so that they don't have to face that one simple fact that our will has to be his will that our purpose has to be his purpose amen now I tell you what I've tried both ways I was raised a sinner and I was a sinner and lived a sinner's life and I tried living for myself and I was miserable and I almost ruined my life I've tried doing what I wanted and it was a disaster I made a I made a huge mistake I made huge messes out of my life can you say Amen tonight Saints anybody there I when I tried to live for myself but but when I gave my heart to the Lord my self-will gave my heart to the Lord and God gave me a purpose my life is now full of meaning and love and the virtues of God and I have a reason for being here tonight Saints I'm not here for nothing I'm here for something God's got a purpose in it all so we understand that we have a purpose but what about God now what is God's purpose did not Paul tell us in our opening scripture that there would be a people that would understand God's purpose and they would be Gentiles and that they would be they would understand the manifold wisdom of God is that what Paul said amen and he said that and he says and I'll tell you Saints I'm so thankful tonight that God sent us a prophet to tell us the purpose of God see all these people trying to run around and make people disbelieve the message does not the Bible tell us that there is coming one to turn the heart of the children to the fathers does not the Bible tell us that there was one to come that would finish the mysteries of God does the Bible tell us that when we see the sodomite condition in the world that there would come upon the Earth the son of man to be revealed now how in the world and let me ask you this like what brother Israel said last week if it wasn't brother brandom who is it didn't nobody else do it nobody else knew these things nobody else is preaching this Revelation tonight nobody else is looking and reading the Bible as an open book tonight nobody else can do it because it takes a prophet to open unto us the Revelation thereof and Paul said it was coming Paul said there'd be a people that know Paul said there'd be a people that would understand the manifold wisdom of God and now you're a witness of it today Hallelujah and I'm not looking for anybody else I found what I'm looking for I know where I'm standing tonight I know on whom I have believed and God revealed through this prophet's Ministry his threefold purpose to the church just like Paul said he would yes Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Brown says the first thing was that God wanted to Reve reveal himself to the people and he couldn't do it as the great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious how that that great being that never did begin and that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of light space and on into the infinite into eternity and a great creature uh that was all and still is let me stop right here and just say this I Saints you got to have a lot of faith to think that two Adams was coming together and boom made all this if that's the case why ain't they still doing it today why ain't why ain't stuff why ain't there another Universe another world why ain't it all still happening if it if it did it once why ain't it still doing it because that ain't the way it happen Saints I ain't got enough Faith to believe that something could just pop up like this right here and he said the only way he said 143 he says but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it to be was was to become a son of man and that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it now you get it why because it was given to you to know the manifold wisdom of God just like what our opening scripture said see he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great 3old purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings oh God to reveal himself in Christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that his bride that he might live in his people his first purpose was to express himself to you his second purpose was to live inside of you glory amen now he could not do that in Adam and Eve now he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh my oh when I this is Rich to me just to even think of it see what is what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that so why why did the fall happen because man was placed here on free moral agency why why is he own free moral agency so that God's attributes could be expressed in his purpose all right then he says then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know he was he said cause I had the experience see he is a savior and he had to express that and how could he do it only through Christ and he says how could he be a son only through Christ how could could he be a Healer only through Christ see all these things are wound up in that one person Jesus Christ Oh my he said when when I when I he says oh if God can't get them get impr prisoners like that he says now that's when he can express his knows nothing but Christ and he says you get what I mean all right that's secondly first is to express himself completely God in Christ second is to have the premen is by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them all right and [Applause] thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position he said that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowshipped with them so there we have the threefold purpose of God we got it revealed to us in our day just like Paul said it was coming and that we can understand what what all this is about what's all this for what's any of this mean that's what it means right there so once we understand that this is God's purpose then everything starts to fall into place so why did he put us on free moral agency well because it had to be our choice to serve him it had to be man man it's like in your home if you try to rule your home by do it because I said that's not going to be a very happy home but if you try to lead your home by example and have and your people and your children and and your family they do what you what you request of them to do because of love and and respect then that's the way to do it and God couldn't Force us to serve him he's a just God we had to do it because of our love for him so why did he come in the form of his son Jesus to redeem us well because he wanted to reveal himself to the people he had to be a kinsman redeemer he had to go through what you and I go through that's the god that we serve tonight a God that's been tempted in every manner that you and I have been tempted he knows what it's like to to be you he knows what it's like to feel pain he knows what it's like to be lonely he knows what fear feels like he knows what depression feels like he knows what anxiety feels like he knows what he knows what sickness feels like because he became a man and he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities why did he send us the Holy Ghost because he wanted pre preeminence in the body he wanted preeminence in the body he wanted control of the body and he had to put something in you that he could control your heart with it's all according to God's three-fold purpose y'all believe this tonight why did he have this purpose because he had these attributes because a purpose is simply an attribute looking to be expressed marriage and divorce he says what is God God is a great Eternal at at the beginning way back before there was a beginning he wasn't even God did you know that God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him he lived alone and in him was attributes what is an attribute a thought see God's thoughts are different than mine and your thoughts yes see I got thoughts all the time now Sister Brandy might beg to differ with you she might say I don't ever think about nothing but I do I got thoughts I think about all kinds of stuff sometimes people think about too much stuff and they worry theirself to death over stuff they can't control and we got all kinds of thoughts in our mind but our thoughts sometimes they don't mean nothing our thoughts sometimes they just come and go sometimes it's a devil putting a thought in our mind or or we got some kind of weird thought or we got some kind of weird idea and it never it doesn't mean anything it's just thoughts and stuff in our head but that's not how God's thoughts are God's thoughts are attributes God's thoughts materialized God's thoughts are tangible God's thoughts are real tonight Saints God's thoughts have characteristics and tent and when God has a thought that thought never leaves it never stops it keeps on going it's always true and it's got to manifest and when he thought about you in this day you had to manifest you had to become a Believer because you were in the thoughts of God so God's thoughts they char characteristics their features now brother BR says notice right on down from that 153 he says notice he was his attributes that was in him and it was in him to be a father it was in him to be God it was in him to be son it was in him to be savior it was in him to be healer and all these things here are just displaying his attributes and he says there's nothing out of order you think God didn't see the end from the beginning see saints that already help you on a lot of sleepless nights right there you don't think God saw this problem coming you don't think God saw this trial that the church is going through you don't think God saw your financial needs you don't think God saw the sickness in your body you don't think God saw the trouble in your family he saw it before the foundation of the world and he predestinated its Saints and I don't know how he's going to do it but I know he promised that it's going to work together for our good amen we ought to be able to sleep like a baby amen we ought to go right to sleep and say hey God's got it all under control God's in control of my life he's in control of my family he's in control of my situation he's in control of my health you know what I can't leave this world until God's ready for me and when he is amen where was I at 55 he can't be a savior unless something is lost he can't be a Healer unless something is sick these things had to be that way God made them thus so that his great attributes could be displayed and if there wasn't that he'd have never been a savior but we know he was even before there was a time he was a savior he was a savior so there had to be something lost how's it going to be if he takes and loses it just in order to save it then he isn't just in his judgment he couldn't send a man to hell and be just he is kind gentle true honest and he is a great judge you must be born again let's read that he says then the great Holy Spirit went forth and spread forth his wings over the Earth and began to brooded for a purpose what's the meaning in all this to fulfill God's purpose and what and that was to bring forth something to project what God was see if we wasn't here nobody'd ever know what God was nobody ever know what God is you and I are the evidence that there is a God and I said the other night which was first The Sinner or the Savior that's what's that all about anyhow which was first a Healer or sickness why certainly a Healer C he says well why why did why did we ever become Sinners then it had to be that way it if God is a savior he had to have something to save so there's nothing wrong it's all just working his way now I I couldn't say this to Sinners I'm saying it to the minister see and the children of God you remember Paul said it would be revealed to the church the manifold wisdom of God he said I couldn't say this I'm saying it to the ministers and to the children of God it's all working all right no matter what we do or do not do it's going to come out right because God forne he ordained one more quote and then we'll move forward these quotes all right before there was a world this is questions and answers 59 before there was a world before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was a light before there was anything when it was still God God and His Thoughts The Eternal thoughts of God chose you by predestination and for knowledge to know listen to this to know that you would be on the earth to know there would be sin someone said then why did why was there sin it had if there had never been sin his attributes would have never been a savior there had to be a sinner so he could be a savior there had to be a sick man so he could be a Healer amen there you are it had to be that way it was God who saw it and foreordained it the devil ain't even in the race glory to God oh my amen the devil ain't even in the race he's just a stump on the side of the road that God used to bring children to him crying Abby father no wonder on that day how the angels will sing and when we're singing the Redemption Stories the angels are bow their head they don't know what we're talking about sure they never was lost they don't know what it is they don't know how good we feel to know which we which were once Sinners and alienated from God without hope without Mercy without God in one in a world of corruption dying going to a devil's hell and God stooped downall and picked us up and redeemed us and now we're above of the Angels glory to God Saints he can take a man in that condition and place him higher than the Angels oh can't nobody worship God like the redeemed that angel worships good but it ain't nothing like the redeemed God covets the worship of the redeemed so in him are attributes to be a God and not just like a Greek mythology God that's got that's got flaws this is a perfect God this is a god of love a god God of Justice a god of righteousness a perfect God his ways are just and right and lovely a God that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities that's the kind of God that was in him to be and that's what he's become for you and I tonight Psalms 5:4 said Thou Art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness neither shall evil dwell with thee it's only pure Holiness with our God he's attributes to be a father he's the author of Parenthood and and he's a perfect parent he's a perfect father an Earthly father can make mistakes but not our heavenly father I've made many mistakes with my children but my heavenly father's never made a mistake with me amen not this father an Earthly father can provide too much for a child or not enough and if you give a child too much you ruin him and if you don't give him enough you ruin him but our heavenly father gives us exactly what we need a Earthly father can he in judgment especially like if the kids are real cute and you know they need a weapon but you let your emotions get in there I mean not y'all I'm talking about me and maybe they missed the spanking they should have got that's an error in judgment let's just call it Grace but this father's judgment is perfect and Earth ly father can be emotional and it can skew their judgment you can you can react out of anger and it can skew your judgment you can you can react out of too much too much affection and it can skew your judgment to what's really going on you've seen people that they just they couldn't look at their kids and see what was going on they just had an air in judgment but not our Earthly father not our heavenly father he he his ways are righteous his judgment is righteous you know an Earthly father they can get fed up with you they can get tired of messing with you say Get on Up out of here go to your room I ain't got time to mess with you no more man sometimes you see in the world where people kick even boot their kids out they're done with them they don't want to mess with them no more I'm so glad that our heavenly father oh God doesn't kick us out when we do something wrong I'm so glad that I can make a mistake tonight Saints and still be a Christian I'm so glad that I can have faults and still be a believer I'm so glad that I can I can run to him and and offer my needs to him and I can mess up again and I can go back with the same need and I can keep going until I get it right I'm so glad I got a father like that he had attributes to be a son now an Earthly son can become rebellious you know an Earthly son can say uh I I don't want to do that I I don't want to follow in your footsteps but not this son he said not my will but thine be done an Earthly son can can decide he don't want no part of the father's business but the this son was always about the father's business amen I got got to move ahead savior he had not just a savior but he was a perfect sacrifice he's a Merciful Savior he's full of compassion he's full of grace he's full of Mercy he's also just but Saints there's Grace if we ask for it Saints and and he's full of love and understanding why does he understand because he was in all points tempted like we are he went through everything that you and I went through that you and I are going through he's been through it he knows what it feels like he's a Healer why because his purpose was to restore what was lost because his attribute is to be a Healer he wants to bring us back to what it was in the beginning brother Bram said back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowship with see our bodies wasn't sick before the fall uh our body our minds wouldn't have been polluted before the fall there was no depression or anxiety or lust or things of the world in us before the fall it was the fall that brought all these things about now notice you and I have a desire and we have things that we want to do according to our purpose is that right and if we purpose to be an athlete there will be a desire to train and if we purpose to be a Christian there'll be a desire to hear the word of God and if we purpose to be brother George we'll just eat stuff all the time but many times when you and I compare ourself with a holy God when we compare our lives with the life of Jesus Christ when we compare our life even with the life of brother brandom when we compare oursel and we look at all the things that we got going going on in our life and we look at all of our struggles and all the trials that we're going through and all the Temptations in our life and all the pull in our life and all the negative in our life and all the people trying to weigh us down in our life sometimes it's hard to compare ourself to a holy God maybe maybe we get to thinking that if we're sick maybe we feel like we don't really deserve healing because of how we've lived or the things that we've done or the mistakes that we made or the trials but the will that we got in all that maybe we feel like we don't really deserve it because of all the mistakes and things we made or maybe we feel like we're bothering the Lord with our little bitty things like he doesn't have time to mess with our little insignificant things in our lives or maybe we feel like we're just not good enough to come and be delivered of the things that's bothering us or hindering us maybe we may think that our mistakes and our failures mean that we can never come to the Lord with our needs and we try to pull back and hide oursel from the Lord like Adam and Eve in the garden we try to run and hide we try to cover ourself up but these things are only because of this Fallen State and it was God's purpose Saints to redeem us back to our rightful estate meaning that it's God's desire to deliver you it's God's desire to heal you remember if his purpose is to restore us back to what we was when we walked with God in the cool of the evening if that was his if that was his purpose then the desire is already there it's his desire to heal you it's his desire to forgive you it's his desire to save you it's his desire to give you the Holy Ghost it's his desire to help you through your struggles it's his desire to heal your marriage it's his desire to touch your body it's his desire to take care of your family it's his desire to lift you from that anxiety it's his desire to take that depression out of your life it's his desire to do it you don't have to talk him into it he already wants to do it because because that is his purpose you say but I struggle brother George he knows he knows he knows your struggle you sound tested he knows you're tested he was tested too you say I got a lot of problems he knows what your problems are you say I got a lot of bad thoughts he knows what those thoughts are you can't hide them from him he already knows and we don't have to hide them from him he already knows what we are and he also knows where we're going and it's his desire to take us to where he has planned for us to be he knows where we fail he knows our mistakes and his purpose is to restore us back to where we can walk with him in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the day that's where we're headed back to Saints and it's his desire to make us whole it's his desire for you to be an overcomer amen it's his desire we don't have to act like we're something we're not we don't have to pretend to be something we're not we are what we are and we want want to get better we are what we are but we want to come up a little higher I am where I am right now but that's not where I want to be tomorrow I am where I am right now but that's not where I want to be next year I want to keep moving forward Saints I can't change what I am right now but I can change moving forward and he knows what it's like because he felt it himself yet he was without sin which gave him the right to take away our sin because he endured everything that we endure and remained sinless he was able to descend into hell and take the keys is that right Saints so today we don't have to be afraid of God we can run to God can the musicians come we don't have to be afraid to ask for something we can run to God and ask for it we don't we don't have to wonder if we're all right if it's G to be okay we can run to him and and lay it on his altar we have the privilege tonight do you want to read that let's turn in our Bibles while we close maybe that little song created me a clean Hearts this in Hebrews the fourth chapter and we'll close in Hebrews the fourth chapter he says the 11th verse he said let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so Saints we we try to hide things from God we can't hide it he's piercing even to the marrow of the bone he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts see neither uh neither 13th verse neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so everything your life is an open book to him your struggles they're an open book to him your your failures they're an open book your faults it's an open book he already knows everything's open to him and his desire is to help us through those things his desire is to make a way of Escape for us his desire is to bring us back to what we was we bring us back to what the first Adam lost the second Adam came to restore and seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched by the feel of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore here we go saints come say it with me now boldly let us therefore now come boldly let us therefore now come boldly unto the throne of grace that we might obtain mercy and find Grace to help in a time of trouble in a time of need that we might find Grace that we might come boldly to obtain grace and mercy because of the high priest thank you Lord because of his purpose Glory because of the reason we're here what's this all about it's all about Jesus tonight can we do that tonight let us bow our heads can we do that tonight can we come tonight to the high priest that's been tempted in all manner like we're tempted can we come and receive Grace and obtain mercy and find help in a time of need can we come boldly to the throne of grace can we take off our bloody covering of man like Adam and Eve in the garden can we take off those old man-made coverings and skin and can we wrap ourself in his blood the blood of the righteous lamb can we receive the grace of God tonight can we receive his goodness tonight maybe you're putting on a good front tonight maybe you're putting on a you look good on the outside but on the inside you're hurting on the inside stuff is wrong on the inside you're all messed up you're all mixed up you don't know where you're standing tonight maybe you're struggling with something maybe you maybe you got a some kind of fault or some kind of flaw maybe you got some kind of Temptation and you're failing you're failing at it and it's pulling you down or maybe there's people in your life and they're pulling you down maybe there's people in your life that's no good for you and you need to cut them loose maybe you're struggling with someone and it's making you ashamed he already knows tonight you're an open book to him tonight he already sees tonight and his desire tonight is to help you maybe you got desires that's not pleasing to him he already knows and he desires to help you because his purpose from the beginning was to restore you back to your rightful place young people I know the devil is chirping in your ear trying to make you doubt this message I know the the the devil's like a roaring lion out
