the Bible real quick that goes with this song that I I like it's uh Titus 34-6 but after that the kindness and love of God our savior toward man appeared not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ Our Savior [Music] [Music] as I stood

and Lord hallelujah thank you Lord Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are [Music] possible Lord I believe God bless you you may be seated brother brandom and before we pray I would like to say this that last evening I believe it was I said to a lady if you'll just do is we're instructed to do that that would uh the baby with a Waterhead it would shrink and the baby's head shrunk last night one half an inch by measure of a string so the lady brought it here now I the reason I did that sister is for a purpose see if you can see something tangible happen that'll make your faith increase to keep believing it sometimes I do that just to maybe like ask the person to get up make a step or two move your hand wiggle your finger just something that they can do different just to let them see that it's all all right they just get nervous and think it isn't going to happen but it's happening all the time and it has to how many Wants To Be Remembered in prayer now would you just raise your hands and say Lord grant it let us our heads Lord as we hear this grand old Hymn of the church R by my precious friend Paul Raider only believe we are thinking now of a boy was brought by his fathers to the disciples no more than 10 days after Jesus had given them power to cast out devils and heal the sick and here they was completely defeated on an epileptic case and they seen our Lord coming and the father ran and said Lord have mercy on us my son is variously vexed with the devil and I brought him to your disciples and they could not cure him Jesus said I can if you believe only believe oh God you haven't changed a bit since then you're just the same loving sweet and compassionate God as you were then so are you today and Lord like that father we all cry Lord help thou our unbelief it's so simple we just stumble over it father we want to offer you thanks and praise for touching that little baby last night to see that that skull that's been swollen that is that the bone has pushed out it went down half an inch last night we are grateful for that father when we know it our doctors has nothing in the research for it there's nothing that they can do for it but Thou Art still God the master of all situations we thank thee father we thank thee for this Mother's loyalty and sweetness and obedience to bring back the string and paste it on this piece of paper here to show to the public her testimony for the glory of God May her little one live and be a normal child For Your Glory look at all those hands that went up father each of them had a need mine up too father I have need and here's many here in the form of letter or in this box that's needy people who are really needy let it come to pass Lord that each will receive their requests this night may they take this Mother's testimony and just as an example to show that when you say anything it's finished it's all we have to do is to receive it and act upon it it's a finished work Grant Lord that each one of these letters and these handkerchiefs the people that they're laid up on May they be healed everyone that raise their hands father they may receive their heart's desire we ask it in Jesus name amen you be seated I just wanted to show you the string here that the lady there you are that the little baby's head did shrink as the Lord promises through the Holy Spirit last night isn't he wonderful so gives us so much courage to have faith and believe now when Jesus said to that tree in Mark 11:23 no man eateth from thee from henceforth he might not have yelled out while as frankly he was easy about it till his disciples just I think one of them heard him and um it uh when that epileptic uh when it come up before the Lord Jesus the boy had the hardest fit he ever had perhaps fell on the ground like he was dead but he realized that he met someone who had Faith far above those Apostles now I'd like for someone who didn't believe in Divine Healing to watch this Jesus had given them power to cast the spirits out and they had failed not the power had failed but they had failed Jesus told them why could we not cast him out he said because of your unbelief the church still has a power God's never taken his power from the church but the church don't have faith enough to act upon it that's all it's just that simple we try to make it so complicated sometimes but the more simple you make the gospel the more reality you'll have when you just get real simple with it God said so that settles it that's all and just believe it go ahead when Jesus said no man eateth from thee while the leaves are just as pretty and bright as they ever was the bark look the same but way down beneath the ground in those roots the life begin to dwindle away so is it up on a cancer upon any kind of disease that that you might want to think when you can accept God's word word weighed down deep in the roots the cancer may be there your hand may be just as stiff that don't have anything to do with Divine Healing it's if thou can't believe see way down somewhere it's already gone to work Jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you've said isn't that lovely who that come from the Son of God whose words heavens and earth will pass away but now but his words want now the only way that you can do that you've got to have the right objective and the right motive now if I went out here and said I'll show you I can move this mountain be move Mountain it would never move certainly not no matter what I had it's got to be first you've got to find the will of God that's reason using the prayer lines I I get the very hardest is because it's something that's went through lines and so forth and that's where you get it back but see if you've got unconfessed sin did you ever notice on a Case before I asked the evil spirit to leave I watched that case real sure to be certain that there's nothing in that life that would hinder anything see because remember on these gifts you can get in trouble with him God you remember one time gave a prophet made a prophet out of a man Moses and told him go down and speak to the Rock and the prophet was all excited and went out and smok The Rock speaking of the weakness of Christ he'd have to die the second time or be smitten the second time he had power to bring it but it wasn't the will of God I never could believe that it was God's will for Elijah to go around C them children was teasing about being baldheaded I don't think he should have did that but he was a prophet was angered and he put a curse on those children and two she Bears killed 42 little innocent children but I don't believe he should have done that and it's just just we God I believe today before he puts his church in power he tries his church to see what it will do we um next time maybe the Lord's willing when I come back we have time to dwell on something like that on something it's fixing to happen and then we'll know more about it then but if you'll just speak the word say Lord I believe it don't doubt mean it in your heart now say for instance I was in a valley and I don't I'm preaching to millions of people but just across the mountain there is a group of people of 100 and they're dying without knowing Christ well I've got a million here to preach to but yet something in my heart's telling me get across to those people get to them they're perishing I don't want to go myself but yet there's something in me see that's God then moving see what the objective is see what the motive is the going not for self now if I say well if uh my objec is right to get over there but then I get up there and here's a big mountain I say you know if I get over that mountain and save all those hundred people someday they'll have a statue there brother brand the great missionary now my motive is not right the mountain won't fall no sir but when my motive and objective is right and God in my heart is leading me and I can't get over the mountain around the mountain Under the Mountain I'd say mountain move maybe when I say that no more than I say it with that kind of of a right Spirit Led of the holy spirit in the will of God there might not be but one little spoonful of that mountain dropped down but it's on its Road the next day there may be a two lbs fall the next day a quarter of a ton and maybe in a month five ton drops in what of it may not even see it yet but she's moving on it road I'll stay right there and watch the thing be done because God said so and that just settles it praise the Lord can you think that about your mother there tonight all right if you'll think it she'll get well all right that's if you just believe it just speak the word and stay with it see just believe it hang on to it it's eternal life now tomorrow afternoon I told Billy uh tonight just to omit the prayer cards and I want to speak I'm confessing in truth I've been going since January overseas and back phich home back and all completely that discernment I am so weak hard know where I'm standing at times it's just about got me Whipped out now I have to leave and they you you Brethren invited me to stay over for some more days how I appreciate that I certainly think that this is a wonderful bunch of ministers here wish we could have had a little more time for fellowship if the Lord willing I'll be back sometime nothing else just go from one Church to the other and wind around around to the city and visit you all I'd be glad to do that anything that I could do to help the kingdom of God that is if you'd want me to do it and to come back sometime and join up with us and have a nice good meeting somewhere and remember Brethren I'll be praying for you that's one thing sure and I want you all to pray for me all of you and now uh um tomorrow morning is a church services all these different fine churches around the city now some of the groups from Jeffersonville is here some of my friends one of my Trustees of the church is here brother Fred sofman I've never been able to see him in the meeting and brother all many other my friends from up there at Jeffersonville my PR my secretary there and and all is here somewhere in the meeting I haven't seen them yet and Brethren there's some fine churches here in this city and all the rest of you visitors find one of them and go to these churches tomorrow they'll do you good I'm sure there are Brethren who believe believe in this kind of a ministry that's the reason you're here sitting on the platform and down in the places here because they believe in it and I appreciate those men Lord bless this full gospel businessman's chapter here who who sponsored this meeting or I believe that was right it sponsored the meeting uh I go a lot of their sponsors because in there we often to be this way but many times Brethren lets little bit of differences like a man leave a little something another little something it kind of makes a little friction and old Sor some way back it ought to be healed up by this time but it it and if you I get the Full Gospel business man then that kind of helps bind it up and we get together and we have real Fellowship together just real good times and we appreciate that God bless that chapter I believe the Lord raised it up for a purpose now and I had the grand privilege of seeing BR brother or Robert's place the other day and my such a mammoth Place such a beautiful thing it's it's a memorial to Pentecost then I went over to brother Tommy osburn's another wonderful place wonderful man of God who brother Tommy and I are just close and brother oral too just real close brothers and we love one another and trying our best to work everything that we can for the good of the people in the kingdom of God so I certainly appreciate those men being here in this city among the rest of these fine men you've got you sheep have got wonderful Shepherds I'll say it like that may the Lord continue to be with you all is my prayer and now tomorrow afternoon uh what time's the service start brother 2:30 2:30 let's say 1 1 or 1:30 you ought to be here so they won't interrupt with the rest of the services now if the boys hasn't already told you tonight uh they have some books pictures and so forth and tapes and records and other the meetings and they sell them but we will not let them sell them on the Sabbath tomorrow no books or nothing to be sold tomorrow so we won't we never permitted that although many said you're awful wrong and old daddy Bosworth used to tell me oh brother renom you're wrong there but that's the way I feel see and I I feel if you want one to give you one but if you but uh we can't sell on on the Sabbath no and on if I believe that I got to live it just I got to live with myself you see I got to live with my conviction and so or you can send home up the house up the place and get it now tonight oh let's just all just forget that that there's any work to be done or anything else or the toils of the day let's just lay aside everything and look into the word for a few minutes and see what God would speak to us through his word and may I pray that God will just give us an extremely great blessing tonight Jean could you kidnap her for me could you kidnap that little girl for me Isn't She a pretty little thing would you like to go home with me and play with my little Sarah about this high oh you would I'd like for you to she's just about your size and she's daddy's little girl I bet you you love your daddy too don't you mommy oh sure you do the prettiest little girl I'm sitting here looking at little eyes look like two burnt holes in the blanket and and little brown hair I just love little children I got two little girls at home one of them is Rebecca and the other one is Sarah here some time ago I away they're both Daddy's Little Girls you and I love them and as soon as they get in I got to give them a piggy back and only Becky's getting too big for it she's big as I am she'd break my back now she but she still daddy little girl anyhow and now about another year we won't get her in Bible School somewhere and away from the public school and then they was waiting up for Daddy you know to come home I've been out in the meeting and tomorrow night they'll be waiting until midnight for me to try to get in and uh so I got in real early in the morning around 3 or 4:00 and mother come the door and let me in and I was so tired and weary I here on the platform uh one the anointed it feels fine but when that once leaves you that's where you get in trouble how many ever knew that well sure it is look Elijah went up on the mountain and called fire out of Heaven call Rain Out of Heaven and then when the spirit left him he wandered Into the Wilderness 40 days and God found him pulled back in a cave somewhere Jonah he went out and stayed live in a belly of a whale for three days and nights was spit out up on the bank and went around preaching the whole city repented and come to God and when the anointing left him he went up on top of the hill and asked God to take his life see I stand by the side of William kapper's grave not long ago that wrote that famous hymn that we Ed at our communion service there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins were Sinners plunged beneath the flood did you ever hear what he happened to him at the inspiration left him from that he tried to find the river to commit suicide I lived right across the Old Kentucky Home and Steven's Foster gave America its most famous folk songs and when he write get inspiration up that inspiration write a song then when he come out of it he go get on a drunk finally called a servant and Tu a razor and committed suicide people don't know what those people that live that spiritual realm go through and now hear you feel like you can move a mountain but just let the anointing drop from you start through that door and somebody ain't there to catch you and then maybe for a few hours you hardly wonder where you're at and then night after night that takes the best of you and little want to tell you about little Sarah and Rebecca so the next morning I couldn't sleep and I got up was sitting in the chair and ATA Becky being the oldest she was had longer legs than Sarah and so uh Becky come running woke up jumped out of bed not waking her little sister up here she come through the house running as hard as she could she's saying Daddy Daddy I stuck out one of my legs and she jumped across there pretty well balanced kind of like the the modern Church you know it's been in the game for a long time you know for several hundred years she could balance herself right well and she put her arm around me and said oh my daddy my daddy little Sarah had in the commotion woke up well I don't know where your children does they're not mine do the little younger one gets the hand-me-downs so Sarah had on Becky's pajamas feet about that much too long you know and here she come little bitty short fella falling stumbling and she got there a little late so Becky turned around and said Sarah my sister I want to tell you something she said I was your first and I have the Monopoly so I've got all of Daddy and there's none left for you that's the way some people try to think about religion isn't it that's right and poor little Sarah she dropped her little lip her little black eyes looked up me and she started to cry and Becky had her cheek against mine hugging me I love her and Sarah started to walk away cuz Becky had all a daddy I scooted the other knee out like this and motion to her like that oh she perked up right quick and run jumped up on my knees so she hadn't been around very long her legs wouldn't even reach the floor she's kind of a little tottery perhaps like I am just a little totter you know and she didn't couldn't reach the floor she wasn't a big denomination you know and so she couldn't get out on the solid floor she hadn't been around long enough and so she was kind of tottering and I throw both arms around her like this and hugged her up close to me and she sparkled those little black eyes and looked back to Rebecca she said Rebecca my sister she said she said it may be true that you've got all of daddy but I want you to know one thing Daddy's got all of [Music] me that's just so he's got all of me I might not had the education to put the big things over but just long as I know he's got all of me in my toter just let him have both arms around it'll just make me feel fine well let's offer another little word of prayer to him before we open up the word now Heavenly Father we realize that we are just like children also and and you love to be with us and worship with us and as we worship you and you love us and Hold Us in your arms and send down your Holy Spirit and make us to know that you're living and you're our father we thank you so much now let the Holy Spirit come to us tonight love each Heart Lord give us a fresh blessing pour out the do drops of mercy upon us father do not look at our sins they're too many Lord just forgive them omit them Father and just take us into thy arms and and heal our sickness and and cleanse our souls and set our Spirits free Lord that we can worship and praise thee be like little children running around the house just know that Daddy's watching over us granted Lord now no man is able to to interpret the word we realize that John saw the book in the right hand of him that set up on the throne and there was no man in heaven or in Earth or beneath the Earth that was worthy to take the book to open it or to loose the seals and there come a lamb up that had been slaying since the foundation of the world and he was worthy and he took the book l Lo the seals and open the book oh lamb come tonight open the book To Us father as we wait upon thee for we ask it in Jesus name the Lamb of God Amen I have chosen tonight a little scripture verse share of three words but first I want to read a vers atud out of St John the 11th chapter beginning with the 23rd verse Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God that should come into the world and for our text I wish to use these three words believest thou this I read a story sometime ago I think it was a fiction story and most all ministers I guess have read Dr Ingram's book of um of the prince of the House of David it's a great book I think it's absolutely out of print I like to have it in print so I could put it among the people and in there I was reading a little article on this Lazareth and Upon Jesus and Mary and Martha Marth that the sisters of Lazarus and I was reading in there that word Jesus lived I believe with Martha and Mary they were both lovely Hebrew girls and Lazarus was learning or training to be a scribe at the temple making letters of the law for the priest and Jesus had Great Fellowship especially with Lazarus and we read in the book that where he did come to their home and Martha was a little diler about uh listening to his words but she had to get the dinner ready and set the table but Mary sat at his feet and Jesus said that Mary has chosen the better things and then we were told that Lazarus was the one that brought uh uh Jesus to John in the story of Dr Ingram's books and uh on the prince the House of David however that might not have been true I do not know but just for the background of it but he was supposed to been living with them now we've been learning this coming this last week rather that Jesus said in St John 5:19 I the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise the father worketh and the son worketh hither to see what he sees the father doing so to make this really the right story The Father God must have spoke to his son Jesus and said your friend Lazareth is going to die but it's going to be for the good so you leave the home go away because it'll be asking you to pray for him and make him well and and I don't want you to do that if you watch the story as we go along you'll see it heaps up to that very truth of that so Jesus just without any warning or anything walked away from the house and went somewhere else didn't return that night and he went to some other cities and as soon as Jesus left the home then trouble set in and when Jesus leaves your home trouble is on its Road just remember when he leaves your home trouble is on the way when you get social societies and everything operating in your church so perfectly like some great big 16 cylinder Rick and Backer and you leave Jesus out of it when Jesus goes from your church troubles on the road yes sir when Jesus leaves a denomination that they lay him aside and say well now we just don't believe that these things could be just exactly right you adopt something else troubles on its Road just remember that reminds me of a story of the Lord Jesus is found in the Book of Luke you know when he was just a boy of about 12 years old his people taken him as the custom was each year up to the Feast of Pentecost and while they were in the city of Jerusalem uh uh at the feast and having a good time we find in the Bible that they went three days without him and they they thought maybe just took it for granted that Jesus must have been among some of their kin folks now we cannot do that when they come to go through their kin folks to find out he wasn't there and we can't take it for granted just because we're a Methodist Baptist Pres Terian Pentecost and our backgrounds and our forefathers were great Believers we just take it well for granted Jesus is with us we can't do that we've got to be in contact with him every day and every minute oh I love that I want what God is now what my parents had what my forefathers had is wonderful but what they had is good I think we're farther up the road let's see what he is today I don't want to look back and see what Mr Moody did because we're farther up the road in Mr Moody the trouble of the church is we look back and say U well let's see what Mr John Wesley said what some of the others said that's the reason science is so farther in their field than religion isn't its here 300 years ago a French scientist proved that if you'd go the terrific speed of 35 M hour gravitation would take you off the Earth you think science would refer back to that today they're going 1,900 M hour and still going on they're pressing forward looking forward but we want to look back and see what Moody said sanki said finny said Knox Calvin some of those what they said was all right that was for their age but we're going on my grandfather rode a oxcart I'm driving a Ford V8 my son will fly a Jet Plane that's where we're moving on that's what religion ought to be the coming of the Lord is at hand the church ought to be moving on into the powers science can only climb so far and and it has to drop off but we got untapped sources that's never been touched of the power unlimited of God that we ought to be moving into we are living a million miles under our privilege tonight of privileges of Christians to be en Joy I feel ashamed of myself when I look out here and see the institutions and the sickness and the trouble that's going on right now our church are be walking the street Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out Devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize that Jesus Christ lives that's what we need to be done doing why do you say Mr Moody never Mr Moody wasn't living in this day that's right we're living on the coming of the Lord and we just took it for granted that he was with our kin folks but the other day when a challenger challenge Mr Grim we found out that he was was among our kin folks where do they find him where did where did they find Jesus right where they left him where did leave him at the Feast of Pentecost where do we leave Jesus where did the church at the Feast of Pentecost when we get away from that Old Time Pentecostal power and the Feast of Pentecost we walk away from Jesus that's exactly right friend we are living under under our privileges yes sir they left him at the Feast of Pentecost and there's the only place that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian and Pentecostals will ever find him is go back where you're left him at where is the joy of the Lord where is the power of the Lord the church asked today what what happened to the god of History he's waiting for his people to call him on the scene but we can't do it to denominations we can't do it under uh psychology we can't do it under arithmetic or we can't do it with education we separate ourselves divide ourselves we are not Divided We are one person indeed in Christ Jesus we are all one in Christ and our denominations will never do it as good as they are they won't do it our education is the greatest hindrance the gospel ever had is education what we need is not education we need the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in the church to demonstrate the power Jesus never said go into all the world and teach he never said go into all the world and he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and the gospel is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost the resurrection we're still a million miles sharp and where we should be let us move forward let's go back where we left him at the Feast of Pentecost Jesus said in John I'll be the 15th chapter he said I am the vine ye are the branches well now if that vine put forth the first branch and out of that Branch wrote a book of Acts the second Branch will make another book of Acts the third branch will make another book of Acts and every branch that comes out of that vine will be the same as the first Branch was now you can draft we know that I've seen a citrus tree with about eight different kinds of fruit on it I've seen an orange tree putting grapefruits and lemons and everything else on it but they were drafted in that's what's the matter today we've drafted in our ideas drafted in our denominations but if that tree ever puts forth another fruit Vine itself it'll be like the original was it went it hallelujah oh church WIll blend together but we need the power of the original we need the Holy Ghost the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what he told us to do I am the vine ye are the branches if a grape vine puts forth a Shute it comes out with pretty blue grapes the next Vine it brings out will have pretty blue grapes on it if the first Vine come out and they fell under the impact of the Holy Spirit and they did great Miracles and signs and sealer testimony to a world even many of them with their own testimony they with their blood they seal their testimony they went through all kinds of perils and everything to bring the gospel they suffered they were beaten they were punished must we be carried home to heaven on a fly bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas what do we expect to do I must fight if I must Reign increase my courage Lord certainly we need a we don't need a new denomination we don't need a new church building what we need today is an old time Backwoods sky sin killing Pentecostal Revival that was born in Pentecost and back into the church again the power of the Holy Ghost again to bring Jesus on the scene the god of History always Rises on the scene in a crucial moment we need it that's what's a matter church today we're getting too far back we're falling into the passions of the world gradually year by year it begins to die a little and wither away it's pruning time pretty soon God will cut it back as sure as I'm standing this pit God will cut her back to make her bear fruit he'll cut the works of the world out of it one of these days such a disgrace the way the church has carried on under the name of religion and we find out when Jesus left death set in when Jesus leaves our church the power of the Holy Spirit leaves our church it begins to dwindle and and die and after while there's nothing more to it now when Jesus left death set in Oh What a Sad time it was and notice they wandered around and they sent for Jesus but he didn't come they sent for him again and he didn't come but he know what he was going to do he knows tonight what he's going to do it's not lost with him he knows exactly what he's fixing to do he's going to raise up people up this as certain as I'm standing this pit he'll raise up people for his name's sake now the Gentile generation he'll do it the Jews times right at hand now and the Gentiles are ending out because they just went on out they're rejecting Christ they're rejecting their signs they're rejecting everything is called Godly and branded is some kind of telepathy or devil power and do they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost and sealing themselves away from God and God will take that Minority after a while and raise it up into a powerful church and then turn the spirit to the Jews and take the Gentile Church home exactly right she's in the making now wow we're at the end time nearly Jesus he knew and after a while he said our friend Lazarus sleepeth while the disciples thought he was taking a little rest he said well if he's asleeping he's doing very well well he said in his their words so that they would understand said he's dead and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there see for your sake say I'm glad I wasn't there because they' been asking him to to heal the healing but he know he couldn't do it because the vision was yet after those four days he know that was the time the father told him how beautifully set the grave father I thank the as I was already heard but I just say it for these that stands by he already know what he was going to do he said I'll go wake him now I can imagine that little home was really broken up the bread winter gone sadness oh it's one ful when you got a sad home or a sad heart then Jesus appears all at once isn't it I can imagine seeing Martha a beautiful little woman with the Black Veil over her face a little Mary and them holding one another saying what will we do Papa and Mama's Gone and our precious brother now we have left the church and we're excommunicated from them and come out to follow Jesus of Nazareth and he's pulled away and left us somewhere I can hear a Critic come by and say Hey where's that Divine healer that prophet of Galilee where's he at now see when it really comes the time for him to do something he's gone there it is see God just loves to do that just to let people just let people show what they are just trying them to see what they really are he gives them a blessing he appears shows himself introduces himself to the people just to see what kind of a reaction they'll take just to see what they'll do about it now we find that after uh a few days four days poor Lazarus was dead they bued him second day Third Day fourth day now anyone knows corruption sets in after 3 days the nose falls in on the face first and then corruption sets in the skin worms begins to eat the body they laid him in the ground put a big rock over the top of the cave where they had him and every once in a while the young girls that go out and kneel down the grave and cry after a while the news got around Jesus has come we've seen him moving into the city oh that little Martha that had been so seemingly so dilit about it she proved then what she was made out of here she comes she's coming on her road then run out seeking I can hear some of them along the road say well I guess you're satisfied now that your religion was false she just ignored them and went on past out on by all the critics she went down till she seen him maybe sitting down at the street corner now it's seemingly she must she might have had a right to uaid him and and speak evil to him why she didn't run and say look at here look at here you you're supposed to be a prophet a man of God why didn't you come when we called you why we're the life and stock of the town now we come out of our church to follow you seemed like she had a right but you know just like I preached on the lamb and Dove if we're a lamb a lamb forfeits every right he's got it's exactly right right he ain't got nothing but wool so he has to Forfeit that and you forfeit every right that you've got to serve God that's exactly right I was getting after women about the way they's wearing these little old clothes you know and they said well we're we're Americans we can do what we want to I said that's exactly right but if you're a lamb you'll forfeit your rights smoking cigarettes and carrying all like that that's the worst thing a woman ever done exactly right a lady said to me not long ago talking you said brother brandom they don't make no other kind of clothes I said they still make sewing machines and sell Goods there's no excuse for at all exactly right remember someday you may be pure here to your husband but you'll answer for adultery part this is certainly whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart what's the matter with the Pentecostal women today is what I'm a wondering how you have got away from the old hu line how your mothers used to wear long hair and today the Pentecost women Cain up like a bunch of mudy GRS and cut their hair and wear their little Shar clothes like that just like the rest of the we get out and mold the yard in the afternoon when man's coming by do you realize woman that you're going to have to answer for committing adultery without that man you present yourself to them for that purpose it's a evil spirit on the church and the people and they don't know it blind and don't know it the truth maybe you might say I haven't got a right to say that as evangelist well I I have to follow the leading of the Holy SP that's all I can say you know if I meet you judgment then I won't have to have your blood on my hands get away from every bit of the ground that looks like Satan stay away from it get come I don't care how many television stars you're not here a television star you're a daughter of God preaching in the pastor's Church the other morning about an old slave time is selling slaves long ago and they used to come by and buy them on the auction and the people were they're weeping crying because they're Homeland they never go back no more and they had to whip them and they'd buy them just like you'd buy an automobile just for anything with prices and selling them human beings and one day a buyer come byy a broker to a big found a big Plantation rather and he said how many slaves you got for sale said well he got some to swap they try to get them big take them mothers fathers if the woman he had married was a little weakly woman take these big healthy men and breed them like horses animals never was right God made man man made slaves not right to begin with never God don't intend any man to be a slave no sir and no watch what taking place then in the midst of all that this fell said well I'd like to buy some that he notice one young fellow there they didn't have to whip him his chin was up head up just like a real gentleman walking around and that broker said I'd like to buy him he said but he's not for sale he said well why said is he the boss he said he's a slave well said why do you feed him better than you do the rest of him he said no he eats out there in the galley with the rest of them he's a slave said what makes him so much different in the rest of them and the boss said I wondered that myself for a long time but one day I found out over in the Homeland his father is a king of the tribe and though he's an alien away from home he still knows he's a King's son and he conducts himself like one if if an African lady could realize that his father is a king and over here an alien in a Strange Land can still know that across the sea he's a King's son how art women and men conduct themselves when you're Sons and Daughters of God act like it certainly conduct yourself clean up yourselves and act like Sons and Daughters of God wonder what a condition here we are oh Little Martha come running out she looked like she had a a way to have said something against him why didn't you come to my brother look what we've done for you and you let us down well if she had have said that the story never would have finished the way it did it's the way you approach a Divine gift of God if God sends a gift you got to approach it right if you're ever expect to get anything from it you've got to approach it right and Martha knew that she'd probably read about the shunamite woman and her baby and if that shite woman knew that God was in Elijah how much more was he in Jesus sure so she went up with the right approach she run up and fell down at his feet I like that fell down at his feet and said Lord that's his right title that's what he was he was her Lord Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died oh my oh I could just imagine seeing his great heart as he looked at that beautiful woman with tears running down her cheeks said Lord if you'd have been here my brother would not have died watch what she said but even now Lord though he's dead though the skin worms is crawling through his body even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you oh that's the secret you might say I've seen through every hospital the doctor says I'm going to die but e even now Lord I'm all CED up with the arthritis I can't move but even now Lord that little baby had a Waterhead that big around last night there's nothing he do it spread on out and burst his little head and die but even now Lord he's still the same God he's still the same Lord even now Lord and he's sitting at the right hand of God Almighty making intercessions upon the things that we claim that he's done for us now I really feel religious sure I do you're going to call me a Holy Roller anyhow so you might as well get started and get it over with so yes sir even now Lord whatever you ask God God will do it ask the father anything in my name I'll do it Jesus said even now Lord whatever you ask God will give it to you oh that must have turned in his great heart he said thy brother shall live again she said y Lord he'll live he was a good boy he'll come forth in the general Resurrection at the last day them Jews believe in the general Resurrection he'll come forth in the Resurrection The Last Days look at him he pulled his little self together he said I am the resurrection life oh my there never was a man can say that before there never will be one afterward can say it he's the only one that can say I am the resurrection and life sayth the Lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this she said yay Lord oh she know something is fixing to hat has to be When Faith from an honest heart meets God them cogs just comes together like that something has to take place I challenge this audience tonight in the name of Jesus Christ let your faith connect with God like in a few minutes we'll have other V there will be such a Revival break in this town there would be enough cops in the country to keep them down that's right there will be a real Revival even now Lord well Lord we've done call off in this we've did this and did that I don't care what you've done even now Lord he's waiting for you to call on him believe us now this sure es sir even now whatever you ask him where have you laid him now he goes down to the Grave he was man enough to cry he was God enough to raise the dead here's sometime ago a woman that belongs to a certain group of people I never make it a habit to make about denominations but this woman they do not believe that Jesus was divine they said he was just a prophet now he was if he is just a prophet we're all in sin he was either God nothing less than God or the biggest deceiver the world ever had that's right he was more than a man she said he wasn't Divine there's so much of that in this social gospel today trying to make Jesus Christ a prophet why he was a god of the prophets sure he was she said I prove it to you for your Bible he was just a man I said you do it and she said when he went to the grave of Lazarus the Bible said he wept he had to be martal or he couldn't weep I said lady is that your scripture I don't mean to be sacrilegious here to say this but I'll tell you what I told her she said that's it I said that statement is weaker than the broth made out of a shadow of a chicken that starve to death I said well you you haven't got one thing to stand on she said why he wept that showed he was Mortal I said he was both mortal and Immortal he was God in flesh she said all nonsense I said he went to the Grave weeping that's true enough but when he straighten his little self up the Bible said there wasn't much to look upon him no Beauty we should desire him but when he F them little shoulders back and said Lazareth come forth and a man had been dead 4 days and rotten in the grave he came forth that was more than a man show me the man you knew it what was it corruption knew its Master life knew its creator something had to happen he spoke and a man that was dead and in the grave for 4 days raised again stood on his feet and liveed Hallelujah that was God in his son yes sir that was God making himself known through his son that was God speaking not a man he was a man when he looked around on that tree that day for something to eat that was a man but when he took five biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God was more than a prophet more than a man he was the god man sure he laid on the back of that little boat that night and the Seas roaring and bouncing like a bottle stoer out there in that Mighty Sea when 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they had drowned him that night he was a man weak and TI from praying for the sick laying back there and the wind didn't even disturb him he was a man when he was asleep when he woke up put his foot upon the bra of the boat looked up and said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him that was more than a man that was God in man making himself known that's right he was a man at the cross when he cried for Mercy when he cried said I thirst that was a man when he died he was a man but on Easter morning when he broke the seals of death hell in the grave and rose again he was more than a man God no one of the for said living he loved me dying he saved me there he carried my sins far away Rising he justified freely forever someday
