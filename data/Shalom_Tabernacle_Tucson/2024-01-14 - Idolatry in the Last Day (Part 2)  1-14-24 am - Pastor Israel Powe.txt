========================================

am man good morning uh welcome to the house of the Lord we like to go right into our adult Sunday School portion of the service and we're in the seals we just finished the first seal and we're going to start the second seal so let's all stand we'll turn into the scriptures in Revelations chapter 6 versus number three we're starting right at quote paragraph number 23 and we'll go for 20 minutes for the adult Sunday School portion of the service like to welcome each of you to the house of the Lord amen let us bow our heads and have a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for for bringing us together once again Lord we ask for your blessings to come upon the service Lord the meeting our gathering together speak to our hearts we pray Lord open our hearts and our ears to hear the word that you have for us bless the smaller classes Lord and uh our time coming together we just love you and we thank you we ask these blessings in Jesus name amen Revelations 6 verse number three and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword Lord amen so we're prepared to hear this portion of the message only be only believe that all things are possible only be only only believe [Music] only all things are possible only be God bless you you may be seated brother brandham now the first and second verse I'll read it to kind of give a little background then we'll take the third and fourth verse for the second seal and then the fifth th and sixth verse is the third seal and the seventh and eighth is the two verses to each harsh Rider and I want you to watch how these Fellas on this Pale Horse maybe here it comes just keeps changing as it goes down and then that great last seal to be open if God willing next Sunday night that when it happened there was just only thing had taken place was silence in heaven for a half hour God help us now I'll read the third verse now and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse fourth verse that was red and power was given to him that set there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now a mysterious thing now when the the Beast told John just come and see and he didn't see what it was he just saw a symbol and that symbol the reason it was he said come see but he saw a symbol that he was to symbolize it to the church in a way that they would watch until it came to the last age and then the seals would be open I everyone understands that now see the seals would be open and aren't you happy to be living in this day see not only that friends but always remember now last Sunday morning where the whole thing was based on Simplicity yes amen simple humble happens in such a way that people just go right on by and don't even even though it happens and remember we are looking for the coming of the Lord anytime and um when we uh made a statement that uh uh perhaps the Rapture would be the same way it'll be gone over and no one will nor about you just come like that see usually just go all back through the Bible and look how it happens like that yes amen even as great a thing as the Lord Jesus coming nobody knew nothing about they thought they cranked somebody the churches said just a fanatic he's really crazy he said he's a mad man we know the art mad mad means crazy we know you got a devil and it's running you crazy and you try to teach us when you were born out there illegitimately where you was born in fornication try to teach man like us the priest and so forth the temple my that was a an insult to them when John came been talked about down Through the Ages from Isaiah to Malachi that's 12200 or 712 years he had been seen of the prophets coming everybody was looking for him to come expecting it at any time but the way he come he preached and done his service and went on into glory and even the apostles didn't know it right for they asked him they said now if the son of man is going to Jerusalem all these things to be offered said why is it the scripture says that Elias is going to come first Jesus said he's already come you didn't know it and he did just exactly what the scriptures said he would do and they did to him just what was listed amen and they couldn't understand he said it was John that oh see that they woke up to it they and when even at last after all the things he he had done and the signs he did had showed him and had even called him said which one of you can condemn me of sin unbelief if I haven't done just what the scripture said that my office would do when I come to the Earth then show me where I've sinned see and I'll show you what you're supposed to be and let's see whether you believe it or not see he'll come right back and said you're supposed to believe on me when I come and they didn't do it see so they know better than tying on himm that but he said which one of you can accuse me of unbelief see haven't I done just what it was and even the apostles going along stumbled we know how the scriptures going then finally at last they said now we believe we believe that no man has to tell you for you know all things I just like to seen his face he must have looked at and said well do you now believe finally it dawned on well it was wasn't supposed to be maybe till that time and God works everything just right you know I love him for that but now we're thinking of our age now because we get talking on that we won't get into these seals at all and um I remember uh I'm getting much requests for prayer for the sick and I'm praying for the all the time for every request to get and for the handkerchiefs and things and if we can get these seals finished up to the last seal Sunday morning we if it be the will of the Lord would like to have just a good oldfashioned healing service here you know we just take the entire morning for praying for the sick and I I'm pretty sure it'll be a strange healing meeting see I just have a feeling like that and so not strange but it may be a little strange to some see what um now how great is God's grace to reveal his secrets to us in this this day now we all will believe that we're living in the last day we believe that and remember the secrets was to be revealed in the last day and how does he reveal his word his Secrets the Bible would you like to read where he says it let's just turn over and see how he Reveals His Secrets now I want you to read Amos turn over to the Book of Amos and I want you to read in the third chapter of Amos and the seventh verse all right I going read the 6 verse two shall a trumpet blow in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the Lord has not done it surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his Secrets unto his servants the prophets now in the last days we are it's predicted to us that there will rise a a prophet now we know that we've had all kinds I realize that we looking around tonight uh I'm speaking here where students are sitting and I I'd like for you to understand me and you realize these tapes cover the world see just about all the world and I want you to not by no means think that I am trying to inject some kind of a a cult of Elijah's blankets or robes and all all those things we've had plenty of but you know all those things are only a forerunning of the real thing that is to come to throw the people off did you know we had false uh uh false leaders raised up false Messiah before Christ come did not the the teacher of that day that Mighty teacher make when the the question come up about beating these men and so forth he said let them alone if it's of God you'll be fine fighting against God but if it isn't of God so didn't a man raise up not long ago take 400 Into the Wilderness and so forth we have those things what was it all forerunning the real thing when it comes now see Satan raises those up watch the shrewdness of this fellow that we're talking about here Satan where we're unfolding him right here just strien him down by the scriptures and let you see who he is that's what the what supposed to be done and you remember he has not tried to go in and be a communist Satan hasn't he's an antichrist so close that Jesus said would deceive the very elected and that's the ones that's hid down in these seals whose names are on the books since the foundation of the world he is a shrewd fellow and when he sees this thing come coming coming up then he throws everything he can out there to upset it before it gets there did you know there will be false Christ rise in the last days it should follow immediately after this after this great message that this uh a brother will speak that will'll actually come be anointed in the spirit of Elijah immediately and they'll mistake him some of them will think he's the Messiah but he'll R they say no because it's got to be coming like John in the time of John the Baptist when he came out there to preach they said to him aren't you the Messiah aren't you he he said I am not I'm not worthy to loose his shoes but I I baptize you with water but he'll baptize with the Holy Ghost and John was so sure that he's on Earth he said he is among you somewhere now but he didn't know on him till he saw that sign come down upon him then when he seen that light coming down spread out like a dove and lit up on him he said there he is but John was the only one saw it you know John was the only one heard the voice all the rest of there no one heard it but then when the real true servant comes on with all the impersonation to it it's to upset the people's mind Satan does that and those you that can't discern right from heart they just tumble over but the elected won't do it the Bible said he wouldn't be able to deceive the elected and now just before the coming of Christ the Bible said there will be false Christ arise and will claim to be Christ you would say l the people say it's in the desert don't believe it l is in the secret chamber don't believe it or as the sun shineth from the East and to the West so shall the coming of the son of man be see yes he'll He he'll appear and it'll be a universal thing and now that will of course when they find out that something is taking place you see then they'll now remember that will take place immediately after the going home of the church at the rampure now there'll be false impersonations all the time and we do not mean to be connected in anything like that no sir and I believe when the person comes this one that's predicted to come I'm showing it only by the scriptures that the man will have to be a prophet he certainly will and the revelation of God because God the word of the Lord comes to his Prophet exactly right that's and God cannot change you see if he had a better system he would he would have used it but he he's got he chose the best system at the beginning just like he could have chose a son to preach the gospel he could chose the moon he could chose the the wind but he chose man amen and he never did choose groups individuals see are never two Major Prophets on the earth at the same time see every man is different he's got a different makeup God can get one person that's all he has to have right in his hand he do what he wants to am he just has to have one in the days of Noah Days of Elijah days of Moses many trou was up in time of Moses you know how they didn't wanted to say well you're not the only Holy One in the bunch and and Dayan and and Kora and God said just separate yourself I'll just open up the Earth and swallow them away you see and and so and then the people got to complaining he said I'll just I'll take the whole thing away and there Moses took the place of Christ and to throw himself in the breach and say don't do it Lord see and of course he after ordained Moses do this didn't come over Moses cuz he was acting like Christ in that time it was Christ in Moses amen absolutely now we're so glad today that God is revealing hisself to us and I believe the great day is just begin Dawning breaking the lights are begin to flesh the birds of paradises begin to sing in the Saints heart they know this isn't long now something's going to happen got so if he does not do anything now all scripture is inspired amen the scriptures must absolutely be the truth no way around it that's why different with our friends the Catholic church I believe that it was not written by just mere man I believe it was moved by the Holy Spirit and all these little things things that's been added and tried to add to it did you notice that the solving up there's everyone kicked out and these real true scriptures Dove tail one with the other to there's no contradiction in them no at all show me one piece of literature that can it can write a verse harly without contradicting itself write a verse atud and the Bible does not contradict itself anywhere amen I've heard the old critic say that but I've had an offer for him for a long time it'll show me where it's at it isn't in here it's just because the human mind is confused God's not confused he know what he's doing he knows look if God's go to judge the World by a church as the Catholic Church says it is all right then what church is that just look at the churches we got we got 900 and something different organization of churches ahuh one teaches this way and one that way what a confusion then anybody just do anything you want to you go on anyhow God's Got To Have Some standard am that's his word speaking not throwing off to the Catholic now cu the the Protestant is just as bad but uh speaking with a priest he said Mr Brandon he said God is in his church I said sir God is in his word and he is the word that's sir he said well he's in the church is in infallible I said he don't say that but he said the word infallible he said well we used to teach that baptism that way and so forth I said when said back in the early days I said do you allow that to be the Catholic church he said yes I said then I'm Catholic oldfashioned Catholic I believe the oldfashioned way you guys today got all messed up and hardly anything in the scripture you teach intercession with women and dead people and all these other things and oh my not meat eating and I don't know what all see I said you find that in the scripture for me he said it don't have to be there as long as the church says so that's it don't make any what that says it's the church I said the Bible said that whosoever shall add one word to it or take one away his part will be taken in the book of life so it's the word I believe the word now and then if Amos says and other scriptures that go with it that if uh and you remember on this we're just striking the highlights of it just my if when I get in that room there and and that anointing comes in if I could write down what he what all goes on I'd be here for three months on one of the seals so just strike the places and let it out just what it would seem to be that wouldn't choke the people but yet uh not enough to hurt them but just so that believing it is it is season the thing you know what I mean now watch this now if God does not do nothing said Amos until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets and then we see what he's doing it must be that he's fixing to do something what he's revealing now God is fixing to move on the scene in judgment I believe amen he's fixing to do something and one thing again it testifies surely we are in the last days we're at the End of the Age the lady OFA Church age now for these things were to be revealed only at the last day I just think of that now it's just just try to soak in what we believe that the Holy Spirit would have us no now remember nothing to be revealed God will do nothing at all until first he reveals it to his servants the prophets and before he does anything he reveals it and when he reveals it you can remember this something's on its Road it's being revealed and these things that we're talking about was to be revealed at the last day just before the last trumpet at the end of the message of the last Church age amen that's right amen if you want to read that now you can turn to you I just referred to you last night two three times Revelations 10 1-7 see and in the days of the the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God would be revealed and finished amen and there's only one thing left when this uh seven sealed book is open than the entire mystery of God what we've probed that through years and according to the scripture then we there was no way to understand it until this day amen but because it's been hid amen we've seen the symbol what it was symbolized by but it could not be correctly revealed until the last day now then we must be there at the at the end time [Music] h [Music] now [Music] I

chapter 2 and 2 Timothy chapter 3 I ask you to stand for the reading of the word amen and then we have a visitor here this young lady here so happy to have you her name is Barbara all right welcome God bless you amen and any other visitors here for the first time oh God bless you welcome amen Daniel chapter 2 verse number 31 thou oh King sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part iron part of clay thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smot the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken into pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoke the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen take one more scripture in 2 Timothy chapter 3 they going back to what we spoke on last week's Sunday to continue There verse number one this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers over their own selves cetus boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers incontinent fears despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turned away for of this sort are they which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janis and jambus withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their Folly shall be made for their Folly shall be be manifest unto all men as theirs also was amen amen idolatry in the last days is what we titled this last week uh Sunday and we'll take that title again uh for our our sermon this morning let us pray one more time lord Jesus bless your word bless your people in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated now we started this message or looking into these quotations from as we were um uh from our special meetings we got into the stature of a perfect man and coming into Perfection and this Great Pyramid that we are to be um kept in place for the last day and then one day I was out here driving I was coming to the church here for some great reason during the week and I just remembered that there was a dream or something that had to do with brother brandom with eyes of fire so I went to look that up and it was a dream of brother Billy Paul and I took it that dream and and looked at it it's in the message there's a man could turn on the light and we uh played that didn't we here at the church and after we played it it was just a real awareness not that we know everything that the dream means but we know that church planing is over and the time to get ready is now so that we're not waiting for another something to happen to get us ready the getting ready time is now and brother random goes in that dream and he says that brother really Paul doesn't dream much he talks in his sleep but he had a dream that shook him up and in this dream he sees this Stone come out of the mountain that was cut without hands and it smites and I'll read the bottom part I didn't give this to the sister in the back but in paragraph uh 40142 brother brandham says this here and I motion to a big Granite Mountain light without hands cut a stone out of the mountain weighing hundreds of tons and here I come I said turn your heads don't look it'll all be over just in a few minutes said then a great holy hush come over everywhere as this Stone comes towards this place it may be later than we think there see that's exactly scriptural you see the stone without hands cut out of the mountain and so one of these days is going to be that way when you're going to scream for something and I said to them you've already had that time God has constantly warned you time after time yeah I said even if it's my own kid or whoever it is the hour is here I can only say what he's told me to say it'll be there and it was and so we just read that scripture it's Daniel chapter 2 and brother bam shares with us and shows us that Daniel saw the beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation not of the Jews but of the Gentiles how their time and the governments came into power and came into being and just to get going in this message I want to read a few quotes on what's happening right now as brother banham will show us that uh the time the things that we see ought to cause us to look into the word and not so much the news outlets and hearing this one and that one but the word has the answer to what's going on today and here in the message um the time is at hand paragraph 17 and the time every fellow has to come to a time where you make a decision there's got to be a time where you make your decision of whether you're going to be married or not then the decision that you and your girlfriend have to to make whether you're going to live together or get married or not there's all kinds of decisions to be made in life and they'll linger long for a certain period Then a time comes where it's got to be settled that's the last time it's got to happen now one way or the other and Christian friend I believe that we're living in the end time that when all things that was written in the Bible it's time now for all all these things to come to pass and I believe that the very things that we see happening now is just exactly in season with God's word brother Adam continues in the message trying to do God a service without being its will being God's will paragraph 3:20 he says this God has promised his word how it would be fulfilled and how it would come to pass when he chose his bride how it would be done it's happening right before you in the name of the Lord and that's by the original word the evening time message is here can you say praise the Lord we'll take one more in this message uniting time and sign paragraph 99 the prophet of God says this here now you see but in the last days you see we see things happening now that has never happened before see it's God sign and all this uniting is a Time sign now we want to look at that carefully and be real sure what we get that we get it want to be real sure that we get it amen we'll take one more on this happening now and this is in the message One in a Million paragraph 12 he says the time and the hour that we're living if a person don't know which way to go what to do or how to turn you're not walking by faith anymore you're just guessing presuming and presume is to advance without official Authority so if we haven't got the real official authority to know what God Said would take place in this hour how are we ever going to face this hour and we've got to face it knowing by faith in his word that the things that's supposed to be happening now and the condition and the Nations the condition of the people condition of the church and so forth we've got to know that and then how to walk out to face it if you don't know how to do that you're just what we call kind of haphazardly just jump in hoping it'll be here hoping this and hoping that and will it be but God don't want us to do that he wants us to know what he has said about this day then meet it by faith because he said it would be that way then we know uh we know your truth then because you haven't got some person's word for it you got his word what we must do and we're hoping that our heavenly father will grant this to us this week man it's so nice how brother random lays that out that this it's happening right before you that the evening time message is here and that this this time that he wants us to know of what day that we're living in and so the the the point is that we are seeing things take place and transpire that we have never seen before for I just read it for you there's things that are taking place in politics and in churches and in communities and in families and things that are going on that we have never seen before and if you put on your radio everybody has their version of the answer but God never sent a news Outlet to tell me how to prepare my heart for the hour that we're living in there's things that take place that I can't explain but I know how to stand and walking by faith isn't walking in a realm that you don't know what's going on walking by faith is not presuming that's right walking by faith is say well I'm walking by faith I don't know what's going on I don't know how this is going to happen I don't know what's going to work out that's not walking by faith walking by faith is knowing where you stand knowing that this this is The Hour That was supposed to be here and everything that happens out there the word already told us it was coming and the things that we haven't seen yet because there's things possibly that we have never seen take place begin here in 2024 and so what do we do we need to know what's said in this word about this day and know what the expectations our expectations of the day should be so first we see everything happening and I'll lay that Foundation now that whatever we see going on the word has an answer for it secondly once we know what the word said for our day then we stay behind that word and that's our expectation we expect it to get worse we expect it to get crazier we expect it to be more unex explainable I mean there's friends there's relationships there are churches that simply changed overnight right before our eyes Christian people worldly people political people right before our eyes it's actually changing so fast it used to be there be a certain movement come every five six years and now it's like every year there's another level and another level and another level and people calling you and getting you online and pulling you this way come over here and do this church this way this is how we Church you need to church the way we church but once we know the word we know the expectation of the day and then finally we need to meet that challenge by faith and so this um idolatry in the last day will go into this just for a moment how in the last days which we are in those last days the prophet of God tells us there is a beginning and the ending of the Gentile dispensation so he takes the message the mark of the beast and I trust you pray with me this morning how I know you pray with me is when I get an amen every now and then just one or two paragraph 163 in the message the mark of the Beast brother brandom says this notice King Nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back Yonder when the Gentile age was issued in let's watch how it come in and the way it come in you'll find out it goes out the same way we know that there is a beginning of time of Grace for the Gentiles and a ending of time is that right now watch King Nebuchadnezzar when Daniel sent down the there a smart Prophet when all the rest of the Jews had kind of humbled down and was bowing to the Romans or to the Babylonians but there was three four men three Shadrach Meek and abendigo and Daniel who purpos in their heart that they would serve God and when they throw Shadrach and so forth in and Daniel had to become a great man and he had become a great man and before King Nebuchadnezzar and basar and so forth when he become a great man now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made a image of gold and set it out out in the field and said that everybody would have to bow to that image did you ever notice the innocence of it who that image was made of it was Daniel the image of a man and didn't he say the spirits of the Gods the Heathen as they are today got three or four of them the spirits of the God lived in him so brother bam is telling us that these boys who were believers who knew Daniel and Daniel was a prophet for sure and these boys who were commanded to worship only one God come to attest a time and their experience where they were forced to worship this image and a holy image the image of a holy man A Gifted Man a man that they knew and they did not fail the test they stayed with the original word brother Banner continues in the message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation and he says this in paragraph number four Daniel was the prophet that was carried from Jerusalem down into Babylon and carrying away of the Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar he was a young fellow when he went down into Babylon there's not many of them that had still uh holding on the grand old faith I like Daniel because he had purpose that in his heart when he went down into Babylon that he was going to remain a Believer and he wasn't going to defile himself with the king's meat and so forth now the very thing that Daniel was the prophet to the Gentiles Daniel saw all the Gentile age rise and fall he was the first one he's called the Gentile prophet he wasn't a gentile himself but he saw the Gentile dispensation from start to finish the head of gold and ending up in the feet of iron and clay and while down in there purposing in his heart that he wouldn't defile himself with the king's meat with the king's Affair another group of brothers named Shadrach meach and abendigo went down there which was not prophets but Believers and they also purpose in their heart and then when those four Believers come together I'd imagine quite oftenly they had prayer meetings together just like we do we get together because we have things in common you know there's an old slogan birds of a feather flock together and that old proverb rather and that's a pretty good thing too birds of a feather flock together aren't you happy of that brother ROM continues on in that same message message I'll drop down paragraph number 19 and we saw the vision the head of gold the breast here of silver the thighs of brass notice each kingdom got little harder King Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was a head of gold he interpreted it told him just exactly how those kingdoms would succeed each other until the end and then notice from gold is the softest silver is NE next then brass is next then iron is next harder harder colder further away notice then the midst of all of that Daniel beheld the image until the stone was hued out of the mountain that was cut out without hands that rolled into the image and broke it and made it like wheat on the summer thrashing floor and the Wind Drive away and the stone grew into a great Mountain that covered all the earth and the sea that was the coming of the Lord Jesus which is now at hand so brother randam identifies that the coming of the Lord and that stone would replace those kingdoms he continues on in this message I have to make this point in paragraph 25 and beginning and ending of Gentile dispensation he says this here cuz King Nebuchadnezzar had called him basar he I'll go up he said he saw the end time coming he saw the Gentile starts and if you notice the Gentiles started off with an idol worship they was worshiping a great Idol setting out in the field an idol of a man I believe Daniel himself cuz King Nebuchadnezzar called him basar which was his God he started worshiping an image of a righteous a holy man and Daniel refused to do it so did the Hebrew children Shadrach meach and avendo and that was and that's the way it was issued in and it was condemned the head of gold was issued in by image worship Force to it and ended up in a supernatural hand writing a supernatural language that only Supernatural understanding could understand it amen that's the way the Gentile Kingdom issued in and it'll go out the same way so we see that what the Temptation came for those Believers was for them to Bow Down and Worship this image of their friend and brother who was the prophet now not just one place I have a string of maybe seven or eight of where brother vam makes that comparison the image of a holy man he said he believes that it was Daniel so you put your s in those believer shoes and see what the the the the the pressure was and we dealt with this in the message um and the brother brandom preached on the bruised Serpent and he says that there was an element of Believers in his church that made him the anointed Christ the Incarnate Christ and he had to deal with it he corrected it but he gave us the reason why they did that and the reason reason why they did that is found in Luke 3:1 15 he said he went to the Lord about it and the Lord referred to him the scripture that they did the same thing that John and the reason why they saw John as Christ or started to confuse him because it had been so long that they hadn't had a prophet so could you imagine us Gentiles we never had one right so you can imagine that element to be there but there's a reason why it was there we we didn't know where to place this we didn't know how to handle it it's too much like God it must be God so maybe he is God and so in Luke 3 verse 15 the prophet says that the Lord directed him to that scripture I'll read it for you quickly I you Mark Luke John 3:15 all right and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not so in dealing with this brother Bram brings out the these two uh uh uh let's let's call them two sides of the road if you would you have this group of people who were actually amused so much with John's Ministry that that he has to be the Christ the Bible says so the angel of the Lord quickens this to brother brandom this is why this is happening it's still Antichrist it's still wrong but now we know why they did it they did it because we didn't know where else to place it it's too much I mean nor are the pastor I know was ever accused of being the Lord Jesus Christ sir I was never accused of such I was accused of many things never accused of that it's really an honor it's really you got to be doing something pretty good for somebody to want to baptize in your name y'all ain't saying nothing it's the truth but it's like it's so Antichrist what does Antichrist mean it means anti- word it's against the word but there's a reason for it that's one the other side is in Matthew Chapter 13 it's in the message um the seed is um it's in uh it's in the message the seed of discrepancy Matthew Chapter 13 and brother random says this here in the seed of discrepancy paragraph number 30 this is the other side he says when a man stands and says he's a gospel preacher and says that the days of Miracles is pass that's the seed of discrepancy when a man stands and says that he's a minister a pastor of a church or somewhere and he does not believe that Jesus Christ is the same in every detail except the physical body same yesterday today day and forever you read it that's the seed of what discrepancy when he says that miracles in the apostolic age pass that's the seed of discrepancy when they say there's no such a thing as Divine Healing so we see this element is it was there it's still around it's still there can I go a little bit further in questions and answers in 1964 and question number 329 a sister writes this question in and says this here this is in 1964 people are saying brother brandham is more than a man he can create and Jesus can look just like brother brandom now let me the person said this whoever it might be I don't know but I am your brother see Jesus is your savior I cannot be your savior for he has already saved you can I get an amen amen now you're so close to being the truth there what and yet so far from the truth the person that told this person this now it's just looks to me like a woman's handri very beautiful handwriting and I say that was a woman's handwright wouldn't you say brother caps wouldn't you think that was a woman's handwright pretty handwright I don't know who it is but if it was me I would be proud that he's complimenting my handwriting right he's getting into the handwriting now brother brandom could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is Antichrist so if you run off on either end you're going to go wrong because in one sense yes but in another sense no so it's like over here over here which way go left no go right no go left no go right what side is it exactly the truth another sense of the word is Antichrist that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him is exactly the truth and you become Christ you remember my message on Messiah the word Messiah means the anointed one now you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one see then there's all kinds of anointed ones so this is a tremendous question it's a element that goes on it's a an element that exists um the prophet of God tells us why it exists it's scriptual it existed with John it ex it exists in this ministry here and it's it's so close to the truth and it's and it's off to but if you don't believe it come in every detail except the physical Corporal body that's the seed of discrepancy you see and so this element of the last day those are some of the things that we would see the Bible tells us that knowing the last days these times would come Jesus told us in Matthew 24 so that you wouldn't be alarmed in your heart these things are pestilence Wars uh men lovers of themselves uh uh truce Breakers you don't have any Faithful Friends anymore everybody's willing to stab their back on you nobody they'll talk about you before they call you they'll rum it they'll pass it along and then they'll check the facts later you know what I'm talking about and it's true and we see that increasing and increasing the love of many waxing cold and then the prophet of God brings in this element of the Janice and the jambus that their Folly would be made known so I just want to take a moment or two and look at Exodus chapter 7 I believe it was that Janice and jambers come on the scene it is here that that that that in the book of Timothy the Apostle Paul now says as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these men of reprobate Minds confir concerning the truth they resist the truth truth I think I took those notes out yeah in Exodus chapter 7 in verse 11 we read it for you last time this is what the scripture is referring to when Moses was called of God to go down and let my people go and Moses takes his staff in his arm in his hand and he has these two signs that were given to him to go down and and really change is of course Moses we want you to do something that has never been done before you you don't have some contemporaries that you can run this by you don't have a pattern of friends or other prophets or preachers that you can check this with to make sure it's balanced this is going to be the first time it ever I want you to go down and let my people go I want you to go down to Pharaoh I'm not talking about sneaking them out I'm talking about going to the head man of the the whole operation and and and we you don't have no Army you don't have you don't you don't have no weapons of warfare you know how bad they are you know how tough they are but I want you to go down and tell them that the God who has no name has sent you to to let my people go that's a strong proposition but the pillar fire comes to him the Pillar of Fire makes himself known to him and I'll say this when when God makes himself known to you you will be Fearless too you do some stuff that's crazy you'll stand up and you'll testify if you came in contact with God you can't hold your peace no more you got to tell it it's like fire shut up in your bones Jeremiah said he goes down there he has has the message of Deliverance he has the word of the Lord he has the signs he has the Wonders and he goes down there he says Let My People Go he says by what who's who's god well this is my God he throws his rod down and when he throws his rod down didn't even Flex Pharaoh didn't even Flinch that's right he said Reverend jamus Reverend uh uh Janice or magician whatever they call them enchanters come come and they throw their rods down too brother bam says that Moses never moved he never went back to check the quotes and make sure his quotes was right and everything was right no he stayed right there God told me to do this what they doing the Lord didn't tell me they was going to do this but I'm here I'm called to stand here you're going to see something that you've never seen before but stay with the word because this has been Vindicated and I'll stand by my word he throws his rod down they throw their rod down and becomes a serpent cheap magician trick fa you come in here with this enchantments we've been doing this for centuries you playing games with us you got to come deeper than that Moses just sat there and waake what they doing what's going on somebody hungry huh one of the snakes eats up one and then he eats up the other one and then Moses goes down and grabs that rod and when this takes place Janice and jambus still continued in their Ministry Pharaoh's heart was hardened because now his men can do what Moses did the Second Great Miracle comes about and that's in Exodus 7 and verse 22 Moses comes back I think it was 7 days later and he takes his rod and he puts it into the water and calls for blood and blood comes and when the blood came Janice and Chambers did the same thing these were devils and they were anointed Devils but you're the audience watching it all play out they both got powers they both doing what they said they was going to do they both are anointed but you got to stay with the calling that God give to you because the word of the Lord Satan can't stay with all of it because the word is like this it's like the the eagle's wings every verse every chapter takes you up higher and it goes Higher and Higher and only Eagles can fly with eagles and so Janice and jam did the same thing the LI come pardon me the frogs come Janice and jambus did the same thing so this these Miracles between Janice and jambus against Moses is causing now Pharaoh's heart to harden and you say to yourself why God why don't you just explode Janice and jambus off the face of the Earth why don't you just make their powers not work you know we we see these people on the internet you you you punching the name uh brother brandom it's not all believers on there it's not people that's trying to tell you the truth it's all kind of he like why would these people lie the way they lie he say Lord how do you let them continue on why don't you blow them up or explode them or give me the power to explode them give us the power to wipe them off you're not a Believer out of here boom and but God doesn't do that does he he allows it to continue he makes it almost it's almost confusing if you're watching it play out how can these wicked men prosper and God allows them to prosper because that heart has to harden and it's the heart that needs to and the cup of the iniquity needs to fill up greater and greater so judgment can come so brother bandam deals with this in the message anointed ones at the end time and he says this here paragraph 148 notice they did the same Miracles notice they did it they they didn't do it till after the original word went forth is in the message anointed once at the end time paragraph 148 that's the way Satan done in the Garden of Eden that's the way he done it all the time who prophesied first Moses who come on the scene first Moses or balam Moses who come on the scene first Jeremiah or hananiah you see it paragraph 150 pharaoh denomination says we have man that can do the same thing and they did they did it see why did Pharaoh do this why did God permit it why would God send a true anointed Prophet down there to perform a sign before pharaoh and then let a denominational copy come around and copy it before the people why would he let an impostor rise up to do it and do the same thing exactly the genuine spirit of God done see the scripture must be fulfilled notice he did this so that he would Harden the heart of pharaoh and the Egyptians to prove that Moses wasn't the only one that had the word they could do everything just the same as Moses could do and why did God let this thing happen in the last day so the same thing as the liyon spirit said to zedekiah how can we get Ahab out there to make these things come to pass how is he going to get these people trusting in their churches to get out here to come to this thing to come to pass that he predicted they in the late oan Church age because thou sayest thou are rich and have need of nothing and set as a queen why did he let this impersonation rise up in the last days paragraph 152 when these things are coming to pass by the true word of God and let impersonators come up and do the same thing and then to deny the true word of God he did it for Moses and Pharaoh did it against Moses and those Janis and jambers did it against Moses and the Bible says that it will repeat again in the last days here we are now if that ain't scripture fulfilled where is it at did Moses fet them say here here you can't do that I'm the only one been ordained to do that here you stop that right now he just let him go let them go remember the Bible says as their fol was made manifest so will these in the last days be made manifest when the bride is raptured and taken into the sky hallelujah thank you Lord Moses the true manifested word never said nothing just let it go but he did that so he could Harden the heart of pharaoh deceive Pharaoh he did that very same thing so he could deceive Ahab and the only one little guy standing there himself Little M Micah telling them thus sayith the Lord here stood another one anointed thus sayth the Lord and contrary one to another so God allows it doesn't he you know God hardened Hitler's heart hardened miscellanies heart hardened the rest of the world's heart the rest of the world act like they didn't know what was going on in Germany but we still had our Olympic Games going on we we want to make sure we got that in there and people went over there and warned us and warned the other nations what Adolf Hitler was doing he was Rising into power and we act like it wasn't even going on I mean these people over here crying and losing their entire life everything been taken from them without any law or Justice to cry to no police to call no court to run the case and hear others around the world act like they didn't see the Jews going through this trouble because we ain't Jews but wait they're coming for you too and it act like it wasn't happening but God hardened the heart these are his children he hardened the heart of Hitler hardened the heart of melini and he he let this heart get so hard and hateful towards the Jews they persecuted them pushed them out they ran for their lives they hid like animals and they all went back to the promised land and he did that so he can get them to the promised land he did that so he can get them into position where he wanted them and God allows the same thing for us God allowed job to go through his test without even giving him a coherent reason as to why that's a tremendous question why do I have to suffer or why is things going wrong for me why are things turning out this way why I don't have the friends that I should have or why didn't I didn't prosper in my business like I wanted to why is my Ministry failing why and job asked that question and Believers asked that question question and you don't have the answer sir come on somebody why why why why but job had a sacrifice didn't he he had enough to know where to stand he had enough to know what the word said about his sacrifice and then he could meet the challenge of his test because he did what God Said to do praise God Amen that's the same with you and I today amen why what are these things going on why it seem so Victory all in politics right everybody got a gun ready to blow somebody's head off step on my lawn ring my doorbell I don't know you ready just ready and know you got a gun you don't you don't you don't sharpen your skills to negotiate iate when you got a gun when you ain't got no gun you learn how to talk brother like wait wait hold up hold up let's think about this let's talk about this talk this through you can talk a man down when you ain't got no gun but when you got a gun you don't your IQ you don't need people's skills if you can cut somebody's head off God help us that's hour we're living in and things are taking place now we have never seen happen I mean you used to be able to call a few pastors and run a few things by them but they don't answer their calls anymore because they going through something too shaking down yes shaking down but thank God we got the word the word in your Revelation is the word is what's going to save your life Glory that'll keep food on your table that'll keep your faith stable that'll keep you with your fire on this word excited about it praising God through the midst of all the craziness and the foolishness amen amen take my friends take my fellowship take my open doors but Lord don't take my praise don't take my Revelation don't take my dance away from me God give me my praise and let me keep it until the coming of the Lord hallelujah praise His name so we can see this everything we see happening God's word said it would be here we see it things we've never seen before God's word identified that would be here and then now that we know this we expect it to be that way can I take one scripture as I close time is it yeah Genesis quickly Genesis chapter 13 15 sorry remember that covid year huh pretty tough wasn't it what if something comes that's worse than that what shouldn't we even be expecting something worse it's like we some some people love crazy they love dysfunction they love a good oh something crazy tell me about it we're waiting for crazy to happen we looking for it you want things to get better the news out there wanted to get better but Believers is like let it happen Lord let something strike here to shake this thing up make us all question ourselves and find the altar again and repent over again and maybe get re-baptized if I have to whatever it takes amen Genesis chapter 15 quickly this is the promise being revealed to Abraham before his name is changed and the Lord is confirming this promise to him he puts Abraham to sleep and shows him a vision with this uh hepher he brings a sacrifice and he he brings his the hepher of three years old the she goat three years old and uh the ram of three years old and the turtle dove and the young pigeon he took them unto all of these and divided them in the mid verse 10 and laid each piece against one another but the birds divided he not verse 11 and when the fouls came down upon the carcass Abram Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and L A horror a great Darkness fell upon him and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in the land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years this is before Jacob this is before Joseph this is before all the years of plenty this is before Pharaoh's dream this is before we Egypt gets fat all of this God already showed it to Abram verse 14 and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterwards shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy father fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation what they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full so this is right in line with the hardening of Pharaoh's heart the iniquity has to be at a certain level before God can do what he said he was going to do I mean it's not so it's not it's filthy but it's not filthy enough it's crazy but it needs to get crazier we had two or three pastors that was in it for 40 years backslide we need three or four more of those big names following the word following the message it's not enough we need we need we need the iniquity to arise we need the unbelief to rise and these people continue on and they rise and God allows it and the True Believer knows and expect it to be there and the false believer their hearts Harden more Harden more more resentful more uh combative more disagreeable here more people leaving the message than ever before it seems it seems I've only been around for 30 Years or or more something like that I've seen a few things some of you have been in it all your life you've seen a few things I've never seen it like this it's like it's like everything is being reinterpreted or that used to mean that but they don't mean that no more they keep changing the rules of the game we used to be able to say Amen because we heard what he said but we ain't hearing the same thing no more tremendous but God said that would be here so that the iniquity and the cup has to get Fuller and Fuller and fully but there Folly will be made known now how does this Folly become made known the Folly is made known by our stand on the word remember Janice and jambus they stood through those first three little tests the rod with the serpent the blood in the water and the frogs they couldn't take them away but when it came to the lice and the other things they had to step back they actually said out of their mouth this they told Pharaoh this is the Finger of God it's like what in the beginning we right with him oh we can do that next man oh we can do that this is the Finger of God and that's what the word will do if you stay with that word my brother my sister you don't have to be the most talented you don't have to have the mic in your hand every serice everybody don't even have to even know you even exist all you got to do is find a portion of God's word and hold on to it until he calls you home hold on hold on until he calls you [Applause] home Lord and that's what I'm trying to do this morning I'm trying to hold on until he calls me home their Folly will be made manifest can I take 10 more minutes it's not even 12:00 yet okay Saints the God of this evil age brother bandam says this in paragraph 174 see trying to keep you from seeing the real meaning of the word see he's interpreting it saying it means this God said I promised in the last days I send you Malachi 4 it don't have to be interpreted he did it he said as it was in the days of lot the world will be in solom condition and in that time I will reveal the son of man by it exactly we got all kinds of impersonations everything else of it but we got the real one too see he said he would do it he said the Antichrist would rise up and almost deceive the elected if it was possible but said let them alone let them go ahead their Folly will be found out why the word test proves it thank you Lord the word test when it comes to that word that had been backed this way and that oh I don't believe in serpy I don't believe in this that and here brother it's never been revealed see no never oh brother just look where you're we're going to have to close and he continues on Hallelujah yes their Folly will be made manifest because the word test proves it now Satan cannot stay with the word word by word cannot do it he can impersonate any kind of a gift but he can't stay with the word hallelujah Monday Tuesday and Wednesday he can make the Sunday morning uh jelly donut service free coffee meeting he can make that one but church again on Wednesday how many times y'all going to meet and then Sunday night again and what y'all doing washing feet for what you don't need to wash one another's feet that was back in Jesus's time sir but Jesus said if you do it happy you'll be and so many people ain't happy the ones that ain't happy ask them are you washing the Saints feet ask them I got the Bible for it happy are you if you do these things talk about Happy Feet yes happy are you if you do these things that's what Jesus said I can't figure it out that's what he said Christ is revealed in his own word today so confused about the evidence of the Holy Ghost paragraph 27 Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift that God has got but he cannot bring that word word by word and when we're talking about the word we're talking about this word word and we're talking about this word which includes the dreams and the visions and the hunting trips and all of it I mean we we take it all word by word brother Israel that was before 47 or no it was after 63 whatever what year was he a prophet again somebody help me what year was he a prophet pick up your Bible it'll tell you in the days I will send my Prophet to turn your heart from what you was believing to the original faith of the Saints behold I send unto you Elijah who the prophet before that great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He will turn your hearts to that original faith and so we stay with the word amen we stay with it word by word all of the Visions all of the hunting trips even the manuscripts that the smart people say don't exist they've changing your Bible all the time but we stay with it word word by word what version Bible do you use the same one that God used when he was here in flesh and he spoke to us his message the King James version you got a problem with that I don't but the great minds they got a problem with that they they that the ESV is the one we want to use now or the living Bible That's the only one they're good good works no criticism against them I read from them thank God for them they're enlightening they use the English language open things up open my understanding but God gave us his word it's King James virgin what's wrong with that what the scholars and the doctors says that's not the correct correct version well when they get one of these pictures they can start talking to me if they don't get one of these here then that's not where I'm going and that's not being a smart Al that's just being like I don't know a giraffe in the days of Noah that got on the ark or a mouse or whatever animal that got on the ark what intelligence did they use to get on the ark and Men grown men educated men couldn't see Noah's message no matter how smart I am or you are anybody else are you in the ark are you in the word of the Lord it's a higher level than what we want to think it is there's no mistakes in this word it's a perfect Bible is actually perfect be careful be careful about this they there's some straight up inconsistencies based on who first of all your sticky dirty hands trying to look for a mistake in it you've contaminated it while you're trying to look for it the mistake is in you God sent his word and God watched over his word and if there was anything that needed to be corrected God would have corrected it himself so I can take confidence in my Bible you listen to them Scholars out there they'll have you disbelieve in your Bible it's not all true it's true Saints it will you listen to some people they'll have you not believ in all of the message even the church age book oh yes I'm there now I might as well say it they got a problem some got a problem with the church age book and I came into the message you know the first thing I read was a church age book it got a hold of me brother Ike I actually believed it and I kept going on kept moving on with the Lord and then somebody told me a few years later a year or two later that rever so and so said that brother so and so said that brother bam said to bur him there's lel's book somebody said that and so I had my church age book but I was like ah yeah but maybe and I did that for a couple of years and finally I said you know Israel go to and see what brother brandham said about the church so I did I went in looking what he said about the church a book and guess what guess whose book it is H that's what he said so in order for me to change that position I'd have to listen to somebody else and I'm not willing to do that thank the Lord thank the Lord oh my amen don't you love the Lord we know where to stand don't we we know these things that are happening God said it in his word that it would be there we know that these things are supposed to to be here so we expect him to be here and then also we know how to meet this day and these challenges with faith we meet the day with the word of the day and we stay steady with the word of the day and then Monday and Tuesday you might have not have the same friends and then Wednesday and Thursday the crowd changes again and then Friday and Saturday some might come back some might change their mind we don't know do we but when Jesus calls us home I want to be right in this word waiting on the coming of the Lord their Folly will be made manifest I want to finish this last quote here this last part of this message as the Lord prophesied to Abraham and told him that in the fourth generation this would take place so in Souls that are in prison now brother random deals with this in paragraph 308 and he says this here again also in Genesis 15:16 if you want to put it down he told Abraham over in the land of the amorites their iniquity they were Gentiles now I can't take you in there right now cuz the iniquity of the amorites the Gentiles is not foled up yet but I will judge them I'll come in that fourth generation then I'll judge that Nation with a rod of iron is that right has it been so long that God's longsuffering the ministry constantly through tape and everything else has combed across the world to see if there is one more but maybe the last one come in just recently has it been the iniquity that's been so long if Jesus is the same which he Hebrews 138 his message must be the same same his action must be the same if the first and second pool is without question is there a question in your mind about the first and second pool did it come to pass just like he said congregation says yes says amen then why question the third why would you question it well because somebody online said that somebody online said that somebody on the internet said put it down Saints just let it go let them continue why would you question it the first two was identified by the scripture I Pro I proved it to you this morning that the third is identified by the scripture too look upon the world see where she's at look how they have rejected the truth and how it's been properly identified The Prophecy part now where are we at oh God be merciful that makes my heart bleed on the inside what about it where we at amen he deals with this fourth generation in the church age book my last quote here he says in the Ephesian Church age he says Revelations 2:4 this message is is to the entire age which lasted about 120 years its message then is to all generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only to see the fires fading in the next in the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatsoever of that original flame then God lights the fire again and the same process is repeated it is simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than that there's truth to the apostolic seccession it isn't in the word you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they are no longer just plain Christians but they have taken the denominational name or now B apst Methodist Etc that is exactly what they are too they are not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these folks are all coming together now by the will of man I don't say that some of them aren't right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore so our desire our prayer is Lord light the fire again light it up in my soul again keep this word the expectation of the word on fire so I can meet the challenge of this day by faith I know the iniquity the cup of the amorites has to fill up has to get more sinful more wicked more horrible great Ministries fall it's got to be that way I actually expected to be be that way but now my faith is now anchored in the word and I desire for another outpouring of the Holy Spirit you know we rarely hear that in our prayers anymore Lord send us Revival in The Message Church it seems quite odd vernacular to say Lord send this church a Revival but we need a Revival and if we don't need one I need one one and that's the way it is I need a Revival to get me out of here for the coming of the Lord for the Rapture for the resurrection God help us amen don't be afraid to pray that prayer my brother and my sister Lord send me a Revival send me an outpouring a refreshing oh God let it happen today even God bless you let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word this morning thank you for your the opportunity you give us this little time slot to run for you a few heartbeats a few years of running for you and Lord we've we've been stalemated because of what some may think about us and pressures from this way way or that way maybe a family member or another group but oh Lord Jesus focus our eyes back on you again Lord let us see the hour and the time that we're in and as the hearts are hardening Lord we're becoming more pliable for the great move of God to take place in our life that's that's what we need need Lord that's what we desire oh God I pray that this word this message this ministry that you've called us to be the most important thing in our life everything else secondarily we be
