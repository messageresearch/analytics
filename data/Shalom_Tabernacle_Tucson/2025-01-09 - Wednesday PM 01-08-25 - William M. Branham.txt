we welcome all of our visitors and Friends amen we trust the the Lord Jesus will bless you uh tonight we have a portion of a tape um Revelations CH 4 verses 1-5 we'll read in the scripture and um this day in 1961 brother Brandon was concluding the church Age series and according to the voice of God website they said at the end of the service was when that Pillar of Fire came into the room and Drew out the uh Church ages on the back wall there it's a three-hour message we'll listen to a portion of it today but or this evening and if you want to go back and listen to you'll hear Brother bam in the service there's people being healed there's people shouting the Praises and he talks about a shadow appearing on there it's really a beautiful uh conclusion cuz he started that message in De December of 1960 12 or 13 sermons later it carries him over into the new year and he's wrapping up Revelations chapter 4 and he's going to go on a uh uh Evangelistic tour so he's kind of admonishing the church and uh has a small prayer line and then the Lord vindicates it all with this uh appearing there the pillar of fire and he speaks about it in this message here we would see Jesus paragraph number nine I'd like to read that to you they can get that for me he's um I believe he's in California he says now you know it's told us that the day when the Lord come it would be kind of unexpected and the church would be cooling off and I just got finished at my Tabernacle at home with the seven last Church ages and it's coming out it's on tape now and it's I took each Church age each night made the seven Church ages the seven last the candlesticks and the Seven messengers of the church ages and I of all I'm not much of a Preacher but all that I every effort I put forth for the Lord in all my life I don't believe ever was as effective as that was for as soon as I come down and not knowing what to draw these Church ages on the Blackboard showing just how much the Holy Spirit come in the Ephesus Church age and then on down to theuring and pergamus and the terror and on out and if that angel of the Lord that light had come right in before 300 people moved itself right over on the wall and draw with that round light just the way I draw the churches and showed exactly the same depths and everything as it went through while 300 people screaming and crying and looking at it on the side of the wall while it stood out here and reflected itself on the wall and made the same thing and they got it draw now on in pictures and it's standing in the Tabernacle Mr arganbright our dear precious brother has just left up there and went up to look at it where it was at on the wall amen praise the Lord so that's the me part of the message we're going to hear tonight I know it'll be a blessing to you let's take our Bibles and read because uh brother Ram kind of goes through the scriptures throughout and I just like you to maybe read it for yourself to get a context Revelations CH 4 veres 1-4 we'll read that amen and after these after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you the things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and he that sat was to look upon like Jasper and sardin stone and there was a rainbow about the throne in sight like unto emerald and around about The Throne there were four and 20 seats upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white rment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God Amen brother is going to go into that I think the portion of the message that we'll hear tonight will he will get into that so we trust the Lord to be a blessing to you amen let's sing only believe amen only believe only believe that all things are possible all only believe only believe only believe all things are possible oh can we lift our hands and say Lord I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe God bless you you may be seated brother Brenham thank you good morning of Bible class and how's everybody feeling this morning fine I hope amen we kind of this was kind of a short notice that we had of saying we be here this morning because of I didn't have the my itinerary made up yet I just when it would be leaving and uh this uh being now that it's made up for the next 6 months well then I thought we better have the service this morning because it'll be some time before I ever get back again as far as I know maybe this fall and um uh we'll be leaving now this coming week for uh over at bont Texas where we begin down there next week and go through about a eight or 10 days meeting there with the um uh Association of the the independence and different churches it's really sponsored by the U Jesus name churches down in bont Texas where we had the great meeting some time ago just right after this picture was taken and uh they I know they run a coach over there with probably 27 coach or train with 27 coaches on it coming over to the meeting at bont there's where the mayor of the Town had to parade and went through the streets and all of them had a great time at bont and we're returning back uh this next week and then was anticip ating San Anon but won't have enough time for it let on the return and we go from there to Phoenix Los Angeles down to Long Beach and and we come back the Lord willing go back to the east coast back up into Virginia and South Carolina come back then to Bloomington Illinois and from there to the Lane Tech High School last week in April Christian businessman and then I leave from there to go to Northern British Columbia up towards Alaska and be in there until June and then we're hoping to have a great time praying that at the investigation of I've been under for a while by uh income tax concerning the church here it'll be over by that time and then we'll I'll be able to go overseas then if it is right in June which should make it just right for Africa for June July and August and and Africa so I certainly need your prayers and we're looking for the coming of the Lord all these things are if it be the will of the Lord see amen we do not know he could these are not exactly leadings we just got all the invitations together and prayed over it asked the Lord which way should we go and and seem like then I don't leave it all up to my own self I'll let others think about it pray over and then seemed like it we all seem to feel led to go Westward South and West at this time so then we had invitations all around so we just started right down and first place fell on my heart was either uh bont or San Anton so we looked up we had invitations in both places and the um we called one in bont and Ben they had 42 churches in cooperation of the United Pentecostals and so forth we thought with the big Auditorium be better to give them about 10 days instead of giving five and five of each place I think if you centralize it like that it's better and there's a lot of of needy people around in bont and down through that oral part of Texas there and so we're expecting a great time in bman and now we never try to go over these big centers and big places but we try to go as the Lord will lead us to go no matter how little how big just so the Lord is leading now at any time he could give us a Macedonian call and we'd leave the feeld at any time for whatever he' called us to do anywhere and we sure have enjoyed this time of Fellowship around the word of God with you fine people I trust that you'll be faithful now and come to church and obey the teachings of the Bible through our Gallant brother here brother Neville which I highly recommend as a servant of the Lord God and moving on deeper and deeper with God and I'm so happy for that and the little church I bonish you in the name of the Lord Jesus to grow in the grace of God hold yourself steady and look towards Calvary all the time amen taking all the roots of bitterness out of your heart and soul that God might use you at any time if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful Satan is a slim slick as he can be see put it with the word of God and consult your pastor see and you find gifts and so forth creeping up in the church and the operation of these gifts before you let it go to operating and think first feel it pressing on your heart now the enem is real slick see and that's just what ter the churches the pieces every time is a true gift operated wrong see something God's trying to do and operated wrong it'll just it'll just simply not only hurt you but it'll tear the whole church up see consult it take it through and through the Bible then test it and see if it's God or not just keep testing it and trying see if it's perfect right down the line and right with the word then you're all right see as long as a word has said it would be here would operate this certain way stay right with it don't never get off no matter what anybody does how real it seems to be if it doesn't reflect in the scriptures from Genesis the revelations leave it alone amen don't take no chances we're in the last days when Satan is just deceiving as he can be forgive me if I try to take a place of a boss I'm no boss but I feel you like Paul said back to everybody's congregation mons you're the stars in my crown when I cross over over the land over on the other side down and meet you in that glorified condition I want you to stand there to shine like a stars in am and I I want you to be there I want to be there I remember in my vision when I seen the presence of the Lord or his people in that glorious land y I looked around I told them and they told me he would judge me first by the gospel that I preach I said just exactly the way Paul preached it and then millions of people screamed out we're resting on that see now I want it to be so and we are going to meet there someday and God never sent brother Neville and I to be bosses not at all we're just your brothers you see instructors in the gospel so let all work together and sometime if a if something operating has to be called or or said something about it called down or something on that order and the person that's got that gift rejects it just remember refuses it remember the gift wasn't right it wasn't God in the first place the spirit of God always is ready for correction sweet humble well see if it stands up and say I'll do it any how you know how sometime just remember arrogant Spirits are not of God see so why take a substitute when everything the whole Earth is filled with the glory of God you see real power of God why will we take a subtitute amen we're too late in the day now but remember the Bible said he come in like a just as Sly as he could be and deceive the very elected if possible thing and now sometimes we think we are the elected and I hope we are but let's just stay right straight with the Bible and then if everything is right with the scripture ordering the scripture bringing glory to God and the honor of the church and so forth then we know that it is of god because the Bible backs it up but just our Theory won't back it up it won't do no good it falls through so then if something has struck us no matter how real it seems if it's not right not scriptural get rid of it right now there's a real one waiting you see so pray now always and whatever you do pray for me pray for me go we're now striking the fields for the last times in my opinion we're now going and remember great things are taking place it's unknown amongst the world Jesus come lived died and sacrificed went back to glory and millions never even know nothing about it yeah it's not flowerly great big it's he came to his own see the he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit said to the churches not to the outside to the church amen it's the church that gets it shaking I used to think different from that the one day he spoke to me had me to go back in the word and think of how that the prophets all spoke of when John came said the high places will be made low and the Low Places made high and how the power of God would work know the all the mountains would skip like little Rams and the leaves would clap their hands well that looked like it something really was going to take place see and when it did what happened an old fell come out of the Wilderness probably beard grow all out an old piece of sheep skin wrapped around him there was no conveniences out there in the wilderness he been there since he 9 years old and he 30 then come walking out of the Wilderness stomping out preaching repentance standing mud to his knees probably on the banks of the jarden that's when the high places is made low and the Low Places made High see it's you have to have spiritual understanding remember God never did and never will on this Earth dwell in glamour he's against it he'll never the great messages will never be make great big so and so and so don't do that way his servants don't work in that manner his Glamour and glory is of above amen yesterday or two days ago going out to Kentucky up in Kentucky with my good friend brother Banks Woods there was a woman policeman standing out there and he said boy we better slow down and said she's rough and I said yeah that's right I said when a nation gets to a place where millions are employed and they have to take women make policemen and send them out there in cab drivers and things like that it's one of the great stains on our nation she's got just about as much business out there as uh is a rabbit's gotten a kid of Grease see it just it just just not a place and I said that used to bother me so bad but now I begin to remember why no wonder this is this is not our kingdom we're not of this world they you why don't women our women wear their their hair short and makeups and rock and rolls and all this stuff well people go to ordinary churches and things think that's all right why they they are Americans they are Americans got American Spirit we're not Americans we're Christians we live our spirit is of another kingdom if our spirit was of this Kingdom then we would worship with these things and would worship all these vulgar songs and worship all this rock and roll wherever your heart is there your Treasures is and our Treasures is above so therefore we're going to a kingdom this is not our home we're just sojourning here trying to bring other citizens out of the darkness and go into a city and maybe hold a Citywide campaign just plow away for a week or 10 days for one precious soul out there one amen just one sitting out there you might say the meeting was a great success 5,000 came to the altar it might not be one of them saved not a one of them see and there might be you might think only two people can't all but one of them might be a jewel we just singing in the creek God picks out the fish he knows which is fish and which is not so see we're just preaching and remember you're doing the same thing in this Tabernacle but remember always this my sheep know my voice and the voice of God is his word I was thinking other day how these people says that there never was certain denomination churches saying Divine Healing wasn't right never was nobody given a gift of Divine Healing but St Paul or the apostles the 12 in the upper room is giving the gift of Divine Healing that was all that settled it but you see through this wonderful chart the brother Willie over here so marvelously fixed up for us that little thread has been through the churches all the way I wonder what that same denomination says about the history of the church about irenius about St Martin and all those Martyrs down through the age for hundreds of years after the death of the Apostles spoke in tongues and heal the sick and raised the dead and performed Miracles the whole church amen wonder what about them it was only through the apostles see how narrow it is they don't have spiritual understanding that's all blind dead and sin and trespasses sin means unbelief anything in unbelief is sin if a fell got a a title that long with DD L PhD lld D and says there's no such a thing as Divine Healing or baptism of the Holy Ghost a man dead in sin he might be able to explain all kinds of mysteries in the Bible but his very life his testimony proves that he's dead he's dead in sin and trespasses because he's a sinner sin is unbelief anybody sin isn't committing adultery and smoking cigarettes and dancing and carrying on like that that isn't sin that's the attributes of unbelief but a Believer no matter if a man don't drink don't smoke don't do these things never said a bad word keeps all the Ten Commandments he can still be a black sinner see this as rank as he can be if he denies anything of the power of God he's a sinner the word sin is unbel believe now you just fine and see if that's right or not an unbeliever in the word of God he is a sinner cannot enter the kingdom of heaven now oh I thought then this morning taking it up all myself by the will of the Lord by the Commandment of the Holy Spirit to come down to the Tabernacle again and maybe keep you all two or three hours but I want to finish the book of the fourth chapter of Revelations before go amen and now I hope it's not wearisome to you I hope it's it's glory to you I hope it's something that'll do you good and help you in the days ahead to come and now maybe I told Billy to come down here this morning and to give out prayer cards if there was any strangers in our midst because uh we'll be leaving and now I don't know when we'll be back God only knows that and I wanted thought maybe the last meeting if and when he called me up then about uh about 9:00 and said dad there's some people there to be prayed for I've asked them but said it's people that uh people that comes to church all the time I said then don't give out any prayer cards see I said because as people we have prayer for the six morning we call people up and pray for them but I said if it uh it's people that comes to Tabernacle that we no I want some stranger and he said then he come out there a few minutes ago when he met me stand out there said well I gave out some prayer cards said just a few in there I gave prayer cards out said you can do whatever you want to I said well we'll see how the message gets along see where we're at and then we'll go he said well many of the people wanted prayer cards of course but said they were people that's there in the church see well we know that God is God and M just the things does why they the phone rings all time of people of different things just little bitty things sometime and how God answers prayer amen I wonder if that little lady or her husband here from down in new Al they brought that little choked out baby the other night with pneumonia in my house about 12 1:00 fine how is the baby fine good all right just let me show you see it's something that you wouldn't know going to go on when the Holy Spirit speaks Fred sofman our precious brother Fred I heard him say Amen a while ago but I couldn't Place him out where's he at is he here here right here brother Fred Stopman know this show how simple it is he had some friends coming which is brother Welch Evans I presume I don't know they had a trailer there that locked the doors and Fred lost the keys and been looking everywhere and couldn't find them anywhere and brother Welch is coming right on up so the day come that he was to arrive and things he couldn't find the key anywhere so he just called called up home so brother BR where is the keys at where would we find him now that might stump some of you for a man to ask a question like that but wait just a minute remember the sons of Jesse looking for the mules so if I had a gift in my hand I'd take it down and ask give it to the prophet and maybe he'd tell us where those mules were remember that and while he's walking on the street they met the prophet he said you're looking for them mules said there you going back home and said they've already returned is that right I prayed Fred walked over and picked up the keys amen that's it see brother Ed Dalton where you at where's Ed Dalton I know he's here somewhere I seen him a while ago oh back in there he is you heard me through the inom or the public address system the other night A call came in and brother Ed was in serious trouble I want to help him nope said I just wants you to ask God I asked the Lord to help him and next day his wife called up somebody come to the Rescue all right that right brother man see he's just God that's all he's just God see just it's just all the time constantly from one place to another one place to another no matter what trouble it is he's God we don't go around brag about those things we're not supposed to just don't let the right hand or left hand know what the right hand's doing we talking among ourselves but we don't blast that out somewhere because that self- Pride like God only could do it for one person he' do it for anybody it'll believing it's belief Faith whatever whatever you want to do whatever your thoughts are take it to God he he he he provides everything isn't that right so he answers prayer he's a God is a prayer answering father amen now so therefore in I thought closing in this last meetings and so forth as we were as we're doing we would we would have maybe some of the discernment at the last of the meeting if the Lord willing and maybe during the time of the meeting we just don't know what he's going to do I like it that way don't set no certain things just let him do as he wants to do now get the fourth chapter of the Book of Revelations and off the clock amen yes yes [Music] brother certainly I believe that absolutely believe here brother Welsh Evans I think that's him sitting right back there let me while we're turning to Revelations 4 you're not long ago you all heard and read in the papers about this band and loable it steals these cars takes them down to Kentucky somewhere real quick and in Kentucky you don't even have to have a tile they'll make you one in Kentucky so you just the only thing have to say want and sell it so they'll take these cars and run them in and repain them again and bring those cars out and sell them all you have to have is your number your block and they'll make you a title so they just take a car off the street get it off real quick and run to some shop somewhere just change the whole thing over all together see and um and uh repaint it and everything take it out and sell it there's a racket of it and especially all over the United States and a great great of it in Kentucky I read an article in paper here not long ago about it well big good-hearted precious brother Evans and his family driving all the way from Mak Georgia up here every Sunday to hear the gospel oh how loyal and what real friends then he goes over to Miller's cafeteria where I'm not plugging for Millers but I certainly think that they got the best food in Kentucky Louisville Kentucky anyhow as far i a mean you private homes I've eat in over there now I mean for you know outside and um I eat over there too I can feed my family there cheaper and I can feed them at home that's right so then I go in over there and so brother Evans he goes in and he gets him something to eat and Parks his car out there when he comes out with all all his clothes the family and all them he didn't have no car or nothing it was all gone well poor fell brother Evans is a man like all of us he has a little business down there he works on cars buys wrecks and picks them up he's a poor man spends his money coming up here because he believes in this type of gospel I'm praying that God will send him a messenger down there somewhere to help him down in that country now brother Evans come up so he didn't what to do he notified police they couldn't find it so he come over home he and brother Fred and then we sat in the room and talked about I said now that's the way we do we sit in the room find out what takes place then we go to God so when we ask the Lord to turn the man that had the car turn him around and send him back wherever he was usually they run him down around Bolden green or somewhere get him around out of the hot spot here you see so they could till they get them repainted and fix up this is a nice car I think station wagon was that right brother Evans is a a station wagon so um and so what happened we got on and prayed and Lord give us witness it's all all right everything fine so then the power of the Lord came in with us brother Evans goes out and starts out led to go down a certain way and come back right here in Jeffersonville the car stole the little here said his car sitting there with just about enough gas need to take it all out of it to TU it down to about prary bold and green and come back they got out of the car stopped the car left the key it just walked away and left it sitting there right here in Jeffersonville where you can find it not Louisville over here in Jeff brought all the way back you know Lord can make Birds obey him he make man obey him he can make his enemy obey him there he's God here said his car not one thing gone just about a half a tank of gasoline where almost got the Bowling Green the Holy Spirit must have said turn around get on back there and take that car jonville set it right here on the street and park it right here CUA him would have sent him right around this way and up this way to find it is that right brother well right he's God he answers prayer brother Roy he just that's brother Slaughter that's just the same thing he heals your little doggy and I know that he heals he answers prayer he still performs Miracles he's still God he always was God he always will be God Amen he's God on the housetop what is that brother say church God in the kitchen God on the farm God in the automobile he's God everywhere he's God all all through and through God Amen oh how wonderful we get to preach next while I'm never get into this lesson all right let's bow our heads just a moment for prayer gracious Heavenly Father we are so fond of your holy word till our hearts just burn within us when we know that your spirit it comes down in the midst of us and there speaks to us and our hearts reach out and take a hold of it and we just seem to feel so good over it Lord and to know that in this dark hour where there's so much confusion like the prophet said in the last days there would come a famine something to this order not for bread and for water but for the hearing of the true word of God and man would travel from east to the west north and south seeking to find the true word of God word what is the word Jesus is the word the word was made flesh and dwelt among us to see the manifestation of the real word of God made manifest according to the scriptures and brought to pass that how people would travel and seek and would fail to find it oh God we are so glad so glad that we found him years ago precious to our heart and to see that we're not one bit confused oh God you said they that know their God shall do exploits in that day and here we are in the last days seeing all all the things that Jesus said would come to pass being made manifest right Among Us very signs wonders Miracles perform doing it just the way he did it as he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man and Lord you let us by the Holy Spirit reach out in that word and get those real things and time into Calvary by the word and see that in him we have the fullness and the riches and the blessings and the glory and all goes to him who is worthy that come tuck the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and set out on it himself for he was slain since the foundation of the world we speak of him this morning Father we pray that you'll bless our hearts let his Spirit move Among Us and bless us and enrich in our experience and heal the sickness in our midst and give us overcoming Grace God is to go out down in the field to face the F may I realize that I'm garrisoned every hour by prayer oh how I depend on that Garrison the enemy approaching but no that the Garrison holds because mother and fathers and boys and girls Christians born again with the experience heavenbound people is on their knees praying oh God give Deliverance father we pray that you'll let us get out into the Enemy Lines out Y and Conquer every precious Soul that's waiting Do Lord bring them out of Darkness into life far we ask it in Jesus name amen now in the fourth chapter of the Book of Revelations we ended up the third chapter and let us kind of be reverently and I'll try not to keep you too long but in this third chapter the church went up as a type when John was taken up the church went up and from that time on it's dealing with Israel until the coming again don't you see how it is the people today how they're great something going to shake the whole world and everything that's unscriptural no sir the next thing in order is the going of the church reading the church ages you see what now these other things is to take place is during the time of the wedding ceremony when the church is in glory god returns back with great wonders to perform International uh Miracles and Things by the Jews don't go to the church at all on the third chapter ends up the church age that's right in the church age goes out with such a little bitty minority that we find just listen here I I read this again this morning it just nearly tore me to Pieces the place and the attitude of Christ at the end of the church age found from the 21st to 22nd verse of Revelations 3 think of it Christ at the end where he's at where is at the end of the church AG outside his church pushed out by denominations Creeds what's his attitude trying to get back in that's a pitiful condition then we find out here after these things you heard a voes speaking to him the was it the spirit left the Earth after these things starts out the first chapter uh of the first verse after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven Revelations 41 after the church was gone then a a door was open and we went through all that and founded that was Christ was the door and the same voice that was walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks also was the same voice he heard in heaven saying come up hither John went up that represented the church going in the Rapture John went up in the spirit was tuck away into heaven and foresaw all the things that God promised and said to the disciples what is it to you if he teres till I come he saw the coming of of the Lord and what would take place he saw on Earth what would take place on Earth to the Rapture of the church was taken up and show come on down even to a pass Millennium oh isn't that wonderful now we left him last Sunday on the fourth chapter and the fourth verse and round about The Throne were 4 and 20 seats and upon the seats I Saw 4 and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white Rond and they had on their heads crowns of gold now we found out that these were Elders an elder is never applied to an angel or any being it is a redeemed human being Elders because the Thrones crowns dominions is never referred to to Angels but the crowns and Thrones so forth pertain to human beings and these Elders was crowned and clothed and setting on Thrones and we found them over other parts of the scripture that they were uh the 12 apostles and they were the 12 Patriarchs 24 of them which means 24 12 Apostles 12 Patriarchs we found even the city that descends from God out of heaven after the Earth is exploded and all gone to pieces and nothing left on the Earth but volcanic ashes that's all will be left there will be no more seed the sealed r i speaking last night to someone or yesterday and somewhere um the earth once stood up like this right around the Sun equal heat all the way up and down up in British ice Fields you can blast down there 500 ft and find Palms it comes suddenly Frozen like uh Refrigeration now like you're uh dehydrating and so forth and you freeze and deep freezes and keep strawberries and things for years and years and years to come see that's the same way it was in that time quickly that come an anel luian destruction and flooded the whole earth over and what it did Atomic Powers rocked it out of its orbits and it froze over and there she lay dig down in confin them up around the Arctic zones and things palm trees and so forth showed that it was once inhabited beautifully set up and now it shook back now where I think God got that water when the Genesis starts Genesis 1 the Earth was without form and void and water was up on the Deep the spirit of God moved up on the water and said let there be light God separated them the land and the water which made the Earth Earth but the whole earth was covered over now what he did he just through the atmosphere he just atmosphere is atmospheres is filled with hydrogen and oxygen and so forth then he just lifted it up off the Earth and separated it there was no Sea on the earth then God watered the Earth didn't he come rains he watered it through Springs and things irrigation then when he only thing he did then when man bloated out its orbit out to one side what happened it thred it back in the heat down here and the cold up there and hot and cold what accumulate on them windows right now hot in here and cold outside see the sweat and rain is nothing but sweat respiration and water is ashes and so then when it I like that song you laid your hand precious Lord on on the Prairies laid your wonderful hand on the rain Lord you poured forth the fountain raised up the mountain oh Lord keep your precious hand on me you made the clouds form the clouds that made the rain from the rain made the sea from the sea brought the clouds that give us life abundantly you hold the earth and the skies in your command Lord oh please keep your precious hand on on me oh how great yes the god of heaven then in this great time is leaning back like this now and he made us a promise no more water but fire this time instead of throwing they throw the Earth away from the Sun of course it got cold if you throw it into the sun it'll burn and just as he destroy it with water and put the boy in the sky wouldn't do it no more now I give promise he'd burn it so there you come we're sin and all Glamour and all filth and not long ago I was riding down through the prair a little boy I used to think get my history books and geographies and think of the Great Western Plains someday I said I'll live there peacefully and quiet where there's no sin and I'll roam the fields and I'll hunt like the Indian I I'll live there a peaceful life all the days of my life but now it's white man's been there where white man goes sin is with him he is the biggest murderer and killer of all the people on the Earth is a white man he's a renegade of all colors here not long ago in the paper brother Tom here from Africa um I seen a piece in the paper two weeks ago I believe it was and he said they said if the Americans are still permitted to go to Africa and 10 years so now the great African line will be completely distinct the elephants the Renegades shoot just anywhere he can picture of two big males trying to hold a wounded male up look like tears running from her eyes they didn't want the males didn't want the female die and each one holding by her side like this keep her from falling down to her to the ground just shop to Pieces a guy to shoot anything like that don't deserve to have a gun in his hand right you ain't got gumption enough to handle it a couple years ago trying to run some herd elk into my good friend brother Roy Roberson then back there what a guiding up in Colorado know we had a nice herd Jeff and I had him up there for years and years about 80 head elk and a herd let some of these office guys out of Denver come out there these blouse pants on Lace Lake Dam Hunters you they come up there bunching jeeps and things like I got back in our territory there and I was driving these elk across the mountain behind him about a mile or two in this hurting along you have to keep them thinned out the big old bulls and things so don't you break your herd up just like raising cattle or anything while life should be the same to us it's not a Target going to shoot Target that got range out here to shoot them on right it's a disgrace to butcher up things like that it's sinful it's ungodly and I counted 123 shots out of machine guns like faring from the shoulders and the next morning brother Banks wood chair with me went up on a mountain I counted 19 bloody beds didn't know nothing about hunting you shoot a big animal like that you might hit him deep enough to kill him they just turn bang bang bang shoot one then the other why they'll die why after the fever sets in them if youd find them they're no good they spoil right away and the Scavengers coyotes and things eat them up 19 bloody bed big bulls hoofs that big around and blood spting out two feet we been punctured like that with them guns they ought to allow a renegade like that to have a gun in his hand that's right he ain't got the gunion to handle a gun oh it's tremendous sinful to do like that that's awful but that's the Americans Canada you precious people from Canada if America keeps going on Canada be as low down as America after a while get around the borders of Canada anywhere and you got that American atmosphere this America is a prostitute of the Nations exact what she is and she's going to be worse than ever now she's coming to her end the Bible speaks of her Doom tells how she's going to be America Low Down Rotten filthy no good it's exactly right she's been a great nation she's car a gospel message what makes her the way she is because she's turned down the gospel message rejected the truth she's horrible she's got it coming don't worry I've seen it in the vision and thus sayith the lord it's coming she's going to pay for her sins back when America was America she was a great nation the greatest of Worlds ever known since Israel was America but she sure has polluted herself now she's rejected the message she's T nothing but just now she's got herself you see where she's at now everybody knows that in the last lection shows where her spiritual standing is she doesn't know now these Elders sitting up on the throne with these crowns now the fifth verse we're going to start and out of the throne proceeded Lightnings Thunders voices and there was seven lamps on fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God oh I love this don't you oh I just feel like my coat fits me you know just when oh I meaning a spiritual code of course you know all right out of the throne let's speak of this Throne now for a few minutes this was not a throne of Mercy amen Mercy's Throne is finished no more Mercy it's without Mercy how are we going how the Judgment seat going to be the Judgment seat of Christ the Judgment seat the white Throne judgment is there going to be Mercy then there is not one stretch of Mercy to be given at the Judgment Throne you can scream Mercy till you couldn't scream no more and you might as well scream out in the air somewhere because there's no more Mercy now is the day of Mercy now let's go back in the Old Testament here just a little bit and find out what Mercy is go back and see what happened to this Throne this Throne of course is the the Judgment seat and be the reason reason today that there is Mercy is because The Mercy Seat is sprinkled with an atonement blood and as long as blood is on the Judgment seat then it is not judgment no more it's Mercy because something died to stay judgment amen if you see it say amen amen as long as blood is on the Mercy Seat show that something died the whole judgment back but when the church is raptured The Mercy Seat becomes a judgment seat over in the old in the New Testament year two and the sanctuary that's where the the jury in the sanctuary the judge on the seat in the sanctuary now that judgment seat and the sanctuary become full of smoke what was it like mount judgment Mercy had left the The Throne of God God will judge the world without Mercy how many know that amen only one thing you'll recognize in that day what is it blood that's the only thing that peed and Angry God Adam and Eve made just as good apron as any Methodist Baptist Presbyterian a Pentecostal could make am it covered their nakedness but God could see through it so he kill something and Tuck the dead skins of the skins of the dead animal and cover it blood had to take its place that stay his wrath he seen the blood and backed off from it because something had shed its life oh God think of it only thing that'll back off God is blood and there's only one blood that he'll back from and that's his own son when he sees that's his own son's bloody a back back because that's a gift that is God has given to his son to redeem those who he fornew and it brings God back from his judgment but when that blood is removed then all that was for known has been called into the precious body his church has been made ready and taken up and God's Wrath is on the people oh brother don't never want to stand there let me stand before a machine gun let me be cut to Pieces let me be sought inch by inch let anything happen is the oath of the Knights of columus let him split up my belly and burn sof and everything else in me my hard arms and legs cut off whatever it may be but never let me stand at that white Throne judgment before God oh let me take this little throne here before the seat of Christ and accept his blood nothing in my arms I bring Lord no no other found I know nothing but the blood of Jesus that's all I know about this is All My Hope and state nothing but the blood of Jesus no wonder Eddie fruit turned down on his songs and he a Christian to ston Christian they didn't want to buy his songs one day he said I'll write one and someday day that they'll receive and the people's want something more modernistic in the religious song one day there the Holy Spirit talk me grabs the pen and he wrote all hail the power of Jesus name let Angels prostrate fall bring forth the Royal diadic Lord of Lord for on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds is sinking stand all other grounds is sinking Hallelujah where Church where it BR where it's B where it's Nation where it's riches where it's poverty where it's good or whatever it is all other grounds the sinking sand that's the only thing it'll finally go away but Christ that solid Rocky standand all other grounds the sinking sand bear that in mind notice let's go over to Leviticus 16 and read in the back way back in back to the Bible now the levitical laws and see over here of Leviticus Leviticus the 16th chapter and begin with the 14th verse of the 16th chapter oh I I love to take my time on these things bring them out Leviticus 14 uh Leviticus 16:14 and he shall take out the blood of the bulock and sprinkle it with his finger up on The Mercy Seat up on The Mercy Seat watch we're going to get into this after a while Eastward don't forget that word Eastward where is Jesus coming from the east in a Cloud of Glory where does the s u n ride East where will the s o n rise east where was The Mercy Seat setting towards the east why have I got you all setting this way towards the east while the altar is to the east we'll see that while I beautifully I'm going to draw it out as as many as I could to bring papers and so forth to get these maps in a few minutes all right sprinkl it Eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle the blood with his finger seven times oh isn't that beautiful seven times towards the east what is it the seven Church ages shall be covered by the blood Hallelujah Jesus Christ's blood just is sufficient yesterday today and forever and to every age save every sinner heal every sick person bring every Miracle every sign to pass seven times way back Yonder in the old testament, 1490 years before Christ come think of it symol seven times shall then shall he kill the goat the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood with the in the veil to do with that blood as he did with the blood of the Bullock sprinkled it upon the mercy seat and before the mercy seat and he shall make an atonement for the holy place because the of the uncleansed of the children of Israel and because of their trespasses in all their sins and so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them that is in theid of their uncleanness what was it The Mercy Seat where the na and there inside of the Ark was the what the law and the law to trespass one commandment was to die without Mercy but that you could have mercy the blood had to lay on the altar they sprinkled The Mercy Seat and The Mercy Seat is the altar where you kneel and as for mercy God forbid it we ever take it from our churches the oldfashioned altar where man can kneel and call on God for mercy and mercy is Rich and flowing free from the blood of the Lord Jesus now also that's the Mercy that's Mercy Seat but you notice in here it was not mercy seat for there was Lightnings and thunder and voices there's no lightning and Thunders at Mercy that's judgment let's turn to Exodus 19th Chapter of Exodus and the 16th verse Exodus 19 chapter of Exodus and let's begin with the 16th verse and it came to pass listen what the when God ascended up on Mount sonion and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Thunders lightning and a thick Cloud upon the mountain and the voice of the trumpet exceedingly loud what is the voice of the trumpet is the Archangel so that all the people listen all the people was in the camp trembled judgment they marched out there and God had given him Grace to travel by but they had demanded a law they God wanted to be in a denomination they want to make it denomination something they could argue about instead of just following God and living under his jurisdiction under his power Grace had provided a prophet Grace had provided an atonement a lamb Grace had provided all these things and yet they wanted judgment they wanted something they could do God said Sim them together I'll let them know what it is I'll show them what it is read listen and the voice of the trumpet got louder and louder until it shut the Earth you see what judgment is I don't want that give me mercy and yes that was uh Exodus the U the the 19th Chapter and the 16th verse brother friend Exodus 1916 now notice the 17th verse and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God oh my I want to meet him in peace not like that and they stood at the either part of the Mountain Way Back remember that mountain had lies drawn around it even if a cow touched that mountain had to die right there can't come in the presence of God and God and Moses brought forth the people now the 18th verse the next verse and Mount Si was all together on smoke because the Lord descended upon on it in fire just smoking and burning like a furnace what did he send not in his sh Glory but in the wrath of his judgments and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole Mountain Quake greatly brother I don't want to be there and when the voice of the trumpet sound long and waxed louder louder Moses spoke and God answered him by a voice Moses spoke not the people that were shaking the pieces and the and the Lord came down upon Mount Si on the top of the mountain and the Lord Called Moses up to the top of the mountain and Moses went up and the Lord said unto Moses go down and charge the people let's say break through unto the Lord to gaze and many of them perish set in the back of the church right at somebody speaking with Tong or dancing the spirit goone blashe the Holy Ghost seal forever whosoever speaks a word against the Holy Ghost will never be forgiven in this world neither in the world to come don't gaze upon it stay away from it or either accept [Applause] it we better leave that scripture read it on the rest of it see what God Said and the people said oh MOS as you speak don't let God speak anymore am we wish now we had to ask for this see let you speak to us Moses God speaks with all die see God made an atonement now the voice of the throne notice in this Throne Before the Throne was the Seven Stars the voice of the Stars voices you see there was more in the revelations four here or five we find out and out of the throne proceeded lightning Thunders and voices not one voice voices plural what was it God speaking to the church reflecting himself through the seven spirits when the true anointed of God speaks it's the voice of God you rejected is to remove candlesticks voices the voice of the seven Church agents over here in the corner the voices speaking with thunder and lightning

preach the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to the P pit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon amen let your sermon be lived and it's the voice
