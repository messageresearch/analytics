[0:35] stand
[0:38] of prayer.
[0:42] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to
[0:44] be here today. We're thankful for the
[0:46] things that we're about to hear, Lord.
[0:49] Lord, all those that have gathered, we
[0:50] pray a blessing upon each and everyone.
[0:53] Lord, those that are on the way, Father,
[0:56] everything that would be done in this
[0:58] house of worship today, Father, let your
[1:01] hand, mighty hand and anointing, your
[1:04] presence be upon everything. Father,
[1:07] we'll give you all the praise and the
[1:09] glory. We're thankful, Lord, for future
[1:12] home, Lord, that here on earth that
[1:15] you're preparing for us, Lord, and also
[1:17] a place in heaven. So, we're grateful,
[1:20] Lord. And we commit this time to you now
[1:23] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:26] Amen. We're going to be continuing with
[1:29] the uh future home of the heavenly
[1:33] bridegroom and the earthly bride. We'll
[1:35] start at paragraph 298 and we'll end
[1:39] after 272 would be about 20 minutes. And
[1:42] of course this is from second Peter the
[1:44] whole chapter and revelation 21.
[1:48] Only believe.
[1:51] Only believe.
[1:55] Only
[1:57] believe.
[1:59] [Music]
[2:00] All things are possible.
[2:04] [Music]
[2:05] Only
[2:07] believe.
[2:10] Only
[2:12] believe.
[2:15] Only
[2:17] believe.
[2:20] All things are possible.
[2:25] Only
[2:27] believe.
[2:29] You may be seated. Brother Brennan.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; Notice that Jesus said John 14. Now go
[2:38] and prepare a place. Oh, what will it
[2:42] look like? Did you ever think now bride
[2:46] what it will look like?
[2:48] It is prepared and designed by the
[2:51] divine architect.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; What will that city look like? Now,
[2:55] we're going to talk about it for a few
[2:56] minutes. The divine architect has
[2:59] prepared it. Designed it.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; And look, he's designed it with tender
[3:04] hands for his beloved bride.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like?
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a man marrying a wife
[3:12] that's able? how he builds and puts
[3:13] every little thing just exactly to her
[3:15] touch, just what she'd like.
[3:19] Amen.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the divine architect
[3:22] has designed the new city where he will
[3:26] live with his bride just to her touch.
[3:30] No wonder the apostle said, "Eye has not
[3:32] seen, ear is not heard, and neither has
[3:34] ever entered the heart of man."
[3:37] Let's see if we can probe into it just
[3:39] for a moment.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; See what it's going to look like.
[3:42] The divine architect has designed this
[3:45] for his beloved. See, oh what a place it
[3:48] must be when divine nature,
[3:51] a divine architect has a design it for a
[3:55] divine attribute
[3:57] that's been divinely predestinated
[4:00] by a divine God
[4:04] &gt;&gt; who is the author of divine life.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; What will that city look like?
[4:11] Think of it. Remember, it's not heaven.
[4:15] John say, "I saw it coming down out of
[4:18] heaven."
[4:19] &gt;&gt; It's to be on earth.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; See, not this earth's going to pass
[4:25] away. It's a redeemed earth. God didn't
[4:27] say he's going to raise up a new
[4:28] generation. He's going to redeem the one
[4:30] that's here.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; He ain't going to raise up a new
[4:33] generation. He redeems the one that's
[4:34] already here.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; He ain't going to make no new world.
[4:37] It's this one right here. is just going
[4:38] to burn it off. Cleanse it like he did
[4:40] you. His plans must forever remain.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Now look,
[4:47] it's going to be remember it's going not
[4:49] to be heaven. It comes down from heaven.
[4:53] It's a dwelling place, a place to dwell
[4:55] in to take up his abode.
[4:58] Like u it was the John on the aisle of
[5:01] Patmasure in Revelation 21. He saw it
[5:04] descending. John saw the city descending
[5:07] from heaven like a dove like he seen
[5:10] here come God down upon his earthly
[5:13] tabernacle Jesus in a descending out of
[5:16] heaven.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus was baptized went straight way
[5:19] when he met the prophet. The word comes
[5:21] to the prophet and he was the word and
[5:24] the prophet is standing there denying
[5:25] all their denomination everything and
[5:27] when he seen the word the word come
[5:28] right to him.
[5:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; The prophet was so shocked he said I
[5:32] have need to be baptized of thee. Why
[5:34] come me? said, "Suffer to be so. For
[5:36] thus it is becoming to us, we know the
[5:38] message, to fulfill all rights. I am the
[5:41] sacrifice that must be washed."
[5:43] &gt;&gt; He suffered him. When he went up out of
[5:45] the water, he said, "I saw heavens
[5:46] open."
[5:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet saw it.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; He saw the heavens open. And here come
[5:52] descending out of heaven a form of a
[5:54] dove and a voice saying, "This is my
[5:57] part of the earth
[5:59] &gt;&gt; that I have redeemed. And from this part
[6:01] of the earth, I will redeem the rest of
[6:03] it.
[6:05] For he is my word made manifest.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; And the whole world I spoke it into
[6:11] existence by my word. Hebrews 11.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; And Satan's held it all this time, but
[6:17] I've come to redeem it. So much of it
[6:19] has made his body, and I'm coming to
[6:21] dwell in it. John said, "I saw the holy
[6:24] city, the new Jerusalem, descending out
[6:27] of heaven
[6:28] &gt;&gt; as a bride adored for her husband. And
[6:31] where did it settle on?" Just exactly
[6:33] like it did on there up on the earth.
[6:36] Jesus was part of that earth that the
[6:39] Holy Ghost descended upon. Is that
[6:41] right?
[6:42] &gt;&gt; And remained up on him forever.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; It never can leave him. It's always that
[6:46] he and God are one.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; Always has to remain. And so John saw
[6:51] the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
[6:54] descending like a comet, a dove coming
[6:57] down out of heaven and settling up on a
[7:01] redeemed entire earth
[7:04] &gt;&gt; to do what? To claim every attribute
[7:10] &gt;&gt; that he made the earth for.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Every man that was represented in the
[7:14] eternity and every woman is redeemed.
[7:18] She's been scarred and burned by fire.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus in his fiery temptations in the
[7:23] wilderness for 40 days. After that,
[7:25] notice it was ready for his ministry.
[7:27] Then think of it, the Holy Ghost
[7:29] descending upon earth,
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; And that holy blood,
[7:37] &gt;&gt; I watch. I hope I don't go too deep for
[7:40] you. The holy blood that was created
[7:45] by God.
[7:47] The blood,
[7:48] &gt;&gt; the life,
[7:50] &gt;&gt; the creation of God.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the beginning of the creation
[7:54] of God.
[7:57] &gt;&gt; You see it?
[7:59] &gt;&gt; God made in creation.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; He was spirit.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he's the beginning of the
[8:06] creation of God.
[8:08] &gt;&gt; How did it begin? In the wombs of a
[8:10] woman. Amen.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Which is why the woman is not like how
[8:15] them blind people can't see the serpent
[8:17] seed right here.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; See, Eve was put here on the earth and
[8:22] before Satan ever touched her or
[8:24] anything else, God said to him,
[8:25] "Multiply and replenish the earth."
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[8:29] &gt;&gt; But Satan comes in here.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; And if that was Adam's son, then were
[8:34] Adam was a direct descent from God.
[8:38] And you only take the nature of your
[8:40] parent.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; And when you're born again, you take the
[8:43] nature of your parent of heaven.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; And your parent of heaven is the
[8:49] attribute of the word
[8:50] &gt;&gt; or the word is the attribute of your
[8:52] parent. And how can you deny it for
[8:54] denomination?
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; I I hope you don't miss this.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; I know it's from God.
[9:08] Jesus. Here he comes descending. And
[9:11] there was Jesus, the attribute of God.
[9:14] Now the woman, she watch God said
[9:17] because it did this said, "I'll put
[9:19] enmity between your seed and the
[9:23] serpent's seed." Is that right?
[9:25] &gt;&gt; And the woman don't have any seed.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; You ever think of that? That's right.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; She has a field.
[9:38] &gt;&gt; Not a seed.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; See, the serpent had already placed his
[9:42] seed there.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; Then if the woman doesn't have a seed,
[9:46] she has to remain to have a seed. And
[9:48] see, through the sexual intercourse here
[9:50] had brought from Satan the serpent,
[9:52] which was not a reptile,
[9:53] &gt;&gt; amen,
[9:54] &gt;&gt; had legs because his legs went off of
[9:55] him. Is the most subtle, the only beast
[9:57] that would would coordinate with the
[9:58] woman. A beast seed won't do it now.
[10:00] Ain't nothing else. They've tried it.
[10:02] Won't work.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; See, the seed life of a male won't go
[10:06] into a female woman. It won't do it. But
[10:07] that was the closest thing. See, they
[10:09] can't find that species between a
[10:10] japanzee and a man.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; See, each one as it's evoluted up from
[10:15] the birds on up to donkeys and so forth
[10:17] up to a japanzee. Then there's a loss.
[10:19] That was a serpent,
[10:21] not a snake. Every form is lost from him
[10:24] because he was cursed. Now, God didn't
[10:26] curse Adam. He might have done the same
[10:28] thing, but he cursed the earth. thorns
[10:30] and thistles. He didn't curse Eve, but
[10:32] said Adam would be her ruler
[10:36] &gt;&gt; from now on. She ain't trying to preach
[10:37] or anything. Adam
[10:39] &gt;&gt; is her ruler
[10:41] &gt;&gt; and all the days of your life and in
[10:42] sorrow and you'll bring her life into
[10:44] the earth. But he said, "I'll put enmity
[10:46] between your seed." Now, she didn't have
[10:49] any seed. She never did have.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; So, she had to receive a seed from some
[10:53] way.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; God gave her a seed,
[10:56] &gt;&gt; not by sexual intercourse, but by
[10:58] creation. And can't you blind people see
[11:00] that's the seed of the serpent?
[11:03] &gt;&gt; My
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Satan got there before Adam.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; That was the seed. But she received a
[11:10] seed. What was it? God himself.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the creation of
[11:16] God.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Now look, when Seth was born or Abel, he
[11:20] was a just man from his father. Seaith's
[11:23] the same way. Where' that evil fellow
[11:25] come from?
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Murder, liar.
[11:28] See?
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; See where it come from? It had to be a
[11:31] seed because he was a seed. Cain was a
[11:34] man.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, where's that blind people at?
[11:39] &gt;&gt; God of this world is blind. Well, no
[11:40] wonder Jesus said, "No man can see it."
[11:42] See,
[11:44] &gt;&gt; you say, "Why don't they see it?" Jesus
[11:46] said one time to his disciple, "It's
[11:47] given to you to know the kingdom of God,
[11:49] but not to them." That's the reason you
[11:52] come from 1500 mile square. See, it's
[11:55] given to you to know the kingdom. Look
[11:57] fellas, it's going to eat from South
[11:58] Africa and around this late hour when
[12:00] the bride is made up to go into the
[12:03] kingdom.
[12:06] I just don't have enough time. Notice
[12:10] watch now. Now, can you see the serpent
[12:12] seed there? See how it done? It's
[12:15] perfect.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Now, some of them said like that guy in
[12:18] Tucson the other day trying he may
[12:20] listen to this tape, but if it is, man,
[12:22] I want to tell you something.
[12:24] When he said Eve said, here's where they
[12:26] go to. I've gotten a son from the Lord
[12:28] or a man from the Lord. Well, certainly
[12:31] God has a law.
[12:34] Look, you take a seed and plant it out
[12:36] here in a field where you sweet and you
[12:37] plant briars out there. I don't care.
[12:39] The same sun and the same rain brings
[12:41] that seed to life.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; God has a law
[12:45] &gt;&gt; and that law cannot be broken. I don't
[12:46] care if a if a the honorest woman in the
[12:49] town, the honorest man and unmarried and
[12:51] everything would have an an affair and
[12:53] live together and bring forth a child.
[12:55] That child would have to come by the law
[12:56] of God because you no other way. If you
[12:58] don't, you make Satan a creator then
[12:59] he's a god.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; How blind can you be?
[13:06] &gt;&gt; God's law certainly if you ever got a
[13:08] baby, I don't care if it was Esau,
[13:09] Jacob, whoever it was or any ill famed
[13:11] person if it was Judas that had to come
[13:13] by God.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; God has a law. The Bible said the sun
[13:16] shines on the just and the unjust. The
[13:18] rain falls on the just. Now Hebrews the
[13:20] 6th chapter and it says that the rain
[13:22] cometh off upon the earth to water and
[13:24] prepare it for what's dressed you know
[13:26] to make living. But thorns and thistles
[13:28] live by the same watermen
[13:30] &gt;&gt; same sunshine.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; For it's the law of God to ripen every
[13:34] seed to make every seed produce itself.
[13:36] So it had to produce the serpent seed.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; And it never hindered God. It fulfilled
[13:41] his complete plan. It made him a
[13:43] redeemer.
[13:47] Hallelujah.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; Any blind would almost see that unless
[13:51] it's hid the god of the world is hid.
[13:53] It's just as plain as anything you can
[13:55] see.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; There you are. There's your serpent
[13:58] seed. Now notice, but Jesus was the
[14:01] beginning of the creation of God. Now,
[14:03] what does a woman do when the germ comes
[14:06] from the male segment? Now, deny that.
[14:09] The woman has no life in her at all.
[14:11] Amen.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; She only has a little egg, which is a
[14:13] field out here. Like you took a field
[14:15] and disc it all up and and put put a
[14:18] spray on it and sprayed all the germs
[14:19] out of it and nothing not even grass and
[14:21] nothing could grow in it and then you
[14:22] fertilize again, sew some good seed in
[14:24] there. If the enemy comes and sows some
[14:26] other seed, the same law of God will
[14:28] write in both seeds.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Well, God wasn't intended for that to
[14:32] be. See, but what happened? See the
[14:36] sperm from the male carries the
[14:38] hemoglobin which is the blood. In the
[14:41] blood is the life.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; And if you ever I've watched it in high
[14:43] breeding cattle and things like that,
[14:45] brother Shakar and I taking it through
[14:46] in the doctors and so forth watching
[14:48] high go in a chemist. See, then here
[14:50] comes the sperm from the female which is
[14:52] a bunch of eggs. Here comes the sperm
[14:55] from the male which is a bunch of germs.
[14:57] This hasn't got a bit of germ in it.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; It's only a byproduct of the man. That's
[15:01] how she got here in the first place.
[15:02] Amen.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; And she's only a field. There's a egg
[15:06] that's got the fertile ground for this
[15:08] life.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; And this life moves in and crawls.
[15:11] There's a mystery. How the maybe you
[15:13] say, "Well, the first one meets the rest
[15:15] of them dies." Well, how who determines
[15:18] it? Well, the first one will it be the
[15:20] one in front, the first egg in front,
[15:21] and the first germ? No. No. It might be
[15:23] one egg come back in the back and the
[15:25] middle of the sperm will come up a germ
[15:26] and go meet it.
[15:28] shows that some intelligence determines
[15:30] where it's going to be redheaded,
[15:31] blackheaded, where it's going to be
[15:32] little, big, male, or female.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Hey, you can't you can't do nothing else
[15:35] about it. It won't work. You can mix
[15:37] them together and everything. It won't
[15:38] make a bit of difference. God determines
[15:40] it.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; After a while, one little germ will
[15:42] crawl into that field egg. What? They
[15:45] have the little tail like on it,
[15:46] twisting around, drops off, and there
[15:48] starts the spine of the baby.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; What is she then? She has no seed. She
[15:54] has a field to receive the seed. Amen.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; So the seed the enemy went forth while
[15:59] the good ser went forth sowing good seed
[16:02] and the enemy come behind him sowing
[16:05] corrupt seed.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; But the rain falls on the just and the
[16:09] unjust.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; The son it all has to grow. Jesus said
[16:12] let them grow together.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; At that day they'll be bundled the
[16:17] terriers
[16:18] &gt;&gt; and they're bundling now and big
[16:19] organizations going to the big bundle
[16:21] &gt;&gt; world council churches and what was in
[16:23] is to be burned. But the grains to be
[16:26] take to the gardener
[16:28] where they both live by the same thing,
[16:29] the same water, the same rain.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; A citrus tree that's a it's an orange
[16:34] tree will have to will bring forth on it
[16:37] if it's grafted into it a pomegrant.
[16:41] It'll bring forth a lemon. It'll bring
[16:44] forth a grapefruit. See, but it won't be
[16:46] an orange. But it's living off the same
[16:49] life that the orange tree is producing.
[16:51] Amen.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Denominations have been injected into
[16:54] the vine because as they claim
[16:57] Christians, they live by it. K. Ephesus
[17:00] was, you know, what he was and yet he
[17:02] even prophesied.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; See, they live by it. Oh, I wish we
[17:08] could have a week and we just study this
[17:11] thing out, make it so clear. You You
[17:12] can't miss seeing it. Now, I'm going to
[17:15] admit some of these things. Now, watch.
[17:17] Look. them hands designed this for his
[17:21] beloved and bride designs and tenderly
[17:25] love for his bride. Remember that the
[17:28] Holy Ghost descended on Jesus which
[17:31] Jesus was a part of the earth. Why? The
[17:36] germ of God, the life of God was
[17:38] designed in the womb of a woman. Is that
[17:40] right?
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Which was the earth. All right. And then
[17:44] the life of God came in. So he was the
[17:46] beginning of the creation of God. See,
[17:50] and then that blood of God that was that
[17:52] by that germ when it was shed at
[17:53] Calvary, dropped back upon the earth.
[17:56] What for? To redeem the earth.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Now it's been justified. It's been
[18:01] sanctified, called and cleaned. And now
[18:03] it's to receive its baptism of fire and
[18:06] be cleansed for Jesus and his bride.
[18:08] Amen.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; And you are these other parts that's
[18:12] drawn out of this earth,
[18:14] &gt;&gt; the earth. You're a part of the earth,
[18:16] your body. Your soul is part of God, an
[18:19] attribute of God displayed here on earth
[18:21] in a body. The body is to be redeemed.
[18:23] Now the soul's redeemed because it was
[18:25] in sin. So God come down by a process of
[18:27] justification, sanctification, baptism
[18:29] of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your
[18:31] soul.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; And you being part of the earth, it's
[18:34] redeemed by it. You're in the process
[18:36] now. It's growing on. Your body was
[18:38] justified under Noah's baptism.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And your flesh when it dropped up
[18:44] on there and the earth is to be cleansed
[18:47] by fire, the place where you live with
[18:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, a
[18:50] dwelling place for Christ and his bride,
[18:53] the new Jerusalem. Watch this city earth
[18:58] take up its abode on earth. Now you can
[19:00] plainly see as I said the this change
[19:03] the earth must be changed. You cannot
[19:06] have it like this. The church could not
[19:09] go, the world could not go right on
[19:11] after the millennium without being
[19:13] changed. See, to have such a place in
[19:16] it, it'll have to be changed. Just like
[19:19] uh we must be changed by his holy fire
[19:22] to condition and make a place for him to
[19:25] be contained within us. That is the Holy
[19:28] Ghost. Notice now
[19:31] there'll be plenty of room in the new
[19:32] earth.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:35] See, plenty of room. It'll be renovated.
[19:38] That's true by far. But there'll be no
[19:41] more sea.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Notice the city is
[19:46] 1,500
[19:48] miles square.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Now listen real close while we draw
[19:53] these dimensions. I want to raise the
[19:55] blackboard just a moment.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Here's a deep revelation
[20:01] from God.
[20:05] None of these other I'll bring the rest
[20:06] of this up the Lord willing. Notice now
[20:09] the earth is we turn over into the book
[20:12] of revelations. You can see how he
[20:14] measured it by the cubits and by the
[20:17] furlongs 2300. So now we find out that
[20:21] the city is measured
[20:23] 1500 miles square.
[20:26] You know how far that would reach? I
[20:28] measured it off this week. It would
[20:30] reach from Maine to Florida.
[20:34] and from the eastern seabboard to 600
[20:38] miles of path west of the Mississippi.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, half of the United
[20:44] States
[20:46] just for the city.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; You say there ain't no room. When the
[20:50] sea's gone, there will be cost four
[20:53] fifths of it in water.
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right? The explosion dries up
[21:00] the sea. That's
[21:01] &gt;&gt; right.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Erupts the earth.
[21:05] Oh my. Remember 1,500
[21:09] miles square.
[21:12] What a city.
[21:15] &gt;&gt; And but remember the sea's gone. And the
[21:18] breadth
[21:20] and the height are the same.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would make it 1,500 miles
[21:25] this way, 1,500 miles that way, 1500
[21:29] miles the length by the breadth, by the
[21:31] height.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; 1,500 miles.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Think of it. Transparent goal.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; And the city had a wall around it.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Now, now that doesn't necessarily mean
[21:48] by being equal, it said and the walls
[21:51] and the foundation were equal. That
[21:53] doesn't necessarily mean that it's a
[21:55] cube or square. There is another
[21:58] geographical measure that the dimensions
[22:00] are the same. That is a pyramid.
[22:04] Four square l four square and the walls
[22:07] are the same. Let me draw it.
[22:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; See, red.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; We're going to get into this thing as
[22:20] sure as a world.
[22:22] Notice
[22:24] the dimensions of this angle is exactly
[22:27] the same. All of them length by the by
[22:30] the height. There's another measure, the
[22:33] pyramid that proves it.

[33:24] verse.
[33:26] When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be
[33:30] so glad
[33:32] to keep on the firing line.
[33:38] How we'll praise the Savior for the call
[33:41] we had.
[33:43] Keep on the fire in line.
[33:49] When we see the souls that we have
[33:52] helped to win,
[33:54] leading them to Jesus from the path of
[33:59] sin.
[34:00] With a shout of welcome, we will all
[34:04] maring.
[34:05] So keep on the fiery line.
[34:10] You must fight. Be free against all

[34:56] Amen. Let's give our Lord a hand of
[34:58] praise this morning.
[35:02] Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing
[35:07] power? Are you washed in the blood of
[35:11] the lamb?
[35:13] Are you fully trusting in his grace this
[35:18] hour? Are you washed in the blood of the
[35:22] lamb?
[35:24] Are you washed
[35:27] in the blood
[35:30] in the snow cleansing blood of the lamb?
[35:36] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[35:39] white as snow? Are you walking in the
[35:44] blood of the lamb?
[35:47] Are you walking daily by the savior's
[35:52] side? Are you washed in the blood of the
[35:56] lamb?
[35:58] Do you rest each moment by the
[36:02] crucified?
[36:04] Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
[36:09] Are you washed
[36:12] in the blood,
[36:15] in the snow cleansing blood of the lamb?
[36:22] [Music]
[36:23] Oh, are they white as snow? Are you
[36:27] washed in the blood of the lamb?
[36:32] Now, when the bridegroom cometh, will
[36:35] your robes be white? Are you washed in
[36:40] the blood of the lamb?
[36:44] Will your soul be ready for the manion
[36:48] bright? Are you washed in the blood of
[36:52] the lamb? The next verse.
[36:55] Pay aside your garments that are stained
[36:59] with sin and be washed in the blood of
[37:04] the lamb.
[37:06] Here's a fountain flowing for the soul.

[37:32] white as snow? Are you washed in the
[37:37] blood of the lamb?
[37:40] Amen. Praise the Lord. And may you may
[37:43] be seated this morning. Oh, he left the
[37:46] splendor of heaven.
[37:48] [Music]
[37:50] Oh, he left
[37:53] the splendor
[37:55] of heaven.
[38:00] Knowing
[38:02] his destiny
[38:09] was the lonely
[38:12] hill of Galatha
[38:18] there to lay down his life
[38:23] for me.
[38:28] If that isn't
[38:31] love,
[38:35] the ocean
[38:38] is dry.
[38:42] There's no stars in the sky.
[38:49] And the sparrow
[38:52] can fly.
[38:54] [Music]
[38:57] If that isn't
[39:00] love,
[39:04] then heaven's
[39:06] a myth.
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] There's no feeling
[39:13] like this.
[39:18] If that isn't
[39:21] love,

[39:30] Even
[39:32] in death he remember
[39:39] the thief hanging
[39:42] by
[39:44] his side.
[39:47] [Music]
[39:48] He spoke
[39:51] with love and compassion
[39:55] [Music]
[39:58] and he took him to parise.
[40:05] [Music]
[40:07] Oh, if that isn't
[40:10] love,
[40:14] the ocean
[40:16] is dry.
[40:21] There's no stars in the sky.
[40:26] [Music]
[40:28] And the sparrow
[40:31] can't fly.
[40:36] If that is in love
[40:43] in heaven,
[40:45] [Music]
[40:50] there's no feeling
[40:52] like this.
[40:57] If that is that love with all your heart
[41:02] this morning. Oh, if that isn't
[41:07] love.
[41:11] The ocean
[41:14] is dry.
[41:18] There's no stars in the sky.
[41:25] And the sparrow
[41:28] can fly.
[41:32] Go. That isn't
[41:35] love
[41:40] in heaven.
[41:44] [Music]
[41:46] There's no feeling
[41:49] like this.
[41:54] Oh, if that isn't love
[42:00] for you,
[42:03] you are worthy of it all.
[42:10] You are worthy of it all.
[42:18] From you are all things.
[42:21] To you are all things.
[42:24] You deserve the glory.

[42:37] You are worthy of it all.
[42:44] For from you are all things,
[42:47] and to you are all things.
[42:51] You deserve the glory. One more time,
[42:55] Brother Sean, will you get ready? You
[42:58] are worthy of it all.
[43:01] [Music]
[43:05] You are worthy of it all.
[43:12] For from you are all things
[43:16] and to you are all things.

[43:44] and to you are all things.
[43:48] You deserve the gloryy.
[43:54] Amen. When he reached down his hand for
[43:57] me, if we could get the words up to
[43:58] that, please. And feel free feel free to
[44:02] sing it with me. I know we all know it.
[44:04] Sang it here before.
[44:06] But it's a testimony.
[44:09] when he reached down his hand for me as
[44:13] my testimony.
[44:17] Well, once my soul
[44:20] was array
[44:23] from the heavenly
[44:27] way,
[44:29] then was rich
[44:32] and vile
[44:35] as could be.
[44:40] But my savior
[44:44] above,
[44:46] he gave me peace,
[44:49] joy, and love
[44:52] when he raised
[44:55] down his hand
[44:58] for me.
[45:00] I was nearing despair. Oh, and I was
[45:04] near
[45:06] in despair
[45:09] when he came
[45:12] to me there.
[45:15] And he showed me that I
[45:20] could be free.
[45:25] And then he lifted
[45:29] my feet.
[45:31] He gave me gloryy
[45:34] all complete
[45:36] when he reach
[45:39] down his hand
[45:42] for me.
[45:45] Oh,
[45:47] and when he reached
[45:50] down his hand
[45:53] for me,
[45:56] aren't you glad he reached down his
[45:58] hand? He had to reach
[46:01] a way down
[46:04] for me
[46:07] just for me.
[46:09] I was so lost
[46:12] and undone
[46:15] without God
[46:18] or his son.
[46:21] and he reached
[46:23] down his hand
[46:26] for me.
[46:31] And how my heart
[46:34] doth rejoice
[46:37] since I made
[46:40] him my choice.
[46:43] In the tempest
[46:45] [Music]
[46:46] to him
[46:48] I can flee
[46:53] and there to lean
[46:56] on his arm
[46:59] safe secure
[47:02] from my harm
[47:04] when he
[47:07] down his hand
[47:10] for me.
[47:12] Since he gave me peace. Well, since the
[47:16] Lord
[47:18] gave me peace,
[47:20] those heavenly joys
[47:24] never cease.
[47:26] And Lord, I give
[47:29] all my life
[47:32] unto thee.
[47:35] [Music]
[47:37] Guide my feet
[47:39] and hold my head
[47:43] with thee that I may stand
[47:48] for you. Reach
[47:51] down your hand
[47:53] for me. Sing it out to him now. when he
[47:57] reached and when he raised
[48:01] down his hand
[48:04] for me.
[48:08] Oh,
[48:09] he had to reach
[48:12] away down
[48:15] for me.
[48:18] [Music]
[48:20] I was so lost
[48:23] and undone
[48:26] without God
[48:29] or his son
[48:31] when he reached
[48:34] down his head
[48:37] just for me.
[48:39] [Music]
[48:41] Oh, when the Savior
[48:45] reached down
[48:47] for me,
[48:52] he had to reach
[48:55] a way down
[48:58] for me.
[49:03] I was so lost
[49:06] and undone
[49:09] without God
[49:12] or his son
[49:14] when he reached
[49:17] down his hand
[49:20] just for me.
[49:22] [Music]
[49:28] Amen. Praise the Lord. Where would any
[49:30] of us be without that precious hand
[49:32] reaching down? If you'll stand with me

[52:22] and bow our knees
[52:25] to worship at your throne.
[52:31] We need you, Lord. We need you, Lord,
[52:36] right now. I need you, Lord.
[52:43] I need you, Lord.
[52:47] I need you, Lord,
[52:50] right now.
[52:52] [Music]
[52:56] I need you, Lord.
[52:59] I need you, Lord, right now.
[53:08] I lift my hands
[53:12] and bow my knees
[53:15] and worship at your throne.
[53:21] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord.
[53:26] right now. One last time this morning.
[53:33] I need you, Lord.
[53:37] I need you, Lord,
[53:40] right now.
[53:46] I need you, Lord.
[53:49] I need you, Lord,
[53:52] right now.
[53:55] [Music]
[53:58] Oh, I lift my hands and bow my knees
[54:04] and worship at your throne.
[54:10] I need you, Lord. I need you, Lord,
[54:15] right now.
[54:18] Amen. You may be seated this morning.
[54:22] Amen. And we'll go to the key of B flat.
[54:25] [Music]
[54:29] There's a lighthouse
[54:34] on a hillside
[54:38] that overlooks
[54:40] life seas.
[54:44] When I'm tossed,
[54:47] it sends out a light.
[54:53] that I might see.
[54:58] And the light that shines
[55:02] in darkness now will safely
[55:08] lead me home.
[55:12] If it wasn't
[55:14] for the lighthouse,
[55:17] [Music]
[55:19] my ship would sail no more.
[55:27] And I thank God
[55:31] for the lighthouse.
[55:36] I owe my life to him.
[55:43] Oh Jesus
[55:45] is the lighthouse.
[55:48] [Music]
[55:50] I'm safe from the rocks of sin.
[55:55] He has shown a light
[56:00] around me
[56:03] that I might clearly see.
[56:09] If it wasn't
[56:12] for the lighthouse,
[56:16] tell me where would this ship be?
[56:21] [Music]
[56:26] Everybody
[56:29] that lives around us
[56:33] sits here that high house down.
[56:40] The big ships
[56:42] don't sail this way anymore.
[56:48] There's no use of it standing around.
[56:53] Then my mind goes back to that stormy
[56:59] night where just in time. Oh, I saw the
[57:05] light was the light from that old
[57:10] lighthouse.
[57:13] It stands up there on the hill.
[57:21] And I thank God
[57:25] for the lighthouse.
[57:30] I owe my life to him.
[57:36] King Jesus
[57:39] is the lighthouse.
[57:43] And from the rocks of sin,
[57:49] he has shown his light around me
[57:57] that I might clearly
[58:00] see.
[58:02] If it wasn't
[58:05] for the lighthouse,
[58:10] tell me where would this ship be? And I
[58:16] thank God
[58:19] for
[58:20] the lighthouse.
[58:23] How I owe my life to him.
[58:30] Oh Jesus
[58:32] is the lighthouse.
[58:35] [Music]
[58:37] I'm safe from the rocks of sin.
[58:42] He has shown his light around me.
[58:50] Oh that I might clearly see.
[58:57] If it wasn't
[58:59] for the lighthouse,
[59:03] tell me where would this ship be?
[59:09] Amen. We'll go ahead and change the
[59:11] order of our service this morning. We'll
[59:13] continue to sing that chorus. Brother
[59:14] Joe Galatee, if you'll come.
[59:18] And I thank God
[59:21] for the lighthouse.
[59:26] I owe my life to him.
[59:33] Oh Jesus
[59:35] is the lighthouse.
[59:39] I'm safe from the rocks of sin.
[59:45] He has shown his light around me.
[59:57] [Music]
[1:00:13] Amen. God bless everyone. Looking
[1:00:16] forward to brother Israel being here for
[1:00:18] the evening service at 5. Sends his
[1:00:21] greetings of course and we pray God
[1:00:24] bless the his ministry there in Mesa.
[1:00:27] Today we're going to be listen to
[1:00:29] listening to Elijah and the meal
[1:00:32] offering 1960 Madison Square Garden in
[1:00:36] Phoenix
[1:00:38] and be about 59 minutes 1 hour and I
[1:00:42] know it'll be a blessing to everyone.
[1:00:45] Amen. God bless you all.
[1:01:03] Oh, isn't that true? Lord, I receive.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Receive what? Every promise that he
[1:01:12] made, it's mine.
[1:01:14] Now before we are seated, let us bow our
[1:01:18] heads just a moment so that I won't
[1:01:20] forget to pray over these handkerchiefs
[1:01:22] here.
[1:01:23] Our Lord, we are grateful to thee
[1:01:27] tonight
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; for the songs of Zion
[1:01:32] for the oldfashioned gospel that
[1:01:36] cleanses our hearts from evil.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. And for the most gracious promises
[1:01:43] in the Bible is ours. By faith we
[1:01:48] receive them.
[1:01:50] And we know that God is no respect of
[1:01:54] person.
[1:01:56] And in the generation that Paul lived
[1:02:00] in, the people so many were sick, they
[1:02:05] brought to him handkerchiefs, aprons,
[1:02:08] that he might uh put them on his body
[1:02:13] and then taken from his body to the sick
[1:02:16] and the afflicted. And the scriptures
[1:02:19] tell us that unclean spirits went out of
[1:02:22] the people and afflictions left them
[1:02:25] because of their faith
[1:02:29] in the Lord Jesus.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; God Paul has been gone for most 2,000
[1:02:37] years into your presence.
[1:02:40] That generation passed with him, but
[1:02:43] you're God of every generation.
[1:02:46] Now the people tonight as believed on
[1:02:49] thee and we are committing to thee
[1:02:52] tonight these handkerchiefs
[1:02:55] and little parcels of goods and
[1:02:57] believing with all of our heart that you
[1:03:01] will answer our prayer and they shall be
[1:03:04] healed.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord we send it to them for the
[1:03:09] glory of God in the name of Jesus his
[1:03:12] son. Amen.
[1:03:15] You may be seated. And those who put
[1:03:18] these up may come get them just
[1:03:20] immediately after this closing of the
[1:03:23] service.
[1:03:28] I am so happy. Uh tonight
[1:03:33] I've been out across the mountain there
[1:03:36] today as soon as I got through with the
[1:03:38] interviews that I had to have
[1:03:41] and went over to pray.
[1:03:44] And every time I get in this desert sun,
[1:03:47] it kind of makes me want to come back
[1:03:49] more. But
[1:03:52] one thing that I'm happy about tonight,
[1:03:55] my wife, as much as we have been
[1:03:58] together and she's seen the great
[1:04:00] visions of God manifested and come to
[1:04:03] pass, she was down at the river that day
[1:04:07] at Jeffersonville when the angel of the
[1:04:09] Lord made his first appearance that was
[1:04:10] packed on the Associated Press across
[1:04:13] the nation. It's been 1933.
[1:04:18] She was standing there but she heard the
[1:04:21] voice but didn't see the light or even
[1:04:25] the newspaper photographers saw the
[1:04:28] light but she was quite young then and
[1:04:31] about 12 years old and she never seen
[1:04:35] the light. She was watching the people.
[1:04:37] Many were fainting and it just stayed
[1:04:38] there just about one minute and then
[1:04:41] went right straight back up into the
[1:04:43] skies again. And the newspapers put a
[1:04:45] great article, mystic light appears over
[1:04:48] over a local Baptist minister while
[1:04:51] baptizing.
[1:04:53] Went all the way into Canada, got on the
[1:04:55] Canada Press. And then
[1:04:59] about three or four years ago when I was
[1:05:01] in Phoenix last,
[1:05:04] I believe it was brother Jack Moore was
[1:05:06] with me that he kind of my wife is very
[1:05:09] timid and so he called her to the
[1:05:12] platform unexpected and she liked to
[1:05:14] fainted and she come after I'd already
[1:05:18] gotten on the platform and the anointing
[1:05:20] was there for a healing service and she
[1:05:23] said first time she was ever in that
[1:05:25] presence.
[1:05:27] They're like that. And night before
[1:05:29] last, she saw him on the platform for
[1:05:32] the first time she's ever saw him. When
[1:05:35] it was here standing at the platform and
[1:05:37] when I met her outside, she would tears
[1:05:40] was in her eyes. And she said, "Billy,
[1:05:42] for the first time in my life, I saw
[1:05:44] it." She said, "I you was praying for a
[1:05:46] woman." And said, "I seen it just come
[1:05:49] right before." And stood there just a
[1:05:50] few moments, moved around where you was
[1:05:52] at. And then as soon as you stopped
[1:05:53] talking, it went away. So I'm happy for
[1:05:56] that that come before her eyes and that
[1:06:00] little lady has a lot to go through with
[1:06:03] and so I'm glad and happy for it. Now
[1:06:07] tomorrow night is healing service. You
[1:06:10] know we've been saying this week that
[1:06:11] healing services would come Friday
[1:06:13] night. I'll come tomorrow afternoon or
[1:06:17] or early in the evening about 6:00. So
[1:06:20] you want to interrupt the rest of the
[1:06:21] service and Billy, Leo, Jean, and Nam
[1:06:24] will be here with the prayer cards to
[1:06:26] give you a prayer card. That's when we
[1:06:28] bring the people on the platform and
[1:06:30] pray for them. Uh we are I am
[1:06:36] I have to carry the American meetings in
[1:06:38] the way the people has been taught
[1:06:40] laying on of hands. Now, that's that's
[1:06:43] scripture, but that's a Jewish tradition
[1:06:46] that isn't for the Gentiles. But the
[1:06:49] Gentiles carry it over. The Gentile was,
[1:06:53] "I'm not worthy that you come under my
[1:06:55] roof. Just speak the word, my servant
[1:06:58] live." That's right. But the Jew, come
[1:07:02] lay your hands upon my daughter and
[1:07:04] she'll live. See, that was their
[1:07:06] tradition. It was not for the Gentiles.
[1:07:09] Night after night and hour after hour
[1:07:11] through day and night, the Holy Spirit
[1:07:13] comes revealing or going through the
[1:07:15] buildings speaking the secrets of the
[1:07:17] hearts. You see it all the time. That's
[1:07:20] to let you know the presence of the Lord
[1:07:22] is here. Now, if you would just accept
[1:07:25] it, you get healed right then.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Cuz all the healing can ever be done for
[1:07:31] you is already finished. It has been for
[1:07:35] 1900 years. All the salvation that
[1:07:39] you'll ever receive has already been
[1:07:41] paid for. It's yours just to receive it.
[1:07:44] It's been 1,900 years or more since it
[1:07:47] was become salvation for you. But now
[1:07:51] you notice me on the meetings I say,
[1:07:54] will it make you believe? See, signs and
[1:07:58] wonders are not for healing or
[1:08:00] salvation, but it's to let the people
[1:08:03] realize and understand that the presence
[1:08:05] of God is here. Yes. Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Then he if he how it would be it's more
[1:08:11] of a miracle.
[1:08:12] We are simply just now beginning to see
[1:08:15] miracles. Now when it comes to a person
[1:08:18] they've been several of them get up off
[1:08:19] stretchers and wheelchairs and things
[1:08:22] and go out. That's not exactly a
[1:08:24] miracle.
[1:08:26] No. See, even Christian science has that
[1:08:31] it could be a a a mental condition that
[1:08:35] you could be change your way of
[1:08:36] thinking. Now, we don't believe it was
[1:08:38] because I believe it was faith. But yet,
[1:08:41] I was at La Salerain's France. I was at
[1:08:45] Paris
[1:08:47] and I went down to a place where they
[1:08:49] had a dead woman laying in there. She's
[1:08:52] buried. And they rubbed the rock there
[1:08:54] and people went in there with crippled
[1:08:56] crutches and laid them down and walked
[1:08:58] away from rubbing that rock over that
[1:08:59] dead woman. And she's dead
[1:09:04] and she can no more intercede that
[1:09:07] there's only one mediator between God
[1:09:09] and man, and that's Christ Jesus.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Coming out of a Catholic family, I I
[1:09:15] know that they believe in the people
[1:09:17] that die that that's their spirits are
[1:09:20] interceding for them. different ones.
[1:09:22] Some for politics and some for other
[1:09:24] things. To me, it's spiritualism. I
[1:09:26] ain't hurting your feelings. I hope
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; but I must be honest.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; See, anything that intercedes with the
[1:09:32] dead is spiritualism.
[1:09:34] They asked me that in Mexico. He said,
[1:09:35] "What about Jesus?" I said, "He's not
[1:09:37] dead. He raised again. He's alive
[1:09:39] forever more." See, he isn't dead. He's
[1:09:42] a living. The rest of them is passed
[1:09:44] beyond which the scripture says that
[1:09:46] they that are there cannot come here,
[1:09:48] and these that are here cannot go there.
[1:09:50] No man has ever crossed or ever will.
[1:09:53] So that settles it if the Jesus said so.
[1:09:57] But we find these things uh operating.
[1:10:01] So now in each night the Holy Spirit is
[1:10:04] trying to get to you the presence of his
[1:10:07] being here,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; not the presence of a man. A man can
[1:10:12] only humble himself by a gift. He can
[1:10:15] submit himself into a certain realm of
[1:10:17] the spirit that can open God to you. But
[1:10:21] it will never work until you yourself
[1:10:24] believe it and accept it and then it
[1:10:26] works. See, if you'd sit there and every
[1:10:29] one of you, every one of you be
[1:10:30] disbelieving, don't believe a word of
[1:10:32] it, it would never work.
[1:10:35] Jesus, when he went to his own company,
[1:10:37] his own country, many mighty works he
[1:10:40] could not do because of their unbelief.
[1:10:43] And if he could not do it then, he
[1:10:45] cannot do it now because of unbelief.
[1:10:47] See, it's your faith. So it takes you
[1:10:51] and I together with the Holy Spirit to
[1:10:54] bring these things to pass to let me
[1:10:57] rejoice to let you rejoice that God is
[1:11:00] here that keeps his word. But when the
[1:11:03] Holy Spirit can come into the meeting
[1:11:06] fulfilling exactly to the scripture what
[1:11:09] he said would take place in the last
[1:11:10] days and go out over the audience like
[1:11:13] he did when he was here and discern the
[1:11:16] very secrets of the hearts and the
[1:11:17] thoughts of the intents of the heart and
[1:11:19] the mind.
[1:11:21] How could anyone doubt?
[1:11:24] There's a perfect miracle.
[1:11:27] More of a miracle than a walking
[1:11:29] cuz it's impossible for that to happen
[1:11:31] without spiritual power.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It has to be a spiritual power to do
[1:11:35] that.
[1:11:37] So then you see just exactly what the
[1:11:39] Bible promised and what they what we
[1:11:42] believe. It's more of a miracle than
[1:11:44] shouting.
[1:11:47] It's more of a miracle than speaking
[1:11:48] with tongues. Paul said so. Even genuine
[1:11:51] Holy Spirit gives us speaking in
[1:11:53] tongues. It's more of a miracle than
[1:11:55] that. We're on the last miracle. It's
[1:11:59] predicted that way by the Bible. So
[1:12:01] tonight, you don't have to wait till
[1:12:02] tomorrow night to come through the line
[1:12:04] to be laid hands on. Now, laying hands
[1:12:06] on you will not do no more than the
[1:12:08] discerning of the thoughts of the heart.
[1:12:10] Not as much to me. Then you can just
[1:12:12] receive it. Hold on to it. It's yours.
[1:12:16] You believe it with all your heart. But
[1:12:18] tomorrow night if you the scripture does
[1:12:20] say go into all the world preach the
[1:12:22] gospel to every creature these signs
[1:12:25] shall follow them that believe all the
[1:12:27] signs then at last he said if they lay
[1:12:29] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:12:31] recover that's true lay the that will
[1:12:34] follow the believers all right now we we
[1:12:38] are believers so that way we have night
[1:12:40] after night of laying hands on the sick
[1:12:43] and God has worked great miracles with
[1:12:45] them we've had great miracles with
[1:12:47] praying over the handkerchief We've had
[1:12:49] great miracles with the discerning of
[1:12:50] the thoughts of the heart. See, all of
[1:12:53] it together works to God's glory.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; It isn't for man. It isn't for church.
[1:12:59] It's for God's glory. God's glory. Now,
[1:13:02] before we open the word now, for the
[1:13:04] night, oh, we can turn back the pages
[1:13:06] like this. But God has to open it.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture is no private
[1:13:12] interpretation. But the Holy Spirit that
[1:13:15] wrote the scripture is the interpretator
[1:13:17] thereof. So let us bow our heads now
[1:13:20] while we pray. And how many would like
[1:13:22] to be remembered in the prayer? Would
[1:13:24] you just let it be known by your hands
[1:13:25] lifted? Whatever it is, oh God, look, we
[1:13:28] all need, don't we? I'm needy, too,
[1:13:30] friends. I got my hands up.
[1:13:33] Heavenly Father, humbly and quietly and
[1:13:37] reverently we come into thy great august
[1:13:41] presence,
[1:13:43] knowing before that one thing happens,
[1:13:46] you are here because you promised to be.
[1:13:50] You said before you're going away,
[1:13:54] wherever that two or three are gathered
[1:13:57] in my name, there I'll be in their
[1:14:00] midst.
[1:14:01] And if they shall agree upon any single
[1:14:05] thing as touching one thing, ask they
[1:14:08] shall receive.
[1:14:10] Lord, to bring your promise to this the
[1:14:16] purchase of thy blood, I ask that every
[1:14:19] man, woman, or child that raise their
[1:14:22] hands tonight, you know their heart. May
[1:14:25] they receive what they're asking for.
[1:14:30] Granted, Lord, we are a needy people.
[1:14:34] We're walking in a dark world with a
[1:14:38] great enemy of yours that we could not
[1:14:41] combat with him at all if it wasn't for
[1:14:44] your Holy Spirit.
[1:14:46] Therefore, we are trusting,
[1:14:49] believing,
[1:14:50] and acting in faith that he'll go before
[1:14:54] us and make the way clear.
[1:14:57] So many pitfalls along the road set for
[1:15:01] our weary feet.
[1:15:04] But we are trying to follow the bloody
[1:15:07] footprints of him who overcome death,
[1:15:11] hell, and the grave.
[1:15:14] Guide us tonight by thy holy spirit,
[1:15:17] Lord, to the words that should be said.
[1:15:20] Then guide the words to the heart that
[1:15:23] is needy of them.
[1:15:26] Then Lord may at the end of the meeting
[1:15:29] and we start to our different homes
[1:15:33] may we be able to say again like those
[1:15:35] who came from Emmas did not our hearts
[1:15:38] burn within us as he talked to us along
[1:15:42] the way for we ask it in Jesus' name and
[1:15:46] for his sake. Amen.
[1:15:51] To you who are keeping down the
[1:15:54] scriptures, turn with me now to the book
[1:15:57] of first kings. I wish to read a portion
[1:16:01] out of the 17th verse, 17th chapter
[1:16:04] rather.
[1:16:09] Now I'm going to begin at the 14th
[1:16:12] verse. Read the 14th, 15th, and 16th
[1:16:16] verses of the 17th chapter of First
[1:16:19] Kings.
[1:16:24] For thus saeth the Lord God of Israel,
[1:16:27] the barrel of meal shall not waste,
[1:16:30] neither shall the cru of all fail
[1:16:35] until the day the Lord sent rain upon
[1:16:38] the earth.
[1:16:40] And she went and did according to the
[1:16:43] saying of Elijah.
[1:16:46] And she and he and her house did eat
[1:16:50] many days. And the barrel of meal wasted
[1:16:54] not, neither did the cruc of all fail,
[1:16:58] according to the word of the Lord, which
[1:17:02] he spake by Elijah.
[1:17:14] It must have been almost daylight
[1:17:19] when she was awakened.
[1:17:23] She turned her weary head on the pillow
[1:17:25] when she heard a mournful little cry
[1:17:28] across the room.
[1:17:32] And she had not been able to sleep. All
[1:17:35] night she was tossed about because
[1:17:38] of this great tragedy.
[1:17:43] The little boy had waken again not being
[1:17:46] asleep over 20 or 30 minutes. And
[1:17:50] I can hear his little boy say, "Mama,
[1:17:54] won't you go out and look in the pantry
[1:17:57] again and see if there isn't just one
[1:17:59] little piece of bread?
[1:18:02] I'm so hungry. I just can't sleep.
[1:18:08] And as she looked in his little face
[1:18:11] with the his little sanking cheeks and
[1:18:14] his little eyes turning yellow,
[1:18:19] his long hair hanging down from failing
[1:18:22] to be cut, his little ragged night
[1:18:25] shirt,
[1:18:27] the big tears from her eyes spat up on
[1:18:30] his little face.
[1:18:32] as she patted him on the cheek and said,
[1:18:34] "Darling, try to go to sleep and
[1:18:37] understand."
[1:18:42] There had been three years. There had
[1:18:44] been no rain on the earth.
[1:18:51] She knelt down on the floor. I can see
[1:18:53] her as she cried out to God.
[1:18:57] She said, "Oh Lord God, uh Jehovah,
[1:19:03] thou art the God of our fathers, who has
[1:19:05] fed thy children and cared for them
[1:19:08] through the years.
[1:19:11] And I've tried to live true and upright
[1:19:14] to thee,
[1:19:17] and now I am here seeing my little boy
[1:19:22] crying for something to eat and nothing
[1:19:24] to give him.
[1:19:28] For many weeks now, we've been louning
[1:19:30] ourselves
[1:19:32] up to a place of one meal every three or
[1:19:35] four days. And now it's all gone but one
[1:19:40] little handful of meal and just a
[1:19:43] spoonful of oil.
[1:19:45] And I'm trying to hold it off until
[1:19:49] daylight
[1:19:51] that we'll not have to die while it is
[1:19:53] in the night.
[1:19:56] What have I done? Oh God,
[1:20:00] I your hands made has lived true.
[1:20:06] My husband was lost in battle the battle
[1:20:09] for the Lord.
[1:20:12] And I've been a widow for several years
[1:20:14] now. and I've tried to live right and
[1:20:17] keep your commandments.
[1:20:21] And if it's my time to go, I don't mind.
[1:20:24] But my little boy, it just tears my
[1:20:28] heart to pieces to hear him beg for
[1:20:31] something to eat with nothing to give
[1:20:33] me.
[1:20:36] When she got finished praying, she
[1:20:38] raised up. He'd gone back to sleep again
[1:20:41] for a few moments and she had her arms
[1:20:44] up and the ragged night gown that she
[1:20:48] was wearing was just about gone.
[1:20:51] She goes to the window and looks out and
[1:20:54] it's just about to break day. Oh, it was
[1:20:58] so hot. The hot winds of judgment was
[1:21:02] blowing upon a nation that had forgotten
[1:21:05] God.
[1:21:08] That was during the reign of Ahab,
[1:21:11] Israel's most cruel and wicked king.
[1:21:17] And he married a sinner, Jezebel, which
[1:21:21] was an idoltor. And a mixed wedding like
[1:21:24] that never is successful.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; It just can't be. Either the woman will
[1:21:31] come the man's way or the man will go
[1:21:33] the woman's way. And she was a very
[1:21:37] attractive little woman. And Ahab just
[1:21:41] kind of a lukewarm believer had give in
[1:21:44] to her ideas and said, "Oh, well,
[1:21:47] religion is nothing for me. I'm a king."
[1:21:51] And long had they tore down the altars
[1:21:56] of God and put up the altars of Balum or
[1:21:59] Baal rather.
[1:22:03] And the cry had been so much against the
[1:22:06] true religion till the ministers under
[1:22:09] the great strain had given away.
[1:22:14] Some time ago I made a remark about
[1:22:16] ministers or something other in this day
[1:22:19] and a group met me and said brother
[1:22:21] Brandham
[1:22:23] our congregations just pulls on to us.
[1:22:27] That's what causes it.
[1:22:30] The congregation will walk out if the
[1:22:34] minister don't please them.
[1:22:36] And so long had the ministers fell under
[1:22:40] the impact of the king because sin was
[1:22:45] permitted. There was no limits.
[1:22:49] It's a very good picture of today.
[1:22:52] Because the nation had endorsed these
[1:22:55] things. The people wanted to be popular.
[1:22:58] They thought as long as the nation said
[1:23:00] so, it was all right.
[1:23:04] That's the way they say today.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; As long as the nation says it's all
[1:23:10] right to sell beer, then it's all right
[1:23:12] to drink it. If the nation permits our
[1:23:15] women to half-dress on the street, the
[1:23:17] law won't run them in, but it's all
[1:23:19] right to do it. That might be all right
[1:23:21] to the nation, but in God's great books,
[1:23:24] you're responsible and will have to
[1:23:26] answer before God.
[1:23:30] But they had fallen, had to give away
[1:23:32] under the load.
[1:23:35] And the nation was prospering
[1:23:38] and they thought that prosperity
[1:23:41] was a sign that God was with them.
[1:23:44] That's not altogether the truth.
[1:23:48] God comes to you. Use an old proverb,
[1:23:51] God dishonoring proverb
[1:23:54] that says that God helps those who help
[1:23:57] themselves.
[1:23:59] That's dishonorable to God.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; God helps those who cannot help
[1:24:05] themselves.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; He is a God of those who needs mercy
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; and he is a merciful God.
[1:24:16] God.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; And that proverb that says that he helps
[1:24:20] those who help themselves. If you can
[1:24:22] help yourself, you don't need his help.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; But he helps those who cannot help
[1:24:28] themselves.
[1:24:31] But the nation had thought as long as
[1:24:34] they were eating good and were well
[1:24:37] clothed that everything would be all
[1:24:39] right.
[1:24:41] But there was one who still was
[1:24:43] oldfashioned
[1:24:45] that believed that there was a God that
[1:24:48] was oldfashioned.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Believe that there was a God that kept
[1:24:53] his word.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Believed that the God of Abraham, Isaac,
[1:24:58] and Jacob was holy and required re
[1:25:02] complete surrender to his holiness.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; But Jezebel and her modernistic crew
[1:25:09] hated him.
[1:25:11] He was their pastor, but they didn't
[1:25:13] believe it. So, he had to hide for his
[1:25:16] life.
[1:25:18] And God had sent him up on the mountain
[1:25:20] and said, give him a message and said,
[1:25:22] "Go down and tell that old wicked king,
[1:25:27] thus saith the Lord, it's not going to
[1:25:30] rain or even to do a fall until you call
[1:25:35] for it."
[1:25:37] give it into Elisha's mouth to call for
[1:25:40] the rain when it was time for it. But he
[1:25:42] had the keys of heaven. He could close
[1:25:46] it
[1:25:48] or open it. And he said, "I want you to
[1:25:50] go up out of the wilderness of this into
[1:25:54] the wilderness rather out of this chaos.
[1:25:58] Get out from among them. You preach to
[1:26:00] them and they won't listen to you and
[1:26:02] they're continually getting worse. Go on
[1:26:05] up into the wilderness and they're set
[1:26:07] down by the brook Cherith and I already
[1:26:11] commanded the ravens to take care of
[1:26:13] you. Oh,
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; if the people walk, God's got crows that
[1:26:19] can do it.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; John said God's able of these stones to
[1:26:25] rise children unto Abraham.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "If they hold their
[1:26:29] piece of rocks will immediately cry out,
[1:26:32] God can do what he wants to."
[1:26:36] He said, "I've commanded the ravens and
[1:26:38] they're going to feed you." And they
[1:26:41] brought him flesh and bread.
[1:26:45] Someone said one time, "Where did they
[1:26:47] get it, Brother Brandham?" I said, "I
[1:26:49] don't know. The only thing I know they
[1:26:52] brought it." Amen.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; They got it from the same place that
[1:26:56] Jesus did when he took five fish and or
[1:27:00] five biscuits and two fish and fed 5
[1:27:02] thousands.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; It come from the same creative hand of
[1:27:07] God Almighty.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; They brought him fish and bread. The
[1:27:13] crows
[1:27:15] sat down and handed over to Elisha and
[1:27:18] he ate it and stooped down and drank
[1:27:21] from the fountain. God was resting his
[1:27:23] prophet.
[1:27:26] Oh, I'm so glad that God has a way of
[1:27:29] escape.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And when they thought he was crazy, that
[1:27:33] old prophet,
[1:27:35] an old
[1:27:37] killjoy,
[1:27:38] always trying to take the joy out of
[1:27:40] their little happy parties they were
[1:27:43] having, tell them it was sin.
[1:27:47] And God him following God's commission
[1:27:51] went up into the mountains and sat down
[1:27:54] on the high place, the driest place in
[1:27:57] the country. But God kept the brook
[1:27:59] running
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; and they were down there knowing their
[1:28:02] tongue for water.
[1:28:06] You know, God has a way of answering
[1:28:09] prayers.
[1:28:11] This little woman had lived true.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; She had not remarried again. She was
[1:28:18] staying single to meet her husband in
[1:28:21] glory.
[1:28:23] She was an honorable woman.
[1:28:26] And for weeks the barrel had been going
[1:28:29] down, down and her continually praying
[1:28:34] and still looked like there was no hope
[1:28:37] in sight, nowhere.
[1:28:40] You know there we can get a lesson from
[1:28:42] that
[1:28:44] that if you have prayed and met all the
[1:28:48] requirements that God requires you to
[1:28:51] meet
[1:28:52] and still is silent.
[1:28:55] He doesn't say anything and yet you've
[1:28:57] met the requirements.
[1:29:00] Now what happens then? If you know that
[1:29:03] you have met his requirements and you've
[1:29:06] done all that you know to do, then faith
[1:29:11] doesn't waver. It just sits still and
[1:29:14] thinks positive.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Faith takes its everlasting grip around
[1:29:19] the rock of ages
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; and doesn't move.
[1:29:24] That great fella called faith.
[1:29:29] I've often said faith's got hair on the
[1:29:31] chest.
[1:29:33] When he speaks, everything else shuts
[1:29:36] up.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; When faith says shut up, then everything
[1:29:41] stops cuz he's the boss.
[1:29:46] And she had met every requirement. She'd
[1:29:48] live clean. She lived decent. She lived
[1:29:51] honorable.
[1:29:53] And she had met all of God's
[1:29:55] requirements.
[1:29:56] but looked like he was silent.
[1:30:00] God does that sometime to test you to
[1:30:03] see what kind of a reaction you'll have.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. You pass over the
[1:30:11] platform, you're prayed for and hands
[1:30:14] laid on you, seems like nothing happens.
[1:30:16] That doesn't stop faith one bit.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; You have met God's requirements. Now if
[1:30:22] you have met them now if you're holding
[1:30:25] back on God you know your heart condemns
[1:30:28] you and we know if our heart condemns us
[1:30:31] not then we have
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; now but if our heart condemns us there's
[1:30:36] no need of coming across the platform
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; there's no need of asking God for
[1:30:40] anything because you don't have faith to
[1:30:43] receive it
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; but when you have met every requirement
[1:30:47] that God requires then faith steps out
[1:30:50] there and said God is God. I've met the
[1:30:52] requirements. The scripture says, "They
[1:30:55] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:30:57] their strength.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; They shall mount up with wings as an
[1:31:01] eagle.
[1:31:03] They shall run and not be weary. Walk
[1:31:06] and not faint."
[1:31:08] As the song says, "Teach me Lord." Oh,
[1:31:12] teach me Lord how to wait.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Get my soul washed in the blood of
[1:31:18] Calvary. meet every requirement. Burn
[1:31:21] all the bridges around and say now Lord
[1:31:23] nothing in my arms I bring
[1:31:28] simply to thy cross I claim. You
[1:31:31] promised it Lord.
[1:31:34] That's the kind of condition the reason
[1:31:37] people think that I'm an isolationist.
[1:31:40] But in the room or over on the side of
[1:31:43] the desert, that's a condition you've
[1:31:45] got to get into before you walk into
[1:31:46] this pulpit year. Amen.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Because Satan's always dropping in
[1:31:53] little imps to try to upset something.
[1:31:56] And you must be right holding on to the
[1:31:59] cross, not trusting your own ability,
[1:32:03] your own thoughts, just leaning on the
[1:32:06] everlasting.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Claiming no intelligence, claiming no
[1:32:13] mind or your own. You're just opening
[1:32:15] yourself and let the Holy Spirit speak.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's the condition God wants his
[1:32:23] church in.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Getting that condition.
[1:32:28] God tries you. Every son that cometh to
[1:32:32] God must first be tried,
[1:32:35] chasened
[1:32:37] to see if he can stand chastisement. If
[1:32:40] we walk up and say, "I believe that
[1:32:43] Jesus Christ is the son of God."
[1:32:46] That he died for my sins and rose again
[1:32:50] the third day, he was wounded for my
[1:32:52] transgressions, bruised for my
[1:32:55] iniquities, the chast of my pieces upon
[1:32:58] him, and with his stripes I am healed.
[1:33:02] When you say that with a confessed all
[1:33:05] your sins and your iniquities and your
[1:33:08] abilities and all that you have lay on
[1:33:11] the altar,
[1:33:14] then there with nothing in your arm,
[1:33:16] Satan's going to shoot every dart at you
[1:33:18] he can.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; But then if you turn aside from that and
[1:33:22] say, "Well, maybe I didn't get saved.
[1:33:25] Maybe I didn't get healed." Then turn
[1:33:28] away from that. The Bible said you are
[1:33:30] illegitimate children and not the
[1:33:33] children of God. God test every son of
[1:33:36] Abraham like he did Abraham for we are
[1:33:39] Abraham's seed by being dead in Christ.
[1:33:42] We are Abraham's seed and are hes
[1:33:45] according to the promise.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed. That's the spirit that
[1:33:51] Abraham had. He had the promise given in
[1:33:54] him. Our father trusted God and took a
[1:33:59] promise and impossibility and held on to
[1:34:01] it for 25 years before it was ever
[1:34:04] manifested. Getting stronger all the
[1:34:06] time. His seed just like the father.
[1:34:10] No matter what happens when we're prayed
[1:34:12] for, it's settled.
[1:34:14] When we get everything out of the way,
[1:34:18] met all requirements, get everything out
[1:34:20] of the way, then ask God, and stand
[1:34:22] there knowing you're going to receive
[1:34:24] it.
[1:34:27] God tested Job like that. When Job asked
[1:34:31] for mercy, offered a sacrifice for his
[1:34:33] children, the only thing that that
[1:34:37] prophet had was a burnt offering, but
[1:34:40] that was all God required.
[1:34:44] God doesn't require education and a lot
[1:34:47] of nonsense. He requires a surrendered
[1:34:51] heart to his will.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; He doesn't ask you to dress in a certain
[1:34:56] way or or go to certain things or to out
[1:35:00] of certain colleges or degrees. He asked
[1:35:02] for a humble contrite broken spirit and
[1:35:06] a willing heart to receive him.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] He tried Job and see what kind of a
[1:35:14] reaction he would find in him. But when
[1:35:17] he took his sheep and tuck his ox and
[1:35:20] tuck his camels and tuck his children,
[1:35:23] I'll see what Job says now.
[1:35:26] And he said, "The Lord gave and the Lord
[1:35:29] taken away. Blessed be the name of the
[1:35:31] Lord."
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; He found what he had told Satan he had
[1:35:37] in Job. none like him on the earth.
[1:35:41] Then the thunders begin to roar, the
[1:35:44] lightnings begin to flash, the spirit
[1:35:47] come upon the prophet. And he screamed,
[1:35:49] "I know my redeemer liveth."
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; And at the last days he'll stand on the
[1:35:54] earth. Though the skin worms destroys
[1:35:56] this body, yet in my flesh I shall see
[1:35:59] God whom I shall see for myself, mine
[1:36:02] eye shall behold and not another.
[1:36:05] He tested the Hebrew children to see
[1:36:07] what kind of a reaction they had had.
[1:36:09] They had confessed among the heathens
[1:36:12] that there was a living God.
[1:36:15] There was a Jehovah God
[1:36:18] and that he was God of heaven and God of
[1:36:21] earth.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; And he held every soul in his hand.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; So God let them be tested. And they had
[1:36:30] met all the requirements. said prayed up
[1:36:32] and got everything out of the way and
[1:36:35] they would not bow down to the king's
[1:36:38] image and he had the furnace seven times
[1:36:41] hotter than it ever was.
[1:36:43] I no doubt that Satan was trying to tell
[1:36:45] them this is the end of the road.
[1:36:48] I like the way they thought
[1:36:51] our God is able to deliver us from that
[1:36:54] fiery furnace.
[1:36:57] But nevertheless, if he does not, we'll
[1:36:59] not break God's commandments. We'll stay
[1:37:03] true.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Let our faith ring out through the years
[1:37:07] to come.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; That we stayed true to the promise of
[1:37:10] God.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; My God is able to heal me from this or
[1:37:14] my God's able to take me from this
[1:37:16] wheelchair. My God's able to do this.
[1:37:18] But I've accepted him as my healer. I've
[1:37:21] confessed my sins, my unbelief, and
[1:37:24] confessed that I believe that he is my
[1:37:25] healer. Let come, let go what may. If
[1:37:28] I'm not well today, I will be tomorrow.
[1:37:30] If I'm not tomorrow, I'll be next year.
[1:37:33] The Lord gave in the Lord take it away.
[1:37:36] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; There it was. And when they walked into
[1:37:45] the fiery furnace under trial,
[1:37:49] under a test, they held true to the end.
[1:37:52] But God was there just in a spare of a
[1:37:55] moment
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; and he delivered them. They know that
[1:37:59] they were prayed up. Their sins were
[1:38:01] confessed. They know they met every
[1:38:03] requirement. And yet he seemed to be
[1:38:05] silent. He's only silent to test you
[1:38:10] to see really what you are. What's on
[1:38:12] the inside of you? See if you really
[1:38:15] mean from your heart what you're saying
[1:38:16] with your lips.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Let that go deep.
[1:38:22] We can say with our lips, but is our
[1:38:24] heart saying
[1:38:27] now when this little woman know that she
[1:38:30] had met all these requirements and still
[1:38:33] God was silent. Seemed like he didn't
[1:38:36] even care for it. He didn't care where
[1:38:38] she lived or died.
[1:38:41] But all the time God was working.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; She didn't know about it. But God told
[1:38:48] Elijah he'd dry up the brook, reached
[1:38:50] out his hand and stopped the brook from
[1:38:52] running. And Elijah said, "Lord, why did
[1:38:55] it stop?" He said, "I've commanded a
[1:38:57] widow woman to feed you."
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; He had already commanded her. She didn't
[1:39:02] know it.
[1:39:04] He might have commanded of you a
[1:39:06] testimony of your healing. You might not
[1:39:09] know it, but just hang on. When you are
[1:39:12] sure that you met all the requirements,
[1:39:15] when you know that you've done
[1:39:17] everything that you know to do and laid
[1:39:19] yourself before God, there's only one
[1:39:21] thing to do is hang on to his promised
[1:39:23] land.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Stay there. God promised to answer.
[1:39:29] He'll do it. You don't know what he's
[1:39:31] commanded, what angel, or what to do. It
[1:39:35] may be this night before the healing
[1:39:36] service starts tomorrow night. God might
[1:39:39] have seen your condition today. He might
[1:39:42] have heard your prayer.
[1:39:46] I felt so sorry for these deaf and dumb
[1:39:48] people. I want to lay hands on them and
[1:39:50] pray for them.
[1:39:52] Started to stop last night, but I said
[1:39:54] that wouldn't be right to the rest of
[1:39:55] them. But how do I know that somewhere
[1:39:58] in a silent God who knows the heart,
[1:40:03] these people has met their requirement
[1:40:04] of God and they're ready? There's an
[1:40:07] angel here tonight to deliver them from
[1:40:10] all their affliction.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; How do I know God might have commanded
[1:40:14] their deliverance tonight?
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Whether I prayed for the sick or not,
[1:40:18] they'll get it because God has required
[1:40:20] it.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; Be sure of God. Then hold on.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Meet his requirements.
[1:40:28] God knows how to do things that's right.
[1:40:33] Knows how to do it in the right way.
[1:40:36] Now, it's a very strange thing that God
[1:40:38] would send his prophet to a widow
[1:40:41] woman's house.
[1:40:43] What a place. But she must have been a
[1:40:46] real virtuous woman or he had never sent
[1:40:49] his prophet there.
[1:40:52] Oh, if a person was worthy, would have
[1:40:56] to be a worthy person to entertain a man
[1:40:59] like Elijah.
[1:41:02] You remember it was Zachariah in his
[1:41:04] house and he had been loyal and true
[1:41:07] waiting for God to give them a child and
[1:41:10] the angel Gabriel come to the house.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; It was Virgin Mary who'd live clean and
[1:41:15] pure and waiting for a promise of God
[1:41:18] that he sent an angel to.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Talk about run around with the world and
[1:41:23] flirt with the world and then expect to
[1:41:25] see angels and have miracles done. It's
[1:41:27] out of God's program. Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; You must live right. Clean up the house.
[1:41:32] Clean up your habits. Clean up the
[1:41:34] things of the world. Get rid of your
[1:41:36] cards and your worldly association. Get
[1:41:40] ready. And then the angel of God can
[1:41:41] speak and say, "Fear not. It's I."
[1:41:45] Then things take place.
[1:41:48] But he
[1:41:50] the little woman was down praying, not
[1:41:52] knowing that walking down the mountain.
[1:41:54] Come the prophet.
[1:41:56] He'd had a vision. where to go to. God
[1:42:00] don't lead his people blindly. He tells
[1:42:02] them where they're going.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; He was looking into the city. Oh, it was
[1:42:07] terrible. People were starving to death
[1:42:09] and screaming for water. Hungry people.
[1:42:12] It's a reflection of immorality.
[1:42:14] It's a reflection of sin. And this
[1:42:17] nation's in part.
[1:42:20] You can't. The balance is even the law
[1:42:23] of nature. would not let it be when
[1:42:25] we're wake when we're wasting money with
[1:42:27] rowdiest living and half of the world
[1:42:30] starving to death. They're all human
[1:42:32] beings to which Christ died for.
[1:42:36] That's the reason the mission fields is
[1:42:38] on my heart. You have wonderful
[1:42:40] ministers here in Phoenix and all around
[1:42:42] over the United States and places
[1:42:44] churches on every corner. Great man of
[1:42:47] God healing services. great man like or
[1:42:50] Robertson, other great man preaching and
[1:42:53] there's people over yonder dying by the
[1:42:56] thousands every day that never heard of
[1:42:58] the name of Jesus. Poor little dirty
[1:43:01] hungry negroes way down in Africa and
[1:43:04] over in India, little fellas laying on
[1:43:06] the street dying don't even know what
[1:43:08] God means.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Then we argue about our little
[1:43:12] differences of religious belief.
[1:43:17] Oh, it's not just exactly right, I don't
[1:43:19] think, friends, if it's on your heart to
[1:43:22] see that. Now, notice
[1:43:27] this poor little woman after she had
[1:43:30] looked out the window and saw that it
[1:43:32] was about to break day.
[1:43:35] Little did she know what was waiting for
[1:43:37] her.
[1:43:38] She was thinking it was death for her
[1:43:41] and her little boy. So I while she's
[1:43:44] asleep, let's just look at her for a few
[1:43:46] minutes. She goes after you, she prays
[1:43:49] and she strokes his little hair back out
[1:43:51] of his eyes and said, "Darling little
[1:43:53] fellow, you look so much like your
[1:43:55] precious sainted daddy. How he trusted
[1:43:58] God, how he gave his life for the cause
[1:44:01] of Israel out on the battlefield. And
[1:44:04] you look so much like him." And honey, I
[1:44:06] don't know why the innocent suffer with
[1:44:08] the guilty, but they do.
[1:44:12] this nation, Christians will suffer
[1:44:14] because of unrighteousness and politics.
[1:44:17] Make the whole nation suffer.
[1:44:20] Now, I can see her go in and say, "I'll
[1:44:24] fix the little cake now. I've got just
[1:44:26] enough for one little cake of of bread
[1:44:30] left, and when we eat it, then we'll
[1:44:32] die." So, she goes into the room and
[1:44:37] takes the meal out of the meal barrel. I
[1:44:39] can see her just dusting it with that
[1:44:41] little bony hand as she strikes across
[1:44:43] the little tag that it was in, beating
[1:44:46] it out, every bit of dust. And she
[1:44:48] finally got just enough for one cake,
[1:44:51] goes over to the little cru and holds it
[1:44:53] up and drains every bit of the oil out
[1:44:56] of it. About a spoonful.
[1:44:59] Now the meal,
[1:45:01] all those things has a meaning.
[1:45:04] Meal represented Christ.
[1:45:08] Christ was the meal offering. When they
[1:45:12] ground the meal for the wave offering
[1:45:14] for Christ, which was Christ in the wave
[1:45:16] offering in the Old Testament, they've
[1:45:19] ground it with a certain type of burr,
[1:45:22] that every little piece of meal must be
[1:45:24] cut just the same because Jesus Christ
[1:45:28] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:45:32] forever.
[1:45:34] You remember when some of the schools up
[1:45:37] there didn't know the difference between
[1:45:39] gourds and peas and throwed some wild
[1:45:42] gourds in a pottage of peas to cook. And
[1:45:44] they cried out, "There's death in the
[1:45:46] pot." Elijah got a handful of meal,
[1:45:50] cast it into the pot, and said, "Eat."
[1:45:54] What did the meal do? The meal in the
[1:45:57] pot changed it from death to life.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; From a deathgiving resource to a
[1:46:03] lifegiving resource. God.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing it is tonight.
[1:46:07] When there's death in your vessel,
[1:46:11] Christ thrown into your vessel. Raise
[1:46:13] you from death unto life.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Christ makes the difference.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Coming into the human heart. Oh, he
[1:46:23] gives a peace that passes understanding
[1:46:25] and also it gives life eternal. He that
[1:46:28] believeth on the son has eternal life
[1:46:30] and shall never perish.
[1:46:33] Now she got the meal which represented
[1:46:37] Christ and Christ is the word. In the
[1:46:41] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:46:43] with God and the word was God and the
[1:46:47] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Christ the meal offering. Then she went
[1:46:53] and got the oral and the oral represents
[1:46:55] the spirit. So she put the word and the
[1:46:58] spirit together and begin to mix it up.
[1:47:01] Glory to God.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, something has to happen when that
[1:47:05] takes place.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Let it be tonight that the word that I'm
[1:47:11] preaching falls into your heart. Then
[1:47:13] let the Holy Spirit get in there and go
[1:47:15] to mixing that up. Watch what takes
[1:47:17] place.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you put the word and
[1:47:20] the spirit together, Jesus said to the
[1:47:23] woman at the well, "Woman, I tell you
[1:47:26] the time is coming and now is when God
[1:47:29] requires worship in the spirit and in
[1:47:32] the truth and he is the truth."
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; The meal, look what she did. She mixed
[1:47:39] the word and the spirit together. Many
[1:47:42] people had the spirit without the word.
[1:47:45] Some has the word without the spirit.
[1:47:47] But you take put them both correctly in
[1:47:49] their place. There's a cake on the road.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; There's something in the making. Poor
[1:47:56] little widow didn't know what she's
[1:47:57] doing. But God said to Elijah, "I have
[1:48:00] commanded her."
[1:48:02] And Elijah's on his road over the
[1:48:04] cobblestones coming down to see his
[1:48:06] vision fulfilled somewhere. And here she
[1:48:09] is standing there tears. She wiping with
[1:48:11] her old ragged sleeve and saying, "Oh
[1:48:14] Jehovah God, my faith has never failed
[1:48:17] and it won't fail." Somehow or another,
[1:48:19] I don't know how all this is, but we are
[1:48:21] taught that all things work together for
[1:48:23] the good. She's mixing this little meal
[1:48:26] up. She got the little cake all fixed
[1:48:28] out and patted up. She said, "Now it's
[1:48:30] time for me to go out and get some
[1:48:31] wood." She goes back and opens the door
[1:48:34] and said, "Oh Lord, that poor little
[1:48:37] hungry belly laying there and I haven't
[1:48:40] eaten for two or three weeks. I'll give
[1:48:42] him my piece of cake." That's a mother.
[1:48:45] A mother's love for her baby. There's
[1:48:48] nothing like it. Only God's love.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; A mother may forget her sucking bait,
[1:48:53] but never can I forget you. Your names
[1:48:55] are engraved on the palms of my hands.
[1:48:59] How can he forget you? I'll never
[1:49:03] forsake thee or never leave thee. I'll
[1:49:07] be with thee always, even to the end of
[1:49:10] the world.
[1:49:12] There she looks at her baby. Maybe she
[1:49:15] slipped back and kissed his little
[1:49:16] forehead. Whether she fainted and died
[1:49:19] on the outside,
[1:49:21] she goes out. It's just beginning to
[1:49:23] kind of sun begin to rise over the
[1:49:26] Judeian hills. And she looks at the sun
[1:49:29] begin to peep up way down the street.
[1:49:31] She hears cursing and going on. And she
[1:49:34] goes out in the yard and noticed she
[1:49:37] picked up two sticks.
[1:49:40] Not an arm load. Two sticks. What is it?
[1:49:43] The cross.
[1:49:46] Now anyone knows any of my Indian
[1:49:49] friends here know or any hunter the
[1:49:52] correct way of making a fire to last is
[1:49:55] cross two sticks two logs light it right
[1:49:58] in the middle just keep pushing the ends
[1:50:00] in it'll last all night many time have I
[1:50:03] laid in the wilderness with two sticks
[1:50:05] no bigger than that and keep warm all
[1:50:07] night just enough to keep warm keep it
[1:50:09] going right in the center of it now
[1:50:12] what's she going to do light these two
[1:50:14] sticks and the Word and the spirit is
[1:50:19] brought to self-sacrifice on the cross,
[1:50:23] ready for duty, ready for life, putting
[1:50:27] the word and the spirit. That's her
[1:50:31] faith in the word of God by the Holy
[1:50:34] Ghost leading herself to sacrifice
[1:50:36] anything else to the cross.
[1:50:40] And when she got the stick under her
[1:50:42] arm, two of them, and started back, she
[1:50:44] started back. And there was a voice came
[1:50:46] from the gate.
[1:50:49] Lady, just before that, an old maybe
[1:50:53] baldheaded and gray hanging over his
[1:50:56] whiskers and his hair hanging down, a
[1:50:58] little stick in his hand, an old sheep
[1:51:01] skin or something wrapped around him,
[1:51:02] walking down the street saying, "Lord,
[1:51:04] it's a certain little white fence.
[1:51:07] There'll be a lovely looking young
[1:51:08] woman. She must have been young. The boy
[1:51:10] was young out in the yard. You told me
[1:51:13] that was the widow that was to feed me.
[1:51:16] Now, where is she at? I'll keep walking.
[1:51:18] The spirit leads him this way, then
[1:51:20] turns him. Oh, it's so wonderful. Sons
[1:51:23] of God are led by the spirit of God. No
[1:51:26] matter how silly it sounds, they are
[1:51:29] led.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; She go he goes down one street and up
[1:51:32] another. Down one street and up another.
[1:51:35] After a while, the spirit said, "Look to
[1:51:36] your right." And he looks it around like
[1:51:39] that just like he does here at the
[1:51:40] platform night after night.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, God's still the same.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Look to your right, to your left.
[1:51:51] There's someone praying who needs it.
[1:51:54] And he looked to his right and say,
[1:51:56] "There's a little white fence. That's
[1:51:58] just right. I just won't move from here
[1:52:01] because there's the old tree standing
[1:52:03] there. There's everything just the way I
[1:52:05] saw in the vision." The door opens. A
[1:52:07] little thin woman comes out. Now
[1:52:09] remember, she's just going to pick up
[1:52:10] two sticks. She couldn't have picked up
[1:52:12] three. Takes two to make the cross. She
[1:52:16] picked up two sticks and put her on her
[1:52:17] arm. And she started back thinking, I'll
[1:52:19] have the little cake done when Sunny
[1:52:21] wakes up. And then I'll feed it to him.
[1:52:24] I won't eat any myself now. I'll put my
[1:52:25] little boy in my arms and there will sit
[1:52:27] and die. And she started into the house.
[1:52:30] She heard a strange voice across the
[1:52:32] gate said, "Woman,
[1:52:35] would you fetch me a little drink of
[1:52:38] water
[1:52:40] in a vessel?"
[1:52:42] And she turned and she thought, "There
[1:52:45] stands a kind old man at the gate."
[1:52:49] She looked at him real close and maybe
[1:52:51] wiped the tears from her eyes. It was
[1:52:53] quite early yet, you know, God does so
[1:52:56] strange.
[1:52:58] She was willing to sacrifice. Water was
[1:53:00] a scarce thing and hadn't rained for
[1:53:02] three years and six months. Would you
[1:53:04] fetch me? Maybe God told him to say
[1:53:07] that. See what she would do. Trying her
[1:53:10] reaction.
[1:53:12] Would you fetch me just a little drink
[1:53:14] of water in a vessel?
[1:53:16] And she looked at him. He sounds
[1:53:19] different. There's something about the
[1:53:21] old man that I feel sorry for. Any
[1:53:24] believer in God will share to the very
[1:53:27] limit with another one.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's one thing about Pentecostal
[1:53:31] people. They'll give the shirt off of
[1:53:33] their back for the cause. That's right.
[1:53:36] It's the truth. That's great thing. One
[1:53:38] of the great things with them. They are
[1:53:40] the greatest givers in the world because
[1:53:43] they know that this earthly goods mounts
[1:53:45] to nothing. They lay their treasures up
[1:53:48] in heaven because we're going up there
[1:53:51] some of these days. And so this woman,
[1:53:54] she said, "I'll just share my water.
[1:53:56] We're going to die. So I'll sacrifice my
[1:54:00] drink of water, give it to the kind old
[1:54:02] gentleman standing there because he
[1:54:03] looks thirsty and tired." She said, "I
[1:54:06] will bring it." And she started walking
[1:54:08] on. And again she heard a voice said,
[1:54:10] "And in your other hand, would you f me
[1:54:13] a little marshall of bread?" Oh my. Now,
[1:54:19] now what? her last hope of the life of
[1:54:23] her child. The last hope that they had
[1:54:27] and the bread would be gone, the oral
[1:54:29] gone, everything would be gone now. But
[1:54:32] she looked back and she wondered, she
[1:54:34] said, "I just have a little bit of meal
[1:54:39] left in a barrel. I've got just enough
[1:54:42] oil that I've dampened it and I've
[1:54:44] already dressed it or I've mixed it.
[1:54:46] I've got the word and the spirit mixed
[1:54:48] together in there.
[1:54:50] I've got the cross shirt to lay it up on
[1:54:53] to make it into a cake to give life.
[1:54:57] That's when the spirit and the word gets
[1:55:00] together on the cross. It makes a life
[1:55:02] loaf for you.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And I've got it together and I'm going
[1:55:09] in now to bake it and give my little
[1:55:11] dying boy in there that's crying all
[1:55:14] night for something to eat.
[1:55:16] I' I've got to give it to him. I'm going
[1:55:19] to sacrifice mine and I I'm going to
[1:55:21] give it to him and then I'll take him up
[1:55:24] my arms and we'll both wait for death.
[1:55:28] He said, "But you make me a little one
[1:55:30] first."
[1:55:32] Isn't that strange that a man would ask
[1:55:34] to widow woman dying for the last bit of
[1:55:38] meal she had in the house with a dying
[1:55:40] child?
[1:55:41] God does things so strange.
[1:55:44] Said, "Make me a little one first." She
[1:55:47] studied. You know, the Bible says that
[1:55:50] we have entertained strangers. We've
[1:55:53] entertained strangers. They were angels,
[1:55:55] not knowing what we were doing.
[1:55:58] Well, she said, "I'll do it." And as she
[1:56:00] turned, he said, "For Oh, there it was."
[1:56:04] The greatest consolation that any
[1:56:06] believer ever listened to. For thus
[1:56:09] sayaeth the Lord.
[1:56:12] That's the word she was waiting for.
[1:56:15] Thus sayaeth the Lord, the barrel will
[1:56:18] not go empty, neither will the cru go
[1:56:21] dry until the day that God sends rain on
[1:56:24] the earth.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; What do we get there? Seek ye first
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God and his
[1:56:32] righteousness.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; All other things will be added.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; How do I know, brother Brandham? How do
[1:56:40] I know? Only thing I know, put God first
[1:56:42] and move on. sacrifice. Mix the oral.
[1:56:45] Mix the the word and the spirit together
[1:56:48] and lay yourself upon the cross and say,
[1:56:50] "Here I am, Lord."
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Put God first in everything.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; For thus saith the Lord.
[1:56:59] The cru will not run dry, neither will
[1:57:01] the barrel go empty until the day that
[1:57:03] the Lord God sends rain upon the earth.
[1:57:06] She knowed then that was a prophet of
[1:57:08] God speaking to her. Oh, how her heart
[1:57:11] must have jumped. She ran in and made
[1:57:14] that little cake and brought it to him
[1:57:15] with the water trembling hands over that
[1:57:17] old sunken cheeks. She knew that God had
[1:57:21] come to the rescue
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; over a little piece of bread. Oh, you
[1:57:25] just take that one little promise of God
[1:57:27] and get everything right and out of the
[1:57:29] way. Watch what takes place.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Get that heart, the unbelief away from
[1:57:35] it. Just take that little belief that
[1:57:37] you got and lay it on to the cross and
[1:57:39] say, "This is all I got, Lord. Take it.
[1:57:43] What's the turn? Thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:57:46] Oh, he's just the same today as he ever
[1:57:48] was.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; That's what she was waiting for. Maybe
[1:57:52] it looks awful dark now. But you know,
[1:57:56] sometimes we're taught I preached on it
[1:57:58] the other night. It's always darkest
[1:58:00] before day. It's at the darkest hour of
[1:58:03] the night when the morning star shines.
[1:58:05] It's reflecting the coming of the sun.
[1:58:09] In Germany, they got a picture. They
[1:58:11] call it the cloud picture. It's it's a
[1:58:15] competitive to this great picture of the
[1:58:17] crucifixion at the at far salon in Los
[1:58:22] Angeles. The great picture is as wide as
[1:58:25] this building is a cross. They had to
[1:58:27] build a building around the picture.
[1:58:30] Many of you have seen it. But this in
[1:58:32] Germany is called
[1:58:34] the angel or the cloud day I believe
[1:58:37] it's called. And when you get off from a
[1:58:40] piece from it and look at it, oh, it
[1:58:42] looks hideous.
[1:58:44] Looks like angry clouds are mixing
[1:58:46] around one another like that as the
[1:58:48] lights reflect on it and look like the
[1:58:51] clouds are moving as the way the picture
[1:58:53] is made to reflect the lights makes it
[1:58:55] look like the cloud an angry storm
[1:58:58] coming to tear up everything. And then
[1:59:00] you're told by the guide, walk closer
[1:59:03] and just keep watching it. And when you
[1:59:05] get real close to it, it isn't clouds.
[1:59:08] It's angels wings of eaten together
[1:59:10] rejoicing.
[1:59:12] It's a blessing in disguisement. Maybe
[1:59:15] your sickness tonight. Maybe your
[1:59:18] sacrifice to come out here was just a
[1:59:21] blessing in disguisement. The angels of
[1:59:23] God are here present to join their wings
[1:59:26] together and rejoice because it's
[1:59:28] written in the scripture that the angels
[1:59:30] of heaven rejoice when one sinner
[1:59:33] repents.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Think on that.
[1:59:37] For thus saith the Lord, Jesus Christ is
[1:59:41] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:59:44] His grace cannot be exhausted, and he's
[1:59:47] willing to give to you anything your
[1:59:49] hearts desire.
[2:00:03] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:00:06] Let's all stand.
[2:00:10] Amen. We'll go to the key of F. That
[2:00:13] last line, he's willing to give you
[2:00:15] anything your hearts desire. Oh, what a
[2:00:18] way to finish that quote. Ain't God good
[2:00:23] to give us so many blessings
[2:00:26] undeserving.
[2:00:29] That's why we are.
[2:00:33] We ought to thank him.
[2:00:36] Love and praise him a little more today
[2:00:41] and a whole lot more tomorrow.
[2:00:45] Well, ain't God good
[2:00:49] to give us so many blessings
[2:00:52] undeserving?
[2:00:55] That's what we are.
[2:00:59] We ought to thank him.
[2:01:02] Love and praise
[2:01:05] him more today and a whole lot more
[2:01:10] tomorrow. Ain't he so good? Ain't God
[2:01:13] good
[2:01:15] to give us so many blessings
[2:01:19] undeserving.
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:22] That's why we are.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, love and praise him a little more
[2:01:32] today
[2:01:34] and a whole lot more tomorrow.
[2:01:39] They that wait
[2:01:42] upon the Lord
[2:01:44] shall renew
[2:01:47] their strength.
[2:01:50] They shall mount up with wings as an
[2:01:56] eagle.
[2:02:01] They shall run and not be weary.
[2:02:06] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:02:12] Teach me Lord.
[2:02:14] Teach me Lord
[2:02:17] to wait.
[2:02:19] [Music]
[2:02:22] Well, teach me Lord
[2:02:25] to wait
[2:02:28] down on my knees
[2:02:33] till you're on good time.
[2:02:39] You answer
[2:02:41] my please.
[2:02:43] Teach me not
[2:02:46] to rely.
[2:02:49] Oh, what others
[2:02:52] do,
[2:02:54] but to wait
[2:02:57] in prayer for an answer from you. The
[2:03:03] last verse. Teach me Lord
[2:03:07] to wait
[2:03:10] while hearts are a flame.
[2:03:15] Help me humble.
[2:03:18] my cry
[2:03:21] and call on your name.
[2:03:26] Keep my faith
[2:03:29] renewed.
[2:03:31] Keep my eyes
[2:03:34] on me.
[2:03:36] Help me be on this earth what you want
[2:03:44] me to be.
[2:03:47] And they that wait upon the Lord
[2:03:52] shall renew
[2:03:55] their strength.
[2:03:57] They shall mount up with wings as
[2:04:04] an eagle.
[2:04:06] [Music]
[2:04:08] They shall run and not be weery.
[2:04:14] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:04:19] Oh, teach me Lord.
[2:04:22] Teach me Lord
[2:04:25] to wait.
[2:04:29] Amen. God bless you richly so much this
[2:04:32] uh this morning. We're glad to have each
[2:04:34] of you with us once again. If uh we'll
[2:04:37] have service again tonight at 5:00 pm,
[2:04:39] all are welcome to that. Uh we will
[2:04:42] let's go ahead and just bow our heads
[2:04:43] and for a word of prayer.
[2:04:46] Precious Lord Jesus. Father God, we
[2:04:49] thank you for the word that came forth
[2:04:50] this morning. Lord, we know it was
[2:04:52] anointed, Father. So we pray that you
[2:04:55] soften our hearts that we can receive
[2:04:57] it, Lord, and we can grow and Lord,
[2:04:59] become more like you, Lord, as we just
[2:05:01] get ready for this great rapture that's
[2:05:03] coming, Lord, any day now, Lord. We're
[2:05:05] trusting you, Lord. We can't see how
[2:05:07] this world could get much worse, Father,
[2:05:09] without you coming back, Lord. Oh,
[2:05:12] granted, Jesus. Lord, as we leave here
[2:05:14] this morning, we pray for your hand of
[2:05:16] mercy upon each and every one of us,
[2:05:18] Father, and you'll return us back this
[2:05:21] afternoon, Lord, to hear more of what
[2:05:23] you have to say to us. If it be thy
[2:05:25] will, Father. Lord, we thank you for
[2:05:28] letting us join together once again,
[2:05:30] Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord. We can't
[2:05:33] wait to gather back. And it's in Jesus
[2:05:36] name that we pray. Amen. You are
[2:05:39] dismissed this morning.
[2:05:45] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:05:50] Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord
[2:05:56] to wait. They that wait.
[2:06:01] They that wait
[2:06:04] upon the Lord
[2:06:07] shall renew
[2:06:09] their strength.
[2:06:12] They shall mount up with wings as
[2:06:18] an eagle.
[2:06:23] They shall run and not be weery.
[2:06:29] They shall walk and not faint.
[2:06:34] Teach me Lord.
[2:06:37] Teach me Lord
[2:06:39] to wait.
[2:06:44] Let's go to the key of G. You know the
[2:06:47] verses for through the fire.
[2:06:53] So, so many times I've questioned
[2:06:58] circumstances,
[2:07:02] things I could not understand.
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:09] Many times my trials,
[2:07:13] weakness blurred my vision.
[2:07:17] My frustration gets so out of here.
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:25] Then I am reminded
[2:07:27] [Music]
[2:07:29] every second.
[2:07:32] I've never had to stand one test alone.
[2:07:39] As I look at all the victories,
[2:07:43] the spirit rises up in me. Through the
[2:07:48] fire, my weakness is made strong.
[2:07:55] He never promised that the cross would
[2:07:59] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[2:08:04] hard to climb.
[2:08:10] He never offered
[2:08:13] us victories without fighting. But he
[2:08:17] said help would always come in time.
[2:08:21] [Music]
[2:08:24] Just remember when you're standing
[2:08:28] in the valley of decision
[2:08:32] and the adversary
[2:08:34] says give in.
[2:08:38] Just hold on.
[2:08:42] Our Lord will show up
[2:08:46] and he will take you through the fire
[2:08:50] again.
[2:08:51] [Music]
[2:08:54] No, he never promised that the cross
[2:08:59] would not get heavy
[2:09:02] and the hill would not be hard to climb.
[2:09:10] He never offered
[2:09:13] us victories without fighting. But he
[2:09:16] said help would always come in time.
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:24] Just remember when you're standing in
[2:09:28] the valley of decision in the adversary
[2:09:34] says give
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:38] just hold on.
[2:09:42] Our Lord will show up
[2:09:46] and he will take you through the fire
[2:09:50] again.
[2:09:52] So just hold
[2:09:55] on.
[2:09:57] Our Lord will show up
[2:10:00] and he will take you through the fire
[2:10:04] again.
