[0:43] You may be seated. Brother Brennan,
[0:48] &gt;&gt; this being this way would answer exactly
[0:51] Enoch's sign in Egypt, the pyramid.
[0:56] Was
[0:58] it
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Enoch before the antivian destruction
[1:02] when justification was coming in he
[1:05] brought forth a sign and in this pyramid
[1:08] is seven steps going to the king's
[1:11] chamber
[1:14] once on the seventh step if you ever
[1:18] studied the dimensions of the pyramid
[1:20] what comes out to take the oncomer to
[1:23] introduce to the king
[1:26] what's station that is standing there
[1:28] and you'll see the day you're living in
[1:30] a pyramid. Now God made three Bibles.
[1:33] Now there's a pyramid teaching. It's
[1:34] nonsense. But there's a genuine pyramid.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:40] now God first Bible he made three. They
[1:42] have to be everything in three. Jesus
[1:43] comes three times. Come once to redeem
[1:45] his bride, next time to get his bride,
[1:47] next time with his bride. See now notice
[1:51] how beautiful. See? And in this pyramid
[1:54] was seven steps. And then the king's
[1:56] chamber. And we're in the seventh church
[1:58] age.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Before the king takes his throne. And
[2:02] remember, the pyramid never did have a
[2:04] capstone on it.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; God's first Bible was in the skies, the
[2:09] zodiac.
[2:10] It starts off and runs every age. The
[2:13] first beginning of the zodiac is the
[2:14] virgin. That's how he come first. The
[2:17] last figure in the zodiac is Leo the
[2:18] lion, the second coming. Just before
[2:21] there is a cross fishes which is a
[2:22] cancer age that we're living in now
[2:25] there was a pyramid after that Enoch
[2:27] which testified exactly we wouldn't have
[2:29] time to go into it but someday with
[2:31] God's help I'll show you just exactly
[2:33] draws a dimension of the hour we're
[2:34] living see notice but this geographical
[2:37] measure now that we have whose
[2:39] dimensions are the same doesn't
[2:40] necessarily mean that it has to be a a
[2:42] cube notice
[2:44] this would answer Egypt's or the Enoch's
[2:47] sign in Egypt
[2:49] in the first time of purifying by its
[2:52] baptism of fire there will be volcanic
[2:55] such as this earth exploding and will
[2:58] push up a pyramidel like mountain
[3:03] see plenty of room to do it this whole
[3:06] thing will be changed the whole surface
[3:07] will be changed you got it
[3:11] &gt;&gt; you'll push up a pyramid like mountain
[3:15] this would exactly be with the word
[3:20] if it doesn't, which it will. Now
[3:22] notice, for in Isaiah 65:25, where we
[3:27] just read, it said, "They shall not hurt
[3:29] or destroy in all my holy mountain."
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Sayaeth the Lord.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; All my holy mountain. Remember, it's
[3:43] always a mountain.
[3:45] If the walls were straight up and down,
[3:47] the city could only be seen from the
[3:50] outside. From the inside,
[3:52] the throne could only be seen from the
[3:54] inside. But notice,
[3:57] it would be seen only from the inside.
[4:00] But now we see the promise of Isaiah 4.
[4:05] Let's just read it. Are you in a hurry?
[4:07] No.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Don't don't be in a hurry now. We we
[4:08] we're in too too particular a thing now.
[4:10] too much too much of a a time that you
[4:12] must understand right here because I
[4:14] want to make this clear and then when we
[4:16] get back to it again I'll I'll show you
[4:17] then where we where we're talking about
[4:20] when our next study on this at another
[4:22] time.
[4:24] Oh, praise the Lord Jesus. Watch here
[4:28] how the words cannot fail. Now watch
[4:30] here in Isaiah I got wrote down here if
[4:33] I can find it again just a minute.
[4:34] Isaiah 4 and5. Now listen, he's talking
[4:37] of the coming of the Lord. how that
[4:38] women would be so immoral.
[4:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said seven women. Let's let's
[4:43] just read it. Let's hear it. And in that
[4:45] day, seven women shall take a hold of
[4:47] one man, saying we'll eat her own bread,
[4:49] wear our own apparel, only let us be
[4:51] called by thy name to take away our
[4:52] reproach.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; That's the end time where we're living
[4:55] now.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Marriage, divorce, and prostitution.
[4:58] What?
[4:59] &gt;&gt; In that day shall the branch of the Lord
[5:01] be beautiful and glorious. The fruit of
[5:03] the earth shall be excellent and
[5:05] commonly them that escaped of Israel.
[5:08] How that you escaped all that damnation.
[5:09] See, and it shall come to pass that he
[5:12] that is left in Zion, and he that's a
[5:14] remnant in Jerusalem shall uh let's see,
[5:17] in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even
[5:20] everyone that is written among the
[5:22] living in Jerusalem. See, wherein the
[5:24] Lord shall have washed away the filth of
[5:28] the daughter of Zion.
[5:30] Remember, that's always the bride. See,
[5:33] and shall have purified the blood of
[5:35] Jerusalem. That's the remnant of the
[5:38] Jews plus Lebrine. See, and in the midst
[5:41] thereof with the spirit of judgment.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; That's always God's judgment. When he
[5:48] makes his final judgment, calls you,
[5:50] justifies you, brings you to redemption,
[5:52] then his judgment breaks forth upon you,
[5:55] and the Holy Ghost and fire cleanses
[5:57] away the sin. Then you're his. Same
[5:59] thing he does to the earth when he
[6:00] purges it with fire and by the spirit of
[6:04] burning. Now look, listen. Are you
[6:08] ready?
[6:09] And the Lord will create upon every
[6:12] dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon
[6:15] her assembly a cloud of smoke by day,
[6:18] and a shining of fire by night. For upon
[6:22] all the glory shall be a defense. The
[6:26] Lord in that day upon the pavement
[6:30] shall create a fire of light to burn
[6:34] upon the day. And it goes ahead and says
[6:36] it'll be a shelter of rest, a refuge.
[6:38] Notice
[6:40] making exactly the speaking of the
[6:42] Bible. Exactly. The walls are straight
[6:44] up and down. You couldn't see it. It has
[6:46] to lean all my holy mountains. He'll
[6:49] create this light upon this mountain and
[6:52] it shall be for defense. Oh, we sang
[6:55] that song. Oh, that city of Mount Zion.
[7:00] And as a pilgrim, yet I love it still.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Now, through those ages when I reached
[7:05] that city on the hill, see,
[7:09] notice Mount Si
[7:12] was where God descended on top of it
[7:16] when he spoke to Israel in a pillar of
[7:18] fire.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; He descended on top of a mountain.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mount Sani
[7:26] on the mount of transfiguration when he
[7:28] declared, "This is my beloved son. Here
[7:30] you him." He descended in a pillar of
[7:33] light and shining brightness
[7:36] &gt;&gt; up on top of the mountain before Peter,
[7:38] James, and John.
[7:41] And in there, he was represented with
[7:43] both Moses and Elijah, the translated
[7:46] and the dead raised. Amen.
[7:49] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; The new city and the new earth,
[7:57] the new creation, the city on the hill
[8:00] with the throne in the top of it.
[8:04] The throne up here in the top and the
[8:07] dwellers all up and down on this
[8:09] mountain.
[8:11] And the wall that's around this had 12
[8:14] foundations.
[8:16] And each one of them had the breast
[8:18] stone was in Aaron which represented the
[8:21] 12 tribes of Israel. And in the gates
[8:24] they had four gates that just exactly
[8:25] like the temple in the wilderness like
[8:27] the temp was in the wilderness. Notice
[8:30] each one had had the apostles three on
[8:32] each side. 12 apostles each and it was
[8:37] 144 cubics high.
[8:40] 144 cubics is exactly 216 ft in each one
[8:44] of those big stones. almost 20 foot tall
[8:48] the breastplate
[8:50] in that gate making up that wall that
[8:54] was around the city. Now it the city
[8:56] doesn't rest on top of the wall because
[8:59] the city 1500 miles cannot do that. It's
[9:01] the wall here that you enter in like the
[9:04] gates of the old Jerusalem. You entered
[9:06] through the wall into that and each one
[9:09] of these had the 12 foundations and each
[9:12] one had the amber and the different
[9:14] stones which represent the 12 tribes of
[9:17] Israel.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; And the apostles each over that big one
[9:21] solid pearl gate set a name of an
[9:23] apostle. And didn't Jesus said, "You'll
[9:26] set on 12 thrones
[9:28] &gt;&gt; judgeing the 12 tribes of Israel. Who
[9:30] set at the gate to judge when they come
[9:31] into the city?"
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. There you are.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; The kings of the earth entering into the
[9:38] city.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; Comes before the apostolic judge.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; And Jesus promised.
[9:46] Oh my.
[9:48] On this throne, on top of it, 1,500
[9:52] miles high, the whole world will see the
[9:55] light of the world.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:59] Jesus
[10:01] sitting on the throne on top of the
[10:04] world, top of the church, top of Mount
[10:08] Zion, which is 1500 miles, half size in
[10:11] the United States, and raises plum up to
[10:13] you can see the world over 1,500 miles
[10:16] high. And all up and down the earth will
[10:19] be the redeemed.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; There will be the houses of pure gold.
[10:25] There will be avenues and parks and
[10:27] gardens. And the river of life coming
[10:30] trinkling out from the throne and
[10:31] running down two little chasms and over
[10:34] the terraces.
[10:36] And the tree of life will be blooming in
[10:38] every yard and bear its fruit 12 times a
[10:40] year, change fruit every month.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; And the kings of the earth shall come
[10:45] into it and bring their honor. And the
[10:47] leaves are for the healing of the
[10:49] nations. When the kings are living in
[10:51] peace out there, will he go out? They'll
[10:53] pick a tree, a leaf off like that like
[10:55] the dove come back that the wrath of God
[10:58] have been settled and brought the holly
[11:00] leaf into the ark. So when the king
[11:02] leaves by bringing his glory into the
[11:04] bride's chamber here into the city,
[11:06] he'll hold a leaf to his neighbor, king,
[11:07] and we're in peace forever more.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Healing all the nations.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; It's all settled. One time we fought for
[11:15] one another's bloods, brother. And we
[11:17] cherished and hollered and shot and
[11:18] burnt and everything. But now there's
[11:21] peace.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; The healing, not disease. Healing is all
[11:26] done.
[11:27] &gt;&gt; Healing of the nations.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; City with the throne and top. Revelation
[11:35] 21:23. And they need no light for the
[11:39] lamb and the Lord God is the light
[11:41] &gt;&gt; thereof.
[11:43] Lord,
[11:44] &gt;&gt; see
[11:45] &gt;&gt; the Lord God is that pillar of fire that
[11:48] follow the children of Israel through
[11:49] the wilderness.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; And he has ascended upon the throne in
[11:54] that perfect kingdom. When time the
[11:57] kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to
[11:59] the father that God might be all and in
[12:02] it all, Jesus sets upon his throne here
[12:04] as our chosen. Amen.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; And the king is that light
[12:10] &gt;&gt; that will be on top of Mount Zion
[12:12] &gt;&gt; and his holy light will flood the entire
[12:15] city.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. 1,500 miles high and 1,500
[12:20] mile square with the paradises of God
[12:22] built all through that city.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Streets, avenues. Read your Revelations
[12:27] 21. See if it isn't right. See, they
[12:29] need no light there. For the lamb is
[12:32] like
[12:33] &gt;&gt; and on the throne can be seen sitting
[12:37] 1500 mile. It don't just run right
[12:39] straight up like this. It slants off
[12:42] like the pyramid. If it' be half of the
[12:44] distance in that' be about run up like
[12:47] this. You see from one city to the
[12:49] other. Now if you'll notice from one
[12:50] side of the city to the other. I could
[12:53] drop a little something here if you want
[12:54] me to.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; Did you notice a little group here?
[12:59] It's just about that part of
[13:01] circumference. It covers
[13:06] [Music]
[13:09] &gt;&gt; from Georgia,
[13:10] California to Saskatchewan
[13:14] &gt;&gt; from Kansas to the rockbound coast of
[13:17] Maine.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; That's what's gathered.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; That's why what's represented right here
[13:23] about 1500 miles square.
[13:27] Oh, they come from the east and west.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; They come from the land of fire
[13:33] &gt;&gt; to feast with our king to dine. What on
[13:36] man shall not live by bread alone by
[13:39] bread worthy? To dine as his guest. How
[13:43] blessed these pilgrims are in the world
[13:45] have said, I never seen people like him.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, beholding his hallowed face,
[13:50] &gt;&gt; a glow with light divine. Bless
[13:52] partakers of his grace as gems in his
[13:55] crown shall shine.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus is coming soon.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Our troubles will then be over.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, what if our Lord this moment should
[14:05] come?
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; It won't be long.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Everything's perfectly geographically.
[14:13] Sodom, the messengers, everything's
[14:15] sitting just exactly right.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? just ain't coming to
[14:21] this one little tabernacle 1,500 miles
[14:24] square from the same dimension.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Why is it God so thought and cared so
[14:30] much about that little place of
[14:31] Palestine?
[14:33] &gt;&gt; Hey, well, it's just a little spot,
[14:36] &gt;&gt; but right in there is where the temple
[14:37] is at.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; That's where the new Jerusalem would
[14:40] break up right there.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Olive, Mount of Olives shall cleave part
[14:43] to the right, left. Sure. When she
[14:45] pushes up from the beginning,
[14:46] &gt;&gt; not they say it's pushing apart like
[14:48] this, it's pushing up. Amen.
[14:50] &gt;&gt; And that day when he stands his holy
[14:52] feet upon the mountain, notice
[14:55] on his throne 1500 miles high. Remember,
[14:59] Satan tried to tempt him one time on top
[15:02] of a mountain.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; See, the new city has 12 foundations as
[15:07] through 12 patriarchs, 144 cubics being
[15:10] the breastplate of Aaron, 12 gates of
[15:13] pearl, 12 disciples name. Jesus stand
[15:17] the headstone
[15:20] on the throne
[15:22] &gt;&gt; when his saints has crowned him the king
[15:24] of kings
[15:26] &gt;&gt; the lord of lords
[15:28] &gt;&gt; and he's a headstone
[15:30] &gt;&gt; I don't have my pocket book with me
[15:35] but if you'll notice in your pocketbook
[15:37] if you have a $1 bill
[15:40] they have the seal of the United States
[15:42] a eagle on one end holding the spears,
[15:46] the uh coat of arms as it were. And on
[15:50] the other end, it's got the pyramid with
[15:54] an allseen eye on top of it.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; See, they didn't know what they were
[15:58] doing. And on there, it's wrote in
[16:00] Latin, and you'll find out it says it.
[16:02] This is the great seal.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't know what they were doing.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Neither the cafe know he was
[16:12] prophesying. Right.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; There's the great seal. Here it is.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; See, the city is not just a flat cube
[16:20] like this. See, but it leans up so it
[16:22] can be seen.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; And upon this holy mountain of the Lord,
[16:27] the Lord shall descend up on top of his
[16:29] mountain.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; There he is.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; That's the reason the capstone wasn't
[16:35] put on by Enoch.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; See,
[16:39] &gt;&gt; that's the reason the capstone has to
[16:41] come now. Hallelujah.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; And the mount will be pushed up and
[16:45] it'll be the mount of the Lord. And in
[16:47] here will dwell the redeemed
[16:50] these avenues
[16:52] and big freeways as it was.
[16:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Parks
[16:58] and the river of life will draw run
[17:00] right through it.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And every house will be made
[17:06] of transparent gold, and the streets
[17:08] will be made of gold.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; And the trees of life will be there,
[17:12] &gt;&gt; and will bear 12 manners of fruit,
[17:14] &gt;&gt; and the kings and the honored man of the
[17:16] earth shall bring their honor and glory
[17:18] into the gates, and the gates shall not
[17:20] be shut by night, because there is no
[17:23] night there.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; In that city where the lamb is alive.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in that city where there
[17:32] cometh no have a mansion over there
[17:34] that's free from toil and care. Oh, I'm
[17:37] going where that lamb is alive.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; Don't you see the the towns, the cities,
[17:43] the houses, the dwellings are are
[17:45] speaking of that right now.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; All these natural things are a shadow.
[17:51] Take a shadow at a distance like my pan.
[17:53] Before there can be a a positive or
[17:55] negative, there has to be a positive.
[17:57] And you see that shadow look like I got
[17:59] a dozen fingers. But then when you go to
[18:01] get it close together, it it focuses it
[18:03] down to one and then the shadow fades
[18:06] into the hand. That's a lot of time
[18:08] people think there's three or four gods.
[18:10] You're looking too far back in the early
[18:12] reformations.
[18:13] Come on down now. You find focus into
[18:15] there's one.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Exactly. There's one bride. Not a dozen
[18:19] denominations, but one bride.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; That's the elected out of every out of
[18:23] the out of the earth that's been
[18:24] predestinated to this. That's right. The
[18:26] ones who can recognize their place in
[18:28] the kingdom on this throne. Look so
[18:31] high. The new city with the foundations,
[18:34] 12 gates, Jesus a headstone. The
[18:36] apostles judging the 12 tribes.
[18:40] The pyramid of Enoch casts no shadow, no
[18:44] time of the day.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; I've been in Egypt at the pyramids.
[18:49] It's so geographically fixed. And then
[18:51] the dimensions of this uh uh great
[18:53] geometrical uh figure that no matter
[18:56] where the sun is, there's never a shadow
[18:58] around the pyramid. See how it is? And
[19:01] there'll never be no night there.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Him on top of the mountain floods it
[19:06] with his glory.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; His glory light will be there all the
[19:09] time. There will be no night there.
[19:12] Jesus the headstone. Now notice, so the
[19:16] redeemed shall walk in the light.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; We sing now. We'll walk in the light.
[19:20] that beautiful light. There's something
[19:22] in us calling out pass from death and
[19:23] life. It's because that's waiting.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; See, that's what's the attribute what we
[19:28] feel truly. This is, are you ready? This
[19:32] is the city that Abraham was looking
[19:34] for.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Being a prophet, he knowed that city was
[19:40] somewhere. The Bible said so.
[19:43] &gt;&gt; And he forsook the city he lived and he
[19:46] went over. Look where he went.
[19:50] exactly where it'll be.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; See, he was looking for a city whose
[19:56] builder and maker was God.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; See, being a prophetise,
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus gone to prepare with divine hands,
[20:04] a divine city, divine architect, for a
[20:08] divine bought people, for predestinated
[20:10] people. He's gone to prepare. Abraham
[20:14] was looking for it
[20:15] &gt;&gt; and he professed that he was a pilgrim
[20:18] and a stranger. That's right.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; For he looked for a city whose builder
[20:23] and maker was God. That prophet knowing
[20:25] it was somewhere, John saw it coming
[20:27] down.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; But Abraham thought it must be on earth
[20:30] right then. Why? He met
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Melzdc.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; The king of it
[20:37] &gt;&gt; and gave him a tithe
[20:39] &gt;&gt; which had no father, no mother.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; He had no beginning of life or no ending
[20:44] of life. That's right.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; Abraham met him.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; And they took communion
[20:54] &gt;&gt; right on the literal spot
[20:58] where the city will be raised up.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; The holy mountain of the Lord where the
[21:02] redeemed will live.
[21:05] Oh my.

[29:58] We were out of town for the last two
[30:02] times we got together on Sunday and

[30:06] Went back to visit my youngest brother
[30:08] Joe and his family and just ask you just

[30:13] So Joe, if you could just add that when
[30:15] you're reading the the request later.
[30:18] But I am so glad to be back and thankful
[30:22] for a place to come and and and worship.
[30:24] And just sing the songs of Zion. And
[30:29] Jesus said he seeks those. The father
[30:31] seeketh those that'll worship him in
[30:32] spirit and in truth. And how many can
[30:35] say, "I want to be one of those people
[30:36] this morning." Amen. Let's stand
[30:38] together.
[30:40] Amen. God is so good to us.
[30:44] Amen. How about we sing that song? There
[30:46] is power in the blood. Would you be free
[30:48] from your burden of sin? Would you be
[30:52] free from your burden of sin? There's

[31:25] There is power, power, wonder work, and
[31:30] power in the preious
[31:33] blood of the lamb.
[31:38] Would you be free from your passionate
[31:42] pride? There's power in the blood.

[33:59] Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Chris Smith, would you
[34:02] come open our service this morning with
[34:04] a word of prayer?
[34:17] Dear Lord,
[34:19] oh Lord, we want to invite you here this
[34:21] morning.
[34:23] We thank you, Lord, for bringing our
[34:27] brother John back safely. Lord,
[34:31] [Music]
[34:33] we sing praises to you, oh Lord, this
[34:35] morning.
[34:37] Just ask, Lord, that you'll be with us,
[34:39] Lord. Be in this service, Lord.
[34:42] May you bring the word of life to us,
[34:45] Lord. Just feed us this morning, Lord
[34:47] Jesus.
[34:49] We love you so much, Lord. We want to
[34:52] worship you this morning, Lord.
[34:55] Please, Lord, may your presence be known
[34:57] to us this morning. We ask this in Jesus
[35:00] Christ's name. Amen.
[35:08] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like.
[35:14] The trial of this world was getting
[35:19] closer.
[35:23] The pull I felt was more than I could
[35:29] bear.
[35:33] When I was on the verge
[35:37] of giving over,
[35:42] the strength within myself
[35:46] just wasn't there.
[35:50] But something keeps holding me.
[35:55] Every day I see
[35:59] he's helping me faithfully.
[36:03] to overcome my trials.
[36:08] He's guiding me constantly.
[36:13] He's given me victory.
[36:16] Aren't you thankful that he's a reality?
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Something keeps holding me.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Satan made before me.
[36:32] his temptation
[36:37] of his desire to steal away my faith.
[36:46] But I have found inside
[36:50] the revelation.
[36:55] It's the strength I need to keep me in
[37:00] his grace.
[37:04] Something keeps holding me
[37:09] every day. I see.
[37:13] He's helping me faithfully
[37:16] to overcome my trials,
[37:22] guiding me constantly,
[37:27] giving me victory.
[37:30] [Music]
[37:32] He's a reality.
[37:35] Something keeps holding me.
[37:41] Something keeps holding me.
[37:46] Every day I see
[37:50] he's helping me faithfully
[37:54] to overcome my trials.
[37:59] He's guiding me constantly,
[38:03] [Music]
[38:04] giving me victory.
[38:07] [Music]
[38:09] And he's a reality.
[38:13] Something keeps holding
[38:15] me.
[38:20] Now I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[38:23] walk to my way for the hand of God in
[38:28] all my life I see
[38:32] and the reason of my place. Yes, the
[38:36] secret all is the comforter abides with
[38:41] me.
[38:43] Yes, he abides.
[38:47] He abides.
[38:50] Oh hallelujah. He abide with me.
[38:56] I'm rejoicing that day as I walked in
[39:02] for the comfort of life with me.
[39:08] And once my heart was full of sin. Once
[39:11] I had no peace within until I heard how
[39:16] Jesus died upon the tree.
[39:20] Then I fell down at his feet. There came
[39:24] a peace so sweet. The comforter abides
[39:29] with me.
[39:32] Yes, he abides.
[39:35] He abides.
[39:38] Oh, hallelujah.
[39:40] divides with me.
[39:44] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[39:48] the narrow way for the comfort of me.
[39:54] And there's no thirsting for the things
[39:56] there's no thirsting for the things of
[40:00] the world they take away. Long ago I
[40:04] gave them up and instantly
[40:08] all my night was turned to day. All my
[40:12] words roll away. The comforter abides
[40:18] with me.
[40:20] Yes, he abides.
[40:23] He abides.
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:27] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[40:32] I'm rejoice in night and day as I walk
[40:37] there.
[40:39] The comforter abide.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I love this verse. Oh, he is with me
[40:46] everywhere.
[40:47] He knows my everywhere.
[40:50] I'm happy as a bird and just as free
[40:56] for the spirit has control
[41:00] satisfies my soul. The comforter abides.
[41:06] Thank you Lord.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, he abides.
[41:10] [Applause]
[41:10] [Music]
[41:11] He abides.
[41:14] Oh hallelujah. He abides with me.
[41:21] rejoicing night to day as I walk the
[41:24] narrow way the comforter.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that last verse could one
[41:30] more time again. Well, he's with me
[41:33] everywhere.
[41:35] He knows my every care. I'm as happy as
[41:40] a bird, just as free.
[41:44] For the spirit has control. He satisfies
[41:48] my soul. The comforter abides with me.
[41:55] Yes, he abides.
[41:58] He abide.
[42:01] Oh hallelujah. He abides in me.
[42:08] I'm rejoicing night to day as I walk the
[42:12] narrow way for the comfort of my
[42:17] [Music]
[42:30] [Music]
[42:38] Thank you.
[42:41] Let's just sing it one more time. He
[42:46] abide.
[42:49] Oh, hallelujah.
[42:51] He abides.
[42:55] I rejoice night and day as I walk away
[43:01] [Music]
[43:04] with me.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; Fulfill my cup,
[43:15] Lord.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:18] and I lift it up.
[43:24] You stand as we worship it. Oh, come and
[43:29] quench
[43:30] [Music]
[43:32] this thirsty
[43:34] of my soul.
[43:42] Bread
[43:43] of heaven.
[43:46] Lord, if we live here,
[43:50] [Music]
[43:53] all
[43:56] Lord, here's my cup.
[44:01] Just fill it up
[44:04] and make me home. Let's sing it one more
[44:08] time as the brothers come for the
[44:09] offering and the requests. Just fill my
[44:14] heart.
[44:15] [Music]
[44:18] I live

[45:06] me whole.
[45:08] [Music]
[45:12] Good morning.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Morning. God bless you this morning.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe we'll try that again. Good
[45:17] morning.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Morning.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Sure to be in church with each one of
[45:20] you. This morning we had 10 children,
[45:22] nine Bibles, $1 in Sunday school
[45:24] offering. So nice to have good crowd
[45:27] this morning. In the way of our prayer
[45:28] requests, certainly want to remember the
[45:30] kings traveling and our precious Bobby
[45:32] WZ as he's going through this trial in
[45:34] his life. So remember the family this
[45:37] morning we have upcoming meetings early
[45:39] November. We want to hold those up
[45:41] before the Lord and Lord of direct
[45:44] brother Israel and all those that are
[45:45] planning to come. We'll keep brother Joe
[45:47] Yarbor held up in prayer and I don't see
[45:50] my Sarah this morning. So remember Sarah
[45:52] and Joseph and she's getting big
[45:54] pregnant and due any day and going to be
[45:57] Thursday if baby doesn't come then
[45:59] before then. So uphold them in prayer if
[46:01] you would. And if you've got a desire on
[46:03] your heart, let's bring that before
[46:04] Almighty God, our prayer answering
[46:06] Father this morning. Dear God, so good
[46:08] to be able to come before you in service
[46:11] this morning. No better place we could
[46:13] be, Lord. We've maybe allowed something
[46:15] to get between us during the week, but
[46:17] it's nice just to set it aside for the
[46:19] day, Lord, that you set aside for men
[46:23] and to be restful and to worship and
[46:26] honor of you, Lord. And we expect to
[46:28] hear from heaven this morning. We
[46:30] appreciate brother Israel's family and
[46:32] looking forward to the word that you'll
[46:33] bring through him today, God. And we
[46:36] bring you our cares, Lord, the toils of
[46:38] this life. We know they'll soon be over.
[46:40] We're making preparations, Lord, for
[46:43] your soon coming. We hold up our needs,
[46:45] Lord, Sarah and uh baby Joseph and
[46:48] Joseph, and just help them through this
[46:50] time. And for those missing among us,
[46:53] Lord, be with those. Our precious
[46:56] brother Joe Yarro, we miss him, Lord,
[46:58] out east. and just pray for him and his
[47:00] family
[47:02] and for the other knees. Lord, good to
[47:04] see sister Lori and the snows this
[47:06] morning and just continue to remember
[47:08] them.
[47:10] Brother Bobby, Lord, he's done so much
[47:11] for your people. And I'm not sure his
[47:14] time is over, Lord. We will leave that
[47:16] up to you, but we pray for him, Lord,
[47:18] for his faith and for the kings, Lord,
[47:20] traveling today. All things, Lord, we
[47:22] bring before you, asking for your
[47:24] perfect will to be done, Lord, as we
[47:26] worship you and this soon coming, Lord,
[47:29] our soon cominging King. We thank you
[47:31] for it. We thank you for the tithes and
[47:32] offerings we bring to you for the glory
[47:35] and honor of your kingdom. We love you
[47:36] and thank you in Jesus name. All God's
[47:38] people say,
[47:43] "Amen."
[47:47] Somebody could help. Joy has a song
[47:50] special. I She's going to need help
[47:51] getting the microphone set up and maybe
[47:54] they can help with that in a minute. But
[47:55] just want to sing that chorus before we
[47:57] do. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. I
[47:59] was just thinking of that verse
[48:00] yesterday. God has not given us a spirit
[48:03] of fear, but of power and a love and a
[48:05] sound mind. And you know, that's
[48:06] something we had to say, Lord, thank
[48:08] you. This world is falling apart, but we
[48:10] have complete rest and comfort to give.
[48:12] And just tell him, Lord, thank you for
[48:14] all your goodness to us this morning. Oh
[48:17] heavenly father,
[48:20] I appreciate
[48:22] [Music]
[48:23] you.
[48:28] Heavenly Father,
[48:31] I appreciate
[48:34] you.
[48:39] I love you,
[48:42] adore you.
[48:45] I bow down
[48:48] before you. Heavenly Father,
[48:53] I appreciate.
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] We sing that verse. It says, "Holy
[48:59] Spirit, you're a comfort to me. Holy
[49:02] Spirit,
[49:04] you're a comfort
[49:07] to me.
[49:12] Holy Spirit,
[49:15] you're a comfort
[49:18] to me.
[49:23] You lead me.
[49:27] You guide me.
[49:29] You're dwelling
[49:32] inside
[49:33] me. Holy Spirit,
[49:38] you're comfort.
[49:42] [Music]
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated if you like.
[50:05] I wanted to share just a quick little
[50:06] testimony that's helped me so much. I
[50:09] went to Arkansas and I just had a lot of
[50:12] burdens and cares on my heart and in the
[50:16] middle of the night the Lord woke me up.
[50:18] I couldn't sleep and I thought, well,
[50:20] I'll just put on the Lifeline app and
[50:22] see what Brother Brandham's saying. And
[50:24] this this came on immediately when I put
[50:27] the the tape on. It says just like a
[50:29] baby. This is from letting off the
[50:31] pressure in 62 paragraph 69. It says
[50:34] just like a baby to lay your trust upon
[50:36] him and let him take all your cares for
[50:39] he cares for you. Don't try to do
[50:41] anything about it. He will do it
[50:43] already. He has promised he would do it.
[50:45] It's his business. As long as you're
[50:47] fooling with it, well then he can't have
[50:49] it. But when you turn it loose and let
[50:51] him have it, he will take care of it for
[50:53] you. Oh, I like that. What a perfect
[50:55] calmness that Christian ought to have.
[50:57] And this has just given me such a peace
[51:00] through the midst of our trials that
[51:01] he's with us and he cares about us.
[51:05] [Music]
[51:18] Here on the Potter's
[51:22] will,
[51:25] I find myself
[51:28] once more.
[51:31] My faults and my failures.
[51:37] Bring me here just like before.
[51:44] With strong and loving hands.
[51:51] The pressure is applied.
[51:57] Of times I tremble as he puts me through
[52:05] the fire.
[52:07] [Music]
[52:10] I'll trust
[52:12] the potter's
[52:14] hands.
[52:17] He knows what's best for me.
[52:23] He has a perfect
[52:27] plan.
[52:29] These human eyes
[52:32] can see.
[52:37] He's the potter
[52:39] on the clay.
[52:44] He knows just how much I can take when I
[52:52] face the fire again.
[52:56] I'll trust the potter's
[53:00] hands.
[53:04] His hands
[53:07] were deep inside.
[53:12] And he
[53:14] makes no mistakes.
[53:18] Though it seems all just crumble
[53:22] down
[53:25] and I can hardly
[53:28] stand the pain
[53:32] into
[53:34] his own
[53:36] design.
[53:39] He is molding
[53:41] me.
[53:43] I know
[53:47] though this world spins all around. I
[53:51] know the potter. He's in control.
[54:00] I'll trust the par's
[54:04] hands.
[54:06] He knows what's best for me.
[54:13] He has a perfect
[54:17] length. These human eyes
[54:22] can't see.
[54:25] [Music]
[54:27] He's the potter
[54:29] on the clay.
[54:34] He knows just how much I can take.
[54:41] When I face the fire again,
[54:46] I'll trust the potter's
[54:51] hand.
[54:52] [Music]
[55:01] All hail King Jesus.
[55:05] [Music]
[55:08] All hail
[55:10] Emmanuel,
[55:12] [Music]
[55:16] the King of Kings,
[55:21] Lord of Lords,
[55:23] the bright morning star.
[55:30] And throughout
[55:34] eternity
[55:38] I'm going to praise
[55:41] him
[55:45] and forever
[55:50] I will reign with
[55:58] Let's go to the key of C if we could.
[56:00] Sister Sharon,
[56:02] sing a couple of verses, maybe three on
[56:04] this and we'll just let the musicians
[56:06] continue to pray to to play as we just
[56:09] wait on the Lord and pastor to come out
[56:12] and Amen. How many have a need this
[56:15] morning? Amen. He promised that every
[56:19] need he supplies.
[56:21] Amen. Just came expecting this morning.
[56:24] knowing that he has everything under
[56:25] control. And this is a song that Fanny
[56:30] Crosby wrote years ago. Wonderful Savior
[56:32] is Jesus, my Lord. A wonderful Savior to
[56:36] me.
[56:38] A wonderful
[56:40] Savior
[56:43] is Jesus,
[56:45] my Lord.
[56:49] A wonderful
[56:52] Savior
[56:54] to me.
[56:57] [Music]
[56:59] Glory hideth
[57:02] my soul in the cl
[57:08] of the rock
[57:11] where rivers
[57:14] of blessure
[57:16] I see
[57:22] he hideth
[57:25] my soul
[57:28] in the Lift up
[57:31] the rock
[57:33] that shadows
[57:36] a dry thirsty
[57:40] land.
[57:42] [Music]
[57:45] He hide

[57:50] in the depths
[57:52] of his love
[57:56] that

[58:18] Oh, wonderful
[58:21] savior
[58:24] is Jesus
[58:26] my lord.
[58:29] He taketh
[58:31] my burden
[58:35] away.
[58:37] Thank you Lord.
[58:40] Behold
[58:43] me up and I shall
[58:48] not be moved.
[58:51] He gives
[58:53] me strength as my name.
[59:01] Yes, he hid
[59:04] my soul
[59:07] in the gl of the rock
[59:12] that shadows
[59:15] and bright thirsty
[59:19] land.
[59:23] Yes, he hid
[59:26] my life
[59:29] in the depths of his love
[59:34] and covers
[59:37] me
[59:39] with his hand.
[59:42] [Music]
[59:45] And he covers
[59:48] me there
[59:50] with his hand. With numberless blessings
[59:53] each moment he crowns. And with
[59:57] numberless
[59:59] blessings,
[1:00:02] each moment
[1:00:04] he crowns
[1:00:07] and filled with his fullness
[1:00:12] divine.
[1:00:17] I sing
[1:00:20] in my rapture.
[1:00:23] Oh, glory to God
[1:00:28] for such
[1:00:31] a redeemer
[1:00:34] and
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] he hideth
[1:00:42] my soul
[1:00:44] in the depths of his
[1:00:50] all that shadows
[1:00:53] at your right thirsty
[1:00:56] hand.
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:00] Oh, he hide in my life
[1:01:06] in the depths of his love
[1:01:12] and
[1:01:15] be there

[1:01:23] And he follows
[1:01:25] me there
[1:01:28] with his hand.
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:47] [Music]
[1:01:57] [Music]
[1:02:26] Hey,
[1:02:31] [Music]
[1:02:39] [Music]
[1:02:55] Heat. Heat.
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:14] I pray.
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:38] Amen.
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:47] Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads for
[1:04:50] a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we thank
[1:04:52] you for covering us with your mighty
[1:04:57] hand of protection.
[1:04:59] Lord, we ask you to bless this portion
[1:05:02] of the service as we move forward in
[1:05:04] your word. Send your anointing upon us
[1:05:07] once again, Lord Jesus. Father, as we
[1:05:10] stand here, Lord, insufficient in
[1:05:13] ourselves, Lord, we claim you the
[1:05:16] sufficient one, the allsufficient one.
[1:05:19] You have exactly what we have need of.
[1:05:22] It is in you, Lord. And we pray that
[1:05:24] you'll bless us today. Bless every heart
[1:05:27] that's gathered here. Those that desire
[1:05:30] to be here and could not, the saints
[1:05:33] that are on the stream in Mesa, the
[1:05:37] different place. Oh God, bless every
[1:05:39] heart as we ask these things in Jesus
[1:05:43] name. Amen. Amen. So God bless each of
[1:05:47] you saints. So happy to be in the house
[1:05:49] of the Lord with you. We welcome each of
[1:05:52] you to the house of the Lord. Amen. Are
[1:05:54] you happy to be here?
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Certainly welcome you. Um I have a
[1:05:59] gentleman in the back. His name is
[1:06:00] Omero. He's from Colombia and this is
[1:06:04] his first time here with us today. Um
[1:06:07] I'm going to ask him to stand. Stand up.
[1:06:10] And let's make him feel welcome.
[1:06:14] [Applause]
[1:06:17] He speaks Spanish, so brother Ezekiel
[1:06:19] will be interpreting for him. Of course,
[1:06:21] it's good to see Sister Lori uh here
[1:06:24] with us this morning and each of you. So
[1:06:27] happy to have all of you. Amen. And so
[1:06:30] we'd like to go right into the word this
[1:06:32] morning. We will be observing
[1:06:35] footwashing and communion tonight and
[1:06:37] every one is welcome to be a part of
[1:06:40] that. Amen. Also,
[1:06:44] um
[1:06:46] I think we had
[1:06:50] uh a work day on Saturday. I want to
[1:06:52] thank the people, the brethren and the
[1:06:55] sisters that came together to help get
[1:06:57] those things done that uh needed to get
[1:07:00] done. And then we'll have another one
[1:07:02] that will be posted. Um hope, you know,
[1:07:06] we need to have another workday before
[1:07:07] our meetings. Amen. So, let's all stand
[1:07:10] to our feet and we'll go right into the
[1:07:12] scripture in the New Testament. Romans
[1:07:15] chapter 11.
[1:07:21] Always good to have uh those that were
[1:07:25] traveling back, Brother John and uh the
[1:07:28] Smiths. I can't think of any uh ever who
[1:07:31] else was traveling. We're so happy to
[1:07:32] have you back. Good to see
[1:07:35] uh you and keep those that are traveling
[1:07:38] in prayer. Romans chapter 11 verses 1-5.
[1:07:48] I say then hath God cast away his
[1:07:51] people? God forbid. For I also am an
[1:07:56] Israelite of the seed of Abraham of the
[1:07:59] tribe of Benjamin. God hath not cast
[1:08:02] away his people which he forneew.
[1:08:06] What ye not what the scripture saith of
[1:08:08] Elias? How he maketh intercession to God
[1:08:11] against Israel, saying, Lord, they have
[1:08:15] killed thy prophets, and dig down thine
[1:08:18] altars, and I am left alone, and they
[1:08:22] seek my life. But what saith the answer
[1:08:25] of God unto him? I have reserved to
[1:08:28] myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the
[1:08:33] knee to the image of Baal.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Even so then at this present time also
[1:08:41] there is a remnant according to the
[1:08:45] election of grace.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what we're going to
[1:08:49] talk just a little bit or maybe our
[1:08:51] title this morning is um a remnant
[1:08:55] according to election. May God bless
[1:08:58] you. You may be seated. We've been
[1:09:01] talking on this
[1:09:04] the little ones as we shared with you in
[1:09:08] the scriptures that these little ones
[1:09:11] are the unfortunate ones that Jesus was
[1:09:13] speaking of in um Matthew chapter 10 as
[1:09:17] he separated the sheep from the goats.
[1:09:20] He talked about how those that gave to
[1:09:23] the poor went to visit those in prison.
[1:09:27] those that were less fortunate that
[1:09:30] Jesus said in so much as you have done
[1:09:32] it unto the least of these you have done
[1:09:35] it unto me. So we took the least of
[1:09:38] these and we shared a few places out of
[1:09:42] the message where brother Vanam told us
[1:09:44] who these little ones are, who these
[1:09:47] least of these are. And he gives some
[1:09:49] examples of that pregnant lady that
[1:09:53] wanted to get her medication in the time
[1:09:57] of the depression and the drugist there
[1:10:00] told her they didn't have enough money
[1:10:02] was going to turn her away and something
[1:10:05] told his heart to know go and serve her
[1:10:08] and when he did he went to put it in her
[1:10:10] hands and he saw the face of our Lord
[1:10:12] Jesus saw his nail scarred hands and
[1:10:16] this was
[1:10:18] um a reminder of the scripture. When
[1:10:21] you've done this to the least of these,
[1:10:24] you have done it unto me. We also see
[1:10:26] where the great St. Martin in his great
[1:10:29] calling as a soldier, he cut half of his
[1:10:33] coat off to give it to a beggar one
[1:10:35] night, freezing cold. He wasn't even
[1:10:38] converted yet. And that night in a dream
[1:10:42] he saw the Lord
[1:10:44] standing in that old ragged coat that he
[1:10:47] given the beggar. And brother Adam says
[1:10:49] he knew then that God had called him.
[1:10:52] That was the that was his calling into
[1:10:54] the ministry and that he knew that if
[1:10:57] you do it to the least of these, you
[1:10:59] have done it unto me. And so we were
[1:11:01] talking about this and sharing a little
[1:11:04] bit of that, showing how Benjamin was
[1:11:08] the last son there with Jacob and the
[1:11:11] children of Israel. And Joseph was
[1:11:16] um
[1:11:18] um asking about him. Our Lord Jesus at
[1:11:21] the cross, I'm just giving a little
[1:11:23] background here. Our Lord Jesus at the
[1:11:25] cross, he says um all of you will be
[1:11:28] offended of me tonight because the
[1:11:30] scripture says smite the shepherd and
[1:11:33] the ski the sheep will scatter. He was
[1:11:36] quoting out of Zechariah 13. If you take
[1:11:39] that scripture, Zechariah 13, there's
[1:11:41] another portion that Jesus didn't
[1:11:44] mention. And he says, uh, smite the
[1:11:46] shepherd and the sheep will be
[1:11:49] scattered, but I will turn my hand upon
[1:11:52] the little ones.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam tell us those little ones
[1:11:56] are the Benjamin group, the 144,000
[1:11:59] that are now in existence today. Now,
[1:12:04] carnal, coldminded people are not
[1:12:06] realizing what's going on with Israel is
[1:12:10] prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:12:12] God is not going to forget Israel.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; No. No. The nations will and they will
[1:12:17] turn against them. But there is a little
[1:12:19] group
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; over there now and we call them the
[1:12:23] Benjamin group. They represent the
[1:12:26] 144,000.
[1:12:28] They will be revealed in their time. And
[1:12:31] so um and so just bringing that and and
[1:12:34] then moving forward into this election
[1:12:38] and the small group of people that maybe
[1:12:41] you don't know who they are, you don't
[1:12:42] see who they are, but there is an
[1:12:44] elected bride coming up even right now.
[1:12:48] One other type I'd like to share is the
[1:12:51] 11th hour worker.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; We are a type of the 11th hour worker.
[1:12:56] Who are they? they they showed up at the
[1:12:59] end of the day and the the hour uh the
[1:13:03] rate that they were getting paid per
[1:13:05] hour was the same as those that worked
[1:13:08] at the beginning of the day. And so the
[1:13:11] Lord poured upon them grace and favor
[1:13:15] and caught up all the lost time at the
[1:13:19] end of the day. Made a covenant with
[1:13:21] them and gave them everything that all
[1:13:24] the others had. And um we represent that
[1:13:29] group.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; We represent that 11th hour worker, that
[1:13:34] one that just barely made it in,
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; but he still made it in.
[1:13:40] and he gets the same pay as the one
[1:13:42] who's been here all along. How many love
[1:13:44] that?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; You represent that group today. And so I
[1:13:49] wanted to go forward in that thinking
[1:13:51] and that thought that God has a church
[1:13:53] that's being raised up now as Ramsy's is
[1:13:57] growing, Moses was growing, as Satan's
[1:14:01] powers was growing, the power of God is
[1:14:03] growing in the church. And let me say
[1:14:06] this here, the church that many of us
[1:14:09] are looking for um you know maybe the
[1:14:12] internet version or um a uh social media
[1:14:18] platform that we'll all be able to look
[1:14:20] at it and say, "Oh, that's the church
[1:14:21] over there." No, I don't think that's I
[1:14:24] don't think that's scriptural what we
[1:14:26] should be looking for. But God's going
[1:14:28] to have a church and he does present
[1:14:29] tense have a church. Now, if you don't
[1:14:33] see one here in your city, that still
[1:14:36] doesn't take away from the word of God.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; God is going to have a church. And he
[1:14:42] has a church.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about young people, old
[1:14:46] people, preachers, pastors, teachers,
[1:14:49] mamas, daddies, the whole gamut.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; The newcomer, the old-timer, he's got a
[1:14:55] church without spot or wrinkle,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; and they're growing. If we don't see
[1:15:00] them, they're still there because the
[1:15:02] word of God said that. So, here in our
[1:15:05] scripture in Romans chapter 11, as I
[1:15:08] said, I love the Old Testament and the
[1:15:11] Apostle Paul is pulling his text or he's
[1:15:16] quoting out of First Kings 19.
[1:15:20] If we'll turn there quickly,
[1:15:23] we'll
[1:15:25] speak on this
[1:15:28] remnant just for a moment.
[1:15:31] Here is the prophet Elijah. First Kings
[1:15:35] 19.
[1:15:37] He had a great outpouring of a
[1:15:40] manifestation where the Lord proved that
[1:15:43] he was right. In first kings chapter 18,
[1:15:46] you remember the story when the false
[1:15:49] prophets rose up against this true
[1:15:51] prophet Ahab and his team Jezebel his
[1:15:56] wife. They were in the politics. They
[1:15:58] had the power. They had everything going
[1:16:00] for them. And a and Elijah called for a
[1:16:04] showdown. Can I get a witness?
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He um first closes up the heavens
[1:16:12] and then he opens them back up again
[1:16:15] three years later. Then the Lord tells
[1:16:18] him to go see Elijah. He goes and sees
[1:16:20] him and Elijah comes and all the 400
[1:16:24] prophets come. This is representing
[1:16:26] Israel. We're not talking about the
[1:16:29] heathens and the false nations out
[1:16:32] there. We're talking about all Hebrews.
[1:16:34] talking about all of the children of
[1:16:37] Jehovah, the most the most high God. And
[1:16:40] so there's a showdown in that camp.
[1:16:44] Ahab, which is a king of Israel after
[1:16:47] the lineage of David, but yet he was a
[1:16:51] wicked man. He marries an unbeliever.
[1:16:55] And this unbeliever was a strong,
[1:16:57] influential woman by the name of
[1:16:59] Jezebel.
[1:17:01] Please don't name your daughter Jezebel.
[1:17:05] Don't name anything you have Jezebel
[1:17:08] because it represents a character in the
[1:17:11] Bible. And this Jezebel wooed and pushed
[1:17:16] and twisted and influenced Ahab to do
[1:17:20] more wicked than all the kings before
[1:17:22] him. He was married to a woman that
[1:17:26] influenced him, that turned him to do
[1:17:29] things that were not right. You might
[1:17:32] think you're strong and you might think
[1:17:34] you have the power to overcome
[1:17:36] influences, but if you're a man or a
[1:17:38] woman, you all are being influenced by
[1:17:42] something or somebody.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Every one of us are being influenced.
[1:17:47] That's what advertising is all about.
[1:17:50] This is what you wanting to do things a
[1:17:52] certain way is all about is because
[1:17:54] you're being influenced. It's not all
[1:17:57] bad and it's not all good. But this was
[1:17:59] a bad influence in this king's life. So
[1:18:03] the conflict was on. Elijah comes up.
[1:18:06] He's standing alone by himself and he's
[1:18:10] standing against 450 prophets and he has
[1:18:14] to
[1:18:16] manifest his ministry before them. As we
[1:18:19] know the story, the fire comes down. God
[1:18:23] vindicates him and kills those prophets.
[1:18:27] Then Elijah gets his sword and goes and
[1:18:30] slays all of them and he leaves.
[1:18:34] Now we get to First Kings 19. He's now
[1:18:38] leaving from this great uh Mount Carmel
[1:18:42] showdown. It was a great and tremendous
[1:18:44] victory. He said, 'If God be God, serve
[1:18:47] God. If Baal be God, serve Baal. And the
[1:18:51] God that answers by fire will vindicate
[1:18:54] who is telling the truth or not. And God
[1:18:58] answered by fire.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; He gave those prophets an opportunity to
[1:19:03] show that what they're saying, what they
[1:19:05] were saying was true. And they cut
[1:19:08] themselves and they waited and they
[1:19:10] prayed and they called on God. And then
[1:19:12] Elijah came out and mocked them a little
[1:19:14] bit. He says, "Where's your God at?"
[1:19:16] Maybe he's on vacation. Maybe he's
[1:19:18] sleeping. Maybe he can't hear. Cry a
[1:19:20] little louder. So they cry louder until
[1:19:23] the evening time. No fire, no
[1:19:25] vindication, no nothing. And then it was
[1:19:28] Elijah's turn. Standing before all of
[1:19:31] Israel to vindicate who was right and
[1:19:34] who was wrong. See, words are just that.
[1:19:37] They're just words. But when God
[1:19:39] vindicates the words, then you have a
[1:19:43] way now that you can choose to go on the
[1:19:47] Lord's side or not.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I will agree. All of the churches in the
[1:19:51] city, many churches, organizations, and
[1:19:53] denominations have their doors open and
[1:19:56] they all have something to say that
[1:19:59] we're right. We're better than them.
[1:20:00] They did this wrong. And we all have
[1:20:02] something to say. But the time is coming
[1:20:04] where God is going to prove who is
[1:20:06] right. And this was that time. We call
[1:20:10] it a showdown, a great showdown. So
[1:20:14] Elijah comes up there with his humble
[1:20:16] ministry. He comes down and he begins to
[1:20:20] repair the altar of the Lord. He puts
[1:20:22] the stones in place. He gets the
[1:20:25] sacrifice, places it in place, pours
[1:20:28] water on the sacrifices. Then he comes
[1:20:31] to Jehovah and he prays a simple prayer.
[1:20:34] He says, "Lord, I've done all this at
[1:20:37] your command.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Now prove and show today who is God."
[1:20:42] And then the fire from heaven came down,
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; consumed the sacrifice, licked up all
[1:20:50] the water. It was a great victory. And
[1:20:53] God proved that Elijah was right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the danger here. When you
[1:20:58] prove or God vindicates that you're
[1:21:01] right, remember it's not over yet. We
[1:21:04] call that a victory. And after a
[1:21:06] victory, Satan will always come and
[1:21:09] challenge you.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; So this woman threatens Elijah. And in
[1:21:14] her threat, she tells her husband Ahab
[1:21:17] and goes tells his wife. This is what
[1:21:19] Elijah did is she threatened his life.
[1:21:22] And this great and mighty prophet who
[1:21:25] just went through this great victory and
[1:21:27] God vindicated who he was. He takes off
[1:21:29] running and he's running for his life.
[1:21:33] And we find him here in First Kings 19.
[1:21:37] He goes a day's journey into the
[1:21:40] wilderness and he came and sat down
[1:21:44] under a juniper tree. Verse four. And he
[1:21:47] requested for himself that he might die
[1:21:50] and said, "It is it is enough now, oh
[1:21:55] Lord, take away my life, for I am not
[1:21:58] better than my fathers."
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Now, is this a man of God or not? Is
[1:22:04] this a true Christian, a true believer
[1:22:06] or not?
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; This is a true believer. This is a true
[1:22:09] man of God that got to a place where he
[1:22:12] felt so under the pressure and his
[1:22:16] nerves had got so bad that he asked God
[1:22:19] to take his life. He said, "I'm not
[1:22:21] better than the prophets that went
[1:22:23] before me." Brother Bham deals with this
[1:22:25] juniper tree experience
[1:22:29] and he breaks this message out, this um
[1:22:33] first kings chapter 19 into three
[1:22:36] places. It's the Mount Carmel showdown.
[1:22:39] There is the juniper tree and then there
[1:22:42] is coming into the cave. Now, we know
[1:22:48] that this um juniper tree,
[1:22:53] Elijah's alone. He's in the wilderness
[1:22:55] by himself. Sometimes we got to get
[1:22:57] alone.
[1:22:59] Um, you can't be um with everybody all
[1:23:03] the time and still have a spiritual walk
[1:23:06] with the Lord. You have to take time
[1:23:10] alone. I know a lot of us are very
[1:23:12] social social people. We like talking to
[1:23:15] people, like people over, coming
[1:23:17] together, riding with them, group text,
[1:23:20] group email, group uh fellowships and
[1:23:22] stuff. But every believer needs to find
[1:23:25] a place where they can get alone with
[1:23:27] the Lord.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus did it. He
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; called us to do it as well.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; You cannot be successful as a believer
[1:23:37] today if you don't have those times
[1:23:39] where you get alone.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; With God by yourself for yourself. It's
[1:23:47] better for your mind. It's better for
[1:23:50] your strength. It can recalibrate what
[1:23:53] you're doing in your life. You can take
[1:23:56] inventory without the outside voices
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and then influences going on. And I
[1:24:02] would challenge you today to find a
[1:24:05] place in the wilderness where you can
[1:24:07] get alone. I tell you, it's not easy.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; It really takes effort to go find a
[1:24:13] place to get alone with God. And this is
[1:24:17] Elijah. He's here. He's under the
[1:24:20] juniper tree and under this juniper tree
[1:24:23] begins to pour out his heart. This man
[1:24:25] actually wants God to take his life. I
[1:24:29] don't know if you ever got in a
[1:24:31] situation where you felt like you wanted
[1:24:35] God to take your life. I wonder if
[1:24:38] you've ever got in a situation where you
[1:24:39] felt like your life was not even worth
[1:24:42] that. You shouldn't even be here. You
[1:24:44] wanted to move out. You wanted to get
[1:24:47] away. He wanted to leave the earth
[1:24:50] because the pressures are too great.
[1:24:52] This is what happens to spiritual
[1:24:54] people. This happens to people that are
[1:24:56] God called that are absolutely
[1:25:00] God's elected go through these times
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; where they just want to quit.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Like Elijah says, it is enough.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you ever got to that point
[1:25:12] where you said, "It's enough."
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; I've reached my limit. It's enough. I
[1:25:17] quit.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I quit. I quit.
[1:25:22] This is where Elijah is. And he's
[1:25:25] calling out to God at this time. So, he
[1:25:28] begins to pray and then the Lord puts
[1:25:31] him to sleep. He lays him to sleep. He
[1:25:34] gives him a cake and then puts him back
[1:25:37] to sleep again. As he's sleeping, the
[1:25:39] angel of the Lord touches him a second
[1:25:41] time, raises him up, tells him to rise
[1:25:44] and eat, and puts him back to sleep
[1:25:47] again. And so, here is the angel and the
[1:25:51] Lord calling for Elijah to get some
[1:25:56] rest,
[1:25:58] to get some sleep.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; To stop running all the time. As I
[1:26:05] shared with the church on Thursday, I
[1:26:08] just had to made a cons conscious
[1:26:10] decision to stop eating in my truck,
[1:26:13] driving everywhere I go. I'm getting on
[1:26:15] the freeway, eating a meal there,
[1:26:17] getting on going over here while in
[1:26:19] between that eating. It's like I mean,
[1:26:22] what how crazy is that? I mean, how
[1:26:24] where where am I going? Stop
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; and pray for the food properly and then
[1:26:31] enjoy it.
[1:26:33] How you going to be eating a meal on the
[1:26:35] freeway going 55, 65, 75, getting off
[1:26:40] trying to open up the ketchup, trying to
[1:26:42] put the salsa on the little burrito or
[1:26:44] whatever? You got a big old mess going.
[1:26:47] What you doing? Are you driving or are
[1:26:49] you eating?
[1:26:51] Is this a supper? Is this supper time?
[1:26:54] What's going on? The the And that's not
[1:26:57] for everybody. That's for me. I said,
[1:26:59] you know what? I need to stop.
[1:27:02] I need to pull over. I need to thank the
[1:27:05] Lord for this meal
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; and enjoy it because wherever I'm going,
[1:27:12] he's already there.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; He's got time in his hand.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; He can slow the day down or he can speed
[1:27:21] the day up for you.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; He's in control
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; of every hour of the day. and you think
[1:27:29] your rushing is going to get things done
[1:27:32] better.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; It'd be better to be sound in your
[1:27:36] spirit with the Holy Spirit leading you
[1:27:39] and guiding you
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; than running up and down trying to
[1:27:44] manipulate the hours in the day
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; and then at the end of the day you throw
[1:27:51] together some prayer because it's what
[1:27:54] you need to do. But this rest, the the
[1:27:58] the Lord calls for it. And I think that
[1:28:01] as brother Bham explains, this juniper
[1:28:03] tree place is a place for believers to
[1:28:07] regroup and find themselves again. I'm
[1:28:10] going read a few quotations for you here
[1:28:12] in just a moment. Let me take this here
[1:28:15] as a prophet
[1:28:17] is talking about
[1:28:24] this juniper tree. Okay.
[1:28:28] What does thou hear 1959 paragraph 50?
[1:28:32] Now our story goes in three different
[1:28:34] places.
[1:28:36] One Mount Carmel, the next under the
[1:28:38] juniper tree. The third place God meets
[1:28:40] him is he's in a cave. It's very
[1:28:44] strange. Pastor here knows and other
[1:28:47] ministers, watch after your Mount
[1:28:50] Carmel, you're going to have a juniper
[1:28:53] tree. Whenever a man has a blessing and
[1:28:57] the power of God pours down and does
[1:28:59] something for you, look out. Satan is on
[1:29:03] the track. Just remember the next day,
[1:29:06] that Monday after a good day on Sunday
[1:29:11] is going to be a hard thing
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; because he's going to do everything he
[1:29:16] can
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; to knock that confidence out of you
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; that the Holy Spirit instilled in you
[1:29:24] the day before.
[1:29:26] So the Holy Spirit instills things in
[1:29:28] you, gives you beautiful things,
[1:29:31] victories, anointings, and then Satan
[1:29:34] comes afterwards and deals with you.
[1:29:39] Paragraph 58, same message. Brother
[1:29:42] Brandham says this here, "And I tell
[1:29:43] you, Elijah, his nerves on the edge."
[1:29:46] Anyhow, I always felt sorry for him. His
[1:29:50] nerves was about ready to break. Anyhow,
[1:29:53] and that great pound from Jezebel
[1:29:56] finished the stroke. Then he run and
[1:29:59] went into the wilderness and laid under
[1:30:00] the juniper tree. Oh, that experience of
[1:30:03] the juniper tree. There's many of us
[1:30:06] find ourselves under the juniper tree. I
[1:30:09] get myself under there many times to a
[1:30:12] place that you don't know what to do.
[1:30:15] You're frustrated.
[1:30:18] I think frustrated is the word
[1:30:20] flustered. and then frustrated. And
[1:30:23] brother Random calls it frustrated.
[1:30:26] Frankly, I'm right under it now and
[1:30:28] wondering, "Oh, God, what would you have
[1:30:31] me do?" How many's ever been there
[1:30:33] before?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; How many's there right now?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; You know, people under the juniper tree
[1:30:39] is like Elijah. They like to sleep.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; I preach to more tired people than
[1:30:45] anybody in the world. People is so
[1:30:48] tired.
[1:30:50] They they they're so mentally strained
[1:30:54] until they're filling the insane
[1:30:56] institutions in the hospitals
[1:30:58] everywhere. They're went in such nervous
[1:31:02] conditions till they don't know what
[1:31:04] they do believe and what they want.
[1:31:06] They're just laying there. They don't
[1:31:08] know what to do. Such a sad sight. And
[1:31:11] listen here. Uh uh uh um it's such a sad
[1:31:15] sight. And listen here, my brother. You
[1:31:17] can't drink it off. You can't shout it
[1:31:20] off. Neither can you play cards till
[1:31:22] it's dawn. You could take a thousand
[1:31:24] siestas and try to sleep it off. You
[1:31:27] can't do it. All of our little remedies,
[1:31:30] only thing it does is help the symptoms.
[1:31:32] We got to have a cure for the disease.
[1:31:36] All the psychiatrists in the world
[1:31:38] cannot cure it.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; It only helps the symptoms. The cure is
[1:31:44] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:47] not take a rest at the seashore, not go
[1:31:50] get an anthem, a choir to sing anthems.
[1:31:52] That's what we're trying to do today is
[1:31:54] sing it off.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham continues paragraph 63.
[1:31:59] There he laid under the juniper tree. He
[1:32:01] didn't know what to do. His nerves was
[1:32:05] broke. He was shaking. He was crying, no
[1:32:08] doubt. And he was in a terrible
[1:32:10] condition.
[1:32:12] Brother Bannam continues on under this
[1:32:14] juniper tree. It says, "Sometimes you
[1:32:17] feel like, as I did one time, put a
[1:32:20] pistol against my head to commit
[1:32:22] suicide, but I couldn't do it. I took my
[1:32:25] glove off to lay it on high voltage line
[1:32:28] where I was working, but I couldn't do
[1:32:29] it. Something still held."
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; The same God that was with Elijah, the
[1:32:35] same God today.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He seen me under the juniper tree. My
[1:32:41] wife and baby laying yonder in the
[1:32:42] grave. My daddy, my brother, and all. I
[1:32:46] was just about gone myself. I've laid
[1:32:49] under the juniper tree. It's hard. And
[1:32:51] I've got to a place I was so besides
[1:32:54] myself. I tried to make a gun and shoot
[1:32:57] my brains out. It wouldn't do it. See,
[1:33:00] there's work yet to be done. Something
[1:33:02] has to be done. God wasn't God wasn't
[1:33:06] finished. He'll always take care of you.
[1:33:09] poor, tired, weary servant, servant. He
[1:33:14] saw him. He knowed where he was. He
[1:33:18] knows where you are tonight.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; You may be under a juniper tree,
[1:33:22] everything gone. But remember, he knows
[1:33:25] where you're at.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; How many believe that?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; You get those gloomy times. You don't
[1:33:32] want to go forward. You don't know what
[1:33:34] to do. You're nervous. You're tired.
[1:33:38] just mentally tired. You slept all night
[1:33:41] and you wake up, you're still tired at
[1:33:44] the task at hand. You're tired to move
[1:33:47] forward. You're tired and you're under a
[1:33:52] juniper tree. I hope you get this
[1:33:53] message today.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I hope you know where your tiredness is
[1:33:57] coming from. Hope you know where that
[1:33:59] glooiness is coming from.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; It happens to the prophets. It happens
[1:34:05] to God's people. Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; It happens to all of us. And when it
[1:34:10] happens to us, we need a juniper tree.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; We need a juniper tree.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; We need to rest.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; We need to find a place alone with God.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Take one day off.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Just take it off
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; and go meet with the King of Kings and
[1:34:27] Lord of Lords.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm tired. I don't know which way
[1:34:31] to go. I'm trying to make ends meet. I'm
[1:34:35] trying to make it work. I'm trying to
[1:34:38] make everybody happy and nobody's happy.
[1:34:42] I don't know what to do. Lord,
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; go find a juniper tree.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Go take a day journey and rest a while.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Every believer needs to rest.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Go rest.
[1:34:59] Take some time.
[1:35:01] Get some rest.
[1:35:03] Matthew 6:31 says, "And he said unto
[1:35:06] them, come ye yourselves apart into a
[1:35:09] desert place and rest a while. For there
[1:35:14] were many coming and going," and they
[1:35:17] had no leisure so much as to eat.
[1:35:22] Who Who is he talking about?
[1:35:25] Is he reading my emails?
[1:35:29] coming and going,
[1:35:32] no leisure.
[1:35:34] What did Jesus tell them?
[1:35:36] Huh?
[1:35:39] What did he tell them?
[1:35:44] Where am I this morning?
[1:35:46] What did he tell him?
[1:35:49] Let's read it again. Mark 11:6:31.
[1:35:52] And he said unto them, can we get it on
[1:35:54] the screen
[1:35:58] for me, please? Thank you.
[1:36:01] He said unto them, let's all read
[1:36:03] together so we're all on the same page.
[1:36:05] All right. And he said unto them,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; "Come yourselves apart into a desert
[1:36:12] place and rest a while." So what did he
[1:36:15] tell him to do?
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Go rest a while. For there were many
[1:36:21] coming and going, and they had no
[1:36:23] leisure so much as to eat. And they
[1:36:27] departed into a desert place by a ship
[1:36:30] with who?
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Privately.
[1:36:36] You know how some people always want to
[1:36:37] be in contact with you. Want to know
[1:36:40] where you're at, what you're doing,
[1:36:41] where you at, what you're doing. You
[1:36:42] know, sometimes you just got to get
[1:36:44] alone.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at somebody and tell them, get
[1:36:48] alone.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and tell them get
[1:36:52] some rest.
[1:36:55] Jesus said it.
[1:36:58] You're running on fumes.
[1:37:01] You need to fill up.
[1:37:04] And your fill up doesn't come from other
[1:37:06] people.
[1:37:08] Your fill up doesn't come from
[1:37:10] fellowships
[1:37:12] and getting with other people. Those are
[1:37:14] things are great. They have their place.
[1:37:15] They have God gives us brothers and
[1:37:18] sisters to talk with and to fellowship
[1:37:20] with. But if our Christian experience is
[1:37:23] based on our friends around us and
[1:37:25] people always assuring us and always
[1:37:27] patting us on the back and always there
[1:37:29] for us, you know, that's not going to
[1:37:31] last.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; You've got to get alone with the
[1:37:35] invisible one.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; The one who settles things in your mind.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Settles things down in your heart and in
[1:37:44] your spirit
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; where he can speak to you. Matthewap 11
[1:37:49] verse 28. Come unto me all ye that labor
[1:37:53] and are heavy laden and I will give you
[1:37:55] rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:37:58] me for I'm weak and lowly in heart and
[1:38:01] ye shall find rest unto your souls. For
[1:38:04] my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[1:38:08] Luke 5:16,
[1:38:11] he withdrew himself into the wilderness
[1:38:15] and prayed. I like that. Matthew chapter
[1:38:21] 14 verse 13. When Jesus heard of it, he
[1:38:24] departed thence by a ship into a desert
[1:38:27] place apart. And when the people had
[1:38:29] heard thereof, they followed him on foot
[1:38:32] out of the cities. This is after um John
[1:38:36] the Baptist
[1:38:38] was was killed, was murdered. Matthew
[1:38:41] 14:23. And when he had sent the
[1:38:43] multitude away, he went up into the
[1:38:46] mountain apart to pray. And when the
[1:38:49] evening was come, he was there alone.
[1:38:53] This is our Lord Jesus. Matthew 14:23.
[1:38:57] He was there alone. Mark 1:35 says, "And
[1:39:02] in the morning,"
[1:39:04] I want us to get this one here,
[1:39:07] "Rising up a great while before day, he
[1:39:12] went out and departed into a solitary
[1:39:16] place, and there prayed."
[1:39:21] This is our Lord Jesus,
[1:39:24] the God of glory.
[1:39:26] He gets up early in the morning.
[1:39:30] We'll get up early in the morning for a
[1:39:32] men's trip. We'll get up early in the
[1:39:34] morning to catch our flight
[1:39:37] and we won't be late. We'll get to two
[1:39:39] hours. They said to be there before your
[1:39:40] We'll get up early in the morning to go
[1:39:43] to work
[1:39:45] because those are appointments
[1:39:47] that are set. I got to catch this
[1:39:50] flight. I got to be with this, you know,
[1:39:53] this group, this team. I got to be at
[1:39:55] work early. But here is an appointment
[1:39:58] where Jesus says that where Jesus gets
[1:40:01] up early in the morning and he withdraws
[1:40:05] himself apart to in a solitary place.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] And in the morning, Mark 135, you all
[1:40:21] have it there? It's on the screen.
[1:40:25] Little quiet this morning. It's okay.
[1:40:27] And in the morning, rising up a great
[1:40:29] while before day, he went out and
[1:40:32] departed into a solitary place, and
[1:40:35] there prayed.
[1:40:37] And it came to pass, Luke 6:12.
[1:40:42] And it came to pass in those days that
[1:40:44] he went out into a mountain to pray and
[1:40:48] continued all night in prayer to God.
[1:40:53] Who are we talking about?
[1:40:56] Someone more spiritual than all of us.
[1:41:00] Think of that.
[1:41:03] When the weakest Christian prays, it
[1:41:06] means something. Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Here's the founder of the church, the
[1:41:10] leader of all eternity, the king of
[1:41:14] glory in flesh. And while he was here,
[1:41:18] he developed
[1:41:20] that discipline of getting up early.
[1:41:23] Lord, help me.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; to get up early.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; We'll get up early to babysit our
[1:41:32] children. We'll get up early to dispense
[1:41:35] family times because of an appointment.
[1:41:37] But how about getting up early and
[1:41:41] finding a solitary place
[1:41:44] and there pray
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Lord help us. I pray
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Luke 9:28
[1:41:58] came to pass about 8 days after these
[1:42:00] things he took Peter, John, and James
[1:42:04] and went up into a mountain to not
[1:42:07] gossip
[1:42:09] but to pray.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Now, when you get out into these solid
[1:42:14] solitary places, you're not thinking
[1:42:17] about your work.
[1:42:20] You're not thinking about some advantage
[1:42:22] you can take because you're already up
[1:42:25] anyways. You're thinking about the Lord.
[1:42:29] You're coming to this place for prayer.
[1:42:33] And this is where he begins to unfold
[1:42:36] himself to you.
[1:42:38] It's beautiful. Just even meditating on
[1:42:41] the Lord,
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; getting away one afternoon. Sometimes
[1:42:45] you take a drive. Sometime you just take
[1:42:47] a drive. You just get out. You get out.
[1:42:49] Look in the mountains. Let the mountains
[1:42:51] preach to you. Look at the trees. Look
[1:42:53] at nature. Just get out apart and begin
[1:42:56] to think about the Lord
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and where you are in your life and where
[1:43:01] you're going and let the Holy Spirit
[1:43:03] begin to deal with you. You can't do
[1:43:07] that when you're connected all the time.
[1:43:10] You got to disconnect and get into this
[1:43:14] juniper tree. Let me take one more on
[1:43:16] the juniper tree here. What the prophet
[1:43:18] of God says
[1:43:20] about this juniper tree?
[1:43:27] And what hearest thou Elijah? 1959
[1:43:32] paragraph number 37. So what happened?
[1:43:35] He called them together and the God of
[1:43:37] heaven answered in a supernatural sign
[1:43:40] to Israel that he was still the God that
[1:43:42] could answer by fire. He did just what
[1:43:45] he always did. Answered prayer, kept his
[1:43:48] word. And after all this, still it
[1:43:51] wasn't sufficient.
[1:43:53] Little and little old Elijah, he didn't
[1:43:56] know what to do. So he run to the
[1:43:58] juniper tree. I'm glad that there is a
[1:44:01] juniper tree. All God's people needs to
[1:44:05] go to that juniper tree.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; It's a place where he was so
[1:44:10] discouraged. He didn't know what to do.
[1:44:14] So he ran out to himself and got under
[1:44:17] the juniper tree. Many of us feel like
[1:44:21] going there. And today when we see the
[1:44:24] institutions filled with people of God,
[1:44:26] nervous breakdowns, tensions, oh, it
[1:44:29] makes us all want to run to the juniper
[1:44:32] tree. I think if we could express it
[1:44:34] like the old colored lady said down
[1:44:37] south when she had been hit by an
[1:44:39] automobile, a car had struck her and
[1:44:41] they asked her if she wanted to sue for
[1:44:43] damages. She said, "Lordy, no, child. I
[1:44:48] don't need damage. I need repair."
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And I think that's about the way the
[1:44:54] church needs tonight is repair.
[1:44:58] a place under the juniper tree so we can
[1:45:02] be alone. This is where the repair
[1:45:05] happens is under the juniper tree. I
[1:45:08] thank God there is one.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; It's a juniper tree. I thank God there's
[1:45:12] a place that believers can go there when
[1:45:16] they're discouraged.
[1:45:18] How many's ever been discouraged? Some
[1:45:21] of you are discouraged now. Some of us
[1:45:23] has discouraging aspects of our life.
[1:45:27] All of us go through them. And this
[1:45:29] juniper tree is for that.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; But you got to go there alone.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; You don't go there with a group. You go
[1:45:35] there by yourself and you get alone with
[1:45:39] God
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; and you call out to God
[1:45:43] and you open up your heart.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Elijah was there. He was discouraged.
[1:45:48] This woman's trying to take his life and
[1:45:51] he's like, "I'm no better than the men
[1:45:53] that went before me. Lord, take my life.
[1:45:56] He was discouraged.
[1:45:58] So we see after the juniper tree, the
[1:46:02] angel puts him to sleep there, feeds him
[1:46:05] a cake, wake puts him back to sleep,
[1:46:07] wakes him up, does it twice, and then
[1:46:10] sends him on a journey, a very long
[1:46:12] journey, by the way, 40 days and nights
[1:46:15] he went into the strength because he had
[1:46:18] to go from Beerseba
[1:46:20] all the way to Horeb. And we know that
[1:46:24] Horeb is Mount Cyani as well. The
[1:46:29] scriptures use the the names are
[1:46:32] interchangeable. Cyani and Horeb. We
[1:46:34] heard it in the Sunday school this
[1:46:36] morning. This great mountain where God
[1:46:40] dwells. And this is where Elijah is now
[1:46:44] going to the mountain. He leaves from
[1:46:47] the great victory. Then he's under the
[1:46:49] juniper tree about taking his own life
[1:46:51] and wanting to die. And then the angel
[1:46:54] puts him to sleep. He gets his rest. He
[1:46:56] gets his repair. And he feeds him and
[1:46:59] tells him, "You got a long journey
[1:47:00] ahead." And he sends him on a journey in
[1:47:04] strength to go to Mount Hor. Where's
[1:47:06] Mount Horb? Where is Mount Cyani? Well,
[1:47:09] that's where Moses went. That's where
[1:47:12] the Ten Commandments came down. This is
[1:47:16] a be a special place that God has shown
[1:47:21] himself to be there. And in those on
[1:47:23] this mountain
[1:47:25] side, in this mountain range, there was
[1:47:28] a cave. And in this cave, oh my, he got
[1:47:34] into this cave alone, didn't he? And
[1:47:37] what happened in the cave? He started to
[1:47:42] uh uh uh call out to the Lord this
[1:47:45] prayer in Romans 11. They've killed all
[1:47:49] the prophets, Lord. They've slain your
[1:47:52] servants. They didn't hear what I said.
[1:47:54] And I'm the only one left. I'm so
[1:47:56] discouraged. I preach exactly what you
[1:47:59] told me to say. You have vindicate me
[1:48:02] over and over in all these years. And I
[1:48:05] get out here and you vindicate me and
[1:48:07] still there's not even I'm the only one
[1:48:11] left in all of Israel. He didn't know
[1:48:15] that there was a remnant there. Amen.
[1:48:19] Can I keep going for a few more moments?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; He didn't know that there was a remnant
[1:48:23] there. And that remnant were the 7,000.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; This is beautiful. I love this
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; because just because Elijah didn't know
[1:48:34] them, it don't mean that God didn't know
[1:48:37] them.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And just because the world don't know
[1:48:41] who these people are, God knows exactly
[1:48:43] who these people are. And when he got up
[1:48:46] in the cave and God began re to reveal
[1:48:50] the opening of the word, he says,
[1:48:52] "Elijah, you're not alone.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; I got 7,000.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; 7,000.
[1:49:01] I've numbered them. They have never
[1:49:04] bowed their knee. They never kiss bell.
[1:49:07] I got them in my hand. They're mine.
[1:49:10] Elijah,
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; it's beautiful.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. Let's give the Lord a
[1:49:14] hand of praise.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; That hidden church, that secret church,
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; that little neighborhood church, that
[1:49:28] little mama, that little daddy that's
[1:49:30] got the Holy Ghost,
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; that true believer.
[1:49:35] God knows who they are.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; The messenger of the age didn't even
[1:49:40] know who he who they were.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; He just had this great thing. He knows
[1:49:44] Israel. He knows them. He had this great
[1:49:46] victory, this great outpouring. And he's
[1:49:48] praying to the Lord. He says, "I am the
[1:49:51] only one left.
[1:49:53] I want to leave." Oh, Elijah, don't
[1:49:56] think like that. I got 7,000. How many,
[1:49:59] Lord? 7,000.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, really? Yes, I got them.
[1:50:06] They have not bowed their knees.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Who are these 7,000? Can we get into it?
[1:50:14] Will you say amen if we do?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:50:20] Who are these 7,000? Let's talk about
[1:50:22] him just a little bit. Okay.
[1:50:26] Bless his wonderful name.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; So Elijah now
[1:50:33] is in prayer.
[1:50:35] He's in his
[1:50:38] cave.
[1:50:40] He's in a holy mountain spot that the
[1:50:43] Lord has dealt with great men like Moses
[1:50:46] up there in this cave.
[1:50:50] And here the prophet of God says in the
[1:50:52] forgotten biatitude 1961, he says this
[1:50:54] here quickly. He says,
[1:50:57] "But God said, "No, I got 7,000 more
[1:51:00] that had never bowed their knee to Balum
[1:51:03] yet." See? See? But I that's all right,
[1:51:06] Elijah. You're doing a great work, but I
[1:51:09] still got another bunch you see that you
[1:51:13] don't know yet.
[1:51:15] But take my life. I'm not more than my
[1:51:17] father's. But the prophets was and
[1:51:19] that's Elijah. But madam continues on
[1:51:22] says in the message of true sign that's
[1:51:24] overlook.
[1:51:25] He says Jehovah does care.
[1:51:28] It's got to be his word. And Elijah
[1:51:31] stood boldly on that word with thus said
[1:51:33] the Lord. God gave him a little secret.
[1:51:36] One day, he said, "I got 7,000 Elijah
[1:51:40] that you're a witness to
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; out here." They haven't got the nerve
[1:51:46] enough to come out and claim it.
[1:51:49] They're hiding around in bushes,
[1:51:53] but yet in their heart, they're my
[1:51:55] servants.
[1:51:57] They haven't bowed a knee to Balum.
[1:51:59] They're afraid to do it. But I'm giving
[1:52:02] you a sign and you are a sign. Stand out
[1:52:05] there and stand on my word. I'll take
[1:52:08] care of you. Give them a sign.
[1:52:11] Hallelujah.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; So these 7,000, they were there, weren't
[1:52:15] they?
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Didn't have the courage yet, but in
[1:52:19] their heart, they were true believers,
[1:52:21] hiding in bushes,
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; hiding around Circle K, maybe
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; hiding in the hood,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; hiding on the college campus. There's
[1:52:31] more believers out there than perhaps
[1:52:32] you realize.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; You think everybody that believes is
[1:52:36] here. There's some believers in God's
[1:52:40] economy.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; And God knows exactly you was one of
[1:52:46] them. One day you was a believer.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Always a believer.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Out there in the world doing whatever
[1:52:55] you were doing, but in your heart, you
[1:52:57] wanted something genuine. Is that right?
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Didn't Elijah find you?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; The message people don't know who you
[1:53:06] are.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Message folks that are in, they don't
[1:53:09] know what's going on on the south side
[1:53:12] or the north side or in the prisons.
[1:53:14] They don't know. They think everybody
[1:53:16] that's we're the only ones. Is that how
[1:53:20] we think?
[1:53:22] Like the brother I think it's Aaron
[1:53:23] Garrett gives that it's kind of a humor.
[1:53:25] He says that in heaven there was these
[1:53:28] different groups, the Baptists over
[1:53:30] there praising the Lord, other
[1:53:31] Christians praising the Lord and and
[1:53:33] there was another little spot. He he
[1:53:35] looked in there and and these people
[1:53:37] over there praising the Lord and he
[1:53:39] said, "Who is that? Those are the
[1:53:40] message people, but sh they think
[1:53:43] they're the only ones here."
[1:53:46] I thought that was kind of comical, kind
[1:53:48] of funny because sometimes we think
[1:53:51] we're the only one that God loves. But
[1:53:54] I'm so glad
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; that he loves my family. He loves my
[1:54:00] loved ones. He loves the one that are
[1:54:02] not walking in the word. He knows who
[1:54:05] they are and is not my business or
[1:54:08] Elijah's business. God opened up the
[1:54:11] seal and showed them I got 7,000
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; that never bowed their knee.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; There's some believers out there.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:24] Oh my.
[1:54:27] Prophet of God continues in the message
[1:54:29] the fourth seal. Now this one you have
[1:54:32] to say amen to. All right.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 366. He says, "Look, Elijah
[1:54:37] never knew even one of them was that
[1:54:40] way. He thought he was the only one
[1:54:43] saved
[1:54:45] until God opened one of the seals
[1:54:49] and showed him in the mystery in the
[1:54:51] book." Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; That he had 700
[1:54:55] that never bowed down to them creeds
[1:54:58] that they had
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; when God opened his book to Elijah. Now
[1:55:04] wait a minute, son. I got 700 that's
[1:55:07] tucked around out there that's got their
[1:55:10] name on the book since the foundation of
[1:55:12] the world. They're mine.
[1:55:16] God opened the seals.
[1:55:19] That's the reason I think John was doing
[1:55:21] a lot of shouting the other night.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; He must have seen his name on there. You
[1:55:25] see,
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; one day God opened. Elijah had preached.
[1:55:30] He had done everything. Preached his
[1:55:32] heart out. He done everything he could
[1:55:34] and still they're just hottie. Called
[1:55:36] him everything. Said, "You're the cause
[1:55:38] of all of this. You're the spiritualist.
[1:55:40] You're the one who makes all this
[1:55:41] trouble to come. You're guilty." And
[1:55:43] everything like that. He said
[1:55:45] everything. They said everything to him.
[1:55:46] Jezebel threatened to cut his head off.
[1:55:49] Everything else, that's right. Everybody
[1:55:50] was against him. And then he said,
[1:55:53] "Lord, after I've done that, all you
[1:55:55] told me to do, I've stayed exactly with
[1:55:58] your word. When you told me anything, I
[1:56:01] was fearless. I walked right into the
[1:56:02] king's face and everything else and told
[1:56:05] them, "Thus sayeth the Lord, you haven't
[1:56:07] told me a thing. I have not told them
[1:56:10] one thing." But what happened? Now here
[1:56:12] I am, the only one left. out of the
[1:56:15] whole bunch, I'm the only one left and
[1:56:18] they're trying to kill me.
[1:56:22] God said, I'm going to open up one of
[1:56:24] the seals and show you something.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He says, you know, I got 700 back there
[1:56:31] that ain't never bowed to me.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Join any of them creeds yet
[1:56:35] denomination? There are 700 of them
[1:56:39] ready for the rapture.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Now, who's he talking about? Elijah in
[1:56:45] the Old Testament or Elijah
[1:56:49] who had the seven seals
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; who's going in the rapture.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Which Elijah is he talking about saints?
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Ah yes I have 700 through the scripture
[1:57:03] I have 700 prepared names. Yet out of
[1:57:07] this generation 700 of them they have
[1:57:10] not bowed their knees to any. If I say
[1:57:13] it in this day, religious organizations
[1:57:17] see come see and brother Bham continues
[1:57:20] on. So here's a very nice thing. So
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; I think if you're counting that message,
[1:57:28] he says 700.
[1:57:32] I think he said it seven times.
[1:57:35] So maybe it's 700. Maybe there's a
[1:57:37] spiritual and I've heard that that that
[1:57:42] uh version too. And so which is it 700
[1:57:45] or 7,000?
[1:57:47] Huh?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Thank you, Lord."
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Huh? Is it 700 or 7,000?
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Does it really matter?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Long as you're one of the number.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? So whether whether
[1:58:04] it's 7,500 I heard a number there's 500
[1:58:07] in the bride elected and it just so
[1:58:10] happens you know we took up most of
[1:58:12] those numbers here in the US.
[1:58:14] Uh too bad for the rest of the nations
[1:58:17] that are going in the rapture. You know
[1:58:19] what kind of what kind of people are so
[1:58:21] interested in how many are actually
[1:58:23] going in the rapture? It's like, you
[1:58:26] know, you've been invited to get into
[1:58:29] this great uh uh building for whatever
[1:58:32] show and you get in there and it says
[1:58:35] they have seats for so many people.
[1:58:37] Okay, fine. Great. You got a seat for
[1:58:39] me? Yeah. Okay, I'm good. That's it.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; Y'all got a seat for me and my family?
[1:58:44] Oh, absolut Oh, great. It doesn't matter
[1:58:47] how many other seats are there long as
[1:58:49] there's a seat there for me. And if I am
[1:58:53] going in the rapture, that's all that
[1:58:56] counts.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; So we might argue if it's 700 because he
[1:59:06] said it seven times. Now remember
[1:59:09] spiritual catch it
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; right even though he corrected it. Oh
[1:59:14] don't no don't don't take that. You got
[1:59:16] to take what he you know how they do. I
[1:59:18] know how they do. So you just got to
[1:59:20] stay with the what what he said and what
[1:59:22] difference does it make at the end of
[1:59:23] the day? Whatever doctrine you're
[1:59:25] following, so what what next? What is it
[1:59:30] going to do for you?
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Is it causing you to draw closer to him?
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. So he opens up one of the seals.
[1:59:40] Another place he says he shows Elijah a
[1:59:43] secret that there was this remnant
[1:59:46] there. the secret that there were 7,000
[1:59:50] that he didn't even know about. I think
[1:59:52] that's beautiful. I love it. In flashing
[1:59:56] red lights of the sign of his coming,
[1:59:58] the prophet of God says this here.
[2:00:04] Jezebel refused to hear the word of the
[2:00:06] Lord. She wouldn't want to call that old
[2:00:07] fuzzy looking preacher Elijah her
[2:00:10] pastor. But he was her pastor anyhow,
[2:00:13] right? God sent him and he bellowed out
[2:00:16] his message. Though uneducated, they
[2:00:20] don't know where he come from or where
[2:00:22] he went to. He came on the scene with
[2:00:25] the word of the Lord. He sent his
[2:00:28] message that he preached. He condemned
[2:00:30] everything that was called sin that the
[2:00:33] modern Jezebel had switched and
[2:00:35] bewitched the people under the
[2:00:36] witchcraft of her powers until the whole
[2:00:39] nation was corrupted. And Elijah stood
[2:00:42] alone out there on the mountain. God
[2:00:45] said, "Elijah, don't think that. I've
[2:00:47] got 7,000
[2:00:49] down there." That's honest in heart.
[2:00:52] Yet, that's his second pool. And the
[2:00:57] third one went back for them.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, nice. Nice.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Nice. The second pool showed who the
[2:01:06] 7,000 were. The third pool went back to
[2:01:09] get them.
[2:01:11] the Lord.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother. Is that what you trying to
[2:01:13] say? I ain't trying to say nothing. I'm
[2:01:15] trying to say amen. That's what I'm
[2:01:17] trying to say to the word. His third
[2:01:19] pool went back and got, you know, Moses
[2:01:22] and Elijah are coming back.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Revelations 11 says that
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; they come back. Did you know they were
[2:01:30] on Mount Transfiguration?
[2:01:32] Did you know they both went to the same
[2:01:34] Mount Horeb
[2:01:36] on on this Mount Horeb on Mount Si?
[2:01:39] That's where God appeared to Moses in
[2:01:41] the burning bush. Exodus 3. It's also
[2:01:44] where Moses received the Ten
[2:01:46] Commandments in Deuteronomy 5. And then
[2:01:50] we here we see that Elijah now is
[2:01:53] getting a revelation of the 7,000 in the
[2:01:57] cave on the same mountain. Now, God is
[2:02:01] into mountains.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; And it just so happens in our city, we
[2:02:06] have a beautiful one. And I'm not
[2:02:08] talking about a mountain
[2:02:12] or twin peaks or the sovere. I ain't
[2:02:14] talking about none of them mountain.
[2:02:15] They're beautiful. They're nice. But
[2:02:17] that's not the mountain that's on the
[2:02:18] map for us.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; There is a mountain where there's some
[2:02:23] beautiful things took place.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm not ashamed of them. Are you?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; What happened in these mountains? A
[2:02:31] sword came down. A revelation came down.
[2:02:35] Revelations of marriage and revelation
[2:02:38] of the truth of God of the third pool.
[2:02:41] The furtherance of the ministry. Seven
[2:02:43] angels come down. The revelation of the
[2:02:46] seals. The opening of the word on this
[2:02:50] Catalina mountain range in this uh
[2:02:54] sunset mountain, Sabino Canyon, Puma
[2:02:57] Canyon. The whole mountain range was put
[2:03:00] on the map in God's great economy. Just
[2:03:03] like the mountain in Mount Si was right.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; A sword came down in that mountain over
[2:03:10] there.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; It did come down. How do you know?
[2:03:14] Something in my soul told me so. How do
[2:03:17] you know? The prophet said so. I believe
[2:03:19] his word. That's what happened in these
[2:03:22] mountains here.
[2:03:26] I wonder
[2:03:29] if the prophet
[2:03:31] in 1963 when the seals was open, I
[2:03:35] wonder if the Lord would have opened up
[2:03:37] the seals of time and showed him the
[2:03:41] future of 2025,
[2:03:43] would he see you?
[2:03:46] It's a beautiful thought, isn't it?
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; Because God saw you.
[2:03:52] And if God wanted the prophet to know,
[2:03:55] he would have let him know. But he
[2:03:57] doesn't let the prophet know everything.
[2:03:58] Just how that's how Elijah was. Elijah
[2:04:01] didn't know. He thought he was the only
[2:04:04] one. But God showed him that there were
[2:04:08] 7,000 that didn't bow their knees.
[2:04:14] I want to be a part of that 7,000.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that 700.
[2:04:20] I want to be a part of that 500.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that hundred.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Actually, I only need one space.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of the number that's
[2:04:34] going in the rapture.
[2:04:37] Let's go a little bit further here. What
[2:04:40] does thou hear? No,
[2:04:44] let's go a little bit further here. The
[2:04:45] prophet of God takes this here. My time
[2:04:49] is gone. God bless you.
[2:04:53] And
[2:04:55] see what he says in the souls that are
[2:04:58] in prison now. 1963.
[2:05:01] Notice when Jezebel rose on the scene,
[2:05:03] there was a man rose up against it.
[2:05:07] God brought a man. We don't know even
[2:05:09] know where he come from. He had no
[2:05:11] background of ministry. He never was a
[2:05:13] priest or nothing. He come forth an old
[2:05:16] rugged woodsman by the name of Elijah.
[2:05:19] He laid the axe to the root of the tree.
[2:05:21] They hated him. Not only that, but his
[2:05:24] whole congregation hated him. And one
[2:05:27] time he thought he stood alone. He says,
[2:05:29] "No, I got 7,000 yet. That's right with
[2:05:33] you." See, that was that elected group.
[2:05:38] See, there is always that group said,
[2:05:41] "Don't fear Elijah. I know you think
[2:05:45] you're run out because the denominations
[2:05:47] run you up there on top of the hill, but
[2:05:49] said I got 7,000 that believes the same
[2:05:53] thing you're preaching.
[2:05:56] See, I got them.
[2:05:59] Now, are you a part of the group that
[2:06:01] believe the same thing that he's
[2:06:03] preaching?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; That's an identification
[2:06:08] right there.
[2:06:10] There's a group that's not believing 90%
[2:06:12] of it or part of it. They're believing
[2:06:15] the same thing that's being preached in
[2:06:20] the tape ministry.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; They're believing it. They're standing
[2:06:25] with it. There's a number. There's a
[2:06:28] evening seed. There's a remnant that's
[2:06:31] believing it. and they're standing with
[2:06:34] the word 100%
[2:06:37] with what's on the tape ministry. You
[2:06:40] know, many have changed and they'll
[2:06:42] continue to change. Huh? But there's a
[2:06:44] group that believes exactly the way he
[2:06:47] believes. And Elijah didn't even know
[2:06:49] who they were.
[2:06:52] Didn't even know who they were until God
[2:06:54] showed him.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Don't be so discouraged. You're not by
[2:06:58] yourself. Elijah, I got 7,000.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Let me take one last quote. and events
[2:07:04] made clear by prophecy.
[2:07:08] Paragraph 69. The Bible says they were
[2:07:11] raised up to take that place. They was
[2:07:13] raised for that purpose. That's true.
[2:07:15] Romans 8 says that now the believers can
[2:07:18] see the word is made flesh in their
[2:07:21] generation.
[2:07:23] God speaking.
[2:07:25] Now them real true believers, them 7,000
[2:07:29] or was it 700 in the days of Elijah?
[2:07:32] 7,000 is right. In the days of Elijah,
[2:07:36] there was 7,000 men out of about two or
[2:07:39] three million that saw that that was
[2:07:43] right.
[2:07:45] Not even a hundth of the people, Harley,
[2:07:47] but they saw it was right. They saw God
[2:07:51] manifested.
[2:07:53] The old widow. And he brother goes on.
[2:07:56] Let me take that one more time. Now the
[2:07:59] believers can see the word is made flesh
[2:08:01] in their generation.
[2:08:04] Can you see that?
[2:08:07] Or there's a lot of mistakes and it's
[2:08:09] not the same. It's this and that. The
[2:08:11] same sun that rose in the east is the
[2:08:14] same sun that sets in the west. Not sun
[2:08:18] like it. It's the same sun. You wake up
[2:08:21] in the morning, the sun rises in the
[2:08:23] east. It's the same sun. And the gospel
[2:08:26] has traveled that way. And the light
[2:08:28] that comes down isn't a junior light.
[2:08:32] Isn't a secondary light. It is the light
[2:08:36] itself that has come down. The same sun
[2:08:40] from the east is the same sun that's
[2:08:43] setting in the west under this ministry.
[2:08:46] What is it doing? It's revealing who
[2:08:49] these 7,000 are. They're standing with
[2:08:52] Elijah.
[2:08:54] They're with his ministry.
[2:08:56] Baal and a Ahab and Jezebel has taken up
[2:09:02] the whole nation and all it looks like
[2:09:04] is just Ahab and Jezebel's people and
[2:09:07] all that they had to offer. That's all
[2:09:09] you saw. That's all Elijah saw. That's
[2:09:12] all everybody saw. But God saw another
[2:09:15] little number.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; And this little number was actually
[2:09:20] standing with Elijah.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Beautiful, isn't it? Yes. Amen.
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; Standing with Elijah.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; The believers can see the word is made
[2:09:31] flesh in our generation. God speaking
[2:09:34] them real true believers. Believers
[2:09:38] 7,000 or was it 700 in the days of
[2:09:41] Elijah? 7,000
[2:09:44] is right. So this was revealed to him in
[2:09:48] the cave.
[2:09:51] What's the cave? The cave is
[2:09:54] that secret place
[2:09:57] where when you get along with God,
[2:09:59] there's a lot of things that might come
[2:10:00] and grab and try to grab your attention.
[2:10:03] As I close, let's just take one
[2:10:05] scripture in first Kings chapter 19 just
[2:10:09] for a moment. Verse 12, it says verse
[2:10:13] 11, the Lord tells him to go stand up on
[2:10:15] the rock.
[2:10:19] And behold, the Lord passed by, and a
[2:10:22] great strong wind
[2:10:25] the mountains, and breaking in pieces
[2:10:27] the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord
[2:10:30] was not in the wind.
[2:10:32] And after the wind, an earthquake. But
[2:10:35] the Lord was not in the earthquake. And
[2:10:37] after the earthquake, a fire. But the
[2:10:40] Lord was not in the fire. And after the
[2:10:44] fire, a still small. Does he still speak
[2:10:48] in a still small voice?
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; That's how he speaks to you today.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Now, does the Lord use the wind? Yes.
[2:10:57] There's scriptures I can show you that
[2:10:58] the Lord was in the wind. Does the Lord
[2:11:01] use the earthquake? Yes. I can show you
[2:11:03] where he spoke through the earthquake.
[2:11:05] Is the Lord in the fire? The Bible says
[2:11:07] he's a consuming fire.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; But that's not one of those times. This
[2:11:12] time year, the Lord sends the wind,
[2:11:14] sends the fire, sends the earthquake,
[2:11:17] and then he wasn't in none of it. Then a
[2:11:20] still small voice. Every Christian,
[2:11:25] every man or woman, boy or girl, needs
[2:11:28] to have this still small voice speaking
[2:11:31] to them.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the Lord.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; It's the voice of the word. And you can
[2:11:38] find that voice in the cave somewhere.
[2:11:45] You know, David was in the cave and he
[2:11:47] read wrote a couple of his psalms.
[2:11:50] He was on the run. Remember one time
[2:11:53] David ran into the cave and the man that
[2:11:55] was chasing him ran into the same cave
[2:11:59] and David his men are in this cave and
[2:12:02] then Saul says, "Hey, let's get some
[2:12:04] shelter. Let's go into that cave."
[2:12:05] They're coming to the cave and David's
[2:12:07] in the cave with this man like
[2:12:11] and Saul is looking for David.
[2:12:14] Saul was looking for David and they're
[2:12:16] all in the same cave.
[2:12:20] His enemy was after him in the same room
[2:12:24] and couldn't even find him.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; You know, God knows how to hide a
[2:12:28] believer.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; And he'll hide a believer and use him as
[2:12:32] a secret weapon many times.
[2:12:35] He He hid David. Here's Saul in the
[2:12:38] cave. They're in this cave all hiding.
[2:12:41] One's looking. The other one's running
[2:12:43] from. And the Lord puts Saul's men to
[2:12:47] sleep.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; And David gets up.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; Okay, David. This is your time to get
[2:12:52] them. The Lord has delivered your enemy
[2:12:55] in your hand. What did David do? No. No,
[2:12:59] no, no. I won't touch the Lord's
[2:13:00] anointed.
[2:13:02] That's the God that we serve.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; How many know that you're hidden today?
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Where's your hiding place? Your hiding
[2:13:11] place is in Christ.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; He'll hide you from the storms. He'll
[2:13:16] hide you from the troubles. He'll hide
[2:13:19] you from even your enemies. Even if they
[2:13:22] happen to follow you in the same cave,
[2:13:27] when it's time for the Lord
[2:13:31] to give you the victory, he will give
[2:13:33] you the victory.
[2:13:35] But this all happens in the still small
[2:13:37] voice and the voice, the voice of his
[2:13:39] word. We pray that God will bless you
[2:13:42] remnant seeds,
[2:13:45] you 7,000 or 700, you faithful few, and
[2:13:50] we'll find a time to get a part
[2:13:54] to pray
[2:13:56] in a solitary place and get along with
[2:13:59] him and let him reveal his will to you.
[2:14:02] God bless you. Let us pray. Amen.
[2:14:06] Amen. God bless you. Let us pray. Lord
[2:14:11] Jesus,
[2:14:12] thank you for your word today. Let it
[2:14:15] find its resting place in the heart of
[2:14:19] your people.
[2:14:21] Lord, visitors in the midst, our
[2:14:23] brother,
[2:14:25] young people, families, friends. Lord,
[2:14:29] let each one receive their portion from
[2:14:32] you.
[2:14:34] Oh God, as you speak to us in a still
[2:14:37] small voice, how many times, how many
[2:14:40] times have we decided to do things our
[2:14:44] own way, but a little voice will tell us
[2:14:47] not to do that or wait
[2:14:51] or don't don't go there or go here,
