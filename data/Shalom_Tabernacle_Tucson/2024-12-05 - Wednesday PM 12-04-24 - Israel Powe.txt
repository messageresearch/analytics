house of the Lord with you uh this evening amen welcome you to the house of the Lord so good to hear brother will that special I think that's his first time doing that God bless him richly amen all right so right in the scriptures in 1 Peter chapter 3 we like to turn there just for a moment thank you musicians so good to have our brother George back I heard good reports from his meetings there and uh some of you saints that wasn't feeling well that has made it back God bless you good to have each of you back we'll go take this little subject we were we started a week or two ago on respects and we want to continue just to take another portion of that I think it was on the 17th yeah a couple Sundays ago and then we listened to the tape respects and so let's take our script scures 1 Peter chapter 3 in verse S likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being hirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered amen one more scripture found over in Psalms 105 I believe it's Psalms 105 and the scripture says here verse number 12 when they were but a few men in number yeah very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes saying touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so brother banam as we know he takes that scripture and he preaches the message respects and the last week that we were here we we were talking to you about how we want to get God's respect and really you know it be nice if everybody respected us like they should and we respected everyone like we should but as I was meditating even on that thought if I had to choose one or the other and I pose that to you to would you rather everyone respect you perfectly or would you rather have that ability to handle the way anyone would treat you and um I think from Brother Billy Paul's own testimony talking about his dad he said that was one of his greatest things that he noticed he knew how to handle every situation and so it's going to be now if you choose the first and you expect expect everyone to treat you respectfully perfectly at all times that is not even going to happen if you're the only one in the room exactly and if we go around thinking or expecting everyone to treat us properly at all times that's just not going to happen but I can achieve the goal or look forward to the goal of re acting to whatever comes my way properly and respectfully so we took a little bit of of that in how God respected Abel's sacrifice and how in James it says it is a sin to have respect of persons it's actually a sin now I want to turn there quickly because that dealt with we got into Peter and to Paul and how they Peter had a hard time accepting the Gentiles into the kingdom because of their nationality because of their race because of whatever the way Peter was raised and that was a hindrance for him and it happens to all types of people all walks of life human beings have this problem the disciples had this problem and in James chapter 1 in verse number what scripture am I looking for Saints yes verse number no not 13 no not seven all right let's go back may we're in James chapter 2 then yes 21 and then it goes down so we'll take two verses one my brethren have not the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the lord of Glory with respect of persons then he goes into how if a rich man comes into the assembly I will give him preferential treatment but verse number nine says this very clearly and this looks at all of us in the face but if you have respect to persons what does it say ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors so when you respect people over other people um that's not scriptural then James says it's a sin and this is a weakness that we all can fall pre to you know part of foot washing and communion deals with this when you go down to wash somebody's feet who you perceive is beneath you are not worthy of your time to I mean I sure I'll wash this important person's feet or this person I know their feet are probably clean so I'll be more comfortable you know you need to check that you really do you have people in the congregation that you can't wash their feet that's probably a you problem it's a human problem but you need to deal with that and the scriptures don't lie and the scriptures not pointing at you or pointing at me it's pointing at all of us and this is what the Bible says he's talking about a man with Godly apparel comes in looking sharp looking nice and you go into a restaurant they're going to treat you a certain way and I get off of work and I'm in my painting clothes I have overspray on me and I go into some circle Cavs they're going to treat me a certain way I go into that same Circle K on a Sunday they're going to treat me a certain way I'm the same person they don't know me just like they didn't know me before but looking on the outside to begin to judge and to have respect of persons it is sin and that happens in churches so God help us right and so but there is a respect that we are to have for one another brother bam or the scriptures talking about um those that labor and the word to have double honor for them it speaks about that how we're to love and respect husband and wife love and respect each other but tonight I just want to deal with the respect of the weaker vessel and this is the respect the husband should have towards his wife and it goes even uh on the spiritual application I think it's in the um Ephesians chap Church age book the prophet of God says this here I don't think I gave that to you sis but if you can find it for me that'd be great it says the Ephesians Church AG says how beautifully the Savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows that there is weakness amongst them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the Lord he knows how to encourage Us in the right matters and discourage Us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here in running the church and our families and better still we could all learn a good lesson in that God deals with each one of us in exactly this way don't ever be discouraged s of God for God is Not ungracious to forget your labors of love amen so there was so much ground that we got into we talked about the gossiper the tail Bearer we talked about how Saul lost his position in Christ because he feared the people's faces and um and but in Psalms 105 as God was dealing with Israel he says when you were few men in number yay very few he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sakes and this is God speaking he says touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm now who are the anointed ones those are the Saints those are not just preachers those are not just leaders or brothers those are the Saint the anointed ones those are the brothers and the sisters and so there's a respect that we have to that God Demands a respect for his children and we should have the utmost respect for one another amen and in doing that it really shows our love when we really love someone we'll try to cover them we won't try to expose them when you love someone you won't don't gossip about them you'll try to bring it in you bring them to that place that they need to be now uh the scripture is very clear and that was the fall for Saul was that he got bigger in his own sight and when when we lose vision of really our littleness then it um it allow for what 1 Corinthians 4 says here verses 5-7 if we could turn there quickly it says this here therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord comes who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the heart and then shall every man have Praise of God and these things Brethren I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou this not receive now if thou did receive it why does thou Glory as if thou had not received it so your pretty stature or your beautiful voice or your ability to speak or preach or lead or follow whatever special touch the Lord wired you and gave you and you know it's a gift that comes from the lord it's attractive it's likable it's lovable it's a gift from God then why would I want to boast a that when I didn't give myself anything if I have anything worth of any praise or boasting it'll be from Christ and so God gives me a gift and gives you a gift and then we start fighting one another over that gift that's not the god that we serve that's not why he gave you the gift he gave you the gift so you can now use that to serve his people and then you can bless his people with his gift that he gave you and when we make it about ourselves then we get edgy we puff against one another we Flex against one we compare we be become carnal and we start drawing these lines and it's just not pleasing to the lord it's disrespectful to the one that called you and you're supposed to be serving we are ministers to the public ministers to the people wife is a minister to her to she's to minister the needs to her husband husband to to the wife and the children and so forth and so this little message in such a disrespectful age is well worthy to shout from the Housetop respect one another with the utmost respect be little in your own eyes and look at your brother or sister just lift them up much higher so that you're not puffed up against one another but the scriptures are clear in this uh likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel one of the translations takes that word honor and says treat them with respect as the weaker partner or the weaker vessel that word means the same giving honor giving respect un as the weaker vessel now look what brother random says in Jehovah Gyra he's talking about Abraham and Sarah and he says this here paragraph 28 I can imagine it was on a Sunday afternoon when he spoke to him maybe on Monday morning how he's going to do poor little Isaac he looks at him oh he loves him but I can't look at that I got to think of obeying God so he's talking about the Lord told Abraham to take his slay his only son and this is he told told him that Sunday this is on the Monday that he's got to carry it out so he couldn't tell Sarah cuz you know the ladies are the weaker vessel so you sometimes you have to watch so I can't tell Sarah cuz she wouldn't understand now um Sarah let me finish the quote Sarah never was too strong anyhow in the faith cuz she lacked she disbelieved the promise but Abraham help her because the man and woman are one the woman could not be saved in the Old Testament only by the man because it was circumcision and she had to be joined to her husband in order to receive it but in the last days God poured out his Spirit and the women are circumcised in the heart just like the man and that was in 1956 he says it again very similar like this in the message I'll Skip One says questions and answers in 1960 no identification 1964 the prophet of God says this here paragraph 152 and you know God said now to make the people in days to come the Seed of Abraham know your seed know that I keep my promise to any man that will hold unto my word I'm going to give him a test when the little boy got about 14 years old I imagine little shaggy hair pretty little eyes oh how that happy father and mother you know how you parent are with your child only child then God said to Abraham now he wouldn't tell it to Sarah because Sarah was the weaker vessel and so he said Abraham I want you to take this little boy that I give you the one that I'm going to make you a father of many nations by and I want you to take him up on the mountain that I'm going to show you tonight in a vision and there kill him so here brother banam uh is taking this one quote the last quote he says that God couldn't tell Sarah because she was a weaker vessel and there's just certain things we can't just dump on everybody their ears are not equipped to hear it um even young people you just can't unload those things on them you got to know with with Revelation with knowledge know what is valuable and what can be helpful um you know you can't tell the whole story and I know some of you sisters are going to look sideways but this is I'm reading the quotations the Bible said you are a weaker the weaker vessel God made you that way for a purpose and I expect some sisters to say Amen but if you don't say Amen it's yours you can keep it that's fine the word already has a big old Amen on it anyways and so that's the reality of it in this age and hour and look at the little babies giving me an amen thank you little will yes but you know this that that's a reality and it's not just weaker like I can lift more muscle I got bigger muscles than you there's the the the from the Garden of Eden all the way through and all the way down there's a reason why she's not to handle the word and preach the gospel the scriptures brings us that order now brother brandham goes further in this on the weaker vessel and I just want to bring that to you as he brought it to us Amen in the message the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel he says this here but I got a tremendous quotes for you sisters that's coming up here too so if you going to be quiet now just stay quiet cuz I was going to lean right with you but ain't no favorite part we say Amen to we say Amen to all of it right praise the Lord somebody all right paragraph 129 the prophet of God no paragraph 67 he says this here 1961 he says you women I've hollered at you now I'm going to take up for you a minute the woman is the weaker vessel I know there can't be a bad man before there's a bad woman but men who knows that men who knows that you are a son of God and take advantage of a woman shame on you no matter what she does she's a weaker vessel and you know that if she goes out acting unladylike take her by the hand talk to her like a sister you're a Son of God don't don't do them evil things look at Joseph he was an example to you amen questions and answers 1961 the prophet of God says this now what did I tell you a while ago when I first started when you see a car coming down the road 90 miles an hour get out of its way that's right when you see the first twist in anything like that get away from it stay away from it that's the ground you should not be on Satan will present something to you that'll wreck your soul and send you to Hell stay away from it shun the very appearance of evil that's right be a man be a woman I'm going to take up for the women a minute that's unusual isn't it they say oh the woman caused it oh it was the woman's fault she hadn't got out of her place well the man wouldn't have got out of his that's true well we'll say that's right she got out of her place a man can't be bad L there's a bad woman but remember there can't be a bad woman without being a bad man that's right and you who claim to be a Son of God where is your principles if the woman ain't out of her place aren't you a Son of God aren't you the one that's a higher stronger vessel as the Bible says she's weaker then if she's weaker then show yourself a man of God tell her say sister you're in the wrong that's right I've done it other Christians have done it you'll always do it as long as you're a Christian but show yourself you're a Son of God you have more power over yourself than the woman does if she is weaker recognize her to be weaker understand her mistakes and things like that or try or try to correct her say sister we are Christians we shouldn't do that see be a real man be a Son of God and watch the woman amen choosing of the Bride the prophet of God is a very strong message very similar to um marriage and divorce he's bringing out the choice that a man in choosing a bride and types it with Christ choosing a church choosing uh an elect lady and as we shared on Sunday that you know we're all married to Christ and we're married to Christ the word and that is our husband that's our headship and so brother random brings those types the scripture brings those types and when I really respect the word proper ly then I will respect everybody else properly if I can't respect the word properly that's probably why I'm not respecting you the way I should because my approach to the word isn't correct I can say I can quote the quotes I can quote the scriptures but if I'm not treating you according to the what the scripture tells us then I really don't believe it Jesus said um if you love me you will do what you will keep my Commandments and I gave the the brother bam gives a beautiful example in the message respects when AA Allen spoke against him publicly over something that he heard the proper thing was he should have came to brother Brom and talk to him now that's what the Bible says that's what the scripture says that's you know your feelings will make you do one thing but really Christ the word is our leadership is our headship amen and above what everybody else thinks how they feel how they treat you who started it first who's being acting the way they're acting you have a responsibility to the word brothers and sisters that is our example even whoever did whatever wrong to you you still have an example you have a responsibility to hold to what the word says bring that on the table and then you say well this is what the word says Lord help me I don't feel like this I don't feel I feel like this is you know I'm being done wrong I'm being done unjust I really want to L lash out against them I want to go do something but if the word doesn't give you that permission to do that you want to humble yourself to the word you submit yourself every believer has to do it it's not just the wives have to submit to their husband oh this unfair that's not right it's unfair a man has to submit to the word of God and you tell me that's an easy task a single man that's not easy I mean to bring this carnal uh I mean I applaud the saints that come to church that's here on a Wednesday night I mean all of the attractions of the world out there you've worked and you've done you could be out kicking back cable has so many television shows plus Netflix plus all the other shows you could be at home relaxing and doing what most most people are doing I applaud a man or a woman single Man Group family that will get themselves together and come to the house of the Lord it might look easy I'm looking at you it looks easy but I know it ain't easy and some days I want to check out like some of y'all do but I can't praise the Lord and when we all get when we all get handcuffed to the work like I'm handcuffed to it there'll be no days off praise the Lord God bless you yes yes it's it's not easy for anybody it's like oh I'm so glad that I could have the rule over my no you are responsible now you're responsible so now the word of God the prophet of God takes choosing of the bride and he says this here paragraph 14 4 and the woman was the one that changed over for the perversion that's right see where the beauty takes her to now that's why that today we find that women is on the increase of beauty you take Pearl Brian did you ever see her picture supposed to be America's great Beauty there isn't a school kid out of any school but what would have her in the back row did you know it's supposed to be that way did you know the Bible speaks that that's the way it's going to be there is no other message like our message Saints do you know the fall came by women at the beginning and the end is going to wind up the same way women coming into Authority and ruling over men and so forth you know the scripture says that you know the day that she puts on man's clothes and Bobs her hair and all those things are contrary to God's word you know she represents the church wow when you watch what women are doing you'll see what the church is doing that's exactly right now now that's just as true as the word of God is true no other female is made that can stoop like a woman can and yet through that being made she was not in the original creation all other females is in the original creation Birds male and female animals male and female but in human life God only made a man and he took from him and a woman is a byproduct of a man because God did not Institute such a thing search the scriptures exactly right God knows sir in his original creation she was put out there but if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than man that's right she's put on a testing ground through her come death she's guilty of all death but then God turned around and used one to bring life back again brought his son through the woman an obedient one but a bad one is the worst there is nothing can be so low so and of course brother bradam is bringing the natural and the spiritual type remember in the message thinking man's filter has brother bam talked about the subtle instrument that Satan used called the church to use to deceive The Souls of many and create all kind of taste and desires whatever flavor you want we'll give that to you whatever flavor you want but a thinking man he can only preach the word a true church can only preach the word and that's what a thinking man wants doesn't want an Easy Street sermon doesn't want a sermon that doesn't touch me nobody called me out no no not a True Believer a True Believer wants to be right with God amen amen if God's word says it then that's what I want to size my life up to I want to pattern my life behind that behind all cost remember Saints we're going somewhere we got to leave from here and why would we play games with the few meager decades that we have here on on the earth we'll be leaving here soon amen and um what's more important than standing before him on that day you want to be prepared for that don't you so here what the prophet of God says here um speaking of this this weaker vessel or this this the woman and her role and position as it pertains to the man in the message life story um I forget the paragraph number I think I gave it to you the prophet of God says this here but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and they're lovely and I've got thousands of Christian sisters who I highly respect but if they can respect what what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she is a Good Wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown but an orary one is no good one or or no good one is water in his blood and that's right it's the worst thing could happen so a good woman if you got a good wife brother you ought to respect her with the highest that's right you should do that a real woman and children if if you got a real mother that stays home and tries to take care of you keeping your clothes clean send you to school teaching you about Jesus you should honor that sweet old mother with all that's in you you should respect that woman because she's a real mother and the message the token the prophet of God says this you should love one another Believers should separate themselves from the world don't just take it now lightly then you people that's listening to this on tape you women you men you listen a minute if you ever believe me you believe it now it's time you quit fussing with one another believe the message of the Bible believe Jesus Christ and love and honor and respect one another men respect your wives you respect your home bring your home together because remember this lamb was for the home not just one the whole home too had to be brought everything had to be brought in we should love each others and Believers should separate themselves from the world now how many love that and how many believe that is true amen perfectly the way I would treat the things that happened to me look at myself as you know not above what God called me look at myself as just a nobody I don't deserve anything I don't I don't deserve everyone's respect right it'd be great if we get it but really I respect the word above that and so the Bible says look let no man suffer as an evildoer or worker of iniquity it says here in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 5 I want to take this scripture for you here and I'll share what the prophet of God says about this all right Ephesians chapter 6 servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh with fear and tribling and singleness of your heart as to who as unto not your boss not the master not the guy who's in charge not the fleshly but as unto Christ not with I Service as men Pleasers but as the Servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart with Good Will doing service with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to man knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether he be Bond or free and you Masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is their respective persons with him amen there one more scripture let me take that for you it's in the New Testament there find it here respect a great subject wouldn't you say oh we can all learn to respect the word even more and respect him more so so Ephesians chapter 5 so let's let me read that so brother brandham deals with it here in questions no not questions and answers yeah Revelations CH 4 part 3 paragraph 160 now turn with me right quick with ephes to Ephesians 5 just hold your place go back a few pages back to Ephesians the 5th chapter the 26th verse that he might sanctify and cleanseth the church he's speaking of see now let me go back a little further go back to the 21st verse you're looking submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor submit yourself to your congregation if a little click Rises up don't be on either side submit yourself to the whole congregation congregation if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God see oh brother H wives submit eles unto your own husband is that on the screen it's like I'm in this room by myself wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord y'all help me read that I can't say that I notices all the brothers said that they made sure they got that one out there because he is your lord can we play that one out really loud no no don't it say in there there it is now she can hold her position right okay she has a greater reward than the man and if the man has a wife that's out of line what did he say do he said no matter what she does you know she's the weaker vessel you bring the correction this is what this is our responsibility to the word We Don't Fight Fire with Fire don't get even with people you upset so I'm going to get upset back at you that's not how that's not the word that's not the headship that we're following it's so much bigger than your wife or your husband it's our Lord as unto the Lord and when my praise and my sermons and my giving and everything is as unto the Lord then I will do it properly sir you don't have to Pat me on the back or appreciate it or be looking for you know acknowledgement I gave that to the Lord Lord he saw it and thank you Lord for giving me the opportunity to even give you praise you know we're supposed to be praising the Lord and then we get upset when the people don't praise us something is Twisted there it's off it's not right it's incorrect serving looking I Service as men pleas I'm going to please this brother this one oh he's not that important so I won't please him he's not you know he don't have no power but brother oh yeah I'll serve brother over here cuz he's got the power to you know change my you know so Lord help us so he is your lord how many knows that you women that's exactly right thank you sis the Bible said so at the beginning it's still the same way wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so is the husband you all know that you married people an adult or children that's old enough to know the way of life all right as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to do their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it don't run over her if you do that you're not fit to be a husband that's right that he might listen here here it is get it now that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word then every worshipper that ever gains access into this has to come by the word there's too many comes otherwise I believe in little stories and things about mother died long years ago she's waiting for you in heaven that does all right after the the word has been applied many people come to the altar cuz they want to meet their mother in heaven that's all right you should do that but that's not the reason you come to the altar you come to the altar confessing your sins because Christ died in your stead by the word so the word is our headship it's our leadership I if I'm if I'm in the word properly you will love me yeah because that's the best version you gonna get from me that's the best version you're going to get from me is if brother Israel can come under the headship of the word and that's the same for the young people for wives or whoever so you pray for me I pray for you that we'll all find the headship of the word and the word makes us what he wants us to be amen God bless you God bless each of you richly trust the Lord will bless you as we
