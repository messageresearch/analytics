[2:05] Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh
[2:08] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[2:11] thou H has hid these things from the
[2:13] wise and prudent and has revealed them
[2:16] unto babes even so father for it seemed

[3:10] Ral are you
[3:12] ready ready I want shock you a little
[3:15] bit Hallelujah the Rapture will be the
[3:18] same way
[3:20] yes it'll be so simple no doubt to be
[3:24] likewise till the Rapture will come one
[3:26] of these days and nobody will know
[3:28] nothing about it
[3:31] now don't don't don't get up now but
[3:32] study just a minute I'm sure enough
[3:37] clothing the Rapture will come in such a
[3:39] simple way till the judgments will fall
[3:42] and they'll see the son of man and they
[3:44] say wasn't we supposed to have such and
[3:47] such and wasn't there supposed to be a
[3:49] lie sent to us and wasn't there supposed
[3:51] to be a Rapture Jesus will say it's
[3:53] already happened and you didn't know
[3:58] it
[4:02] God in
[4:06] Simplicity now this week we're go get
[4:08] some offer he
[4:09] teaching I
[4:12] notice the Rapture will be so few go in
[4:16] that
[4:17] bright it'll not be now see how the
[4:19] teachers has got it they got charts and
[4:21] they go show 10 million people coming up
[4:23] here all the methodists if it's a
[4:25] Methodist preacher if it's a Pentecostal
[4:26] all the Pentecostals coming it will
[4:29] never touch
[4:31] there'll be maybe one leave
[4:33] Jeffersonville just somebody come up
[4:35] missing they say well you never the rest
[4:37] of there'll be one leave
[4:42] Georgia there'll be one leave in Africa
[4:45] and let's say there' be 500 people a
[4:48] living will go in the translation now
[4:50] that ain't that ain't the church body
[4:51] this is a bride that ain't the church
[4:53] this is the
[4:55] bride the church will come up with the
[4:57] thousands but that's in the next
[4:58] Resurrection they live not for the space
[5:00] of a th years see but in the bride if
[5:03] 500 people left the Earth this very
[5:07] minute the world would know nothing
[5:09] about
[5:10] it Jesus said there be one in a bed now
[5:13] take one leave one that's at night time
[5:16] there' be two in a field over on the
[5:19] other side of the earth I'll take one
[5:20] and leave one and as it was in the days
[5:23] of Noah so shall it be in the coming of
[5:25] the son of
[5:27] man than
[5:30] everything will move just as common as
[5:31] it can be a fanatic message you'll go by
[5:34] and the first thing you know something
[5:35] this Minister going somewhere he can
[5:36] never come back he probably went to
[5:37] Woods hunting he has never returned no
[5:39] more and this fell went somewhere you
[5:41] know what happened I believe that young
[5:42] girl she she must have been CAU away
[5:45] somewhere you know somebody take that
[5:46] girl out in rer probably told her Riv
[5:48] she me nobody half of 99 out of every uh
[5:52] may say one out of every 100 million
[5:54] they ever know anything about it if
[5:56] somebody it's acquainted with say the
[5:57] girl's missing while I can't understand
[5:59] she never did leave like that no and
[6:01] when they say the the graves will open
[6:03] how's the graves going to open when I I
[6:07] haven't got time to get into this what I
[6:08] wanted to I'm going to have to take it
[6:10] just to show you the Simplicity of God
[6:13] and that calcium potach and everything
[6:15] when when everything that's in you of
[6:18] materials only makes a spoonful amen
[6:20] that's right and what that does it
[6:22] breaks on back into spirit and life God
[6:25] just speaks the Rapture come it ain't
[6:27] going out there and the angels come down
[6:28] and shove up the grav get out of an old
[6:30] dead carcass you what it is is born of
[6:31] sin to begin with but a new one made in
[6:34] its lik know we have this will die again
[6:39] see nobody say the graves will open the
[6:41] dead shall walk out that may be true but
[6:44] not open the way you say that's right
[6:47] see it won't be like that it'll be a
[6:49] secret because he said he come like a
[6:51] thief in the night he's already told us
[6:53] this the Rapture then judgments will
[6:56] strike sin plague sickness and
[6:59] everything and people cry for death to
[7:02] take them when the Judgment Lord why is
[7:04] this judgment up on us when you said
[7:06] there be a Rapture first you say it's
[7:08] already com and you didn't know
[7:12] it God hiding himself in Simplicity oh
[7:18] my all
[7:20] right all it's already happening you do
[7:22] it why don't Believers believe the
[7:26] simple signs of his coming they're
[7:29] expecting the all this things that spoke
[7:32] up of the scripture and the moon's going
[7:34] to go down in the middle of sun in the
[7:35] middle of the day and there's going to
[7:36] be all kinds of things oh if we just had
[7:40] I got the notes WR here on it to show
[7:42] what them things are and we'll get it on
[7:44] the breaking of these seals this week
[7:46] anyhow see see there it is just where
[7:48] it's already passed and you didn't
[7:51] know see if it is if the angel of the
[7:54] Lord will break them seals forth to it
[7:56] remember seal with them seven mysterious
[7:58] Thunders
[8:00] now what why can't people believe the
[8:03] simple Simplicity of a humble bunch of
[8:07] people see and the the voice of the
[8:11] signs of God why can't they believe it
[8:15] just like it always been the true word
[8:17] of God being made manifest it's they're
[8:21] too smart and too educated to believe
[8:23] the simple form of the written word they
[8:28] want to put their own interpretation to
[8:30] it it don't mean this it don't mean that
[8:31] see it does mean that listen may I say
[8:34] this right quick now even the visions
[8:37] that God gives here at the
[8:40] place it's so
[8:42] misunderstood that's you hear me on the
[8:44] tape say say what the tape say say what
[8:47] the vision say now if you're Wide Awake
[8:49] you'll see
[8:51] something I hope I don't have to hold up
[8:53] my hand and show you see see see you're
[8:56] it's it's
[8:58] here
[9:00] amen We Believe yes sir smart
[9:02] educationals miss it the simple Visions
[9:06] when they revealed in such Simplicity
[9:09] till it just cover little top of
[9:11] people's head Hallelujah the calls of
[9:13] seen the vision told you all about going
[9:15] up there hunting and you know I just
[9:16] stumble people and there God sent it up
[9:19] there for the very purpose to come back
[9:20] and interpret it right around short of
[9:22] the going of my mother and things like
[9:23] that and it come back and told it
[9:25] beforehand and it happened just exactly
[9:28] the way he said it would do
[9:29] see and yet John came right out there
[9:32] and confessed he said I'm not no Messiah
[9:35] but I'm the voice of one crying in the
[9:37] wilderness and then that very disciples
[9:39] say why there's a scribe saying the the
[9:42] scripture teach that Elias was first com
[9:47] the Simplicity of God goes just Roots
[9:49] right over the top of people's head let
[9:51] me take this man close I will for the
[9:54] help of God he look now let's break this
[9:57] down then I I'm sorry to keep keep
[9:59] telling
[10:00] you look sorry to hold you but just a
[10:03] few hours we come back look let's take a
[10:07] simple drop of
[10:09] ink everything is for a purpose you've
[10:13] gathered here this morning for a purpose
[10:15] I eat at your house Charlie Nelly you
[10:18] cooked for me for a
[10:22] purpose everything's for a purpose this
[10:25] church is erected for a purpose there's
[10:27] nothing without a purpose and a call
[10:30] let's take the simple drop of ink now
[10:32] can you hear me let's take a simple drop
[10:35] of ink and look at it what is it a drop
[10:37] of ink where did he come
[10:40] from all right let's take this drop of
[10:42] ink now it's it say it's black ink now
[10:45] that ink is for a purpose it can write
[10:48] my pardon in a out of a Penitentiary it
[10:52] can write my pardon from a death cell
[10:54] that right he can write John 3:16 and
[10:57] Save My Soul by believe leaving is that
[10:59] right amen or it can sign my death
[11:02] warrant amen see it can condemn me at
[11:05] the Judgment bar it's far a purpose is
[11:08] that right let's look at that little ink
[11:10] and see where it come from now it's ink
[11:13] it's been put together chemicals and so
[11:15] forth just become ink and it's black you
[11:18] drop it on your clothes it'll stain it
[11:20] but we have manufactured a stuff called
[11:23] bleach you women use Clorox bleach well
[11:26] I take that one drop of ink and drop it
[11:28] into a tub of of
[11:30] bleach now what happened to the ink see
[11:35] why uh bleach has been manufactured
[11:38] invented and manufactured chemicals
[11:41] together that'll break up that color in
[11:42] soat so you can't find it now part of
[11:46] the bleach is water water is H2O which
[11:49] is hydrogen and oxygen and both hydrogen
[11:52] and oxygen both are dangerous explosives
[11:55] and then hydrogen and oxygen is actually
[11:58] ashes
[11:59] it's what it is that's right chemical
[12:02] ashes it's chemical ashes now now put it
[12:05] together you got
[12:06] water but break it you got hydrogen and
[12:10] oxygen just keep on going back now in
[12:12] getting in this let's take I cannot now
[12:15] there might be chemist sitting here and
[12:16] I I want to say it because there will be
[12:18] chemist listening at it I don't know the
[12:20] farmer but I want to just explain it in
[12:23] my own humble way trusting that God will
[12:26] reveal himself in it look I drop that
[12:29] drop of ink into a uh a bleach what
[12:34] happens immediately the black Steen is
[12:38] gone you couldn't find it again if you
[12:40] had to it's gone you'll never see it no
[12:43] more what happen now you don't see
[12:47] nothing come up from it you don't why
[12:49] don't you because it's broke up now
[12:52] science would say it turned back to its
[12:55] original
[12:56] acids what do the acids come from
[12:59] from see well you say it come from uh
[13:04] from uh certain things all right say for
[13:07] instance like fumes made acids where did
[13:10] fumes come from well it was uh we'll say
[13:14] fumes was made by um
[13:18] molecules where did molecules come from
[13:21] from
[13:22] atoms where did atoms come
[13:25] from Electronics where did they come
[13:28] from cosmic light see you're come back a
[13:32] past finding of chemist
[13:34] now and if it is a substance and a
[13:39] creation it has to come from a
[13:43] cre so you're not sitting here by chance
[13:46] that's right I'm not holding till 12:30
[13:49] or 1:00 by
[13:51] Chance the foot steps of the righteous
[13:53] is order of the
[13:57] Lord see there's some reason for it
[14:01] there's some reason for you to believe
[14:04] there's some reason for you not to
[14:05] believe it's like there that ink now
[14:08] let's break that down now the first
[14:10] thing say as we get back to we bring it
[14:12] back as far as molecules now we took
[14:15] molecule I'd say number one time
[14:18] molecule 9 time molecule 12 now if it
[14:21] been 11 it would come out red but it it
[14:25] had to be 12 to make black then we'll
[14:27] take that down to Adam it was Adam and
[14:29] 96 * + 43 equal Adam uh 1611 if been
[14:37] 1612 it might have been purple see then
[14:40] you keep breaking it on down it shows
[14:43] that there was a something back on her
[14:46] to begin
[14:47] with now that's only common
[14:49] sense it's a creation has to have a
[14:52] Creator amen and it went out from a
[14:57] Creator and and then it it was
[14:59] determined and put into these different
[15:02] now science cannot take uh Adam B 16 *
[15:05] 12 * 14 * whatever like that to make
[15:07] that God had to do that and then it's
[15:10] brought down to a place to where it's
[15:12] got down into atoms then science can
[15:14] begin to touch it then it comes out into
[15:16] molecules then it can begin to see a
[15:17] little better then it comes out from
[15:18] that into something else and first thing
[15:20] it comes into chemicals and then they
[15:22] blend these together now when man before
[15:26] he sinned I'm closing
[15:29] but don't you miss
[15:31] it when man sinned he separated himself
[15:35] from God and crossed the great Chasm and
[15:38] put himself in death on this side he
[15:41] left his no way back
[15:44] exactly there's no way for him to get
[15:48] back but then when he did God accepted a
[15:52] substitute which was a lamb or a goat or
[15:54] sheep or something for blood which Adam
[15:57] spoke of or
[15:59] Abel spoke up on the other side of the
[16:02] chasm on that side he's a Son of God
[16:07] he's an offspring from God he's an
[16:10] inheritance of the earth he can control
[16:13] nature he can speak into
[16:16] existence why he's a Creator himself
[16:20] he's an offspring of God but when he
[16:23] crossed he separated his
[16:26] sunship he's a sinner by
[16:29] he's under the hands and Dominion of
[16:31] Satan and God took a sacrifice a
[16:35] chemical of the blood but the blood of
[16:38] bulls and goats did not divorce sin it
[16:41] only covered sin if I got a red spot on
[16:44] my hand and cover it with white the red
[16:46] spot's still there see it's still there
[16:51] but God sent down from heaven a bleach
[16:55] for
[16:56] sin it was a of his own
[16:59] son that when our confessed sin drops
[17:04] into God's
[17:06] bleach try to find it again the color of
[17:10] sin goes back through the mediators and
[17:14] down through the time until it hits the
[17:17] accuser Satan and lays on him till the
[17:19] day of the Judgment hallelujah what
[17:22] happens to the son he becomes in perfect
[17:25] fellowship with the father again
[17:27] standing on his other side of the CM
[17:29] with no remembrance of sin against it no
[17:32] more there's no more stain of bleach can
[17:35] be seen
[17:37] anywhere he's
[17:39] free
[17:41] Hallelujah just as that Clorox the E can
[17:45] never be ink no more because it's broke
[17:47] up and sent back
[17:49] again and when confess sin is confessed
[17:54] and been dipped into the a man or a
[17:57] woman that's been dipped into the blood
[17:59] of Jesus Christ it kills all
[18:02] symptoms every molecule of sin goes back
[18:06] to the dev and L
[18:07] on or his eternal destination will be
[18:10] thrown into a lake
[18:13] of is bridged and never to come in
[18:16] remembrance no more Hallelujah and a man
[18:19] name Justified as the Son of
[18:23] God
[18:26] Simplicity Moses are the blood of bulls
[18:30] and
[18:31] goats with his confession in the word of
[18:34] God and God could take that simple man
[18:39] and put his words in his
[18:41] mouth and he proved that he was Jehovah
[18:44] servant for he could walk out there and
[18:46] Jehovah spoke to him by Vision he walked
[18:49] out stretched his hands towards the east
[18:51] and now remember God has spoke to him
[18:53] it's God's thought God uses man amen God
[18:57] spoke to him it's right right he said go
[19:00] stretch that rod in your hand towards
[19:02] the east and say
[19:05] flies Moses under the blood of that goat
[19:09] sheep walked out there and took that
[19:11] stick reached towards the east thus
[19:14] sayth the Lord let there be
[19:18] flies never heard a fly walked on back
[19:21] it's already
[19:22] spoke it's a thought now it's spoke it's
[19:25] expressed amen it's a word of God then
[19:28] it come into a human's lips a simple man
[19:32] under the blood of a bull or
[19:35] goat first thing you old green fly begin
[19:37] to fly
[19:38] around next thing you know they were 5
[19:41] lbs per yard hallelujah what was it was
[19:45] the word of God spoken through Moses the
[19:49] Creator because under the blood he was
[19:51] standing in the presence of
[19:54] God and his own words wasn't his word he
[19:58] abide me and my words abide in you then
[20:00] ask what you will just giving you
[20:03] where's the church standing at Let There
[20:05] Be frogs and it was a frog in a country
[20:08] now our's time they were 10t deep in
[20:10] places what was it it was God the
[20:14] Creator hiding himself in a simple
[20:18] man I want to ask you something if the
[20:21] blood of a bull or a goat be used for a
[20:24] bleach which can only
[20:26] cover could put a man in position to
[20:29] speak the creative word of God and bring
[20:32] flies into his existence why would you
[20:35] stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ
[20:37] blood who could speak a squirrel or
[20:38] something
[20:40] in do don't stumble over
[20:43] Simplicity believe that he still remains
[20:47] God oh my pardon of
[20:52] sin oh how I wish I could then Mark
[20:55] 11:22 you say to this mountain be moved
[20:58] and don't doubt in your heart but
[20:59] believe that what you said will come to
[21:03] pass you can have what you said I've got
[21:06] three or four pages we just got to leave
[21:07] it go thank
[21:10] you God hiding himself in
[21:16] Simplicity don't you see there's
[21:19] something wrong
[21:20] somewhere there's something wrong
[21:23] somewhere when God makes a statement he
[21:26] cannot lie
[21:29] he made the promise
[21:31] see he hides in
[21:34] Simplicity it's so simple they educated
[21:38] The Scholar oh it's oh it's telepathy or
[21:41] something you know it's a God can sweep
[21:44] himself back down through the streams of
[21:46] time and tell you back under just
[21:47] exactly what
[21:49] happened tell you just exactly what you
[21:51] are today and what you will be to
[21:54] come that's still by the bleach of Jesus
[21:58] Christ who can take a sinner and bleach
[22:01] him into there and he stands in the
[22:02] presence of God and if you abide me in
[22:05] my words and you can ask what you will
[22:08] he that does Believe on me the works
[22:10] that I do shall he do also how you
[22:13] condemn me oh did not your own law say
[22:16] that those who the word of God came to
[22:18] the prophets did not you call them gods
[22:20] and then how can you condemn me when I
[22:22] say I am the Son of
[22:24] God they fail to see it they fail to see
[22:28] it now Church in the coming messages
[22:30] from tonight on don't fail to see it see
[22:34] the day that we're living and remember
[22:37] the blood of Jesus Christ takes sin so
[22:40] far from you and there's not even in the
[22:43] remembrance of God
[22:46] anymore it takes all
[22:50] stain sin had left the Crimson sting he
[22:54] washed it white as
[22:56] snow then before the throne I stand in
[22:59] him complete oh my how can I be complete
[23:03] how can I be complete because the blood

[1:09:25] again this morning for a class
[1:09:34] reading those uh prayer requests that go
[1:09:37] up let's really remember those we'll try
[1:09:39] to you know some the Saints put requests
[1:09:42] in and they're really serious things and
[1:09:45] I know we're very busy and I know it's
[1:09:48] not on purpose you know we don't do it
[1:09:50] purposefully but you know someone was to
[1:09:53] call me and tell me that they were
[1:09:54] really going through something then I
[1:09:56] would try to take the time to uh hear
[1:09:59] you and and spend time in prayer and you
[1:10:02] know sometimes the prayer requests
[1:10:03] things get lost in that we see a big
[1:10:06] group of names but let's take those to
[1:10:08] Heart amen we see those that have needs
[1:10:11] those that are afflicted and those that
[1:10:14] need uh something from the Lord we'll
[1:10:18] want to attend to that Psalms
[1:10:22] 23
[1:10:28] the Lord I'd like to read all of us to
[1:10:30] read this together how about that amen
[1:10:33] all together the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:10:36] shall not want he maketh me to lie down

[1:10:44] the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he
[1:10:48] leadth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:10:52] for his name's sake
[1:10:54] yay though I walk through the valley of
[1:10:56] the Shadows of death I will fear no evil
[1:11:00] for thou art with me thy rod thy staff
[1:11:04] that comfort me thou preparest a table
[1:11:08] before me in the presence of my enemies

[1:11:30] declaration let's read that it's and
[1:11:32] Powerful declaration surely goodness and
[1:11:35] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:11:39] life and I will dwell in the house of
[1:11:42] the Lord forever praise the
[1:11:46] Lord you know really there's enough in
[1:11:48] that word right there where we can say
[1:11:51] amen and go home that's the truth
[1:11:54] there's it's all complete and it's just
[1:11:58] a few minutes of reading but it's not
[1:12:01] the amount you're reading but it's the
[1:12:03] content of what you're reading it's the
[1:12:06] the depth of it I'd like to take a
[1:12:08] scripture in St John chapter 21 for our
[1:12:11] text this morning very familiar it's the
[1:12:13] last chapter in
[1:12:16] John is
[1:12:19] writing he makes it clear that he wrote
[1:12:22] this these writings himself at the end
[1:12:27] there we all know the background of it
[1:12:29] our lord Jesus has
[1:12:33] um he's appeared himself he he has
[1:12:36] appeared to his
[1:12:38] disciples um I think it's 1 Corinthians
[1:12:41] 15 to a group of 500 to to the 12 to the
[1:12:47] apostles which is another group to James
[1:12:50] his brother and to Paul himself there
[1:12:53] were several people that saw and
[1:12:55] witnessed Jesus after his uh death
[1:12:58] burial and his resurrection they saw him
[1:13:00] and talked to him the women saw him and
[1:13:03] so after this he's talking with Peter of
[1:13:05] course we know the testimony Peter do
[1:13:08] you love me feed my sheep feed my
[1:13:11] Lambs then he goes on to tell Peter in
[1:13:14] verse 18 how he would leave and how when
[1:13:18] he was young he was this way but when he
[1:13:21] gets older there'll be someone to carry
[1:13:24] you and take you about and he tells him
[1:13:27] in verse 19 this spake he signifying by
[1:13:31] what death he should glorify God and
[1:13:34] when he has spoken this he saith unto
[1:13:37] him follow
[1:13:38] me then Peter turning about seeth the
[1:13:42] disciple whom Jesus loved following
[1:13:46] which also leaned on his breast at
[1:13:48] supper and said Lord which is he that
[1:13:51] betrayeth thee pet Peter see seeing him
[1:13:55] saith to Jesus Lord and what shall this
[1:13:59] man
[1:14:00] do Jesus sath unto him if I will that he
[1:14:04] T till I come what is that to thee
[1:14:09] follow thou me then went this saying
[1:14:15] abroad or rumor we say then went the
[1:14:18] saying abroad among the Brethren that
[1:14:21] the that disciple should not die yet
[1:14:24] Jesus said not unto him he shall not die
[1:14:27] but if I will that he T till I come what
[1:14:31] is that to thee that's the title of the
[1:14:34] message this morning what is that to
[1:14:36] thee let us pray father we ask your
[1:14:39] blessings on your word this morning
[1:14:41] bless each heart bless those that have
[1:14:43] gathered Lord bless me move away
[1:14:45] everything that I would say or think
[1:14:48] that's not right just move it aside the
[1:14:51] carnality and Lord may you be magnified
[1:14:55] and glorified May the message touch deep
[1:14:58] into the heart of your people today
[1:15:02] bless the Saints there in Phoenix
[1:15:04] Brother Art Brother
[1:15:06] Stevie those Saints holding um the word
[1:15:10] of life together just pray your
[1:15:12] blessings on them Father and each one
[1:15:16] that's gathered we pray in jesus' name
[1:15:20] amen God bless you you can make you may
[1:15:22] be seated
[1:15:24] what is that to thee follow thou me
[1:15:28] interesting how rumors get
[1:15:30] started um this is almost like Jesus
[1:15:35] started it he said it in a way he like
[1:15:38] he gave bait for a rumor to start he
[1:15:41] there's a lot of things he could have
[1:15:42] said he could have said well this man
[1:15:45] he's going to be in God's hands or this
[1:15:47] man he'll be healthy or this man he
[1:15:50] might start a church he could have said
[1:15:52] something that possibly possibly it was
[1:15:53] true but he he said Jesus says what if
[1:15:58] it if this man stays alive what if he
[1:16:00] never tastes death you know and and
[1:16:04] Peter asked Jesus this
[1:16:07] question after Jesus had told him what
[1:16:11] his end would be so the Lord tells Peter
[1:16:14] you know uh when you were young you went
[1:16:17] about uh when you were young you GED
[1:16:19] yourself you walk whether you wanted to
[1:16:21] go what you West but when thou shalt be
[1:16:24] old Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands
[1:16:27] and another shall GTH thee and carry
[1:16:29] thee with thou would go so the Lord is
[1:16:33] giving Peter his final
[1:16:36] instructions and it's something how he
[1:16:38] gets his instructions and then he looks
[1:16:40] over and sees John the disciple that
[1:16:43] Jesus loved John the one who actually
[1:16:46] asked Jesus the question hey Lord who's
[1:16:49] going to betray you sitting on his
[1:16:52] breast at the table T and God unveils
[1:16:55] that that the one that dips his bread in
[1:16:57] the soup or the the liquid there he's
[1:17:00] the one and so it was revealed that it
[1:17:02] was Judas this
[1:17:03] John uh what what's going on with him
[1:17:07] where's he going you told me about me
[1:17:09] but I want to know about him you know
[1:17:11] it's interesting how we want to know
[1:17:13] about we're more nosy than perhaps we
[1:17:15] realize and we want to get into other
[1:17:17] folks business don't we we don't want
[1:17:20] them to know we're nosy but we're nosy
[1:17:22] anyhow we want to if I could just be a
[1:17:24] fly on the wall you hear hear that
[1:17:26] statement what does that mean you want
[1:17:28] to be there you don't want people to
[1:17:30] know that you're there but you want to
[1:17:31] hear if I could just hear what's going
[1:17:33] on when they're riding home hear where
[1:17:35] they talk about when they're alone hear
[1:17:38] what the bosses are saying about me hear
[1:17:42] what the Saints are talking about me if
[1:17:45] I can just Lord what about him and Jesus
[1:17:48] simply says what is that to thee follow
[1:17:51] thou me me now there's a scripture that
[1:17:55] ID like you to turn to it's in the Old
[1:17:58] Testament and it is in the book of
[1:18:06] Deuteronomy if we'd be so kind to do
[1:18:08] that oh my I think I left yeah it's
[1:18:14] here I didn't hear no Bibles turning but
[1:18:17] maybe they're turning maybe they're
[1:18:18] swiping them over all
[1:18:20] right in Deuteronomy chapter 2
[1:18:28] how many Saints with me today let me see
[1:18:31] your hand openly okay so those that
[1:18:34] hav't raised your hand i'm watching you
[1:18:36] that you can come on board and help me
[1:18:38] out here this morning all right
[1:18:40] Deuteronomy chapter 2: 1 when we turned
[1:18:44] and took our journey in the wilderness
[1:18:47] by the way of the Red Sea as the Lord
[1:18:49] spake unto me and we Compass Mount seir
[1:18:52] many days days and the Lord spake unto
[1:18:54] me saying ye have compassed this
[1:18:57] mountain long enough turn you
[1:19:01] northward and command thou the people
[1:19:05] saying ye are to pass through the coast
[1:19:09] of your brethren the children of Esau
[1:19:12] which dwell in SE and they shall be
[1:19:15] afraid of you take you good heed unto
[1:19:18] yourselves therefore meddle not with
[1:19:22] them for I will not give you of their
[1:19:24] land no not so much as a foot breath
[1:19:28] because I have given Mount seir unto
[1:19:32] Esau for a possession you shall buy meat
[1:19:35] from them for money that you may eat you
[1:19:37] shall also buy water of them for money
[1:19:40] that you may drink for the Lord thy God
[1:19:42] hath blessed thee in all the works that
[1:19:46] of thy hand he knoweth thy walking
[1:19:49] through this Great Wilderness these 40
[1:19:52] Years of the Lord thy God has been with
[1:19:54] thee thou has lacked nothing and when we
[1:19:58] pass from our Brethren the children of
[1:20:01] Esau which dwelt in s through the way of
[1:20:04] the plain from elth and from eion gabber
[1:20:08] we turned and passed by the way of the
[1:20:10] Wilderness of Moab and the Lord said
[1:20:14] unto me distress not the
[1:20:17] moabites neither contend with them in
[1:20:20] battle for I will not give the of their
[1:20:23] land for possession because I have given
[1:20:26] AR unto the children of lot for a
[1:20:31] possession so who are these two groups
[1:20:33] of people the moabites and Esau now Moab
[1:20:39] is the grandson of lot if you remember
[1:20:43] and Esau is the brother to Jacob and
[1:20:47] here is Israel the children of Israel
[1:20:50] coming through their coast and their
[1:20:52] land and and going to the promised land
[1:20:55] that God had given to them they're on a
[1:20:58] journey now you know there's a scripture
[1:21:01] I believe it's in uh ezek uh uh um
[1:21:06] Exodus
[1:21:07] chapter we can find it here real quickly
[1:21:10] but Exodus uh 30 or 13 somewhere in
[1:21:13] there where the Lord
[1:21:16] actually leads Israel the harder way
[1:21:21] purposefully and and he he has them not
[1:21:25] go through the land of the Philistines
[1:21:27] because going through that land was it
[1:21:31] would have been uh easier but they might
[1:21:35] have fear because of the war and so
[1:21:38] forth Exodus 13: 17 and 18 there was two
[1:21:42] routes that could have gone and the Lord
[1:21:44] purposely takes them the harder route by
[1:21:48] the way of the sea the Red Sea and so we
[1:21:51] we realize that
[1:21:53] the path that the Lord is directing them
[1:21:56] he's leading them it's not a random path
[1:22:00] it might appear random and it's going
[1:22:03] longer than it should have but it's
[1:22:05] still being directed by God Amen and
[1:22:09] while going into the land he's telling
[1:22:12] them who to meddle with and who not to
[1:22:13] meddle with who to take and who not to
[1:22:16] take and these two brothers they're
[1:22:19] actually brothers of Israel Esau can say
[1:22:23] that's my twin brothers children those
[1:22:26] are my nieces and nephew that's Israel
[1:22:28] we you know we were we raised up we're
[1:22:30] the same blood we got the same
[1:22:33] Heritage Abraham we got the same blood
[1:22:36] flowing through us but our inheritance
[1:22:38] our paths are different but we're still
[1:22:42] brothers and Moab can say the same thing
[1:22:44] they can say that Moab was a grandson to
[1:22:49] lot and lot was Abraham's nephew not
[1:22:53] just a any kind of a nephew that uh
[1:22:56] someone that Abraham put his life on the
[1:22:58] line for someone that Abraham interceded
[1:23:01] for someone that Abraham loved and cared
[1:23:05] for amen if if lot was destroyed there
[1:23:10] would be no
[1:23:11] Moab so Moab is in existence because of
[1:23:16] Father Abraham but they're not in the
[1:23:18] same group as Israel but they're still
[1:23:22] our Brothers now this is an interesting
[1:23:25] relationship and we still have those
[1:23:27] relationships today and we have to be
[1:23:29] very
[1:23:30] careful very very careful on how we
[1:23:35] approach people and the way we think of
[1:23:38] people amen amen you know God has
[1:23:42] servants that are not really with Israel
[1:23:46] he has Kings and kingdoms that in the
[1:23:49] Bible he calls them their servant amen
[1:23:54] and one of these cases is in Genesis
[1:23:59] let's see if we can find it here quickly
[1:24:01] excuse me I didn't write it
[1:24:03] down but
[1:24:05] Genesis chapter 17 somewhere no no
[1:24:08] Genesis chapter 20 somewhere right in
[1:24:13] there somebody can help me find it there
[1:24:16] where the great king uh when Abraham
[1:24:20] said she is my sister somebody find that
[1:24:22] chapter for me and the King went in and
[1:24:25] took
[1:24:26] Sarah and Genesis 20 thank you
[1:24:31] brother I want you to hear this
[1:24:33] conversation it's very very interesting
[1:24:35] in Abraham verse one Journey from then
[1:24:38] towards a South
[1:24:41] Country verse three but God came to aimc
[1:24:44] in a Dream by night so what's taking
[1:24:46] place here let's just back it up so here
[1:24:49] is Abraham he's calling he's called out
[1:24:51] of ER to go into Canaan to possess the
[1:24:55] land that God is going to give him God
[1:24:58] is establishing a covenant with him that
[1:25:01] his Covenant will be it's a very weird
[1:25:03] Covenant the Covenant is that every one
[1:25:06] of your men The Eighth Day age will be
[1:25:09] circumcised I don't know of any other
[1:25:12] group of people have to do that I don't
[1:25:14] know of the spiritual significance I
[1:25:16] don't know why God chose that but that
[1:25:18] is the Covenant I'm making with you
[1:25:20] Abraham not only you but your servants
[1:25:23] and anybody that you purchase anything
[1:25:26] that belongs to you will be circumcised
[1:25:28] like this you're an old man uh your your
[1:25:32] son ishmail he's older they'll all be
[1:25:34] circumcised but from this day forward
[1:25:37] eight days your the boys will be
[1:25:41] circumcised it's a that's a difficult
[1:25:43] task it's it's
[1:25:45] work it's
[1:25:47] work I mean you got it's got to be clean
[1:25:50] tools it's Medical procedure it's you
[1:25:54] know it's the child is with the birth
[1:25:56] there's there's a you know it's not it's
[1:25:58] not an easy task it's not like picking a
[1:26:00] fruit off a tree or planting or you know
[1:26:03] cutting an animal this is your sons
[1:26:06] every one of them and every son that
[1:26:09] doesn't do it is cut off from me this is
[1:26:11] the Covenant that I'm establishing with
[1:26:14] you Abraham and so he has this Covenant
[1:26:17] he's moving on through the land of of
[1:26:20] IMC he has this agreement with did it in
[1:26:22] Egypt already we'll do it again now if
[1:26:26] they see you Sarah they'll kill
[1:26:29] me because they're heathens
[1:26:33] anyways and they don't know what we know
[1:26:37] they'll kill me and take you so this is
[1:26:40] what we'll do say that you're my
[1:26:42] sister and if we really break it down we
[1:26:45] really are brother and sister but you
[1:26:47] tell them
[1:26:48] that and that'll spare our life so here
[1:26:52] a aik's men find her they bring her to
[1:26:55] aik's home and aik is every intentions
[1:26:59] am Marian Sister
[1:27:03] Sarah but God came to aimik in a Dream
[1:27:06] by
[1:27:07] night and said to him
[1:27:09] behold Thou Art but a dead man for the
[1:27:13] woman which thou Hast taken for she is a
[1:27:17] man's wife look at aimc but aimc had not
[1:27:22] come near her and he said what he call
[1:27:25] him
[1:27:27] huh huh what the Bible say help me
[1:27:31] preach he said Lord I thought we only
[1:27:34] can say
[1:27:35] Lord I thought we can only want to give
[1:27:37] you that title I thought we're the only
[1:27:39] ones that has this relationship with you
[1:27:41] God knows more people than perhaps you
[1:27:45] realize and people have relationships
[1:27:49] and Covenants with God that perhaps we
[1:27:51] don't know about
[1:27:52] about it's not our business to
[1:27:56] know it's our business to walk where God
[1:27:59] called us to walk amen
[1:28:05] amen he says Lord will thou slay also a
[1:28:10] righteous
[1:28:11] Nation they ain't righteous he's talking
[1:28:15] to the Lord and said he said he not unto
[1:28:18] me she is my sister and she even she
[1:28:21] herself said he is my brother in the
[1:28:23] Integrity of my heart and innocency of
[1:28:27] my hands have I done this and God said
[1:28:30] unto him in a dream yes I know that thou
[1:28:35] did this in the Integrity of thy heart
[1:28:38] for I also withheld thee from sinning
[1:28:42] against me so King AMC I don't want you
[1:28:45] to sin against me this is why I'm giving
[1:28:49] you a dream amen amen the Lord
[1:28:53] you know we look at the grace on
[1:28:54] Abraham's side but look at the grace
[1:28:57] extended to this quote unquote Heathen
[1:29:00] King look like God cared for him look
[1:29:03] like God was interested in him that's
[1:29:06] right
[1:29:09] yes for I also withheld thee from
[1:29:12] sinning against me therefore suffered I
[1:29:14] Thee not to touch her now therefore
[1:29:16] restore the man his wife for he is a
[1:29:20] prophet and
[1:29:24] if thou restore her not thou shall
[1:29:27] surely die thou and all that are thine
[1:29:31] therefore ailec Rose early in the
[1:29:32] morning called all his servants and told
[1:29:35] these things in their ears the men were
[1:29:38] so afraid AMC called Abraham and said
[1:29:40] unto him what has thou done unto us what
[1:29:42] have I have I offended thee that thou
[1:29:45] has brought on Me In My Kingdom a great
[1:29:47] sin thou has done Deeds unto me that
[1:29:50] thou ought not to be done
[1:29:53] and the bibic said unto Abraham what
[1:29:55] sawest thou that thou has done this
[1:29:58] thing so the king is asking him a
[1:29:59] legitimate question why would you throw
[1:30:01] me under the busl why would you
[1:30:03] potentially why would you put me in a
[1:30:05] situ you lied to me you lied to me you
[1:30:10] told me that was your sister and in the
[1:30:12] Integrity of my heart I was going to
[1:30:14] marry her properly and look at Abraham's
[1:30:17] answer and Abraham said because I
[1:30:20] thought
[1:30:22] surely God don't speak to
[1:30:25] y'all surely the fear of God is not in
[1:30:28] this place and they will slay me for my
[1:30:32] wife say he he thought aik they didn't
[1:30:35] know
[1:30:36] God God don't speak to them they don't
[1:30:39] get conviction they don't get dreams
[1:30:42] God's not able to correct them you know
[1:30:45] you know everybody's in God's hands did
[1:30:48] you know that did you know your boss is
[1:30:51] in God's hand hands the neighborhood
[1:30:53] association is in God's hands anything
[1:30:57] connected to you is in God's hands and
[1:31:00] can't nobody do nothing to you unless
[1:31:02] God permits it or allows
[1:31:06] it amen am that's how big our God is
[1:31:13] amen and so he gives Abraham all this
[1:31:17] good stuff
[1:31:19] money animals and S on their way
[1:31:24] now um you'll see a relationship
[1:31:28] similar with the father-in-law of Moses
[1:31:31] god uses Jethro to instruct
[1:31:35] Moses and he was a priest he offered
[1:31:38] something to somebody and God honored it
[1:31:40] some kind of way now he didn't walk with
[1:31:43] Moses he didn't go the way that they
[1:31:45] went but he still was a servant of God
[1:31:49] and now here God is now and instructing
[1:31:52] Israel when you get to Esau and you get
[1:31:56] to Moab leave him alone don't argue with
[1:31:59] them don't fuss with them leave them
[1:32:02] alone they have their inheritance I've
[1:32:05] given it to them they have their
[1:32:07] inheritance I've given it to them and
[1:32:09] you have an
[1:32:11] inheritance
[1:32:12] also now oh
[1:32:16] my praise the
[1:32:19] Lord how many thank God for that
[1:32:23] you know we lose
[1:32:25] control of who's in and who's out
[1:32:29] now you know Believers like to know who
[1:32:33] is True Believers and who's not seem
[1:32:36] like we must know that we like to go
[1:32:39] around giving people the quote unquote
[1:32:41] word test to find out if they're really
[1:32:45] Believers or
[1:32:46] not but that's really not our test to
[1:32:49] give to find out if there are believer
[1:32:52] or not that's God's
[1:32:54] business now as it pertains to how I'm
[1:32:56] going to live and how I'm going to
[1:32:58] operate and what I'm going to do in my
[1:33:01] life I need to give everything the word
[1:33:03] test for my
[1:33:05] life and you know this uh scripture in
[1:33:09] St John
[1:33:11] 21 where Peter is asking the
[1:33:16] question and Jesus answered it the way
[1:33:18] he
[1:33:19] did there went a saying fourth that John
[1:33:25] is not going to taste
[1:33:26] death
[1:33:28] now I'm curious is if many of the
[1:33:34] doctrines that come forth if they're
[1:33:36] really some of the doctrines I can
[1:33:39] actually almost classify them as a
[1:33:40] saying or a rumor because it's founded
[1:33:43] upon some man's idea and they you know
[1:33:46] if this is that and that is this that
[1:33:49] must mean this
[1:33:52] and so uh in the um Church ages we
[1:33:55] realize that deeds will lead to Doctrine
[1:33:59] if you're doing something and it becomes
[1:34:01] important to you then we can make a
[1:34:03] Doctrine out of it you know no mustaches
[1:34:06] long sleeve shirts something like that
[1:34:09] you know the skirt's got to touch the
[1:34:11] ankle we can make a Doctrine out of it
[1:34:13] we'll we can bring it in the word and
[1:34:15] make it you know because it's a deed now
[1:34:19] that moves into Doctrine and so this
[1:34:22] saying started from a comment that Jesus
[1:34:25] made now one of the dangers with uh and
[1:34:30] the reason this happens many times I
[1:34:33] trust the Lord will bless you and help
[1:34:35] you this morning the reason this happens
[1:34:37] many times because there are places in
[1:34:40] the word and brother bam says it many
[1:34:42] times that the scripture and the Bible
[1:34:45] is written in between the lines so you
[1:34:49] have to read in between the line
[1:34:52] as a love letter it's a letter between
[1:34:56] God and you God and other individuals
[1:35:00] God in the church God in the world but
[1:35:02] it's really a love letter between you
[1:35:04] and God he he wrote the Bible to you
[1:35:08] personally and when you have that
[1:35:11] relationship then you go into it reading
[1:35:14] it not so you can find points to argue
[1:35:17] with people but it's a love affair
[1:35:19] you're reading it for you father this is
[1:35:22] your word thank you that's what that
[1:35:24] means oh Lord open that up to me I was
[1:35:27] curious about this and then you pray and
[1:35:30] you read and it's a love letter and
[1:35:32] that's where the supernatural comes down
[1:35:34] and blesses you amen the bad side to
[1:35:38] that or the other side to that is that
[1:35:40] this reading in between the line can be
[1:35:44] you know interpreted as Revelation amen
[1:35:47] and God's going to reveal something to
[1:35:49] you in between the line read in between
[1:35:52] the lines and and try to come up with
[1:35:54] something to make it fit our our
[1:35:58] understanding amen and we'll take the
[1:36:01] message now we begin to read in between
[1:36:03] the lines of the message and we'll come
[1:36:05] up with this conclusion and they start
[1:36:08] from somewhere they come from somewhere
[1:36:10] it's not just you know that you know
[1:36:12] Jesus said it he did say what if what if
[1:36:15] this man ter till I come he did say that
[1:36:19] that's valid rumor material did you hear
[1:36:23] what Jesus said about John what' he say
[1:36:27] say he's not going to taste death you
[1:36:30] know that the the old you know I whisper
[1:36:32] to Trevor he tells little brother he
[1:36:35] tells sis he tells brother you come back
[1:36:37] around it's a whole another story then
[1:36:40] it's a whole another message then it's
[1:36:43] second hand or third hand or fifth hand
[1:36:46] and then somebody always feels like you
[1:36:48] know what he didn't mean to say that
[1:36:50] what he meant to say was do and you add
[1:36:52] a little flavor add a little salt add a
[1:36:55] little pepper and it's a different
[1:36:58] recipe than what we started with amen
[1:37:01] and it happens it's it's human beings do
[1:37:04] it it's innocent it's it's not it's not
[1:37:07] abstract it it happens amongst people
[1:37:09] who handled the word there's some
[1:37:12] statements that are made that we how did
[1:37:14] I put that together what did he mean by
[1:37:16] that and then how do they you know then
[1:37:19] read in between the lines
[1:37:22] so let's take a few places where brother
[1:37:23] bam actually talks about reading in
[1:37:25] between the lines I'm going to take
[1:37:27] three places here and then we'll move on
[1:37:29] is that okay in the
[1:37:32] message an ins sign brother bam says
[1:37:35] paragraph six say there's a little
[1:37:37] between a line you have to read in the
[1:37:41] Bible do you believe that see it's a
[1:37:43] love letter wrote to the church there's
[1:37:47] no need of a seminary trying to teach it
[1:37:50] cuz it's not known
[1:37:51] by minds of the of the world of this
[1:37:54] world it's h I've hid it from the eyes
[1:37:57] of the wise and prudent and will reveal
[1:37:59] it to babe such as we learn it's truth
[1:38:02] that's the reason we got all these
[1:38:04] different forms and kinds of religions
[1:38:06] and churches it's all right let it go
[1:38:10] God's got he's the one that takes care
[1:38:13] of the books look
[1:38:15] notice how it was let me give you a
[1:38:18] little something between the line you
[1:38:20] know sometimes s we get overseas I'm
[1:38:23] very fond of my wife she writes me a
[1:38:26] letter and she says Dear Billy I'm
[1:38:28] sitting here tonight I'm thinking very
[1:38:29] much of you I'm so and so now that's
[1:38:32] what she's saying but I'm reading right
[1:38:34] between the lines I know it goes a
[1:38:37] little deeper than that uhhuh and if you
[1:38:41] got the Holy Spirit you're in love with
[1:38:43] Christ you can read between God's lines
[1:38:48] there's something in there amen can you
[1:38:51] say amen amen then Along come Jose
[1:38:54] paragraph 10 drop down he says then
[1:38:56] Along come Joseph he says now wait they
[1:38:58] put his bones in the coffin I I and my
[1:39:01] hand on an old Leaf coffin here not long
[1:39:04] ago there he was supposed to had his
[1:39:07] bone in he says when you get out here to
[1:39:10] my burying Burying my bones up there
[1:39:12] don't bury me down here I wonder why it
[1:39:15] isn't written in the Bible but there
[1:39:17] were prophets they could read between
[1:39:20] the lines
[1:39:21] amen who could prophets amen they knew
[1:39:26] that the first fruits of the
[1:39:27] Resurrection wasn't coming in Egypt it
[1:39:29] was coming in Palestine yes Amen brother
[1:39:33] bam continues in the message demonology
[1:39:35] and says this I'm not going to stay on
[1:39:36] here long he says this here paragraph
[1:39:40] 32 here he stands on the earth the most
[1:39:43] you have to read between the lines to
[1:39:46] get the Bible a lot of times so here
[1:39:50] brother Bram is in encouraging us there
[1:39:52] it is let's get that here he stands here
[1:39:55] the most you have to read between the
[1:39:58] lines to get the Bible a lot of times so
[1:40:01] here's brother brandham is encouraging
[1:40:03] us that in order to read the Bible you
[1:40:05] need to be able to read between the
[1:40:07] lines but what is it founded upon it's
[1:40:10] founded upon a love affair so we're not
[1:40:14] reading in between the lines to make it
[1:40:16] say something it doesn't say we're not
[1:40:18] reading in between the lines to argue
[1:40:20] with other people but it's a
[1:40:22] relationship we're trying to see what
[1:40:24] he's telling us personally amen and the
[1:40:28] examples of reading in between the lines
[1:40:31] brother brandom gives
[1:40:34] us and someone else can help me with
[1:40:36] this later but when when brother bam is
[1:40:39] talking about reading in between the
[1:40:41] lines I just read the quote for you that
[1:40:43] it's the prophets they could read
[1:40:45] between the
[1:40:47] lines what did he what examples did he
[1:40:49] give of this the example he gives of
[1:40:52] job's burying place in Palestine when
[1:40:55] when job was buried there near heam or
[1:40:58] Mella and then Abraham wanted to be
[1:41:00] buried there Jacob wanted to be buried
[1:41:03] there Joseph all of the prophets they
[1:41:05] wanted to be buried there and brother
[1:41:06] Brandon brings it out why did they want
[1:41:08] to be buried there because the
[1:41:11] resurrection would take place there he
[1:41:14] brings that out there's no New Testament
[1:41:16] scripture that says this is why job was
[1:41:19] buried there or this is why Abra was
[1:41:21] buried there but a prophet was able to
[1:41:24] see that shadow see that type see the
[1:41:27] action and bring out to us this is why
[1:41:30] they did it all right another example he
[1:41:33] gives us of Abraham and Sarah's body
[1:41:36] change amen he was well and stricken in
[1:41:40] age 99 years old 100 years old Sarah 75
[1:41:44] years old and they're going to have a
[1:41:45] baby they're taking these
[1:41:48] Journeys uh Old Kings want to marry her
[1:41:51] grandma and brother Brandon brings it
[1:41:53] out that they were 22 to 25 years old
[1:41:57] that their bodies were changed there's
[1:41:59] no New Testament scripture that tells us
[1:42:01] that there's no Old Testament scripture
[1:42:03] that tells us that but when you put the
[1:42:05] pieces together those things that are on
[1:42:08] the line in between the line a prophet
[1:42:11] can bring it out to you this is what the
[1:42:14] prophet I don't know anyone else that
[1:42:15] brings that type like that it's a
[1:42:17] prophet that does that amen amen he has
[1:42:21] the Liberty to read read between the
[1:42:25] lines another one of this reading in
[1:42:27] between the line brother Brandon brings
[1:42:29] it many times on this revelation of the
[1:42:31] son of man and the angel in Genesis 18
[1:42:35] that asks where is thy wife Sarah she's
[1:42:38] in the tent behind you you know you
[1:42:41] can't really put that together the the
[1:42:43] angel he asked Abraham where's your wife
[1:42:46] Sarah like I mean if he knows what her
[1:42:49] heart saying in her heart he ought to I
[1:42:50] don't know where she's at but he ask him
[1:42:53] the question where's your wife Sarah oh
[1:42:55] she's in the tent behind you and he
[1:42:57] tells and she's laughs in her heart and
[1:42:59] the angel picks it
[1:43:02] up and the prophet kind of he kind of
[1:43:05] goes around it and he and he brings it
[1:43:07] many times that you got to read in
[1:43:09] between the lines of what I'm trying to
[1:43:11] say here of who William brandom is for
[1:43:15] example but I don't think that that
[1:43:18] Liberty of reading in between the lines
[1:43:20] belongs to a five-fold Ministry Pastor
[1:43:24] preacher teacher evangelist I can't see
[1:43:27] it I've seen pastors reading between the
[1:43:31] lines and they'll come up with a
[1:43:32] Doctrine but what is it on the line did
[1:43:35] the prophet say it that way amen and
[1:43:38] that's the question that we have you
[1:43:40] know some of these doctrines the
[1:43:41] brothers that tell you well you know you
[1:43:42] got to you got to read in between the
[1:43:44] lines and of the tent you got to read in
[1:43:47] between the lines like reading between
[1:43:49] the lines with who
[1:43:52] and with what glasses am I reading in
[1:43:54] between the
[1:43:55] lines we have to say what's on the line
[1:43:58] is that right yes so we can see that
[1:44:02] this rumor going out or these doctrines
[1:44:06] that can go out these
[1:44:09] sayings that are inaccurate they can go
[1:44:11] out because
[1:44:14] somebody gets it upon thems okay I know
[1:44:17] what he's saying I I know what he's
[1:44:18] saying I know exactly what he's saying
[1:44:20] he's going to do this he's going to do
[1:44:22] this going to do this and it's mere a
[1:44:25] saying or a
[1:44:27] rumor let me take one more here in the
[1:44:30] message the angel of the Covenant he
[1:44:33] says this here our demonology paragraph
[1:44:36] 33 when job died he specified his
[1:44:39] burying Place Abraham watch between the
[1:44:42] lines now you readers this is not
[1:44:45] written right in the word you have to
[1:44:49] read it between
[1:44:51] it's hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:44:53] prudent when job died he specified his
[1:44:56] burying ground Along Came Abraham when
[1:44:59] Sarah died he brought a parelal ground
[1:45:01] bought it you know how he did with his
[1:45:04] shekels of Sil silver near job and he
[1:45:08] Buri her and when he was di he was
[1:45:11] buried with her Abraham begot Isaac
[1:45:14] Isaac died Isaac slept with Jacob or
[1:45:17] with Abraham Abraham begot Isaac Isaac
[1:45:20] begot Jacob Jacob died down in Egypt but
[1:45:22] he said don't bury me down here why huh
[1:45:27] take me back up to Palestine and bury me
[1:45:30] why bury me with my fathers in the
[1:45:34] cave Jacob begot Joseph we know the
[1:45:37] perfect type of Christ well when Joseph
[1:45:40] was dying he says don't bury my bones
[1:45:42] down here why he was a prophet he
[1:45:46] foresaw things that the rest of them
[1:45:49] didn't see said said take me up to
[1:45:51] Palestine and bury me with my fathers
[1:45:55] and Moses after 400 years took Joseph's
[1:45:58] bones bury them in Palestine I wonder
[1:46:02] why job said I know my redeemer liveth
[1:46:05] in the last day he'll stand on the earth
[1:46:07] and though the skin worms destroy this
[1:46:09] body yet in my flesh shall I see God
[1:46:12] whom I shall see for myself my eyes
[1:46:14] Shall Behold and not another that God
[1:46:16] would stand on the earth and he'd see
[1:46:18] him Abraham said if job's going to see
[1:46:22] him I'm going to be buried right with
[1:46:25] him so I can see him too ain't that nice
[1:46:29] I'll bury Sarah there bury them all
[1:46:32] there for they know that the first
[1:46:35] fruits of the Resurrection wasn't coming
[1:46:37] out of Egypt it was coming out of
[1:46:41] Palestine so that's that's one of those
[1:46:43] in between we take it as common message
[1:46:47] knowledge but not not all the Christian
[1:46:49] churches understand this
[1:46:51] terminology because they don't have the
[1:46:52] in between the line the prophetic eyes
[1:46:55] to see in between the line why do you
[1:46:58] have to leave them bones take them bones
[1:47:00] dead Dry Bones he's dead why you making
[1:47:04] me swear to take your bones all the way
[1:47:06] from Egypt and carry them dead bones and
[1:47:09] wait till you get into the promised land
[1:47:11] and be and be why what's make us go
[1:47:13] through all that trouble for because he
[1:47:15] had a
[1:47:17] revelation where's the resurrection
[1:47:19] going to where is it coming from that's
[1:47:22] where I want to be buried don't leave me
[1:47:24] down here
[1:47:26] swear he made him swear didn't he and
[1:47:30] the prophet brings it
[1:47:32] out it's an in between the line and this
[1:47:34] in between the line privilege Saints
[1:47:38] belongs to the
[1:47:41] prophets because when you get others let
[1:47:44] let me start reading in between the
[1:47:46] lines all right with my
[1:47:49] background my my my way of thinking and
[1:47:52] let Reverend so and so start reading in
[1:47:54] between the lines with his background
[1:47:56] his way of thinking and it's going to be
[1:47:58] contrary allog
[1:48:00] together but let the prophet read in
[1:48:02] between the lines and then we read what
[1:48:04] the prophet
[1:48:06] read you we got so much to preach
[1:48:08] brother Scott I don't need to read in
[1:48:10] between the lines in between a line in
[1:48:12] between another line we got so much on
[1:48:14] the line 1,200 tapes sir on the line man
[1:48:20] you can preach
[1:48:25] that
[1:48:27] amen all right somebody praise the Lord
[1:48:32] should I close
[1:48:34] now where's brother Ark where's brother
[1:48:36] so and so where's Reverend keep going I
[1:48:39] ain't nobody telling me to keep
[1:48:41] going all right brother art said keep
[1:48:43] going I can hear them somehow some way
[1:48:48] so this reading in between the lines
[1:48:49] belong belongs to the prophet and this
[1:48:51] is this will stop this the sayings and
[1:48:54] the rumors that go
[1:48:56] out I used to I I had you know I had
[1:48:59] some stuff I had in between the lines I
[1:49:01] remember when I first married and we
[1:49:03] were living up in Montreal I was on the
[1:49:06] job site with some brothers uh building
[1:49:08] the chimney and working construction and
[1:49:12] subject came up something and I and I
[1:49:15] quoted something to the brother and he
[1:49:17] said wow I never heard that before oh
[1:49:19] yeah it's on the tape
[1:49:20] yeah it is oh I'll find it for you
[1:49:22] that's what I told him yeah it's on the
[1:49:23] tape the prophet said it well he he
[1:49:26] didn't quite say it the way I said it
[1:49:30] the way I was saying it was the way the
[1:49:32] brothers who was I was listening to
[1:49:34] that's the way they were saying it after
[1:49:37] they done digested it and made it read
[1:49:40] in between the line of what the prophet
[1:49:41] is really
[1:49:43] saying and I'm quoting that and the
[1:49:47] brother said oh wow show me that quote
[1:49:49] Oh oh sure I'll find it for you go back
[1:49:52] brother bons I'm looking for that quote
[1:49:54] can't find it can't find it where did
[1:49:56] the prophet say that oh find out he
[1:49:58] didn't say
[1:50:01] that like wow
[1:50:04] my who am I
[1:50:06] quoting I preached a message like that a
[1:50:08] few few years back who are you quoting
[1:50:12] people going around quoting well brother
[1:50:13] per brother brother Jones said brother
[1:50:16] Perry said brother McHugh said brother
[1:50:17] Lee said brother brother uh whoever said
[1:50:22] brother Roger Collins said brother so
[1:50:24] and so said brother who whatever brother
[1:50:26] Israel said whatever the Reverend said
[1:50:28] but what did the prophet
[1:50:30] say amen
[1:50:32] amen I hope that settles down in your
[1:50:35] heart for this
[1:50:38] is where our focus should be
[1:50:42] on on how these things get started now
[1:50:45] I'm going to go into the message just
[1:50:47] for a moment and this is the message
[1:50:50] as I was with
[1:50:52] Moses and this is this is Joshua now
[1:50:57] after um Moses had given him his
[1:51:01] commission so now uh the commission was
[1:51:05] leave Esau alone leave Moab alone you're
[1:51:09] going to the promised land so don't go
[1:51:11] to the left or to the right you stay
[1:51:14] right with the the LW of Moses you
[1:51:16] remember when the Lord came to Joshua he
[1:51:19] told him that he said says uh uh
[1:51:21] meditate on the laws day and night this
[1:51:24] book of the law don't turn to the left
[1:51:27] don't turn to the right it's almost
[1:51:29] similar with our message on Sunday stay
[1:51:31] in the middle of the road don't get
[1:51:33] caught on that side or that side stay
[1:51:35] right with this right here amen and he
[1:51:39] admonished Joshua that and so Joshua had
[1:51:42] to move forward look at this in
[1:51:44] paragraph 28 in the message as I was
[1:51:47] with Moses but people came to brother
[1:51:50] bam about seeking a
[1:51:52] gift in paragraph 27 26 someone asked me
[1:51:56] sometime say shall we seek our gifts now
[1:51:59] for our Ministries some Methodist
[1:52:02] Brethren who had just received the Holy
[1:52:03] Ghost I says no don't do that when you
[1:52:06] do then God can't use you I said the
[1:52:10] only thing to do is just go ahead be in
[1:52:13] a Christian if God has called you he'll
[1:52:17] place you just exactly where you belong
[1:52:21] usually those who seek and try to get
[1:52:24] things if God would give them something
[1:52:27] they more or less be stuffed shirt
[1:52:30] usually the man that God calls is the
[1:52:32] man that's trying to run from him if
[1:52:35] anything Moses and Paul and different
[1:52:38] ones trying to get away from the call
[1:52:41] so very nice way the prophet brings that
[1:52:45] out and he paragraph 30 so this is a tri
[1:52:49] tremendous task we'll get into it but
[1:52:52] Jos Joshua is now Comm commissioned now
[1:52:56] now Moses is dead now and you're going
[1:52:59] to lead the people and it's a tremendous
[1:53:02] task for Joshua you put yourself in his
[1:53:04] shoes you got to stand in line with what
[1:53:08] Moses brought there's nobody greater
[1:53:10] than Moses nobody more anointed than
[1:53:12] Moses and you Joshua are going to take
[1:53:15] Moses's place you might have a few
[1:53:18] critics you might have people that Flex
[1:53:20] against you where that ain't the way
[1:53:23] Moses would have did it you'd have all
[1:53:24] that human problem but this is your
[1:53:26] calling Joshua and when you go forward
[1:53:29] you're going to make mistakes in trying
[1:53:30] to do this and I like this in paragraph
[1:53:33] 30 he says although if I'm
[1:53:36] trying and I fail God won't leave
[1:53:42] me am amen I never have much confidence
[1:53:47] in anybody that's too afraid to do
[1:53:50] anything I'd rather be found a failure
[1:53:54] than too lazy to
[1:53:56] try amen I mean it's
[1:54:02] try
[1:54:04] try he said I'm not a real good witness
[1:54:07] H you know brother Shaw is probably a
[1:54:09] good witness he's a people person or
[1:54:11] sister son show she can be a witness let
[1:54:13] her go talk to you know this teenager go
[1:54:15] talk to this one over there but you
[1:54:17] haven't even tried yet well if I try I'm
[1:54:19] going to stumble over my words I going
[1:54:20] to come across WR but at least
[1:54:23] try try to be a witness he called us to
[1:54:26] be a witness at least try it's better to
[1:54:30] try and fail than not try at all
[1:54:35] amen Satan get you doing nothing because
[1:54:39] you don't want to make a mistake and not
[1:54:41] making a mistake is a great thing you
[1:54:44] don't want to make mistakes on purpose
[1:54:45] of course none of us wants to put our
[1:54:47] foot in our mouth or you know you know
[1:54:50] do something that's wrong but I I if
[1:54:52] it's to the cost where we're not doing
[1:54:54] anything at
[1:54:58] all one time it was said that the
[1:55:02] Ballard and Ballard Flower Company hired
[1:55:04] a man and he was going to sign his name
[1:55:06] and the man had no eraser on the end of
[1:55:09] his pencil pretty confident huh and Mr
[1:55:12] Balor said to him why haven't you got an
[1:55:15] ER eraser he
[1:55:18] said
[1:55:21] could you imagine somebody making this
[1:55:22] statement this is
[1:55:24] funny could you imagine look in the
[1:55:28] mirror and make that
[1:55:30] statement try it you you probably
[1:55:32] couldn't even finish saying it right you
[1:55:35] try looking in the mirror and say I
[1:55:36] don't make
[1:55:38] mistakes who you
[1:55:40] fooling you can't even fool yourself on
[1:55:42] that one you you'll bust up laughing at
[1:55:45] yourself stop Israel
[1:55:48] stop and this man said I don't make
[1:55:51] mistakes he says then I can't use you
[1:55:55] because if you make if you don't make
[1:55:58] mistakes you won't do nothing that's
[1:56:02] true God don't hold you responsible for
[1:56:05] your mistakes he holds you responsible
[1:56:08] for your willful sin he that sins
[1:56:11] willfully after he's received the
[1:56:12] knowledge of the truth but a man that's
[1:56:15] going to do something is going to
[1:56:18] blunder he's going going to fall he's
[1:56:20] going to make mistakes but if he's
[1:56:23] really divinely called and God is in his
[1:56:27] heart he'll Rise
[1:56:29] Again
[1:56:31] amen can I go a little bit further here
[1:56:34] what the prophet of God says
[1:56:36] here about this what Joshua means here
[1:56:41] to the people and how this this crosses
[1:56:45] over even into the
[1:56:47] ministry paragraph 41 now Joshua the new
[1:56:50] Warrior only two left now that ever left
[1:56:53] the promised land and that was Joshua
[1:56:55] and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander
[1:56:58] to lead an army to step into the place
[1:57:00] where a great man like Moses stood it
[1:57:03] was no little task and I think of a
[1:57:05] minister today that's called of God to
[1:57:08] step into the tracks where Jesus stood
[1:57:11] what a command what a commission but
[1:57:15] each that's called of God is
[1:57:17] commissioned to stand stand in that same
[1:57:22] place I'll be with you even in you to
[1:57:25] the end of the way each minister is
[1:57:28] called to stand where he did the works
[1:57:31] that I do shall you do also each
[1:57:33] minister is ordained of God is commanded
[1:57:37] to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ
[1:57:41] and perform the duties that Jesus
[1:57:45] performed that's quite a
[1:57:48] command now as a minister whoever
[1:57:51] Minister you are whatever degree of
[1:57:53] ministry you're in if you when you read
[1:57:56] that then that just moves everybody else
[1:57:58] out of your focus out of your
[1:58:01] vision because God didn't call you to
[1:58:03] follow other
[1:58:04] ministers am other
[1:58:07] pastors other song
[1:58:10] leaders other teachers God didn't call
[1:58:12] you to follow that God told you to
[1:58:14] follow Jesus Christ he is our example
[1:58:18] and this is the task that Joshua had was
[1:58:21] to follow exactly what Moses brought a
[1:58:25] tremendous
[1:58:27] task a task you can't take lightly a
[1:58:31] task that requires your utmost attention
[1:58:34] amen amen
[1:58:36] amen and the minister today he's called
[1:58:40] to that position skip down to paragraph
[1:58:42] 53 just for a moment he says this here
[1:58:45] God called
[1:58:46] ministers ought not to be so stuffed out
[1:58:49] with
[1:58:50] theology but have visit the land to
[1:58:54] where we're going bringing back evidence
[1:58:57] of the Divine love and power of Jesus
[1:59:00] Christ to make known to their
[1:59:02] congregation that there is a land beyond
[1:59:06] the river so look at
[1:59:10] that so that's the what the ministry is
[1:59:13] called
[1:59:15] to excuse me and the prophet of God goes
[1:59:19] forward and said this I read this for
[1:59:21] you all last couple weeks
[1:59:24] ago and I read it again paragraph 55 now
[1:59:29] Joshua and all of this knowing that the
[1:59:32] command was great but having the
[1:59:34] Assurance he could be
[1:59:38] Fearless he could be as we call it
[1:59:42] Reckless as long as he was pointed in
[1:59:45] the right way he might break up against
[1:59:48] a hill that that would knock him
[1:59:50] backwards but he was carried the right
[1:59:52] way so can the Church of the Living God
[1:59:55] be Reckless and fearless in faith if
[1:59:59] we're pointed the right way for he said
[2:00:01] as I was with Moses I'll be with you
[2:00:04] I'll not fail you nor forsake you never
[2:00:07] forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he
[2:00:10] will not fail joshu Joshua he will not
[2:00:13] fail us he'll be with us and as we find
[2:00:18] J to take this commission knowing the
[2:00:22] responsibility responsibilities was
[2:00:24] leading him through lands that he have
[2:00:27] to go over into the other land he'd have
[2:00:30] to set up their Kingdom he'd have to
[2:00:32] divide the inheritance among them he
[2:00:35] know that the commission was
[2:00:38] tremendous far more than what Moses had
[2:00:42] done Joshua had more to do than Moses
[2:00:47] had to do another thing
[2:00:50] and this is getting to our text here
[2:00:51] paragraph 58 another thing he was to
[2:00:54] lead them along the border amongst their
[2:00:58] Brethren and they had already tasted
[2:01:00] blood he had to conquer them he had to
[2:01:03] keep them quiet as they marched on so is
[2:01:06] it today with this new Pentecostal group
[2:01:08] that's Rising now they've tasted
[2:01:12] denominationalism it's so hard to keep
[2:01:14] them down and brother ROM continues on
[2:01:19] on so this Esau and Moses the commission
[2:01:23] or the Commandment was don't fuss with
[2:01:26] them they are
[2:01:28] brothers but but but they have their
[2:01:31] inheritance and we have our inheritance
[2:01:34] now we are headed somewhere
[2:01:38] Saints we are given precious promises
[2:01:42] that we should be focused on this
[2:01:45] morning I don't think coming to church
[2:01:48] and even coming to this church is just
[2:01:50] the fill of time Gap but I think that I
[2:01:53] believe that the Lord wants to lead us
[2:01:57] somewhere and I believe that there's a a
[2:01:59] position and a place that God wants our
[2:02:02] faith to rise into for the hour that we
[2:02:07] live in Hallelujah now when brother
[2:02:10] bradam is talking through this message
[2:02:11] talking about the promised land he's
[2:02:13] bringing them through Egypt he's
[2:02:15] bringing them through the Wilderness and
[2:02:17] the promised land is a type of the Holy
[2:02:19] Ghost and but he he also brings it as a
[2:02:23] a type of the full
[2:02:27] promise it's a type of a power a power
[2:02:31] that God gives to the church paragraph
[2:02:35] 53 says it's to Divine love and power
[2:02:40] that this commission that this Joshua is
[2:02:43] trying to lead the people into this
[2:02:45] promised land now not everybody is
[2:02:48] focused on on the same
[2:02:50] things and what Esau is doing in their
[2:02:53] church and what Moab is doing in his
[2:02:56] church and the way they do things that's
[2:02:58] not my
[2:02:59] business we we're connected to them yes
[2:03:03] we know about them we're related to them
[2:03:05] they might do some things that might be
[2:03:07] great good ideas the denominational
[2:03:09] World their churches do things that are
[2:03:12] might be good ideas might be great but
[2:03:14] we have an example for us
[2:03:17] today and I don't need to stream a
[2:03:20] denominational preacher to find out the
[2:03:22] word of the Lord for my
[2:03:25] day God has given me that
[2:03:29] already now God uses other people yes he
[2:03:35] uses other Christians that are not in
[2:03:38] the message yes you know aimc was God's
[2:03:42] man God had a relationship with him but
[2:03:44] aimik didn't have to be
[2:03:46] circumcised aik didn't have what Abra
[2:03:48] Abraham had to go through as far as we
[2:03:50] know it's a different Covenant Al
[2:03:53] together amen you know if the Baptist
[2:03:56] and they've invited me to go preach I'll
[2:03:58] go preach for them am I've gone I can
[2:04:01] work with them as a brother under this
[2:04:04] right
[2:04:05] here under this right here under this
[2:04:09] right here but they don't know about
[2:04:12] this over
[2:04:13] here and I don't need to fuss and argue
[2:04:15] with them over this amen they have their
[2:04:19] they have their Covenant God put them
[2:04:21] there for a purpose you remember when
[2:04:24] Cain slew
[2:04:26] Abel he said Lord my punishment is
[2:04:29] greater than I can bear why didn't God
[2:04:31] just kill him no he didn't kill him he
[2:04:35] he said I I'm going to cover you I'm put
[2:04:38] a mark on you so nobody will kill
[2:04:40] you and he let him live because he has a
[2:04:43] purpose God has a purpose in a plan am
[2:04:46] amen exactly right amen and we want to
[2:04:50] get involved in that I was listening to
[2:04:51] the message the other day and brother
[2:04:53] man talking about this brother oh my I
[2:04:56] news Escape my mind but they had a a an
[2:05:00] army jet that was going to take him to
[2:05:03] go and re and rais the dead of this this
[2:05:07] man not stat Cliffe but it's it was
[2:05:10] another brother maybe a stat
[2:05:12] Cliffe and and brother bam says I they
[2:05:16] contacted him he'll be there and so many
[2:05:19] hours it was an Army jet plane that
[2:05:20] would get him from the US over to
[2:05:23] Germany to raise this child that had
[2:05:27] died and brother man says I went to the
[2:05:29] Lord in prayer and the Lord didn't tell
[2:05:30] him nothing then he went into the woods
[2:05:32] and prayed he still didn't say nothing
[2:05:33] then the next day he got up he said his
[2:05:36] wife went to work 6:00 a.m. in the
[2:05:38] morning he started praying he said then
[2:05:40] a sweet voice came to him and said don't
[2:05:42] rebuke that this is my
[2:05:45] hand he said it was a sweet voice that
[2:05:47] told him that so he got on the phone and
[2:05:49] he told them you know I can't rebuke
[2:05:52] this this is God this is the hand of God
[2:05:55] now there's other times he could rebuke
[2:05:57] it but you see when you're following the
[2:06:00] lord it's not a direct line like this
[2:06:02] right
[2:06:03] here and not everybody gets the same
[2:06:06] judgment and everybody not everybody
[2:06:09] understands what you see they'll never
[2:06:13] see it that's right so why would I argue
[2:06:16] and fuss with them yes sir and this was
[2:06:19] the Commandment that that God gave to to
[2:06:26] Joshua look at this in paragraph 62 it
[2:06:29] says this
[2:06:31] here brother the real Church of the
[2:06:33] Living God has no forms has no Creeds is
[2:06:36] led by the power of God that's in every
[2:06:39] individual's heart pass by your brethren
[2:06:43] don't fuss at them regretter than they
[2:06:46] don't fuss at them just just go by I
[2:06:50] want you to notice the great things
[2:06:52] taking place here there was Esau Moab
[2:06:55] and those we referred to last night many
[2:06:57] of those people many of those were
[2:06:59] actually borderline believers they were
[2:07:03] right on the
[2:07:04] border well I got to stop here in just
[2:07:06] something a moment and he continues on
[2:07:09] he says this here in paragraph 66 you
[2:07:13] Lutheran that believe in justification
[2:07:15] your inheritance don't lay there if
[2:07:17] you're called
[2:07:19] if you're just a Lutheran that's all the
[2:07:21] father you'll ever get you Methodist and
[2:07:23] Nazarene and Pilgrim Holiness and Church
[2:07:26] of God uh who believe in sanctification
[2:07:29] the killing of the evil that's in you
[2:07:32] taking out the roots of evil you belong
[2:07:34] across the
[2:07:36] river but to you men and women that
[2:07:39] there is something in you calling out
[2:07:42] the Deep to the Deep there's a Jordan
[2:07:45] yet to cross and a land Beyond the river
[2:07:49] amen said you're going to pass by your
[2:07:51] brethren you're going to pass by your
[2:07:54] brethren they're near the borderline if
[2:07:57] you pass by them don't say nothing to

[2:10:12] pressure off of me trying to make other
[2:10:14] folks believe like me amen if they was
[2:10:18] supposed to believe like me God would
[2:10:20] reveal it to them like he revealed it to
[2:10:24] you amen can you handle that are you
[2:10:28] good with that are you okay with that
[2:10:31] that God is big enough to speak to them
[2:10:32] if he needs to speak to
[2:10:34] them you know some of these little
[2:10:36] conflicts we get into it you don't see
[2:10:38] it you don't see it and we leave with a
[2:10:40] bad attitude on one
[2:10:43] another but we shouldn't have a bad
[2:10:45] attitude one against one another we just
[2:10:48] don't see the same way right I'm not
[2:10:52] called to walk and handle the message
[2:10:55] that way maybe somebody is I'm not
[2:10:58] called to handle the Bible that way
[2:11:00] maybe somebody is but if God called me
[2:11:02] to handle the Bible the way I handle it
[2:11:05] then I need to handle
[2:11:07] it I you God called me to handle the
[2:11:10] message the way I handle it then that's
[2:11:11] what I need to
[2:11:13] do is that right
[2:11:15] Saints or should would I be following
[2:11:17] somebody else should you be following
[2:11:18] somebody else you got to follow where
[2:11:20] God leads you God places you let me get
[2:11:23] into this here I got 10 more five more
[2:11:26] minutes five to seven more minutes all
[2:11:28] right paragraph 71 I like
[2:11:33] this don't disagree with him just go
[2:11:35] ahead leave him alone pay for what you
[2:11:38] get if you have to pass through his
[2:11:40] country amen he was predestinated to be
[2:11:45] that
[2:11:46] woo if God would would expected or
[2:11:50] predestinated Moab to join up with
[2:11:53] Israel they would have joined up amen if
[2:11:57] he had predestinated Esau to go with
[2:11:59] Israel Esau would have jumped in and
[2:12:01] went but he give him his inheritance on
[2:12:04] the other side of the river so how can
[2:12:07] you try to make all Lutheran see it all
[2:12:11] Baptist see it all the Presbyterians and
[2:12:14] nazarin and Pilgrim Holiness don't
[2:12:17] condemn them amen that's all they know
[2:12:20] hallu that's all that's in them but to
[2:12:24] you who
[2:12:26] believe Glory I like that oh God to you
[2:12:31] who know to you that's got something
[2:12:34] that's calling to the Deep if all the
[2:12:36] Deep you've got has been satisfied then
[2:12:39] stay where you are amen but for me in my
[2:12:42] house for me there's something more than
[2:12:46] what we've seen
[2:12:48] there's a land beyond the river
[2:12:50] somewhere there's still a deep calling
[2:12:52] to the deep I cannot be satisfied with
[2:12:55] theology I cannot be satisfied with good
[2:12:57] church I cannot be satisfied with a good
[2:13:00] campaign I cannot be satisfied with a
[2:13:03] little healing service there is
[2:13:05] something beyond that that's calling now
[2:13:10] brothers and sisters that's what's in my
[2:13:12] heart when I handle the message there's
[2:13:15] something that's far deeper
[2:13:18] than just a message church here in the
[2:13:21] city something far deeper than that it's
[2:13:24] something calling to my heart for the
[2:13:27] great Rapture of the church a power an
[2:13:30] anointing that's going to make this word
[2:13:32] live in my life amen there's something
[2:13:36] greater than this the way we've always
[2:13:38] done it and we thank God for what we
[2:13:40] have it's not discrediting what we have
[2:13:43] but there's a deep calling to my deep to
[2:13:45] the deep down in my soul and I handled
[2:13:48] message I I believe that that you know
[2:13:50] that should be uh manifested in our in
[2:13:52] our churches
[2:13:54] today that should be manifested in me
[2:13:57] today I how many you feel that way you
[2:14:00] get you hear those you you listen to the
[2:14:02] message you hear the prayer line go by
[2:14:05] you see the anointing take place there's
[2:14:08] something that belongs to us I believe
[2:14:11] that belongs to us amen there's a power
[2:14:14] there's an anointing now if you're
[2:14:17] satisfied
[2:14:18] with handling the word and the way
[2:14:20] things are today then stay where you are
[2:14:23] no criticism no hatred against you no
[2:14:26] trying to force you into anything but
[2:14:28] when you know what the word says for the
[2:14:31] hour you know God is going to have a
[2:14:34] church amen yes let me
[2:14:38] close let me
[2:14:41] close the prophet of God takes
[2:14:45] um I'm going to take this this this
[2:14:48] message here it's in the power of
[2:14:54] transformation and he says this
[2:15:01] here I got two places I need to get to
[2:15:04] before I
[2:15:05] close but the power of
[2:15:07] transformation paragraph 72 he said the
[2:15:10] same thing it is about having a church
[2:15:11] here in the last
[2:15:13] days look at this paragraph 72 1965 he
[2:15:17] says this the same thing it is about
[2:15:19] having a church here in the last days he
[2:15:23] is going to have a
[2:15:24] bride he is able of these stones to rise
[2:15:27] children to Abraham if we don't follow
[2:15:30] him he'll get somebody else that will
[2:15:33] follow him see he is going to have it
[2:15:37] because he has already spoke it whatever
[2:15:40] he says it has to be that way it cannot
[2:15:43] change it must come forth that way
[2:15:46] because he said it would
[2:15:48] and all this great thing that we've know
[2:15:50] come to pass after he spoke it he could
[2:15:52] have take a rest everything under
[2:15:55] control his seed was his word and his
[2:15:58] word is a seed Jesus said and everything
[2:16:02] would be all right because he had said
[2:16:04] for it to for he had said for it to
[2:16:06] bring forth of its kind transforming
[2:16:09] only to its kind see his word had to be
[2:16:14] of its kind if he said a palm tree he
[2:16:17] didn't mean palm and an oak mixed
[2:16:19] together he me a palm tree here and an
[2:16:20] oak tree here everything positionally in
[2:16:24] its place oh we can only learn that that
[2:16:28] what part of the word we are we must
[2:16:31] take our place no matter what it is I
[2:16:35] think of this little sister here in the
[2:16:37] wheelchair sometime how many faithful
[2:16:39] prayers has been made over it then we
[2:16:42] don't understand so we just committed to
[2:16:45] God she's a flower here among you with
[2:16:48] her pleasantness and everything see that
[2:16:51] we can get up and go around how she
[2:16:53] would long to do that but yet she is
[2:16:56] Pleasant just the way she sits always
[2:16:59] get inspired to watch the little lady
[2:17:02] see because we all believe in healing
[2:17:06] we've seen God do Miracles far beyond
[2:17:09] that and she knows that too see but
[2:17:12] she's willing to take her place see
[2:17:15] whatever it is that's what we want and I
[2:17:18] believe it was David said I would rather
[2:17:19] be a doormat at the house of the Lord
[2:17:22] than to dwell in tents with the wicked
[2:17:24] you see no matter what it is take my
[2:17:27] place sometimes you have to separate
[2:17:30] from everything that's dear on Earth to
[2:17:32] you to take your position that God has
[2:17:35] called you to I'm sure you can read
[2:17:38] between the lines what I'm saying see
[2:17:42] sometimes the very dearest person on
[2:17:44] Earth you have to shake hands with them
[2:17:47] and take your position in Christ to
[2:17:50] where God has called you see but what is
[2:17:54] God doing transforming you from what you
[2:17:57] was maybe a daughter or son or whatever
[2:18:00] it is from a lovely family sometimes he
[2:18:04] places you somewhere else because it's
[2:18:07] his way of doing it see by the renewing
[2:18:09] of your mind to obey the word of God
[2:18:12] regardless of what the price is see
[2:18:16] these things don't come it didn't our
[2:18:19] red our Redemption wasn't a cheap thing
[2:18:22] it was the son of God had to die for us
[2:18:25] see the things of value come of a great
[2:18:28] price to bring this message it wasn't
[2:18:32] easy see no it isn't I had to forsake
[2:18:37] everything that was dear to me even my
[2:18:40] own people everybody but you see the
[2:18:43] value of it is you see is to do the will
[2:18:46] of God and to do that which knowing that
[2:18:50] there is something in me when they used
[2:18:52] to say well that was going to put me
[2:18:55] away thought I lost my mind baptizing in
[2:18:57] the name of Jesus Christ contrary to the
[2:19:00] church and all these things they said he
[2:19:01] is crazy but you see no matter what they
[2:19:04] said there's something has to be done
[2:19:07] and God just takes a person sticks him
[2:19:10] in his hand and say do this and you do
[2:19:14] it amen so we have to take our position
[2:19:17] amen and sometimes that's a costly
[2:19:20] that's a great responsibility it cost a
[2:19:23] lot for the prophet to take his position
[2:19:28] to take his stand and stay focused with
[2:19:31] the original calling remember when he
[2:19:35] had the to lay the Cornerstone of his
[2:19:38] church and the vision came to him he saw
[2:19:42] the vision of those two trees the
[2:19:43] Trinity and the Oneness he saw that
[2:19:46] vision of that he was Port that and to
[2:19:48] plant that and watch those trees grow
[2:19:50] but never to mix them up but he planted
[2:19:53] the seed of the word and the angel the
[2:19:56] word or the the vision told him that to
[2:19:59] do the work of evangelist for the time
[2:20:01] will come they'll not endure sound
[2:20:05] Doctrine but you got to stay with what
[2:20:07] God has revealed and look at look at the
[2:20:10] fruit of his ministry today look at the
[2:20:14] price that was paid in his life and the
[2:20:17] cost and the sweat and the tears and the
[2:20:21] misunderstanding he's talking about
[2:20:23] dearest of friends he had to part with
[2:20:26] and shake hands with and separate with
[2:20:29] because of this focus of this
[2:20:32] Vision so what about you and
[2:20:36] I what about you and
[2:20:39] I can we take that attitude of what
[2:20:43] Jesus told
[2:20:45] Peter you know sometimes we come to
[2:20:47] church Church like who's going to be
[2:20:48] there or who's not there or who's
[2:20:51] preaching or what time what what is that
[2:20:54] today amen follow thou me what are the
[2:21:00] other churches doing all the way they
[2:21:01] handle this how does that church do this
[2:21:03] so what's this pastor doing what's this
[2:21:05] ministry doing what is that to
[2:21:09] thee follow thou me God makes it very
[2:21:14] plain and very clear that it's not nice
[2:21:17] to have Brethren you walk with it's nice
[2:21:19] to know that there's others that see
[2:21:21] what you see but what if you had to come
[2:21:24] to church and no one else was here would
[2:21:25] you still
[2:21:28] come what if you were the only
[2:21:30] one would you still do it what if your
[2:21:34] entire family that's believing the word
[2:21:36] what if they all just gradually begin to
[2:21:39] walk away from the
[2:21:40] word and you're so caught up with your
[2:21:43] family and so connected with that then
[2:21:45] you'd have to have what the problem
[2:21:47] Prophet had you have to have what Joshua
[2:21:49] had you have to have what every True
[2:21:51] Believer has that not everybody is
[2:21:54] predestinated to walk under the Covenant
[2:21:57] that you're walking
[2:21:59] under and you just have to walk under it
[2:22:02] whether it looks strict whether it looks
[2:22:04] crazy look like you lost your mind what
[2:22:06] is that to thee what what's going to
[2:22:08] happen to John what's that what business
[2:22:10] is that yours Paul Peter why you want to
[2:22:13] know what's going on with John follow me
[2:22:16] Peter follow
[2:22:19] me I like this final quote here that
[2:22:22] brother bam talking in his laying of the
[2:22:25] Cornerstone he says I left the house
[2:22:28] speaking to brother Cox this is in the
[2:22:30] message impersonation of Christianity
[2:22:32] paragraph
[2:22:33] 31 you was talking about the the the
[2:22:36] standing in the middle of the road that
[2:22:37] Canadian Pastor that came over he left
[2:22:40] discouraged because the American Church
[2:22:42] they were all Fanatics and they one
[2:22:44] extreme to the next you got this over
[2:22:46] there you got the these people pulling
[2:22:48] from different sides and we got it here
[2:22:50] today too in different forms they're
[2:22:52] called doctrines and then we cross one
[2:22:55] another's path and then there's a cross
[2:22:58] pollinate and there's a cross influence
[2:23:00] you come across people that supposed to
[2:23:03] be walking with the Bible is supposed to
[2:23:04] be walking with the word you're supposed
[2:23:06] to be I'm supposed to be walking with
[2:23:07] the word and we come across all kind of
[2:23:09] people and then so you see these things
[2:23:12] happening and you try to place people is
[2:23:15] he a Believer make believer unbeliever
[2:23:16] where does he believe the word should I
[2:23:18] fellowship with should I just kick him
[2:23:19] out what you know who is she what is you
[2:23:21] know you got to let that go you got to
[2:23:25] let that go and stay focused on what God
[2:23:28] has called you
[2:23:30] to and if I am going to be responsible
[2:23:35] to stand in the line of Jesus as a
[2:23:39] minister I'm supposed to do what Jesus
[2:23:41] did man that's a great enough example I
[2:23:43] don't need to be looking at no one else
[2:23:45] no one else right
[2:23:48] but he he's telling this story here and
[2:23:49] he's he's coming down and he says but as
[2:23:51] I left the house speaking to brother Cox
[2:23:53] on I rot down he knows nothing of this
[2:23:56] as he sits here down the road I said
[2:23:58] Lord how true that is how hard that has
[2:24:02] been to try to get the true gospel to
[2:24:05] the
[2:24:06] people pulling from both sides and
[2:24:09] trying to hold in the middle of the road
[2:24:11] as we've contended from that since the
[2:24:14] hour the Cornerstone was laid see now
[2:24:17] and some I said what about these
[2:24:20] Americans down here what will happen to
[2:24:22] them it seemed like something said just
[2:24:25] spoke to me and said what are you
[2:24:28] doing what is this to thee follow thou
[2:24:33] me and the vision returned to my mind
[2:24:37] the day that I laid the Cornerstone on
[2:24:41] return home I was quoting it to my wife
[2:24:44] how many remembers the vision of the
[2:24:46] morning the Cornerstone it's laying
[2:24:49] right in the Cornerstone Now 23 years
[2:24:53] ago it's so nice how the Lord will
[2:24:56] remind you of what your Cornerstone is
[2:25:01] had to remind the prophet remember when
[2:25:03] you laid the Cornerstone what about
[2:25:06] these Americans what about these
[2:25:07] churches these people pulling from both
[2:25:09] sides and we're in a time right now too

[2:27:37] describing this that little place there
[2:27:40] to tie in what he's saying here about 40
[2:27:43] miles any civil a one little store for
[2:27:45] the ranchers and things that looked like
[2:27:47] it was at Klondike and it turned out to
[2:27:51] be this
[2:27:52] Tabernacle and I was standing right here
[2:27:55] I was calling in great barrels of the
[2:27:57] prettiest food I ever seen radishes look
[2:28:00] like um three foot long turnips greens
[2:28:05] and potatoes and everything and he said
[2:28:08] store in plenty of it see and I was
[2:28:11] standing there just storing it in and I
[2:28:13] woke up I couldn't understand it I
[2:28:16] thought it was just a dream and I went
[2:28:18] on and brother Woods many of them so
[2:28:21] here was the interpretation I had to
[2:28:23] wait just like I've told you many times
[2:28:26] things has to happen before you can
[2:28:28] certain things that can bring in in line
[2:28:31] here and he's bringing an interpretation
[2:28:34] of something else he was talking about
[2:28:36] so he's talking about this place this
[2:28:38] little building taking sides with Jesus
[2:28:40] paragraph
[2:28:41] 102 he says this here drop down to
[2:28:44] paragraph 103 to save time he says says
[2:28:46] you remember what the dream that I got
[2:28:49] the interpretation was go back and store
[2:28:52] up food where was The Storehouse this
[2:28:56] Tabernacle where is there anything like
[2:28:58] it in the country around here anywhere
[2:29:00] that will compare with the message that
[2:29:03] we have now of course our little
[2:29:06] brothers here that's along here these
[2:29:09] are other little churches are us we're
[2:29:12] one where would you go to find it show
[2:29:15] its comparison anywhere you go right out
[2:29:17] in denominational Creeds you go right
[2:29:20] away from the name of the Lord Jesus you
[2:29:23] go right away from these other things
[2:29:25] see and here is where the food has been
[2:29:28] stored one message that I preached
[2:29:31] here to you all look I've been preaching
[2:29:34] for one to six hours you on a message
[2:29:37] well if I had to use one of those
[2:29:39] message I take a week to take it just a
[2:29:42] little bit here a little bit there see
[2:29:44] because it's been stored up here it's on
[2:29:46] on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes
[2:29:50] where people in their houses them tapes
[2:29:53] will fall right into the hands of the
[2:29:55] predestinated of God he can direct the
[2:29:58] word he'll direct everything just
[2:30:00] exactly to his course that's the reason
[2:30:03] he sent me back to do this store up the
[2:30:06] food here he forbid me to go
[2:30:10] overseas the sign of the answer sir
[2:30:12] night paragraph 152 I went back in the
[2:30:15] vision and there was a little long
[2:30:17] building then a voice said to me and all
[2:30:19] you remember this many of you a voice
[2:30:21] said to me bring in food store it in
[2:30:25] that's the only way to keep them here is
[2:30:27] give them food and I brought in had
[2:30:31] brought in great big barrels full of the
[2:30:34] prettiest carrots the prettiest
[2:30:36] vegetables and things I ever seen do you
[2:30:38] remember now the vision now I told you
[2:30:41] later what the interpretation was I was
[2:30:43] supposed to go to Switzerland and
[2:30:46] brother the augen
[2:30:47] bright and brother bam goes on so this
[2:30:51] is the vision that told him to store up
[2:30:53] this food Christ The Mystery of God
[2:30:55] revealed he says this here in paragraph
[2:31:00] four bless our dear Pastor the shepherd
[2:31:02] we pray that you'll anoint him with the
[2:31:04] Holy Spirit of the word and reveal to
[2:31:07] him to them and feed the flock and once
[2:31:12] just a while ago when he showed the
[2:31:14] vision the little Tabernacle here about
[2:31:16] to store up the food that there will
[2:31:19] come a time when this would all be
[2:31:22] needed when we seen brother sofman and
[2:31:25] brother Rood ready to cross over into
[2:31:27] another country but you said store up
[2:31:30] this food here for the time lord
[2:31:33] reverently I've tried to do that brother
[2:31:36] random continues on the same message
[2:31:38] dropped down to paragraph number 90 help
[2:31:41] this morning Lord as we read the
[2:31:44] word May the Holy Spirit reveal it to us
[2:31:47] that the church might be fully
[2:31:49] established in the faith that was once
[2:31:51] delivered to the Saints to hold them and
[2:31:54] may you and may and and may as you gave
[2:31:57] the vision some two years ago to store
[2:32:00] up the food fine healthy looking
[2:32:02] vegetables that I saw in the vision
[2:32:05] being stored here in this Tabernacle may
[2:32:09] we today receive a whole barrel full of
[2:32:11] that granted Lord or tape load that it
[2:32:15] might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the
[2:32:17] hour that we live to give us sustaining
[2:32:21] strength the spiritual strength for the
[2:32:25] task that lays ahead granted father we
[2:32:30] all have a task that lays ahead and it's
[2:32:33] going to be it's going to be aligned
[2:32:35] with this food that's been stored up to
[2:32:38] us amen how many believe that so that's
[2:32:41] the reason why we do it we read from it
[2:32:43] we listen to it we point the people we
[2:32:45] point you you to it cuz that's where
[2:32:47] your sustaining strength is and that
[2:32:50] that Focus has to stay there you get to
[2:32:52] where you get to where the quotes is too
[2:32:55] much or the play in the tape you want to
[2:32:56] hear me preach then you know something
[2:32:58] ain't right if you want to hear me
[2:33:00] preach over you know hearing what the
[2:33:03] word of the Lord is and something ain't
[2:33:04] right there's a balance there God bless
[2:33:06] you you want to hear anointed preaching
[2:33:08] you want to hear a pastor you want to
[2:33:09] hear a reverend so and so but in the day
[2:33:12] when your ear is turning away from
[2:33:14] hearing the voice of the prophet you
[2:33:16] just know something's wrong because the
[2:33:19] angel of the Lord the vision told
[2:33:22] Brother brandom to store up the food on
[2:33:23] the tapes amen amen amen and when you're
[2:33:28] listening to the tapes it will tell you
[2:33:31] if we should have gifts pastors
[2:33:33] preachers teachers it tells us all of
[2:33:36] that amen you say well we're just
[2:33:38] listening to the tapes because we don't
[2:33:39] want any Pastor if you're listening to
[2:33:41] the tape it'll tell you who a pastor is
[2:33:43] and what a pastor is what the gifts are
[2:33:45] rather run the church all of that is on
[2:33:47] the tape amen but but the enemy don't
[2:33:50] want you to even listen to the
[2:33:53] tape tell you we got two weeks three
