[4:25] brand concerning the 68 million slaying
[4:29] by the uh Roman Catholic Church what
[4:32] time in history did this take place and
[4:37] over how long a period of time did this
[4:40] take place take Smucker's glorious uh
[4:44] Reformation I guess some of these
[4:46] Scholars have that and it's the history
[4:48] of the church and I forget not just what
[4:50] page it's on but it taken place from the
[4:52] time of the the thing was produced or
[4:56] given to the church by St Augustine
[5:00] of Hippo Africa that was ad
[5:04] 354 and it lasted till 1850 the massacre
[5:08] of Island see so that time is from ad 33
[5:12] uh ad
[5:14] 3354 let me get that right now from
[5:18] 8354 to to
[5:22] 81850 1850 according to the history
[5:26] there was 68 million Protestants put the
[5:30] death recorded on the Roman martyrology
[5:32] for disagreeing with the pope of
[5:35] romeen That's History if you want said
[5:38] wrong well then maybe George Washington
[5:39] wasn't here in Lincoln you know know us
[5:41] live back to see it but I believe he was
[5:43] here anyhow I see signs that they were
[5:48] here brother Brandon the 19th Chapter of

[6:23] was 7,000 see and that's
[6:27] kissing baa don't you know how many here
[6:30] was f a
[6:33] Catholic you kiss images see and
[6:38] remember in the time of Babylon in
[6:42] Nebuchadnezzar when the Gentile kingdom
[6:44] was issued in see when Gentile Kingdom
[6:47] issued in it come in by the worship of a
[6:51] man Nebuchadnezzar made a statue of a
[6:54] man and if you got a spiritual mind now
[6:56] listen to this Revelation that spirit
[6:59] that man that he made a a revelation of
[7:02] or he made a image of by his Revelation
[7:05] was
[7:07] Daniel a religious man being
[7:10] worshiped see it because he named him um
[7:16] belar was it or Bel jar which was the
[7:19] name of his God and he made an image of
[7:22] that God which was the image of Daniel
[7:24] and Daniel refused to bow to his own
[7:27] image and here it is again see now now
[7:29] watch the Gentile kingdom was issued in
[7:32] in the days of Babylon by King
[7:34] Nebuchadnezzar a gentile King putting
[7:37] church and state together by taking a
[7:38] holy image of a holy man and forcing
[7:41] worship to
[7:43] it the Gentile Kingdom ends in the feet
[7:46] with a handwriting on the wall by a
[7:49] political power that's United church and
[7:51] state together to force kissing images
[7:55] amen image of a holy man

[11:55] at the judgment is it after or before
[11:58] after the rest of the Dead live not for
[12:01] a thousand years they didn't go with
[12:02] their bride let's see you have said many
[12:05] times that communism was raised up by
[12:09] God to serve his purpose as king
[12:11] nebuchad now where did the communism fit
[12:15] into the picture that will it finally
[12:19] will finally do how does it wind up many
[12:23] scholars believe that in the uh Kingdom
[12:27] of the north God and Magog mentioned in
[12:31] the scriptures goes down against Israel
[12:34] in the um in
[12:37] the can't make out just what that is
[12:40] yeah yeah I believe of the some of the
[12:45] tapes taken say you said it would
[12:49] finally drop
[12:51] it that communism would finally
[12:55] destroy um Catholicism or the Vatican by
[12:59] uh uh an explosion is this right yes
[13:04] Revelations 16 you'll find it and
[13:06] Revelations 18 uh 8 and 12 if the person
[13:09] sure want take this piece of paper on
[13:11] that you can look it right up yeah see
[13:13] Al last Al last a great City for in one
[13:15] hour she's come to her end you see the
[13:17] merchants and everything Earth bought
[13:18] her merchandise it will be that's right
[13:20] and don't it's qu just forget about
[13:23] communism it's nothing in the world but
[13:25] a bunch of of people that's nothing but
[13:28] Barb iians it's ungodly it's a system
[13:31] let me show you something just show you
[13:33] how simple it is why there's only 1% of
[13:36] all Russia that's
[13:40] communism they need a
[13:44] messenger 1% than 99% of them are still
[13:48] on the Christian side
[13:51] 1% now how can 1% control
[13:55] 99% that ought to explain it to you
[13:57] right there God did permitted what would
[13:59] they be throw out long ago see sure
[14:02] brother brand you said that Rome would
[14:04] take the government well the Jews at the
[14:08] last three and A2 years that is going
[14:11] the the first three and A2 years of the
[14:13] tribulation or will it be the last three
[14:15] and a half is this correct it will be
[14:17] the last three and A2 years that's right
[14:19] not the first C it's already passed got
[14:21] one more after this um my dear brother
[14:24] will the Malachi 45 Elijah go to the
[14:29] Wilderness as First Kings 17 tells us
[14:32] the other Elijah did well I wouldn't
[14:35] exactly say that he would um that he
[14:39] would go to the Wilderness but he be
[14:41] this you see he was elishah and Elijah
[14:44] did you notice most of men like that are
[14:47] men who are away they they keep away
[14:49] from the people they're very odd they
[14:52] don't associate too much with people you
[14:54] know how Elisha Was Elijah and John the
[14:57] Baptist and that nature of that Spirit
[14:59] see and uh they don't he he I believe
[15:02] the man be a lover of the Wilderness and
[15:04] maybe stay in the wilderness but now
[15:06] it's to say he's going to be a Hermit
[15:08] and live in the wilderness I don't know
[15:10] about that sometimes they did Elisha
[15:12] didn't but Elijah did then John he he
[15:14] lived in the wilderness and or tell
[15:16] these other prophets when they come out
[15:17] of Judea there I don't know where
[15:19] they'll stay they may camp out on the
[15:21] hill somewhere what they'll do in the
[15:22] days of their prophecy I I don't know
[15:24] what they will do but you what I'm
[15:26] trying to say is this they will they um
[15:30] will they be a um they're trying to ask
[15:33] will they just be Wilderness dwellers
[15:35] well they have to go to Northern British
[15:37] Columbia get enough Wilderness to dwell
[15:38] in now somewhere you see so it'll be
[15:40] someone the Wilderness is all cut out
[15:43] see there's not much Wilderness left see
[15:46] so the only thing that they might be a
[15:48] lover of the Wilderness see and stay
[15:51] maybe a lot in the wilderness and
[15:53] there'll be have you can notice the
[15:55] nature of is that uncompromising see and
[15:58] you you'll know it when come you'll see
[16:00] it you're you're wide awake now here's
[16:02] one I don't know how to touch it and U I
[16:05] got another this before this night I'm
[16:06] going to ask him to snap the tape this
[16:07] minut um if God is one personality why
[16:12] or how could he talk to himself on Mount
[16:16] Transfiguration well I've just explained
[16:17] that to see see I'd like to ask you
[16:22] this I'm going to uh when Jesus prayed

[16:32] stand up just a
[16:34] minute you claim to have the baptism
[16:36] Holy Ghost I do too and what is that
[16:39] then I don't claim that I'm have the I
[16:42] have the powers Within Myself to unfold
[16:45] these Mysteries I don't have the power
[16:46] to heal the sick it's God I believe
[16:49] you're a minister if I'm not mistaking
[16:50] you from Arkansas all right now and in
[16:54] you you have is to preach the gospel
[16:56] ordinarily you was raised on a farm and
[16:58] around I catch you just don't know

[17:09] that Holy Ghost dwells within you is
[17:11] that
[17:12] right uh you talk to him speak to him
[17:17] pray to him all right that's all want
[17:19] thank you very much how you get it Jesus
[17:24] I'll ask you
[17:26] one how did it come that when Jesus and
[17:29] John
[17:30] 3 he said when the son of man shall be
[17:33] which now is in
[17:36] heaven see now is in heaven shall it
[17:40] come to Earth see the son of man which
[17:43] now is in heaven and here he stood right
[17:46] here talking to the person
[17:48] amen are you answering me that
[17:51] amen Jesus and the father was the selfs
[17:55] same person just the same as the Holy
[17:58] Spirit in me you're looking to me
[18:00] preaching but it's not me it's not me
[18:03] can speak a word that could bring as you
[18:06] know an animal sit there and look at it
[18:09] and kill the animal and eat
[18:12] it that's creative power that doesn't
[18:15] lay any human being it's not me could
[18:17] take a little boy here lay the doctors
[18:19] lay him on his back with heart trouble
[18:21] the night and say thus saith William

[18:38] the hospital to give it blood and things
[18:40] to even get it here and five minutes
[18:43] time cry for a Hamburg and take it back
[18:45] to the doctor the next day and can't
[18:47] even find a trace of
[18:48] it that's thus say William Brown that's
[18:52] thus sayth the Lord yet he is an
[18:54] individual different from me but the
[18:56] only way he's expressed is through me
[18:59] see that's how Jesus and the father was
[19:01] Jesus said it's not me that doeth the
[19:03] works it's my father that dwelleth in me
[19:06] now the son of man shall ascend from
[19:09] Heaven which now is in heaven see what
[19:13] was it he was omed present because he
[19:15] was God

[23:44] himself through human
[23:46] flesh how we have seen him without one
[23:50] time failing through the years to be
[23:53] able to reveal the very thoughts of the
[23:55] human heart to reveal the sin that
[23:58] they've did tell them exactly what
[24:00] happened and what will be without one
[24:03] time
[24:05] failing and we know that the god of
[24:08] Abraham Isaac and of Israel Still
[24:12] Remains God in the person of Jesus
[24:15] Christ and now by his Spirit descending
[24:19] from Heaven under the blood that was
[24:21] shed at
[24:23] Calvary coming down among people to make
[24:26] his manifested in human flesh just
[24:29] before the burning of the world the
[24:32] great Holy Spirit represented in human
[24:35] flesh those precious people who has
[24:38] accepted the blood atonement and the
[24:41] Holy Spirit takes into their being God
[24:45] represented in human flesh therefore it
[24:47] would not be the human flesh only just
[24:50] to perform the act like in baptism or so
[24:52] forth with a commission that these signs
[24:56] shall follow them that believe by laying
[24:58] hands on the sick the Holy Spirit would
[25:01] see to it that they got well if they had
[25:03] believed now father we know that these
[25:06] things are true these people standing or
[25:08] going to pass under the hands of
[25:11] ministers who has received this Holy
[25:13] Spirit and they're ready Lord to lay
[25:16] hands upon the sick and we know father
[25:19] that if these people are only believe
[25:21] just as every word that you promise is
[25:24] got to happen so it does and it cannot
[25:27] happen with without faith for it is
[25:29] impossible to please God without faith
[25:33] we just can't do it and now with faith
[25:36] believing with this promise laying
[25:38] before us with the seals of the Bible
[25:40] being open to us that God keeps his word
[25:44] may these precious people who are sick
[25:46] Lord and my feeling for them as a human
[25:49] being in a mortal body like theirs and
[25:51] uh there same holy spirit that dwells
[25:54] within us Lord dwells in them and we
[25:56] feel sorry for each other and and
[25:58] knowing that the New Covenant in the new
[26:01] blood if the old one offered healing how
[26:04] much more will this new and better do
[26:06] father may it be so that these people
[26:08] won't fail but will receive their
[26:11] healing as they pass by the hands of thy
[26:14] servant through Jesus Christ's name amen

[1:09:40] with their tongue destroy thou them oh
[1:09:43] God let them fall By Their Own counsels

[1:10:23] you you got something to shout about now
[1:10:27] I've shouted at my kids I've shouted for
[1:10:29] other reasons I've shouted when I caught
[1:10:31] an ice fish but have you ever shouted in
[1:10:34] the presence of the Lord we have
[1:10:36] something to shout about and that is the
[1:10:39] truth I'm not making that up I'm not
[1:10:41] adding anything to that when you think
[1:10:43] about all that he's done for you and all
[1:10:46] that he is
[1:10:48] doing and your future that lays ahead of
[1:10:50] you oh my that's something worthy worthy
[1:10:54] of praising him for amen I'd like to
[1:10:57] direct our attention in the scripture in
[1:11:00] one place of scripture we have several
[1:11:03] but we'll take Hebrews chapter 12 to get
[1:11:06] into our message here this
[1:11:08] morning and again I'm so happy to see
[1:11:11] each of you so nice to see your smiling
[1:11:14] faces there Hebrews chapter 12
[1:11:30] in
[1:11:36] verse number 18 for you're not come unto
[1:11:40] the mount that might be touched and that
[1:11:42] burn with fire nor unto the Blackness
[1:11:45] and darkness and Tempest and the sound
[1:11:48] of the trumpet and the voice of Words
[1:11:50] which voice they that heard in treated
[1:11:53] that the word should not be SP spoken to
[1:11:55] them anymore for they could not endure
[1:11:58] that which was commanded and if so much
[1:12:02] as a beast touch the mountain it shall
[1:12:04] be stoned or thrust through with the
[1:12:06] dart and so terrible was the sight that
[1:12:09] Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake
[1:12:13] but ye are come unto the Mount Zion and
[1:12:17] unto the city of the Living God the
[1:12:20] heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[1:12:24] company of angel angels to the general
[1:12:27] assembly and to the Church of the
[1:12:30] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:12:33] and to God the judge of all and to the
[1:12:36] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[1:12:41] Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant
[1:12:45] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:12:48] speaketh better things than that of Abel
[1:12:53] amen the blood speaketh better things
[1:12:56] may God add a blessing to the reading of
[1:12:57] his word you may be
[1:12:59] seated
[1:13:01] amen so we have been talking about
[1:13:04] healing and the healing of the whole man
[1:13:07] and as you look at a man today as
[1:13:11] brother Brandon brings it those three
[1:13:13] rings and he brings that to us in the
[1:13:17] message um the greatest battle ever
[1:13:20] fought and he says that here just to go
[1:13:24] over it I've read read it several times
[1:13:26] I just trusted it will stick in my heart
[1:13:29] and in your heart too paragraph number
[1:13:31] 72 he says if you'll sit down when you
[1:13:34] get home and draw three little rings
[1:13:37] you'll find out that the outside body
[1:13:39] has five senses that's contacted by and
[1:13:42] that is see taste feel smell and hear
[1:13:44] that's the five senses that control the
[1:13:47] human body inside of that the body is a
[1:13:51] soul and that soul is controlled by
[1:13:53] imaginations con ience memory reasons
[1:13:57] and affections that's the thing that
[1:13:59] controls the soul but the spirit it only
[1:14:03] has one
[1:14:04] sense oh let's get it the spirit has one
[1:14:08] sense and that sense is either dominates
[1:14:11] it either Faith or doubt and there's
[1:14:14] only one Avenue to it that's free moral
[1:14:17] agency you can accept doubt or you can
[1:14:21] accept Faith how many believe that this
[1:14:23] morning you can accept doubt or Faith
[1:14:25] this morning either one you want to work
[1:14:28] on therefore Satan began at the
[1:14:31] principal part to cause a spirit of man
[1:14:34] to doubt God's word god began at the
[1:14:37] principal part to lay his word in that
[1:14:41] Spirit there you are that's what does it
[1:14:45] if this church right now could be put
[1:14:49] together and knitted together with such
[1:14:51] that every person would be in one Accord
[1:14:54] with with not one Shadow of Doubt
[1:14:57] anywhere there would not be a feeble
[1:15:00] person in our midst in another five
[1:15:03] minutes there would not be nobody here
[1:15:06] Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would
[1:15:09] receive it if you can just get that
[1:15:12] certain thing fixed now there is where
[1:15:15] the battle begins right in your mind
[1:15:19] whether you will so powerful tremendous
[1:15:25] the prophet of God brings this
[1:15:27] conscience memory reason affections and
[1:15:30] imaginations man to us and shows us that
[1:15:34] if we can get that all lined up in
[1:15:38] another five minutes there wouldn't be
[1:15:40] you know we come here with different
[1:15:41] things on us we've battled to get here
[1:15:44] we've tired or fought through some of us
[1:15:47] tripped over that or stumbled into this
[1:15:50] and barely made it and you got your mind
[1:15:52] on all kind of other things and Satan
[1:15:55] wants to see to it that your mind is on
[1:15:57] everything but what it's supposed to be
[1:15:59] upon and that's the goodness of the Lord
[1:16:02] and the uplifting of his name and praise
[1:16:06] and thanksgiving and then feeding from
[1:16:09] heaven above he wants you to look around
[1:16:12] you know who's there who's not and so
[1:16:14] all that kind of stuff I want you to get
[1:16:16] that off of your mind for a moment and
[1:16:19] look so much deeper the inner man needs
[1:16:23] to grow and needs to uh come up higher
[1:16:27] into the things of the Lord and his word
[1:16:29] is the only thing that will do that for
[1:16:31] you amen and brother bam says it in the
[1:16:34] message enticing Spirits he's talking
[1:16:37] about putting God first paragraph 45 now
[1:16:41] all things ought to be considered
[1:16:45] prayerfully first seek ye first the
[1:16:48] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:16:50] all these other things will be added I
[1:16:53] am positive sure this morning if men and
[1:16:57] women could only get into the position
[1:17:00] of where their soul their thinking their
[1:17:03] attitude will be perfect in the sight of
[1:17:05] God that would be one of the most
[1:17:08] powerful churches that ever existed can
[1:17:12] you say Amen remember when he's talking
[1:17:14] about churches who is he talking about
[1:17:16] the pews is he talking about it's a
[1:17:19] picture of somebody no he's talking
[1:17:20] about people
[1:17:23] individuals and why not me why not you
[1:17:28] when he's talking about a powerful
[1:17:30] church that ever existed if I can get my
[1:17:33] mind my thinking my attitude in that
[1:17:36] right channel that would be one of the
[1:17:39] most powerful brother Israel's that ever
[1:17:43] existed you got to put your name in
[1:17:45] there and you got to stop waiting for
[1:17:47] other people to say amen and then you
[1:17:49] say Amen you got to find your own Amen
[1:17:52] in the scripture and then run with it
[1:17:56] and God will bless you you can't you're
[1:17:58] not we're not going to highfive one
[1:18:00] another all the way into Glory unless we
[1:18:02] already reading the same
[1:18:04] thing amen and I'm not going to I I
[1:18:06] can't carry two people I'm sometimes
[1:18:10] getting by just by
[1:18:12] myself but if we uh stay with the word
[1:18:15] everything we have need of is right in
[1:18:17] the word and I'm running the race and I
[1:18:19] look over there's a brother God bless
[1:18:21] you there's a sister God bless you too
[1:18:23] but where we headed to we're running in
[1:18:25] a race and if we following one another
[1:18:29] guess what we're you know you might find
[1:18:31] yourself doing things that's not in the
[1:18:33] word of the Lord so we follow him is
[1:18:35] that right and so this Blood speaking
[1:18:39] better better things on uh Thursday
[1:18:43] Wednesday night we have brought to you
[1:18:47] uh the message brother brandham brings
[1:18:50] on the seven compound names of
[1:18:52] redemption and those seven compound Nam
[1:18:54] names were was Jehovah Rafa the Lord who
[1:18:58] heals Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our
[1:19:01] peace Jehovah Rah the Lord is my
[1:19:04] shepherd Jehovah situ the Lord is our
[1:19:07] righteousness Jehovah Gyra the Lord will
[1:19:11] provide Jehovah shama the Lord is
[1:19:14] present or the Lord is there and Jehovah
[1:19:17] ni the Lord is my banner and those are
[1:19:22] what the Lord is but now when that
[1:19:25] becomes what the Lord is to you then he
[1:19:29] becomes my shepherd my peace my
[1:19:33] righteousness my deliverer my banner it
[1:19:37] becomes my confession so not only is it
[1:19:41] seven compound names of redemption we
[1:19:45] can say there's seven Redemptive
[1:19:48] confessions that you can make and that
[1:19:51] will make a difference in your life
[1:19:53] because that's what that's what is to
[1:19:55] you and brother bam goes further and
[1:19:58] tells us what does compound mean that
[1:20:00] means if you get one you get the other
[1:20:03] ones along with it and sometimes we only
[1:20:05] have faith for one but if you get one
[1:20:08] you get the other six too and that is
[1:20:12] really all that you need amen and so
[1:20:16] this uh these seven compound names of
[1:20:19] redemption they speak um and as we think
[1:20:23] of our confession and how powerful that
[1:20:26] means I shared with the church here uh
[1:20:29] some time ago when I first moved here I
[1:20:32] took a class in English and they had us
[1:20:34] to take a paper and write a paper on
[1:20:36] whatever the subject was but I took one
[1:20:38] on healing and how the doctors reports
[1:20:41] and so forth how they prove that if your
[1:20:44] attitude is right to the patient on the
[1:20:47] bad news it tremendously affects the
[1:20:50] outcome to that patient and then I
[1:20:52] started looking further and on what they
[1:20:54] they call the placebo effect on many
[1:20:57] matters on drugs that people would take
[1:20:59] there's nothing in this pill but they
[1:21:01] think there's something in there that
[1:21:03] helps them the doctors have documented
[1:21:06] this this is not you know these are not
[1:21:08] preachers trying to make something up
[1:21:10] this is these are the facts that they
[1:21:12] find that if people think they're being
[1:21:15] healed think something is helping
[1:21:17] helping them it actually helps them amen
[1:21:20] the doctors know this and there was
[1:21:23] actually and I didn't mention this this
[1:21:24] part but there's actually a doctor and I
[1:21:27] think he's in Houston or somewhere he
[1:21:29] does he does Placebo
[1:21:31] surgeries he actually took people under
[1:21:34] the knife open up their knee research it
[1:21:36] for yourself open up this guy's knee
[1:21:39] closed it back up again and didn't do
[1:21:41] anything the patient is sitting there
[1:21:44] watching a a previous surgery take place
[1:21:47] and he believes that this thing is
[1:21:49] helping him now now this is like I said
[1:21:53] these are not snake handlers these are
[1:21:56] not religious people trying to get you
[1:21:57] to join their church this is what the
[1:21:59] doctors this is what science says and it
[1:22:02] is tremendous to think of that without
[1:22:05] one scripture just sitting in a room you
[1:22:08] have allergies take this pill here
[1:22:11] Everybody Take One and it's going to
[1:22:13] help you and some of you all don't even
[1:22:15] know there's nothing in that pill just
[1:22:17] sugar or whatever there's no medication
[1:22:20] in it at all but you think it's going to
[1:22:23] help you and it does help
[1:22:26] you this really opens up a great um
[1:22:31] Avenue to what how powerful the human
[1:22:35] being is the man is in his thinking and
[1:22:38] his thoughts just naturally now this is
[1:22:41] even apart from the scripture this is
[1:22:44] just a man a fallen man a man who
[1:22:49] determines that he wants to get
[1:22:50] something done a goal in his mind it it
[1:22:54] it might not even be it might be just to
[1:22:55] make more money or to be more successful
[1:22:58] if he determines it in his mind him or
[1:23:01] her it is tremendous what a man can do
[1:23:05] that has a madeup mind and what about a
[1:23:08] Believer who has the
[1:23:10] word amen and so we we shared that with
[1:23:14] you and then we played the tape the way
[1:23:16] back part one of it for a Wednesday
[1:23:19] night prayer meeting and we came back
[1:23:21] and prayed the played the second part
[1:23:23] and then brother bham says
[1:23:25] this I want to play this part for you
[1:23:27] it's in the message the way back it's
[1:23:30] about five minutes and and I'll let the
[1:23:33] prophets say this sorry sister I didn't
[1:23:36] give your heads
[1:23:37] up but let me take this next quote as
[1:23:40] they're preparing to get that all
[1:23:43] right
[1:23:44] in this Jehovah Gyra just thinking about
[1:23:48] the compound names brother banon makes
[1:23:50] the statements in several places he says
[1:23:53] they're inseparable
[1:23:55] able they are compound this is the
[1:23:57] argument that Dr that Dr Bosworth used
[1:24:01] on that Baptist intellectual the great
[1:24:04] debate that brother bam didn't want to
[1:24:06] be a part of where this picture was
[1:24:08] taken right here he took his first he
[1:24:10] said I'm G give you my first question Dr
[1:24:13] Beth if you can answer yes or no it'll s
[1:24:17] oh my if it'll settle an argument for an
[1:24:22] unbeliever won't it settle it for you
[1:24:24] you
[1:24:25] too oh God the name Jehovah Gyra the
[1:24:29] seven Redemptive names do they apply to

[1:24:39] all apply to Jesus and how how many of
[1:24:42] you here are saved this morning let me

[1:26:13] here you may be
[1:26:15] [Music]
[1:26:22] seated let me tell you a little
[1:26:23] something speaking at a quanas before
[1:26:26] some
[1:26:27] doctors at a meeting the other day I've
[1:26:29] taken a physical with a famous doctor
[1:26:32] I'm going overseas had a physical
[1:26:34] examination I did this purposely and he
[1:26:37] was let me he did me an upper and lower
[1:26:38] GI natur taking the heart blood and
[1:26:40] everything thank God it was fast so when
[1:26:44] I I drink in this SP meal I just made
[1:26:47] myself real tense and he pressed on my
[1:26:49] stomach looked through the X-ray he said
[1:26:51] brother Brandon I said yes sir he said
[1:26:54] you're stomach feels normally but it
[1:26:56] nothing goes
[1:26:58] out I said it don't I said it's supposed
[1:27:02] to he said yes
[1:27:03] sir he said my I don't understand I said
[1:27:08] um what shall I do he said think of
[1:27:11] something real good to eat I said why
[1:27:13] you want do that PA notice what he's
[1:27:15] going to say and he said a nice big
[1:27:17] juicy steak I said I'll compromise for a
[1:27:19] plate of fried squirrel with pinto beans
[1:27:21] and he said all right start off I
[1:27:24] changed and started thinking he said
[1:27:26] there she
[1:27:27] goes I said' what did that doc he said a
[1:27:30] little electrical wire in your brain
[1:27:32] sent word down to your stomach I said is
[1:27:34] that right then speaking I said you
[1:27:36] remember the little wire I said Doctor
[1:27:39] what makes you dream did you Dre he said
[1:27:42] yes I said what is it a part of you
[1:27:44] that's dreaming he said you're
[1:27:46] subconscious I said a normal human
[1:27:48] here's one conscious and here's a
[1:27:49] subconscious you have to go to sleep to
[1:27:51] get into that conscious he just told me
[1:27:53] he said I found something brother
[1:27:54] Brandon again I can't explain it said
[1:27:57] it's not your nerves he said it's
[1:27:58] something inside of your nerves I said
[1:28:01] my soul he said yes said I it just what
[1:28:03] makes you what you are and I said I
[1:28:07] asked him about Visions he didn't know
[1:28:08] nothing about it so I told him I said
[1:28:10] one conscious is here the other one's
[1:28:11] here you have to get out of this
[1:28:13] conscious let it become darant in order
[1:28:15] to get in here but some part of you went
[1:28:17] somewhere because you can remember
[1:28:19] dreams and places you was at in your
[1:28:21] dreams years and years away so that's
[1:28:23] right
[1:28:25] I said you see that's normal but God so
[1:28:28] sets it to some of us that our first
[1:28:31] conscience and subconscious is right
[1:28:33] together we don't go to sleep God just
[1:28:35] uses it to see things that was and which
[1:28:37] is and shall come that's
[1:28:39] prophetic and he said Mr Brandon I've
[1:28:42] read your books on healing he said I
[1:28:44] certainly agree with you so I'm going to
[1:28:46] tell you said we have absolute cases
[1:28:49] here I can prove it science if there's a
[1:28:51] doctor post can tell you that he said
[1:28:54] said let a person have a malignancy or a
[1:28:56] tuber or an ulcer or something that's
[1:28:59] real bad we know it's going to kill him
[1:29:01] and we'll tell him that and said if he
[1:29:03] gets all tore up flustrated angry upset
[1:29:07] and going on said that patient will die
[1:29:09] right away but so that patient usually
[1:29:11] if he's a Christian or something he
[1:29:13] doesn't mind dying it's just one of the
[1:29:15] things we have to do dying is part of
[1:29:17] living so he just goes ahead and takes
[1:29:20] it on I lift him at times out so almost
[1:29:23] that attitude retires that case said
[1:29:26] he'll Linger on and on and on and on
[1:29:28] before he kills him I said all right
[1:29:31] doctor let me finish my story I said put
[1:29:33] a lie detector on your arm and stand and
[1:29:36] try your best to make a lie sound like
[1:29:37] the truth and watch that needle go
[1:29:39] negative why it's a vibration in your
[1:29:42] nerves you wasn't made to lie you were
[1:29:45] made to tell the
[1:29:47] truth a lie such a horrible thing till
[1:29:49] it interrupts your nerves you ain't made
[1:29:52] to be angry you're supposed to be peace
[1:29:54] like a child with God see you're not
[1:29:57] supposed to be flustrated you're
[1:29:59] supposed to have faith walk with God see
[1:30:04] I said that's it I said now doctor if
[1:30:07] the this man living in his first
[1:30:09] conscience can take the attitude that if
[1:30:11] he dies he's safe so what difference
[1:30:12] does make it'll retire the case for a
[1:30:15] long time what will it do when it drops
[1:30:18] out of that first conscience back into
[1:30:20] the second on the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:22] Ghost it'll take the case completely
[1:30:23] away
[1:30:26] a doctor raised up and said marvelous
[1:30:28] tears run down his cheek I said Doctor
[1:30:30] you know what's the matter I said our
[1:30:32] churches don't teach that he said Mr
[1:30:34] random that's truth I said we need to go
[1:30:36] back to Pentecost he said I'm
[1:30:38] Presbyterian said my wife is
[1:30:40] Presbyterian I said you Jed a
[1:30:42] presbyterian lot she said that's about
[1:30:44] it I said doct a Christian is born again
[1:30:47] you can't go Jour you got to be born he
[1:30:50] said Mr brand that's the truth and tears
[1:30:52] going to run down his cheeks
[1:30:55] we baptizing pretty soon
[1:30:58] now you join a presbyterian Lodge and I
[1:31:01] wonder if if there's any message lodges
[1:31:04] that people join in their mind even
[1:31:08] maybe your church isn't a lodge but
[1:31:09] youve have that large mentality just a
[1:31:12] group just following along just any old
[1:31:14] thing if if this is what can happen in
[1:31:17] the natural what about the baptism of
[1:31:19] the Holy Ghost and an in an innumerable
[1:31:24] number of
[1:31:26] scriptures that support the believer
[1:31:29] that he's already healed and we know the
[1:31:32] real healing is the healing down in our
[1:31:35] soul can I get a witness the real the
[1:31:37] inner man that when that gets healed
[1:31:40] that's what that's what really really
[1:31:44] matters and this this
[1:31:47] starts with basic salvation Romans
[1:31:52] chapter 10
[1:31:54] and sometimes we're so Sanctified and
[1:31:58] revelated on the seals and the Mysteries
[1:32:01] that we miss Romans chapter 10 can we
[1:32:04] turn there quickly just for a moment I
[1:32:06] just thought about this and I want to
[1:32:08] bring this in
[1:32:10] Romans chapter
[1:32:18] 10 every time I pull over it takes me
[1:32:22] out of my time but I'm going to take my
[1:32:24] time and what I get done I'll get done
[1:32:27] if I don't get done then we'll eat eat
[1:32:30] it another time all
[1:32:37] right in verse five Romans 10 Moses
[1:32:40] described the righteousness which is of
[1:32:42] the law that the man which doeth those
[1:32:44] things shall live by them but the
[1:32:47] righteousness which is of faith speaketh
[1:32:50] on this wise say not in thine heart who
[1:32:54] shall Ascend into heaven that is to
[1:32:56] bring Christ down from above or who
[1:32:58] shall descend into the deep that is to
[1:33:01] bring up Christ again from the dead but
[1:33:04] what saith it the word is nigh thee even
[1:33:08] in thy mouth and in thy heart that is
[1:33:11] the word of faith which we
[1:33:14] preach that if thou shall confess with
[1:33:19] thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shal
[1:33:22] believe in thy heart that God had raised
[1:33:25] him from the
[1:33:29] dead what it
[1:33:32] say who shall be
[1:33:34] saved the man that believeth and
[1:33:38] confesses he shall be wait wait wait you
[1:33:41] got to stop doing this wait you got to
[1:33:42] come over here and join wait don't the
[1:33:44] scriptures don't mention none of that
[1:33:45] deal with this first deal with this
[1:33:48] first believe in your heart confess it
[1:33:51] with your mouth and you shall be said
[1:33:54] thank you Jesus thank you Lord that's
[1:33:57] the word I needed to hear all of my life
[1:34:01] just believe on me and then tell me that
[1:34:04] you believe in me and I got you covered
[1:34:07] you shall be saved Hallelujah we
[1:34:10] complicated don't we right and when we
[1:34:13] complicate it it only complicates our
[1:34:18] faith this same scripture is in
[1:34:21] Deuteronomy 30: 11- 14 it says this
[1:34:24] commandment which I command thee this
[1:34:26] day is not hidden from thee neither is
[1:34:29] it far off it is not in heaven that thou
[1:34:31] should say who shall go up for us to
[1:34:34] heaven and to bring it unto us that we
[1:34:36] may hear it and do it neither is it
[1:34:38] beyond the sea that thou should say who
[1:34:40] shall go over the sea for us and bring
[1:34:43] it unto us that we may hear it and do it
[1:34:46] but the word is very nigh unto thee in
[1:34:49] thy mouth and in thy heart that thou
[1:34:52] mayest do it you know because we are
[1:34:55] believers and we believe the whole word
[1:34:58] and I'm talking we I'm talking about
[1:35:00] message people which I call myself a
[1:35:02] message preacher message believer
[1:35:04] whatever you call it I am a Christian
[1:35:07] first right can we can can we say Amen
[1:35:11] everybody okay with that are we
[1:35:13] Christians and the mentality of
[1:35:16] Believers Christians in the message we
[1:35:19] have this All or Nothing
[1:35:22] mentality and so instead of just
[1:35:24] bringing that man right to Romans
[1:35:26] chapter 10 to confess and believe in his
[1:35:28] heart to get that done remember that
[1:35:30] Papa Cox remember that get this part
[1:35:33] done we want to indoctrinate them with
[1:35:37] all the other things that we ain't even
[1:35:40] living fully
[1:35:42] yet and and and really it's confession
[1:35:46] it's speaking it out with your mouth and
[1:35:49] you shall be saved it's just that simple
[1:35:52] and your confession
[1:35:54] will bring other things in your life
[1:35:57] into existence it will settle it in your
[1:36:01] life but your testimony has to remain
[1:36:04] steady constant and positive it has to
[1:36:07] say what the word says you can't
[1:36:09] compromise you got to just stay right
[1:36:11] with that original confession and this
[1:36:14] is where the blood speaks in this
[1:36:17] situation with the squirrel fried
[1:36:19] squirrel and pinto beans that caused his
[1:36:22] blood to speak
[1:36:24] it spoke in his body to get down into
[1:36:27] his digestions and start things to
[1:36:29] moving that's just in the natural the
[1:36:31] blood speaking but here was talking
[1:36:33] about Abel how his blood spoke from the
[1:36:37] grave when his brother Cain took his
[1:36:41] life his blood righteous blood spoke but
[1:36:45] now at Calvary we see the blood speaking
[1:36:48] again through Christ Our Lord our savior
[1:36:53] now this Blood speaking is redemption
[1:36:57] speaking and brother brandom brings
[1:37:00] these seven Redemptive names also
[1:37:04] bringing in the seven Stripes of blood
[1:37:08] that brings Redemption always the
[1:37:10] believer back into fellowship with
[1:37:12] Christ this red heer the hiss up and all
[1:37:16] of the the cedar wood that was the
[1:37:18] things that were brought together and
[1:37:20] they burned his heer and that blood was
[1:37:22] struck uh seven times over the door at
[1:37:25] the Tabernacle Over The Mercy Seat
[1:37:27] speaking of the seven Church ages
[1:37:30] speaking of divine Fellowship you can go
[1:37:34] further and speaking of the Seven
[1:37:36] Virtues the stature of a perfect man
[1:37:39] this God's perfect number it speaks
[1:37:43] those things and if your confession can
[1:37:46] speak that he's Jehovah Rafa he's
[1:37:49] Jehovah Shalom he's Jehovah R the
[1:37:53] Shepherd he's Jehovah your righteousness
[1:37:55] your provider he can also speak that he
[1:37:59] is your faith your virtue your knowledge
[1:38:04] your Temperance your patience your
[1:38:07] godliness brotherly kindness and then
[1:38:09] the Capstone of love that's what what
[1:38:13] our lives ought to be speaking that
[1:38:17] through the seven Church ages the Seven
[1:38:19] Seals the seven Stripes of blood the the
[1:38:23] blood was a type or spoke of the
[1:38:26] Redemption the price that was paid for
[1:38:29] the believer this is why it's not our
[1:38:32] righteousness it's his righteousness
[1:38:35] it's not our Holiness I'm not keeping
[1:38:37] myself but the shepherd is keeping me I
[1:38:40] would have lost my mind like everyone
[1:38:41] else but I got the Prince of Peace in my

[1:49:41] Lord I've claimed them they're mine I'm

[1:49:48] thing we had a good meeting there in in
[1:49:51] in uh Mexico a Preta faithful brother
[1:49:55] Ezekiel and his family took me down and
[1:49:57] Ezekiel interpreted for me very
[1:49:59] faithfully and the brother everything
[1:50:01] was just nice and I took a few moments
[1:50:04] and spoke 30 minutes or so on one
[1:50:07] morning and
[1:50:09] um one of the brothers got up and spoke
[1:50:13] brother Mark and he said something that
[1:50:14] really blessed me he said that I wonder
[1:50:17] when Paul was reing Saul uh for
[1:50:21] afterward Paul wreaking havoc to the
[1:50:23] churches I wonder if there were some
[1:50:25] True Believers actually praying for
[1:50:27] him instead of running from him and
[1:50:32] talking about all the bad that he did I
[1:50:33] wonder if there's a True Believer saying
[1:50:35] Lord save that
[1:50:38] man you see uh uh uh our prayers work
[1:50:42] Saints but you got to pray them for them
[1:50:45] to work you have to speak them for them
[1:50:48] to work and believe that they're going
[1:50:49] to work it is that powerful yes it is
[1:50:54] apply with such love so you speak it and
[1:50:57] you say it with love these are words
[1:51:00] that come out of your mouth now this
[1:51:03] this confession isn't it is naturally
[1:51:07] just taking the word so you just walk up
[1:51:09] you're coming out of wherever you're
[1:51:10] coming from church or denomination or
[1:51:13] the streets and you just come into the
[1:51:14] presence of the word all right you come
[1:51:17] to church you salvation first glance at
[1:51:20] it and someone brings to you the words
[1:51:23] of truth all right and then you read
[1:51:26] those and you start applying them for
[1:51:28] your life you're like man thank you Lord
[1:51:30] I'm saved so glad to be saved I'm GNA
[1:51:33] crawl up in some big church sit on the
[1:51:35] back pew and just be saved all the way
[1:51:37] the glory don't bother me know and
[1:51:39] that's how some are but you got work to
[1:51:42] do
[1:51:43] sis brother sister you got work to do he
[1:51:46] called you for a purpose I mean if that
[1:51:49] was the case everybody that came to the
[1:51:51] Altar and was saved and poof they be
[1:51:54] gone cuz it's it was accomplished you
[1:51:56] got saved now go to Glory no no he saves
[1:52:00] you and he leaves you here to start
[1:52:02] dooking it out and battling out with
[1:52:04] demons and devils and to be a witness in
[1:52:07] your
[1:52:08] neighborhood and and this this is a a
[1:52:13] mental recognition that brings you to
[1:52:15] this now brother bam deals with this
[1:52:17] just a little bit on the power of mental
[1:52:20] faith and have three places 1 2 3 four
[1:52:24] five places that I'm going to read on
[1:52:26] this intellectual faith I think it was
[1:52:29] Tommy Osborn I I sh I was sharing with
[1:52:32] you all or you can read it yourself
[1:52:33] where he came into brother Bron's
[1:52:35] meetings and he saw that maniac and the
[1:52:38] signs wonders and miracles and something
[1:52:40] said voices told him you can do that you
[1:52:42] can do that you can do that and that
[1:52:44] started his ministry he met brother
[1:52:46] brandham brother bam spoke very highly
[1:52:48] of him and he had a tremendous Ministry
[1:52:50] here's what brother bam says in the
[1:52:52] message perfect
[1:52:54] Faith paragraph 35 now you see somebody
[1:52:57] else do something by a work or act of
[1:53:01] God or promise of God and many of them
[1:53:04] say I can do that too it's an
[1:53:07] imagination and when they do you find
[1:53:10] them wrecked up out there somewhere it's
[1:53:13] got to be a substance now that is
[1:53:16] potentially a
[1:53:18] faith that is something that would bring
[1:53:21] you to a faith it's
[1:53:23] potentially like if you ask me for an
[1:53:26] oak tree and I give you an acorn
[1:53:28] potentially you have an oak tree but it
[1:53:31] hasn't produced itself yet so brother
[1:53:33] bam brings in this intellectual Faith he
[1:53:36] he says it leads to a wct out somewhere
[1:53:40] and then he then he brings a balance but
[1:53:42] it potentially is a faith because it got
[1:53:44] to start somewhere and a mental like I
[1:53:47] can do that too yeah I can lay hands on
[1:53:48] the sick too I want to see the dead rais
[1:53:50] how many ever knew Christians thought
[1:53:52] you would see the dead raised how many
[1:53:55] had that faith when you came in sure do
[1:53:57] you still have that
[1:53:59] Faith did God
[1:54:01] backslide no the word is still true but
[1:54:04] we get around people and we start you
[1:54:06] know backing up on it but it's still the
[1:54:08] truth and so it's potentially a faith he
[1:54:12] goes further and he says this paragraph
[1:54:16] 53 and afterwards the disciples asked
[1:54:18] Jesus saying why could not we cure him
[1:54:22] Jesus said because of the lack of faith
[1:54:24] of your unbelief that's right because of
[1:54:26] your unbelief now remember they had the
[1:54:29] power Jesus had given them the power to
[1:54:31] heal the sick raise the Dead cast out
[1:54:33] Devils just a few days before that they
[1:54:36] had the power but not the faith to use
[1:54:39] the power now there's the brandom
[1:54:43] Tabernacle there's the church the bride
[1:54:47] today the holy spirit is here with the
[1:54:50] power but you haven't got the faith to
[1:54:53] move it see what I mean it takes Faith
[1:54:57] to move it so he's talking to his own
[1:54:59] church now huh 1963 his own church right
[1:55:04] it's after the seals can I get a witness
[1:55:06] somebody yes he's talking to the brandom
[1:55:09] Tabernacle he's the pastor him brother
[1:55:10] Neville and he's identified here's the
[1:55:13] brandom Tabernacle so he goes further in
[1:55:16] the message Blasphemous names
[1:55:20] 1962 it says this here
[1:55:23] paragraph 143 the biggest part of our
[1:55:25] faith is mental
[1:55:28] Faith by hearing the word it brings us
[1:55:32] to a mental
[1:55:37] recognition mental recognition of God
[1:55:40] but if this coming from above oh brother
[1:55:42] if it ever strikes this there is a Godly
[1:55:46] spiritual Faith then what does that
[1:55:48] Faith do that Faith recognizes own only
[1:55:52] the word no matter what anything else
[1:55:54] says it only recognizes the word because
[1:55:57] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:55:59] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:56:03] and the word is still God and the Word
[1:56:06] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and
[1:56:09] when the word itself is pouring into our
[1:56:11] faith our mental
[1:56:14] Faith becomes a spiritual
[1:56:18] Revelation so it has to start in the
[1:56:20] intellectual
[1:56:22] by hearing it naturally talking about
[1:56:25] this whole man the whole being you hear
[1:56:27] it intellectually you hear it in your
[1:56:29] mental faith and then it's pouring in
[1:56:33] then your mental Faith becomes a what
[1:56:36] spiritual Revelation can I get a witness
[1:56:40] is that true or
[1:56:41] no absolutely the truth brother random
[1:56:45] is dealing with this mental
[1:56:47] faith in paragraph in
[1:56:50] 1953 he's talking about
[1:56:53] this mental Faith paragraph 73 says this
[1:56:56] why brother it's by faith you're saved
[1:56:59] is that right but listen in accepting of
[1:57:02] your faith God confirms your faith by
[1:57:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you say
[1:57:08] you believe and you don't get the
[1:57:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost then you do
[1:57:12] not it your faith isn't accepted in the
[1:57:16] sight of God you got a mental faith and
[1:57:19] in that and in in instead of the heart
[1:57:21] faith Faith that's right so he separates
[1:57:24] the mental Faith instead of a heart
[1:57:27] Faith but you got to start somewhere you
[1:57:30] start by reading the word you start by
[1:57:32] confessing that word it's on the mental
[1:57:34] you saying it because the Reverend said
[1:57:36] it you're saying because Sunday school
[1:57:38] teacher saying because the tape says it
[1:57:40] say because the Bible says it and it's
[1:57:42] just a mental Faith but you got to start
[1:57:45] somewhere and um I mean you listen to
[1:57:49] the other stuff out there in the world
[1:57:51] it's just on the natural level you got
[1:57:53] to start with the word of God reading
[1:57:55] that and hearing that just on the
[1:57:57] natural level start somewhere brother
[1:58:00] Bam's talking about the mental faith of
[1:58:04] a a fallen Son of God in the
[1:58:09] message let me take this one here
[1:58:12] paragraph 47 in the message Be not
[1:58:15] Afraid here's what he says about a
[1:58:17] mental Faith paragraph 47 he says it is
[1:58:21] true
[1:58:23] that someone might have enough mental
[1:58:25] Faith to raise up out of a wheelchair or
[1:58:29] get up out of a cot or a stretcher but
[1:58:32] when it comes to Discerning a spirit
[1:58:34] perfectly that takes you God that's only
[1:58:38] you the greatest miracle that we seen in
[1:58:41] the ages is that so here brother Bron is
[1:58:44] talking about even with a mental faith
[1:58:47] can pull someone out of the stretcher
[1:58:50] out of a wheelchair
[1:58:52] just with mental faith it kind of goes
[1:58:55] on in this same line in this message the
[1:58:58] Messiah and he says this here paragraph
[1:59:02] number
[1:59:03] 33 a little a little bit above that he
[1:59:06] says there's something about a man he is
[1:59:09] a God he was made to be a god his
[1:59:13] purpose here on Earth was to be a God to
[1:59:16] have a dominion over everything in the
[1:59:18] earth oh my now don't let that stagger
[1:59:22] you CU I got some more scriptures wrote
[1:59:24] down here see here the other night I saw
[1:59:27] a telecast of a man with psychic mental
[1:59:31] Faith set a glass of water he stood back
[1:59:35] oh we didn't get it
[1:59:37] yet so I want you to hear this one
[1:59:40] paragraph 33 in the message Messiah I
[1:59:43] want you to read it
[1:59:46] rather and here the other night I saw a
[1:59:49] telecast thank you of a man with psychic
[1:59:52] mental Faith set a glass of water and
[1:59:55] stood back and kept concentrating on
[1:59:58] that glass of water till it bursted it
[2:00:02] just by concentration watching that
[2:00:05] glass of water and the glass cracked and
[2:00:08] the water run out just pure mental
[2:00:13] consecration why that's his fibers
[2:00:17] that's his makeup if he can do that got
[2:00:20] a power in him by mental thinking that
[2:00:24] can break a glass of water and him being
[2:00:26] a sinner that shows that there was
[2:00:29] something made in that man he's a fallen
[2:00:32] Fallen perverted condition but if that
[2:00:35] man can only get back to God and let God
[2:00:39] get into him why with that power turned
[2:00:42] loose of the kingdom of God he didn't
[2:00:46] have no conductor he was like a shotgun
[2:00:48] he just splattered everywhere but if
[2:00:51] that spirit that's in a man can be
[2:00:54] converted and put Christ in there where
[2:00:56] he's got a conductor a conductor is a
[2:00:59] wire that conducts it amen and let a man
[2:01:04] with the same faith in the conductor of
[2:01:07] the word of
[2:01:09] God he can raise the
[2:01:11] dead cleanse the lepers cast out Devils
[2:01:17] amen he's fashioned like a god he looks
[2:01:20] like God sure what was that's the reason
[2:01:23] God was man man was God and this is his
[2:01:26] offspring man he's only trying to get a
[2:01:30] hold of a man trying to get man into his
[2:01:34] hand now this is what brother Bram said
[2:01:37] you believe it or not it's up to
[2:01:40] you it's up to you but he brings this
[2:01:43] man that mental concentration can burst
[2:01:46] a glass or just concentrating on it a
[2:01:49] sinner now not not the blood not the
[2:01:53] Holy Ghost just the man Fallen man what
[2:01:57] about a man that is filled with the Holy
[2:02:00] Ghost what about a daughter of God that
[2:02:02] would take God at his word what about
[2:02:04] you what about me what about taking God
[2:02:08] at his word all things are possible to
[2:02:13] them that
[2:02:14] believe
[2:02:17] amen yes he goes further that man is the
[2:02:22] Messiah it's a powerful message Go Get
[2:02:23] It Go Get It what message was that the
[2:02:26] Messiah 1961 0117 go listen to that
[2:02:32] amen it's free you can go listen to
[2:02:37] it all right now how do we how do we
[2:02:40] apply this these seven stripes or these
[2:02:43] seven compound confessions how do we
[2:02:46] apply the blood that speaks better
[2:02:49] things you know we speak many things
[2:02:53] that we shouldn't speak but the blood
[2:02:56] speaks and the word of God
[2:03:00] speaks and when it speaks it speaks
[2:03:03] better things and so brother bam shows
[2:03:07] us how to take this
[2:03:11] natural um confession of the word you
[2:03:13] walk up to the promise you just come up
[2:03:15] to it sent her off the streets believer
[2:03:18] in the church preacher whoever you come
[2:03:21] up to the word you read the quote and
[2:03:23] it's just a quote it's just a scripture
[2:03:25] and then how do you apply that well you
[2:03:27] read it you say well I believe it okay
[2:03:29] and that's a good start you believe it
[2:03:31] because it's the word of God that
[2:03:32] doesn't mean it's Anchored In My Heart
[2:03:34] yet I got all kind of stuff I need to
[2:03:37] channels that need to be cleared out and
[2:03:39] cleansed up and this is where your level
[2:03:42] of repentance will
[2:03:44] change this is where the sincerity of
[2:03:46] your repentance will get deeper where as
[2:03:49] you're clearing out these channels that
[2:03:50] we're talking about does don't have
[2:03:51] nothing to to do with nobody else or the
[2:03:53] other group this is between you and God
[2:03:56] you and the heavenly father and that's
[2:04:00] I'm sure um uh many of us has repented
[2:04:03] the wrong way or not thoroughly and we
[2:04:06] haven't kept our hearts and channels
[2:04:08] cleansed from
[2:04:10] unbelief but the word of God gives us
[2:04:13] the answer and we have examples and
[2:04:16] examples and examples and here brother
[2:04:18] bam shows us how to do it for the next
[2:04:20] 10 minutes with will let him do that for
[2:04:22] us all right and the message accept
[2:04:26] God's
[2:04:29] Gift one two three quotations all right
[2:04:33] can you say amen for that
[2:04:35] long well if you say Amen it's only
[2:04:38] helping you
[2:04:40] right it's good for you make it better
[2:04:42] you you'll feel
[2:04:46] better should I keep
[2:04:50] going sir
[2:04:57] all
[2:04:58] right you all are the precious most
[2:05:01] precious people in the world God bless
[2:05:03] you let me read these three quotes for
[2:05:05] you because it it really helped me to
[2:05:08] look at this and to grab a hold of this
[2:05:10] and I believe it'll help you too the
[2:05:12] message accept God's Gift he says this
[2:05:15] here
[2:05:21] I remember one day paragraph 7 I
[2:05:23] remember one day I looked upon there and
[2:05:25] I saw what he done for me I crawled
[2:05:27] humbly to him there laid my name on top
[2:05:30] of a book and oh what was written under
[2:05:34] it said Lord will you forgive me and
[2:05:38] seemingly he took his hands dipped into
[2:05:41] his side and said yes and he wrote
[2:05:44] across that book pardon closed it up put
[2:05:48] it back in the sea of forget
[2:05:50] forgetfulness I've been happy ever since
[2:05:54] I'm trying my best in my humble way to
[2:05:56] tell every Mortal on Earth Jesus Christ
[2:05:59] loves you and he's the only thing that's
[2:06:02] holding the wrath of God off of you
[2:06:05] receive him as your personal Savior and
[2:06:09] when you've done that now he also was
[2:06:12] stripped on his back with stripes we are
[2:06:15] healed we were healed not we will be we
[2:06:19] have already been healed every person
[2:06:22] has been healed and now the only thing
[2:06:25] you have to do is to believe that first
[2:06:27] in your heart before you can say it if
[2:06:30] you're just saying it from your lips it
[2:06:33] won't do you any good Hallelujah this
[2:06:35] isn't a shallow ofay it's it isn't
[2:06:38] something that's just I heard someone
[2:06:40] say last evening on the broadcast every
[2:06:43] person that believes has been filled
[2:06:45] with the Holy Spirit now I'm not
[2:06:47] disagreeing with the minister but he's
[2:06:50] probably didn't understand understand
[2:06:52] the scripture Paul in Acts 19th Chapter
[2:06:55] asked those Baptist people up there have
[2:06:59] had they receive the Holy Ghost since
[2:07:00] they believe now not when you believe
[2:07:04] the holy spirit is a gift of God after
[2:07:06] you believe it's God's gift to you for
[2:07:10] believing but you can believe Jesus
[2:07:12] being the Son of God and accept him as
[2:07:14] your personal Savior and still not have
[2:07:18] the Holy Spirit The Gift of the Holy
[2:07:21] Spirit is God's personal gift to the
[2:07:24] believer you're saved because you
[2:07:26] believe but you're filled with the Holy
[2:07:28] Ghost when God's personal gift comes
[2:07:31] upon you which is the holy spirit now
[2:07:34] see it's not a shallow Affair it's
[2:07:37] something deep we're not babies anymore
[2:07:40] we're men and women the church should be
[2:07:43] in that condition tonight not shallow
[2:07:46] but deep in God not now healing is not
[2:07:51] something you just say well yeah I
[2:07:54] believe it I believe it now that's all
[2:07:56] right if that's the best you can do just
[2:07:59] mentally or just say well yes I see it I
[2:08:03] believe that I accept it then if you
[2:08:06] accept it on those bases keep saying it
[2:08:10] over and over say it out loud say it
[2:08:15] over and over just keep saying I'm
[2:08:18] Healed I'm Healed say it till actually
[2:08:22] you believe it and when you believe it
[2:08:26] then something's going to take place now
[2:08:29] that's beautiful right there that is
[2:08:31] lovely because you can grasp that you
[2:08:35] just say it cuz of word he just keeps
[2:08:37] saying it keep saying it five years 10
[2:08:39] years rest of your life keep saying it
[2:08:43] and then something will take place
[2:08:45] you'll actually believe
[2:08:47] it I mean we repeat a lot of things over
[2:08:50] and over again again just negative stuff
[2:08:52] all the time contrary you got to say
[2:08:55] something why don't you say what the
[2:08:57] word of God
[2:08:58] says and then say it
[2:09:00] again and again and again keep saying it
[2:09:03] I keep saying it until actually you
[2:09:06] believe it's something to take place
[2:09:08] don't have a negative
[2:09:10] testimony every time you confess well I
[2:09:13] still feel bad today I guess you go
[2:09:16] right straight back in the same rut that
[2:09:18] you was in the beginning there's not man
[2:09:21] or woman in here that is baptized with
[2:09:24] the Holy Spirit but what would start
[2:09:26] your confession I believe I lost the
[2:09:28] Holy Spirit I believe it's gone from me
[2:09:31] I believe you'll go right down you'll
[2:09:33] never listen close you'll never live
[2:09:37] above your
[2:09:39] confession Jesus is the high priest of
[2:09:43] our confession is that right Hebrews 3:1
[2:09:47] any Scholars knows that same word
[2:09:50] profession is
[2:09:52] confession amen we take one more come
[2:09:55] let us reason together 1955 the prophet
[2:09:57] of God says
[2:09:59] this paragraph 79 says see friends it
[2:10:04] isn't
[2:10:05] intellectual it has to come from down
[2:10:07] here that's right something has to
[2:10:10] happen here God bless you may it happen
[2:10:14] down there tonight May the true and
[2:10:17] living God who's here get out of your
[2:10:20] mind and and get into your heart say oh
[2:10:25] Jesus yes it's reasonable if you're here
[2:10:28] and can make these others be well you
[2:10:31] can make me well too and I now accept it
[2:10:34] and just keep saying it into keep saying
[2:10:38] it into your heart till after a while
[2:10:41] something anchors down there and you
[2:10:44] know you're healed just as well as you
[2:10:46] know that shirt's white it's over then
[2:10:50] that's
[2:10:51] right you'll raise over to your neighbor
[2:10:53] and say something happened yes sir it'll
[2:10:56] be over that's right so we keep saying
[2:10:58] it until something
[2:11:00] happens we keep saying it till we
[2:11:02] actually believe it but we say it how
[2:11:05] many times over and over that's healing
[2:11:07] over and over and over you confess your
[2:11:10] salvation the same way I'm saved by
[2:11:11] God's grace thank God I'm saved I'm born
[2:11:14] again Christians yeah we was on the boat
[2:11:16] one time my friend fishing a couple
[2:11:18] years back the guy offered us some I
[2:11:21] guess extra bait worms or whatever at
[2:11:23] the end of the day and we took them
[2:11:25] great he says you guys want a couple of
[2:11:27] beers he says no and he looked at us and
[2:11:31] my fishing partner says we're born
[2:11:33] again and that settled it and I just L
[2:11:36] that I always remember yeah just tell
[2:11:38] them you're born again no and so that's
[2:11:41] what we confess for the rest of our life
[2:11:43] is that right we just keep saying it can
[2:11:45] I read one more sir and then I'll close
[2:11:49] Okay the message is why
[2:11:52] 1961 he
[2:11:56] says paragraph
[2:11:58] 82 that's the same thing with Divine
[2:12:01] Healing I see people get all worked
