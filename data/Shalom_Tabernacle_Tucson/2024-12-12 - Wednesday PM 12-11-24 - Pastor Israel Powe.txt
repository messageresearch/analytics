9th Isaiah says seek ye the the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord I'm so glad that his ways are not my ways and his thoughts are not my thoughts for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than yours and my thoughts than your thoughts amen and over in Romans the 11th chapter Romans the 11th chapter we'll begin reading at the 33rd verse and read down through the 36th oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways

are all things to whom be glory forever amen amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we're grateful tonight Lord that we serve a higher

just pray oh God tonight you would Lord meet with us and father as I speak for the next few minutes Lord I pray you'd watch over me and bind my lips before I speak anything unpleasing to you we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated title of the message tonight is believing is seeing amen and uh you know we just uh we lost a real soldier in the gospel in our brother Wesco here a few weeks ago and like it is many times I know maybe we didn't I know I didn't appreciate him as much as I should have while he was here with us and remember when we got the news that brother Wesco had passed I was looking at YouTube and looking up some old brother Wesco videos and one of the things he said that struck me was he said the world says sin is believing but the believer says believing is sin and I just thought wow what a profound statement that was that for us believing is sin we uh we look for those things that cannot be seen but yet are still the truth and so I I like that I like to listen to people that know what they're talking about can you say Amen to that tonight I I want to take Financial advice brother brother brother Israel I want to take Financial advice from people that's got a lot of money I don't want I don't want some broke guy giving me Financial advice I I want to talk to somebody that knows what they talking about and I like to take business advice from people that's been successful in business business I remember uh last year I went to a little leadership conference in Atlanta and the man that got up there who spoke uh was a man that had went to college on a debate scholarship and he had uh had done so well with that that actually Ronald Reagan put him on his cabinet he he went to work for the White House and was on Ronald Reagan's cabinet and then when he got done with that he started four or five businesses and sold them all off and was very successful and and so when this man t I I'd listened to what he had to say because he had the proof was in the pudding so to speak and and uh uh then the next time I went to a leadership conference they had a guy there that his claim to fame was he'd worked for Hard Rock Cafe for 15 years and and uh he come in and pretty much just told us what Hard Rock Cafe did and uh I didn't listen to him he hadn't done anything all he did was work for somebody else and told me what they told him and I want a motivational speaker to be somebody that's a something brother John I I want a motivational speaker to be somebody that's motivated thems you see what I'm saying Saints and I I want Fitness advice from somebody that's in shape I I don't like it when the I don't like it when the Surgeon General looks like they're going to pass out with a heart attack I I want I want some I want them to look healthy if they're going if they're going to be responsible for other people's health I think they should look healthy don't you I want to talk to somebody that knows what they're talking about tonight Saints I I I I I want to take marital advice from somebody who's got a great marriage all right somebody knows what they're doing somebody knows what they're talking about and that's why I believe this message today because it's not just words on a paper it actually produced the life in the sheath offering that he was talking about and and not only did it produce a life in William brandom but I I found that when you did what William brandham said it produced the same life in me amen I I I like that and the Bible said not to be just hearers of the word but to be doers of the word and I don't want to just hear a book somebody wrote about the gospel I want to see somebody that demonstrates the gospel I want to see somebody that that does what the gospel says do and not only did what he say come to pass in his own Ministry but what he said come to pass in my own life when I did it amen can you say Amen to that tonight am and not only my life but in anyone's life when you when you meet the qualifications that's located in the word you get the same outcome right amen when I did what he said I got the results he promised that I'd get come on somebody tonight when when I did what the Bible said when I did what the message said I got the results that the word said I would get amen it wasn't just somebody writing a book about God it wasn't just somebody's ideas about God it was somebody who lived the life of God and I can stand with a man like that amen now I want you to notice I'm going to pull over here just for a second and a little something I talked about last Thursday in Mesa but in 1st Samuel the 8th chapter uh it was and we won't turn there for time sake tonight but we find in the 1st Samuel the 8th chapter that all the Elders of Israel called together all the people and they said unto Samuel they told him we want uh a king to reign over us they said you're too old and your sons they don't follow in your footsteps and they're they're not doing right and they're not behaving right and you're too old and all the other kings have got all the other nations have got a king and we want a king also and and Samuel asked him have I ever begged you for money or have I ever you know asked for your flocks have I ever taken your kids captive and used them for my own have I ever done any of those things they said no but we want a king anyhow and and and God said go ahead s and let them have it don't be upset they haven't rejected you they've rejected me he said they haven't rejected you but they've rejected me can I get a little bit more volume on the speaker up here please and so God said let them have what they're asking you for but you tell them how it's going to be when they do it and so Samuel told him he said I'm going to do do it we're going to give you a king but just know that he's going to take your flocks he's going to take your herds he's going to take your Vineyards he's going to take your corn he's going to take your children he's going to take your sons and daughters and he's going to use them for his servants and his Warriors He's going to take all your money he's going to take everything you got he's going to take your freedom and they and and it's going to happen and and they say well we want a king anyhow cuz we're going to be just like everybody else is see the people had the best thing that they could get they had Vindicated Prophet with thus sayith the Lord they had the word of God for their day and everything that he had told them had come to pass everything that he had promised had come to pass and he didn't take any of their stuff he didn't take any of their crops he didn't take any of their freedom but because of the pressure to be like everybody else they wanted a king anyways well saints were not like everybody else we're a royal people A A peculiar people is that right Saints we don't have to fit in with what everybody else is doing we don't have to run our church the way everybody else runs it we don't have to have all these programs that everybody else has amen but we got to go the way God leads us amen but they'd rather be like everybody else than to be free Saints they'd rather F fit in than to have their crops and to have their lands and to have their children they'd rather desire to be like everybody else than they turned their back on God when they did it now brother BR says this in rejected King he said and there has never been it has never never been the will of God it never was the will of God or never will be the will of God for a man to rule over one another God rules over man God is our ruler our King is that right now notice when they walked away from the message of their day they thought that Samuel was all washed up they thought he was too old to do them any good and they thought his sons wasn't doing right and they couldn't take his place and Samuel uh he got old and and they didn't think he was he was uh good enough anymore and they started looking around at what everybody else is doing and if you follow the present stage of my Ministry brother brand talks about how Demus did the same thing to Paul and we find out that brother Bram was typing into his own Ministry where they thought he was washed up and they thought that the Lord wasn't dealing with him anymore and they thought because he had lost some of his popularity that God wasn't with him anymore but it was just the word being Vindicated they did it to Jesus they did it to Paul they did it to brother brandom man when Jesus was feeding the 5,000 the Loaves and the fishes he had all kind of people following him but when he gave them the word they walked away is that right Amen brother Brown says this he said men try to seek honor from one another he says and and they honor one another and they dishonor God by doing so he said we try to make big people among us and we're no big people and little people we all little people can you say Amen tonight Saints there's no big people no little people we're all little true all right there's only one big among us and that's our Lord now is this right tonight Saints and we see that somewhat happening in the message today there is no reason there was no reason for those people to doubt Samuel everything he said had come to pass everything God had done through him had come to pass exactly the way God said it there was no reason he hadn't taken anything from him he hadn't done anything bad there was no reason for him to doubt Samuel even though Samuel's Sons weren't doing right and they weren't walking in his ways it it was it wasn't the people's job to correct that it was God's job to correct that but because of the pressure to be like everybody else the people uh they they wanted this King anyway it was God's job God had a plan for those people God had a way that he was going to to do God had something for them but they wanted to get ahead of God and it cost them and we find that they blamed it on Samuel being old and they blamed it on his sons not walking in his ways but actually they were just doing what they really wanted to do anyway and that was just as good an excuse as anything else and we find it in churches many times where something will rise up and people want to do something there's somebody they want to start another church anyways and they're just looking for an excuse something to rise up that they can use as an excuse to do what they already wanted to do anyway that's true and rather than letting the Lord work it all out let the Lord take care of it they try to get ahead of God and go do something out on their own now is this right tonight Saints and in this message we find this there is no reason for us to doubt anything that that Prophet said there's no reason everything he said Has Come come to pass exactly the way he said it so we got no reason to doubt any of the rest of it everything he said happened exactly the way he said it would happen and he didn't beg us for money he he didn't he didn't live one way in front of us and another way in front of everybody else he was he was the same man all the time he he didn't run some kind of a halfway program Saints he he didn't beg for money he didn't have these big programs to support he didn't put these big doctrines and stuff that we can't keep up with on us is that right tonight Saints we're not preaching our own message tonight Saints we're preaching the message of William brand and we don't do anything and we don't push ourself up by pushing brother brandom down see God gave us thus sayith the Lord he gave us a sure word of Prophecy and we don't find anywhere where what that Prophet said failed and we don't find it Saints it's just not there it wasn't a dictator that required everybody does everything the same way he said each church is Sovereign and is that what the prophet said amen but when he went off the scene always man has to have something that they can look at instead of taking God at his word brother R said that man wants somebody that can do their religion for him rejected King he said now that's the kind of man that the people like to choose today the people does not seem to be satisfied with the way that God has placed his church to be governed and controlled by the Holy Spirit okay they wanted somebody some man some denomination some certain people to govern the church and that they'll not be able to throw themselves completely into God's hand to be spiritual and to be led by the Holy Spirit Saints we don't want to be that church tonight we want to be thrown into the hands of God helplessly dependent on the leadership of the Holy Spirit tonight he said they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that'll tell them just how to do it and all about it so this man seemed to suit the place exactly because he was a very intellectual man and it's a whole lot like today why we choose such people to control our churches to control the Church of God nothing that I have to say against it but just merely to make a point that it's not it is not it was not and it will never be the will of God for such to be God is to rule his people people to govern each individual and Saints what we see today is too many people repeating what other people say and not what brother brandom said and they'll hear one big name preacher say it and they say well he said it so that must be true and they never check the message for themselves true and so what you find is people just repeating the same thing they heard somebody else say but we're responsible as individuals to check it by the word tonight now see this message that We Got Tonight this wasn't somebody just had some good ideas it wasn't just a book of theology a book of theology doesn't produce what this message produced amen this was the Living Word made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen this message is the message that will turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the original fathers and it's not just someone writing a book about it amen it's a manifestation of the word of God in this last day he said it would happen and it happened he promised that it would happen and it's happened just like he said and so we read it in the Bible and then we see it lived Out Among Us we see it manifested among us and that's got to be our goal tonight Saints is to read it in the Bible and then see it manifested amen this was a man that could make God alive before the people amen is that what you want your life to be amen somebody that can see the Living God in you that the sinner can see the Living God in you that the unbeliever can see the Living God in you that the church member can see the Living God in you that's my desire tonight Saint not just somebody writing a book brother said hear you him he said someone came to me a Lutheran College not long ago and they said they want to accept the Holy Ghost he said 400 and something in this Lutheran college has already got the Holy Ghost and they said brother brandom we heard all about the gifts and we went to someone that wrote a book and he said I hadn't got any of those we just wrote about them he said sure you can write about them but are they real he said sure there're is real as God is real it's his word amen that's what we want tonight say it's not somebody writes about it not even somebody can read it in the message but we want to live it tonight Saints not hearers of the word but doers of the word So for anybody that feels like they got the authority to tell tear down this messenger I would just ask you this where's your Pillar of Fire at cuz I I know where his was where where's your worldwide Healing Ministry H how many Pentecostal Giants got their start under your ministry cuz I know how many got their start under brother rand's Ministry H H how many of your visions came to pass cuz I know how many of his came to pass all of them saints and there were thousands of them how many world rde revivals were you the Catalyst for cuz I know how many he started so I'll take the words of the seventh Church age messenger over the words of a newspaper reporter any day of the week I'll take it over a backsliding preacher words I'll take it over Google's words I'll take brother bram's opinion over anybody else's facts I'll even take his ideas over my ideas oh come on somebody tonight over my own ideas that's Our obligation to the word oh I think this right here but when I read it in the word I got to say what the word says glory to God tonight say come on somebody so I'm saying all of this to drive home one point tonight that there's somebody out there right that knows more than we do there's somebody out there that knows what's around the corner there's somebody whose ways are higher than my ways there's somebody out there that that knows the end from the beginning now I don't know the end from the beginning you don't know the end from the beginning but I know who knows the end from the beginning there's somebody out there that knows the exact message that we would need for this day do y'all believe that do y' believe the Lord knew what day we'd be living in today and and and he knew the the challenges that we'd be facing he knew the trials we'd be up against he knew the Devils that'd be in the land today he knew how corrupt everything would be today he knew all of it and he provided us a message to combat that now is that what the Bible said when an enemy comes in like a flood he said I'll raise up a standard against them this is the standard Saints amen amen so the message is enough amen thank you Jesus he knows what it'll take for you and I to be an overcomer in this day he knows what it'll take and provided that for us amen and that person is our Lord Jesus Christ he sees what we can't see he knows what we don't know his ways are higher than our ways his mind is higher than our mind his thoughts oh God are higher than our thoughts and we don't have to see to believe we can just believe to see is that right Saints see there was Falls at the end of the river and we're all going down the same boat we're all going down the same river and there's Falls at the end and we not might not be able to see the Falls but the Lord let us know about the falls and we believe what the Lord says so even though we can't see them we believe and by faith we can't see amen you know you don't have to touch the stove to know that it's hot you can take somebody else's word for that now is that right Saints the Lord knows what's around to been we might not see the trouble that we're going into we might not know the trouble that our family's headed into we might not know the trouble that our church is fixing to go into we might not know those things but there is somebody that does we don't have to know everything going on in the world today but we believe so by faith we can see where we're headed we don't know all the problems that we're going to come up against in our lives I don't know what kind of problems I'm going to fight tomorrow I don't know what kind of problems you're going to fight tomorrow amen I don't know what the future holds but I know who holds the future it's like the man that couldn't understand Divine Healing Hebrews chapter 6 brother Bram said he couldn't understand Divine Healing he said but he had a lantern in his hand and he said I want to say something preacher I just can't accept that cuz I can't see it come on somebody he said you can't he said he said you can't see it he said no said I'm a sick man myself but I just can't see it and I said where do you live and he said back over on big renox and I said well how you going to get home and he said well I'm going to walk home I said can you see your home he said no sir and I said' awful dark tonight it's cloudy he saides and I said how you going to get home and he said byy this Lantern and I said that Lantern doesn't show light all the way to your house I said how do you go he says oh I walk by the lantern I said that's it you got a he said you got the light of the lantern now and every time you step this way the light will keep showing on ahead of you and he said if you just keep walking the light will keep going with you oh glory to God tonight Saints amen he said you he said and you do that this morning you want Christ the great high priest the intercessor for your sickness or your diseases or your soul you might not understand it we don't but we're commanded to walk in the light as he is in the light and you make one step in the light and then when you got the light with you the light will shine unto the perfect day it'll keep the path before you brother Brown said oh Saints we got a lantern in the church he said if you just keep walking the light will keep going with you but you got to keep walking amen we don't know what the trouble is we don't know what we're going to fight against but we got to keep walking and if we keep walking the light will keep going with us and every step you take the light will take a step with you thank you Lord amen and I don't know everything I got to go to before I get home but I know home is there and I know the light will lead the way yes we just follow the light that we got Saints fear not we might have it all figured out but I'm so glad that God has a special position yes I'm so glad that he elevates some to a higher level that can see further talked about the eagle he he had wings he could go higher but then he said it wouldn't be no good if you had wings and go high but you couldn't see once you got up there and he said that eagle he had the wings he could go high but then when he got up there he can see far off amen is that the prophet we had in this day amen his job was to go up and see and come back and bring his word of what he saw amen oh my and I might not be called to go up high and see like that but I am called to believe it and by believing it I can see it yes thank you Lord amen I'm so glad saints that God sent a prophet yes that'll help me see what I can't see oh my that'll help me understand things that my mind can't understand amen that way I'm not shocked when things happen cuz I know because something saw it before me and told me it come to pass I'm not shocked by what I see in the world today he said it would happen is that right Saints we know these things are going to happen we know it's going to get worse in this world I'm so glad that God uses these offices amen amen it's not just a prophit though amen God has other offices that he uses I was look at this Revelation book of symbols let's let's read here what brother Brown said nowbody Say Amen to the word or do we not Revelation book assembl brother said your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church pastor I already got an amen from you on that he said a messenger to the church he said therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay with but but stay straight with the word because he's feeding the shepherd's place oh my are you thankful tonight Saints amen cuz the word pastor means Shepherd look it up and find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer of a certain flock to feed them with what the word of God Amen and God puts men in certain places to help see what we can't see do y' believe that tonight Saints amen there be sometimes maybe you don't understand what's being said maybe you don't understand why it's being said but it's something that the church needs to be preparing for so even though we might not be able to see it God uses men yes what it takes to overcome or overcome our belief excuse me what it takes to overcome all belief our faith boy that's a title isn't it what it takes to overcome all belief all unbelief or faith brother BR say this first is Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors those five god-given gifts in the church so each one of you who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God in your church now is that what the word said is that what a prophet taught he said a Shepherd pastor means a Shepherd to watch over the flock to teach them the word of God he said then there's these other nine different spiritual gifts that should be operating in the church to keep the church clean like the ananas and safaris and so forth the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out and tell them that they're living wrong and rebuke that sin openly and that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord amen now Saints if it's to keep the church clean we want to be clean if it's to keep the church ready for the coming of the lord we want to be ready for the coming of the Lord yes sir he says we believe that now then there are these other gifts that comes into the church now after the pastor there is evangelist comes in and then there's teachers comes in and then there's prophets that comes in and then there's a Apostles that comes in all these together working together with the gifts to keep the church perfected amen and clean and ready for the coming of the Lord the Saints you might not agree with that but it wasn't me that said that so even though we might not be able to see go God uses different offices different gifts different manifestations to warn us that there's Falls ahead on the river he he anoints his servants to tell us of things to come he's he's telling of things to come and we not we might not be able to see it ourselves but we can believe it and by believeing we can see amen one last thing that God uses and I'm G I'm going close for the night but one last thing God uses to help us to see what we can't see if you'll turn women your Bibles to St John the 16th chapter y'all love the Lord tonight I'm thankful for these things Sint amen I that means I ain't got to have all the answers and I ain't got to have it all figured out I can just take a step and see what the light leads me to and I can take another step and see how the light leads me amen St John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you in all Truth for he'll not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen and he shall not glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you and all things that the father have in mine therefore said I he shall take of mine and show it unto you Saints he will show us things to come do you believe that tonight God gives us his own life his own Spirit to lead and guide the believer and the spirit will show you things to come it'll check us when we need to be checked it'll stop us when we need to be stopped if we're sincere if if we're sincere and we sincerely want to know the will of the Lord and we sincerely want God's Direction it is the lamp that we hold that lights our path some things can appear good on the outside but on the inside you know it ain't right it looks good it sounds good but something about it checks you oh thank God for it Saints it's the Holy Spirit showing you things to come it'll guide us when we don't understand there I say it'll make you do things you don't understand there'll be things that sound good but you know they're wrong they just feel wrong we might not can see it but we can believe it am amen now in closing I just say this and the musicians you can go ahead and come let's see what time I got 36 minutes Pastor some kind of new record present stage of my Ministry brother BR says this now see Saints we we can't see all this with our natural eyes we we we don't know everything that the future holds but we live by faith amen amen and we believe sir amen pres stage of my minist he said here some time ago I was explaining it I was looking at a television picture just uh sister Joy just something on your heart I was looking at a television picture where they let a man down I think two miles or a mile deep in the ocean and they had Ray lights that went out and they was showing marine life and there come fish by that horrible looking creatures he said that it's it's midnight ink black down there and they had uh phosphorus on their nose and they had no eyes and now they have to be fed so it looked like to find their food they were guided with another sense not sight because they didn't have eyes couldn't use them down there but they were guided with another sense that they could contact to food and I thought if I could have control of that little fish with my sight how much greater could I Supply his food and lead him places he said how much greater my sight is than his radar that he contacts see and I thought if I could just lead him then it come to me if I could only surrender myself to God how much greater is the sight and senses of God who could guide us much more than our eyes then if that little fishy could never come up to the top of the water like other fish because he's pressurized you bring him up he would explode no more than we can go up higher and keep from exploding we are pressurized for the place that we live but now if that little fishy if that little fish could ever come up here and be me would he ever want to be that little fish again down in the midnight Blackness he'd never want to be a fish no more because he's something greater than a fish he's a man his senses are greater his understanding is greater his intelligence is supreme then multiply that by 10 million and then you get what it is when you pass from this into the presence of God Yonder where the human being is so much farther than what what we are here you never want to be a human being like this no more down in this pest House of sickness and Corruption it's been that in my heart that I've tried these 30 years to preach the gospel around the world to tell people that there is a heaven to gain and there's a hell to shun and there's a God that loves you and a redeeming power that's laying ready to pick you up at any time that you're ready to receive it oh I'm ready to receive it tonight sints I want to be led the way brother Bram talked about if he had the ability with his eyesight to lead that little fish multiply that times 10 million that's how God can lead us can we bow our heads Lord Jesus oh God we're so
