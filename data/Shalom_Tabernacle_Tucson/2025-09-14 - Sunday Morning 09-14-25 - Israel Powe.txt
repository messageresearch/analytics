TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] Morning everyone. All stand. We'll open up in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're grateful for the privilege of being here today. Thank you for all your blessings and Father, as we hear the preaching of your word, we we know it's faithful and true. Father, may we all receive you in a greater measure today, Lord. Perhaps anyone that does not know you fully, Lord. We pray that they would accept the gift of God which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Father have your way in the Sunday school class for the children. Father everything that would be said and done this Sunday in your house of worship. Father, we pray your hand would rest mightily upon everyone. In the name of Jesus we ask. Amen. We'll be continuing with the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. We'll start at paragraph 182 and after 238. And just for reference, this is from second Peter chapter 3 and Revelation 21 1-7. [Music] Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible only believe. &gt;&gt; You may be seated, brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer, take your hands off of God's property. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own. &gt;&gt; That's your rights. &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of her. Take your hands off of him. See, faith will do it. Oh my. Not annihilate it, but just take your hands off of it to loose it. Let it go. Pass it away. It changes. The earth will change. Politics will change. The religions will change. The denominations will pass away. Politics will pass away. The kingdom of God shall be established. We read in John uh read John in Revelation 6:14. See, it departed as a scroll. The Bible said the that it John said, "I saw the heaven and earth depart as a scroll." John Revelation 6:14. Jesus said, "Heavens and earth shall pass away." Or other words, heavens and earth shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Use that same word right there again. No, not annihilated. For later in Revelations 21 2- 24, he seen the new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven and sitting upon this earth. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it'll be annihilated. The systems will be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Daniel saw the same thing. The rock struck the world will shoot out without hands and the whole image of the systems was broke down and become like a champ on a summer thrashing for and the wind packed it away &gt;&gt; and the rock itself grew into a great mountain that covered the earth. &gt;&gt; Watch that mountain now in a little bit. That mountain covered the earth. Also, we find out here over also in Revelations there, it said the kings of the new earth will bring their honor and glory into it. And the earth is sitting, the new Jerusalem is sitting on this earth. See, it just changed. You're the same man and statue that you was when God called you, &gt;&gt; same woman. &gt;&gt; But you see what it did? It was a regeneration. The old life passed away. The old desires passed away. When you used to like to drink and cuss and fuss and stew and run around and immoral, that thing just died. &gt;&gt; See, but now you are used and you was Satan's instrument. Now you are redeemed. &gt;&gt; And that's what the world would be the same way. Redeemed, &gt;&gt; a new heavens and new earth just like you. You are a new creature. &gt;&gt; And the Greek word there, anybody knows said you are a new creation. &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creation in the same old temple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here. Now, glorious. All right. Now, we find that this earth will hold the kings of the earth. And again, in Matthew 5:5, Jesus said, "The meek shall inherit the earth." &gt;&gt; It isn't going to just go to heaven earth. It's just going to be the same earth. I'm trying to get the the plan of redemption to you before if I don't get nothing else. See, the baptism a fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it a fit place for his meek to live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, like he did us this creation to live in. Before he could come in it, he had to give us the baptism of fire. &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Ghost come in and live. &gt;&gt; Baptism of fire. Then when you get that baptism of fire, then the Holy Ghost can come in. What does it does? It burns up everything contrary to the word out of you. &gt;&gt; See, it won't believe nothing else but the word &gt;&gt; because it is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we was talking the other day. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; See the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you can receive the word &gt;&gt; not some system &gt;&gt; but have a clear understand. How you know the word's clear? Understand? Watch it vindicate itself. &gt;&gt; Well, you say, "I see this do it that." Oh, yes. Weeds live the same way. &gt;&gt; But it's got to be the entire word. &gt;&gt; To be the bride, you have to be part of him. He is the word. &gt;&gt; See, and what a part of him is it? The word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride. &gt;&gt; You're part of that. You get it? &gt;&gt; Don't Don't lose that. Now notice and he makes it a fit place to live through eternity. Notice this is still not referred to uh this millennium reign. The thousand years is not the new earth. See the millennium reign is a different reign. That's what we go into the millennium. That isn't a new earth. The new heaven. No. No. That's just a rest place. A rest period. Not at all. The new heaven is a new earth. For see, in the millennium, we have things that would not go into that. It's a type of the old seventh day out of Eden. The seventh day after he made the world, the seventh day he rested in Eden. And the millennium, see, the world has now almost 6,000 years old. See, every 2,000 years, it's had a a destruction. See, first 2,000, the flood came and he baptized it with what? water. Next 2,00 Jesus come to sanctify and clean it. Dropped his blood upon it, called it his. All right, I'll come again now as king with his queen. And the second 2,000 years, what does he do? He comes and gives his rest spirit and then burns her off and claims it for his own. &gt;&gt; Puts his own back on it. And notice, not the perfect world. This millennium, it's a type of the seventh day. Then comes the white throne judgment. See, we still have judgment. We're still in time in the millennium. It's a day 1,000 years. It's a time element, not don't get that mixed up with the new earth now, because it's not. You must say this to me. I just somebody might say this to me that uh now, brother Brandham, what do you go to do now? You've run out of your complete sevens. What are you going to do now? Now you're a dispensationalist, which I am. I believe that God is too. No, notice you run out of dispensation types for if you're going to put something beyond that seventh day, how you going to get it? Where are you going to now? All right, I'll call your attention to something. See, I I ain't had a dispensation yet. I got another scripture here. And remember, all of it has to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. Now you say, "Brother Bram, you're trying to put something way over yonder beyond that seventh day, that seventh day Sabbath. As God made the earth and labored six days and rested the seventh is only a type of time &gt;&gt; time, &gt;&gt; but I've just said here we become eternal." &gt;&gt; So where's your type now? You said your typologist. So you you've run out of types now. What happened? &gt;&gt; Let's just find out if we have Let's go to Leviticus back in the 23rd chapter of Leviticus. I want you to notice in Leviticus where we was at last Sunday or this what gave me the idea right here the 23rd chapter of Leviticus and the 26th verse. Now remember there is seven feast days. The feast of trumpets, the feast of of tabernacles, the feast of the sheath waving, all this is seven great feast days. That was only a type of the seven church ages. And you remember how many Sabbaths there was between one and the other. See, seven Sabbaths between Pentecost and the trumpets, which was seven church ages. And there was seven feast days that represent the seven church ages. Keep your numbers running. Say, "Well, now, Brother Bram, you're done. Run out. You got your seven." All right, let's take the last feast which is a feast of tabernacles. Now notice here in the 36th verse, seven days shall you offer offerings made of fire unto the Lord. On the eighth day, &gt;&gt; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's another holy time coming, holy convocation to you. And you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, and it is a solemn assembly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you shall do no terrible work therein. G. &gt;&gt; Now, we got an eighth day. Now, there's only seven days, but yeah, we speak of the eighth day holy conversation. Uh, combination. Notice do no work in it. The eighth day are what? Back to the first day. &gt;&gt; What speaks of eternity? as she rolls around without a stop in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Notice it was also upon this eighth day, last day, feast day of the tabernacle. Notice after that, after the last feast day, at the last church age, at the last complete seven days upon the earth, after the millennium that this holy convocation comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember this is feast of &gt;&gt; tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Tabernacles. &gt;&gt; Gathering places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where in the millennium the Bible said they shall build houses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They shall inhabit. But in the new earth he's already went prepared the place it's built. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with the building of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Eternal. Oh, I just love that word. My &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A holy convocation. The eighth day, which is only seven days. Then on the eighth day, which comes back to the first day again, comes right back to the first day. The eighth day is a holy com accommodation. Notice seven days only has to do with the old creation world time. &gt;&gt; Seven days. That's a millennium. The rest day is God labored six days, rested the seventh. The church labors se six days and rest the seventh. But you're still in time element. I ain't speaking of the eternal. But you see, there's no such a thing as eight days. You go back to the first day again. Amen. &gt;&gt; See the first day the Sabbath speaks of the old law which was to pass away. The keeping of a Sabbath which passed away or uh said uh changed to another. It didn't pass away. It is changed from the old law of keeping a certain day of the week. Isaiah the 19th chapter said I believe 28:19 said preip must go on preip here a little and there a little hold fast that what's good for stammer lips and other tongues when I speak to this people and here is the rest you enter into life not keeping a day or shadow Paul said over there in Hebrews the 4th chapter you keep days and shadows and things like that I'm scared of your experience &gt;&gt; see we don't pass into certain days and orders you pass from death unto eternal life &gt;&gt; not days and times you pass into eternity &gt;&gt; that's a holy com conversation convocation rather seven days what which pass away or I have said will change to another eight days deals with new creation see not old creation eight days is new creation for it was on the eighth day that our Lord Lord raised from the dead. &gt;&gt; There's your other convocation. &gt;&gt; The holiness &gt;&gt; not considered in the Sabbath at all or the feast of the tabernacles, feast of this, the feast of Pentecost. Jesus raised from the dead for our justification on the eighth day after the seven Sabbaths or seven days, seven church ages, Jesus raised from the dead. eighth day, &gt;&gt; which is a holy convocation. &gt;&gt; See, which is the first day. &gt;&gt; See, who's done passed through time and dropped into eternity again. &gt;&gt; Not keeping of days and keeping of Sabbaths and new moons and things like that, but have passed. &gt;&gt; Changed your form, &gt;&gt; not annihilated, &gt;&gt; glory, &gt;&gt; but passed from death unto life eternal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, what the Bible does teach us &gt;&gt; pass from one to another. &gt;&gt; All right. Pass the old Sabbath past. Jesus raised on the eighth day. That was a solemn day. Holy. And it wasn't a day cuz day of time had done run out. It passed into eternity. See, it swung right back to the first day again. See, eternity is like a a ring. You can't find no corner to it. You can't find no stopping place in a perfect circle. &gt;&gt; You go on and on. I don't care how far you go, you're still going. You start going around like this, go through the floor, go through the earth, go beyond the earth, you're still going. All things that was created down here are perverted, not created by Satan will drop out when the great golden bell rings and a trumpet sounds and back down at the beginning where the tie post is made in Eden. When man came to the earth and he fell, a little lamb shed its blood that spoke of the great lamb was coming to shed its blood. Calvary raised the cross that died for the Old Testament to them who justified. look for it. And in this new dispensation at the coming of the Lord at the new earth, the rope of salvation, the blood, the redeemed power that I'm talking about, and through the same system has redeemed both man and the earth &gt;&gt; will raise right up into eternity again. &gt;&gt; And the lake of fire will consume everything is ungodly and uncredestinated to it. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Yes. &gt;&gt; Notice &gt;&gt; the eighth day Jesus raised for our justification. The eternal king with the eternal kingdom to be baptized into to eternal life. &gt;&gt; Not seven days. Had nothing to do with any of the days. It's speaking of another &gt;&gt; eternal coming. Speaking of an eternal time, &gt;&gt; the world I'm speaking of. And notice after 50 days or seven Sabbaths from there again come another holy convocation. What happened? The Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost on the seventh day or the eighth day rather. Eighth day fell on the eth day was seven Sabbaths later. Exactly after his resurrection. See so it'd be seven times that again. Bring it right back around to the first day of the week again. &gt;&gt; Exactly. See, there's your holy convocation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not have anything to do with the literal things. It's beyond that. &gt;&gt; It's into the kingdom of God with eternal life. &gt;&gt; With the predestinated that never did start. &gt;&gt; It never started on anything. &gt;&gt; You wasn't saved on any day. &gt;&gt; You was always saved. Jesus has come to redeem that &gt;&gt; but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with. &gt;&gt; A trout fish can never be a gar &gt;&gt; or a tadpole. &gt;&gt; He might be in the same water with him, but he was from the beginning a trout. &gt;&gt; The net only caught him. See, &gt;&gt; but he was that from the beginning. &gt;&gt; There's that. Now, we're not out of dispensations, are we? We're right into the scripture. 50 days later, it come. See, eight cannot be counted with the week. See, it cannot be counted eight days a week. You can't do it. &gt;&gt; See, because it's only seven days in a week. &gt;&gt; Count any way you want to. Sunday's the first day of the week. &gt;&gt; See, you count seven, then you have to go back in and start over again. Count seven, come back, go over again. &gt;&gt; See, we live through all these types in here. But when you hit the eighth, &gt;&gt; you go on into eternity. &gt;&gt; You don't come by laws and rituals and orders. You come by predestination. &gt;&gt; There's a genuine holy old vocation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, and we're ending the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; Church age. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? Amen. &gt;&gt; We're entering that holy v cococation. &gt;&gt; We are entering into that real genuine eternity. &gt;&gt; Where the church is called not to some station, some denomination, but into eternity with their eternal king. &gt;&gt; We don't have it at all. &gt;&gt; No such a thing as days and hangs and times. You're passed into eternity. &gt;&gt; Where you come from? &gt;&gt; Amen. You was there to begin with. &gt;&gt; If you got eternal life, he's only one form. That's God. &gt;&gt; And you are an expressed attribute. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you if you're not, you're not going to be there anyhow. &gt;&gt; No man can come to me except my father's drawing. &gt;&gt; See, which passes away all these old things, but these things don't. So, it speaks of eternity. The Holy Ghost is eternal. Then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened. &gt;&gt; See, you were made for an eternal purpose because you was a the manifestation of an attribute that was in God that thought of you &gt;&gt; and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of &gt;&gt; and to make you a human being. and sin come along and perverted his way. &gt;&gt; You come anyhow &gt;&gt; but you was lost with the world. &gt;&gt; So he come and redeemed you &gt;&gt; the express attribute and also redeems his earth by the same way here &gt;&gt; then his purpose rolls on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, that does me so much good. &gt;&gt; Think of just what lays ahead. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Happy birthday.

Oh God, we want your perfect will in our lives, Lord. The events from this week, Lord, from the next week, it just grounds our faith even more, Lord, knowing that you've got everything under control. There's no accidents or you're not anxious about anything, Lord, like we sometimes get. We're not supposed to be anxious, but Lord, our humanity, sometimes our flesh gets in the way. So pray that you just calm us this morning. Speak to each heart, each need, each life. We love you and thank you so very much. As we collect the tithes and offerings, we believe and pray that it'll go right to the very kingdom, Lord, that you claimed and we are part of and that it might just further that, Lord, that last soul we know would be coming right in and you'll be coming home for us. Lord, we thank you for all things. Thank you for this opportunity. Name of our precious Lord and Savior. All God's people say, "Amen. [Music] Reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by. You will find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He's passing by this moment. Your needs to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as he goes by. You can be seated if you'd like. Let's go back to the key of C. Lord, take these hands. Lift them up. For I have not the strength to praise you near and for I am nothing. I am nothing [Music] without. Let's sing that verse to him again. Take these hands, lift them up. For I have not got the strength to praise you near enough. For I am nothing. I am nothing without Lord. Take my voice. Let us sing about the songs of mercy that I found. Take my voice and pour it out. Let it sing the songs of mercy I have found. Thank you, Lord. I'm nothing. Oh, I'm nothing without you. And all my soul needs is all your love to cover me. All the world will see that I have nothing without you. Lord, take my body. Take my body and build it up. May it be broken as an offering of love for I'm nothing. I am nothing without you. Take my time, Lord. Lord, take my time here on this earth. Let it glorify all that you are worth. For I am nothing. I am nothing without you. All my soul needs and all my soul needs. all your love to cover me. So all the world will see I am nothing without you. [Music] And the second verse I was singing it and just you know when I when I sing that one normally just think yeah that's what it gave me my voice to sing but paying attention to what it said on there. Maybe you could put up the words for that second verse. Let it sings of let it sing of mercy that I have found. And that's what I want my testimony to be is what am I doing with my voice? Am I talking about what he's done for me? Am I talking about his mercy for me, his grace for me? or am I using it to talk something that is not consistent with the mercy and grace that he showed to me? Am I extending grace and mercy to others in the way that I'm talking to them, talking about them? Lord, just help me. How many can say that's your desire this morning? Lord, take my voice, pour it out. May it be used for your good, Lord. Oh, take my voice and pour it out, Lord. Let it sing us the songs of mercy I've found. I am nothing, Lord. I'm nothing. Without you, all my soul needs and all my soul [Music] is all your love to cover me. Your all the world will see that I am nothing without you. [Music] I need more of you. Yes. More of you. I've had it all, but what I need is just more of you [Music] of things I've had. &gt;&gt; Oh, but they won't satisfy. And yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord hear my prayer for more of you. I need more of you. I need more of you. I've had it all, but what I need is more of you. of things I've had my will and yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord hear my prayer for more of you. &gt;&gt; Let's ask him again. That's what we need this morning, Lord, is all of you. We need more of you. We've had it all but one, just more of you. [Music] of things I've had to fear. And yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. Just continue to worship. Pray for that this morning as they continue to play for you. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] I [Music] give [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. N. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Lord Jesus, ask your blessings upon this service this morning. Lord, we give you all the praise, all the glory, the honor. We thank you for another opportunity, Lord, to stand in your presence, Lord, a place provided for us to worship you in spirit and in truth. Lord, bless every heart. Send your anointing upon us. We pray, Father, just uh forgive us of any shortcomings. And we pray that you'll be glorified. you be magnified in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless each of you. So happy to be in the house of the Lord with you today. And uh welcome to the house of the Lord. Amen. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; We're so happy to see each of and every one of you. Amen. So, I think the announcements went out for the prayer meeting for the brother's men's prayer meeting that's coming up on the 20th, next week, Saturday. And so, um, if you have an RSVP, why don't you do that so the brothers can know? And we would love to do something for you sisters, too, if someone can give me what that would be. And so, um, I know that we've been very busy with the different activities and stuff. So, but we're thinking about you all and we trust the Lord will help you help us uh to do that. And so, I was getting ready for a prayer meeting or every Saturday morning prayer meeting with the brothers. We've been doing that for I think since 2018 is when we started doing that. Um and the Lord has made a way for us to do it. almost feel empty when I don't do it on my Saturday. But as I was getting ready la this last Saturday, um I thought, you know, it'd be nice. Everyone's welcome to be a part of that. It's just for the brothers only, but you sisters can get up at 4 or 5 in the morning and pray with us. And you brothers that can't come or don't come. And I'm being serious. I'm It's funny, but I'm being serious, too. you can be a part but you know in your home there and maybe pray with us because when we come together and pray the Lord has answered our prayer many many times &gt;&gt; right on the scene instant healings right on the scene um and I usually ask the brothers is there anything to pray for and the brothers usually call some of your all's names out the needs of the elders I usually pray for all of the the sister churches here in the pray for voice of god recordings and not just their missionary effort but all the missionary efforts we pray for them or we try to and then that's the purpose of it so we know we can't pray too much and I think that that's where our strength lies it's a secret &gt;&gt; it's a secret power &gt;&gt; and um and every Christian has to develop that and the sooner you can develop that ability to pray to call on God in desperation, then God will hear your prayer. Amen. We know that prayer changes things. &gt;&gt; You know, God is going to do whatever he wants to do. We can't make God do anything. So, I I would love for this service to just go in a in a certain direction, but I can't make the Holy Spirit move. I can't make any service. Now, we can manufacture some things and get louder or get faster or get whatever, but God is going to do whatever he wants to do. &gt;&gt; But also in the realms of prayer, prayer changes things and he places that in the hands of his people. So, you can get down on your knees and pray and the Lord will hear your prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject is not on prayer today, but I'm just thinking about Daniel when he went to the Lord to pray. He was in prayer and 21 days later, the angel met him and said, "Daniel, the first day you prayed, I heard you, but I had to fight with the prince of the power of Persia to and I needed help from one of the angels to come and see you." But from the first day you prayed, I heard you. And that was 21 days. &gt;&gt; And this is an unseen battle, but the scriptures have it written there so you can see what's taking place when we pray. When you go down on your knees and pray, God hears your prayer. Can he come instantly? Does he come instantly? Well, not all the time. You He He's battling it out for you. You are battling it out. It's a weapon of our warfare. is not carnal. But we have a weapon called prayer. More greater, more powerful than the atomic bomb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And um this is why we have to pray for one another. We pray for the meetings. What did that atomic bomb do? That atomic bomb was I mean it was just it was powerful. Anyways, I want to get into prayer. But that um is what we do. We have that men's prayer meeting every Saturday. And then this one will be the prayer meeting for a prayer breakfast. And we've done that for four years. I think this is our fifth year. Doing that, it allows some of the other churches to come together um if they so choose and then the brothers to come together and eat and so forth. And so um I really lengthened that announcement out more than I wanted it to. &gt;&gt; But prayer is the key that unlocks the door. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If maybe you don't like me, but if you pray for me, I'll prefer that. &gt;&gt; I want you to like me and pray for me. But if I had to choose one or the other, cuz prayer is the greatest thing you can ever do for another individual. Pray for me and I'll pray for you. Amen. And pray for the service. So, um, and then also our special meetings are coming actually in November. We have the dates on that and we want to be in prayer for that. Was there another announcement? We're going to greet the saints in Mesa. The art's not feeling well. So Ezekiel's there song leading for the service there in Mesa this morning. I would have liked to see that. But Ezekiel led the service there. He's going to lead tonight for them. So we appreciate him doing that. I don't see the saints from Ngalas here. Oh, there she is. Sorry, sis. Hopefully you can. You understand a lot of English. I said it in Spanish. No, she understands quite a bit. And if you need an interpreter, I think I don't know if Brother Ben, you're able to do that. I She maybe she's okay. But if we needed one, who would that be? Brother Ben or who else could interpret? Zack. Zack. Brother Zack, can you interpret for the sister this morning? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was he gonna say? No. I appreciate Appreciate that, brother Zach. Put you on the spot like that. Thank you. So, oh my God bless you. Thank you. So, we'll get the interpreter for you, sis. Amen. And so we'll go let's go right into the word this morning and take our Bibles in a very familiar portion of scripture. Matthew chapter 16. I know this the the team in the back there got those quotes probably late. I emailed them to you. Did you get them? Okay. So, we'll be patient and I think there many of those you'll find them very quickly. Anyways, Matthew chapter 16. And I was thinking about this thought here on what our mission is and what you know what do you think of when you think of this church. Now I have it in my mind what I think is the most important thing and what I have portrayed to the church and each man here brother sister how you have portrayed what you think people think of you. But if we were to ask you, what does the church actually stand for? This little church here. I Okay, we're in the message. Yeah. But what does it actually stand for? What are we preaching on all the time? What are we always pointing people to? Sum it up in a sentence or two. Um, are we a holiness church? Are we always preaching against sin? Are we always preaching on the Holy Ghost? are we promoting the message or what part of the message? And so, um, just taking a few scriptures. I won't be able to go deep into it like the subject would allow, but I think starting here in Matthew chapter 16 will help us. What did I say? Matthew or Mark? &gt;&gt; Okay, we're going to take Matthew 16 and then Mark 16 also. Matthew chapter 16. In verse number 13, when Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am? And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremas, or one of the prophets. And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven, and I say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. So we see the church is built upon this rock. Mark chapter 16 verse number 15. The prophet of God and many Christians call this the great commission. So this is the great commission of the church. When you have that, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read it all together. Verse 15, 16, 17, and 18. All together. And he said unto them, "Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. Then lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your blessings upon your most holy word. Bless your people. Bless me Lord. Father, may your word uh come forth how it's supposed to today in Jesus name. Amen. One more scripture as you're being seated. Acts 1:8. I'll just quote it. And ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Now this uh scripture in Matthew chapter 16, you may be seated. Thank you. Our mission. This is our mission. If I was to title it, I would just title it that. Our our mission. This is the great commission. And brother Madam sums this up in uh not sums it up, but he really opens it up in a message, the invisible union of the bride of Christ. And he makes this statement. We've said it many times. Many of you know it. 1965 November he says this paragraph 101 what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility ability to prayer and to the word and to Christ just the same as a woman has. That word responsibility is the state or the fact of having to deal with something or having control over someone. You're responsible for this one or that one. the state or fact of being accountable or to blame for something. So when you're the responsible one, you are the one to blame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we all have a level of responsibility. Every one of us do. and what man has done from the garden all the way down. We've always wanted to point the finger at somebody else's responsibility or we make an excuse to lessen the blame on us. Who wants to be blamed for anything &gt;&gt; that's negative? I mean, I was to blame. Adam, what are you doing here? Uh, you have these figs on you. Well, the wife you gave me, she's to blame. &gt;&gt; And then the serpent, he gave me this fruit. Oh, he's to blame. The serpent's to blame. And all those things are true. The serpent was to blame. Yes, the wife was to blame. But Adam, did you have any responsibility? Is there any blame towards you? And this um um accountability is something that the scripture tells us that we are all going to have to stand and give an account one day. &gt;&gt; Romans 14:12 says, "So then every one of us shall give an account of himself to God." So, it's not these group accountability sessions like me and my friends and me and my friend, hey, hey, stand with me in the judgment. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're not going to have these groups to stand with. You're not going to have these peers. You're not going to have the people that that that you have a problem with, the ones that you can blame. They're not going to stand with you. That's not correct. Every individual will give an account for the deeds that are done in their own bodies. &gt;&gt; Now, our accountability is connected, too. We're connected to one another and the way I treat you and the things that I have said to you, what you have said to me and pastors and preachers and the leaders and a mother and a father to have all these levels of accountability that will be there to witness um when your time comes to be judged. And the prophet of God makes the statement, and maybe we'll read it here in a moment, that everything we've done or said in our life is being recorded right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it'll be brought back up again and it will speak on your behalf. You won't have to say anything. We just get the recording &gt;&gt; and watch you and see you. And so this accountability Every one of us shall give an account to God. That's Romans 14:10. Matthew 12:36. But I say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment. That's our Lord Jesus speaking. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody? &gt;&gt; Every idol word. Those are those not the verbal words. Those are little secret words. There little words that nobody else heard, but every idol word will give an account. You give an account. Jesus said so. Hebrews 13:7 says, "Obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves, for they watch for your souls." as that as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy, not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you. You know, the ministers are going to give an account. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All the stuff they're saying is a nice little position. Yes, you get to stand in the front. Yes. You know, you visit a place, they give you a special seat. Yes, if you need something, you're the minister. You have all the praise. Yes. You always have the mic in your hand. You get to do all the talking. You're the preacher and you're going to give an account. &gt;&gt; Every one of us are &gt;&gt; now in uh 1 Peter 4:5 says, "Who shall give an account to him that is ready to judge or quicken the dead?" So, we see this accountability is coming to every one of us. And this is part of the sacred trust. This is part of the great commission. Go and preach the gospel to every creature. Let me ask you, have you been preaching the gospel? &gt;&gt; Have you been telling others and trying to witness to them about the good news? or have we developed this attitude that, you know, they're not going to receive it. It's kind of strange. It's a little off. I don't want to make it awkward. I don't want to make it uncomfortable, but you know, you're going to give an account. &gt;&gt; You have to give an account for your words. You have to give an account and for the scriptures to go and to preach the gospel to every creature. Brother Manner makes this statement here in the message God's only provided place of worship 1965. Now have you notice every three years a great meeting what takes place? A denomination. This is 20 years and no denomination. Dear dying lamb may it never do that. If I go in this generation, may the people who believes this message never stand still for a denomination. Uh you'll die right in your track. Remember that. The very hour that you mention denomination among you. I don't care how sincere you are. Take man for your leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word. That's the hour you die. The genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed. It's the same thing was back at the beginning. It's the bride that fell in the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat. I meant to read that early earlier, but we read it and I might read it again. So this church that to preach the gospel and this solemn warning that I just read for you here as we who claim to follow the message and and really our responsibility is for this local church here, the the members in this church, how you serve one another here, that's really um what you'll be uh going to be judged with, not so much what the other churches are doing. What are you doing? what is your position? What what's taking place in your life right now is really um what you should be responsible for. And you know, one of the great warnings for those of us that follow this word, we know that every church, every group after three years, a denomination was formed. &gt;&gt; And what was that? that was uh the people took men as their leader instead of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We would say if if I was to sum up one of the greatest teachings that differs us that brother warned over and over and over against was just that one aspect right there. Do not denominate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do not accept the leadership of man over the word of God. He's always to remain first. And so has any of our churches that follow the message, have they denominated? The individual individuals that follow the message, have they denominated? Is there anyone in here that's ever got a denominational spirit on you? &gt;&gt; And so it's a responsibility. It's a warning to us that that doesn't happen, that we don't um become a denomination because God is depending on us to represent who he is. And he said, "Upon this rock, I build my church." Not brother Israel's church, not brother so and so's church, not the reverend over there's church, but God has a church that he built his revelation upon. And the gates of hell shall never prevail against that. &gt;&gt; Who who who are these people? What's the name of that group? What what street corner are they on? How do you identify them? These signs shall follow them that believe in my name, they'll cast out devils. So this great temptation, this great warning to not denominate you. You ever invite anyone to church, they're going to ask you what church you go to? Many times they'll ask you what denomination it is and we'll say we're not a denomination by name. But denomination isn't just a name. We know that denomination is a spirit. &gt;&gt; And this is probably the greatest warning in the message, overruling, overriding warning in the message is to not denominate. We are not a denomination. We're a fellowship of Jesus Christ. We are not a denomination. We are Christians, sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; We are not a denomination. We're not tied to a group. We don't have a creed. There's no rules. There's no man that leads us. We are led by the Holy Spirit. He is the captain. He's the leader of our church. He's the founder. He's the one who died. He's the one that we serve, &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; We are Christians. But we become in our little groups. We have to make sure we we let the other group know that we're not that group before 633 group or after 63 group whatever it is. And um so that's one of those great responsibilities is you know is that spirit of denomination trying to creep on me? Is it trying to creep on your pastor? Is it tried to creep in my mindset or my mentality? The message screams out against that spirit and Satan is behind it. &gt;&gt; He is the author of organized religion. &gt;&gt; He is the one who wants to control a man. One man leading another man. God never called one man to lead another man. God called the Holy Spirit to lead his church, sons and daughters of God, led by the spirit of God. Romans 8. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So he gives us his word. Now, brother Bandom gives us this warning after every three years a great meeting what takes place a denomination forms. So what happens here? Brother Banham alive 20 years this great pillar of fire is being manifested right no denomination form and then brother Brandham leaves the scene that's been 60 years ago over 60 years something like that he's been gone is that right has there been any organizations or denominations form after it &gt;&gt; we might argue about that Somebody said yes. Somebody said no. Not officially. Well, officially no. But if it Did he say quack like a duck? Walks like a duck, smells like a duck, you can put chicken over it if you want to, but it's a duck. &gt;&gt; And you can call whatever you want to call it, whatever you want to call it. But if the spirit of organization is working or ruling the group or you in your life, then you're falling into this great trap that you were warned not to do. Brother Bam tells us in the fundamental foundation for faith 19 uh 55, he says this, "Now God is depending on you as a member of his body to bear fruit of his spirit. And now if if he's depending on you, let's open up our channels and let the Holy Spirit come in tonight and energize us and free us from all these fears and doubts. Revival has come. Someone said, "The power is only given to the apostle for those things." I'm not a historian, but I've read much history of the church history, and I've never seen a time in all the history of the world where there ever was waves of the Holy Ghost that ever struck the church and without a revival. But what signs, wonders, miracles followed it. God healed the sick in every age and will continue to do it in every age where people and churches are willing to let loose and let the Holy Spirit take control of their being. &gt;&gt; That's the church I want to be a part of. &gt;&gt; That's the church that we call God's church. &gt;&gt; God is depending on you. He says in questions and answers paragraph 41, God is depending on you and I. See, the Holy Spirit, the earth is full of the spirit of God, but it's poured out. It cannot operate until it comes into us. We human beings to operate. And the devil wants to take us over to operate under him. So when he gets this mouth form, he starts in sin. If he can hold him just in a righteous man, a good man, and just let him go ahead and try to be good like that, if he can hold him like that until he's dead, that's just what he wants to do. He's got him. Because no matter how righteous you are, how good you are, how moral you are, how clean you are, how honest you are, you'll never get to heaven until you're born again. Jesus said so. So there's no it's you've got to be born. You've got to be regenerated or there's not a way in the world for you to ever enter heaven or ever come to Christ. Now is that statement true or not? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That's a true statement. &gt;&gt; Got to be born again. &gt;&gt; The Patmas vision paragraph 219. He says this here, the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Now the word's made flesh in his church dwelling among us. His angels in his hand ministering. God is depending. God is depending upon his church. God is relying on us of this age to bring this gospel light to a dying, heathenbound traditional world. God is laying the burden on me and you. &gt;&gt; Woe unto us if the heathen dies without knowing. Woe unto us if these people running around in this Walmart parking lot dies in this neighborhood where there's two churches in walking distance and they never hear about the gospel. Whose whose job is that? &gt;&gt; Who who go who whose burden is that? He said, "Well, Lord, send the Holy Spirit and just cause people to lead him in here like you let him in the time with Noah's ark. Just just blindly just let him just walk, you know, just blindly send them through these doors." He can do that. &gt;&gt; But he can use you, too. &gt;&gt; Go get them. &gt;&gt; Go get them. A free pull pit, free preaching time, a lot of ministry right there. Right over here, right there. [Music] And somebody in this neighborhood is to blame for those people not hearing it. Now, who's to blame? &gt;&gt; Well, he said that Catholic, there's a big Catholic church on the corner. They're the blame. They should be the ones out there trying to get the gospel to these people. I don't think so. Who's responsible for that? You know, we make excuses, don't we? We say, "Well, you know, they're so far gone and look how bad they are and look at this and you know, you know, there's no glory in spending my time with this." You know, it's dangerous out there. We like that one. There's d a lot of danger out there. It's probably more dangerous in traffic. Probably more dangerous I mean dangerous everywhere. Sure. But we're talking about preaching the gospel now. Who is responsible so that these people don't die without ever hearing about it? I think that ought to be a tragedy for a young man 20, 30, 50, whatever, die and stands before the Lord and says, "Well, what city you come?" I came out of the city of Tucson. Have you ever do you know anything about these pictures? And just show them some of these pictures. Ah, what is that? Do you know anything about the angel of the Lord coming out? No, I never heard about it. What city did you come out of? I came out of Tucson. How many churches were there? 15 of them. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Somebody's to blame for that. God is depending on you and I. Can I go a little bit further? In the message leadership, the prophet of God says this. You know, Jesus said, "In so much as you give unto the least of these, you have done it unto me." See, you're the men and women of tomorrow. If there is a tomorrow, you'll be there. God is depending on you. He's talking to these young people. 1965 leadership. Where was that at? In Prescott. &gt;&gt; Believe it's in Prescott. He's talking to the the new generation, the young generation. and and that new generation. Just look it up. It's a beautiful message. I don't have time to bring it. It's a beautiful thought that there is another generation that's following this message. Now, I know to some of the young people here, I'm old, but to the old generation, I'm young. &gt;&gt; So, to some people, I'm old, some people I'm young. I'm right at that little spot there. Okay. But I'm still part of the new generation. I'm a part of the generation I didn't see Moses. I didn't see the prophet. I didn't see though I know that it happened. I see the signs and wonders around the pastors. I met many of them that were part of that first generation. But here I am, you know, preaching the gospel in this city. And you know, all of the churches, I don't get along with all of them per se in the sense of like I agree with every one of them. But we're we're certainly comrades. And comrades have the same goal. Comrades don't even have to be friends. Comrades are like, "There's the enemy. Let's get them." And that's, you know, that's what, you know, that's what some of the churches are. Now, I'm friends with most of it. I I believe I I know I love all of them. I don't have nothing personal with, let me think real quick. I don't have nothing personal against none of them. But but you know we're in the city here and I believe we have the same mission and go I think if I think of all of the pastors that I know I'm talking about this city I'm talking about Tucson that I know I think every one of them want to see the gospel of Jesus Christ go forward. &gt;&gt; I believe that. I really do. I don't believe it's a negative. I don't believe they're devils. I don't believe they're trying to hurt. I don't believe they're trying to take something. I believe they're trying to see the message go forward. So with that I stand with them in the same mission. Okay. But I'm going to give an account not for what they are doing but I am going to give an account for my attitude towards them. And I will give an account for my own ministry, my own little gift, my own little talent, my own little wherewithal that I have. And every sister, every brother, every preacher, non- preacher, every believer &gt;&gt; will give an account &gt;&gt; for the good news that God gave to you. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to put that together. giving an account without your pastor, without the church, without the excuse. You personally given an account here. I gave you this. What did you do about it? Did you tell anybody in the last month? In the last year? Did you even think about telling somebody? This is the great commission. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to what? To every creature. There's some creatures out there, too. Preach it to them. This is part of our mission. Are we doing that? Amen. If we're not achieving that, there's a problem there. the unity of one God and his church. 1958 the prophet of God says this prayer 32 and Jesus said on the earth a little leavenven is a whole lump and it's got to be perfectly right or it isn't right at all and the plan of salvation has got to be exact and God's promises are exact and they work exact and there's something there is something is wrong somewhere where and if the church of the living God is not achieving what God purposed for them to do, there is something wrong with that system somewhere. Just got to be. Now, I truly believe that there is coming a church that will manifest signs, wonders, and miracles. That will be a Holy Ghost fil church. I believe that church is in existence. I believe that church is maybe an infant and some are maybe more mature. And then some I believe are really doing what the Bible said, what the message said that they would be doing. But I don't necessarily have to know them. They don't there's no s there's no, you know, demand that they have to be on Facebook where we have to say, "Oh, there's the church that's doing what he said." No, no, no, no. Very well could be in existence. And I believe it is in existence somewhere cuz God keeps his word and he always has a witness. &gt;&gt; So the idea that God's church manifesting with the signs, wonders, and miracles like it's supposed to be like it's going to be posted on some church form so everybody can identify that we're doing what actually what brother Brandham said to do. Who said that it has to exist? Could very well be a young brother picked up this message and believed it and is preaching it and God's manifesting it with signs, wonders, and miracles. Let's be real clear. The Lord is manifesting miracles, signs, wonders in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. But how many want to see more of it? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. How many want to get drunk in the spirit? &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about drunk for the sake of getting drunk. I'm talking about drunk with a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when a sinner comes in our midst, they say, "Surely God is among them people." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. That's the Bible says that when the stranger is among you and this thing takes place, they'll say, "Surely &gt;&gt; God is with them people." &gt;&gt; That little neighborhood over there. All right. Praise the Lord. I'm going to run the aisle in a minute. Now, so there's only one place provided by God here. Now, so we've been warned about this organization, warned about this denomination. And here's what the prophet of God says. This is really striking. When I read this, it really struck me. 1963, he says this. Today, I know it's becoming the same way. There's not a thing left, my Christian friend, but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the only hope that the church has as far as it comes. If it ever takes up a denomination again, it's finished because every denomination's finished. When it become a denomination, it's the very thing I'll say something here. Maybe I ought to say it, but yet I believe I ought to say it. Remember he's in Chicago telling us if you notice Lucifer is exactly doing the same thing today that he did at the beginning. See Lucifer at the beginning wanted to build himself a kingdom which was greater and more beautiful than Michael's kingdom. Christ that he that was that was his ambition to achieve something like that. And what did he get to do it by? He took fallen angels who had lost their first estate. He took that to do it with. And today Lucifer has got into the church and taken away the word and injected denomination. And he is building a church. The ecomunical move that's going on now to unite all Protestants together and then all together come to Catholic. And this pope, they got in now to do the same thing, exactly what the scripture said it would do. And what's he doing it by? He's doing it by man of those great economical moves who does not know God. And many of them in the Pentecostals cause because they're doing the same. What is it? He's doing it with fallen angels, fallen Lutheran, fallen Methodists, fallen Pentecostals that lost their original state from the word of God. Can I add one in there? Fallen message believers, fallen so-called believers who's fallen from the word of God and going right back into make a great big economical move. fallen messengers. Messengers who once stayed with the word but sold out their birthrights and join in with the world. Same thing it is at the last day and their and Lucifer is achieving today by man with those spirits in them that he did with angels at the beginning. Fallen angels who kept not their first estate to obey God. And he's doing the same thing today. This was after he preached Christ the mystery of God revealed and keeps talking about it 4-hour message. He just got through preaching that. He travels up to Chicago and then he drops this in here that this is what Lucifer is doing. He's gathering fallen angels and he's showing us that these fallen angels are fallen men that fallen Luther's, Methodists, whatever. They've fallen from the word and they've caused this to be called a so-called church. Everybody that's called a church is not a church. And everybody that's called a Christian is not a Christian. But my responsibility is to be a part of the church that Christ built upon this rock. I will build my church and the gates of hell shall never prevail against it. And the day I take man's leadership over the word of God, that's the day that I die. And all of the groups that have gone on before us that did it, they died. And our groups are no different. This little church is no different. &gt;&gt; Any individual in here is no different. The day you take the leadership of man, man's idea, your idea over the word of God, that's the day you die and you're not fulfilling the mission of the great church that we're supposed to be fulfilling. Now, brother Vanam asked this question. Now, that was a loaded one there. Lucifer is now in the church now leading people. He asked this question in his message. Remember he was traveling from overseas. I think he was in South Africa. He come across a missionaries that were in the airport with him, a young man and two ladies and they had been on the mission field for a number of years. And he asked him this question and it's a real one and it's a challenging question. And those of you that are sleeping, please wake up to receive at least this question. How many souls have you brought to Christ since you have been witnessing on the mission field? How many souls? How many souls? You know, I I would even phrase a question like this. How many souls have you even told about Christ? not even warned them to Christ. Have you even told about Christ? Whose job is that? We say, "Well, brother, it's brother Ben's job because he, you know, he likes to witness." Or, "It's brother Chris's job because he's likes to witness and he's tall and he can get out there and more visible." No, it's sister so and so, sister whoever's position because she's, you know, she's got that nature. She could talk to every No, it's go into all the world and preach the gospel. Who is he talking to? His church. Who are you a part of? Who's going in the rapture? &gt;&gt; Who's the bride of Christ? This is a responsibility. Somebody's to blame for the sinners on the streets that didn't hear. Now, if they heard about it, that's one thing. But if they didn't hear about it, what neighborhood was you living? Oh, I've lived next door to a believer and he don't even know anything about Christ. I I would say this. I would say this there there is no mechanical way of say brothers, well now I'm going to go out there and go knock on every door. No, no, no. I think it starts by you praying. It has to be a desire in your heart to see someone else come to the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that someone else might be my sister. It might be my brother or one of my uncles. &gt;&gt; It might be somebody that looks like you, like me, like whoever. But it should be somebody that we're going to go get to talk about the gospel. &gt;&gt; We're responsible for that. Amen. Amen. Now, I like how brother Brandon brings it here. And be not afraid. We stand on the corner somewhere in our church. We cast out the net through the neighborhood and gather with all that we can, bringing in every sinner. No matter what position he's in, we try to bring him to Christ. Well, then there comes a time when we want to reach a way out. So, we put all of our nets together so we can go away out and get a big rake. And that's what we're here for tonight. And I just knitted my net in the fellowship of love around the brethren and their net to sane way out through Los Angeles and around and see how many souls we can get in for Christ. That's the purpose of being here. Don't you like that attitude? &gt;&gt; I think that's the right attitude. I think the right attitude is like let's see how many souls we can get into Christ. Let's see who we can witness the word of truth to. Okay, that's the right attitude. And then brother Bam deals with this end door to the heart 1958. He says one of the greatest churches that I know of the pro in the Protestant realm. I was coming down out of southern Rhdesia and I'd been up there in a meeting and I seen the American passport. There was three little girls and a boy and I said, "I see that you got American passports." He turned and said, "Oh, you speak English?" I said, "I'm an American." I said, "What are you?" He said, "Oh, we're missionaries." I said, "That's fine." And I said, "Where are you from?" And they was from my backyard almost where the great seminary is at. I said, "That's good." I said, "I'm from Jeffersonville, Indiana." Oh. He said, "You are? How long you been over?" He said, "Going over two years." I said, "How many souls have you won to Christ since you've been over?" Ducked his head. And I said, "Sisters, have have have many have you won to Christ since you've been over?" But just before I did that, he says, "What's your name?" I said, "Brandom." Oh. He said, "You're the one that caught that big stir down in Africa down there." Down in South Africa. I said, "I don't know whether there was any stir or not." He says, "Well, we heard that you was a holy roller." I said, "30,000 raw heathens come to Christ day before yesterday." I said, "There's more than all of our churches has done in our missionaries in 150 years over there." And I found missionaries, our natives coming in with the tag on their neck as a missionary as Christians packing an idol in their army. So, Brother Adam continues on. And so, he asked the question. That's all it was was a question. You're missionary. Two years you've been missionary on the field. How many souls have you won to Christ? It's a real question. I'd ask that question to us tonight or this morning. Brother Brandham continues in paragraph number 12 in the message experiences. I have a couple more quotes here. God bless you. I said, "Gentlemen, for the past 50 years, you've been sending missionaries down in Africa. I met many of them. I've been there for a long time. Some of them little old girls there said they were missionaries." And boys, I said, "Where are you from?" They told me what college they're from. How many souls you won to Christ? Not none yet. Riding out in a nice car, live in the best hotels, and says, "None yet." No. When the natives have a war dance after they come up out of the mines and things, they pass out a few tracks. What does a native know about a tract? Paul learned a long time ago Jesus Christ always knows that it takes power to convert the heathen. That's right. They was walking around there and all them little old pamphlets in their hand. As soon as their back was turned, they throw it away like that. I said, "You sent missionaries in there for 50 years. You spend millions of dollars." I says, "What would what you call fanaticism won more people to Christ in five minutes time than all the missionaries you sent in for 50 years?" Hallelujah. Our God lives and reigns. He's a God of power. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Look at brother Brandham, the blushing prophet. Look at his attitude. So, first the attitude should be let's see how many we can get. Let's see who we can go get. And then the question should be asked, how many did you how many have you witnessed to? Did you win? How many did you witness to? What's your witnessing strategy? Are you even thinking about it? Do you even pray about it? Is it something that's a burden on you when Jesus said go and preach the gospel? Oh, how we need to pray. Now, we'll go back to you again, brother. Do you realize we don't pray half as much as our fathers did? Pastor, do you know we don't put as much time on our knees as the pastors before us did? Women, do you realize you don't instruct your daughter and pray with her at night like your mother did you? Then what about it? Who is guilty? We are guilty. There's no way around it. We are guilty. I'm guilty. I'm guilty of not doing the job of God like I should do. I'm confessing it that I'm wrong. I'm asking God to be merciful to me. I look out here and see the opportunities I've missed because of petty things, little old insignificant things that didn't mean nothing. I'm ashamed of myself as a gospel minister before you. I repent before God. And I ask God to forgive me and the church to forgive me for being so dilitary about the work of God. By the grace of God and by the help of God, I'll not listen to what everyone trying to tell you something to do. They got a program. They got something for you to do. Nonsense. I know God's program. It's written out here in the Bible. And I'm ashamed of myself as a minister of the gospel. 1 million souls won. I ought to have 10 million souls won. I'm way behind. Look at the attitude of a successful man. &gt;&gt; I would say Brother Brandon was successful in this ministry. &gt;&gt; I believe he's got rewards to prove it. &gt;&gt; I believe it's diligence, his family, the witness behind, the fruits left behind. His 60 years passed and his message has gotten stronger and greater. I say he was successful. wouldn't you? But look at the attitude of a successful man. Thinks he's never done enough versus looking for an excuse or a reason not to do anything. He won 1 million. Wow. I'd say wow. But then he says, "I should have won 10." And I think that's the right balance. I think we should be doing something, but then we should be doing even more than we're doing. And that's not a criticism. That's an encouragement. That's a coach. That's a teacher. That's the Lord leading you on. There's lots of work to do. The the laborers are few. The harvest is plenty, but the labor can't find anybody to go work. I need some workers in my vineyard. I can't find anybody to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, somebody. &gt;&gt; And then he comes back into that cro that question again. 1 million souls won. I ought to have 10 million souls won. I'm way behind. What about you? How many souls you want since you've been in Christ? Christianity just goes from one to another. How many souls you won since you've been a Christian? If you're not winning souls, you're guilty. You are barren. You have brought shame on the church and the gospel. How many people you get out for Wednesday night prayer meeting? You got to get out yourself before you can get somebody out. Y'all don't let me start preaching in here this morning. How many people you get up for a Wednesday night prayer meeting? If you're not doing it, you ought to be ashamed of yourself before Christ. You're guilty. Your place is at the altar. I invite you to come with me for repentance. All right. Now, every service wasn't a repentance service, right? Every service, brother cry out and go to the altar every service. But here's one that he did. &gt;&gt; He got to preach that one. &gt;&gt; Is that right or wrong? &gt;&gt; If we would internalize the quotations, I think we would move a little differently. Now in the message church order, brother Vandom says this here. Now may the Lord bless you all and I trust that this will be carried out to the very best of our knowledge. May the Holy Spirit watch over each one of you. And may every officer of the church fill his post of duty knowing this that God is going to hold you responsible for how you held your office in the church. Each one will have to give an account. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll give an account. The prophet says this 1963, show us the father. Heavenly Father, we have assembled in the in in the name of thy dear son, the Lord Jesus. realize the sacredness of this hour. After it is passed, it'll be history. And we'll give an account at the day of judgment for being here tonight and for what we do. Therefore, Father, we are coming to thee with bowed heads and bowed hearts, asking for mercy, that the great Holy Spirit will come upon us and lead us to what we should say and what we should do. Now, so this thought of preaching the gospel or winning souls or preaching to the lost, there's a there's that purpose. There's the attitude that we should have the attitude to go be willing to go. Then we ask ourselves, how successful are we? You know, the Lord has to he's, you know, we planting water, but God gives the increase. We understand that. And then whatever we have done, we should have done more. I think that's the right balance. It's the right attitude. That way you don't stay rusty. You don't stay overconfident like, "Yeah, we got my look. Last year we we did better than we did last year. That's great, but what are we doing this year? We should be doing more, right?" And I think that's the right attitude. I think that the generation I have many more quotes here, but I'm going to uh land here. I think there's a struggle that we all have to go through and there is that, you know, I have a struggle. You have your struggle. I I said it the other day. It's probably this is probably the hardest age for an individual to sit in a church and listen to preaching. It's probably the hardest age to preach to people that's sitting in a church with all of the distractions. Hardest age to be a young person. Hardest age to be a mother, to be a father, the hardest age just to do anything decent or that's right. You go to do good, evil is there always. But he's given us the power to overcome the enemy. And God is dependent on us. And woe to us if the heathen die and don't know the gospel. And I know that this mission or the the purpose of the church or the responsibility of the church, the God gives us a great warning that that's our responsibility. It's to prayer uh to the word and to Christ. It's a sacred trust that we have. It's a responsibility. It's a burden that's laid upon us. It's our personal accountability. What kind of church are you going to anyways? Huh? What kind of people go there? What's the mission of that church? Are you even interested? Are you even involved? Huh? Is it God's church? it just so random just so happened to be you know there or is there a purpose is there a plan I believe there's a purpose there's a plan there's a mission and I want to take the responsibility thank God for what we have but I believe there should be more &gt;&gt; huh &gt;&gt; Lord give me strength give me grace give me energy give me insight give me revelation give me the tools make me gifted make be talented so that I can win others to Christ so that I can preach the gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, each one will give an account for that. God bless you so much. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word today. We ask you Lord to make these things a reality to us. Father take the few words in simplicity Lord but bring the power behind it to make it a reality to us is our prayer. Oh God, the little burden, the little thought placed upon our heart. Father, I just pray and ask you to develop that and to every every believer, Lord, to be a witness for you to go to preach the gospel to every creature. And Lord, with the power of God that you have built your church upon, Lord, that we're standing for your word and that the Holy Ghost will fall among us and be a part of our praise, our worship, and things that we do. May you grant it, Father. We pray in Jesus name. Jesus, [Music] use me, John. Lord. [Music] Oh, surely I can do even though it's hard [Music] of my will to grow. of the cross be great. I'll work for you. [Music] Dear Lord, I'll be a witness if you will help my weakness. I know that I'm not worthy, Lord of peace. By eyes of faith I see thee upon the cross of Calvary. Dear Lord I cry, let me be thy servant be. Lord Jesus, use me. Oh Lord, don't refuse me. For surely there's a work that I can do. And even though it's humbled, Lord, help my will to crumble. Though the cost be great for you, [Music] I will stand for thee, dear Jesus. Though death may come my way, I'll spread the gospel to the lost each day. [Music] But if it be thy will to go across the sea, Lord, help me to be willing to say yes. [Music] Oh Jesus, [Music] use me. [Music] Please Lord, don't refuse me. Surely there's no work that I can do. [Music] And even though it's humble, Lord, help my will to crumble. Though the cross be great over you, [Music] and he's the lily of the valley. He's the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. He's the beautiful rose of Sharon. He's all the world to me. But best of all, he is my coming king. [Music] Oh Jesus, use me. Please, Lord, don't refuse me. Surely there's a work that I can do. And even though it's hard, held my will to crumble. [Music] Oh, the cross be great power for you. [Music] A vessel of honor for God. A vessel of honor for God. [Music] sanctified, [Music] holy, that I might be a vessel of honor for God. A vessel of honor for God. [Music] A vessel of honor for God. [Music] sanctified [Music] holy that I might be a vessel of honor for God. Yes, a vessel of honor for God. [Music] A vessel of honor for God, sanctified, [Music] holy, that I might be a vessel of honor for more than ever before. Lord, I love you more than ever before. Lord, I need you more than ever before. I want to tell you I love you now more than ever before. Just tell them that one more time. More than ever before. Lord, I love you more than ever before. Lord, I need you more than ever before. I want to tell you I love you now more than ever before. [Music] Lord, lay some soul upon my heart and love that soul through me. [Music] And may I ever do my part to win that soul for thee. Just to win that soul for thee. just to win that soul for thee. [Music] And may I ever do my part to win that soul for thee. Let's sing it again. Lord, lay some soul. Lord, lay some soul upon my heart. Love that soul and love that soul through me. Through me. [Music] And may I ever do my part to win that soul for thee. Just to win that soul for thee. Lord win that soul for thee. [Music] Lord, may I ever do my part to win that soul for thee? [Music] God still moves. Yes, God still moves in the hearts of his people. God still works. He does not sleep, nor does he slumber. God still moves. Yes, God still moves. Oh, God still. Yes, God still moves in the heart of his people. God's the old. He does not sleep, nor does he slumber. God still moves. Let's stand as we sing it one more time. Yes, God still. Oh, God still. [Music] Yes, God still moves in the hearts of his people. God still lives. He does not sleep, nor does he slumber. God still moves. [Music] God still moves. I think all of us can say oh me instead of amen this morning. It's I was challenged. I think this week has been something that I've been thinking about that and we've probably all heard of the young man Charlie Kirk that was had his life taken this week and and just looking at a man 31 years old it's a year older than Tim and just looking at the burden that he had to spread the gospel and you know we can we can sit and criticize but what have we been doing and just think his his wife was giving a speech um the first time that we'd heard from her and she said you know one of the last conversations he had here on this earth he was sharing the gospel with somebody and you know taken in the line of duty and and just I just speaking from myself being raised on a message pew I think we just become a little too too uh much like the Pharisees and we have got so much and if we really believed it we would be telling telling people about what we're so excited about. And if we don't have that fire lit, then this is where we need to be. Lord, just light that fire in me and give me that let people see something in me that they're not seeing some some Pharisee. They're not seeing somebody who's self-righteous, but somebody that is on fire with his joy and with his peace and with his love that that just radiates from our life and and draws people to him and he does the work, but he needs to he needs our hands to use. He needs our voice as we sung at the beginning of the service. He still moves and I want him to move through me. I think that's each of our desire. Brother Joseph Carver, would you come and just dismiss us with a word of prayer this morning? [Music] Thank you, John, for mentioning Charlie. Um, it was uh really hard for us to hear that news cuz we know he spent his life preaching the gospel, sharing the word, and besides political, you know, he's the same age as me and Tim with the family. And it's hard to know that there's so many people that pretty much hate the word or hearing it. You know, we pray for them. We don't hate others. That's all we can do is pray. So, please bow your head with me. Dear Lord, thank you. We come together as a body, as one under your precious blood, your sacrifices that you've made for our souls, our sins, our shortcomings. All we ask is that our prayers are heard. You have ultimate control. We praise all the blessings you give us. We we take a knee. We understand that there's so much evil around us more than ever. We know that the end times are near. There's signs all around us. We can ignore them. We can pretend that they don't affect us, but they are put into our life. And we know that we can back ourselves, our souls, our lives with your word. Please let us keep coming together praising your name. Let us learn from our prophet brother Brandham. He laid out a road mapap for us to save us. And every time we come together, all we can do is say amen, hallelujah. Thank you for all the things you've given to us, the things you've taken from us that did not need to be in our lives and place us in all the right situations to grow stronger in your Lord. We love you, Lord. And the people say amen. Thank you. Amen. Remember the service at 5:00 this evening. Sing that song key of G. When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there. When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and time shall be no more. And the morning breaks eternal bright and fair.

You have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph and of Jonah and the well you often sing. Now there are many, many others in the Bible. I should like to meet them all. I didn't plan. By and by, the Lord will surely let us meet them at that meeting in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet by and by.

All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted at that meeting and in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet by and by.
