[1:03] amen Revelations 6 verse1 and I saw when
[1:07] the lamb opened one of the seals and I
[1:10] heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[1:12] one of the four Beast saying come and
[1:15] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[1:19] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[1:22] crown was given unto him and he went

[2:28] Jesus required it he's got the make a
[2:30] way for it and he has his own
[2:33] blood

[2:42] here at the end time that the Mysteries
[2:46] that begin way back long ago and come
[2:49] down through the church ages is to be
[2:52] revealed here at the breaking of the

[4:17] something that you know you ought not to
[4:20] do and you do it
[4:22] anyhow and Paul said there such in the
[4:25] Earth today workers of iniquity oh if
[4:29] you we're going to get to the let's just

[4:42] falling away first and that m n man of
[4:47] sin be revealed a son of
[4:52] predition right who opposes and exalts
[4:56] himself above all that's called God are
[4:59] they that is worship so that he as God
[5:02] Seth in the temple of God showing
[5:05] himself that he is God remitting sin

[5:12] with you I've told you these things I'd
[5:13] like to set under some of these
[5:15] teachings for you and now you know what
[5:20] withholdeth that he might be revealed in

[5:33] see at the breaking of that seal we know
[5:37] exactly what it was who is this man of
[5:40] iniquity who is this man of sin this
[5:43] fellow that's a working iniquity but he
[5:46] be revealed in his
[5:48] time for the mystery of iniquity does

[6:10] taken out of the way and then shall the
[6:13] wicked one be
[6:15] revealed at the breaking of the seal at
[6:18] his time Paul said not in my time but in
[6:21] the time when you'll be
[6:23] revealed see whom the Lord shall consume
[6:27] with the spirit of his mouth we're going
[6:30] to get to that after a while the spirit
[6:33] of his mouth watch what that
[6:36] is and shall destroy with the brightness
[6:40] of his coming even him whose coming is
[6:44] after the working of Satan him him a
[6:49] man whose working is after the working
[6:52] of Satan with all power and signs and
[6:56] lying
[6:58] wonders and with all dece thisness of
[7:02] unrighteousness deceiving people by
[7:06] unrighteousness in them that perish not
[7:11] this bride in them that's looking for
[7:14] such a thing because they receive not
[7:18] the love of the
[7:20] truth and Christ is the
[7:24] truth and Christ is the word but they
[7:28] better have a cre
[7:31] that they might be saved and for this
[7:35] cause God has sent them strong
[7:39] delusion that they should believe a
[7:45] lie it should be translated there as a
[7:47] look in the Leon the LI not AI the LIE
[7:52] same one he told
[7:54] eeve that they might be damned who
[7:58] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[8:02] in
[8:03] unrighteousness what a statement
[8:07] M after the bride is taken away then
[8:12] this man of sin will reveal
[8:17] himself she the true bride of Christ has
[8:21] been elected out of every Church age now
[8:25] the other day I made a statement the
[8:26] bride could go home and you'll never
[8:28] know anything about it that's
[8:30] true somebody said uh well brother Brown
[8:35] that would be a mighty small group Jesus
[8:37] said as it was in the days of
[8:41] Noah I you talk to him about
[8:44] it wherein eight Souls were saved by
[8:50] water so shall it be in the coming of
[8:53] the son of
[8:55] man if they was
[8:58] 800 went in the Rapture tonight you
[9:02] never hear a word about it tomorrow the
[9:04] next day or no other time it'd be gone
[9:06] you didn't know nothing about it it just
[9:09] be the same thing what am I trying to
[9:12] say I'm not trying to scare you wear you
[9:15] um I want you to be on your
[9:17] toes amen be ready watching every minute
[9:21] quit your nonsense just get out to
[9:24] business with God because it's later
[9:26] than you think now remember the true
[9:29] bride now there is a false bride we get
[9:33] that in Revelation 17 he said I am a
[9:36] widow and have no need of nothing and
[9:38] see sitting up on this scolar cold beast
[9:40] and so forth the Beast rather now but
[9:43] the true bride will be made up of
[9:46] thousands times thousands of people but
[9:50] it will be the elect out of every Church
[9:53] age every time a message went forth and
[9:57] the people believed in an ex deped and
[9:59] all the light it was when they were
[10:01] sealed away until that day of
[10:05] redemption Jesus speaks the same thing
[10:07] when he said the soundc and the seventh
[10:11] watch that's the last Church age and
[10:14] said behold a bridegroom cometh go out
[10:16] to Mee him then the sleeping virsion
[10:18] come rub their eyes and said suppose I
[10:20] already has some that R too so uh maybe
[10:23] you better have some and the real true
[10:25] bride stand there said we just got
[10:26] enough for
[10:27] ourselves we just got enough get in
[10:29] herself we can't give you nothing if you
[10:31] want something you go pray up and while
[10:34] she was gone the bridegroom come and in
[10:36] went the Bri and then the remnant there
[10:39] the ones that were absolutely virgins
[10:41] the church was left
[10:45] outside and he said there will be
[10:47] weeping and wailing and nashing of PE
[10:51] see now that's the elect and when the
[10:55] sound come the bridegroom cometh then
[10:59] every one of those that slept down
[11:01] through those ages
[11:04] awaken
[11:06] everyone see it isn't God as we'd think
[11:09] just go to Honey mount a few thousand
[11:11] people of this age and take them it's a
[11:14] very elected out of every age and that's
[11:18] the reason Christ has to stay on the Met
[11:21] Road seat back here as an intercessor
[11:23] until that last one comes in at the last
[11:27] age
[11:29] and these Revelations and of what it has
[11:31] been breaks forth upon the people and
[11:33] they see what's
[11:35] happened you get it now all right notice
[11:40] the rest of the Dead church members live
[11:45] not again until 1,000 years was
[11:51] passed the church members the the
[11:54] Christian the
[11:56] church live not a again until the end of
[12:01] the thousand years and then they come
[12:03] forth to stand before the
[12:08] bride
[12:10] right stand before the king and the
[12:15] queen
[12:17] Glory some church today calls yourself
[12:20] the Queen of Heaven the Queen of Heaven
[12:22] is the selected bride of
[12:25] [Music]
[12:25] [Applause]
[12:26] Christ and she comes with him Daniel saw
[12:30] it said 10,000 times 10,000s minister to
[12:34] him now if you watch the scripture there
[12:37] in Daniel judgment was
[12:39] set and the books were open now remember
[12:44] when he come he come with his
[12:48] bride the wife ministers to her husband
[12:53] and 10 thousands times 10 thousands of
[12:56] thousands minister to him judgment was
[12:59] set and the books were open and another
[13:04] book was open which is The Book of
[13:06] Life not the bride at all she's done
[13:09] gone up and come back and standing there
[13:13] in Judgment of those Generations that
[13:18] refused the gospel message didn't Jesus
[13:22] say the queen of the South shall rise
[13:24] for this generation in her days of the
[13:26] judgment and will condemn the generation
[13:29] for she came from the utmost parts of
[13:32] the world to hear the wisdom of Solomon
[13:34] and a greater than Solomon is
[13:37] here there stood the uh the Judgment the
[13:41] queen of uh of Sheba of the South stood
[13:46] there in the judgment and her own
[13:49] testimony not even a
[13:51] Jew came up with that generation that
[13:54] was Jews and they were blind and Misty
[13:58] because because they were looking for
[14:00] him but he comes so simple that they
[14:02] want come over the top of it like
[14:05] that and there the great
[14:09] Queen humbled herself and come and
[14:12] accepted the
[14:14] message and she'll stand in the Judgment
[14:17] he said and condemn that generation I
[14:19] see the three classes always the
[14:23] book The Dead were judged out another
[14:27] book the book Book of Life them who had
[14:30] their names in The Book of Life say your
[14:31] names in The Book of Life it's all right
[14:33] huh no
[14:34] sir look Judas is a carot had his name
[14:38] in The Book of
[14:39] Life I say that's
[14:42] wrong Jesus in Matthew 10 gave them
[14:45] power to cast out devils and sent them
[14:47] forth to heal the sick and to cleanse
[14:50] the lepers and raise the dead and they
[14:53] went out and returned back Judas right
[14:57] with them and they cast out devils and
[15:00] done all kinds of Miracles and returned
[15:03] back and said even the Devils is subject
[15:06] unto us Jesus said don't Rejoice that
[15:09] the devil's is subject to you but
[15:10] Rejoice because your names are written
[15:15] in heaven and Judas was with
[15:19] them but what happened when it come down
[15:23] to the elected group to go up there at
[15:25] Pentecost and really receive the Holy
[15:27] Spirit showed his
[15:31] color be there in the Judgment so the
[15:34] books was open and a book the life was
[15:36] open and every man was judged thus now
[15:39] the bride standing there with Christ to
[15:42] judge the word don't the Paul say dare
[15:45] you talking to the bride having any
[15:48] manner grievance against each other that
[15:50] you go to the unjust law don't you know
[15:52] the Saints shall judge the
[15:56] Earth there you are the Saints is go to
[16:00] judge the Earth and take it
[16:03] over right see H in the world a little
[16:07] group like that I don't know how it's
[16:08] going to be done but he said it's going
[16:10] to be done that just settles it as far
[16:12] as I know I
[16:14] know now notice the rest of the Dead the
[16:19] church members dead church members live
[16:23] not again until a thousand years and
[16:25] then at the thousand years they were
[16:27] gathered another Resurrection come which
[16:29] is second resurrection and they were
[16:32] gathered and Christ and the church the
[16:35] bride not the church the
[16:38] bride Christ and the queen not the
[16:43] church church Christ and the bride stood
[16:47] there and they were separated like the
[16:50] sheep from the
[16:53] goats right there's the church members
[16:56] come up and if they heard heard the
[16:58] truth and rejected the truth then what's
[17:01] going to be said when the big things
[17:03] spread across the canvas when even your
[17:04] own thoughts will be there what you
[17:06] thought about
[17:08] it I go escap and it right on the canvas
[17:11] of the skies and God's Great television
[17:14] there your own thoughts rebelling your
[17:16] own thoughts will speak against you in
[17:18] that
[17:20] hour so if you speak one thing and think
[17:23] another you better stop
[17:27] that get your thoughts on God keep them
[17:31] pure and stay right there with it and
[17:33] speak the same thing all the time don't
[17:35] say well I'll say I believe it but I'll
[17:37] go find out you believe it amen notice
[17:42] these type reason they die out they go
[17:46] through the
[17:47] purging of trial of the
[17:50] tribulation because they're not actually
[17:53] under the blood they claim they are but
[17:56] they're
[17:57] not how can they go through a trial to
[18:00] purify them when there's when the
[18:02] bleached blood of Jesus Christ takes
[18:04] every symptom of sin and
[18:08] stuff and you are already dead and your
[18:12] life is hidden him through God and
[18:13] sealed in there of the Holy Ghost what
[18:15] are you going to be judged
[18:18] for where you going to get your
[18:20] purification what you have to be
[18:21] purified from when you're perfectly in
[18:25] Christ
[18:27] sinly
[18:29] how what's the Judgment for but it's a
[18:31] sleeping bunch of them people can't make
[18:33] out now they haven't done it for years
[18:35] see but this is the hour of
[18:39] Revelation being revealed just at the
[18:42] coming of the Bride the last winding up
[18:45] the last things are coming is coming to
[18:47] an end friend I believe when I don't
[18:50] know I I can't tell you but anything I
[18:53] want to live tonight like if it was
[18:54] tonight I'd be ready he might come
[18:57] tonight yet he might might not come for
[18:59] 20 years I don't know when he'll come
[19:01] but whenever it is my life might be over
[19:03] tonight and then whatever I've done here
[19:06] is finished at that hour I I've got to
[19:08] meet him in the Judgment the way I went
[19:09] out here the way the little tree leans
[19:11] that's way it
[19:13] falls remember when they went to buy or
[19:17] they why say now wait a minute brother
[19:19] BR I don't know about that when they
[19:21] went to buy or when they come back the
[19:24] bride was done
[19:27] gone and the door was shut and they
[19:29] knocked and said let us in let us in but
[19:32] they were out and outer dark now if you
[19:35] want to type of that now look in the
[19:39] time of Noah Jesus said referred to it
[19:42] now in Noah's time they went into the
[19:46] ark but they were carried over D during
[19:50] the time of the Judgment but that that
[19:53] didn't type Christ's
[19:55] bride Enoch typed the bride amen Enoch
[19:59] Noah went over through the bride went
[20:03] over through the tribulation period and
[20:05] suffered and become a
[20:08] drunk and
[20:10] died but Enoch walked before God for 500
[20:15] years and had a testimony he pleased god
[20:18] with raptured faith and just started
[20:20] walking right out and went up to
[20:22] disguise and went
[20:24] home without even tasting death never
[20:28] died at
[20:30] all that's a type of we which are alive
[20:33] and remain shall not perent or hinder
[20:37] those same type of people that are
[20:40] asleep that fell asleep on account of
[20:43] human age and a in the state of human
[20:45] age they died back there but they're not
[20:49] dead they are
[20:51] sleeping
[20:53] amen they are asleep not
[20:56] dead and the only thing it needs is a
[20:59] bridegroom to wake
[21:02] them and we which are alive and remain
[21:05] shall not hinder those that's already
[21:08] fell asleep for the trumpet of God shall
[21:12] sound and the dead in Christ shall rise
[21:15] first then we which are alive and remain
[21:17] shall be caught up together with them
[21:20] and will meet the Lord in the air and
[21:22] the rest of the Dead live not for a
[21:24] thousand years there you are they went
[21:26] through the tribulation period what was
[21:28] was like Enoch you know Noah watched
[21:32] Enoch for when Enoch come up missing he
[21:36] know judgment was at hand he got the
[21:40] hanging around the
[21:42] ark but Noah didn't go up he just lifted
[21:46] a little piece off and rote over the
[21:48] tribulations he was carried through the
[21:50] tribulation period to die to
[21:53] day see but Noah was carried through
[21:58] Enoch was translated without death a
[22:02] type of the church being caught up with
[22:04] those who are asleep to meet the Lord in
[22:06] the air and the rest of the church is
[22:08] carried over into the tribulation period
[22:10] take make nothing else out of it
[22:12] myself he not raptured no
[22:26] death

[1:09:51] perfect so he's um going through a
[1:09:55] number of things of what the Old
[1:09:56] Testament said and then he's making it
[1:10:00] more plain for a present day truth
[1:10:03] you've heard it been said Moses said it
[1:10:06] you have it in your laws but I say unto
[1:10:09] you and he really opens it up even
[1:10:12] greater and puts what brother bandam
[1:10:14] calls a magnifying glass on the law and
[1:10:18] opens it up and so be ye therefore
[1:10:21] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:10:25] heaven
[1:10:26] is perfect let us pray Lord Jesus we ask
[1:10:30] your blessings on your word this morning
[1:10:32] bless every heart we pray in jesus' name
[1:10:36] break away every Spirit of unbelief or
[1:10:41] confusion Lord or fear or doubt Lord we
[1:10:45] want to come into your
[1:10:47] presence and Lord uh as you told us many
[1:10:51] times to fear not to fear not and Lord
[1:10:55] we want to come in into that channel
[1:10:57] that you have for us bless every heart
[1:11:00] we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you
[1:11:03] you may be seated as you're getting
[1:11:07] seated there just a little background we
[1:11:11] have been going through this message the
[1:11:13] stature of a perfect man and blasphemous
[1:11:16] names we have uh listened to it or the
[1:11:20] church family has been listening to it
[1:11:22] those that
[1:11:24] could and also um we took the message
[1:11:27] birth pains last week uh Sunday and kind
[1:11:31] of bringing those uh messages together
[1:11:34] that as God is building a church he's
[1:11:38] building a house he's building a man
[1:11:41] he's building a woman through the birth
[1:11:44] and he built Israel the nation through a
[1:11:48] series of births that birth these
[1:11:51] Patriarchs and built the house of Israel
[1:11:55] we see that God is now building
[1:11:58] individuals to be a stature in the
[1:12:00] stature of a perfect man so Jesus
[1:12:03] brought that requirement of perfection
[1:12:07] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:12:09] father which is in heaven is perfect so
[1:12:12] brother Branham takes this message in
[1:12:15] second Peter chapter 1 and takes those
[1:12:18] virtues Faith virtue knowledge
[1:12:21] Temperance all the way up patience
[1:12:23] godliness brotherly kindness and then
[1:12:25] the Capstone he brought that message he
[1:12:28] took takes that scripture and brings
[1:12:31] this image of a pyramid and we know that
[1:12:34] the pyramids or we believe this is how
[1:12:37] brother Adam said it many times we
[1:12:39] believe the pyramids were built by Enoch
[1:12:42] there's many pyramids built all over the
[1:12:45] world many of them have the cap on there
[1:12:47] but the Great Pyramid the Pyramid of
[1:12:49] gizer I believe it's called doesn't have
[1:12:52] a Capstone
[1:12:54] and there's a reason why that Capstone
[1:12:56] wasn't there brother Brandon brings it
[1:12:58] to us as the scripture tells us that The
[1:13:02] Headstone and the Cornerstone would be
[1:13:05] laid and that that headstone would be
[1:13:09] the capping of the pyramid and that um
[1:13:14] there would be a uh capping to our
[1:13:17] pyramid which is love or charity we call
[1:13:20] it and this love is
[1:13:24] our final goal our final destination as
[1:13:26] a Believer is to be sealed placed fully
[1:13:31] adopted Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:13:34] and so brother Ram brings this message
[1:13:36] these series of messages they're
[1:13:39] beautiful the stature of a perfect man
[1:13:41] actually preaches it in October of 62 a
[1:13:46] couple of months later in November of uh
[1:13:50] of of 62 a month few weeks really later
[1:13:54] not not a full month he preaches the
[1:13:56] message Blasphemous names and the
[1:13:59] Blasphemous names message comes from a
[1:14:03] dream that a sister had after hearing
[1:14:07] the stature of a perfect man she had a
[1:14:09] dream a year prior one place he said
[1:14:13] several months and later on he says it
[1:14:15] was a year later so she had a dream she
[1:14:18] sat on this dream for a year you know
[1:14:21] how you have things and sometimes you
[1:14:22] forget or whatever when brother Ram
[1:14:24] preaches statue of a perfect man it all
[1:14:28] comes back to her and then she sends
[1:14:31] this letter in to brother brandham about
[1:14:34] the interpretation of this dream and he
[1:14:36] opens it up and brings Blasphemous names
[1:14:38] and we're so thankful for it amen but
[1:14:42] this uh Matthew Chapter 5 I just want to
[1:14:45] go back a little bit hold your Bible
[1:14:47] just for a moment and in verse number
[1:14:50] 31 and let's just bring a portion of
[1:14:52] what Jes Jesus is saying as he kind of
[1:14:56] lays
[1:14:57] this pretty heavy standard that we
[1:15:01] should all be
[1:15:04] perfect
[1:15:06] and like not like the Pharisees are
[1:15:09] perfect not like brother and sister are
[1:15:12] perfect but as your father in Heaven is
[1:15:15] perfect you need to be perfect so look
[1:15:17] how he sets it up in verse number 31 it
[1:15:19] has been said
[1:15:21] whosoever shall put away his wife let
[1:15:24] him give her a writing of divorcement
[1:15:26] but I say unto you that whosoever should
[1:15:28] put away his wife saving for the cause
[1:15:30] of fornication causeth her to commit
[1:15:34] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[1:15:37] that is divorce committeth
[1:15:40] adultery again ye have heard that it has
[1:15:44] been said by them of old time Thou shalt
[1:15:47] not forwell thyself but shall perform
[1:15:49] unto the Lord thine oath but I say unto
[1:15:51] you swear not at all
[1:15:54] neither by heaven for it is God's Throne
[1:15:57] nor by the Earth for it is his foot stol
[1:16:00] neither by Jerusalem for it's a city of
[1:16:03] the great king neither shalt thou swear
[1:16:06] by thy head because thou can't not make
[1:16:09] one hair white or black but let your
[1:16:15] communication be yay yay NE nay for
[1:16:17] whatsoever is more than these cometh of
[1:16:21] evil nice preaching isn't it
[1:16:24] you have heard that it has been said an
[1:16:25] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[1:16:28] I'm going to get him back he started it
[1:16:30] she hit me first I'mma hit her back she
[1:16:32] started it I'mma finish
[1:16:35] it you have heard that it been said eye
[1:16:38] for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I
[1:16:40] say unto you that ye resist not evil but
[1:16:45] whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
[1:16:48] cheek turn to him the other also and if
[1:16:53] If any man will sue thee at law and take
[1:16:55] away thy coat let him have thy cloak
[1:17:00] also that's a amen Point Let's can I get
[1:17:03] a
[1:17:04] witness who said this who said this this
[1:17:09] is this going to change not going to
[1:17:11] change for me or nobody else this is
[1:17:13] God's
[1:17:14] word and whosoever shall compel thee to
[1:17:17] go a mile go with him Twain give to him
[1:17:21] that asketh thee and from him that would
[1:17:24] borrow of thee turn not thou away you
[1:17:28] know I'm continueing I'm stopping at
[1:17:30] verse 43 you know when I we read these
[1:17:32] scriptures like this I always feel that
[1:17:36] that other side that breath of you know
[1:17:38] brother Israel you need to bring the
[1:17:39] balance on that you know bring the
[1:17:41] balance on that well you didn't even say
[1:17:43] Amen to the word that's before we bring
[1:17:46] any balance say Amen to what he
[1:17:49] said he asked for your Coke give him
[1:17:51] your cloak also
[1:17:53] well what we going bring to balance you
[1:17:55] know if they really do something you got
[1:17:56] to call we ain't talking about that say
[1:17:58] Amen to what Jesus said and that's
[1:18:01] that's a big part of the problem true
[1:18:03] there are exceptions to the rule and
[1:18:06] what we have done has made the
[1:18:08] exceptions the rules yes sir and that's
[1:18:10] when it's a problem there are exceptions
[1:18:13] even in marriage and divorce even in
[1:18:16] with a vow and some of these things
[1:18:18] they're exceptions but that doesn't take
[1:18:20] away from the original commandment
[1:18:24] leave them people out of court leave
[1:18:25] them alone stop trying to fight with
[1:18:27] people and try to win everything and
[1:18:30] when they hit you give them your other
[1:18:32] cheek and let them Smite the other one
[1:18:34] also very difficult to preach in our
[1:18:37] society today very difficult to get an
[1:18:40] amen out of that because we got some
[1:18:42] people that we actually want to hit
[1:18:45] back wow but this is what Jesus
[1:18:50] said look if we can't get through
[1:18:52] through 38 and 39 don't let me read
[1:18:55] verse 48 that we already read we're just
[1:18:58] on verse 38 and 39 he's about to climax
[1:19:01] it to be ye therefore
[1:19:05] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:19:07] perfect here the words of our Lord and
[1:19:10] if any man will sue the at law take away
[1:19:13] thy coat give him thy cloak also verse
[1:19:15] 41 whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[1:19:18] mile go with him Twain give to him that
[1:19:21] asketh thee and from him that would
[1:19:24] borrow of thee turn not thou away you
[1:19:27] have heard that it ha been said thou
[1:19:30] shall love thy neighbor and hate thine
[1:19:33] enemy but I say unto you love your
[1:19:35] enemies bless them that curse you do
[1:19:39] good to them that hate you and pray for
[1:19:43] them which
[1:19:44] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:19:49] that you may be the children of of your
[1:19:54] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:19:58] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:19:59] good and sendeth reain on the just and
[1:20:02] on the unjust for if you love them which
[1:20:05] love you what reward have ye do not even
[1:20:09] the publicans the same and if you salute
[1:20:12] your brethren only what do more what do
[1:20:15] ye more than others do not even the
[1:20:20] publicans
[1:20:21] so be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:20:25] father which is in heaven is perfect now
[1:20:31] we have uh LA on Wednesday we brought a
[1:20:35] message on who is this speaking about
[1:20:39] this great
[1:20:41] messenger that was to come or Christ in
[1:20:44] our age and that there would be a wave
[1:20:47] offering or a sheath offering or what we
[1:20:51] would call one of of us that came to
[1:20:54] maturity We're All Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:57] God we're all striving to be more like
[1:20:59] him Jesus went through this process of
[1:21:02] the adoption in Matthew 17 we see the
[1:21:05] example and here we have in our day one
[1:21:09] that reached this maturity and the
[1:21:12] Reverend William brandham that's his
[1:21:15] picture right there we're not ashamed of
[1:21:17] that his life proved who he was it's not
[1:21:20] for everybody we understand that we
[1:21:22] can't force people to to be something
[1:21:25] that they are not I can't make a lot
[1:21:28] into an Abraham or an Abraham into a
[1:21:31] sodomite can't do it Abraham is an
[1:21:35] Abraham God made him that from the
[1:21:38] beginning actually there's a quote where
[1:21:40] brother random says that that uh even
[1:21:43] you when you were a little boy or a
[1:21:45] little girl there was always something
[1:21:48] in you then that you knew you wanted to
[1:21:51] be a Christian that's right ain't that
[1:21:53] beautiful before you you even know
[1:21:55] anything about church or anything
[1:21:57] there's something within you that wanted
[1:22:00] to do what was right right wanted to be
[1:22:04] in the image of something greater than
[1:22:07] what you are right now and that's a
[1:22:10] beautiful thing because you can't really
[1:22:13] pinpoint when you were
[1:22:16] elected you can't but the Bible tells us
[1:22:20] that before the foundation of the world
[1:22:24] amen amen saints that I chose you before
[1:22:28] the foundation of the world I knew you
[1:22:33] and elected you to be a part and so
[1:22:36] trying to work that out it's very
[1:22:38] difficult to work it out you knew
[1:22:40] something was in you and God had brought
[1:22:42] you up to this and now you come across
[1:22:45] the word the word means more to you than
[1:22:49] perhaps other people that come across
[1:22:51] the same word and it's not our job to
[1:22:54] follow other
[1:22:56] followers God called us to follow the
[1:22:59] leader and the leader should be the Lord
[1:23:02] Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit leading and
[1:23:06] guiding the
[1:23:07] believer and in this process of coming
[1:23:11] to Christ and repenting of our sins we
[1:23:14] hear that there's a word of perfection
[1:23:18] this great message of the hour that we
[1:23:20] call it the message of Malachi 4
[1:23:23] The Last Day message and the prophet
[1:23:25] brings it and preaches it and then he
[1:23:27] brings that Easter message about the
[1:23:30] first fruit the first one that come to
[1:23:33] maturity and shows us that that was a
[1:23:37] son that had been fully redeemed on this
[1:23:40] side of Calvary we know Jesus was the
[1:23:43] original son he was the original first
[1:23:47] fruit of them that slept he rose from
[1:23:50] the grave with all power he was the
[1:23:52] first first fruit but then in our age in
[1:23:54] our generation God got a hold of a man a
[1:23:58] sinner saved by grace Glory Hallelujah
[1:24:02] and we're coming that way too if we stay
[1:24:04] with it and brought him to a
[1:24:08] place where the denominations couldn't
[1:24:11] stop him his past and his healing
[1:24:15] condition and his awkward upbringing
[1:24:18] couldn't stop him that God got a hold of
[1:24:21] him and placed him a Ministry for the
[1:24:24] last day he had to fulfill that
[1:24:28] Ministry and he he preached the message
[1:24:31] one of the messages he preached was um
[1:24:35] uh marriage and divorce before he
[1:24:38] preached that message he preached the
[1:24:40] message a man running from the presence
[1:24:41] of the Lord and then that message he say
[1:24:44] you got to face your
[1:24:47] responsibility he said it it was a
[1:24:49] requirement that he had to he said that
[1:24:52] oh how he would love to just go fishing
[1:24:55] or hunting all the time oh how he would
[1:24:58] love to just go in the mountains with a
[1:25:00] cabin and be a Trapper for the rest of
[1:25:02] his life but he said woe unto me he said
[1:25:04] I got salvation just the same as anybody
[1:25:07] else in the church but he wasn't called
[1:25:10] to be a Trapper he was called to hold a
[1:25:13] two-edged
[1:25:15] sword and present a word to a group of
[1:25:19] people that would believe it amen so
[1:25:22] that's this message that we're in and
[1:25:25] that's what we are are moving ourselves
[1:25:27] into this um you know this and there
[1:25:32] there's there's something to it you say
[1:25:34] brother Israel why is it important to
[1:25:36] bring out who brother brandham was why
[1:25:39] is it important to show and and and I
[1:25:42] mean you're constantly putting the
[1:25:44] confidence of trying to put the
[1:25:45] confidence of the people into that
[1:25:48] Ministry why is that important well well
[1:25:52] get into it in a little bit the Lord
[1:25:53] willing that there is there is a
[1:25:57] rejecting of the stone and the stone
[1:26:00] that gets rejected was the baptism of
[1:26:04] the Holy Ghost and Jesus was rejected
[1:26:08] and in this age he was rejected again
[1:26:12] and the rejection that Jesus faced uh
[1:26:15] the rejection of Jesus in the last days
[1:26:18] is not the rejection of this picture
[1:26:20] right here head of Christ or the other
[1:26:23] pictures that that are made out there
[1:26:25] some nice ones of of our Lord Jesus
[1:26:28] that's not the rejection not the
[1:26:29] rejection of the Bible they're rejecting
[1:26:32] rejecting the word of their
[1:26:35] day okay now this Bible is true can I
[1:26:40] get a witness is it all thus sayeth the
[1:26:43] Lord so when I go back here and I read
[1:26:46] about Noah and Noah's Ark is that thus
[1:26:48] sayith the Lord but is that for this day
[1:26:52] no are we building an ark like that are
[1:26:56] we waiting for another flood to come no
[1:26:59] that was the word of the Lord but it's
[1:27:00] not the word of the Lord for now and we
[1:27:04] all have a
[1:27:06] lot in the
[1:27:08] scriptures in our life that God has
[1:27:11] allotted to us it might be 50 years it
[1:27:15] might be 60 you might be in your 90s you
[1:27:18] might I don't know how long you're going
[1:27:19] to but that's your allotted time to
[1:27:21] manifest that's what God called you to
[1:27:23] do that's your
[1:27:27] allotment and nobody can take your
[1:27:30] place and you can't take anybody else's
[1:27:33] place as much as you would love to see
[1:27:36] Moses face to face or Elijah or any of
[1:27:40] the prophets of the Old Testament as
[1:27:42] much as you wanted to be there on the
[1:27:44] day of Pentecost God didn't allot that
[1:27:46] for you that's right as much as you
[1:27:49] wanted to be here in the 60s and the 70s
[1:27:51] some if you
[1:27:55] were and be up and doing what they was
[1:27:58] doing God did not allot that for
[1:28:01] you what he allotted for you is what
[1:28:04] you're looking at right
[1:28:06] now all the craziness all the beauty all
[1:28:10] of the the technology all of the the
[1:28:14] things that we benefit from that's what
[1:28:16] he allotted to you and and um and that's
[1:28:22] what you're going to be held accountable
[1:28:23] for it's
[1:28:26] sobering it's very
[1:28:29] sobering so let's get into the message
[1:28:31] just for a little bit can I read some
[1:28:33] quotations for
[1:28:34] you now we know in the birth pains that
[1:28:37] was a beautiful message Sunday night
[1:28:39] that you all Listen to I listened to it
[1:28:42] too how many went back and heard the
[1:28:44] whole thing be honest
[1:28:47] one I love honest people
[1:28:50] two thank you
[1:28:52] only two when heard the whole thing so
[1:28:55] let let me say like this okay so when we
[1:28:58] take a tape like that we'll take a tape
[1:29:01] and and I'll I'll break it up I'll take
[1:29:03] off maybe the baby dedications in the
[1:29:05] beginning or testimonies and then I'll
[1:29:07] cut it off right before that last prayer
[1:29:09] because that was the scriptures that he
[1:29:12] was talking about for the message that
[1:29:14] he's bringing but oh there's so much
[1:29:17] more in that message the whole beginning
[1:29:21] of it is another identification how God
[1:29:24] called him and laid his life out and
[1:29:27] showed and Supernatural before he even
[1:29:30] gets to the scripture and so it's the
[1:29:32] same like when we read the Bible I get
[1:29:34] up here and read the scriptures I'm not
[1:29:36] going to read all the chapter or all of
[1:29:38] the context you should go back and read
[1:29:41] that for yourself and so that message to
[1:29:43] birth pains it's a good one to go back
[1:29:45] and hear and listen there's a prophecy
[1:29:48] that goes forth at the end there is a
[1:29:51] war warning a very Stern warning to
[1:29:56] those that heard the word okay so you
[1:29:58] get a chance go and hear that that birth
[1:30:01] pains again I won't say if you got time
[1:30:04] you got time take the time and go and
[1:30:07] hear that birth pains all
[1:30:09] right and so
[1:30:12] um we had been through that and going
[1:30:15] through the birth pains message and how
[1:30:18] um a prophet comes and causes those
[1:30:21] labor pains to come forth it's it's um
[1:30:26] what God does that's how he builds his
[1:30:29] church amen the church is built on the
[1:30:32] labor pain that's how that's how Israel
[1:30:34] was built that's how we are built that's
[1:30:37] how Believers are built those mothers
[1:30:40] were were in labor pains and they
[1:30:43] brought forth those boys and name them
[1:30:46] and brother bandam brings Ephesians
[1:30:48] chapter 4 that the church in the labor
[1:30:51] pain brings forth the gifts it brings
[1:30:56] forth pastors teachers evangelist that's
[1:31:00] where they come from how do you grow a
[1:31:02] preacher or how do you make a song
[1:31:05] leader you you you can train them or you
[1:31:08] go train them or or are they
[1:31:11] born under the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:14] under a call of God in their life that's
[1:31:16] how that's how a song leader is born
[1:31:19] that's how a gift is manifested that's
[1:31:21] how a preacher is made that's how
[1:31:24] teachers and and other gifted
[1:31:26] individuals their birth into the church
[1:31:29] it's not some
[1:31:31] educational uh formula to build a church
[1:31:35] God birs a piano
[1:31:38] player or
[1:31:40] organist if you need a deacon God will
[1:31:43] birth that from the church we don't need
[1:31:46] to go out here and hire somebody to be a
[1:31:49] deacon God's got a deacon where's it at
[1:31:51] that it's in the bows of his word in the
[1:31:54] body of Christ and they come
[1:31:56] forth amen amen exactly right and that
[1:32:00] comes forth through the labor
[1:32:03] pains and it they get intense you got to
[1:32:06] wait you have to pray and then things
[1:32:09] are built and things are are birthed and
[1:32:12] through this great this great birth
[1:32:15] pains God builds the church and he
[1:32:18] actually builds the individual I'm going
[1:32:19] to take a little bit of a message here
[1:32:23] and I'll start in this
[1:32:25] message a man running from the presence
[1:32:28] of the Lord the prophet of God says this
[1:32:31] here paragraph

[1:38:19] fulfill what Isaiah said again the lame
[1:38:21] shall leap like a heart and all these
[1:38:23] things would take place like Moses said
[1:38:26] the Lord your God shall raise up a

[1:39:25] manifested marriage and divorce and all
[1:39:28] of these other Mysteries that's been hid
[1:39:30] under the pillars for all these years
[1:39:33] from the theologians and so forth but
[1:39:35] it's now the
[1:39:37] hour that's the father's business now

[1:40:08] tremendous truths is the father's
[1:40:12] business that's the father's business
[1:40:16] think they would receive it they want to
[1:40:19] be dignified
[1:40:22] and say our denomination don't teach us
[1:40:24] that but the Bible
[1:40:26] does all right let's take the message
[1:40:30] the Easter seal 1965 here what brother
[1:40:32] bamman says
[1:40:33] here just bringing up the age and
[1:40:36] showing us where we are that we have a
[1:40:38] lot and our
[1:40:40] allotment is very
[1:40:43] specific our allotment can't be found
[1:40:46] listening to a Baptist
[1:40:49] preacher are a lot is not going to be
[1:40:51] found online listening to organization
[1:40:54] or denomination and what they call
[1:40:56] important today the mega church Mania
[1:41:00] and all of the big big uh things that
[1:41:03] they're talking about that's not the
[1:41:04] father's business for us we have an
[1:41:07] allotment for the age yes sir and that
[1:41:10] allotment is in alignment with this
[1:41:13] ministry right here yes sir and it is a
[1:41:16] tremendous
[1:41:18] responsibility I tell you right now
[1:41:21] it requires your undivided attention it
[1:41:25] is a very serious calling very
[1:41:28] respectable and there is probably
[1:41:31] Millions would love to have the call of
[1:41:34] God in their life like you have in
[1:41:38] yours how many would love to be the
[1:41:42] elected chosen
[1:41:44] bride how many would love to see what
[1:41:47] your eyes have
[1:41:49] seen and it's a a great calling it's a
[1:41:52] beautiful place it's not a it's not a
[1:41:56] backwards position it's a it's a
[1:41:59] tremendous calling that we've been
[1:42:01] called to it's our allotment it's our
[1:42:03] place and God has given it to us to do
[1:42:08] the father's
[1:42:11] business
[1:42:12] amen
[1:42:15] Lord so as brother brandham couldn't
[1:42:18] call Reverend so and so to find out
[1:42:21] what's next neither can you call right
[1:42:23] Believers so and so to find out what's
[1:42:26] next sir don't work that way your
[1:42:29] instructions come from
[1:42:31] above amen
[1:42:33] somebody that comes from the
[1:42:35] Lord amen so here the prophet of God
[1:42:38] takes in the Easter seal and says this
[1:42:41] here now the paragraph 86 now the holy
[1:42:44] spirit is here on Earth looking out
[1:42:47] those individuals that God has ordained
[1:42:49] to life
[1:42:51] in this age and as as soon as it finds
[1:42:55] it it does just like it did on Jesus
[1:42:58] Christ the great superon of God who
[1:43:01] redeemed us all it comes down and takes
[1:43:04] its place and Abode into the human life
[1:43:07] now notice brought the quickening power
[1:43:10] now that quickening power that come upon
[1:43:12] Jesus quickened him to manifest every
[1:43:16] promise of the word of that day so does
[1:43:19] the Holy Spirit that come upon us in
[1:43:22] this day if it's not a mockery Holy
[1:43:25] Spirit you're not the devil mocking the
[1:43:28] Holy Spirit but it's real true Holy
[1:43:31] Spirit it'll manifest the promise of
[1:43:34] this hour when it fell upon Luther it
[1:43:38] manifested the promise of that hour when
[1:43:40] it fell upon Wesley it manifest the
[1:43:42] promise of that hour when it falls in
[1:43:45] this day it manifests the promise of
[1:43:50] this hour when it fell upon Moses it
[1:43:53] manifested the promise of that hour fell
[1:43:55] upon Noah it manifest the promise of
[1:43:59] that hour when it fell Upon Jesus it
[1:44:02] manifest the promise of that hour see
[1:44:05] it's the Holy Spirit coming down to
[1:44:08] Quicken make alive those people that's
[1:44:11] foreordained of God to be in the
[1:44:16] Rapture this is the true this is he is a
[1:44:21] true Eagle he will understand the
[1:44:22] message of the hour if he's a true Eagle
[1:44:25] now let the little Eagle probably
[1:44:28] brother mam continues on so we see that
[1:44:30] every hour had a word that that was
[1:44:34] anointed for their hour amen it doesn't
[1:44:38] even uh uh change for us it's uh we have
[1:44:43] a word for our day for our hour Lord sir
[1:44:48] amen can I go a little bit further sir
[1:44:52] does God change his mind about his word
[1:44:55] paragraph number 76 the
[1:44:58] message does God change his mind about
[1:45:00] his word
[1:45:01] 1965 and I love that answer no he does
[1:45:04] not paragraph 76 now we find always that
[1:45:08] when these natural and spiritual spirits
[1:45:11] of churches and organizations meet there
[1:45:14] is always a clash it's never failed to
[1:45:18] be so it always CL ases because we find
[1:45:22] that there is a jealousy and in this
[1:45:25] jealousy it causes carnal comparisons
[1:45:28] impersonations and we find it in today
[1:45:31] as it was then when God does something
[1:45:34] for an
[1:45:35] individual everybody tries to copy just
[1:45:38] like God did for that person see it
[1:45:42] causes a
[1:45:44] competition and it makes and it makes
[1:45:47] carnality and then if they cannot the
[1:45:50] other side side get the spiritual
[1:45:52] results then they take it by a political
[1:45:55] power or they substitute something to
[1:45:58] upset the people's minds to draw
[1:46:01] disciples after themselves sound like he
[1:46:03] know what he talking about sound like
[1:46:06] this maybe happen in his
[1:46:08] ministry I believe he knows exactly what
[1:46:10] he's talking about here he is nobody was
[1:46:14] doing it and then now he's doing it and
[1:46:16] then he talked about how everybody had a
[1:46:18] sign in the hand then and everybody had
[1:46:20] a Ministry and everybody had a
[1:46:22] discernment and everybody's a prophet
[1:46:25] now and everybody can say thus saith the
[1:46:28] Lord and but you know that's that's the
[1:46:31] way the carnal comparisons it's jealousy
[1:46:35] it's trying to be something that you saw
[1:46:38] God manifest in somebody else but we
[1:46:41] want to be what God made us don't
[1:46:43] we the prophet of God continues on in
[1:46:48] the
[1:46:49] message oh my trying to do God a service
[1:46:53] without it being his will paragraph 137
[1:46:57] brother bandam says many sincere people
[1:46:59] join an organization or a group or a
[1:47:02] cult of some sort and there they die
[1:47:06] spiritually you can't tell them nothing
[1:47:09] they get that stuff drilled into them
[1:47:11] why these Bishops said this and this
[1:47:13] said this this that this you show them
[1:47:16] right here in the word of God where it's
[1:47:19] thus sayeth the Lord but our pastor I
[1:47:22] don't care what your pastor says don't
[1:47:24] care what I say or anybody else says if
[1:47:27] it's contrary to God's Vindicated word
[1:47:30] the hour the time the message and so
[1:47:34] forth forget it stay away from it and
[1:47:38] I've got to stand before every one of
[1:47:40] you in the day of judgment and you know
[1:47:43] that and little would I say that knowing
[1:47:46] I'm an old man now it ain't that I know
[1:47:49] something but but he knows I just follow
[1:47:53] what he
[1:47:54] said look today at the big Crusades that
[1:47:57] we've had across the land it's proven
[1:47:59] that it's been in vain and didn't Jesus
[1:48:02] say here Luke 7:7 in vain do they
[1:48:05] worship me in vain did David bring the
[1:48:08] Ark Ark up in vain did Ahab train them
[1:48:11] prophets in vain did balum take that
[1:48:13] money teaching for Doctrine the
[1:48:15] Commandments of man it's the
[1:48:17] Commandments of God that count
[1:48:21] no matter how then people are really
[1:48:23] sincere you hear that so much they're so
[1:48:26] sincere that don't mean nothing can I
[1:48:29] get a witness the Jehovah Witnesses
[1:48:32] Seven Day Adventist all those Cults get
[1:48:35] out here on the street and do things
[1:48:38] that one of us wouldn't do Catholics
[1:48:40] stand on the corner and beg and so forth
[1:48:43] those orders of it like that and worth
[1:48:45] billions times billions times billions
[1:48:47] of dollars still beg for it
[1:48:51] sincere no doubt churches go and preach
[1:48:54] and so forth and ministers stand in the
[1:48:56] pull pit and do everything they can to
[1:48:58] get new members into their church but
[1:49:00] it's a new arc there's only one Arc to
[1:49:03] follow that's the word of God anything
[1:49:06] contrary to that Arc stay away from it
[1:49:10] it's on a new cart and not on the
[1:49:12] shoulders of God right stay away from
[1:49:16] the thing don't have nothing to do with
[1:49:19] it
[1:49:21] now God has provided an original way to
[1:49:24] do things and he'll never do contrary to
[1:49:28] that can you say amen amen now he
[1:49:30] promised in the last days that what he
[1:49:33] would do and he sent them us the message
[1:49:37] and it sent them us the message and this
[1:49:40] message would have the same
[1:49:43] identification as Elijah had as Elisha
[1:49:47] had as John the Baptist had and it would
[1:49:49] turn the hearts of the people not to
[1:49:52] denomination but back to the original
[1:49:54] Apostolic fathers back to the word how
[1:49:58] these things have been Vindicated how
[1:50:00] that in the sounding of this last Angel
[1:50:03] Revelations 10 in the last days of the
[1:50:06] seventh angel these Mysteries that's all
[1:50:10] why did the Methodist do this and the
[1:50:12] Baptists and the Church of Christ and
[1:50:14] the Jehovah Witness all do that the
[1:50:17] Mysteries will be revealed in the last
[1:50:21] days when the seventh Angels message
[1:50:24] when he not when he starts out doing
[1:50:27] this but when he begins to sound his
[1:50:30] message see not the years in preparation
[1:50:34] but when he begins to sound the message
[1:50:36] these Mysteries then will be revealed
[1:50:39] and here they are not knowing them and
[1:50:42] you people are witnesses of
[1:50:46] that
[1:50:48] amen praise the Lord
[1:50:50] so we see that you know as God built his
[1:50:54] the natural church and coming up through
[1:50:56] those first Age and and the the first
[1:50:58] age under the Apostle Paul and then
[1:51:01] justification sanctify and building it
[1:51:04] up and we see that God builds the
[1:51:06] individual that same way so these
[1:51:09] patterns they don't
[1:51:11] change uh what God sent in this day was
[1:51:15] for this day it doesn't take away from
[1:51:19] the day that have gone by but it just
[1:51:22] added to that gave us what it was all
[1:51:25] about what yesterday was about why was
[1:51:28] that that way why did it go that way and
[1:51:31] the messenger brings that out to us here
[1:51:35] in this day amen and so we have full
[1:51:40] confidence in that yes sir we rest in
[1:51:42] that message that's the word that that
[1:51:46] that God has built up in us and as he
[1:51:50] builds this ministry through the life of
[1:51:54] brother brandham his ministry of going
[1:51:56] out preaching this one rejects him this
[1:51:58] one has him things open up he didn't
[1:52:01] know what this meant and the Lord
[1:52:02] reveals it we can almost see ourselves
[1:52:05] in him oh yes we see our growth taking
[1:52:09] place as he grew to know who he was and
[1:52:13] the importantance of what his ministry
[1:52:17] was to that age couldn't replace them it
[1:52:21] was a specific Ministry it was all
[1:52:23] through the Bible and we should be able
[1:52:26] to see ourselves in the Bible too
[1:52:29] because if we can see that then that
[1:52:30] pattern doesn't stop behold I send you
[1:52:33] Elijah he'll preach a message to call
[1:52:35] out a bride well what's a bride what's a
[1:52:37] bride look like the people that's
[1:52:39] following this that's the bride amen so
[1:52:45] we see our
[1:52:46] identification in finding out who the
[1:52:49] messenger jur is then we can find out
[1:52:52] who we
[1:52:54] are finding his place finding what God
[1:52:58] did in his life we can see what God is
[1:53:00] going to do in other redeemed sons of
[1:53:04] God's lives brought him to Perfection
[1:53:08] brought him and adopted him made him
[1:53:11] gave him the checkbook and it was a type
[1:53:14] showing what he would do in the rest of
[1:53:17] the Bride coming up amen we could preach
[1:53:21] it with this Authority even though we
[1:53:23] wasn't there many of us were not there
[1:53:26] in the meetings but we came across this
[1:53:28] word didn't we and now this word has
[1:53:30] moved us into this position of knowing
[1:53:34] who we are as individuals so as we take
[1:53:39] uh our our place
[1:53:42] in um this
[1:53:45] pyramid this stature of a perfect man as
[1:53:49] we find begin to find our place in there
[1:53:53] as we go grow closer to the top then sin
[1:53:58] becomes more brilliant it becomes more
[1:54:03] outstanding the little things we used to
[1:54:05] get by with now it it it's it becomes a
[1:54:09] big thing and where we used to be able
[1:54:13] to argue and fuss with people now as we
[1:54:16] mature it's not about winning the
[1:54:18] argument no more amen it's not about
[1:54:21] saying see I was right it ain't about
[1:54:23] that it's about trying to be one with my
[1:54:27] heavenly father to be perfect as he was
[1:54:31] perfect so it shifts from that Backyard
[1:54:35] Brawl with the other church
[1:54:37] members your quote against my quote and
[1:54:40] I saw it first and I was here first no
[1:54:43] no no no no no um we move from that now
[1:54:47] yeah now I'm in my prayer closet all
[1:54:50] right with the word of God in my face
[1:54:53] and I'm on my knees trying to let God
[1:54:55] become one with me that I can be one
[1:54:58] with his word
[1:55:00] amen it
[1:55:03] individualizes it puts us back on our
[1:55:06] knees back to the altar back to crying
[1:55:10] out for God seal me Place me Forgive Me
[1:55:16] Make Me Over Again Build Me Up
[1:55:20] again
[1:55:22] amen puts us back on the potter's wheel
[1:55:25] that's right we thought we made it for a
[1:55:28] little while we thought we were the
[1:55:30] cream of the crop arguing with people
[1:55:33] chest stuck out proud prideful but you
[1:55:38] kept hearing the word didn't you and you
[1:55:40] kept hearing the message and what did it
[1:55:42] do it put you back to the altar amen and
[1:55:46] that's what many of us need to get back
[1:55:47] to Sir back back to the Bible back to
[1:55:51] the message back to Lord Make Me Over
[1:55:54] back to Lord I don't even know I know
[1:55:57] nothing without you lord please make me
[1:56:01] into a son see you've been in it for 40
[1:56:04] years Lord make me a son been in all
[1:56:08] your life Lord make me a son amen I
[1:56:11] can't make
[1:56:13] myself
[1:56:16] amen yes sir amen so this pyramid
[1:56:18] becomes a part of our life amen sir it's
[1:56:22] not just just a message that brother
[1:56:24] brandham preached it's now a part of our
[1:56:29] life can I prepare to close this message
[1:56:32] here prepare to close thank
[1:56:36] you and as we look at this statue of a
[1:56:40] perfect
[1:56:41] man and we know that it's for the
[1:56:44] believer we know the prophet preached
[1:56:47] it um
[1:56:50] there's something he says in the message
[1:56:53] about these stones and pyramids in one
[1:56:57] place he calls those virtues he calls
[1:57:01] them
[1:57:02] stones and I want to pick that up in
[1:57:06] stature of a perfect man paragraph 407
[1:57:13] quickly this is when I get in trouble
[1:57:15] with the girls in the back
[1:57:18] there because
[1:57:22] I wish I could stay on one
[1:57:27] line all right this is at the end of the
[1:57:30] message statue of a perfect man and look
[1:57:32] at this admonition that brother brandom
[1:57:34] gives
[1:57:36] us now in paragraph 405 he says lust for
[1:57:40] money lust for big things Lust For
[1:57:42] popularity these things are dead to the
[1:57:45] believer we don't care a tent or Cottage
[1:57:48] why should I care care live or die sink
[1:57:51] or drown this is the thing I'm
[1:57:54] interested in the kingdom of God whether
[1:57:57] I maintain my house whether I maintain
[1:58:00] my family whether I maintain whatever it
[1:58:02] is let me maintain Christ Our Hope Of
[1:58:06] Glory Build Me Up Oh Lord into this let
[1:58:12] Christ be my head that working through
[1:58:15] me on my Foundation my faith that's in
[1:58:18] him let virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:58:20] patience godliness and brotherly
[1:58:22] kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer
[1:58:27] I don't care live or die sink or drown
[1:58:30] denomination or no denomination friend
[1:58:33] or no friend let that work in me let
[1:58:37] Christ virtue his knowledge flow out
[1:58:40] that I might be able to teach those for
[1:58:46] God has set in the church apostles
[1:58:49] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:58:52] all for the perfecting and bringing all
[1:58:55] these virtues into it for the Perfection
[1:58:59] of the coming of the Son of God each one
[1:59:04] of these stones are a
[1:59:07] material off of that one all right this
[1:59:11] is material of this each one of these
[1:59:14] virtues belong into him and they're
[1:59:18] pouring out out of him down through them
[1:59:23] amen now that's a cry of a real son you
[1:59:27] hear brother vos's
[1:59:29] cry no family no denomination denom sink
[1:59:33] or drown no matter what let me have this
[1:59:39] yes and these stones and we know that
[1:59:42] stones are
[1:59:44] Revelation and we know that those birth
[1:59:47] have to take place in The Believer
[1:59:50] and so look what the prophet of God says
[1:59:53] in the Statue of a perfect man under
[1:59:56] knowledge just quickly and it's
[1:59:58] paragraph 182 and I love
[2:00:02] this because it's you know the building
[2:00:04] of a man the building of a church and
[2:00:07] the
[2:00:08] building
[2:00:10] of a people ready for the Rapture is not
[2:00:14] an overnight thing it's on God's
[2:00:17] timetable and you're not going to go in
[2:00:18] and Rush anything that's good that's
[2:00:20] right you're not going to make God do
[2:00:23] anything or Force this or I must have my
[2:00:26] way I must have the the best church or I
[2:00:29] must be the the best preacher or have
[2:00:31] the best voice to sing I must be the
[2:00:34] best whatever it is not if you're a son
[2:00:39] he's building you and he's making you
[2:00:43] with real material this material you
[2:00:47] can't get at the drugstore you can't get
[2:00:48] it at no Church you can't bribe your way
[2:00:51] into it you can't snot and pouch your
[2:00:53] way into it God's got to birth it into
[2:00:57] you and this is how he build he built
[2:01:00] the churches throughout all the ages
[2:01:02] this way a lot of people gave their life
[2:01:05] for us to get this Bible sacrificed
[2:01:07] their blood gave their time they
[2:01:11] sacrificed and gave and it built up
[2:01:14] through the reformation and Luther wrote
[2:01:17] his thesis and people lost their lives
[2:01:21] you know there's people that did exactly
[2:01:22] what Luther did and they died but Luther
[2:01:26] survived because there was a there was
[2:01:28] an allotment in life that Luther had to
[2:01:30] live out and God placed him there and
[2:01:34] that where he built that church and
[2:01:36] built the church ages and built us to
[2:01:38] the place he builds the
[2:01:41] individual and look at this on knowledge
[2:01:44] how brother brandom says here paragraph
[2:01:46] 180 the word is the revelation of Jesus
[2:01:49] Christ the Bible said so Christ being
[2:01:52] revealed in his own word and if he has
[2:01:54] watched over you when you transgress
[2:01:56] these laws he condemns you for it how
[2:01:59] much more has he watched over his law
[2:02:01] that condemns you that's right amen go
[2:02:05] on boy don't tell me that stuff I
[2:02:08] believe in genuine Holy Ghost
[2:02:12] knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will
[2:02:15] always punctuate the word with an amen
[2:02:20] when you get these things that seem to
[2:02:22] contradict themselves in the Bible you
[2:02:25] sat down and what you do
[2:02:28] study oh my pastor do all the studying
[2:02:30] for
[2:02:32] me you know yes sir this instant answer
[2:02:37] this instant you know know it all uhuh
[2:02:41] right you I ask you how many whatever
[2:02:44] whatever and you guys you'll blot out
[2:02:46] the answer like you just got it like
[2:02:48] that D you got it because you looked on
[2:02:51] Google you got it because you searched
[2:02:53] it up real quick it didn't come from
[2:02:56] within you didn't labor to get it you
[2:03:00] just typed faster than everybody
[2:03:03] else you ask Google y'all ain't saying
[2:03:07] nothing but it's true it's a quick cheap
[2:03:10] answer it's the right answer but did it
[2:03:13] develop any character but when you come
[2:03:16] across something in your life and it's a
[2:03:19] problem and you don't have the real
[2:03:21] answer and then you got to go to the
[2:03:24] prayer meeting looking for an answer
[2:03:27] then you go into the scriptures looking
[2:03:29] for an answer and then you go down on
[2:03:31] your knees and then you'll counsel and
[2:03:34] then you'll pray and then you wait and
[2:03:36] then when God reveals it to you it
[2:03:39] sticks because the cost and the price
[2:03:43] and the time it took for that to go for
[2:03:46] you to overcome that it it really builds
[2:03:49] into you it makes you one with the
[2:03:52] answer you now become one with the
[2:03:54] answer instead of it coming from some
[2:03:56] outside Source you blurted it out
[2:03:59] because that was the right answer it
[2:04:01] didn't come from within have you ever
[2:04:03] heard someone sing a song that you can
[2:04:06] tell they're one with that
[2:04:07] song you ever see that you can say man
[2:04:11] he she is singing her testimony right
[2:04:13] now and then you have people who sing a
[2:04:16] song the song is there they're here and
[2:04:18] they're sing like this but when that
[2:04:20] song becomes inside of you and then you
[2:04:25] sing
[2:04:27] Glory it becomes your
[2:04:30] song and when the amens come from
[2:04:38] within
[2:04:41] amen and
[2:04:43] so this knowledge he says you take you
[2:04:46] find a
[2:04:47] contradiction when you get these things
[2:04:49] that seem to contradict themselves in
[2:04:52] the Bible you sit down you study it and
[2:04:56] prayerfully like that and the first
[2:04:59] thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to
[2:05:01] move in after a while you see it ties
[2:05:05] together and there you got it that's
[2:05:09] knowledge we're not talking about the
[2:05:11] knowledge where you punch it and got an
[2:05:13] answer now you can argue with me we're
[2:05:16] talking about the knowledge that was
[2:05:18] revealed
[2:05:19] and birthed into you then you get the
[2:05:24] answer you can see because these quotes
[2:05:28] we call them eagle feather
[2:05:31] quotes and we try to stick them into a
[2:05:33] buzzard
[2:05:34] nature stick that quote in there stick
[2:05:37] that feather in there why why you doing
[2:05:40] that well the brother just preached on
[2:05:41] it so I got to be
[2:05:42] happy why you raising up brother just
[2:05:45] preached don't raise your hand say just
[2:05:46] ra man you're not even raising your hand
[2:05:48] from with in you raising your hand
[2:05:50] because you sticking that feather
[2:05:54] Hallelujah there's a bigger problem then
[2:05:57] you raising your hand you need something
[2:06:00] to happen in your heart then your hand
[2:06:03] will go up and your praise will come
[2:06:06] from the inside of you
[2:06:09] amen glory amen hallelujah brother
[2:06:14] Brandon brings that illustration many
[2:06:16] times now watch this Buzzard trying to
[2:06:19] put peacock feathers
[2:06:21] in but you want to become one with this
[2:06:25] word so this knowledge under the
[2:06:27] knowledge I'm just going to take that
[2:06:28] one for a moment he he takes this to
[2:06:33] Ephesians chapter
[2:06:35] 5 and he says this
[2:06:40] here I'm sorry under
[2:06:44] godliness he he he he under godliness he
[2:06:47] reads Matthew chap chapter 5 in
[2:06:49] Ephesians chapter 4 which is our message
[2:06:51] here this morning on this Perfection
[2:06:56] perfection in paragraph 304 and the
[2:07:00] statue of a perfect man here what the
[2:07:02] prophet of God says here all right I'm
[2:07:05] winding down honestly I am prar pre
[2:07:09] preparing brother George says sounds
[2:07:12] like another preacher trying to give
[2:07:13] another
[2:07:14] preacher the abuse of
[2:07:17] power abuse the
[2:07:19] time all right paragraph
[2:07:23] 304 in the message statue of a perfect
[2:07:30] man he's talking about godliness and he
[2:07:33] said let's turn to Ephesians 4 and find
[2:07:35] out over here what the a book of
[2:07:37] Ephesians it says about these this thing
[2:07:41] too about how we should do Ephesians the
[2:07:44] 4th
[2:07:47] chapter and begin with the 12th verse he
[2:07:49] gave some Apostles and some prophets
[2:07:51] remember last night don't try to take
[2:07:53] the other man's office see some
[2:07:55] evangelist some pastors some teachers
[2:07:57] for the perfecting of God does it read
[2:08:01] like that congregation says no the
[2:08:03] Perfection of what Saints who are the
[2:08:07] Saints to sanctify ones amen the one
[2:08:11] started from down
[2:08:14] here perfect takes godliness you have to
[2:08:18] add to your faith godliness see you
[2:08:21] start off down here with virtue then you
[2:08:23] go to knowledge then you go to
[2:08:24] Temperance you go to patience now you're
[2:08:26] on
[2:08:28] godliness godliness oh my our time is
[2:08:32] getting away and
[2:08:36] um it brings that
[2:08:39] godliness brings that godliness
[2:08:42] there and now let's get into something
[2:08:46] here now this a lot allotment this
[2:08:49] allotted
[2:08:51] time is the allotment that God has given
[2:08:54] to each of
[2:08:55] us we're here today by his order by his
[2:09:01] command it was his desire to have us
[2:09:04] here today in in in the message statue
[2:09:07] of a perfect
[2:09:09] man par paragraph 340 brother brandham
[2:09:13] says this here the way that God is
[2:09:16] expecting us as an individual ual to
[2:09:18] grow the way he has brought his church
[2:09:21] in to grow every Church age it becomes
[2:09:26] one big church see these fellows wasn't
[2:09:30] required what these fellows are yes this
[2:09:33] wasn't require what this was see but he
[2:09:37] brought his church up the same way he
[2:09:40] brought his church up the same way he's
[2:09:41] bringing his people up then Peter says
[2:09:45] here first seven things Faith virtue see
[2:09:48] come up knowledge Temperance patience
[2:09:51] godliness Brotherly Love brotherly
[2:09:53] kindness and then the love of God the
[2:09:55] Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the
[2:09:58] Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true
[2:10:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got
[2:10:03] all these virtues sealed in you then God
[2:10:08] lives in a tabernacle called the
[2:10:11] building so we
[2:10:12] see that there is a growth that is
[2:10:16] taking place with this message and that
[2:10:20] there is a age
[2:10:23] requirement and our age requirement is
[2:10:27] different than the age that gone on
[2:10:29] before us
[2:10:32] amen so what is our age requirement our
[2:10:35] age requirement is coming to Perfection
[2:10:39] so brother bam takes the dollar
[2:10:42] bill and he said that you know why did
[2:10:45] they make that the Great Seal they have
[2:10:47] the the the the pyramid there with the
[2:10:49] eye on top and then it's got the coat of
[2:10:53] arms on the other side it's number 13
[2:10:56] through all of that that pyramid has 13
[2:10:59] steps all the way up talking about the
[2:11:00] 13 colonies and the the the eagle has 13
[2:11:04] arrows in his Talons and brother Brandon
[2:11:07] brings that out that that even their
[2:11:11] money is
[2:11:13] testifying that this great nation that
[2:11:16] God is King Lord over all of it now the
[2:11:21] the great founding fathers Samuel Adams
[2:11:24] Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were
[2:11:26] the the designers of this the dollar
[2:11:29] bill and all of the writings on there
[2:11:32] you had it took them three years or I
[2:11:34] think it was six years in the making of
[2:11:37] the pattern of the dollar bill and you
[2:11:39] think of them coming over here for a
[2:11:42] religious
[2:11:43] freedom not not all of them but you know
[2:11:46] Freedom means things different to
[2:11:49] different people obviously they're
[2:11:52] trying to escape from under the church
[2:11:55] lordship and be able to worship
[2:11:58] freely but they're coming over here
[2:12:00] taking folks stuff
[2:12:02] too they dealt with the natives a
[2:12:04] certain way and then they had slaves and
[2:12:06] they brought the slaves over and so we
[2:12:08] understand that you know they didn't
[2:12:10] have the true uh they would have come to
[2:12:14] that freedom under the word of the Lord
[2:12:19] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:21] but that initial initial Quest For
[2:12:23] Freedom that was all God they put on
[2:12:26] their their money in God we trust right
[2:12:28] on the dollar there and they didn't know
[2:12:31] why they they didn't have a revelation
[2:12:33] of second Peter 1 they didn't know why
[2:12:37] they put the eye up there the allseen
[2:12:40] eye they didn't know why they had a
[2:12:42] pyramid as our Great Seal as the Great
[2:12:45] Seal of this country but God was
[2:12:47] inspiring and leading them and so now
[2:12:49] when the country has turned against it
[2:12:51] they now laughing at us we still their
[2:12:55] money is testifying against them as
[2:12:58] brother Banner brought he says that that
[2:13:00] that that their money their own money
[2:13:03] testifies against them and he brings it
[2:13:06] into this message as to why that
[2:13:10] pyramid was never CA now the capping of
[2:13:13] these
[2:13:14] Stones if I could just bring this last
[2:13:16] part here the capping of these
[2:13:19] Stones is the capping of the
[2:13:22] individual and the individual now is
[2:13:27] moving where
[2:13:29] God put this pyramid structure together
[2:13:35] without using any
[2:13:38] mortar there's no mortar between them
[2:13:42] and for the next five minutes I'll just
[2:13:44] read some of those quotes on that how
[2:13:48] this these great tremendous stones are
[2:13:51] so perfectly placed in this
[2:13:55] pyramid because there there was no
[2:13:57] man-made mortar to hold it together but
[2:14:00] what holds it together our pyramid is
[2:14:03] the Holy Spirit and this is the this is
[2:14:05] the part of our life that we want to
[2:14:09] pray for the Lord to remove is the
[2:14:14] leaven is the mortar yes is the fine
[2:14:20] frictions that is still uh Waring in our
[2:14:24] members today that we War within
[2:14:27] ourselves and when that is not uh
[2:14:30] answered or dealt with then we go out
[2:14:32] and start flexing against other people
[2:14:34] it carries in our home it carries on our
[2:14:36] job it carries in church it carries in
[2:14:38] any position of service carries in any
[2:14:40] walk every individual has these wars
[2:14:44] within themselves and this is why they
[2:14:46] war with one another
[2:14:48] and the answer to that is this great
[2:14:52] message of receiving the full placing as
[2:14:57] a son where you move into Perfection
[2:15:01] because that's the age requirement can I
[2:15:04] take my time and bring that last
[2:15:06] part this is what God has to
[2:15:11] do now we we can we can argue your point
[2:15:16] you know Perfection I'll never be
[2:15:18] perfect in your
[2:15:19] sight you will never be perfect in my
[2:15:23] sight but we're not looking for that
[2:15:25] Perfection the Perfection we're trying
[2:15:26] to find is the perfection in God's sight
[2:15:30] which is his word all right all right
[2:15:34] Saints uh be ye therefore perfect don't
[2:15:37] you want to be perfect now and have I
[2:15:40] not sent thee
[2:15:42] 1962 brother bam says this here
[2:15:45] paragraph 93 Why didn't that they never
[2:15:48] put a cap on that stone I've been there
[2:15:51] at the pyramid why didn't they put a cap
[2:15:54] on
[2:15:55] it because it was rejected that was the
[2:15:58] Cornerstone where all the other Stones
[2:16:00] was fit together I was speaking of the
[2:16:03] church age look way down here at the
[2:16:05] Lutheran age way back in the majority
[2:16:08] back there just to confess Christ was my
[2:16:11] just means to be a Christian
[2:16:13] justification All Along come Wesley
[2:16:16] sanctification little narrower
[2:16:18] sanctification then Along come to
[2:16:20] Pentecost baptism of the Holy Ghost what
[2:16:22] is it shaping up justification
[2:16:26] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:16:29] now what's he doing that's got to be
[2:16:32] honed out so perfect that the church
[2:16:36] brought into such a place that the stone
[2:16:40] that's coming to fit on top of it see
[2:16:43] what I mean that pictures the church and
[2:16:47] through it it all is the church now
[2:16:49] that's just that's making a parable I'm
[2:16:53] talking about don't try to go into it
[2:16:55] then the next Bible he's talking about
[2:16:57] the the three Bibles the Bible this is
[2:17:00] our word just them signs and things they
[2:17:03] had back there but notice how perfect
[2:17:05] that stone it was rejected they never
[2:17:07] put it on why and you go there them
[2:17:11] stones in that pyramid that weighs
[2:17:14] thousands of tons that is so closely
[2:17:18] fit together you can't put a razor blade
[2:17:22] and no mortar in it so perfectly hone
[2:17:26] together then if that had to be like
[2:17:28] that to make each age fit together then
[2:17:32] what's it going to be when the coming
[2:17:35] don't you see the church shaping up
[2:17:38] Luther justification Wesley
[2:17:40] sanctification then come the Holy Ghost
[2:17:42] and now Church getting honed and fixed
[2:17:47] then without a spot or a wrinkle so him
[2:17:50] that had no spot or wrinkle could come
[2:17:53] down and connect it together for the
[2:17:57] resurrection take that again he says
[2:17:59] don't you see the church shaping up
[2:18:00] Luther justification Wesley
[2:18:03] sanctification then come to the Holy
[2:18:05] Ghost and now Church getting honed and
[2:18:08] fixed then without spot or wrinkle so
[2:18:12] him that had no spot or wrinkle can come
[2:18:16] down and connect it to together for the
[2:18:19] resurrection for the Church of the
[2:18:21] Living God to take his flight into Glory
[2:18:25] yes see yes now we're living in that day
[2:18:30] now John was looking for that to come he
[2:18:33] said I'll know him he's out there I
[2:18:35] don't know where he is he's standing out
[2:18:37] there maybe some bishop and brother Ram
[2:18:40] continues on so he's bringing to us that
[2:18:43] the church now has to be honed for this
[2:18:47] great
[2:18:48] um the one without spot or wrinkle and
[2:18:51] we too are to be without spot or wrinkle
[2:18:55] and that those spots those wrinkles is
[2:18:58] what we're talking about this morning
[2:19:01] it's the mortar is what we're talking
[2:19:02] about this morning it's the it's the
[2:19:05] loose places is what we're talking about
[2:19:08] this morning because the church has to
[2:19:11] be honed for the
[2:19:14] Rapture and that's the importance of
[2:19:17] this message a statue of a perfect man
[2:19:21] Blasphemous names receiving the Holy
[2:19:24] Ghost being sealed and plac let me take
[2:19:27] one more for you in the message
[2:19:29] Blasphemous names he says this here
[2:19:31] paragraph
[2:19:33] 72 Enoch completed it in his day or back
[2:19:37] in that day the pyramid and of course we
[2:19:39] haven't got time to back around and show
[2:19:41] how that that pyramid come up through
[2:19:43] the chambers and so forth it speaks
[2:19:46] right straight to the end time now
[2:19:49] they're in the king's chamber now by the
[2:19:52] measurement but the headstone never was
[2:19:55] put on the pyramid and that sets perfect
[2:19:58] architecturally or masonry until even
[2:20:02] the little thin razor blade that don't
[2:20:06] know how they ever don't know how they
[2:20:08] ever built it don't understand it could
[2:20:11] e could ever a razor blade slice along
[2:20:15] the sides where that mortar should be
[2:20:19] and there's no mortar in it it's just
[2:20:23] perfected put together so that's what it
[2:20:26] is when Christ and the church becomes
[2:20:30] one there's no mortar between there's
[2:20:34] nothing between just God and the person
[2:20:38] God Christ and the
[2:20:42] person now but the headstone they never
[2:20:45] found it you know the stone of scone
[2:20:47] having English so brother B continues on
[2:20:50] so you see the no
[2:20:51] mortar you see what we're talking about
[2:20:54] this
[2:20:55] morning uh do you understand what we're
[2:20:57] talking about this morning that's the
[2:20:59] question the no mortar the that it's
[2:21:03] you Christ and God sealing that
[2:21:09] individual with these precious virtues I
[2:21:14] don't know how how loud to scream it out
[2:21:16] to myself I don't know how loud to
[2:21:18] preach it to this church but that is
[2:21:21] what is going to take place for the
[2:21:24] Rapture that's where we are we're
[2:21:27] flexing against little carnal things and
[2:21:29] people even people I mean people even in
[2:21:33] my own me looking at me I'm flexing
[2:21:36] against people against carnal stuff and
[2:21:39] what is come in our day oh my goodness
[2:21:43] so Saints you know I I don't I'm not
[2:21:46] going to be guilty so it's not you know
[2:21:48] like the the fat man up here trying to
[2:21:53] tell you how to eat right you know Lord
[2:21:55] the the divorced marriage counselor all
[2:21:58] right so you know I'm in the mirror too
[2:22:02] right I'm in the mirror I'm in the
[2:22:04] mirror but this is this is where we're
[2:22:05] at this is our
[2:22:08] allotment we have no other age to
[2:22:11] compare it
[2:22:12] to even 50 years ago let me say this
[2:22:15] even 50 years ago or 40 years ago or
[2:22:18] let's say even 30 years ago
[2:22:22] whoever preached or handled the message
[2:22:25] of the hour like we are doing
[2:22:28] today who had all the message in a type
[2:22:31] format where you can pull all the quotes
[2:22:34] what what generation had that it's a
[2:22:37] different time the message didn't change
[2:22:40] but who who handles what preachers
[2:22:43] handled a message like we handle it
[2:22:44] today what other age had that had could
[2:22:47] afford that who had that
[2:22:52] ability why this is our allotment and
[2:22:55] this is what we're going to be held
[2:22:56] accountable
[2:22:57] to and the days of following other
[2:23:01] groups and other people them days is
[2:23:03] over days of you know the group because
[2:23:06] so and so said that's over yes the days
[2:23:09] of mortar little things that you know
[2:23:12] that's not right and just thinking it's
[2:23:13] okay those days should be over and
[2:23:17] now it's Christ and God and the person
[2:23:24] being
[2:23:25] united with no mortar in it if that
[2:23:28] means I got to go by myself or you have
[2:23:31] to walk by yourself then that's what it
[2:23:34] means if that means a cry or prayer or a
[2:23:37] life before God like never before that's
[2:23:40] exactly what it means and that's my
[2:23:42] little encouragement to you
[2:23:44] today amen amen amen no mortar between
[2:23:49] us I have a level I'll take one more
[2:23:53] okay turn on the light
[2:23:55] 1964 paragraph 109 so ought the Church
[2:23:59] of Pentecost
[2:24:01] today
[2:24:03] asking who is Jesus Christ the same
[2:24:06] yesterday today and forever his light of
[2:24:08] his gospel ought to be shining forth
[2:24:10] with the word of this age revealing
[2:24:12] Jesus Christ to the nation just like it
[2:24:15] was then he was so filled with the Welsh
[2:24:18] Revival till he was the Welsh Revival we
[2:24:22] ought to be so filled with Christ till
[2:24:24] we reflect him in the power of His word
[2:24:28] that's lotted to us to this
[2:24:31] day Brethren don't be stooped in the
[2:24:34] things of the world don't these cares
[2:24:37] that takes you away stay with the
[2:24:40] gospel watch every
[2:24:43] word don't go back to what some father
[2:24:46] said
[2:24:47] let's go right now what Jesus said was
[2:24:52] to take place in this day yes sir we are
[2:24:55] supposed to be the light of this age
[2:24:57] manifest in the gospel Luther was his
[2:25:00] light Wesley was his light Pentecost was
[2:25:03] his light but we're farther up the road
[2:25:05] now we're coming into the bride called
[2:25:08] out the elected remember if you are
[2:25:11] you're just like that officer we had it
[2:25:14] in him he had it in him remember
[2:25:16] remember this is the seventh Church age
[2:25:19] the leoan church age according to
[2:25:21] Revelations 3 they reject Christ of
[2:25:25] every Church age that was mentioned in
[2:25:26] the Bible the Leo deia age was the worst
[2:25:29] of all of them turned him out rejected
[2:25:33] him put him on the outside do you see
[2:25:36] and brother bam continues on we see the
[2:25:39] age that we're living
[2:25:40] in and that's the age that God has
[2:25:43] called us to this is um the age where we
[2:25:49] have been
[2:25:50] lauded to come into the statue of a
[2:25:52] perfect man be ye therefore perfect even
[2:25:57] as my father father in Heaven is perfect
[2:26:00] so we have to be perfect so we've been
[2:26:04] lotted this great message for this a for
[2:26:06] this age and for this hour and there is
[2:26:10] no other group or church that we're
[2:26:14] looking to for an example uh the message
[2:26:18] is our
[2:26:20] example and the token message was
[2:26:24] preached and it had to be put on
[2:26:26] display and brother brandom said I have
[2:26:30] to read this last quote in the Statue of
[2:26:32] a perfect
[2:26:34] man I feel like the church in Phoenix is
[2:26:37] telling me to keep
[2:26:39] going the church in
[2:26:41] tant getting a little hungry for lunch
[2:26:45] maybe but but
[2:26:50] here in in the Statue of a perfect man I
[2:26:53] want you to to take this last one here
[2:26:56] and he says this
[2:26:58] here all right yes
[2:27:13] sir paragraph 4:13 he's come to the end
[2:27:16] of the message there we read The Pledge
[2:27:19] last week I'll pledge to the Lord I'll
[2:27:22] pledge that I'll seek these virtues
[2:27:25] until God calls me home but here he says
[2:27:28] in po paragraph 4:13 says see it's true
[2:27:32] don't let it Escape you hold on to it
[2:27:35] children hold on to that remember build
[2:27:38] upon your faith virtue knowledge
[2:27:41] patience now here I think I had a piece
[2:27:44] of paper here if I haven't dropped it
[2:27:46] somewhere where when I was preaching
[2:27:47] right here it is thank you brother thank
[2:27:50] you very much if you want to look on it
[2:27:52] and see if there's something here that
[2:27:54] you might be able maybe it's a little
[2:27:56] better pattern that that is there that
[2:27:59] you might be able to copy some of this
[2:28:02] off I'll just tack it up here and you
[2:28:04] can sure look at it and type it off and
[2:28:07] I want you to take it and study
[2:28:10] it and compare it and then act upon it
[2:28:16] don't just study it compare it but act
[2:28:19] upon it when you do take it sincerely to
[2:28:24] yourself don't say well I enjoy
[2:28:26] listening at it I did too but listen at
[2:28:30] it and then receiving it is different
[2:28:34] see see it's different see there's seven
[2:28:37] qualifications to make the stature of
[2:28:39] God there's servant seven Church ages
[2:28:41] that God has brought the church to this
[2:28:43] qualification he's had seven Messengers
[2:28:45] to do it there's 777 7 is God's number
[2:28:48] of completion three is God's Perfection
[2:28:51] number so there's three and 7 threes so
[2:28:55] mathematically spiritually by the word
[2:28:58] by the witness of the Holy Ghost all of
[2:29:00] it has completed the thing together
[2:29:04] let's study it now who said
[2:29:08] that Prophet did he said don't let don't
[2:29:11] forget about it and he say well he said
[2:29:15] brother Israel should I study it well
[2:29:18] the prophet said study it he said the
[2:29:21] ministers only that's not what he said
[2:29:23] that's right no no you take it home you
[2:29:26] compare it you study you get your own
[2:29:28] book don't come to church and depending
[2:29:31] on the Bible that's on that screen to be
[2:29:33] your Bible you bring your own Bible you
[2:29:36] get your own notes out and you study it
[2:29:41] and then compare it and then he said to
[2:29:45] act upon it
[2:29:47] that's our job that's what we're doing
[2:29:49] God bless you so much I kept my kept my
[2:29:52] promise there yes I did so God bless you
[2:29:56] amen I trust the Lord will bless your
[2:29:59] heart let us pray Father in heaven we
[2:30:03] thank you for your word this morning

[2:30:16] Lord which is your word I pray oh God
[2:30:20] that that a man-made
[2:30:24] manufactured oh God uh a prescription
[2:30:28] would just
[2:30:29] produce all kind of
[2:30:32] impersonations it would be carnal it
[2:30:34] would be one against this one and it
[2:30:37] would be competition and so forth but
[2:30:39] Lord we we're not in competition with
[2:30:42] anyone we want to be one with you and
[2:30:46] Lord we know that you're building the
[2:30:48] house and the house you're building is
