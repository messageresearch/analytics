========================================

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand? We'll open up in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're honored and grateful to be here this morning, Lord, washed in thy precious blood. Lord, thank you for the grace that you bestowed upon us. Thank you, Lord, for the things that we can hear from your holy prophets. Lord, we're looking for a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells. Father, as we hear some of that today, Lord, we pray that you just sink it deep within our hearts, Lord, and more of a reality than it's ever been before, Lord. Those that may be on the way, we pray you guide them in all safety, Lord. Thank you Lord for that faithful ones Lord that have come to offer the sacrifice of praise and we'll give you all the glory for it in the name of Jesus Christ we ask we're going to continue with the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride we'll start at paragraph 424 and end after 483 be about 20 minutes amen [Applause] Believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. You may be seated. Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; that time just don't stop. No, we're in time. Wait a while. We'll go to eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, holy mountain. There will be streets of transparent gold, avenues, and houses and parks. If you want to read this, Revelation 21:18, the tree of life will be there. 12 different manners of fruit, one each month will be born on it. The people who eat these fruits, you'll change your diet every every month. And it's it's from for only the overcomers. &gt;&gt; Do you know that &gt;&gt; it isn't for the denominations? &gt;&gt; You say you mean that, brother? Let's turn to Revelations 2 just a minute. Fine. Revelations 2 and 7. Let's find out now where it's really the truth or not. Revelations 2 and 7 reads like this. And he that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit, now remember he's not talking to the Jews. Now, this is the church, the gentile. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomemeth, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Overcomers only that overcome the beast. Overcome his mark. &gt;&gt; That's Catholicism, Protestantism, denominationalism. Who overcome the beast, his mark, the letter of his name, you'll have a right to the tree of life to enter into the gates where nothing that defiles can ever go in. See, think of it just a minute now as we go just a little bit farther. Tree of life will be for the overcomers only. The leaves will be for the healing of the nations. That is the kings that live in there bringing their honor in. When they bring their honor in and lay it before the throne of God, just like the outside the 10 11 tribes brought in every one of them a tenth to Levi. Hey, when they bring their honor into the from the blessed land in that, they'll reach from the tree of life, break off a holly leap or tree of life leap and they'll walk out together. There's no more war. Everything's at peace. &gt;&gt; The leaves are memorial for the healings of the nation. &gt;&gt; The same tree, not like Adam, there was a tree of life in the garden of Eden that he might have eaten from if he hadn't fell. That tree of life reminded him all the time that his knew his youth was continually going on. See, same with the nations. These will be for the healing of the nations. Notice not the sickness. Now, you'd have the same rights to have like the dove with the holly leaf. is all each king taking a leap. Notice the river of life. Perhaps many little streams making it up. Now in this earth, I'm going to close just in a few minutes. In this earth, I'm just going to stop. That's how much more notes he's got. About 30 pages. In this in this life, I have never seen nothing so quenching as to be in the mountains and find as I preached on the other night that stream bubbling up. It's lifegiving resource. You'd be tired and thirsty. Fall down by a good stream. Way down where germs can't go. Way down hundreds of feet in the earth is bubbling forth pure genuine lifegiving water. We appreciate that. That's little. Now, the earth has its many streams with refreshing water. When you're thirsting and dying, you get a good cold drink from that, it'll it'll help you to live. But look where this one comes from. &gt;&gt; From the throne. &gt;&gt; There's where it gets its lifegiving resources. comes from under the throne of God where God sits. All of it, all of this earth, this earth here we live in now, everyone, whether it be Christian or pagan, has temples. Did you ever think of that? Churches. All of them. But this one doesn't have any. The Bible said, "And there was no temple there, but the Lord God and the Lamb is the temple of it." Amen. &gt;&gt; The lamb is a light. The lamb is a temple. The lamb is a throne. The lamb is alive. &gt;&gt; He is that temple. &gt;&gt; See, all these temples have an object they're worshiping. But in this city, he is the object. &gt;&gt; He's with his people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His spirit light floods the pyramid city like Peter and John up on top of the mountain. The light covered the top of the mountain and a voice spoke said, "This is my beloved son." In Revelations 21:3 and 4, the tabernacle of God is with man. &gt;&gt; God has tabernacled in man &gt;&gt; by redeeming him by these three processes. Now God is going to redeem the earth and tabernacle in the earth with his subjects of the earth &gt;&gt; which he brought forth from the earth and through sin it fell. But the he had to let it go on but now he sent Jesus to redeem that fallen earth which we are part of. &gt;&gt; Though not one hair your head will perish. &gt;&gt; Jesus said so. He said I'll raise it up again at the last day. &gt;&gt; See why? You're part of the earth know I had the little joke about my wife telling me I lost my hair. I told her I hadn't lost one of them. See where they at? I said well that's where I got them. Everywhere they was a substance. Wherever they are they're waiting for me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll go to them one day. This old body wrinkling and falling dwindling over his shoulders and aching and knees and and horse in the throat. That's all right. You're going to be in the sea but the trumpet will wake me when she Yes, sir. We're going to change one of these days. I'm part of this world that's redeemed. &gt;&gt; You're in the world, but nothing of the cosmos. &gt;&gt; You're in a different order, a redeemed order. Notice the tabernacle of God will be with man. Notice the former things has passed away. This this thing has passed away. This means that heaven has come down to resident with man. Heaven and earth are embraced just exactly when the dove came upon part of the earth which was Jesus. He was the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; Man, God coming from that one little life germ by creative power. And that blood that was in that the life that was in that blood extended back to God. But the blood dripped up on the earth to claim it &gt;&gt; because of the blood that was brought through from the germ cell from Cain. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now he comes back with a creative power just like he did Adam creating Adam. Here's the second Adam. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And through that breaking cell there where sin Cain broke that blood cell upon the just. See now this blood cell because he killed Abel. But Abel was born sex. &gt;&gt; But this wasn't born sex. It was a creation of God. the beginning of it &gt;&gt; and it redeemed the earth and all of the calcium pish petroleum cosmic light that you're made out of is redeemed. &gt;&gt; Not one hair shall be harmed. &gt;&gt; I'll raise it up again at the last day. &gt;&gt; Then what? God comes down to resident upon the earth which he is a part of it. &gt;&gt; His own body. &gt;&gt; He raised it up for our justification. But we're justified believing that accepting that. Notice in types Jesus becomes uh in the type Jesus becomes man God are predestinated to take his place to redeem us to make all these things possible. Notice outside of its beautiful walls of this city. Now have you got the city? Amen. &gt;&gt; See, it's a holy mountain. Nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; The city is not a cube. It is a mountain. &gt;&gt; And the the width by the breadth by the height or equal. See, &gt;&gt; 1500 miles this way, 1500 miles that way, 1500 miles all the way around, and 1500 miles high. &gt;&gt; So, it's just a great mountain like the pyramid, and the city is on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; There's the paradises of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The light of the world. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. That perfect kingdom, not the seventh day, the eternal one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, not the millennium, the new earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; while it's going through the millennium, it's going through its sanctifying process, which still must be burned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which the blood redeemed the people as shows memorial the price is paid that thousand years. But then it has to be cleansed by fire just like you were as delegates of this city, the delegation. So if you die or if you live, what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; If it comes today or it comes 100 years or a thousand years, &gt;&gt; I'll only rest though my change. &gt;&gt; So old man, old woman, don't you be discouraged. If you are representation of here in this attribute of God, this God, if you have if you're representing the earth, you can not you're in the eternal. And if you've crossed from that seventh day into the eighth and got into the eternal by the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you're included in this. Now, if you're just trusting upon a sensation or jump up down or I do this, I keep a seventh day, I don't eat and eat and things like that, that's going to perish in &gt;&gt; But this is the eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the eternal. Right. &gt;&gt; The feast after the feast of tabernacles. See, the feast of tabernacles was the last feast, the seventh feast. We're worshiping now under the feast of the tabernacles, the seventh church age. &gt;&gt; In the millennium, we'll be under the feast of tabernacles again in the seventh day. But then after the seventh day, we have a holy convocation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back into the eternal. How? by the eternal one &gt;&gt; that came and redeemed us and taken us back. &gt;&gt; Let us recognize that we were a part of this. &gt;&gt; Now, how do you know you're a part? Because that the word of the hour, &gt;&gt; the promise of the day. What is it? A restoration back to the first day. The first and he shall restore the hearts of the children back to the father. bringing a restoration again of the Pentecostal genuine not sensations &gt;&gt; and will manifest the evening light. The same sun that showed in the morning &gt;&gt; light &gt;&gt; as promised for the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where are we friends? &gt;&gt; Where are we? Just waiting now to get out of the way so Revelations 11 can be made to known to the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The rapture coming. Watch. Outside the gates of the walls, spread across the new earth. Nations will dwell in eternal peace. &gt;&gt; Honored kings will bring their glory into it. No sin can be there. &gt;&gt; No more bob-haired women will enter that city. &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you that. &gt;&gt; No more short wearing cigarette smoking. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whoreongers, or liars, idolattors, whatever they was, won't enter that city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, it'll all be over. &gt;&gt; Sin will be gone. Nothing to defile its holiness shall enter there. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. All has passed away forever. &gt;&gt; Look, &gt;&gt; out in its fields and around its gates, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; the bear will be gentle. &gt;&gt; The wolf will be tamed. And the lion shall lay down with the lamb. &gt;&gt; And the beast from the wild will be led by a child. &gt;&gt; I'll be changed for the creature that I am with this death worked in my mortal body. Old age sitting. I'll be changed. &gt;&gt; You've heard the song. &gt;&gt; The bear will be gentle. &gt;&gt; The wolf will be tamed. &gt;&gt; He'll not jump up and rare up and try to kill you. &gt;&gt; He'll walk with you down the path. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Who's going to inherit it? &gt;&gt; The redeemed. &gt;&gt; Who would it be? Notice, I can only teach my types now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice, brother Lee, who come out on the new earth with Noah the prophet. Those who went in with him in the ark. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's who walks out on it. Those who went in with Noah by his message was the one who walked out upon the new earth after his water baptism. &gt;&gt; The one who goes in with Jesus. Now, how do you get into him? By one spirit. &gt;&gt; And he is the word. You become part of him. What part of him are you? The word living of this hour recognizing &gt;&gt; you walk out with him in the millennium. &gt;&gt; That's when you walk out. Notice not a new generation, a transplanting. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; notice if God could raise up Elijah and take him up 2500 years ago to transplant him back into the earth again to be a prophet for the Jews, how much more can he do the bride?" Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; After Noah came out of the ark, notice what was said to Noah after he come out of the flood just like it was with Adam before after come out of the new earth. Said multiply and replenish the earth after the flood. Notice was to be fruitful. Replenish the earth as Adam at the first. Now you can see exactly here. Now listen real close. Adam was to multiply and replenish the earth. That right? &gt;&gt; Noah was after the new world destroy it was to multiply and replenish the earth. &gt;&gt; Get it? &gt;&gt; Now can't you see what the serpent seed is? What? Replenish the earth. &gt;&gt; You get it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. You see how Satan got to Eve now? That's why death has reigned on earth ever since. And heaven's, earth, beast, atmosphere is all cursed of God because of it. &gt;&gt; That's the curse because Satan got to this first. Jesus came to redeem it back to the father. In order to do this, he became part of it as I've just went through. And from that very dust, the part Jesus was himself being redeemed. Through him, all of the attributes of God are redeemed with the earth. He was a spoken word. We who are redeemed is part of him. Then if you can recognize, see the Pharisees claimed they were, but you see my first illustration, there was only that by intellectual. They couldn't recognize the word when it was made manifest right before them. They said, "This man's an evil spirit." &gt;&gt; Now today, we're called false prophets. &gt;&gt; We're called every dirty thing could be called &gt;&gt; by religious people. See, &gt;&gt; by great Italian man. &gt;&gt; See, they just don't understand. &gt;&gt; See, it's water baptism wasn't sufficient to cleanse it. Neither is theirs. Sanctification of the blood brought it back. claimed it, but the baptism of the far cleansed it like it did his bride. Like justification, sanctification, baptism, the Holy Ghost never promised to raise up a new race as I've said, but he promised to redeem the fallen. Then that was the the predestinated inherit it as he has promised. And he is the unchangeable God. We know that. Remember God took Elijah after the rapture and translated transplant him back among the people to take the place as a prophet among his people pretty soon. He will do that and has kept him alive these 2500 years. &gt;&gt; He's to appear again. &gt;&gt; Notice again he raised up Moses from the dead. &gt;&gt; Where's his grave? Can anybody find him? Read the book of Jude. See Satan, the archangel disputing with the archangel Satan and said, "Thus the Lord rebuke you, disputing over the body of Moses." And here Peter, James, and John stand there looking at him have transfiguration &gt;&gt; right there in the land where the mountains to be raised up to dwell in seeing he come to redeem it. See, there was the rapture church stand represented. There was the lamb that are asleep represented. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whereabouts? In the city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Up on top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was Peter, James, and John looking on three, a witness. There was Elijah, Moses, and Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a heavenly witness. See, and then there was Moses, the dead have been raised up. There was Elijah, the rapture, was still alive. &gt;&gt; And it was both represented on this holy mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus, the redeemer, when God up above him like this overshadow him, said, "This is my beloved son." You remember Jesus said about a day before that he said, "Verily I say unto you that some who are standing here now will not see death until they see the kingdom of God established in hell." &gt;&gt; What was it? The resurrected dead and the raptured saints together caught up together to meet him in the air with God overshadowing and Jesus standing there in the shadow saying, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well to please. the order of the new kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, sister, &gt;&gt; death doesn't change you. &gt;&gt; Death only changes your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; See, remember Samuel when he was dead and been buried for two years. He was in paradise. And the witch of Endor called him up and Saul recognized him as she did too and fell upon her face. He hadn't changed one bit. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was still the same Samuel after being dead two years. And he was still a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Tomorrow you'll fall in battle and your son with you, but this time tomorrow night you'll be with me." And that's just what happened.

It was just a refreshing of my soul and and uh everything we were talking our way from the from the house to the church. It was like somebody told brother Israel like it was almost word by word. And so this morning I encourage you, you know, brother Brandham says we are we are creators &gt;&gt; and uh depend depending on what your expectations are this morning, that's what you're going to receive. &gt;&gt; So let's all be expecting for something something greater than what we've been having.

Thank you for this time in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, all God's people say, "Amen." Sister Heather and Sister Abigail also have a special prepared this morning. So, we could just sing a chorus as they come up. This goes along with what Sister Lulu just sang. And where else could we go? I've decided to follow Jesus. There's no turning back. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. The cross before me and the world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me, the cross before me and the world behind me, I won't turn back. I won't turn. You can take this whole world. You can take this whole world. But give me Jesus. Take this whole world. But give me Jesus. You can take this whole world, but give me Jesus. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated. &gt;&gt; I just if I if it's okay, I have a two minutes for a testimony. Okay. I guess you all know I just went through a really difficult trial with unexpectedly losing my job. I had a seven years at this place. Never had a single mark against me. Um, you know, no writeups, no disciplinary action. Boss acted like a friend, shared lunches, you know, bought each other chocolate and all of a sudden she got something against me and said, "Today's your last day." Said, "Okay." So off I went. So that um but I knew the Lord was doing something. So I um you know went home, decompressed a few days, thought, "Well, what do I do now?" And talked to a lot of you and everybody was encouraging. The Lord's got something better for you, Heather. Every single one of you. Every one of you said, "He's got something better for you, Heather. And we're praying for you." It was really encouraging to have all that support from every one of you. I really appreciate it. And um Sister Brandy says, "Go update your LinkedIn account. George just got a really good job doing that." So I was like, "Okay, I'll I'll do that." So I did. I updated it, wrote a bio and, you know, rewrote my resume, started applying for every job I could find, signed up for every platform I could find that would send me emails for jobs, wrote so many iterations of my resume, I got got tired of it, but and um finally after about, you know, 7 weeks, I um I had had just one interview, had another one coming up, and like all the pressure of it just kind of came down on me. I just felt like, Lord, I can't take another rejection. I've had so many say, "We're not moving forward with your resume." Interviews that didn't turn into anything. And I just thought, I got to get away. I'd spent the whole day, Labor Day, um, studying this company that I was going to have this second interview with and studying the people on LinkedIn that were going to interview me and try to find something intelligent that I could say, you know, and and just the pressure was a lot. So, I thought, I'm just going to get away. I'm going to go look at the mountains. So, I drove north toward the Catalinas and just kind of, you know, cried it all out. Let it all let it all come out. I was like, "Lord, I I can't handle this pressure. I don't know what to do if this doesn't work out. I've applied for every job I can find and I just need your help." And um started to get dark. So, I thought, "Well, I'll go back home, make myself some dinner, and I'll turn on the voice radio while I'm making my dinner." And I turned it on and Brother Brandham was preaching the uncertain sound. And he was talking about how uncertain everything in life is. Was going down the list, home life, and he goes and right away he says, "And take our jobs for instance." He said, "There's no security in jobs." He said, "Somebody could get something against you. You lose your job, you're gone." And I was like, "Well, that's just what happened, you know." And he went on talking about it for about 90 seconds about how uncertain the jobs were. And I just felt all of that builtup pressure just just completely relieve. And I realized my hope is not in the job. My hope is in Jesus Christ. And I have got him and all is well. And I did have the interview the next day. It did turn into an offer. I've been there almost a month and it's phenomenal. I I love it. It's It's just way better than what I had before. So, he did have something better for me. I believe he honored all of your words and I want to thank you [Music] I've had a dollar to my name and I've had friends who walked away and I've even lost myself a time or two. [Music] There were bridges crossed and burned. But through all the wreckage I have learned, there's one thing that I can never lose. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me and I'll be okay if I got Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I can never hide. A safe place to fall. If I got Jesus, I got it all. I've seen weakness turn to strength and I've seen failures met with grace. And it's not from what I have done. It's Christ in me. &gt;&gt; A miracle I can't explain. Oh, he's given me his name. I'm the richest now that I could ever be. If I got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me and I'll be okay. If I got Jesus, there's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I can never hide. A safe place to fall. If I got Jesus, I got it all. [Music] Someday that trumpet's going to sound and the king of heaven will ride upon the clouds coming down. I'll hit my knees. [Music] I'm going home. [Music] If I've got Jesus, I've got all that I could ever need. Take the world away from me and I'll be okay if I got Jesus. There's a hope that's living deep inside. A joy that I could never hide. A safe place to fall. If I got Jesus, [Music] I got it all. If I got Jesus, I've got it all. [Music] I got it all. [Music] [Applause] Beautiful. [Applause] Amen. You can remain seated. We'll just sing a verse and a chorus of that song, Bula Land. I'm longing for you. Turn the service over to our pastor this morning. I'm kind of homesick [Music] for a country. How many can say that this morning? To which I've never been before. No sad goodbyes will there be spoken [Music] and time won't matter anymore. more of you the land I'm longing for you. [Music] And someday on thee I will stand. There my hope shall be eternal. Oh, beautiful land. Sweet land. Just worship as the musicians continue to play it. [Music] [Music] Bye-bye. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Music] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer. Lord, we thank you. We thank you, Father, thinking of that song, Bula Land that we're homesick for, that country, Lord, where we'll never grow old to that place, Lord, that the prophet spoke of in the great millennium. That's where we're headed, Lord. And we thank you that you've gone to prepare a place for us now, Lord, as we come to this portion of the service to minister your word. And I pray your blessings upon each one. Father, may the Holy Spirit come now and speak to us and give each of us what we have need of. Lord, bless the saints there in Mesa and the others that are streaming the service. Lord, Father, we just commit ourself into your hands for your service. Lord, we have nothing of our own. Simply what you've given to us. Now, we pray that you'll bless us. Now we pray in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord everyone. So good to be in the house of the Lord with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we just uh greet you the lovely name of our Lord and Savior the Lord Jesus Christ. And I believe the all the announcements have been mentioned for the um coming uh work day and so forth that we have coming forward. And um we want to actually be in prayer for our meetings that we're preparing for. I think we just have three more Sundays and uh and then the meetings will be on. So um not a lot of time, but I'm certainly looking forward to the Lord pouring out his blessings upon us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. it's easier just to show up to special meetings. It's far more difficult to host them. And so, um, even when we have our meetings to host the meetings, it's always a little weight. And so, we just pray for the local for the local saints. We just pray that the Lord will give us the strength to um honor him in this great um feast time that we would just thank the Lord for we'll dedicate the building and then we'll just thank the Lord for another 10 another set of years to to worshiping him and praising his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we make that available. We try um sometimes we try to shorten the services, but it seems like we end up adding more, but um we certainly know that we'll get our rest on the other side. You work today, we rest on the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God bless each of you. So nice to see each of you. God bless you originally. Everybody's feeling well. Amen. I didn't get to hear s all of your testimony, Sister Heather, but I'm sure it was good. and I'll go back and hear it. The Lord has done some great things there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Now we can go forward into the word. Let's all stand and turn in the scripture to first Peter chapter 5 and I'll take another scripture over in First Kings 17. Pardon? &gt;&gt; Oh, no, no, no. We have a baby dedication to do. &gt;&gt; So, please, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes. Yes. Oh my. Okay. We have a new nice young man, David. David McFaten. And um, Brother Edward and Sister Bethany. The Lord has blessed them. David Bellamy McFaten. And so as we prepare to go to dedicate this baby, let's get a scripture in Matthew [Music] chapter actually take Mark chapter 10. Verse number 13. And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of God. Verily, I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, and he put his hands upon them, and blessed them. quotation here. Brother Brandham says, "And God keeps his word." 1957, he says, "And now the Lord has given to you this lovely little one. Now you are dedicating it to him, putting it into his arms that God who has give you are returning back to him, giving it to him that he might bless its little life and make it a life of service. make it. Pray that God will make it a child that will bless your heart when you're old. And if Jesus terries, be a great worker for God. And you'll be proud of this. He says, "Little girl, we'll say, little boy, may God grant it now as we take her to bless her." It's a quote. And we pray God will bless little David. We'll read one more in the way of a true prophet. Actually, we'll read this one. In Joseph meeting his brethren, he says, "Because the baby as far as sin has none. Jesus died to take away the sins of the world. And the baby has done no sin. Only it's a sinner. It's born in sin. But when Christ died at Calvary, he took away the sins of the world. And the baby is not responsible until it becomes the age of accountability. And any little baby, no matter how sinful the parents are, as soon as it dies, it goes straight to the arms of Christ. See, because he paid the price. No matter if the baby's born in sin, by adultery, or whatever it is, it makes no difference at all. That baby is safe with Christ because he died to take away the sins of the world. And when it gets old enough now that it's done personal sin, then it has to repent for what it has done. But it has no personal sin until it's old enough to commit sin to know which is right and wrong. But now we always try to stay just as close to the Bible on these things as we know how. &gt;&gt; So we're going to dedicate our little brother David &gt;&gt; um came to the men's prayer meeting this Saturday. Edward wanted him to be here. He came to his first prayer meeting and um early in the morning and the brothers surrounded him and we prayed for him and we thank the Lord for for that and another blessing. So let's sing that song as brother Edward and sister Bethany come. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the little ones to Jesus. The first time I held him was yesterday morning and he was nice and snug over there at the house. But we stood right in the circle right here, a group of brothers, seven or eight of us. and we prayed the prayer of faith over his life and we thank God for that opportunity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Sister Bethany, Brother Edward, bring little David to dedicate him to the Lord. So, let us pray. Dear Lord Jesus, in my hands I hold the fruits of a marriage that you brought together these two hearts, two believers. Lord, through much prayer and much consideration, Lord, they made the choice to follow you together. And you bless this home with this child, little David. Lord Jesus, I pray that the Holy Spirit would govern his life. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; lead him and protect him from all evil, all dangers. And Lord Jesus, if he grows older and time should tar, may he be a great worker for you. May his life be a testimony of your grace and your mercy moving forward the great message of the hour that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Bless him. Bless this home. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at that baby. Isn't that nice? Well, look, he put his little hand up. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. All right, let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. [Applause] All right. Thank you, deacons, for not letting me let that one by. Okay. So, in the scriptures, we want to take in I gave you two, right? Go to Revelations or First Peter chapter 5. Take that one first. Verse one. The elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also are partaker of the glory that shall be revealed. Feed the flock of God which is among you. Taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind. neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being in samples to the flock. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Amen. First Kings 17, the prophet of God takes the scripture in Kings and ministers a message um spiritual food in due season. And verse number two, and the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, Get thee hence, turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. Brother Brham makes a note and he highlights that not someplace else but right there. So he went and did according to the word of the Lord. For he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith that is before Jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, bread and flesh in the evening. And he drank of the brook. And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. Amen. Let's take one more scripture just of the third confirmation in Revelations chapter 2 quickly. and verse number 16. Repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. He that hearath an ear, let him hear with the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden mana and will give him a white stone. And in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. Amen. May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. The title of our message this morning is feed my sheep. Feed my sheep. God bless you. May be seated. Amen. spiritual food in due season. Brother Random takes a number of quotations there and he deals with Elijah and how the Lord provided a place for him to eat good food, clean food while the drought was on. He called for the drought and the prophet goes forward and tells us this is in 1965 that we are in a spiritual drought today. There is a drought in the land but God has provided food for us during this drought. We know that the answer to the drought is food is water. when there is a drought, God uh the cry is for natural in the natural to have water so that it this would uh bring life to us. And no matter how many other drinks that are out there, we can't have any drinks without water. That is the main drink. That's the main source. So when that gets polluted, contaminated and grows scarce, then we could say that is a drought. And we are in a spiritual drought today. The prophet of God makes that very clear to us. And he shows it to us and the scripture shows us that we are in this drought. There is a drought in the land today. now. But I'm so glad that God has provided for us spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Now, um we had a wonderful service on Thursday night there in Mesa. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um um just thinking back on some of those things about the food that we're eating today in the food industry and the lies that are being told to us through the people that sell us food. Um they might say it's healthy. They might put a little heart on there that looks healthy and it might have all of the signs of being good for you to eat, but they will lie lie lie to you to get you to buy something and to consume something that's really not good for you. It's actually poisonous for you. But because of the advertising, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; and the the lust for conveniency, we will find ourselves eating at places that really is not good for our body. And oh, by the way, they're going to build a new place to eat here soon. They're constantly building these little places that you're supposed to eat and you're supposed to sustain your life with. They'll take that can of soda and they'll put a strawberry on there and it says strawberry soda. And you know what's not in the strawberry soda? &gt;&gt; Strawberries. &gt;&gt; Strawberries. But the picture says it's a straw. It's natural apple soda and and all of the deception that goes with the food administration and the food that has been contaminated over and over and over again. And we've heard it, haven't we? &gt;&gt; And we kind of know it, don't we? &gt;&gt; But it's so convenient just to stop and get a quick meal when you're hungry. I'd say it's probably better for you not to eat than to eat something bad. &gt;&gt; Unless you are starving, which all of us are starving. How many use that term Americans? I'm starving. What are the people that are really starving doing? &gt;&gt; Um, it's an epidemic in the natural types, the spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's um really it's really um you're really being victimized. You don't know it, but somebody's got the gun trained at you &gt;&gt; and trying to nail you. &gt;&gt; So, good to see you, Sister Barbara. &gt;&gt; Welcome back. God bless you. And he is after you. He's after your dollars. He's after He doesn't care about your health. Doesn't care about the future for you. Doesn't care about any of those things. He's after the money. He's after your pocketbook. And so, it's just uh you know, that's the natural. We can go on and on and on about that. But it's a type of what is going on spiritually. Also, &gt;&gt; the prophet of God makes this statement in God's power to transform, paragraph 137. And he makes this statement here, and I have several. I can go down this line, but I'm not going to. I'm just going to read this one. Now, how the poison has struck the church, struck the earth, earth, Satan's poison upon the seeds has put cavities in it, and cause it to be deformed more and more. He sinks deeper into the hearts of the churches and in the hearts of the people and everything science science until it's become a place where the human race by being interbred I believe every seed should bring forth of its kind and the human race and the plant and all being interbred has brought us to a place in eating our food from the earth which our bodies has made hybrid It's put our whole minds now if our bodies are failing from 20 to 25 years old because of degenerated cells by hybrid foods. Don't our brain cells degenerate? Isn't that cells also? That's why Ricky runs through the street here with this hot rod while Ricetta Elovita and many of them as we would call name out here half naked before the people mentally gone. &gt;&gt; No more conceptions of decency or morals. Right. &gt;&gt; So, here the prophet of God is bringing to us um spiritual things and and this isn't a a teaching doctrinally. This isn't a a seven seal uh a teaching, but he's actually bringing us knowledge as to what's behind these these special these uh uh uh the hybrid foods that we have today. Amen. And he even connects it to the increase of homosexuality and to and the mental decline among the people today. They're mentally gone. I am just so sad to as our brother Art has a family member that has gone on. It's a really sad story. was in the public news there where this father and his two his two sons had had took the life of this father and I want you to pray for that family. Brother Art put it in the chat there. I don't have the name before me but we're supposed to do that funeral for this man and his two sons uh in their 20s um ended up allegedly murdering their father. So there's all these men are gone out of this one home and one sweep just like that. And it's sad, isn't it? &gt;&gt; But the mental, you know, people can't take no for an answer. &gt;&gt; And the people can't, they have no patience to just really just even just just take a a normal disagreement or even an argument. They'll move a regular argument and they'll go from one to 10 &gt;&gt; and they're ready to pull out something to hurt you and physically harm you over a space in traffic &gt;&gt; over just, you know, looking at them sideways or something and you can lose your life. And this young lady held the door open for this older uh woman hearing the news. And um the old lady held the door open and the young lady didn't even say thank you or didn't say anything. And then the grandmother said, you know, something back to her that you should at least say thank and that young woman took out a knife and killed this woman or gun or knife. I can't remember what it was, but she murdered her over a little disagreement of who opened the door. You didn't say thank you. You can't even say anything to anybody today. It's it's even in the churches. It's even in the churches. The people they'll call you the you know you're my father, you're my mother. You're supposed to care and concern over us. You're supposed to protect us. And then when you try to give that instruction to them, no, they want to flip that. &gt;&gt; And they'll call you the pastor until you that you disagree with them. and the pastor tells them, "No, I don't agree with that." And then they'll turn and they'll flip that. And so you can't even you you're walking on eggshells, you know, you say one little thing, it's on your heart, this is bad behavior, and you go address the young man or the young lady, their feelings are so hurt, they won't come back to church no more. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sensitive. Really? Really? That's the That's the time we're living in. And the Bible said it would be that way. And the hybrid hybridation of the food is a great reason why. And the doctors will tell you this, &gt;&gt; the mental health decline, the obesity crisis, not just outward obesity, but inside the organs, the the stress on your kidneys and your lungs and your heart are taking a hit because of this stress. and the foods that we're eating and the garbage that we're eating and it, you know, something has to give away for that. And the the drugs and all of the medications that are available for every little problem. We want the quick fix or the quick answer to get rid of. you know, they have this and I'm not against it, but they have these, you know, newer ways of what what whatever it is. If it's for your health, for losing weight, whatever, it's always the faster route that we want to take. And you know, if it's if it's good, if it's healthy for you, I say go for it. But I do I I would warn you to examine to see, you know, if it's really healthy for you, if it's really good for you. I was looking on the can of Coke. I I I mentioned this to the church. I think a Coke has 39 grams of sugar in it. And then I looked at Pepsi. And Pepsi usually wins the taste test in short measures. You know why? Because Pepsi is sweeter. Who How many Pepsi people here? How many Coke people say you're more Coke than Pepsi? Okay. It's all poison. Okay. So, 39 grams in the Coke. 41 gram in a Pepsi. 41 gram of sugar. 10 tablespoons of sugar. A teaspoon. 10 teaspoon of sugar in a cup that big. 12 oz. &gt;&gt; And one ain't enough for us. We need 32 ounces of that. We need a super size of it. The coolers can't get big enough. It's like, who's drinking out of that? You the the little camel. What we gonna do next? Put one of those camel backpacks on and fill it with a Pepsi. And when you read what's in that thing, it's poison. &gt;&gt; Your doctor will tell you, your dentist will tell you this. They will tell you it's not good for you, &gt;&gt; but we do it anyway because it tastes good. And this is a crisis. It really is. Really, I'm not here to teach or preach to you on how on healthy eating naturally, but I will say that God gave you one body. &gt;&gt; And when that heart stops, you stop. &gt;&gt; And when those kidneys fail, go good luck finding some more. &gt;&gt; And when your body starts to break down, the one you're supposed to serve the Lord in. &gt;&gt; So, who's behind all of this? Okay, that's in the natural. What about in the spiritual? &gt;&gt; What about in the spiritual? &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Isaiah 28 that all tables are full of what? &gt;&gt; Vomit. What kind of illustration is that there? You're coming to the table to eat something good, something clean, and there's vomit on the table. Now, I can eat some old food. I can eat some food that don't taste good. We can eat food that's not seasoned well, but I am not eating any vomit. &gt;&gt; You are not either. &gt;&gt; And why does the prophet use this illustration that all the tables are full of what? &gt;&gt; Vomit and there's not one clean place. But God has provided &gt;&gt; some hidden food &gt;&gt; in a special place. &gt;&gt; He told Elijah, "Go over here. I'm going to feed you &gt;&gt; there. Over there. Right there. That's where I'm going to feed you. &gt;&gt; Lord, what you going to do? You're going to send a Uber out here? &gt;&gt; You're going to send some kind of uh delivery service? I I got you covered. Elijah, &gt;&gt; I have commanded the ravens. &gt;&gt; One place the crows even &gt;&gt; the ravens, little black birds, to bring you bread and flesh in the morning, bread and flesh in the evening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God blessed the ravens. &gt;&gt; And he kept the voice of Elijah alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about you and I today? God has given us hidden food &gt;&gt; in due season. &gt;&gt; All the tables are full of vomit except for the table. &gt;&gt; You get that? The table app. There's a clean place to get the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; and it's in this message &gt;&gt; and it's hidden from the unbeliever or the makeeliever. But this is why we still have our minds &gt;&gt; and the soundness of our mind. &gt;&gt; It's not because we're smarter than anyone else, but because of the food that we're eating. It's keeping our minds right, &gt;&gt; keeping our thoughts pure, keeping us healthy, &gt;&gt; able to withstand &gt;&gt; and the most wicked of all the ages. This is the most wicked age of all the ages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the worst one. &gt;&gt; But God has given us hidden food. &gt;&gt; Spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God makes this statement in spiritual food in due season. Paragraph number 90 says this here. Now the carnal mind wraps up the thing in their own ideas. Then God sends down and unfolds the thing by his power. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what took place here in the days of Ahab. Now, we find out that Elijah could say that because the message of the hour and the word of God or the messenger, the message, the message and the word &gt;&gt; was exactly the same thing. the prophet, the word, the message, messenger, message and message was the same. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If I do not the works that was written of me, then don't believe me." That's good. &gt;&gt; Any man and his message is one. &gt;&gt; That's why today they don't they don't believe in doing the works of God because they do not accept the message of God. They don't believe the message. &gt;&gt; But those who believe God's hour that we're living in, these things are hidden food. &gt;&gt; Just think, God has so hidden that they look right at it and don't see it. The same way that Elijah blinded the Syrian army. The same way that God blinds the unbeliever from the true genuine food of the child, the believer. &gt;&gt; What they call Noah, a fanatic, building an ark. His eyes were open to the word of God and the promise. The very thing that they call fanaticism saved Noah and his family. See, the very same thing, the thing that people laugh at, is the thing that we pray for. &gt;&gt; The thing that people calls crazy, we call great. &gt;&gt; What the world calls great, God calls foolish. &gt;&gt; And what the world calls foolish, God calls great. It's just exactly the contrast between right and wrong. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Remember, &gt;&gt; he went into his secret place by the plan of God, by the call of God &gt;&gt; and the word of God. Elijah entered into his secret place by God's fornowledge plan and the call upon his life according to the word. And that if that ain't what we entered in, I don't know what we get there. So this is the plan of God. This is your health care plan. &gt;&gt; This is the stability for your mind. This is the psychiatrist for the believer. &gt;&gt; This is the drug that we can't do without. &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; I am the healer. &gt;&gt; I am your healer. &gt;&gt; I am Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; He's the healer of your mind, your body, your soul. He's the healer of everything associated with the believer &gt;&gt; and his name is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, this crisis has hit the people. It's hit the churches. It's hit the land that we're in right now. But God has provided some food for us, the true believer &gt;&gt; that we can feed on. Now he uses the office or the ministry of the shepherd, the chief shepherd which is Christ Jesus and then the prophet shepherd which is the messenger to the age and then the local shepherds is what God uses to feed his sheep. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take a scripture in um St. Luke John chapter 21 actually St. John 21, you turn there to John 21. And if you could on the screen, give me 1 Peter 5:4 just one more time quickly. Sis, I want to read from there just quickly as a quick note. And when the chief shepherd shall appear, so let's start with verse one. And here the apostle Paul he said the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder. So he as an elder is exhorting the other elders. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in verse number four he brings in the chief shepherd &gt;&gt; and he's telling the elders to feed the flock which is what a shepherd does. So we see this order of Paul, the local elders, and the chief shepherd all in this verse here. Can you see that? &gt;&gt; Paul, I'm also an elder. To the elders, feed the flock of God is what he's telling them. Now, St. John chapter 20 uh says this and take verse number which one I want verse number 17, I think. John 21. Thank you. Yes. Verse number Thank you so much. Yes. Let's go up just a little bit. Verse 15. So when they had died, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, "Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee?" He said unto him, "Feed my lambs." He said to him again the second time,"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" He said unto him, "Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee?" He said unto him, "Feed my sheep." And he saith unto him the third time,"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Peter was grieved because he had said unto him the third time, let's just stop there. Peter, you denied him three times. It's only fair that you confess him three times. He said unto him the third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he said unto him, "Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I love thee." Jesus said unto him, "Feed my sheep." Of course, we know the sheep are the adults. The lambs are the younger sheep. So he's commanded to feed the adults and the little ones. This is what the true shepherd is supposed to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what a local shepherd, this is what the prophet shepherd does. He feeds the sheep sheep food. He doesn't she feed them um um he doesn't kick the sheep. He doesn't drive the sheep. He doesn't um feed the sheep just anything. He feeds them sheep food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Bam answers this question and questions and answers. I like the the the detail of it is uh uh uh 1961 questions and answers. Question number 50 153. Brother Brandham, what did Jesus mean in St. John 21:15-17 when he asked Peter if he loved him and told him to feed his lambs then he said feed my sheep and in the 17th verse he said again feed my sheep so well that is merely this see Christ is the shepherd he was going away he was leaving the commission of his sheep which any shepherd feeds which is his flock his church he was leading or leaving the commission with these disciples to continue to feed the flock, to be a shepherd, feed the sheep. In other words, like this, if you look out here this morning, that's what I'm doing. Now, sheep will only grow as you give them sheep food. Now, if you would fry up a big hamburger and give it to a sheep, he couldn't grow on that because, see, that's not sheep food. And if you would fry up, have a nice t-bone steak fixed up, give it over to the sheep, it's not sheep food. He just couldn't eat it, that's all. Because he's a sheep. But sheep like sheep food. Well, then when you're to feed the flock of God, don't feed them on some manmade theology. &gt;&gt; Feed them on the word. &gt;&gt; That's where the sheep grow from. Feed the word. &gt;&gt; Be a shepherd, a true shepherd. Feed my sheep. Lambs is the little ones, of course. Sheep is the adult. So, both young and old, feed the flock of God. See, and feed them with the word. The word, you see, it's the truth. Jesus said, "My uh man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." Is that right? So then if man is to live and they are the flock of God, this the church, then they are to thrive upon the word and manner of God. This is his mana in the Bible. We can just come through it over here in the churches. Jesus is the hidden mana. Christ is the church's mana. What is mana? Mana in the Old Testament was what come down from heaven fresh every night to sustain the church in its journey. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Now in the New Testament, what is the hidden mana? A little while and the world seeth me no more hidden yet ye shall see me. For I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world. And Christ is the hidden mana &gt;&gt; that comes from God out of heaven. A fresh every day. every day. &gt;&gt; You know, when you're feeding on this mana, there's a mystery to your life. &gt;&gt; The outsider looking at you can't really figure you out. &gt;&gt; They don't know how you're thriving. They don't know how you things are moving for you. You have the same issues and problems like others, but you keep moving right on. Why? &gt;&gt; It's directly associated to what you are eating on. The reason you can stand today, &gt;&gt; if you have a praise, it's because of what you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; If you have strength in this hour, it's because of what you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; If you are a believer in this hour, it's because of what you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are what you eat. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're eating on the hidden mana from Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't get this anywhere. &gt;&gt; It's not anywhere, but it's in a special place. It's hidden mana, hidden from the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sheep grow from that's where they grow from. You feed them the word. Be a true shepherd. We can't say, "Well, two weeks ago I had a great experience of God." &gt;&gt; Paragraph 84. &gt;&gt; What about right now? &gt;&gt; See, every day fresh, a new blessing. A new blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Like like bro, you was doing that dance last week. Well, this is a new dance &gt;&gt; because I got a new blessing &gt;&gt; every day. Another fresh blessing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where when she going to stop dancing? She ain't going to stop dancing. When he going to stop d ain't going to stop dancing. It's blessing after blessing after blessing. I'll bless the Lord at all time. &gt;&gt; His praise &gt;&gt; shall continually be in my mouth. &gt;&gt; It's a new blessing. &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't get old. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You waiting for us to be quiet. We just going to get louder. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You waiting for us to stop. We just getting started. &gt;&gt; You're waiting for this to calm down. I can't calm down. &gt;&gt; The blessings keep overtaking me. &gt;&gt; Go to sleep in my night in the night sleep. I'm sleeping. I'm blessed. &gt;&gt; I wake up in the morning. I'm blessed. &gt;&gt; On my way to work, I'm blessed. I'm blessed in the city. I'm blessed in the field. I'm blessed when I lay down. I'm blessed when I get back up again. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I'm blessed &gt;&gt; and I'm eating the hidden mana. &gt;&gt; The mana from on high. &gt;&gt; This blessing you can't take from me. &gt;&gt; You didn't give it to me. You can't take it from me. The world didn't give it to me &gt;&gt; and the world can't take it away from me. &gt;&gt; It's hidden mana. &gt;&gt; It's mana. I didn't know it was this strong. I didn't know it was that powerful. &gt;&gt; I was just sitting in church listening to the tape &gt;&gt; and I heard something that was good and I said amen. &gt;&gt; And when I said amen, that thing hit me &gt;&gt; and got a hold of my life. &gt;&gt; It be to work in my body, &gt;&gt; doing for me what I couldn't do for myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; This word is doing for me what I couldn't do for myself. &gt;&gt; I'm just feeding on it. &gt;&gt; Saying amen to it. &gt;&gt; Then I get out in the out of out in the streets there and there's a strength that comes within &gt;&gt; that I don't know where it comes from. It's hidden from the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's hidden from even your own mind. &gt;&gt; You can't figure out how God has kept you and blessed you and sustained you and kept you clean and such a dark hour. &gt;&gt; It's directly a &gt;&gt; because of the food that you're eating. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are feeding on the body word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; We're feeding on the words of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Eat my flesh and drink my blood and you will have life in you. &gt;&gt; This is what we're feeding on. Satan is not just coming to church. &gt;&gt; We're not just paying our tithe and coming to church. We're actually eating something &gt;&gt; and being sustained by the food that we're The food that we're eating is supernatural. &gt;&gt; It's got vitamins the world don't know about. It's got power that the world don't know about. It's got energy that the world knows nothing about. It'll make a old man young again. He restores his strength. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's the food of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's energy. &gt;&gt; There's vitamins. &gt;&gt; And one of these mornings, &gt;&gt; you'll be eating so full. Then your body will be changed and you'll go on the rapture. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You put on &gt;&gt; immortality. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And your body &gt;&gt; will be changed &gt;&gt; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. This is what we're eating, saints. It's powerful. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; It's powerful. Talk about an energy drink, an energy bar, &gt;&gt; all these little energy things and eat this and stay awake. No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Get This is the energy right here. &gt;&gt; This is where This is &gt;&gt; This is This is going to keep you alive, man. &gt;&gt; This is will sustain you. &gt;&gt; This will keep you moving &gt;&gt; in the army of the Lord. God help us &gt;&gt; to move forward in this &gt;&gt; now. This is hidden to the world. It's hidden to the makebeliever, but the true believer can catch it. Is that right? &gt;&gt; You know these shepherds, Moses was a prophet shepherd. Exodus 3:1 tells us that he was tending the sheep of his father-in-law and God calls him and that's Exodus 3:1. In Ezekiel 34 2-4, it gives a woe to the shepherds that don't feed the sheep properly. In Exodus 34 23, it gives a prophecy of the shepherds that I will set up shepherds for you and give you shepherds after my own heart. &gt;&gt; And these shepherds will feed the the church of God. &gt;&gt; You know, there's some false shepherds out there &gt;&gt; and there's some bad food out there. Yes, I agree. And there's some false things out there. But there's something true. that God has given to us in this hour. &gt;&gt; And my question to you is, what are you eating on will determine what kind of a spiritual strength you have? &gt;&gt; It's directly connected. David was a prophet. The Bible calls him that. In one sense, he was a prophet. In another, he was a king as well. Acts chapter 2 verses 29-30. Let's read that just quickly. My fingers will be in the back there. Thank you. Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you the patriarch David that he is both dead and buried in his supplicers with us today. Therefore, being a what? a prophet, knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne. All of those prophecies in Psalms were a prophetic utterance that Javid got under the anointing. We know in the grander sense of the word of what a prophet is. If you just take the message trying to do God a service without being his will, we see that David was not a prophet in the sense as a major prophet. But he came under the prophetic anointings and he prophesied true things. By the same sense, a New Testament preacher is considered a prophet as well. He's not a prophet in the sense of a prophet uh of of the office of a prophet like um what we call a major prophet but he's prophesying the prophetic utterances of the scripture and bringing in the word of the Lord. Brother Benham says in Elijah and the meal offering, he says this in paragraph 113. He makes this statement. Bless all the ministers that are here tonight. You precious prophets. We pray we pray that you'll anoint them, Lord, and may they be the one you bless bless the homes of these people. All right. All right. So, brother Adam is referring to the ministers here and he calls them prophets. But are they prophets in the sense of uh prophet shepherd? Well, we'd have to say no. We see that there is the office of a prophet and there's a gift of prophecy and there's the prophecies that a minister would do. A and minister is prophetic. It's word. It's absolutely true. And God has established that in the church. So what do we have here? We have the chief shepherd. First Peter chapter 5. We have a prophet shepherd. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we have the local shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet shepherd can't be misinterpreted for the chief shepherd. If you say he's the chief shepherd, then you're saying something that he did not say. and actually going contrary to what he did and what he said. &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus Christ is the chief shepherd. &gt;&gt; He's the shepherd of our souls. A prophet shepherd comes under the chief shepherd. Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then under the prophet shepherd is a local shepherd. Now, that local shepherd is not a prophet shepherd. Doesn't have the authority that the prophet shepherd has. And you don't you can't mix those up. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so with the local shepherd, they're still God's sheep that that local shepherd should be pastoring or leading that flock to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And just like the pastor or the local shepherd is not called to shepherd over the prophet, neither are the sheep called to shepherd over themselves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I brought that last because that's where it's going to get tighter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. the local sheep. We have many of them that sheep and shepherd themselves and they want to hold the local shepherd accountable but they themselves have to be held accountable too. &gt;&gt; God has established a church and that church is set up with pastors, pastor, pastors, apostles, preacher uh teachers, evangelists and those five ministering gifts that we find in Ephesians. And while the age might change and people may change, God's word is not going to change. &gt;&gt; And these shepherds are commanded to feed my sheep. So the care and the concern of the sheep is the responsibility of the great shepherd. And with this great shepherd which is called also the chief shepherd he has a prophet shepherd. And through that prophet shepherd he brings the message down to the people and in that people group is a local shepherd. The chief shepherd Jesus Christ is the leader of all the shepherds. We can call him as we would say king of kings. We call him shepherd of shepherds. &gt;&gt; And we can we can look at him as God the one who sent Elijah the prophet to be the prophet shepherd for this age. Amen. with that Elijah the prophet and all those that are called to be a part of that great ministry. They uh they find their place, they find their position. So what do we see today? We see scattered sheep, scattered shepherds, scattered just doing their own thing. Like in the book of Judges, every man did what was they thought was right in their own minds. &gt;&gt; They're just doing their own thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the accountability is nowhere. They they have no account. But it's it's easier to do. It's what they it's what it's what is allowed now. But the word of God is still there. And I don't know the exact recourse. But I do know if you devi somewhere down the line. &gt;&gt; You can't build this house on part of the word. It's got to be all of it. &gt;&gt; And you can't um uh um fail from bringing all of the word. So, it's not it's not only what the shepherds are saying, it's what they're not saying. &gt;&gt; If they fail to preach the whole council &gt;&gt; of God, they'll be held accountable. &gt;&gt; You're not feeding the sheep properly. You're feeding them the part that you wanted to feed them that was convenient, that's popular for the day. &gt;&gt; But all of the word of God is sheep food. &gt;&gt; And all of the word of God has vitamins in it &gt;&gt; that is necessary for the body change and for the rapture. &gt;&gt; It's all necessary. All the visions, all the quotations, all the scriptures &gt;&gt; are necessary to be on God's table &gt;&gt; for his people to eat from. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the call of God to feed my sheep. It's the demand on the life of a shepherd to feed my sheep. &gt;&gt; What do you feed them? You feed them the word of the Lord. Huh? You know, a sheep can eat other foods. You know that. And there's some foods that's not balanced for him. That's I looked up just quickly. What's the best food that you can feed a natural sheep? And the best food is is primary feed. The best feed is pasture raised feed. &gt;&gt; Can we spell that word pasture for you? Do we pastor-raised feed? &gt;&gt; This is the feed that's growing. It's still alive. If it's out there growing in the field, you let the little sheep, you let the limbs go out there and you go eat. It's a harder process. It's longer. It takes more energy to sustain that. &gt;&gt; But it's the best I in and for the human being, it be from the soil to your table. &gt;&gt; That's the best food you can get. I just picked it off the tree and it's at my table. I'm eating it now. But what the food industry has done today, we have all these middlemen that from the ground it goes into a warehouse and then another place and then another place and they inject it and they spray it and they duplicate. They want it fatter. They want it faster and then send it to another place to another place and you don't know. You don't know where them beans came from. &gt;&gt; You don't know where your food came from. Huh? If you grew it yourself, you would. &gt;&gt; Is that right, Brother Chris? &gt;&gt; Yes. Takes more energy. Takes more time. You got to be involved. Your fingernails got to get dirty. &gt;&gt; You got to be a part of the little seedling coming up. You're interested in it from the beginning to the end. &gt;&gt; And this is how the word of the Lord works. &gt;&gt; Can I take 10 more? All right, mermaid. What time is it? 12:00. &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord is a seed and it has to mature and it has to grow. So let let me let me pull off this message here just for a moment. I have to stop here. God bless you so much. But let me get into something here. I didn't give you this in the back, sis, but this is in the revelation of Jesus Christ. that the prophet preached on bringing the church ages. All right. In there in paragraph number 70 and this will help us with some of the prophecies. I've talked to different ones and people who are concerned. He said, "Brother, there's these quotes and why isn't our church or why isn't the church thriving like it should?" We have these quotes of what should be taking place. You don't see them, right? And but there's an element to a seed that you have to that we must consider. Okay? And this is paragraph number 70D in Revelations chapter 1. It's the brother uh brother Mammal's version. So it's going to be a little bit further back. So I'll start to read it and you can find it for me. Okay. All right. Now, the third verse, he announces the blessing. Look, listen at this. Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of the pro this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein. For the time is at hand. Revelations chapter 1. What time is at hand? Question mark. The time these things take place. when this revelation of Jesus Christ is completed in each church age. Now the reason he wrote it like this if he' said well now they was looking for him if it had been revealed if it would have been revealed to John. Thank you. I'll wait because you all don't listen until it's on the screen. You guys been trained that way. So let's get to 113. That's where it's at. What time is at hand? The time these things take place when this revelation of Jesus Christ is completed in each church age. Now the reason he wrote it like this if he had said well now they was looking for him if it had been revealed if it would have been revealed to John that he was going to come as soon as those churches there was finished. That's the way John thought it. But it was them churches soon as they was finished. If he knew if he had if it had been revealed to him there was going to be seven long church ages, several thousand years or several hundred years, then there wouldn't be no reason of waiting. They just live their church age. Therefore, God spoke it and it wasn't revealed to them. It wasn't revealed to Martin Luther. the things that John Wesley knew about the scripture. It wasn't revealed to the Baptist what the Pentecostal knows about the scripture because it's in a different age. This is a different time. And God reveals his things just in the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, you can't plant corn in the springtime and reap it at the same time. You plant a seed and it grows to maturity. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God plants his word and then it grows right out. Then we look back and say, "There it is." &gt;&gt; Why? Sure, we see it after it's been revealed. &gt;&gt; Can we say that the first gener generation saints things that we see today, they didn't see? &gt;&gt; Could we say that? just following that pattern. Those in 1970 didn't see what those in the 80s maybe saw. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then in the 2000s when the t table app and the message become more available, maybe the ones before didn't see that they not that they don't believe, but they just it's just a different age, different time. Same seed, but it's maturing now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what a revelation does for you. You have to let the seed develop. &gt;&gt; When you take a hold on the seed of the word of God, &gt;&gt; you say amen to it whether you understand it or not. &gt;&gt; But you know the source that is coming from is the word of the Lord. So you stand on it &gt;&gt; and it will be revealed &gt;&gt; in its season. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; Amen. in its season. &gt;&gt; This goes to when brother Brandham says, "I hope I live to see a church &gt;&gt; that he can walk in and there'll be no sin in the place." &gt;&gt; If he lived long enough, he'd like to see it. He He would desire to see it. You can't make the seed develop. You can't plant the seed and then um reap from that same seed at the same time. Can I close with one last scripture? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's take one last scripture as I close. It's in the New Testament. And it's part of what we started with. Did we read that in St. Luke chapter 2? Yeah. This is a coming of our Lord Jesus. Like a Christmas message, you would think at his first coming. Luke chapter 2. Remember all the Old Testament saints was waiting on this prophecy of Isaiah. A virgin shall conceive. There is coming a light to destroy &gt;&gt; the Gentiles. There's coming a light among us. A great king will be born. &gt;&gt; Huh? And those Old Testament saints were waiting on that. There was there was waiting on they were waiting. They were waiting. Generation after generation waiting, waiting. And then when John came, they said, "Is this the one?" He says, "No, I'm not him, &gt;&gt; but I'm going to baptize you in all." The Bible says, "All the region," we had it on Wednesday night. All the regions of people were being baptized. &gt;&gt; How many remember that Wednesday night? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Several regions of Judea and all of Judea heard John's baptism. They got baptized in water. And guess what? They had to be rebaptized again. &gt;&gt; Why would God do such a thing as that? &gt;&gt; Because God's road is like this. We're traveling on the road and there's some turns you got to make and you need a prophet on those turns. &gt;&gt; Stay in the turn with the prophet. &gt;&gt; Don't turn with Reverend so and so, pastor so and so. You stay on the path with the prophetic shepherd. &gt;&gt; That's where our food is. So, let's take this Luke here as we close. We started late, but we'll finish. &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 2, verse 21. Look at this. this verse 20. And the shepherds returned glorifying, praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, and it was told unto them. Let's get these shepherds a little deeper. They got something to say here in verse 15. Let's see what they say in verse 15. And it came to pass as the angels were going away from them into heaven, the shepherd said one to another, what they say? Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see the thing which has come to pass, which what? Read it with me. Which the &gt;&gt; us &gt;&gt; the what did what to you shepherds? &gt;&gt; Which the Lord has made known to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. The Lord's still making things known &gt;&gt; to shepherds &gt;&gt; and people that can't even read maybe. &gt;&gt; This is the beauty of a revelation. &gt;&gt; A revelation has nothing to do with your IQ or your intelligence. &gt;&gt; A revelation has nothing to do with how smart your parents are or how poor or how wealthy. But when a revelation comes, it's the most beautiful thing &gt;&gt; that can happen to a believer. &gt;&gt; It's when God drops a revelation &gt;&gt; to that believer. &gt;&gt; Let's look at the scripture here just for a moment. I have to close here in verse 21. And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was I his name was called Jesus, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. Verse 23. altogether. As it is written in the law of the Lord, every male that open the womb shall be called holy to the Lord. Continue. And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons. And look at this in verse 25. And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel. And the Holy Ghost was upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was revealed unto him, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death &gt;&gt; before he seen the Lord's Christ. And he came by what? Somebody brought him there. &gt;&gt; Somebody took him there. &gt;&gt; He came cuz somebody forced him to be there. He came by what every one of us should be coming to the house of the Lord by. Coming by the spirit. &gt;&gt; The spirit led me. &gt;&gt; The spirit brought me. The spirit of the Lord &gt;&gt; moved upon that old brother &gt;&gt; been revealed to him. &gt;&gt; He gets up from where he's at. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; No church document. &gt;&gt; Nobody's there pushing or forcing him. &gt;&gt; Same one that led him led Abel in the Garden of Eden &gt;&gt; to offer the proper sacrifice by a revelation. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; He's led by the spirit, &gt;&gt; came by the spirit, &gt;&gt; entered the temple. When the parents brought him into the child to Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law, then took he up in his arms and blessed God and said like we did little David this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, now let us thy servant depart in peace according to thy word. For my eyes have seen &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; thy salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A revelation. Let me close with this, saints. A revelation is personal. &gt;&gt; It's personal. &gt;&gt; You either got one or you don't. If you got one, you can stand alone. If you don't have one, you're following a group. &gt;&gt; But if you got a revelation and it comes from above, that is what the entire church is built upon. &gt;&gt; The spiritual revealed truth of the word of God. And this revelation is what we're feeding on. &gt;&gt; There's a quote where brother Banner says, "God never called the shepherds to educate his sheep, but to feed the sheep." Amen. &gt;&gt; And part of the message, yes, it's education. Yes, we read it. We read the quote. We read the scripture. But that scripture, that quote needs to become a revelation. &gt;&gt; And when it becomes a revelation, &gt;&gt; it becomes food. &gt;&gt; And it's food that keeps you alive. &gt;&gt; Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. &gt;&gt; God richly bless you. Amen. God richly bless you. Let us bow our heads a word of prayer. Hallelujah. Is there anyone here today that needs a revelation? Oh my. Did you know not not only is the church built upon it, every individual is built upon it, the entire Bible is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there anyone here that needs a revelation? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or have you received all the revelation that you need? There's more revelation for you, my brother, my sister. There's a revelation for you. And when it's revealed to you, it's the hidden mana. It becomes food. &gt;&gt; Food &gt;&gt; down in your soul to give you that healthy diet that you need to overcome. Heavenly Father, thank you for the hands that are raised here this morning. I pray, oh God, that you would open up your word to each one from the little lambs to the bigger sheep. Lord, may each one refine find some pasture-raised grain food from that's alive for the sheep as my prayer. Oh God, forgive us where we have failed you, Lord. But establish us in this hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Establish us, Lord, with the healthy di. establish our mind, our our bodies on the word of the Lord. It's my prayer. May you grant these blessings to each one. We love you, Father. Oh God, hear and answer our requests, our needs. I fed on the word of God and found out that you was a healer. I fed on the word of God one day and I found out you was a savior. I fed on the word and I found out you'll be a friend when I didn't have one. I fed on the word of God and I found out that you love me, Lord. Oh God, I just pray that you'll bless each one to move forward in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you, brother John. Thank you. [Music] Amen. Amen. Maybe we could just stand together this morning. I was thinking of that of course. Fill my cup, Lord. Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more. Just fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. [Music] Come and quench this thirst in my soul. [Music] Bread of heaven, just feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Sing it one more time. Just fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. Come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Oh, bread off of heaven. Just feed me till I want no more. Here's my cup. &gt;&gt; Fill it up and make me whole. Amen. I wasn't able to pull it up, but just thinking this morning Ezekiel 34 and maybe you could put up there. I think it was about verse 23. I'm not able to get connection on my on my iPad, but this was a chapter in the Bible that was an admonition to the shepherds of Israel. And it was a warning to those that didn't feed God's sheep, but also promises to the sheep. And so this is towards the end of the chapter, it starts. It says, "I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them. Even my servant David, he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I, the Lord will be their God, and my servant David, a prince among them. I, the Lord, have spoken it. And I will make them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beast to cease out of the land, and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And I'll make them, and the places round about my hill of blessing, and will cause the shower to come down in his season. There shall be showers of blessing. So, I am just so thankful for that. And I wanted to sing that song this morning. But just in context of there shall be showers of blessings. It's this fresh mana that we're getting &gt;&gt; and pasture-raised food. There shall be showers of blessing. This is the promise of love. There shall be seasons refreshing sent from the Savior above. Showers of blessing. Showers of blessing we need. Mercy drops round us are falling. But for the showers we flee. There shall be showers of blessing. Precious reviving again. Over the hills and the valley, it's the sound of abundance of rain, showers of blessing, showers of blessing we need. Mercy drops round us are falling but for the showers we flee and there shall be showers of blessing send them upon us oh Lord grant to us now a refreshing come and now honor thy Yes. Showers of blessings. Showers of blessings we need. Mercy drops round us are falling. But for the showers we plead. The last verse. And there shall be showers of blessing. Oh that today they might fall. Now as to God we're confessing now as on Jesus we fall. Showers of blessing. Showers of blessings we need. [Music] Mercy drops around us are falling but for the shower. Listen to the words of this one. And there shall be showers of blessing if we but trust and oy. There shall be seasons refreshing. [Music] If we let God have his way, as showers of blessing, showers of blessings we need, mercy drops around us are falling, but for the showers. Sing that chorus one more time. Oh yes. Showers of blessing. Showers of blessings we need. Mercy drops round us are falling. But for the showers we flee. Amen. Brother Jonathan, would you come and dismiss us with a word of prayer this afternoon? Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Bless you brothers and sisters. Let us bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, we come before you Lord, thanking you for your word today as you always feed us with due man in season. Lord. Oh Lord, we're just humble people, little lambs. Lord, looking up to the big to the big sheep just leading us here, guiding our steps daily. Lord, we ask that you bless the families here, brothers and sisters, the young ones who are not feeling well, those who are in need of your spiritual food in due season. Lord, watch over us and protect us daily. Lord, give us the desires of our hearts if they're pure and only for you. Lord, ask that you watch uh watch over the the elders here, those who are feeble, for they're in need, too, Father. And just fill us with your Holy Spirit daily and give us a new refreshing just like the ravens, Lord. Just constantly, you're always there, Lord, doing it your way, not our way. bless their pastor, the song leader, and and those who play the instruments. Father, watch over their families and our young brother who is dedicated today. May you fill him with the Holy Spirit and guide his steps daily, Lord. And bless his family and uh little David. We bring them before you, Lord. We ask these things in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. [Music] Amen. Maybe we could switch to the key of E flat. Sister Sharon, we'll sing at manifesting time before we go. Hear the voice of my beloved. Behold, he quickly comes, sweeping over the mountains, over the hills he runs. I long to hear his voice. I long to hear him say, "Arise, my love, my fair one. Come away. Oh, it's manifesting time. The fruits are on the vine and the lovely one is coming in plain view. Oh, cap. God's chosen bride. Redemption draw at night. He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view. The grapes are yours and mine. My little fox spoil the vine. For the vineyard blossoms for the harvest time. Keep your eyes on things above. Don't look at me or you, but see that lovely one. He's coming in plain view. Oh, it's manifesting time. The fruit are on the vine and the lovely one. He's coming in plain view. Oh, to count God's chosen bride. Redemption drawing night. He's that lovely one. He's coming in plain view.

He's everything to me. Amen. Amen. And just was you're you're dismissed. We'll sing one song. But just thing I saw sister Barb right before service. And brother Chuck, we missed you, too. I know your wife was the only one that got was missed, but I I missed you. It's good to have you back. But I saw Sister Barb before service. She's walking out to the car and just so burdened for her natural brother, Brother Bobby. And I just thought, you know, we've got a spiritual family and we if if we could just have that same level of burden for those that are spiritually sick among us. And we heard brother Joe this morning asking us to remember his kids that are going off to camp. And it's just like if we just have that same burden for those that that that she has for her natural brother and and I know she does for for her spiritual family as well. I'm not I'm not saying that, but just to just it just tugged at my heartstrings this morning that we've got this wonderful family that God's given to us. And let's not just be concerned about the natural well-being, but about the spiritual well-being of our brothers and sisters. So, amen. You're dismissed. Let's sing that song as we go. He set me free. Once like a bird in prison, I dwelt. Key of F. Once like a bird in prison I dwelt. No freedom from my sorrow I fell. Then Jesus came and listened to me. And glory to God. Oh he set me free. Yes he set me free. Yes he set me free. Oh, he brought demons of prison for me. Well, I'm glory bound by Jesus to see. And glory to God, he set me free.
