[33:53] I [singing] need you, Lord,
[33:56] [music] right now.
[34:02] Hallelujah.
[34:08] On a hill
[34:14] stood [music] an old
[34:17] rugged [singing]
[34:18] cross,
[34:20] the emblem
[34:23] of suffering
[34:26] and shame.
[34:32] And I [singing and music] love
[34:34] that old cross
[34:37] where [singing] the dearest
[34:40] man [music]
[34:43] for [singing] a world
[34:45] of us sinners
[34:49] was [music and singing] slain.
[34:54] And [singing and music] so I'll cherish
[34:57] the old rugged
[35:00] cross
[35:03] till my trophies till my trophies
[35:07] [music]
[35:08] at last [singing] I laid down [music]
[35:15] and I will [singing] cling [music]
[35:19] to the
[35:21] ruging cross [singing]
[35:24] [music]
[35:26] and all stra
[35:29] [singing]
[35:32] and brown.
[35:34] Oh, that old [music] rugged cross.
[35:37] Oh, that old
[35:40] rugged cross
[35:42] so dismal.
[35:48] [music]
[35:49] [singing]
[35:58] For the dear
[36:01] lamb of God [music and singing]
[36:04] left his glory
[36:07] up above
[36:10] to paritary [music and singing]
[36:18] also [singing] I'll cherish I'll cherish
[36:23] the [singing and music] old
[36:26] rugged cross
[36:29] [singing and music]
[36:30] till my trophies
[36:34] at [music] last I [singing]
[36:36] laid down.
[36:40] Oh, I [singing]
[36:41] will cling [music]
[36:44] to the old [singing] brother
[36:47] cross
[36:51] and [music and singing] I'll exchange
[36:54] it someday.
[36:57] Let's sing that third verse as well. And
[36:59] the old rugged cross stained with
[37:01] [music and singing] blood so divine. And
[37:02] the old
[37:05] rugged cross
[37:07] stained with blood [singing]
[37:10] so divine
[37:13] a wonderous
[37:16] beauty
[37:18] I see.
[37:23] For it was [music and singing] on
[37:26] that old cross
[37:28] that Jesus suffered.
[37:32] And I [singing and music] hallelujah to
[37:35] pardon
[37:37] and sanctify [music]
[37:42] the [music]
[37:44] [singing] soul.
[37:48] the old [music] rugged
[37:50] cross
[37:54] [music]
[37:54] until [singing]
[37:55] my bro
[37:58] at last I lay down [music and singing]
[38:19] Hey, boy. One more [music] time. Oh,
[38:22] I'll cherish. Let's lift our hands.
[38:24] [singing] Oh,
[38:26] so I'll [music] cherish
[38:29] the old ruging [singing]
[38:32] cross.
[38:35] Hallelujah. [music]
[38:38] Broies [singing] at last
[38:42] I lay down.
[38:45] Oh, I will cling [singing]
[38:50] old rugged
[38:52] cross [music and singing]
[38:57] and exchange
[39:00] someday forever.
[39:05] Amen. Can you just say praise the
[39:07] [music] Lord? Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[39:10] Yes. Let's give him a hand of praise.
[39:11] Amen. Hallelujah.
[39:15] Amen. God bless each of you. Amen. I
[39:19] just had a note or two before we go to
[39:22] the tape message uh [music] tonight. I
[39:25] wanted to um
[39:28] just share my love and express my love
[39:32] to the saints here and appreciate you. I
[39:34] like this uh setting of the crowd. Uh
[39:37] it's not a large large group of people,
[39:39] just home folks pretty much. God bless
[39:41] you, Sister Hope, and each of you.
[39:43] Welcome. I see brother uh Will's dad
[39:46] there. Welcome the house of the Lord.
[39:48] God bless him. It's always so nice to
[39:50] see him and see each of you. And um the
[39:54] prophet of God takes a scripture in
[39:56] James chapter 5 verse 12 and he reads
[40:01] that out at the beginning [music] of
[40:03] this tape and it's he he'll be laying
[40:06] hands on some sick folks and some
[40:08] ministers and then he goes down and gets
[40:10] into this [music] his message which
[40:12] starts at paragraph number 10. And um
[40:17] what I wanted to do is read James
[40:21] 5:12-16 with you. And if you can turn
[40:25] there, I'll read that for you. And then
[40:28] I'll read a note or two. I'll bring you
[40:30] greetings uh send you greetings from
[40:33] Sister Sharon. I know she would love to
[40:35] be here. I believe she's streaming right
[40:38] now. And so we thank the Lord for her.
[40:39] And also I know the Robsons, we always
[40:42] miss them when they're not here. and
[40:44] many others that are not here, the ones
[40:47] traveling and so forth. Amen. James
[40:50] 5:12. But above all things, my brethren,
[40:53] swear not, neither by heaven, neither by
[40:57] earth, neither by any other oath. Let
[41:01] your yay be yay, and your nay nay, lest
[41:05] you fall into condemnation.
[41:08] Is any among you afflicted, let him
[41:10] pray. Is any marry? Let him sing songs.
[41:14] Is any sick among you? Let him call for
[41:16] the elders of the church. Let them pray
[41:18] over him, anointing him with oil in the
[41:21] name of the Lord. And the prayer of
[41:23] faith shall save the sick. I love this
[41:28] scripture. I really do. And the Lord
[41:30] shall raise him up. And if he have
[41:33] committed sins, they shall be forgiven
[41:37] him. Confess your faults one to another.
[41:41] Pray one for another that you may be
[41:45] healed. The effectual fervent prayer of
[41:48] a righteous man avaleth much. So thank
[41:52] the Lord for that. We appreciate the
[41:54] Lord Jesus. And we it's my desire as
[41:59] always is to uh stand for the word of
[42:02] the Lord. The way I have always
[42:05] approached churches and ministries and
[42:08] other ministries
[42:10] as the early years of me serving the
[42:15] Lord and particularly when I started in
[42:17] the ministry and meeting the different
[42:19] people that I met, I found it was very
[42:22] very important to
[42:25] to know the position of which ministry
[42:29] that I would choose to follow. And that
[42:32] was always been a prerequisite
[42:35] for me. I've always thought I wanted to
[42:38] know what is that brother preaching?
[42:40] Where does he stand? What is his
[42:43] position?
[42:44] And so I and I know that might be a
[42:48] different approach for others and for
[42:51] people, but that's the way it kind of
[42:53] works with me. I like to see the
[42:55] position that a brother takes, that a
[42:57] ministry would take. And um and over the
[43:01] years
[43:03] I always appreciate the position or the
[43:07] ministry or pastors that would play the
[43:10] prophet in their churches. That's a
[43:12] position that is a position that I take.
[43:16] And so I um kind of lean towards pastors
[43:21] and ministers that gives brother
[43:23] Brandham a a place in their pullpit. I
[43:27] um in the in the tape ministry and I'm
[43:31] not criticizing those that don't. I
[43:33] might come across that way or might come
[43:36] out that way back and forth. I know some
[43:39] of the brothers don't criticize
[43:41] us that way that play the tapes. If they
[43:44] choose not to, that's fine. But that's
[43:48] kind of the position that I've uh looked
[43:50] at and those are the ministries that I
[43:53] kind of lean into. Brother Chris are the
[43:56] ones that will have a place for the
[43:58] profit. Um, and I actually view my
[44:03] ministry
[44:05] way, way way, way below brother
[44:08] Brandham's ministry. I do not place my
[44:11] ministry equal to the profit of this
[44:14] age,
[44:16] brother Brandham. And that doesn't mean
[44:18] the Lord doesn't love me or love us the
[44:20] same. He does love us the same. But we
[44:22] have positions in the body of Christ for
[44:25] the purpose of serving the people. And
[44:28] and there is no replacement for the
[44:32] voice that come in this generation.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; So locally there's pastors in every
[44:38] country, city, state, village, hut,
[44:41] whatever. There's pastors, teachers,
[44:44] evangelists, the five-fold ministry. I
[44:47] may or may not ever get to hear all of
[44:50] those brothers
[44:52] because that's not uh a requirement to
[44:56] be a part of the bride. But to be a part
[44:59] of the bride and to make the rapture,
[45:01] you have to hear the voice of the
[45:03] messenger, the Reverend William Brham.
[45:06] That is a position that I take.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And I don't take that like flexing
[45:11] against somebody else. That's just in in
[45:14] the message, the rapture. Brother
[45:16] Brandham says the shout, the voice, and
[45:19] the trumpet. Jesus does all three. And
[45:22] he said, "What was the shout?" It was
[45:24] the message calling the bride together.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; So if you can't catch the shout, you
[45:30] won't be in the voice or in the trump.
[45:32] You won't be in the resurrection as far
[45:34] as that goes. Now, when it comes to
[45:36] salvation, of course, there's lots of
[45:38] people that receive salvation
[45:41] &gt;&gt; that will never hear per se about the
[45:44] message. At least that's the way I
[45:46] understand it. They've asked Brother
[45:47] Bandom about about that. To be a
[45:49] Christian, you don't have to hear uh
[45:52] this message to be a Christian or hear
[45:54] Brother Band's message to be saved, but
[45:58] to be a part of the bride, I believe
[45:59] that every member of that bride has to
[46:02] hear the voice of of that prophet.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; And so, we're going to do that in just a
[46:08] moment. And so, um
[46:12] I I pay close attention to those things.
[46:15] I I talk to brothers as you get to know
[46:18] them and different ministers that you
[46:20] have come and stand at this pulpit here.
[46:23] I have some that I like more than
[46:26] others, I'd say. And uh but
[46:30] and and that's just the way things go.
[46:33] You like ministers, they fit different
[46:35] people at different times. And so, but I
[46:38] generally will not open my pulpit to
[46:40] someone that's
[46:42] negative towards the message because I
[46:45] just don't see um um that position being
[46:50] consistent with what's God is doing in
[46:53] this age. Okay. So, um
[46:58] we see this example in the message. I'm
[47:00] going to read one quote for you. is in
[47:01] the sardis and church age 1960
[47:05] where brother Brandham here he is uh
[47:07] he's preaching the church ages I'm going
[47:10] to read paragraph two and paragraph
[47:11] number four he he's preaching the church
[47:14] ages and he's having tape services of
[47:19] his own tapes for the people to come and
[47:22] hear those tapes here's brother Neville
[47:24] he's a pastor here's brother Brandham
[47:26] he's alive preaching and yet he has
[47:29] people listening to his tapes while he's
[47:32] alive as a part of the tape ministry.
[47:35] So, here's a nice example for that. Let
[47:37] me read that for you. And then someone
[47:40] just passed a note, come around and pass
[47:42] a note over about the services tomorrow.
[47:45] You who are visiting us, we sure be glad
[47:48] to have you come down in the afternoon
[47:50] at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. They're
[47:53] going to have tape services. And if
[47:56] you're not doing anything, there will be
[47:58] one of the messages that you've never
[48:00] heard will be played and have prayer
[48:03] meeting and we'll just expect a good
[48:06] time tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.
[48:10] It's going to be a pretty busy time for
[48:12] me because tomorrow, see, I have to pick
[48:14] up Sunday morning and also Sunday night,
[48:16] tomorrow night, too. And all the history
[48:18] on those churches. And now Sunday
[48:21] morning, the Lord willing, we're
[48:22] expecting a great time cuz Sunday
[48:24] morning be off. Drop down to paragraph
[48:27] number four.
[48:29] Uh Sunday night, we'll take up that last
[48:31] great angel, the message to the
[48:33] Leodyian. Sunday night, the Lord
[48:35] willing. And now then tomorrow afternoon
[48:38] is the service here, a tape service.
[48:41] Brother Jean just told me we begin at
[48:45] 2:00 tomorrow afternoon. And you people
[48:48] that like to come and hear the messages
[48:50] have prayer around the altar. You that
[48:53] seek in the Holy Spirit or something
[48:55] wonderful time church is a nice and warm
[48:59] open ready for anybody at any time that
[49:02] wants to come in and pray and seek the
[49:03] Lord. The church is open and waiting and
[49:06] we will be expecting you. Put it like
[49:10] that. Be expecting you tomorrow
[49:13] afternoon.
[49:15] So who was that?
[49:17] So, Brother Brandham had a tape service
[49:19] in his own tabernacle. People coming to
[49:22] pray around the altar and seek the Lord.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem with playing the
[49:26] tape. I I I actually thank the Lord for
[49:29] it. It's the the greatest ministry and
[49:32] we certainly hope our ministry is
[49:35] lifting that up before you to keep that
[49:38] before the people. Amen. So, God bless
[49:41] you. So,
[49:43] can we add another service on Sunday?
[49:45] [laughter]
[49:46] No, I'm teasing. It's at 2 o'clock. It
[49:48] would be perfect, Brother Ben. Get
[49:50] everybody in here at 2 and then be back
[49:53] here at 5:00. Actually, be here at 4:30
[49:56] to pray and be ready for
[50:00] Yeah, I'm testing. I'm looking at who's
[50:02] really smiling. Some of y'all are not
[50:03] smiling at all, but it's okay. So, God
[50:06] bless you. God bless you so much. I
[50:08] wanted to read that. Had that on my
[50:09] heart. So let's stand and we'll sing
[50:11] this old hymn of the church only
[50:14] believe. Amen.
[50:17] Only
[50:19] believe [singing and music]
[50:23] only
[50:25] believe
[50:27] that all things are possible.
[50:34] Only
[50:36] believe. [singing and music]
[50:38] Hallelujah.
[50:40] Only [music]
[50:41] believe.
[50:45] Only [singing]
[50:47] believe. [music]
[50:51] All [singing]
[50:52] things are possible.
[50:57] Oh, let's lift our hands. Lord, I
[51:00] believe.
[51:02] Oh, Lord,
[51:04] [music and singing] I believe.
[51:08] Lord,
[51:10] I believe
[51:14] that all things
[51:17] are possible.
[51:20] Lord,
[51:21] [music]
[51:22] I believe. [singing]
[51:26] Lord,
[51:27] [music]
[51:28] I believe.
[51:31] Lord,
[51:33] [music] I believe
[51:37] that all [singing] things are possible.
[51:43] Lord, I believe.
[51:50] Amen.
[51:52] Brother Brandham is taking out of the
[51:54] scripture of Mark chapter 12. Let's
[51:56] remain standing as he reads that portion
[51:58] of the word. God bless you.
[52:07] the 12th chapter.
[52:10] We want to
[52:12] take a portion of this
[52:15] and read it and because it is God's holy
[52:20] unadulterated
[52:21] word
[52:23] and we believe that God is in his word.
[52:25] Do you believe that?
[52:31] And we are praying that God will add his
[52:33] blessings to it as we read it.
[52:37] And I'm sure that he will.
[52:44] And then I want to take another portion
[52:46] of his word out of Acts the first
[52:48] chapter
[52:51] and we shall read from them.
[52:57] And I'm asking the Lord if he will add
[52:59] his blessings to the to the reading of
[53:01] his word. I was just looking here. I had
[53:04] a mark here in my in my Bible
[53:09] that I wanted to read from first, but I
[53:11] don't think I can find it just at the
[53:13] time.
[53:18] Just excuse me for a moment. I can find
[53:20] it. If I can. I thought I had it.
[53:23] Jesus said unto them, have faith in God.
[53:29] For verily I say unto you, if you shall
[53:32] say to this mountain, be moved and do
[53:36] not doubt in your heart, but believe
[53:39] that those things you say will come to
[53:42] pass, you shall have what you say.
[53:46] Now over in Acts the the first chapter
[53:51] and the 8th verse.
[53:54] But ye
[53:56] shall receive power after that the Holy
[53:59] Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be
[54:02] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and
[54:05] in Judea and in Samaria and to the
[54:09] utmost parts of the earth.
[54:14] I'd like to draw your attention to the
[54:17] word of of the Lord this morning for
[54:19] just a while.
[54:22] And I want you to pay the utmost
[54:23] attention to it. Listen closely.
[54:28] The value of this word
[54:32] after 25 years of ministry for the Lord
[54:38] in his work and in his word and after
[54:40] this being coming in my 12th year of
[54:43] international evangelism
[54:45] and by the grace of God to meeting tens
[54:48] of thousands of of people and seeing our
[54:52] Lord in our own campaigns when now as I
[54:55] have seen to him
[54:57] right in toward towards 2 million people
[54:59] a million500,000 somewhere along in
[55:01] there in the meetings I've come to this
[55:04] conclusion
[55:07] and of all of our efforts and so forth
[55:11] it's impossible for God to do anything
[55:15] for the people until the people first
[55:18] get settled on whether it's truth or not
[55:24] &gt;&gt; you just can't no matter I have seen
[55:27] great ma masterpieces of our Lord in the
[55:33] the word who could explain the word
[55:36] better than anyone I ever seen and yet
[55:39] could not make the program go over.
[55:43] Now, I have on my mind this morning a
[55:46] certain man
[55:48] that I think has one of the best radio
[55:50] programs on the air, but there's somehow
[55:52] the man can't put his program over.
[55:54] That's Dr. Wine. [clears throat]
[55:58] a real teacher, but there's something
[56:01] wrong.
[56:02] I don't know where it's at. He's got the
[56:05] vision. He's got the idea. He's got the
[56:08] ability, but he just simply can't get
[56:11] the program to move him somehow. The
[56:14] program that he's got strictly on the
[56:17] word, and it should bring the world to
[56:19] their knees.
[56:22] And I seen here not long ago in
[56:24] Louisville when I seen Dr. Mori Ham and
[56:27] many great theologians that I know which
[56:29] is far better preacher than
[56:31] [clears throat] the young 38 or 40 year
[56:34] old redheaded evangelist walked out to
[56:36] the platform passed those men and they
[56:38] took a backseat and stood there that
[56:40] night
[56:42] wasn't one tenth or 100th the preacher
[56:45] that the man was sitting behind him
[56:47] though he had the program of God and put
[56:49] it over Billy Grim.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[56:56] &gt;&gt; I've noticed those things and in
[56:58] noticing them then I come to this
[57:00] conclusion.
[57:02] No matter what you are, God's got to
[57:06] furnish the audience.
[57:08] And no matter if I could stand here this
[57:11] morning and bring the dead to life and
[57:15] to bring the cripples to their normal
[57:17] condition
[57:19] and yet God is not in the program, it
[57:21] would go nowhere.
[57:24] God has to be in the program.
[57:28] And um any man is known
[57:34] uh his character is known by his works.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; No matter who he is, his works prove his
[57:45] character.
[57:47] If you take a man, no matter how good he
[57:50] tries to be, if his works are evil, all
[57:54] his goodness won't amount to nothing.
[57:57] Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And a man's word is his characteristic.
[58:04] A man that his word is no good, then
[58:08] you'll never have confidence in that man
[58:11] because his word's no good.
[58:14] So therefore, God our father, his
[58:18] character and his works prove what he
[58:21] is.
[58:24] Now we know that this world come here
[58:28] by some great creator.
[58:31] It could not have just happened to be.
[58:34] Now I want this just few moments to be
[58:36] just as simple as possible
[58:40] but I want you to get it in praying that
[58:42] the Holy Spirit will move it right into
[58:44] the light that it belongs in.
[58:49] Now, IF YOU WILL JUST LOOK AND see the
[58:53] trees growing and the limbs and the
[58:56] leaves, how they come and go and the
[58:58] flowers, the spring, the fall, the
[59:01] winter, the summer,
[59:03] something's got to be behind that.
[59:08] There could not be a tree unless there
[59:10] could be an intelligence to make it a
[59:12] tree.
[59:14] No matter what kind of a life would be
[59:16] in it, there has to be behind that an
[59:20] intelligence to make it what it is. Now,
[59:24] think that straight now. Don't let it go
[59:26] over. Think of it deeply.
[59:30] For if you notice our scripture lesson,
[59:33] Jesus said, "If you WILL SAY IN YOUR
[59:36] HEART,
[59:38] not in your intellects, it'll never work
[59:41] there."
[59:43] No matter how much you try to make it
[59:45] work, it won't work.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's intellectual and has an end.
[59:51] But when anything's eternal, it has no
[59:53] end.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; And it had no beginning.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Anything with an beginning has an end.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; But it's just those THINGS WHICH HAS no
[1:00:04] beginning.
[1:00:06] AND ONLY GOD HAS NO beginning or no end.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:00:15] to have these things that has a
[1:00:17] beginning, there had to be something
[1:00:19] WITHOUT A BEGINNING TO START THE
[1:00:21] BEGINNING.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The first tree that was ever made that
[1:00:27] like the one that Jesus cursed here
[1:00:29] said, "No fruit grow on thee from
[1:00:31] henceforth. No man eth."
[1:00:35] There had to be somewhere that tree had
[1:00:39] to have a beginning.
[1:00:42] AND IT HAD AN ending when the words that
[1:00:46] for the lips OF THE ONE WHO GAVE IT THE
[1:00:48] BEGINNING TOOK IT TO THE END.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; So you see how eternal his words are.
[1:00:57] BUT WE HAVE JUST ACCEPTED the word on
[1:01:00] the intellectual basis
[1:01:04] and seen so many total failures
[1:01:08] TILL IT HAS BROUGHT PEOPLE TO A place
[1:01:12] that THEY JUST HARDLY KNOW WHAT TO
[1:01:16] BELIEVE.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; They're just got a lot of loose ends to
[1:01:21] their their religion.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. They run out ON LIMBS THIS WAY AND
[1:01:26] limbs that way which comes to the end.
[1:01:28] And here they come crawling back.
[1:01:31] Great movement starts and they run out
[1:01:34] like the Methodists, the Baptists and
[1:01:36] the Pentecostals and all this and the
[1:01:38] first thing you know they get a little
[1:01:40] psychic idea and they run out to the
[1:01:42] limb and they're having a big time but
[1:01:44] the first thing you know they find
[1:01:45] themselves at the end.
[1:01:50] But the ONLY THINGS THAT EVERLAST IS the
[1:01:53] eternal things
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; and the eternal things are God.
[1:02:01] Now if you notice a man known by his his
[1:02:04] character is known by his works.
[1:02:10] If we WOULD THINK OF HOW GOD SHOWS HIS
[1:02:14] CHARACTER BY HIS WORKS.
[1:02:17] He's got his own character and he made
[1:02:20] his works. And if you look at his works,
[1:02:23] how great they are. Now, let me
[1:02:26] challenge every scientist in the world
[1:02:29] to build me one tree.
[1:02:33] Let me CHALLENGE EVERY SCIENTIST IN THE
[1:02:35] WORLD TO make me one little simple
[1:02:38] spring of grass.
[1:02:41] AND IT'S TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:02:45] WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE THEN UPON thinking
[1:02:47] those things that there COULD BE A
[1:02:50] PLACING by reading the word A FAITH THAT
[1:02:55] WOULD GO BEYOND the intellectual
[1:02:57] conceptions into the heart.
[1:03:02] Jesus said, "If thou shalt say in the
[1:03:06] heart."
[1:03:08] Now, we get all frustrated in our minds
[1:03:11] and we go out and say, "Oh, I've seen
[1:03:14] that done. Yes, I and once in a while
[1:03:17] it's a hop, skipping a so forth, but it
[1:03:20] seems LIKE IT JUST CAN'T GET MOVING
[1:03:23] right
[1:03:25] because we try to mix the intellectual
[1:03:28] with the supernatural. They have no
[1:03:31] dealings with each other at all.
[1:03:33] Intellectuals will say one thing AND
[1:03:36] SUPERNATURAL WILL SAY ANOTHER.
[1:03:38] And any man that's ever led by the
[1:03:41] SPIRIT OF GOD DOES NOT TAKE ANY THOUGHT
[1:03:44] OF ANY INTELLECTUAL,
[1:03:47] but he's LED FROM HIS HEART by the
[1:03:49] spirit of God.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; He's misunderstood.
[1:03:53] People say, "OH, HOW COULD IT BE?"
[1:03:57] Right now, I'm getting letters and phone
[1:03:58] calls. You mean brother Brandham that
[1:04:01] you wouldn't be going overseas AFTER ALL
[1:04:05] THIS GREAT BUT it looks wonderful
[1:04:09] but something weighed down inside
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; said be careful
[1:04:16] AND THEREFORE WE DON'T LOOK THAT WHAT WE
[1:04:19] SEE WE LOOK AT THOSE THINGS WE do not
[1:04:21] see
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; but what God says in the heart
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; AND IF WE COULD PAY ATTENTION
[1:04:29] TO THOSE THINGS. HOW MUCH MORE BY divine
[1:04:32] healing? IF GOD MADE THE PROMISE AND IT
[1:04:35] ANCHORS in the heart,
[1:04:38] well, WHAT GOOD DO WE NEED INTELLECTUALS
[1:04:40] ANYMORE? I don't look at my affliction.
[1:04:42] I don't look at MY SYMPTOMS. I LOOK AT
[1:04:45] WHAT God said about it because after
[1:04:48] all, he is the boss and the supreme
[1:04:51] boss.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; If the doctor said so and so, now if you
[1:04:55] try to bluff that, it won't work. If you
[1:04:58] try to reason it in your mind, say,
[1:05:00] "Yes, God's word's right. I believe
[1:05:03] that. I believe it will come to pass. I
[1:05:05] think that." Now, if that's
[1:05:06] intellectually, you just might as well
[1:05:08] stop thinking it
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; UNTIL SOMETHING COMES down on the inside
[1:05:14] of you.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; THAT JUST SAYS IT'S SO AND THAT'S ALL
[1:05:18] THERE IS TO IT.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DEMONS out of
[1:05:23] torment could ever shake it from you.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's something on the inside
[1:05:29] called the heart.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; There's where real faith finds its
[1:05:35] resting place.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Intellectuals will try to
[1:05:41] reason about it. Now, let us be
[1:05:44] reasonable.
[1:05:46] BUT FAITH HAS NO REASONING.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; IT JUST HAS ONE THING, AND THAT'S GOD'S
[1:05:52] WORD IS RIGHT.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; THERE'S WHERE THE SOUL SETS IT
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; AND [clears throat] REST ETERNALLY RIGHT
[1:06:02] THERE. FOR GOD said so.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; NOT A BLUFF, BUT KNOWING IT.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; And the EARTH BEING GOD'S WORK, it
[1:06:14] absolutely speaks AND TESTIFIES OF HIS
[1:06:18] BEING.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD. THERE HAS TO BE A GOD OR
[1:06:23] THERE WOULD BE NO EARTH.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE A CREATOR OR THERE'D BE
[1:06:28] NO CREATION.
[1:06:30] AND IF THIS WORD that he CREATED THE
[1:06:34] EARTH BY GIVES THE PROMISE, IT HAS TO
[1:06:38] CREATE EXACTLY WHAT THIS EARTH CREATED
[1:06:41] by his word in the beginning.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD SAID, "LET THERE BE."
[1:06:48] And it might took 10 BILLION YEARS.
[1:06:51] I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKEN,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW LONG IT TAKEN, THAT MEANT
[1:06:57] NOTHING BECAUSE GOD'S ETERNAL.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "LET THERE BE and it begin
[1:07:03] to tell."
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; FOR GOD TOOK HIS OWN WORD AND BELIEVED.
[1:07:11] AND IF HIS WORD of his creation, his
[1:07:14] work here proves that he is a creator,
[1:07:17] then why can't we take his word AND WHAT
[1:07:19] IT SAYS AND BELIEVE IT?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's the same creator's word.
[1:07:27] Now, his works bear witness.
[1:07:31] NOW BEFORE GOD THE INFALLIBLE ONE COULD
[1:07:34] speak anything, it has to be perfect
[1:07:37] because it can only
[1:07:39] it CAN ONLY IF IT COMES FROM GOD IS
[1:07:41] COMING FROM A PERFECT CHANNEL.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Now notice this
[1:07:48] ALL PEOPLE'S everything mannered by
[1:07:52] their works.
[1:07:54] when the great municipal bridge was
[1:07:58] built in Sydney, Australia,
[1:08:01] when they sent around THE WORLD TO GET
[1:08:04] BRIDGE BUILDERS, architects
[1:08:08] and from what across the peninsula at at
[1:08:13] Sydney, AUSTRALIA TO SPEND OVER TO SOUTH
[1:08:15] SYDNEY.
[1:08:16] The architects AND ALL CAME AND DUG UP
[1:08:21] THE SORROW AND TESTED IT.
[1:08:24] AND ALL OF THEM COME TO THIS CONCLUSION.
[1:08:26] IT CANNOT BE DONE.
[1:08:31] SAID THE WHOLE BAY IS FULL OF QUICKSAND
[1:08:36] AND THE SOIL WILL NOT HOLD TOGETHER
[1:08:38] ENOUGH. IT'LL SHIFT FROM PLACE TO PLACE.
[1:08:43] THEREFORE, IF THE bridge would be built,
[1:08:46] it would be a dangerous thing to try to
[1:08:49] pass over it.
[1:08:52] AND FINALLY
[1:08:53] THERE WAS A MAN WHO WAS A MAN OF VISION,
[1:08:57] a bridge builder in England.
[1:09:00] He came over and he looked at the sands.
[1:09:05] He he SURVEYED IT. HE TESTED the soils.
[1:09:11] HE SAMPLED THE WATERS.
[1:09:13] HE LOOKED IT ALL OVER FIRST. OH, I love
[1:09:18] that. Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; HE LOOKED IT ALL OVER. FIRST, JESUS
[1:09:23] SAID, "A MAN BUYING A GROUND OR GOING TO
[1:09:26] MEET AN ARMY, FIRST HE SITS DOWN AND
[1:09:29] COUNTS the cost."
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Every one of you at the altar THIS
[1:09:34] MORNING WOULD SIT THERE IN YOUR SEATS
[1:09:37] BEFORE YOU COME TO BE ANOINTED AND WOULD
[1:09:40] COUNT WHAT IT MEANS.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:45] It wouldn't be just going through a
[1:09:46] prayer line half-hazardly.
[1:09:48] IT WOULD BE GOING THERE WITH A FIRM
[1:09:51] CONFIDENCE.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD HAD PROMISED IT AND GOD
[1:09:57] [screaming] WAS ABLE TO KEEP IT.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Thank God. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; SO THIS MAN tested the soils. He tested
[1:10:06] the each bed in there that had the
[1:10:08] quicksand. And finally he went TO THE
[1:10:10] OFFICIALS. HE SAID, "I WILL build the
[1:10:14] bridge and it will be safe."
[1:10:18] THE BRIDGE BUILDERS OF AMERICA AND
[1:10:21] different parts of the world only
[1:10:23] laughed AND SAID THE MAN IS MENTALLY
[1:10:25] ILL.
[1:10:27] NO MAN COULD PUT A BRIDGE across that.
[1:10:32] Said even IF A CHICKEN SHOULD WALK THE
[1:10:35] BRIDGE THAT WOULD BE BUILT, IT WOULD
[1:10:37] SINK.
[1:10:40] THE BRIDGE CANNOT STAND IT. THE
[1:10:41] VIBRATIONS OF EVEN THE DOG RUNNING
[1:10:45] ACROSS THE BRIDGE WHICH WILL VIBRATE THE
[1:10:47] BRIDGE. SO IT WOULD SHAKE THE SANDS AND
[1:10:49] THE BRIDGE WOULD GO DOWN. IT CANNOT BE
[1:10:52] DONE. BUT THIS MAN WAS A MAN OF VISION
[1:10:56] AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT
[1:10:59] FOR SOMETHING DOWN IN HIM TOLD HIM HE
[1:11:02] COULD DO IT.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE US MAN IN THE CHURCH LIKE THAT.
[1:11:08] AH,
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; now from all of the scientific research
[1:11:14] that it could not be done, SCIENCE
[1:11:18] PROVED THAT IT COULD NOT BE DONE. BUT
[1:11:19] THIS MAN had a vision he could do it.
[1:11:23] So he took the contract
[1:11:26] quickly. He went to work. He went to
[1:11:29] testing the soils. He went to testing
[1:11:32] and sounded the depths OF THE QUICK
[1:11:34] SANDBED. HE TESTED EVERY BOAT.
[1:11:39] HE TESTED EVERY PIECE OF OF WOOD, EVERY
[1:11:44] PIECE OF METAL, EVERY CONCRETE.
[1:11:47] EVERYTHING HAD TO BE PERFECTLY TESTED
[1:11:52] BECAUSE HIS his great name
[1:11:57] AND HIS CHARACTER AND HIS ABILITY RESTED
[1:12:01] ON WHETHER THAT BRIDGE STOOD OR NOT.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; MY
[1:12:05] AND IF A MAN OF THIS EARTH BY A VISION
[1:12:11] WOULD BE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS TESTED
[1:12:15] PERFECTLY BEFORE HE PUT IT IN A BRIDGE
[1:12:17] BECAUSE OF HIS CHARACTER
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF HIS NAME.
[1:12:23] HOW [screaming] MUCH MORE DID OUR
[1:12:26] BLESSED HEAVENLY FATHER
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TEST EVERY WORD THAT WAS EVER SAID
[1:12:33] OR WROTE IN THE BIBLE.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; HE TESTED EVERY WORD EVERY PROPHET
[1:12:40] AND EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD must be
[1:12:43] tested.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; THE MATERIAL THAT GOES IN THIS great
[1:12:48] highway,
[1:12:50] EVERY ROCK, EVERY MATERIAL BEFORE IT'S
[1:12:53] PLACED INTO THE THE BODY OF CHRIST HAS
[1:12:57] TO BE TRIED.
[1:13:00] CHASEN EVERY SON THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST
[1:13:03] FIRST BE TRIED.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; No exceptions.
[1:13:09] EVERYONE, [screaming]
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; EVERY PROPHET BEFORE HE COULD WRITE IN
[1:13:15] THAT BIBLE, HE WAS TESTED BY THE HOLY
[1:13:18] SPIRIT.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; just as he the bridge builder, I'm sorry
[1:13:24] I forget his name. I knew it COUPLE DAYS
[1:13:26] AGO. I WAS READING THE ARTICLE. PROUD OF
[1:13:29] IT. He had everything tested. HE GOT THE
[1:13:33] BEST MECHANICS HE COULD FIND. HE GOT THE
[1:13:36] BEST CONCRETE MAN. HE GOT THE BEST THAT
[1:13:40] HE COULD FIND TO PUT TOGETHER THE BEST
[1:13:43] THAT HE HAD.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; OH MY SOUL WOULD CRY, HALLELUJAH TO GOD
[1:13:50] WHEN I THINK THAT GOD PUTS IN HIS CHURCH
[1:13:53] THE BEST THAT HE CAN FIND.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. GOD TAKES HIS CHILDREN AND
[1:13:59] TESTS THEM WITH ACID [laughter] TEST.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Then he places them into the body of
[1:14:04] Christ because they are tested.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; they believe.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE WENT THROUGH THE TRIALS.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; THEY'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE.
[1:14:15] THEY ARE WITNESSES OF HIS.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE talking about.
[1:14:21] NOT JUST AN INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION, BUT
[1:14:24] THEY'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN OF THE PRECIOUS
[1:14:27] HOLY SPIRIT and time tested and tried
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; UNTIL THEIR SOULS ARE SET LIKE plate
[1:14:35] towards Calvary.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, they are timeested.
[1:14:40] They are witnesses of his powers.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THAT, GOD'S BUILDING A
[1:14:46] BRIDGE.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. from earth to glory
[1:14:51] that the way we man may come ON THE
[1:14:53] HIGHWAY S THE trees
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; in the cool of the day but timeested
[1:15:02] material
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; those who take God at his word NO MATTER
[1:15:07] WHAT THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES
[1:15:09] THAT DOESN'T STAND IN IT way
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; God's got timeested material as a
[1:15:15] witness
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and he places it
[1:15:18] And this great bridge builder, WHEN
[1:15:21] FINALLY THE ARCHITECT STOOD ALONG ON THE
[1:15:24] SIDE AND SAID to the builder, "Man, the
[1:15:26] critics, it'll never stand." So have
[1:15:30] they said, "The church will never rise."
[1:15:33] So have they said the days of miracles
[1:15:35] has passed. SO HAVE THEY SAID THAT OLD
[1:15:38] TIME RELIGION CANNOT be enjoyed anymore.
[1:15:42] BUT OH, when
[1:15:45] this man placed all those materials
[1:15:48] together, HE DUG, HE GOT BLOWERS AND HE
[1:15:51] BLOWED OUT THOSE QUICK SAND BEDS.
[1:15:56] HE WENT ON DOWN, DOWN, DOWN FOR HUNDREDS
[1:16:00] OF FEET BENEATH THE WATER UNTIL HE
[1:16:02] BUMPED THAT SHIFTING SANDS AWAY UNTIL HE
[1:16:05] PUT THIS CONCRETE ANCHORED IN THE ROCK
[1:16:08] ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.
[1:16:12] OH, it was a price. Yes. AND ANYTHING
[1:16:16] THAT'S WORTH HAVING HAS A PRICE ATTACHED
[1:16:18] to it.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; How great is salvation. What a great
[1:16:21] price.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; BUT HE FINALLY GOT DOWN UNDER THE
[1:16:26] shifting sands and God has taken
[1:16:29] Christians and tried them and tried THEM
[1:16:31] AND HAD TO BRUSH THEM OFF AND BRUSH THEM
[1:16:32] OFF AND BRUSH THEM OFF TILL FINALLY ONE
[1:16:34] OF THESE days
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; he comes down to the solid rock.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some man just takes this little
[1:16:41] wishy-washy experience of shaking hands
[1:16:44] and joined the church and being
[1:16:46] sprinkled A FEW TIMES OR BAPTIZED OR
[1:16:48] SOMETHING and he washes ALL THE SHIFTING
[1:16:50] SANDS BACK UNTIL HE'S ANCHORED ON THE
[1:16:53] ROCK CHRIST JESUS.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; All devils in torment can't move him.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; The bridge builder know what he was
[1:17:02] doing. And when finally was completed,
[1:17:06] some of them said, "It won't stand.
[1:17:08] It'll be dangerous for anything to cross
[1:17:11] it. He got around a bunch of engineers
[1:17:14] and with railroads.
[1:17:16] And that DAY WHEN THEY PASSED FROM SOUTH
[1:17:18] SYDNEY GOING TO NORTH Sydney across the
[1:17:21] span, [clears throat] HE PUT ABOUT EIGHT
[1:17:23] BIG FREIGHT trains loaded down
[1:17:28] and HE PUT THE MAYOR OF THE CITY IN A
[1:17:32] CAR AND HE GOT IN THE FRONT OF it
[1:17:35] walking PACKING THE FLAG.
[1:17:39] THAT IS THE GREAT ARMY AND THE BIG eight
[1:17:42] big steam engines LOADED DOWN MARCHED
[1:17:45] ACROSS that bridge [clears throat] WITH
[1:17:48] THE BUILDER TAKING THE FIRST PLACE GOING
[1:17:51] IN.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; SHE NEVER EVEN MOVED.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON, WHO'S THE
[1:18:01] ARCHITECT OF THE CHURCH,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; come to THIS EARTH AND LAID DOWN THE
[1:18:06] FOUNDATION. WHEN HE MET THE DEVIL, HE
[1:18:09] WAS TESTED BY THE WORD OF GOD AND HE
[1:18:11] SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN."
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; When he took him to the pinnacle of the
[1:18:18] temple, HE SAID, "IT IS WRITTEN." SEE
[1:18:21] THE MATERIAL HE'S PUTTING IN HIS CHURCH.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; He took him to the mountain AND SHOWED
[1:18:25] HIM ALL THE GREAT PROGRAMS HE COULD
[1:18:27] HAVE. HE SAID, "IT is written."
[1:18:30] [clears throat]
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; ALL THE WORD OF GOD WAS TIMEESTED.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND HE'S A GREAT CAPTAIN THAT IS
[1:18:38] GOING BEFORE US WITH HIS OWN BLOODY COAT
[1:18:41] WAVING THAT TO THE REDEEMING OF THE
[1:18:45] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HAS BOUGHT A
[1:18:47] CHURCH BY THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT TESTED
[1:18:51] every boat and every person has ever
[1:18:54] anchored in the street church of the
[1:18:56] living God.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It's a timetestive material that does
[1:19:02] it. AND AS HE MARCHES ON THE GREAT
[1:19:06] REGIME COMING BEHIND HIM AS A BORN AGAIN
[1:19:09] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; SHE DON'T MOVE BECAUSE WE HAVE RECEIVED
[1:19:14] A kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; It's dug plumb to the solid rock of
[1:19:20] Christ Jesus being that chosen.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And as he goes before us with his own
[1:19:27] bloody coat making the way, it's a sign
[1:19:31] of redemption.
[1:19:34] witnesses.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; YE SHALL BE my witnesses
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in
[1:19:42] Samaritan.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; His church stands as his witness.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Now this morning, I'd like to state this
[1:19:51] to leave this to you. We are his
[1:19:55] WITNESSES AFTER YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE
[1:19:57] Holy Spirit.
[1:19:59] For there can only be one THING YOU CAN
[1:20:02] WITNESS. THAT IS WHAT YOU KNOW TO BE THE
[1:20:04] TRUTH.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; THAT FELL COULD WITNESS AFTER HE HAD
[1:20:09] BLOWN ALL THE SANDS AWAY AND FOUND THE
[1:20:12] SOLID ROCK ON THE BREAST OF THE EARTH.
[1:20:15] HE WAS A WITNESS THAT THAT WOULD HOLD.
[1:20:19] HE PUT THE GUGERS AND THE machines on
[1:20:22] those GREAT PIECES OF MATERIAL AND
[1:20:24] TESTED EVERY one of them. My
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; he WAS A WITNESS THAT THEY WOULD HOLD
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; FOR IT TO STREAK AND she held
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; and we who are thorned again of THE HOLY
[1:20:36] SPIRIT THAT'S BEEN FILLED WITH GOD'S
[1:20:38] POWER THAT'S TASTED THE ETERNAL LIFE OF
[1:20:40] the eternal GOD AND THAT DWELLS IN US
[1:20:42] ARE WITNESSES of his goodness and his
[1:20:46] word and his power.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; It's no more guess so. It's a no. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; By experience,
[1:20:55] NOAH WHEN HE BUILT THE ARK,
[1:20:58] he gave WITNESS TO THE UNRIGHTEOUS world
[1:21:01] that there was a righteous God.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Although it seemed to be crazy while it
[1:21:06] WAS BEING BUILT, BUT IT PROVED OUT THAT
[1:21:09] IT WAS THE ONLY BOAT THAT WOULD FLOAT
[1:21:12] THROUGH THE STORM.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And as it was being erected, it was he
[1:21:15] condemned the unrighteous world and
[1:21:17] justified those who believed in it.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How ridiculous sometime God does
[1:21:22] things and as a man. Did you ever stop
[1:21:27] to think what kind of wood that Noah
[1:21:28] built that boat out of?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; IT WAS BUILT OUT OF SHED WOOD.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; And that is the softest wood that can be
[1:21:36] gotten.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's just like balsam.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S WHY YOU THROW IT IN THE LAKE UNDER
[1:21:42] IT WOULD SINK IN five minutes.
[1:21:45] It's balsam wood or shed wood has holes
[1:21:48] to it.
[1:21:50] And isn't it a strange thing that a art
[1:21:54] was the standard test of the great
[1:21:55] Andolian DESTRUCTION WAS MADE OUT OF
[1:21:58] SOFT WOOD.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; WELL, it was appliable.
[1:22:05] And sometime when WE GET SO HARD AND SET
[1:22:08] IN OUR WAYS, GOD CAN'T APPLY us to
[1:22:10] anything.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; But here's the reason he DID IT. DID YOU
[1:22:15] NOTICE AFTER HE MADE IT
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; THAT HE BORROWED some tar or some rosin?
[1:22:21] It was OUT OF THE OTHER TREES. NOW, WHAT
[1:22:25] does this mean? WHEN HE PUT THE ARK
[1:22:28] TOGETHER, IT WAS MADE OUT OF THIS REAL
[1:22:30] LIGHT soft wood. You can lift it around
[1:22:32] very easy. It's so light and pliable.
[1:22:36] AND THEN HE CUT DOWN ANOTHER TREE WHICH
[1:22:38] WAS A PINE TREE. And they beat that the
[1:22:41] way they used to get it. beat it and
[1:22:43] beat it until THEY BEAT THE ROSIN out of
[1:22:45] it. And then HE TOOK THIS ROSIN AND
[1:22:48] POURED IT INTO this lightwood and the
[1:22:51] little holes that WAS IN THE LIGHTWOOD
[1:22:53] FILLED UP WITH THE ROSIN AND CASED MADE
[1:22:55] IT HARDLY STEEL.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; AND GOD TAKING HIS CHURCH WHO EMPTIES
[1:23:00] HIMSELF OUT
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; AND NOTHING BUT [laughter] THE PLIABLE
[1:23:04] IN THE HANDS OF GOD. GOD CUT HIS OWN SON
[1:23:07] DOWN AND TOOK THE LIFE OF HIS SON BY
[1:23:10] BEATENS AND BRUISES AND POURED IT INTO
[1:23:12] THE BELIEVER AND HE BECOMES CHASENED
[1:23:16] FOR THE JUDGMENTS.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S the only thing who take THE
[1:23:20] JUDGMENT. IT PASSED RIGHT OVER THE
[1:23:22] JUDGMENTS. OF COURSE, SHE went right
[1:23:23] through the the water was the judgment
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; and it passed through the judgment. It
[1:23:28] was A WITNESS THAT GOD KNEW WHAT HE WAS
[1:23:31] DOING.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Noah followed the word of God.
[1:23:35] Many things could be said that Daniel
[1:23:39] was a witness that there was AN ANGEL IN
[1:23:41] HEAVEN OR A GOD IN heaven that know the
[1:23:44] secrets of the heart. For he sent his
[1:23:47] angel and DELIVERED DANIEL. MANY OTHERS
[1:23:50] WAS WITNESS WHEN JESUS died on the
[1:23:54] cross. The heavens give witness.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; THERE IS THE MATERIAL.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE THING. IF YOU'LL NOTICE, ALL
[1:24:03] CREATION GAVE WITNESS TO IT.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Right in the middle OF THE DAY WHEN GOD
[1:24:09] HAD PROPHESIED BEFORE WHEN THE SABBATH
[1:24:11] WOULD CEASE. SAID, "There'll be a time
[1:24:13] when the sun goes down in the middle of
[1:24:15] the day and from THE SIXTH AND GOING
[1:24:18] HOUR, IT WAS DARKNESS."
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE SUN. DARKNESS DOESN'T
[1:24:26] MEAN IT'S got a little LIGHT IN IT.
[1:24:28] DARKNESS IS ABSOLUTELY TOTAL DARKNESS.
[1:24:32] SO DARK LIKE IT WAS IN EGYPT TILL IT
[1:24:34] COULD BE FELT.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; NOT A RAY OF LIGHT.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; AND THE SUN GAVE WITNESS.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; THERE'S THE ONE. THAT'S THE MATERIAL
[1:24:46] THAT GOD'S GOING TO BUILD A CHURCH OUT
[1:24:48] OF. THE MOON AND STARS GAVE WITNESS.
[1:24:52] WHEN IT DIED, THE HEAVENS GAVE WITNESS.
[1:24:54] THE EARTH BELTS. THE ROCKS RAN OUT. The
[1:24:59] earth gave witness. [clears throat]
[1:25:01] And the saints who stepped in THE EARTH
[1:25:02] DUST OF THE EARTH ROSE GAVE WITNESS.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; The people AT PENTECOST WHEN THEY WERE
[1:25:12] making fun. PETER STOOD UP AND GAVE
[1:25:15] WITNESS. BUT SOME OF THAT SAME LIFE THAT
[1:25:19] HAD BEEN BEAT OUT OF CALVARY WAS POURED
[1:25:21] INTO PETER IN THE FORM OF THE HOLY
[1:25:23] GHOST. AND HE STOOD THERE AS A WITNESS.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; GOD'S WORD. AND HE GAVE WITNESS WITH A
[1:25:29] TEXT OUT OF SCRIPTURE. THAT SAID, "YOU
[1:25:31] MEN OF JUDEA, YOU DWELL IN JERUSALEM,
[1:25:34] LET THIS BE KNOWN UNTO YOU, TO HEARKEN
[1:25:35] TO MY WORDS, FOR THESE ARE NOT DRUNK AS
[1:25:38] YOU SUPPOSED, BUT THIS IS THAT."
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS SPOKEN OUT BY THE PROPHET JOEL.
[1:25:45] IT'LL COME TO PASS IN THE LAST DAYS,
[1:25:47] I'LL POUR OUT OF MY SPIRIT UPON ALL
[1:25:49] FLESH.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; It was a witness.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, we're coming into these last
[1:25:55] and evil days
[1:25:57] when he's going to have witnesses.
[1:26:00] He's got to have witnesses. God lives.
[1:26:04] God's word is eternal. Now, let's take
[1:26:07] back to our scripture reading.
[1:26:10] Jesus coming off the mount. He was
[1:26:12] hungry and he looked in a tree
[1:26:15] and there was no fruit on it. He perhaps
[1:26:18] never raised his voice.
[1:26:20] He never stood out and said, "Now,
[1:26:21] gentlemen, stand to one side. I want to
[1:26:24] show you my power." He said, "I HAVE
[1:26:26] POWER TO MAKE THAT TREE do such and
[1:26:28] such." He never said that. He just
[1:26:31] walked up to it. He didn't find no
[1:26:34] nothing on it. So, he said, "No, man."
[1:26:36] He just knew walked away. Peter heard
[1:26:39] it.
[1:26:41] And the next day when he come back, oh,
[1:26:43] the tree was still there, but it was
[1:26:44] dead. And he remarked about it, how
[1:26:48] quick that tree had dried up from its
[1:26:49] roots. Jesus said, "No." And look, it
[1:26:52] wasn't the tree's fault. It was not time
[1:26:54] for figs yet. But he did it to magnify
[1:26:58] himself, to prove himself, to he was the
[1:27:01] Messiah. And that was one of the
[1:27:03] testimonies that he was the Messiah.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; That was a seal of his messiahship. The
[1:27:10] last seal was his resurrection, his
[1:27:12] ascension. That was the last steel of
[1:27:14] his messiahship. What he done was a
[1:27:17] proof that he was now he went around
[1:27:18] said all you treat. He just did it there
[1:27:21] so that the disciples that was going to
[1:27:24] write this scripture later would know
[1:27:26] that he was Messiah. Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; See
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; now then when Peter asked this question,
[1:27:34] behold how quick the tree witherth, then
[1:27:37] he said to them, if thou should say to
[1:27:40] this mountain, be moved and cast into
[1:27:42] the sea, and don't doubt, but believe
[1:27:45] that what you say will come to pass,
[1:27:47] you'll have what you say.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, that's part of the
[1:27:52] material in this great economy of God,
[1:27:55] this great ship that we're in, the old
[1:27:57] ship of Zion, in the body of Christ.
[1:28:01] Now to the testimony. It has been
[1:28:04] sometimes
[1:28:06] I've watched this.
[1:28:08] And now listen close now for a little
[1:28:10] teaching. There's been times in life
[1:28:14] when all when I've looked at the
[1:28:16] suffering and see those who were
[1:28:19] afflicted and tormented with demon
[1:28:21] powers,
[1:28:23] my heart just bleeds for him.
[1:28:26] And yet I've had him to call me on the
[1:28:28] telephone
[1:28:30] and in the meetings that clamor and move
[1:28:33] and draw and pull.
[1:28:36] It is so hard to say no to those people.
[1:28:40] Frankly, I can't do it. Somebody says it
[1:28:42] for me.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I can't get to them. How my heart just
[1:28:47] bleeds for them.
[1:28:49] Day after day I go through the tortures
[1:28:52] of that. I wonder sometimes
[1:28:57] and I then I console myself by going
[1:28:59] back to scripture see going through that
[1:29:01] place of Bethesda and seeing all those
[1:29:03] and afflicted and went over to
[1:29:04] one man healed in lay on a pallet and
[1:29:06] walked away and left the rest.
[1:29:09] But still down in my heart
[1:29:11] that makes me it doesn't take away that
[1:29:14] burning.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I wish there was something that
[1:29:18] could happen.
[1:29:20] Then I noticed yonder in Portland,
[1:29:23] Oregon that maniac that night run to the
[1:29:27] platform to kill me.
[1:29:29] I remember there something happened
[1:29:33] and it wasn't intellectuals at all.
[1:29:36] Intellectually, I would have run like
[1:29:37] the rest of preachers did, but I didn't
[1:29:41] run.
[1:29:42] There was something.
[1:29:45] GOD WAS GETTING READY TO DISPLAY HIS
[1:29:48] POWER.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; One time he said, "Be still and know
[1:29:53] that I'm God."
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; If the church would only stand still
[1:29:57] long enough,
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; God will do a little something. They'll
[1:29:59] get all excited and run around doing,
[1:30:02] see, get out of the will of God. be
[1:30:05] still. One time he's going to show his
[1:30:07] power in the Red Sea. He said, "RED SEA,
[1:30:09] YOU JUST stand still
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and he marched his children right
[1:30:13] through it."
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; What if they turn around and said,
[1:30:15] "Let's do it again, Lord." It wouldn't
[1:30:16] have happened.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Certainly not. One time he needed a
[1:30:20] little time to fight a battle, too.
[1:30:24] God just made the son stand still to
[1:30:26] watch what he's going to do.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Now, son, you just stand still in there
[1:30:30] a few minutes. I'm going to show you
[1:30:32] something.
[1:30:34] Now what if the next day Joshua say son
[1:30:36] stand still it would have done it.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; God was going to do something.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; He's going to give a witness to his
[1:30:43] power.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; His word is almighty and he's give a
[1:30:47] witness to it. One time there's a blind
[1:30:50] man come out from Jericho.
[1:30:53] And as Jesus passed through the blind
[1:30:55] man scream have mercy on me. And the
[1:30:58] Bible said and Jesus stood still.
[1:31:03] said, "Bring him here."
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Christ stood still for God was going to
[1:31:09] use him
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; to show his power.
[1:31:13] There might have been 100 more blind men
[1:31:14] down the road. I don't know. Perhaps the
[1:31:17] priest said, "Come here, MAN. WHO ARE
[1:31:20] YOU WHO RAISED THE DEAD? RAISE. WE GOT A
[1:31:22] GRAVEYARD FULL of them. We heard you
[1:31:23] raised Lazarus." But God was confirming
[1:31:26] his messiahship.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; That's what he was doing certainly. Now,
[1:31:32] I've often wondered what takes place.
[1:31:35] But there is a place that man can live
[1:31:40] so close to the presence of God. It's
[1:31:43] not by your choosing. It's by God's
[1:31:45] election
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; that you live IN THAT SPOT TO WHERE your
[1:31:49] own intellectuals has nothing more to do
[1:31:52] with it.
[1:31:54] down in South Africa. I was challenged
[1:31:57] by a bunch of witch doctors
[1:31:59] and standing there one among the dozen
[1:32:03] or more and them TRYING TO THROW SPELLS
[1:32:06] on me, but God just made them stand
[1:32:08] still.
[1:32:10] What's the glory of God to restore sight
[1:32:13] and blindness stuff to the afflicted
[1:32:16] people?
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Yonder in Carl's Route Germany. One
[1:32:21] afternoon when the spears come out to
[1:32:24] the they wanted to fuss with me at the
[1:32:27] hotel, the man wouldn't let him come in.
[1:32:29] They said we'll throw a spell on that
[1:32:31] meeting this afternoon and there'll be
[1:32:33] no one coming. No, I said we'll blow it
[1:32:35] down with the storm and the sky is
[1:32:38] pretty and bright. But when we got over
[1:32:41] there and just started the singing, up
[1:32:43] come a great powerful storm. There's
[1:32:45] about 20 on one side of it, 20 on the
[1:32:47] other. And they were all going through
[1:32:49] their enchantments and cutting their
[1:32:51] feathers with scissors and going through
[1:32:53] things like that to throw the spell. And
[1:32:56] all of a sudden that great 30,000 teeth
[1:33:00] begin to quiver and shake and the winds
[1:33:03] blowing. And I was preaching
[1:33:05] [clears throat] and something said,
[1:33:06] "Stand still."
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; I don't say excuse me. That means praise
[1:33:14] our God. AMEN.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; AND GOD MADE THAT STORM STAND STILL.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Move back TO SEE THE PRAISES OF GOD
[1:33:25] WHERE ABOUT 40,000 SOULS THAT DAY AND
[1:33:29] NIGHT SWEPT INTO THE KINGDOM of God by
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; stand still.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. He gives witness
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; yonder in Sweden or Switzerland.
[1:33:42] Well, I hear I say over in Finland one
[1:33:45] day, a little dead boy was laying on the
[1:33:48] side of the road.
[1:33:51] Automobile had run over him, mashed his
[1:33:53] little body to pieces. HE WAS SO BROKE
[1:33:57] UP UNTIL HIS FOOT WAS even to his
[1:33:59] stocking.
[1:34:01] The car run over HIM AND WRAPPED HIM UP
[1:34:02] LIKE A RAG like that and kicked him way
[1:34:05] up in the air and throw him across the
[1:34:06] road.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; HIS EYES IS BULGED OUT. HIS MOUTH IS
[1:34:10] OPEN. HIS TONGUE IS HANGING OUT. BLOOD
[1:34:11] RUNNING FROM his ears.
[1:34:13] But two years before there,
[1:34:17] God had showed the vision of it
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; and I walked up so stupid and looked at
[1:34:22] the child, walked away crying and
[1:34:25] [clears throat] the Lord or someone
[1:34:27] supernatural put their hands on my
[1:34:29] shoulder said, "Isn't that the boy I
[1:34:31] showed you?"
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a healing.
[1:34:36] There stood the mayor of the city, the
[1:34:38] chief man he's called, and many standing
[1:34:41] by.
[1:34:43] AND GOD HAD THEM TO STAND STILL
[1:34:47] THAT HE COULD SHOW HIS MIGHTY POWER TO
[1:34:50] RAISE THE DEAD.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Bring him back to life again.
[1:34:55] Stand still. Believe God. Be a witness.
[1:34:59] His word's eternal.
[1:35:02] It was a few days ago
[1:35:05] when we were just TO SEE HOW GOD does
[1:35:08] things so simple and we were so
[1:35:11] frustrated till we look for great big
[1:35:13] things.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Be satisfied with little things.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Watch him when he does his glorious
[1:35:20] works.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; How he protects you. Don't be looking
[1:35:24] way over the top of something. Look down
[1:35:26] here.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:28] Notice I begin to think this that it is
[1:35:33] possible
[1:35:34] that when a man like the apostles
[1:35:38] and when you can live close to God AND
[1:35:42] GOD TO HIS GRACE OPERATES THROUGH you
[1:35:45] that the MORE GOD YOU GET THE MORE GODLY
[1:35:48] YOU BECOME.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; The more eternal life comes in the more
[1:35:53] of the intellectual it pushes out.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Now I don't mean to be a fanatic. I mean
[1:35:58] to be a real sane sound believer.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Not a bunch of ism but a real solid true
[1:36:07] sensible intelligent believer.
[1:36:22] Amen. God bless you. How many thank the
[1:36:23] Lord for the word?
[1:36:25] An intelligent believer. That's what he
[1:36:28] says. A sane, sensible,
[1:36:31] intelligent believer. Amen. We will uh
[1:36:36] we just want to thank the Lord for his
[1:36:38] word tonight. So, so good. And we'll
[1:36:42] continue to listen to that. Uh let's
[1:36:45] sing that old hymn, What a Friend We
[1:36:47] Have in Jesus.
[1:36:50] before we prepare to go.
[1:36:54] What
[1:36:56] a friend
[1:36:58] have in Jesus. [singing]
[1:37:04] All
[1:37:06] our [singing and music] sins and grief
[1:37:09] to bear.
[1:37:14] And what
[1:37:16] [singing and music] a privilege
[1:37:19] to care
[1:37:22] [singing and music]
[1:37:28] [music and singing] to God in prayer.
[1:37:35] and
[1:37:36] oh
[1:37:38] we [singing and music]
[1:37:40] off
[1:37:45] and oh
[1:37:48] what needless [singing and music] pain
[1:37:50] we bear
[1:37:56] and all
[1:37:58] because we do not air
[1:38:03] bring every ever every
[1:38:09] to God in prayer. [singing and music]
[1:38:13] Have we trials
[1:38:16] and have
[1:38:18] [music] we trials
[1:38:20] and temptation?
[1:38:22] [singing]
[1:38:23] [music]
[1:38:27] Is
[1:38:28] there trouble
[1:38:30] anywhere? [singing and music]
[1:38:36] And we
[1:38:38] should never [singing and music] be
[1:38:41] disturbed.
[1:38:44] Praise [music]
[1:38:48] [singing]
[1:38:49] to the Lord in prayer.
[1:38:53] [music]
[1:38:56] Can
[1:38:58] we find a friend so faithful?
[1:39:03] [music]
[1:39:04] [singing]
[1:39:06] And who
[1:39:09] will all our [music]
[1:39:11] sorrow share? [singing]
[1:39:14] Jesus knows. [music]
[1:39:17] He
[1:39:19] just goes [singing] on every weakness
[1:39:23] [music]
[1:39:29] to the Lord in prayer. [singing]
[1:39:33] Can you just [music] play that?
[1:39:40] The Lord is [music] really our own only
[1:39:43] friend. He is the true friend. You'll
[1:39:46] never find a friend like Jesus.
[1:39:49] He'll be with you to the end. He knows
[1:39:52] [music]
[1:39:53] all about it. And we simply place all
[1:39:56] [singing] of our problems, all of our
[1:39:58] cares, all of our concerns in the hands
[1:40:02] of our great friend, the Lord [music]
[1:40:04] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. There's
[1:40:07] [singing] no one like him.
[1:40:10] Amen.
[1:40:12] Are we weak and heavy laden?
[1:40:16] And on
[1:40:19] we we [music and singing]
[1:40:21] have heavy laden
[1:40:27] comed

[1:40:44] for you. Take it [music and singing]
[1:40:49] to the Lord in prayer [singing]
[1:40:56] and do
[1:40:59] thy [music and singing] friends despise.
[1:41:03] Forsake thee. [music] They forsake thee,
[1:41:07] they
[1:41:09] get you. [music]

[1:41:24] thee. [singing]

[1:47:12] Amen. Let's all [music] stand to our
[1:47:14] feet. God bless you. And we will go to
[1:47:17] the Lord in prayer. I'll ask brother
[1:47:20] John Yarbo to dismiss us in a word of
[1:47:23] prayer tonight and then if he has some
[1:47:26] songs to sing of praise and worship. The
[1:47:29] altar is always open and you can pray
[1:47:32] right at your seat. You can come right
[1:47:34] in the front to pray and talk it over
[1:47:36] with Jesus. He's here to heal you and to
[1:47:40] deliver you. His word [music] is so
[1:47:43] true. I so enjoy that message tonight.
[1:47:46] The title of that message was believe
[1:47:49] from the heart. We thank God for [music]
[1:47:51] it. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:47:57] We just love you so much. As we've been
[1:48:01] singing, what a privilege it is to carry
[1:48:03] whatever we have need of to you, Lord.
[1:48:05] And Lord, knowing that whatever we're
[1:48:07] going through that you also went through
[1:48:10] and were tempted and were tried and were
[1:48:12] tested and and so Lord, you understand.
[1:48:15] you understand what it is that we're
[1:48:17] going through. And there's times we feel
[1:48:19] that no one can understand. But Lord,
[1:48:21] what a comfort it is to know that you've
[1:48:24] been through it, Lord Jesus. And you did
[1:48:26] it just for me, Lord. And I just I
[1:48:28] [music] love you so much for it, Lord.
[1:48:31] Lord, we just thank you for church
[1:48:34] family that you've given to us, Lord.
[1:48:38] And Lord, may it not be that you're the
[1:48:41] only one that we can go to, but Lord,
[1:48:43] that as we look around, we have a family
[1:48:45] [music] of brethren and sisters that
[1:48:46] that
[1:48:48] have the same love that you showed for
[1:48:50] us, Lord. And Lord, that they have the
[1:48:52] same burden for us, that that they have
[1:48:54] the same care and compassion. And Lord,
[1:48:57] may that be our heart's cry, Lord, that
[1:48:58] [music] we become that way. Make us more
[1:49:00] like thee. We sing, Lord. Give us a
[1:49:03] heart that's filled with love, Lord
[1:49:04] Jesus.
[1:49:06] Lord, we just thank you for your
[1:49:08] goodness, your faithfulness to us. We
[1:49:10] [music] have so much to thank you for,
[1:49:12] Lord. And we just want to take one more
[1:49:15] opportunity to tell you how much we love
[1:49:17] you,
[1:49:19] Lord. We can say it's been good to be in
[1:49:21] the house of the Lord today. And Lord,
[1:49:23] we just ask that you would just keep our
[1:49:25] mind stayed on you through the course of
[1:49:27] the week. Lord, we just thank you for
[1:49:28] what you're doing in our life, Lord
[1:49:30] Jesus. We thank you what you're going to
[1:49:32] do. And we just we love you so much. Ask
[1:49:36] in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:44] Amen.
[1:49:48] Amen. Maybe we could sing that song.
[1:49:51] You're up against a struggle. I will
[1:49:53] praise the Lord. This may be more of a
[1:49:56] special song, but just feel it on my
[1:49:58] heart.
[1:49:59] You can be seated if you'd like, but
[1:50:02] well, when you're up against a struggle
[1:50:07] that shatters all your dreams,
[1:50:11] your hopes have been cruy crushed by
[1:50:15] Satan's [music] manifested schemes,
[1:50:19] and you feel [singing] the urge within
[1:50:22] you to submit [music] to earthly fears.
[1:50:27] Don't let the faith you're standing in
[1:50:30] [singing]
[1:50:31] seem to disappear.
[1:50:34] But praise the [music] Lord.
[1:50:37] [singing]
[1:50:39] He can work through those who praise
[1:50:42] him. Praise [singing] the Lord
[1:50:47] for our [music] God inhabits. [singing]
[1:50:49] Praise.
[1:50:51] Praise the Lord
[1:50:54] [music]
[1:50:55] for the chains that seem to bind you
[1:50:59] serve only to remind [music and singing]
[1:51:01] you that they'll drop powerless behind
[1:51:05] you when you praise
[1:51:09] [singing] him.
[1:51:14] Now, Satan is a liar and [music] he
[1:51:19] wants to make us [singing] think that we
[1:51:22] are poppers when he knows [music]
[1:51:25] himself that we're children of the king.
[1:51:29] So, lift [music and singing] up the
[1:51:31] mighty shield of faith for the battle
[1:51:35] must be won. We know that Jesus Christ
[1:51:39] is risen and the works are already done.
[1:51:44] [music and singing]
[1:51:44] So praise the Lord.
[1:51:49] He can [music and singing] work through
[1:51:50] those who praise him. Praise the Lord
[1:51:55] [singing]
[1:51:57] for our God inhabits. Praise. Praise the
[1:52:01] Lord [singing and music]
[1:52:04] for the chains that seem to bind you
[1:52:08] serve only to [singing and music]
[1:52:10] remind you when they drop powerless
[1:52:14] behind you. When you praise
[1:52:18] [music and singing] him,
[1:52:20] when you praise
[1:52:22] him, when you [singing and music] praise
[1:52:29] him,
[1:52:31] [music]
[1:52:31] when you praise
[1:52:39] the Lord. [singing and music]
[1:52:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:47] He [music] can work through those who
[1:52:49] praise him. Praise the Lord [singing]
[1:52:55] for our God inhabits.
[1:52:58] Praise [music and singing] the Lord
[1:53:02] for the change that seemed divine.
[1:53:06] Serve [music and singing] only to remind
[1:53:09] you that they'll drop powerless
[1:53:12] [singing and music] behind you. when you
[1:53:15] praise. Let's sing that second verse
[1:53:17] together one more time. Now Satan is
[1:53:18] [music] a liar. He wants to make us
[1:53:21] think. Now Satan is a liar
[1:53:26] and he wants to make us think that we
[1:53:30] are poppers when he [singing] knows
[1:53:33] himself that we're [music] children of
[1:53:36] the king.
[1:53:37] So lift up the mighty
[1:53:39] [music and singing]
[1:53:40] shield of fame for the battle must be
[1:53:44] won. We know that Jesus
[1:53:47] [music and singing] Christ is risen and
[1:53:50] the works already done. Oh, praise the
[1:53:54] Lord. [music]
[1:53:56] [singing]
[1:53:57] He can work with those who praise him.
[1:54:00] Praise the [music] Lord [singing]
[1:54:05] for our God inherit his prep for praise.
[1:54:09] Praise [music and singing] the Lord
[1:54:13] for the chains that seem divine.
[1:54:15] [singing]
[1:54:17] Serve [music] only to remind you.
[1:54:20] They'll draw power lust behind you when
[1:54:24] you praise
[1:54:27] him.
[1:54:28] When you praise
[1:54:31] him, when you [singing and music] praise
[1:54:37] him, [singing]
[1:54:40] when you praise
[1:54:47] the Lord, [music and singing]
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; and I [music and singing]
[1:54:57] will praise Praise the Lord.
[1:55:03] Yes, [music and singing] I
[1:55:05] will praise
[1:55:07] the Lord
[1:55:11] no matter [music and singing] what
[1:55:13] tomorrow. Praise what it has in store. I
[1:55:19] know [music and singing] why I will
[1:55:21] praise
[1:55:23] the Lord. [singing and music]
[1:55:26] Oh, I know that I

[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Empty [singing and music]
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; and broken,
[1:56:38] I came back [singing]
[1:56:41] to him.
[1:56:45] of a soul
[1:56:47] so unworthy
[1:56:51] and [music and singing] so scared
[1:56:53] by sin.
[1:56:56] But he did not [singing]
[1:56:58] [music]
[1:56:59] did not despair.
[1:57:01] He started over
[1:57:05] again. [music]
[1:57:08] Oh, I bless
[1:57:10] the name. [music]
[1:57:12] He did not throw [singing]
[1:57:15] this clay away
[1:57:20] over
[1:57:22] and over. [music]
[1:57:25] He molds [singing] me and he makes me
[1:57:31] into
[1:57:33] his likeness.
[1:57:36] passions [singing and music]
[1:57:39] the clay
[1:57:41] of vessels
[1:57:44] of water
[1:57:47] [music] I am today. [singing]
[1:57:52] Oh, it's all because Jesus
[1:57:57] did not [music and singing] throw
[1:57:59] the clay away.
[1:58:03] Now [singing] he is
[1:58:06] the potter.
[1:58:09] I am the clay. [singing]
[1:58:14] Molded
[1:58:16] in [music] his image
[1:58:19] how he wants me to [music] stay. Aren't
[1:58:23] you thankful for this? When I [singing]
[1:58:25] stumble,
[1:58:27] when I fall,
[1:58:30] and [music and singing] my veil
[1:58:33] grace,
[1:58:35] he just picks [music] up all the pieces.
[1:58:40] He never throws [singing] the table away
[1:58:49] and [singing] over.
[1:58:52] He [music] holds me and [singing] makes
[1:58:56] me
[1:58:58] into
[1:59:00] his likeness. [singing]
[1:59:02] He fashions
[1:59:05] [music] the claim, [singing]
[1:59:08] a vessel
[1:59:10] of honor. [music and singing]
[1:59:13] I am today. [singing]
[1:59:18] It's all [music]
[1:59:20] because Jesus
[1:59:23] did not throw
[1:59:25] the clay away. [singing]
[1:59:32] Amen. Feel free to go whenever you'd
[1:59:34] like to
[1:59:35] just continue to worship
[1:59:40] [singing]
[1:59:44] a river.
[1:59:49] that flows
[1:59:52] [singing and music] from me
[1:59:55] with him. [singing]
[2:00:01] And [music] there
[2:00:04] is
[2:00:07] a mountain [singing]
[2:00:11] [music]
[2:00:12] that frees
[2:00:15] the soul
[2:00:17] from sin.

[2:00:37] a [singing]
[2:00:40] life. [music]

[2:00:47] is
[2:00:50] a [singing and music]
[2:00:50] river
[2:00:55] that [singing and music] never
[2:00:58] shall
[2:01:00] run [singing] dry.
[2:01:03] [music]
[2:01:05] There was [singing]
[2:01:08] a thirsty

[2:01:11] woman
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; who was [singing] drawing
[2:01:19] from [music]
[2:01:21] hell. [singing]
[2:01:26] Her life
[2:01:28] [music] was ruined
[2:01:31] and wasted [singing]
[2:01:36] and [music] her soul
[2:01:39] was bound
[2:01:41] for hell. Oh, but then then she [music]
[2:01:45] met [singing] Oh, but then
[2:01:49] she met
[2:01:52] the [singing and music] master
[2:01:57] and he [music] told
[2:02:00] her [singing] of
[2:02:02] her sin.
[2:02:07] He [music] said, [singing]
[2:02:09] "If you drink
[2:02:11] from this water,
[2:02:17] you will never [music and singing]
[2:02:20] thirst
[2:02:22] again." [singing]
[2:02:26] Oh,
[2:02:27] and there [music and singing]
[2:02:30] there is
[2:02:32] a river.
[2:02:37] that [singing] flows
[2:02:40] from [music] deep
[2:02:42] within. [singing]
[2:02:47] Yes, [music] there
[2:02:50] is
[2:02:52] a [singing] mountain [music]
[2:02:56] that freaks
[2:02:59] the [music] song
[2:03:02] from sin. [singing]
[2:03:04] Won't
[2:03:07] you come
[2:03:09] [music] to

[2:03:39] shall [music]
[2:03:40] run.
