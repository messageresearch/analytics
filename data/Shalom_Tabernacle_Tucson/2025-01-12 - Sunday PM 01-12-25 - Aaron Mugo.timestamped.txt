[48:14] enjoyed it it's uh it's uh first time
[48:18] I've had Mexican food
[48:20] apparently cuz anything before this was
[48:22] not Mexican
[48:24] food and uh I was blessed by that I'm
[48:27] blessed by Brother Moore being able to
[48:30] he he's been hosting us him and his wife
[48:32] his family very kind and uh uh I
[48:35] appreciate the invite to come share the
[48:37] word with you um I bring greetings from
[48:40] the Saints back at our church we've had
[48:42] some ministers come through here um and
[48:45] uh I I couldn't possibly fill their
[48:47] shoes brother lingar brother Chris Kathy
[48:49] brother uh Trevor Eman I couldn't
[48:52] possibly do that but uh I hope whatever
[48:55] word here that the Lord uh gave me to
[48:57] give to you is um is a blessing right
[49:00] mate um if you'd open your Bibles we're
[49:03] going to go to Deuteronomy
[49:09] 6 that'll be Deuteronomy chapter 6 and
[49:13] verse
[49:24] six it says in these words which I
[49:27] command thee this day shall be in thine
[49:29] heart and thou shalt teach them
[49:32] diligently unto thy children and shalt
[49:34] talk of them when thou sest in thine
[49:36] house and when thou walkest by the way
[49:40] and when thou liest down and when thou
[49:42] risest
[49:43] up and thou shalt bind them for a sign
[49:46] upon thine hand and they shall be as
[49:47] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[49:50] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[49:52] house and on thy Gates you may be seated
[49:55] thank you
[50:01] so
[50:03] um it's hard to know where to begin
[50:06] because there's so much to share
[50:10] um this scripture here is talking about
[50:12] the word and
[50:15] uh there's so much word to share right
[50:18] you know we we come to church all the
[50:19] time and we get to hear an amazing
[50:22] pastor and evangelist and brother over
[50:24] here brother Moore whoever whoever's
[50:26] local and ministering in the church um
[50:30] and you can't possibly remember it all
[50:32] right nobody expects you to you're not
[50:34] going no one expects you to do that um
[50:37] and yet it's telling you to bind it in
[50:39] your heart right so uh whenever I read
[50:42] that I'm thinking to myself I need to
[50:44] let that word whatever it is I may not
[50:46] remember every single sentence that
[50:47] somebody says when they're preaching or
[50:49] I may not remember everything I read in
[50:51] the Bible or here on a tape but I will
[50:54] let it affect my heart and let my heart
[50:57] be changed I can do that right that's
[51:00] all we want right uh that's why I asked
[51:03] my wife actually to sing that song Thank
[51:05] you for singing that love um word of God
[51:07] speak because we come here to hear God's
[51:09] word right um we don't want to hear
[51:12] people's opinion right like if I came
[51:14] over here and I didn't read any quotes
[51:15] or scriptures and I was trying to preach
[51:17] to you guys you probably would You' be
[51:18] like Israel are you sure about this guy
[51:21] why' you bring him here and if they
[51:22] didn't show it to you over here you
[51:24] wouldn't like that right but if you know
[51:26] the SCE and where the source is coming
[51:28] from then you know you're kind of
[51:31] willing to receive right right okay now
[51:34] stick with me here
[51:36] um I'm going to prove that there are
[51:39] words that God gives us and when God
[51:42] gives you a word it's your duty and your
[51:46] right to speak that word okay not just
[51:48] to hear
[51:50] it but to speak it all right so just
[51:53] listen here uh let's go actually in you
[51:57] can just follow with me in the Bible if
[51:58] you have your Bibles uh Genesis chapter
[52:01] 2 verse 25 I'm going to start bringing
[52:03] some words out in the scripture right
[52:06] and these are from your actual Bible so
[52:08] you don't have to doubt anything I'm
[52:10] saying because I'm going to read it to
[52:11] you and you're going to read it
[52:12] yourselves right promise me come on come
[52:14] on you're going to read it yourselves
[52:16] right yeah all right there's your
[52:20] guarantee Genesis 2:25 I'm going to talk
[52:23] about this word uh the word
[52:27] naked it says and they were both naked
[52:29] the man and his wife and were not
[52:30] ashamed so that's right after the
[52:33] creation of man and his wife and God
[52:37] gave them physical bodies and they were
[52:39] naked but get this they didn't know that
[52:42] right they were not ashamed because they
[52:44] didn't know it so they didn't know this
[52:46] word so whenever God was speaking to
[52:48] them it was not in their vocabulary
[52:50] right yeah okay so skip over to Genesis
[52:54] chapter 3
[52:56] this is right after they ate of the
[52:58] fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good
[52:59] and Evil that fruit they were told not
[53:01] to eat of and that's uh verse 7 and it
[53:04] says and the eyes of them both were
[53:07] opened and they knew that they were
[53:09] naked see right before that they did not
[53:11] have a need for this word in their
[53:12] vocabulary
[53:14] right and they sewed fig leaves together
[53:17] and made themselves aprons so up until
[53:19] this point they don't know this word
[53:22] naked and God created them for a purpose
[53:25] amen and he created them uh in in order
[53:29] to to be to have dominion over the world
[53:31] right that's what God told man to do he
[53:34] had him name all of his creation he had
[53:36] him completely in control of everything
[53:38] and so their purpose was just to follow
[53:40] that purpose that God had created them
[53:41] for but then whenever this word enters
[53:45] into their vocabulary and they know this
[53:47] word and they start applying this word
[53:49] well guess what where did the word come
[53:50] from it didn't come from God he didn't
[53:53] teach them this word right it's her
[53:56] interest interaction Eve with the
[53:57] serpent and with the Devil the devil is
[54:00] the one who taught her this word and so
[54:03] when the devil taught her this word she
[54:04] starts applying this word on her own
[54:06] self and then she comes to this point
[54:08] where she starts professing that and
[54:10] then when her language and her
[54:12] vocabulary changes her purpose changes
[54:15] and their purpose Chang and it stopped
[54:17] being about having dominion and telling
[54:19] doing what God told them to do and the
[54:21] purpose became cover my nakedness they
[54:24] started sewing up fig leaves because
[54:26] their purpose changed because their
[54:27] language changed and their language
[54:30] didn't come from
[54:36] God so you know you know it goes down in
[54:39] verse 10 same
[54:41] chapter verse n actually God God is
[54:44] looking for Adam he's like you're you're
[54:45] not doing what I called you to do right
[54:47] so he starts walking around he's like
[54:48] Adam Where Art Thou it says in the Lord
[54:50] God called unto Adam and said unto him
[54:52] where art thou verse 10 and he said I
[54:54] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[54:56] was afraid because I was naked and I hid
[54:59] myself in the first thing God is like
[55:01] whoa you're using a word I've never even
[55:03] heard come out of your lips he said and
[55:06] he said who told you that th was naked
[55:08] cuz something changed here that you're
[55:11] saying about yourself that I didn't say
[55:13] about you and from there was a down
[55:16] downhill slope right there for
[55:19] mankind not there are a lot of things
[55:22] people have told us in our lives about
[55:24] ourselves and the problem with us as
[55:27] humans as we accept those
[55:29] things and then once we start professing
[55:32] those things we don't get to live up to
[55:34] our
[55:35] potential a lot of things in life now if
[55:38] we actually just took the thing took the
[55:41] word and said okay the God said
[55:43] something about me right he said I am a
[55:45] chosen generation I'm a royal priesthood
[55:48] those are great words but then when we
[55:50] start throwing that aside and we start
[55:52] hearing words like oh I just went to the
[55:54] dentist he told me I had menitis
[55:58] menitis tell me is the word menitis in
[56:01] the Bible no if God said that I don't
[56:05] have that then I don't have that if God
[56:08] said that he's going to heal me and keep
[56:09] me away from things like menitis like
[56:12] cancer that's not in the Bible but here
[56:15] they are people what you do is you go to
[56:17] the doctor and through his manly wisdom
[56:19] with words that doctors made up and then
[56:22] start applying to us and he tells you oh
[56:24] here's your diagnosis you have periodon
[56:26] Titus I'm just using medical terms I
[56:28] don't really know what they
[56:30] mean but they're not in here so I don't
[56:32] need to know what they
[56:34] mean
[56:36] right God didn't apply that word to me
[56:38] so that's not a word for me that's not
[56:41] in my vocabulary if he says I am loved
[56:44] then I am loved if he says I am perfect
[56:47] then I am
[56:49] perfect maybe I can't see that right now
[56:51] with my own lip with my own eyes maybe I
[56:54] can't see that right this second but I
[56:56] can profess it because God told me that
[56:58] I'm going to be perfected God told me
[57:00] that I have a theophany God told me that
[57:03] I am his bride and those things are
[57:05] things that I can apply for
[57:07] myself as soon as I keep speaking those
[57:10] words over my life those words over the
[57:14] lives of my brother and my sister stop
[57:16] dragging people down with your words
[57:18] people you're tearing them down you're
[57:21] bringing them
[57:23] down parents of children you just keep
[57:25] telling them they they're failure that
[57:28] they're never going to grow up to be
[57:29] something that's a pet pee for me that's
[57:32] a pet pee for me cuz then those same
[57:34] children you drag them all the way to
[57:35] church and say you have to be in service
[57:37] and guess what those children come and
[57:39] start talking to ministers like my dad
[57:41] he said the worst things about me what
[57:43] am I supposed to say you
[57:49] create if you think about
[57:52] it if you think about
[57:54] it God
[57:57] uses his
[57:58] words and every time he speaks something
[58:01] he can't take it back because it's
[58:02] perfect that's right right that's
[58:05] because he's a Creator right he is
[58:07] perfect he can't say a promise without
[58:09] it coming to pass he can't pronounce a
[58:12] blessing without it coming to pass he
[58:14] can't pronounce a curse without it
[58:15] coming to pass so everything he says has
[58:17] to be good in his mind before he says it
[58:22] right and what are we his children sir
[58:26] that's right are we not amateur creators
[58:29] huh those same
[58:33] people who start professing bad things
[58:35] over their children or pastors who say
[58:39] bad things about their congregation
[58:40] you're not perfect you you you need to
[58:42] go get baptized you're a sinner you're
[58:44] useless you're
[58:45] worthless those things they just keep
[58:48] pronouncing them over the
[58:49] people and then what they do is they
[58:51] create these broken
[58:53] creatures and then say this is my
[58:56] offering to the Lord what you that you
[58:59] used your power for the wrong thing it's
[59:01] a creative power and whenever you take a
[59:04] create a power of God and you know you
[59:06] know those are words that the devil
[59:08] makes up right and he starts to apply
[59:10] them on people he starts to use your
[59:12] lips to speak upon people with your own
[59:15] mouth and if those words came from the
[59:18] Devil the devil can't can't create right
[59:21] he can't create he can pervert that's
[59:23] what the prophet said he said he
[59:24] perverts perverts so you're creating a
[59:27] perverted creature and then you're
[59:29] you're wondering why it's not perfect
[59:31] because that's not what God said about
[59:33] that child of yours that's not what God
[59:35] said about each one of the people in the
[59:37] congregation everybody here has the
[59:38] potential to get the Holy Spirit
[59:40] everybody has the potential to goow to
[59:42] be a perfect thing because God said so
[59:45] not my opinion not what I think it's
[59:48] what God Said
[59:57] in the Harvest Time
[1:00:00] 1964 uh brother brandom says in verse
[1:00:03] 241 says now notice if it was
[1:00:06] possible he's talking about deceiving
[1:00:08] the elect if it was possible in these
[1:00:10] days only one word one word is needed
[1:00:12] that's all satan had to have to Adam
[1:00:14] just get him on one word that's all he
[1:00:17] has to have today just get one thing
[1:00:19] turned around that's all that's all he
[1:00:21] needs now you know that's the truth to
[1:00:23] add one or take one it's total failure
[1:00:26] every bit every word of God think of now
[1:00:29] of the interpretations of the seminaries
[1:00:31] everyone different from the other so
[1:00:33] whenever we as Christians are supposed
[1:00:35] to take on the whole word of God yes
[1:00:38] it's great that you know the God sent a
[1:00:40] prophet yeah and he He restored all the
[1:00:42] word amen amen right He restored all the
[1:00:45] word and I can accept everything he said
[1:00:48] for myself but you can't leave a single
[1:00:51] thing
[1:00:51] out and how can you you don't have to
[1:00:55] I'm not saying you have to memorize
[1:00:57] everything that's in the table appp that
[1:00:58] that that's not going to happen right
[1:01:00] but you can accept everything in the
[1:01:02] table appp every time you hear what the
[1:01:05] prophet said for you in your day you can
[1:01:07] accept that and allow that to work
[1:01:09] itself on you right and if you do
[1:01:13] that then the devil will find fewer and
[1:01:16] fewer opportunities to get one over on
[1:01:17] You by adding or taking something away
[1:01:20] why because even though you might not
[1:01:22] have everything memorized when you hear
[1:01:24] something that's a little bit off does
[1:01:25] doesn't sound like the rest of it you
[1:01:27] realize huh that word isn't H I don't
[1:01:29] I'm not going to take that for myself
[1:01:31] because that doesn't line up with
[1:01:33] everything else that I heard
[1:01:37] amen I'm going to do a second word over
[1:01:39] here it is the word uh rain
[1:01:43] actually so in Genesis chapter 2 it
[1:01:47] says and this is uh God talking about
[1:01:51] this is God uh when he's uh creating the
[1:01:54] world so the world the way was made
[1:01:56] before is not the way it is right now in
[1:01:58] the past it didn't rain that wasn't a
[1:02:00] thing so if you read in the in the in
[1:02:04] Genesis chapter 2 right talks about the
[1:02:06] firmament of water and there's water
[1:02:08] above it and beneath it and uh we're
[1:02:10] going to read that right here it says in
[1:02:12] verse four these are the generations of
[1:02:14] the heavens and of the earth when they
[1:02:16] were created in the day that the Lord
[1:02:18] God made the earth and the heavens and
[1:02:20] every plant of the field before it was
[1:02:22] in the earth and every herb of the field
[1:02:24] before it grew for the Lord God had not
[1:02:26] caused it to rain upon the Earth and
[1:02:29] there was not a man to till the ground
[1:02:30] so rain was just not a thing not until
[1:02:35] Noah comes on the
[1:02:37] scene in Genesis
[1:02:40] 6 uh you you see God actually he's
[1:02:43] repenting because he made man because
[1:02:46] his works are evil and he decides that
[1:02:48] he's going to have to judge the Earth
[1:02:50] One Way or Another now we know that you
[1:02:52] know God he decided to judge him by by
[1:02:55] water that time and it's going to be
[1:02:57] fire next time but at that time he
[1:02:59] decided to use water and that's the
[1:03:01] reason that he had water above the
[1:03:02] firmament in the first place so he
[1:03:04] decides he's going to make it rain so
[1:03:06] what he does is uh in in Genesis 7 he's
[1:03:10] talking to Noah in verse four he says
[1:03:12] for yet seven days and I will cause it
[1:03:14] to rain upon the Earth 40 days and 40
[1:03:16] nights and every living substance that I
[1:03:18] made will I destroy from off the face of
[1:03:20] the Earth so at this point Noah he hears
[1:03:23] a message from God and
[1:03:26] he he he had actually heard from God
[1:03:28] before that in the chapter before and
[1:03:30] God had told him hey you I'm going to
[1:03:32] judge the Earth and all that stuff is
[1:03:33] going to happen so he's preaching for
[1:03:35] years until God comes back and reveals
[1:03:37] to him that it's going to rain it's
[1:03:39] going to be rain that's doing this so
[1:03:42] Noah goes to these people in this
[1:03:44] scientific age brother brandham tells us
[1:03:46] it was super scientific and he has to
[1:03:48] tell them hey water's gonna start
[1:03:51] falling from the sky and water's never
[1:03:53] done this before right and the
[1:03:56] scientists are just like well you know
[1:03:58] what we have we have all our instruments
[1:04:00] that measure this and that atmospheric
[1:04:02] pressure barometers blah blah blah
[1:04:04] science words insert and whenever he
[1:04:08] whenever they do that he he's like well
[1:04:10] it's going to rain and they're like rain
[1:04:11] what is that that doesn't that that's
[1:04:14] not in our vocabulary they can look in
[1:04:16] every book they have they don't have the
[1:04:17] word rain but he said God said it's
[1:04:20] going to rain and he had to stick with
[1:04:23] that message now God he he was doing a
[1:04:26] new thing in that day and they had to
[1:04:28] accept that for themselves but they just
[1:04:31] couldn't get to that point just because
[1:04:33] they couldn't measure it with what they
[1:04:34] could see with their eyes or touch or
[1:04:36] feel they could have the only thing they
[1:04:38] could have latched on to was that Faith
[1:04:41] was was faith in what the word of God
[1:04:43] for the prophet was saying right and
[1:04:46] that was
[1:04:47] rain now if you come to um further on in
[1:04:51] the Bible we're still following just
[1:04:53] going in a straight line
[1:04:56] we're going to see the language that
[1:04:58] people are using what they're trying to
[1:04:59] do to pervert what God is saying and uh
[1:05:02] the next example is actually in Genesis
[1:05:04] chapter
[1:05:07] one um notice everything goes back to
[1:05:11] Genesis and then comes forward right
[1:05:13] Genesis 1 and two and then
[1:05:16] so back at the Tower of
[1:05:20] Babel um when before all languages
[1:05:23] started getting confused they started to
[1:05:25] try to imitate what God was doing and
[1:05:28] what they were imitating is what he had
[1:05:29] done in chapter
[1:05:32] 26 now man God decides to make man and
[1:05:37] he says in Genesis 26 it says and God
[1:05:39] said let us make man in our image just
[1:05:41] remember those two words let us make man
[1:05:44] in our image after our likeness and
[1:05:46] after that you know he creates man and
[1:05:48] to have dominion and everything then you
[1:05:50] skip over to Genesis 11 in verse 3 and 4
[1:05:55] the same same people who are building
[1:05:56] the Tower of Babel start trying to
[1:05:58] imitate what God was doing back then and
[1:06:00] they said one to another go to let us
[1:06:03] make brick and burn them thoroughly and
[1:06:05] they had brick for stone and slime had
[1:06:07] they for Mortar and they said go too let
[1:06:10] us build a city and a tower whose top
[1:06:12] May reach unto heaven and let us make a
[1:06:14] name lest we be scattered upon the face
[1:06:16] of the whole earth so they are imitating
[1:06:19] what God is saying but they're doing it
[1:06:22] the wrong way right and God knows
[1:06:25] because they they have this unity and
[1:06:27] this one Accord and everybody speaking
[1:06:29] one language he says they're actually
[1:06:31] going to be successful so in in uh verse
[1:06:34] 5 he says and the Lord came down to see
[1:06:36] the city and the tower which the
[1:06:37] children of man builded and the Lord
[1:06:39] said behold the people is one and they
[1:06:41] have one language and this they begin to
[1:06:43] do and now nothing will be restrained
[1:06:44] from them which they have imagined to do
[1:06:47] nothing's going to stop them because
[1:06:48] they have that one
[1:06:50] language remember back at the beginning
[1:06:52] when I started talking I said their
[1:06:54] purpose changed because their vocabulary
[1:06:57] changed so they start borrowing God's
[1:06:59] vocabulary and they have one purpose and
[1:07:01] one mind one Accord and they all have
[1:07:03] one language and their purpose is to
[1:07:06] build this Tower and God said they're
[1:07:08] going to be successful what could that
[1:07:09] mean for us as Christians if every
[1:07:11] Christian was speaking the same not the
[1:07:13] same Earthly language but God's language
[1:07:16] if everybody was speaking the language
[1:07:18] of the word and was actually doing the
[1:07:20] same thing together and everybody
[1:07:22] working together in the church what
[1:07:23] would happen if we as a church church
[1:07:25] right here locally how many people are
[1:07:28] in here like 50 60 70 I don't know how
[1:07:30] many people are here but if everybody
[1:07:31] who's listening to my voice was one
[1:07:33] Accord had one goal in mind and that was
[1:07:35] to further the kingdom of God what would
[1:07:38] happen nothing would stand in our way
[1:07:40] there'd be nothing to stop us but we all
[1:07:43] just have to get in tune with what God's
[1:07:45] telling us to do amen we just need to
[1:07:48] pray and get into that place wherever
[1:07:50] that that channel right there where God
[1:07:53] he's speaking straight into our minds
[1:07:54] and then we only speak the things that
[1:07:56] God says to to speak over our lives over
[1:07:59] our neighbors over those people around
[1:08:01] us what would
[1:08:03] happen we do better than building some
[1:08:05] dumb
[1:08:06] Tower it's not about building a
[1:08:09] church it's not about I I I don't know
[1:08:12] what it's it's about the kingdom of God
[1:08:14] it's not about a building much as God
[1:08:17] can bless you with a building amen but
[1:08:20] it's not about that it's about his
[1:08:22] kingdom what can we do for him can I do
[1:08:26] for Jesus what is he telling me in this
[1:08:27] moment to do that will help my brother
[1:08:29] and help my sister that's what I need to
[1:08:34] know so in verse 7 he says go to let us
[1:08:37] go down and there confound their
[1:08:39] language that they may not understand
[1:08:41] one another speech he hit them right
[1:08:42] where it hurt that's the one thing that
[1:08:45] was keeping them all
[1:08:47] together and we all know like come on
[1:08:50] humans love to divide over differences
[1:08:52] let's be honest right everybody finds a
[1:08:54] reason to not not like somebody and it's
[1:08:56] just how it works oh you were born the
[1:08:58] next County over I don't like you you
[1:09:01] must support that team you know and then
[1:09:03] automatically have a preconception about
[1:09:05] that person oh you're a different race
[1:09:07] than me ah I can't deal with you you
[1:09:10] know oh you speak a different language
[1:09:12] from me now all of these things humans
[1:09:15] are just built that way and God knows it
[1:09:18] but if we could get in one Accord and
[1:09:20] completely set aside those differences
[1:09:22] and realize that we're all of One blood
[1:09:25] all born of to the same God same baptism
[1:09:28] same same hope same faith if if if we
[1:09:31] could all get right in that channel and
[1:09:33] realize we have the same background
[1:09:34] because it came from before the
[1:09:36] foundation of the world we're all from
[1:09:38] the same place and that being said there
[1:09:41] is no difference between me and
[1:09:43] you there may be a difference in our
[1:09:46] understanding of the word but hey we're
[1:09:48] all one guess what God called us into
[1:09:51] the same word into the same faith and
[1:09:53] the same baptism
[1:09:57] so the Lord scattered them abroad from a
[1:09:59] face upon the uh from then upon the face
[1:10:02] of the Earth and they left off to build
[1:10:03] the city so their vocabulary changed and
[1:10:06] their purpose changed now I'm going to
[1:10:08] ask the sister at the back is it sister
[1:10:10] Melissa could you put up um the first
[1:10:13] picture it's like an image of where they
[1:10:17] uh dispersed from so the Tower of Babel
[1:10:20] it's generally believed to be around in
[1:10:22] Iraq in the Middle East and you can see
[1:10:25] where the children actually went to all
[1:10:27] the arrows are pointing in different
[1:10:28] directions so jaffi is you know he went
[1:10:31] up north to Europe and ham his children
[1:10:32] went down to Africa and then Shem was
[1:10:35] Asia and Middle East and all that stuff
[1:10:38] so that's where they all dispersed it
[1:10:41] and God ordained that he wanted them to
[1:10:43] be dispersed he wanted that that that
[1:10:45] whole plan of theirs to fall apart so
[1:10:48] the next word I'm going to focus
[1:10:50] on still moving down through your Bible
[1:10:52] amen going through Exodus going Exodus
[1:10:58] actually uh chapter
[1:11:01] 16 see God he might do a new thing in
[1:11:05] order to judge the Earth and that would
[1:11:07] be uh rain he he created something new
[1:11:10] that had never be done before just to
[1:11:12] judge the Earth but he can also do the
[1:11:14] same thing to bless us right if he
[1:11:16] decides he's going to give you something
[1:11:18] it doesn't matter what you've ever heard
[1:11:21] before if if it's never happened before
[1:11:23] he decided it's going to happen it's
[1:11:25] going to happen because he said so amen
[1:11:29] and he has to stand by his word 16 verse
[1:11:33] uh 14 it's talking about the first time
[1:11:36] Mana landed outside near the children of
[1:11:38] Israel it said when the Dew that was
[1:11:41] that lay was gone up behold upon the
[1:11:43] face of the Wilderness there lay a small
[1:11:45] round thing as small as the hor frost on
[1:11:47] the ground and when the children of
[1:11:49] Israel saw it they said one to another
[1:11:51] it is Mana for they wi not what it was
[1:11:54] it is Mana so they had to make up a new
[1:11:57] word because God was blessing them in a
[1:11:59] way that had never happened before they
[1:12:02] had to make up something to describe
[1:12:04] what was happening because what was
[1:12:06] happening was exceedingly abundantly
[1:12:08] above anything that anybody had ever
[1:12:11] experienced or seen before and they said
[1:12:13] oh wow mana and and if you look up the
[1:12:16] the definition for this word actually if
[1:12:19] you look it up the translation of it is
[1:12:21] what is
[1:12:22] it like the word just means what is it
[1:12:26] because I I don't know I don't know what
[1:12:28] this is it's just God did it that's all
[1:12:30] I can say and I receive it for
[1:12:33] me if God decided he's going to bless
[1:12:36] you if God decided that he's going to do
[1:12:38] something for you in your life there's
[1:12:40] nothing that can stand in the way of
[1:12:42] that and you might not be able to
[1:12:44] describe it and be like you know what if
[1:12:46] somebody ask me to testify it's it's
[1:12:48] terrifying standing up here with like I
[1:12:50] don't know how many people staring at
[1:12:51] you but maybe I can't get up here and
[1:12:54] testify but I can just say God did
[1:12:56] something and I'm so excited about that
[1:13:00] because God did something in my life and
[1:13:04] I just want him to get the glory from
[1:13:05] that
[1:13:08] amen I don't care what people said that
[1:13:10] was negative about me I don't know what
[1:13:12] they pronounced about me over my life
[1:13:14] and said oh brother Aaron's a loser
[1:13:16] brother Aaron's like I don't know he has
[1:13:18] a high voice he sounds like a girl yes
[1:13:20] that's true I mean I don't care but God
[1:13:23] bless me
[1:13:25] brother Aaron can't sing brother Aaron's
[1:13:28] uneducated brother Aaron he isn't even a
[1:13:30] brother he doesn't see the word the
[1:13:31] right way he's not even a good preacher
[1:13:34] he's garbage it doesn't matter God did
[1:13:36] something for me and I'm here to tell
[1:13:38] you about that and I'm only going to say
[1:13:40] what God said about me cuz I don't need
[1:13:42] to hear all that
[1:13:43] negativity that negativity is not for
[1:13:47] me God did something in my life that you
[1:13:50] can't describe and you can't replicate
[1:13:52] so don't you try to judge me with the
[1:13:53] words that the devil gave you you to
[1:13:55] speak out of your mouth on me I don't
[1:13:57] receive
[1:13:58] that ner ner when I was a kid you'd say
[1:14:02] I'm rubber you're glue whatever you say
[1:14:05] bounces off of me and sticks to you keep
[1:14:08] that for yourself I don't want to hear
[1:14:13] it God didn't say it the devil said it
[1:14:17] that's why the Jesus turned to Peter and
[1:14:19] said get behind me
[1:14:21] Satan now I don't prescribe saying that
[1:14:23] to your brother and your sister but I'll
[1:14:25] think it real hard
[1:14:35] [Laughter]
[1:14:41] though I'm going to say something new
[1:14:44] right something new something new right
[1:14:46] you want to hear a new word from the
[1:14:47] word amen yeah you want to hear it it's
[1:14:50] in here but it was new to them who Heard
[1:14:52] It For the First Time first person who
[1:14:54] heard it was
[1:14:56] Mary
[1:14:58] Mary Joseph's
[1:15:00] wife the very first person to hear
[1:15:03] it in Luke chapter 1 so if you think
[1:15:07] about it it was
[1:15:10] uh we're talking about down Through the
[1:15:12] Ages the
[1:15:13] word like you know Adam and Eve speaking
[1:15:16] the same language and then the devil
[1:15:19] perverting that language and adding
[1:15:21] words that they hadn't heard before so
[1:15:23] their language is already degrading
[1:15:26] and then uh when rain comes along
[1:15:28] judgment comes to the Earth and they
[1:15:30] have to incorporate that into their
[1:15:31] language too so negative things start
[1:15:33] happening to the language and then
[1:15:35] finally at the Tower of Babel their
[1:15:36] language is completely destroyed and
[1:15:37] there's so many languages throughout the
[1:15:39] world and nobody really knows that
[1:15:41] Heavenly language that God is speaking
[1:15:42] to them amen that Heavenly
[1:15:45] language and then God decides to do
[1:15:49] something to turn it around right so
[1:15:52] we're here in the scripture and we get
[1:15:54] to Luke chapter
[1:15:58] 1 uh verse 26 it says in the sixth month
[1:16:01] the angel Gabriel was sent from God into
[1:16:03] a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[1:16:06] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[1:16:07] Joseph of the house House of David and
[1:16:09] the virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[1:16:12] came in unto her and said hail thou thou
[1:16:15] that art highly favored so right
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:22] Mary is I don't know how old she was was
[1:16:25] probably 12 to 16 years old and she's a
[1:16:27] virgin now a Virgin uh she could control
[1:16:31] that right she can control being a
[1:16:33] virgin and that you know that's great
[1:16:35] for her virtue that's something she
[1:16:36] could do for herself but this Angel
[1:16:39] comes here and starts dropping language
[1:16:40] on her that she's never thought about
[1:16:43] before she like Mary is unheard of until
[1:16:46] this point in scripture right until the
[1:16:48] beginning of the gospels that's when you
[1:16:49] first hear her name that's Mary and and
[1:16:52] he says highly favored so she she has to
[1:16:56] hear that she heard this word and she's
[1:16:58] just like huh it's like okay uh no one's
[1:17:01] ever said that to me before reading on
[1:17:03] the Lord the Lord is with thee blessed
[1:17:05] art thou among women so highly favored
[1:17:08] and blessed I've never huh I've never
[1:17:11] really thought of myself as special but
[1:17:13] go on kind sir I want to hear what else
[1:17:15] you have to
[1:17:19] say it says and when she saw him she was
[1:17:22] troubled at his saying I would be too
[1:17:24] and cast in her mind what manner of
[1:17:26] salutation this should be and the angel
[1:17:28] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[1:17:30] found favor with God and behold Thou
[1:17:32] shalt conceive in thy womb and bring
[1:17:33] forth a son and shalt call his name
[1:17:36] Jesus so this time right here is the
[1:17:39] first time in all the generations of man
[1:17:42] from the fall of Adam up till now that
[1:17:44] this name has been spoken why is it
[1:17:46] important we're about to find out why do
[1:17:49] we baptize in his
[1:17:51] name why do we pray in his name why why
[1:17:54] is this so important that we say that
[1:17:57] now why is this name translated into
[1:17:59] more languages on the earth probably
[1:18:00] than most other words
[1:18:04] why and nobody had ever said this out
[1:18:07] loud
[1:18:10] before he skipped down and he's
[1:18:12] describing how Jesus is going to be
[1:18:14] great and called the son of the highest
[1:18:15] and skipped down to verse 36 says and
[1:18:17] behold thy cousin Elizabeth sheath also
[1:18:19] conceived a son in her old age and this
[1:18:22] is the sixth month with her who was
[1:18:23] called Baron so people called her Barren
[1:18:27] but when a Barren person
[1:18:30] conceives are they still
[1:18:33] Barren no no no no no she she she she
[1:18:37] had a something in her in her body got
[1:18:40] changed because she was told something
[1:18:42] and she had to accept that for herself
[1:18:45] and she was told something that had
[1:18:46] never happened before is that a Barren
[1:18:48] person suddenly receive life in their
[1:18:51] womb no no human could have made that
[1:18:53] happen sure Hannah I think Hannah made
[1:18:56] that happen with Samuel but she had to
[1:18:59] receive that word for herself and then
[1:19:02] that changed her situation because she
[1:19:04] professed that she was going to have a
[1:19:06] baby and it says for with God nothing
[1:19:08] shall be impossible and Mary said behold
[1:19:11] the manmade of the Lord so here's the
[1:19:13] reaction right whenever you hear these
[1:19:14] words that come from Angels or from the
[1:19:17] word of God or from the prophet that are
[1:19:19] spoken over you this is the reaction you
[1:19:21] need it says be it unto me according to
[1:19:24] Thy word and the angel departed from her
[1:19:28] he said oh she got it I don't need to
[1:19:30] stay here anymore he left he like she's
[1:19:32] saying that herself then that's it it
[1:19:35] doesn't matter so from that instant
[1:19:38] right there she may as well have been a
[1:19:40] mother because she said it and she
[1:19:42] accepted that word for herself she was a
[1:19:44] mother that's it and it it's crazy it's
[1:19:48] that simple he said I said a word over
[1:19:50] you and you said I accept it and then I
[1:19:53] and then start confessing it and that's
[1:19:55] it amen that's
[1:20:02] it the resurrection of Lazarus 1951
[1:20:05] brother brandom's talking about
[1:20:07] this same exact thing he says in just as
[1:20:10] she said I think it's verse 59 and just
[1:20:14] as she said Jesus Little John leaped in
[1:20:16] the mother's womb began to jump like
[1:20:18] that received life see she said be it
[1:20:22] unto me according to thy will but she
[1:20:25] hadn't actually said the word out loud
[1:20:28] that the angel gave her and whenever she
[1:20:30] spoke this word out loud for the very
[1:20:32] first time to Elizabeth something
[1:20:33] happened life came into a child life was
[1:20:38] spoken just by saying that word The
[1:20:40] First Time The Name of Jesus Christ was
[1:20:43] ever spoke by mortal lips a dead baby
[1:20:45] come to life in the womb of a mother
[1:20:47] brother if it will bring a dead baby to
[1:20:49] life what ought it to do a Born Again
[1:20:51] Church Hallelujah that's right no wonder
[1:20:54] it will make a walk the blind
[1:20:56] see deaf here the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:59] Little John in his mother's womb and
[1:21:00] Elizabeth said whence cometh the mother
[1:21:02] of my Lord to me said for as soon as thy
[1:21:04] salutation came to my ears my baby
[1:21:07] leaped in my womb for Joy what a
[1:21:12] baby what a
[1:21:14] baby hallelujah what a name my baby
[1:21:16] leaped in my womb for Joy when your
[1:21:18] salutation came to my ears
[1:21:20] this name changes everything
[1:21:25] thing it's not just something you throw
[1:21:28] around you know some people that's their
[1:21:30] they use it as a cuss
[1:21:32] word something scary happens to Jesus
[1:21:36] like that and that's they they don't
[1:21:39] know what they're doing they're just
[1:21:40] saying a noise at that point they're
[1:21:43] just spouting out nonsense that that
[1:21:45] doesn't that doesn't mean anything but
[1:21:47] whenever you take that word because it
[1:21:49] was given to us as children of man
[1:21:52] mankind was given this word by Angel and
[1:21:55] it was passed down through generation
[1:21:57] through generation and given to us in
[1:21:58] the scripture and a person in faith
[1:22:01] taking that word and actually saying it
[1:22:03] with their lips with faith that can
[1:22:06] change a situation there's a difference
[1:22:11] here so right now at this point the very
[1:22:16] word appeared in the
[1:22:19] word Jesus has entered the building and
[1:22:23] when Jesus ENT enters a building stuff
[1:22:25] starts to change in the Bible I'm going
[1:22:27] to keep tracking it along it says in uh
[1:22:29] Matthew 7 it says in in uh verse 28 it
[1:22:34] says and it came to pass when Jesus had
[1:22:35] ended these sayings he started preaching
[1:22:37] to people it says the people were
[1:22:39] astonished at his Doctrine for he taught
[1:22:41] them as one having Authority and not as
[1:22:44] the scribes and the reason he taught
[1:22:45] them as one having Authority is because
[1:22:47] he's just speaking what he is he was the
[1:22:50] living embodiment of the word of God
[1:22:53] everything that he comes out of his
[1:22:54] mouth is going to be pure and of course
[1:22:57] it has Authority now if you if if I'm
[1:22:59] going around and and you if you go
[1:23:01] around you've heard my name and somebody
[1:23:03] says Aaron Mugo Aaron Mugi Mugo that's
[1:23:06] my full name if if if you go around and
[1:23:08] start talking to people and asking them
[1:23:10] about me they'll be like well you know
[1:23:14] what do I know about him
[1:23:16] right well I could ask you and you'd be
[1:23:18] like well he's tall all right I could
[1:23:20] ask you you say girl voice right I could
[1:23:23] ask you You' probably say well he's
[1:23:25] black
[1:23:27] yes ask you and say he's a male but none
[1:23:31] of you really knows
[1:23:33] me and you could ask my wife and she'd
[1:23:36] know a lot right sister Becca please
[1:23:39] tell me all about Aaron I'll tell you
[1:23:40] lots of stuff about him but if you
[1:23:44] really want to know who has the most
[1:23:46] Authority about me who are you going to
[1:23:48] go talk to that's right that was that
[1:23:51] wasn't a rhetorical question who are you
[1:23:52] going to go talk to me right so if I
[1:23:56] come over here and I start telling you
[1:23:58] about myself would you trust me whenever
[1:24:00] I tell you I don't like cherry pie I
[1:24:03] think it's garbage I don't know why
[1:24:05] people made that now do you know if I'm
[1:24:08] lying or not you don't
[1:24:11] know why I just told you I hate cherry
[1:24:16] pie like that's a fact like you don't
[1:24:19] have to ask somebody else's opinion cuz
[1:24:21] it came out of my mouth I don't like
[1:24:23] cherry pie
[1:24:24] and I know that might be divisive for
[1:24:26] some people but it's it's awful thank
[1:24:29] you brother George I like you like I
[1:24:32] don't think it's good but if you ask I
[1:24:34] don't know what that boy's name what's
[1:24:35] your name Angel awesome I love the name
[1:24:39] okay so somebody asked Angel what is
[1:24:42] Aaron like you can't trust him right he
[1:24:44] might have read up on me but he's never
[1:24:47] even met
[1:24:48] me he might have read my birth
[1:24:50] certificate he might read my password he
[1:24:52] might read my ID he might know VAR facts
[1:24:55] but he that's just what he thinks he
[1:24:57] knows until he actually meets me so
[1:25:00] Jesus having Authority
[1:25:02] here there it's not a mystery he's just
[1:25:06] telling you about himself he says search
[1:25:09] the scriptures because all of this stuff
[1:25:11] is just testifying about me here I am
[1:25:15] and the Pharisees just weren't able to
[1:25:18] accept
[1:25:20] that in the Harvest time he says how did
[1:25:23] they know he wasn't wrong because God
[1:25:25] Vindicated every word that he promised
[1:25:27] to him in that age that's the reason
[1:25:30] they knowed he was the Messiah why just
[1:25:31] cuz he's talking about himself he has
[1:25:34] the most Authority about himself not
[1:25:37] Angel and much as I'm married to Becca
[1:25:41] she's not the authority on me I'm the
[1:25:44] authority on me so if you go along Jesus
[1:25:48] comes and he has his Earthly Ministry
[1:25:49] and he gets taken up and then he you
[1:25:51] know he he he he leaves behind he sends
[1:25:53] the Holy Ghost and they're waiting in
[1:25:55] there for 10 days uh his disciples at
[1:25:58] his
[1:25:59] behest says uh Terry in Jerusalem until
[1:26:02] you're endued with power from on high
[1:26:05] and so they're they're waiting and I
[1:26:06] want to show you something that
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:11] happens in Acts chapter 2 verse
[1:26:20] 5 says and it says and there were
[1:26:23] dwelling in Jerusalem Jews devout men
[1:26:27] out of every nation under
[1:26:30] heaven now when this was noised abroad
[1:26:33] the multitude came together and they're
[1:26:34] confounded because that every man heard
[1:26:36] them speak in his own language and they
[1:26:38] were all amazed and marveled saying one
[1:26:40] to another behold are not all these
[1:26:42] which spake
[1:26:44] galileans now and it says and how hear
[1:26:47] we every man in our own tongue wherein
[1:26:49] we were born so all these people from
[1:26:51] all parts of the world are joined
[1:26:54] together
[1:26:55] and contrary to what was happening back
[1:26:58] in the Tower of Babel where God confused
[1:27:01] languages he takes all these languages
[1:27:04] and brings them together and because the
[1:27:05] holy spirit is present they all hear it
[1:27:09] in their personal language it's the same
[1:27:12] word multiple languages but that effect
[1:27:15] right there caused them all to realize
[1:27:17] whoa this is something special because
[1:27:20] it applies to every person here somehow
[1:27:23] we all hear them in our own
[1:27:26] language verse 9 it says parthians and
[1:27:29] mes and elamites and the Dwellers in
[1:27:32] Mesopotamia and in Judea in caposa in
[1:27:35] pontis and Asia friia and pamilia and
[1:27:39] Egypt and in the parts of Libya about
[1:27:41] sirene and strangers of Rome Jews and
[1:27:43] prelit Crees and Arabians we do hear
[1:27:46] them speak in our tongues the wonderful
[1:27:48] works of
[1:27:50] God and they were all amazed please put
[1:27:52] the second picture up and they were all
[1:27:54] amazed and we in doubt saying one to
[1:27:56] another what mean is
[1:27:58] this it's
[1:28:00] Mana what is this it's something new
[1:28:03] it's never happened before and this is
[1:28:06] what the diagram looks like of everybody
[1:28:08] coming right back around from the same
[1:28:10] places that Babel dispersed them to and
[1:28:14] said you know what the holy spirit's
[1:28:17] here and now that the holy spirit's here
[1:28:19] let's all join up in one language the
[1:28:21] language of God the language of the word
[1:28:25] the same it's the same map people like
[1:28:29] it's not an
[1:28:31] accident God knows how to do Stu he said
[1:28:35] there is something special about this
[1:28:37] that everybody in the world needs to
[1:28:39] know and I don't care what your
[1:28:41] background is it's for you I don't care
[1:28:45] what somebody said about you what I said
[1:28:48] here is for you and it's going to change
[1:28:50] you this is the only thing that's going
[1:28:52] to change you going on to the rap
[1:28:58] amen and then from this point in the
[1:29:01] Bible some things start to change so uh
[1:29:04] you know the Old Testament is where I've
[1:29:05] read most of this stuff and then the New
[1:29:07] Testament the words that are used
[1:29:09] actually if you look at the the the
[1:29:11] frequency with which uh different words
[1:29:13] are used in the Bible in the King James
[1:29:15] version you start to notice a pattern
[1:29:17] right um I'm guessing no one else did
[1:29:19] that here but uh I'm going to show you
[1:29:21] the pattern so
[1:29:25] um let's do picture number three the
[1:29:27] word sin in the Old Testament was used
[1:29:30] 299 times very top of the
[1:29:33] list Old Testament is longer than the
[1:29:36] New Testament but it's still used 299
[1:29:40] times and then in the New Testament it's
[1:29:43] only used 90 times why because the word
[1:29:46] came to the word and when the word came
[1:29:48] to the word the vocabulary that we
[1:29:50] needed to apply to Christians is changed
[1:29:53] the children of Israel sure they had
[1:29:54] plenty of sin over their lives and there
[1:29:57] wasn't anything the blood of pools and
[1:29:58] goats could do to completely do away
[1:30:00] with it but the New Testament comes and
[1:30:02] that blood comes actually word number
[1:30:05] three 280 time 282 times the word blood
[1:30:10] is used in the Old Testament the New
[1:30:12] Testament only
[1:30:14] 93 because they needed blood of bulls
[1:30:18] goats Lambs Turtle does I don't know how
[1:30:20] many different animals but then one
[1:30:22] blood comes and the answer for all that
[1:30:25] sin is gone the word sacrifice 182 times
[1:30:29] down to 23 in 23 I can guarantee you
[1:30:33] most of those is just talking about what
[1:30:34] they did in the
[1:30:35] past because there was only one
[1:30:37] sacrifice needed sir to cover everything
[1:30:41] people said about you to cover every
[1:30:43] word that you use to describe yourself
[1:30:44] it doesn't matter the blood can wash
[1:30:46] that all the way it can wash all your
[1:30:48] sin away all the things that you've done
[1:30:51] that's not your identity it's what God
[1:30:54] tells you you are the word Arc is the
[1:30:56] same way 193 times in the Old Testament
[1:30:58] and six you don't really six in the new
[1:31:01] you don't you don't need to use that
[1:31:03] word anymore but then the vocabulary
[1:31:05] changes and the words that start getting
[1:31:06] used a lot more often the word faith is
[1:31:09] only used twice in the Old
[1:31:13] Testament 39
[1:31:16] books way bigger than the New Testament
[1:31:18] the word faith is used twice and then
[1:31:20] 229 times in the New Testament
[1:31:24] like I don't know what the percentage
[1:31:26] increase there is but that's
[1:31:29] insane why cuz you need faith faith is
[1:31:33] for you that's a word you need to use so
[1:31:37] if there's a word if I have a list here
[1:31:39] go back up to the Top If I have this
[1:31:41] list here and there please yeah and
[1:31:44] these words in the Old Testament are
[1:31:46] used a lot more I honestly don't need
[1:31:49] them as much in the New Testament so I
[1:31:51] don't need to worry about that we don't
[1:31:52] need to worry about an arc right
[1:31:54] Noah said get in the ark there's no Arc
[1:31:56] for me to get into I'm not getting in an
[1:31:57] arc if somebody tried to tell me right
[1:31:59] now to get in an ark I'd say I don't I
[1:32:01] don't get it like why why would I do
[1:32:03] that that's not going to help me in my
[1:32:04] spiritual life if somebody told me to
[1:32:06] tote around an arc of the Covenant I
[1:32:08] don't need to do
[1:32:10] that because I'm a new testament
[1:32:12] Christian right if someone tries to tell
[1:32:15] me to sacrifice a whole bunch of stuff I
[1:32:17] don't need those things what I do need
[1:32:19] is
[1:32:21] Faith what I do need is Jesus
[1:32:24] 942 times in the New Testament zero in
[1:32:28] the Old Testament Christ
[1:32:30] 532 and zero in the Old Testament
[1:32:33] Eternal
[1:32:35] okay I'm Eternal Ed two times in the Old
[1:32:39] Testament they didn't know anything
[1:32:40] about that that's right but 45 times in
[1:32:43] the New Testament
[1:32:46] predestinated 200% increase you can't
[1:32:49] divide by zero but that's a 200%
[1:32:52] increase in my book I'll just call it
[1:32:54] that predestinated zero times in the Old
[1:32:57] Testament and two times in the new and
[1:32:59] when he was talking about me when he
[1:33:02] said somebody was predestinated he was
[1:33:04] saying Aaron was predestinated and I'm
[1:33:07] here to tell you what he said about
[1:33:09] me I'm here to tell you that he said I
[1:33:12] was eternal I'm associated with Christ I
[1:33:16] know Jesus and I have faith why because
[1:33:20] he said those things about me he said
[1:33:22] I'm a chosen generation
[1:33:24] he said I'm a royal priesthood he said
[1:33:26] I'm complet completely separated from
[1:33:29] all my sin and all my past nature all
[1:33:31] those things that you might use to
[1:33:33] describe my outward appearance that's
[1:33:35] not what God sees in
[1:33:38] me there's a lot of faith required to
[1:33:41] live the
[1:33:42] word I'm just going to be honest I have
[1:33:44] a bit of time
[1:33:46] left a little over 15 minutes and the
[1:33:49] devil is trying to kill my iPad
[1:33:52] but we're going to see how far I can
[1:33:55] preach I don't need the iPad to
[1:34:00] preach but it's words in the words so
[1:34:02] I'm trying to read these words out to
[1:34:03] you so it is what it is
[1:34:06] right the next word that I'm going to
[1:34:08] show
[1:34:10] you is the word
[1:34:13] redeem because in the Old Testament much
[1:34:17] as there was a way to cover their blood
[1:34:20] there was no way to redeem their nature
[1:34:22] back to the nature of Adam right and
[1:34:26] here this word comes and I'm not going
[1:34:29] to tell you it's the first time it was
[1:34:30] used in the scripture I don't know where
[1:34:32] the first time was to be honest but in
[1:34:33] Psalm uh 49 I want to bring out this
[1:34:36] word in this scripture Psalm chapter
[1:34:39] 49:5 it says wherefore should I fear in
[1:34:42] the days of evil when the iniquity of my
[1:34:44] heel shall Compass me about they that
[1:34:46] trust in their wealth and boast
[1:34:48] themselves in the multitude of their
[1:34:50] riches none of them can by any means his
[1:34:54] brother nor give God a ransom for him
[1:34:56] all these people who say things about
[1:34:58] you can't redeem you what they're saying
[1:35:01] can't redeem you what God says about you
[1:35:04] that redeems you amen and I accept what
[1:35:07] he says in Psalm 49 same chapter verse
[1:35:12] um uh 15 it says but God will redeem my
[1:35:16] soul from the power of the Grave for he
[1:35:18] shall receive me even if no one else
[1:35:21] does for he shall receive me sayah
[1:35:24] in hose chapter 13 ver14 it says I will
[1:35:27] Ransom this is God speaking to to uh
[1:35:31] about his children he says I will Ransom
[1:35:33] them from the power of the Grave I will
[1:35:36] redeem them from death oh death I will
[1:35:38] be thy plagues oh grave I will be thy
[1:35:41] destruction repentance shall be hid from
[1:35:43] mine eyes so death speaking over you
[1:35:47] trying to follow you through life and
[1:35:48] say I'm going to get you Jesus took care
[1:35:51] of death amen the Redemption is
[1:35:54] complete God is saying you're welcome
[1:35:57] you are redeemed this word is for you
[1:36:00] start to speak that I am
[1:36:02] redeemed you know

[1:37:30] and you never knew but he meets this
[1:37:32] Batman and they're not friends they
[1:37:34] fight each other or something like that
[1:37:35] they just come up with some new story
[1:37:36] and they're trying to make it I'm just
[1:37:38] here to tell you right God did the
[1:37:40] Multiverse first in the
[1:37:43] scripture y'all y'all don't look like
[1:37:45] you believe
[1:37:47] me then tell me who Jesus was praying to
[1:37:50] when he was in the garden he's here who
[1:37:53] who is he praying
[1:37:55] to when Jesus has the Holy Spirit and
[1:37:58] receives it in the form of a dove when
[1:37:59] he gets baptized who's the Holy Spirit
[1:38:02] and who's Jesus it's the same
[1:38:05] person yes different forms but they're
[1:38:10] not visible in the same exact spot right
[1:38:14] same person
[1:38:16] right you guys are multiversal creatures
[1:38:20] adults I'm going to catch up with you
[1:38:21] God give me a minute just give me a
[1:38:22] minute you guys
[1:38:24] are multiversal creatures why because
[1:38:26] God said that you have a
[1:38:29] theophany and you might be walking on
[1:38:31] this Earth and your theophany is up
[1:38:34] there and if you got to think people try
[1:38:36] to tell you things about yourself like
[1:38:38] you're sick you're not going to amount
[1:38:40] to much you your your body is weak
[1:38:43] you're falling apart you're imperfect
[1:38:45] you're not quite there from what I think
[1:38:47] a message believer should look like so
[1:38:49] therefore you're all messed up I can't
[1:38:51] take you at all think about that God
[1:38:54] he's not looking at you he's looking at
[1:38:56] your
[1:39:06] theophonic he's not sick that theophany
[1:39:09] she's not sick that theophany she she's
[1:39:12] perfect God loves her God loves him
[1:39:16] that's what God sees me as right now and
[1:39:19] you can accept that by faith and walk
[1:39:21] into it in you're traveling the
[1:39:23] Multiverse and then you accept your
[1:39:25] healing for yourself if my theophan is
[1:39:27] not sick then I'm not sick if my
[1:39:30] theophan is not broken and battered and
[1:39:32] bruised then I'm not broken battered and
[1:39:34] bruised if my theophany is not perfect
[1:39:38] well if my theophany is perfect that
[1:39:40] means I'm perfect whatever attribute it
[1:39:42] has is for me amen right all right
[1:39:45] everybody else I'm catching up um let's
[1:39:48] go back to these words now back to
[1:39:51] everybody the word predestinated
[1:39:54] like I said it only appeared uh twice in
[1:39:56] the scripture in the New Testament in
[1:39:58] Ephesians 5 uh 1: 15 rather says having
[1:40:02] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:40:03] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:40:05] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:40:07] will also in verse 11 it says in whom we
[1:40:10] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:40:11] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:40:13] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:40:15] counsel of his own will that's what God
[1:40:17] says about
[1:40:19] us and who is this melkisedek 1965
[1:40:24] verse 1116 brother brandom says God
[1:40:27] vindicates that that's always been right
[1:40:29] God vindicates it to be true show
[1:40:31] plainly the
[1:40:33] predestinated is the only one that's
[1:40:35] considered in
[1:40:38] Redemption so if you can accept
[1:40:40] predestination for yourself if sorry if
[1:40:43] you can accept Redemption for yourself
[1:40:45] then you can accept predestination for
[1:40:48] yourself it says the predestinated is
[1:40:51] the only one that's considered in
[1:40:53] Redemption did you get it let me say
[1:40:55] that again the predestinate is the only
[1:40:56] one that's considered in Redemption
[1:40:58] people might be taking making like think
[1:41:00] they are but the real Redemption is
[1:41:02] those that are predestinated because the
[1:41:05] very word redeem means to bring back is
[1:41:07] that right the redeem is something to
[1:41:10] redeem anything is bring it back to the
[1:41:13] original Place Hallelujah so it's only
[1:41:15] the predestinated will be brought back
[1:41:17] because the others didn't come from
[1:41:19] there that's so he's defining both words
[1:41:22] right there and there
[1:41:23] interchangeable at this point
[1:41:29] right now I'm going to segue into this
[1:41:32] and it says there's a section here I I
[1:41:35] want to go into watching what you say
[1:41:37] right and that's what I've been talking
[1:41:38] about this whole time because what you
[1:41:41] say determines what you become what you
[1:41:44] say determines your purpose that's what
[1:41:46] I've been driving home this whole
[1:41:49] time in Hebrews chapter 2 but brandom
[1:41:51] says
[1:41:53] um in verse four he says if you can't
[1:41:55] decide don't say nothing just leave it
[1:41:58] alone wait you know what I'm gonna back
[1:42:00] it up the beginning of the verse it says
[1:42:02] if you witness to anything you're just
[1:42:03] as guilty as being a partaker of it so
[1:42:06] if we witness say oh yes they ought to
[1:42:08] have done this and so and so be careful
[1:42:10] what you say because you're guilty the
[1:42:12] way your judgment goes if you can't
[1:42:14] decide don't say nothing just leave it
[1:42:16] alone and when you testify you are a
[1:42:19] Christian then you're guilty see you're
[1:42:21] guilty of being a Christian that you
[1:42:22] must live to that and when God makes a
[1:42:25] promise in the Bible I see a man here in
[1:42:27] a wheelchair when God makes a promise he
[1:42:30] is guilty of that promise until he
[1:42:32] brings it to pass so God is guilty when
[1:42:34] he makes a promise and the scriptures
[1:42:36] are guilty until they're fulfilled so
[1:42:38] you're guilty with what you say as an
[1:42:40] amateure Creator you're guilty with what
[1:42:42] you say until it becomes
[1:42:44] fulfilled take the word in faith
[1:42:47] recognize that your words have
[1:42:49] consequences don't have a negative
[1:42:51] testimony Saints amen
[1:42:55] in Isaiah
[1:42:57] 55 uh verse 10 it says for as the rain
[1:43:00] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[1:43:02] returneth not thither but WTH the Earth
[1:43:04] and maketh it bring forth in Bud that it
[1:43:07] may give seed to the swer and bread to
[1:43:09] the eater so shall my word be that goeth
[1:43:12] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:43:14] return to me void but it shall be accom
[1:43:17] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:43:19] shall prosper on the thing wherein to I
[1:43:21] sent it we got to get that mindset
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:26] amen and I realize this isn't me trying
[1:43:29] to say you walk out of here and name it
[1:43:31] and claim it but your faith produces a
[1:43:36] testimony and your testimony changes
[1:43:40] your situation
[1:43:42] now
[1:43:44] um God has to honor your faith because
[1:43:47] he said he would if you go to um
[1:43:50] actually I'm gonna prove that to you
[1:43:51] right here if you go to Matthew
[1:43:53] um 21:20 it says when this is right
[1:43:57] after Jesus saw the the Fig Tree and he
[1:43:59] cursed it what does he tell them the
[1:44:02] disciples Marvel and in verse 21 he says
[1:44:05] Jesus answered and said unto them verily
[1:44:07] I say unto you if you have faith and
[1:44:09] doubt not ye shall not only do this
[1:44:11] which was done to the Fig Tree but also
[1:44:14] if ye shall say unto this mountain be
[1:44:16] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[1:44:18] sea it shall be done can you realize
[1:44:21] he's not saying if I tell you if if I
[1:44:25] say he's saying if you say why why
[1:44:28] because you know God on this Earth only
[1:44:31] has your hands to work through he has
[1:44:34] your lips to work through at the moment
[1:44:36] and if he's working through you then
[1:44:38] he's realizing he's giving you that
[1:44:40] power on your lips through the word of
[1:44:42] God if you have faith on it then you
[1:44:45] have unlimited power and with that
[1:44:47] unlimited power you can do these things
[1:44:50] that he says you can do why am creators
[1:44:54] that's what we
[1:44:55] are if you go back to Genesis I'm going
[1:44:57] to do it again Genesis one more time
[1:45:00] verse uh chapter 2: 19 it says and out
[1:45:02] of the ground the Lord God formed every
[1:45:04] beast of the field and every fowl of the
[1:45:06] air and brought them unto Adam to see
[1:45:08] what he would call
[1:45:10] them did y'all catch that he didn't
[1:45:14] bring them to Adam and tell him what to
[1:45:16] call them he said to see what he would
[1:45:18] call them why because Adam was the one
[1:45:21] who was supposed to name these things
[1:45:23] because Adam was in the will of God and
[1:45:25] he had the mind of God and the mind of
[1:45:27] God revealed it to his heart what God
[1:45:29] would want him to say and then he's
[1:45:32] speaking that the verse next verse says
[1:45:35] and Adam gave names to all Catt to the F
[1:45:38] of the air Adam gave them names God
[1:45:40] didn't name them so Adam was using words
[1:45:44] in the Garden of
[1:45:46] Eden that God revealed to his heart to
[1:45:49] say so whenever he started saying stuff
[1:45:52] like naked he knew something was wrong
[1:45:54] and that's where he
[1:45:56] fell you got to watch what you say
[1:46:00] Saints in hearing recognizing and acting
[1:46:03] on the word of
[1:46:05] God
[1:46:08] actually yes uh no no no let me let me
[1:46:12] leave that quote alone I'm going to do
[1:46:14] God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:46:16] musicians can return please um
[1:46:20] 1963 if we'd all stand actually while I
[1:46:23] read this because this is a declaration
[1:46:26] um we can make over
[1:46:29] ourselves God hiding himself in
[1:46:32] Simplicity it says he he's praying at
[1:46:35] the end of this uh tape and he says Lord
[1:46:36] Jesus in the way of humility in the way
[1:46:39] of humbleness I offer you this
[1:46:41] congregation that's on their feet I
[1:46:44] offer them to you because they have
[1:46:45] stood in response to the call they're
[1:46:47] seeking deeper things they're seeking
[1:46:49] more life after hearing that the blood
[1:46:52] of Jesus so thoroughly cleanses that
[1:46:54] there's no more nothing that the
[1:46:55] complete word of God rests within them
[1:46:57] that the very command of their own voice
[1:47:00] is creative power because in them is the
[1:47:03] Holy Ghost and this Holy Ghost is a
[1:47:05] Creator he makes things come to pass
[1:47:08] because he speaks the word and the word
[1:47:11] spoken becomes God In
[1:47:19] Action the word spoken right
[1:47:23] not not random words
[1:47:26] that you came up with over yourself and
[1:47:29] I realized there I'm I'm battling
[1:47:30] Spirits here um there are depressive
[1:47:33] spirits that make you think you're
[1:47:35] nothing right there
[1:47:37] are you know the devil does the same
[1:47:40] thing he he's just constantly going to
[1:47:41] try to give you words to say you can
[1:47:43] play whatever you like he's going to say
[1:47:45] give you words to say you see that
[1:47:47] happening like you go out in the world
[1:47:50] you see people out there it's like oh I
[1:47:52] you know a full grown man with you know
[1:47:55] supposed to
[1:47:56] be in good mind and sound mind and
[1:47:59] everything he says I'm a woman why cuz
[1:48:02] the word g the devil gave him some words
[1:48:05] to speak and he starts trying to apply
[1:48:07] that to himself and when he does that
[1:48:09] what happens he starts changing the
[1:48:11] words that apply to himself it's like my
[1:48:14] pronouns are she her changing words that
[1:48:18] are applied to himself because they're
[1:48:20] trying to pervert and make people around
[1:48:22] them try to prophesy over their life and
[1:48:24] say bad things that aren't true that's
[1:48:27] not what they are that's not a man
[1:48:28] that's not a
[1:48:30] woman you might be battling with a
[1:48:32] spirit yourself and be like oh well I
[1:48:35] just I don't know I'm just anxious I
[1:48:37] have anxiety I can't I can't get rid of
[1:48:38] it I can't kick it stop professing that
[1:48:41] over yourself that's what somebody told
[1:48:43] you about
[1:48:44] yourself and then these words become
[1:48:46] popular you know they become Trends it's
[1:48:49] like oh I have OCD then suddenly
[1:48:51] everybody on Instagram has OCD you know
[1:48:54] and it's just like y all don't all have
[1:48:56] OCD stop saying that a lot of them don't
[1:48:59] even know what OCD stands for It's like
[1:49:02] because they don't know what they stand
[1:49:03] for we should stand for this
[1:49:06] right God didn't say I
[1:49:11] CD and yes you might recognize some
[1:49:13] symptoms attacking you but that's just
[1:49:15] something the devil's trying to tell you
[1:49:17] you might recognize that you're broken
[1:49:19] and you know what that's okay to be
[1:49:23] broken
[1:49:25] but God's A Healer and if I can accept
[1:49:28] that he has healed me and is going to
[1:49:31] heal me and he's this isn't my permanent
[1:49:33] State that's that's not my testimony I'm
[1:49:36] not going to say it out loud maybe it's
[1:49:39] true as far as you can
[1:49:41] see but it's not true as far as what he
[1:49:44] can
[1:49:45] see and I can recognize
[1:49:48] that let's bow our heads and recognize
[1:49:51] God
[1:49:54] he's not trying to leave us where we are
[1:49:57] like if this word came like on the day
[1:50:00] of Pentecost and it came to so many
[1:50:01] people throughout the world and you go
[1:50:04] to church and you see these Christians
[1:50:05] around you and they look like they're
[1:50:07] living great lives they're Victorious
[1:50:09] all the time looking good healthy happy
[1:50:12] faithful realize that if God sent a word
[1:50:16] to me in this day in this age and I can
[1:50:19] see a strong Christian right there
[1:50:21] that's for me too there's no reason why
[1:50:24] he would send a word for them that
[1:50:26] doesn't apply to me that's for me too I
[1:50:29] accept it for me if God sent the word
[1:50:31] for this age then it applies to
[1:50:33] everybody in this age it doesn't matter
[1:50:34] your Creed tribe color it doesn't matter
[1:50:37] your history it doesn't matter how
[1:50:38] broken you are in fact the more broken
[1:50:41] the better it just shows his will and
[1:50:42] his power more greatly
[1:50:45] amen Heavenly Father we thank you for uh

[1:51:15] can't be done away with it's you who
[1:51:18] will do the work we just need to have
[1:51:21] faith and testify of what you've done in
[1:51:23] our
[1:51:24] lives there are blind people who were
[1:51:27] blind but as long as they
[1:51:29] testified that you had healed them Lord
[1:51:32] you took away their blindness maybe the
[1:51:35] rest of the world didn't understand the
[1:51:36] sequence of events they they might say
[1:51:38] oh he's a liar he said he was he said
[1:51:40] he's been healed or she's that sister
