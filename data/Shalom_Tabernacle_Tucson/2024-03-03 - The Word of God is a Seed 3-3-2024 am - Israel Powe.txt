========================================

for Sunday School uh portion of the service ask you to stand and turn in into Revelations chapter 6 we're in the third seal this is our second or third reading of it or hearing of it and um we'll read re Revelations chapter 6 and verse number five amen before we read let us pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again we thank you Lord that you've given us your word the manner that we can feed on feed our souls I pray you'll feed our souls today every heart that's gathered here Lord bless this Sunday school bless the other classes Lord that are going on right now we just commit each one into your hands we pray in Jesus name amen and when he had opened in uh the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I beheld in a low black a black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine amen we're going to be listening to paragraph 72 through 133 this morning it's about 20 minutes amen so let's sing only believe only believe only believe that all things are possible only believe oh only believe only believe all things are possible only we live God bless you you may be seated brother brandom and if you don't remember like that there's something wrong with your faith see you're not sure you're saved yet then you're just guessing it do that all right we ain't going to get into this SE AR all right I want each night I don't know where you mind me taking up your time we could get out a little bit earlier there's not two in the revealing of these of these seals remember it's only really one verse the first tells the announcing of it the second verse most all commentaries and so forth the reading of it or or reading of their thoughts and I have and I've always believed like nearly all of them does that that first horse rider was the was the early church but when the Holy Spirit revealed it it was absolutely contrary to that and so then all it does just show what it is and then I try now to me this is very sacred that's the reason I'd rather answer these questions and let's get it everybody knowing straight and on tapes too that they'll understand now see I Tred to speak a while at night on backgrounding to get the people rushing in and pushing in and you shouldn't do that but when it does it's human beings and it's hot and in here and you and you restless but you've been very very nice the best I've ever seen the people act in the Tabernacle has been this this me and setting quiet and mothers take their babies to the nursery when they start crying and everything has been very nice but I try to backgrounded until I just feel the anointing of the spirit on me to say these words to say what has been revealed to me and then if I'm have somewhere doing that if I have made a mistake here surely here before all the people he'll corrected for me I I want it it's I want it right there no need of taking this what you imagine there's something right and and we want that we want God to give us what's right so now we talk this these Riders as they come up the first horse now uh and we realize that that was the the Antichrist that went forth and then we find out last night that the same fell that went forth as Antichrist is a white horse we found him with a sword last night rid and and killing people now now it's always the natural and the spiritual and for the church sake I want to type just before we get to the opening of this seal which what he give me I got it rot down here I got several scriptures here seven or eight pages of it and as I refer to it uh notice I want to give a type of the church and make it so plain that you'll be bound to see it see now there was a natural bride in in the Garden of Eden remember last night that natural bride she was Adam's sweetheart not yet his wife because he hadn't knew her yet as a wife just like Mary was Joseph wife but he never knew her yet she was found as a child see now before Adam knew his wife she was just a bride to him all right and we find out that um God she she fell in the Garden of Eden because she failed to hold to God's word now he knew that Satan would be loose among them so he gave them uh a place to stay behind fortify them well who could know any better place to be fortified than God if he's trying to take care of his own children if I want to take care of my little Jo jph a brother everything and I know his life depended on it why and I was able to do it well if 40ft concrete reinforced would would be the thing would do it that's I make it 90 foot to be sure that and if I can think that about my little boy which if his mortal life had lost I believe a child would be saved how much more to God to his child that would be eternally lost what should he Place him behind he Place him behind his own word as long as you're in that word you're safe if you abide me and my words in you then just ask what you will that's it the word thank so Eve got the strolling in the garden and she run into the serpent a very polished up sort of a fell and see and he began now he was on the other side God Lives dwells Works in humility never any other way now a little humble lady walking along there and Satan come up as a wise slick polished sort of a fellow and he wanted to seller the program as long as no matter how much Satan was around as long as she stayed behind this word she was all right so let Satan do whatever he wants to you just stay at the word don't make a bit of difference if he says while you're sick by stri some heal well you going to die you're rais me up again prise they just stay behind the word that's all Christ retreated to the word himself it's written now stay behind the word but Eve she began to kind of let down but she never let it all down she only let one little phrase down and that's what SAT want her to do he got her from behind God's Promise by reasoning don't never try to reason God's word just believe it so she stepped out from there and before Adam ever got to her for a wife she was already defiled by Satan amen and she and did you notice Christ did the same thing exactly now far redeeming God had to be there first and did you notice Mary before she would come to Joseph the Holy Spirit done got there that's where the Redeemer come now now notice the Natural Woman fell and God made a way for her to be redeemed although she had fallen he made a way now that was the first Bride on Earth fell before her husband and her were married she fell by by the reason of of reasoning instead of staying with the word she fell amen and she fell to death amen amen Eternal separation with her she took her husband and everything else she was on the earth amen she fell now but God full of Mercy made a way to redeem that woman and now he promised her telling her that sometime in the future the true word would come to her again the true word will be made known to her I remember that because he promised Christ through the woman and Christ is the word amen one in the beginning was the word the word is with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh see and dwelt with us God dwelt With Us in flesh he was the word before word it's a thought and a thought has to be created all right so God's thoughts become creation when it was spoke by a word that's when he present it to to you as a thought is thought and it's revealed to you then it's still a thought until you speak it that's the reason Moses went out to pray a pillar of fire around him and he said go um hold your stick towards the east and say call for flies there's no flies but he went and help the stick there and said let there be flies no flies at all yeah went on back but the words God's thought has already been spoken it's a word now it's got to happen now don't you see what Jesus said if you say to this Mountain not if I say it but you say to this mountain be moved and the first thing I guess in Moses time big old green fly get the buzz and after while it was 5 PBS per yard where' he come from God created him don't you see how God can destroy this world tonight with knats if he wants to well he can pile NS Plum to the Moon all thing do just say Let There Be kns to the Moon that'd be all there would be to it no chemicals nothing they just keep on growing growing growing on see he can do what he wants to he's God the Creator only do just speak it that's right he's the Creator now if we just get to realiz and how great he is he just does what he wishes to he sits up there and looks the people and these little Educators smarten out and there's old God and everything it just like it was at Babel again Babel rather now we notice that God told eveen that after so long a Time the words coming back to you now how did she fall I my class to say what did she fall from what did E fall from the word is that right the word right and God said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right after so long a Time the word would be known to her all right the word would come for one purpose now hold tight now what I'm saying the the word would come to her for one purpose that was for Redemption all right but until until then she had a substitute that would uh that would work until the time arrived for the original word how you understand clearly see he told her the word would come to her again but until that time he give her a substitute on until that time arrived so he gave her a offering to make a substitute for that blood now the blood was of bulls and sheep goats and things but it didn't take away her sin see it only covered her sin it didn't take it away at all it covered it for it was an animal's blood and in the animal's blood is animal life it was a substitute until the real I get your quotes on the real human blood as human beings would be become incarnate god without sex virgin the Virgin ver produce that now God's word promise became blood and was incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ the Savior the blood of bulls and goats and so forth but now wait here God made the promise saying it would be there when it come her seed should bruise the Serpent's head now if if her seed come just like from Adam or like had been from The Serpent and so forth then still be sinful seed that's the reason John wept there no man because no man everybody's cross the other side of the ditch the chasm but there's coming a time that when this substitute blood of animal would be done away with when the real incarnate blood came God made Flesh and Blood the Bible said he was 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of God is for God was manifested in flesh that's right uh virgin birth did this now the blood of sheep and goats covered sin but didn't get rid of it for it was an animals blood but it was to be all right was to be a substitute and they sure got uh got used to that subtitute and so they just kept on and when the real promised word was made manifest in Jesus Christ who proved to be the son of the great Creator God and was Vindicated himself by being the Living Word of God he proved he was he could speak things into existence there ain't a human being or or nothing the world can do ain't a thing on earth can create but God the devil can't create he's a perverter of what's been created but he can't create amen sin is only righteousness perverted you know what I mean what is a lie it's a truth misrepresented see what is an adultery the right legal act uh perverted everything in sin sin is just the truth perverted now he could not create but when Christ came proved he was the creator amen there was the blood that was been promised now if you want to read that you let's just turn for a minute we go take a time on this any tonight it makes me nervous I think everybody wants to go home you know now let's get acts two thank you and we'll just acts two and we'll find find out whether this is right or not whether he was proved that he was godu get Acts 2 now let's get here at the 22nd verse Peter speak in the day of Pentecost ye man of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles wonders and sign which God did by him in the midst of you as you your ALS you yourselves also know a man that was a proved that it was God among you by the very things he done proed that he was here's Peter stand at the Sanhedrin telling him Nicodemus know the same he said Rabbi we all know that you are a teacher comes from God because no man could do these things say he come from God they know it but why what now ev's promises but when that Bride come on down and refused when the real word came to her so the woman refused to recognize the Hebrew Bride for she was the Bride of of God he put her away in divorcement is that right she was a bride of God you say well he wasn't never married yet that's right but Joseph put Mary away before it was going to put Mary way before this Mary see he was engaged to her and when he come and the word that he Pro promised come for the wedding he found her wrapped in her substitutes so bad that she wouldn't take the real promise that had been made the word Christ maybe you don't get it let me go over again I want you to get that thing she was promised the bride Eve to be a redeemer the Redeemer would be the word and when the word came made flesh she rejected it she was given substitutes a hold that substitute given substitutes to go on until the Redeemer come and when the Redeemer comes she want to continue with her substitute and rejected the true word that was the Hebrew bride so did he by the second Eve bride a mother of all Spiritual Living see Eve means the mother of all as spirit all its living Eve mother of all its living now and when he came to the Hebrew bride she was the mother of all that was living but she rejected it naturel Eve fell in Eden by listening to Satan's reasoning against God's word that's how she fell all right sir she fell because she did that spiritual Eve now that's the church Christ bride she fell not in Eden but in Rome am see at the Nia Council when she rejected that Pentecostal church that went down to Nia and listening to Romans reasoning instead of holding on to the word she fell and everything away from her died with her around her now just as natural Eve fell spiritual Eve fell God's bride fa fell in the garden Christ bride fell in Rome see notice by the same reasoning against God's word she also forfeited her writes a virtue to Satan which we found in the breaking of these seals that that was Satan and still is Satan there the Bible said it's the very seed of Satan amen and as e forfeited her her virtuous rights and give them over to Satan in the Garden of Eden the church the bride of Christ did the same thing at Rome when they forfeited the Bible for their dogmas and reasoning see how types you just run those types your B to come out right if my hand looks like if I've never seen myself and I see my shadow coming I'll know just about what I look like see but that's what if you want to see what's coming look what has been for the all the old things were Shadows of things to come the Bible said all right for she forfeit her virtuous word the word of God when she sold the Bible and put a man in there that says that the church has rights to change anything they want to change and they've done it and the bride of Christ the Pentecostal bride sold out her virtue at Nia just as Eve sold her virtue to Satan in the Garden of Eden exactly all right [Music] I [Music] [Music] is [Music] I [Music] oh [Music] whether be an

among my neighbors and a fear to my acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me for I have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me me they devis to take away my life in the Lord said th God my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from them that persecute me face to shine upon mer seek let me not be ashamed oh lord for I have called upon on thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave oh how great is thy goodness which thou has laid up for them that fear thee which thou has

the Lord all ye his Saints for the Lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the Lord amen thank God for the reading of his word what a blessing we' like to take our scripture reading in Matthew chapter 13 and the scripture I like to read here we condense it down a little bit here we'll take verses number three pardon me just a moment M oh my let's see this in verse three Matthew chap 13:3 and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a swer went forth to sow when he swed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon stonely places where they had not much Earth and forth with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns sprang up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100-fold some 60-fold some 30 fold who hath ears to hear Let Him hear and we like to take um verses number 18 to 23 as well so Jesus is explaining the parable he says Hear the parable of the swer when anyone heareth the word of God of the kingdom understande it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which receive by the wayside receive seed by the wayside but he that receiveth the seed and Stony places the same is he the same is he that heareth the word and Anon with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself but doth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by He Is offended he also that receives seed among the Thorns is he that Hearth the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringing forth some 100-fold some 60 some 30 amen and so we thank God for the reading of his word we just want to speak on to see the word of God is a seed the word of God is a seed very simple text we've been speaking on you know we win by our conversation the spoken words The Original Seed and a positive confession we want to continue in that in this title this morning seed the seed is the word of God let's pray father we ask your blessings upon this word we pray bless every heart we ask in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated now we thank God for his word the reading of his word and as we move into this um particular subject again we've been dealing with these principles of planting a seed these are principles that are laws of God there's laws in atmosphere there's laws on how we deal with electricity there's laws laws in gravity there's laws in the speed of light of sound even your body is made up of laws and the doctors when they go to examine you they're looking at the different systems in your body your blood pressure with your heart your bone structure how are things going in your body that's based on laws of what regular should be and then there's abnormalities and when things are abnormal they have to make an adjustment and they have to give you an evaluation of what's going on and he's doing that not by some uh something out of the air but he's studied and he has principles and there's instructions that he follows and that's how he handles you he has to handle you based on what you can tell him I've been eating a balanced diet I've been exercising like you said doc I've been taking all my vitamins that's all okay that's all good but we still need to examine you and when he examines you the examination will tell him how you've been doing in your diet the examination of your blood and your heart rake and all of that will be taking place because he's not looking at just your words or your testimony there's principles that he's following and the word of God is based upon these principles Satan himself knows these principles and he used this principle uh against Eve in the Garden against the human race he knew that every seed must bring forth of his kind if you put a seed in the right atmosphere you allow it to grow it will produce whether you pray about it or not whether you was wanting to get get it back or try to change it or not it will produce after its kind and Satan knew this so he planted his seed as unbelieving seed into the human race through Eve and this law and these principles he held true and god holds these true as well we've been sharing with you all here at the church that you know our words mean more to us than perhaps we realize and then when we look at this Parable here there is four places that the seed has been planted it's by the wayside a Stony places Thorns amongst thorns and then it was also planted in good ground remember this there was nothing wrong with the seed the seed was the original seed it was a proper seed but where it was planted and placed made a big difference and I want you to notice also that a good seed even planted in good ground It produced some 30 some 60 some 100 fold now in in farming and in planting we all want the greatest yield that we can can get when we plant a seed and the Bible I shared this with you before the Bible says that Isaac in Genesis 26 he planted in one year and he received a h hundredfold of his planting because the Lord blessed him and this was during a time of a famine and so the blessing comes from the Lord he opens up the seed he gerti it he allows it to grow but we have a part to play and that and that first part is the knowing that that the word of God is a seed and so what we do as Believers as we approach the Lord and and this is how we should approach everything is that we judge ourself and our faith and others by how they stand on the word we don't judge them based on you know maybe they might be a little loud or a little too quiet or they're a little this way or that way a little indifferent but how do they handle the word a how does that man really handle the word because if he's handling the word with respect in the right way God will place him where he needs to be but if he's already disrespectful with the word you know there there's he loses his position right there so sometimes we see a child they'll come they'll accept the word of God we see them come to the altar they'll accept the promise of God and they're still doing things that's not quite convenient maybe they hav matured yet but look at look at their attitude towards the word and that's what we Foster that's what we Fellowship around give it a chance to grow it'll mature don't don't don't cut people out so quickly especially if they re if they receive the word if they receive the word in their life let God continue to bless them and don't try to come down so hard on them because they have to take root first and they has to settle into their heart and their mind first and so sometimes we do that with young Christians we do that with young churches young pastors young Ministries we get a young Minister up and some people won't even hear a young Minister preach because they're too revelated or too anointed but you know what you know the young men's got to start somewhere and and if he's handling the word properly then you want to Foster that because he'll grow and he'll mature with the word how many believe that well just put it this way you started somewhere and you started and you stumbled and you made mistakes don't we all is there Grace for everybody that's making a mistake amen absolutely so we have to remember that and so we know that the seed is the word of God and God's word is this seed and we become the Planters of this word by the way we speak the way we speak and the way we handle the word it is um it is very it's very very important to God I want you to look at this Matthew Chapter 13 just just for a moment that the the seed had to contend with two uh different obstacles in order for it to grow and to thrive and the first obstacle as we know very well it was the atmosphere that it was planted in and so although we have the right seed it's a gerti seed where it is planted is going to determine how well it does the kind of ground is it in a positive atmosphere the kind of the nurture that is getting that's all very very important you could take the word and you could just plant it anywhere but it still needs to be right in the right atmosphere and the next enemy that it would have is the wicked one so we have these two forces that are working against a seed now we know the seed or the word of God will not return void amen it would always accomplish what it was sent to do but there's places that it thrives better than other places and we'll see that even with the message it goes better it does better in different cities and than other cities and what's the reason for that I don't know exactly why you think that you know our church our city here has 14 15 maybe 16 churches and there's some states that only have maybe one and it's barely struggling what happened there well God God knows God God is in control of that but the seed will not return void and so the the Wayside is where the seed falls into a heart and they don't understand the word of God and so they don't even ask God for Revelation to open up the word to them many of them they don't even pray for Revelation many come and they hear the word of Truth and they don't let it settle down into their heart and so what happens is they don't understand it and when they leave the wicked one is there to take the word that was even sown in their heart and the second place is Stony places this is where the seed was planted but it had no root there to grow thereby didn't go deep enough to find a place to grow and then amongst the Thorns this was a seed that was planted and then the cares of the world be to choke out the seed that it would not produce and wouldn't grow and then finally it was planted in good ground and the good ground was he that understood what he heard the good ground was he that beared fruit from what he heard the good ground was he that br bringeth forth fruits it's interesting how many times we'll be in a good service and the word of be God will be preached and we know we had a good times we felt the anointing and you get out and you ask the people what did the brother preach on what was the subject where did he get his scripture from it's amazing how we lose that and we don't Foster that like we should and so why is that that happens because the enemy is involved in how this seed is planted and and as the seed is being planted it's your job to keep that seed in the right atmosphere it's your job to make sure that you've got a good understanding of what's being said or at least the portion that God is revealing to you that it' be understood now brother vandom gives an example of how many remember he was talking about those two women one that had a she had a a some a stomach ailment and the other one had a growth in her neck and he said that in the meeting that night the angel of the Lord he said it in different places came down and spoke to them and gave them the Word of Deliverance and then they went home into their neighborhood and one morning a cool feeling came up over the mom one of them that was eating and you know she just felt like she should take that promise and she claimed the promise even though she knew she was sick she knew it wasn't do do good but she ate a little bit and God blessed her she ate a little bit more and blessed her and she realized she was healed and then she wanted to go tell her friend down the street so she ran down the street and her friend was praising the Lord she was in a a an atmosphere of Praise because that tumor that she had upon her was now gone she was looking through the sheets and saying where the tumor words and they came back and gave brother bam this testimony this is what brother banam says now these principles are true either they're true or not he said that the angel of the Lord went through the neighborhood to hunt them down to see if they were still believing Lord now these principles uh we can't I can't identify them how they happen here in real time today but a prophet gives us enough to know that this how it works remember Grace Weber we shared her testimony last week how she was testifying of the good things he said that the angel of the Lord heard her testifying amen he says go tell her she'll not die tell her that I hurt her and that I'm going to heal her so here the angel of the Lord follow Miss Weber to her job a hostile environment but now you got a she's got the seed of promise and she stood up for what was right and the angel of the Lord heard her and here the angel of the Lord found these women knew their neighborhood just like God knows your neighborhood and he uh heard their words and now he's bringing to pass what the promise was now I'll read a few from there and brother brandom says this in the message the second Miracle paragraph number six he says and she found her neighbor down in the floor screaming to the top of her voice the growth had just left her neck a few minutes before that you know what it was it was the angel of the Lord passing through that neighborhood of those things that he had Pro pronounced if he pronounces it it's his obligation not mine or yours see it's your obligation to Keep On Believing it's my obligation to stay here and work for him it's your obligation to believe what he tells you and God will bring it to pass now that can't always answer spontaneously when Paul was out on the ocean that night 14 days and nights without moon or stars all hopes was gone is that right no hopes at all on those seamen oh men with Barnacles on them most they've been in the sea a long time all hopes is gone if they should ever live so he couldn't answer spontaneously with Paul he didn't answer spontaneously with these two women brother bam says it a little different here in the faith trip report he says this here in paragraph 171 said you're feeling better sir I thought so you're going to get over that nervousness and be all right now the blessings are still on you so don't worry if the blessings placed on you hold still sometimes it's days before he can get to you you Daniel Prayed one time and the angel didn't get to him for 21 days is that right I've seen the time where women and men would wait for weeks and the first thing you know all at once it happened the angel passing through the neighborhood he knows where it's at whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven whatsoever you loose on Earth I'll loose in heaven is that right that's his sovereignty prophet of God continues and how the angel came to me 1953 so down the street she went to tell her neighbor four or five doors below her when she got in to tell her neighbor she found her neighbor in there screaming at the top of her voice and the lump had just left her throat so they didn't know what it was what it was on the platform when the angel of the Lord had pronounced that he can't be to you just at every second but he had passed through the neighborhood confirming the word of God making it right sometimes you pray I believe Daniel the angel couldn't get to him one time when he was asking I believe 21 days wasn't it 21 days for can get there see now if you if you if you'd have lost faith they'd lost out but you do just exactly what God says do this is his word first the other is secondarily can you say praise the Lord so we do what God says first everything else is secondarily and so we know that when the word of the Lord is spoken to us and sometimes we look at this Parable and we when we place it as a Believer maybe their life there's a believer that comes in contact with the word and they're in it for a little bit and then they leave or they come in contact with the word and then the trials hit and then they leave and we place it like that but let's let's let's look at this in real time how this can take place this can take place even this morning and I believe it's happened many many Sunday mornings and Wednesday services and tape Services where the Holy Spirit has instilled some things into your heart and you know it's true and you guarantee and God has blessed you at a certain point in the service actually we should be looking for those points that God is speaking to us in the service we should be looking for our time that God that's for me that's my word I'm going to catch on to that and when you catch that word you hold on to it but how does that happen in real time you know um God will speak that word and then right after service right next afternoon the next Monday or Tuesday we've forgotten those promises that God gave to us yes and that's the wrong atmosphere to have that seed in that's the wrong time to disbelieve his word we have to hold on to his word once it has been spoken we keep it in the right atmosphere which is the atmosphere of faith and then we know that God is going to keep his word we see this take place um many times and what what we what God has done for us it is Our obligation to believe that and give a witness to that and to speak that out as though it is true for it is true it's God's word as I share with you in Psalms 27 says Lord deliver me from my enemies false Witnesses have risen up against me such as breathe out cruelty you just want to be careful that you're not the false witness that's breathing against yourself and sometimes we look at the enemies and somebody out there but sometimes it's your attitude and the the language that we speak about about ourselves is contrary to the word of God and when it's contrary to the word of God then you become your worst enemy you already got an enemy he's a real one he's the Devil he's the wicked one and he's there to catch away whatever God put into your heart he's there to take that away that's your enemy but then you have another enemy that's you and if you're not in the right place you'll begin to say things and to speak things that are contrary to the word and that's what we want to be careful of so this atmosphere we talk about we don't want the seed of the word in a hostile environment this is why Believers this is whole the perp one of the great purposes of coming to church we come in the atmosphere of Believers this is the P purpose of staying in good company and then your it develops who you are the people who you hang out with show me your company and I'll show you who you are because you feed on the people that you're with and if you're in a negative group a negative chat a negative session a a negative posting or a negative set of people that's what you become that's what you are you're part of that negative atmosphere and the seed of the word of God will not grow in that kind of atmosphere we want to keep the word of God in a positive atmosphere we want our our lips to offer the fruits of his praise from our lips to say what the word says is true amen now these are very simple uh thoughts and very simple truths but they work they absolutely work and these are these are the things this is how we handle the adversities in our life we handle it by the word of God we take God's word and then we establish that we make sure that this is God's word and then we just start repeating what God's word says and as we repeat what God's word says we're confessing the word of God and the word will not return void now God allows these tensions to come he allows it to happen in the church and in an atmosphere to see how you'll stand now the prophet of God says this here in the message um why Christ speak paragraph 37 he says this here actually we'll we'll we we'll take what does thou here I read this for you many times I'll read it for you here 1959 what Dost thou hear it says it's very strange Pastor here knows and other ministers watch out your Mount carel you're going to have a j juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God Pours Down and does something for you look out Satan is on the track just remember the next day that Monday after a good day on Sunday is going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the de day before so the Holy Spirit instills or installs something in you and then the next day Satan is trying to take it out of you and how does he take it out of you he doesn't come up and say hey I'm Satan I want to take that word out of you now he come he comes with a bad attitude somebody cut you off in traffic somebody rolled their eyes at you someone sends you an email someone bups you gives you the cold shoulder he's trying to take out what the Holy Spirit instilled in you and some of us are ready to fight so much we just drop everything and ready to go you're not going to disrespect me that way you look at me that way I'll deal with you you want to start it I'll finish it and that's the attitude of many people but the Holy Spirit spoke to you on Sunday maybe nobody else in their job was in an atmosphere like you and maybe your job is a negative in a in a a a a dark atmosphere for the word of God to grow in the seed but God planted the seed in you and that seed that he planted is his word and then we hold on to that word and let the word do what it's supposed to do it's supposed to grow that seed is supposed to multiply and produce more than what you actually receive that's how seeds work you plant a seed you water a seed you nurture the seed you you give it the atmosphere spere and then when it grows and you keep it growing and it grows and then the Harvest time comes and when the Harvest time comes you can't even eat all the fruit yourself your cup runs over you got to share it with other people and that's a beautiful thing when you reach that point and so we know that those Mondays those murmuring Mondays I call them you got to watch out for those murmuring Mondays because Satan is there to catch you look what brother randam says and why Christ speak he says it here in paragraph 46 46 Now isn't isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God Thrills every person in there the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders take place less than a week Satan is permitted to come into that congregation why does he do it God permits it and then the church begins to murmur and fall back maybe it wasn't so there's where we fail that's the failing of the church regardless of what takes place it's God move forward so not even a week later we have our special meetings not even a week later fighting tensions rubbings she said he said I can't believe they and that that Satan is allowed to do that he's allowed to do that so you can hold on to the seed of what God has done for you amen the prophet of God continues he says this here in the message possessing the enemy's Gates it was Moses after being also in the line of this Royal seed the Seed of Abraham that when he sat down into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel and God gave him signs and wonders to perform and to Smite the Earth and to bring forth frogs fleas and darkness and hell and rain and fire and had done all these Miracles yet when he let them out by the hand of Jehovah there come a time when he met the gate between him and the promised land there was the Red Sea a bar across the way they were hemmed in by Pharaoh's Army mountains and deserts and the Red Sea but Moses stepped forward and possessed the Gate of his enemy and crossed the Red Sea dry shod as he was walking on a dusty road he shall possess the Gate of the enemy God said so that settles it it was only a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as it's so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way way it's supposed to be God makes it that way who makes it that way God help me preach now Hallelujah who makes it that way God God makes it that way God brings tensions into the church see that old dirty devil bringing all the tensions into the church God allows the tensions in the church he allows it you after a great outpouring in the Holy Spirit not even a week later carnal comes Upon Us All Shook Up from that congregation God brings tensions into the church every son that cometh to God must be tried proven and tested he lets sickness strikes you he lets disease come on you to test you and to prove you to show the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you he per he permits all these things and turns the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take your life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you he can do most anything it's God's will for him to do it we're taught that is more precious than gold amen think about that God can allow or will allow tensions to rise to persecute you now if you're the true seed you'll keep that seed in the right atmosphere how many's ever had persecution strike them how many knows that it happens even from friends and other believers and God allows it sometimes the church will turn against you but God allows that but he planted the seed of the word in you and he expects you to keep that seed to keep that word committed now the seed versus the elements and the seed versus The Wicked one so you have the outside elements that's always going to be there the worldly pressures the things of the world the wicked one is also there to pressurize you but you are the believer that's actually planting the seed you are the one that plants the the the the Atmosphere by your your attitude and by your steadfastness in what God Said in his word once his word has been revealed to you then you realize that you plant those seeds and those seeds have to bring forth these are principles that must be adhered to by the word of God he instills those and he gives those to us so that we can we can um we can grow thereby it's for our benefit God gives that to us now the scripture says in Philippians uh uh Hebrews chapter 13 verse number 15 it says this here by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the what help me read the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased so we offer with the fruit of our lips the sacrifice of praise you know it's got to come from your lips that's what the song service is about that's what you know repeating the scriptures out loud together that's what it's about you know we can read the word in silence we can you memorize it but it's another experience when you speak it out how many's ever read the word of God out loud to yourself the Bible says faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and it might be you that you're hearing hearing yourself read the word faith cometh by hearing and the just shall live by what and we walk by what and not by sight we the just live by Fai faith we actually walk by faith and not by sight brother bam says in wisdom versus Faith he said that a true seed of the word cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom worldly wisdom it takes the atmosphere of faith for that word to work in that life and brother the prophet of God says in the hidden life in Christ speaking of this scripture Hebrews 13 and Heath made us priests and Kings unto God spiritual priesthood a royal Nation spiritual offering what is it now spiritual sacrifices that is quoting the scripture that is the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name now what kind of a what a spiritual sacrifice now now we might as well get started right here notice a good place to start from this is in the message of hidden life 1955 paragraph 81 spiritual priest Hood Royal Nation spiritual offering what is it now spiritual sacrifices that is quoting the scripture that is the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name now what kind of a what spiritual sacrifice now we might as well get started right here notice a good place to start from when a little confusion comes in the church you don't run over to one side and pout now if you are you sure ain't a priest see you pray through spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name see what I mean well you say I just don't feel like going to church but you're a priest it's your duty you've got to be there well I just don't feel like taking part in the service you're a priest making a sacrifice a spiritual sacrifice not giving somebody some hand me down as they call it today that's all good I have nothing against it not going to get somebody to come to church that's all good I have nothing against it but it's you you making the spiritual sacrifice the fruits of your lips giving praise to his name now those are the fruits of your lips now the fruits of your lips lips that sacrifice is that praise that you didn't want to really give it's the harder praise to give it's the tired praise it's a help it's to help me wake up praise it's I you know ain't nobody else singing I can't sing praise it's the praise that you give to him it's a sacrifice yes it hurts yes it takes effort yes but what are you what are you doing when you do that you're offering a sacrifice and every offering every sacrifice is a seed that God consume and there's a benefit that comes with every offering amen it will not return void you put your time in with the Lord it will not return void and we offer those sacrifices the sacrifice of praise the fruits of our lips now there's also the fruits of righteousness we read this in 2 Corinthians 9 for you I'll take it and it says that he which Seth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which sth bountifully shall reap also bountifully every man according as he purpose in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver that's the scripture 2 Corinthians 9 you know that word cheerful means God loves a hilarious is that word means hilariously it's like a hilariously cheerful Giver you look the word up God loveth a cheerful Giver it's hilarious and God is able to make all grace abound towards you that you all always having sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he ha given to the poor his righteousness remaining forever now he that Minister seed to the sore both Minister bread for your food and multiply your seed seone and do what increase what the fruits of your righteousness and that's what we want as Believers we want our righteousness to be increased that the life that we live the benefits the word of God that we're planed in our life we want that to increase in all spiritual matters says it again in Philippians 1: 9-1 and this I pray that you love your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that you may approve the things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense until the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God how many of us here want to have our fruits of righteousness to be filled we want that to be be filled those are fruits of righteousness so the Lord uses this example of seeds of harvest of fruits of seeds sown of seeds increase he uses those examples all through his word he uses it as we apply our time as we apply our our resources our finances as we apply our life our gifts he increases that to those that sow that seed and the most important one is that your seed that the fruit you increase the fruits of your righteousness let's look at Hebrews chapter 12 and verse number five and let's look at this just for a moment at this process on how this fruit can be yielded because we believe the seed of the word is planted in good ground and the proof that it's planted in good ground is that it will it'll understand it it'll bear fruit and it'll bring forth fruit Hebrews 12 5 and verse 11 for whom the Lord loveth he chastise and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is whom the father chasteneth not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not Sons furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasten us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chesing for the present seeth to be joyous but Grievious nevertheless afterwards it does what it yielded the Peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby now we want these fruits of righteousness but one process is that you have to come through the correction and many Believers and many people don't want to be in a place where they can receive correction they can't be corrected it's hard to be correct it doesn't feel good to be corrected but correction is part of the package it's part of the growth it's called pruning and the correction is how many know that we all need correction well write out what you need to be corrected on that's another step isn't it we we all say well nobody's perfect sure I need correction okay show me what you need to be corrected on that's a real issue it's not just a by word though nobody's perfect yeah we know nobody's perfect we got that nobody's perfect we all need to be corrected now what do you need to be corrected on well wait wait wait wait if it's going to be corrected I'm going to do I'm going to correct myself please the word does the correcting this is not no selfcheck it's not an honor System you're going to let yourself get by you squeeze by you change the rules won't you you expand the deadlines if you but but the word does the testing the word does the correcting and what we want we want the word of God to correct us so that our life will produce a righteous seed seeds of righteousness now this planting of the seed and the speaking the spoken word and speaking things that are positive these are all these are all laws that God has they're all part of his word but we have to play by the rules and we have to stay with the word in order for the benefits of the word to take its place and have root in our life amen and so if you got a negative seed you want to get rid of those and you want to plant a positive seed you start by picking up your Bible you start reading those promises out of the word you start reading that word and you start planting those seeds in your life you made a mistake we all do if you done things that you done that was wrong we've all done those then you got to go make those right and then what you got to move forward you just got to keep going on and once God forgives you you got to move forward and you can't let the Enemy Bring up your past what you did that was wrong if you made made it right with the Lord you can't you will you will incriminate yourself you'll die yourself you have to take what God's word says about forgiveness amen and placing it under the blood and we do that by faith we do that in spite of ourselves in spite of how negative we might think of ourselves we got to take God's word on it and God's word says He is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins confess your faults one to another and he will he will he'll forgive you he's faithful to forgive you amen of your sins and then you have to move forward look at the scripture in um James chapter 3 vers 13 and 18 the upper verses is talking about who can tame a Man's Tongue how little it is but it turns the ship it controls the horse the little member called the tongue no man can tame it it's a fireball sets things on hell of course you can take sharp words and destroy a the confidence of a young man or young woman and you can take those same words and build up a little life and build them up and encourage them because death and life lays in the power of the tongue and that tongue has the power to speak blessings and it has the power to speak curses and we want to be on the blessing side amen we want our mouth our lips to speak on the Blessed side say what God's word says let me ask you a question in the light of the world would would you consider brother bram's message positive or negative in light of the world what do you think the world would say about brother Brandon's message just take the titles 1965 1964 just start taking them some of those titles and you get into some of those statements and it sounds like it's negative negative negative sounds very hard but we know that that's the seed of the word of God it can't be negative it's positive but when it's cutting us and it's chastising us is for the purpose that it will yield forth fruits of righteousness now look at the message churches here in this city and across the the the the US those of you that have travel for the most part pretty decent assemblies pretty decent uh uh the way we handle ourselves the women the way they dress typically the way they conduct the church service you travel from the west or the east or whatever most of the message churches have a certain order and a decency about them why because there was a seed of the word that was planted it was planted in one it was in an aggressive atmosphere denominational they invited him just for the money they wanted the crowds but he preached the the pure word of God but now that word now found a resting place and look what it produced how many in here has never saw brother vam or metam raise your hand 90% of the congregation how many here has saw brother Bram or met him one two just a couple yeah sister there two or three so most of the congregation is is is made up of people who's never even met the Reverend William brandham but we came in contact with the seed of the word and the seed of the word produced a clean church a clean man a clean woman standards yes protocols principles that we stand on amen that's because the seed was planted in in faithfulness and it was a faithful seed and the word will not return void but look at this in James it says who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you if you got it you can turn there James 3:13 read it out of your own Bible or they might put it on the screen for you to help you out who is a wise man any do with knowledge among you let him show out of a what huh a good conversation or a bad one a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter envy and strife in your hearts Glory not lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish for where envy and strife is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then Peaceable then gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace unto them that what that make peace we're talking about the children of God Sons and Daughters of God the fruits of righteousness we want our fruits to increase this is the danger of gossiping now there's a difference between you know there's information and things that need to be said or need to be told all right we need to hear some things that are going on we have to hear that that's different than what God gossip is want to give you the definition of Gossip real quick how many want it you already know what it is don't you but let me read it for you all right somebody said keep going I will casual or unconstrained conversation reports about other people typically involving details that are not confirmed as being true you know what I heard I don't know but I heard heard did you hear the tapes then tell us that you heard that too didn't you tell us what the tape said but it ain't it the tapes ain't juicy enough I heard about brother bonsa I heard something about you brother bonsa I'm not going to tell you but I'm going to tell Brothers over there what I heard about you come on I haven't talked to you I haven't confirmed it with you I don't have the proof whether it's right or wrong but I heard it and now I'm going to use my lips careful now to speak something that I don't even know if it's true or not not valuable we use our lips to speak righteous things things that are confirmed in his word a person who habitually reveals personal or Sensational facts about others gossiper rumor or report of intimate nature Sensational facts about others gossip just be honest how many of you have ever been guilty of gossiping right I didn't say raise your hand but you did you're the honest on Gossip it you want to be the first to tell it even it's not confirmed yet but before it's confirmed you want to be the first to tell it it's gossip and and and it and it and it's working it's working to your own detriment you're planting the seed now you're spreading something that's negative and Satan is using your lips to do it by but God gave us his word that we can speak and that's true it's something that we heard yet the same and it has all the power in it to change a circumstance death and life lay in the power of the tongue you speak those things that are true and you stay steady and steadfast with those things that are true so we plant those seeds don't we and we thank God for them now the atmosphere is so important can I take 10 more minutes yes in the message in the message modern the Oddball he's talking about the atmosphere and I'm going show you how important this atmosphere is speaking of the outside elements that's against the seed and the enemy himself self that's against the sea the atmosphere and I certainly I say amen I walked out the door I say it would pay me every Sunday to drive up here or have my children even to come to sit under an atmosphere like this because it's always the atmosphere that brings the results you can lay a seed out there in the ground no matter how much that seed is gerti and lay it there it's got to have an atmosphere to make it live amen that sun has to come to a certain power before bring it to a certain atmosphere an egg has to have an atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter how fertile it is it's got to have that atmosphere modern events made clear by prophecy 65 uh December of 1965 he says this here in paragraph 46 now the Bible is a different book from any other sacred book there's no book like the Bible because the Bible is God in word form a word is a thought expressed God's thinking expressed it his words through the prophets and they wrote the Bible which is the word form which is in word form and Jesus called it a seed and any seed will bring forth of its kind in the right condition the right atmosphere now this book this book of Prophecy is for telling future events now the book contains the entire revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add to it or take from it every Revelation must come by it see it must be the word so he says it comes through the right condition and any it it will bring forth if it's in the right condition and that right condition is the right atmosphere we want to make sure that we are receiving the word in the right atmosphere that we're hearing it in the right atmosphere we're keeping it in the right atmosphere and you want to be with people that align themselves up with the word of God that you believe there's a quote where brother bandam says if it's against God's word you be against it another place it says if it's against God's word that is your enemy and that enemy is to come and take what God has sold into your heart so the understanding is by the wayside the Stony places they had no root the Thorns are the cares of the world and these all these atmosphere hinder the growth in the the moving of this seed to coming to maturity the good ground is he that understandeth and beareth fruit now you can ask God to give you an understanding you can you can pray and ask God to open my understanding Lord Lord are these words show me what I need to see out of this word open it up to me because we don't understand all of the seals it doesn't mean we don't listen to him we listen to him because there's Parts in there that we'll understand and he opens up more of it to us as the days go by amen and we thank God for it and so we know that God's word is a seed we know that there's an atmosphere that's at that's adverse to that seed it's a hostile environment sometimes it's our own atmosphere that's causing it and in Matthew Chapter 13 it says that Jesus who was the son of God he could not do many mighty Works in this place because of their unbelief he had Mighty works that he could do but he could not do these Mighty works because of their unbelief their atmosphere wasn't right we want a church that has the right atmosphere what if every what if every believer in here were to fall down on their knees and pray to God for a move of God in our little church and to help us and to help us to grow every believer was to do that and not critical and not looking around and not wondering why what if every believer did that do you think God would answer that prayer you think it would make a difference well essentially that's what we've been commanded to do when we come into the house of the Lord the Believers to come prayed up looking for God to do what he said he would do in this word he said I will be there in their midst where two or three would be gathered in his name and so we want to see that take place in our lives so we see that we become the word as we receive that word we then become the seed itself we see that in these Parables 1 Peter 5:6 say he will exalt you and do time in due season the exaltation will come and in the message perfect faith brother bam makes this statement here paragraph 93 said Jesus had perfect Faith he had it and it come because he was the word and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you my words this word abides in you um then ask what you will and it'll be done for you see if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall have it it'll be given to you time space nothing else has will ever change it you know it's done it's already it's already over with so you become the word as you receive the word can I take this a little bit further as my last place here to go here is in Leviticus chapter 25 this is the Lord giving promises to Israel the Hebrews coming out of bondage he's going to establish them he's going to cause them to grow and he caused them to grow by increasing the fertility of the womb he's going to grow a nation through the birth by increasing their fertility by taking away diseases making them strong and healthy that the family would grow through birth after birth after birth 10 kids 15 children Jacob had how many Abraham had how many he's going to he's going to raise up a nation through the birth and causing them to grow through the seed of the womb and this is the increase so God gives you this increase but here in Leviticus chapter 26 it says if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and do them verse three then I will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the Trees of the field shall yield their in their fruit and your threshing shall reach unto the Ving vintage and the Vintage shall reach unto the sewing time so it's showing that that your Harvest Time and your reaping time and your sewing time they're kind of overlap you'll be so blessed your Fields will just overlap in reaping and sewing that's what it's saying there and your threshing shall reach unto the Vintage and the Vintage shall reach unto the sewing time and you shall eat your bread to the full dwell in the land and I'll give peace in the land and you shall lie down and none shall make you afraid so it deals with the fear aspect and I will rid the evil Beast out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land and ye shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by The Sword so you're not running from them they're running from you five of you shall chase a hundred and aund of you shall put 10,000 to a flight and your enemies shall fall Before You by the sword for I will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my Covenant with you and you shall eat the old store and bring forth the old because of the new and I will set my Tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abore you or hate you and I will walk among you and will be your God and you shall be my people I am the Lord your God which brought you forth out of the land now what is this all based on this is all based on if you walk in my statutes and keep my Commandments and you do them I'll take the fear your fear for other nations I'll take that away from you I'll make five of you the equivalent of a thousand men and one of you the equivalent of 100 one of you can chase a thousand one of you will chase a 100 and five of you will put a thousand to a flight five of you shall chase a 100 and a 100 of you shall put 10,000 to a flight what the scripture says so he's going to walk among you I'll be your God and you shall be my people but if you will not hearken unto me verse 14 and will not do these Commandments he says you'll sow your seed in vain verse 20 and your strength shall be spent in vain like people spinning their wheels it's like people thinking they're catching up on a little time because you know they're not going to go to service on Sunday or whenever the service time is they won't go because they got to catch up on all the busy tasks that they have from the work from the job that the lord gave them and they're so busy they can't come to church and they can't put their time in the things of the Lord so they need to they need their own me time so they have to carve out their me time okay all y'all can me I can't be there with you guys I'm part of you but I can't I need to conserve my own time but then you're like spinning your wheels you leave early and then you get stuck in traffic or you try to take uh uh off the time from that the Lord has called you now I'm not talking about every time but I'm think I'm talking about your responsibilities as a Believer he calls you to a responsibility and you try to cut that in half and think you're going to save on catching up on some sleep or catching up on some rest or some time all of that is in God's hands did you know that time is in God's hands how many of you have ever ever been doing something for the Lord and it's like he increases your time like it's 9:00 and you're supposed to be 9:30 in your mind only five minutes pass you're like thank you Lord I needed more time and then other times it's like you think you've been only sitting around for an hour it's been three hours it's in it's in God's hands this time and when and when you don't uh keep his Commandments or walk in his statutes he said your strength will be spent in vain you're spinning your wheels burning a lot of gas but you ain't going nowhere spinning your wheels spinning your wheels spinning your wheels and you think you're catching up on your personal business time or whatever you whatever you're doing or you think that maybe you know that's too much for the kids to serve the Lord like that or you don't want to you know that sacrifice you don't want to give that you don't want to give that you know whatever you give you're not going to lose anything if you're giving it to the Lord right you're not you can't you can't and this principle is what you know the enemy has tried to put that upon us today and we want to serve God like he's in second or third place when actually he should be first placed right am as a Believer we put God first in all things look at what he'll do when you walk in his statues he says I will increase the rain over your land now who's in charge of a famine who can make it rain or make it stop raining who's in control of that huh God is who is in control of making a seed multiply 30 60 or 100 fold who's in control of that now science can try and other groups can try but God is in control of multiplying the seed amen who can take the fear from you that's God he's in control of that he said I will make you that you won't fear the other nations and he gives you the strength and the power to actually be able to Chase your enemies instead of your enemies chasing you these principles were established in the Old Testament under the levitical laws that if you do this and if you do this I got your rain covered and the rain's going to condition your land and your land will be real fertile and when you go plant the seed you'll get 30 60 you get 100 fold and when your mom and your dad get together they'll have those children they won't have these diseases they won't have all these stresses they won't have all these fears and all these problems because you kept my precepts in my word yes sir when you put God first you're planting the right seed in the right place at the right time and God will bring it to pass God's word is a seed we want to plant it we want to keep it in the right atmosphere we have the fruits of our lips and the fruits of righteousness that comes with it amen one last place in the scriptures and we'll close with this is in James chapter 5 verses number seven look what it says verse James chapter 5: 7 says if you have it say amen amen be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord Lord behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early in the latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draw it nine Grudge not one against another why would he tell us that because we need to hear it Grudge not one against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken you in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering afflictions and of patience God bless you God bless you richly you have need of patience after the word of God has come to you and James 5 tells us to be patient the Lord is waiting for that precious fruit to come forth when the latter age the last days and now he's coming establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh do we really believe that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh you believe we're really at the door the door is closing swiftly and fastly let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for your promises that you've given to us their yay and amen Lord we need the Holy Spirit to come upon that word to energize it to the believer and may their hearts not be not be persuaded Lord to let go of what you have establish in their hearts
