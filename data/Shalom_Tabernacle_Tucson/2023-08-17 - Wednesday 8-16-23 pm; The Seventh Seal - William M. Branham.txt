like to play in the seventh seal before we do I have a few things I'd like to say to bring up to what brother random is going to say in that seven seal a few notes that I have kind of tying in from Sunday morning service last week Sunday and we certainly enjoyed the service Sunday night hey man how many Joy brother Bob it was very nice we enjoy that just a bit of announcements um he's having his special meetings coming up in September the Labor Day weekend and it's a Friday Saturday and Sunday and he's invited myself and brother George to be the speaker and a brother brother from California I believe brother um Ronnie slavens will be the speakers and so that'd be nice if some of the Saints are able to go there we're gonna me and George are going to fight over on Friday or Saturday we service to take no no but it'd be nice if the Saints can go and be a part of that to support those meetings and that's the Labor Day weekend we'll get the announcement we'll put it on the board for you also this Sunday night we will be observing a Fort Washington communion we have put it off for this month for various reasons we haven't been able to but we'll do that this Sunday night the Lord willing and also there is a um just a way of uh announcement to you all that there is kind of what's developing in the Phoenix area with our brother art as you know he served as a deacon here for five and a half years he traveled every Sunday and pretty much every Wednesday I get off of work and you come here and he served and then his work changed the way it did and so he had to um stream from home there and he would still be I mean we've brother we all love Brother Art and he's been very faithful sister Annabelle and the girls they've and like I say I just really felt I prayed for them I've tried to get a answer for them and I thought the Lord would get them uh the the finance or the stuff that they needed so they can continue to be a part of the church here and it just didn't work out and um and so he would stream from his home and at the same time brother Roland McGraw had been asking us to come to be a part there and to help him out and sober the art would go there and brother Ezekiel and a couple others that go there to be a part of that service there but he still hadn't found his way and so instead of streaming from home he is able to stream from a hotel it's still a part of our our work here he's streaming the service now and I just wanted to um I wanted them to let Brother Art know how much we appreciate him and love him and um I know it's quite a sacrifice and I know that there could be a fear or concern as to is that another church that we're starting if it wasn't for Brother Art and the commitment I have for him we probably wouldn't maybe go that direction but because of the way things are as it stands that's what we are doing our last the first service I think was two Sundays ago they streamed together at the hotel just a couple families and so you be in prayer for for that amen Iraq thank you brother Chris and so um there's a fine gentleman that's in the city in Arizona his uh brother is a pastor in Lagos Nigeria for the delay I know him very well his Junior brother is here for the first time he's in Phoenix tonight and he'll be speaking to that little group there in Phoenix and then Friday he will be with Armando Rivera and then he'll be in Tucson I'm not sure where he'll be um for Tucson but the Lord willing we might be able to meet him on Sunday night the church here so you'll be a prayer prayer with him uh forget his first name I think it's femi and so we'll keep that in prayer amen can I get the lapel mic please if it's ready brother thank you so let's go right into the word before we go into this portion of the tape that I'd like to play for you and the portion of scripture we want to read is found in Revelations chapter 8. if you would stand with me and turn with me for the reading of the word now how many is glad to be here amen we certainly always counted a privilege to be found in the house of the Lord we'd like to welcome each of you and we pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you Revelations chapter 8 verse number one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon this service tonight may you bless each Heart Lord that's gathered and may you father take full control over all that we would say or do move away the unbelief and may our hearts be settled in on your word tonight give us what we have need of I pray we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated as you're being seated get turned into Saint John chapter 6. thank you musicians the scripture in Saint John chapter 6 is what we read on Sunday morning it was two days that our lord Jesus was ministering to the people we see the great miracle of the Loaves and Fishes thank you brother Roger switch over here and we see at the beginning of his great miracle signs and wonders a great crowd was gathered I'd like to turn into the verse we read it on Sunday and Jesus answered them have I uh on Sunday he says will you also go away now our lord Jesus as we brought it to you the three pulls in Revelations 8 1 that there was silence in heaven and we read those quotes for you or we read a quote for you in the seventh seal where brother random said that was he said that that silence was that so that Satan wouldn't know what the great mystery or the great secret was and we know that there's mysteries in the word that if it's common knowledge is not a mystery a mystery is something you don't know it has to be revealed and the revelation of the Seven Seals was a great mystery of the Bible down Through the Ages that had to be revealed through the seventh angel messenger in this last day and we share with you our brother around his ministry composed of the three pools first pool second pool third pool we read in Saint John 6 and showed in the scripture that Jesus had the same that that was his ministry first a great crowd of people came because of the signs wonders and miracles they were attracted to it and and then as he got deeper into the word the words begin to offend him and now brother Branham tells us and he preaches a message entitled three kinds of believers amen y'all praying with me or no all right and these three kinds of Believers are believers unbelievers and make-believers and we can see those three kinds of Believers identified in just that one chapter Saint John chapter 6. in in Saint John chapter 6 we'll see the Believers they take the word no matter what Jesus says it it isn't a question of understanding what he said it was just that he said it and so you make it work you reconcile it he'll bring the understanding later but then there's a group of people they want to follow Jesus and the great crowd remember the the first pool we'll call it signs wonders and miracles attracted everybody everyone was attracted to that a great large group of people unbelievers make Believers and True Believers but the only way that he could separate who was true believers signs wonders and miracles will never do that the way we separate whether you're a True Believer or not is through the hard sayings and there's hard sayings in the Bible there's hard sayings in the message there are areas that God will say things that you simply can't understand scientifically it won't under you can't make it uh come together even scripturally maybe but he said it and if Jesus said it it it matters who's speaking if if Jesus said it then that's the most important thing to understand who is speaking remember the disciples didn't know what he was talking about either Eat My Flesh and drink my blood and Jesus could have made a lot of statements why would he pick that statement that terminology except you eat my flesh and drink my blood he could have said except you receive my words and Believe on me that's not what he said he said except you eat my flesh totally contrary to Moses except you drink my blood totally contrary to Moses you have no life in you and then he goes further and says that before Abraham was I am and I was the bread that came down in the wilderness and all the while this is stumbling the people it's shaking I'm stumbling everybody's being stumbled the disciples are being stumbled the unbelievers being shaken and the make-believer they're all being shaken this is why we see in the beginning a large crowd and then as he began to teach they walked away from him and as they walked away from him it shifted the crowd it shifted the Dynamics of who the followers were and that's why he asked the question will you also go away now these hard sayings are necessary the hard sayings are like Lord don't say that when I'm inviting somebody to church for the first time like Lord Don't Preach on that like this I'm just get I just convinced this girl or this guy to come to church for the first time and you're gonna preach on that this is what I mean by the hard sayings they're in there there areas in the word that is it's hard for a carnal man to comprehend how many know what I'm talking about your heart sayings might not be mine but we we all come across these hard sayings and they're there on purpose they are necessary they must be there if they're not there you won't know who a True Believer is you won't know who What Judas is you won't even know who a real friend is until a hard saying comes along and so here we see the unbelievers in Saint John 6 64 and verse 66. I'll take 10 15 minutes and it will go right to this portion of the tape Jesus speaking he said but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him so here it is you're following him because of because of something these a disciple is a follower of Christ and these were Disciples of Jesus and Jesus begins to make these statements these are not Pharisees and Sadducees these are disciples these are people that are followers of the work of the movement and he starts making these statements now and many of his disciples decided not to follow anymore so what were they following for in the first place was it just the Miracles was it just the signs and was it the excitement of it and if I were to ask you the first the second and the third pool a Ministry to see that on display uh probably the first two Ministries would be the most exciting for human beings because this is what draws the biggest crowd is the first of the second pool the third pool which encompasses the signs wonders and miracles but it encompasses the hard sayings the visions that we can't explain the statements that seem very very hard to reconcile is he saying that he's the one or is he the only one or what is he saying here how can we make this but let me let me say this here if if the word of God is true and you're a True Believer there is no statement that Jesus can make that will cause you to turn back if your true son because you're not following based on your understanding of what he's saying you're following him because it was revealed to you who he is Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God who do men say I am who do they say I am him some say you John some say you're this but who do you say I am says he he looked he looked beyond the veil of the little man there to Carpenter son he looked behind all of the bad name of him being an illegitimate child he looked beyond all of that he says Thou Art the Christ when Peter calls this man the Christ there is no other man that he could have called that he's calling him God in flesh the Messiah the the one that we have longed and looked for and Peter got the Revelation and when he got it Jesus said nobody taught you that yeah you didn't learn that in Sunday School said but my Father in Heaven came down and revealed that to you Peter and upon this kind of stuff this material is how I'm going to build my church so the church is built upon the hard savings being opened up and you can see who's speaking amen all right so now that is the unbeliever look at the make-believer in Saint John 6 67 verse 70. so we already see a group that walked away from him there were no more with him verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve will you also go away Jesus answered them have not I chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil so he leaves a great multitude dwindles it down to the 70 that leave him and he's left with just 12 in even amongst just the 12 one of you guys are a devil and first John 2 18 says this little children it is the last time as you have heard that the Antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us that's what your Bible says talking about the Antichrist they left they were with us and then they left us and they left us prove that they were never really with us the the scriptures go on to say this here let me read this for you here actually I'm going to take maybe I'll take a quotation for you and I'll I'll read some more some more scripture all right second Corinthians chapter 10 verses 1 through 11. amen don't you love the Lord is it more of a brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how did all of our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat they'll all drink the same spiritual drink for the drink of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were are what there are one examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be idolaters as for some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and failing one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt Christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither remember ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the Destroyer now all these things happen unto them for what and samples or examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come second Corinthians 11 verses 13 and 15 says this for such are false Apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light therefore it is no great thing if his who ministers whose ministers Satan's ministers also be transferred transformed as The Minister's of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works now we didn't see who Judas was the disciples didn't know exactly who he was because the Antichrist Spirit hides very well and it it lingers around looking for a loophole and it is it is a spirit and if you if you come in contact with the Antichrist spirit it's not just a person it's a spirit that we're talking about that wants to find a loophole or someplace to to come against the hard sayings to come against the words of our Lord Jesus but that all happened for our example and this um great pool of promise I call it it is also a pool of problem problems I call it the problem pool because this is where many of the problems come with the brethren the problems don't come under the signs wonders and miracles that come under the hard sayings the heart sayings are the words that Jesus intentionally says or puts in there to sift out the make-believer and the unbeliever now brother random says this here about these hard sayings he says this here right all right let's see here if I can get this for you and the three kinds of believer he says this here in paragraph 267 267. remember and all ages has been as it is right now so brother random is now bringing all the ages into what's going on and what's taking place now what is now now is now present tense you look in the past you'll see those Spirits back there for an example to what's going on now there's nothing new Under the Sun the way we can know how to stand is we look how we we stood back there and then we know how to address what's going on right now because it's a spirit take names and faces off of it and just look at what is trying to accomplish then you can identify what kind of spirit it is and it says he says this here in three kinds of believer remember in all ages has been as it is right now there is always a popular belief among the people and it's always been just a little bit contrary to the real word remember it's never been just a ride out deny it oh no the Antichrist don't deny the word certainly not he says he believes it but just not all of it the way it's wrote here see now let's let's go over these three pools just for a moment what's the first pull was healing what was the second pull discernment and what was the third pool the revealing of the word and there's no higher order to reveal the word than a prophet so you can't preach a third pool without a prophet because a prophet reveals what Revelations 8 1 says what was the hour of this half an hour of Silence what does that mean what was that all right so I'm gonna close here and this is where brother random is going to end up on this portion of the tape I want to play for you just for a moment here it's in the revelation of the seven seal I want to take paragraph number 324 and that's actually we're gonna listen to paragraph 238 to 324 and you're going to see that this third pool is not a haphazard subject as we said Sunday morning it has a big range a long range it's actually almost nine years in the making this is given to brother Branham as a vision he saw a vision of a tent it was given as a vision of him fishing it was given a vision of a part of it was down in Mexico you see the healing you see there's so much in there and then as it developed he as he brings out the great Mysteries of the seven seal you'll see how it progressed so it's a there's a lot to it and then this quote in the seventh seal I want you to listen to it carefully and closely and these these mysteries on the seventh seal this book here on this revelation of the seven seal is not just for preachers it's not just for men this is for believers you picked this up and read it and pray God will bless you there's something in there for you now hear this now hear this in paragraph number three what did I call 324. let me read that for you here now some specifically bringing this for a purpose I felt it on my heart to bring it on Sunday and then this working this day this week yesterday and then today I really feel to bring this because the importance of it as I was studying it then I heard brother Randall say this in paragraph 324 he says this here but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do now this is the closing of the Seven Seals he preached one through six seals he preached a seven seal he brought all the background and he reads Revelations eight one that we read and he brings in all of his third pool and how it happened and then he kind of climaxes it with this in paragraph 324. it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord be prepared for you don't know what time something can happen now I take that very personal that's uh that's a word to me amen that's a word to you how do you prepare will you prepare well the tools that God gave you to prepare with and that's his word all right God bless you let's hear this portion of the message if you're ready back there sis paragraph uh two 38 to paragraph 324 and brother Branham is going to give explanation I want you to just pay closer tissue God bless you notice the breaking of this seal was a great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half hour ah is it great what is it it was hushed Heavens it was a thing moved for a half hour now if I belong if you're having a good time but in the suspense or between death and life it seemed like a millennium it was so great Jesus never mentioned it now the rest of them John couldn't even write of it no he is the forbidden right here see there's just a just didn't write this is silence and the Four and Twenty Elders that stood before God they're harping with their Harps they quit playing their harps the Angels hush their singing in heaven thank the holy cherubins and seraphants that Isaiah saw it in the temple with six sets or three sets of wings three or two over his face and two over his feet and flying and he's day and night there before God singing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and even when he walked there come into the temple the post of the temple move with their their presence and these holy cellophans hushed up Angels quit singing lying in the presence of God saying holy holy holy they shut up no angels singing no Praises no no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for a half hour all the hosts of Heaven Was silent for this half hour when the seven sealed mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke amen the land breaks it you know what they were awed by it I mean they didn't know there it was they just stopped why what is it now none of us knuckles but I'm I'm going to tell him I can my revelation of it and uh I am not prone to be a fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of it I am I'm not giving away to uh such as uh Delirious uh carry-ons and imaginary things I said some things might have been kind of strange to some people but when God comes around behind in Vindication and says it's the truth then that's God's word they seem strange that way and now uh certain as I stand in the platform tonight I had the Revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner that I will speak to you by God's help of a fool of it and then you let's go to that first here's the Revelation to begin what I want to tell you what it is what happens is that those seven Thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is Lay behind those seven consecutive Thunders rolling out now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidding to write about it even even not a symbol about it wow that's why there was a no active activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you sit now amen if it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven Thunders I noticed when the seven angels come forth the sound their trumpets there was one Thunder when Israel was gathered there was a trumpet when time shall be no more the last trumpet one Thunder but here is seven straight Thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven that perfect number seven thunders in a row uttered not lick it is just one two three four five six seven straight then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on it's relaxing time it was so great till it was Kept Secret from the angels now why if Satan should get a hold of it you might do great damage and that's one thing he don't know how he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret to Angels everything shut up if they made one move if I give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven God's perfect number seven just write down the road seven Thunders utter straight together like you're spelling out something notice at that time John's started writing he said don't ride it Jesus never spoke of it John couldn't ride it Angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see if you have anything he had ignored himself amen I said only God would know it amen amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up we can see these signs coming up me if Satan you get a hold of it if you want something to happen uh you'll have to take my word for this if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person will tell you but Satan will hear it see you can't get in my heart there as long as God's got it closed up for the holy spirit so that's between me and God he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it and I'll try I tell people I'll do a certain certain thing and once the devil cut off every wheel he can to get there see to beat me to do it but if I get the Revelation from God this don't say nothing about it that is different remember Satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's trying to do it we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this because he don't know it no way fine to know amen it's a third pull he just knows nothing about it it doesn't understand it but there's a sacred lays beneath that amen glory to God I could never think the scene the rest of my life when I seen now I don't know what I know the next step there but I don't know what how to interpret that it won't be long I've got roll down here when it happened if you can see here stop go no further than this right here I'm not prone to be a fanatic I'm just telling the truth but you remember the little shoe that I always tried to explain how the the soul laid next to so and so in the inner conscience and all that kind of stuff which it only made a big bunch of impersonation to start acting how do I take up the hand and hold the people and have vibration everybody had a vibration in their hands but you remember when he took me up there and said this is that third call and no one Lord amen you remember that Visions never fail they are perfectly the truth now notice remember the vision of the consolation Charlie and I here you are something going on I told you this week that's your it's been all around you but I wonder if you haven't noticed it remember the consolation of the vision of the Angels when I left cheer to go to Arizona you remember what time is it serves you remember that yeah notice there was only one great burst of thunder and seven angels appeared is that right one birth Defender seven angels appeared and I saw the lamb when he had opened the first seal and I heard as it was the voice of a thunder and one of the four beasts that come and see noticed one fender seven messages that's been sealed up and cannot be revealed until the last day at this age see what I mean amen now have you noticed a mysterious part yes of this week amen that's what it is that's what it's been amen it's been not a human being a man it has been the angels of the Lord amen amen notice there's Witnesses of three setting in here that a week ago a little over a week ago I was up way back into the mountains nearly to

with the seven seal the thing that I ordered all my life that mother seals meant a lot to me of course but oh you don't know what this is meant amen for one time in life I prayed I cried out to God I I at the Phoenix meeting any of the people there with me no uh late in the mountains one morning I got up and went up in sabinia Canyon it's great rugged high mountains and I went up in there there's a little foot Trail I had to lead all grown up in the lemon Mountain which is a 30 mile walk you're about 30 foot of snow up there so up in the mountain real early for four days going up through this little foot Trail rolling rocks along I felt led to turn this way and I turned and went up into some great Jagged rocks all my hundreds of feet high and I knelt down between those rocks I laid down this Bible lay down this book this little habit I said Lord God what does this vision mean I said Lord it it doesn't mean my dying you remember I told you I thought it might mean my death because something exploded until it just shook me to pieces you remember how many numbers I've heard of myself amen and I thought it could mean my death and then in the room I said was what what was it Lord what what does it need to mean I'm going to die if it is all right I won't tell my family just let me go on see if my work's finished I said now what was it buddy Santa witness vacuum hear me tell you that it wasn't that it was a furtherment of my word you get it see is setting up in sabinia Canyon the heavenly father knows this just as true as you see that come to pass those angels come right down and have Vindicated every message then you know whether it comes from God or not amen amen he was foretold You by a vision I couldn't tell you until the service is over it cause us forbidden to in savinia Canyon sitting up there that morning I had my hands up and while the wind blow more black hat there when I was standing there with my hands up praying I said Lord God what does this mean I can't understand it Lord what am I to do if it's my going home time let me go up here's where they never find me I don't want nobody to be mourning around if I'm going I want this the family thing I just took a walk with it they won't find me hide their way somewhere if they want to go away let me go maybe Joseph will find my Bible in here someday and let him use it if I'm going away let me go Lord and I have my hands out and always something hit my hand now I don't know I can't say did I go to sleep I don't know but they were going to a trance I don't know wasn't a vision I can't tell you one thing I can say is when I just the same thing like them Angels was and it struck my hand and I looked and it was a sword and had pearl handles amen amen real pretty and had a guard over it with gold and the blade looked like something like a chrome like silver was real shiny and it was so feathery and sharp all mine and I thought isn't that the prettiest thing to stick my hand I thought that's all for pretty but I said hey I'm always free to them things a sword and I thought what would I do with that it just then a boy shook down to the other Rock The Rocks said it's the sword of the king amen and then I come out of it the sword of the king now I've been set a sword of a king but it said the sword of the king and there's only one V King and that's God and he has one sword that's his word sent over his holy desk here with this holy word laying here it's the word amen amen oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and Secret the third standing there when this left me something has come to me and said don't fear no I didn't hear an old voice like on the inside of me spoke I have to tell you the truth this is exactly what happened something hit and said Don't Fear this is that third pool third party remember he said you've had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain I said don't even try this remember how many remembers that Vision why it's all worth it taken everywhere that's been about six years ago seven years ago and seven years ago said don't try to explain that said this is the third pool but I'll meet you in there is that right he said don't I was standing with a little baby's shoe when he told me something make your first pool and when you do the fish will run after the lure so then watch your second pull said because there's only these small fish he said then the third Paul will get it and all that ministers got around he said brother Graham we know you can do it Hallelujah brother Brown that's where I always get tied up with a bunch of preachers I love people they want you to explain everything this that and I said well uh uh uh uh I said I I don't know I said I've understand fishing now I said now first thing you do here's what it's done you see all the fish around you got to jerk The Lure well that's exactly the tactics of fishing so I said jerk the Lord now I see when I jerked The Lure the first time now the fish takes out after but there were little ones that's like they were catching so then I I said Daniel you're set and I jerked it out on the bank I had a fish but it looked like a skin Over The Lure it's just it was so little and then I'll stand there and said I told you not to do that and I started crying all the line was Tangled around me like this I had a standard of crying with my head down like that I said God oh I forgive me I I'm a stupid person Lord don't forgive me and I I had this line and that what I had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and I had that string was about as big around as my finger about a half inch like and the eyelet in this shoe was just about the size of a a littler than a 1 16 probably of an inch in the island and I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch card a voice comes that you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said now let him alone just then he picked me up he took me up and set your way up high the world meeting was going to look like a tent or a Cathedral of some sort now look there's a little box like little place over in the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody about me that light that you see there on the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over that tent and said I'll meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't tell it to nobody and in sabinia Canon he said this is the third pool and the street great things it goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language let's stand right there and look right straight at it and this is the third poll coming up amen and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all Heaven Messiah now I better stop right here see I just I just feel checked not to say no more about it see so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not over okay the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it and I want you to know before I even note any word about that that Vision come years ago do you remember that and here it is just as this other has slides right straight into the word exactly what it was and God knows my heart I never one time thought of such a thing as that amen amen you're it was it's later than we think hello Ma that shows us from God for see if it's exactly in the promises of God from the end of the the message you notice notice now are they in the time message the seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but don't say anything about the seven and the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total Secret according to the Bible before knowing that and remember Revelations 10 1 7 one to seven chapter 10 1-7 at the end of the seventh Angels message all the mysteries of God will be known we're at the end time the opening of the seventh seal now how did I know the other day last Sunday a week ago today when I was preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals and little things I didn't realize what it really was talking about and now I see it it is in such a humble way you think it's something like that would be revealed to the Vatican or but it comes just like John the Baptist amen it comes like the birth of our Lord in a state of the Lord glory to God we're here oh my God how do you see it the truth of God's Vision the seven Angel bringing me from the West they were coming from the West Coming Back East bringing here for this message tonight oh my God now the voice of the great Thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed that it had proven that it was of God just think now I knew not these seals and they've been revealed this week did anybody think of that are those seven angels being this being the message that is coming forth then Angels bring me back here for them remember the seventh messenger was the seven Messengers was the noted one the need the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any I see that we're standing like this all right we're just I want you to notice and I was standing here and I was watching those other see one first bunch of little birds feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew Eastward and the second batch were brighter bigger birds look like Devils pointed wings they flew Eastward first pull second pull then the next was angels and it's uh standing right there and this exposure left and I was looking this way towards the west and they come and just picked me up in there and I went Plumbing out of my knowing and the one of them coming was the one that looks estranged to me was the one on mine beat the left where I entered the consolation at but counting from the left to the right it would have been the seventh angel see coming across now remember the seven Messengers do you remember the Pyramid of flight Rock of Junior Jackson's dream that I attributed you notice the night that I left and uh there were six dreams came and every one of them directly to the same thing then the vision started and sent me West Junior he was watching well notice look how perfect I'm I'm open and trusting at you people realized that I'm trying to put this grace on Jesus Christ who is the author of all of it and the only reason you never heard me talk like this before in your life but this hour is approaching amen amen notice how to make it sure to you so it can be driven down I'm fixing to leave you again I don't know where I'll go I must preach the gospel other places but now that you might say I've heard all that kind of Fanatics I don't know why I can't judge any other man I only have to answer to God for what I or for myself but has there ever been one time I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord it wasn't right in all these years nobody else can say so because I always told it just the way he told us now let me just show you that this is exactly true and confirming now remember if there be a spiritual or Prophet I'll the Lord will speak to him in visions and make known to him by dreams interpretting dreams is that Joseph you can interpret dreams and speaking and see Visions is that true now notice this the sound when this taking place Junior was standing in a field that had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something good on the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now I took some kind of a bar and cut it off and on the inside was White Rock that had nothing wrote on it and at that time I started to the West and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast return back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreted this Unwritten word amen amen now that isn't perfect God Almighty I want you know what it is what am I trying to say this for friend is to show you where at the end time now if that others is perfectly on the dot with the word so is this perfectly on the dock with the word we are here we're at the end friends soon it shall be time run out Millions will lose their lives Millions will be now believe that they are saved will be counted father for the atomic age we are living at the last hour by the grace of almighty God by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of Christ how long brother brown maybe 20 years maybe in 50 years maybe in a hundred years I don't know and maybe in the morning maybe yet tonight I don't know and anybody says they do no they're wrong amen God Only Knows amen now notice so help me by God I tell the truth that these are spiritually discerned to me discerned by the Holy Spirit and by every one of them has identified its place in the Bible now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it just what it is what it said but I know that it was in seven Thunders uttering themselves right close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I see then when I've seen that I look for the interpretation of Phil Crosshair and I couldn't make it out that's exactly right the hour isn't quite yet far amen but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord [Music] Hallelujah be prepared or you don't know what time something can happen I bless you how many can say Amen to the word no you tell me what's more important than the coming of the Lord what's more important than being prepared for the coming of the Lord either brother Branham is telling the truth or he is not I believe he's telling the truth that's the position we take amen God bless you so much I was listening to uh this great preacher what was his name not listening to him but about him Charles Finney and there was a great atheist he's a doctor atheist would go and hear him and they asked him why does he go in here uh brother Finney preach he says because Charles Finney believes what he's preaching and that's the way I want to be I want to believe what what God sent to me and not have any questions or doubt there so God bless you so much just that bless your heart uh this evening let's go to the Lord and
