[34:16] few years back the night of worship I
[34:18] forget it's the online choir forget the
[34:21] name of what it's called what its name
[34:23] is
[34:24] but and then there's a banquet on Friday
[34:26] night
[34:28] and we had planned we got our tickets
[34:30] way back and then you know as you know
[34:33] this season has just been a really you
[34:35] know a lot of folks have died and the
[34:37] different travel things that have come
[34:40] about and so um this last trip we were
[34:45] last weekend in Montreal had such a
[34:47] wonderful time it's it's been nine years
[34:49] since I was last there and uh in in the
[34:54] country in Canada so the Lord worked it
[34:56] out we were able to to go and that
[34:59] Sunday morning last Sunday morning I was

[35:16] shawinigan we had a wonderful service
[35:19] there um we had some trips planned a

[35:52] strong as ever and just um yeah I just
[35:56] pray the Lord I'll have that strength
[35:57] strength I think it's because he goes

[39:46] word I we want to read some of God's
[39:48] Eternal Word and speak to us a few
[39:51] moments from the scriptures and then
[39:54] have prayer for the sck
[39:57] oh how I love to talk about him W you I
[40:00] just love to talk about him
[40:03] now I want to reads out of the Bible 2
[40:07] Kings the 2 chapter the 12th verse a
[40:10] portion of it and Elijah saw it and
[40:14] cried my father my father the Chariots
[40:17] of Israel and the horsemen
[40:20] thereof and now for way of a a text or a
[40:25] subject I want to speak on a
[40:28] second-handed robe so may the Lord add
[40:32] His blessings as we talk to you this
[40:34] morning and you be in prayer for
[40:37] us during this time of the reign of
[40:40] Israel in the land Israel was a nation
[40:45] and it was a mighty nation and it was
[40:48] kind of a peaceful time among the
[40:50] military part of it but in the uh
[40:54] spiritual part of it it was uh kind of
[40:58] an a time of of
[41:02] impersonation and if we look back into
[41:04] the Old Testament we can
[41:07] always uh find uh examples of what's
[41:11] going on
[41:12] today always in the Bible the things
[41:16] that are now are just the antitypes of
[41:20] what was at the beginning now the Book
[41:23] of Genesis produces everything that's in
[41:26] the world today there's nothing in the
[41:29] world but what didn't begin in Genesis
[41:31] for it is the beginning in there started
[41:35] every ISM and Genesis started every uh
[41:40] thing that started and the true church
[41:42] started in Genesis and the false
[41:44] Believers started in
[41:46] Genesis and the indifference started in
[41:49] Genesis Genesis was the beginning and
[41:53] now during the reign of Elijah or the
[41:58] pilgrimage of Elijah here on Earth which
[42:00] was uh God's Prophet for the hour and
[42:04] God has never left himself on the earth
[42:08] without a witness God has always
[42:11] somewhere someplace had a person that he
[42:16] could put his hands on and would stand
[42:18] for a witness so if he did that down
[42:22] since Genesis the beginning surely not
[42:27] somewhere God has a man that he can lay
[42:29] his hand on now for he he's more than
[42:34] one man now he has many man that he can
[42:38] lay his hand on because we're coming
[42:40] down to the the Gathering time the
[42:43] Harvest Time Genesis was the pling of
[42:47] the seed and these 6,000 years has been
[42:50] the maturing of the Harvest and now the
[42:53] seed has become a seed itself it's went
[42:57] back to the Blossom and from the blossom
[43:00] to the to the fruit and it's the
[43:02] Gathering time now Harvest Time all all
[43:05] the great things have started the true
[43:07] church has started in Genesis has come
[43:09] down to the fruit time the Fruit of the
[43:12] Spirit and the Antichrist that started
[43:15] in Genesis has come down to its fruit
[43:18] and we're just in the closing time of
[43:20] this world entire
[43:23] dispensation the of the Marty be and and
[43:27] we it's the greatest time that anyone or
[43:31] at any age ever Liv is this time it's a
[43:35] shaking time it's a Troublesome time for
[43:38] Sinners but it's a marvelous time for
[43:41] Christians because we know that we are
[43:44] are packing up are gathering the last
[43:47] little efforts together to go home and
[43:51] meet the Lord now people today as you
[43:54] look around and see the Great
[43:57] trouble and distress facing the nation
[44:01] or a few nights ago I was talking to
[44:04] someone was one of these here to Lookout
[44:06] agents that
[44:07] watches and they said brother Bram we
[44:10] were just instructed by the government
[44:13] never to advise people anymore to lay
[44:15] down by the wait from the window on the
[44:17] floor at the bomb hit or never to go
[44:20] into a basement because this new bomb
[44:23] that they could radio guide from Moscow
[44:27] a four Street low and hit right on the
[44:29] street shoot it up it's got T things in
[44:31] it to explos it takes it so many
[44:33] thousands so many thousands got it to
[44:35] the stars and rayar and drop it exactly
[44:38] on Fourth Street in Louisville from
[44:39] Moscow Russia and when it would hit
[44:42] there don't have to ra use a plane or
[44:44] nothing just scre off your and it'll
[44:46] land right there and it will blow a hole
[44:49] in the ground of the area uh the depth
[44:52] of 175 ft for 15 square miles either way
[44:56] go
[44:57] 15 square miles there ain't nothing to
[45:00] do but get ready to take a flight up
[45:02] stairs is the only thing to do well that
[45:04] time come y think they shoot 50 of them
[45:07] or 100 of them at one time if wanted to
[45:09] it'll all be over within the space of I
[45:12] believe it's a 60 or 80 minutes or
[45:15] seconds rather from there to here
[45:17] through the
[45:19] interation of the whole thing would take
[45:21] place there wouldn't be nothing left
[45:23] between Louisville and Henryville and
[45:26] between Louisville and and bar toown are
[45:29] down in there but one hole in the ground
[45:30] a bunch of dust Lan that's all would be
[45:32] left besides the eies that would go out
[45:34] and burn for miles and miles and miles
[45:37] beyond that and while one's are dropping
[45:39] there and another one's dropping over
[45:40] somewhere else to meet with it I'm so
[45:42] glad that we have a
[45:45] shelter the name of the Lord is a mighty
[45:49] tower the rightous run into it and our
[45:52] safe no matter how many bombs or how
[45:55] many anything else if we're safe there
[45:58] so the world and the cner not having
[46:01] this shelter of this safety place it's a
[46:04] shaking time I believe if I wasn't a
[46:07] Christian I'd go crazy the thinking of
[46:09] what might happen at any time and with a
[46:13] house full of little kitties and
[46:15] everything I wouldn't know what to do
[46:17] but I'm so glad that I can stand in my
[46:19] house and introduce to them a shelter
[46:22] that no bomb could ever touch or nothing
[46:25] else the protecting wings of the Lord
[46:29] Jesus not by power not by might but by
[46:32] my spirit sayith the Lord that is our
[46:36] protection and what a great glorious
[46:39] time it is to know that all sin and
[46:42] struggles and trials of life will soon
[46:44] be over it'll all finish one of these
[46:47] days and we'll go home to be with the
[46:50] Lord now what's left is a time to preach
[46:54] the gospel and to bring into this great
[46:57] tower as much as many as we can and then
[47:02] as we see the pattern of our lesson
[47:04] today of Elijah doing his Reign he or
[47:08] his
[47:10] pilgrimage on Earth while he was a great
[47:13] mighty man God was using him in Mighty
[47:16] ways with Mighty power and we find out
[47:20] that during this time there was a group
[47:23] of
[47:24] impersonators who tried to impersonate
[47:27] Elijah who tried to do the same things
[47:29] Elijah done and so we find the same
[47:33] thing today impersonations of
[47:37] Christianity people who try to act like
[47:39] Christians who try to make themselves
[47:42] Christians you can't do that God has to
[47:45] do that he's the only one who can do it
[47:49] so they farmed a school and called it
[47:52] the school of the prophets and they all
[47:54] went up to the school of the prophets
[47:56] and the educated them and I can imagine
[47:58] all those preachers up there wearing the
[48:00] same kind of coat that Elijah wore I can
[48:03] imagine trying to impersonate him on his
[48:06] voice the way he spoke and and way he
[48:08] presented himself everyone trying to do
[48:11] the same thing because Elijah was a
[48:13] great man used of God and we find the
[48:17] same thing today I listening to the
[48:19] radio broadcast not long ago they got
[48:21] Billy Grims all over this country since
[48:23] Billy was in loable everybody trying to
[48:26] imp make the same thing almost comb
[48:29] their hair the same way and and wear the
[48:32] same thing and same kind of uh voice and
[48:36] so forth but you can't do that you just
[48:40] got to be who you are and what God made
[48:42] you to be that's right and so we find
[48:46] how that perhaps in them days the same
[48:49] thing took place now God seeing
[48:54] foreseeing that Elijah's days was
[48:57] numbered that he had so long he could
[48:59] stand here on Earth as everyone has so
[49:02] he was going to have a successor to
[49:05] Elijah and when he did God called this
[49:08] man he wasn't in no Seminary when he
[49:10] called him he was plowing in a Feld with
[49:13] a yoke of ox doing uh the service of
[49:16] taking care of his mother and father and
[49:20] God called him to be the successor of
[49:25] Elijah or Elijah perhaps many up to the
[49:28] school thought they were surely going to
[49:31] be his successor they was going to wear
[49:33] his robe as soon as he was finished with
[49:35] it but God does the
[49:38] calling God does the choosing God does
[49:43] the
[49:43] electing God does the setting in order
[49:47] God has set in the
[49:49] church some Apostles some prophets some
[49:53] teachers some evangelists and pastors
[49:56] God does that
[49:58] himself we cannot make one uh hair black
[50:03] or white neither can we add one thing to
[50:05] our statute by taking thought God in his
[50:09] infant Grace and by his election and his
[50:13] for knowledge sets these things in order
[50:16] and every Wheel Works just right I like
[50:19] that I would be a discouraged man this
[50:22] morning if I didn't believe in the
[50:24] election and calling of God if I thought
[50:28] that this world was left to the outcome
[50:30] of it by the power of man and by the
[50:34] wisdom of man and by the big fours and
[50:36] the UN and who never even mentioned
[50:38] God's name I be a discouraged person but
[50:42] I'm not looking to that for the outcome
[50:45] I look down in the pages of this old
[50:47] book here where God wrote it out in
[50:50] everything will come just exactly the
[50:52] way he said it that's all so the only
[50:54] thing for me to do is not line up with
[50:56] them but line up with Calvary line up
[50:58] with God line up with his word saying
[51:01] his word no matter how much it looks
[51:03] like it's going to be that way it's
[51:05] going to be way God intends it to be it
[51:09] can't be nothing else or being infant
[51:12] know the end from the beginning and he
[51:14] makes everything come to his praise
[51:17] that's right all things will have to
[51:18] work together everything will have to
[51:20] shape right up this
[51:22] place my if that wouldn't make the
[51:25] courage in a Christian
[51:27] amen nothing can go wrong after all it's
[51:30] not our battle it's his amen it's not
[51:33] our wisdom it is the only one thing we
[51:36] had to do is put our faith and trust
[51:38] there and set still and see the glory of
[51:41] God Amen yeah moves around to its place
[51:44] never wheel moving it may be scattered
[51:47] from side to side but it'll move right
[51:49] into its right place when God speaks the
[51:51] wordu he knew the end from the beginning
[51:55] he knew he to choose he knew Elisha
[51:58] would take Elijah's place before the
[52:00] world was ever form amen everything has
[52:03] to work just exactly right and we're
[52:06] worried about our loved ones and so
[52:08] forth will they ever come in their names
[52:10] if they were written in the Lamb's Book
[52:12] of Life before the foundation of the
[52:13] world they'll work right in there that's
[52:15] the only thing you can do we give
[52:16] Witnesses Shine the Light God does the
[52:19] one that brings them to them
[52:21] now notice in Elijah then after uh
[52:27] he threw his robe on him and tried it on
[52:30] him other words Elijah the prophet who
[52:34] had the mantle of God on his shoulders
[52:37] he came down and laid it across Elisha
[52:40] the farmer to see if it would pit him
[52:44] and it take me about 10 years to get
[52:46] older to fit that
[52:48] man you know God usually puts us in the
[52:51] shop and trims us up now he didn't alter
[52:54] his robe to fit Elijah he ordered Elisha
[52:57] to fit the
[52:58] Rob and that's what he does today he ERS
[53:02] us to fit the Rob not the RO to fit
[53:05] us sometimes we want to make the road
[53:08] fit us but we can't do that you got to
[53:11] let be altered yourself for the RO it's
[53:15] God's robe and he made it perfect and
[53:18] we've got he's got to bring us into that
[53:20] real to make the Rob finished so we
[53:23] can't be perfect ourselves we know we
[53:26] can't there's no way for us to be and
[53:28] yet he said for us to be so but what he
[53:30] did he made a preparation for us the
[53:33] Lord Jesus Christ and his righteousness
[53:36] that's where the Perfection comes of
[53:38] ignoring our own Holiness of which we
[53:40] have none and our own thoughts which
[53:43] ought not to be but we rest solemnly
[53:46] upon the finished work of the Lord
[53:50] Jesus God sent him to the Earth and it
[53:53] was in him that we rest
[53:57] amen notice all these years as far as we
[54:01] know he just had that one baptism of the
[54:04] Rob going over him but through the years
[54:08] God had molded the man's character into
[54:10] a place that where every called that he
[54:13] would fit into the
[54:16] RO and be the servant of the Lord and
[54:20] then when Elijah passed through and thr
[54:22] it on him and he started up towards gilg
[54:26] and many of the other places they went
[54:28] on to the school of prophets on the road
[54:31] Journey
[54:32] on and finally Elijah was trying to get
[54:37] Elisha to turn
[54:39] back did you notice it trying to get him
[54:43] to turn back to I otherwise maybe the
[54:46] road's a little too steep for you son
[54:49] maybe it's a little too narrow for you
[54:52] to walk you know where Elijah walk was
[54:55] straightness and wherever God's true
[54:58] servant preaches the gospel it's a
[55:01] straight unadulterated gospel for it's
[55:04] preach well one day he went up there to
[55:08] the school of the prophets to visit him
[55:11] and they asked him to leave it said it's
[55:13] too straight around here for us what we
[55:16] need today is some more straight gospel
[55:19] preaching that'll separate the wheat
[55:22] from the chat or the right from the
[55:25] wrong
[55:27] make what's right's right what's wrong
[55:29] is
[55:30] wrong all these fellows with their
[55:33] experience all that they were they sent
[55:35] out to get something to eat and one of
[55:37] them got a wild Vine and gathered some
[55:40] wild gourds and cooked up some death in
[55:42] their ecclesiastical pot and the first
[55:45] thing you know they cried out there's
[55:47] death in the pot but Elijah was a double
[55:50] potion know what to do so he put a
[55:52] handful of meal in the pot said now go
[55:55] right ahead and eat it in other words
[55:57] that today in a type I would think that
[56:00] we've got a lot of Methodist Baptist
[56:03] Presbyterian Lutheran Pentecostal and
[56:05] everything else all mixed together and
[56:07] one fighting against the other and we
[56:09] don't need to OU the whole thing and do
[56:12] away with it we need another handful of
[56:15] meal keep the same church the meal was
[56:19] from the house of the school there which
[56:21] was the meal offering that the people
[56:23] brought in and the first fruits of the
[56:25] heart which was ground with a certain
[56:27] bird that made every grain of meal the
[56:30] same and then when this meal being the
[56:33] same was the type of Christ meal is life
[56:37] and when the type of Christ the meal
[56:40] being ground up the same meaning Jesus
[56:43] Christ the same yesterday today and
[56:47] forever and the meal in the meal
[56:50] offering and when they put this meal
[56:52] into there putting Christ into death
[56:55] brought life amen that's what makes the
[56:59] difference in our dead form in our
[57:02] differences in our ecclesiastical
[57:05] arguments and everything if we would
[57:07] just bring Christ into it it would
[57:09] change death and separation into life if
[57:13] we were just do it thank you there's 19
[57:17] million Baptists in America there's 13
[57:20] million methodists in America there's 11
[57:24] million Luthers in America and 10
[57:26] million Presbyterians in America and God
[57:30] only knows how many Catholics which outd
[57:32] do any of the denomination but in all of
[57:35] it what do we need a handful of
[57:39] meal we need to bring life to the church
[57:44] and Christ is the life amen he came to
[57:47] bring us life so they had their disputes
[57:50] and their schools and their the
[57:53] theologies and so forth and then Elijah
[57:57] told Elisha you better turn
[58:00] back because the way may be a little
[58:02] hard but a man of God who's once tasted
[58:07] or been sowed across his shoulder the
[58:10] robe of God's righteousness and power is
[58:13] not too easy to turn back when I heard
[58:16] the pastor say this morning that are
[58:19] many are becoming discouraged what we
[58:22] need Brothers take courage what we need
[58:25] is to be in courage amen that's right
[58:28] trials may come we never L promised to
[58:31] be immune from him but he'll give Grace
[58:34] to go through them if the Mountain's too
[58:37] high to go over too deep to go under too
[58:39] wide to go right he'll give Grace to go
[58:41] through it right just don't worry but
[58:46] keep your eyes on Christ for he's the
[58:49] only one that can take us through now we
[58:53] see him as a journey on to the school
[58:57] and he said you stay here now be here
[59:00] and settle down and be a good teacher of
[59:02] Theology and so forth and you probably
[59:05] someday may become the dean of the
[59:07] college here but I've got to go on down
[59:10] a little farther could you imagine a man
[59:13] of God being satisfied to be a dean of a
[59:17] college one the power of God LA right
[59:19] around where he was standing no sir he
[59:21] said as the Lord liveth in your soul
[59:24] live I'll not leave
[59:27] I like that they no matter how much
[59:30] discouraged it comes from your mother
[59:31] your papa or from your pastor
[59:34] amen onto the Jordan they went they
[59:38] crossed over and Elijah said now what
[59:41] will you that I do for you he said a
[59:45] double potion of your spirit to come
[59:47] upon you know what he had a work to do
[59:51] he said a double potion not just a good
[59:55] a warm EXP experience not just a good
[59:58] handshake or a good fellowship with the
[1:00:01] rest of the church but why I want is a
[1:00:04] double potion of what's the best
[1:00:06] now I tell you when God sets a man for a
[1:00:10] world P he's got to have something
[1:00:12] better than the world's God he's got to
[1:00:15] have something better than the church's
[1:00:16] God he's got to go for a double potion
[1:00:20] if there ever was a time that a double
[1:00:22] potion is needed it's the day in the
[1:00:25] reals out the people something better
[1:00:28] something higher I can't I think Beans
[1:00:32] and Cornbread is very good but sometimes
[1:00:34] I have to reach up a little higher and
[1:00:37] we do that we've got to we got to keep
[1:00:40] climing Israel was backsliding if it
[1:00:42] kept staying on the same ground she's
[1:00:44] got to be moving on or moving back
[1:00:47] that's the way the church is so as they
[1:00:50] went along wasn't but a few minutes
[1:00:53] until he said you've asked a great thing
[1:00:56] but nevertheless if you see me when I go
[1:01:00] you can have what you ask for now that
[1:01:04] has to be tangl of motive tangl of Heart
[1:01:10] tangl of ey keeping your eye on the
[1:01:15] promise Hallelujah if you're sick this
[1:01:19] morning if you are afflicted there's one
[1:01:22] great promise not by Elijah but by God
[1:01:24] himself if thou can't believe when you
[1:01:29] pray believe that you get what you ask
[1:01:31] for and you shall receive it no matter
[1:01:35] what the doctor says how much this goes
[1:01:37] or that goes keeps Sangle on the promise
[1:01:41] Elijah give him a condition if you see
[1:01:44] me when I go it'll come on you there's
[1:01:48] the promise if thou can't believe all
[1:01:51] things are possible to them that believe
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:56] sometimes I look at myself and think
[1:01:59] I've been such a jellyfish in my life I
[1:02:02] have waited and missed many thousands of
[1:02:05] souls into the kingdom because I waited
[1:02:09] and said God depended too much on a
[1:02:11] spiritual gift and said Lord if you'll
[1:02:14] just show me if you'll give me a vision
[1:02:17] what to do and God give the vision then
[1:02:20] I'll turn around and let somebody talk
[1:02:22] me into something else and all I have
[1:02:26] never come to the spot yet until I like
[1:02:30] I have at this time that I feel it's a
[1:02:34] Fai that we must step out there because
[1:02:37] it's a promise and the things that he
[1:02:40] has done and the healings that he has
[1:02:43] performed and the Miracles in much has
[1:02:45] come down and had his picture taken by
[1:02:47] the side of it and so forth which is
[1:02:49] never been KNN since the world began and
[1:02:53] then stand around like a jelly it even
[1:02:56] makes me discouraged with myself it's
[1:02:59] time to keep your eye on the promise
[1:03:03] that's what by God's grace I aim to do
[1:03:05] it I realize that every devil or Hell
[1:03:07] will shoot at it but by God's grace I a
[1:03:10] to keep my eye on the promise Elijah
[1:03:14] said if you Elijah said if you see me
[1:03:16] when I go you will have what you ask for
[1:03:18] amen that's right you got to keep your
[1:03:21] eye on it watch the promise what to
[1:03:24] school if you turn back to Bo how am I
[1:03:26] doing now I behind the prophet he a fail
[1:03:30] madebe but he didn't care what the
[1:03:32] school thought what all the teachers
[1:03:34] thought he didn't care what the
[1:03:35] neighbors thought or the houses or who
[1:03:37] looked at him he kept his faith in the
[1:03:40] promises what we need today is faith in
[1:03:43] the promise of God I don't pay no
[1:03:45] attention to what this one says or that
[1:03:47] one says as a brother said a minister
[1:03:50] had two girls that were mute and that
[1:03:53] the criticism all divine healing that
[1:03:56] the children cannot be healed don't pay
[1:03:59] no attention to the critics keep your
[1:04:02] faith on the promise God said so a
[1:04:05] prayer of fa shall save the sick and God
[1:04:08] shall raise them up if he can make one
[1:04:11] you to he he can make another death here
[1:04:14] we know byble proof that he does that
[1:04:17] amen he our face on the promise our eyes
[1:04:21] single our ears single our heart single
[1:04:24] and one thing on Jesus Jesus Christ and
[1:04:27] he's able to perform that which he has
[1:04:30] promised oh when we think of that it
[1:04:33] changes the whole thing when we get that
[1:04:37] God made the promise God was the one
[1:04:39] that said it now hear was God's
[1:04:41] representative set it and now God
[1:04:44] himself has set it then what can we do
[1:04:47] nothing but keep our mind on that that
[1:04:50] if you see me when I go away you can
[1:04:53] have the promise Elisha kept his eyes on
[1:04:56] Elijah no matter what how for each side
[1:04:59] what taking place on each side what
[1:05:01] taking a place before back he never even
[1:05:04] looked at he kept his eyes on the
[1:05:07] promise there you are your eyes on the
[1:05:11] promise I think of the lady that we
[1:05:13] visited the other night sister sty and
[1:05:16] the doctor telling her how bad she was
[1:05:19] and I never told her a totally loved one
[1:05:22] and how impossible it be for her to ever
[1:05:24] get well now brother or son-in-law asked
[1:05:28] me about it I said if she can keep her
[1:05:32] eyes on the promise no matter what takes
[1:05:35] place keep your eyes on the
[1:05:37] promise a few weeks ago sister wood
[1:05:40] sharing brotherwood two bosom friends of
[1:05:43] ours here at the church I was in
[1:05:45] Michigan with my friends Leo and Jean we
[1:05:48] left the Chicago meeting went to some of
[1:05:50] their people to for two days to go deer
[1:05:52] hunting with bulls and arrows and on my
[1:05:55] road in fact my wife had got a hold of
[1:05:57] me and she said pray for Miss Woods's
[1:06:00] mother a caner as eating off her face
[1:06:04] and said I have never seen sister wood
[1:06:06] th alarm she's weeping sister wood has
[1:06:08] always been a hero of Faith since God
[1:06:10] healed her boy a crippled leg and to
[1:06:13] heal her with TV and so forth but she
[1:06:16] had given
[1:06:17] down there is the room that night we
[1:06:19] prayed coming in Mrs wood said brother
[1:06:22] vam we'll go over and we went to her
[1:06:24] mother which was
[1:06:26] and she' had a cancer on the side of the
[1:06:28] nose and the doctor had tampered with it
[1:06:30] scattered it to just a little ring the
[1:06:32] side of her nose up just about eigh of
[1:06:34] an inch from her eye just a bone laying
[1:06:36] there done eating just as fast as it
[1:06:37] could eat away go into the room and I
[1:06:40] knelt down I said I want to speak to her
[1:06:42] alone and I go into the room to pray
[1:06:45] with the woman and while in the room I
[1:06:48] thought oh God if you just show me a
[1:06:50] vision of what's going to happen to the
[1:06:52] woman Mr Miss Wood sitting on the
[1:06:54] outside waiting to see what the Visions
[1:06:57] would say but while I was there I got
[1:07:01] condemned I was condemned by waiting for
[1:07:04] a vision seemed like something referred
[1:07:07] back wasn't the calling what you need a
[1:07:10] vision when the promis has already been
[1:07:13] said so I knelt down and prayed and my
[1:07:16] PR something just anchored on the
[1:07:20] inside the faith of the promise come
[1:07:23] back out and Mrs wood when I told her
[1:07:25] about she said did you see anything
[1:07:27] brother R I said I never exactly seen
[1:07:29] anything but I felt something that told
[1:07:32] me that his promise was true and he was
[1:07:35] going to do it and I believe that he's
[1:07:38] going to do it and less than 24 hours
[1:07:41] the end of that cancer begin to break
[1:07:44] away and a scab form over cancers don't
[1:07:46] scab as you know let it say so there was
[1:07:50] now in the woman is healed in home what
[1:07:53] a wonderful Christ by keeping eyes on
[1:07:56] the promise God said so but when we are
[1:08:00] prayed for sometimes we go off and say
[1:08:02] well it wasn't done just immediately so
[1:08:05] maybe we better go back again oh no keep
[1:08:08] your eye on the promise God said so that
[1:08:13] settles it amen that's all of it if God
[1:08:16] said so God's able to keep his promise
[1:08:18] or he never make it Abraham called those
[1:08:20] things which were not as though they
[1:08:22] were and for 25 years only
[1:08:27] impossible because he counted God was
[1:08:30] able to perform what he had
[1:08:33] promised and we are the children of
[1:08:35] Abraham by faith certainly Elijah kept
[1:08:38] his eyes on Elisha on Elijah and as he
[1:08:41] went home and after a while the chair
[1:08:44] come and parted him one to one side and
[1:08:46] the other and Panda he picked up Elijah
[1:08:51] upon he stepped on the CH and went up
[1:08:53] and put his Ro uh off his shoulders and
[1:08:57] stood back to Elijah because Elijah had
[1:09:01] grown into it you know s of sit him
[1:09:03] right and could you
[1:09:06] imagine oh I want you to give me your
[1:09:09] undivided attention as I feel my trth
[1:09:12] tickling I want to ask you something
[1:09:15] could you imagine how Elisha felt when
[1:09:19] he picked up this
[1:09:22] rob plac it upon his own shoulders
[1:09:26] oh what a
[1:09:29] feeling I don't mean this to be
[1:09:33] personal but about 10 years ago from the
[1:09:36] bullpit year I preached on a sermon
[1:09:40] David the lawyer with a swing in his
[1:09:43] hand and Glides before him in them days
[1:09:47] there were no healing campaigns on the
[1:09:49] field nowhere as we knew of and oh how
[1:09:54] critical people were on Divine Healing
[1:09:57] but there was something at meeting with
[1:09:59] a
[1:10:01] being and the pastors told me that I was
[1:10:04] losing my mind that it couldn't be so
[1:10:07] but from this same box here I spoke on
[1:10:12] David said do you mean to tell me that
[1:10:18] this the armies of the Living God will
[1:10:20] let that uncircumcised Philistine deide
[1:10:23] this Army
[1:10:26] a little old stoop shouldered curly
[1:10:29] haired boy with a sheep skinn coat on
[1:10:33] and a sling shot in his
[1:10:35] hand well the whole Army of Israel
[1:10:38] standing back up and he
[1:10:40] alone walks out with a man with a with a
[1:10:43] spear some 19 ft long and a thing on the
[1:10:48] end of it we s Shon maybe 20 lb of Steel
[1:10:52] Shen a 19t spear with fingers 14 in long
[1:10:58] and David probably weigh 90 lbs and
[1:11:01] stood bounced up and down like a little
[1:11:03] Bandy rooster and saying you mean to
[1:11:06] tell
[1:11:08] [Applause]
[1:11:09] me that you let that uncircumcised for
[1:11:14] this if he stays in his place let him
[1:11:17] stay but he's defying the armies of the
[1:11:19] Living God

[1:11:40] how much more will he deliver that
[1:11:42] uncircumcised philistin into my hand
[1:11:45] certainly and when the first victory was
[1:11:48] won and Goliath was down the whole
[1:11:52] armies of Israel follow DAV and CH head
[1:11:56] and beat Israel beat the Philistines

[1:21:36] morning is the power of the god of
[1:21:39] Elijah you might have spoke with tongues

[1:22:27] omnipotent and all powerful and if I be
[1:22:31] a servant of God I must do the works of
[1:22:33] God and if I do the works of God I must
[1:22:36] demand of God to bring these things to

[1:27:20] Christ I tore my own stuff up my own
[1:27:23] ideas my own nonsense my little petty
[1:27:28] thing I thought when I was a little
[1:27:29] badst preacher I just thought I was
[1:27:32] somebody but I tore it up I put on his
[1:27:36] robe and when I come to Jordan I want to
[1:27:38] find myself wrapped in his Rob amen
[1:27:41] you'll follow that and we'll arrive
[1:27:43] there one day so let us pray just a
[1:27:45] moment heavenly father as we're on our
[1:27:49] Jordan March this morning is
[1:27:52] conquerors some day we got to present
[1:27:55] something to the
[1:27:56] Jorden that's to
[1:27:58] death oh what a horrible thing it'll be
[1:28:01] a separation from God we can't cross
[1:28:04] over
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:08] no but Elijah when he got there he had
[1:28:12] on Elisha's Rob Elijah's Ro and when he
[1:28:17] took off the RO of the Elijah the man
[1:28:21] who had been well pleasing in your sight
[1:28:22] and you had accepted him and brought him
[1:28:24] up into heaven with you and Elisha was
[1:28:26] wearing his robe so he presented to the
[1:28:29] Jordan death the robe of
[1:28:33] Elijah and it was accepted and the
[1:28:36] Jordan opened and he walked across de
[1:28:40] God someday we got to come down we can't
[1:28:42] present our good works we have none we
[1:28:45] can't present anything in the world I
[1:28:47] don't even desire anything to try to
[1:28:49] present but I trust holy in the merits
[1:28:53] of Jesus
[1:28:55] you accepted him and raised him from the
[1:28:57] dead and he was brought into the
[1:28:59] presence of God and there will abide
[1:29:00] forever God I want to present that to
[1:29:03] you that I believe on him and I love him
[1:29:06] and by his grace he has closed us with
[1:29:08] his robe and I pray father that you'll
[1:29:10] help us now in the days of battle and
[1:29:13] where the man of God must do the work of
[1:29:15] God I pray that you'll let us take the
[1:29:18] robe of Christ the power of the Holy
[1:29:20] Spirit and call for The God Who Lived in
[1:29:23] him granted in Christ's name we ask it
[1:29:26] and while we have our head bowed I just
[1:29:28] wondering here this morning if there's a
[1:29:30] person who's trying to walk down to
