[59:51] together different departments but we
[59:53] worked together for for a while and he
[59:55] moved on to another company
[59:57] and I moved on to another company and
[1:00:00] without even you know realizing it we're
[1:00:02] now working across the street from each
[1:00:04] other so so praise the Lord so God
[1:00:07] orders the footsteps of the righteous
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] and so uh
[1:00:13] certainly uh happy to be here uh this
[1:00:16] evening
[1:00:17] uh you know I kind of was thinking that
[1:00:20] I wouldn't be able to get by and just
[1:00:21] come and visit that maybe with the youth
[1:00:23] service or something somebody uh would
[1:00:25] be uh speaking tonight but uh here I am
[1:00:28] amen
[1:00:29] and so I you know I just jotted down a
[1:00:31] few notes uh during Sunday school this
[1:00:33] morning and we'll see if the Lord will
[1:00:35] help us this evening
[1:00:37] I know everybody's Fanning but we're
[1:00:39] gonna we're gonna not let any
[1:00:41] circumstance anything hinder us tonight
[1:00:42] amen and so we'll just try to get out of
[1:00:45] the way and let God speak to us even if
[1:00:47] it's just for one person but uh amen
[1:00:50] we're I believe it was the brother last
[1:00:51] night we're not here just for one person
[1:00:53] we're not leaving anybody behind amen
[1:00:55] we're taking everybody with us amen
[1:00:57] praise the Lord as Pharaoh you know he
[1:00:59] tried to compromise with Moses and Moses
[1:01:01] said we're not leaving you know not even
[1:01:03] a hoof behind we're taking everything
[1:01:05] with us amen so no matter how far gone
[1:01:09] your children are or whatever it is
[1:01:10] you're not leaving them behind you're
[1:01:13] taking them with you Hallelujah glory to
[1:01:16] God amen amen God can conquer every
[1:01:20] circumstance amen I've seen it time and
[1:01:23] time again no matter how far in darkness
[1:01:26] in the pits of hell they are amen he can
[1:01:29] conquer Hallelujah why because he
[1:01:32] already proved it for us on that second
[1:01:35] day when uh when he died and descended
[1:01:39] into hell there he was amen the word of
[1:01:42] God In Hell hallelujah amen with every
[1:01:47] fornicating spirit with every demon
[1:01:50] Spirit there with every Spirit of lust
[1:01:52] every lesbian Spirit every homosexuals
[1:01:55] every Spirit In Hell Hallelujah and that
[1:02:00] word nature overcame right in Satan's
[1:02:05] Dominion glory to God
[1:02:07] not only did he overcome but he took his
[1:02:10] keys away from him Hallelujah and so
[1:02:13] that Mighty conqueror has descended
[1:02:16] again in this hour and is brought back
[1:02:19] to you and I the victory Hallelujah to
[1:02:23] overcome in Satan's Eden
[1:02:26] amen hallelujah praise God is that your
[1:02:30] confession tonight amen do you have the
[1:02:32] victory amen praise the Lord's soul
[1:02:36] amen it's hard to believe that it's been
[1:02:38] almost six months since the last time I
[1:02:40] was here
[1:02:41] five months or so and uh the last time I
[1:02:45] was Heroes I was on my way to Africa
[1:02:48] so brother Israel just asked me to give
[1:02:49] a few a little short testimony
[1:02:52] and I want to get into the word so I'll
[1:02:53] just make a very short make it very very
[1:02:56] brief or try to but uh you know I think
[1:02:58] I requested prayer or maybe mentioned it
[1:03:00] and uh you know your prayers as brother
[1:03:04] Adam said when you get over there and
[1:03:05] you're facing Witch Doctors you're
[1:03:07] facing all kinds of demonic Powers you
[1:03:10] know your your prayers are very much
[1:03:12] appreciated
[1:03:13] and so uh um I try to make a long story
[1:03:16] short but uh yeah I mean I mean there
[1:03:19] was just circumstance after circumstance
[1:03:21] I mean I was telling brother Israel I'll
[1:03:24] just save time not going to all the
[1:03:25] detail but it was like just every demon
[1:03:27] in hell was trying to prevent us from
[1:03:29] from going there and we had to press we
[1:03:32] had to fight we had to pray pray through
[1:03:34] fight for every battle or fight for
[1:03:36] every inch of ground but by the grace of
[1:03:38] God we made it the lord gave us several
[1:03:40] souls and we had a real tremendous
[1:03:41] tremendous time and uh again we don't go
[1:03:45] there it's not a picnic amen it's a
[1:03:46] battle and we're fighting for every inch
[1:03:48] of a ground and the Lord really really
[1:03:50] helped us I believe to speak to some of
[1:03:52] the ministers to show them a more a more
[1:03:55] perfect way in the word and just that's
[1:03:57] what we're here for Amen to encourage
[1:03:58] each other and to help each other grow
[1:04:00] and as the prophet of God I believe we
[1:04:02] can say he prophesied and said when the
[1:04:04] church finds his brother the kindness
[1:04:06] when the church finds his holy decency
[1:04:07] you know when the church in other words
[1:04:09] comes to I'll just say in my own words
[1:04:11] when the when the church finds that lost
[1:04:13] coin it'll call to its other brother and
[1:04:16] come and rejoice with us amen and again
[1:04:18] the prophet of God also said when the
[1:04:20] power of this church Rises it'll call
[1:04:21] his Brethren when the power of this
[1:04:23] church Rises it'll call his Brethren
[1:04:25] amen oh and I almost I can almost say
[1:04:28] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:04:30] hallelujah amen so we're in the hour and
[1:04:32] we're in the season that God is ordained
[1:04:35] and so again just trying to make a long
[1:04:36] story short
[1:04:38] uh we did have a real tremendous time
[1:04:39] there it was just a very short trip over
[1:04:41] Easter and then we made it back by the
[1:04:43] grace of God and so believe it on the
[1:04:45] way back we had zero trouble
[1:04:47] [Laughter]
[1:04:48] but on the way there it was very very
[1:04:50] tough extremely the most difficult trip
[1:04:53] that I've ever taken and
[1:04:55] um I'll just go ahead and say this real
[1:04:57] quick uh right before I I didn't know
[1:05:00] whether we would be able to make it or
[1:05:01] not we were stuck in in overseas and I
[1:05:04] called the brother that I was supposed
[1:05:05] to be meeting the pastor our host Pastor
[1:05:08] I said brother we're having all this
[1:05:09] trouble
[1:05:10] uh you know we're going to be late for
[1:05:13] sure to the convention we may not even
[1:05:15] make it just pray just pray
[1:05:17] and the brother really encouraged me and
[1:05:20] he as he was praying he said God's
[1:05:22] Mighty Angel is with you don't worry
[1:05:25] God's Mighty Angel is with you and so
[1:05:28] when he said that
[1:05:30] somebody kind of just struck me and I
[1:05:32] was consoled after that and there's many
[1:05:35] more things I can say along those lines
[1:05:37] but the following day the next day
[1:05:42] um again I'll just make a long story
[1:05:43] short there's many many things that
[1:05:44] could be said but right when we were
[1:05:47] there going through customs or getting
[1:05:49] ready to go through customs there was a
[1:05:51] riot broke out right in the airport a
[1:05:54] like a protest you know right in the
[1:05:57] airport and and of all this this huge
[1:05:59] airport it was right in right in front
[1:06:01] of us where we were supposed to be and
[1:06:04] so I told the brother that was with me I
[1:06:06] said just stay close to me and do
[1:06:08] exactly what I do so we just busted our
[1:06:10] way through that through the the crowd
[1:06:12] and we finally I made it through and I
[1:06:15] scanned my passport and I made it
[1:06:17] through the through the gate uh the
[1:06:19] glass door and as soon as I made it
[1:06:20] through they shut everything down and my
[1:06:24] brother was on the other side and I was
[1:06:26] on this side
[1:06:27] and so I thought I told the brother
[1:06:30] later I said nothing no offense not
[1:06:32] nothing against you but that can make a
[1:06:34] good sermon amen
[1:06:36] you were fooling around getting
[1:06:38] distracted by everything and I was had
[1:06:40] my eye on the prize I my passport was
[1:06:43] scan I made it through the gate and you
[1:06:45] were left behind
[1:06:49] amen but that's true amen you know and
[1:06:53] uh and so we get caught up in the things
[1:06:55] of the world distractions and everything
[1:06:57] else and that door is going to close
[1:06:59] amen and so but there I was I could see
[1:07:03] my brother and I said I'm not leaving
[1:07:04] without you I'm saying we're staying
[1:07:06] here and I just we stood there for like
[1:07:08] 45 minutes
[1:07:10] close they would they couldn't do
[1:07:12] anything because of the protests they
[1:07:14] didn't want any
[1:07:15] you know any trouble
[1:07:17] so I remember it it came to my mind just
[1:07:19] some little prayer or something the
[1:07:21] prophet said so I pulled off to the side
[1:07:24] I got a little bit quiet and I began
[1:07:26] praying and I remembered that brother
[1:07:27] when he said God's Mighty Angel is with
[1:07:30] you
[1:07:31] it reminded me then of course that
[1:07:33] Pillar of Fire the angel of the Lord I
[1:07:35] said God if that Mighty Angel is with us
[1:07:38] may he move through this crowd right now
[1:07:40] and quiet the people and long enough to
[1:07:44] where my brother can get through the
[1:07:46] gate and brother sister no more than
[1:07:49] just praying that within just a few
[1:07:51] minutes there was the the whole crowd
[1:07:53] just quieted
[1:07:55] and lo and behold one of the security
[1:07:57] guards which I had been talking to them
[1:07:59] for 30 45 minutes trying to get them to
[1:08:01] open the gate and they wouldn't do it
[1:08:03] and so finally the crowd hushed the one
[1:08:06] guard came he opened the gate and like
[1:08:09] four or five people uh came in my in the
[1:08:11] brother and I we went to the to go to
[1:08:13] the other part of security and then we
[1:08:16] heard on the announcement that they
[1:08:17] closed the thing for the rest of the day
[1:08:20] so praise the Lord amen God is still an
[1:08:23] on-time God Amen he can still deliver

[1:08:41] and so I had a little um dental work a
[1:08:44] few days ago so I'm gonna try not to uh
[1:08:47] be cautious of that my mouth is still a
[1:08:49] little bit sore so y'all pray for me I'm
[1:08:52] just going to try to take my time
[1:08:54] and um
[1:08:55] but I do remember the last time I was
[1:08:57] here
[1:08:59] brother Israel which I I really
[1:09:01] appreciated it but brother Israel
[1:09:04] I believe was encouraging the musicians
[1:09:07] the songwriters the musicians and so
[1:09:09] forth to get into some inspiration a
[1:09:13] current inspiration right inspiration
[1:09:15] from the message right to to to start
[1:09:17] singing some songs and and bringing
[1:09:19] forth some songs from the message amen
[1:09:21] how many has accomplished that that that
[1:09:24] task one
[1:09:26] praise the Lord all right so I said Amen
[1:09:29] to that because that's where I'm at I
[1:09:31] mean the inspiration of this message I
[1:09:33] live it breathe it sleep it eat it every
[1:09:35] day
[1:09:36] and so to me now no offense but this is
[1:09:39] just your brother here encouraging you a
[1:09:41] little bit and backing up the pastor but
[1:09:44] to me if we say we believe the message
[1:09:47] and we're in the inspiration of the
[1:09:48] message
[1:09:49] but the songs that we listen to the
[1:09:51] songs that we sing don't don't denote
[1:09:54] that something is wrong amen
[1:09:56] something is wrong and so we picked up a
[1:09:58] religious spirit or some something or
[1:10:01] another but we should be in
[1:10:03] uh the message Amen in the word in the
[1:10:06] inspiration of the word and if I could
[1:10:07] sing I was I would sing you these songs
[1:10:09] but um
[1:10:10] uh just to save time you know
[1:10:12] everybody's everybody's Fanning and
[1:10:14] stuff but um
[1:10:15] let me just go ahead and read this one
[1:10:17] song and if anybody maybe you've already
[1:10:19] heard it if not uh you know I can get
[1:10:22] you the the links or whatever and we'll
[1:10:24] bring the pastor's Vision to pass amen
[1:10:27] would that will that work you all know
[1:10:29] where I'm looking in this direction
[1:10:31] just like this morning everybody knows
[1:10:34] who the preachers were that weren't
[1:10:35] raising their hands all right everybody
[1:10:37] knows who the musicians are and who The
[1:10:39] Talented singers are in the church but
[1:10:42] this is uh from a particular group that
[1:10:44] has done a lot of inspiration a lot of
[1:10:46] singing uh concerning the the message
[1:10:50] excuse me in this particular song Here
[1:10:52] is called the spirit and the bride
[1:10:54] and it says we have come from a part to
[1:10:57] a full realization of Who We Are
[1:11:00] we are the bride the mystery of Christ

[1:12:00] spirit and the bride and we say come
[1:12:02] amen is that your testimony amen did you
[1:12:05] feel the faith a man punctuating that is
[1:12:08] that right so it's something amen and if
[1:12:09] you look back through history every
[1:12:11] Revival produce another hymn book amen
[1:12:14] and so it shouldn't be any any exception
[1:12:16] today is that right
[1:12:18] amen so I can go on and on amen and so
[1:12:21] the the when you have songs that are
[1:12:23] inspired amen just like oh you know I'll
[1:12:26] say this to me Christian music is not
[1:12:29] just songs about Jesus or songs about
[1:12:31] God or the Bible I mean it's Holy Ghost
[1:12:34] inspired music amen that's to me what
[1:12:38] Christian music is amen
[1:12:40] praise the Lord
[1:12:41] so God richly bless you and again we'll
[1:12:44] give these to you free of charge amen
[1:12:47] praise the Lord and so pray for the my
[1:12:49] little family we're trying to work on
[1:12:50] singing a few of these but um
[1:12:53] amen I believe that's
[1:12:55] I believe that would be it amen so let's
[1:12:58] stand to our feet for a word of Prayer
[1:13:04] and while we're getting ready to go to
[1:13:07] the Lord in prayer you can turn to
[1:13:13] will turn to
[1:13:15] let's turn to three places quickly wrote
[1:13:17] real quick scriptures we'll just go
[1:13:19] ahead and read and then we'll um we'll
[1:13:21] pray afterwards Olivia Leviticus 14
[1:13:23] quickly
[1:13:24] Leviticus 14 7 one scripture here
[1:13:28] again I'm just trying to save time
[1:13:31] some other brother said I got about four
[1:13:33] or five hours tonight so we'll be good
[1:13:36] the brother's kidding me about my time I
[1:13:38] get the last laugh you know so
[1:13:40] [Laughter]
[1:13:42] amen Leviticus 14 7.
[1:13:46] praise the Lord
[1:13:47] and so this is a very special I don't
[1:13:49] have again time to go into all of it but
[1:13:51] Leviticus 14 7 obviously this is the Old
[1:13:53] Testament law this was the for the
[1:13:56] atonement for the cleansing of a leper
[1:13:57] it was the the Old Testament type of the
[1:14:00] two doves taking the one dove the male
[1:14:02] uh cutting its head off and draining the
[1:14:05] blood onto the female the living bird
[1:14:07] and that was an atonement for cleansing
[1:14:09] of leprosy and also for the cleansing of
[1:14:12] the home amen so the token as the
[1:14:14] prophet of God tells us is not it's for
[1:14:16] us but it's for our home amen hallelujah
[1:14:19] and so this is a wonderful type here and
[1:14:22] we'll just read verse seven and this is
[1:14:24] referring to the blood from the the male
[1:14:29] onto the female and from the female on
[1:14:33] to the person with Leprosy and leprosy
[1:14:36] is a type of sin amen so the
[1:14:39] manifestation of the blood speaking made
[1:14:43] this person completely clean from sin
[1:14:47] Hallelujah yeah
[1:14:49] and he shall sprinkle again he's
[1:14:51] speaking concerning the priest amen so
[1:14:54] this is the the priest an ordained
[1:14:56] priest would have the commission and
[1:14:59] know-how to accomplish this amen
[1:15:02] Glory Hallelujah so Leviticus 14 7 and
[1:15:06] he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be
[1:15:09] cleansed from the leprosy seven times
[1:15:13] Amen to him that is to be cleansed amen
[1:15:16] not him that doesn't want to be cleansed
[1:15:19] is that right so he comes before the
[1:15:20] priest to be cleansed and he shall
[1:15:22] sprinkle upon him that he should be
[1:15:24] cleansed from leprosy seven times and
[1:15:26] shall pronounce him clean and shall let
[1:15:30] the living bird loose into the open
[1:15:33] field Hallelujah
[1:15:36] Amen in Revelations 19 verse 7 and 8.
[1:15:39] amen this this person with with the
[1:15:41] leprosy which is a type of sin
[1:15:44] amen it was a sin unto uh leprosy was a
[1:15:47] disease unto death and so is sin and but
[1:15:50] this Old Testament type pronounced
[1:15:53] healing and made the person clean
[1:15:57] free from sin by the seven Stripes of
[1:16:01] blood from the dead maid amen
[1:16:04] Glory Hallelujah so in other words I
[1:16:06] brought him into a perfect state of
[1:16:08] cleansiness cleanliness and perfect
[1:16:10] state of wholeness amen all right
[1:16:13] relation 19 7 verse seven and eight very
[1:16:15] familiar scripture
[1:16:17] Glory hallelujah amen let us be glad and
[1:16:22] rejoice
[1:16:24] glory and give honor to him
[1:16:28] for the marriage of the Lamb is come and
[1:16:32] his wife hath made herself ready
[1:16:36] and to her was granted that she should
[1:16:39] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:16:44] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:16:48] of the Saints amen let's bow our heads
[1:16:51] for what a prayer our heavenly father
[1:16:54] Lord thank you so much for your mercy
[1:16:56] Lord we have read your word may take
[1:16:57] control of the service father may your
[1:16:59] people Lord be attentive to your word
[1:17:01] may they punctuate every word of God
[1:17:03] with an amen father made an atmosphere
[1:17:05] be created Lord that you can Lord bring
[1:17:07] Deliverance Lord that you can speak to
[1:17:09] your people that you could call their
[1:17:11] name when the decade arise to the
[1:17:13] occasion father in Jesus name we pray
[1:17:16] amen and amen you may be seated I'll
[1:17:18] read this last
[1:17:20] uh scripture just as you're seating
[1:17:22] being seated
[1:17:24] a Virgin Mary scripture
[1:17:26] and I won't read the whole thing
[1:17:30] again Matthew 25 this is the parable of
[1:17:32] the foolish virgin the wise and foolish
[1:17:34] virgin they both heard the same cry they
[1:17:36] both came out in other words they both
[1:17:38] came out of denominationalism they both
[1:17:40] came out to go and meet the bridegroom
[1:17:42] is that right
[1:17:46] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:17:48] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:17:50] to me in verse 6 then all those virgins
[1:17:52] arose and trim their lamps and the
[1:17:55] foolish enter to the wise give us of
[1:17:56] your oil for our lamps have gone out but
[1:17:59] the wise answers saying not so unless
[1:18:01] they're not unless they're being not
[1:18:03] enough for us and you but go rather to
[1:18:05] them that sell and buy for yourselves
[1:18:08] and while they went to buy the
[1:18:11] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[1:18:15] somebody say ready they that were ready
[1:18:20] went in with him in the marriage and the
[1:18:24] door was shut amen and so I used to
[1:18:27] think you know sometimes just in my mind
[1:18:28] that the difference you know I'm not I'm
[1:18:30] looking to preach on the wise and
[1:18:32] foolish virgin but the I used to think
[1:18:34] just kind of commonly that the
[1:18:35] difference between the wise and foolish
[1:18:37] is that the foolish didn't understand or
[1:18:41] they didn't know the way to the marriage
[1:18:43] but the wise did but here we can see
[1:18:46] that eventually the unwise the foolish
[1:18:50] virgins eventually found their way to
[1:18:52] the marriage but it was too late and so
[1:18:54] I think maybe that's why the prophet of
[1:18:56] God often times referred to the foolish
[1:19:00] virgin as being dilatory right being
[1:19:03] slothful being like not diligent is that
[1:19:06] right just oh it'll be okay or oh you
[1:19:08] know I'm in the message I believe God's
[1:19:10] been a prophet or oh you know it's okay
[1:19:12] you know dilatory I mean not concerned
[1:19:16] in other words you haven't been awakened
[1:19:18] you haven't been alerted to the hour and
[1:19:22] season that we are in and we are in the
[1:19:26] battle of the coming of the Lord amen
[1:19:29] how many has been called to that battle
[1:19:31] amen the prophet God says home life
[1:19:33] broke up all these kind of things taking
[1:19:35] place I mean heartache disease sickness
[1:19:38] everything oh hell is coming against
[1:19:41] this bride against this true truth
[1:19:44] because why we are in the battle of the
[1:19:48] coming of the Lord
[1:19:50] and in every age when it's still open
[1:19:53] the messenger caught the age and he
[1:19:55] pronounced it what did that do to it
[1:19:57] created spiritual war is that right and
[1:20:01] so in this hour when the mystery of the
[1:20:03] coming of the Lord has been and is being
[1:20:06] revealed
[1:20:08] it creates War amen
[1:20:11] praise the Lord I said it has been and
[1:20:13] is being because we're catching the
[1:20:14] mystery amen just like as brother uh uh
[1:20:18] brother uh Israel said this morning amen
[1:20:20] it was finished what was once prophecy
[1:20:22] is now history but we're we're still
[1:20:25] catching up amen
[1:20:27] praise the Lord and so
[1:20:29] for a little title this morning or this
[1:20:32] evening if I can speak a little simple
[1:20:33] title that the lord gave me on the trail
[1:20:36] to the marriage
[1:20:38] the trail to the marriage and then for a
[1:20:41] subject if we can speak on from the
[1:20:44] temporal to the original
[1:20:46] and so we're going to try to hurry
[1:20:47] through this not hurry but uh you know
[1:20:50] trying to get through as much as we can
[1:20:51] and this is just a just a small small
[1:20:53] glimpse of it I say this very very
[1:20:55] humbly
[1:20:56] but I really appreciate what brother
[1:20:58] Israel was going through this morning
[1:21:00] and is we're writing the same channel on
[1:21:02] many many things
[1:21:03] and uh you know I don't don't really
[1:21:06] make statements like this or the prophet
[1:21:07] made a few statements like this I'll go
[1:21:09] ahead and say it but you know by the
[1:21:10] grace of God
[1:21:11] you know uh the Lord has been good to me
[1:21:14] and he's and I have just tremendous
[1:21:17] tremendous he's given me about 30 40 50
[1:21:21] sermons just in the past few months of
[1:21:23] inspiration right in the lines of the
[1:21:25] third pool and all of these things that
[1:21:27] we've been talking that brother Israel
[1:21:28] was talking about this morning and so
[1:21:30] I'm going to do the best I can with the
[1:21:32] help of the Lord to just Express a few
[1:21:34] of those right so I can't I can't speak
[1:21:36] everything but um some of it would take
[1:21:39] months and months and months of
[1:21:40] background and so on and so forth
[1:21:43] um but you know we're on a trail amen
[1:21:45] we're not called to just uh just to be
[1:21:47] here right we're not called to just warm
[1:21:50] up you to be religious to sing songs and
[1:21:54] which all that is is great right but
[1:21:56] we're we're called for a purpose amen
[1:21:58] and so here if we look at Matthew 25
[1:22:01] real quick you know again both groups
[1:22:04] the wise and the foolish both heard the
[1:22:06] same voice the same cry saying go behold
[1:22:10] the bridegroom come in just go you out
[1:22:13] to meet him is that right and the
[1:22:15] prophet of God
[1:22:16] identified that with the shout amen the
[1:22:21] shout of first Thessalonians 4 the shout
[1:22:24] and the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:22:27] heaven with the shout the voice of the
[1:22:29] Archangel and the Trump of God is that
[1:22:31] right so that is the coming of the Lord
[1:22:34] amen and we found out that the second
[1:22:36] coming much like the first coming is not
[1:22:39] an instantaneous event in time amen the
[1:22:43] first coming was what it took place over
[1:22:45] a 33-year period and it was scripture
[1:22:48] upon scripture upon scripture upon
[1:22:50] scripture being identified and the next
[1:22:53] thing you know the first coming was
[1:22:55] fulfilled amen and so is it today
[1:22:58] Amen in this hour that we are living in
[1:23:00] so again the prophet of God uh
[1:23:02] identified that the Midnight Cry behold
[1:23:05] the bridegroom cometh with the shall of
[1:23:08] first Thessalonians 4. amen amen y'all
[1:23:11] still with me amen y'all still thank God
[1:23:14] and want to worship God in you know
[1:23:17] thank him for his word amen praise the
[1:23:19] Lord
[1:23:20] amen and so with that being said that
[1:23:23] that that if we can just narrow that
[1:23:25] down then that would give us to
[1:23:27] understand that both groups
[1:23:30] heard the men I cry behold the
[1:23:34] bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him
[1:23:36] amen both groups are rose trim their
[1:23:40] lamps and went out to meet the word of
[1:23:44] God being unveiled in this hour amen
[1:23:47] right
[1:23:48] all right so there was a trail amen
[1:23:51] there was a trail that the wise had to
[1:23:54] had to recognize and walk on that trail
[1:23:57] because it was leading to air the
[1:24:00] marriage amen and I don't have time to
[1:24:02] go I mean back into the the Orient the
[1:24:04] old custom how that would take place
[1:24:06] behold the bridegroom cometh meaning the
[1:24:08] riot and his party is coming to join the
[1:24:11] bridegroom and her party to go into the
[1:24:14] marriage amen so there was a trail that
[1:24:16] they had to go on to find the bridegroom
[1:24:18] and to go into the marriage is that
[1:24:20] right
[1:24:21] amen
[1:24:25] and so as I mentioned I used to just
[1:24:27] kind of think that
[1:24:28] though the unwise they didn't know the
[1:24:30] trail but here we see that they
[1:24:32] eventually found the trail but it was
[1:24:34] too late
[1:24:37] all right now let's just
[1:24:38] keep going on Amen so the prophet of God
[1:24:40] says here in the message why Christ
[1:24:42] speak not only me I pray for I pray for
[1:24:45] you also
[1:24:47] that together as a body of Christ called
[1:24:51] out from the world making ready for the
[1:24:56] promised land that God will give me
[1:24:59] courage to speak the way
[1:25:02] amen so God I mean he's telling us that
[1:25:05] we have been called out from the world
[1:25:07] how many has been called out from the
[1:25:09] world Amen what is the world the lust of
[1:25:11] the eye the lust of the Flesh and the
[1:25:13] pride of life amen all these all of
[1:25:15] these things the glamor of Hollywood all
[1:25:17] these things that's being projected to
[1:25:19] us each and every day through school
[1:25:22] through work through everything out
[1:25:24] there that is of the world the lust of
[1:25:26] the eye the lust of the Flesh and the
[1:25:28] pride of life is not of the father but
[1:25:30] is of the world and he that is a part of
[1:25:33] the world will pass away with the world
[1:25:34] but he that doeth the will of God
[1:25:36] abideth forever amen and so we've been
[1:25:39] called out of the world called out of
[1:25:42] denominationalism doing what making
[1:25:44] ready for the promised land and now the
[1:25:47] prophet of God says here now God give me
[1:25:50] courage to speak the way so he's telling
[1:25:54] you we've been called out making ready
[1:25:56] for the promised land and I've got to
[1:25:58] speak the way Hallelujah in other words
[1:26:01] it's being laid out for us amen and that
[1:26:04] is the under the prophet's third pool
[1:26:07] amen and the third pool is a thing that
[1:26:10] he did not explain is that right the
[1:26:12] angel told him in so many words that
[1:26:15] this is for the rainbow trout amen
[1:26:17] because remember he was fishing I don't
[1:26:19] have time to go into it but the whole
[1:26:21] intent of him fishing was not just to
[1:26:24] have uh somebody arguing about a vision
[1:26:26] or anything like that but the whole
[1:26:27] intent was for him to catch the rainbow
[1:26:30] trout that was in the deep end of the
[1:26:33] pool so the third pool is for the
[1:26:36] rainbow trout
[1:26:38] and so that's why the prophet of God
[1:26:39] said that in so many words he says uh
[1:26:42] that the third pool will be to him that
[1:26:45] has wisdom
[1:26:46] amen he didn't explain it but he
[1:26:49] prophesied it it's on the books and
[1:26:51] tapes and it's hidden waiting for the
[1:26:53] time for it to be revealed to the
[1:26:56] predestinated Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:58] that have need to find the trail
[1:27:00] Hallelujah they have needs to connect to
[1:27:03] that word and manifest that which the
[1:27:06] prophet has spoken Hallelujah
[1:27:10] amen that God will give me courage to
[1:27:12] speak the way make the way clear so you
[1:27:16] won't miss the trail hallelujah oh glory
[1:27:20] to God thank God for that clear sounding
[1:27:22] voice that has made the way clear so we
[1:27:25] don't miss the trail I mean I know
[1:27:28] sometimes preachers will put weeds in
[1:27:30] the way they'll they'll make stupid
[1:27:31] statements like you know
[1:27:33] if I had the Bible if I had the message
[1:27:36] you know which one would I choose that's
[1:27:38] that's just some kind of a psychological
[1:27:40] attack of the enemy to put Weeds on the
[1:27:43] trail amen
[1:27:45] but God has already spoken the trail the
[1:27:48] way and we must cast off reasoning cast
[1:27:51] off everything which would exalt itself
[1:27:54] against this way Hallelujah
[1:27:57] Glory
[1:27:59] amen give me courage you're speaking to
[1:28:01] make the way clear so you won't miss the
[1:28:04] trail hallelujah amen somebody say God
[1:28:06] help me not to miss the trail this is
[1:28:09] between life and death This is between
[1:28:12] the tribulation period And The Rapture

[1:28:29] follow the bloody Footprints of him who
[1:28:31] went on before us amen
[1:28:35] Glory
[1:28:36] so let me just try to calm down and
[1:28:38] teach a little bit
[1:28:39] but the prophet says again speaking of
[1:28:41] the marriage let's just drill into this
[1:28:43] a little bit
[1:28:46] and I trust something will be said that
[1:28:48] will help you

[1:29:42] church that's you and I Amen to join us
[1:29:45] to the Head not in in some kind of
[1:29:49] imaginary thing but in a reality form to

[1:30:04] I'll just give you a spoiler alert the
[1:30:06] the the marriage takes place here the
[1:30:09] mayor the Rapture is going to the
[1:30:12] wedding supper amen so we're on a trail
[1:30:15] to the marriage and we're to be United
[1:30:17] here with our bridegroom with the head
[1:30:21] Hallelujah and the prophet of God said
[1:30:23] that the bride will be a super Church a
[1:30:25] super race as she nears The Headstone
[1:30:29] that's prophecy I mean where are you at
[1:30:31] in the picture amen where are you at in
[1:30:33] the vision are you on the trail are you

[1:30:39] distracted by something out there in the
[1:30:40] world

[1:30:45] Gloria he did the bride will be a super
[1:30:47] racist super church as she nears The
[1:30:49] Headstone so the prophet of God is
[1:30:51] saying here the son of man will be
[1:30:53] revealed what to join the church to the
[1:30:55] Head unite the marriage of the Bride
[1:30:58] then he says the bridegroom call will
[1:31:00] come right through this
[1:31:04] when the son of manner will be when the
[1:31:06] son of man will come down and come in
[1:31:08] human flesh to unite the two together
[1:31:12] the church has to be the word I mean the
[1:31:17] word not some word or part word you know
[1:31:20] and that's the devil tries to get you to
[1:31:21] compromise in your mind saying oh well
[1:31:24] you could just be a little bit of the
[1:31:25] word or you can believe this you can
[1:31:27] believe that but where all the word
[1:31:30] no sin no darkness no no unbelief all
[1:31:36] the word 100
[1:31:38] the word no darkness no sin no unbelief

[1:31:53] Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:55] amen but we're coming to that we must be
[1:31:58] cleansed just like the man with Leprosy
[1:32:01] there cleansed and made perfectly whole
[1:32:04] in other words come to a perfect state
[1:32:07] all right let me try to hurry up here
[1:32:09] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:32:10] through this when the son of man will
[1:32:11] come down and come in human flesh to
[1:32:14] unite the two together the church has to
[1:32:16] be the word he is the word and the two
[1:32:18] unites together and to do that it'll
[1:32:20] take the manifestation of the revealing
[1:32:22] of the son of man not a clergy man do
[1:32:24] you see what I mean he says Jesus Christ
[1:32:27] will come down in flesh Among Us and
[1:32:29] will make his word so real that it'll
[1:32:32] unite the church in him as one amen the
[1:32:36] bride and then she'll go home to the
[1:32:39] wedding supper amen all right amen she's
[1:32:42] already united we go to the marriage
[1:32:45] supper I'm just going to skip this he
[1:32:46] says because the marriage of the Lamb
[1:32:48] has come but the Rapture is going to the
[1:32:50] wedding supper when the word here unites
[1:32:53] with the person that's you the word must
[1:32:58] Unite with you in other words the word
[1:33:00] must be revealing itself to you not the
[1:33:05] word amen your name being cold amen the
[1:33:08] word the identification of the word of
[1:33:10] which you are must be being revealed to
[1:33:13] you
[1:33:15] amen not the pastor's word not the word
[1:33:17] for some other day not brother Brandon
[1:33:18] was where not our Lord Jesus's word but
[1:33:20] the word spoken of you for this hour
[1:33:22] must become you you must Unite with him
[1:33:27] amen
[1:33:30] glory and and when the the word unites
[1:33:33] with the person and they too become one
[1:33:35] and then what does it do then it
[1:33:36] manifests the son of man again not the
[1:33:39] church theologians the son of man the
[1:33:41] word and the church becomes one whatever
[1:33:43] the son of man done he was the word
[1:33:47] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:33:48] word the church does the same thing amen
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:55] praise the Lord so let's
[1:33:58] try to teach this a little bit
[1:34:01] amen and so when we speak on the
[1:34:03] marriage
[1:34:04] usually I'm just going to touch on three
[1:34:06] things tonight
[1:34:08] there's a you know a lot of different
[1:34:10] things that we could say but usually in
[1:34:13] a marriage
[1:34:15] you need at least three things
[1:34:17] I know there's more but you need at
[1:34:18] least a wedding band right
[1:34:21] right so the the bridegroom slips the
[1:34:24] slips the
[1:34:25] the ring on the on the finger is that
[1:34:27] right
[1:34:28] and then you need a marriage certificate
[1:34:31] but most importantly you need the
[1:34:33] wedding garment as well you know in this
[1:34:35] situation
[1:34:36] so we'll just speak on the these three
[1:34:37] things real quick turn out to take too
[1:34:39] long
[1:34:40] but uh again the wedding band we can say
[1:34:43] this we can say a lot about this but
[1:34:44] brother bam says here in the message of
[1:34:46] the invisible Union
[1:34:47] of the bride of Christ if you can pull
[1:34:49] that up
[1:34:56] and so brother bam says hallelujah now
[1:34:58] notice you're not only that but you're
[1:35:01] going to the wedding in the sky and you
[1:35:04] are wearing the wedding band of
[1:35:06] predestinated unmerited Grace
[1:35:10] a wedding band of Grace unmerited of
[1:35:13] your own Brothers give me a little bit
[1:35:15] more on the monitor please
[1:35:16] he says and you are wearing the wedding
[1:35:19] band of predestinated
[1:35:21] unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace
[1:35:26] unmerited of your own amen you didn't do
[1:35:29] anything to deserve it you don't even
[1:35:31] know anything about this word you didn't
[1:35:34] know anything about the message of the
[1:35:35] hour God did this on his own amen he
[1:35:40] slipped it on you God did it himself
[1:35:43] he knew you
[1:35:45] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:35:49] so this he slipped let me just read so
[1:35:52] he slipped the wedding band on you there
[1:35:54] put your name on a book what are things
[1:35:57] given hallelujah praise God Amen he put
[1:36:00] it on you there he knew you before you
[1:36:03] even were on the earth and he put the
[1:36:06] wedding band of unmerited Grace amen
[1:36:10] when you were in the ball bar room when
[1:36:12] you were on drugs when you were on the
[1:36:14] street when you were doing crooked
[1:36:16] business deals God's unmerited grace was
[1:36:19] with you amen and he put that wedding
[1:36:22] band upon you he already said your mind
[1:36:26] whether you like it or not you may not
[1:36:29] even know it yet but I have chosen you
[1:36:31] glory to God Amen think about that amen
[1:36:35] he put it on you that seal and man that
[1:36:38] basically says you're as good as mine
[1:36:40] amen when a man that's an honorable man
[1:36:43] approaches an honorable lady and they
[1:36:45] and they Exchange rings or vows or some
[1:36:47] little promise ring amen that is as good
[1:36:50] as done amen and so God did this to you

[1:36:55] foundation of the world
[1:36:58] glory to God Amen put your name on a
[1:37:01] book

[1:37:16] unmerited Grace nothing of your self
[1:37:18] that you ever did he foreknew you before
[1:37:22] the foundation of the world and knew

[1:37:30] university in in at the job in the
[1:37:32] office out there on the street he knew
[1:37:35] what stand you would take and he

[1:38:18] invisible Union
[1:38:23] my brother says here now your name is
[1:38:25] now in the new book
[1:38:28] not the book of life but the Lamb's Book
[1:38:31] of Life
[1:38:32] what the lamb redeemed
[1:38:36] not the old book of your natural Union
[1:38:38] in other words the old book that that
[1:38:40] came into fruition by the natural Union
[1:38:42] of your mother and father amen that was
[1:38:45] your old identity that was the old you
[1:38:47] that has nothing to do with you all of
[1:38:50] your complexes all of your fears all of
[1:38:52] your temperamental ways your your lust
[1:38:54] for away all of that that you inherited
[1:38:57] from that Old Nature has nothing to do
[1:39:00] with you
[1:39:02] Glory hallelujah amen that is your own
[1:39:05] nature from the old book but he
[1:39:07] predestinated You by unmerited favor and
[1:39:10] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:13] not your natural life but the Lamb's
[1:39:16] Book of Life in other words your name
[1:39:18] was written in the life of the Lamb
[1:39:23] glory to God now think about that that
[1:39:26] creative blood cell of Jehovah glory to
[1:39:30] God that one blood cell that was formed
[1:39:33] in the womb of the Virgin Mary that one
[1:39:36] blood cell glory to God that conquered
[1:39:38] every that conquered every pitch of hell
[1:39:41] I mean that one blood cell your name
[1:39:45] glory to God every bride member was in
[1:39:50] that one creative blood cell
[1:39:53] holy holy holy without sin without
[1:39:57] blemish the life of almighty God the
[1:40:02] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:03] your name was there there's a thousand
[1:40:06] quotes I can read but I'll go on
[1:40:08] amen
[1:40:09] that is your marriage certificate now I
[1:40:12] don't know about y'all but when I got
[1:40:14] married I had a marriage certificate
[1:40:16] amen how many had your marriage
[1:40:18] certificate
[1:40:19] amen so in other words it was a
[1:40:21] possession it wasn't just some imaginary
[1:40:23] something amen it was an actual
[1:40:26] possession this me and me and me and my
[1:40:29] wife right there our names right there
[1:40:30] we're married amen
[1:40:32] okay and so this is what the prophet
[1:40:35] says not the old book of your natural
[1:40:37] Union but your new bride Hallelujah your
[1:40:41] new life
[1:40:42] is an elantric of Life your marriage
[1:40:46] certificate Hallelujah where your true
[1:40:49] Eternal germ from the beginning takes
[1:40:51] hold
[1:40:52] now you're not only forgiven but you're
[1:40:55] Justified so the marriage certificate is
[1:40:59] your true Eternal germ from the
[1:41:02] beginning glory to God before sin every
[1:41:04] internet before Satan was ever even
[1:41:07] created
[1:41:08] your marriage certificate was in the
[1:41:12] Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah
[1:41:14] amen so these things must become a
[1:41:17] reality to you an identification to you
[1:41:20] so that you can have faith to overcome
[1:41:23] in this hour amen
[1:41:25] amen these are my notes now he has come
[1:41:27] down from eternity with your original
[1:41:30] name from the lamb Book of Life your
[1:41:33] marriage certificate
[1:41:35] amen is that right
[1:41:37] and so let me just say something to my
[1:41:39] stumble you a little bit but amen we
[1:41:41] know that the Bible says your name or
[1:41:43] the the Overcomers that won't worship
[1:41:45] the Beast all these things their names
[1:41:46] were written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:41:48] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:41:50] amen but if you're a predestinated
[1:41:52] Believer your name is not written
[1:41:55] anymore in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:41:57] okay now think about that
[1:42:00] amen it's not just written anymore it is
[1:42:03] being revealed amen it's being revealed
[1:42:07] it's being declared is that right amen
[1:42:10] because if we look at the cloud there if
[1:42:11] you can turn the uh put the picture up
[1:42:13] of the cloud
[1:42:15] hey man so so this is what we must do we
[1:42:17] must move excuse me your name was no
[1:42:21] longer in the and your name was no
[1:42:22] longer just written amen by now it's
[1:42:25] being revealed and so you must move from
[1:42:28] that identification of your name being
[1:42:30] written to your name being revealed is
[1:42:33] that right
[1:42:34] amen because your name was written in
[1:42:36] the Lamb's Book of Life the life of the
[1:42:39] blood of the Lamb is that right and so
[1:42:41] when that blood speaks what is it
[1:42:44] speaking
[1:42:45] it's speaking better things amen and
[1:42:48] speaking better things for you than your
[1:42:50] old life is that right
[1:42:52] excuse me
[1:42:54] amen I'll say it like this you know we
[1:42:56] know that that book
[1:42:58] that Adam had contained all the names of
[1:43:01] the Sons and Daughters of God that was
[1:43:02] to be created is that right amen and
[1:43:05] brother Brandon called that the Book of
[1:43:06] Life the book of redemption the title
[1:43:08] deed all of these things is that right
[1:43:10] and it was sealed by Seven Seals why
[1:43:13] because man had fallen is that right man
[1:43:16] had fallen and failed to speak those
[1:43:19] names is that right he failed to speak
[1:43:22] those names so we went back to the hand
[1:43:25] of the original owner waiting for
[1:43:28] Redemptive claims is that right and the
[1:43:30] prophet of God calls this Bible The Book
[1:43:33] of Life the Lamb's Book of Life the book
[1:43:34] of redemption in other words that book
[1:43:36] was hidden inside this book is that
[1:43:39] right it man sealed by Seven Seals
[1:43:42] waiting for Redemptive claims and then
[1:43:45] in this hour I'll just speed up but in
[1:43:47] this hour we can remember in in in
[1:43:49] Revelations 5 the lamb was in the hand
[1:43:53] of the original owner sealed with Seven
[1:43:55] Seals John wept because no man in heaven
[1:43:59] or an Earth was worthy to take the book
[1:44:01] is that right but there came one an
[1:44:03] angel with a strong voice said weep not
[1:44:05] John for Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:44:07] Judah hath prevailed and is worthy to
[1:44:09] take the book is that right and so John
[1:44:12] wasn't worthy nobody was worthy and but
[1:44:14] the book was open is that right and then
[1:44:17] in Revelations 10 the one who was just
[1:44:19] unworthy was now commanded by the angel
[1:44:22] to go and take the book is that right
[1:44:25] and the prophet of God said whenever
[1:44:28] John got happy and got next to himself
[1:44:30] he must have seen his name there amen so
[1:44:34] if John represents the bride and when
[1:44:36] the Lamb's Book of Life was open the
[1:44:39] book of redemption your title deed to
[1:44:42] your inheritance of this Earth was open
[1:44:45] John recognized his place in the word
[1:44:49] John recognized his marriage certificate
[1:44:52] John recognized his new name being
[1:44:55] revealed from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:44:58] Glory Hallelujah he must have looked
[1:45:02] beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:45:03] there's John amen there's John and when
[1:45:07] this happened they recognized that God
[1:45:09] had made them Kings and Priests
[1:45:13] and they sang not an old song but they
[1:45:15] sang a new song
[1:45:17] Glory Hallelujah and only those that
[1:45:20] have recognized their name being
[1:45:22] revealed can sing that song
[1:45:25] Hallelujah and so your name was just
[1:45:29] simply written but now because the
[1:45:31] mighty one the lion of the tribal Judah
[1:45:33] has come and has opened the seals and
[1:45:37] within that Revelation is your identity
[1:45:40] from the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:45:43] Glory Hallelujah
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:48] Glory Hallelujah This is Gospel right
[1:45:50] amen praise the Lord
[1:45:53] so that is your identity your marriage
[1:45:56] certificate amen your name there being
[1:45:59] written amen as brother Pam said it's
[1:46:01] not you know saying Ormond Neville Lee
[1:46:03] Veil but it's the mystery revealed while
[1:46:05] it's what calling those names
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:12] so the mystery of the word being
[1:46:14] revealed while it's calling those names
[1:46:16] what is it calling you for to receive
[1:46:18] that which has been opened
[1:46:21] Glory Hallelujah
[1:46:24] all right y'all still with me still on
[1:46:27] the trail
[1:46:28] I think we lost about half of you
[1:46:30] we'll keep going though amen
[1:46:32] praise the Lord
[1:46:35] all right
[1:46:37] let's keep going amen the wedding
[1:46:39] garment we won't speak I have a lot of
[1:46:41] notes on this but we'll try to brush it
[1:46:43] up a little bit but
[1:46:45] can y'all handle a little bit more yeah
[1:46:48] amen well last time I was here brother
[1:46:50] Israel I think made some kind of
[1:46:52] statement like we believe the message
[1:46:54] whatever the prophet said we believe it
[1:46:56] amen we may not understand it or
[1:46:58] something of that nature but we believe
[1:47:00] it and we want to receive it amen
[1:47:03] and so
[1:47:06] let me uh speak on the wedding garment
[1:47:09] for a few minutes
[1:47:10] amen because we know the scripture says
[1:47:12] the word bride has made herself ready
[1:47:14] and to her as Grant and that she should
[1:47:16] be arrayed in white Landing clean and
[1:47:17] white for the for the white linen is the
[1:47:20] righteousness of the Saints amen
[1:47:24] praise the Lord
[1:47:27] and so these are my notes right here
[1:47:30] and we'll see if this stumbles you but I
[1:47:32] wrote down right here the wedding
[1:47:33] garment is not the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:36] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost itself
[1:47:39] amen
[1:47:41] all right
[1:47:42] so brother Adam says here in the message
[1:47:44] things that are to be
[1:47:46] and I'm trying to go somewhere so just
[1:47:48] bear with me
[1:47:49] amen
[1:47:52] all right praise the Lord so brother
[1:47:54] upstairs here I got the baptism of the
[1:47:56] holy spirit that still has nothing to do
[1:47:58] with it that's only a temporary or
[1:48:01] temporal gift for you amen that's only a
[1:48:04] temporary gift for you in another place
[1:48:06] I don't have all the quotes but he said
[1:48:07] the Holy Spirit can baptize you and
[1:48:10] anoint you and on the inside of you
[1:48:12] there's still a devil
[1:48:14] all right that's how in the Pentecostal
[1:48:16] age they can commit adultery speaking
[1:48:18] tongues preach the gospel all these
[1:48:19] things and function by the Holy Ghost
[1:48:21] because they were baptized with the Holy
[1:48:23] Spirit but on their soul they were still
[1:48:26] a devil they weren't baptized in their
[1:48:28] soul amen
[1:48:30] so brother says here I got the baptism
[1:48:32] of the holy spirit that still has
[1:48:33] nothing to do with it
[1:48:36] that's only a temporary temporal gift
[1:48:38] for you the real gift is your soul down
[1:48:42] in there see that was born of God and
[1:48:45] that controls the whole thing to the
[1:48:47] word and the will of God
[1:48:50] and there you grow up
[1:48:52] there you grow up
[1:48:55] amen that real you that was
[1:48:57] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:48:58] world when you hear the call of the
[1:49:01] opening of the word revealing your name
[1:49:03] calling you forth amen there you grow up
[1:49:07] is that right
[1:49:09] and there you grew up and there you're a
[1:49:11] son and daughter of God you're a child
[1:49:13] of God and these things as you come up
[1:49:15] like the mother excuse me now you're in
[1:49:18] the bowels of the earth trying to come
[1:49:20] forth you're a Son of God coming forth
[1:49:22] and you see the words
[1:49:25] and you said I should do this I should
[1:49:27] be born again in other words you're
[1:49:28] coming forth you're lining up with the
[1:49:29] word of God Amen
[1:49:31] so the real gift is that predestinated
[1:49:34] seed down on the inside of you that must
[1:49:37] be quickened and come to life amen and
[1:49:40] so your own nature then goes away and
[1:49:42] now you have a new nature from your from
[1:49:44] the Lamb's Book of Life that is coming
[1:49:46] forth amen and the difference between
[1:49:48] every other age in this age is when that
[1:49:51] seed was quickened they uh they can
[1:49:53] still operate by the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:55] Ghost and then die and go in the grave
[1:49:56] but in in this hour we have the
[1:49:59] opportunity to grow into the full
[1:50:01] stature of Christ amen
[1:50:04] so we must grow from the baptism of the
[1:50:07] Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost itself
[1:50:10] amen you guys okay for some teaching
[1:50:14] amen and so again you must grow from the
[1:50:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy
[1:50:19] Ghost itself is that right because we
[1:50:21] know that justification sanctification
[1:50:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost those are
[1:50:25] the three works of Grace that constitute
[1:50:28] the new birth amen amen but when you're
[1:50:31] born again you're just a baby is that
[1:50:33] right and so there you grow now into the
[1:50:37] Holy Ghost itself the fullness of Christ
[1:50:40] in other words brother remember another
[1:50:41] spot the justification makes way for
[1:50:44] sanctification sanctification makes way
[1:50:47] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:50:49] what we don't stop there though baptism
[1:50:51] of the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy
[1:50:54] Ghost itself
[1:50:57] amen
[1:50:59] praise the Lord
[1:51:01] are you guys good
[1:51:03] amen there's a couple dozen other quotes
[1:51:06] that we can give
[1:51:07] amen you know Brethren refers to it in
[1:51:10] other places the true baptism of the
[1:51:12] holy spirit in other words you're born
[1:51:14] again and when you're born again you're
[1:51:17] what you're at the bottom of the pyramid
[1:51:19] amen like one brother said one time he
[1:51:21] felt like he was doing pretty good you
[1:51:23] know has having faith you know we're
[1:51:25] feeling pretty strong and he he's like
[1:51:27] well I feel like I got a lot of faith he
[1:51:29] looked at the pyramid and faith is at
[1:51:30] the bottom
[1:51:33] amen so you know as brother Israel was
[1:51:35] saying this morning that we must keep
[1:51:37] ourselves in the dust Amen on the road
[1:51:39] to Damascus is that right there's
[1:51:41] nothing good within us amen
[1:51:43] but you know when we're born again
[1:51:45] that's just the beginning right and so
[1:51:47] we must add then to our faith virtue
[1:51:50] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[1:51:52] brotherly kindness is that right so then
[1:51:54] what are we doing we're growing to the
[1:51:56] full stature of Christ is that right
[1:51:59] amen and brother map said you take the
[1:52:00] blood out of a man and put the blood of
[1:52:02] Jesus Christ in him and that man will
[1:52:04] have the faith of Jesus Christ The
[1:52:06] Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge the
[1:52:08] tempers the patience the godliness of
[1:52:11] Jesus Christ not a religious person but
[1:52:14] the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:52:18] I do that only which pleases the father
[1:52:20] amen and the volume of the book it is
[1:52:23] written of me here I come to do thy will
[1:52:26] O Lord the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[1:52:30] amen is that right so amen what are you
[1:52:32] doing then your doubt being built up
[1:52:34] into the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:52:36] the Holy Ghost itself the person
[1:52:40] amen and that's where the Prophet God
[1:52:42] said that the token is the literal life
[1:52:44] of Jesus Christ amen the token is you in
[1:52:48] Christ as persons together amen and so
[1:52:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost was
[1:52:53] restored in 1906 but then the prophet of
[1:52:56] God still came and said apply the token
[1:52:59] when in the evening time when the full
[1:53:02] word the full Spirit comes into
[1:53:04] manifestation
[1:53:06] why because in the first stage amen just
[1:53:09] like in the type that we read the the
[1:53:11] worshiper that was to be cleansed from
[1:53:14] his sin must be sprinkled seven times
[1:53:17] amen
[1:53:18] seven times and so when our Lord Jesus
[1:53:21] Christ died upon the Earth and he died
[1:53:22] apart on the cross there was blood water
[1:53:24] spirit came out of him amen but in each
[1:53:27] age they only received a partial baptism
[1:53:30] is that right this is the gospel Amen in
[1:53:33] each age in Paul's age Paul said we've
[1:53:35] seen apart and we prophesy in part but
[1:53:37] when that which is perfect is come that
[1:53:41] which is in part shall be done away with
[1:53:42] in other words Paul amen he he even
[1:53:45] prophesied and said we only have a part
[1:53:48] so in Paul's age they had a part Amen in
[1:53:50] other words they had one stripe of blood
[1:53:53] is that right they had one virtue that
[1:53:56] was that was poured out in the second
[1:53:58] age the third Age Again One stripe of
[1:54:00] blood one virtue that was poured out
[1:54:02] third age fourth age fifth age same
[1:54:04] thing seventh age one stripe of blood
[1:54:06] one virtue that was poured out but then
[1:54:09] as the prophet was entering into his new
[1:54:12] ministry and he was called here to the
[1:54:14] desert to meet not one Angel not two
[1:54:17] angels but seven angels with the seven
[1:54:20] spirits of God that was poured out in
[1:54:23] each age now the entire Holy Spirit
[1:54:26] visits the church
[1:54:29] glory to God Amen so he was caught up
[1:54:31] into the seven spirits of God Amen he
[1:54:34] was robed with those seven spirits amen
[1:54:38] and and we know that those seven spirits
[1:54:40] says the prophet of God said there's
[1:54:41] seven steps to God and the seven spirits
[1:54:44] represent the seven colors of the
[1:54:46] rainbow amen
[1:54:48] amen
[1:54:49] and so again we're talking about being
[1:54:51] transformed from temporary to original
[1:54:57] amen and so we'll leave we'll skip a lot
[1:54:59] of this here
[1:55:06] amen he spoke the trail and it's the
[1:55:08] mystery of the third pole opening the
[1:55:10] word
[1:55:12] I'll skip all this here on the seven
[1:55:14] Thunders and different things here
[1:55:18] amen but uh well let me just let me just
[1:55:20] read here a few notes I won't get too
[1:55:22] far into it if that's okay brother
[1:55:23] Israel
[1:55:25] but here you can go back and these are
[1:55:27] just my my notes I just I jot it down
[1:55:29] quickly but you can go back there's
[1:55:31] quotes for all of these things
[1:55:33] and uh
[1:55:34] again because we're being
[1:55:37] transformed from the temporary to the
[1:55:39] original
[1:55:41] we're being joined to the head is that
[1:55:43] right
[1:55:44] amen we're trying to find a trail
[1:55:46] hopefully we're on the trail if we're
[1:55:47] not on the trail let's get on the trail
[1:55:49] we're trying to find the trail to what
[1:55:51] to the marriage which is to be what
[1:55:53] joined to the head is that right which
[1:55:56] is to be what joined to the word that
[1:55:58] identifies and that and that is for us
[1:56:01] to be joined to you is that right
[1:56:04] so let me just go ahead and read these
[1:56:05] couple quotes here on the messages uh is
[1:56:07] this the sign of the answer
[1:56:10] uh sorry let me go to the one on the
[1:56:12] seventh Seer real quick
[1:56:13] we got a few minutes
[1:56:16] again so we're growing from the baptism
[1:56:18] of the Holy Ghost to the Holy Ghost
[1:56:20] itself to come to perfection
[1:56:24] a man from a perfect standing to a
[1:56:26] perfect state
[1:56:28] is that right
[1:56:30] and if I can just say like this in my
[1:56:31] own words from a perfect standing in
[1:56:34] other words the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:56:35] making atonement for us puts us in
[1:56:38] perfect standing before God Amen
[1:56:41] amen but we're moving from from from
[1:56:43] from
[1:56:44] uh what did I say in other words we're
[1:56:47] moving from from the pleading of the
[1:56:49] blood or from the intercession of the
[1:56:51] blood to the applying of the blood is
[1:56:52] that right so the blood is being applied
[1:56:55] to us the voice of the blood speaking is
[1:56:58] cleansing us from all unrighteousness
[1:57:01] and bringing us to a perfect state
[1:57:05] amen from the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:08] to the Holy Ghost itself the wedding
[1:57:12] garment a perfect State the
[1:57:14] righteousness of the Saints
[1:57:17] and in another place the prophet of God
[1:57:19] said then Satan's accusing is over
[1:57:23] how many heard him say that amen
[1:57:25] when he has nothing more to accuse his
[1:57:28] accusing is over is that right
[1:57:31] all right so in the message of the
[1:57:32] seventh seal
[1:57:34] uh paragraph 44
[1:57:39] and brother Graham says here
[1:57:41] and it's the hour that the world has
[1:57:43] long to see is now approaching for it
[1:57:45] cries out for Redemption
[1:57:48] he says we can see the elements ready to
[1:57:50] bring it back we can see the elements
[1:57:54] ready to bring the church into the
[1:57:57] presence of Christ so he's identifying
[1:57:59] something for us we can see the elements
[1:58:01] ready to bring the church into the
[1:58:04] presence of Christ we can see the bride
[1:58:07] taking on the form putting the wedding
[1:58:11] garment on making ready we can see the
[1:58:15] lights flickering we know we are at the
[1:58:18] end so he said the bride b-r-i-d-e
[1:58:22] getting ready putting the wedding
[1:58:24] garment on is that right
[1:58:26] amen so making ready the bride making
[1:58:29] ready is that right she has made herself
[1:58:31] ready and those that were ready went in
[1:58:33] to meet the bridegroom is that right so
[1:58:35] the bride he's saying the elements in
[1:58:37] other words the things that we need to
[1:58:40] make us ready amen is here they're being
[1:58:42] identified we see it
[1:58:45] and they're like well one brother said
[1:58:46] in order to say what the prophet has
[1:58:48] said you have to see what he saw amen
[1:58:50] and so here he's seeing we can see the
[1:58:53] elements ready to bring it back we can
[1:58:56] see the elements ready to bring the
[1:58:57] church into the presence of Christ we
[1:59:00] can see the bride taking on the form
[1:59:03] putting the wedding garment on making
[1:59:06] ready
[1:59:08] Glory Hallelujah
[1:59:10] now hold that thought in your mind
[1:59:12] making ready
[1:59:14] praise the Lord
[1:59:18] amen and again being joined to the Head
[1:59:21] being joined on the marriage amen so
[1:59:23] we're being joined to the Head the
[1:59:25] prophet of God said it's the
[1:59:26] manifestation of the son of man that
[1:59:27] joins us to the head is that right
[1:59:30] but here he also says it's the seven
[1:59:32] Thunders that caps the pyramid amen in
[1:59:35] other words the seventh unders that
[1:59:36] bring back The Headstone is that right
[1:59:39] all right let's see if the Lord will
[1:59:40] help us put it together
[1:59:42] amen so you remember the pyramid
[1:59:44] messages it's the Capstone what did it
[1:59:46] do the Holy Spirit capped off the
[1:59:49] individual and seal it when we added to
[1:59:52] our faith righteousness godliness and
[1:59:53] faith and so forth and kept adding till
[1:59:55] we got seven things
[1:59:58] and the seventh one was love which is
[1:59:59] God that's how he makes the individual
[2:00:02] and caps him and seals him with the Holy
[2:00:05] Spirit then if that be so we've got
[2:00:09] seven Church ages that he's had seven
[2:00:12] Mysteries that's been sounded away and
[2:00:15] they fought for it to bring it back and
[2:00:17] now the headstone comes
[2:00:19] to cap off the church he says does the
[2:00:22] Thunders mean that my brethren sirs
[2:00:25] where are we at amen
[2:00:27] and now again in the same message uh
[2:00:30] paragraph 390
[2:00:32] the prophet God says here
[2:00:34] is this the mystery of the Thunders that
[2:00:37] will bring back The Headstone you know
[2:00:39] the pyramid never was capped The
[2:00:42] Headstone has yet to come it's been
[2:00:43] rejected but here the prophet of God
[2:00:45] says the Thunders is to cap the church
[2:00:48] is that right to bring back The
[2:00:49] Headstone amen and and uh sorry but
[2:00:52] there was excuse me but there was one
[2:00:54] Minister one time that said because uh
[2:00:56] again there's this is a controversial
[2:00:57] thing but I trust you all y'all love me
[2:00:59] enough to to say what the prophet said
[2:01:01] amen but there was one brother and in
[2:01:03] the message in this I'm going to show
[2:01:05] you where the battle of the coming of
[2:01:06] the Lord is right in our midst remember
[2:01:09] one Minister one times
[2:01:11] was trying to preach on the Thunders and
[2:01:14] he basically took what the prophet of
[2:01:17] God said in the in the message uh
[2:01:19] questions and answers on the seal or
[2:01:20] questions and answers 1964 and he said
[2:01:23] the Thunders were revealed under the
[2:01:25] seals amen we're we're in deep water but
[2:01:28] we're going to get out real quick okay
[2:01:29] just bear with me amen and so he took
[2:01:32] that and said what the prophet said here
[2:01:34] it basically means nothing because the
[2:01:37] prophet was just presuming in other
[2:01:39] words he couldn't he couldn't connect
[2:01:41] this to with the word so he discarded it
[2:01:44] and said oh it's over here
[2:01:46] amen and so that's the same spirit amen
[2:01:50] that would say you know Mark 16 isn't
[2:01:52] inspired is that right that's the same
[2:01:54] spirit that would say uh you know I want
[2:01:57] to believe what Jesus said in Matthew
[2:01:58] Matthew 28 19. father son the Holy Ghost
[2:02:01] but I'm not going to take what Peter
[2:02:03] said is that right amen The Same Spirit
[2:02:05] in the message today weeds all over the
[2:02:08] trail the congregation can't find where
[2:02:10] they're going and they're dead
[2:02:13] amen and so we're in a battle amen these
[2:02:16] things have been sent to us for a
[2:02:18] purpose the prophet God saying they
[2:02:21] never sounded in vain amen they never
[2:02:23] sounded in vain they ever sent to us for
[2:02:25] a purpose and will read to you what
[2:02:28] those purposes are amen
[2:02:30] and so the seven Thunders joins their
[2:02:32] Church through the head and this is me
[2:02:35] this is my notes Here the prophet of God
[2:02:36] emphatically states there twice that the
[2:02:38] seven Thunders joins the church to the
[2:02:40] head and he also says the revealing of
[2:02:43] the son of man joins the church through
[2:02:45] the head is that right so again my notes
[2:02:47] the prophet was caught up into the white
[2:02:49] pyramid of seven angels the seven
[2:02:52] spirits of Elohim the seven colors of
[2:02:54] the rainbow the Fountain of God's being
[2:02:56] he was robbed in a seven color robe and
[2:03:00] made completely white to manifest the
[2:03:02] son of man his new ministry his adoption
[2:03:05] Ministry amen as as brother Israel was
[2:03:07] saying this morning he was entering into
[2:03:09] his new ministry and if I can say he
[2:03:11] came into the fullness of that Ministry
[2:03:13] and entered into that being clothed and
[2:03:16] made white amen by that which had been
[2:03:19] introduced in this hour to then now do
[2:03:21] what join the church to the head to
[2:03:24] manifest and to Proclaim and to preach
[2:03:27] these things
[2:03:29] amen and so he spoke the trail in the
[2:03:31] mystery of the third pool the opening of
[2:03:33] the word and the Seven Thunders or the
[2:03:34] prophet of God or the Jesus said my
[2:03:36] words are spirit and life is that right
[2:03:40] my words are spirit and life and if I
[2:03:44] can just go a step further amen there's
[2:03:46] also a controversy amen when we talk
[2:03:48] about the Thunders many people say it's
[2:03:50] the Mysteries under the seals is that
[2:03:52] all right then other people will say
[2:03:54] it's the virtues okay amen my opinion is
[2:03:58] that it's both because Jesus said my
[2:04:02] words are spirit and life amen it's the
[2:04:06] Mysteries but it's the seven spirits of
[2:04:08] God coming but from the angels of God
[2:04:11] the seven spirits of God coming in
[2:04:13] Angelic form with a message that
[2:04:16] thundered out to bring to us the literal
[2:04:19] life of Jesus Christ
[2:04:22] amen so his words are Spirit in life is
[2:04:25] that right amen so the the again these
[2:04:28] are just my notes I jot it down
[2:04:30] seven purposes or seven things mainly if
[2:04:33] the prophet of God said about the or I
[2:04:34] think I have eight things here actually
[2:04:36] and I'm just gonna I'm already in deep
[2:04:38] water so we're just gonna keep going and
[2:04:40] we're going to try to try to get some of
[2:04:43] you up out of the water hey man you're
[2:04:44] choking
[2:04:45] hey man you're gonna learn to swim or
[2:04:48] you're gonna drown praise the Lord but
[2:04:50] we're going to throw you a life a life
[2:04:51] jacket here in a minute all right amen
[2:04:54] I'm hoping y'all are taking notes
[2:04:55] because again remember this is between
[2:04:57] life and death This is between the
[2:04:58] tribulation and uh the rapture
[2:05:01] amen not my word but what the prophet
[2:05:03] said here is that right
[2:05:04] so again the seven Thunder is the
[2:05:06] prophet God said wakes up the bride is
[2:05:08] the bride's Revival gathers the bride
[2:05:10] together for rapturing Faith shows the
[2:05:14] bride how to prepare for great
[2:05:16] translation Faith these are all
[2:05:18] statements of the Prophet okay gathers
[2:05:20] the bride together for rapturing Faith
[2:05:23] shows the bride how to prepare for great
[2:05:26] translation Faith wakes up the bride is
[2:05:30] the bride's Revival he also said in the
[2:05:32] church age book and it will be real
[2:05:33] restore Apostolic Faith I mean it caps
[2:05:37] the pyramid and these are my words
[2:05:39] brings an end to Satan's accusation is
[2:05:42] that right I mean because the prophet
[2:05:43] God tells us in the force seal wait
[2:05:45] until those seven Thunders utter their
[2:05:48] voices to that group who really can take
[2:05:51] the word of God and hand it there amen
[2:05:53] talking about Satan he he gets pulled
[2:05:56] down with the sword the two-edged sword
[2:05:59] of the word of the Lord amen
[2:06:01] so amen these things bring an end to
[2:06:05] Satan's accusations is that right
[2:06:08] all right praise the Lord are you all
[2:06:10] still with me
[2:06:11] and again I'm quoting the prophet he
[2:06:13] says it will reveal the new name of
[2:06:15] Jesus which is the name that he received
[2:06:18] after he overcame death Hell In The
[2:06:20] Grave is that right
[2:06:23] amen and again these are my notes I
[2:06:25] wrote down here this evening once you
[2:06:28] have the wedding garment on Satan's
[2:06:29] accusations are over there's nothing to
[2:06:33] accuse you have moved from a perfect
[2:06:35] state
[2:06:37] our perfect standing under the blood to
[2:06:39] a perfect state by applying the blood
[2:06:42] amen
[2:06:43] all right and so we're moving from the
[2:06:46] temporary to the original
[2:06:49] all right you all still with me amen and
[2:06:51] the prophet of God tells us that there
[2:06:53] is only one original color how many
[2:06:55] knows what that is the prophet God said
[2:06:57] it was why so the the bride is clothed
[2:07:00] with white which is the righteousness of
[2:07:02] the Saints amen so there's only one
[2:07:06] original color and that's white
[2:07:10] amen but what about the seven colors of
[2:07:12] the rainbow
[2:07:15] all right we'll get into that
[2:07:17] and the brother map says here there's
[2:07:19] only one original color and that's white
[2:07:22] how many knows that there is only one
[2:07:25] original color anything else is mixed
[2:07:27] hey man so there's only one original
[2:07:29] color anything else outside of that is
[2:07:32] mixed and the property God said Christ
[2:07:35] is on a solid white unadulterated word
[2:07:38] from the beginning amen amen every color
[2:07:43] would be white if some chemistry had not
[2:07:46] broke into it amen
[2:07:49] amen every color would be right we're
[2:07:51] talking about your wedding garment the
[2:07:54] materials are here to make you ready the
[2:07:57] elements have been identified the
[2:08:00] material is here scattered out
[2:08:02] throughout the books and tapes the
[2:08:03] material has been provided but now the
[2:08:06] word bride has made herself ready
[2:08:10] amen the Bride made herself ready by
[2:08:14] doing what applying the blood
[2:08:17] applying the word word upon word sell
[2:08:21] upon sale and you are what being clothed
[2:08:24] in your wedding garment that's why and I
[2:08:26] was going to read it but in Revelation
[2:08:27] 16 where where where Israel was this
[2:08:30] morning if you keep reading down the
[2:08:32] voice of Christ speaks out right there
[2:08:35] after or right at the same time that the
[2:08:38] three frogs are identified the three
[2:08:40] frogs are identified by the opening of
[2:08:42] the seals and the voice of Christ speaks
[2:08:45] glory to God
[2:08:48] right after the the three frogs were
[2:08:51] identified the voice of Christ speaks
[2:08:56] it says blessed is he that watcheth in
[2:08:59] keepeth His Garment lest they walk naked
[2:09:02] and they see their shame
[2:09:04] I hope you all just caught that amen
[2:09:07] in the morning time
[2:09:10] the three unclean spirits were
[2:09:11] identified the next thing after that the
[2:09:13] spirit of Christ speaks and says blessed
[2:09:15] is he that watcheth and keepeth His
[2:09:18] Garment
[2:09:19] amen that's present tense in this hour
[2:09:22] the sports of Christ speaking the spirit
[2:09:24] of the Bride saying blessed is he that
[2:09:27] watcheth in other words identifying the
[2:09:29] wedding garment now make ready
[2:09:32] and blessed are you thou watch and don't
[2:09:35] play any more Church entity and make
[2:09:37] sure you are applying the blood
[2:09:42] and how are you going to apply the blood
[2:09:43] you can't go to Jerusalem and go at the
[2:09:45] foot of the cross and try to oblige no
[2:09:47] it's the voice of the blood speaking
[2:09:50] today
[2:09:52] Glory Hallelujah
[2:09:55] every color would be white if some
[2:09:58] chemistry had not broke into it amen but
[2:10:01] chemistry has broke into it and it's all
[2:10:03] messed up but now the blood of Jesus
[2:10:06] Christ has been provided that we can be
[2:10:09] made white again we can go back to the
[2:10:12] original the bleach of the blood of
[2:10:13] Jesus Christ has been provided and every
[2:10:16] sin every stain every fear every lust
[2:10:19] every doubt can be annihilated
[2:10:22] can be dissolved and go back into the
[2:10:25] eternities into the infinite and go back
[2:10:27] to Satan where it belongs and now you
[2:10:30] stand as a son or daughter of God
[2:10:33] without sin in a perfect and clean
[2:10:35] conscience before God and now whatsoever
[2:10:38] you say
[2:10:40] glory to God will happen because it's
[2:10:43] the word of God coming from the mouth of
[2:10:45] God
[2:10:47] glory to God and so every color would be
[2:10:50] white if some chemistry had not broke
[2:10:52] into it amen glory every Church would be
[2:10:55] standing on the apostolic doctrine of
[2:10:58] the word and God confirming it
[2:11:02] every Church
[2:11:05] Shalom Tabernacle every Church in the
[2:11:07] message every Church on planet Earth
[2:11:09] would be standing on the apostolic
[2:11:13] Doctrine and the word of God
[2:11:17] and God confirming it if Creed is
[2:11:19] something else had not been mixed into
[2:11:21] it is that right
[2:11:22] amen so the original color is white and
[2:11:26] and maybe the the scientists or
[2:11:28] Engineers may know this but I got to
[2:11:29] look at that one time I said well what
[2:11:31] about the seven colors of the rainbow
[2:11:33] amen because we know that speaks of God
[2:11:35] is that right
[2:11:36] amen but come to find out when you blend
[2:11:39] all seven colors together it does what
[2:11:42] it makes white
[2:11:45] is that right brother Joe maybe he's
[2:11:47] thinking about it it's been too long
[2:11:49] since since College maybe amen but amen
[2:11:53] so all seven colors of the rainbow
[2:11:56] coming together make white
[2:11:59] so in the first stage there was one
[2:12:01] color that couldn't be made completely
[2:12:02] white is that right second-ish third age
[2:12:05] fourth age fifth age but now in this
[2:12:06] hour all seven Angel angels have come
[2:12:10] all seven spirits have come to bring to
[2:12:13] you the fullness of the atonement all
[2:12:18] seven Stripes of blood wherein being
[2:12:20] applied to your life you could be made
[2:12:24] completely righteous the righteous of
[2:12:27] the Saints completely white and go back
[2:12:29] to the original
[2:12:33] Glory Hallelujah
[2:12:35] amen these are my notes seven spirits to
[2:12:38] turn you back to original white seven
[2:12:41] colors make you white amen so if you
[2:12:44] have red yellow whatever it is four or
[2:12:46] five six colors it doesn't turn white it
[2:12:48] turns pale
[2:12:49] and goes to death
[2:12:52] amen
[2:12:56] all right
[2:12:59] so my notes again personification of
[2:13:01] Life the fullness of the spirit the Holy
[2:13:04] Ghost itself amen that's the hour that
[2:13:06] we're living in is not only the
[2:13:08] personification of death hell being
[2:13:11] created on Earth is that right amen the
[2:13:14] prophet of God in 1963 I believe it was
[2:13:16] was here in JCPenney in Tucson and
[2:13:18] seeing those those those those those
[2:13:20] basically those demon Spirits those
[2:13:23] women those poor women not knowing but
[2:13:26] have been infiltrated by Spirits from
[2:13:29] Hell amen and so that was hell being
[2:13:32] created being personified coming up upon
[2:13:35] the Earth is that right
[2:13:37] I mean that was you know 50 60 years ago
[2:13:41] is that right amen so hell has was
[2:13:43] identified back then as coming upon the
[2:13:46] Earth and here we are in this hour and
[2:13:49] the war is Raging
[2:13:51] the personification of death on its
[2:13:55] subjects and the personification of Life
[2:13:57] on Christ subjects and he's Gathering
[2:14:00] amen Christ is gathering his now from
[2:14:04] Heaven and Earth amen and Satan is
[2:14:07] gathering his from the four parts of the
[2:14:09] earth is that right glory to God so
[2:14:11] we're in a gathering time and you will
[2:14:14] be gathered one way or the other
[2:14:17] and those that are not gathered on one
[2:14:19] or the other take the tribulation period
[2:14:21] because they fail to come to the
[2:14:24] fullness of the atonement
[2:14:28] though they believe the message though
[2:14:30] they shout though they jumped or they
[2:14:32] dance they were dilatory they didn't
[2:14:34] take it seriously and they failed to
[2:14:37] come to the fullness of the atonement
[2:14:43] all right praise the Lord
[2:14:46] amen but you're being gathered
[2:14:48] were Satan's horses you know three
[2:14:50] colors religion politics demonic Powers
[2:14:53] is that right
[2:14:55] politics
[2:14:57] brother Israel is preaching on politics
[2:14:59] this morning amen be careful because
[2:15:01] that's Satan trying to gather you
[2:15:05] same thing with all your worldly habits
[2:15:07] all this nonsense on social media all
[2:15:09] these things be careful that Satan
[2:15:12] trying to gather you
[2:15:16] all right so we are in the hour of the
[2:15:19] personification of life as well as the
[2:15:21] personification of death the fullness of
[2:15:23] the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit itself
[2:15:25] the seven spirits of God the entire Holy
[2:15:28] Spirit visiting the church the fullness
[2:15:30] of the atonement the voice of the blood
[2:15:32] speaking present tense the seven
[2:15:34] Thunders whatever you want to call it
[2:15:36] the opening of the book this great
[2:15:37] manifestation of this great angel in
[2:15:40] this hour that has descended from
[2:15:42] eternity to lead us the angel of the
[2:15:45] Covenant that has come now to lead us in
[2:15:48] this Exodus Amen to lead us from partial
[2:15:51] atonement to full atonement to lead us
[2:15:54] to a body change
[2:15:56] glory to God
[2:15:59] all right
[2:16:02] and let me just go to the fourth seal we
[2:16:04] got two more quotes and more criminal
[2:16:06] close
[2:16:10] if the musicians can come
[2:16:17] amen we're going to try to find a
[2:16:20] this is happy to me I know it's pretty
[2:16:22] sobering amen but we amen we must be on
[2:16:25] the right Trail you know you've got the
[2:16:27] victory is that right you know because
[2:16:29] the mighty Angel has come down and has
[2:16:32] given us everything we have need of to
[2:16:35] overcoming this hour is that right amen
[2:16:38] so it's the grace of God Amen that is
[2:16:41] that that is coming to you to to to

[2:16:49] already overcoming you overcame this you

[2:17:17] Creeds now we find out the denomination

[2:19:36] voice of God don't resent anything amen
[2:19:39] amen this was the word from our Prophet
[2:19:42] that I was spoken tonight everything I
[2:19:44] all my notes everything you can take it
[2:19:46] back to the word amen don't resent it if
[2:19:49] it was contrary to maybe a different
[2:19:51] belief or whatever just ask God to help
[2:19:54] you to take away your unbelief to take
[2:19:57] away your your doubts whatever it is and
[2:20:00] enter in amen and ask God to help you to
[2:20:02] find the trail to make sure as the
[2:20:05] prophet of God said strive every day to
[2:20:07] keep the Life of Christ in you that you
[2:20:11] might be fruit bearing amen
[2:20:13] Lori because we are Overcomers is that
[2:20:16] right he has overcome for us but we're
[2:20:19] in this hour oh praise the Lord where it
[2:20:22] will be manifested Hallelujah and one of
[2:20:25] these days as you're upon this Trail and
[2:20:28] this Trail is the the road to Damascus
[2:20:30] Trail amen you're in the dust you're
[2:20:33] crucified completely the old you is dead
[2:20:36] and you're on this Trail there's
[2:20:38] something inside you though you've been
[2:20:40] in the message for 10 years 20 years 30
[2:20:43] years 40 years 50 years you heard this
[2:20:45] and you heard that and you've you've
[2:20:47] been let down here you've been let down
[2:20:49] there but there is something inside of
[2:20:51] you that's pulsating you that's moving
[2:20:54] you forward there's more ground to
[2:20:57] obtain is that right think about the
[2:20:59] prophet of God after entering into a
[2:21:01] constellation of seven angels all these
[2:21:04] things taking place the Lamb of God
[2:21:06] coming into his mortal being and opening
[2:21:09] the seals right before us amen all of
[2:21:12] these things but yet he was still long
[2:21:15] and he was still he was still crying out
[2:21:17] to God and they're here in in up there
[2:21:20] in the Catalina mountains he found the
[2:21:23] ending of this Trail
[2:21:25] glory to God he identified everything he
[2:21:27] preached everything in that white Rock
[2:21:29] he that brother said he looked back and
[2:21:31] said once was once prophecy is now
[2:21:34] history but yet there he found the
[2:21:37] ending of this Trail
[2:21:39] glory to God when he seen that Sabbath
[2:21:43] Dove amen and and the voice cried out to
[2:21:46] him and said your enemy is dead
[2:21:49] glory to God his enemy was dead at
[2:21:51] Calvary but he had to follow this Trail
[2:21:53] to come to a perfect and full
[2:21:55] realization amen and so we all must come
[2:21:58] Amen to that same place to come to the
[2:22:01] fullness of the atonement on this Trail
[2:22:04] is that right
[2:22:05] so keep pressing keep pushing forward
