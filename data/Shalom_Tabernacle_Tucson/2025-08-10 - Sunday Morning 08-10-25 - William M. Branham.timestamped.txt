[2:46] This morning, let's all stand to our
[2:47] feet. Go for Sunday school portion of
[2:51] the service
[2:52] like to welcome each of you to the house
[2:54] of the Lord
[2:56] and
[3:05] we'll just bow our heads for a word of
[3:06] prayer and just soft
[3:12] heavenly father
[3:14] we thank you for bringing us together
[3:15] once again Lord as we bring the service
[3:17] to
[3:19] We pray for your blessings for your
[3:20] anointing to come and strike us every
[3:23] heart. Lord, bless this beginning
[3:26] service all the way through the
[3:28] remainder of the day.
[3:30] Holy Spirit be with us. We pray. We love
[3:33] you. Thank you for those that are
[3:35] traveling on their way
[3:38] as well
[3:44] [Music]
[3:46] as well.
[3:48] Bless all the other classes, Father, the
[3:51] other
[3:54] pray.
[3:56] Amen.
[3:58] We'll sing a little bit of Amazing
[4:00] Grace.
[4:03] [Music]
[7:50] the sanctification where Jesus gave his
[7:52] life at the cross. Um sh spilling his
[7:57] blood upon the earth 2,000 years. The
[7:59] the second the third 2,000 years is the
[8:02] age that we're in and we come into that
[8:05] millennium reign and on into the seventh
[8:09] day. But that seventh day, that
[8:12] millennium is still not our eternal
[8:16] uh that we're not bound there. That's
[8:18] not our heavenly home. We have a
[8:21] heavenly home and that is our future
[8:24] home that he's building for us now.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; So what is left? What's next? Next for
[8:31] the church, for the believers is this
[8:34] thousand year reign with Christ for a
[8:38] thousand years. And this is a reality.
[8:41] This is not a story. This not fairy
[8:43] tale. This is where Hollywood gets their
[8:45] stories from truth like this. We will
[8:49] come back again. And there's a group of
[8:52] people that will be dead sleeping in
[8:55] their graves while we're still reigning
[8:57] on the earth. And at the end of that
[9:00] thousand years, it's still a time
[9:02] period. The Bible tells us that we will
[9:05] plant, we will build houses, brother
[9:07] Chris. We'll plant trees and vineyards
[9:11] and vegetables and gardens and we'll eat
[9:14] from that. We'll build homes. Some of us
[9:17] want a nice home. The square footage,
[9:19] whatever kind of home you want to build,
[9:21] we're going to do that
[9:22] &gt;&gt; in a thousand years reign with Christ.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; And there will be no satanic politics to
[9:30] influence us. And brother Vanam will
[9:32] bring it out in this message that as he
[9:35] redeemed the earth, he redeems you. So
[9:38] just as you are an attribute of God,
[9:41] this earth is an attribute of God. He
[9:44] created that. And this earth is as
[9:46] eternal as you are. I want you to think
[9:49] about that. He created the earth and not
[9:52] so that it can be destroyed or polluted.
[9:56] He created it so that righteousness and
[9:59] holiness can dwell on it. and that was
[10:01] his children to dwell upon the earth.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; And so when man corrupted it, he had to
[10:07] redeem it. He had to purify it and
[10:10] cleanse it so that um the people can
[10:13] live on it. So I mean, what's eternal
[10:16] life if you don't have a place to live
[10:18] on?
[10:19] &gt;&gt; Um you got to have a place to live. So
[10:21] the earth is eternal. Think about it.
[10:24] And this message really opens up your
[10:26] heart and your eyes to uh what the
[10:29] future holds for the true believer. This
[10:32] first resurrection, remember, everybody
[10:35] resurrects.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Everybody that come on the earth will
[10:40] rise again. But what order do you come
[10:42] in?
[10:43] &gt;&gt; That first resurrection is for the
[10:46] bride. That first resurrection is what
[10:49] we are attaining to
[10:51] &gt;&gt; to be a part of the first resurrection.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus was a part of the first fruits and
[10:57] we were raised in that first
[10:59] resurrection. And blessed and holy is he
[11:03] that hath part in that first
[11:05] resurrection. Those are the ones that
[11:08] will come back to the earth for a
[11:11] thousand years and rule and reign with
[11:16] Christ. And as Christ cleans the earth,
[11:19] he cleanses the believer. And when he
[11:21] and brother says that he as he he'll
[11:23] take all the politics out of the earth
[11:26] just like he takes all the politics out
[11:28] of you.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The individual. So you can be a
[11:32] son or daughter of God. So, we just read
[11:35] in Revelations there, chapter 20, uh,
[11:38] chapter 21. It's a nice, uh, view of the
[11:41] new heaven and the new earth. But I'd
[11:43] like to take the scripture in Luke
[11:44] chapter 22, verse 24.
[11:48] If you can turn there quickly, this is
[11:50] just one place of many where the
[11:53] disciples were looking for this time
[11:57] to rule and reign with Christ.
[12:00] They were looking for Jesus to come and
[12:03] kick all the Romans out and reestablish
[12:07] his kingdom right now. Here's the great
[12:10] Messiah. This is the one that David
[12:12] spoke of. Isaiah spoke of him. All the
[12:14] prophets spoke of him. And then here's
[12:16] Jesus manifesting these great signs,
[12:19] wonders, and miracles. They're thinking
[12:21] that they will go right into reigning
[12:23] and ruling and establishing a righteous
[12:27] kingdom
[12:28] &gt;&gt; where the Lord Jesus will be that king.
[12:30] And it wasn't time yet.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't time yet. And Jesus never told
[12:36] them, "This is not exactly your time."
[12:39] He just kept it moving forward. And they
[12:41] would ask him a question. Lord, will you
[12:44] restore the kingdom at this time? And he
[12:46] says, "It's not for you to know the time
[12:48] or the season when God will. You just
[12:50] got to keep moving forward. Just keep
[12:52] moving forward. And some of us will
[12:54] taste death. I don't know. Um, if the
[12:57] Lord Teresa is coming, some of us will
[13:00] have to go by the way of the grave.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; But there's still going to be a
[13:05] thousand-year reign.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; And you're not going to miss that. If
[13:08] you go down properly, you'll get up in
[13:11] time
[13:12] &gt;&gt; to to be a part of to be a part of the
[13:15] thousand-year reign.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; How many want to be there?
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[13:20] &gt;&gt; there so far beyond just coming to
[13:22] church.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; This is my future. This is where I'm
[13:26] headed.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; So let's take Luke 22 24. And there was
[13:31] strife among them. Which of them should
[13:33] be accounted the greatest?
[13:36] He said unto them, "The kings of the
[13:38] Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
[13:41] and they that exercise authority upon
[13:43] them are called benefactors.
[13:45] But ye shall not be so. But he that is
[13:48] greatest among you, let him be as the
[13:50] younger, and he that is chief as he doth
[13:54] serve. For whether is greater, he that
[13:56] siteth at meat, or he that serveth, is
[14:00] not he that sitth at meat? But I am
[14:03] among you as he that serveth.
[14:06] Yeah, ye are they which have continued
[14:10] with me in my temptations. He's talking
[14:12] to his 12 disciples here. And I appoint
[14:16] unto you a kingdom as my father has
[14:19] appointed unto me. that ye may eat and
[14:22] drink at my table in my kingdom and sit
[14:27] on thrones judging the 12 tribes of
[14:31] Israel. And so we see the Lord is
[14:34] talking about this future kingdom even
[14:38] with his disciples. Now
[14:41] just to take a few quotations for you.
[14:44] The prophet talking about this
[14:45] millennium. He says this in the message
[14:49] the resurrection of Lazarus 1953
[14:52] November
[14:55] he says he can't do nothing more for he
[14:57] says paragraphs 11 you know sometimes I
[15:00] think I wonder how the Lord feels about
[15:02] us sometimes
[15:04] when he does so many things for us and
[15:07] yet we just sit like we are
[15:08] subconsciously don't we aren't we all
[15:11] guilty we just sat and say well Lord I
[15:15] wish you'd do something for for me. He
[15:17] can't do nothing more for us than what
[15:20] he's already done. He's already healed
[15:22] us. He's already saved us. He's already
[15:24] given us joy. Give us peace. He's our
[15:28] shield, our buckler. Everything that we
[15:30] have is in him. And he's done paid the
[15:33] price of redemption to redeem us back as
[15:35] sons and daughters of God. There's only
[15:37] one thing in the world that is yet left
[15:40] undone. That is physical death. We've
[15:44] all got to die because that was the only
[15:47] way God has of bringing us home. That's
[15:50] the only avenue we can travel is through
[15:53] death to get home. So everything is
[15:55] under his feet. Everything except death.
[15:59] And death has done been the penalty of
[16:01] death done been taken off. And now we
[16:05] just go right into his presence and
[16:08] someday return back and be made immortal
[16:11] and live on this earth a thousand years
[16:14] with Jesus Christ. Amen. I believe that.
[16:17] I'm strictly a millennialist. I believe
[16:19] in the millennium. I believe all the
[16:21] Hebrew prophets and through the ages
[16:23] spoke of the golden age of the
[16:25] millennium coming. I believe we're going
[16:29] to have it. We'll reign here with him a
[16:32] thousand years. There's postmillennium,
[16:36] premillennium,
[16:37] no millennium. If you say, "I don't
[16:39] believe it it at all," that's all right.
[16:41] We're still brothers.
[16:44] In the message, God's preparation,
[16:46] brother Bannam says this here, paragraph
[16:48] number 49, over in the book of
[16:51] Revelation said, "Rejoice ye heavens and
[16:53] ye holy prophets, for the kingdom of
[16:56] this world has become the kingdom of our
[16:58] Lord and his Christ. And he ruled and
[17:00] reigned on earth a thousand years. There
[17:02] you are. Then they will study war no
[17:06] more. But as long as Satan's got rule,
[17:10] this one will build up a little bit. A
[17:12] few righteous men will get in office and
[17:14] they will build up a little bit and then
[17:16] Satan will reach over here and tear the
[17:19] thing down. That's right. Then the first
[17:22] thing you know with that great prince
[17:24] that's coming someday, every man, every
[17:27] nation fighting, let this be the
[17:29] international language. Let this be the
[17:32] international flag. And they're fighting
[17:34] for power and don't realize they're
[17:36] calling up a bunch of crazy people. And
[17:39] we're in the kingdom that will possess
[17:42] the world. That's right. Yes, sir. The
[17:46] kingdom of God shall rule and reign and
[17:49] smite down every nation, every flag.
[17:52] There will be one flag, and that will be
[17:55] the old rugged cross. There will be one
[17:58] language and that will be the heavenly
[18:02] hallelujah. And that will be heavenly.
[18:04] Hallelujah. One people that will be the
[18:07] saints. They will rule and reign with
[18:11] Christ on David's throne, his father,
[18:14] and rule and reign here through the
[18:16] millennium a thousand years. Then it
[18:19] over to the new earth. Oh, what a
[18:22] marvelous thing. The Junction of Time
[18:26] 1956, Brother Random says this here.
[18:30] When Satan will be bound and cast into
[18:32] the pit, chained by a chain of
[18:35] circumstance circumstance that he cannot
[18:38] come out and deceive the nations no
[18:41] more. And a thousand years millennium
[18:44] reign will take place on the earth while
[18:47] we are glorifying our Lord Jesus and
[18:51] adorning him. Crown him the king of
[18:54] kings and lord of lords.
[18:58] Jehovah Gyra 1961.
[19:01] All the world is groaning waiting for
[19:03] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[19:06] Waiting for the church to get back into
[19:08] its place again. Sons of God to be made
[19:12] manifest. Waiting for that hour. Hope
[19:14] that don't hurt. But I just had to say
[19:16] it. See, the church is so far away from
[19:20] its place. It needs to be back to be
[19:22] sons of God again, rulers, governors of
[19:27] the earth under the spiritual reign. It
[19:31] will be someday when the chief one
[19:33] comes, Jesus Christ, the great
[19:36] millennium. Nature is groaning for that
[19:39] day.
[19:41] Questions and answers. The prophet says
[19:44] this in 1962.
[19:47] Then at the return of the church and the
[19:49] bride, the bride in Christ shall walk
[19:52] out upon the ashes in the millennium
[19:55] when the earth is purified by fire. And
[19:58] there they shall reign and the heavens
[20:01] that never heard that the heathens
[20:03] that's never heard the gospel shall be
[20:06] raised in that time and the sons of God
[20:09] will be manifested. If he's to reign,
[20:12] he's got to have something to reign
[20:13] over. He's got a domain and they ruled
[20:17] and reigned with Christ and Christ ruled
[20:20] with a rod of iron the nations. Then the
[20:23] gospel then the manifested sons of God
[20:27] with the authority just like he had when
[20:29] he was here. See there will come the
[20:32] millennium in that reign. See upon the
[20:35] ashes. So I watch for something. Has it
[20:39] slipped by us in humility and we've
[20:42] missed it? Is it gone and the church is
[20:45] left in her sins? If that be so, then
[20:49] it's later than you think. If not, then
[20:52] there's coming one with the message that
[20:55] straight on the Bible. A quick work will
[20:58] circle the earth. That was in 1962.
[21:02] Here what the prophet of God says here
[21:04] in the future home paragraph 198. As I
[21:08] prepare to close here, notice this is
[21:12] still not referred. This millennium
[21:14] reign, the thousand years is not the new
[21:17] earth. See, the millennium reign is a
[21:21] different reign. That's what we go into
[21:25] the millennium. But that isn't the new
[21:27] earth, the new heaven. No, no, that's
[21:30] just a rest place. See, a rest period.
[21:35] Not at all the new heavens and the new
[21:37] earth. For you see, in the millennium,
[21:40] we have things that would not go into
[21:42] that. It's a type of the old seventh day
[21:45] out of Eden. The seventh day after he
[21:49] made the world, the seventh day he
[21:51] rested in Eden and the millennium.
[21:56] Brother Brandon brings it like this in
[21:58] one place. He says that the marriage
[22:01] ceremony is taking place now.
[22:05] The wedding supper, the marriage supper
[22:08] takes place over in heaven, that other
[22:12] dimension for three and a half years.
[22:15] Then we come back on the earth for the
[22:17] honeymoon a thousand years. That's that
[22:21] rest period.
[22:23] Some of us look a little tired.
[22:26] We can use a rest. Fighting off devils
[22:29] every day. fighting people a little trap
[22:31] set after running for my I'm singing the
[22:34] song I'm running for my life I'm running
[22:37] for my life if you stop anywhere Satan
[22:40] will get you
[22:41] &gt;&gt; but in that millennium will rule and
[22:43] reign
[22:44] &gt;&gt; and Satan will be bound could you
[22:47] imagine a week without Satan
[22:50] &gt;&gt; well think about a thousand years
[22:53] &gt;&gt; amen that's where we're going
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen
[22:58] question they ask brother Brandham in
[22:59] the message questions and answers.
[23:02] Brother Brandon, will there be any
[23:03] children born during the millennium
[23:05] thousand years millennium 1,00 years
[23:08] reign of Christ here on the earth? Or
[23:10] will there be any sign of earth, any
[23:13] sin, pardon me, on the earth during that
[23:16] time? Will there be people on the earth
[23:18] in corporal bodies during that time?
[23:21] That's the question. Now, will children
[23:23] be born during the thousand years
[23:26] millennium reign? That's the question in
[23:28] my mind that I told you the other day. I
[23:31] don't know. It looks a whole lot lot
[23:34] like it could be. It looks a whole lot
[23:36] like it couldn't be. I'm going to be as
[23:39] honest with you as I know how to be. I
[23:41] don't know. To this time, if God ever
[23:44] reveals it, I will tell you. But wait,
[23:47] it has to come from God. You're my
[23:49] children. I wouldn't tell you. I don't
[23:51] know whether there'll be or whether
[23:53] there will not be. I can't say. or will
[23:57] there be sin on the earth during that
[23:59] time? No, there will not be no sin on
[24:02] earth. Satan is bound. Can somebody say
[24:05] amen?
[24:06] &gt;&gt; I just want to release out a great
[24:08] hallelujah right there.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Where there is no sin in the millennium.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Once you get there, won't you meet me
[24:19] there in the great millennium? There
[24:21] will be no sin there.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:24] Or will there be sin on the earth during
[24:26] that time? No, there will not be no sin
[24:28] on earth. Satan is bound.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; And will there be people on the earth in
[24:34] corporal bodies during that time? Yes,
[24:36] sir. We will have our glorified body
[24:40] right here on the earth, eating,
[24:43] drinking, building houses, and living
[24:46] just like we do now for a thousand
[24:49] years. It's the honeymoon of the bride
[24:53] and groom.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[24:56] &gt;&gt; I got two more I want to read.
[25:00] Number 392. Question 392. The church age
[25:03] ending and has blacked out. The bride is
[25:06] called. We have already entered into the
[25:08] Have we already entered into the
[25:10] tribulation period? Someone is asking.
[25:13] Brother Banner answers this. 1964. No.
[25:16] No. No. I wish that I could just have
[25:20] more time on that. See, the bride when
[25:22] she's taken from the earth, from the
[25:24] church, then the church age will cease.
[25:27] Leodia goes into chaos. The bride goes
[25:31] to glory and the tribulation period sets
[25:34] in upon the sleeping virgin for three
[25:36] and a half years while Israel is getting
[25:39] its prophecy. Then tribulation sets in
[25:43] upon Israel. And then comes the battle
[25:45] of Armageddon, which destroys all
[25:48] things. And then the bride returns back
[25:51] with the groom for a thousand years, the
[25:54] millennium reign. After that comes the
[25:57] white throne judgment. After that comes
[25:59] the new heavens and the new earth and
[26:02] the new city coming down from God out of
[26:05] heaven. Eternity and time blends
[26:08] together.
[26:11] In the invisible union of Christ, the
[26:14] prophet says this, if the musicians will
[26:16] come, please.
[26:22] Paragraph number 34.
[26:29] Saints, we have so much more to look
[26:31] forward to
[26:33] &gt;&gt; than what the news is telling you.
[26:39] We have so much more to look forward to
[26:42] &gt;&gt; than your own personal issues at this
[26:45] present time.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; How many of us have are going through
[26:49] something? All of us. All of us.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; All of us broken dream, broken promise.
[26:54] We wanted this to happen that didn't
[26:56] work out. We wish we' have more of this
[26:58] or less of that. We wish this. We wish
[27:01] this was in order. We wish I had all of
[27:03] that taken care of. But we have more to
[27:06] look forward to than perhaps we realize.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; And the scriptures
[27:11] point it all out to us.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; This is just a very small portion of
[27:18] your life. What's going on right now?
[27:20] It'll soon all be over and you will
[27:23] forget about all of this
[27:26] &gt;&gt; and all of the stress and the tears
[27:30] &gt;&gt; and the problems and the troubles to
[27:34] wipe them all away
[27:37] &gt;&gt; in that new home.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[27:40] &gt;&gt; we're going to that place.
[27:42] &gt;&gt; It's a reality.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:47] Invisible union. He says this, "And we
[27:49] know that history is closing out. The
[27:52] world's history will soon be over. Then
[27:55] we're going to step into a new day to
[27:58] the great millennium." That as one
[28:00] believer, I believe in the millennium, a
[28:03] millennium reign with Christ, a thousand
[28:06] years upon the earth, the physical
[28:08] return of our Lord Jesus to take a
[28:12] physical people glorified by his
[28:15] cleansing blood. Amen. Let's pray.
[28:19] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your uh
[28:22] this portion of your word today. I pray,
[28:25] Father, that it'll resonate in our
[28:27] hearts as we prepare to hear about this
[28:30] future home as uh as we come to that
[28:34] part of the service, Lord.
[28:36] We we want to take some time and praise
[28:39] you and worship you and offer the
[28:42] sacrifice of praise, the fruits of our
[28:45] lips, giving thanks to you. Lord, bless
[28:49] this service today. Bless our worship.
[28:52] May you receive our little offering, our
[28:54] little sacrifice, our little time that
[28:57] we've set aside to present it to you.
[29:01] You're the righteous and the holy one.
[29:03] You alone receive worship and it's you
[29:07] alone that we bow down to worship. And
[29:10] father, may each one prepare their
[29:13] hearts to give that over to you today as
[29:16] our prayer. Thank you for the word of
[29:18] God. Thank you for these promises. It's
[29:20] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[29:23] Lord, I believe the Bible is true. I
[29:25] believe these promises are true. I feel
[29:28] it in my spirit. I'm longing for it,
[29:31] Lord. So today I want to live knowing
[29:34] that that future home just lays right up
[29:37] ahead of the road and grant it. Father
[29:39] we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you. The musicians can play
[29:47] their prelude music. God bless you.

[36:28] Oh, I will enter his gaze with
[36:32] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[36:37] his voice with praise.

[38:14] microphone, Sean, but I left them in the
[38:16] back room. So, if you could bring them
[38:18] to me and then use one of them to open
[38:20] our service with a word of prayer, that
[38:21] would be wonderful. He has made me glad.
[38:26] Yes, he has made me glad. I will rejoice
[38:30] for he has made me glad.
[38:35] Yes, he has made me glad.
[38:39] He has made me glad.

[38:47] [Music]
[38:50] Happy to be here this morning.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's talk to our Lord Jesus.
[38:55] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just
[38:59] come to you with
[39:01] worship and thanksgiving, oh God, for
[39:03] just all you've done, Lord. Lord, we
[39:06] just ask that you'd speak to our hearts
[39:08] this morning, Father. Lord,
[39:11] Lord, let us hear from heaven this
[39:12] morning, Lord. Lord, we just ask that
[39:15] you would just walk the aisles, Lord,
[39:17] and just just fill us with another
[39:20] double portion of your spirit, Lord.
[39:26] Lord, we just love you so much, Lord.
[39:29] Lord, you gave us these hands, Lord. You
[39:30] gave us our bodies, Lord, and we give
[39:32] them back to you, Lord. Lord, we just
[39:34] ask you forgive us of anywhere we've
[39:38] fallen short this week, Lord.
[39:42] And we ask all these things in Jesus
[39:44] Christ's name.
[39:50] We bring the sacrifice of praise
[39:54] into the house
[39:57] of the Lord.
[40:01] Yes, we bring the sacrifice of praise
[40:07] into the house
[40:09] of the Lord.
[40:13] Let me offer up to you
[40:19] the sacrificees
[40:21] [Music]
[40:23] of thanksgiving
[40:25] and we offer up to you
[40:31] the sacriice.
[40:34] Let's sing that one more time to bring
[40:37] that sacrifice. We bring the sacrifice
[40:41] and praise
[40:43] into the house
[40:46] of the Lord.
[40:50] Yes, we bring the sacrifice of praise
[40:55] into the house
[40:58] of the Lord.
[41:00] [Music]
[41:02] And we offer
[41:04] up to you
[41:07] the sacrifice
[41:11] of thanksgiving
[41:14] that we offer
[41:16] unto you. This the verse says, "I come
[41:22] into your presence, past the gates of
[41:25] praise,
[41:26] into your sanctuary till we're standing
[41:29] face to face." And just thinking about
[41:31] that,
[41:33] the gates of praise. And you know, we we
[41:36] don't have the same type of cities that
[41:38] they that they had that we read about in
[41:41] the Old Testament. But the only way in
[41:42] was through those gates.
[41:44] And I think that's something that to
[41:47] think about that we want in his
[41:48] presence. We're going to make that
[41:50] sacrifice of praise. And and he wants
[41:54] us. He inhabits the praises of his
[41:56] people. But we can't just come to him on
[41:59] our terms. So, let's just let him know
[42:02] this morning how much we appreciate him.
[42:04] I think anybody that's a parent here,
[42:06] you know, when your children come and
[42:08] they tell you something that you're the
[42:09] best, that you know how great you are,
[42:12] how it just melts your heart. You want
[42:14] to do something special for him. And I
[42:16] think that's that's the way that
[42:19] he deserves it. We need to tell him,
[42:21] Lord, we just we love you so much.
[42:23] You're so good to us. Amen. And let's
[42:26] just let's just make him welcome this
[42:29] morning. We know he's here, but let's
[42:31] make him welcome. Let's make him our
[42:32] guest of honor today.
[42:35] As I come into your presence,
[42:41] past the gates of praise,
[42:45] into your sanctuary,
[42:49] till we're standing face to face.
[42:54] I look upon your countenance.
[42:58] I see the fullness of your face.
[43:03] I can only bow down
[43:07] and say
[43:10] [Music]
[43:11] you are awesome in this place. Mighty
[43:18] God,
[43:22] you are awesome in this place
[43:26] of the Father.
[43:31] You are worthy of all praise.
[43:36] To you our lives we raise.
[43:41] You are awesome in this place. Mighty
[43:46] God,
[43:48] yes you are awesome in this place.
[43:55] Mighty God,
[43:59] you are awesome in this place
[44:04] of a father.
[44:08] You are worthy of all praise.
[44:14] To you our lives we raise.
[44:18] You are awesome in this place.
[44:22] Mighty God. Yes, he's worthy of our
[44:25] praise. You are worthy of all praise.
[44:33] To you our lives we raise.
[44:37] You are awesome in this place.
[44:42] Mighty God.
[44:47] Hallelujah.
[44:50] Let's go to the key of Jes.
[44:55] On a hill
[44:57] far away,
[45:00] there stood a
[45:03] rugged cross,
[45:06] the emblem
[45:09] of suffering
[45:12] and shame.
[45:14] Oh, I love that old cross.
[45:17] How I love
[45:20] that old cross
[45:22] where the dearest
[45:26] and best
[45:28] for a world
[45:31] of lost sinners
[45:34] was slain.
[45:36] [Music]
[45:39] And so I'll cherish
[45:42] the old
[45:45] rugged cross
[45:50] until my trophies
[45:53] at last I lay down.

[46:04] to the old rugged cross
[46:11] and I'll exchange
[46:14] it someday
[46:16] for a crown.
[46:23] Oh, that old
[46:26] rugged cross
[46:28] so despised
[46:31] by the world
[46:34] has a wonderous
[46:37] attraction
[46:39] for me.
[46:44] For the dear
[46:47] lamb of God
[46:50] left his glory
[46:53] above
[46:56] to bear
[46:58] to dark calary.
[47:06] Oh, I'll cherish
[47:09] the old rugged
[47:12] cross
[47:17] until my trophies
[47:20] at last I lay down.
[47:28] Oh, I will cling
[47:31] to the old ruged
[47:34] cross.
[47:38] And all exchange
[47:41] is someday
[47:43] for
[47:45] a crown
[47:47] in the old rugged cross. And in the old
[47:52] rugged cross
[47:55] stained with blood
[47:58] so divine.
[48:01] A wonderous
[48:04] beauty
[48:06] I see.
[48:08] [Music]
[48:11] For it was on
[48:14] that old cross
[48:17] Jesus suffered
[48:20] and died
[48:22] to pardon
[48:25] and sanify
[48:28] me.
[48:33] Oh, I'll cherish
[48:36] the old rugged
[48:39] cross
[48:43] until my trophies
[48:47] are last. I lay down.
[48:52] [Music]
[48:54] Yes, I will cling
[48:57] to the old rugged
[49:01] cross
[49:03] [Music]
[49:05] and all the exchange
[49:08] is someday
[49:10] for let's sing the last verse to the old
[49:13] rugged cross I'll ever be true. Yes to
[49:16] the old
[49:19] rugged cross.
[49:22] I will ever
[49:25] be true.
[49:28] It shame
[49:30] and reproach
[49:32] gladly bear.
[49:37] Oh then you'll call
[49:40] me someday
[49:43] to my home.
[49:46] tomorrow. Oh, what a day that'll be.
[49:49] Where is glory?
[49:52] Forever
[49:54] I'll share.
[50:00] All cherish
[50:03] the old rugged
[50:05] cross

[50:24] to the old rugged
[50:27] cross

[53:06] Israel this morning. Did you enjoy that
[53:09] children? Yes. So good. And getting

[53:21] offering.
[53:23] And
[53:25] I'm going to take the prayer request now
[53:29] in prayer. I'm missing the snows. I got
[53:31] to see sister Laura Laura for the first
[53:33] time in a few months there. It's just so
[53:35] good to see him, but I'm missing this
[53:36] morning. So remember sister Laura,
[53:38] brother Randy, and the family and her
[53:40] recovery.
[53:41] Missing the Figaroas and their moves. So
[53:44] we want to hold them up uh in prayer.

[54:18] can do. Is there anything I'm missing
[54:20] this morning that you'd like to uh
[54:22] mention?
[54:24] Or maybe just hold up a hand to the the
[54:26] master this morning. Say, "Lord,

[54:31] loved ones." Dear God, we're so thankful
[54:32] to be in church this morning to to
[54:34] worship your majesty. We know you're the
[54:36] sooncoming king and not just a duty to
[54:39] be here, Lord. We know that is an
[54:41] expectation, but we are we're told that
[54:45] if two or three would just gather in
[54:47] your name, you'd be there, Lord. And we
[54:48] believe you're walking these very
[54:50] aisles. And pray that you look down on
[54:52] each one, each need. Lord, we find all
[54:54] of our answers in the word of God, Lord.
[54:57] Your perfect will is what we want in our
[54:59] lives. So, help us to understand and to
[55:02] know that to be bold and courageous to
[55:04] follow the very will uh your will, Lord,

[55:19] miss them this morning. Just pray you'd
[55:20] help her through her recovery. Uh

[55:57] and and be content with where you've
[55:59] placed us and with all that we have,
[56:01] Lord, knowing that we're your children
[56:03] in the final, this last age, Lord, where
[56:06] your coming is very soon. May we get
[56:08] ready. We bring tithes and offerings,
[56:10] Lord, as a sacrifice as well, a
[56:12] sacrifice of praise as cheerful givers,
[56:14] Lord, and thankfulness. Just love and
[56:16] appreciate each one in their precious
[56:19] name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord
[56:21] Jesus Christ. All God's people say,

[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:02:41] Amen. You can remain seated and we'll
[1:02:43] just uh sing a song that we all know.
[1:02:45] It's a little faster song than we
[1:02:47] normally sing when we change the order
[1:02:49] of the service. But just thinking about
[1:02:51] what we were hearing in the Sunday
[1:02:53] school today and what we have to look
[1:02:54] forward to with Satan being bound a
[1:02:57] thousand years and and and we're going
[1:03:00] to hear about our new home this morning.
[1:03:03] It we should be shouting. We should be
[1:03:05] excited and that we just want to sing
[1:03:06] that song. We all get to heaven. What a
[1:03:08] day of rejoicing that'll be. Amen.
[1:03:12] Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Oh,
[1:03:17] sing his mercy
[1:03:21] and his grace
[1:03:23] in the mansion bright and blessed.
[1:03:29] He'll prepare for us a place.
[1:03:33] When we all
[1:03:36] get to heaven.
[1:03:38] Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will
[1:03:42] be.
[1:03:44] Oh, when we all
[1:03:47] see Jesus,
[1:03:50] we will sing and we'll shout the
[1:03:53] victory.
[1:03:56] Oh, while we walk the hill,
[1:04:02] clouds will over spread the sky.
[1:04:08] But when traveling
[1:04:11] days are over,
[1:04:13] there'll be not a shadow, not a sigh.
[1:04:18] Oh, when we all
[1:04:21] get to heaven.
[1:04:24] Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will
[1:04:27] be.
[1:04:29] Yes. When we all
[1:04:32] see Jesus,
[1:04:36] we'll sing and we'll shout the victory.
[1:04:42] Let us then be true and faithful,
[1:04:48] trusting, serving every.
[1:04:53] Yes, just one glimpse of him in glory.
[1:04:59] Will the toils of life remain?
[1:05:04] And when we all
[1:05:07] get to heaven,
[1:05:10] what a day of rejoicing ever
[1:05:15] when we all
[1:05:18] see Jesus.
[1:05:21] We're going to sing and we'll shout the
[1:05:24] victory.
[1:05:27] Hold on to the right.
[1:05:34] Soon you will be
[1:05:39] soon
[1:05:42] gates open.
[1:05:45] We shall spread the streets of gold.
[1:05:50] May we all
[1:05:53] get to hell.
[1:05:55] Oh, what a day of rejoicing that will
[1:05:59] be.
[1:06:02] When we all see Jesus,
[1:06:07] we'll sing and we'll shout for victory.
[1:06:11] Let's sing that verse. Let us be true.
[1:06:14] Let us in
[1:06:17] [Music]
[1:06:19] truth
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:32] of life.
[1:06:36] Oh,
[1:06:38] get to heaven.
[1:06:41] Oh, by the day of rejoicing there.
[1:06:46] Yes, we all
[1:06:50] see Jes
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:06:55] over time with all your
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:03] What a day.
[1:07:05] What a day.
[1:07:15] We will sing and
[1:07:19] let us be sure and faithful with all
[1:07:21] your heart. Let us invite
[1:07:25] [Applause]
[1:07:30] [Music]
[1:07:34] glimpse.
[1:07:36] Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] Will
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:42] we
[1:07:44] fall? When we fall
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:51] a rejoicing that will be
[1:07:55] when we all
[1:07:58] see Jesus
[1:08:01] with us. Let's stand.
[1:08:04] Just put those hands together. Let the
[1:08:06] musicians play.
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:27] the victory.
[1:08:29] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:08:33] Amen.
[1:08:34] God bless you, saints. Oh my. So glad to
[1:08:39] be in the house of the Lord once again.
[1:08:41] As one preacher said, we're in the land
[1:08:44] of the dying on our way to the land of
[1:08:47] the living.
[1:08:49] And that's where we're headed, to the
[1:08:51] land where we'll never grow old. There
[1:08:54] won't be no cemeteries over there. Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; And we're going to hear about that
[1:09:00] beautiful city to come. It puts a smile
[1:09:02] on my face.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; That's the best deal you gonna get.
[1:09:07] Eternal life. God bless you so much.

[1:10:45] things are possible.

[1:10:50] All
[1:10:52] Lord I believe.
[1:10:55] Lord,
[1:10:58] help me to believe. Lord,
[1:11:01] Lord,
[1:11:03] I believe
[1:11:06] that all things are possible.
[1:11:12] Lord,
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe,
[1:11:18] Lord,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; I believe you. I believe your word,
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:11:26] I believe
[1:11:29] all things are possible
[1:11:35] Lord I believe.
[1:11:39] Let's remain standing for the reading of
[1:11:41] the word and after brother Rand reads
[1:11:42] that scripture you may be seated. God
[1:11:44] bless you.
[1:11:55] Second Peter 3.
[1:11:58] This second epistle, beloved, I now
[1:12:00] write unto you in both which I stir up
[1:12:03] your pure minds by the way of
[1:12:05] remembrance,
[1:12:07] that ye may be mindful of the words
[1:12:10] which were spoken before by the holy
[1:12:13] prophets and of the commandments of us
[1:12:17] the apostles
[1:12:19] of the Lord and Savior, knowing this
[1:12:22] first that there shall come in the last
[1:12:24] days scoffers walking after their own
[1:12:27] lust.
[1:12:28] and saying, "Where is the promise of his
[1:12:31] coming?"
[1:12:33] If that don't meet this infidel woman,
[1:12:35] and
[1:12:38] since the fathers fell asleep, all
[1:12:40] things continue as they were from the
[1:12:44] beginning of the creation.
[1:12:47] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:12:52] that by the word of God the heavens were
[1:12:55] of old and the earth standing out of the
[1:12:59] water and in the water. Whereby the
[1:13:02] world that then was being overflowed
[1:13:05] with water perished.
[1:13:08] But the heavens and the earth, which now
[1:13:10] are by the same word, are kept in store,
[1:13:14] reserve unto fire against the day of
[1:13:16] judgment, and the predition of ungodly
[1:13:19] man. But beloved, be not ignorant of
[1:13:22] this one thing, that one day is with the
[1:13:26] Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand
[1:13:29] years as one day. Now the Lord is not
[1:13:32] slack concerning his promise as some man
[1:13:35] counts slackness, but is longsuffering
[1:13:40] to usward, not willing that any should
[1:13:42] perish, but that all might come to
[1:13:44] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[1:13:47] come as a thief in the night, in which
[1:13:50] the heavens and the earth with a great
[1:13:53] noise shall pass away with a great
[1:13:56] noise, and the elements shall melt with
[1:13:59] fervent heat, and the earth also, and
[1:14:02] the works that are therein shall burn
[1:14:05] up. Seeing then that all these things
[1:14:09] shall be dissolved,
[1:14:11] what manner of person ought we to be in
[1:14:14] all holy conversation and godliness,
[1:14:18] looking for the hastening unto the
[1:14:21] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[1:14:24] heavens being on fire shall be
[1:14:27] dissolved, and the elements shall melt
[1:14:28] with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[1:14:31] according to his promise look for new
[1:14:35] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[1:14:39] righteousness. Wherefore, beloved,
[1:14:41] seeing that we look for such things,
[1:14:46] be diligent that you may not be found
[1:14:49] may be found of him in peace without
[1:14:52] spot, without blemish, and accounting
[1:14:55] that the longsuffering of the Lord is
[1:14:58] salvation, even as our beloved Paul,
[1:15:02] according to the wisdom given unto him,
[1:15:05] has written unto you,
[1:15:09] as also
[1:15:10] all his epistles, speaking in them of
[1:15:14] the things which are sometimes hard to
[1:15:18] be understood, which they that are
[1:15:22] unlearned and unstable wrestle rest as
[1:15:27] as they do also the other scriptures
[1:15:31] unto their own destruction.
[1:15:35] Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know
[1:15:37] these things before, beware lest ye also
[1:15:42] being led away with error of the wicked,
[1:15:45] fall from your steadfastness. But grow
[1:15:49] in grace in the knowledge of the Lord
[1:15:52] and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory
[1:15:55] both now and forever. Amen. Now in the
[1:15:59] the revelation of Christ in the 21st
[1:16:04] chapter, I read these words.
[1:16:08] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:16:12] For the first heaven and the first earth
[1:16:14] were passed away, and there were no more
[1:16:17] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the
[1:16:20] new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
[1:16:23] of heaven, prepared as a bride adored
[1:16:25] for her husband.
[1:16:27] And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[1:16:29] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[1:16:31] is with man, and he shall dwell with
[1:16:33] them, and they shall be his people, and
[1:16:35] God himself shall be with them, and be
[1:16:38] their God, and God shall wipe away all
[1:16:41] tears from their eyes. And there shall
[1:16:44] be no more death, neither sorrowing nor
[1:16:47] crying, neither should there be any more
[1:16:49] pain, for the former things have passed
[1:16:52] away." And he that sat upon the throne
[1:16:54] said, "Behold, I make all things new."
[1:16:57] He said unto me, "Write, for these words
[1:17:00] are true and faithful." And he said unto
[1:17:03] me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega,
[1:17:08] the beginning and the end. And I will
[1:17:10] give unto him that is a thirst of the
[1:17:12] fountains of the water uh of life
[1:17:16] freely. He that overcometh shall inherit
[1:17:19] all things and I will be his God and he
[1:17:22] shall be my son. Let us pray again. Lord
[1:17:25] Jesus with such a promise
[1:17:29] and such stern talk as Jesus himself and
[1:17:32] the apostle has given us concerning the
[1:17:35] hour we are approaching.
[1:17:38] Give us, oh Lord, thy direction
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; that we might know how to approach it in
[1:17:45] the right way because it's coming. We
[1:17:48] know the scriptures must be fulfilled
[1:17:53] and so shall it be. Now, Lord, we ask
[1:17:56] your mercy again upon us all as we study
[1:17:58] thy word. Be with us and unfold it to
[1:18:01] us, Lord. For we asked it in Jesus name.
[1:18:04] Amen.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be seated.
[1:18:12] Now,
[1:18:14] I wonder if there could be a way that
[1:18:16] perhaps maybe they could turn the lights
[1:18:18] from the main auditorium off and just
[1:18:21] leave them on the platform here, which
[1:18:23] would probably be better, and take some
[1:18:25] of the current. We uh about burn up a
[1:18:27] transformer the other night and if the
[1:18:29] uh uh custodian will do that for us, we
[1:18:32] appreciate turn the bottom lights, the
[1:18:35] main auditorium lights off and then I
[1:18:38] think you'll have plenty of room to see
[1:18:40] the right. Now
[1:18:43] the subject again to announce it that we
[1:18:45] are approaching
[1:18:48] the the subject of the future home of
[1:18:52] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:18:55] bride.
[1:18:56] Now as it's been I'm just going to have
[1:18:59] to do this. It's just too hot
[1:19:03] as as
[1:19:05] we are I know my wife don't like me to
[1:19:07] do that but that take my coat off. It's
[1:19:08] just too hot up here. you got air out
[1:19:10] there. It's just cut off in a little
[1:19:12] pin.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Now in the um in the future or in the
[1:19:18] past rather, we have studied the seven
[1:19:21] seals, the seven churches, brother veil,
[1:19:23] and those are working upon those now
[1:19:25] faithfully to get them in book form.
[1:19:29] And seeing all these mysterious things
[1:19:31] that we have seen come to pass.
[1:19:34] Then I think after understanding that in
[1:19:37] the hour that we're living in and the
[1:19:40] position there's no one that would want
[1:19:43] to sit down real sensibly and examine
[1:19:48] what has been spoken of and what is
[1:19:51] promised to happen and what has
[1:19:53] happened. But what could say that those
[1:19:56] things are fulfilled?
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said he would do. He
[1:20:01] did it just exactly to the letter.
[1:20:04] Now I think in this that not knowing
[1:20:07] what time that the Lord Jesus might
[1:20:10] appear
[1:20:12] uh I thought it would be good it seemed
[1:20:14] pleasing to the Holy Spirit that we
[1:20:16] speak on this and and maybe come back to
[1:20:18] it again two or three times because I
[1:20:20] won't have quite ample time to get all
[1:20:23] this out as where you hit a a subject
[1:20:26] that might be a little stumbling to
[1:20:28] someone. You can't carry it all the way
[1:20:29] out to make it plain. Then you come back
[1:20:32] again to catch the next subject. And
[1:20:34] then later on in the if the Lord
[1:20:36] willing, we come into the 12 seals not
[1:20:39] pardon me the 12th chapter of
[1:20:41] Revelations which lays between the
[1:20:43] coming of the Lord and the ending of the
[1:20:45] trumpets and so forth. We'll try to
[1:20:47] bring that back to show who's Satan and
[1:20:50] what he did, where he come from, what's
[1:20:52] his purpose, and how that his great
[1:20:54] beauty that was given caused his fall,
[1:20:57] his deceit causes the fall beauty. Then
[1:21:01] how that the impossibility for any man
[1:21:04] that wants to look at it, right? That's
[1:21:05] serpent seed.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; I'd make a challenge to that to anybody
[1:21:10] see that would want to look at it with
[1:21:12] with absolutely common understanding. a
[1:21:15] child can see it thing. Now, and we'll
[1:21:18] get to that later. Now, we understand
[1:21:21] here that these two scriptures, the
[1:21:25] reason I read second Peter, the third
[1:21:28] chapter, and compared it with
[1:21:29] Revelations 21, um they u both here are
[1:21:35] speaking uh uh the same subject, but
[1:21:39] John never never wrote it out like Peter
[1:21:43] did. See, we understand that this great
[1:21:48] home of the bride is to be here on
[1:21:51] earth.
[1:21:53] And now if you read just like 21 chap
[1:21:58] 21st chapter of revelations, the apostle
[1:22:00] here said or the prophet said that I saw
[1:22:04] a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:22:06] Sounds like there comes a annihilation.
[1:22:11] Now way I always find my messages is by
[1:22:15] prayer. I'll be sitting in prayer and
[1:22:18] something reveals to me and I'll wait on
[1:22:22] a few minutes and see if it's right.
[1:22:24] Then I feel it closer and then sometimes
[1:22:27] I keep waiting till it breaks into a
[1:22:30] vision. But when it begins to come and
[1:22:33] I'm satisfied it comes from God then I
[1:22:36] go to the scripture. See, that is a
[1:22:39] thought to be the confirmation of every
[1:22:41] spiritual thing that's done because the
[1:22:44] Bible is the complete revelation of
[1:22:48] Jesus Christ. It is his body. And now
[1:22:55] in that maybe I find a place in the
[1:22:57] scripture that doesn't sound just right.
[1:23:00] I wonder I go back again to prayer. It
[1:23:03] comes again.
[1:23:05] Then I then I begin to to examine my
[1:23:07] scripture. Now our Bible is wrote in
[1:23:09] English. In English words change all the
[1:23:12] time. For instance, like St. John 14
[1:23:15] said, "In my father's house is many
[1:23:17] mansions."
[1:23:18] A mansion in a house.
[1:23:21] Well, then you what to do with that?
[1:23:23] Then run it back to the u to the uh
[1:23:26] original and see what James meant or go
[1:23:30] back to the Hebrew or to the Greek from
[1:23:32] the first translation. And in there it
[1:23:35] says, "In my father's kingdom is many
[1:23:37] palaces."
[1:23:39] Well, then you come back to the time
[1:23:41] that the translators translated for King
[1:23:43] James, the kingdom was called in English
[1:23:47] a house. And uh the king was the father
[1:23:50] over his delegates. There's the reason
[1:23:53] they translate in my father's house is
[1:23:56] many mansions. See, and then you get
[1:23:59] those words and you have to hunt them
[1:24:01] up. Then you see from that inspiration
[1:24:04] this pull pit this morning I say not one
[1:24:06] time has it ever been nothing but
[1:24:08] straight the scripture
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; that's how serpent seed and all these
[1:24:12] other things come see but and it's
[1:24:14] really if a fellow would just read and
[1:24:16] say in my father's house many mentions
[1:24:18] if you didn't stop to study praying
[1:24:21] you'd be all confused see but just keep
[1:24:23] praying
[1:24:25] God always makes it right if it comes
[1:24:28] from God now John explains means the
[1:24:32] change and the come how it comes about
[1:24:35] he doesn't explain it rather but Peter
[1:24:37] does John said I saw new heavens and new
[1:24:40] earth first heavens and first earth has
[1:24:42] passed away there was no more sea I John
[1:24:44] saw the holy city coming down from God
[1:24:46] out of heaven prepared as a bride adored
[1:24:49] for her husband but we turn back to
[1:24:52] second Peter now to find out Peter
[1:24:54] explains how this process will come
[1:24:56] about now if you look at what John said
[1:24:59] it sound like for the first heavens and
[1:25:01] first earth was passed away,
[1:25:03] annihilated. See, and that sounds very
[1:25:06] strange. So, that's what struck me. And
[1:25:09] I begin to look for the word pass away.
[1:25:13] And now, but it's clear that both of
[1:25:16] these apostles and prophet were talking
[1:25:19] of the same thing. And now also in the
[1:25:22] book of Isaiah now that you want to put
[1:25:26] these scriptures down in Isaiah 65:17
[1:25:30] Isaiah speaking of the millennium
[1:25:34] that thousand years of rest for the for
[1:25:36] the people of God. Isaiah spoke of it
[1:25:39] and he said I there was a uh all the
[1:25:42] former things that passed away and how
[1:25:44] they'll build houses and have them and
[1:25:47] we had time maybe we just take time.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and read this just a minute.
[1:25:52] Isaiah 65 and let's just read for a few
[1:25:55] minutes here. And here it is right for
[1:25:57] us now to begin. Isaiah 65:17.
[1:26:01] And behold, I create new heavens and a
[1:26:05] new earth.
[1:26:07] Now, Isaiah the prophet was one of the
[1:26:11] prophets that wrote exactly the entire
[1:26:14] Bible in his prophecy.
[1:26:17] He starts out with the creation in the
[1:26:19] middle of his book about the 40th
[1:26:21] chapter comes around John the Baptist
[1:26:24] the New Testament and winds up here in
[1:26:27] his book in the revelations in the
[1:26:28] millennium. There's 66 books in the
[1:26:31] Bible and the 66 chapters in Isaiah. He
[1:26:34] wrote a complete commentary. Now we find
[1:26:37] out you're now getting the 65th chapter.
[1:26:39] One more chapter and he speaks of the
[1:26:42] millennium. Notice it. How beautiful.
[1:26:47] Behold, I create new heaven and new
[1:26:50] earth. And the former thing shall not be
[1:26:53] re remembered or come into mind. It's
[1:26:57] the pass away. But believe be ye glad
[1:27:00] and rejoice even in that which I've
[1:27:02] created. For behold, I create Jerusalem
[1:27:05] a rejoice
[1:27:07] and her people of joy. And I will
[1:27:09] rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my
[1:27:11] people. and the voice of weeping shall
[1:27:13] be no more heard in her for nor the
[1:27:16] voice of crying. There shall be no more
[1:27:20] thence infinite days in an old man that
[1:27:22] is not fulfill his days. For a child
[1:27:24] shall die 100 years old, and a sinner
[1:27:27] being 100 years old shall be accused.
[1:27:31] Then shall and they shall build houses
[1:27:35] and inhabit them.
[1:27:38] And they shall plant vineyards and shall
[1:27:40] eat the fruit of them. And they shall
[1:27:43] not build and another inhabit. That is
[1:27:45] your farm. Your son fall heir to it or
[1:27:48] some of your heirs. They shall not plant
[1:27:52] and another eat there. They do their own
[1:27:54] planting and remain there. They got life
[1:27:57] eternal. For as the days of a tree are
[1:28:00] the days of my people, and my law my
[1:28:02] elect shall long enjoy the works of
[1:28:06] their hands. They shall not labor in
[1:28:08] vain or bring forth for trouble. For
[1:28:10] they are the seed of the blessed of the
[1:28:12] Lord and their offsprings with them. Now
[1:28:16] shares where I'm going to get to while
[1:28:18] and it shall come to pass that before
[1:28:21] they call, I will answer.
[1:28:27] And while they're yet speaking, I'll
[1:28:29] hear, and the wolf and the lamb shall
[1:28:31] feed together,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; and the lion shall eat straw like a
[1:28:36] bullock. Dust shall be the serpent's
[1:28:38] beat, and they shall not hurt or
[1:28:39] destroy, and all my holy mountain,
[1:28:43] sayeth the Lord.
[1:28:45] What a promise
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; of these prophets and great sages,
[1:28:51] teachers of the Bible way back in
[1:28:54] ancient days seeing this glorious day
[1:28:57] come.
[1:28:59] By these passages, one might think or be
[1:29:02] led rather to believe that the whole
[1:29:06] planet of this earth will be destroyed.
[1:29:09] I make a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:29:12] that the heavens will be gone and the
[1:29:14] earth will be gone completely
[1:29:16] annihilated.
[1:29:18] But a close study and with the help of
[1:29:21] the Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of
[1:29:24] this. And that's what we're going into.
[1:29:29] It is only the atmospheres around it and
[1:29:33] the sin that's up on the earth that will
[1:29:36] be destroyed.
[1:29:38] Now we realize that the heavens means
[1:29:40] the atmosphere is above.
[1:29:43] What does it do?
[1:29:45] It uh then these thistles and sickness
[1:29:50] and death and politics and sinful man
[1:29:53] and sinful woman and evil spirits will
[1:29:56] all be gone away and annihilated.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; It has to be done that way because we
[1:30:04] are going to live right here. Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; We prove that by the Bible.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Right here's where we live.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Now notice thistles, germs, all of
[1:30:16] sicknesses and things will be completely
[1:30:19] uh taken away. All this its existence
[1:30:24] that's in the earth now, man-made
[1:30:27] systems, politics,
[1:30:30] sin, all kinds of evil spirits that the
[1:30:33] world is contaminated with in all the
[1:30:35] heavens above us. and your is
[1:30:36] contaminated with evil spirit.
[1:30:40] Are we going to go deep and long in
[1:30:42] this? See, all this exists in the
[1:30:44] heavens or atmospheres and the earth
[1:30:47] which is now
[1:30:51] this earth holds those things.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't made for that purpose. Sin
[1:30:58] caused it to be like that.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; It was made by God, the creator.
[1:31:04] But all and all of our bodies that we
[1:31:07] live in now was put on the earth when
[1:31:10] God created it
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; because you're out of the dust of the
[1:31:13] earth.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It was all laid out here. When God
[1:31:17] himself created, you were in his
[1:31:19] thinking
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and in him the great eternal was the
[1:31:24] thought which is his attribute.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And now sin caused all this to happen.
[1:31:30] And God through this age is gathering up
[1:31:33] his material.
[1:31:36] Satan is still here. That's the reason
[1:31:38] all these things happen. He's still
[1:31:39] here. And all of his evil forces are
[1:31:43] still here. Notice that's why the earth
[1:31:47] now is so filthy.
[1:31:49] That's why the scum and ridiculous
[1:31:52] things that goes on, bloodshed, war,
[1:31:55] politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of
[1:31:58] filthiness goes on is because that Satan
[1:32:01] is the ruler of this earth and this
[1:32:05] atmosphere.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; You say the atma. Yes, sir.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Both the heavens and earth now is
[1:32:12] contaminated with devils
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God.
[1:32:17] Jesus is there to intercede for us.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; See, while the accusers keep pointing a
[1:32:23] finger, they did this, they did this,
[1:32:24] they did this, but the blood still
[1:32:26] covers.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that elected that he
[1:32:31] foresaw. That's why it's so filthy
[1:32:34] today.
[1:32:36] Here, the apostle in second Peter here,
[1:32:38] the second chapter and the fifth and the
[1:32:41] and the fifth and sixth verse. Yes, I've
[1:32:43] got it. He refers to three stages of the
[1:32:47] earth. He he gets three stages of it.
[1:32:51] Notice how he brings them. The old world
[1:32:55] stood out of the water.
[1:32:59] Now that was the Antelovian world. Now
[1:33:02] the one it is, the present world we live
[1:33:04] in now, called it a world,
[1:33:07] the old world that stood out of water.
[1:33:09] Genesis 1:1.
[1:33:12] now and the world that is now present.
[1:33:16] And that again refers to another the
[1:33:18] world that is to come,
[1:33:21] the new world. Three worlds, three
[1:33:25] stages of the world.
[1:33:28] And notice how God makes plain to us his
[1:33:32] plan of redemption.
[1:33:36] Oh, this just thrilled my soul when I
[1:33:39] saw it.
[1:33:41] how he makes plain to us here now his
[1:33:44] plan of redemption. Now compare what we
[1:33:47] see with our own eyes what God has done
[1:33:50] to redeem his world. He's done the same
[1:33:53] plan to redeem his people.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; For the unchangeable God changes not any
[1:33:57] of his plans or anything.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] Such a glorious thing
[1:34:03] how he led us to himself to a a
[1:34:07] tabernacle in us by three stages of
[1:34:11] grace just like he's led the world in
[1:34:13] three stages to come to the world as God
[1:34:17] will come to the world after it's gone
[1:34:19] through three different uh stages
[1:34:24] of purification.
[1:34:26] That's exactly how he comes to us
[1:34:28] through three stages of grace.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; I taught that at the beginning. I've
[1:34:34] never changed since. It's God's word.
[1:34:37] You have to keep your threes together.
[1:34:39] Your sevens, your twelves, the
[1:34:41] pneumatics of the Bible must run perfect
[1:34:43] or you'll get your picture all mixed up.
[1:34:46] If you can't understand it, just keep
[1:34:47] praying. You watch it'll cut right in
[1:34:50] exactly. God is perfected in threes.
[1:34:55] Notice the old world the antalubian the
[1:34:58] world is present now and the one to
[1:35:00] come. Now first stage that he brings us
[1:35:05] to see his plan of redemption
[1:35:09] is exactly the same by everything.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; He uses the same method.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; He never changes.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; He said in Malachi 3, I am God and I
[1:35:21] change not.
[1:35:24] the way he does it. Therefore, if he
[1:35:26] saved the first man he ever saved by the
[1:35:29] shed blood of an innocent one, he'll
[1:35:30] have to save the next one and everyone
[1:35:32] he saves will have to be the same way.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; If he healed a man at any time through
[1:35:37] the journey of life, let it be in the
[1:35:39] days of Jesus, apostles, the prophets,
[1:35:42] whenever it was, when the same
[1:35:43] conditions is met, he's got to do it
[1:35:46] again.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; He doesn't change.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Man changes. Time changes, age changes,
[1:35:54] dispensation changes, but God remains
[1:35:56] the same.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's perfect. What a hope that give the
[1:36:01] sick people.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; If he ever healed a person, he has to do
[1:36:06] it again when the same conditions is
[1:36:08] met.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He ever saved a man,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; he's got to do it on the same grounds he
[1:36:15] did it the first time.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; If he ever filled a man with the Holy
[1:36:18] Ghost, he's got to do it on the same
[1:36:20] grounds he did the first time.
[1:36:23] If he ever raised a man up from the
[1:36:25] grave, he's got to do it the second time
[1:36:27] and every other time on the same
[1:36:28] principle.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Doesn't change.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a hope that gives me. What is
[1:36:35] it? Not in some man-made theory,
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; something that groups of man have come
[1:36:40] together, but his unchangeable word.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Is it the truth?" He said,
[1:36:46] "Let every man's word be a lie and mine
[1:36:49] be true.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; For heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:36:52] but my word shall never fail."
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; All scriptures given by inspiration.
[1:36:58] Therefore, it's good and profitable for
[1:36:59] doctrine. And remember that all
[1:37:02] scripture will be fulfilled.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. Notice how God makes it
[1:37:11] plain to us. And if that wasn't a a
[1:37:14] great confirmation, a good a great
[1:37:18] loving blessing from God. When I see
[1:37:21] this and see that since a boy, first
[1:37:25] time ever, Christ dealt with me, I've
[1:37:28] still always taught those three stages
[1:37:31] of grace.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Notice it isn't true. Now, now the first
[1:37:36] step is repentance
[1:37:39] towards God. And then follows after that
[1:37:43] is water baptism.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Water baptism. Repent and be baptized in
[1:37:48] the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; See water baptism follows showing that
[1:37:54] repentance was genuine
[1:37:57] or to remit our past sins. Now it has
[1:38:02] nothing to do with future sin.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; It only remits.
[1:38:09] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:38:11] Jesus Christ. What for? Remission
[1:38:16] taken away of past sin
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; has nothing to do with the future. Just
[1:38:22] your uh sin has been chopped off.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; What you did, you can't repent for what
[1:38:30] Adam done.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; You never done it. Adam did. You just
[1:38:35] get forgiveness for what you done.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The old nature is still there.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Let me take this board just a minute.
[1:38:54] Now,
[1:38:56] here is a human heart.
[1:38:58] Now, I'm not I'm a long ways from being
[1:39:00] an artist.
[1:39:03] Here is a human heart. And here is a
[1:39:06] human heart. Now, this one over here has
[1:39:10] a snake in it. That's sin. Here he has
[1:39:13] his lion. This one over here has a dove
[1:39:15] in it, which is the Holy Spirit. Here,
[1:39:17] he has a lion. Well, this here has
[1:39:20] malice, hatred, envy. That's what's
[1:39:24] causing this all here.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Well, this over here has love and uh joy
[1:39:30] and longsuffering, and that's what does
[1:39:33] it down here. Amen.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Now, when you are asked or you are
[1:39:36] forgiven of your sins, you've only done
[1:39:40] this.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Taking that away,
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; but the thing that made you do it is
[1:39:45] still there.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; That's the old root of evil.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; It's still there. Notice, then you
[1:39:54] repent and are baptized in the name of
[1:39:57] Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your
[1:40:02] sins.
[1:40:03] Notice then secondly comes
[1:40:06] sanctification
[1:40:08] which sets our mind in order for
[1:40:11] holiness to think right.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Taken away. Sanctification is a compound
[1:40:18] Greek word which means cleaned and set
[1:40:20] aside for service. Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Then the next comes the baptism of the
[1:40:26] fire and Holy Ghost that God might dwell
[1:40:29] in us and the fire of God
[1:40:32] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[1:40:35] the Holy Ghost inside then we bring
[1:40:37] forth the same life that this did
[1:40:39] because that's in us.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; Notice in the natural birth when a woman
[1:40:44] gives birth to a baby the natural life
[1:40:46] types the spiritual life. When a woman
[1:40:49] gives birth to a baby in the natural,
[1:40:51] the first thing happens is breaking of
[1:40:53] water, then blood
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; and then the spirit alive. Grab the
[1:40:59] little fell and spank him and away he
[1:41:01] goes screaming. Water, blood, spirit.
[1:41:06] And now when a baby is born into the
[1:41:08] kingdom of God, he comes the same way.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit. Now notice
[1:41:15] sanctification. The third stage, second
[1:41:18] stage of it, cleanses the mind, sets the
[1:41:22] heart, the mind of the heart, an order
[1:41:24] of holiness. A man can repent of sins
[1:41:27] and he's still thinking of, well, maybe
[1:41:29] he's a immoral man. Every immoral
[1:41:33] looking woman he finds, it's still
[1:41:35] there. Maybe he's a drunkard and every
[1:41:38] time he smells the drink, it's still
[1:41:40] there. See, but then when he gets
[1:41:43] sanctified,
[1:41:45] that cleanses that desire out of him.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; See, it takes the want of it away. He
[1:41:51] can still be tempted, but he's takes the
[1:41:53] want of it away. Still, he's not right
[1:41:55] yet. Then he is baptized with the Holy
[1:41:59] Ghost and fire,
[1:42:01] cleansed, burned out, cleaned up, and
[1:42:03] then put into the service of God.
[1:42:07] Sanctification only sets him aside for
[1:42:09] service. And notice this exactly how
[1:42:11] that come. The message is coming. Martin
[1:42:13] Luther justification.
[1:42:16] John Wesley sanctification, the
[1:42:18] Pentecostal, the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:20] Ghost.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; The messages. That's where they can't be
[1:42:23] any more ages of it. See, we're at the
[1:42:25] end time.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Three stages. Baptism cleanses the heart
[1:42:29] with the Holy Ghost. How striking. Now
[1:42:34] he takes the place where we are to dwell
[1:42:39] in through the same process. Now he's
[1:42:42] called the church through justification.
[1:42:44] Called it through sanctification. Then
[1:42:46] filled it with the Holy Ghost and fire
[1:42:48] and he took it through a process that he
[1:42:51] himself, the Holy Spirit himself, the
[1:42:54] son of God could dwell in the human
[1:42:56] heart.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Now it has to go through that before he
[1:43:00] can come into it.
[1:43:02] Notice he done the world where that
[1:43:05] bride's going to live in the same way.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The same plan of of salvation.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Notice the Antalovian world.
[1:43:16] He after it had repented by through the
[1:43:19] bride of that day, Noah,
[1:43:22] he give it a water baptism.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Cover with water.
[1:43:28] Then justification,
[1:43:31] showing it is on his road to call this
[1:43:33] fallen world from Eden back to its
[1:43:35] restoration again. Then Christ came and
[1:43:38] shed his blood upon it, cleansing it and
[1:43:41] claiming it.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; See, that's the world that we live in
[1:43:46] now.
[1:43:48] See how Satan here in the scripture
[1:43:50] tried to make him break God's plan to
[1:43:53] receive it, give it to him when he took
[1:43:56] him up on the mountain and tried to give
[1:43:58] it to him without the purchase of the
[1:44:00] blood.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You notice how Abraham when they tried
[1:44:04] to give him the land, he bought it with
[1:44:07] so many shulkets of silver before the
[1:44:09] people as a in sign as a witness. Let it
[1:44:12] be known this day that I bought this
[1:44:15] bearing place.
[1:44:17] see
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; purchase it and Satan tried to
[1:44:22] to give him the kingdom which belongs to
[1:44:25] him now
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; he tried to give it to him as a gift but
[1:44:31] he wouldn't receive it
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; causes see then Satan could still have
[1:44:35] claim on it
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; but it had to be bought
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; he was a word in the fullness thereof
[1:44:44] they couldn't deceive a minute then it
[1:44:48] is now to get a baptism of fire.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; See it is now what happened. Christ
[1:44:58] came and called the church to repentance
[1:45:01] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:45:03] the remission sanctified the church and
[1:45:06] with the fire of God come down and burn
[1:45:08] out all the filth and come and dwells in
[1:45:11] the human heart. Now the world to be
[1:45:14] redeemed for this redeemed person. He
[1:45:16] uses the same method. He baptized it in
[1:45:20] water after the end of destruction. Shed
[1:45:23] his blood up on it to sanctify it and
[1:45:25] claim it.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; It's his. Satan tried to say, "I'll give
[1:45:28] it to you." Said, "No, sir. I buy it.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Let it be a witness." He was lifted up
[1:45:33] for an insign
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; that he bought it. He purchased it.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; But now it has to go through a baptism
[1:45:41] of fire. Amen.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Holy, far from God, which cleanses the
[1:45:45] earth and the heavens around it.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Then it's purchased so that the redeemed
[1:45:51] can live on it,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; live in it in peace.
[1:45:55] Notice the baptism of fire is to cleanse
[1:45:58] it from sin, from sickness, from
[1:46:01] disease, germs, from sinners, from the
[1:46:04] devil, and all of his group. He's to be
[1:46:06] cast out into the lake of fire. Amen.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Holy fire from God comes down from God
[1:46:11] out of heaven and burns it up.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Notice to make it ready for God to dwell
[1:46:18] in. For God in the new world that is to
[1:46:21] come is to dwell in the earth.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Cause you say God, he dwells in the
[1:46:27] human heart. But he and the bride
[1:46:29] becomes one and they go to their home in
[1:46:31] the new world. Amen.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; And the same plan of redemption is used
[1:46:34] to redeem both world and the persons
[1:46:37] that live in it.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; See, the heart has to be cleansed like
[1:46:40] that.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Before God can come down in the person
[1:46:43] of the Holy Ghost, which is Christ,
[1:46:46] coming down and dwell in the human
[1:46:48] heart, it first must be repented.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; It must be baptized in water in his name
[1:46:55] to show who it belongs to.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Then it must be cleansed by the blood of
[1:46:59] Jesus. And then the holy fire and holy
[1:47:02] ghost from God comes down and burns out
[1:47:04] all the desire of sin,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; all the nature of the world. And
[1:47:10] therefore, he that sins willfully after
[1:47:15] receiving the knowledge of the truth.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Then again, the Bible said it's
[1:47:19] impossible
[1:47:21] for a man that's born of God cannot sin.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; He does not sin. There's no way for him
[1:47:29] to sin.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; How can he be a sinner and redeemed at
[1:47:32] the same time?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; How can I be in the pawn shop and out of
[1:47:36] the pawn shop at the same time?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, he redeemed us by his blood.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; By his spirit, he cleansed us and then
[1:47:46] comes to dwell in us.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; The church,
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; not the denomination. Now the church
[1:47:55] notice close now as we take this
[1:47:58] places we are to to dwell in now
[1:48:03] now the the antivian repentance then
[1:48:06] brought water baptism then Christ came
[1:48:09] and shed his blood upon it to cleanse it
[1:48:11] to claim it and then comes the next the
[1:48:14] destruction
[1:48:15] of the world as it is now
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; all the sin that's in the heavens above.
[1:48:22] He's the prince of the power of the air.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; He keeps off wars off blessings from
[1:48:29] God. In there comes thunderbolts of
[1:48:31] lightning and strikes the earth and
[1:48:33] everything from the heavens, sheets of
[1:48:34] slice and rain and typhoons, ti storms
[1:48:37] and everything comes from above which is
[1:48:40] Satan.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; The prince of the power of the air.
[1:48:44] Notice, see how Satan tried to take it,
[1:48:46] as I said a few minutes ago, by giving
[1:48:49] it to Jesus without buying it. Then
[1:48:53] Satan still has a claim because it's
[1:48:55] earmarked.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; See, but Jesus buys it.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; By his shed blood and brings it back to
[1:49:02] the rightful owner.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; That's how he bought us by his blood.
[1:49:06] How he bought the church.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; And now it's baptism of fire cleanses
[1:49:11] from all germs. all diseases, all
[1:49:15] sicknesses, even all the spiritual
[1:49:17] things which is by us too that does the
[1:49:20] same way to make it ready for God to
[1:49:22] dwell in in this great age that's to
[1:49:25] come the new earth. See,
[1:49:28] he redeems it in the same way he does
[1:49:31] his people. He makes it all just the
[1:49:33] same as plan of redemption. For he is
[1:49:35] the unchangeable God, always the same in
[1:49:38] his plans. how I've told you before and
[1:49:41] make it known to you and by all ages
[1:49:45] that God cannot change.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Makes it known every way by the same. He
[1:49:52] made it known his first message in the
[1:49:54] Andolivian world by Noah the prophet.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I was talking to a dear brother who's
[1:50:01] sitting present with me now yesterday.
[1:50:03] He said one thing he said, brother
[1:50:04] Brandham, it always shook me as to what
[1:50:07] is it, brother? And he said, here's what
[1:50:09] she said, and it's true. The minority,
[1:50:14] how a little group is going to be saved
[1:50:17] in the days of coming. And we talked of
[1:50:20] how Jesus said, "Straight is the gate
[1:50:22] and narrow is the way, and but few there
[1:50:25] will be that'll find it."
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Now, notice the Bible said, "As it was
[1:50:30] in the days of Noah,
[1:50:33] where in eight souls were saved by
[1:50:36] water.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; So shall it be in the coming. I said,
[1:50:41] brother, you just got, he said, remember
[1:50:43] there's only eight souls there.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I said, you just got half the picture.
[1:50:50] Yet
[1:50:51] Noah was a type of the remnant that's
[1:50:54] carried over.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Not the translated bunch.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Enoch, one man. That's right.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; When in the rapture before the flood
[1:51:04] came
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; showing that the church does not go into
[1:51:07] the tribulation or anything around it.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Enoch was translated
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; one man.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Oh the church may be a number but the
[1:51:18] bride is going to be a very small group.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; That'll make up the bride.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Now the church may be a great number but
[1:51:28] the bride you see compare eight with
[1:51:30] one. Eight times less will be the bride
[1:51:34] than the church. And if the righteous
[1:51:36] scarcely be saved, where will the sinner
[1:51:38] and the ungodly appear?
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Those who know better to do it and go
[1:51:42] ahead and do it anyhow.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Those who follow the rules of
[1:51:46] denomination instead of the word, where
[1:51:49] will they appear at yet called
[1:51:51] Christians taking the name of Christ?
[1:51:54] Now
[1:51:56] perfectly Noah was a type of those
[1:51:59] carried over. Remember when Noah come
[1:52:01] out, Ham was with him.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Sin was still in there.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Sin went right on over through the ark.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Unbelief, doubt.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Went over in the ark. Carried above the
[1:52:13] judgments. But Enoch went higher than
[1:52:15] the ark.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He went on into the presence of God.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; But Noah went through and come out and
[1:52:24] there was still sin type of the
[1:52:26] millennium of the world's condition. The
[1:52:29] millennium is not the end of it. There
[1:52:31] will still be time after the millennium.
[1:52:34] The millennium is a space of time, but
[1:52:36] not the new earth. No, indeed. Notice in
[1:52:40] that, we'll get to it after a bit. See,
[1:52:43] the earth redeemed goes back to its
[1:52:47] original owner again.
[1:52:50] It took he took it from Satan. He pulled
[1:52:55] taken the earth away from Satan just
[1:52:57] like he took you away from Satan
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; like he took the little woman at the
[1:53:00] well away from Satan.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; There stood the priest thought he was
[1:53:04] with God and he had nothing.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; See, I'd like to draw that for you just
[1:53:10] a moment.
[1:53:16] Now, we want to get this real clear. So,
[1:53:19] now watch close now on this teacher.
[1:53:35] Now this shirt here is God. God which is
[1:53:40] the eternal
[1:53:42] without there's no one but him. But in
[1:53:46] God he had attributes.
[1:53:48] Now this here represents the word
[1:53:52] the word of God which is made flesh to
[1:53:54] dwell among us in the person of Jesus.
[1:53:58] Now this year fellow here we're going to
[1:54:01] make him like this.
[1:54:10] Now this is called the woman at the
[1:54:13] well. This is the priest Pharisee. And
[1:54:17] where do you see this open blackboard
[1:54:19] means grace and salvation. Now in the
[1:54:23] beginning was the word
[1:54:26] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:54:28] among us.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; The three stages it was an attribute
[1:54:32] first was in God that he thought of
[1:54:34] himself as being human and that
[1:54:37] transmitted him down to be Jesus.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; Now if you'll ever be there, you was
[1:54:44] with him then.
[1:54:48] For there's only one form of eternal
[1:54:49] life.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; That's God.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And you had to be a part of God at the
[1:54:56] beginning.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Not what you just chose down here. He
[1:55:02] chose you.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Now look at this priest here. We find
[1:55:09] his bottom part here. His backlight back
[1:55:11] behind him. His predestination back here
[1:55:14] is sinful. Here's hell down here. Now,
[1:55:18] this little part in here looks like the
[1:55:19] blackboard that represents is purity. He
[1:55:23] was a priest. He was an honorable man.
[1:55:27] That represented this.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; He was also had to be a good man or he
[1:55:32] couldn't be a priest.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But you see how he got it was
[1:55:35] intellectual earning.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Now, this little woman, her first life
[1:55:40] up here, she's a prostitute. She was all
[1:55:43] marred up. But way down in here with
[1:55:45] just a little bit of understanding. I
[1:55:47] know when Messiah cometh
[1:55:51] that was there. Notice when Jesus came
[1:55:54] and manifested the word because the word
[1:55:56] discerned the thoughts that was in the
[1:55:58] heart as Hebrews 4 uh says it will 4:12
[1:56:04] that he would the word was a discerner
[1:56:07] of the thoughts of the heart and he came
[1:56:08] as the son of man the prophet. What
[1:56:11] happened? This priest with only
[1:56:13] intellectual learning said it's a devil
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; because that's what his denomination
[1:56:19] called it.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; What did it do? He had no
[1:56:22] representation. So it blacked him out.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; But this little woman had nothing to
[1:56:26] present. She's as filthy and dirty as
[1:56:28] she could be.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; But notice way down in her,
[1:56:33] she's got representation.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; And then she was looking for this to be
[1:56:40] made flesh. Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; And when he said, "Go get your husband
[1:56:44] and come here." She said, "Sir, I have
[1:56:45] not." Said, "You said the truth cause
[1:56:48] you got five and one you have now. It's
[1:56:50] not yours. You've had five. That means
[1:56:52] six you have."
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; She said, "Sir,
[1:56:56] you're not beyond.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I perceive that you are a prophet.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Now, we know the Messiah, which is
[1:57:03] called Christ, will come." Amen.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; And when he does, he'll do this.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm he." No more doubt.
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Didn't have to split it.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; She saw it.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Away she went. Why?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; What did it do to her? It redeemed her.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Now watch. He came to be a redeemer.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; What does redeem mean bring back?
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he get the priest? He was
[1:57:30] nothing.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; He had no representation.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that which had fallen.
[1:57:40] the ball. This got messed up with that
[1:57:41] girl. But God had her in his thinking
[1:57:44] before the foundation of the earth and
[1:57:46] he come to cleans her.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Then he shut Why? See where the priest?
[1:57:52] What did it do to him? It sent him right
[1:57:54] back to his destination.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; He had nothing to be good. Only
[1:57:57] intellectual learning.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Now listen friend, if the only thing
[1:58:01] you've got is just intellectual
[1:58:03] learning, you get something different
[1:58:05] from that. And you'll never be able to
[1:58:08] get it unless you got representation.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I believe you come
[1:58:15] from the east and west, north and south.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; The were living made manifest.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Notice now
[1:58:24] how he makes his way known by his
[1:58:26] prophets in the beginning. He's never
[1:58:29] changed it.
[1:58:34] Salvation.
[1:58:35] justified a man, sanctified him, sent
[1:58:38] the Holy Ghost in fire, burnt the sin
[1:58:40] out of him and dwelt in him himself. He
[1:58:42] does the earth that he's going to use in
[1:58:44] a plan of redemption. The same way it
[1:58:46] repented and was baptized in water in by
[1:58:49] Noah. Jesus come and sanctified it by
[1:58:52] dripping his blood upon it and claimed
[1:58:54] it. And in the new earth is to come.
[1:58:55] It's to have a holy fire baptism to
[1:58:58] clean it of every devil, every germ,
[1:59:00] every sickness, everything that there is
[1:59:02] and make it a new
[1:59:05] I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; You become a new person.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Not just an old one patched up
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; by joining church or trying to turn a
[1:59:17] new page,
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; but you are a complete brand new unit.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; God takes the old man and burns him
[1:59:27] completely out with the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:29] fire and it comes himself.
[1:59:32] sends down your representation.
[1:59:34] No man can come to me except my father
[1:59:36] has drawn.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; And all the father has given me will
[1:59:40] come to me.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; You see it?
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Same plan, same weight. Satan was will
[1:59:49] be taken from the earth just exactly
[1:59:52] like Satan was taken from you.
[1:59:56] Satan cannot
[1:59:59] bother or he can tempt but he cannot get
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; a bornag again Christian
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; for God from the foundation of the world
[2:00:08] forsaw him
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; and sent Jesus to redeem him
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; and the blood speaks fine
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; how can he sin when it can't be seen
[2:00:18] even by God
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; he don't even the only thing he hears is
[2:00:21] your voice
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; he sees your representation
[2:00:25] Amen.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; See,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; by the same means for the world is one
[2:00:35] of his attributes
[2:00:37] just the same as you are one of his
[2:00:39] attributes.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; The world becomes one of his attributes
[2:00:43] because it was God's thinking in the
[2:00:46] beginning to have a world
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; to be on a throne,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; to be a king,
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; to be a redeemer,
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; to be a healer.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his attributes.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Just like an attribute of you. I can't
[2:01:00] say a post less I think a post.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; I can't say man less I think a man.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; And when I think a man then say man, the
[2:01:11] thinking is my attribute and expression
[2:01:13] is a word.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; See like Isaiah,
[2:01:19] how could he say that a virgin was going
[2:01:22] to conceive? What is a thought? Now,
[2:01:24] many of you wonder how them that
[2:01:26] discernment comes.
[2:01:29] I'm going to tell you. See, it's a word
[2:01:32] that I say and it isn't my thinking
[2:01:35] because I don't know.
[2:01:37] I don't know the thinking of it. How can
[2:01:39] I tell you who you are and where you
[2:01:40] come from when I don't know you?
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; How can I tell you what you done 10
[2:01:44] years ago and I never seen you in my
[2:01:45] life?
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; How can I tell you where you do and what
[2:01:47] you'll do 10 years from now? How do I
[2:01:49] know the future? But it is somebody
[2:01:52] else's thought.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in
[2:01:56] you.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Let the mind that was in Christ be in
[2:02:04] you.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; See, then it isn't your thinking.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; And you're not expressing your own
[2:02:12] words. You're expressing his words.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's how many times a brethren gets
[2:02:16] confused on interpretation of tongues
[2:02:18] and things. They say things that's not
[2:02:20] right. They don't realize that that's
[2:02:22] Satan.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; You say in the garden of God, just wait
[2:02:25] till we get through. Find out if it's
[2:02:28] not or not. The weeds and the wheat grow
[2:02:30] in the same field.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; They both live by the same sun in the
[2:02:33] same rain.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; But if there be one among you who's a
[2:02:38] prophet, I the Lord will speak to him.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; And if what he says happens, then that's
[2:02:44] me.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's not expressing his own. He's
[2:02:48] expressing my thoughts. My attributes of
[2:02:50] the things that has to come, I'll use
[2:02:52] his mouth to express them by. And after
[2:02:54] he said them, they've got to come to
[2:02:56] pass.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[2:03:00] word shall never fail.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[2:03:04] That settles it. She's going to
[2:03:05] conceive. What God said, he does.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, make known by his prophets all of
[2:03:12] his manifestations because it's his
[2:03:14] attributes of his thoughts expressed.
[2:03:16] Now, here was this little woman. She was
[2:03:19] one of his attributes.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; See, and there was a priest representing
[2:03:24] the light.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; He had learned it from the Bible. He had
[2:03:29] learned that God was God. He had learned
[2:03:31] that holiness is right. He was learned
[2:03:34] that there was a law of God. He had
[2:03:36] learned it because of an intellectual
[2:03:37] conception. And he was born in the right
[2:03:39] lineage. He was a Levite. But he only
[2:03:43] know it by intellectual conception.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; And when the light of the hour, see, he
[2:03:48] learned it. But what had happened,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; not what was happening,
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; what had happened.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And when he found what was happening,
[2:03:59] his denomination said nothing about it.
[2:04:02] Therefore, he had no representation of
[2:04:03] it.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; But here was a redeemer on earth at that
[2:04:07] time to redeem those attributes of God.
[2:04:10] Amen.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; And she received it.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; She never questioned it.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; She said, "Well, Messiah come and see
[2:04:16] you'll do this." That settled it.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; And she seen it done. So he said, "I'm
[2:04:19] the Messiah." So that's settling.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; No more questions. She's just went
[2:04:22] telling everybody else, "Come see who
[2:04:24] you found."
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; These processes make us clean a temple
[2:04:29] for his dwelling place. Justification,
[2:04:32] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[2:04:34] Ghost with fire that does the cleansing
[2:04:37] of this temple. So as old world frame
[2:04:42] did not destroy by the waters when it
[2:04:45] was washed off the frame of the planet.
[2:04:52] The old frame
[2:04:55] the all the dirt all the uh stuff that
[2:04:59] God put on the earth was not destroyed
[2:05:02] when the first world was destroyed. And
[2:05:05] the Bible said it was destroyed.
[2:05:08] But it never destroyed the frame.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; It just destroyed the sin and sinners
[2:05:13] that was on it.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; The framework remained. But you see, as
[2:05:18] justification, as you Baptist and
[2:05:21] Methodists want to think of it, just
[2:05:23] justification, believing and being
[2:05:25] baptized, that's not enough.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; You wander right back into the things
[2:05:30] world, blob your hair and wear shorts
[2:05:32] and everything else.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing happened yet. You
[2:05:36] just look back and seen you done wrong.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; What did justification do to the world?
[2:05:43] Never done a thing to it. Started right
[2:05:45] off again. Just as much sin as it ever
[2:05:47] was.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; That's the way a man does. And that's
[2:05:50] all the farther he goes.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; That's the way the great evangelist
[2:05:53] Billy Graham to see. He said, "I'll go
[2:05:55] and have 30,000 converts come back in a
[2:05:57] year and a got 30."
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; That's all the farther they went.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; See, they surely they repent. I believe
[2:06:05] they repent. Most of them or some of
[2:06:08] them at least. But that isn't what it
[2:06:10] takes. It proves it here. Now, so the
[2:06:13] old world framework was not destroyed by
[2:06:15] the water. The world was only washed
[2:06:18] off.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; That got its baptism.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; It was baptized.
[2:06:23] So will the framework remain though it
[2:06:26] be burnt by fire.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; It don't destroy the earth. See,
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; it just destroys the sin that's on it.
[2:06:35] Notice here some of you Bible student
[2:06:37] especially Dr. They looking at me.
[2:06:39] Notice in Peter in the second chapter of
[2:06:41] Peter, your third chapter rather, he
[2:06:44] uses the word world as a Greek word
[2:06:47] cosmos, which means the world order.
[2:06:51] The earth shall pass away, melt the
[2:06:55] elements with fervent heat. See, doesn't
[2:06:58] mean that the earth, the planet's going
[2:06:59] to pass away, but the world cosmos, the
[2:07:02] politics, the sinners, the systems, sin,
[2:07:07] disease, germs, everything that's wrong
[2:07:09] will pass away.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Everything that once God shook the
[2:07:14] heavens, but this time he said he'll
[2:07:15] shake the earth.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; Heavens and earth, he shook the earth
[2:07:18] rather than this time he'll shake the
[2:07:19] heavens.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; See, for we receive a kingdom that
[2:07:22] cannot be moved.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; It's a eternal kingdom. Watch how it
[2:07:26] goes to it. Notice here Peter said, "And
[2:07:29] will melt with fervent heat, and the
[2:07:31] works therein
[2:07:34] burn up."
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; Not the planet, the works therein.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; The works of man, all their politicians
[2:07:42] and their schemes and all their
[2:07:44] denominations and man-made schemes will
[2:07:46] all go with it
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; when it burns. And and heavens will pass
[2:07:52] away with a great noise. Did you notice
[2:07:53] here? Heavens will pass away with great
[2:07:55] noise. Listen, the whole earth will be
[2:07:58] on fire and will ignite the gases that's
[2:08:02] in the earth and explode it.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Talk the Bible said here, Peter said,
[2:08:07] "And the heavens will pass away in earth
[2:08:11] with a great noise."
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Such an explosion will rock it. Oh my.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Cause it's got to kill every disease,
[2:08:19] every thistle, every thorn, everything
[2:08:22] there is to be done. The fire will burn
[2:08:24] it up.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; And remember, it's not altogether just a
[2:08:27] literal fire. It's also a holy fire.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; See, that will take away Satan. All of
[2:08:33] his,
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; all the devils, both heaven and earth,
[2:08:38] amen,
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; will pass away, killing all the germs,
[2:08:42] all insects, all natural life on it and
[2:08:44] around it. Even the H2O, the water will
[2:08:48] explode.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Talk about a noise.
[2:08:53] You think that little noise I hear in
[2:08:54] Tucson was something when he opened the
[2:08:56] six seals that shook the country around
[2:08:59] about and caused the talk. Wait till
[2:09:01] this earth receives our baptism.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; You know when a man receives the baptism
[2:09:07] of fire, there's a lot of noise around
[2:09:09] there.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; They think that's shame to hear people
[2:09:12] scream and shout like that. Just wait
[2:09:14] till this earth gets her baptism.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:09:19] It'll explain exploit the H2O, the
[2:09:21] water. For the Bible said here in
[2:09:23] Revelation 21, and there was no more sea
[2:09:27] exploit. This will change the whole
[2:09:30] surface of the entire earth.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; She'll burst and blow to pieces.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; All the outside the crust and for
[2:09:39] hundreds of feet below it'll just simply
[2:09:41] be completely demolished. That's right.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; The atmospheres, the gases that's in the
[2:09:48] earth now where they're finding these
[2:09:49] missiles that can't get to it. A great
[2:09:51] sphere up in there way up in some kind
[2:09:53] of a sphere that there's all kinds of
[2:09:55] gases they say and that'll burst.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; The holy wrath of God will come up on it
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; and will cleanse it.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; Will change the entire service. Now,
[2:10:09] many of you won't put on this word, the
[2:10:11] Greek word pass away.
[2:10:14] It comes from the word I had to find. I
[2:10:16] thought, how's this world going to pass
[2:10:17] away? And yet, we're going to live on
[2:10:19] it. But if you'll notice, some of you
[2:10:21] people wants to put it down. I'll spell
[2:10:22] it for you. I couldn't pronounce it. P A
[2:10:26] R E R E C H O M I A. I don't know how to
[2:10:31] pronounce it. Now that way as I said
[2:10:33] when I get the inspiration strikes me
[2:10:35] for something
[2:10:37] then I go back to find out the word now
[2:10:40] here I can't spell the word I can't I
[2:10:42] can't pronounce it but in that the Lord
[2:10:44] is still give me a way I go and find out
[2:10:47] what that word means then I got it
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; then I got it again see heavens and
[2:10:53] earth will pass away now this word means
[2:10:56] passing from one form to another it does
[2:11:00] not mean annihilation
[2:11:02] as the English word would mean pass
[2:11:04] away. It's annihilated. But the Hebrew
[2:11:07] word or the Greek word here does not
[2:11:09] mean pass away. It means from passing
[2:11:11] from one thing to another. Look, but to
[2:11:14] pass from one condition, it says to
[2:11:16] another. Now notice Paul used it. If you
[2:11:20] want to read it now, put it down, you
[2:11:21] can read it later. And Titus 3:5, Paul
[2:11:24] is using this same word means
[2:11:27] regeneration of man. that man has passed
[2:11:31] from a sinner to a saint.
[2:11:33] Not completely annihilated. When a man's
[2:11:36] changed, he isn't annihilated, but he's
[2:11:38] a changed person.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; He's been changed from what he was to
[2:11:43] what he is.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Not annihilating. Jesus used the same
[2:11:47] word in Matthew 19:28.
[2:11:51] Now, not 28:19 now. 19:28.
[2:11:56] He said to them, "You're set with me in
[2:11:58] my father's kingdom regenerated." You
[2:12:01] see, changed. When you're changed, he
[2:12:04] used the same word. And he used the same
[2:12:06] word when he said to the cult that loose
[2:12:08] the colt and let him go. Said the same
[2:12:12] thing at the resurrection of Lazarus.
[2:12:14] Loose him.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Change him.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; He's been tied. Let him go.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; What does it mean? The earth will be
[2:12:24] loose from the grip of Satan.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; It'll be loose. It'll be loose from
[2:12:30] politics. It'll be loose from
[2:12:32] denominational religious systems
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; to be used for the kingdom of God
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; to be established here on the earth. But
[2:12:40] as long it's in the hands of Satan,
[2:12:42] politics, Satan, the ruler of the earth,
[2:12:44] he owns it. It belonged to him. But now
[2:12:47] Christ has redeemed it.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; One time I was his property, but not
[2:12:50] now. Amen.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; One time that little woman was his
[2:12:53] property, but not now.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; He come to loose the grip of it.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; He loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon
[2:13:01] my life, upon your life, and now we're
[2:13:03] not his.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; Have you often heard me say in prayer,
[2:13:07] "Take your hands off of God's property."
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Have faith to claim your own.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's your rights.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Take your hands off of her. Take your
[2:13:18] hands off of him. See faith will do it.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Not annihilate it, but just take
[2:13:27] your hands off of it
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; to loose it. Let it go. Pass it away. It
[2:13:32] changes.
[2:13:34] The earth will change. Politics will
[2:13:36] change. The religions will change. The
[2:13:39] denominations will pass away. Politics
[2:13:42] will pass away. The kingdom of God shall
[2:13:44] be established. We read in John uh read
[2:13:48] John in Revelation 6:14.
[2:13:51] See, it departed as a scroll.
[2:13:57] The Bible said the that it John said, "I
[2:14:00] saw the heaven and earth depart as a
[2:14:03] scroll." John Revelation 6:14, Jesus
[2:14:07] said, "Heavens and earth shall pass
[2:14:09] away." Or other words, heavens and earth
[2:14:12] shall be changed.
[2:14:15] Use that same word right there again.
[2:14:17] No, not annihilated.
[2:14:20] For later in Revelations 21
[2:14:23] 2- 24,
[2:14:25] he seen the new Jerusalem coming down
[2:14:29] from God out of heaven and sitting upon
[2:14:32] this earth.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that it'll be
[2:14:36] annihilated. The systems will be
[2:14:38] changed.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; Daniel saw the same thing. rock struck
[2:14:42] the world will shoot out without hands
[2:14:45] and the whole image of the systems was
[2:14:49] broke down and become like a champ on a
[2:14:51] summer thrashing floor and the wind
[2:14:53] packed it away
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; and the rock itself grew into a great
[2:14:57] mountain that covered the earth.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Watch that mountain now in a little bit.
[2:15:01] That mountain covered the earth. Also,
[2:15:04] we find out here over also in
[2:15:06] Revelations there, it said the kings of
[2:15:08] the new earth will bring their honor and
[2:15:10] glory into it. And the earth is sitting,
[2:15:14] the new Jerusalem is sitting on this
[2:15:16] earth.
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; See, it just changed. You're the same
[2:15:20] man and statue that you was when God
[2:15:23] called you,
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; same woman.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; But you see what it did? It was a
[2:15:28] regeneration. The old life passed away.
[2:15:31] The old desires passed away.
[2:15:33] When you used to like to drink and cuss
[2:15:35] and fuss and stew and run around and
[2:15:37] immoral, that thing just died.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; See, but now you are used and you was
[2:15:43] Satan's instrument. Now you are
[2:15:45] redeemed.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; And that's what the world would be the
[2:15:47] same way. Redeemed
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; a new heavens and new earth just like
[2:15:51] you. You are a new creature.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; And the Greek word there, anybody knows
[2:15:56] said you are a new creation.
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:01] A new creation in the same old temple.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Watch what happens here now. Glorious.
[2:16:08] All right.
[2:16:10] Now we find that this earth will hold
[2:16:14] the kings of the earth. And again in
[2:16:17] Matthew 5:5, Jesus said, "The meek shall
[2:16:22] inherit the earth."
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; It isn't going to just go to have
[2:16:26] another earth. It's just going to be the
[2:16:27] same earth. I'm trying to get the the
[2:16:29] plan of redemption to you before if it
[2:16:32] don't get nothing else. See, the baptism
[2:16:34] a fire on it only is to cleanse it and
[2:16:38] make it a fit place for his meek to live
[2:16:40] in.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:16:46] like he did us this creation to live in.
[2:16:48] Before he could come in it, he had to
[2:16:49] give us the baptism of fire.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Then the Holy Ghost come in and live.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Baptism of fire. Then when you get that
[2:16:56] baptism of fire, then the Holy Ghost can
[2:16:59] come in. What does it does? It burns up
[2:17:02] everything contrary to the word out of
[2:17:04] you.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; It won't believe nothing else but the
[2:17:07] word
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; because it is the word.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; That's what we was talking the other
[2:17:14] day. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. See
[2:17:16] the evidence of the Holy Ghost when you
[2:17:18] can receive the word
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; not some system
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; but have a clear understand. How you
[2:17:24] know the word is clear understand?
[2:17:25] What's it vindicate itself?
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Well you say I see this to it that oh
[2:17:29] yes weeds live the same way.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; See but it's got to be the entire word.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; To be the bride you have to be part of
[2:17:38] him. He is the word.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; See and what a part of him is it the
[2:17:42] word that's promised for this day when
[2:17:44] he calls his bride.
[2:17:46] You're part of that. You get it?
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't lose that. Now, notice.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; And he makes it a fit place to live
[2:17:56] through eternity. Notice this is still
[2:18:00] not referred to
[2:18:02] uh this millennium reign. The thousand
[2:18:05] years is not the new earth. See, the
[2:18:08] millennium reign is a different reign.
[2:18:10] That's what we go into the millennium.
[2:18:12] That isn't a new earth, a new heaven.
[2:18:14] No. No. That's just a rest place, a rest
[2:18:17] period. Not at all. The new heavens and
[2:18:19] new earth. For see, in the millennium,
[2:18:21] we have things that would not go into
[2:18:23] that. It's a type of the old seventh day
[2:18:26] out of Eden. The seventh day after he
[2:18:28] made the world. The seventh day he
[2:18:30] rested in Eden. And the millennium, see,
[2:18:33] the world has now almost 6,000 years
[2:18:36] old. See, every 2,000 year has had a a
[2:18:40] destruction. See, first 200 the flood
[2:18:44] came and he baptized it with what?
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Water. Next 200 Jesus come to sanctify
[2:18:51] and clean it, dropped his blood upon it,
[2:18:54] called it his. All right, I'll come
[2:18:56] again now as king with his queen. And
[2:19:00] the second 2,000 years, what does he do?
[2:19:02] He comes and gives his rest spirit and
[2:19:04] then burns her off and claims it for his
[2:19:06] own.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Puts his own back on it. And notice,
[2:19:10] not the perfect world. This millennium,
[2:19:13] it's a type of the seventh day. Then
[2:19:15] comes the white throne judgment. See, we
[2:19:17] still have judgment. We're still in time
[2:19:18] in the millennium. It's a day 1,000
[2:19:21] years. It's a time element, not don't
[2:19:24] get that mixed up with the new earth
[2:19:25] now, because it's not.
[2:19:27] You must say this to me. I this somebody
[2:19:30] might say this to me that uh now,
[2:19:33] brother Brandham, what do you go to do
[2:19:35] now? You've run out of your complete
[2:19:37] sevens.
[2:19:39] What are you going to do now? Now you're
[2:19:41] a dispensationalist, which I am. I
[2:19:43] believe it. God is too. No, notice you
[2:19:46] run out of dispensation types.
[2:19:49] For if you're going to put something
[2:19:51] beyond that seventh day, how you going
[2:19:52] to get it? Where are you going to now?
[2:19:57] All right. I'll call your attention to
[2:19:59] something.
[2:20:03] I I had a dispensation yet.
[2:20:06] I got another scripture here. And
[2:20:08] remember, all of it has to be fulfilled.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Brother Bram, you're
[2:20:13] trying to put something way over yonder
[2:20:15] beyond that seventh day. That seventh
[2:20:18] day Sabbath as God made the earth and
[2:20:21] labored six days and rested the seventh
[2:20:23] is only a type of time."
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Time.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; But I've just said here, we become
[2:20:31] eternal.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; So where's your type now? You said your
[2:20:36] typology just so you you've run out of
[2:20:38] types now. No, I haven't. Let's just
[2:20:40] find out if we have.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Leviticus back in the 23rd
[2:20:44] chapter of Leviticus.
[2:20:46] I want you to notice in Leviticus where
[2:20:48] we was at last Sunday or this what gave
[2:20:50] me the idea right here. The 23rd chapter
[2:20:53] of Leviticus and the 26th verse. Now
[2:20:56] remember there is seven feast days. The
[2:21:02] feast of trumpets, the feast of of
[2:21:04] tabernacles, the feast of the sheath
[2:21:05] waving, the all this is seven great
[2:21:08] feast days. That was only a type of the
[2:21:12] seven church ages.
[2:21:15] And you remember how many Sabbaths there
[2:21:17] was between one and the other. See,
[2:21:20] seven Sabbaths between Pentecost and the
[2:21:22] trumpets, which was seven church ages.
[2:21:25] And there was seven feast days that
[2:21:27] represent the seven church ages. Keep
[2:21:29] your numbers running. say, "Well, now
[2:21:31] Brother Bram, you're done. Run out. You
[2:21:32] got your seven." All right, let's take
[2:21:35] the last feast, which is the feast of
[2:21:37] tabernacles. Now, notice here in the
[2:21:40] 36th verse, seven days shall you offer
[2:21:44] offerings made of fire unto the Lord. On
[2:21:47] the eighth day,
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; on the eighth day shall be a holy
[2:21:55] convocation.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:21:58] There's another holy time coming, holy
[2:22:00] commutation unto you, and you shall
[2:22:02] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[2:22:05] Lord, and it is a solemn assembly.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; And you shall do no terrible work
[2:22:10] therein.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; Now, we got an eighth day.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Now, there's only seven days, but yeah,
[2:22:17] we speak of the eighth day holy
[2:22:20] conversation. Uh combination, notice, do
[2:22:23] no work in it. The eighth day are what?
[2:22:26] back to the first thing.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; What speaks of eternity
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; is she rolls around without a stop in
[2:22:32] place.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you see it?
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; Notice it was also upon this eighth day,
[2:22:40] last day, feast day of the tabernacle.
[2:22:44] Notice after that, after the last feast
[2:22:46] day, at the last church age, at the last
[2:22:50] complete seven days upon the earth,
[2:22:52] after the millennium, that this holy
[2:22:55] convocation comes.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Remember this is feast of tabernacles.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Tabernacles.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Gathering places.
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; Where in the millennium the Bible said
[2:23:09] they shall build houses,
[2:23:12] &gt;&gt; they shall inhabit. But in the new
[2:23:14] earth, he's already when prepared the
[2:23:16] place it's built.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; We have nothing to do with the building
[2:23:20] of it.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Eternal.
[2:23:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love that word. My
[2:23:46] Amen. How many love the word?
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Trust the Lord Jesus will
[2:23:51] bless you. Let's sing that song. We'll
[2:23:53] stand and sing that before I turn it to

[2:25:06] lamb.

[2:25:57] I was lost in the darkness, but now I am

[2:26:46] And I'll thank him for giving me
