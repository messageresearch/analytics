[3:14] Brena uh first seal fulfill second
[3:20] Thessalonians uh the revelation of the
[3:22] man of sin yes that's right that does
[3:26] that easy that does that a man of sin he
[3:29] say man keeps in in stages riding on to
[3:31] he gets on a pale horse is called Death
[3:33] Christ comes on down to justification
[3:36] sanctification to the White Horse and
[3:37] that's get life you see what happened to
[3:40] the Born Again believers who are in the
[3:45] various denominations but not in the
[3:49] bride of Christ what happens to them
[3:51] well I think we explained that a while
[3:53] ago see they go into the
[3:57] tribulation they are Mar in the
[4:00] tribulation come up in the last after
[4:03] the Millennium for their
[4:06] judgment see because the Bible said that
[4:09] the rest of the living the rest of the
[4:12] Dead live not until the thousand years
[4:15] was
[4:16] expired then there was a
[4:19] resurrection and then come forth the
[4:22] both just and unjust and was judged by
[4:26] Christ and the
[4:28] bride he came came to the Earth with
[4:30] 10,000s times 10, thousands of his
[4:33] Saints is that right his bride judgment
[4:36] was set the books was open books was
[4:38] open and another book was open which is
[4:40] The Book of Life he separated from there
[4:43] the goats from the Sheep is that right
[4:47] that had nothing to do with the bride
[4:49] she was standing right there in judgment
[4:50] with her Queen the queen and king
[4:52] together he came with the Saints 10
[4:55] thousands times thousands ministered to
[4:57] him why
[5:00] then judgment was set and then the Sheep
[5:02] was separated from the goats remember
[5:04] the night me bring that little
[5:06] meditation so he'd understand the cowboy
[5:08] meditation see there you no they are
[5:13] that's um they the the the church the
[5:16] people that's in
[5:19] denominations that are are genuine
[5:22] Christians who receives the message and
[5:25] they will never see it it'll never be
[5:29] preached to
[5:30] them and those in the mixed crowds who
[5:33] it is preached to it'll go right over
[5:35] the top their heads unless your name was
[5:37] on the L's book of
[5:39] life but they will be good people and
[5:42] they'll be raised up again and given
[5:44] trial and be judged by the very group
[5:47] that preached to them don't you know the
[5:50] Saints will judge the
[5:52] Earth they'll be preached to see they'll
[5:55] be preached to by the very same people
[5:58] witnessed to them of the message to come
[6:02] out of
[6:04] it I hope that explains it got some many
[6:08] here that brother brandham is the
[6:10] seventh
[6:12] angel with the spirit of Elijah the same
[6:16] man as the Elijah sent to the 144,000
[6:20] Jews during the three and a half years
[6:23] after the
[6:24] Rapture some of us are mixed up in
[6:28] this no he isn't the same see it's two
[6:33] different man the Elijah that come in
[6:37] the form of Elijah was not
[6:41] Elijah and the spirit of Elijah who came
[6:44] up on a man called John the Baptist was
[6:47] not
[6:48] Elijah and the man of the seventh angel
[6:51] messenger at the end of the lady of sin
[6:54] age will not be the literal Elijah he'll
[6:57] be a gentile to his people Elijah will
[7:01] the spirit of Elijah then coming in the
[7:04] into the people there he will be a Jew
[7:07] see for they're sent to their own people
[7:10] that's my Revelation reason uh of Tommy
[7:13] osor when we talk that over that time
[7:16] Tommy and I I never know I was just
[7:19] praying for the sick and I come up there
[7:20] and there's a lady come down from the
[7:21] fortman Gospel Tabernacle a missionary
[7:23] in the Foreign Fields her breast was
[7:25] that big with just eat up with cancer
[7:28] she was right there in the little house
[7:30] where we used to live up here in lane
[7:31] and I prayed for the dear sister and she
[7:33] was healed and returned to the field and
[7:36] when she come from Africa and she had
[7:38] left a little book there on missions I I
[7:40] thought well missionaries are fine and
[7:42] I've I've uh never thought much about
[7:45] missionaries and so I thought well there
[7:47] just an office of God out there so
[7:48] that's this my place right here on ath
[7:50] and Penn Street so I was just carrying
[7:52] all the best I could but one day sitting
[7:54] in the study I picked up that book and
[7:56] had a picture of a of the Negro race an
[8:00] elderly old father and he had this
[8:03] little white r my hair and underneath
[8:05] was written like this white man white
[8:07] man where was your father see I'm now
[8:11] old and dull at mine and I don't
[8:15] understand too well if I would have
[8:17] known Jesus when I was a young man I
[8:20] would have took him to my people well I
[8:23] read it and something just kept saying
[8:24] read it again read it again I kept
[8:27] reading you've had them read over and
[8:28] over the something in there like up
[8:31] there that day at Greens Mill when to
[8:32] come out of the cave I couldn't
[8:34] understand that uh how people could
[8:36] speak with tongues and Shout with the
[8:38] genuine Holy Ghost and still be
[8:41] Antichrist speak with Tong with genuine
[8:44] Holy Ghost tongue speaking and still be
[8:47] a
[8:48] devil right I prove that to you yes
[8:51] indeed then notice when they stood there
[8:55] so tongues is no evidence of the Holy
[8:58] Ghost it's one of the the gifts of the
[9:00] Holy Ghost see and the devil can
[9:02] impersonate everything he's got Divine
[9:04] Healing and everything else he said many
[9:06] will come to me that said Lord haven't I
[9:08] cast out Devils haven't I that's
[9:10] preaching the gospel haven't I done
[9:12] Mighty works in your name and all these
[9:13] things there I'll say depart for me you
[9:15] workers of iniquity I didn't even know
[9:17] you the Bible said that the rain falls
[9:20] on the just and the unjust the same and
[9:23] the same cuckle bir standing in the
[9:25] wheat field there can be as happy and
[9:27] Shout with the same water that fell upon
[9:29] him as it was sent to the rain but by
[9:32] their fruit you know land amen that
[9:35] little old cuckle bird can stand up
[9:36] there just a happy and shout as he can
[9:38] be just as full of the same rain that
[9:40] the weed
[9:41] is there you are so they shout speak
[9:44] with tongues and personate everything
[9:45] you want to and that they be called
[9:47] workers of iniquity as I told you a
[9:50] while ago listen to what I say listen
[9:52] close look back down and examine
[9:54] yourself with the word and see where
[9:55] you're
[9:56] at you women's got short hair let her
[9:58] grow amen you're wearing shorts take
[10:01] them off act like a lady you man still
[10:04] smoking cigarettes around the pool hall
[10:06] stop it I don't care how much you
[10:07] profess if you're still holding that
[10:09] organization saying this is it and this
[10:11] is it you better stop look back down and
[10:13] examine with the word we're didn't come
[10:15] out of we are to lived above the short
[10:17] hair and all this age now we're back
[10:19] into something now that God's revealing
[10:21] the Hidden Mysteries have been put on
[10:22] the book before the foundation of the
[10:24] world Hallelujah and those who have
[10:27] obeyed in these small things will catch
[10:28] it in these other things if they haven't
[10:30] it'll grow the top of their head as far
[10:32] as East is from the west it'll just like
[10:35] Gideon separating his man there's
[10:37] thousands and thousands God said that's
[10:38] too many separate him again he give them
[10:40] another test separate him again separate
[10:43] him again on down to they had a little
[10:45] handful said that's a group I want to do
[10:47] the job that's exactly what happened
[10:51] Pentecostal women going back and forth
[10:52] sitting there hearing and knowing the
[10:54] the word that's wrong you think they'll
[10:55] cope with it no sir every year when I
[10:58] pass by there's more was Bob was said
[11:01] once that got to the order someone said
[11:03] what brother B people regard you as a
[11:05] prophet now I don't say I was a prophet
[11:06] nobody years need to say that but I say
[11:09] this that if if you did do that if you
[11:12] guarded so why don't you teach people
[11:14] how to receive the Holy Ghost and how to
[11:16] get this and how to get great spiritual
[11:17] gifts and help the church how can I
[11:20] teach them algebra when they won't even
[11:22] listen to their
[11:24] ABC right you do these little things get
[11:28] down your the B and brush it off and
[11:30] start
[11:33] right all what was I talking about
[11:36] anyhow I didn't a get off that subject
[11:39] excuse me see all right some of the some
[11:43] of us are mixed up is the Elijah the
[11:45] same as a y that's right no this Elijah
[11:49] that will come to the Gentiles will be a
[11:53] gentile Anointed with that spirit
[11:55] because God used that same Spirit to
[11:58] bring his people P out of chaos every
[12:00] time and it served his purpose well so
[12:02] he comes it right back down again see
[12:05] because now if he uses a high polish
[12:07] educated that's a kind it would catch he
[12:10] brings a man that hardly knows his ABCs
[12:12] and can't pronounce his words right and
[12:14] everything like that some old wilderness
[12:16] something out under somewhere and brings
[12:17] it in and shs right down that
[12:19] simpleminded people and to get it like
[12:21] that it common call like Paul said I
[12:24] didn't come to you with a Polish of an
[12:26] education but I come to you in the power
[12:29] the resurrection it taken God three and
[12:31] A2 years down in Arabia there to knock
[12:33] it out of him his education took took
[12:36] him 40 years to get out of Moses see so
[12:39] there you are that's I don't say God
[12:41] don't I'm not supporting literacy now
[12:43] but I'm I'm trying to tell you it don't
[12:45] take the education don't the wisdom of
[12:47] this world is contrary education has
[12:50] been the biggest hindrance that the
[12:51] gospel's ever had if we didn't have
[12:54] education we' have all these big
[12:55] seminaries and things that we got now be
[12:57] people simple minded who would listen to
[12:59] the word but they so polished and messed
[13:02] up and tightened up out there with all
[13:03] them organizations so that they're going
[13:05] to stay with it that's all they take on
[13:07] that
[13:09] Spirit did you ever take a good woman
[13:12] marry into a low down man that low down
[13:15] man either becomes a a good man like the
[13:17] woman is or the woman becomes low down
[13:19] as he
[13:20] is that's right that's what he said come
[13:22] out from among them when I'm getting
[13:23] ready to take that Rapture you got to
[13:25] have some kind of Faith that'll take you
[13:26] out of here when was the Covenant of
[13:29] Daniel 9:27 confirmed for a
[13:33] week one half of it was confirmed the
[13:37] Covenant when Jesus Christ was on Earth
[13:39] preaching to the Jews he never went to
[13:41] the Gentiles at
[13:43] all and he told his disciples don't go
[13:46] to the Gentiles that was to Jews alone
[13:49] see and he preached for three and a half
[13:51] years that's half of the 70 week now as
[13:56] Daniel said he would do now remember he
[13:59] was firmly a Vindicated to the Jews but
[14:02] their eyes were blinded to bring in this
[14:04] space of the Gentile can't you see the
[14:06] whole
[14:07] program and he proved himself a prophet
[14:10] done just exactly what the prophet would
[14:12] do showed him the sign of a prophet
[14:14] which your own word said if a man says
[14:17] he's spiritual a prophet watch what he
[14:19] says and if it comes to pass just keep
[14:21] on coming to pass what he say
[14:24] continually like you're looking the
[14:26] Bible said KN it'll be open seek find uh
[14:31] ask be given now if you notice it's
[14:35] knocka just constantly knock there right
[14:38] there like the unjust uh judge with an
[14:40] answer woman he just kept knocking on
[14:41] her door I'm on your
[14:44] hand not seek say Lord I'd like to have
[14:47] this amen that's not it stay right there
[14:49] till you get it amen you know it's going
[14:51] to come so he promises to just stay
[14:53] right there you to hold on to it now now
[14:57] in the last part this the 70th week the
[15:00] last part of it will be during the time
[15:02] of the tribulation period at the Rapture
[15:04] of the church then here's a three and A2
[15:06] years here that it will be confirmed to
[15:09] them again by
[15:12] prophets see Moses and Elijah
[15:16] Revelations 11 now let's see what this
[15:21] is if
[15:23] you are one of his chosen ones will you
[15:27] go up in the
[15:30] yes yes sir that's easy brother Brandon
[15:34] did you mean to say
[15:37] 7,000 who had not bowed their knee to
[15:40] balum or
[15:41] 700 7,000 I meant to say forgive me for
[15:45] that see just a it's just a a matter of
[15:48] speech I was just like said a while ago
[15:50] J know me S here I said and and they
[15:53] bear a record seeing the Lamb see see
[15:56] the lamb was on Earth see bear a record
[15:59] seeing the spirit of God coming upon the
[16:03] lamb now in there it says this is my
[16:05] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased you
[16:09] see now that's wrote in the actual form
[16:12] of the Greek but verb for adverb but you
[16:14] notice here and actually you this uh
[16:16] let's take the word see the Bible says
[16:19] in the translation of St James here this
[16:21] is my beloved Son in
[16:23] whom I'm pleased to dwell but actually
[16:27] if we say like we said to this is my
[16:29] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[16:31] in it turn it around see see this is my
[16:34] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[16:39] now we said today this is my beloved Son
[16:41] in whom I'm pleased to dwell in same
[16:44] word just turns it around now yes I
[16:48] meant forgive me please and and Brethren
[16:50] you on the tape out there and Friends
[16:52] listening I didn't mean to say that like
[16:53] that I I I'm a minister to the gospel I
[16:56] many times I preached that I know that
[16:59] 7,000 I just happen to say 700 I didn't
[17:02] mean just 700 I meant you I just didn't
[17:05] read it out of the Scripture it just
[17:06] come to my mind while I was talking and
[17:08] I just said 700 instead of 7,000 I make
[17:11] that mistakes all the time I'm I'm a
[17:13] sure a dummy so you forgive me see I
[17:16] don't mean to do that uh is the bride of
[17:20] Christ and the body of Christ the same
[17:24] yes sir see now here I see I don't want
[17:28] to get start because to get us preach a
[17:30] sermon on see but I won't do that but I
[17:32] want to show you when God gave adam his
[17:37] bride from his
[17:39] side he said she is Flesh of My Flesh
[17:42] and bone of my bone is that right when
[17:45] God gave Christ his bride the spirit
[17:50] gave the flesh the bride he was plucked
[17:53] pierced in the side under his heart and
[17:55] water blood and Spirit came forth and
[17:58] that become flesh of his flesh and bone
[18:01] of his bone we are the Flesh and Bones
[18:05] the bride will be the Flesh and Bones of
[18:07] Christ ex Zach they are the that is his
[18:11] bride would the bride of Christ have
[18:15] would the bride of
[18:17] Christ have a Ministry before the
[18:21] Rapture sure that's what's going on
[18:24] right now the bride of Christ certainly
[18:27] it is the message of the hour amen the
[18:30] bride of Christ sure she's consist of
[18:33] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[18:35] and pastors is that right that's the
[18:38] bride of Christ sure she's got a
[18:39] Ministry great ministry the ministry of
[18:41] the hour it'll be so humble I remember
[18:44] how many were sure the first one I last
[18:46] Sunday see remember what I preached on
[18:51] humility oh don't forget that I'm going
[18:53] to stop a minute to warn that again
[18:56] remember when God predicts anything
[18:59] great to
[19:00] happen the people are looking so far
[19:02] away by their wisdom till they miss what
[19:05] happens when God says anything is great
[19:08] the world laughs at it that bunch of
[19:11] ignorantes that's right but when the
[19:14] great world the great High Church said
[19:16] boy that's glorious God says a bunch of
[19:19] ignoran so see you have to watch I don't
[19:21] mean it maybe of that way exactly that
[19:24] way but that's the way it is look here
[19:26] was a great holy Orthodox Church we know
[19:29] the word we got schools we got
[19:31] seminaries we got our man so polished
[19:33] while for hundreds of years we've been
[19:35] loyal to Jehovah we are the church we
[19:38] the
[19:39] Sanhedrin we got the Council of churches
[19:41] here both Pharisees and Sadducees and
[19:43] all the denominations GS up together
[19:45] like we're
[19:46] getting we're all in one the the Council
[19:49] of church we are the big shots here we
[19:53] know that scripture watch some lead your
[19:55] guy down on the river with a beard
[19:57] hanging over his face and a piece of
[19:58] sheep's again telling us certainly they
[20:01] would listen to it am but the Bible said
[20:04] in Malachi the fourth CH the third
[20:06] chapter I'll send my messenger before my
[20:09] face to prepare the way for me amen 712
[20:13] years before that the great prophet of
[20:16] Isaiah stood there and said there will
[20:19] be a voice of one crying in the
[20:20] wilderness prepare the way for the Lord
[20:22] and make his P straight that's right and
[20:25] said Dave all many of them said every
[20:28] high place will be brought

[1:15:25] Lord be of good courage and he shall
[1:15:28] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[1:15:32] Lord amen we'll take a scripture to save
[1:15:37] a little bit of time in Joshua chapter
[1:15:43] 1 in verse number
[1:15:51] eight and the Bible says
[1:15:55] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:15:57] out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate
[1:16:01] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:16:06] observe to do according to all that is

[1:16:11] thy way prosperous and then thou shal

[1:16:24] amen neither be thou dismayed for the
[1:16:28] Lord thy God is with thee withersoever
[1:16:31] thou go is what a promise what a
[1:16:35] beautiful promise title of the message
[1:16:37] this morning is the soldier the Holy
[1:16:40] Spirit the soldier the Holy Spirit may
[1:16:44] God add a blessing to the reading of his
[1:16:46] word you may be seated for a moment I
[1:16:49] took that title out of the message that
[1:16:53] brother brandom preached the greatest
[1:16:55] battle ever
[1:16:56] fought and he makes this statement in
[1:17:01] that message paragraph
[1:17:03] 104 in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:17:06] he said what was the
[1:17:08] matter you had to open the Channel first
[1:17:13] you've got to get the soldier the Holy
[1:17:15] Spirit placed at the
[1:17:18] Battlefront that takes God's word amen
[1:17:23] so we've been going through the
[1:17:24] scriptures here at the little church
[1:17:28] here on uh writing it down taking the
[1:17:32] words of the Lord and how the Lord
[1:17:35] commanded that that word be written and
[1:17:39] recorded it it's the same word almost as
[1:17:42] a memory or
[1:17:45] recording things must be written down to
[1:17:48] be kept for future use that's the reason
[1:17:52] why we write things down and the Lord
[1:17:54] Lord commanded us to write these laws of
[1:17:59] his word down throughout the scriptures
[1:18:02] and he tells the Believers to do that
[1:18:05] and I called them the other day I called
[1:18:08] them the discipline that it
[1:18:11] requires to not add or not take away
[1:18:15] from those words so first what the Lord
[1:18:18] does is he brings his word into your
[1:18:22] view into your life it's in the written
[1:18:25] form it's written down for a purpose
[1:18:28] many people tried to stop it and um this
[1:18:31] is why the Bible is such a tremendous
[1:18:34] book it's very I mean it causes great
[1:18:38] Wars and battles there's Nations that
[1:18:40] don't want nothing to do with it there's
[1:18:43] demons and Devils that don't want you to
[1:18:44] have it it's a very very controversial
[1:18:48] book uh to those that can open it and
[1:18:51] read it but the Lord had commanded that
[1:18:54] that word be written down for the
[1:18:55] purpose and then he seals that word with
[1:18:59] these two major disciplines and that is
[1:19:02] not to add or to take away and I was I I
[1:19:07] found brother George that in my own
[1:19:09] testimony in my own life that if I can
[1:19:13] walk in those disciplines I I'm okay I'm
[1:19:17] good I mean not just not just the
[1:19:19] scriptures but the Visions the tapes the
[1:19:23] what something means it's that
[1:19:25] temptation to add something to it to
[1:19:27] make it more flavorable or make it more
[1:19:30] presentable leave it alone it's a
[1:19:33] discipline that every believer must have
[1:19:37] God said don't add to it don't take away
[1:19:40] from it and if you do there are
[1:19:43] consequences couldn't we even say like
[1:19:45] this brother Kurt that every
[1:19:47] denomination and every group violated
[1:19:50] that principle that's why they're there
[1:19:53] even in the message doctrines have
[1:19:55] started and begun and started because
[1:19:58] somebody
[1:20:00] violated those two small principles
[1:20:03] don't add don't take it away I've been
[1:20:06] guilty if you'll be honest yes you have
[1:20:10] been guilty we're all guilty with adding
[1:20:13] or misremembering or forgetting and then
[1:20:17] you know maybe maybe we don't add
[1:20:18] nothing but we won't we won't say it all
[1:20:21] we won't you know you know you know you
[1:20:24] know we won't bring it all but this is
[1:20:26] his word and so we've been bringing that
[1:20:28] out and it's been a real real blessing
[1:20:32] uh to me to remind myself that I don't
[1:20:37] have to make the Bible say
[1:20:40] anything because I am not the author of
[1:20:43] nothing but
[1:20:44] confusion I've authored some craziness
[1:20:48] but the word of the Lord is getting me
[1:20:50] on track and all I got to do is find
[1:20:53] myself in in his word just how he
[1:20:57] brought it if I can believe it others
[1:21:00] can believe it too sometimes we want to
[1:21:02] believe for other people we say that's
[1:21:04] going to be too strong or too hard don't
[1:21:06] give her that tape don't give him that
[1:21:09] tape that's going to be too much for
[1:21:10] them but you believed it that's right
[1:21:13] and the True Believer believes the word
[1:21:16] and so God works out all those details I
[1:21:19] said this brother brother mcra told me
[1:21:22] this I was talking to him the other day
[1:21:25] and I was talking I think I shared it
[1:21:27] here maybe I didn't but I was talking
[1:21:29] how I had to bury two of my brothers
[1:21:31] this year my brother Edgar and then all
[1:21:33] of most of you know my brother Jay or
[1:21:36] Jordan We buried them it was you know
[1:21:39] hard and very hurtful to have to uh lay
[1:21:43] them to rest they're my brothers and I
[1:21:45] know that I love them and I wanted to
[1:21:47] see them go deeper in the things of the
[1:21:51] word and brother McGraw said something
[1:21:54] to me that was so profound and simple
[1:21:57] and he said you know brother Israel the
[1:21:58] Lord loves your family more than you do
[1:22:02] yeah that's
[1:22:03] true I want you to think about that you
[1:22:07] think you love them but he loves them
[1:22:10] more so why don't you just put your
[1:22:12] family in God's hands cuz he'll take
[1:22:16] better care of them then you worrying
[1:22:20] about them amen and that so helped me
[1:22:23] and it just it just blessed me and you
[1:22:28] know thinking of this um you know these
[1:22:32] uh disciplines of don't adding and don't
[1:22:33] taking away and how you know I'm coming
[1:22:36] back to those roots of you know I just
[1:22:39] I'm just committed to what God has sent
[1:22:41] in this day and I thank God for it now
[1:22:44] as I go further into that we'll see that
[1:22:48] in the word of the Lord there was a
[1:22:51] commandment for that same word to be
[1:22:56] spoken in the ears of the entire
[1:23:00] congregation so when the word has come
[1:23:03] now it was commanded to come it was
[1:23:07] protected with don't add or take away
[1:23:10] from it now why do we do that now hear o
[1:23:15] Israel these Commandments these laws and
[1:23:18] these precepts and in Exodus 24 and: 7
[1:23:22] and the Bible says and he took the the
[1:23:24] book of the Covenant and read it in the
[1:23:27] audience of the people and they said all
[1:23:31] that the Lord had said will we do and be
[1:23:35] obedient Deuteronomy 17:19 says and it
[1:23:38] shall be with him and he shall read
[1:23:41] therein all the days of his life that he
[1:23:44] may learn to fear the lord his God to
[1:23:46] keep all the words of this law and these
[1:23:49] statutes to do them and this is talking
[1:23:53] about King Josiah or he's talking about
[1:23:55] a King when he sits upon his throne and
[1:23:58] how he's supposed to write these things
[1:23:59] down and continue further into that word
[1:24:02] Deuteronomy
[1:24:04] 31:1 says this I'm quoting your Bible
[1:24:07] now you might get happy you might say
[1:24:11] Amen it's not my word it's not your it's
[1:24:14] God's word amen hallelujah in
[1:24:17] Deuteronomy 3111 says when all Israel is
[1:24:21] come to appear before the Lord thy God
[1:24:24] and the place which he shall choose Thou
[1:24:27] shalt read this law before all Israel in
[1:24:31] their hearing gather the people together
[1:24:34] men and women and children and thy
[1:24:36] stranger that is within thy Gates that
[1:24:39] they may hear that they may learn and
[1:24:43] fear the lord your God and observe to do
[1:24:46] all the words of this law and that their
[1:24:50] children which have not known anything
[1:24:53] may do What
[1:24:55] like what part are they supposed to
[1:24:58] hear not the seven seal that's for the
[1:25:00] older ones
[1:25:02] right you can't you can't let them hear
[1:25:04] marriage and divorce
[1:25:06] right you know there's parts of the law
[1:25:08] you can't let the little Bitties you
[1:25:10] can't let the little ones hear that it's
[1:25:11] true it's mature content I guarantee you
[1:25:14] our little ones are hearing more mature
[1:25:16] content than perhaps we
[1:25:20] realize this was a commandment of the
[1:25:23] Lord let me finish the scripture there
[1:25:25] it says and their children which have
[1:25:28] not known anything may hear and learn to
[1:25:31] fear the lord your God as long as you
[1:25:34] live in the land whether you go to
[1:25:37] Jordan to possess it Joshua
[1:25:40] 8:34 says
[1:25:42] this and afterwards he read all the
[1:25:45] words of the law the blessings and the
[1:25:48] cursings according to all that is
[1:25:50] written in the book of the law there was
[1:25:53] not a word of all that Moses commandment
[1:25:58] which Joshua read not before all the
[1:26:02] congregation of Israel with the women
[1:26:06] and the little ones and the strangers
[1:26:09] that were conversant among
[1:26:14] them 2 Kings 8:23 verse 2 and the King
[1:26:19] went up into the house of the Lord and
[1:26:21] all the men of Judah and all the
[1:26:23] inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and
[1:26:25] the priest and the prophets and all the
[1:26:28] people both small and great and he read
[1:26:32] in their
[1:26:34] ears all the words of the book of the
[1:26:37] Covenant which was found in the house of
[1:26:41] the Lord that was a great revival time
[1:26:43] for Israel when Josiah got uh he got I
[1:26:48] believe that's the king's name got that
[1:26:50] book and they read it in the ears of the
[1:26:53] people and turned turned the kingdom
[1:26:54] upside down and not only did he read it
[1:26:57] he made sure all Israel heard it and
[1:27:01] read it and the women and the children
[1:27:04] and the
[1:27:05] visitors it's for everybody to hear
[1:27:08] everybody to have it heard read to them
[1:27:12] Nehemiah 8:1 says and all the people
[1:27:16] gathered themselves together as one man
[1:27:18] in the street that was before the
[1:27:20] Watergate and they spake unto Ezra The
[1:27:22] Scribe to bring the book of the law of
[1:27:24] Moses which the Lord had commanded to
[1:27:27] Israel and Ezra the priest brought the
[1:27:30] law before the congregation both of men
[1:27:32] and women and all that could hear with
[1:27:35] understanding upon the first day of the
[1:27:38] seventh month and he read therein before
[1:27:42] the street that was before the water
[1:27:44] great from the morning until midday
[1:27:49] before the men and the women and those
[1:27:51] that could understand and the ears of
[1:27:54] all the people were
[1:27:56] attentive unto the book of the law the
[1:28:01] word is being preached that's not the
[1:28:03] time to go get a bathroom break that's
[1:28:06] not the time to go and get something to
[1:28:09] drink that's the time to be attentive to
[1:28:12] keep your feet stop the shuffling and
[1:28:15] the hustling and the bustling and the
[1:28:17] riddling and the rattling the scratching
[1:28:19] and this and and that the word is being
[1:28:22] read your your word his word is being
[1:28:27] read for your ears to hear it and I
[1:28:30] guarantee you if there's anything the
[1:28:31] devil don't want you to get that's a
[1:28:34] portion of God's word to drop down in
[1:28:38] your spirit if he can Sidetrack you and
[1:28:42] get you upset and looking at who wore
[1:28:44] what and how this didn't happen and
[1:28:46] whatever he has got you conquered the
[1:28:50] word of the Lord is pure every word of
[1:28:53] God is pure and you know with the
[1:28:56] Commandment of writing it all and
[1:28:58] keeping it all and then don't add or
[1:29:00] take away he adds another
[1:29:04] tremendous profound statement concerning
[1:29:07] the word and that is this the word of
[1:29:10] the Lord will not ever return unto him
[1:29:14] void it will always accomplish what it
[1:29:19] was sent for it's got a purpose it's got
[1:29:22] a plan you can read it in the funeral
[1:29:24] read it in the marriage ceremony read it
[1:29:26] on your way to work read it in church
[1:29:28] read it out loud it will
[1:29:31] never return unto God void or empty it
[1:29:35] has weight it has power and there's a
[1:29:38] reason why we read from no service is
[1:29:41] complete you didn't have church yet if
[1:29:44] you didn't hear the word of the Lord if
[1:29:46] you didn't write anything down that the
[1:29:49] Lord said and you couldn't capture or
[1:29:52] remember remember anything then you
[1:29:54] really didn't um accomplish what you
[1:29:57] came here for you came here to get a
[1:30:00] word from not the pastor not the church
[1:30:04] not the you came here to get a word from
[1:30:07] so you can leave here and say God told
[1:30:11] me God told me I'm Healed today God told
[1:30:16] me I was a Believer God told me I'm
[1:30:19] going to heaven that's how personal you
[1:30:22] want it to beujah when he speaks when he
[1:30:27] speaks it becomes your word if you catch
[1:30:30] it
[1:30:32] this in Nehemiah chapter 8 says so verse
[1:30:37] 8 so they read in the book of The Law of
[1:30:39] God
[1:30:41] distinctly that word distinctly means
[1:30:43] making it clear it's uh making it
[1:30:47] clearly and gave the
[1:30:50] sense and caused them to understand the
[1:30:53] reading praise Lord
[1:30:54] Verse 18 nemiah 8:18 also Day by Day
[1:30:59] from the first day until the last day he
[1:31:04] read in the book of The Law of God and
[1:31:06] they kept the feast seven days and on
[1:31:09] the eth day with a solemn assembly
[1:31:12] according unto the
[1:31:13] manner can I
[1:31:17] continue I just asked that out of
[1:31:19] formality it really is not an a answer
[1:31:23] that I need need from that I'm going to
[1:31:26] continue but it just kind of includes
[1:31:28] you when I ask right can I go a little
[1:31:32] further now don't that feel good and I
[1:31:34] said okay I guess I will all
[1:31:38] right and Nehemiah chapter 9 verse3 this
[1:31:42] might shock some of you but it's in your
[1:31:45] Bible in verse three it says and they
[1:31:47] stood up in the place in their place and
[1:31:51] read in the book of The Law of the Lord
[1:31:53] their God one fourth part of the
[1:31:57] day and another fourth part they
[1:32:00] confessed in worship what's two fours
[1:32:04] two 1/4 1/4 that's half of the day now
[1:32:06] they're reading the word the other
[1:32:08] fourth they've confessed In Worship the
[1:32:12] Lord their God so half of the day
[1:32:15] they're reading the word or quarter of
[1:32:18] the day their reading of the way word
[1:32:20] another quarter of the day they conf
[1:32:24] fessing and
[1:32:25] worshiping so what do you think the
[1:32:27] other half of their day is going to
[1:32:31] be it will set the
[1:32:34] course if you're reading one quarter of
[1:32:36] the day if you're worshiping the other
[1:32:39] quarter of the day the rest of your day
[1:32:42] is done or should be the course of your
[1:32:45] day should be nothing but Praises
[1:32:47] blessings and thank you Lord right but
[1:32:51] many of us can't even give church a
[1:32:54] quarter of the
[1:32:55] daybody say Amen all
[1:32:58] right no the service is too long
[1:33:03] huh Jeremiah 3:6 it says therefore go
[1:33:06] thou and read in the road which thou
[1:33:08] Hast written from my mouth the words of
[1:33:10] the Lord in the ears of the people in
[1:33:14] the Lord's house upon the fasting day
[1:33:17] Acts chapter 13 verse 27
[1:33:29] Acts chapter 15:21 I'll take skip skip
[1:33:33] 13 1521 for Moses of old time hath in
[1:33:37] every city them that preach him being
[1:33:40] read in the
[1:33:42] synagogues every Sabbath day 2
[1:33:47] Corinthians
[1:33:48] 3:14 the scripture says but their minds
[1:33:51] were blinded for until this day
[1:33:53] remaineth the same Veil un taken away in
[1:33:55] the reading of the Old Testament which
[1:33:57] Veil is done away in Christ but even
[1:34:00] unto this day when Moses is read the
[1:34:04] veil is upon their heart look at this
[1:34:07] epistle in Colossians chapter 4 and 1
[1:34:11] Thessalonians chapter 5 look at what
[1:34:13] Paul says about this epistle verse 16
[1:34:17] closing the chapter closing the book he
[1:34:20] says when this epistle is read among you
[1:34:23] cause that it be read also in the Church
[1:34:27] of the Leo
[1:34:28] Deans and that you likewise read the
[1:34:31] epistle from leod DEA 1 Thessalonians
[1:34:35] chap 5: 27 says I charge you by the Lord
[1:34:39] that this epistle be read unto all the
[1:34:44] holy
[1:34:46] Brethren so this is Paul telling the
[1:34:48] church to read this epistle not part of
[1:34:52] it not some of it not the part you like
[1:34:54] all of it so that the church can hear
[1:34:58] all the words of the law
[1:35:02] now this is a a
[1:35:05] beautiful understanding to be able to
[1:35:08] take all of the word have it be read in
[1:35:12] our hearing and for the purpose that we
[1:35:16] would learn to fear the lord and not to
[1:35:20] fear our
[1:35:22] circumstances not to fear what man can
[1:35:25] do unto you God has given us a
[1:35:31] tremendous Heritage when he has revealed
[1:35:34] his word to us there's nothing greater
[1:35:37] it there's no greater document than the
[1:35:39] word of the Lord and when that is
[1:35:42] dropped down into your life into your
[1:35:44] spirit into your heart you'll become a
[1:35:47] new person a new man and you can have
[1:35:49] whatever that word says you can have
[1:35:52] irrespective of who believes believes it
[1:35:54] and who does not believe it he said in
[1:35:56] his word it will not return void he also
[1:36:00] says that faith it comes by hearing and
[1:36:05] hearing comes by the word of the Lord so
[1:36:09] this is how and why we gather it's the
[1:36:12] highlight of the service it's the most
[1:36:13] important part it's a part that you
[1:36:15] should be taking notes of it's the part
[1:36:18] this is the part where your spiritual
[1:36:20] man is being
[1:36:22] fed through the word of the Lord now
[1:36:26] this
[1:36:28] is profound it's it's
[1:36:31] tremendous now the the the the Lord
[1:36:34] tells us in his Commandments it's it's
[1:36:37] included in there in Deuteronomy chapter
[1:36:40] 20 and that is the Commandment to not
[1:36:45] fear do not fear them he actually gives
[1:36:49] this commandment and uh he's instructing
[1:36:54] Israel in these things and I want you to
[1:36:57] take a scripture there if we can take
[1:37:01] which one did I call Deuteronomy chapter
[1:37:03] 20 and let's see if we can read a little
[1:37:06] bit of that
[1:37:10] okay I think I printed it out here maybe
[1:37:13] I didn't I'll pick it up right here
[1:37:16] Deuteronomy chapter
[1:37:19] 20 verses number 1- 4
[1:37:23] and then we'll touch on verse number
[1:37:26] eight when thou goest out to battle
[1:37:29] against thine enemies and see horses and
[1:37:32] chariots and people more than thou be
[1:37:36] not afraid of them for the Lord thy God
[1:37:40] is with thee which brought thee up out
[1:37:43] of the land of Egypt and it shall be
[1:37:46] when ye are come nigh unto the battle
[1:37:49] that the priest shall approach and speak
[1:37:52] unto the people
[1:37:54] and shall say unto them here o Israel ye
[1:37:58] approach this day unto the battle
[1:38:00] against your enemies let not your hearts
[1:38:03] faint fear not do not tremble neither be
[1:38:08] terrifi because of
[1:38:11] them for the Lord your God is he that
[1:38:15] goeth with you to fight for you against
[1:38:20] your enemies to save you
[1:38:25] and the officer shall speak further unto
[1:38:28] the people and they shall say what man
[1:38:30] is there that is fearful and
[1:38:33] fainthearted let him go return into his
[1:38:36] house in other words stay home go home
[1:38:39] go back if you're fearful and you're
[1:38:41] afraid because fear is
[1:38:46] contagious and unbelief is contagious
[1:38:49] too and it's a very strong voice and
[1:38:53] it's so strong and so powerful this is
[1:38:56] what is against your faith the reason
[1:38:59] why we don't walk in our healing is
[1:39:01] because of unbelief sin remember Israel
[1:39:05] was healed and they walked in their
[1:39:07] healing until sin enter into the camp
[1:39:11] and we don't like to look at it that the
[1:39:12] reason why we're sick is because of sin
[1:39:15] but sin is
[1:39:17] unbelief and when the word of God
[1:39:19] already declared that we are already
[1:39:22] healed what does it do me any good
[1:39:26] speaking something contrary to the word
[1:39:29] that's already been declared over your
[1:39:34] healing the Lord is with you don't fear
[1:39:39] them you've already
[1:39:42] won the victory has already been
[1:39:46] won he fought the Battle and he won he
[1:39:51] won after three days and night he won
[1:39:56] that day on Calvary he won when he got
[1:39:59] up from the grave with all power in his
[1:40:03] hands and he gave that power to his
[1:40:08] church
[1:40:10] amen these are
[1:40:13] promises these are
[1:40:15] blessings that you the believer should
[1:40:17] walk in you know we see that in Judges
[1:40:20] chapter 7 as well that Gideon tell tells
[1:40:23] those men that are fearful and afraid to
[1:40:26] go back because fear is contagious it
[1:40:31] has torment it has no value in it it's
[1:40:35] not keeping it real it's keeping it
[1:40:38] false you say well I'm just keeping it
[1:40:41] real I can see those giants they're
[1:40:42] bigger than they're you're not keeping
[1:40:44] it real that's contrary to the word
[1:40:47] you're breeding fear what I need is
[1:40:51] Faith because faith faith will sign my
[1:40:55] pardon faith will give my inner man the
[1:40:58] power to move forward and to go
[1:41:01] on faith is the victory that
[1:41:06] overcomes Le
[1:41:08] oysa overcomes the world and the
[1:41:11] Temptations and the lies of the devil
[1:41:13] it's your faith not you're crying not
[1:41:17] that you deserve it not it's your turn
[1:41:19] that you know it wasn't fair it's none
[1:41:21] of that is overcoming the overcoming
[1:41:24] power is your
[1:41:28] faith amen can I get a witness here this
[1:41:31] morning your faith overcomes the world
[1:41:36] it's by faith that whatever you're going
[1:41:39] through you will overcome by
[1:41:43] that
[1:41:45] now this
[1:41:48] fear has torment as the scripture says
[1:41:52] and it's
[1:41:54] contrary to the plan of almighty God but
[1:42:00] it's designed to be there because that's
[1:42:02] the rules to the game or to the battle
[1:42:05] EXA the Battleground is in your mind
[1:42:09] that was
[1:42:10] established and the prophet of God tells
[1:42:12] us that the that the human being is made
[1:42:16] up of those five senses in science tells
[1:42:20] us this see taste feel smell in here
[1:42:24] that's your
[1:42:25] body he said draw three rings and then
[1:42:28] he he brings it down to your
[1:42:31] spirit conscience memory reason
[1:42:34] affections and
[1:42:37] imaginations and then the third part
[1:42:40] that makes up the man is the soul where
[1:42:44] you either have faith or doubt and he
[1:42:48] said is there in the soul that's where
[1:42:50] the Battleground is and I was trying to
[1:42:54] process this whole idea of you know
[1:42:57] Faith coming by hearing the word of the
[1:42:59] Lord what word is is there greater than
[1:43:02] the word that's been recorded on tape
[1:43:05] think of that the message the voice of
[1:43:08] God the word of the Lord and I can even
[1:43:10] side with some of the brothers that
[1:43:12] would say you know well brother isra we
[1:43:14] have the best it's on the tapes why
[1:43:16] don't we just listen to the tapes
[1:43:18] because that was the word of the Lord
[1:43:20] made manifest and I I go with that and I
[1:43:23] agree with that
[1:43:24] absolutely and then when I'm listening
[1:43:27] to the
[1:43:28] tapes he tells us how to raise our
[1:43:31] family how to baptize how to do
[1:43:35] church so what am I supposed to do with
[1:43:37] that we just listen to it for the sake
[1:43:40] of listening to it or we to listen to it
[1:43:43] and then do it
[1:43:46] sir and this is that's the whole
[1:43:48] challenge right there not hating on
[1:43:49] nobody doesn't bother me one bit or the
[1:43:52] other whoever wants to believe half of
[1:43:53] it part of it twist it what that's not
[1:43:55] my business I I I'm coming to the
[1:43:58] understanding more and more it really
[1:44:00] doesn't matter what somebody else
[1:44:01] believe or don't believe I'm trying to
[1:44:04] get this man to believe every word and
[1:44:08] that is a challenge to get my inner man
[1:44:10] to believe every word and there so many
[1:44:14] demonic forces that are against me that
[1:44:17] have been brewed up in me from a little
[1:44:18] boy coming all the way up and I'm
[1:44:20] battling me more than anybody else so I
[1:44:24] need to spend my time on my knees before
[1:44:29] my word and my savior that he would give
[1:44:33] me the faith for a body change and for a
[1:44:37] Rapture amen amen who cares what the
[1:44:41] doctrine is who care who's off the work
[1:44:43] who cares what the next church is doing
[1:44:47] huh and so he brings it in this message
[1:44:50] the greatest battle ever fought he
[1:44:53] brings out the body the spirit and the
[1:44:57] soul and look at what he says here in
[1:44:59] this message just for a few moments now
[1:45:05] and paragraph 73 inside of the body is a
[1:45:09] soul and that soul is controlled by
[1:45:13] imaginations conscience memory reasons
[1:45:16] and affections that's the thing that
[1:45:19] controls the soul but the spirit it only
[1:45:22] has one sense oh let's get it the spirit
[1:45:27] has one sense and that sense is either
[1:45:30] dominates it is Faith or doubt that's
[1:45:33] exactly there's only one Avenue to it
[1:45:36] that's free moral agency you can accept
[1:45:39] doubt or you can accept Faith either one
[1:45:42] you want to work on therefore Satan
[1:45:45] begin at the principal part to cause the
[1:45:48] spirit of man to doubt God's word god
[1:45:52] began at the principal part to lay his
[1:45:55] word in that spirit that you are that's
[1:46:01] what does it so let's focus our mind
[1:46:04] just for a moment maybe I won't preach
[1:46:06] maybe I'll just talk for a few minutes
[1:46:09] okay and I hope something will be said
[1:46:11] that will help you but this let's go
[1:46:13] back and look at the Commandment to
[1:46:16] Joshua the Commandment was keep these
[1:46:19] words don't let it depart out of your
[1:46:21] mouth
[1:46:23] but then he tells them something that I
[1:46:25] I that I want to just focus in on he
[1:46:27] tells them to
[1:46:30] meditate now meditating is different
[1:46:33] than you speaking the word or hearing it
[1:46:36] spoke to meditate it goes into where you
[1:46:41] slow that word down you speed it up you
[1:46:45] break it up in little quarters you break
[1:46:47] it up into little 16 or whatever it is
[1:46:50] you break it you bring it back in you
[1:46:52] break it you bring it back you're
[1:46:54] meditating and He commands Joshua to
[1:46:58] meditate on these words I I guarantee
[1:47:02] you I guarantee you if you just take any
[1:47:05] Scripture and John 3:16 and you just
[1:47:08] don't read it like that or read it out
[1:47:09] of memory and you begin to meditate on
[1:47:12] you it will speak to you in a way that
[1:47:15] is never spoke to you before it's a it's
[1:47:19] a part of not just reading the word but
[1:47:21] it's reading it and then meditate when
[1:47:23] you're
[1:47:24] meditating you're absorbing it right
[1:47:29] amen Amen on a comprehensive level with
[1:47:34] your imaginations now your conscience
[1:47:38] your memory and your
[1:47:41] affections it's being downloaded a
[1:47:44] better way a different
[1:47:46] way huh very good amen so you take notes
[1:47:49] in the
[1:47:50] service so you can take those goes back
[1:47:53] and then meditate on
[1:47:56] them how many can see that a little
[1:48:00] bit the scripture actually tells us to
[1:48:02] do
[1:48:03] this me see if I can take a scripture
[1:48:05] here in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verses
[1:48:08] number
[1:48:11] 1-8 I really love this scripture Paul is
[1:48:14] really sharing how the resurrection
[1:48:17] happened and he's talking about how 500
[1:48:20] saw him and then a group above that saw
[1:48:22] saw him and then his disciples saw him
[1:48:25] and then after that James saw him and
[1:48:27] then last of all I saw him it's a
[1:48:31] beautiful documentation how Paul lays
[1:48:34] that out but he says this moreover
[1:48:35] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[1:48:39] which I preached unto you which you also
[1:48:41] have received and wherein you stand by
[1:48:44] which ye also are saved if you keep in
[1:48:51] memory
[1:48:52] what I've preached unto you unless you
[1:48:55] have believed in vain for I've delivered
[1:48:59] unto you first of all that which also I
[1:49:02] received and so this uh word memory
[1:49:08] in uh it's it doesn't really use a Greek
[1:49:12] word there it um it's a Greek phrase
[1:49:15] that the Greek diaglog talks about and
[1:49:17] the other translations bring it in it
[1:49:20] means to hold firmly if you
[1:49:24] retain and the King James version says
[1:49:26] keep in memory and so I was talking to
[1:49:31] the Saints to the young people about if
[1:49:34] I was to encourage a young man coming up
[1:49:37] I've been 30 plus years following the
[1:49:39] Lord and I if I can encourage a young
[1:49:42] man or a group of young people and that
[1:49:44] would be to begin to develop those
[1:49:49] skills of memorizing the scripture
[1:49:52] and what it's doing it's writing it in
[1:49:55] your heart you're hiding the word you're
[1:49:58] documenting it in your heart now a lot
[1:50:00] of people can memorize scripture it's
[1:50:02] just a memory but you're going to
[1:50:04] memorize
[1:50:06] something you will memorize
[1:50:09] something why not it be the scriptures
[1:50:13] use the ram in your head to download the
[1:50:18] word he said well Brothers memorizing
[1:50:20] scripture don't save nobody okay go
[1:50:22] memorize the rap music like some of us
[1:50:25] did and tell me how that work out for
[1:50:27] you or memorize the garbage that's out
[1:50:30] there huh your memory you're going to
[1:50:34] mem remember something and so recording
[1:50:39] this and memorizing this and so I I
[1:50:41] shared this I think with brother Joe and
[1:50:44] this little book and I shared it with
[1:50:45] the youth there and I'll share it here
[1:50:46] today I ran into this gentleman that was
[1:50:50] into this scripture memoris ation his
[1:50:53] name is Thomas
[1:50:55] Meyer he's a professional he he
[1:50:58] remembers books and books of the he can
[1:51:00] quote the entire Book of Revelation by
[1:51:03] memory and so 20 years ago I was doing a
[1:51:06] job in Tombstone and I I was taking a

[1:51:38] restaurant we in Tombstone what do you
[1:51:40] want to sit at my table for so he sits
[1:51:43] down and he introduces himself his name
[1:51:46] is Thomas Meer and he told me he
[1:51:48] memorizes the scripture so I said what
[1:51:50] does Malachi 4 say and he quoted it from
[1:51:54] the beginning the entire chapter and I
[1:51:56] was shocked and
[1:51:58] so I took his number and we exchanged
[1:52:01] this was 20 plus years ago I enjoyed it
[1:52:04] and a few years ago I looked him up and
[1:52:05] he's still doing his thing he's married
[1:52:07] it's his ministry I think he's been in
[1:52:09] these great places and great halls and
[1:52:11] so Sharon and I went to um Cincinnati
[1:52:15] and we saw the arc enclosure there the
[1:52:18] ark experience how many he's been there
[1:52:21] beautiful it's tremendous it's just
[1:52:23] it'll blow your mind so at the bookstore
[1:52:25] there there's a book by Thomas Meyer and
[1:52:28] I grabbed and said Sharon I met this guy
[1:52:30] I I knew him so I bought that book it's
[1:52:32] a Bible actually in principles and I
[1:52:35] gave it to the young man that was
[1:52:36] baptized the other day hope he reads it
[1:52:39] but in that book he gives these three
[1:52:43] pillars for memorizing the scripture and
[1:52:46] I liked it and actually it's scriptural
[1:52:48] if you'll dig deeper into the word and
[1:52:51] those three pillars are
[1:52:53] that you read the scriptures out
[1:52:57] loud number two is that you hear the
[1:53:00] scriptures being read coming through
[1:53:01] your hearing and you actually write them
[1:53:07] down these things begin to help to
[1:53:10] develop the scriptures and he says and I
[1:53:12] I like it he says find a place that you
[1:53:15] need the word to speak to you on where
[1:53:17] you're dealing in your life and then
[1:53:19] start memorizing those scriptures
[1:53:22] because you can use that in your memory
[1:53:25] now memorizing the scriptures doesn't
[1:53:28] save you but believing a scripture that
[1:53:31] has been memorized will save you and it
[1:53:35] will help you and I was trying to place
[1:53:39] brother Joe for years at a time this
[1:53:42] whole internet in the how to handle it
[1:53:45] you know should I smash my my my my
[1:53:48] smartphone should I just get rid of it
[1:53:50] altogether how can I incorporate it in
[1:53:52] my life life and I was just really
[1:53:53] dealing with that brother Howard and
[1:53:56] what this internet and
[1:53:58] how how it's just taken over it's like
[1:54:00] electricity it's like electricity we use
[1:54:03] it we all use it we consume it we're all
[1:54:05] part of it and as I was meditating on
[1:54:09] that I thought you know the Lord knew
[1:54:12] that the internet would be here in this
[1:54:14] age he didn't allow it to come when
[1:54:17] brother Brandon was here I believe
[1:54:19] that's on purpose but he allowed it to
[1:54:21] come in this and I was like oh yes the
[1:54:26] reason why for a Believer now the
[1:54:29] internet exists is so that I can consume
[1:54:34] the word in a better way and that is the
[1:54:39] only reason as it pertains to a Believer
[1:54:42] because if it's not uh in agreement with
[1:54:46] my faith and my body change and for the
[1:54:49] Rapture it's just
[1:54:51] nonsense and the age is full of these
[1:54:55] channels of darkness and evil and
[1:54:58] distractions trying to take away my
[1:55:01] faith and here we are in an age the
[1:55:04] darkest of all the ages and God has
[1:55:08] given us these devices that we can
[1:55:11] comprehend we can consume we can slow it
[1:55:14] down we can record it we can put it in
[1:55:16] Brick print we can put it on any device
[1:55:18] we can consume his word and if you're
[1:55:22] using using it for any other purpose
[1:55:24] then you tell me what it's
[1:55:27] about internalize that think about it
[1:55:29] just for a moment think about it just
[1:55:31] for a
[1:55:33] moment if the internet that you're using
[1:55:36] is for any other purpose outside of a
[1:55:41] Rapture in the body change then tell me
[1:55:43] its use and
[1:55:49] value what's the value for it
[1:55:53] For Your Entertainment for your fun huh
[1:55:56] huh what's the value of it
[1:55:59] so that's my little piece you can take
[1:56:03] it
[1:56:05] or well just take it
[1:56:09] that so with that in mind
[1:56:13] I went further into the
[1:56:17] scriptures and how the scriptures are
[1:56:20] telling us to to avoid profane
[1:56:26] babblings and things that war against
[1:56:29] your soul let let me ask you this if
[1:56:33] it's wrong for me to say it do you think
[1:56:37] it's wrong for me to hear it
[1:56:39] to or to see it because this is this is
[1:56:43] our spirit man this is who we are
[1:56:47] conscience memory reasons affections and
[1:56:50] imaginations is who we are and the enemy
[1:56:55] wants to use all of those
[1:56:59] channels yes he
[1:57:01] does and if you're a good soldier and a
[1:57:03] steward of the word you'll recognize
[1:57:06] that and you'll see that the main thing
[1:57:08] in this whole the whole purpose of being
[1:57:11] here is that my faith would be ready we
[1:57:15] don't have faith enough for tooth a let
[1:57:18] alone a Rapture of Divine Healing think
[1:57:20] of it so what should be encouraged it
[1:57:23] should be our faith let's take a
[1:57:26] scripture here
[1:57:29] in 1 Timothy Chap 4:
[1:57:37] 11-16 and look at that in light of the
[1:57:41] greatest battle ever
[1:57:43] fought these things command and teach
[1:57:46] verse 12 let no man despise thy youth
[1:57:50] but be thou an example of
[1:57:53] Believers in word in conversation that
[1:57:57] word conversation means conduct in word
[1:57:59] in conversation in charity in spirit in
[1:58:03] faith in Purity till I come give what
[1:58:09] attendance to what the
[1:58:13] magazines reading the
[1:58:15] headlines you're going to read something
[1:58:17] what reading is he talking
[1:58:20] about what am I supposed to give
[1:58:22] attendance to reading of what what is
[1:58:26] Paul telling Timothy to give yourself in
[1:58:29] the tendance to reading to reading
[1:58:35] what I knew it was going to tighten up I
[1:58:38] didn't know it was going to get that
[1:58:41] tight attendance to reading to
[1:58:44] exhortation to Doctrine neglect not the
[1:58:47] gift that is in thee which was given
[1:58:49] thee by Prophecy with the laying on of
[1:58:51] hand of the
[1:58:53] prosperity what did it say there
[1:58:56] meditate upon these
[1:58:59] things give thyself holy to them that
[1:59:04] thy profiting may appear to all take
[1:59:07] heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine
[1:59:10] continue in them for in doing this thou
[1:59:13] shallal both save thyself and them that
[1:59:17] hear
[1:59:18] thee Ephesians 4:22 and3 says that you
[1:59:22] put off concerning the former
[1:59:26] conversation of the old
[1:59:32] man which is
[1:59:35] corrupt according to the deceitful
[1:59:38] lust how many's been born again and you
[1:59:42] know what the scripture is talking about
[1:59:43] the old man the things you used to do
[1:59:46] the old man tell
[1:59:49] me why the movies and the system out
[1:59:53] there is always trying to attract the
[1:59:56] old

[2:00:00] to speak into the new man that's right

[2:00:08] faith tell me tell me there it's it's by
[2:00:12] Design to catch your attention catch
[2:00:15] your eye keep you busy busy busy with
[2:00:18] everything but the word of the Lord
[2:00:23] mhm it says put off concerning the
[2:00:26] former conversation the old man which is
[2:00:29] corrupt according to the deceitful lust
[2:00:31] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[2:00:35] mind the Lord and that you put on the
[2:00:38] new man which is after God is created in
[2:00:42] righteousness and true Holiness and
[2:00:45] wherefore put away lying speak every man

[2:00:56] wrath neither give place to the
[2:01:05] devil let him that stole steal no more
[2:01:08] but rather let him labor working with
[2:01:10] his hands the things which is good that
[2:01:12] he may give to him that needeth let no
[2:01:15] corrupt
[2:01:17] communication proceed out of your

[2:05:53] and that's the gymnasium I've been in
[2:05:55] I've been working on it I'm not where I
[2:05:57] need to be but I am not going back to
[2:06:00] what I used to be because I maybe didn't
[2:06:03] say it and maybe I didn't start the
[2:06:05] foolishness but I sat there and I
[2:06:07] listened to it and I laughed at it and I
[2:06:11] somehow enjoyed it and I left it that
[2:06:14] that's what the worldly people do but I
[2:06:16] sat there with my body and consumed it
[2:06:20] with my eyes with my ears and I enjoyed
[2:06:24] it and I imagined with it and I and I
[2:06:26] and my my lust and all of that thing was
[2:06:29] all worked up in that and then I'm
[2:06:30] trying to make a
[2:06:33] Rapture when the Bible says to Holy

[2:07:52] me why you getting mad at me why you
[2:07:54] getting mad at the subject it's not you
[2:07:56] getting mad it's the spirit the FR that
[2:07:59] wants to be your friend the evil spirit
[2:08:01] that wants to be your friend to get you
[2:08:03] to continue in the filth and the
[2:08:06] nonsense that the internet has to offer
[2:08:09] and it ain't doing nobody any good it'd
[2:08:12] be better off if we had nothing but live
[2:08:17] live under a tree somewhere and preach
[2:08:20] the gospel
[2:08:22] be better off but if you going to use it
[2:08:26] use it to his
[2:08:31] Advantage yes now I love the internet

[2:08:58] get some
[2:08:59] money so you can pay your
[2:09:04] bills so you can serve the
[2:09:06] Lord right and that's those are the
[2:09:10] things that you need but you don't need
[2:09:13] to see the
[2:09:14] newest whatever movie that's coming out
[2:09:18] you don't need to see that huh that's
[2:09:21] right all right all right let's take one
[2:09:24] more scripture Hebrews 4:12 I'm going to
[2:09:27] close here for the word of God is quick
[2:09:31] and powerful and sharper than any
[2:09:33] two-edged sword piercing even to the
[2:09:36] dividing as center of the soul and the
[2:09:39] spirit and the joints and Marrow and is
[2:09:44] a discerner of the thoughts in the
[2:09:45] intents of the heart neither is there
[2:09:49] any creature that is not manifest in his
[2:09:52] sight but all things are naked and open
[2:09:55] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[2:09:59] to do you notice something how it says
[2:10:01] that the word of God is quick and
[2:10:03] powerful and then it goes into he is a
[2:10:08] discerner for the word is a person yes
[2:10:12] it is that is the Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:10:14] word form amen how many believe that
[2:10:19] just shall live by faith not by the
[2:10:21] internet live by faith not by your job
[2:10:24] live by faith the just shall
[2:10:27] live by faith we are alive today if
[2:10:31] we're the Justified and we're alive
[2:10:34] because of our faith our Revelation in
[2:10:36] this word amen we holy
[2:10:39] believe we shun profane things in Babel
[2:10:45] we um you know you your faith can
[2:10:50] company with anyone just so long as your
[2:10:54] faith is the one doing all the
[2:10:57] Talking if somebody else is doing the
[2:10:59] talking and it's not your faith then get
[2:11:02] out of that
[2:11:03] conversation get out of it because
[2:11:06] really what we're here for brother Kurt
[2:11:09] is that our
[2:11:11] faith that the faith that God gave to us
[2:11:15] to be sons and daughters in God that
[2:11:17] that would grow in us so much so that
[2:11:20] our body would change now I I realize
[2:11:23] that some of these things are very high
[2:11:25] and very you know it's a lot it's a lot
[2:11:28] to chew on but but somebody's GNA chew
[2:11:31] on
[2:11:32] them and I know that everybody can't see
[2:11:36] you maybe not see the importance of
[2:11:38] these things but you know what there was
[2:11:42] Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind he
[2:11:44] was the only one maybe others after said
[2:11:46] hey I want it to but he was the only one
[2:11:49] but God used
[2:11:50] him the love you Rebecca she was the one
[2:11:52] who got the ride with the
[2:11:54] camels and maybe after her some other
[2:11:58] sisters come man where's my camel
[2:12:00] train well you got to do what Rebecca
[2:12:04] did we know everybody came walk on water
[2:12:08] that Camel yes everybody can't walk on
[2:12:11] water but Peter
[2:12:14] did and everybody can't have all the
[2:12:17] blessings and the promises but if it's
[2:12:19] in the word of the Lord and this is how
[2:12:21] this is this has been revolutionary for
[2:12:23] me if it's in the word of the lord it's
[2:12:25] mine Hallelujah and you know what and
[2:12:28] you know what I don't have to ask
[2:12:29] anybody if it's okay if I can have it or
[2:12:32] or not because he told me everything in
[2:12:35] here is mine if I can believe it all
[2:12:40] things are possible to them that believe
[2:12:45] all all things are possible to them that
[2:12:47] believe that's me that's you that
[2:12:50] believe amen amen I believe if you take
[2:12:54] that word down in your heart and your
[2:12:56] spirit it will bless you and it will
[2:12:58] help you amen reexamine that content
[2:13:01] it's on inter it's Grievous it's
[2:13:03] Grievous I'm not talking about even the
[2:13:05] bad bad bad stuff there's some real bad
[2:13:07] stuff out there but then there's some
[2:13:09] stuff that's like questionable and it's
[2:13:12] not even Christian and it's like you
[2:13:14] can't even watch a movie without
[2:13:15] somebody swearing and then I got used to
[2:13:18] hearing them swearing think of that
[2:13:20] right think of that brother brother man
[2:13:22] brother sister think of that and then
[2:13:24] I'm listening to the movie and they're
[2:13:26] and and and they're cursing and then
[2:13:28] they're swearing and then I uh that's
[2:13:31] not me that's not me but it is kind of
[2:13:36] funny you know what be better off I
[2:13:38] don't see no
[2:13:41] movies yes
