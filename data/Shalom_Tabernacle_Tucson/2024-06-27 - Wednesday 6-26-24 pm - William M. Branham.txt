and we pray that you will meet with us tonight and will make the gospel that was preached by the apostles be made alive tonight in our midst May every Hungry Heart be fed with the good things of God May the Sinners be condemned of their unbelief and accept the Lord Jesus as their personal savior father we would pray especially for the sick and the needy may this be an hour of Deliverance for them we not only pray for those that are present tonight in this great audience but we would pray for those who are in the radio audience we were not able to get here tonight by some reason let thy Holy Spirit oh God come to their bedsides or wherever they may be and raise them up from their sickness that they might live and serve thee Grant these blessings in the name of Jesus we ask it amen you may be seated I I am just a little horse in my voice uh I've been speaking this afternoon for some time an Evangelistic service here at the temple and then just coming from other meetings also and they had some sort of a little bug flying around at home I don't know what they called it those at the doctor's cannot name I think they just call it virus and I don't know what the little Fell's name was but I'm sure sorry that he tried to get in my throat Satan must have sent him there because of this oncoming meeting I come anyhow because I know in who I have believed I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which we have committed to him against the day I found it in in my life's journey especially in my Ministry that when Satan makes a big fight he knows is a great blessing laying of hand so it's always at those times that we like to go on now our precious Brother David dupes has just brought a wonderful message in so much that I changed my texts when I was standing in the room listening to him to just a little short message before we pray for the sick the reason that I do this is to catch the feeling of the spirit of the people I that is essential we should do that you can take one man preaching an evangelist and let the Evangelist who has the anointing set down and then the pastor get up to make an alter call it's hard to do it you have to catch the spirit of the people and I believe that we're living in a great Needy Time a needing of the spirit of God in our churches and among our peoples and we're trusting at this coming week the Lord willing to see a great Revival start here at the angel Temple and spread throughout the country we're praying to God for this now I want to call your attention to just one scripture found in God's holy word St Matthew 12:42 and I was going to speak tonight on the subject of when the eagle stirs her nest and fluth over her young then we're running just a little late maybe that'll keep I wish to read from this part of the scripture and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here our Lord had been rebuked many of the people who had been following him and had seen his great Miracles and still they had not repented and he was uaing the cities that he had been in in the previous part of this chapter because in these cities he had performed a sign that all believers should know that that was the sign of the Messiah we spoke on it last evening and how that those who seemingly that God had ordained to eternal life by his for knowledge had believed on it and how that he had brought his disciples to him by this thing that he had performed this sign and they who was looking for the god Prophet to come they knew that that was he but many of them had disbelieved in the previous part of this chapter he was saying to them after he had performed these works and they had said that he was an evil spirit on him was the spirit of beab which was an evil spirit and to make it in words so we would understand that they believe that the spirit that he had that could tell Peter who he was and what his father's name was not seeing him before and could tell Phillip where he was before he came to the meeting and discerned the thoughts of their hearts they cled it as an evil spirit a fortune teller or some evil devil devil and Jesus had told them if you speak that against the son of man it shall be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost is come to speak against that it would never be forgiven and we find out that it was just as he said and he was speaking there and said th capernium which are exalted into heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works had been done in Sodom and Gomorrah that has been done in you it would remain until this day a degraded polluted city as Sodom was and yet Jesus said if them signs would have been done in Sodom it would remained and we find last night that the sign that he was doing was done by an Angel that was later called God just outside of Sodom that Abraham and to Sarah and their host but he never did that down in Sodom and he also referred to Jonah the prophet in all ages God has had man that he could put his hand on to do his work now God chooses man not machines he chooses man to work through he chose the the prophets of the Old Testament he chose his own son of the New Testament and the apostles and on down through the age he's always had people who would believe him God has never been without a witness sometimes it's gotten down to just a few but always there is a Remnant and he was referring back to Jonah and many times we like to say about Jonah of him being backslid now I'm not holding up so much for what he did but I believe that all things work together for good to them that love God sometimes we do things that we do not understand our own doings if we are led by the spirit of God every child of God in my hearing or hearing of my voice rather brother knows that sometimes that you do things that you think yourself is ridiculous when you become so so closed in with God when the Holy Spirit gets you in such a condition to you're fully surrendered to him I've seen Man soul filled with the Devil until it would take several men to hold him and then if Satan can put that kind of a power on a man fully surrendered to him how much more power can the Holy Spirit put on a man that surrendered to him to make a person in a wheelchair rise and walk to make the shadow of a man dying with cancer on a cop to jump to his feet screaming under the power of God for how much stronger is God than the devil and Jesus was speaking about Jonah and he told the story of how it happened we are all familiar with that story and let's stop just for a minute to straighten my expression that I made about Jonah I do not believe he was backslid I believe that he was he did what God told him not to do but God knew all the time that he was going to do it for God's infinite and he knows all things and Jonah was was taken out into the sea on his road to Tarsus and a great storm came up and they bound his feet and hands and throw him out in a big fish swallowed him went down to the bottom of the sea many fathoms de and he kept alive for three days and three nights I believe that to be the truth for the word of God said it's the truth and we are told or I have read that the people of Nineveh were worshippers of idols and their sins had got great and one of their gods especially the god of the sea was a whale and it was the god of the sea because it was the largest species in in the sea and the people their occupation was fishing and as all of them at their task that morning drawing in the Nets of fishes and all of a sudden up comes the god of the sea opens up his mouth and the prophet walks out sure they repented it was all in order God knows how to do things we just have to follow no matter if it seems ridiculous go do it anyhow if the spirit of God is leading and they repented in sackcloth and in ashes because a miracle like that taking place and here was Jesus standing there performing the signs of the Messiah and that generation called it the working of a devil Jesus said they'll raise up for they repented with of the preaching of Jonah and they rise in the day of the Judgment with this generation in condem it then he goes to the little Queen of the south in the days of Solomon now God had give a great gift to Solomon and Anyone who reads the scriptures knows that when God sends a gift to the earth and the people reject that gift it's always chaos to that generation they never Prosper they end up in judgment upon the Nations and if they accept the gift that God sins it's usually a millennium for those people they are blessed and we know as Bible readers that in the days of Solomon was a golden age for Israel why because of all the people with one Accord rallied around that great gift that Solomon had from God I I wonder what would take place tonight if all the churches in the United States would rally around the gift that God has given us that is the Holy Ghost God's gift what if all the churches would break down their barriers and would rally around that great gift of Godly brotherly love and the baptism of the Holy Spirit it would be the greatest defense this nation could have it would be better than all the scientists and atomic bombs and so forth that they could invent for that's what God wants us to do all of us in our different denominations is to recognize one another as brothers and sisters rallying around this great gift of God which is the holy ghost that comes with power and manifestation and demonstrations of his presence and there would not be one cruel word spoken against any move of God we'd all be one and one great big bundle of Godly love that's what it's going to take for the church to go in the Rapture Paul said thy might speak with tongues like men and angels and have not love it profits me nothing I could discern or have all the wisdoms and of the scriptures and know them all and have faith to move mountains I am still nothing what a disappointment it's going to be at the Judgment when man who thought that they were all right because they had Faith to heal the sick they had Faith to operate a gift and had great meetings great Evangelistic services and one Souls Jesus has forewarned us of those things many will come to me in that day and say God have not I cast out devils in your name and in your name done many mighty works then he said he would confess to them depart from me you workers of iniquity I never knew you it takes more than the power of gifts it takes more than jaring Church it takes the birth of the Holy Spirit to break down our walls and to unite us together as one great Christian body moving for one objective and one goal they did that in the days of Solomon while everybody came by they would speak of it as something great Solomon had a gift of discernment wisdom and people coming by would say oh don't you leave they would say to the passer by until you come and see what the Lord Our God has done for us would not that be wonderful to hear it again tonight come and see our God is a living God the news made headlines the only way they had to send news then was from lip to ear and that news swept out all over the world the KNN world that there was a great God up in Israel who was manifesting himself through his servant Solomon and all the people with one ACC carbas rallying around it Unity there's power in un then the news finally come to the little Queen all the way across the Sahara Desert way down in the utmost parts of the KNN world of that day down in the Sheba while every traveler would come by as pass through Israel and say oh you should go up there and see those people why are they just as B old as they can be they know there's not a flaw about their religion that's the way we want to believe it there's nothing wrong with the holy spirit it's a perfect gift of God to the church and they would keep speaking about the great things that Solomon would do now Faith cometh by what hearing hearing the word of God and you know when this word kept coming to this little Queen she began to believe that it was a truth and she began to thirst to go find out about it oh Jesus said ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost its savior or its strength it's forth good for nothing but to be cast out and trod under the feet of man made roads out of well I do not wish to be critical but to a certain degree we are letting this great blessing go to that the strength of the Holy Spirit should be in every member of the church what do you mean strength the power of the Resurrection the life that Jesus gave for the church should be operating in every member of it the body the strength salt will only save if it contacts but it must contact and if the church gets that burden on their heart to contact someone get someone saved then the strength is coming back into the church again and into to the people and this little woman first place she had a lot of a difficults the odds as we would call it in the world was against her the first place she was a woman and then she was a pagan a worshipper of idols and being in her position the queen she'd have to ask release from her own church before she could go up and T that Revival well you can imagine what the Pagan priest would say to her now look my dear do not be carried away with such a little fantastic things if there was any God to be made manifest we would have it right here in Shea our church would have it we'd be the ones that was doing it if that isn't a good attitude towards many people's today I trust that you don't think I'm criticizing I'm just making a declaration of facts now notice and she longed to go and he would they go get out the Scrolls and say now look you here this great God of ours was so and so she'd say I heard my my grandmother talk about that and she said she heard her grandmother talk about it but all we have is some written words of a God that once existed where is he today they tell me that those people up there in Israel has got a living God who's living among them operating through them I want to sit it blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for they shall be filled she made ready she was a sensible woman she said uh she Laden some animals down with gold and silver and frankincense and many great stones of great price let's think that she said this in her heart I'm not going to sit down here in Sheba and just be a wet rag if they've got a revival going on that manifest is the presence of a living God I'm going up to find out about it for if they've got that among them we haven't got it among us and I want to stop these Creeds and and find where there is something that can talk back bless that woman's heart she was hungering and thirsting for God and she laid in these animals with these gifts and perhaps she said this I'm going up I ain't going to take nobody else's word I'm going to find out for myself if it's a truth I'll support it if it isn't the truth I'll bring my gifts back that's a good idea if God's in it put everything behind it you got you're Soul your heart your mind your talent all that you've got give it to the glory of God if he isn't God then let it alone and find out where there is a God if it isn't a truth let it alone find out what is truth so then she had the cross of Sahara Desert now this company of she had a few guards Unix from the temple a few maids to wait on her you know how long it would take to cross the desert from Sheba to Jerusalem by a camel takes three months no wonder Jesus said she'll stand in the day of judgment and condemn this generation while some people in Los Angeles won't drive a Cadillac up here to hear about it look what she had to do come across Al SAR a desert on the back of a camel but there was something in her heart thirsty to find out if there was a God and if he lived and he lived in his people when you get the thirsting like that there's nothing going to hold you away from it I don't care what they call the people they've been called all kinds of names so is Jesus called Bea make any difference what the people says is what God is saying and so she tuck off here's something else had to confront her the children of Ishmael was on the desert Fleet footed Riders robbers murderers well what a what a a pray that would be for them
