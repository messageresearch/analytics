[1:29] the soul of them that were slain for the
[1:31] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:34] they held and they cried with a loud
[1:36] voice saying how long O Lord holy and
[1:39] true thust thou not judge and avenge our
[1:42] blood on them that dwell on the
[1:44] earth and white robes were given unto
[1:47] every one of them and was said unto them
[1:50] that they should rest yet for a little
[1:51] season until their fellow servants also

[9:51] me go but the gospel had to be preached
[9:54] just a second I was on the bed again
[9:57] like that no more
[10:00] about two months ago that you heard it
[10:02] read and the businessman's voes went
[10:04] over the world see and brother Norman in
[10:06] here I suppose he's in here somewhere
[10:08] tonight he translated all F Sate and
[10:10] pamplets went everywhere and ministers
[10:13] wrote in many of them and said one here
[10:15] I tell this very one been hundreds of
[10:17] them of course this one R said brother
[10:19] Brandon your vision in the businessman's
[10:22] voice and I appreciate Tommy Nichols
[10:24] although he isn't with the businessman
[10:26] no more I don't know why but he isn't
[10:28] but he put it in there just right
[10:30] what I said right there in that
[10:31] trinitarian magazine he said where I
[10:34] were Paul baptized in Jesus name and
[10:36] command that people do the same I've
[10:37] done the same see he put it just the way
[10:39] it was and so then uh I thought my and
[10:43] this Minister wrote in said brother Bram
[10:45] your vision which it could have been a
[10:46] vision said I don't want to say
[10:48] translation if Paul if I was caught up
[10:50] into this first heaven and seen that
[10:52] what about Paul that was C come up into
[10:54] the third Heavens what that he said he
[10:55] couldn't even talk about it see if he
[10:57] was caught up if it was a ketchup I
[10:59] don't no I can't say I couldn't tell you
[11:01] but this Minister said brother brand
[11:03] your vision sound very scriptural and
[11:05] all right until you talked about a horse
[11:08] being there said a horse in heaven said
[11:11] now see that
[11:13] ecclesiastical man wisdom mind see he
[11:17] said heaven was made for human beings
[11:20] not
[11:21] horses well I sat down Billy my son here
[11:25] put the letter right here in the old
[11:26] church office about three or four months
[11:28] ago
[11:30] I said my precious brother I'm surprised
[11:33] at your wisdom but and your knowing of
[11:36] the scripture I did not say that I was
[11:39] in heaven amen I said it was in a place
[11:43] like paradise because Christ was still
[11:46] above see but I said if it might satisfy
[11:49] you uh you turn over to Revelations 19
[11:52] and when Jesus comes out of the heavens
[11:54] of heav he's riding on a white horse and
[11:56] all the saints wom are riding
[12:00] [Music]
[12:01] abolutely
[12:07] up in that same place there was one
[12:09] looked like an eagle and one looked like
[12:11] an
[12:13] O where's them horses that come got
[12:18] Elijah just goes to show you see the
[12:21] human mind just wants something to pick
[12:23] on that's right now I notice but I was
[12:27] just thinking as this precious Godly
[12:30] brother John I just thought it be a good
[12:32] place to inject that just before closing
[12:34] see if John looked over there and them
[12:38] was of his Brethren see his Brethren had
[12:43] had to suffer a little then see the Lord
[12:46] God permitted me to see my brethren and
[12:49] the saints that were waiting for the
[12:51] coming of the Lord
[12:53] notice they were not under the altar of
[12:57] sacrifice mine was but these was they
[13:00] were
[13:00] Martyrs see mine wasn't under the
[13:03] martyrs altar now I want you to listen
[13:06] real close now I'll close honest just 10
[13:08] minutes at 10 o'cl I have just cut it
[13:11] off and finish it tomorrow they they
[13:13] were not my the ones that the Lord
[13:15] showed me the bride she was not under
[13:18] the martyr's BL no the sacrifice altar
[13:21] of the martyrs but had received white
[13:24] robes by
[13:27] accepting the part Grace of the Living
[13:31] Word Christ had given them a white
[13:35] Rob I do not
[13:39] think by the opening or I do think
[13:43] rather by the opening of this fifth
[13:46] seal as I believe that it's open
[13:49] to I've did it with good
[13:53] conscience with clear Revelation before
[13:56] God not trying to just make it think
[13:59] because I always was against the
[14:00] organization never would belong to him
[14:03] but it's open to me
[14:06] now and I do think another thing by the
[14:10] opening of this fifth seal in this
[14:16] day straightens up a Doctrine right here
[14:20] that I might speak
[14:21] of of Soul
[14:23] sleeping I realize that there's people
[14:26] in here that does believe that see in a
[14:29] soul sleeping I think this disproves
[14:33] that they're not sleeping they are alive
[14:37] their bodies are
[14:39] sleeping but the soul not in the grave
[14:41] they're in the presence of God under the
[14:44] alt here is where I differ with a
[14:47] precious brother a teacher and I know I
[14:49] know I see some of these people sitting
[14:51] here that I realize that this is a great
[14:55] teacher he's a doctor in a doctor of
[14:57] divinity uh p h lld d and he's a he's a
[15:02] real good man too I think he's gone on
[15:06] at this time but he was a good man and a
[15:08] good
[15:09] writer and it's uh brother Ur Smith the
[15:14] author of Daniel of Revelations now to
[15:17] you people who are a follower of his
[15:19] teachings see I I don't I'm not just
[15:23] don't want to say this arrogantly but I
[15:26] just see but brother Smith and trying to
[15:30] support see and trying to
[15:35] support Soul
[15:38] sleeping there he mentions that the soul
[15:43] sleep and there is no alar of sacrifice
[15:46] in
[15:48] heaven that the only alar spoke of is he
[15:52] he beli is in heaven is the altar of
[15:56] incense but to you dear people people
[15:59] and not differ than my brother I
[16:02] probably hope to meet him on the other
[16:03] side see not differ with that great
[16:05] teacher but just to show you how this
[16:08] disproves that see it disproves it the
[16:12] opening of this seal in this last day it
[16:15] just takes SCE they didn't come out of
[16:16] the
[16:17] way they're alive they're not dead
[16:22] notice notice this
[16:24] now now if there's no alar of sa
[16:29] sacrifice in heaven where is the
[16:32] sacrifice for sin
[16:36] laying the
[16:40] lamb there has to be a place where that
[16:43] slaying lamb bloody is laying there or
[16:46] the blood is now the incense was the
[16:50] odors odor stuff that they burn which
[16:53] the Bible said was the prayers of the
[16:55] Saints if there isn't No sacrifice on
[16:59] the altar then the prayers cannot be
[17:02] received it's only by the blood on the
[17:04] sacrificial altar that lets the prayers
[17:07] go through to
[17:08] God brother Smith was wrong not
[17:11] disagreeing with I think I made myself
[17:13] clear with brotherly love and respects
[17:15] for his great work see but he was wrong
[17:18] the fifth seal has opened
[17:20] now many other things if you call it I'm
[17:24] waiting for my question to see all right
[17:27] now where was the the slain wounded
[17:31] bleeding bloody lamb for atonement for
[17:35] these odorous
[17:38] prayers notice the Bible says if this
[17:42] Earthly Tabernacle of our dwelling be
[17:45] dissolv we have one already waiting
[17:49] that's where I seen those Saints see
[17:52] watch want a baby excuse me again
[17:55] sisters for this plain talk before young
[17:59] women but look when a mother is has
[18:04] conceived and that little bunch of
[18:06] muscles is twisting and jumping you
[18:09] understand it is a natural body and just
[18:13] as nature is performing the Natural Body
[18:18] did you ever notice your wife before the
[18:20] little ones is born she always right her
[18:23] long last becomes real kind sweet if she
[18:27] hasn't been all her life will be there
[18:30] you ever notice how saintly or kind of a
[18:33] feeling you notice a mother and you see
[18:35] some sinner out there make fun of a
[18:37] mother that's a pregnated woman I think
[18:39] that's ridiculous That's Life coming to
[18:42] the world but did you notice around that
[18:45] mother seems to be a sweet feeling what
[18:47] is it it's a little spiritual body
[18:51] spiritual life waiting to come into that
[18:54] little body as soon as it's born now
[18:56] it's only begotten
[18:59] but when it's born it's born the
[19:03] spiritual body unites with the Natural
[19:05] Body and then the Bible teaches that we
[19:08] are now begotten of
[19:11] God we're begotten of the holy spirit
[19:14] that in US is Christ a Son of God being
[19:18] formed in it and when this Earthly body
[19:22] be dissolve this spiritual body comes
[19:24] from the bowels of the earth there is
[19:27] a there body waiting to receive it if
[19:31] this Earthly Tabernacle is dropped there
[19:34] is another body to receive
[19:38] it this Mortal body puts on
[19:41] immortality this testial puts on
[19:44] Celestial this see what I mean there is
[19:47] a natural body that's sinful but in its
[19:52] making just like it is another
[19:55] body that we go to and I am so grateful
[20:00] to God that I can say as your pastor and
[20:04] brother I've seen those people so help
[20:08] me in that body and handle them with my
[20:10] hands that's right notice watch look at
[20:15] Moses
[20:18] Elijah after Moses had died and Elijah
[20:22] been taken into heaven he stood here on
[20:25] Mount Transfiguration with his senses of
[20:29] speech
[20:30] hearing understanding and talk to Jesus
[20:34] before the
[20:36] crucifixion what kind of body he had
[20:39] look at Samuel after being
[20:42] dead for about two years was called back
[20:47] into the the cave that night by the
[20:50] witch of indor and talked to
[20:55] Saul with
[20:56] language hear SA all spoke back and for
[21:01] new things that was going to happen
[21:03] still his Spirit hadn't changed he was a
[21:06] prophet when Elijah's Spirit comes upon
[21:08] the manle will driving just like Elijah
[21:11] he'll go to the Wilderness he'll love
[21:13] the Wilderness he'll be a hater of
[21:15] immoral women he'll be against
[21:17] organization he'll pull no punches for
[21:20] nobody and that's just that's that'll be
[21:22] his Spirit it was each time to
[21:24] come Moses will be the same person
[21:29] now and we find out in Revelations uh
[21:32] 228 the same thing now are to settle it
[21:37] for those who those
[21:40] Souls I watches under the altar of the
[21:45] breaking of this seal that had been
[21:48] slain in the time between the death of
[21:52] Christ and the going up of the church
[21:55] the Ian group and all that and true Jews

[22:03] scripture they could

[22:14] senses not sleeping in the
[22:17] grave unconscious they were very much
[22:21] awake and could talk speak hear anything

[1:07:47] the
[1:07:49] Lord and it came to pass when the Lord
[1:07:52] would take up Elijah into Heaven by
[1:07:55] Whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[1:07:58] from gilgal and Elijah said unto Elisha
[1:08:02] Terry here I pray thee for the Lord had
[1:08:06] sent me to bethl and Elisha said unto
[1:08:10] him as the Lord liveth and as thy soul
[1:08:14] liveth I will not leave thee so they
[1:08:18] went down to bethl we'll take one more
[1:08:20] scripture found in First Kings chapter
[1:08:25] 19
[1:08:35] team in verse number
[1:08:39] 19 maybe we'll start a little bit higher
[1:08:41] than
[1:08:44] that the Lord verse 15 and the Lord said
[1:08:47] unto him go return thy way to the
[1:08:50] Wilderness of damasca Damascus and when
[1:08:53] thou comest anoint Hazel to be king over
[1:08:56] Syria and juu the son of nimi shall thou
[1:09:00] anoint to be king over Israel and Elisha
[1:09:04] the son of shapat of Abel molah shalt
[1:09:08] thou anoint to be prophet in thy room
[1:09:12] and it shall come to pass that him that
[1:09:14] escaped the sword of hesel so J Who slay
[1:09:18] him that J Who Shall Elijah
[1:09:24] slay and him that escape it from The
[1:09:26] Sword of Jus shall Elisha say slay yet I
[1:09:31] have left me 7,000 in Israel all the
[1:09:34] knees which have not bowed unto ba every
[1:09:38] mouth which hath not kissed him so he
[1:09:42] departed and found Elisha the son of
[1:09:45] shaat who was plowing with 12 Yol of
[1:09:47] oxen before him and he with the 12th
[1:09:51] Elijah passed by him cast his mantle
[1:09:54] upon him
[1:09:55] and he left the oxen ran after Elijah
[1:09:59] and said let me I pray thee kiss my
[1:10:02] father and my mother then I will follow
[1:10:05] thee and he said unto him go back again
[1:10:09] for what have I done to thee and he
[1:10:13] returned back from him took a Yol of
[1:10:15] oxen slew them boiled the flesh with the
[1:10:20] instruments and The Oxen and gave unto
[1:10:23] the people they did eat the then he
[1:10:25] arose and went after Elijah and
[1:10:29] ministered unto him and we're just going
[1:10:32] to take some time this morning and speak
[1:10:36] on Elijah and
[1:10:38] Elisha and how Elisha cried for this
[1:10:42] double portion Elijah and Elisha let's
[1:10:46] pray one more time lord Jesus I pray
[1:10:49] you'll help us this morning to deliver
[1:10:51] your word in Jesus name we pray amen God
[1:10:56] bless you you may be
[1:10:58] seated you know we see this attitude of
[1:11:01] Elijah as it pertains to
[1:11:03] Elisha we see
[1:11:06] him um it looks like he's not real
[1:11:09] thrilled about Elisha following him you
[1:11:13] know the Lord tells Elijah the prophet
[1:11:17] tremendous prophet of God he was
[1:11:19] anointed and the Lord tells
[1:11:22] Elijah uh you're going to leave your
[1:11:24] ministry is over over now go anoint juu
[1:11:27] go anoint Hazel and then go anoint
[1:11:31] Elisha which will be the one that will
[1:11:34] take your place and you know you don't
[1:11:37] see this all the time in the scripture
[1:11:40] where you can see a great tremendous
[1:11:43] Ministry and then the answer to who is
[1:11:48] next in charge is answered while they're
[1:11:52] alive we see it with Moses and Joshua
[1:11:56] and we see it here in this scripture
[1:11:57] here but we've seen it here even those
[1:12:00] of us that have been around a little bit
[1:12:02] you'll see a Ministry like a a a great
[1:12:05] ministry that will flourish a pastor
[1:12:08] will start a work it will grow it will
[1:12:11] get bigger and it'll grow and then the
[1:12:13] question always comes up who's second in
[1:12:17] charge who's going to take his place
[1:12:19] afterwards and it always causes a little
[1:12:22] rub or a little problem and I seen it
[1:12:26] and I've heard it said because our city
[1:12:28] dealt with that here five since 2015 we
[1:12:31] had some great Mighty Men of God that
[1:12:34] have crossed over and it left the city a
[1:12:37] little bewildered how many know what I'm
[1:12:39] talking about sure absolutely and this
[1:12:42] is this is normal and I've heard it and
[1:12:45] I've traveled and I've heard people say
[1:12:47] well those oldtime Brothers they didn't
[1:12:49] do it right they should have named who
[1:12:52] was going to be second in charge they
[1:12:54] should have put that in place um before
[1:12:58] they left they should have put those
[1:13:00] things in order before uh they left and
[1:13:05] I and I um and I I thought about that
[1:13:09] brother Chuck and I try to inter
[1:13:11] internalize that thought but how easy is
[1:13:18] that tell me how easy that
[1:13:21] is to let someone to take your place say
[1:13:25] take a husband and wife that've been
[1:13:27] married 40 years that one of those
[1:13:29] spouses die and then you just go replace
[1:13:32] it with another just plug in and
[1:13:35] continue on does it work that way no Sor
[1:13:38] don't work that way there's Dynamics
[1:13:41] there's a lot that goes to it you're
[1:13:43] dealing with people feelings memories
[1:13:47] and so if God's hand is in over it it's
[1:13:50] going to be
[1:13:51] tumultuous and even when and I told this
[1:13:54] to a couple of the brothers and even
[1:13:58] when it has been noted who's in charge
[1:14:02] even when it has been established he's
[1:14:05] going to be the next in charge it still
[1:14:07] don't work out
[1:14:09] right so so who who has the answer of
[1:14:12] who who's next in line well God has that
[1:14:16] answer and it's amazing how God does it
[1:14:19] he picks and he chooses who he
[1:14:23] wants it's his choosing it's not a
[1:14:26] political vote it's not getting the
[1:14:29] Summons of everybody it's God who
[1:14:31] chooses that and when God chooses it
[1:14:34] it's always the right choice can I get a
[1:14:36] witness we see this this um Dynamic here
[1:14:41] with Elijah and
[1:14:43] Elisha so as we as we as we uh look at
[1:14:47] the Old Testament second uh Kings
[1:14:49] chapter 2 that we read here Elijah is
[1:14:53] now telling Elisha
[1:14:56] um to stay here we're we're in betho or
[1:14:59] we're in gilgal stay here I got to go
[1:15:02] somewhere else and Elisha says with with
[1:15:07] wisdom with Revelation he says as my
[1:15:10] soul
[1:15:11] lives I will not leave you wherever you
[1:15:15] go I'm
[1:15:17] going okay
[1:15:19] fine he goes to bethl and the Lord
[1:15:24] through Elijah tells Elisha stay here
[1:15:27] I've got to go to another place and
[1:15:29] Elisha says again as the Lord lives I
[1:15:33] will not leave you I'm gonna stay with
[1:15:36] you there's something that affected
[1:15:39] Elisha's life to where he was going to
[1:15:42] stay with this Prophet no matter what
[1:15:47] and even the other prophets in the city
[1:15:50] they came and they they have their two
[1:15:52] cents as everybody does they have their
[1:15:54] opinion as everybody does and they tell
[1:15:56] Elisha hey you know what your leader is
[1:15:58] leaving today you know he's getting
[1:16:01] old and what y'all gonna do over there
[1:16:04] when when Elijah has to go what y'all
[1:16:07] gonna you know he has to leave say I
[1:16:09] know it hold your peace can I give you
[1:16:13] modern turns on
[1:16:15] that AR you mind your own
[1:16:18] business I see what you see I feel what
[1:16:22] you feel I don't need you to tell me
[1:16:24] what we all see are you praying for me
[1:16:29] are you praying for the situation
[1:16:32] anybody can stand out and say oh you
[1:16:34] know I knew that was coming I knew it's
[1:16:36] gonna happen so what you do about
[1:16:40] it very tender timing so Elisha says
[1:16:43] hold your peace I know that so prophets
[1:16:46] on one end and telling them this
[1:16:48] pressure from Elijah to stay here but he
[1:16:51] was committed to staying with Elijah now
[1:16:56] where does this commitment come from why
[1:16:59] is he why is he so
[1:17:02] infatuated with this other man Elisha is
[1:17:07] so caught up with
[1:17:10] Elijah that when Elisha comes to his
[1:17:13] house for the very first time he takes
[1:17:16] his mantle and he just touches him with
[1:17:20] his mantle and then
[1:17:23] Elisha drops everything that he's
[1:17:26] doing and he runs after Elijah and says
[1:17:30] give me a little time I'm with the
[1:17:32] ministry I see what's going on this is
[1:17:35] what I'm supposed to be doing can I come
[1:17:37] with you give me a little timing what
[1:17:38] did Elijah say oh yeah brother here come
[1:17:41] here let me make it easy for you come
[1:17:43] here brother yeah we want you to come
[1:17:45] please don't be offended he's like what
[1:17:47] I got to do with you go on back go sit
[1:17:51] down don't come out don't follow me go
[1:17:55] go this is the this is the attitude of
[1:17:59] Elijah to Elisha and so what does Elisha
[1:18:02] do does he
[1:18:04] listen does he listen to Elijah no he
[1:18:08] does not listen to him because he caught
[1:18:10] a revelation of what was taking place
[1:18:13] and what was taking place is something
[1:18:16] happened in Elisha's life that had never
[1:18:19] happened before he came in contact with
[1:18:23] his ministry
[1:18:25] his life's Ministry it'll answer all the
[1:18:30] questions for him and so he goes back he
[1:18:33] takes the 12 yolks of oxen that he was
[1:18:36] plowing
[1:18:38] with and he takes the instruments from
[1:18:42] the oxin and he kills all the
[1:18:45] oxen boils their flesh that's a lot of
[1:18:48] meat feeds all the people kisses Mom and
[1:18:53] Dad goodbye and he leaves so what is
[1:18:56] this telling us what a commitment on
[1:18:59] Elisha's part what is he doing what is
[1:19:02] he showing he's showing that he's not
[1:19:05] coming back to this career path that he
[1:19:08] was once in the way that he used to work
[1:19:12] and the the ministry that he used to
[1:19:15] operate on under he's now making a major
[1:19:18] change in his life and he's not selling
[1:19:21] the animals he's killing them
[1:19:25] and I don't know you know any kind of
[1:19:27] person that has an animal that you work
[1:19:30] with you know oxes we used to or cows
[1:19:33] are used to work with horses will'll
[1:19:35] work with dogs we work with they're
[1:19:38] guard dogs they dogs we used to hunt
[1:19:40] it's a working relationship but with
[1:19:42] that working relationship there comes a
[1:19:45] little friendship there with that animal
[1:19:48] how many know what I'm talking about the
[1:19:50] animals have a spirit and they like to
[1:19:52] see you they know where their food is
[1:19:54] coming from
[1:19:56] they know where the fellowship where
[1:19:57] something that's lovely and there's a
[1:19:59] relationship there for for Elisha to go
[1:20:02] and kill these 12 oxin is saying a lot
[1:20:06] now most more times than not if you have
[1:20:09] animals that you work with that this is
[1:20:12] his livelihood you have to know how to
[1:20:15] work with those animals so you can get
[1:20:18] your job done and so this relationship
[1:20:21] was was established there and you know
[1:20:24] for most human beings most of us give
[1:20:27] our animal animals names don't
[1:20:30] we we have a rabbit at home I say we we
[1:20:35] have a rabbit at
[1:20:37] home and I don't know what the name of
[1:20:40] this rabbit is to today we've called I
[1:20:42] think we had it for a year maybe two
[1:20:44] years we've called it all kind of names
[1:20:47] will Joo came over little will Joe we
[1:20:49] said he asked what the name was he says
[1:20:51] we don't have a name what should we name
[1:20:52] he says name it Garcia
[1:20:56] and I said okay fine well sometimes he's
[1:20:58] Garcia or he or it or whatever it is I
[1:21:01] really don't
[1:21:03] know but you know there's a relationship
[1:21:06] that you develop with whatever animal it
[1:21:08] is and this this no doubt has to be a
[1:21:13] working relationship that Elisha has
[1:21:16] with these 12 yolks of oxis so for him
[1:21:19] to go and slay them is saying a lot
[1:21:24] there's something took place in the
[1:21:26] touching of a piece of cloth a mantle
[1:21:31] from one man to another man he just
[1:21:34] touched him with it and from there he
[1:21:38] followed Elijah as a servant now this
[1:21:43] type can go so far and there's many many
[1:21:46] types throughout the scriptures and
[1:21:47] through the message that we can bring to
[1:21:49] you this morning and one of the great
[1:21:52] types that brother brandham gives and
[1:21:54] the scripture gives us is that Elijah is
[1:21:58] a type of Christ and and Elisha is a
[1:22:04] type of the
[1:22:05] church so as Elijah is getting ready to
[1:22:09] leave here from the earth he now has
[1:22:15] this younger Junior Ministry following
[1:22:20] him and in following him he has
[1:22:23] committed himself self to stay with
[1:22:26] Elijah so take your Bibles again 2 Kings
[1:22:29] chapter 2
[1:22:32] quickly in
[1:22:35] verse number six and Elijah said unto
[1:22:38] him Terry I pray thee here for the Lord
[1:22:41] had sent me to Jordan and he said as the
[1:22:44] Lord liveth and thy soul liveth I will
[1:22:47] not leave thee and they too went on so
[1:22:52] first it was a g
[1:22:55] second it was bethl and now they're here
[1:22:58] at Jericho each time it looks like it
[1:23:02] appears like Elijah is discouraging
[1:23:05] Elisha from going forward but he
[1:23:09] continues on and the 50 men of the sons
[1:23:11] of the prophets went stood to view a far
[1:23:14] off and they too stood by Jordan and
[1:23:17] Elijah took his mantle wrapped it
[1:23:19] together and smokee the waters and they
[1:23:21] were divided hither and thither so that
[1:23:24] they went over on dry ground and it came
[1:23:27] to pass when they were gone over that
[1:23:30] Elijah said unto
[1:23:32] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[1:23:37] before I be taken away from thee and
[1:23:40] Elisha said I pray thee let a double
[1:23:43] portion of thy Spirit be upon me what a
[1:23:50] request he's asking this man to let a
[1:23:54] double portion of your spirit to come
[1:23:59] upon me and he said thou has as a hard
[1:24:03] thing verse 10 nevertheless if thou see
[1:24:06] me when I am taken from thee it shall be
[1:24:09] so unto thee but if not it shall not be
[1:24:11] so and it came to pass as they still
[1:24:14] went on and talk that behold there
[1:24:16] appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of
[1:24:19] fire and parted them both aund and
[1:24:23] Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:24:26] heaven so finally after these three
[1:24:29] stages we see that the real reason the
[1:24:33] real purpose the real desire that Elisha
[1:24:36] had was granted to him as the question
[1:24:40] was asked what can I give to you what
[1:24:43] have I to do with you Elisha what can I
[1:24:47] what can I give to you this was after
[1:24:49] gilgal this is after bethl this is after
[1:24:54] the Jordan where Elijah takes the mantle
[1:24:57] he smites the Jordan River and it Parts
[1:25:02] supernaturally they two go across the
[1:25:05] Jordan River and then Elijah finally
[1:25:10] after all of the relationship that they
[1:25:12] had with each other Ministry Elder
[1:25:16] minister to younger Minister he asked
[1:25:20] the question and it's a beautiful
[1:25:23] question it's It's a
[1:25:25] Wonderful opportunity a question you
[1:25:28] won't get asked too many times probably
[1:25:31] in your life this is a question that's
[1:25:34] going to change everything for you
[1:25:36] Elisha he says what can I do for you
[1:25:39] before I
[1:25:41] go do you want this mantle do you want
[1:25:43] my the books that I used to read do you
[1:25:46] want my special notes do you want do you
[1:25:49] have anything you want from me you want
[1:25:52] me to leave you my property do you want
[1:25:55] my wealth do you want all the things
[1:25:57] that my Ministry has accumulated and
[1:26:00] Elisha looks at him he Saidi want a
[1:26:02] double
[1:26:04] portion of your
[1:26:06] spirit
[1:26:08] wow where did that come
[1:26:10] from where did a question like that come
[1:26:15] from how could this man contrive or
[1:26:19] conceive to ask such a
[1:26:22] question m beautiful opportunity and
[1:26:26] Elijah tells him you've asked a hard
[1:26:29] thing difficult thing what you just
[1:26:30] asked for probably nobody's ever asked
[1:26:33] me that before but you've asked it and
[1:26:37] and and God's going to give it to you if
[1:26:40] you see me when I go if you see keep
[1:26:44] your eyes on me when I
[1:26:46] go you're gonna have what you ask for oh
[1:26:49] my now now he finally confirms that me
[1:26:53] follow him is
[1:26:55] correct keep my eyes on you yes keep
[1:26:58] your eyes on me and you see me when I
[1:27:02] go boy that's
[1:27:05] uncomfortable because I'm not taking my
[1:27:07] eyes off of you you want to get
[1:27:09] something to eat I'm right with you you
[1:27:12] need to take a little break I'm right in
[1:27:13] the break room with you whatever you're
[1:27:16] about to do I'm going to keep my eyes on
[1:27:18] you and the Bible says and it came to
[1:27:20] pass no set time no set amount of
[1:27:24] moments or minutes just keep your eyes
[1:27:27] on me and when I go you'll get a double
[1:27:30] portion of my
[1:27:31] spirit now this Chariots of Fire horses
[1:27:38] come on fire and they part the two so
[1:27:42] they're both
[1:27:43] separated and the Chariots capture
[1:27:47] Elijah and take him into the wellward
[1:27:49] and Elisha sees him and when Elisha sees
[1:27:52] him he cries out these famous words what
[1:27:56] did he say anybody know what he said
[1:27:59] what' he
[1:28:01] say my
[1:28:03] father my father thank you sis Elisha
[1:28:06] saw it and he cried my father my father
[1:28:10] The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[1:28:14] thereof and he saw him no more he took a
[1:28:18] hold of his own clothes rent them in two
[1:28:21] pieces he took up also the m mantle of
[1:28:25] Elijah that fell from him he went back
[1:28:28] and stood by the bank of Jordan and he
[1:28:32] took the mantle of Elijah that fell from
[1:28:34] him and he smoke the waters and said
[1:28:38] where is the Lord God not of
[1:28:43] Abraham not of creation the Lord God of
[1:28:48] Elijah where is the god of
[1:28:51] Elijah I know who Elijah is where is his
[1:28:55] God at I can read about all kind of
[1:28:58] other gods and all kind of other
[1:29:00] anointed people but I know God was with
[1:29:03] Elijah where is the god of Elijah you
[1:29:07] know what church every believer should
[1:29:10] ask that question every message believer
[1:29:12] should ask that question you should ask
[1:29:14] that question in your own life
[1:29:18] and where the Lord God of Elijah when he
[1:29:20] had smitten in the waters they parted
[1:29:23] hither and thither and Elisha went
[1:29:27] over now what does it mean when he says
[1:29:30] my father my father the Chariots of
[1:29:34] Israel and the horsemen thereof how many
[1:29:36] knows what that
[1:29:39] means you want to
[1:29:43] try I won't embarrass you too
[1:29:47] bad well let's let the prophet I don't
[1:29:49] know what it means either all right but
[1:29:51] let's let the prophet tell us what it
[1:29:53] means is that
[1:29:55] okay here what the prophet of God says
[1:29:58] here in the
[1:30:02] message the eror of God's
[1:30:05] Deliverance
[1:30:07] 1956 August the 1 so then when he went
[1:30:11] down there and he seen him he respected
[1:30:14] him he said my father my father the
[1:30:17] Chariots of Israel and the horse in
[1:30:20] other words my
[1:30:22] father my my father you're worth more
[1:30:27] than all the Chariots of Israel and all
[1:30:31] the horsemen thereof and how true that
[1:30:35] is I say tonight though Elijah was
[1:30:38] considered a Holy Roller a fanatic by
[1:30:40] the modern world yet his presence in
[1:30:43] that nation was worth more than all the
[1:30:48] horses and chariots that they had and
[1:30:51] I'll say tonight that a good old fashion
[1:30:54] Holy Ghost tent meeting is more to
[1:30:57] protect us than all the atomic bombs
[1:31:01] that we can create in a million
[1:31:04] years so what is he what's the value of
[1:31:07] Elijah to the nation what's the value
[1:31:10] now everybody couldn't see it but the
[1:31:13] value to that nation was
[1:31:16] tremendous you're more valuable than the
[1:31:19] UN more valuable than the Pentagon more
[1:31:23] more valuable than any defense system
[1:31:27] alarm system H uh
[1:31:30] self-protection you are more valuable
[1:31:34] than all the Chariots and the horsemen
[1:31:37] thereof this is what Elisha was saying
[1:31:40] to
[1:31:41] Elijah how many can say that today about
[1:31:44] the word of the Lord that you're under
[1:31:46] today that is more valuable don't let
[1:31:50] the devil fool you that is the most
[1:31:53] valuable thing you got is a revelation
[1:31:56] of God's word for this day that is the V
[1:32:00] that is the protection that is the
[1:32:03] keeping power that is the ministry that
[1:32:06] is the strength that's why we're here
[1:32:09] today because of that great power and
[1:32:13] this is what Elisha saw so when Elisha
[1:32:16] sees this in Elijah he asked the correct
[1:32:19] question and the correct the correct
[1:32:23] request T was to get a double portion of
[1:32:28] this Spirit now there's a a number of
[1:32:32] things that has to be really worked out
[1:32:36] with in this these stages here that we
[1:32:39] see in second Kings chapter 2 gilgal the
[1:32:44] first place that Elisha and Elijah come
[1:32:46] to was what brother brandom calls the
[1:32:49] Christian
[1:32:51] confession and that was the first stage
[1:32:53] and we all have to come there Christian
[1:32:58] confession but we don't stay just there
[1:33:02] we got to move on you'll see many people
[1:33:05] even in our churches in our assemblies
[1:33:08] they'll start and more people start but
[1:33:12] they don't continue on five years down
[1:33:15] the road they're stagnant 10 years down
[1:33:18] the road they're still tripping on the
[1:33:20] same things they were tripping on before
[1:33:23] they're still caught up in the same
[1:33:25] immature things that they were before
[1:33:28] but I want to go from gilgal to bethl
[1:33:31] don't you and bethl what was that bethl
[1:33:34] bethl means the house of God so he went
[1:33:38] from Christian confession to the house
[1:33:42] of God which you're in the right place
[1:33:44] now but we don't just stay in the house
[1:33:47] of God we got to go to Jericho what was
[1:33:50] Jericho um Jericho or to the Jordan was
[1:33:55] death coming up to the Jordan going to
[1:33:59] this place where you would now you would
[1:34:03] now leave from the past and move forward
[1:34:08] to your future you're dying out to who
[1:34:13] to
[1:34:14] yourself dying out to your self willll
[1:34:18] you know those prophets watching from
[1:34:20] afar can see that double portion come on
[1:34:24] Elisha and when they saw it come upon
[1:34:26] them they went and says oh my you really
[1:34:29] got the spirit and they begin to uh
[1:34:32] serve him and they bow down to him it
[1:34:35] says and many people no doubt want this
[1:34:39] double portion but you got to cross over
[1:34:43] uh Jordan you got to cross over with
[1:34:47] death to yourself before the question is
[1:34:51] even asked what can I do for you today
[1:34:54] now how many wants a double portion of
[1:34:56] the Holy Spirit of course we do but how
[1:34:59] many want to self regulate and bring
[1:35:03] themselves to an old cross and die to
[1:35:06] their
[1:35:08] self-will that's always the rub is dying
[1:35:11] to your
[1:35:13] self-will dying from the things of the
[1:35:17] world to the things that God has for you
[1:35:20] it's a greater price it's a greater
[1:35:24] sacrifice and so once he goes through
[1:35:26] these stages the opportunity is given to
[1:35:29] him to ask now now in asking he asked a
[1:35:35] very I mean it was an
[1:35:37] enormous request that he asked for it
[1:35:40] was a great thing and the prophet of God
[1:35:43] tells us that God actually wants us to
[1:35:46] ask for big things he wants us to ask
[1:35:51] for the maximum
[1:35:54] it's actually unlimited of what you can
[1:35:57] ask
[1:35:58] for unlimited Faith unlimited Love
[1:36:02] Unlimited Power unlimited strength you
[1:36:07] can ask him and he's got it in abundance
[1:36:10] for
[1:36:11] you but many of us don't ask maybe we're
[1:36:15] embarrassed to ask maybe we'll ask but
[1:36:18] we don't really believe that we'll
[1:36:19] receive it so let's go into the message
[1:36:21] just for a moment here the prophet of
[1:36:23] God say says this
[1:36:24] here in the message Elijah and
[1:36:34] Elisha how beautiful Christ did the same
[1:36:37] before he left as God's witness he made
[1:36:40] a preparation of a church and ordained
[1:36:43] that there would be Witnesses all the
[1:36:44] way through the church age Plum to the
[1:36:47] end of the age and I think after he
[1:36:49] throwed a garment on him when he was
[1:36:51] plowing Elijah and he killed the ox he
[1:36:55] took the Yoke and so forth and made a
[1:36:57] feast as they roasted the meat told his
[1:37:00] father and mother goodbye and followed
[1:37:02] Elijah now notice how Christians as soon
[1:37:06] as they become anointed how they're
[1:37:09] tempted sometimes but Elisha was a
[1:37:12] prophet and Elijah says you ter here the
[1:37:15] Lord has called me to gilar so he said
[1:37:18] as the Lord liveth and your soul liveth
[1:37:20] I will not leave you I like that going
[1:37:23] to stay right with him he started and
[1:37:26] now he's going through we used to sing a
[1:37:29] little song I'll take the way with the
[1:37:32] Lord's despised few drop down to
[1:37:35] paragraph 31 now the third stage is
[1:37:38] coming on but the church still follows
[1:37:40] on Elisha following
[1:37:43] Elijah and when he gets across down to
[1:37:46] the Jordan Jordan is a meaning of
[1:37:49] separation or
[1:37:51] death you've heard many times s when I
[1:37:54] come down to the Chile Jordan Jordan was
[1:37:57] death the Lutheran age followed by and
[1:38:00] so did the Methodist Methodist age but
[1:38:02] we come to another age now the age of
[1:38:06] dying out all your worldly pleasure God
[1:38:10] has got to do something with you in
[1:38:12] order for you can for he could give you
[1:38:15] the Holy Ghost got to die out get dead
[1:38:19] you don't die out you can't you remember
[1:38:22] life can only come out of death a seed
[1:38:26] can only die anything else can only die
[1:38:29] and out of death comes life out of death
[1:38:34] of Christ comes the resurrection of life
[1:38:36] and the only way that you can tonight
[1:38:39] become alive of faith in God is die out
[1:38:41] to yourself and symptoms everything
[1:38:44] around you and become alive die out die
[1:38:48] out to symptoms die out to
[1:38:52] circumstances die out to everything else
[1:38:55] and become alive in Christ let me ask
[1:38:58] you this morning is there something in
[1:39:01] your life that you can die out
[1:39:04] to is there something in your life that
[1:39:08] needs to be dead I mean not put to sleep
[1:39:12] not put on quiet but like put to death
[1:39:16] Lord kill that out of me let me die out
[1:39:21] to every worldly thing
[1:39:23] Lord so that I can move on past Jordan
[1:39:27] and get to asking the things that I
[1:39:30] really really desire in my life amen is
[1:39:34] there something you can die out to
[1:39:37] today now when they got down to the
[1:39:39] Jordan time to cross over he made the
[1:39:41] way then when he crossed over the stage
[1:39:44] of the Holy Ghost Church now I want to
[1:39:46] ask you something so what do you want he
[1:39:49] said that a double portion of your
[1:39:51] spirit come upon me that's the way to
[1:39:54] ask for it don't be scared ask for the
[1:39:59] whole lot Jesus said you have not
[1:40:03] because you believe you have not because
[1:40:07] you believe you ask not you ask not
[1:40:10] because you believe not ask abundantly
[1:40:13] that your joy may be full ask a whole
[1:40:15] lot God just don't make me a little bit
[1:40:19] better make me all the way well don't
[1:40:23] just let me have enough religion to make
[1:40:25] myself miserable kill me out to sin that
[1:40:30] I can live in Christ that's right amen I
[1:40:35] believe that's the Cry of every believer
[1:40:36] here
[1:40:37] today is really dying out to the things
[1:40:41] of the world the prophet of God
[1:40:43] continues in the message inspiration
[1:40:45] 1956 and he says this here notice Elijah
[1:40:49] he knew where he was standing before God
[1:40:52] therefore he was fearless and when he
[1:40:55] got ready to go and he and he was put he
[1:40:58] put his blanket or his robe upon Elisha
[1:41:01] Elisha Cut Loose every Shoreline
[1:41:05] everything he killed the ox and burnt
[1:41:07] the sacrifices separated from everything
[1:41:09] to follow God that's the way we got to
[1:41:12] do it that's the only way there is of
[1:41:16] coming to the Lord Jesus Christ exactly
[1:41:19] right burn up the things behind you cut
[1:41:22] loose
[1:41:23] everything if your Associates or your
[1:41:27] associations rather is taking you into
[1:41:29] pool rooms or taking you into beer
[1:41:31] parties taking you to car parties all
[1:41:34] these other places cut the thing loose
[1:41:37] when you come to Christ get rid of every
[1:41:40] bit of it come to him with the Holy
[1:41:43] hands lifted up saying God be merciful
[1:41:47] to me a sinner no matter how long you
[1:41:49] come to belong to church that doesn't
[1:41:52] have nothing to do with it so many cruel
[1:41:55] things are happening to people today and
[1:41:57] they are going out in that shape because
[1:42:00] they have trusted in the church instead
[1:42:02] of Christ notice the next thing they
[1:42:05] taking place to show that they were a
[1:42:06] type or the antitype Elijah come back
[1:42:09] when he met with Elisha he said he was
[1:42:11] going to another place
[1:42:14] gilgal Elisha said as your as the Lord
[1:42:18] liveth and your soul liveth I'll not
[1:42:20] leave you why he done cut loose
[1:42:23] everything else he only had one thing to
[1:42:26] follow that was God I can't go back to
[1:42:30] my work I done burn it up I kissed my
[1:42:34] father and mother goodbye for the last
[1:42:36] time on this Earth so I'll go with you
[1:42:39] that's the way men do when you cut loose
[1:42:42] every line that's right he said I'll go
[1:42:46] up to the school of the prophets so
[1:42:48] brother Ram continues on there very
[1:42:51] nicely paragraph number 34 in that same
[1:42:54] message and when they Cross Jordan which
[1:42:57] means Jordan always been the death sign
[1:43:01] and when they crossed Jordan Elijah
[1:43:03] turned around and said what would you
[1:43:05] that I would do unto you that a double
[1:43:08] portion of your spirit be sent upon me
[1:43:11] said you've asked a great thing God
[1:43:13] wants us to ask for big
[1:43:17] things my God he don't run out of
[1:43:19] blessings up there you can't ask for two
[1:43:23] to much could you imagine a little fish
[1:43:25] about that long out in the middle of the
[1:43:27] ocean saying I better not drink much of
[1:43:30] this water because it might go dry well
[1:43:33] that's just as
[1:43:35] unreasonable as it would be or more so
[1:43:39] reasonable than to be to think that
[1:43:41] God's blessings would ever be exhausted
[1:43:45] to a Believer all Heaven belongs to you
[1:43:50] how many you know that God wants you to
[1:43:51] ask for big things
[1:43:53] what's
[1:43:55] big that you can ask for
[1:43:58] today what is that what does that look
[1:44:01] like to you you know it's got to move
[1:44:05] past a looking at what other people are
[1:44:07] asking for this goes down into your own
[1:44:10] heart and your own life really the
[1:44:13] sincerity of your life and your heart
[1:44:17] really comes down to what you really
[1:44:19] want from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:23] this is another level Saints I believe
[1:44:25] with all my heart this is more than just
[1:44:27] coming to church this is more than just
[1:44:30] being like what the other churches and
[1:44:32] other Christians are being like this is
[1:44:35] not me following other pastors to see
[1:44:37] how they do it this is me getting my
[1:44:40] eyes off of other pastors churches and
[1:44:43] people and put my eyes on the anointing
[1:44:48] where is the anointing at it was on
[1:44:50] Elijah and when uh the requirement was
[1:44:54] if you can see me then you can have what
[1:44:57] you asked for and this is what Jesus
[1:45:00] desires from all of us he wants our
[1:45:04] undivided
[1:45:06] attention you know we get so we get we
[1:45:09] get so bent out of shape when things
[1:45:12] don't happen our way because we're
[1:45:14] looking at other people but when our
[1:45:17] eyes are focused on the master of our
[1:45:21] ship the captain of your life the one
[1:45:25] who's leading you and guiding you when
[1:45:28] you focus in on him then it doesn't
[1:45:30] really matter what others may say or do
[1:45:33] or what comes in and what goes it helps
[1:45:37] you to keep yourself stabilized when
[1:45:39] your eyes are focused on him and what
[1:45:43] does he have for you today something
[1:45:46] greater than you that you ever had
[1:45:48] before I believe that with all my heart
[1:45:52] and as I said the other night I believe
[1:45:55] there's others that believe that too
[1:45:57] here and if they don't believe it then
[1:45:59] guess what I'll do it by
[1:46:02] myself right you'll do it by yourself
[1:46:05] won't you the church doesn't believe a
[1:46:08] portion of the word and this group
[1:46:11] doesn't believe a portion of the word
[1:46:12] but you can see it's in the word then
[1:46:16] you can believe it's unlimited to you
[1:46:20] that's the uniqueness of God's relation
[1:46:22] relationship to the believer so he it's
[1:46:25] not like he blesses me and then after He
[1:46:27] blesses me then he's going to bless you
[1:46:29] too he I get my turn and you get your
[1:46:32] turn I got one scoop and you get a scoop
[1:46:35] it don't work that way you go get your
[1:46:37] own scoop anytime any place how God
[1:46:40] wants to bless you let God bless
[1:46:44] you it's unlimited to the
[1:46:48] believer what does that mean do mean
[1:46:51] there's no limits you mean it's
[1:46:54] unlimited
[1:46:56] candy unlimited scoops of ice
[1:47:00] cream unlimited minutes on my
[1:47:04] phone remember when we got that you
[1:47:07] remember you used have to pay for each

[1:47:12] remember somebody call and I just keep

[1:47:17] keep it in one minute because if it goes
[1:47:18] over two we get charged for two minutes
[1:47:21] so if you're a Savvy you know that one
[1:47:23] call you can get everything said in
[1:47:25] under one minute and just get charged
[1:47:27] one minute it's on a a minute budget
[1:47:31] right but how many knows we don't budget
[1:47:34] like that no more why who's going to get
[1:47:37] a plan today that has limited
[1:47:40] minutes you be like man you need to drop
[1:47:43] that cell phone and come on over here
[1:47:45] it's unlimited I remember the first time

[1:48:58] all you can claim it
[1:49:01] all it's unlimited to the
[1:49:06] believer Jesus said
[1:49:09] so he said the works that I do shall you
[1:49:12] do also even Greater Works not greater
[1:49:18] in the sense no one can do greater than
[1:49:20] raising the dead but it means more more
[1:49:24] more of the same great
[1:49:26] works is that right how many of you have
[1:49:30] ever seen the dead
[1:49:33] raised ever been in the service yeah how
[1:49:36] many youve never seen
[1:49:38] that be honest never seen a dead
[1:49:42] raise did you know you can actually ask
[1:49:44] God to let you see that before you leave
[1:49:46] from
[1:49:48] here the deaf ears come open
[1:49:52] the blinded I
[1:49:55] see you know that's unlimited we can see
[1:49:58] that as a
[1:49:59] Believer huh absolutely Saints
[1:50:04] absolutely so that's this
[1:50:06] Elijah and Elisha God wants you to ask
[1:50:09] for big things great things where I
[1:50:13] think Pentecost fell brother random says
[1:50:15] this where I think Pentecost failed
[1:50:17] paragraph
[1:50:20] 37 Dro down a little bit he said p with
[1:50:23] people so organized they can't move with
[1:50:25] it but God's fire is moving right on
[1:50:29] just the same and he will do it in every
[1:50:32] age and never a church through history
[1:50:36] that ever fa ever revived again you know
[1:50:39] that they are down and we must not draw
[1:50:43] boundary lines we must say we believe
[1:50:46] this and not end it with a period but
[1:50:49] with a comma we believe this this plus
[1:50:55] as much as God will pour into our hearts
[1:50:59] how many of us need to hear that today
[1:51:02] this
[1:51:04] plus this plus whatever God pours into
[1:51:09] our heart that's believing for greater
[1:51:12] things is that
[1:51:13] right you know there's a scripture
[1:51:19] where um you see I got it written down
[1:51:21] here it's in Kings there where after
[1:51:24] Elijah is gone and Elisha is now the
[1:51:28] prophet in instead in Israel and and um
[1:51:32] Judah is now in a a fight with another
[1:51:35] Army and they were trying to find a way
[1:51:38] which way they should go and one of the
[1:51:40] Kings tells the other king Jehoshaphat
[1:51:43] he says you know Elisha poured water on
[1:51:47] the hands of
[1:51:48] Elijah you know what he was saying was
[1:51:51] that there's an assoc iation and the
[1:51:53] prophet brings that out that if he
[1:51:55] poured water on his hands that means he
[1:51:57] was around him and being around him
[1:52:01] there was an association on how he
[1:52:04] operated and did things and there's an
[1:52:07] anointing that comes with staying with
[1:52:10] somebody that is
[1:52:13] Anointed you might not be where you need
[1:52:15] to be but if you can find somebody that
[1:52:17] got their act together that got a prayer
[1:52:20] life maybe that's living right an auntie
[1:52:24] a mama a daddy whoever a brother that's
[1:52:27] handles himself properly you know you
[1:52:30] can align yourself with them and God
[1:52:33] will bless you through that little
[1:52:35] Ministry he does it all the
[1:52:38] time this is
[1:52:40] where Elisha picked up many of these
[1:52:44] blessings from
[1:52:45] Elijah so he moves forward he ask for
[1:52:50] this double portion we ask big things
[1:52:54] God wants us to ask for big things we
[1:52:57] believe this
[1:52:59] plus now I'm going to get into just a
[1:53:02] little area here on sincerity just for a
[1:53:06] moment and it's hard to question
[1:53:09] Elisha's sincerity when he put all those
[1:53:13] animals to death he slew them all and
[1:53:18] these were workers with him these were
[1:53:21] his animals that he owned and his
[1:53:24] character to to row a straight Row the
[1:53:28] prophet of God brother brandham tells us
[1:53:30] that Elijah can see that Elisha knew how
[1:53:35] to row a straight row and keep those 12
[1:53:38] oxen in line it was a character so it's
[1:53:41] like your natural calling always somehow
[1:53:45] aligns with your spiritual calling they
[1:53:49] should and this is why we just don't
[1:53:51] chase after after the money or the
[1:53:54] position or the power we follow the
[1:53:57] leading of the Lord because if God is
[1:54:00] leading you then his leading will lead
[1:54:03] you spiritually and
[1:54:06] physically absolutely you say well I'm
[1:54:10] I'm Heavenly minded I'm reading the word
[1:54:13] but I can go work anywhere no I don't
[1:54:15] think so I think you need to consult God
[1:54:18] before you take a job or even move into
[1:54:22] a neighborhood I believe you should
[1:54:24] consult God when you teaming up with
[1:54:26] another associate on some kind of deal
[1:54:29] or whatever it is I believe you should
[1:54:31] consult God on
[1:54:34] everything because we are
[1:54:37] believers and our life aligns with the
[1:54:40] natural places and the natural things
[1:54:43] that we do we see it all through the
[1:54:45] scriptures and so we don't take that for
[1:54:47] granted do
[1:54:49] we amen
[1:54:51] somebody so this sincerity comes into to
[1:54:55] question and I like the way the prophet
[1:54:57] brings this here I'll take a few places
[1:54:59] here and then we we'll
[1:55:02] close
[1:55:05] now we know that as Elijah and Elisha
[1:55:10] are walking together Elijah appears to
[1:55:14] be discouraging him from moving to the
[1:55:17] next step and what that really is doing
[1:55:20] is actually strengthening
[1:55:23] Elisha and his resilience and being able
[1:55:27] to take to take a punch you can't be a
[1:55:31] real fighter and all you focus is is on
[1:55:34] your offense you gotta focus on your
[1:55:38] defense if you can't take a punch then
[1:55:41] you won't be a very valuable
[1:55:44] fighter if you can't take
[1:55:48] criticism if you can't take everybody
[1:55:51] you know not like in you you have to be
[1:55:54] accepted by everybody well you're
[1:55:57] following the wrong leader because not
[1:55:59] everybody accepted him and he was right
[1:56:02] all the time and you're only right like
[1:56:05] maybe this many times he's right all the
[1:56:08] time and they didn't accept him and so
[1:56:10] we're followers of him right and and and
[1:56:14] you just got to come to grips with it
[1:56:16] who likes rejection none of us who likes
[1:56:19] to be talked about none of us who wants
[1:56:21] you know something bad or spoken on us
[1:56:24] or a lie or somebody misreading us none
[1:56:27] of us want that but it's part of the
[1:56:31] calling and if you can get through that
[1:56:33] and God give you the strength for the
[1:56:36] resilience to get through it you can
[1:56:39] make it through a
[1:56:41] drought all these other trees out here
[1:56:43] need water every day but who's watering
[1:56:47] them trees out in the middle of the
[1:56:48] desert they're just surviving green as
[1:56:51] ever
[1:56:53] 109 115 degrees it's
[1:56:56] like who's watering
[1:56:59] them who's babying
[1:57:02] them that's the kind of believer I want
[1:57:05] to be you ain't got to water me you
[1:57:07] ain't got to even look at me but I want
[1:57:10] to be a survivor in the house of God
[1:57:15] stable with the word of the Lord in my
[1:57:19] life waiting for the choir to sing or
[1:57:24] the organist to come so I can preach
[1:57:27] better or waiting for the crowd to keep
[1:57:30] me encouraging keep me moving on those
[1:57:33] things are good right we like those
[1:57:35] things but
[1:57:36] hey can you preach without
[1:57:41] them can you survive when everybody
[1:57:44] turns against you can you stick with the
[1:57:47] vision when nobody else can see the
[1:57:50] vision or see what you're talking about
[1:57:52] this is Elijah didn't have nobody
[1:57:55] encouraging him his leader is telling
[1:57:57] him to stay here the prophets don't know
[1:57:59] what they talking about and he's just F
[1:58:02] he's following this
[1:58:05] anointing and it led him to the right
[1:58:07] place and that place led him to the
[1:58:10] place where he could ask for a
[1:58:14] great Mighty great thing that would
[1:58:17] shift his whole life his whole Ministry
[1:58:20] so you Brothers you sisters you could do
[1:58:23] the same thing
[1:58:25] today those moments will come and I
[1:58:28] believe they're arriving now all the
[1:58:31] stuff that we seen go on in the name of
[1:58:34] Christianity in the name of this message
[1:58:37] I can't keep up with it I don't know
[1:58:39] what's going up what's coming up next I
[1:58:42] don't know who's going to backslide next
[1:58:45] I don't know don't know but I better
[1:58:48] know who I have believed
[1:58:50] in and better be
[1:58:54] persuaded that he is
[1:58:56] able to keep me from falling he's able
[1:59:02] to keep me from
[1:59:04] falling I'm persuaded of that
[1:59:10] amen praise the Lord
[1:59:13] everybody the prophet of God says this
[1:59:15] in the message Jubilee year let's talk
[1:59:17] about sincerity just for a moment and
[1:59:19] then we'll close this because I think
[1:59:21] this
[1:59:22] all comes down to
[1:59:26] this in Jubilee year paragraph 102
[1:59:29] someone said not long ago said but
[1:59:31] brother brandom this person was real
[1:59:34] sincere what the person was living in
[1:59:37] living in sin oh said I'm sincere I
[1:59:41] believe the Lord Jesus Christ I said if
[1:59:45] you're
[1:59:46] sincere then prove your
[1:59:49] sincere give up the sin you're living
[1:59:53] in oh you see there's so much involved I
[1:59:58] said I thought you were sincere he says
[2:00:01] well I got to do this I got to do the
[2:00:04] most vital thing that you can do is come
[2:00:06] to Jesus Christ no matter what you got
[2:00:08] to do what's any more important than
[2:00:11] than being born
[2:00:13] again so this this opens up in our
[2:00:17] hearts and our mind just this thought
[2:00:19] that your sincerity eventually will be
[2:00:23] an
[2:00:25] action your sincerity will eventually
[2:00:29] come out on the
[2:00:31] outside you're sincere in your heart yes
[2:00:34] you're sincere in your mind yes it
[2:00:36] starts there in your heart in your mind
[2:00:39] but eventually there are actions to
[2:00:43] prove how sincere you
[2:00:46] are and you know there's little details
[2:00:50] like let's just take one real quick
[2:00:52] Nehemiah chapter 7 veres 1 and two we
[2:00:55] know
[2:00:56] Nehemiah he had a great
[2:00:59] work you know an angel didn't come to
[2:01:01] Nehemiah and encourage him I read
[2:01:04] through the whole book a couple times
[2:01:05] and I read through it again yesterday
[2:01:07] and I noticed that the Lord didn't
[2:01:09] really even speak to him and say he he
[2:01:13] says something like it the Lord put it
[2:01:15] in my mind or came into my heart like
[2:01:18] this and he has so many prayers but he
[2:01:20] didn't have an open angel or open
[2:01:23] Revelation come and strike him but
[2:01:25] something just internally started to
[2:01:27] bother him when it came to the
[2:01:29] restoration of the walls of
[2:01:32] Jerusalem he said how's it going in my
[2:01:35] home he's the cup Breer for uh for
[2:01:39] another kingdom and he you know the cup
[2:01:42] Bearer is a very important position you
[2:01:46] know he's to taste the wine before the
[2:01:48] king if there's any poison in it you
[2:01:50] you'll find out you help us find out and
[2:01:54] that's what his position was but he came
[2:01:56] he was sad before the king and the King
[2:01:58] say why are you sad in my presence
[2:01:59] because he's never was sad before said I
[2:02:03] heard about my people my
[2:02:05] homeland and the walls are torn down and
[2:02:08] broken up and the King asked him so what
[2:02:11] what can I do for you he say so I prayed
[2:02:14] to the god of Heaven one little portion
[2:02:17] of scripture right there in the
[2:02:18] beginning so I pray to the god of Heaven
[2:02:22] and then he made his request known and
[2:02:24] the King says go get it now maybe others
[2:02:28] thought about it other people Desiring
[2:02:30] it but it was in his heart it bothered
[2:02:33] him let me ask you what's bothering
[2:02:36] you what's bothering you
[2:02:40] today things in the word of God that's
[2:02:43] not taking place are we in the coming of
[2:02:46] the Lord where are we at today is there
[2:02:49] anything that bothers you like that but
[2:02:52] this this Nehemiah he goes in what
[2:02:55] scripture did I call chapter
[2:03:02] 7 Nehemiah 7 I'll get it here quickly we
[2:03:06] kind of get spoiled though looking at
[2:03:08] the screen huh Nehemiah 7 now it came to
[2:03:12] pass when the wall was built I had set
[2:03:14] up the doors portions in the Levites
[2:03:16] verse two that I gave my brother
[2:03:19] hananiah
[2:03:21] Nani and hananiah the ruler of the
[2:03:26] palace charged over Jerusalem for he was
[2:03:30] a faithful man and feared God above many
[2:03:36] I like what it says in one of the other
[2:03:38] translations says he re revered God more
[2:03:42] than most people do another place says
[2:03:45] God he fear God more than most men do I
[2:03:50] thought that's a nice little detail for
[2:03:52] these two little brothers they're not
[2:03:53] Heroes of Faith they're not people that
[2:03:55] we would talk about but the scriptures
[2:03:58] that when Nehemiah needed what wanted
[2:04:00] this work done because the Jews now were
[2:04:03] selling on the Sabbath day and Nehemiah
[2:04:06] is putting all this thing in order y'all
[2:04:08] not going to be selling no more here so
[2:04:10] he kicks him out and then the next night
[2:04:12] they're waiting at the gate waiting for
[2:04:14] it to sell he says if you don't leave
[2:04:16] I'll put my hands on you that's what he
[2:04:20] said and then so he because these two
[2:04:22] captains these two men because they
[2:04:25] feared God more than most men do where
[2:04:29] are those at in each Church where are
[2:04:31] those at in the city I certainly want to
[2:04:34] see that in the
[2:04:35] mirror a man that fears God more than
[2:04:39] most a woman that fears God that handles
[2:04:43] this word more than most it ain't a lot
[2:04:45] of
[2:04:45] Elisha there's only one and he had his
[2:04:49] eyes on Elijah because the anointing was
[2:04:53] on Elijah and when the time came to ask
[2:04:56] what you want he says I want a double
[2:04:58] portion of your spirit once he found out
[2:05:01] where the anointing was he kept his eyes
[2:05:04] on
[2:05:06] that that's our admonishment to you
[2:05:08] today keep your eyes on where the
[2:05:11] anointing is there a lot of great
[2:05:14] preachers great Ministries Rose and Rise
[2:05:17] many of these Ministries have more tapes
[2:05:19] than the prophet do because of the link
[2:05:21] of their Ministries and you can go
[2:05:24] online and feed on them and you can hear
[2:05:26] them preach great eloquent speakers can
[2:05:30] take the Bible and take what the prophet
[2:05:32] said and bring it together in a more
[2:05:34] coherent way and we can feed on that but
[2:05:36] where is the
[2:05:38] anointing huh where are your eyes
[2:05:41] supposed to be on Elisha on
[2:05:46] Christ the Lord Jesus Christ and that
[2:05:50] representative for for our day God sent
[2:05:54] him in this day so that we can keep our
[2:05:58] eyes on the right things is that right
[2:06:02] you all be encouraged I know sometimes
[2:06:04] we you know a lot of quotes a lot of
[2:06:05] quotes a lot of quotes they read a lot
[2:06:07] of quotes over there you know but what
[2:06:09] else would we be quoting then you want
[2:06:11] to hear more of my quotes you want me to
[2:06:14] make up some quotes and read my own
[2:06:16] quotes or read Reverend so and so's
[2:06:18] quotes or go online and read some Bishop
[2:06:20] so and so's quotes you're all quoting
[2:06:22] somebody we got to quote somebody Jesus
[2:06:26] quoted the prophets we're quoting from
[2:06:28] the Bible we're quoting the prophets and
[2:06:30] this is the anointing for our day amen I
[2:06:33] know we don't have a problem with that
[2:06:34] here but the devil can really you know
[2:06:37] really make us feel like we're missing
[2:06:39] something um when we go down that down
[2:06:43] that path but keep your eyes on that
[2:06:45] anointing it's unlimited now if you are
[2:06:49] sincere I'll close with this I have so
[2:06:51] much more to go but if you are
[2:06:55] sincere can you prove
[2:07:01] it so so sincerity isn't just saying I'm
[2:07:05] sincere I'm more sincere today can you
[2:07:09] prove your sincerity brother bam says
[2:07:14] you're sincere then prove you're sincere
[2:07:17] give up the sin you're living in what I
[2:07:21] like about sincerity the prophet of God
[2:07:23] says here the message says I wonder if
[2:07:26] you could do this in your heart if
[2:07:28] you're sincere if you would make this
[2:07:31] promise to God God I from this time
[2:07:34] standing on my feet seeking the baptism
[2:07:37] of the Holy Ghost I shall constantly
[2:07:39] pray and wait until you fill me with the
[2:07:42] Holy Ghost will you make that promise to
[2:07:44] God by raising your hands I will
[2:07:47] constantly pray constantly until you
[2:07:50] fill me with with the sweetness and the
[2:07:53] goodness of the
[2:07:58] spirit that's that's sincerely that's
[2:08:00] really being sincere are we sincere
[2:08:05] enough I believe brother Bram was
[2:08:07] sincere as Ministry said the angel of
[2:08:09] the Lord came in he says this your first
[2:08:11] pull your second pull if you be sincere
[2:08:14] it'll come to pass that you'll know the
[2:08:16] secrets of the heart so here's one level
[2:08:19] a touch but then if you'll be more
[2:08:21] sinere here's another level for you now
[2:08:25] can we be more sincere and what does
[2:08:28] that look like how does that how do you
[2:08:30] how do you make that happen where does
[2:08:32] that start that starts somewhere down in
[2:08:36] your heart down in your
[2:08:39] soul I like this in the message thy
[2:08:41] house and I'll close with
[2:08:47] this I have two more but I'll read this
[2:08:50] one and then one more after that okay
[2:08:53] and the message thy house paragraph
[2:08:55] number 40 the prophet of God says now
[2:08:58] I've come to Christ when I was about the
[2:09:01] age of one of these boys here I guess I
[2:09:04] was about 20 years old and I served him
[2:09:08] all this time and I'm 52 or will be 53
[2:09:12] my birthday and I can sincerely say that
[2:09:15] I have never asked Christ sincerely for
[2:09:20] anything that is it's now that really
[2:09:24] sincerely asked him anything that was
[2:09:28] for right but would he give it to me or
[2:09:32] told me why he couldn't do it and then
[2:09:35] later on I find out it was a good thing
[2:09:38] I didn't get it see so he said that he's
[2:09:42] never asked really sincerely and I
[2:09:45] shared this with the church in in in
[2:09:47] Phoenix the other day and I'll share it
[2:09:49] here again here I've shared it here
[2:09:51] before
[2:09:51] but I was talking with um brother Billy
[2:09:55] Paul on the fishing trip one time we
[2:09:58] were going driving and I think this was
[2:10:01] the whole purpose of this trip because
[2:10:02] we didn't catch nothing and so we was
[2:10:05] driving long trip me him and one other
[2:10:10] brother and brother and Billy Paul he
[2:10:13] said that he so his dad told him that if
[2:10:16] you really need an answer from the Lord
[2:10:19] he said go to your prayer closet or
[2:10:22] where you go to pray and get quiet
[2:10:25] before the Lord and he says now when you
[2:10:28] do this you have to be very sincere when
[2:10:30] you do
[2:10:31] it and he was sitting in the front seat
[2:10:34] and I was in the back seat and he turned
[2:10:35] around and he looked at me again he says
[2:10:36] you got to be very sincere when you do
[2:10:38] this but he will answer you he says go
[2:10:42] to your prayer closet and then before
[2:10:45] you say anything just think in your mind
[2:10:49] what your request is going to be
[2:10:52] he said begin to think on
[2:10:55] that and meditate on what you're going
[2:10:57] to ask he says then speak it
[2:11:00] out and then don't say another word
[2:11:04] until he speaks to you and he will speak
[2:11:07] to you but you have to be sincere when
[2:11:10] you do it now Saints that's the
[2:11:13] scripture if you ask him he will hear
[2:11:18] your
[2:11:19] prayer but what's your motivation
[2:11:22] and am I really sincere am I really
[2:11:26] willing to give up whatever he would ask
[2:11:30] for one more example is with Samson you
[2:11:34] know when Samson asked for that prayer
[2:11:37] he says Lord give me strength one more
[2:11:39] time he knew what it was going to cost
[2:11:41] him if the Lord did give him that
[2:11:44] strength he knew this was the end of
[2:11:46] your life you can stay alive and be a
[2:11:49] slave and they'll keep laughing and
[2:11:50] tearing in you or I can answer your
[2:11:53] prayer it'll be your last one but I'll
[2:11:56] answer
[2:11:57] you and he had to think about he had to
[2:11:59] count of the ca he lost his eyes his
[2:12:02] ministry had finished prematurely he let
[2:12:06] God he let he let God down he could have
[2:12:10] been used even greater what about the
[2:12:12] great ministry he had he had the
[2:12:15] anointing on his life think of it he he
[2:12:20] he didn't even deserve irid he was
[2:12:21] living wrong but he would just shake
[2:12:23] himself and the anointing would come on
[2:12:27] him and he would took the gates of Gaza
[2:12:31] slew a thousand
[2:12:33] Philistines with a Jawbone of a old dead
[2:12:37] mule old dead donkey took the drob on
[2:12:40] and just 1,100 two a thousand
