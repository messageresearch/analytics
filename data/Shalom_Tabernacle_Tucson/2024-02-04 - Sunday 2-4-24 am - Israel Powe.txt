========================================

was given [Music] himly all things are only [Music] holy be holy be all things are possible be seated [Music] thing [Music] an that's what started that's exactly what done the whole thing was turning from God's she word she from the word and the first thing started prostitution in the Church of the Living God Christ bride she turned from the word and accepted Roman Dogma instead of God's word what's happened to every organization it did the very same [Music] thing now but promised that in the last days he would make a way to restore again the word of the Lord would drop upon the Earth as he did it in the beginning and all and will restore back what what started it against the word and what is this th supposed to do when he comes Anointed with God Spirit he just brings the faith of the children back to the fathers that's how he restores and you get the same word in the same place that it is here it's going to do the same thing Jesus said If any man be of mine if he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also am amen and when he asked him to do certain things he said I do just what the father shows me I don't do nothing till I see it first what I see the father doing that I do also the father worketh and then I worketh hither to see don't you see it well it's just like reading the newspaper now now first then he become an antichrist now it couldn't be Antichrist only in spirit then become an antichrist and that Spirit took a man that taught the same things that that Antichrist Spirit was doing and then he become a false prophet to the Antichrist spirit amen now what about a man in an organization to yourself I don't know what you think about it all right now finally he becomes a beast amen weit we'll get into that after a while see all right now is Satan's Trinity lays like that Satan all the time Satan Antichrist Spirit Antichrist spirit incarnate false prophet then becomes a beast see when not a demon that was in that Antichrist but when Satan himself is kicked out he comes down and takes over the place where the demon was the devil in then the devil is Incarnate in a man it's just repeating itself That's What Judas is Carrot was and what did he do was he one of the th that was against Christ why he was a treasure walk with him surely walked right along with him went out there and cast out devils and done just exactly what they did and Christ was the Incarnate God God incarnate in flesh Emmanuel and Judas was the son of predition as Jesus was Son of God incarnate God incarnate devil some people only SE three crosses at that time there was four of them there was three on gotha that we see that was Jesus in the middle a thief on his left the thief on his right and watch one Thief said to the other or said to Jesus if now you know he's the word but if thou be the word won't you save yourself won't you do something about it that's the same thing today have you heard these old Devils come say if you believe in the r healing here's somebody the ey don't you open their eyes smite me blind smite me blind the same old devil see come down off the cross we believe you if you be the Son of God turn these stones into bread same devil just walk away that's way Jesus did it he never clown for any of them put a rag over his hand over his precious eyes like that and they Tu a stick and hit him on top the said tell us if you're a prophet now tell us who hit you the chain the stick one to another now tell us who hit you we'll believe you're a prophet he never open his mouth he just said that he don't clown he just does as the father says let them go ahead their time's coming don't worry now they touched His Garment they felt no virtue but a poor little woman had a knee just touched His Garment he turned around said who touched me it's lot a different touch it depends on how you're touching what you believe now you see now as Satan is going to has incarnate himself from Antichrist the false prophet now and in the days of the Jew he is Antichrist amongst the early Church in the Dark Ages he become a false prophet to the world see there her couple of iniquity now that's to the church age now but in the age after the church goes home he becomes a beast he becomes the devil in innate the red dragon himself oh my can't you see what I mean he's incarnate in his people land he's got his people Bound by his power amen the false prophet has prophesied him right into it give them over to strong delusions to believe a ly be damned by denying the word with the farm of godliness God works this place in the Trinity justification sanctification and incarnate himself in his people at the baptism of the Holy Ghost same the Devil exist in a time after Christ oh Satan incarnates himself I what Satan when Jesus incarnates himself in his people the very life that was in Christ is in the person that's right what would it do if you took the life out of a grap Vine and put it in a pumpkin vine it wouldn't be pumpkins no more grapes why if you took the life out of a peach tree and put it in a pear tree would it bear pears no bear peaches the life tells what it is see when you say hear people say they got the Holy Ghost and deny this word there's something wrong the Holy Ghost wrote that word and Jesus said this if a man has my spirit in him he'll do my works you want to read that you going put it down St John 14:12 yeah all right he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do for I go to the father see then he sanctifies him cleans him so he can stand before God that drop of ink Falls there and takes him across the chasm see now watch Satan when he incarnates himself in his subjects they do the work that he did don't you see what did he do come right to that innocent woman to deceive her that's exactly what some of these Devils do come right into a place to say a little Pastor gets started out somewhere come and say oh if you just join up with us the same devil work now that's the truth am and when Satan become incarnate into his church and to be a devil then they are the ones that does the murdering and killing and so forth because Satan is a killer in the first place a liar see all right what does Satan do when he does when he becomes incarnate amongst the people it's his duty to be shrewd he is true you search the Bible and you show me where God ever dealt with intellectual people amen hunt amen and see if it isn't always the intellectuals that's devil possessed that's right it's a big word but it's a truth I challenge you to take the the leage from Abels to King and then 14 Generations run them out and see which ones was on the smart side and which ones are the humble ones why didn't Jesus choose such people you got fishermen and man that couldn't even sign their own name to put him the head of his church that's right wisdom is is nothing it's it's against Christ worldly wisdom is against Christ amen always Jesus never did telescope seminaries he never did it having Bible schools he said preach the word preach the gospel amen and now if he said these signs shall follow them and believe see you'll have to have the in other words he said go demonstrate the power of God to All Nations now watch Satan's duty is to pervert the word of God to wisdom's reasoning oh my oh then he marks his subjects by rejecting the original word will you will will you suffer me just a little bit before we get this listen I don't want you to miss this let me show you the type so you can see it all in typing and word and everything you can't you shouldn't go away confused in the Old Testament when a man have been sold to slavery there come a Year of Jubilee every 50 years 49th year then year Jubilee and when a slave heard this and he wanted to go free there's there isn't nothing that can keep him from going free he can throw down his hole and say so long go back home amen the trumpet sounded that's right but if he don't want to go and he's satisfied with his slave master then he's taken into the uh the temple and they're Tak an all you know what an all is and they press his ear and put a hole in his ear and it's a Mark that he can never go back amen is that that right he has to serve this master for all time I don't care how many more times a jubilee sounds whatever happens he's absolutely has has sold out his birth rights of being free and when a man turns down the gospel truth Satan marks him am where at his ear amen he deafens him so he can't hear the truth no more and he's finished he stays with the group that he's with if you w hear the truth that's right no you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free the truth makes free God marks his when they come God marks his by vindicating his promised word through them exactly St John uh 14:12 and another thing you going to put Mark 16 16 Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now let's just take that a minute was he joking did he just mean U did he just mean the apostles some would tell us watch read the background of It Go ye into where all the world preach the this gospel to what every creature it has not even one third of the way it yet these signs shall follow in all the world to Every Creature wherever this gospels preached these signs shall follow them that believe not just a one little handful like a fellow one time tell me God only give the 12 apostles Gifts of healing and many of the brother sitting here when he raised up to say that see you got enough up in a few minutes so now notice all the world that every creature these signs shall follow don't take Satan's unbelieving Mark now he'll put it on you tonight if you he do it you poke you up against the wall and you walk kind and say I don't know about that you go home and study it and then be sincere and pray because everything too it's too perfectly scriptural at this very hour this sacred hour time it's done been for years prove come right up to it and this is the hour this is the time right and now don't let him poke that in your ear his unbelieving Mark see because he was an unbeliever to begin with he doubted it all right oh don't even let don't let him take the scripture with his wisdom and and twist it and pervert it with his own wisdom into reasoning Powers you just be humble and say God said so and that's all now oh let's we're going to get too late so we better stop right here and start on now let's go with the second seal when the slain risen lamb opened it and the second uh ta like Beast said come see what the seal mystery is now we get it the lamb you remember has to open every seal and the second beast if you notice in the routine of where we just went through at the church stages the same name the second first was a line the next was a was a was like a calf or ox or something you see and this Beast said come see now and and when the lamb opened the seal and then uh went to see and when he walked in what happened let's see what he found come see there's a mystery sealed up here that's been here now for 2,000 years about let's see what it is now we find here that he saw what a red horse go forward now to my understanding this to my understanding this great sword that he had in his hand now we got about three things to look at now for about the next 15 20 minutes let's just read and see what he says here and there went out the fourth verse there went out another horse that was red the first and his white and power was given unto him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given him a great sword now there's symbols here and we want to look at them real close but to my understanding the best that I know now you see Jesus predicted the same thing in Matthew 24 amen see he said now you go to year of wars and rumors of Wars and this wars and rumors of wars and wars and but said all these ain't yet time ain't yet see they asked Jesus three questions see and he answered him in three questions that's where lot of our brethen got tangled up trying to place um the Adventist Breen about those sth day and so forth back there to war to her to give child give something the gates will be closed on the Sabbath day and things like that my it don't even pertain to the question at all not at all he answering what they asked but he didn't he didn't uh it didn't apply at all to the last days he said you'll here now we're working on this one thing here we'll come to some more of it in a few nights look he said you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and so forth now all this is not see that go back again and they'll deliver you up and so forth like this oh that's not right yet but when he got to the time when go talk to him about what they asked him about the end of the world when will all these things be when there about be one stone left up on what will the sign being when will be coming to the end of the world see they ask him three things then when he got down to the end of the world he said when you see the Fig Tree putting forth his F now you know all that the time is at the door and B I say to you that this generation shall not pass until all be fulfilled how the Infidel without the interpretation likes to lay on to that see he said this generation not the generation is's talking to the generation that's seen the Fig Tree putting forth his [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] l [Music] h [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] all he call he first Lov me and oh how I love

prayers for us during this trip they've made all the difference the long story short the kids got caught in a strong rip tide in the ocean on our last day in the galpagos after the fact the lady at the Boogie Board Shop and other locals told us that that beach has a really strong current and those waves are only for professionals on top of that it was an extra rough day on the water with no signage it is a third world country no life jackets on that no life jackets on there's another story with that three kids swept out into the ocean in waves as high as a house it was a nightmare I've never prayed so hard in my life someone called 911 a helicopter and a boat showed up but only then and by then the only two Surfers out there had seen that these were in trouble and came over to help it took a really long time to get them into the shore but Lucas actually lost his boogie board and at one point and somehow swam over to saa's board and hung on which is a miracle in itself for he can barely swim as you can imagine there's not much worse to witness as a parent I'm just praising the Lord and I'm here to say our God is real and an everpresent help in a time of trouble I called on him he answered and I know the prayers at Shalom made the difference thank you all for your prayers again and God bless you amen so we just want to thank the Lord for the miracle he done there and I think um she I don't know if he just sent to you to Olivia she had mentioned she thought she was coming home uh with three dead children they were afraid that they weren't going to be able to rescue them

house of the Lord with you this morning amen are you happy to be hereen it's always good to see the Saints the Saints of the most high God As We Gather we always counted a privilege to gather with you and um we like to go into the word word sorry came out a little bit late had a phone call at the last minute and Aaron translated for me there just never know how you going to be used and so I called him into the office he looked nervous like he was in trouble no he was he wasn't in trouble I just needed his help to interpret this call here so God bless you so you just never know how you God wants to use you he might call you come into the office amen so God bless you we trust the Lord will bless you let's just go right into the word we ask you to stand I have a place in the scripture found in uh Mark 11:22 and it's a very powerful scripture we all know it by heart or at least we can remember remember very familiar with it I should say these are the words of our Lord Jesus and um in verse number 22 actually let me see Mark 11 vers 2223 and 24 25 and 26 let's read that all together actually starting verse 22 and we'll go to verse 2 6 Mark 11 verse 22 Al together and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but Shall Believe those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whato ever he saith therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven forgive your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your your trespasses amen amen you know what really we can just we can really go home if we internalize that those words if we internalize those words we can just go home with our hands lifted up and say Lord please help me amen amen amen and um just as another witness in scripture we'll find it in Proverbs Chapter 20 Proverbs chapter 18 excuse me of course we want to remember the ones that are missing brother George and sister Brandy they're traveling and uh we pray the Lord would bring them back safely and uh the work that they're doing to help the body of Christ wherever they are and also the Saints in Phoenix there were Brother Art brother Steve and those Saints there we pray the Lord will bless them richly Proverbs 18 in verse let's see here number 21 when you have that say amen amen death and life are in the power of the tongue amen and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof you know the scripture is interesting it doesn't say death and life are in the power of God or power of Satan he's bringing this principle death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on this service this morning you bless your people we pray and we ask in Jesus name amen amen the title of the message this morning kind of deviating from what we've been on uh and talking about the end time and the closing days of the Gentiles and what we're to see the sign to take place and we we see the door closing and we see that these things are supposed to take place now and we know what we how to stand and what we're looking for but we move we're going to move into this little message here this morning and the title is we win by our confession we win by our confession and so we pray that the Lord will bless you God bless you you may be seated our confession or our profession are the words that come out of our mouth and as a sinner when they transition from being a sinner to becoming a saint there has to be a confession that's made corre and that confession speaks as to what's going on in their heart then they have to speak it out with their lips with their mouth amen and this is very very important this is part part of our experience I want to read just a sinner's prayer what we would call a sinner's prayer this is in the a message life story 1952 just to give you just what it entails what it um you know there's a confession there's coming to a recognition you you are here but you're now confessing that you want to be over here and you're talking to someone these are not just words out in the open you're talking to someone that actually hears what you're saying right and the principles of what you're saying he's going to catch that and then act upon what you are saying to him and so when the center this starts this is our very starting point of making any acknowledgement to God or coming to God in any kind of way it starts with a confession speaking from your mouth to him and this is very very important this will uh take you all the way through your Christian Journey this will be the determining Factor on many blessings that you will receive and not receive this will determine what level that you'll live on live at and the attitude and the framework that you walk in and work in and the atmosphere around you it's determined by this a simple little principle simple just words you say it's just words is it is just words but listen to the word to the sinner's prayers it's in the message the life story now while we have our heads bowed Let The Sinner say this so here brother brandom is now encouraging The Sinner to say this to repeat this prayer after him almighty God people repeat this prayer after brother brandham now come to I come now to thee I now come to thee sorry as a sinner accepting Jesus Christ thy son as my savior I believe in you God and I believe that you sent Jesus to take my place at Calvary in that that I could not do for myself being a sinner I accept what he did for me and I believe that in his death you was pleased to receive Me by his obedience therefore Lord nothing in my arms I bring none of my righteousness nothing that I can do only I believe your word and I accept it into my heart now receive leave me oh lord for I am sincere and from this day hence I will be your servant and in the hour of my death may Jesus Christ come down through the valley of the shadow of death and light up the way and bear my weary soul to the Haven of Rest until that time I will search after thee and seek for the Holy Spirit and till thou H has give it to me and I'll make my life the best of my knowledge a pattern or a salt to the unbeliever that they might see my work by my faith and come to you receive me oh God In The Name of Jesus Christ now beautiful beautiful how long did it take me to quote that it's said couple minutes a minute or two few seconds but in the beginning of that prayer you started out as a sinner a few minutes later you're no longer a sinner now you're praying for Sinners did you catch that in the prayer that from this day forward I will pattern my life after you and may my life be a light to other Sinners how long does it take from a sinner to become a saint just to few words just a few words just a few words of confession changes the entire life pattern practices thoughts places you used to go things you used to do things you didn't care about all wrapped up in one little prayer amen and then the one you're praying to knows you need needs strength and power to keep the words of the promise of that prayer so he gives you the strength to do it amen amen praise the Lord somebody you know what that's a sinner's prayer but that's a Saints prayer too A lot of that I need to say that again I need to say it to where I can hear it Faith cometh by what it didn't say who was saying it Faith cometh by what he what if you're saying it by faith and you're hearing it by faith do you think that's going to bless you come on Saint wake up Church wake up tap your neighbor wake them up Faith cometh by hearing hearing comes don't hit them now just tap them hearing comes by the word of the Lord and this is how Faith Comes faith comes by hearing amen now this principle oh my goodness it's so powerful it it seems generic uhuh you see know Stars popping off we didn't see the light flashes there one guy come up there dragging himself or one girl coming up to the Altar and ask and said a few words a few words change my life in a sinner's prayer thank you Jesus hallelujah praise God amen just a few words Saints to God take that sinner through a sinner's prayer and make them into a saint just a few words now this this is so beautiful because we can go back and hear the words of Jesus Through the written word and the purpose that it was written down was that so that you can come and repeat what was written down so words are written down anything that's written down it's written down so that it can be read right that's the purpose that is written down it's amazing how we'll come into service and we'll think that everything going on in the service you'll remember but you're not going to remember I I preach a sermon I don't remember everything I said how you going to remember everything I said it's amazing you come and you'll listen to the word you listen to the tape and somehow you think your beautiful lovely mind as it is is going to catch everything retain everything and keep everything fresh in your spirit and you know that the service was good and you know that the presence of the Lord was there and you know God was speaking to you but yet you won't record it you won't write it down to rehearse it again I'm here to remind you if it's that good write it down in your whatever you write it down on and read it again in the quietness of your home and it might make you say Amen again amen it might bless you again but this is this is why it is recorded I'm going to go through a few scriptures here just for a moment where the Lord is commanding that the Ten Commandments be written down he put them in stone he commanded that certain curses and Promises write them down so they can be rehearsed again and this this is what our Bible is it's the written accounts of the words of the Lord and it's written down so that it can be rehearsed again or so that it can be read again all right Exodus 17 ver10 16 says so Joshua did as Moses had said to him yeah fought with amch and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hand that Israel prevailed and when we let down his hand amch prevailed but Moses's hands were heavy yeah and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his hands the one on one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted amalik and of his people with the edge of The Sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and do what and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua amen for I will utterly put out the remembrance of amch from under the Heaven from under heaven and Moses built an altar called the name of it Jehovah nii for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with AMC from generation to generation so the Lord wanted this recorded in a book of memory it's written down so that it can be read again exactly and when it's read read again it brings back your memory what took place this is the evidence because it's written down it's recorded and that's the value of it it's not going off I kind of remember I kind of remember grandma and them said or Grandpa and them said I kind of think I kind of remember no this gets rid of all of that the personal eyewitness testimonies are great but when you have a written record of what taking place place you yourself the reader can see exactly what happened amen amen amen Exodus 34:1 and the Lord said unto Moses heue the two tables out of stone like under the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou breakast verse 27 and the Lord said unto Moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel so the written word now brings the reader into the presence of what was said exactly now all of Israel didn't have to be on the mountain all of Israel didn't see every detail that Moses saw but Israel knows what God said because Moses wrote it down and in writing it down it keeps The Word Alive to the reader amen this is how it comes alive again a closed book ain't saying nothing but when you open the book and read it then the book begins to speak and the promises begin to speak once you read them again this is the blessing that comes with reading the word meditating up on the word and then speaking the word amen there's a blessing that comes with it amen the scripture tells us that death and life lays in the power of the tongue amen and this command is not something that we just learn by ourself these are the this is what the Lord did himself in the beginning he says Let There Be yes he did he spoke it out over and over and over and showing how creation happened how things came into existence through the spoken word so these recordings are on record so that we don't have to take somebody's memory or faulty you know somebody's version of it you know I was when we went back East Sharon and I we we went through the one of the Bible Tums there of the different Bibles and one of the uh they had a Bible they call it a slave Bible and this Bible they had to scratch out parts that talked about their freedom because they didn't want the people to read that what the B what the good book said about them and so that's what the enemy will do read part of it read half of it read you know that part from way back when don't read about the stuff for today don't read about the stuff that has to deal with you because if you read it and then you begin to meditate on that and begin to speak it something's got to happen something will happen amen amen so we don't want to stay ignorant do we it's recorded for that reason Deuteronomy 7: 18 and 20 and it shall be when he sth upon the throne of his kingdom that he should write him a copy of this law in the book out of that which is before the priest of Levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his God to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them that his heart be not lifted up above his Brethren that he turn not aside from the Commandment to the right hand or to the left hand to to the left to to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel so the Lord is talking about when they come into the land and God establishes kings that these Kings need to keep the law a copy of the law of the book from the priests from through the Levites and it shall be with him that you read it day and night and in reading this it'll keep your heart from getting lifted up above others in reading this you'll recognize who you are and who God is and it keeps the words of the Lord alive you know the tape comes alive not on the Shelf it comes alive not sitting in the player it comes alive when you play it and as you play it the the words come across you hear it and now you can have faith yes amen amen somebody amen Jeremiah or uh Deuteronomy 27 1-8 and Moses with the Elders of Israel commanded the people saying keep all the Commandments I which I command you this day and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee that thou Shall Set thee up great stones and plaster them with plaster and thou shall write upon them all the words of this law when thou are passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the Lord God of thy fathers has promised thee therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan that ye shall set up these Stones yes amen which I commanded you this day in the mount ebal and thou sh plaster them with plaster and there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord thy God and and an altar of stones Thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings therein unto the Lord thy God so he's telling them to take the law now take these stones and build them up and plaster them and on the plaster write the laws as you enter into the land make it erected very high so that the people can read this can see this um the people that sell whatever they sell they know the power of a beautiful advertisement McDonald's knows this uh all whatever place you shop they plaster these Billboards they take every space any space they can to put their name up there or picture of what they're trying to sell up there so that you can see it we all know what the menu is at McDonald's we all heard of McDonald's how many hasn't heard of McDonald's but man they sure don't stop advertising do they because they remind you that you need a Big Mac they remind you that you need a number three or a number seven I think is two double cheeseburgers there's only two you know the number one and number two that's where I go and you know you get into that before that menu you act like you ain't never been there before like what do I want you know what you want stop playing we all know what you want cuz you get the same thing every time you drove up here because you already knew what you wanted I want not Burger King I don't want I want a B I want a big back so I go to McDonald's and just go get it but when you get there you start they start flashing these other thing here this is UN special that's maybe I want that maybe well that's not why you came you came because they advertised yeah and they kept it fresh in your mind hey we're still here and the Lord is advertising in the laws of Moses before the children of Israel for the old Elders that were there and for the youngers and then for the little Bitties the little Bitties would raise up from their cradle all the way up seeing the laws we can't read yet but when I can read I'll know what it says amen oh my amen Lord help me this morning to deliver this message with all of my heart you know in reading that ability to read we first learn how to hear and we learn how to hear and to speak before we learn how to read but the the the the the readings the things that we read are written down for that purpose for it to be read it might be a secret you want somebody else to read it it might be for only certain eyes but it's written down for somebody to read it again it might be just for you to read it again right am remind yourself what you're going through or remind yourself of these important truths and these points so you can go and meditate on them again and this what it's written down for us so it can be read again but this ability to read takes some skill you someone has to teach you how to read amen and so our speech and our hearing is developed first and that's how we are taught to read many times as we're repeating what someone else is telling us that word means see that word there th sound it out and then the the child or the the the student hears it they hear it in their ear and then they have to repeat it properly the way the teacher is trying to teach them now the written portion of the ability the read the ability to read is great and I mean it can be can't be over uh emphasize the beauty of being literate oh the power that's released when you can read it what the laws say and what what your rights are and what you know what was written about you it's beautiful when you come into that knowledge of being able to read and then when you read it it now comes alive to you am amen amen it now means something because you can read it you know maybe you heard somebody else say it and maybe you heard rumors about it but when the document comes into your hands and it on your desk and it's in your study now when you read it it becomes yours now God and when it becomes yours you quote it like it's yours you Proclaim it you declare it you believe it like it's yours then it's really alive now amen can I get a witness here this this morning amen amen this is the power of taking your Bible whether you understand it all or not start somewhere and just read it read it when you don't understand read it when you can't pronounce it just read it because in reading it you'll learn to develop the voice of the book and what is saying what is telling you and when you learn how to read it you it you you you uh internalize it in a way like nobody else quoting it to you can that's why you get your own book your own Bible your own study time and read it and in reading it it comes alive to you it amen let's go a little bit further glory to God Ezekiel 43 Jeremiah 36 rather and it came to pass in the fourth year of jeim the son of Josiah king of Judah that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying take thee a ro of a book and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel against Judah and against all the nations from the day I spake unto thee from the day of Josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpos to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin then Jeremiah called baric the son of n baric wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord amen can you say praise the Lord he wrote it why' he write it God told him to what was the purpose in writing it so that so that maybe somebody might read it and then they might repent uh-huh amen and this is this is one of the reasons why it's written down so that it can tell you how to behave and how your future may go and how you know you can prepare yourself it's written down so that you can have the evidence in the proof so when it comes to pass you can see oh that was written over there it's written down so it can be re rehearsed to somebody maybe it's not to this one or that one but it's written for somebody everybody don't take it the same way when Jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden I'll give you rest he was talking to somebody I'm glad they recorded it somewhere cuz when I reread it he was talking to me he was talking to to you but everybody can't read it that way they don't hear it that way but it has to be reread over and over and over again glory to God and then that makes the book come alive yes it does now yes it does this these few little points in Matthew or Mark chap 11 if you take your Bible there just for a moment Jesus said in verse 22 first thing he says is have faith in God we all ready together didn't we yes he says to have faith in God that's to believe in God without faith it's impossible to please him and in coming to him he is now talking to the Believers and he lays out these five four or five things to have faith in God the second thing he says is to say or to speak what you have need of the third thing he says is Not To Doubt in your heart what you said so first is have faith in God have faith in God and then say say what you what what's the scripture say take me verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain so first have faith in God then say to the mountain say to the circumstance or the situation say to the piece of dirt say to the grain say to several grains say it to the mountain and then don't be don't doubt in your heart what you said and then forth he says believe what you said amen okay and he he shall what he shall have what he said this is what our lord Jesus has laid out to them now this speaking is um is based on our motives and objectives number one is also based on God's perfect will it's not going to override his word his word is here and you and and you could take this principle and and you stand on it you have faith in God you say to the mountain don't doubt what you said then believe what you said and you shall have what you said you know it's all based on what you said what did you say and and um the scripture in Proverbs tells us that death and life am lay in the power of the tongue am you know we take this because the are these are the words of Jesus and this is a positive confirmation on claiming what God has given you yes amen and I want all of you young people and middleaged and old whoever you are to remember this that you know your positive testimony is so important yes it is your positive outlook is so important even even if it's dark even if you're going to surgery even if they don't have an answer to your problem and you going to the hospital it's better it make you feel better your whole atmosphere is better if you're positive if you're thinking in your mind that you know it's never happened before but my life is in God's hands Lord I believe all things were well you knew I would come here I don't desire this pain but I know you're my life is in your hands and I'm laying it all to you that's so much better Hallelujah than reading all the negative testimonies of those who died and it didn't work for that one and that one didn't didn't work it's so much better to stay with the Positive amen amen what if I came in here I thought everybody uh didn't like me huh yeah of course that's not true I know everybody loves me uh everybody who love me let me see your hand Hallelujah all right I didn't see them all but I know it's in there what if I came in here thinking that nobody loved me huh I walk through the door nobody loves me there nobody loves me even the ones that say they do they don't mean it yeah they just playing they don't nobody loves me you what what kind of atmosphere are you going to have have on you what kind of atmosphere does God have to override to even speak to you what difference does it make who likes you and who don't like you God wants to speak to you so but the enemy gets our atmosphere all messed up on who likes us and who doesn't like us so it's always better to error if you're going to error on the side of the positive don't you say Amen just believe that everybody loves you believe that everybody is on your team on your side rooting for you amen everybody is not worried about how long you're going to preach well I need to believe that that's right come on now I had to slide that in there I have to believe that everybody would stay here for 3 hours and never get up and leave right so this positive thinking is is that that's what God desires for us but let's flip that over to the negative side if if you believe the negative if you talk the negative if you don't doubt that the negative is not going to happen guess what you going to get it works both ways MH it works both ways you believe negative you hear negative you don't doubt that it's it's true this negative negative negative and what are you going to get you're going to get exactly what you expected exactly what you believe exactly what came out of your mouth that's what it's going to be negative negative negative because God operates on the principles of planting a seed and when you plant a seed he'll make that seed grow yes he does good seeds are bad seeds yes he does so these are the principles that God gives to us amen all right so it's written down in the book you know I like this in Luke Chapter let's take Hava chapter 2 verse number 2 to three says and the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that read it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not tar can you say amen amen read that one more time and the Lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon the tables that he may run that what read if he reads it he'll run yes amen he'll run with what he'll run with what was written down right amen that's why it's written down so it can be read and then you read it it takes on life Luke 1 1-4 here's an eyewitness Luke scholarly uh the physician he's called in verse one it says for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order amen most excellent theopus that thou mest know the certainty of those things wherein thou H has been instructed so Luke was an eyewitness others were eyewitnesses and they talked about what they witness but here Luke says I thought I need to put it on record myself and put it in order so that you can read it and know for surely that it came to pass amen it's not enough just to remember it by memory but it's so nice to take the words of the Lord and then have those words recorded amen write it down that's why it's written down is so that it can be read and then after it's read it's meant to be spoken yes amen and this speech comes from you yes amen these are the words that you speak from your mouth this is why our testimony has to be positive all the time in the negative in the negative news cycle in the negative generation and a negative negative negative negative you have to think positive you have to speak positive and you have to say what God says about you right right you need to develop that your tongue needs to know how to say it and only say the blessings of the Lord the scriptural truths of the Lord and the things that concern your future your life your sickness your health your condition your circumstance your family oh my just positive testimony according to to what the word give us to say so this this has to be brought into its balance in Romans chapter 8 just for a moment we'll turn there and the Apostle Paul says shall all these things separate us from the love of God shall Peril shall sickness sell death amen that's Romans chapter 8 right yes it says this verse 18 I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us and he goes on we're saved by hope drop down it says we know that verse 28 we know that all things work together for good amen to them that love God Amen to them who are the called according to his purpose what things work for good all things work for good why don't we say that more than just saying that you know it's never nothing ever works out for me I never you know I you know I just don't I I don't know why this always follows me I don't know why I have this lot in life I don't know why this always happens to me I knew it was going to happen to me why don't we quote this that all things work together for the good to them that are called we're not talking about everybody we talking about them at that sinner's prayer we was talking about yeah amen we're talking about the Sinners that were made Saints all things work together for the good don't worry about it it's working for your good amen amen tell some body yeah ex let somebody tell you all things are working together for the good so them that are called for his purpose verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ right amen tribulation distress persecution famine NE his pearl sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we were counted at sheep for the slaughter he asked a question now he answers it in verse S what does he say nay let's say that together you know I was going to ask it huh nay in all these things we are more than conquerors can I get one or two people to stand up and say I'm more than a conqueror can you stand on your feet I am more I am more than a conqueror through Christ him that loved us God bless you thank you amen amen amen that's what the Bible says I heard everybody else what they had to say what does the Bible say what does the word say nay in all these things we are more than conquerers through him that loved us so this all happens through him exactly this happens through him doesn't matter what kind of job I have or I don't have I am more than a conqueror through him cuz he loves me exctly am praise the name of the Lord I feel happy this morning amen amen we are more than conquerors through him that love loved us so his love for us gives us this gives us this Freedom yes Amen to know that we're conquerors amen it's it was in last week's bulletin I want to take that can I get last week's bulletin one more time Joe I'm sorry I asked for it and you put it back in there again Faith have faith for maybe we can find it on the in the message there it's in

faith in God and confess it and believe it and you'll be the winner on that job you'll be the winner amen yes amen yes this is God's word now yes it is God said it now let's let's deal with this speaking and this ability to speak James deals with it very nicely in James chapter 3 amen and he's going to deal with all of us now amen what the challenge we have to face in James chapter 3 all right amen I'm going to talk about your tongue just for a minute verse number two for many things we offend all If any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to Bridle the whole body behold we put bits into the H's mouth that they may that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helmly withs soever Governor lth even so the tongue is a little member and boasted great things beh great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body amen and sth on fire the course of of of Nature and it is set on fire of Hell oo whose tongue is he talking about for every kind of a beast of birds and of the serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison we talking about a man or a snake what are we talking about therefore we bless God even the father and there were curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessings and cursings Proverbs 18 my brethren these things ought not so to be talks about the fountain sending forth Sweet Water and bitter water talks about how a wise man and do with knowledge among you let him show forth out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom now the Bible's very clear about our tongue and how we speak now the the purpose as we said that the words of the Lord have been recorded is so that they can be read outside of the present writing it was written in a certain presence written in a certain atmosphere but was it's it's meant to be read in another time in another atmosphere that's why it's written down it's handed down generation to generation or it's you know given here but then I'm going to reive it over there I'm reread it reread it reread it doesn't change the words but the people hearing it it ought to change them yes as they hear it and this is the same Principle as to why the message we have today has been recorded on tape yes amen it was recorded for the purpose of storing up food so that the people in the future would have something to feed on Amen people that were born in the 70s and the 80s or the 90s on down born in the 60s or born at any time maybe you know they were born at the time but they never heard the words or been to the Tabernacle themselves amen they never knew it they never understood they didn't know they didn't have the privilege of being in that local area they're from another time another place so the angel of the Lord moves brother brandham to record the sermons for that purpose exactly this is why the Bible is recorded amen so that you can read it amen and then when you read it then you speak it you speak what you read and when you speak what you read you own that becomes your confession your testimony good and so brother random tells us here I'll read a couple of those on um his ministry to store up the tapes he says this in the message uh wisdom versus faith faith paragraph 31 so I went back in the little place where we've been out a little place called Klondike about 40 mi from any civil civilization one a little store for ranchers and things and looked like it was Klondike and I turned out to be to it turned out to be this Tabernacle I was standing right here I was calling in great barrels of the prettiest food I ever seen radishes look like three foot long and turnips and greens and potatoes and everything and he said store in plenty of it and I was standing there just storing it in and these series of messes Jer this is right around 1962 um that he uh is starts talking about storing up food raises the value of recording his sermons right now is it valuable to be in the service for sure is it valuable to hear it on your natural ear sure absolutely but it's it it goes further and deeper if we can record that sermon now even if I was in the service a week later play it for me again it's going to benefit me is that right and it'll benefit those that wasn't in the service and if you were in the service you see the beauty of it you see why it had to be recorded you see the beauty of a Bible right and having the bible verses to take what the Bible says about water baptism what does the Bible say about being a Christian what does the Bible say about the communion and foot washing in the Lord's Supper what does the Bible say about speaking in tongues in the gifts of the Spirit everybody here has something they want to say including us we have something that we want to say but what does the Bible say it's recorded in his word yes it so we go back to that recording so this was the command given to the prophet taking siid with Jesus 1962 he he says paragraph Number 103 you remember what the dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up food Hallelujah where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have now of course our little brothers here that's along here these are little churches are us we're one where would you go to to find it show its comparison anywhere you go right out into denominational Creeds you go right out away from the name of the Lord Jesus you go right out away from these other things see and here is where the food has been stored up well one message I preach here look like i' I've been preaching from one to six hours to you on a message well if I had to use one of those message I take a week to take it just a little bit here a little bit there see because it's been stored up here amen it's on tapes it'll go worldwide on the tapes where people in their houses them tapes will fall right into the hand of the predestinated of God will he can direct the word he'll direct everything just exactly to its course that's the reason he sent me back to do this store up the food here Lord he forbade me to go overseas so here the Lord is instructing the prophet to store up the food amen and why is it to be stored up so we can get a copy of it and say we got a copy so we can get it and load it up in our homes and on our bookshelves and put a title over it what is it stored up for it's stored up so that we can hear it amen amen put the tape on hear it for yourself and what you hear repeat am amen amen is that okay yes amen what you hear said say it again amen and that's really what confession means confession means to say the same thing by his stripes I don't feel too good I don't know the doctor gave me this evil report by here that ain't in the word by his stripes I don't feel well no that wasn't in the Declaration by his stripes we are what healed healed that's the Declaration what should be coming out of your mouth so so wait wait wait wait I'll say that after he heals me that's not in the Declaration either you can't make up the rules amen by his stripes I'm Healed on my way to the doctor's office in the doctor's office come coming out of the doctor's office I declare the word of the Lord past present and future when he said it it was true when he said it back then it was true when he says it today it's still true amen y'all got a witness on that amen am amen so none of us are sick how can I be healed and sick at the same time who's sick in here nobody's sick by stripes we are healed amen isn't that nice don't you prefer to be healed than to be sick amen that's the Declaration that he makes for us so the food is stored up for that purpose to hear what the word of the Lord has to say to us it's recorded that way it was admonished to be that way let me take one more in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph number number five and once just a a while ago when you showed the vision the little Tabernacle here about to store up the food that there would come a time when this would all be needed amen when we seen brother sofman and brother wood ready to cross over into another country but you said store up this food here for the time what time would that be will we ever get to the point where we don't need to hear the prophets well some people have gotten to that point huh it's sad yeah God told him to store it up now what people do with it that's what they do with it can't control that what people do with the Bible can't control that what people do with your your flag you can't control that what people do with your race you can't control that they don't speak for don't speak for everybody in the race but I can control this right here and I can control what God gave me and God gave us his word and that's what we stand on that's what is positive that's what's going to take place and that's how we win actually amen that's how we win the battle amen now I'd like to go a little bit further and I know know and trust I trust and know it will be blessing to you because it's from the word of the Lord the the prophet of God goes into this message here and he says this here in the message position of the believer 1955 now if you're a Believer paragraph 18 now if you're a Believer I I believe that I know what the greatest curse that's on the church today is not knowing what they are now with the help of God this afternoon the holy scriptures if he will help us let us try to try to place the believer positionally in Christ and show what his authority is in Christ then everybody out there will be praying for the sick and we'll have a great meeting I'm sure so brother mam shows us that the greatest curse is Believers not knowing who they are their position they don't know that death and life lays in the power of the tongue they know it but that little member of the tongue he so quick he'll say it before you can catch what he's saying amen he'll say just speak negative because he's speaking what this is going through the carnal he's not speaking what the word says no man can tame that tongue but God can you ask the Holy Spirit to tame my tongue to say what the word of the Lord says amen Psalms 37 1-5 says fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herd herb trust in the Lord and do good so shall thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass amen amen praise the Lord amen that's good food for the believer yes it is trust in the Lord with all thy heart lean not to your own understanding fret not thyself because of evildoers Amen oh my the Lord's going to bring it to pass you commit it to him he'll bring it to pass is that right Saints oh my beautiful how it works and how this confession works works and I'll just take two places here and and then and then I'll close all right in the message my new ministry the prophet of God says this here in paragraph 2117 now I'm sure you all can see what it is it's a coming of a greater deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit how to get into it I don't know only thing I know it takes God to put you into it so you just live a sweet and humble and close to go as close to God as you can don't doubt him amen amen just believe that everything is working just to the good for you and everything will work around all right can somebody say man just believe everything is working for the good just believe that everything is working for the good you're a Believer it's got to work for your favor and if somebody ask you tame that tongue somebody asked you to say everything is working for the good Hallelujah and you might have just got off the phone with something that broke your heart right but when it's time for you to speak what you going to say say what the word says everything is working for the good place it in God's hands he continues on in the same message now every one of you not only ministers but all of you ought to pray for these people you don't know what God might do for you while you pray for somebody else right amen what if you say the right thing amen what if here is a woman standing here that's so sick they have to hold her up what if your prayer would be the right thing just like Bank said the right thing like Hattie said the right thing what if you would say the right thing your prayer to cause God to come down and do something amen you know sometimes we say what our eyes see and our eyes are we're not supposed to say what our eyes see that ain't what the scripture saying somebody coming in here oh they look terrible man wow goodness they're hooked they're in a wheelchair this and that and then you say that that's not what you're supposed to say you're supposed to quote what the word says we're coming to pray for them lay hands upon them by their stripes by his stripes they are healed if you're going to say anything at all let it be positive or don't say nothing amen but soon as you declare it soon as you say it death and life lays in the power of the tongue we see a lot of negative but we're not supposed to quote a lot of negative in fact we're not supposed to quote any negative Our Testimony should always be positive correct amen amen somebody brother brandom continues and he says this here oh my maybe you might not have that the spontaneous Faith to bring something this is in the message it shall be even as it was told me maybe you might not have this spontaneous Faith to bring something just a miracle right to you you may not have that kind of Faith but Jesus said if you had the faith like a mustard seed you could say to the mountain be moved and by it would come to pass it wouldn't vanish it away but by and by it would come to pass now the Mustard Seed the reason he said you could mix kale you can mix spinach breed together but you can't mix mustard with nothing it won't mix it's just mustard to be mustard some people this is in the second Miracle 1951 brother randam says this I have to get this in for you some people has great big Faith like this Anything Can Happen the next has faith that deep takes a little longer the next has faith that deep takes quite a little while some has faith fa like mustard seed but it's Mustard Seed Faith genuine if it's Mustard Seed Faith genuine Faith hold on to it just keep believing it it'll become marble Faith then it'll become grapefruit faith and then it'll become Mountain Faith it'll bring you right out if you just stay with it hold on to it it'll bring you right straight to the light if you'll stay with it oh my amen don't you love the Lord yes amen all right yes sir this will be my last one here if I can find it for you here quickly sure I can yes where I think Pentecostals the Pentecostals fail he says this here paragraph number 14 you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you amen you say well I hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way Glory he does don't never think that you could ever ask ask too much of God I believe the scripture says you have not because you ask not you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys will be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things ask big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all and you've got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work and it'll just be fine and I believe that that we can ask God for the little things for the great things amen the positive things that he gives us in his word he's laid them out for us I believe they're for us I believe that God has already paid the price for us and we just have to confess that know what his word says take a stand on it and then believe what he said don't doubt in our heart amen quote it say it and then you'll have it you know that last verse in Mark 11 24 says this therefore I say unto you desire what things you desire what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them so there are the things that he says whatever things you desire whatever whatever I say when you desire that there's a desire then you pray and you believe in what you pray and then believe that you receive them then you shall have them so what kind of prayer should you have Lord I hope one day you deliver me oh you claim it Lord I claim the Deliverance that you purchased at Calvary for me I claim my family that you purchased at Calvary for me I claim the holy ghost that you purchased at Calvary for me I claim all of the blessings that you purchased at Calvary for me I claim them lord they're mine I believe it and I'll take a stand for it in jesus' name in these prayers this is how we win Saints we overcome the blood by our testimony we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word Word of Our Testimony no more negative amen no more negative testimonies we don't want to hear it want to hear the positive amen you need to hear the positive it needs to come out of your mouth God will richly bless you amen let us pray father we thank you for your word this morning thank you for the promises in it that we can claim every
