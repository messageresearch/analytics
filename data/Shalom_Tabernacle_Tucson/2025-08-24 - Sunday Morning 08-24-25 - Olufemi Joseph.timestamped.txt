[0:01] [Music]
[0:14] Morning everyone. Could we all stand?
[0:18] Open in a word of prayer.
[0:21] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to
[0:23] be here this morning. Lord, we're
[0:26] thankful for our salvation and all that
[0:28] you've done for us. And Father, helping
[0:31] us grow in grace.
[0:34] Lord Jesus, we I can't imagine what you
[0:37] went through for us. You are obedient
[0:40] unto death, even the death of the cross.
[0:43] Thank you for your suffering, Lord. We
[0:45] thank you that we can reap those
[0:46] benefits today.
[0:48] Father, be with us now in this Sunday
[0:50] school with the children in their class
[0:53] and all those that are on the way. We'll
[0:56] give you all the praise and the glory.
[0:57] In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[0:59] ask it. Amen.
[1:04] We're going to be listening to the
[1:06] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:08] and the earthly bride. I'll start at
[1:11] paragraph 40 and end after 72.
[1:16] Can we sing Only Believe?
[1:19] Only
[1:21] believe.
[1:25] Only
[1:26] believe.
[1:30] All things are possible.
[1:35] Only
[1:37] believe.
[1:40] Only
[1:42] believe.
[1:45] Only
[1:47] believe
[1:50] all things are possible.
[1:56] Only
[1:58] believe.
[2:00] If we can remain standing for the
[2:03] reading of the God's holy word. In honor
[2:05] of that, brother Brandham is going to
[2:07] start with reading a scripture in second
[2:09] Peter chapter 3 and Revelation
[2:14] chapter 21.
[2:16] Brother Brandon,
[2:22] &gt;&gt; second Peter 3.
[2:24] This second epistle, beloved, I now
[2:27] write unto you in both which I stir up
[2:30] your pure minds by the way of
[2:32] remembrance, that ye may be mindful of
[2:35] the words which were spoken before by
[2:39] the holy prophets and of the
[2:42] commandments of us the apostles
[2:46] of the Lord and Savior, knowing this
[2:48] first that there shall come in the last
[2:51] days scoffers walking after their own
[2:53] lust.
[2:55] and saying, "Where is the promise of his
[2:57] coming?"
[2:59] If that don't meet this infidel woman,
[3:02] and
[3:05] since the fathers fell asleep, all
[3:07] things continue as they were from the
[3:11] beginning of the creation.
[3:14] For this they willingly are ignorant of
[3:18] that by the word of God the heavens were
[3:22] of old and the earth standing out of the
[3:25] water and in the water. Whereby the
[3:28] world that then was being overflowed
[3:31] with water perished.
[3:34] But the heavens and the earth, which now
[3:36] are by the same word, are kept in store,
[3:40] reserve unto fire against the day of
[3:43] judgment, and the predition of ungodly
[3:45] man. But beloved, be not ignorant of
[3:48] this one thing, that one day is with the
[3:52] Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand
[3:55] years as one day. Now the Lord is not
[3:59] slack concerning his promise, as some
[4:01] man counts slackness, but is
[4:04] longsuffering
[4:06] to usward, not willing that any should
[4:09] perish, but that all might come to
[4:11] repentance. But the day of the Lord will
[4:14] come as a thief in the night, in which
[4:16] the heavens and the earth with a great
[4:20] noise shall pass away with a great
[4:22] noise, and the elements shall melt with
[4:25] fervent heat, and the earth also, and
[4:28] the works that are therein shall burn
[4:31] up. Seeing then that all these things
[4:35] shall be dissolved,
[4:38] what manner of person ought we to be in
[4:41] all holy conversation and godliness,
[4:44] looking for the hastening until the
[4:47] coming of the day of God, wherein the
[4:51] heavens being on fire shall be
[4:53] dissolved, and the elements shall melt
[4:55] with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we
[4:57] according to his promise look for new
[5:02] heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth
[5:05] righteousness. Wherefore, beloved,
[5:08] seeing that we look for such things,
[5:12] be diligent that you may not be found
[5:15] may be found of him in peace without
[5:18] spot, without blemish, and accounting
[5:21] that the long suffering of the Lord is
[5:24] salvation, even as our beloved Paul,
[5:28] according to the wisdom given unto him,
[5:32] has written unto you,
[5:35] as also So all his epistles, speaking in
[5:40] them of the things which are sometimes
[5:44] hard to be understood, which they that
[5:48] are unlearned and unstable wrestle rest
[5:52] as
[5:54] they do also the other scriptures unto
[5:58] their own destruction.
[6:01] Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know
[6:04] these things before, beware lest ye also
[6:08] being led away with error of the wicked,
[6:12] fall from your steadfastness. But grow
[6:15] in grace in the knowledge of the Lord
[6:18] and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory
[6:21] both now and forever. Amen. Now in the
[6:26] the revelation of Christ in the 21st
[6:30] chapter, I read these words.
[6:34] And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
[6:38] For the first heaven and the first earth
[6:40] were passed away, and there were no more
[6:43] sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the
[6:46] new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
[6:49] of heaven, prepared as a bride adored
[6:51] for her husband.
[6:53] And I heard a great voice out of heaven,
[6:55] saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God
[6:58] is with man, and he shall dwell with
[7:00] them, and they shall be his people, and
[7:02] God himself shall be with them and be
[7:04] their God. And God shall wipe away all
[7:08] tears from their eyes. And there shall
[7:10] be no more death, neither sorrowing nor
[7:13] crying, neither should there be any more
[7:15] pain, for the former things have passed
[7:18] away." And he that sat upon the throne
[7:21] said, "Behold, I make all things new."
[7:23] He said unto me, "Write, for these words
[7:26] are true and faithful." And he said unto
[7:29] me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega,
[7:34] the beginning and the end. And I will
[7:36] give unto him that is a thirst of the
[7:38] fountains of the water uh of life
[7:42] freely. He that overcomemeth shall
[7:45] inherit all things and I will be his God
[7:47] and he shall be my son. Let us pray
[7:51] again. Lord Jesus with such a promise
[7:55] and such stern talk as Jesus himself and
[7:59] the apostle has given us concerning the
[8:01] hour we are approaching.
[8:04] Give us, oh Lord, thy direction
[8:08] &gt;&gt; that we might know how to approach it in
[8:12] the right way because it's coming. We
[8:15] know the scriptures must be fulfilled
[8:19] and so shall it be. Now, Lord, we ask
[8:22] your mercy again upon us all as we study
[8:25] thy word. Be with us and unfold it to
[8:28] us, Lord. For we asked it in Jesus name.
[8:31] Amen. Amen. Be seated.
[8:38] Now,
[8:40] I wonder if there could be a way that
[8:43] perhaps maybe they could turn the lights
[8:45] from the main auditorium off and just
[8:47] leave them on the platform here, which
[8:49] would probably be better, and take some
[8:51] of the current. We uh about burn up a
[8:54] transformer the other night and if the
[8:56] uh uh custodian will do that for us we
[8:59] appreciate turn the bottom lights the
[9:01] main auditorium lights off and then I
[9:05] think you'll have plenty of room to see
[9:06] the right now
[9:09] the subject again to announce it that we
[9:12] are approaching
[9:14] the the subject of the future home of
[9:18] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[9:21] bride.
[9:23] Now, as it's been I'm just going to have
[9:26] to do this. It's just too hot up here.
[9:31] As as we are I know my wife don't like
[9:33] me to do that, but that take my coat
[9:34] off. It's just too hot up here. See, you
[9:36] got air out there. It's just cut off in
[9:38] a little pin there.
[9:40] Now in the um in the future or in the
[9:44] past rather we have studied the seven
[9:47] seals the seven churches brother veil
[9:50] and those are working upon those now
[9:52] faithfully to get them in book form
[9:55] and seeing all these mysterious things
[9:57] that we have seen come to pass
[10:00] then I think after understanding that in
[10:04] the hour that we're living in and the
[10:06] position there's no one that would want
[10:10] to sit down real sensibly and examine
[10:14] what has been spoken of and what is
[10:17] promised to happen and what has
[10:19] happened. But what could say that those
[10:22] things are fulfilled.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said he would do. He
[10:27] did it just exactly to the letter. Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Now, I think in this that not knowing
[10:33] what time that the Lord Jesus might
[10:36] appear,
[10:38] uh, I thought it would be good, it
[10:40] seemed pleasing to the Holy Spirit that
[10:42] we speak on this and and maybe come back
[10:44] to it again two or three times because I
[10:47] won't have quite ample time to get all
[10:50] this out as where you hit a a subject
[10:53] that might be a little stumbling to
[10:54] someone. You can't carry it all the way
[10:56] out to make it plain. Then you come back
[10:58] again to catch the next subject. And
[11:00] then later on in the if the Lord
[11:03] willing, we come into the 12 seals not
[11:05] pardon me the 12th chapter of
[11:07] Revelations which lays between the
[11:09] coming of the Lord and the ending of the
[11:11] trumpets and so forth. We'll try to
[11:14] bring that back to show who's Satan and
[11:16] what he did, where he come from, what's
[11:18] his purpose, and how that his great
[11:20] beauty that was given caused his fall,
[11:24] his deceit causes the fall beauty. Then
[11:27] how that the impossibility for any man
[11:30] that wants to look at it, right? That's
[11:32] serpent seed.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; I'd make a challenge to that to anybody
[11:36] see that would want to look at it with
[11:38] with absolutely common understanding. a
[11:42] child can see it thing. Now, we'll get
[11:45] to that later. Now, we understand here
[11:48] that these two scriptures, the reason I
[11:52] read second Peter, the third chapter,
[11:55] and compared it with Revelations 21, um
[11:58] they uh both here are speaking uh uh the
[12:03] same subject, but John never never wrote
[12:08] it out like Peter did. See, we
[12:12] understand that this great home of the
[12:15] bride is to be here on earth.
[12:20] And now if you read just like 21 chap
[12:24] 21st chapter of revelations, the apostle
[12:27] here said or the prophet said that I saw
[12:30] a new heaven and a new earth.
[12:33] Sounds like there comes a annihilation.
[12:38] Now way I always find my messages is by
[12:42] prayer. I'll be sitting in prayer and
[12:45] something reveals to me and I'll wait on
[12:48] a few minutes and see if it's right.
[12:50] Then I feel it closer and then sometimes
[12:54] I keep waiting till it breaks into a
[12:56] vision. But when it begins to come and
[12:59] I'm satisfied it comes from God then I
[13:02] go to the scripture. See that is called
[13:06] to be the confirmation of every
[13:08] spiritual thing that's done because the
[13:10] Bible is the complete revelation of
[13:14] Jesus Christ. It is his body. And now
[13:21] in that maybe I find a place in the
[13:23] scripture that doesn't sound just right.
[13:27] I wonder I go back again to prayer. It
[13:29] comes again.
[13:31] Then I then I begin to to examine my
[13:34] scripture. Now our Bible is wrote in
[13:36] English. In English words change all the
[13:39] time. For instance, like St. John 14
[13:41] said, "In my father's house is many
[13:43] mansions."
[13:44] A mansion in a house.
[13:47] Well, then you what to do with that?
[13:49] Then run it back to the u to the uh
[13:53] original and see what James meant or go
[13:56] back to the Hebrew or to the Greek from
[13:59] the first translation. And in there it
[14:01] says, "In my father's kingdom is many
[14:04] palaces."
[14:05] Well, then you come back to the time
[14:07] that the translators translated for King
[14:10] James, the kingdom was called in English
[14:13] a house. And uh the king was the father
[14:17] over his delegates. There's the reason
[14:20] they translate in my father's house is
[14:23] many mentions. See, and then you get
[14:26] those words and you have to hunt them
[14:28] up. Then you see from that inspiration
[14:31] this pull pit this morning I say not one
[14:33] time has it ever been nothing but
[14:35] straight the scripture
[14:36] &gt;&gt; that's how serpent seed and all these
[14:38] other things come but and it's really if
[14:41] a fellow would just read and say in my
[14:42] father's house many mentions if you
[14:45] didn't stop to study praying you'd be
[14:48] all confused see but just keep praying
[14:52] God always makes it right if it comes
[14:54] from God now John explains means the
[14:58] change and the come how it comes about.
[15:01] He doesn't explain it rather but Peter
[15:03] does. John said, "I saw new heavens and
[15:06] new earth. First heavens and first earth
[15:09] has passed away. There was no more sea.
[15:10] I John saw the holy city coming down
[15:12] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[15:14] bride adored for her husband." But we
[15:17] turn back to second Peter now to find
[15:20] out Peter explains how this process will
[15:23] come about. Now if you look at what John
[15:25] said it sound like for the first heavens
[15:27] and first earth was passed away
[15:30] annihilated see and that sounds very
[15:33] strange. So that's what struck me and I
[15:35] begin to look for the word pass away.
[15:39] And now but it's clear that both of
[15:42] these apostles and prophet were talking
[15:46] of the same thing. And now also in the
[15:49] book of Isaiah now that you want to put
[15:52] these scriptures down in Isaiah 65:17
[15:56] Isaiah speaking of the millennium
[16:00] that thousand years of rest for the for
[16:02] the people of God. Isaiah spoke of it
[16:05] and he said I there was a uh all the
[16:08] former things that passed away and how
[16:10] they'll build houses inhabit them if we
[16:13] had time. Maybe we just take time.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and read this just a minute.
[16:19] Isaiah 65. And let's just read for a few
[16:22] minutes here. And here it is right for
[16:24] us now to begin. Isaiah 65:17.
[16:27] And behold, I create new heavens and a
[16:31] new earth.
[16:34] Now, Isaiah the prophet was one of the
[16:37] prophets that wrote exactly the entire
[16:41] Bible in his prophecy.
[16:43] He starts out with the creation in the
[16:46] middle of his book about the 40th
[16:47] chapter comes around John the Baptist
[16:50] the New Testament and winds up here in
[16:53] his book in the revelations in the
[16:55] millennium. There's 66 books in the
[16:57] Bible and the 66 chapters in Isaiah. He
[17:00] wrote a complete commentary. Now we find
[17:03] out you're now getting the 65th chapter.
[17:06] One more chapter and he speaks of the
[17:09] millennium. Notice it. How beautiful.
[17:13] Behold, I create new heaven and new
[17:16] earth. And the former thing shall not be
[17:19] re remembered or come into mind. It's
[17:24] the pass away. But believe be ye glad
[17:27] and rejoice even in that which I've
[17:29] created. For behold, I create Jerusalem
[17:31] a rejoice
[17:33] and her people a joy. And I will rejoice
[17:36] in Jerusalem and joy in my people. and
[17:39] the voice of weeping shall be no more
[17:40] heard in her for nor the voice of
[17:43] crying. There shall be no more thin
[17:47] infinite days in an old man that is not
[17:49] fulfill his days. For a child shall die
[17:51] 100 years old, and a sinner being a 100
[17:54] years old shall be accused. Then shall
[17:59] and they shall build houses and inhabit
[18:03] them.
[18:04] And they shall plant vineyards and shall
[18:07] eat the fruit of them. And they shall
[18:09] not build and another inhabit. That is
[18:12] your farm. Your son fall heir to it or
[18:15] some of your heirs. They shall not plant
[18:18] and another eat there. They do their own
[18:21] planting and remain there. They got life
[18:23] eternal. For as the days of a tree are
[18:26] the days of my people, and my law my
[18:29] elect shall long enjoy the works of
[18:32] their hands. They shall not labor in
[18:34] vain or bring forth for trouble. For
[18:37] they are the seed of the blessed of the
[18:39] Lord and their offsprings with them. Now
[18:42] I want to share where I'm going to get
[18:43] to while and it shall come to pass that
[18:47] before they call, I will answer.
[18:53] And while they're yet speaking, I'll
[18:55] hear and the wolf and the lamb shall
[18:57] feed together.
[19:00] And the lion shall eat straw like a
[19:02] bulldock. Thus shall be the serpent's
[19:04] beat, and they shall not hurt or
[19:06] destroy, and all my holy mountain,
[19:10] sayeth the Lord.
[19:12] What a promise
[19:14] &gt;&gt; of these prophets and great sages,
[19:17] teachers of the Bible way back in
[19:20] ancient days seeing this glorious day
[19:23] come.
[19:25] By these passages, one might think or be
[19:29] led rather to believe that the whole
[19:32] planet of this earth will be destroyed.
[19:36] I make a new heaven and a new earth.
[19:38] think that the heavens will be gone and
[19:40] the earth will be gone completely
[19:42] annihilated.
[19:44] But a close study and with the help of
[19:47] the Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of
[19:50] this. And that's what we're going into.
[19:55] It is only the atmospheres around it and
[20:00] the sin that's up on the earth that will
[20:02] be destroyed.
[20:04] Now we realize that the heavens means
[20:06] the atmosphere is above.
[20:09] What does it do?
[20:12] It uh then these thistles and sickness
[20:16] and death and politics and sinful man
[20:19] and sinful woman and evil spirits will
[20:22] all be gone away and annihilated.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; It has to be done that way because we
[20:30] are going to live right here. Amen.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; We prove that by the Bible.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Right here's where we live.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Now notice thistles, germs, all of
[20:43] sicknesses and things will be completely
[20:46] uh taken away. All this its existence
[20:50] that's in the earth now, man-made
[20:53] systems, politics,
[20:56] sin, all kinds of evil spirits that the
[20:59] world is contaminated with in all the
[21:01] heavens above us. and your is
[21:03] contaminated with evil spirit.
[21:06] Are we going to go deep and long in
[21:08] this? See, all this exists in the
[21:11] heavens or atmospheres and the earth
[21:14] which is now
[21:17] this earth holds those things.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't made for that purpose. Sin
[21:24] caused it to be like that.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; It was made by God the creator.
[21:31] But all and all of our bodies that we
[21:33] live in now was put on the earth when
[21:36] God created it
[21:38] &gt;&gt; because you're out of the dust of the
[21:39] earth.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; It was all laid out here. When God
[21:43] himself created, you were in his
[21:46] thinking
[21:47] &gt;&gt; and in him the great eternal was the
[21:50] thought which is his attribute.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; And now sin caused all this to happen.
[21:57] And God through this age is gathering up
[22:00] his material.
[22:02] Satan is still here. That's the reason
[22:04] all these things happen. He's still
[22:06] here. And all of his evil forces are
[22:09] still here. Notice that's why the earth
[22:13] now is so filthy.
[22:16] That's why the scum and ridiculous
[22:18] things that goes on, bloodshed, war,
[22:22] politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of
[22:24] filthiness goes on is because that Satan
[22:27] is the ruler of this earth and this
[22:31] atmosphere.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; I say the atma. Yes, sir.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Both the heavens and earth now is
[22:38] contaminated with devils
[22:40] &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God.
[22:43] Jesus is there to intercede for us.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; See, while the accusers keep pointing a
[22:49] finger, they did this, they did this,
[22:51] they did this, but the blood still
[22:53] covers.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that elected that he
[22:58] foresaw.
[22:59] That's why it's so filthy today.
[23:21] [Music]
[23:33] [Music]
[23:39] [Music]

[52:04] and Savior this morning, Lord, that
[52:05] you'd do that. We do we can do that
[52:08] humbly but also boldly, Lord, because

[1:02:25] pastoring there for 50 years. Big huge
[1:02:28] huge ministry.
[1:02:30] Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise.
[1:02:33] Amen. Yes.
[1:02:38] Give honor where honor is due. and um we
[1:02:42] were invited to be a part I've met him
[1:02:44] many years ago. He was a representative
[1:02:47] for the voice of God there in Colombia
[1:02:49] for some time. And um this last time I
[1:02:53] was at brother Caleb Pettis's church, he
[1:02:56] was there with his wife and he felt it
[1:02:58] on his heart to invite us to come. And
[1:03:01] so um I went there along with brother
[1:03:04] Mark Castillo and brother Caleb Pettis
[1:03:07] and Tommy Pettis Jr. They had a
[1:03:09] wonderful time and they really it was
[1:03:12] quite a um just give you a brief report.
[1:03:15] Are the Sunday school kids inside?
[1:03:17] They're here. So, I brought back some
[1:03:19] candy for the Sunday school kids. All
[1:03:21] right. So, that's important. Get that
[1:03:24] out there. It's in a little brown bag.
[1:03:27] I'm not going to give it to you. I'm
[1:03:28] going to give it to whoever's in.
[1:03:30] Brother Joe will take it from there and
[1:03:32] give it to whoever. And their candy is a
[1:03:35] little different. So, um just it's free,
[1:03:39] so
[1:03:41] no complaints.
[1:03:43] And um but we had a wonderful time. It
[1:03:46] was very well organized. It was over
[1:03:49] 4,000 believers.
[1:03:51] Uh they came to this great convention.
[1:03:53] His church is a huge massive building.
[1:03:56] If the Lord pro permits, we'll bring
[1:03:59] some pictures for you. but they will um
[1:04:03] take over a hotel for the international
[1:04:07] guest and then there's several hotels
[1:04:09] that they'll negotiate months and months
[1:04:11] in advance for the the the guests from
[1:04:15] the country of Colombia. coming from all
[1:04:18] over and then other countries like Peru,
[1:04:21] Ecuador, Panama,
[1:04:25] um even uh I think from the of course
[1:04:28] from the US and other places. I saw
[1:04:32] brother Dan Daniel Martin there. Um big
[1:04:36] big
[1:04:38] really well done. I learned so much. I
[1:04:41] was so blessed to be a part of it. and
[1:04:43] they will send these great buses to
[1:04:48] charter you from the uh hotel to the
[1:04:52] church grounds. And that bus leaves at
[1:04:54] 7:00 in the morning and there's eight or
[1:04:57] 10 of those huge massive buses. Well,
[1:05:01] comfort um the traffic there. Colombia
[1:05:04] doesn't have any freeways. The traffic
[1:05:06] is horrible
[1:05:08] and the the meetings are like from here
[1:05:11] to Cassag Grand. So that could be one
[1:05:13] hour or two and a half hours. Just
[1:05:16] depends on the traffic. And so they had
[1:05:18] it structured. The breakfast was
[1:05:19] included. It's really early at 6:00 a.m.
[1:05:23] And so and it leaves at 7 and I'm not
[1:05:26] driving. So we had to be there if we
[1:05:30] want to be on time. It's different. If I
[1:05:33] was driving, we would be late. But
[1:05:36] but the bus is on time and beautiful
[1:05:39] nice breakfast laid out. And then you
[1:05:41] get on that bus and they drive you to
[1:05:43] this um to the tabernacle there of
[1:05:47] Columbia and they have you seated and
[1:05:50] the deacons all in order and the music
[1:05:52] was just really tremendous just
[1:05:55] beautiful. They have a 45 minute speaker
[1:05:59] in the morning
[1:06:01] and then they have two speakers each
[1:06:03] morning. So, Friday morning, 45 minutes
[1:06:06] with an interpreter, a few songs, and
[1:06:09] then a next speaker for 45 minutes, and
[1:06:12] then they break for about a three-hour
[1:06:14] lunch. and that uh on the grounds there,
[1:06:18] there's a a restaurant that's built
[1:06:20] there on the grounds. And then vendors
[1:06:23] from all over the country would be
[1:06:27] selling their national foods and street
[1:06:30] foods and hamburgers and sweets and
[1:06:33] whatever, soups, whatever you wanted.
[1:06:36] And then the the different meats and it
[1:06:38] was just really well done. You didn't
[1:06:41] have to leave. Um and then that was
[1:06:44] about 3 hours. Then you come back for
[1:06:46] the evening service, 45 minute preacher
[1:06:50] uh with an interpreter and then another
[1:06:52] 45 minute speaker. I spoke on a Friday
[1:06:55] and the Lord blessed the all of the
[1:06:58] services were very nice. Um, but with
[1:07:02] that schedule will tear tire you out a
[1:07:05] bit and we were going going going and on
[1:07:09] our way back I got a little symptoms of
[1:07:12] a cold or something and then I was fine
[1:07:16] traveling and when I got here I spoke
[1:07:18] here on Wednesday I struggled through it
[1:07:21] and then it seemed like it just got
[1:07:22] worse Thursday, Friday and uh but the
[1:07:26] Lord pulled me out of it pulling me out
[1:07:28] of it and so I'm so glad to be here with
[1:07:29] you
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; and it's Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:36] And um we have always have beautiful
[1:07:39] help, beautiful help in the ministry and
[1:07:43] I was so confident in having our brother
[1:07:45] Jonathan Davis minister for us while I
[1:07:48] was gone.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; I was really blessed. Don't you love
[1:07:51] him?
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Just one of us, one of our people. Now,
[1:07:55] I don't believe in proceliting, but if I
[1:07:57] did,
[1:08:00] I shouldn't even tease that way, but
[1:08:02] he's just one of us. He's an assistant
[1:08:05] pastor up there, and we love Brother Ike
[1:08:07] and the saints up there, and I streamed
[1:08:09] those services. And and we put John,
[1:08:12] Brother Jonathan, to work when he came.
[1:08:15] And so, Thursday night, he spoke down in
[1:08:17] in Mesa. I'm I'm going to sit down in
[1:08:20] just a moment. I'm introduce our
[1:08:22] speaker. He spoke in Mesa, did a
[1:08:24] wonderful job, and then he spoke here
[1:08:26] Sunday, and he thought he was going to
[1:08:28] leave
[1:08:30] Sunday night off. So, I pulled on him. I
[1:08:33] said, "Come on, Brother John. You come
[1:08:34] this far. We want to squeeze everything
[1:08:37] out of you." And so, he said, "Let me
[1:08:39] see what I can do with I with my
[1:08:41] ticket." And he he he changed his ticket
[1:08:43] around. I'm so glad he did. I appreciate
[1:08:46] ministers. They're here to serve. And he
[1:08:49] just has that heart of doing what he can
[1:08:52] to help. and serve. I can sit and listen
[1:08:55] to him preach because of his life and
[1:08:58] the way he gives and serves. Amen. And I
[1:09:00] appreciate Brother Jonathan Davis and
[1:09:03] all of the saints and the elders,
[1:09:05] brother Joe, that were here to keep um
[1:09:09] the doors open and a place for the
[1:09:11] saints to come and worship the Lord. And
[1:09:15] um and so we we made it back. And as we
[1:09:19] look forward to our meetings in
[1:09:21] November, I have a a theme that I
[1:09:24] thought would be appropriate. The power
[1:09:27] to be sons of God. That's the theme. The
[1:09:30] power to be sons of God. And those
[1:09:34] meetings will start in November the
[1:09:35] 13th. That Thursday seems like this last
[1:09:39] year we just added something for the
[1:09:40] youth. That Thursday will be a youth
[1:09:43] service at the Robson's. The Lord
[1:09:45] willing. This is all tentative. We're
[1:09:47] still putting it together. And then
[1:09:50] Friday service, Friday night service, a
[1:09:53] Saturday morning service, a Saturday
[1:09:56] evening service,
[1:09:58] one service Sunday morning, and then
[1:10:02] Sunday evening, if the Lord permit,
[1:10:03] we'll just have a worship or a singing
[1:10:05] service. That's the plan. Um, food will
[1:10:09] be provided at at whatever appropriate
[1:10:13] services more announcements will come. I
[1:10:15] just wanted to lay that out there to you
[1:10:18] so you can begin to pray for those
[1:10:20] meetings. Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; And um um the power to be sons of God.
[1:10:26] And now I was so sad that we were gone
[1:10:29] during the the the homegoing service for
[1:10:33] Mother Wheeler. Waver Wheeler has gone
[1:10:36] on to get her reward and we uh
[1:10:39] appreciate her. And I was looking in the
[1:10:42] um
[1:10:44] uh the bulletin here. Her birthday was
[1:10:46] August the 20th
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; and her memorial service was on the
[1:10:51] 15th, I believe. So she had her birthday
[1:10:54] over there.
[1:10:56] And um a land where she'll never grow
[1:10:59] old again. And so we um just appreciate
[1:11:03] her. Um, I would, uh, go and serve her
[1:11:09] communion. In her later years, we would
[1:11:12] go there on Sunday afternoon, her and
[1:11:15] Sister Jackie. They would want to know,
[1:11:18] are we having communion? And they would
[1:11:20] let me know if it was if if if they were
[1:11:24] if she was strong enough to have it. But
[1:11:26] it was always her desire to take the
[1:11:28] Lord's supper when the saints took it.
[1:11:31] And so we did that many, many times for
[1:11:34] her. She would um weep. I would sing one
[1:11:38] hymn, maybe Amazing Grace, just me, her,
[1:11:42] my mother, and Jackie Wheeler and bless
[1:11:45] the wine and serve that in her little
[1:11:48] den there. And she would perk up and
[1:11:50] just just be blessed to follow the word
[1:11:54] of the Lord. And she'd say, "I don't
[1:11:56] know why I'm still here, Brother Bo."
[1:11:59] She'd always say that with her little
[1:12:01] sweet self. And I said, "You're really
[1:12:03] an encouragement, Mother Wheeler. If you
[1:12:05] can pray for somebody, pray for me. Pray
[1:12:08] for us." And uh so she's gone on to get
[1:12:12] her reward. We much respects to her and
[1:12:16] the family. I know many of them are
[1:12:18] traveling, Sister Carlina and them. But
[1:12:22] um we appreciate Mother Wheeler. So, I
[1:12:24] wanted to take some time to because I
[1:12:26] couldn't do it on at her service there,
[1:12:30] but I did that this morning. How many
[1:12:34] knew Mother Wheeler? Waver Wheeler. Uh,
[1:12:37] yes. Beautiful,
[1:12:40] lovely
[1:12:41] 90. How old was she, Brother Caleb?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; 908.
[1:12:50] So,
[1:12:52] Praise the Lord. Will you be taking
[1:12:54] communion when you're 98?
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm going to last
[1:13:00] either, but if I do last that long, I
[1:13:03] like to believe somebody would serve it
[1:13:06] to me. Amen. And so,
[1:13:10] as we prepare for the service tonight,
[1:13:12] like I said, beautiful, help, lovely
[1:13:15] friends in the ministry. And so, Sister
[1:13:18] Amanda, she um I call her Sister Amanda.
[1:13:22] She's um Sister Sheila. How is she
[1:13:25] related to you? She's your niece.
[1:13:28] She's your niece. And she was the home
[1:13:31] care giver for your grandmother, which
[1:13:36] is sister
[1:13:38] Sister Lucille. What was her last name?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Sister Lucille McCoy. How many of you
[1:13:43] know her? She went home to get her
[1:13:46] reward this year and she would stream
[1:13:48] the services she was on. And if it
[1:13:50] wasn't on, she would want to know why.
[1:13:52] Sister Amanda, it's her home care. I
[1:13:55] don't think she's ever been to our
[1:13:56] service. But when we went to do her her
[1:14:00] services and I think I served her
[1:14:02] communion once, too. She's always very
[1:14:05] warm. But she made this little plaque
[1:14:07] here. And
[1:14:10] Amanda Clark from the McCoy family. And
[1:14:14] it says, "Shalom tabernacle, wings of a
[1:14:16] dove. Pastor Israel Poe." And um that
[1:14:21] really blessed me. So I thank the Lord
[1:14:24] for that. And so I want to tell her
[1:14:26] thank you and tell her she can continue
[1:14:29] to stream.
[1:14:31] I hope she's streaming right now. Thank
[1:14:34] you, sister Amanda, wherever you may be.
[1:14:36] Uh I call that friends to the ministry.
[1:14:39] Friends to the ministry. And we're
[1:14:40] always looking for friends to the
[1:14:42] ministry. We got the other side covered.
[1:14:46] We want more friends. Amen. So, thank
[1:14:49] you, Sister Amanda, for that and uh
[1:14:52] little little tokens that help encourage
[1:14:54] us along the way. And so, God bless each
[1:14:57] of you. Now, this morning, we have a
[1:15:00] dear friend, Brother Joseph Alu.
[1:15:05] Yes. And Alfame, I thought Joseph was
[1:15:09] his first name, but he was with Stand
[1:15:12] up, Brother Joseph, just for a moment.
[1:15:13] Just stand.
[1:15:16] Okay. All right. How many remember him?
[1:15:18] Sorry. Have be seated. Thank you. How
[1:15:21] many remember him?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; You remember him? He spoke for us in
[1:15:26] 2017.
[1:15:29] Very short service. He did our Sunday
[1:15:31] school, our adult Sunday school. And
[1:15:34] then we whipped him out of there and
[1:15:36] brother
[1:15:38] Peterson Al Peterson took him up to um
[1:15:43] his son-in-law's place there. brother
[1:15:46] brother Mark Stroke Corp's place and
[1:15:48] then he went and spoke for him and he
[1:15:51] didn't know brother Peterson had crossed
[1:15:53] over to get his reward. So I was trying
[1:15:56] to remember because I knew he was with
[1:15:58] us but not for the Sunday service and we
[1:16:00] and I try to spread the brothers out
[1:16:02] when they come and try to make them feel
[1:16:04] welcome. You don't know what it's like
[1:16:06] going to a foreign country and then oh
[1:16:09] it's just so nice when people open their
[1:16:12] arms to you. And so I try to return that
[1:16:15] when brothers come and brother Joseph he
[1:16:18] he uh over the years we've stayed in
[1:16:20] contact with WhatsApp WhatsApp or
[1:16:22] however you say it. And he's he was back
[1:16:25] here I guess once before he couldn't
[1:16:27] come but he was back with us. This is a
[1:16:29] perfect time because when I was in
[1:16:31] Colombia
[1:16:32] um returning back, he was able to go to
[1:16:37] the services there in Mesa and to some
[1:16:41] of our friends in the Phoenix area,
[1:16:43] brother Armando
[1:16:45] and uh Jericho Tabernacle.
[1:16:49] And so we appreciate that. Those are
[1:16:52] brothers that I call on and other
[1:16:55] visiting pastors come. I know we're all
[1:16:58] busy, but when they come here from
[1:17:00] another country, they really appreciate
[1:17:05] coming to see where the prophet went.
[1:17:07] And he was so appreciative to even stand
[1:17:10] at brother Carpenter's church. He said,
[1:17:12] "I I don't even know if I can even
[1:17:14] preach here." Brother Brandon preached
[1:17:16] here. It's just a reverence and a
[1:17:19] respect. And so these are our brothers.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I'm very busy, but I could stop my
[1:17:24] schedule. I could try to and help
[1:17:27] accommodate some of our brothers when
[1:17:29] they come. And so, um, he's here with us
[1:17:32] today and it gives me a chance to relax
[1:17:34] and hear some good preaching as well and
[1:17:37] get my strength back, the Lord willing.
[1:17:39] And then Pastor Brother Armando will be
[1:17:41] with us this evening. He's going to pick
[1:17:43] him up and bring him back. And so, I
[1:17:47] took a little bit of time, but I'm so
[1:17:50] glad to be home and just wanted to
[1:17:52] welcome each of you. Amen. To the house
[1:17:55] of the Lord. So let's stand to our feet.
[1:17:58] Uh brother Joseph is a pastor there in
[1:18:02] Nigeria. Is it Legos?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Delta.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; A
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; in the Delta. And it's an
[1:18:12] English-speaking country, but they're
[1:18:14] phrasing might you you'll catch them
[1:18:16] what he's saying. It's And I know the
[1:18:18] Lord will bless you richly. And as he
[1:18:21] prepares to come, let's sing the old
[1:18:25] hymn of the church, Amazing Grace.
[1:18:48] I
[1:18:50] [Music]
[1:18:54] was
[1:18:56] was lost,
[1:18:59] but now
[1:19:02] I'm found.
[1:19:05] I was blind,
[1:19:07] but
[1:19:10] I see
[1:19:13] through men
[1:19:16] he dare
[1:19:18] curse to
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:22] stare.
[1:19:24] I have
[1:19:27] already
[1:19:30] become.
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:35] His grace
[1:19:38] has brought
[1:19:41] me safe
[1:19:46] and his grace
[1:19:49] will lead.
[1:19:51] It'll lead me home.
[1:19:54] Praise God.
[1:19:57] Praise God.
[1:19:59] Praise God. Oh Lord, you're worthy to be
[1:20:02] praised.
[1:20:05] Oh God, we praise you with all of our
[1:20:09] heart, all of our life, all of our
[1:20:12] strength. Lord, we give you the praise.
[1:20:16] You're worthy.
[1:20:19] Praise God.
[1:20:21] Praise God.
[1:20:24] Praise God.
[1:20:27] Praise God.
[1:20:29] Praise God.
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:35] Amen.
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray one more time?
[1:20:44] Almighty God,
[1:20:47] we are your children,
[1:20:50] a chosen generation. Dear father, a holy
[1:20:54] nation, a royal priesthood,
[1:20:57] predestinated
[1:21:00] to the service of the almighty God
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; in this age wherein we live.
[1:21:06] And father, you give us a prophet
[1:21:10] with a message divine from heaven.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Lord God, not a dead message. Father,
[1:21:17] you vindicated it beyond doubt.
[1:21:22] Now the mouth of critics were shot
[1:21:26] because of the innumerable vindication
[1:21:29] and proof
[1:21:31] and father of light is around that
[1:21:33] article that we are gathered again this
[1:21:37] morning and we trust in you father. Lord

[1:22:22] and bring it to healing. Touch the soul
[1:22:25] also, dear God. There be anything in our
[1:22:28] midst that is contrary to your will. We
[1:22:31] pray for mercy and pardon that you
[1:22:33] forgive us in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:22:36] Unto thee Lord we hand over this meeting
[1:22:39] in Christ Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:22:44] God bless you. Be seated for a while.
[1:22:49] We
[1:22:50] welcome us again
[1:22:53] to the church in the name of the Lord
[1:22:54] Jesus Christ.
[1:22:57] Amen.
[1:22:59] God bless you.
[1:23:01] I say God bless you.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Please give me some volume so that they
[1:23:05] will hear me.
[1:23:08] Hallelujah.
[1:23:10] All right. So I'm brother Olufame
[1:23:12] Joseph.
[1:23:14] is my first name while Joseph is my last
[1:23:17] name. what we call surname you know back
[1:23:21] home and um I pastor a church in Nigeria
[1:23:26] Salem Tabernacle
[1:23:28] that's the name of the church I pastor
[1:23:31] and I think this year makes me exactly
[1:23:33] 30 years as a pastor of that church
[1:23:37] though people say I look younger than my
[1:23:40] age
[1:23:41] and yesterday happened to be my birthday
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I was 54 years yesterday.
[1:23:49] Amen.
[1:23:50] God bless you.
[1:23:53] And I want to appreciate brother Israel.
[1:23:56] I don't know whether he's hearing me. I
[1:23:59] got to know him that uh year 2017
[1:24:03] and it's been so warm and kind and um
[1:24:07] especially this my visit
[1:24:10] and um I appreciate him so well and um
[1:24:16] you know humility must go with a
[1:24:19] ministry
[1:24:21] right kindness must go with a ministry
[1:24:25] and um I see him as someone that
[1:24:28] consider others
[1:24:30] and put others uh in front and I pray
[1:24:35] that God will bless him.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He was to come to Phoenix to see me on
[1:24:40] Thursday I think and I told him he
[1:24:42] should not bother that I was good. I was
[1:24:45] in the hand of good people. He just
[1:24:48] returned from Colombia and to be uh to
[1:24:52] stress himself again to come down maybe
[1:24:54] a little bit difficult but I'm grateful
[1:24:57] to God that we happen to meet again at
[1:25:01] this side of eternity
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; and uh he was in Liberia was it this
[1:25:06] year? this year, right?
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; He visited Liberia and um he happened to
[1:25:11] preach with my younger brother
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; in the convention and that seems to
[1:25:16] further seal our bonds tighter and
[1:25:19] stronger than ever.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; My younger brother preaches also. I
[1:25:25] don't know why. And uh one of my
[1:25:28] children also preaches this message.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; So we are grateful to God. We had a
[1:25:34] father that was very prayerful.
[1:25:37] My father was very very prayerful though
[1:25:40] he was not exactly of the message but he
[1:25:44] got baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:25:45] Jesus Christ before you know he passed
[1:25:49] and I believe I'll see him one of these
[1:25:52] days.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; So and I believe and trust that you love
[1:25:56] your pastor.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; You love your pastor.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Is this amen so resounding? Is yes
[1:26:06] resound. You love your pastor.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; If you don't love him, we take him to
[1:26:11] Africa.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, God bless you. I
[1:26:18] appreciate the man of God. It takes a
[1:26:20] lot to watch over your soul. It takes a
[1:26:25] lot to watch over your welfare.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; This is America.
[1:26:29] But the message of the hour is God's
[1:26:33] program. Right?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; You right.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; And that is what God has ordained to
[1:26:38] lead you to lead me.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I was saying somewhere was it on Friday
[1:26:43] in a church. I said God is so particular
[1:26:47] about how we live that you look at it in
[1:26:50] the Old Testament
[1:26:53] with the children of Israel in the
[1:26:55] wilderness.
[1:26:56] Even how they were to use the bathroom,
[1:27:00] God instructed them about it.
[1:27:04] As insignificant as that,
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; God told them how to behave
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; when they went to the bathroom in the
[1:27:11] You understand what I'm talking about?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Our hygiene, you know, minute
[1:27:16] insignificant things about our life,
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; God is interested.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Even your animals, your pets,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; your chicken, your hen, brotherham say
[1:27:27] God is interested and he love to make us
[1:27:30] happy. Praise the Lord.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; So you love the man of God. Thanks be to
[1:27:36] God that you have this church. That was
[1:27:38] not where I met you in 2017.
[1:27:41] And I know in America is mostly
[1:27:43] mortgage, mortgage, mortgage. So don't
[1:27:46] leave it to your pastor. That is where
[1:27:49] you come to worship God. Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; It's also your house is the house of God
[1:27:55] where we meet to worship him. Where you
[1:27:58] get your spiritual bread. So don't leave
[1:28:01] it to the pastor. Don't leave it to the
[1:28:02] trustees. You do the best you can also
[1:28:06] to make sure that the mortgage is paid
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; so that the government or the bank will
[1:28:11] not come and send you out of this place
[1:28:14] because you default in meeting with your
[1:28:16] financial obligations and God almighty
[1:28:19] will bless you abundantly.
[1:28:22] Amen. So God bless you. God bless the
[1:28:26] pastor's wife also and the family the
[1:28:28] deacons the trustees and every member of
[1:28:31] this assembly god richly bless you
[1:28:34] greetings from my family my wife send
[1:28:37] greetings and the church of the living
[1:28:40] God a friend of mine is also in he's
[1:28:42] preaching in uh Maryland this morning
[1:28:45] brother Gideon is his name greetings
[1:28:47] from him so God bless you uh time is
[1:28:51] actually gone and um 45 minutes
[1:28:54] remaining to speak and I have a sermon
[1:28:56] that could take up to three hours. So I
[1:28:59] trust the Lord to really condense it for
[1:29:01] us. Shall we stand on our feet for the
[1:29:05] reading of the scriptures?
[1:29:07] God bless you.
[1:29:10] Let's go to the book of um Genesis
[1:29:15] chapter 15.
[1:29:17] Genesis
[1:29:19] chapter 15.
[1:29:25] Genesis 15 verse 5 first. Genesis 15:E5.
[1:29:33] We pray again. Dear Jesus, help us as we
[1:29:37] go through the scriptures. Be the
[1:29:39] speaker, be the hearer, and be the doer
[1:29:41] of the word. May the word prosper in our
[1:29:44] midst this morning, this day. In Jesus
[1:29:47] Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[1:29:50] Genesis 15:5 says,
[1:29:53] "And he brought him forth abroad and
[1:29:56] said, look now toward heaven
[1:30:00] until the stars either be able to number
[1:30:03] them." And he said unto him, "So shall
[1:30:06] thy seat be seated." We still read
[1:30:08] another scripture. You can have your
[1:30:10] seat. Thank you.
[1:30:14] You see God comparing
[1:30:17] the seed of Abraham with the stars of
[1:30:20] heaven.
[1:30:21] Hallelujah.
[1:30:23] Now let's go to Matthew chapter uh 2.
[1:30:27] Matthew chapter 2.
[1:30:30] Matthew the 2 chapter
[1:30:33] from verse 9 to 111.
[1:30:35] Matthew 2 9-11.
[1:30:38] The Bible also says
[1:30:42] when they had heard the king they
[1:30:44] departed and lo the star which they saw
[1:30:47] in the east went before them till you
[1:30:50] see it's still talking about star.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah. Abraham said compared to
[1:30:54] star here the wise men saw a star
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; and they follow that you know to where
[1:31:00] the infant Jesus was. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:04] So star has a lot to do with us. Amen.
[1:31:08] Now we have a lot to do with stars and
[1:31:11] um right so till it came and stood over
[1:31:14] where the young child was. They saw this
[1:31:17] star two years earlier. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:20] About the birth of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:22] Christ. So by the time they could get to
[1:31:24] where Jesus was, he was already an
[1:31:26] infant, a young child.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they they they bowed
[1:31:32] down and they worshiped him. And the
[1:31:35] Bible called them wise men. It shows
[1:31:38] that that infant child was a great man.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; He was an important somebody.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You see these were not novice. These
[1:31:48] were not plebbeians,
[1:31:49] right? These were learned men. The Bible
[1:31:53] say wise men.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And when they got to, you know, about a
[1:31:57] two year old boy, they bow and they
[1:31:59] worship him.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; He showed that something was about that
[1:32:02] child. Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; So, and um uh the young child will marry
[1:32:10] his mother and fell and worshiped him.
[1:32:12] And when they had opened their
[1:32:14] treasures, they presented unto him
[1:32:16] gifts, gold, and frankincense and marr.
[1:32:20] And being one of God in a dream that
[1:32:22] they should uh not return to Herod, they
[1:32:26] departed into their country, into their
[1:32:28] own country another way. God bless you.
[1:32:32] Isaiah chapter 21 verse 11. Isaiah
[1:32:35] 21:11.
[1:32:37] The Bible also says Isaiah 21 verse 11.
[1:32:43] It also says the boarding or duma he
[1:32:47] called unto me. He called to me sir.
[1:32:50] Watchman word of the night. Watchman
[1:32:53] word of the night. The watchman said the
[1:32:55] morning cometh and also the night. If
[1:32:58] you will inquire, inquire ye return.
[1:33:01] Come. May the Lord bless the reading of
[1:33:04] his word in Christ Jesus name.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So we just want to
[1:33:08] remind us about this little thought. We
[1:33:12] of course this is America and you have
[1:33:13] access to those information before us
[1:33:16] maybe in Africa. February 28 this year
[1:33:19] something spectacular took place. Right?
[1:33:23] There was a planetary alignment on earth
[1:33:26] that science announced. News medias
[1:33:29] announced it was predicted before it
[1:33:32] took place. I heard it before it
[1:33:34] happened and eventually it happened. So
[1:33:37] seven planet aligned with the earth
[1:33:40] which has a significance to us
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; the bride of the lord Jesus Christ. So
[1:33:46] that is what I want to talk on this
[1:33:47] morning by the grace of god. No I don't
[1:33:49] need this yet. Maybe if you type the
[1:33:51] title that's all you should project the
[1:33:53] significance to the planetary alignment
[1:33:57] of
[1:33:58] February 28,
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; 2025
[1:34:03] there was a planetary alignment. Now we
[1:34:05] just as much as you can brother Brham
[1:34:08] said we are living in a time when the
[1:34:10] handwriting is written on time.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the handwriting is
[1:34:18] written in disguise. It's written over
[1:34:20] the face of the earth. It's written in
[1:34:22] every newspaper. The handwriting was on
[1:34:24] the wall for a nation. But today the
[1:34:26] handwriting is on the wall for time.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And writing is in disguise.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now brother Brandham
[1:34:35] said God wrote three Bibles.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; The first one was the zodiac.
[1:34:43] And
[1:34:44] if
[1:34:46] it's a Bible, God can still refer to it
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; and speak to us from there
[1:34:54] as much as he also speaks to us from
[1:34:57] this.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But whatever he's telling us through the
[1:35:03] planetary bodies, which is the first
[1:35:06] Bible, must tally with this.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; There must be no contradiction.
[1:35:11] I hope you are hearing me.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Pastor, if you feel
[1:35:15] they don't hear, just raise your hand.
[1:35:16] I'm sorry for giving you the assignment
[1:35:18] so that I will repeat myself again.
[1:35:22] Praise the Lord. We speak English, but
[1:35:24] you know somehow.
[1:35:27] So God wrote three Bibles. The first was
[1:35:29] the zodiac. The second was the pyramid
[1:35:33] in Egypt. And the third is this one on
[1:35:35] paper. Brother said, "What happened?" He
[1:35:39] said, you know, at the creation, Moses
[1:35:42] wrote the book of Genesis
[1:35:44] and Moses started from Genesis 1:1, but
[1:35:49] brother Ron started before Genesis 1:1.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:56] Now we the logos came out of God
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; and he said let there be
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and there was the prophecy as he said as
[1:36:08] he said let there be the prophecy an
[1:36:10] atom came forth
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; right and he said it blaz a well a well
[1:36:17] a well wh i r l a well he said then god
[1:36:22] stopped it and he said a star flew off
[1:36:26] of that.
[1:36:28] He said, "What was God doing?" And he
[1:36:30] said the stars, he said he caused it, he
[1:36:32] allowed to fall for millions of years
[1:36:35] and then he said God stopped it. He said
[1:36:37] another clicker flew off of the sun.
[1:36:40] Hallelujah. He allowed to draw for
[1:36:43] millions of years and then he stopped
[1:36:45] it. The prophet said, "What was God
[1:36:46] doing?" He said he was writing his first
[1:36:49] Bible
[1:36:51] which is his zodiac. And the first sign
[1:36:54] in the zodiac is Virgo.
[1:36:57] And he came through the virgin birth in
[1:36:58] his first coming. The last sign in the
[1:37:01] zodiac is Leo the lion.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's coming the second
[1:37:06] time as a lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Is that not the scriptures?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So the
[1:37:12] first Bible, the first sign is a Virgo.
[1:37:15] The last one is Leo. Complete Bible. And
[1:37:18] the prover said every age is shown in
[1:37:21] the zodiac including this one which is
[1:37:24] the cross fishes of the cancer's age
[1:37:27] which is loudia church age.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the lord. So those are the three
[1:37:31] bibles that go wrote and it can still
[1:37:33] refer to any of them to speak to us. Job
[1:37:36] they read the zodiac. That was the Bible
[1:37:38] that Job and his generation read.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Enoch was the pyramid of Egypt. That was
[1:37:43] their Bible. But today thanks be to God
[1:37:45] we have this.
[1:37:47] Hallelujah. And it's easily accessible.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Before you can read the stars, I think
[1:37:52] you must have some talent of some sort.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Before you can see the stars, maybe the
[1:37:58] angle of inclination is this way or the
[1:38:01] tilt this way. It means something
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; to astrologers,
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; to a prophet. But to lay men like us,
[1:38:09] what do we make out of it? Nothing. But
[1:38:12] we are grateful to God for a prophet
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; with a deep prophetic insight
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; into the Bible.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; And is here in your city that seven
[1:38:23] angels came from eternity right
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; in Christ the covenant angel not in his
[1:38:28] corporal body
[1:38:30] to fulfill the scriptures revelation
[1:38:32] chapter 10. So now as to fudge ahead we
[1:38:36] uh brother also taught us that God first
[1:38:39] of all shows his major events in the
[1:38:43] heavens before he declared them on the
[1:38:46] earth.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; And friends we are so important
[1:38:52] the brand of Christ so important but
[1:38:55] sometime we don't even realize it.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; We see ourselves as commoners.
[1:39:01] If guy is not taking I think I can calm
[1:39:03] down. If guy is not taking church he
[1:39:07] will value your citizenship as an
[1:39:09] American better than being a child of
[1:39:12] God.
[1:39:14] If is not taking you will be more
[1:39:16] conscious of you being an American
[1:39:19] citizen than you being a son of the
[1:39:21] living God.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You sang a song here if I got it well.
[1:39:25] I'm glad to be part of his family.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Me become a revelation to us. Amen.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And if it becomes a revelation, you
[1:39:34] being an American citizen will be so
[1:39:35] secondary to you.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Because God will destroy America.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; God will destroy Africa. Australia will
[1:39:42] be this entire world will be destroyed.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Because there's coming a kingdom
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; that can never be destroyed.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So we are
[1:39:53] so important
[1:39:55] that before certain event takes place
[1:39:59] about the bride heavenly bodies has to
[1:40:01] declare it.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Now I just have to quote this just show
[1:40:06] God show his major event in the heavens
[1:40:08] before he declared them on the earth.
[1:40:10] And um of course you know brother
[1:40:12] Brandon preached the seven church ages
[1:40:14] in Jeffersonville. And while he was
[1:40:16] teaching on this last church age, the
[1:40:18] Ludician church age, remember the pillar
[1:40:20] of fire came and drew the condition of
[1:40:22] the edges at the back of the tabernacle.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; The exact way he drew it on the board,
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; right? And in 1964, shortly before the
[1:40:30] pope of Rome made his way to Israel.
[1:40:33] Remember the heavenly body, God used the
[1:40:35] moon is part of the zodiac. He's part of
[1:40:38] the planetary body. God used the moon to
[1:40:41] declare the state of the church.
[1:40:44] Six ages the I mean scientists the
[1:40:46] pictures could pick it but the seventh
[1:40:48] age was total darkness
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; and camera is not used to darkness so
[1:40:53] it's not it showed nothing but something
[1:40:56] was there because church age has
[1:40:59] rejected the word
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; and the crowd they rejected according to
[1:41:02] revelation 3:14 is the message of the
[1:41:05] hour
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; it's not what Jesus in the air or in
[1:41:09] heaven what ladia rejected what they
[1:41:12] push out of the church is this message,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; not something else.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we Yeah, that
[1:41:20] happened. Of course, you know the
[1:41:22] rainbow, I mean the ring-shaped cloud,
[1:41:25] how God after the angels left the
[1:41:28] prophet, then they were returning, he
[1:41:30] drew it. He showed those things in the
[1:41:32] sky. Give me the first code. 6 64830mm.
[1:41:36] Hallelujah. 6430
[1:41:41] 0830mm.
[1:41:42] Now I think I will quote it because of
[1:41:44] our time. Brother Bronham said in this
[1:41:47] see if they could feature it on the
[1:41:48] screen 94 96 brotherham says that in CO
[1:41:54] that you are born
[1:41:57] under a certain star.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yes
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; in a certain month. Mine is August yours
[1:42:04] may be January. It means something
[1:42:08] brother. Heaven is in charge of the
[1:42:11] earth.
[1:42:13] Nothing just happened for happiness
[1:42:15] sake.
[1:42:17] Heaven is in charge.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Now if there's no influence from any
[1:42:24] other power, you leave this pit here,
[1:42:27] you come back after 100 years, you miss
[1:42:30] it, you meet it exactly the way you left
[1:42:32] it.
[1:42:33] But if you leave this pit after 20
[1:42:36] years, you are not coming back to meet
[1:42:38] it the way it is today.
[1:42:40] He showed us an influence from somewhere
[1:42:43] because he will tear down.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; If there's no influence from somewhere,
[1:42:49] you will have remained the exact way is
[1:42:51] made.
[1:42:54] So heaven is in charge of the earth. I'm
[1:42:56] waiting for the quote. So you were born
[1:43:00] under a certain star in a certain month
[1:43:04] under certain something that has
[1:43:06] something to do with you. This is it.
[1:43:09] And this person that's in you which is
[1:43:11] your birth. You are John Doe for
[1:43:12] example. You say you were born in a
[1:43:15] certain month and you were born under a
[1:43:18] certain star. You were born under a
[1:43:21] certain thing and that has something to
[1:43:24] do what to do with you. Certainly does.
[1:43:28] Praise the Lord. I know papa used to say
[1:43:31] that uh brother Ron said the father told
[1:43:34] him that he could not plant potatoes
[1:43:38] in the dark of the moon. That is when
[1:43:39] the moon is absent. He told him Billy
[1:43:43] you cannot plant them potatoes this time
[1:43:46] because the moon is absent and brother
[1:43:49] will tell the father he said daddy I'm
[1:43:51] pling planting it in the earth I'm not
[1:43:54] planting it in the moon.
[1:43:58] And Charles Broner will tell him he said
[1:44:00] go ahead smart alec you have some bombs
[1:44:04] on your head it's there if you read it
[1:44:07] but I have to quot it so that you can go
[1:44:09] faster
[1:44:10] right and brother says it says you know
[1:44:14] in the absence of the moon if you take a
[1:44:16] board b a r d if you take a board and
[1:44:20] use it to cover the grass in the absence
[1:44:22] of the moon he said the grass will die.
[1:44:27] He said but when the moon he said but in
[1:44:30] the presence of the moon when the moon
[1:44:32] is on you use the same board to cover
[1:44:35] the same grass or to cover a grass
[1:44:37] brother said the grass could be there
[1:44:39] for one week
[1:44:41] and it will not die.
[1:44:44] So heaven governs the earth.
[1:44:48] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And you know moon is what controls the
[1:44:52] tide.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Moon controls the tide. No. And it was
[1:44:56] only the earthly system that fell. The
[1:44:58] heavenly system did not fall. Everything
[1:45:01] is still intact. The way God fixed them
[1:45:04] in there from the day of their creation.
[1:45:06] Hallelujah. All right. And he spoke on
[1:45:09] more things on that. But let's just
[1:45:11] leave that. So don't forget that you
[1:45:13] were born under a certain star. I was
[1:45:16] born under a certain star that has to do
[1:45:19] with my life. It influences you. That is
[1:45:23] all of us here. We don't behave alike.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Some are gentle, some are calm,
[1:45:31] some are quiet, some are not quiet.
[1:45:37] Right?
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Some are introvert, some are extrovert.
[1:45:41] And yet they are Christians filled with
[1:45:43] the Holy Spirit. Some are very very
[1:45:46] sequential. They finish with one before
[1:45:49] they go to two. They deal with two
[1:45:52] before they go to three. But some don't
[1:45:54] care.
[1:45:57] And yet they are Christians filled with
[1:45:59] the Holy Spirit. Something is
[1:46:01] responsible for that. There's an
[1:46:04] influence from the celestial world that
[1:46:08] controls us here on earth. He compare
[1:46:11] Abraham seed to stars. And brother
[1:46:14] Abraham says, "Do you realize that you
[1:46:16] represent a star in heaven and every
[1:46:18] star in heaven represent you?" Did you
[1:46:20] know God told Abraham that his seed will
[1:46:24] be like the stars of heaven? Hallelujah.
[1:46:28] Now when Christ Jesus was born,
[1:46:31] how many stars aligned?
[1:46:34] Three stars came into constellation
[1:46:37] and the prophet said these stars are the
[1:46:40] stars of Ham, Shem and Jaffet people,
[1:46:44] the Jews, the Gentiles and the
[1:46:46] Samaritans. You see these stars
[1:46:48] represent all the races of the peoples
[1:46:51] of the earth, right? And they came
[1:46:54] together to signify the birth of that
[1:46:58] boy. I'm sorry. In quotes,
[1:47:01] to signify the birth of baby Jesus. And
[1:47:04] brother Brham said said when those stars
[1:47:07] came in constellation, he said they made
[1:47:10] an announcement
[1:47:12] of the birth of an infant Christ.
[1:47:17] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; The astronomical heaven came together.
[1:47:21] The astronomical heaven came together at
[1:47:23] the birth of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Who wrote what's his first Bible? Is it
[1:47:28] not the zodiac?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Who placed the stars in their place? Is
[1:47:32] it not God?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Now the uh how will I put it now? Those
[1:47:39] pointed luminous lights in our evening
[1:47:42] skies are not the only thing that are
[1:47:44] known and color. I mean that are known
[1:47:46] as stars. You hear me? We have stars in
[1:47:50] the evening, right? We pointed you know
[1:47:54] edges and stuff. That's what we call
[1:47:56] star. But I'm telling us that is not
[1:48:00] only those ones that are called star.
[1:48:02] Moon is a star.
[1:48:04] The sun is a star. Pluto is a star. Mars
[1:48:07] is a star. Mercury is a star. All those
[1:48:10] things are stars.
[1:48:12] Praise the name of the Lord. So all
[1:48:14] those things are stars. Now when Jesus
[1:48:17] was born, three stars came together. God
[1:48:20] moved this one, moved this one, moved
[1:48:23] that one from their orbit, and they met
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; and they were wise men, astrologers
[1:48:31] to complete their academic astronomy in
[1:48:33] Babylon. Brothers, actually they were
[1:48:35] Jews. They were in Babylon to complete
[1:48:38] their uh their studies on uh astronomy.
[1:48:41] They saw the stars, the way he moved.
[1:48:45] Come on, church. The way the stars came
[1:48:48] together, the angular inclination, the
[1:48:51] facial appearance, the densiness. They
[1:48:54] say something is about this. They were
[1:48:57] able to read it. Then they went back.
[1:49:00] Hallelujah. That was they could look at
[1:49:02] the zodiac. Then they came back to this.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Come on. And they refer back to the
[1:49:09] prophecy of Baham. Yes,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; there shall rise a star
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; out of Jacob.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Then they knew that baby Jesus must be
[1:49:21] born in Bethlehem.
[1:49:23] And they started following the star,
[1:49:25] following the star, following the star.
[1:49:26] And when they got to the gate of
[1:49:28] Jerusalem, the g the star disappeared
[1:49:31] because brother Abraham said it was
[1:49:33] their time to scatter the light. And
[1:49:35] they truly moved Jerusalem with their
[1:49:37] with their message. Where is he that is
[1:49:40] born king of the Jews?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And Herod heard it. You know what Herod
[1:49:44] said? Let's leave that. He will take our
[1:49:47] time. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Three stars came in alignment when Jesus
[1:49:52] was born. Showing that that gift was for
[1:49:55] the entire peoples of the earth,
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; not for the Jews alone.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; And may I say this, you have access to
[1:50:04] this information. America is the land of
[1:50:07] the message. As I often say, Israel is a
[1:50:09] land of the Bible,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Muki can never till through eternity, we
[1:50:17] still be talking about Tusa. That's
[1:50:19] where seven angels came from eternity,
[1:50:21] right?
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; We cried the covenant angel rainbow over
[1:50:25] his head.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; As I was coming into to I mean Tin, we
[1:50:31] say Tukin, but you pronounce it as Tin,
[1:50:34] right? I said what a privilege.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; To come into this city. You may not it
[1:50:40] may not mean anything to you but it mean
[1:50:43] a thousand to me.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Heavenly guest God Almighty Jes. He came
[1:50:51] down to give him the revelation of this
[1:50:53] great book
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; and it became a new book.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; The first time I came into Arizona I
[1:51:01] said no wonder God chose this place to
[1:51:03] make a servant. is a desert play but it
[1:51:06] has its own unique beauty
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; and appearance. The topography is
[1:51:10] marvelous. Is only God that can sculpt
[1:51:13] that.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; So now also church I want to say this
[1:51:20] don't forget that brother was born under
[1:51:24] the same zodiac sign
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; that Jesus was born.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Who identify Jesus? Who identify Jesus
[1:51:31] star? Astronomers who identify brother
[1:51:34] Bernham stars astronomers,
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; stargazers,
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; of course you know it. It was in the
[1:51:40] great hands.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; And that heavy set woman
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; an astronomer, a stargazer
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; that could read the planetary body
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; and it could she knows what it means.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; The sun can be like this. The moon can
[1:51:55] be like this. And the woman could know.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Astronomers star gazers they are
[1:51:59] talented to do that. He said this is
[1:52:02] what it means. This is the implication.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Disaster is about to happen. Blessing is
[1:52:07] in the offing.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; So it was an astronomer that told him,
[1:52:12] he said, "You were born under a certain
[1:52:14] sign."
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can tell." Of course, you
[1:52:18] know the story. The prophet did not want
[1:52:20] to attend to the woman.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "You were born under a certain
[1:52:23] sign."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "Do you know that I can
[1:52:26] tell you the very date you were born?"
[1:52:29] Brother Van say you can't. He say I can.
[1:52:34] And he say you were born in April 6,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; 1909
[1:52:39] at 5:00 in the morning. Come on brother.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; How was she able to identify that?
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Because they said brother had an oral
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; the color of his anointing.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; So they saw that he said tell you say
[1:52:55] Lord the day he was born she said I
[1:52:57] can't do that.
[1:52:58] because he was born under a certain
[1:53:00] story. Brother Brham and Jesus Christ
[1:53:02] were born under the same zodiac sign
[1:53:05] because the ministry of brother Brandham
[1:53:06] was the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:53:08] reincarnated and the ministry was not
[1:53:10] only for the Americans
[1:53:12] for the entire world.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; And you know the attitude of brother
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; he was homely with the whites. He was
[1:53:21] very homely with the blacks.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Very homely with the Indians. very
[1:53:26] homely with the red Chinese, very homely
[1:53:28] with the brown, very homely with all the
[1:53:30] races of the people of the earth.
[1:53:32] Because the gift was for all the peoples
[1:53:34] of the earth,
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; for the Jew, for the Samaritans, and for
[1:53:38] the Gentiles.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; That is what the same stars that
[1:53:41] constellated when Jesus was born also
[1:53:43] came together when brother Brham was
[1:53:45] born.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Though some worship him, well, he's
[1:53:49] permitted.
[1:53:51] But brother Brham is not God.
[1:53:54] is a servant of God.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; Now church. So they were born under the
[1:54:01] same zodiac. Now let's go to end time
[1:54:03] seat sign. Yeah. The end time seat sign
[1:54:06] program 154. Let's be fast. End time
[1:54:09] seat sign. Program 154.
[1:54:14] We see what it says.
[1:54:17] Okay. Now brother said don't fail to get
[1:54:20] this. I think we have 20 more minutes.
[1:54:24] Don't fail to get this. Where is it?
[1:54:28] Just a moment. Yeah. Now look paragraph
[1:54:33] 154 first. Let's go to 155. I don't know
[1:54:37] the one again. Now just one thing here.
[1:54:38] Listen before we close. You said don't
[1:54:40] fail to find this now. Before the first
[1:54:43] coming of Jesus, the astron astronomers
[1:54:45] of India. I think I've quoted this.
[1:54:47] Let's go to 59. Paragraph 59 of this
[1:54:50] book. Amen.
[1:54:53] I said amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; If I say amen, you say amen.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; If I say hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen is a heavenly word.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah is a heavenly word.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Those are the words in heaven that God
[1:55:07] released to us.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; That's why amen is amen in any language
[1:55:12] under the sun.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah is hallelujah. No
[1:55:15] interpretation. Abraham said they are
[1:55:17] heavenly words.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen and hallelujah.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now,
[1:55:25] Brother Brham says we see a roar in the
[1:55:28] papers.
[1:55:30] We see a roar in the papers across the
[1:55:33] television out across the nation. I will
[1:55:35] quote this also because of our time.
[1:55:37] Brother said Indian astronomers
[1:55:41] they predicted
[1:55:45] in uh first or second week of February
[1:55:50] in 1962
[1:55:53] the five stars
[1:55:55] will come in alignment. I want to say
[1:55:58] this if I pin myself to reading it we
[1:56:01] take our time. Are we in church? Yes.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Brother say Indian astronomers
[1:56:07] they predicted
[1:56:09] that five stars how many stars came in
[1:56:12] alignment when Jesus was born? Thank
[1:56:14] you. Three. So when in 1962 brother say
[1:56:19] in the end astronomers is in this book
[1:56:21] and also come on our reader they
[1:56:23] predicted that five stars will come in
[1:56:26] alignment in 1962
[1:56:28] and it was February in the month of
[1:56:30] February. Why February?
[1:56:33] I think seven angels came from eternity
[1:56:35] in February. February 28th
[1:56:38] right here. Thank you brother. Though
[1:56:40] some are saying brother Brana was not
[1:56:42] there he was here. He was there.
[1:56:45] America will say garbage.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; If brother Brana was not there who would
[1:56:50] have been there who was qualified to
[1:56:53] receive the Lord of glory from eternity
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; though in his angelic body not in his
[1:56:58] corporal body.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; What are we talking about? If brother
[1:57:02] was not connected with the ringshaped
[1:57:03] cloud, we are wasting our time here.
[1:57:06] There's no redemption for the blood of
[1:57:07] Christ.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; We don't need to mind that is permitted.
[1:57:12] The truth came from America. Arrow also
[1:57:15] has to come from America because when
[1:57:17] Jesus plant the planted the wheat, the
[1:57:20] enemy came right beside it to plant not
[1:57:23] in another field, the same field.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:57:29] Soon now five stars came in alignment.
[1:57:32] The uh Indian astronomer predicted that
[1:57:35] in in the first part of February 1962
[1:57:38] that five stars will come in alignment.
[1:57:42] May God just help us
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; right? And brother say American
[1:57:46] newspapers you know your country they
[1:57:48] make fun of it. He said American
[1:57:51] newspapers made fun of it. He said and
[1:57:54] they also said that the world will burst
[1:57:58] the earth will burst like a watermelon.
[1:58:00] Brother say he did not believe that the
[1:58:03] world will bust like watermelon. He said
[1:58:05] but it is wrong to make fun of it. He
[1:58:08] said because to him it has spiritual
[1:58:11] significance.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He say it has spiritual
[1:58:16] significance. Let's go to the communion.
[1:58:19] Let's go to the other one. Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] Let's go to the communion. I'm jumping
[1:58:24] now, but that's okay. Let's go to
[1:58:26] communion. That is 62. Where is it now?
[1:58:30] Hallelujah.
[1:58:31] 62. The communion I wrote there. I just
[1:58:34] bring it out. I can't get it now. So
[1:58:36] that I will uh list that out before we
[1:58:40] go. I gave there's a communion there.
[1:58:42] 62031
[1:58:44] something. Yeah. Paragraph 74.
[1:58:48] Now in paragraph 74 of that book, let's
[1:58:53] see what the prophet said in there.
[1:58:56] We've quoted all this. God Almighty
[1:58:59] helping us. Okay. Paragraph 74 of 6204
[1:59:05] communion. I will have to read this now.
[1:59:08] Amen.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Anywhere we reach when the time get we
[1:59:12] just leave it. Now paragraph uh
[1:59:16] 74 it says we see that the astronomers
[1:59:20] are predicting sometimes in the early
[1:59:23] part or the first part of the month
[1:59:26] beginning uh beginning on the second or
[1:59:29] the 5th or somewhere along this month
[1:59:31] that was February. Hallelujah. 6204
[1:59:37] this is your dating pattern. This is
[1:59:39] America dating pattern. The 02 there
[1:59:41] mean February. Is it February or
[1:59:44] February?
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; All right. The second month of the year.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's when they predicted that this
[1:59:52] will take place. And we had a similar
[1:59:55] thing again this same year, February.
[1:59:57] Why February? No. The Indian astronomer
[2:00:01] predicts that the world will blow to to
[2:00:04] pieces and the American newspapers make
[2:00:06] fun of it. I do not believe the world is
[2:00:08] going to blow to pieces. But I do say it
[2:00:10] is wrong to make fun of you because
[2:00:12] something is fixing to happen. What did
[2:00:15] the prophet say? Something is fixing to
[2:00:18] happen.
[2:00:20] Hallelujah.
[2:00:21] Now some of one of these days something
[2:00:24] similar to that when the five planets
[2:00:27] Mars, Jupiter and Venus. He mentioned
[2:00:30] three and so forth. But thank God he put
[2:00:33] and so forth. They never have did it.
[2:00:36] Brother Vanam said they never have come
[2:00:38] together. Five. They never have did it.
[2:00:41] Oh, they claim maybe 25,000 years ago,
[2:00:44] but who was back there to know it?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I predict, brother Ram
[2:00:51] say, I predict that this has a spiritual
[2:00:53] application.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Astronomers had a prediction. Brother
[2:00:58] Ram pick it up. He say has a spiritual
[2:01:01] application. I believe it the coming in
[2:01:04] of the issue of God that the great
[2:01:06] revelations of the word of of the word
[2:01:08] will be open during this time.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Remember the claim it was three stars
[2:01:13] came into their orbit when Jesus was
[2:01:15] born
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; and the very following year allelujah
[2:01:20] angels came from eternity and the seven
[2:01:23] seals were opened.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; The word of the living God was open to
[2:01:27] the bride and that is what it takes to
[2:01:29] bring the bride of Christ to perfection.
[2:01:31] Creeds and dogmas will not do it.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; Our senses will not do it. Hallelujah.
[2:01:38] And church of the living God, we have to
[2:01:40] walk by this message.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; He your pastor pass an instruction to
[2:01:44] you is not dictating over you. He's
[2:01:46] giving you something that will give you
[2:01:48] life.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; You hear what I said?
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; I said if your pastor gives you an
[2:01:57] instruction, I'm using the word
[2:01:59] instruction. I'm not missing word
[2:02:02] because the pastoral office authorizes
[2:02:04] him to do that. And if you're a
[2:02:07] believer, you carry it out. Brother
[2:02:10] said, "Listen to your pastor." Lord,
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. I
[2:02:17] don't know the paragraph. Maybe 70 to
[2:02:19] 80.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. 84. He said, "Listen
[2:02:23] to your pastor." Right? He said he will
[2:02:26] lead you through because God has given
[2:02:30] him the instinct
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; to lead you through.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; And as a sheep, you can't lead yourself.
[2:02:37] It takes the shepherd to do that.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Is an authority, is an office, is an
[2:02:42] inspiration, is an understanding. The
[2:02:45] pastoral office is an understanding.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; And you the sheep cannot come in there.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; How many people governs America? Is it
[2:02:55] not President Donald Trump? How many
[2:02:57] president do you have?
[2:03:00] I'm asking us a question answer so that
[2:03:02] be fast. Church,
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; we have only one president, right?
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one that has a rule.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; We read in Nigeria, executive order,
[2:03:11] executive order, executive order. Go and
[2:03:13] challenge it.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:03:17] And this one is more important than the
[2:03:20] presidential office.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Is to walk on the faith of the children
[2:03:25] of God. Is to walk on their welfare. Is
[2:03:28] to work on their health. Walk on their
[2:03:30] marriage. Walk on their family.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to your pastor.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; If you want to make heaven,
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; can I tell you something else, brother?
[2:03:39] Say listen to your pastor. the one that
[2:03:42] preaches the word to you so that you can
[2:03:44] be born again filled with the Holy
[2:03:46] Spirit and also be healed.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; It's a quote.
[2:03:51] So now while we forge ahead, give us the
[2:03:54] quotes. Thank you very much. He says
[2:03:57] he believe it has a spiritual
[2:03:59] application. The five stars coming
[2:04:01] together in alignment in 1962 February.
[2:04:04] He say believe he has a spiritual
[2:04:06] application that he believe is the
[2:04:08] coming in of the issue of God that the
[2:04:10] great revelation of the word of the Lord
[2:04:11] will be given. Hallelujah. And God oh
[2:04:15] mercy goodness. He said now remember it
[2:04:18] was five planets. Three say three is a
[2:04:21] number of perfection.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; God has his numerals.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; God has his numbers.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; We have one to 100 to 1 million. But God
[2:04:30] don't bother himself about our numbers.
[2:04:33] He just pick the one he want and then he
[2:04:35] throw the rest to us. One you know is
[2:04:37] unity. Two is weakness. Three is our
[2:04:39] perfection complete. Yeah. Perfection.
[2:04:42] Four is our God. Five is what? Grace.
[2:04:47] Hallelujah.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Three Christ Jesus was born. Five. What
[2:04:52] was to happen? You know why we continue?
[2:04:55] And um you said but this is this is
[2:04:58] five. Three is a number of perfection.
[2:05:01] Five is a number of grace. G S U S F A
[2:05:05] so forth number of grace. God ever send
[2:05:07] his power to the church. It to be by his
[2:05:10] grace.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I was so grateful when he sang Amazing
[2:05:13] Grace before I came to the pulpit.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 42. Let's go to
[2:05:18] Isaiah chapter 40. Brother Brham says,
[2:05:20] "If God ever send his power to the
[2:05:22] church, it will be by grace. If God ever
[2:05:25] heal you, it will be by grace. If God
[2:05:28] ever save you, it will be by grace. If
[2:05:30] God ever bless you, it will be by grace.
[2:05:33] He give us a prophet is by grace. They
[2:05:36] say heaven for us is by grace. Not
[2:05:38] because we deserve it.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 40. Isaiah 40 is by
[2:05:45] grace. The Bible says here in Isaiah 40,
[2:05:48] it say comfort comfort my people.
[2:05:53] Right? Isaiah 40 verse1. That was what
[2:05:56] Isaiah, God was telling uh Israel to
[2:05:59] Isaiah, he said, "Comforty, comforty, my
[2:06:01] people." Amen. He's not on the screen.
[2:06:05] He said, "Tell her that her warfare is
[2:06:08] over."
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; He's on the screen now. All right. But I
[2:06:12] can't see. No. Isaiah 40.
[2:06:16] Yeah, you are living. Yeah, I want
[2:06:18] Isaiah 40. The prophet quoted it. That's
[2:06:20] why I want to read it because the
[2:06:22] prophet said if we get anything good
[2:06:25] from God is because of grace.
[2:06:29] Who is worthy of heaven here?
[2:06:32] Come on church. Who is worthy of heaven?
[2:06:35] Who is worthy of brother Abraham? Who is
[2:06:37] worthy of the message of the hour? I
[2:06:40] meant it on Thursday. I say how will I
[2:06:42] enter here and preach the message where
[2:06:44] the prophet of the Lord stepped into.
[2:06:46] And I learned when he's entering a
[2:06:48] congregation, you know that brother
[2:06:50] Brandham was entering the presence of
[2:06:52] God was so the presence of God was so
[2:06:55] overwhelming.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; So who deserve that? Who deserves
[2:07:00] heaven? We don't even deserve good food.
[2:07:04] I said we don't deserve good food. We
[2:07:08] deserve to die and go to hell
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; and suffer here on earth with
[2:07:12] excruciating pains. is the grace of God
[2:07:15] that makes us healthy and to be alive.
[2:07:18] Is the grace of God that give us good
[2:07:20] clothes to wear. Is the grace of God
[2:07:22] that gives us a church that gives us a
[2:07:24] pastor that gives us church members that
[2:07:27] gives us people that believe this
[2:07:30] message.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; It' be more frustrating if it's only
[2:07:33] pastor Israel and the wife that are here
[2:07:36] clapping their hand. But now it's more
[2:07:38] wonderful. We have 1 2 3 4 5 XYZ.
[2:07:43] So the worship is sweeter and sweeter
[2:07:45] and sweeter.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; Is the grace of God that brought people
[2:07:49] together to believe this message. The
[2:07:51] hardest thing to believe on earth is the
[2:07:53] message.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; So you have to you have to believe it by
[2:07:56] predestination.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Apart from that you can't.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; So now he said comfort comfort my people
[2:08:04] said God said your God. speak it
[2:08:07] comfortably to Jerusalem and crown to
[2:08:10] her that her warfare
[2:08:12] is accomplished that her iniquity is
[2:08:15] pardoned for she had received of the
[2:08:17] Lord's hand double for her sin as at
[2:08:19] this time brotherham say Israel was in
[2:08:22] idolatry
[2:08:25] as at this time that this scripture this
[2:08:27] prophecy was given Israel was worshiping
[2:08:30] idol she was in idolatry but God chose
[2:08:34] not to see it God turned a blind eye to
[2:08:37] what Israel was doing and he chose to
[2:08:40] pass a message of comfort.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; He said comforty comfort my people. If
[2:08:44] we have anything good is because of the
[2:08:47] love of God is because of the amazing
[2:08:49] grace. We do not deserve it to begin
[2:08:51] with.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; We love to keep malice.
[2:08:58] We love to backbite.
[2:09:00] We love to do those wrong things. Right?
[2:09:03] And those that does those things are not
[2:09:05] children of God. But the mercies of the
[2:09:08] Lord even sometime as believers. God
[2:09:11] help us.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; And one of the most horrible thing you
[2:09:15] can do is to speak bad about your past.
[2:09:17] He didn't send me to say that. That's
[2:09:19] one of the most horrible thing you can
[2:09:21] do. He come to me. I want to say it. If
[2:09:23] you feel he offend you, go to him.
[2:09:26] Right?
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; Go to him. He said, "Brother Paul, I'm
[2:09:29] so sorry. Don't be offended. I you did
[2:09:32] this. You did this, you did this. I
[2:09:34] don't like you hurt my feeling.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's the message.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. Matthew
[2:09:41] chapter 18.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Anybody hot to go to him,
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Don't keep it.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; You will not make the church to be
[2:09:49] healthy.
[2:09:51] You are you are begrudging your pastor,
[2:09:53] begrudging the wife and you are coming
[2:09:54] to listen to him preach
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; and the wife will play the keyboard. How
[2:09:58] would that benefit you? It's not in my
[2:10:00] note, but it's in my mind to say
[2:10:03] it can benefit you for nothing.
[2:10:05] Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of
[2:10:08] the Lord.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Our time is just flying off. Oh, mercy
[2:10:11] goodness.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we leave this. Brother Ron
[2:10:17] says, let's continue with that our our
[2:10:20] quote. He said, now so in my it may mean
[2:10:23] something. He say I predict that
[2:10:25] there'll be there will be a ch there
[2:10:28] will be a change. I don't know be what
[2:10:30] it will be but I believe it's fixing to
[2:10:32] happen. We are on it right now. Brother
[2:10:34] Brandham said the five stars that
[2:10:36] aligned right was intro. He said it was
[2:10:40] an introduction. He say it was for the
[2:10:43] birth of an infant church.
[2:10:46] Are you there?
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Time now is against us
[2:10:50] now. Time is against Let's go to 159.
[2:10:53] Let's go to 159 of the end times seat
[2:10:56] sai program 159 of the end time seat sai
[2:11:00] and um this is what came to my mind to
[2:11:02] say here and if I pick something else it
[2:11:05] could mean something else sometimes to
[2:11:07] disobey God and um now
[2:11:11] 159 of the new what happened we see a in
[2:11:14] the paper across the television across
[2:11:17] the nations where five stars
[2:11:20] where five stars I think we can read it
[2:11:23] together now where five stars just uh
[2:11:27] did what?
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Fell in line with the world.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; Five is grace. Now how will I explain?
[2:11:36] There's no board. I will have drawn a
[2:11:37] little something. You know that here the
[2:11:41] planets revolute around the sun,
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; right? In their orbit. They say we have
[2:11:47] nine planets. Here is the sun. The earth
[2:11:50] is somewhere, right? And the Pluto boom
[2:11:54] round and Mercury round all of them they
[2:11:57] go around in a circular format. Is that
[2:12:00] not then all of a sudden? Amen. How will
[2:12:05] I explain this? All of a sudden as they
[2:12:08] were going Mars reached this point in a
[2:12:12] straight line with the earth. Jupiter
[2:12:14] reached the same point. Mercury reached
[2:12:16] the same point. Uh Saturn reached the
[2:12:18] same point at the same time. They were
[2:12:21] on a straight line,
[2:12:24] right? So God make the astronomic bodies
[2:12:29] to be on a straight line with the earth
[2:12:30] to make an announcement
[2:12:33] that my church, my bride is been born.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Okay, this is it." He
[2:12:42] said, "We see a ro." He said, "A number
[2:12:45] of grace."
[2:12:46] He said, "Where five stars, John fell in
[2:12:49] line with the world." What is five? A
[2:12:51] number of grace. And brother say every
[2:12:54] time those stars come, what did he say?
[2:12:59] Then something happens on earth.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; And in February 25 28 those stars came
[2:13:05] again,
[2:13:07] brother say every time those stars come,
[2:13:10] he say something happens on the earth.
[2:13:13] What taking place? Five star fell in.
[2:13:15] What was it? A introducing what? Since
[2:13:18] then, you said just look what happened.
[2:13:20] Germany almost washed up the map. Go off
[2:13:22] sister. He said over 70,000 about 70,000
[2:13:25] houses were destroyed in England in 1962
[2:13:30] because God was talking to us through
[2:13:32] the first Bible. He allowed five planets
[2:13:35] to come in alignment with the earth
[2:13:37] telling us that I am introducing the
[2:13:40] birth of my infant bride. My bride is
[2:13:43] beginning in her infancy. And the very
[2:13:46] following year here in your country,
[2:13:48] seven angels came from eternity with
[2:13:50] Christ the covenant angel to give him
[2:13:52] the revelation of the seven seals.
[2:13:55] Right? The very word that will bring the
[2:13:58] bride to perfection.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Are you there? And brother said right
[2:14:02] then he said the the bride of he said
[2:14:05] the bride of Christ has come under the
[2:14:07] power of the word of the living God.
[2:14:10] Now, a baby that was born in 1962
[2:14:14] is still an infant tonight.
[2:14:17] I'm asking us a question. A baby that
[2:14:20] was born in 1962 is still a baby in
[2:14:23] 2025.
[2:14:25] Come on. I want to hear all of us.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Right. So now, oh God have mercy upon
[2:14:31] us. Time is a bad enemy. Amen. So the
[2:14:35] brain he said an introducing of what he
[2:14:38] said my said this England the other day
[2:14:40] like to wash up. Let's go to 161
[2:14:43] 161 which says this. He says what
[2:14:47] happened
[2:14:49] an infant church. Hallelujah. A bride I
[2:14:55] hope I'm not shouting please.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; A bright infancy
[2:15:00] that the power of God has be to fall on
[2:15:03] her. She's taking form a bride for this
[2:15:06] bridegroom. That three star meant the
[2:15:09] perfection of the heavenly father of the
[2:15:10] trinity becoming one on earth among us.
[2:15:13] God offices becoming one office. He said
[2:15:15] what happened now?
[2:15:18] It the church of the living God coming
[2:15:21] together under the word of God and the
[2:15:24] astronomic heaven is announcing her
[2:15:27] approach. Amen.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:32] Brother, in our wedding ceremony, when
[2:15:35] the groom is coming, no much noise.
[2:15:39] When the groom is coming, in our wedding
[2:15:40] ceremonies, when the groom is coming, no
[2:15:43] much noise,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; nobody seems to pay attention. But
[2:15:47] brother, once the bride is ready to come
[2:15:49] in, but we all guitar be playing,
[2:15:53] keyboard will be playing, everything
[2:15:54] will be playing, the whole thing, I mean
[2:15:56] the whole situation will get desperate.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Everybody will be looking, everybody
[2:16:00] will be looking.
[2:16:02] Where is the bride? Who is the bride?
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; And the train will be entering one by
[2:16:07] one. So church, almighty God is
[2:16:10] showcasing the bride.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; And he allow five stars to align with
[2:16:14] the earth. In 1962,
[2:16:17] brother say an introduction of what? He
[2:16:19] say it's an introduction of the infant

[2:19:24] remaining two.
[2:19:26] He mentioned Mars, Jupiter, Venus.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Those were the stars. The astronomer
[2:19:32] said we come in line with the earth.
[2:19:35] Right? And the prophet said to him, it
[2:19:37] has a spiritual significance.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Right? He said is a coming in of the
[2:19:42] issue of God that God is to bring the
[2:19:44] great revelation of the Bible. And he
[2:19:47] says an introduction the God was using
[2:19:49] the astronomic heaven to announce the
[2:19:52] bride approach to announce the birth of

[2:20:39] celestial event occurred. A seven planet
[2:20:43] alignment. How many planet alignments?
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Seven.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; Seven. We've had three. We've have five.
[2:20:49] This is seven. And to God, seven is
[2:20:52] finished.

[2:21:03] began. Now we at the end of the end.

[2:21:08] marks the beginning of the end. But now
[2:21:11] we at the end of the end. Anything can
[2:21:14] happen. When I preach this back home, I
[2:21:16] told the church, I'm not a prophet. I
[2:21:18] said, but watch from hereafter the thing
[2:21:21] that be taking place on the air because
[2:21:22] brother Brandham said it. And after
[2:21:25] that, your country produced a pope. And
[2:21:27] you know what brother Brandham said
[2:21:29] about that.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. We are at the end.
[2:21:32] After this alignment, I believe the pope
[2:21:35] that will bring the squeeze against me
[2:21:37] and you
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; came into the office
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; and the whole world so rejoiced that
[2:21:43] America could produce a pope. And don't
[2:21:45] forget brother say according to prophecy
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; when the pope come from the United
[2:21:50] States of America
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; he said the bride church will come
[2:21:53] together
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; and he will form the war council of
[2:21:56] churches after this alignment
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; that took place. You will see thing that
[2:22:01] be I'm not a prophet but I believe
[2:22:03] brother Rana
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; more than I believe anybody on earth.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Seven planet alignment
[2:22:11] often referred to as a planet parade.
[2:22:14] That's why I put all parade par. You say
[2:22:16] par pronounce it for them.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Parade.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. Planet parade. I say parade.

[2:22:23] abs.

[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's too separate.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you very much. God bless. Do
[2:22:51] you see Mercury?
[2:22:53] Didn't brother Bernham mention Mercury.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. He mentioned Mars.
[2:22:58] Mars. He mentioned Jupiter. He mentioned
[2:23:01] Venus. We see Mercury, isn't it?
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; Do you see Venus or Venus?
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Runner mentioned Venus. Do you
[2:23:09] see Mars?
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Runner mentioned Mars. Do you
[2:23:12] see Jupiter? Brother Runner mentioned
[2:23:15] Jupiter. Do you see Saturn? He gave us
[2:23:18] and so forth.
[2:23:21] Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Is that number
[2:23:25] seven?
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Seven planets. Let me read my own.
[2:23:31] Yeah, that's the last. Mercury one.
[2:23:34] Hallelujah.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:37] I will say one then you're ready. One,
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; two,
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; uh,
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; three,
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; four,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; uh, five,
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; six,
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; seven,
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; completion.
[2:23:52] And those star visited the earth. Let's
[2:23:55] go on. Let's just read more. This one
[2:23:57] says this this alignment was visible
[2:24:00] just after sunset. Come on, brother.
[2:24:05] For those stars,
[2:24:07] you can't see them with your naked eye,
[2:24:10] but they came so low to the earth that
[2:24:14] men of the earth could see them. What
[2:24:16] was God telling us? God is telling us
[2:24:19] that it is over. The bride is ready. The
[2:24:22] rapture is at the corner. Get ready,
[2:24:25] church. Don't just come to church and
[2:24:27] believe the message. You must put the
[2:24:29] message in practice. Amen.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; If there's anything in your life, get it
[2:24:33] right.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; If there's anything between your husband
[2:24:36] and your wife, settle it.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm closing, pastor. If there's
[2:24:42] anything between you and your husband,
[2:24:44] what did I say?
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; Settle it. You know, you die and you go
[2:24:49] to hell.
[2:24:51] Let's make our wrongs right. Heaven is
[2:24:54] for righteousness. Amen.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Ronham said when he went to the
[2:24:59] sixth dimension heaven, he said sublime
[2:25:02] doesn't touch it. Perfection doesn't
[2:25:04] touch it. He said it takes perfect laugh
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; to get there. There must be no hatred in
[2:25:10] your heart. Even if he disagree with
[2:25:12] you, you must love him. You must love
[2:25:14] her. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He
[2:25:17] said this was visible. He said this
[2:25:19] alignment was visible just after sunset
[2:25:21] with Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter
[2:25:25] observable to the naked eye. These are
[2:25:29] things you don't see often.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; You see maybe once in two or three
[2:25:34] generations,
[2:25:35] but they came so close that the naked
[2:25:37] eye could see them. Now you say Uranus
[2:25:40] and Neptune require the use of
[2:25:42] binoculars or a telescope and Saturn was
[2:25:46] more challenging to spot due to it maybe
[2:25:48] closer to the sun. Do you see that such
[2:25:51] a seven planet alignment is a rare
[2:25:54] occurrence with the next similar event
[2:25:56] not expected until 2040? We at the end
[2:25:59] time church. I'm so sorry we had to cut
[2:26:02] and butcher because of time. Shall we
[2:26:04] pray?
[2:26:06] Amazing
[2:26:11] grace,
[2:26:15] how sweet
[2:26:16] th
[2:26:23] like me.
[2:26:27] I once was lost but now I am found. The
[2:26:33] pastor now was blind.
[2:26:37] But now
[2:26:39] I see
[2:26:44] it was grace
[2:26:47] taught
[2:26:49] my heart
[2:26:51] to fear
[2:26:54] and grace
[2:26:58] fears
[2:27:00] relieve.
[2:27:01] How precious did.
[2:27:05] How precious
[2:27:08] did
[2:27:10] that grace
[2:27:13] appear.
[2:27:16] The hour
[2:27:19] I first
[2:27:21] believe.
[2:27:23] Every head bowed, every eye closed. If
[2:27:26] you're here this morning and you need uh
[2:27:30] prayer, a special prayer, our brother
[2:27:34] traveled from from Africa to be with us,
[2:27:38] brother Joseph,
[2:27:40] come
[2:27:42] and you desire prayer from our dear
[2:27:46] brother.
[2:27:48] I'm going to open up that opportunity
[2:27:51] for you to come forward to have hands
[2:27:53] laid upon you and we'll make that
[2:27:56] available to you. If you want to spend
[2:27:59] time in prayer at the altar and at your
[2:28:02] seat, I'm going to make that available
[2:28:04] to you. That's more important than
[2:28:08] anything else you have on your schedule
[2:28:12] is to really
[2:28:15] really take heed to the word that that
[2:28:17] you heard. So many signs, wonders that
[2:28:21] were brought to us and then right at the
[2:28:23] end if there's anything in your heart or
[2:28:26] in your life that's not right, you need
[2:28:28] to make that right. You need to get that
[2:28:30] straight before God. And so if you
[2:28:34] desire prayer,
[2:28:36] you can come forward, you can sit in
[2:28:39] your seat,
[2:28:41] but if you desire prayer, why don't you
[2:28:44] just make your way up to the front here?
[2:28:46] Yes. Thank you, sister. Sister, brother
[2:28:49] Joseph, go down and pray. And if
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:56] if you have an unspoken request
[2:29:00] and you want to make that known to the
[2:29:02] Lord Jesus Christ right where you sit,
[2:29:05] why don't you slip up your hand to him
[2:29:09] and those hands that are raised, the
[2:29:10] Lord sees all of those requests.
[2:29:14] God bless those hands.
[2:29:17] [Music]
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every heart praying just Yes.

[2:39:55] Precious Lord Jesus God. How we thank
[2:39:58] you for the word that's came, Lord. We
[2:40:00] pray that you give us hearts to receive
[2:40:03] it. Father, Lord, we thank you for
[2:40:05] everything that's said and done today,
[2:40:06] Lord Jesus. It's just been a good day,
[2:40:09] Lord. We thank you for being with your
[2:40:11] people and right of this last hour, Lord
[2:40:13] Jesus. This family of God that you that
[2:40:16] you've birthed us into, Lord. Father, we
[2:40:19] just pray that you'll bring us back this
[2:40:21] evening safely, Lord. We don't ask to be
[2:40:23] dismissed from your presence. Only this
[2:40:25] building, Jesus, let us go and take the
[2:40:27] name of the Lord Jesus with us. It's in
[2:40:30] Jesus name we pray. Amen. You are

[2:40:54] He knows my name. I'm overwhelmed by the
[2:40:59] pain.
[2:41:00] I can't see the light of day.
[2:41:04] I know I'll be just fine.
