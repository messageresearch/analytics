be only [Music] believe all things are possible only believe only [Music] believe only be all things are [Music] possible only you may be seated brother brandham I love the reading of his blessed word so now we shall turn this morning in the book of First Corinthians and read for a portion of the 15th chapter beginning with the first verse moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received and wherein you stand by which also you are saved if you keep in memory that I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also receive how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures you might say brother Brandon that's rather an unusual text for a Mother's Day message well that's true but you know God's unusual and he does things in a unusual way and I think the thoughts of mother and I have one this morning by the grace of God still here on Earth with us and I'm grateful for mother but being that we were to have also a healing service and not knowing that I would be back again tonight but I thought maybe that we could paint a different type of a picture mother is so great you know the first one that receives you is this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you and the first to in this life to to hold you then when you're born she is a one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eyes she's the first one to patch you and to love you and to cool over you in this life is your mother now I think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is first with the child and she's a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road I think that's why mothers has a special little touch I know of a boy in this city I think his mother's present now he's almost my age but I don't say this to hurt the mother because that she has enough hurts is all mother but the boy drinks and he drinks heavy and when he gets real drunk he'll come home and jump in the bed with his mother and put his arms around her and he's got grandchildren but there's something about just the pth of a mother that seems to take a a different place than anything else can touch that is in this life humanly speaking you know a man like Moses he if I could credit anything to his character it was because he had a God sent mother you know it was she that had prayed Joseph and it long for this baby and when he was born she was the one who CED him and cuddled him and built the ark and placed him in the bull rushes when her poor heartbreaking her only little baby in it was the the most outstanding little chump that was in all the world and how mother likes any baby but to see this special little fella and then in her heart she knew that he was born for a purpose and then to take him and place him into the very D of crocodiles out into the river by faith she did that knowing that God was able to take care of him and summize the love of a mother and the action of the car of her faith for Faith does not Place itself upon the shifting Sands of what he can see Faith rests solemnly up on the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal word amen for by faith says the scripture she did this and faith can take its stand on the rock that the waves are beating the foundations out and look straight into the face of death and know that it'll be just in a little bit but faith can look across the sea to him that said I am the resurrection and life amen fail to even hear the waves of Dashing that's the kind of fith that Moses mother had she taught him and she reared him in the Palace of pharaoh teaching him that he was born for a purpose that Jehovah had answered her prayer and she he could not have had a better teacher that's what helped Mo the character that Moses was I believe it was Abraham Lincoln who once made a statement like this now I'm neither democrat or republican I just I'm a Christian or I think one side could not say anything against the other side it's all corruption but Abraham linking to my thoughts was one of the it was one I the greatest presidents that this United States ever had including Washington and so forth for Abraham Lincoln had a a bad start he was poor he had no background as far as education or or some great something or money or something that could have helped him like Washington did Washington was a college graduate and he he know he was a smart man a great man to begin with but Lincoln was raised in a little long cabin under the great grounds of Kentucky and with no Flory in the little old cabin which sets us a memorial here Louisville now but being the great man that he was and had to learn to write up on the ground that he plowed to plant the corn but I might pass this on to the young people do you know Abraham Lincoln never owned a book in his life until he was after 21 years old but the Bible and the fox book of the martyrs see what you read molds a character that you are no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics today little old fiction magazines and bulgar and nonsense is placed up on our news stands he on the Bible and the fox book of the martyrs look what it made but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this he said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a Godly mother that rear him to serve the Lord you see a child listens to its mother some little touch about that mother that a child will listen to when it's hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it'll go to the father because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives a mother to be that way I mean a real mother I believe that mothers are honorable and godly but I believe such as mother days like this is a racket make a lot of money out of flowers things but Mother's Day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on Mother's day but the love her and care for 365 days and nights through the year but of course the commercial world has a great hold in things like this and it it it depreciates mother oh well nice Mother's Day I sent her a bunch of flowers she appreciate a whole lot more just sit down talk to her just a little bit write her line Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on the cheek tell her you love her it'll go a lot farther than all the flowers that you could buy from the floors that's true I believe it was in The Ten Commandments the late Cecil de that wrote and put on the screen one of the masterpieces of the movie world and before it was put on the scene or let out Cecil de Mills called Old Roberts and Deus car a bunch of the Full Gospel ministers and tuck them into his own Studios and showed the four hours of the Ten Commandments and asked them their opinion of it God Rest his Gallant soul I when I seen the was looking at it and old remark always stuck to me if many of you did see it it was when the daughter of pharaoh after Moses had found out that he was a Hebrew and he had decided to go dwell with his people and there set his once beautiful mother faded out with her gray hair and her wrinkled face sitting in an old armed chair typical mother and the pharaoh's daughter came in and he said who son I'm I anyhow and when it was brought to light that Josie Bell was his real mother the daughter of pharaoh with her paint and so forth and all fixed up she said but look he may be your son but she said I give him wealth and Splendor you could have give him nothing but the Slime pits but the Aged grey-headed mother said but I give him life that makes the difference I gave him life God gave him eternal life how true mother sometimes people say to me mostly always in my campaigns I'm constantly preaching up on the resurrection and I read a text this morning of 15th chapter the fourth verse of First Corinthians on the resurrection but you see the way they Place mother today is a pot of flow setting by an old lady who's old and can't get up maybe and feeble and grayheadedgamer someone said you preached too much on the resurrection most every message has got something about the resurrection why sure it's the it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not rise again from the dead then all of it was in vain it to me proves that he was God proves every clean he made the resurrection and it also is the place of the resting of the Soul it's the starting part it's the crowning of our consolation and when we see that he rose from the dead it places us with the gospel armor at the Battlefront to take the place to fight for we know he said he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it again I think it's the great Carnation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection and his Divine promises and the consolation that it gives those who are trusting in it or it promises the great Union of our uniting together again it promises the the fading away of all sin it promises the fading away of all deformities all the sufferings that we have did in this had to go through within this life it promises and the banishing of it all it promises that even death will lose its hope and we'll rise in the likeness of Jesus so in my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises and the things of the scripture there's where it seal it the last Easter when I was preaching on the five things of living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away but Rising he justified freely forever that's the day for me that great day of days to see what it'll mean to all of us in the resurrection as we labor and wait for that blessed day of days it gives us the promise that someday that these old weakening people graded broke down mothers well be changed not only will mother sit there by herself but all of her family with her and what a day that will be what a time it will be when we look upon the faces of those who we have loved so well what a difference on that morning when we shall see our loved ones and and watch what they'll be then all the afflictions will be taken away all the Mars of suffering will be done no more pale cheeks of death No more tears from the eyes the resurrection promises all of this there'll be no more funerals no more patting the baby on the cheek that's like a piece of stone where the Undertaker hasn't bombed and pushed out and put paint on and so forth to look natural it'll never be needed again [Music] there then I think of when we see them standing Yonder our loved ones our mothers our kindreds our our friends and to see them in their Immortal bodies their celestial bodies watching their character seeing how they conduct themselves with that sweetness and quietness no more nervousness or frustrations the see him in standing in the likeness of the Lord Jesus that'll be a wonderful day each one of us in our minds are anticipating and longing for that hour of consolation when we meet them each one is thinking of their loved one maybe their mother that's gone on what a day it will be when you see her again and to Dad and to brother and to the all the loved ones what a day it will be [Music] h [Music] in [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] sh

I see brother galante's mother in the back there so happy to have her and brother uh all the visitors and friends and each of you God bless you richly I thank God for my dear mother I'm wearing this little white flower I see Trevor has one too remember my my mother is in glory she is the reason why we have any spiritual um uh um foundation in our home was because of my dear Mother and I thank God for her and um I know that each of you that have a mother that that you love it means so much to you amen if you still have your mother here today man go give her high five or something give her a hug or something however you do it all right so God bless you we like to go right into Psalms 113 we'll stand for the oh my stand for the reading of the word all I'd like to greet the Saints in Mesa there that are gathered in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and some of the friends that stream the service that can't be here and we' like to greet them also each each one Psalms 113 I'll read the first verse and we'll read the last verse all together the Bible say say praise ye the Lord Praise oh ye his servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised Lord Glory who is like unto the Lord Our God who dwelleth on high he raiseth up the poor Out of the Dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunk Hill amen he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children PR praise ye the Lord amen I'd like to take a scripture in St John chapter 16 strangely enough I had this scripture last week Sunday when I spoke on offenses and I didn't get to this scripture and I refrained from reading all of a quote on purpose because I just didn't I didn't take the time to read it and I'm going to do that this morning but in St John chapter 16 verse number one Jesus speaking to his disciples preparing them for what's to come said these things have I spoken unto you that ye should not be offended they shall put you out of synagogues yeah the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he doeth God a service and let's drop down to verse number 19 so Jesus goes into this dialogue he's talking to them about how he's going to be taken away and he's preparing them not to be offended could this this will happen and as they spoke among themselves in verse 19 and Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do you inquire among yourselves of that I said a little while ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me verily verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she rememberthe anguish for joy that a man is Born Into the world Amen we'll take one final scripture in Galatians chapter 4 Galatians Chapter 4 verses 26 but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is re is written Rejoice thou baren that bearest not break forth and cry that that trth not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath a husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free how many thank God for that we're not children of bondage we're children of Freedom title of the message this morning is the the true church is a true mother the true church is a true mother may God add a blessing to his word you may be seated um last week we spoke on a fence and being offended and that scripture in St John that we just read chapter 16 um was a scripture that I was going to read for you all and share that the Lord through his word prepares you so you don't walk around being offended all the time there's actually a quote I couldn't find it but it's in there he says brother bandam talks about people um um offending and being offended and that's the predicament brother ding wall sent me an email and reminded me of that and I was so well remember the quote I didn't pull it up but you know we talked about how offenses will come and people who are offended and hear Jesus is now speaking of this great offense and how he says I'm telling you this so you can prepare yourself so you're so you're not offended and I think and I believe my brothers and sisters that if I can grow spiritual enough be uh more mature Christian enough to where I wouldn't be so easily offended by people God bless you Sister Green good to see you praise the Lord You Look So Young next year's daughter there my my God bless you richly but you know this you know you if you can be mature enough to not be offended by every little thing even people do stuff on purpose even you might misread something but really you want to get to the place where none of those things move you because what happens when you are offended it throws you off of course of what you're supposed to be doing every one of us us should be zeroed in and focused on something but the enemy comes to throw us off of focus so he lets someone say something or treat us a certain way and it hurts us and it offends us but blessed are are you if you're not offended number one with the word but it's so nice when you can live a life above the offenses that will come we know they're going to come Jesus say so the Bible says so when they happen it doesn't make them hurt any less it doesn't minimize that they that they did happen yes it happened it was offensive but as a Believer as a Christian I cannot control other grown folks I can't control outside people what they're doing I don't control the rain or the weather whether it's windy I do not control whether I have a good hair day or not that's not in my control I woke up on a wrong side of the bed I don't feel like I'm just grumbling grumbling I can't control a lot of that but what I can't control I don't want to walk around where I'm just ready to be touched off just just somebody just touch him off touch her off watch like they the enemy's like watch this watch this watch me get them and we're like the little mionet or the little puppet and the devil playing strings against us we don't want to live that way we live above that amen it's not easy we're striving for it God help us amen but this is the quote I was I read part of it I didn't read all of it and it kind of goes with what happened down in nog Gala so I'll read it for the sake of those of you that were there because I think it goes real good paragraph 151 in the message questions and answer answers when you ministers are correcting someone about a gift when you're correcting them scripturally correcting them and they get offend remember it wasn't the spirit of God cuz the spirit of God cannot be offended by his word he comes to his word see he's always willing a real saint of God wants to tow the mark yes sir I want to be corrected I want the Holy Spirit to correct me and things that I'm doing that's wrong I don't want nothing substitutionary I want the real thing or nothing just let me alone don't let me have anything at all see because I'd rather do that then to bring a reproach on the Christ and I wouldn't teach anything and I wouldn't say anything bless the scripture dot dot dot and if some brother some Christian brother would see me teaching something wrong I'd appreciate it if you call me over to one side after the Serv service and say brother brandom I like to come to your room and talk to you you're an era upon something see I sure appreciate that brother because I want to be right I want it now all of us want to be right that's why we want we want to speak these things they got to come through the scripture you see to make the scripture tie together that's very helpful to me very beautiful uh to lay that in there so things happen there's a way to to deal with them so we don't want to be offended people that have the word in their life it's offense proof you know these naked women and people these vulgar signs and you know they they put stuff on bumper stickers is all crazy talking about this group and that group and they might even they they might talk about your class that you're rolling with all right and I might be on the bumper sticker but when you see that bumper sticker just say they ain't talking about me they're talking about somebody else don't get offended don't take it like that all people that live on the east are like this or everybody in this neighborhood are like that all the Democrats all the Republicans they ain't talking about me so I want to stay with the word and live above those approaches above those offenses the true church is a true mother you know this definition of a mother as I had looked it up and this time last year I spoke I think on Mother's Day I I normally bring out five mothers I think I added two more out of the message and I might have a chance to get to those mothers but that word mother means gave birth to an older definition is gave birth to female parent that's another older definition origin apparent so this uh is someone that gives birth to someone else a mother all of us here had one or we might currently have one and this position of mother I love the way brother random highlighted that in that Mother's Day message in Sunday school this morning how she's the first one that gets you and God gives her a special little touch and it was it was through this channel I I had spoken I believe last year maybe earlier this year on the position of a widow what a widow is or a widower and any married person can potentially become a widow or a widower like today like right now we don't think of it that way but that's the reality of it becoming a widow is something that happens to you you don't seek that out you don't you know try to achieve that that somebody dies out of that relationship man or woman and God uses this office of a widow when he wanted to manifest a third pool to the human beings he saw it in the animals we saw it in nature we saw it in the creation but now to the human beings he uses a widow sister Hatty right and not only a widow but she was a mother and she requested something that only a mother would request it really highlights it but this this pain shall be turned into joy and you mothers that had more than one or two or three children or just one and I was listening to this I think they call him priest a Catholic priest and he was talking about he was inv deed to go uh to the birth of his godson and so he's a priest he's not married in the Catholic church and he said he went to go see this event of somebody being born and he said the imagery that's imprinted eternally in his mind he can never he said he he was watching this birth take place and he actually passed out it was too much couldn't take it but it's so it's so much aart hard life that's how we all got here but we weren't aware when we were born we weren't conscious enough but we all went through a birth to be here but this pain that the woman goes through in her labor pains and then through all of the changes of course the impregnation then the series of body changes and then another life being formed and then she gives birth the pains the labor pains get so great and tremendous many times that some mothers don't make it through the whole birth process it's a very sensitive time it's a very you know it's life is coming in to the to the Earth through this birth but this pain being turned into Joy brother random takes this scripture in St John chapter 16 and preaches birth pains and he types that with the church and here Jesus now getting ready to leave and he's preparing his disciples for his leaving and going away and he types it with your pain shall be turned into Joy you know those mothers that have that first child should say you know I'll never do something like this again it was so painful I'll never go through this again and then you find them five years later with three or four kids it's like because they you forget because the Joy of having the baby after you have that child is so beautiful it's so nice it's beautiful but when you got to go through the Pains of it can be very very drastic and Jesus speaks of this and he brings these types we see it in the Bible here where in Israel the Lord is going to increase them and bless them through opening of the womb through making the woman fertile he's going to anoint them the mothers that we're going to grow this nation from within we're not going to we're not going to go proelite from the Egyptians and from the the amalekites and we don't we don't need to help build our numbers by going to another Nation but no these mothers are going to give birth and through the channels of birth God is going to bless them Deuteronomy chapter 7 verses 1 and two the scripture says when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whether thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee Hittites gites amorites Canaanites perizzites the hivites jebusites Seven Nations greater and mightier than thou and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee Thou shalt Smite them and utterly destroy them don't make any Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto them now remember all these nations had a head start on Israel because they were under a bondage and a very oppressive bondage they were slaying the male children it was very very harsh and very hard so this young tender little Nation now is going out on its own finally leaving Egypt going to make its own name build its own sanctuaries go and worship the way they want to worship under the leadership of the pillar of fire and the Lord says when you come into the land if you obey my voice verse 12 wherefore it shall come to pass if you hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the Covenant and the mercy which you swear unto your fathers and he will love thee and bless thee and what multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn thy wine thy oil the increase of thy kind the flocks of thy sheep in the land which I swear unto the fathers to give thee Thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female Barren among you among your cattle and the Lord will take away all the sicknesses and so forth you know this blessing of the Lord if you keep his judgments this is actually a blessing that a woman would have a child that the Lord would bless her with life but we're living in a time now and Jesus spoke of the day that they wouldn't want to have children and it's actually um a prophecy that he gives in Luke 23 if you turn there quickly in verse number 28 verse 27 there followed him a great company of people of the women which also bewell and lamented him this is his coming up to his crucifixion Jesus turning unto them and said Daughters of Jerusalem so he's speaking to the sisters he's speaking to the daughters he says weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wounds that never bear and the paps which never gave suck then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us now this is a prophecy that brother Brandon picks up in the message invisible Union of the bride of Christ and he picks this up in speaking of the day that people wouldn't want to Bear children yes some of the movie stars they'll adopt one right because it's cute it's popular they'll adopt one that don't even look like them they're go to one of these other countries and adopt one and I'm I'm all for adoption that's great but then but the day of them not wanting to Bear children not going not wanting to leave from being a girl to becoming a wife and from a wife to becoming a mother they they want to do they want to do their own thing but it's a prophecy speaking of the day that the women wouldn't want to have children anymore they want a cat they want a dog and furthermore now they want to be a cat or some kind of animal or whatever they won't have a baby they'll have a an animal and give that Lov and care to an animal there's nothing wrong with caring and loving an animal that's not what we're talking about we're talking about in Li of having a baby I'm talking about the attitude against being a mother that's what we're speaking of that's what Jesus is speaking of of the day that they wouldn't want to do that but I'm so glad that the true church is a type of a true mother what's a mother someone that has born a child someone that has gone through the birth the impregnation process and then born a child you know this barrenness was a curse in many instances of the Bible in the scriptures in um with with King David when his wife had laughed at him or scorned him for dancing in the spirit and second Samuel Samuel Michael was her name or Michelle however you would call it she scorned him and and the Lord uh pronounced bar Ness on her she couldn't bear a child it was like a curse and today many people would think that would be a blessing yes but not in the Bible days not scripturally in Genesis chapter 20 when aimik and had had taken Sarah from Abraham when God brought a curse upon aimik uh H he he he he caused all the women to to not be able to have any children that baren is struck this is in the natural what about in the spiritual what about a church that ain't bringing forth pastors teachers preachers what about a church that don't have nobody at the altar what about nobody coming through into the baptism of the Holy Ghost we should not be satisfied if somebody ain't weeping and Welling their way through the cross of Calvary coming to a new birth like Abel in the garden he grabbed that lamb he struck him down he strapped him up and then he took his life it was blood it was emotional it was terrible but it brought forth a revelation of what God wanted what about a true church today true church has baptisms taking place new people coming in somebody going to tell somebody else not just preaching to the same crowd every morning don't roll your eyes when a sinner comes in here you're supposed to see sinners in here you see a sinner come in here oh my we should be praising God if we see a sinner come into the house of the Lord Lord but many assemblies everybody turns and look cuz she's wearing pants where you think she's supposed to be she's supposed to be right here to hear the word of the lord we make it hard for the sinner or the newcomer because we're so caught up in our carnal ways they don't look like us they don't dress like us look how they dress look at this and look at that that's what we wanted that's why we're here something's wrong and we don't see that God sends them Sinners into this church and let them come through to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and be saved from their sins that's what a that's what a true church a true mother wants to have a baby she wants her womb to give forth this child proverbs 30 verse 15- 16 says this the horse Lea hath two daughters that cry give give there are three things that are never satisfied yes four things say not is it enough the grave the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire say it is it not enough can I add one in there let me just add one in there for my own self y'all can take it out later a church that don't have no folks crying out for Holy Ghost no new births children coming to the Lord it is Never Enough never yes sir see Sinners come rolling in here amen we should be looking for Sinners to come up in here sir amen because we're the children of the free now this mother is a type of not only um her body or type of the land that God was going to bless it's a type of the church also that the Lord wanted to bless Israel with numbers more people increase men increase the women increase the youth through the birth through the birth Channel and the Lord wants to increase the church through the same way now these are the labor pains now these labor pains are they're they're they're they're they they're stous they're hard they're um uh a mother can can tell more about that than I could I can only just you know read about it maybe or hear somebody talk about it but a mother how many mothers here knows what that those birth labor pains are that's okay don't help me out sisters it was Mother's Day if anybody's G to help me come on moms where you at the labor pains Mom right Mom yes labor pains and maybe that first child you probably said to yourself I will never do this again how many's ever said that maybe or thought it and then three years L you got three four maybe five because the memory of the pain goes away because a son is born all right a daughter is born and the labor pains to bring forth the child in the church there it gets hard sometime brother manam deals with this talking about um in the Hebrews and the message the ark he says I was reading the other day while sitting on a Creek Bank of how that those Hebrew mothers that gave birth back there to the Patriarchs and each one when she come forth uttered his name while in labor and said what he would be what he would be in the last days not knowing what she was doing and muttering taking a hold of Genesis 49 and type it where they're in time where they're at and watch what it is brother brandom continues in the message Revelation the book of symbols 1956 he says this here paragraph 59 watch all those names they mean something every name in the Bible when you see one name in the Bible it means something did you know Israel's wives when they gave birth to the 12 Patriarchs each one of those mothers when they were having the baby the baby was being born and them groaning the groans that they came out and named those boys and the Very groans that they give signify the nature of the child and the place they'd make their final resting place every Gran amen under the power of the Holy Ghost wow every gr grown under the power of the Holy Ghost these are the labor pains this mother Hebrew mother really speaking of uh uh Rachel and Leah they built the house and then their handmaids bah and the other uh secondary one they they built the house with these boys and in their labor pains they brought forth the name and this name I identify the child not only in the Homeland but even in eternity brother random says he says every groan it signify the nature of the child in the place that they make their final resting place every groan amen under the power of the Holy Ghost that's the reason we should be groaning in the spirit now I don't mean a lot of this put on but I mean really introvert Veil for the church then you can get some real speaking with tongues interpretation brother bam continues on in the message adoption number one paragraph number 48 he says this notice oh this just burns our heart each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh a great study if we can only get into the details get it in details which would take hours and hours someday when we get our church fixed I'd like to just come and take a solid month or two just stay right with it watch when they each one of those mothers when she called out Ephraim she was in labor positionally Place him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly every one of them wherever they were at Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being uh uh um being into the promis land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there how that God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside World Believing on the Lord Jesus so we we won't get persecuted from the outside world if we look like the world the only reason why Church get persecuted from the outside world is because we're doing contrary to what they are doing and they persecute you on the job they might not come here and persecute us here at this building they'll persecute you in the social group they'll persecute you at school you young people to serve the Lord and hold a standard 10 years old 12 years old 15 16 all the way up teenag and then in your 20s and then you're going to work and trying to live a life that will be pleasing to the Lord Jesus Christ the outside world will pressurize you and persecute you get in your 30s and 40s the world is still on your back 50s on up all the way through if you're trying to hold up what's right the world is after you to persecute you but these these groanings thr these persecutions are what's supposed to bring forth a birth with the apostles prophets teachers evangelists Ministries growing where's the next pastor at he might be in the Sunday school over there he might be sitting next to you Mom he might be somewhere here he might be in the neighborhood waiting for somebody to witness to his mama and his daddy yes absolutely and so the church mother she brings forth more children it's a birth that takes place and we the true church we're a type of a mother true mother is a type of a true church a mother gives birth to something what is this church giving birth birth to more criticism more critics what is this church giving birth to what is it bringing forth what is it standing for are we just in line with the rubber stamp just like another message church we just in line with one of 15 one of 14 whatever it is what kind of mother are you what kind of mother is this oh God have mercy upon us Lord Jesus let us come under that Agony and that labor to groan in the spirit to see the Holy Ghost fall one more time come through our building and touch us one more time break out the windows with the power of God one more time lord we need it our young people need it the old Saints need it your pastors and preachers need it all the mam need it all the daddies they need it a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost we need that in our in our Bible studies we need that in our daily devotions amen somebody we need it in our very life what kind of mother am I what kind of mother are you are you a real mother that's anointed and blessed bringing forth the birth God has set them in the church through the labor pains he continues on in this message as I was with Moses I'll be with thee 1960 paragraph 127 said the tribe of Joseph better than he did Judah but he didn't do it that way he divided it according to the word revealed by the spirit he divided according to tribe and notice he done it by the Revelation by discernment by the discernment of God's spirit he did it each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies that's paragraph 128 called their name and each one of their name has a meaning so brother Ram continues on in paragraph number 131 all right and I take my time here thank you paragraph 131 and when this great thing taking place when each one of these Hebrew mothers in travailing in childbirth called out like Ruben that placed him positionally in Palestine exactly the way that a mother said and called his name and said it I don't have it all wrote down here but say Ruben meant sheep herder Gad meant cattle Riser Ephraim meant corn raiser Now by spiritual discernment Joshua the new leader by spiritual discernment Place each one where he belong divided the land just exactly you know that's a that's a ministry right there knowing where you belong knowing what your name means spiritually speaking knowing what a revelation is to you not so much what other churches and people are doing not just questions and answers to argue you know some mental exercise but you positionally knowing where you belong that's what a mother that's what a true church is doing they're finding their position in this community he said well let's move to another place because it's nicer did you witness to the one you was in right yeah we in the wrong we in a bad neighborhood we in the wrong place well who brought you where you at can you survive where he raised you up or you got to go to a place that's already striving and and go make that work yes sir can you carve can you in the NBA they call it making and creating your own shot that's right anybody can shoot anybody can shoot but when two Defenders are on you and they know you going to shoot the ball can you create your own shot can you move and maneuver and sit this over here and move this over here and then pray for an hour and then that work pray for three hours get up Saturday and I'm start on Friday I'm just move what you I'm creating a shot because I'm gonna survive right here God called me to be right here and that's where I'll survive that's where I'll Thrive that's where I'll be fruitful in the land that God gave me not looking at somebody else's trees and finding out like lot did and lot said oh it's Greener over there let's go over there no make it happen right here A True Believer all he need is God on his side all he need is one or two scriptures and the anointing in his life and he'll make it work he'll make it work God will work it out in his life amen praise the Lord oh my yes finding your place finding your position Joshua placed them and give them that spiritual discernment now these mothers had a tremendous part in their life they um they named them under this struggle between two sisters Leah wanted Jacob's love Rachel wanted Jacob's children and that stress and that rub and that that going back and forth with my sister and the labor pains get so great sometimes did you you all know that part of the reason that we have this air conditioning today is because one of our friends in the neighborhood stole the old one I called them hyenas brother George I corrected that I said they're not hyenas no there are friends that we need to go witness to but we got on it real quick didn't we brother Chris we got on here quick why did it happen so quick because somebody stole the old unit that we was squeezing out all the AC we can get out of it so if you're going to go thank somebody go out here and find one of these homeless people whoever stole the O unit and go thank them sometimes you need to thank the enemies that criticize you because your enemies keep you on your knees if everybody loved you you wouldn't have a prayer life but thank God we got some enemies that keeps you on your knees keeps you crying out to God asking God to have mercy yes through the labor pains through the birth through the the stress through the struggle then it brings forth yes a new air conditioning un it brings forth life amen man this is what it is brother brandom brings that out oh so well now this type how he brings it to the church now I just want to close with this here get to one one more of these mothers in Matthew chapter 20 and verse 23 let turn there quickly Matthew chapter 20 verse number 20 we remember this sister we don't know her name we just know her children's name then came to him the mother of zebede children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him now if this was a minister watch out Minister what you would ask ask for single mom or single guy what would you ask for but this is a mother Desiring a certain thing of him and he said unto her what wil thou she said unto him grant that these my two sons May sit the one on the right hand and the other one on the left in thy kingdom but Jesus answered and said ye know not what you ask are you able to drink the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I I am baptized with they say unto him we are able and he said unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I'm baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them who is prepared for you know what's interesting about this question is is my mind says what inspired this mother to ask this where's she getting this from ain't nobody else asking for it you know there's another recording where she asks for it and all the disciples get mad at at her and her and her two sons and the two sons like that's my mom I mean I didn't ask my mom was asking why was what is this Mom asking for why would she ask for this only a mother thinks like this a preacher would be like Lord can I sit on can I sit on your right hand or left hand I prefer the right but if not the right I'll can I sit on the left hand but not a mother a mother is Desiring a position for her two sons this is a mother that's thinking about you know moms have the coldest meals most of the time that's right because everybody else eats first mom has a stress and a strain that's in her that cares about her children will go heads up with a bear or a lion to save her babies that's a mother's love and this mother moved over it it looked carnal it looked carnal but it really was a spiritual question that she's asking she says can my son sit at your right hand and left hand she's saying can my sons sit where the Overcomers are going to sit Paul or Peter didn't ask Timothy none of the other ones asked this but this mother asked this question and with this question brought forth an answer that would speak to a different generation our age for the Overcomer that overcomes they will be the ones that will sit there brother Brandon picks it up in the message how can I overcome in verse in paragraph number 56 watch the Overcomer is promise see now leod deia that's the last Church age there's going to be some Overcomers in there watch here they remember each Church age the one preceding it inherits all that the other ones offered watch up here here it's after they done received all these Powers these new names everything written then he's promised to eat the hidden man all the way down through watch this last Church age Revelations 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant a sit with me in my Throne amen even as I also overcome and has sat down with my father in his throne he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches there's a reward for Overcomers press on Lily if it's in you lay aside the mud and that everything else and press towards the top to sit with me in my Throne you know one time the mother of James and John's we won't have time to read it the mother of James and John came and asked for this place you know that remember that Lord let my son set on one side and my other son set on the other there's a mother's desire for her son you mothers know what that is the desire for your son for your daughter you want the best for them for your family for your children amen and we know that God is anointing his church that's accepted the seed of life the word of life it has impregnated that church with the word the message of the hour if if we're listening to the tapes then our life should be producing our churches Ministries everything should be producing what's on the tapes absolutely yes sir can I get a witness yes sir amen if we're really feeding on it and and and got got the word of the hour then we would have the love that it talks about and the and the tenacity that it is explained that it that it uh expressed and the validity and the the truth of it it will all be in our life because we're feeding on that word and if we have a child it's going to look like what's on them [Music] tapes is that right Saints so here we are listening to a tape it's all fired up people shouting praising God anointing going on and then you fast forward to 2024 folks in the seat sleeping right can't wake up can't praise the Lord running late ain't there maybe I'll be there maybe I won't they ain't listening to the message I'm sorry all right they can't be you know the tree by what the fruit that it Bears that's how you know what kind of tree it is so we look at the the fruits of it and God has giv this true church this true mother these responsibilities those responsibilities are what brother random calls a sacred trust he said what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman paragraph 101 in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ I'll just take this one here quickly responsibility to a woman now see why she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her mother Hood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer into what the word and to what to Christ just the same as the woman has so as a church our responsibility is prayer the word and Christ which is the anointing that's what we're standing on that's what we're founded upon that's how we get popular right that's how we make our name yes sir this describes Who We Are by how we are responsible in our prayer life we are responsible how we handle the word we are responsible to the Lord Jesus Christ he's the head of our life and we serve him reverently and very seriously with the utmost attention every detail every word every moment will be accounted for we don't do this on the side this is our very life it's to the prayer it's to the word and it is to Christ that's the Lord Jesus Christ that's a true mother that's the mother the free mother the mother of us all Amen brother bandam takes this scripture I'll close here right here just one service brother George said if I keep going stop him don't roll your eyes at me get brother George so we preachers we watch out for one another if you watch that he giv me more time because he want more time is that right brother Bonza yes sir all right the prophet takes Luke chapter 23 and he deals with this scripture in verse number 28 talking about the day coming wasn't that day that Jesus spoke it but the day will come when they will say the days are coming in which they say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never be be and the peps which never gave up think of a service and just spiritualize that or bring a type to that what kind of service I mean we would highlight that service a beautiful service it didn't get too loud the temperature was just right we didn't get out too late I didn't mess my hair up and everything was nice in everybody everybody behaved everybody behaved bless it are the day when they will say where there is no births in the church nobody screamed nobody cried nobody ran over nothing nobody lost their mind somebody needs to lose their mind somebody needs to be set on fire and come running through here on fire because God changed their life ain't no true mother if that ain't taking place can't be a true mother if the birth ain't taking place amen God bless you mothers God bless you true mothers but brother mam takes us in paragraph number the message invisible Union paragraph number 121 he says this speaking of the day that when women wouldn't no more want children they want a dog or cat or something like that but she don't want children anymore why she's old mother Hubbert if she has a child she didn't don't want that's the remarks of Hollywood they don't want his woman to be a old mother hub so he'll he'll have some operation performed on himself or her or one that'll keep them from having children they don't want no children Jesus spoke of it what did he say the time they'll be to cry for the rocks in the mountain to fall on us she'll practice birth control she can so she can go to parties she can't be bothered with the baby nursing her it'll disform her when she's pregnated it'll be it'll disform her she won't look like she used to and her husband ignorant enough to let her go that way she won't give him a Child Jesus spoke of it he said that when they were doing this at that time they're going to crying in for the rocks to fall on them it's coming of the Lord they pay great sums of money for cats dogs to mother just must mother something because it's a god-given nature brother bandom talks about how paragraph 131 a true picture of the modern church today yes neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking let me say something here let me let me say something here I I if you're a quiet person yes and somebody screams out and shouts in your ear let's be honest that's annoying yes it's aggravating yes because you maybe you were sleep and it shook you whatever what what is that but but reverse it when you've had your moments too though what about when you when you was happy what about your moments that you have that emotional Burst when it happens to you tell me you can control it you can't control your emotions something's twisting your heart and then those tears begin to roll out of your heart those are your emotions because something is taking place and the modern Church don't want that taking place because it's out of order it's not controlled but we the true church we want that amen we don't want to make it up but we we want it amen well we want is we want the fire of God to fall like just wipe a whole Pew out like start all the way across and then sweep then sweep back through and catch the next one and you swing through and catch every one of these pews and bless the children of God with the presence of God that's what the that's what we that's what the church wants amen yes sir and brother of types that modern women with the modern church but we thank God we're not that modern church amen how many thank God we got this message that we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free that's them out there not us in here we having babies all the time another baby another baby another one another one we want that cry room full of mothers spiritually speaking one them laboring at the altar laboring in their seat laboring with the word taking that message that God sent seriously handling in it it's the word of life and producing it in her life amen God richly bless you but the spiritual thought thought that this son this mother of zebede had to ask that question it brings us into what sister hady right asked for I talked about those mothers before um the mother in Finland the Spanish Mother Down In Mexico that had the dead baby the mother in Memphis that had the son that gone out into the world and she had prayed for him and he's out in the world dying with the disease yes sir and she prayed and brought the prophet to her neighborhood and then uh then the the little Finnish mother who who those two boys were killed in a car accident there in Finland and I think that mother is about 25 years old brother brandham says and that that one boy had a vision over his life and brother brandham looked through his Bible said this is a vision and called his life back there's two boys called his life back and the mother of the one that didn't get called back she wanted to know why and and he's trying to explain to her the team is trying to explain to her sister that was a vision are you a Christian no I'm not a Christian well why don't you be a Christian and maybe God will hear your prayer and she says okay I'll become a Christian okay she became a Christian now go raise up my baby you're like no sis it don't work that way I got to see a vision well go see one that's right she wasn't moving this is Mom because because he did it for one if he did it for one Glory if he can do it for one he can do it for me too and he can do it again and again and again she wasn't even a Christian knew nothing about it but she walked in those channels she stayed with them calling and pressuring the prophet is you the prophecy of vision and God sent the prophet a vision of her boy too and brother Brandon says the mother's prayer saved the child that's what he said the mother's prayer saved that child one had a vision one had a mother that mother moved on God glory that mother wouldn't move she stayed right with it stayed right with it praying for her baby and the Holy Spirit sent a vision to the prophet said go call that mother amen that's the god that we serve we think of sister Hattie R how she was a widow but she was a mother when the Holy Spirit came down into her room and dealt with her dealt with the prophet telling the stories of what was going on and she said that's nothing but the truth and then the opportunity came for her to request now if it was a preacher or Pastor or maybe a pastor would say you know what would I request all I requested you know maybe our church would grow we get our we need a building we we request whatever we would request all right but this mother she requested the greatest thing and brother Rand says God knew she would ask for amen so sister hadie ask what you will to be given to your sister you have money your parents are broke down to can restore their youth their health back to them and what did she ask where she did like James and John's mother did she she she went into the realm of the spiritual things
