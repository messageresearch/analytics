[0:09] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[0:14] We'll open up in a word of prayer.
[0:17] Heavenly Father, we're thankful to be
[0:19] here this morning. Lord, to hear what
[0:22] you have for us, Father. Lord, as we
[0:25] continue with this Philadelphiaian
[0:27] church age, we pray, Father, that as
[0:30] they were told, they said you told them
[0:33] if they kept the word of your patience,
[0:35] you would keep them from the hour of
[0:37] temptation that would come upon the
[0:39] whole world, those that lived on the
[0:41] earth. Father, Lord, let that be our
[0:43] testimony, Father. Lord, that you'd keep
[0:46] us in all in every way that we have
[0:48] need. Father, help us to hear what the
[0:51] spirit would say unto the churches. We
[0:53] we take that ourselves, Father. We have
[0:56] ears to hear, Lord. So, open our ears,
[0:59] Father. And Lord, let us absorb. Let us
[1:02] be a part of, Father, what you want us
[1:04] to know today. And Lord, for the
[1:07] children's Sunday school class, those
[1:09] that may be on the way, we pray your
[1:11] safety. We pray your blessing on it all
[1:14] that everything that would be said and
[1:16] done in this church today. In the name
[1:18] of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen.
[1:22] We'll be starting at paragraph 107 and
[1:25] we'll end after paragraph 145 and this
[1:28] is from Revelation chapter 3 7-13.
[1:33] Can we sing only believe and acapella's
[1:38] good but piano is even better. Amen.
[1:51] Only
[1:53] believe.
[1:57] Only believe.
[2:02] All things are possible.
[2:06] Only
[2:08] believe.
[2:12] Only
[2:13] believe.
[2:17] Only
[2:19] believe.
[2:22] All things are possible
[2:27] only.
[2:30] [Music]
[2:32] You may be seated, brother Brennan.
[2:36] Then when we got out of the city is
[2:38] amazing thing. I seen a a field out
[2:41] there and some man laying around and
[2:43] they had donkeys and cows and pigs and
[2:47] sheep and goats and everything out
[2:50] there. And I said, "Well, what's them
[2:52] guys out there?" He said, "Shepherds."
[2:54] And I said, "A shepherds hering
[2:57] donkeys." And he said, "Yes, sir." Well,
[3:00] I said, "I I thought shepherd just meant
[3:02] sheep." He said, "No, shepherd is a
[3:04] herder, grazer. Over your country, they
[3:06] call them cowboys and and things like
[3:09] that." Oh, I see. A shepherd is a
[3:12] herder. Yes. He watches the herd. That's
[3:15] right. He said the strange thing is at
[3:18] night time where you striking you being
[3:21] a minister, I might tell you something.
[3:23] He said when night time comes, it's
[3:25] true. He pastors every one of them,
[3:27] leads them around and helps them and see
[3:29] if they get good things to the day. But
[3:31] when nighttime comes, the all the the
[3:35] mules and the donkeys and the the camels
[3:38] and whatever he's got is left out into
[3:41] the field. But he rounds up the sheep
[3:44] and takes them to the corral.
[3:48] Oh, I said, "Lord, make me a sheep,
[3:51] whatever you do."
[3:53] Or when the nighttime comes,
[3:57] I want to go into the sheepfold. Amen.
[4:00] entering at the door. Come by the door.
[4:04] John 17 uh7 you're he said I am 10:7
[4:10] rather he said I am the door to the
[4:12] sheep oh all that ever come before me is
[4:14] thieves and robbers but the sheep did
[4:17] not hear them I am the door by me if any
[4:21] man enters in he shall be saved and
[4:25] shall go in and out and find pasture.
[4:28] Now I set before this church between the
[4:33] Philadelphia age and the lady overseeing
[4:35] age a
[4:38] door.
[4:40] Oh, do you get it now? Got your thinking
[4:44] caps on real good and tight?
[4:47] Listen now. This is good. I tell you
[4:49] it's honey in a rock. Just get them
[4:51] nuggets out and shine them up. I am the
[4:54] door to the sheepfold.
[4:57] What is that door that was set? Now
[4:59] let's go back in our minds and from that
[5:01] great missionary age of the Methodist
[5:05] and swept through the country with the
[5:07] message of sanctification. Luther
[5:10] through justification. Wesley come along
[5:13] with the message of sanctification.
[5:16] And at the end of the Methodist age, the
[5:20] end tough roots and begin to come a
[5:23] great organization. And when any church,
[5:27] now listen, that's strong.
[5:30] But I want someone to show me anywhere
[5:33] through the gleanings of history, any
[5:35] church that God ever raised up, come up
[5:40] the Pentecostal way without any
[5:43] organization. And as soon as it
[5:45] organized, it died. Amen. And never
[5:49] raised again. Amen.
[5:52] Oh, the membership went on. But they
[5:54] never had a revival. Amen. Luther's
[5:57] revival never raised and neither did
[5:59] Methodist revival ever raised. And
[6:01] neither will a Pentecostal revival ever
[6:03] raised. No sir, they organized it which
[6:07] God said in the church ages. He hates
[6:10] that thing. A doctrine of the nickels.
[6:14] Now remember, we're not talking against
[6:16] anybody. That good people is scattered.
[6:19] God's sheep is in all places out there.
[6:22] That is true.
[6:24] That's right. Methodists, Baptists,
[6:26] whatever they are, they're God's people.
[6:28] If they are born again of the spirit of
[6:30] God, they're God's people. But the
[6:33] organizations has cranked them down and
[6:36] packed letter from Methodist Baptist to
[6:38] Camelite and so forth. So they wore the
[6:41] letters out, just packed it from place
[6:43] to place. All right.
[6:46] How the Lord said now at the end of that
[6:49] age, I am the door to the sheepfold. Now
[6:52] what door was opened about Jesus just
[6:56] between these two ages?
[6:59] 196
[7:01] about when the Methodist age and and and
[7:04] Dwight Moody and them faded from the
[7:07] scene there come forth a break forth of
[7:10] the people receiving the Holy Ghost
[7:12] speaking with tongues and things come
[7:13] back into the church. It's about right
[7:16] in about 196 along in there. All right.
[7:20] What took place then after that be to
[7:23] come along the first thing you know they
[7:25] organized the old general council which
[7:27] went in now called the assemblies of
[7:29] God. Amen. See of that church that was
[7:33] left over. And what taken place then? He
[7:36] said an open door.
[7:40] An open door. Let's just read it now.
[7:43] Catch it word by word just the way he
[7:45] brings it thing. Behold, let's see. No
[7:48] man shutth before thee an open door.
[7:50] Show this side. I know thy works.
[7:53] Behold, I set before thee an open door
[7:57] and no man can shut it a open door. What
[8:00] was it? It was the revelation
[8:04] of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ.
[8:09] Not being a second person of a trinity,
[8:12] but being God himself made flesh and
[8:14] dwelling among us. And the revelation,
[8:17] if you notice just a minute, let's just
[8:18] read just a little bit farther. Shut it.
[8:21] Has a little strength and has not denied
[8:23] my name. The first time the name's been
[8:27] spoke of now since back in this age back
[8:29] here. Amen. Lost his name. And Luther
[8:31] come out with a name that he was alive
[8:33] and was dead. Amen. Is that right?
[8:36] Father, Son, Holy Ghost. Here comes out
[8:38] the name of Jesus again in between these
[8:41] two ages here. Amen. Amen. in between
[8:44] the open door. Now it's a revelation
[8:48] what he was the deity the revelations of
[8:51] his. Now that's what he revealed at the
[8:55] very first church age. Now watch as John
[8:59] saw him standing the seven golden
[9:01] candlesticks. He was standing with his
[9:03] hands out. Here's the first candlestick.
[9:06] Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
[9:09] seventh. with his hands out in the form
[9:11] of the cross. He said, "I am alpha
[9:16] and omega." Amen. In other words, I'll
[9:21] be supreme in the first. I'll be supreme
[9:25] in the last.
[9:28] The light rises in the east and sets in
[9:31] the west. It's been a dismal dark time,
[9:33] but it shall be light in the evening
[9:36] time. The same gospel power that raised
[9:40] up here on the one hand at the east has
[9:44] shined over and now in the other hand at
[9:46] the west.
[9:48] Alpha and omega. I'm A and I am Z in his
[9:54] hand. You get it? Amen. Now what did he
[9:57] do in the first chapter of Revelations?
[9:59] He revealed his supreme deity to the
[10:04] first church Ephesus. Is that right?
[10:06] Amen. But I notice every one of these
[10:09] churches coming down the new year, he
[10:11] revealed himself in deity only in his
[10:14] glorified form. But on this last one, he
[10:18] becomes Z back to the original beginning
[10:21] again. Say the first and the last, the
[10:25] first age, now the last age. For he
[10:28] said, I am the first and the last. And
[10:32] but you say, how did that happen? What
[10:34] followed that forth? It was a
[10:36] revelation. Many of you received it
[10:39] because his in I'm going to say
[10:42] something now. Look, his entire church
[10:47] is built upon divine revelations of
[10:50] himself.
[10:52] Amen. Is that right? You don't believe
[10:54] that? Let's turn to Matthew 16:18.
[10:57] You'll see just in a minute that the
[10:59] whole revelation is built upon himself.
[11:02] his whole church is built upon the
[11:05] revelations of himself.
[11:09] Now let's begin here
[11:12] uh at the
[11:14] let's begin let's say about the 14th
[11:18] verse
[11:19] then they said some say thou art John
[11:22] the Baptist the question Jesus said un
[11:25] of course the sister of Philippi and
[11:27] asked his disciples saying who do a man
[11:29] say I the son of man am 13th verse and
[11:33] that's 16:13 now and they said now watch
[11:36] here's the first place of the church
[11:38] Jesus Jesus ever spoke of in the on into
[11:41] the revelations is an at last.
[11:45] And he said, "Some say thou art John the
[11:47] Baptist and some Elias and others
[11:51] Jeremiah
[11:52] and other and and are one of the
[11:55] prophets." He said unto them, the whole
[11:59] entire group, "But whom say ye that I
[12:02] am?" And Simon Peter answered and said,
[12:04] "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[12:07] living God." Amen. Oh my. And Jesus
[12:10] answered and said unto him, "Blessed art
[12:12] thou, Simon Simon
[12:15] uh Barjonas, flesh and blood has not
[12:18] revealed this to thee, but my father
[12:21] which is in heaven." Oh my. You never
[12:26] got this from a seminary. There was no
[12:28] other way you ever got this, Simon the
[12:30] son of Jonas. The only way you got it
[12:33] was a spiritual revelation that was
[12:35] revealed to you from heaven that I am
[12:37] he. Jesus said, "If you don't believe
[12:40] I'm he, you'll die in your sins."
[12:43] I am he. I say unto thee, thou art
[12:46] Peter, upon this rock I'll build my
[12:50] church, and the gates of hell can't
[12:52] prevail against me. What is it?
[12:54] Spiritual.
[12:57] Spiritual. The spiritual truth. the word
[13:01] of the Lord. Now, we find out that in
[13:05] this great revelation that God gave here
[13:09] to the church in its last days
[13:12] that God sent and revealed to himself
[13:15] the open door between the two ages. It
[13:19] wasn't in the the lady of CN age.
[13:21] Neither was it in this other age, the
[13:24] Philadelphiaian age, but it was in
[13:27] between the lapover called the I'll
[13:29] prove it just a little further down.
[13:31] You'll get it. You see? Well, make it
[13:33] just so sure that you can't keep from
[13:35] seeing it if you just want to see it.
[13:37] See? All right.
[13:40] Now, the revelation of himself is where
[13:42] he's built his church. How many knows
[13:44] that to be true now? Amen. He built his
[13:47] church upon the revelation of himself.
[13:52] All right. Now,
[13:57] what did he say?
[14:01] No man can shut it. Amen. Amen. I know I
[14:05] work. Behold, I set before thee an open
[14:08] door. What is the open door? The
[14:10] revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus
[14:13] Christ. Amen. What did he say to his
[14:15] first church back here back in this age?
[14:17] He said, "I am he that was, which is,
[14:20] and shall come. I am the first and the
[14:23] last. I am the Almighty."
[14:26] He said it three different times. Made
[14:28] himself deity to this first church here.
[14:31] Before he went into the last church age,
[14:33] he said, "I set before you an open
[14:36] door." If you want to see the
[14:38] revelation, here it is. Amen. Where you
[14:41] build this church. And the only way he
[14:43] could take his church is back to the
[14:44] revelation of what he is. Amen. Amen.
[14:47] Truly.
[14:49] Look,
[14:52] when Abraham
[14:54] made a covenant, God made a covenant
[14:56] with Abraham
[14:58] that day that he said, "How will these
[15:00] things be sealed? I'm old and my only
[15:02] heir is is this uh uh Damascus servant
[15:06] I've got here." Ezar said, "I'm old. You
[15:08] promised me a child. How will you do it?
[15:11] How will it be done? And remember, he
[15:14] went to sleep. A deep sleep fell upon
[15:17] him like every man does. Death. And then
[15:20] he noticed before he went a a smoking
[15:22] furnace. Every sinner deserves to go to
[15:25] hell. He had killed the beast, a heer, a
[15:29] sheep, a goat, and a ram, and a turtle
[15:32] dove, and a pigeon. He never separated
[15:34] the turtle dove and pigeon. And then
[15:36] this little white light went before
[15:38] there and went back and forth between
[15:41] these cut pieces of animal confirming
[15:44] the covenant with Abraham. Now in Japan,
[15:47] if there happens to be a Japanese person
[15:49] here, you know how they make a covenant
[15:51] in Japan? They throw salt on one
[15:53] another. Get a little crucial salt and
[15:55] sit down there. They talk, will you do
[15:56] so and so? Yeah, I'll do so and so. And
[15:58] they make a covenant, get some salt and
[15:59] throw it on one because salt is a
[16:01] preserver. See? All right. They throw
[16:04] salt on one another. That's a covenant
[16:06] in America. How we make a covenant here,
[16:08] we say, "Well, will you do a certain
[16:10] thing? I'll do a certain thing." First
[16:11] thing you know, we shake one of those
[16:12] hands, shake on it. That's a covenant.
[16:15] But in the orient, the way they made a
[16:17] covenant, they wrote up something and
[16:19] they wrote out a contract and they
[16:21] killed a beast in the time of Abraham.
[16:23] They cut that beast open and stood in
[16:25] between it, wrote this contract and tore
[16:27] it like this. One tuck one piece and one
[16:30] the other. And then they stuck an oath
[16:33] that let their bodies be like this dead
[16:35] beast if they fail to keep this
[16:36] contract. And now the only way that this
[16:39] contract can ever be you can never
[16:41] duplicate it. It's got to come right
[16:43] back exactly the same thing joined
[16:45] together. Now what was God showing
[16:48] Abraham what he's going to do? That he
[16:50] was going to take Abraham's seed through
[16:54] Isaac down to Jesus. Amen. and he took
[16:57] him up on Calvary and there he tore him
[17:00] apart.
[17:02] He tore the spirit out of him away from
[17:04] the body. He raised up the body and set
[17:07] it on the right hand of the man on high
[17:09] and sent back the Holy Spirit to the
[17:12] church. That's the covenant of God
[17:14] apart. We got the spirit. He's got the
[17:16] body. Amen. And when he comes back
[17:18] together, the spirit is in us joins with
[17:20] him as bride. Amen. Not any denomination
[17:24] hooked into it at all. Amen. No sir,
[17:26] it's purely unadulterated Holy Spirit
[17:29] birth. That's all. Amen. That's the
[17:31] covenant. Now,
[17:33] now we find out that he said, "I set
[17:35] before you an opened door." Now, I don't
[17:38] care how many manmade organizations
[17:40] comes up for denominations. Even the
[17:42] gates of hell can't shut it.
[17:46] Only one way to be to join it. That's
[17:48] all. You can't join it. So, it has to be
[17:50] born into it. time. So there's nobody
[17:54] can ever stop that message of supreme
[17:58] deity in the baptism in the name of
[18:00] Jesus Christ. The gates of hell will
[18:02] never prevail against it. You say, "How
[18:04] do you know it's right?" It's exactly
[18:06] with the word and no one else can say
[18:08] nothing about it.
[18:10] Exactly. It's the word. No place where
[18:13] anybody's baptized. Name of Father, Son,
[18:15] Holy Ghost. This great St. Paul, the
[18:18] angel of Ephesus, commissioned every
[18:20] person that had not been baptized, no
[18:21] matter how you've been baptized. If you
[18:24] never been baptized in the name of Jesus
[18:25] Christ, he commissioned to come and be
[18:27] baptized over again in the name of Jesus
[18:29] Christ. He said, "If an angel from
[18:31] heaven comes teaching anything else, let
[18:33] him be a cursed."
[18:35] So you can see what the angel comes in
[18:37] this last days, what kind of message
[18:38] he's going to have when he comes out. We
[18:40] may be leading it up to him, but I'm
[18:42] telling you, when he comes, he'll preach
[18:44] the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ.
[18:46] You don't need you come around tomorrow
[18:48] night. Let's show you through the
[18:48] scripture. He certainly will. And the
[18:51] circumcision of the heart and divine
[18:53] miracles and workings of powers just
[18:55] like they had on the day of Pentecost.
[18:56] The very original Pentecostal blessing
[18:59] will come right back to that little
[19:00] remnant. If they take it up down, that
[19:02] contract will be just exactly like it
[19:04] was when I off in the first place.
[19:07] Oh, I love you.
[19:09] I'm so glad. So glad. I I can't express
[19:13] it hard enough. I'm so glad that I can
[19:16] say I'm one. I'm so glad. I just wish
[19:18] all my brethren was like that. I just
[19:21] wish that I could have my brothers and
[19:23] sisters out here. My precious friends
[19:25] out in the world to see this great
[19:26] thing. I I I would I'd be willing
[19:29] tonight. God knows this. I got a little
[19:31] boy, Joseph, raising a little girl,
[19:32] Sarah Rebecca. A lovely wife that I hate
[19:35] to leave. But if I know that my brethren
[19:38] across the people that I know in this
[19:39] world could accept that and believe it,
[19:41] be filled with the Holy Ghost, I'd be
[19:42] ready to go right now. Exactly right.
[19:46] Oh, if I could just And you can't. If
[19:48] you talk gentle, they think like you're
[19:50] trying to put something over on them and
[19:52] and there's only one thing to do. That's
[19:54] stay right with the word and nail it
[19:56] down. That's exactly right. Stay right
[19:58] with it.
[20:01] Oh, how I love him.
[20:05] a revelation of himself, his supreme
[20:08] deity. What did he do it? Just can't
[20:11] leave it somehow.
[20:13] He revealed it in the church of Ephesus.
[20:15] Is that right? And that was when the
[20:18] light first broke through the shine of
[20:19] the Christian light. Is that right? The
[20:21] Holy Ghost age started right here at
[20:23] Ephesus. And the prophet said there
[20:25] would come a day that wouldn't be night
[20:27] or day, but in the evening the light
[20:29] would come back again.
[20:33] You see it? Amen.
[20:36] See this day of dismal come across
[20:38] through all this your dismal
[20:39] organizations and everything but in the
[20:41] last days over here way down here he'd
[20:45] set that open door. Jesus said I'm that
[20:47] door. Amen. Did you ever hear him say,
[20:49] "I am the gate. I am the way." Amen. The
[20:54] truth and the life. See, did you ever
[20:57] hear him say, "Straight is the gate."
[20:59] Amen. And narrow is the way. Did you
[21:02] ever notice how that straight was

[51:32] traveling. So hold up one another in
[51:34] prayer this morning as we go to heaven.
[51:37] Dear God, we're so thankful to be in
[51:38] church. We see the signs of the times,
[51:41] Lord. We know that Israel is the time
[51:43] piece, Brother Ben Renham said. And so
[51:44] it makes us just know that you're coming
[51:46] soon. We want to be ready, Lord. So we
[51:49] come to church to worship you and then
[51:50] that you'd speak to our hearts. May our
[51:52] ears be open to hear from heaven this
[51:54] morning. Something for ourselves,
[51:55] something we could take home, something
[51:57] to inspire and courage, give us courage,
[51:59] Lord, for the journey, for uh the
[52:01] testimony of our co-workers and those
[52:04] around us we might be able to share the
[52:05] gospel with. Lord, we pray for courage
[52:07] for those opportunities that we could be
[52:10] a light in this late hour. Lord, we're
[52:12] so thankful you've placed us here.
[52:14] You've given us your perfect word, Lord.
[52:17] And
[52:19] maybe just live that sermon, Lord, that
[52:21] billboard of the gospel today. We miss
[52:24] Sister Lori, Brother Bob and their
[52:26] families. Know that brother Tim took a
[52:28] spell. Amalong, Lord. And we pray you
[52:30] just continue to heal him and bless him,
[52:32] his family. These traveling, we miss
[52:35] them each one. We commit them to you,
[52:36] Lord. Our families, those still out and
[52:39] about, maybe in the world, Lord, that
[52:41] need to come in. We pray for mercy for
[52:43] time for those, but let us get cleaned

[52:52] gospel is our prayer. Love you and thank
[52:54] you in Jesus precious and wonderful
[52:56] name. All God's people say amen.
[53:02] Amen. Brother Joe had mentioned our
[53:04] friend Tim Amalong.
[53:07] Tim and I have been friends since
[53:08] elementary school. Kings were talking to
[53:10] us about that. How did you and Tim
[53:11] become friends? We used to ride the
[53:12] school bus together to the Christian
[53:14] school that Tucson Tabernacle had
[53:16] growing up. And Tim and I have been good
[53:18] friends over the years. And so the Lord
[53:21] was merciful to him. He's got a long
[53:23] road to recovery. He had a fall off of
[53:26] his fuel tanker truck on Thursday
[53:29] morning, fell over backwards, hit his
[53:32] head. Um he fractured his C1 vertebrae
[53:36] at the base of the neck. And so he's
[53:39] he's uh in a neck brace now and will be
[53:42] in that for 6 to 8 weeks and they're
[53:44] just uh believing he won't have to have
[53:46] surgery on it. So just continue to keep
[53:48] him in prayer. It's a just what I've
[53:50] been through. What I can't do that I'd
[53:52] like to do over the last 6 to 8 weeks.
[53:55] I've had full mobility for the most
[53:57] part, but Tim's not going to be able to
[53:59] to move his head up, down, sideways. So
[54:02] just keep him in prayer. Keep Stephanie
[54:04] in prayer. The whole family. So amen.
[54:07] God is is good. He's faithful. Amen.
[54:10] Let's sing that chorus if we could. Who
[54:12] I am, Lord. Oh, glorious victory.
[54:17] Oh, glorious victory.
[54:21] That day he set me free
[54:24] and made my heart
[54:28] his very throne.
[54:32] My life is no longer mine.
[54:36] I'm a prisoner of love divine.
[54:40] And now I live
[54:42] [Music]
[54:43] to praise his name.
[54:47] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[54:51] Who I am.
[54:55] Oh, I can see now
[54:58] just who I am.
[55:02] A part of my savior,
[55:06] a part of his word.
[55:10] It's a revelation
[55:14] of who I am.
[55:17] On Calvary, he died
[55:21] to redeem his lost bride.
[55:25] The king of kings
[55:29] became my savior.
[55:33] This is God's great mystery
[55:37] of love expressed to me
[55:40] that Christ had died
[55:44] might be made one.
[55:48] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[55:52] Who I am.
[55:56] Oh, I can see now
[55:59] just who I am.
[56:03] A part of my savior,
[56:07] a part of his word.
[56:11] It's a revelation.
[56:13] [Music]
[56:15] It's predestination.
[56:18] It's a revelation
[56:22] of who I am.
[56:28] Amen. You can be seated as you'd like.
[56:30] We'll sing a chorus before our pastor
[56:32] comes out and just let the musicians
[56:34] continue to play after we've sung the
[56:36] song. He brought me out of the miry
[56:37] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[56:40] stay. My heart was distressed Jehovah's
[56:45] dread crown.
[56:47] Though in the pit where my sins drag me
[56:51] down, I cried to the Lord from the deep

[57:47] grace until that crown I gave. Oh, he
[57:52] brought me out of the merry clay. Oh, he
[57:58] set my feet on the rock to stay.

[58:34] redeemer who has rescued me. for he
[58:39] brought me out of the mighty land. Yes,

[59:19] shall hear the truth and trust in God.

[59:30] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[59:36] He puts a song in my soul today. It's a
[59:41] song of praise. Let's sing that chorus
[59:45] together one more time. Oh, he brought
[59:48] me out of the mighty thing.

[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:29] Let's all clap together. Follow me if we
[1:00:30] would one time.
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:48] Hallelujah.
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:51] Song of praise. Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:01:23] Oh,
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:33] [Music]
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:48] hey.
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:02:05] [Music]
[1:02:12] Oh,
[1:02:18] heat.
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:52] Amen.
[1:02:54] Amen. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:02:56] prayer.
[1:02:57] Lord Jesus,
[1:03:00] we thank you, Father, for bringing us
[1:03:02] together once again, Lord.
[1:03:04] Lord, it's you that has brought us
[1:03:07] safely thus far in our Christian
[1:03:10] journey. And Lord Jesus, we ask you to
[1:03:13] come now and speak to our hearts once
[1:03:16] again. Minister the words of life down
[1:03:19] in our souls, Lord, that we can grow in
[1:03:22] your grace and your mercy. Father, we
[1:03:24] love you this morning. We commit the
[1:03:27] service into your care, oh God, and each
[1:03:30] one that's gathered here. May the Holy
[1:03:33] Spirit take full control, Lord Jesus.
[1:03:36] Father, we need you. We need you every
[1:03:39] hour of our life.
[1:03:41] And Lord, we thank you for all your many
[1:03:44] blessings. We come under expectations,
[1:03:47] Lord, with our hearts looking to thee,
[1:03:50] not to a man, not to a group, but we
[1:03:53] look to you, Lord, that takes away our
[1:03:56] sins and knows exactly what we have need
[1:03:59] of every moment of our life. And Father,
[1:04:03] meet those needs today supernaturally.
[1:04:06] Lord, speak to every heart in the spirit
[1:04:10] is our prayer. It's in Jesus name we
[1:04:13] ask. Father, amen. Amen. Well, God bless
[1:04:17] you, saints. So good to be in the house
[1:04:19] of the Lord with you today. It's always
[1:04:22] a privilege to be gathered in his name.
[1:04:24] Amen. How many of you are happy to be
[1:04:27] here? God bless you. We welcome you to
[1:04:30] the house of the Lord. We welcome each
[1:04:31] of you. Um, let me say thank the Lord
[1:04:36] for
[1:04:37] uh all of his grace and mercy to us. I
[1:04:40] want to remember we're going to have an
[1:04:42] adult Bible study starting coming up
[1:04:46] this um the next few days or weeks or
[1:04:49] so. And we'd like to make that available
[1:04:52] to any of the newcomers, people that are
[1:04:55] baptized and even the old-timers would
[1:04:58] be welcome to be a part of that. If you
[1:05:00] have some friends that you want to to um
[1:05:04] introduce them to the word in a a more
[1:05:06] informal way, we'll make that available.
[1:05:09] Amen. And so, how many ever been a part
[1:05:12] of a home Bible study?
[1:05:15] Oh, they get so much further. They take
[1:05:18] you a little deeper sometimes than a
[1:05:20] church service. And so, how many's ever
[1:05:23] been in a Bible study? How many's never
[1:05:26] been in a Bible study? So, everybody's
[1:05:29] been in a Bible study. You, brother, you
[1:05:31] never been in a Bible study. Okay,
[1:05:33] Brother Ben. All right. But it's so nice
[1:05:35] coming in. You know, when I first came
[1:05:37] in the message, you'd hear these great
[1:05:40] deeper things, Brother Zach, and you
[1:05:42] hear them and you didn't know the
[1:05:44] terminology. What is he talking about?
[1:05:45] What is he saying? Well, then my good
[1:05:48] friend, Brother Fred, who's just crossed
[1:05:50] over, he he'd had those he'd have those
[1:05:52] Bible studies in his home and they were
[1:05:54] just profoundly
[1:05:56] um beneficial to me because then I can
[1:05:58] ask questions. Then I can say, "What are
[1:06:00] they saying? What are they talking
[1:06:02] about? What's a third pull? What's a
[1:06:03] second pull? What are these brothers
[1:06:06] talking about? They're shouting. I want
[1:06:07] to shout, too. But I can't shout if I
[1:06:09] don't understand what's being said." And
[1:06:12] so this message is so deep and so great.
[1:06:16] It becomes common to us, especially
[1:06:18] particularly you that were raised in it.
[1:06:20] You know the terminology and what this
[1:06:23] picture is up here for. You know the
[1:06:26] history behind it. When you have a
[1:06:27] person off the streets and they come
[1:06:29] here for the first time and they see
[1:06:31] something like like what's that cloud in
[1:06:34] the entrance? What are these you know
[1:06:36] all the sisters are dressed as certain?
[1:06:38] What's going on here? And it's nice to
[1:06:41] in a nice comfortable setting with a
[1:06:44] donut or something and a cup of coffee,
[1:06:47] talk about these deeper things in a
[1:06:49] Bible study. So, we want to make that
[1:06:50] available. I think it's our duty to um
[1:06:54] offer that to the people. Amen. So, God
[1:06:57] bless you richly. I'm so happy to be
[1:07:00] here with you again. We Levi and I, we
[1:07:02] took a couple days. We were up in uh
[1:07:04] Canada during this week and we did some
[1:07:07] fishing and cooled down just a little
[1:07:10] bit. And so we're back well rested,
[1:07:14] ready to go another 100,000 miles. All
[1:07:16] right. And so, um, but we'll be gone
[1:07:19] again this weekend. So, I skipped last
[1:07:22] Wednesday. I'll be here this Wednesday,
[1:07:24] but I won't be here Sunday. And, um, but
[1:07:27] you'll be in capable hands of the
[1:07:29] brothers. Brother Joe always does a
[1:07:31] great job. And the elders here and the
[1:07:34] saints there in Mesa and Phoenix. God
[1:07:36] bless them richly. I missed two
[1:07:39] services. I'm going to miss a third
[1:07:41] there in Mesa. So, I just my, you know,
[1:07:46] when I don't go to the Mesa church on
[1:07:49] Thursday. I'm here Wednesday, then I go
[1:07:50] there Thursday. When I don't go, I'm
[1:07:53] just at home twiddling my thumbs.
[1:07:56] I'm bored. And so, you you all pray for
[1:07:58] me that the Lord will always give me
[1:08:00] strength. And I appreciate that. But if
[1:08:02] I don't go, what am I doing at home?
[1:08:05] Okay. And so there's always work to be
[1:08:07] do work to be done. And if the Lord
[1:08:09] gives me more strength to add another
[1:08:12] service like on a Friday night and cast
[1:08:15] a grand maybe
[1:08:18] who will go with me to cast a grand.
[1:08:22] So God bless you. The work is urgent.
[1:08:25] The work is great. And we'll get our
[1:08:27] rest in the grave.
[1:08:30] We get to sleep when we die. But today
[1:08:33] is the day of the living. We have
[1:08:35] strength. We have our youth. We have our
[1:08:38] intelligence.
[1:08:40] Go get it. Go run after it with all of
[1:08:43] your heart. The Lord has given us a
[1:08:44] great message. Is that right? And so
[1:08:46] we're glad to proclaim it. Count it a
[1:08:49] privilege to be with you. Brother
[1:08:50] Ferguson is 75 years old.
[1:08:55] And and him and brother Hume uh what's
[1:08:59] his name? Brother Hugh, Gerald Hughes
[1:09:03] are built of the same cloth almost.
[1:09:05] They're older, but they've never
[1:09:07] stopped. And if the Lord would give me
[1:09:09] that energy at 75, oh my, I'll be so
[1:09:13] grateful. But it's almost like if you
[1:09:15] build yourself up to staying busy for
[1:09:17] the Lord, he'll give you the strength to
[1:09:19] to do just that. And so we want to wear
[1:09:23] out, not rust out. And so many
[1:09:27] Christians sit on the pews rusting out.
[1:09:30] And we got a lot of young men, young
[1:09:33] young talent coming up. We want to use
[1:09:36] that talent and that energy in way that
[1:09:39] the Lord would see fit that he would be
[1:09:41] gloried, honorified, and he'd be
[1:09:44] praised. Amen. So, God bless you all
[1:09:47] richly. So happy to be home with you
[1:09:50] here today. I enjoyed the Father's Day
[1:09:53] uh service and that uh um the the
[1:09:57] cookout and the the celebration, the
[1:10:00] singing. It was just so nice. And the
[1:10:02] brother, young brother, one brother sent
[1:10:05] uh brother Robson a text of the
[1:10:08] experience he had and how it blessed
[1:10:10] him. the singing, that gentleman that
[1:10:13] comes in the back there, his name
[1:10:15] escapes me right now. But he was so
[1:10:18] blessed by it and he really summed it up
[1:10:20] very well. That was in my heart, too. I
[1:10:23] just really was encouraged by that and
[1:10:25] always enjoy coming together, getting
[1:10:27] together with the saints. Amen. So,
[1:10:30] let's all stand to our feet and we'll go
[1:10:32] into the the word of the Lord this
[1:10:34] morning.
[1:10:36] We always want to pray for
[1:10:39] our young people. Pray for them. Pray
[1:10:41] for the elders. Pray for your pastor.
[1:10:45] Pray for the deacons. Pray for one
[1:10:47] another. Pray for the ones you would
[1:10:50] normally think to pray for. Just call
[1:10:53] their name out in prayer because we all
[1:10:56] need prayer. Amen.
[1:10:58] We all need more of his grace and mercy
[1:11:00] to us.
[1:11:03] We like to take our scripture found in
[1:11:05] Galatians chapter 4
[1:11:08] just for a moment and we'll take one
[1:11:12] or two verses there. Galatians chapter 4
[1:11:43] Galatians in the New Testament, right?
[1:11:45] Yes. Galatians chapter 4
[1:11:50] verse number one.
[1:11:57] Now I say that the heir, as long as he
[1:12:01] is a child, differereth nothing from a
[1:12:03] servant, though he be lord of all, but
[1:12:07] is under tutorers and governors until
[1:12:11] the time appointed of who? Of the
[1:12:15] father. Even so we, when we were
[1:12:18] children, were in bondage under the
[1:12:20] elements of the world. But when the
[1:12:23] fullness of time was come, God sent
[1:12:26] forth his son, made of a woman, made
[1:12:29] under the law, to redeem them that were
[1:12:32] under the law, that we might receive the
[1:12:36] adoption of sons. Amen. Let's take let's
[1:12:41] take one more scripture over speaking of
[1:12:45] this adoption that we're predestinated
[1:12:47] to in Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:13:10] Ephesians chapter 1
[1:13:19] and verse number Five,
[1:13:22] having
[1:13:24] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:13:27] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:13:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:13:35] will. Let's sing let's let's say it all
[1:13:38] together. Verse number five. having
[1:13:40] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:13:44] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:13:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:13:51] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:13:54] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:13:58] in the beloved. Amen. Let us pray. Lord
[1:14:01] Jesus, we ask your blessings on the
[1:14:03] reading of your word. Lord, we know that
[1:14:05] one word from you is all any mortal
[1:14:09] needs to hear. And as you taught us to
[1:14:13] pray, give us
[1:14:16] today our daily bread. And we pray,
[1:14:18] Lord, that you'll give us our daily
[1:14:21] portion today.
[1:14:23] speak to our hearts in a great way,
[1:14:25] Lord, in just one phrase or one sentence
[1:14:30] or several words or several sentences,
[1:14:33] whatever we can contain. Lord, let us
[1:14:35] receive it today. It's in Jesus' name we
[1:14:39] pray. We know that man shall not live by
[1:14:41] bread alone, but by every word. And
[1:14:44] Lord, we come feasting on the body of
[1:14:47] the word of God. It's in Jesus name we
[1:14:49] ask. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:14:52] seated. Now, last week we spoke on the
[1:14:55] abba father on father's day. We were
[1:14:58] talking about how in the old testament
[1:15:02] this order of the adoption
[1:15:05] was that a son was born into a family
[1:15:09] and after being born into the family
[1:15:12] after 8 days that child would be
[1:15:16] circumcised. The male child be
[1:15:18] circumcised. This was the law that God
[1:15:21] instituted with Abraham, carried over
[1:15:24] through with Moses and the children of
[1:15:26] Israel. It actually was the sign that
[1:15:30] separated them from all the other
[1:15:33] nations. This sign of circumcision,
[1:15:38] it showed that they were in covenant
[1:15:40] with the great God who instituted it.
[1:15:44] Now, why does it matter? What is the big
[1:15:46] deal? what was the purpose of it? Well,
[1:15:49] these are the things that are in God's
[1:15:53] uh great infinite mind in wisdom. And we
[1:15:58] don't always understand why such
[1:16:02] technicalities
[1:16:03] would be instituted by God. And they're
[1:16:06] very serious, too. So much so that it
[1:16:09] would cut a man off from God if he
[1:16:13] didn't go through this circumcision.
[1:16:16] also
[1:16:17] his laws of resting on the Sabbath day
[1:16:20] and many other laws that were very
[1:16:22] serious. And the Lord told Israel, "Six
[1:16:26] days you work, the seventh day you rest,
[1:16:29] don't work." And one man just so
[1:16:31] happened to be out gathering sticks on
[1:16:36] the Sabbath day. And the children of
[1:16:38] Israel captured him. They got this man
[1:16:41] and they said, "Lord, what shall we do
[1:16:43] with him?" to to Moses and Moses went to
[1:16:46] the Lord and the Lord said Moses he must
[1:16:50] be stoned with stones. So they put this
[1:16:52] man to death. Could you imagine
[1:16:54] put this man to death for working on the
[1:16:57] what was he gathering sticks on the
[1:17:00] Sabbath day and we know everything is
[1:17:04] open on Sundays today. I mean, God knew
[1:17:07] that that would be done away with at one
[1:17:10] time, and he knew in his great wisdom
[1:17:12] that the day of the week really wouldn't
[1:17:15] matter, but under this covenant, it did
[1:17:18] matter. And God is very precise. And
[1:17:21] what he says, he means that. And even if
[1:17:24] we think we're so wise and our well, it
[1:17:27] doesn't matter. What difference does it
[1:17:29] make? It's just one little detail. What
[1:17:31] what difference does it make? I'm going
[1:17:33] to say this here. If you see it in God's
[1:17:35] word as a warning to you, if you hear it
[1:17:38] in one place in the scripture or on one
[1:17:41] tape of this message, then you need to
[1:17:43] take heed to that. I don't care what the
[1:17:46] pastor highlights or doesn't highlight.
[1:17:48] If you read it in God's word for
[1:17:51] yourself, and you know that it's in
[1:17:54] God's word, either in the scripture or
[1:17:56] in this message, you should take heed to
[1:17:59] that. and don't wait for everybody else
[1:18:02] to get on board because God showed you
[1:18:05] that scripture. And it's in this
[1:18:08] discipline that we always want to walk
[1:18:09] with the Lord that it's between us and
[1:18:12] God. And I like this prayer. I heard an
[1:18:16] old Methodist pastor pray it and I and I
[1:18:20] really it really resonated with me that
[1:18:24] if if Lord if you show me what your will
[1:18:28] is then I will do it.
[1:18:31] And so if the Lord takes his time to
[1:18:35] show you
[1:18:37] then you it's on you now to do what he
[1:18:41] shows you. Remember there's lots and
[1:18:44] numbers and numbers of people that are
[1:18:47] slaying themselves at some altar. The
[1:18:49] Buddhists, the Muslim man, the Maria
[1:18:53] Krishna man, the Indians and all of the
[1:18:57] uh Indian eastern religions that these
[1:18:59] people are giving their life for truth.
[1:19:02] Worshiping the sun, worshiping the
[1:19:04] animals, worshiping in all kind of ways
[1:19:08] they think to approach God. And here God
[1:19:10] reveals the truth to you and I. What a
[1:19:14] privileged people we ought to be. And I
[1:19:16] really believe with all my heart that if
[1:19:18] God shows me a truth,
[1:19:23] then I need grace to follow in that
[1:19:25] truth. I don't want to make excuses for
[1:19:28] it. I don't want to do it because
[1:19:30] somebody else is doing it. I don't want
[1:19:32] to not do it because nobody else is
[1:19:33] doing it. I want to walk in what the
[1:19:36] Lord shows me. And he'll do that to a
[1:19:39] man or a woman. Pastor, preacher, a
[1:19:41] nobody, newcomer, it doesn't matter. I
[1:19:44] can show you many examples out of the
[1:19:46] scriptures where anybody who takes God
[1:19:49] at his word, he would honor them.
[1:19:53] So that includes you today. You're just
[1:19:55] as important as anybody else. You say,
[1:19:57] "Well, I'm not in the front and I'm just
[1:19:59] a sister. I'm one of the brothers. I
[1:20:01] don't they don't ask me to pray and I'm
[1:20:02] never led." Doesn't that has nothing to
[1:20:04] do with it? God recognizes faith. And
[1:20:09] when you have faith and you take God at
[1:20:11] his word
[1:20:15] there, there's no seniority in here.
[1:20:18] Like I I got baptized. I've been here
[1:20:20] the longest, so I got the most clout.
[1:20:22] No, no, no, no, no. If you have faith,
[1:20:25] that will please God. And that's the
[1:20:28] kind of God that we serve. He's no
[1:20:30] respector of persons or nations or kind
[1:20:33] of people. He's he respects his word.
[1:20:35] And so we we looked at this process of
[1:20:38] the birth and how Abraham and this great
[1:20:42] circumcision was instituted after the
[1:20:44] eighth day. And then there was a period
[1:20:47] of time where this child would be under
[1:20:50] tutorers
[1:20:51] or teachers or governors. And I remember
[1:20:56] some time back there was an article,
[1:20:58] this is years ago, where they had these
[1:21:01] um athletes that would graduate from
[1:21:05] high school and enter into college and
[1:21:08] couldn't even read
[1:21:11] because the tutors, they're so caught up
[1:21:14] in meeting the quota that everybody
[1:21:16] would graduate.
[1:21:18] So they need so many numbers to graduate
[1:21:21] in order to keep their funding intact to
[1:21:24] show that our school is doing well. All
[1:21:26] of our seniors graduated. All of the
[1:21:29] 10th graders, 11th graders, they all
[1:21:30] graduated. So you have this, you know,
[1:21:33] this little uh
[1:21:37] manipulation.
[1:21:40] Your child, your student is not getting
[1:21:42] it. He's not learning.
[1:21:45] But because you're old and you need to
[1:21:47] graduate anyways, we're going to go
[1:21:50] ahead and give you this diploma as
[1:21:51] though you have graduated.
[1:21:54] Well, with the kingdom of God is not so.
[1:21:59] The tutorer of our day is the Holy
[1:22:01] Spirit.
[1:22:03] And if we are predestinated to adoption,
[1:22:07] then wouldn't couldn't we say that every
[1:22:10] test and every trial that we go through
[1:22:13] is related to the adoption?
[1:22:17] Couldn't we say that? Amen. You think
[1:22:19] it's just about this, I need more
[1:22:21] patience or I need more love. It is all
[1:22:23] related to the adoption. Why? Because
[1:22:26] we're predestinated to it. Our future is
[1:22:30] the adoption.
[1:22:32] What is the adoption? It's you finding
[1:22:34] your position and the father placing you
[1:22:38] in your position. That's man, that's
[1:22:41] woman, that's brothers and sisters,
[1:22:45] that's ministry, that's young people,
[1:22:47] that's whoever you are. It's finding
[1:22:48] your position in the kingdom of God. So
[1:22:51] this great adoption and being under a
[1:22:55] tutorer, being under a teacher, being
[1:22:58] under um this great one that's trying to
[1:23:02] to bring you to
[1:23:05] to the place where you can be placed
[1:23:08] with that authority. How many of you are
[1:23:11] interested in that? It's called the
[1:23:14] father's business,
[1:23:16] not everybody else's business.
[1:23:19] Facebook is talking about everybody
[1:23:21] else's business. Instagram is somebody
[1:23:24] else's business, but we're talking about
[1:23:26] the father's business today. That's in
[1:23:28] God's word. Amen.
[1:23:31] 5:00 news, everybody else's business.
[1:23:34] Fox News, everybody else's business. But
[1:23:37] this right here we're talking about is
[1:23:39] the father's business. And a child was
[1:23:43] born into a family and he was put under
[1:23:46] tutors and governors. How many of you
[1:23:48] are being put under a tutor?
[1:23:51] Well, if you're a son or daughter of
[1:23:52] God, you have one today.
[1:23:55] Somebody's trying to teach you
[1:23:56] something. Somebody's trying to get you
[1:23:58] something, but we falling asleep in our
[1:24:01] class.
[1:24:03] And then when it come time for the
[1:24:04] finals, we just want to find out what's
[1:24:06] going to be on the test,
[1:24:09] what's what's the important part. All of
[1:24:10] it was important,
[1:24:13] right?
[1:24:14] We're under this time of tutors and
[1:24:17] governors. Amen. And so, let's hear what
[1:24:22] the prophet says. I'm going to go back
[1:24:23] just a little bit from last week on and
[1:24:26] read from the adoption
[1:24:29] number four.
[1:24:32] And this was
[1:24:36] um 1960 paragraph 104. Brother Brandon
[1:24:40] says this here.
[1:24:42] Thus sayeth the Lord, it'll take perfect
[1:24:45] love to put you in that place, for
[1:24:48] that's all there was there. No matter
[1:24:52] what money, how much religious
[1:24:54] demonstrations, how much many good deeds
[1:24:56] you done or whatever you done, that
[1:24:58] won't count nothing on that day. It'll
[1:25:02] take perfect love. So whatever you do,
[1:25:05] lay aside everything else until you are
[1:25:09] just so filled with the love of God till
[1:25:12] you can love those who hate you.
[1:25:17] So brother Bham has this tremendous
[1:25:20] experience that we in the message we
[1:25:23] talk about a lot him going beyond the
[1:25:25] curtain of time. It is so profound an
[1:25:29] experience that we can't preach a
[1:25:32] funeral like maybe the worldly people
[1:25:35] would preach it because we have one of
[1:25:38] our own that went beyond the curtain of
[1:25:40] time and showed us what it was like when
[1:25:44] you cross over.
[1:25:46] What kind of bodies are we in? What um
[1:25:51] what was our desire?
[1:25:54] What was our position? And and all those
[1:25:56] things. And here, brother Brandham has
[1:25:58] this great experience. And while he was
[1:26:00] in the hospital preparing to go
[1:26:02] overseas, he uh took this Ephesians 4
[1:26:07] and took this series on the adoption.
[1:26:09] And he brings this out to us. Adoption
[1:26:12] one, two, three, and four. And with that
[1:26:16] experience in his heart, in his mind, he
[1:26:19] presents that to us about this perfect
[1:26:22] love is the capstone that we're all
[1:26:25] trying to reach to. It's not perfect
[1:26:27] knowledge. It's not knowing more than
[1:26:29] everyone. It is about having perfect
[1:26:32] love
[1:26:34] that we all must have. And the
[1:26:37] scriptures tells us that we are
[1:26:39] predestinated to the adoption.
[1:26:44] Now the prophet shows us that in this
[1:26:48] process after the birth after the
[1:26:50] circumcision that that son is just a
[1:26:53] regular child he's under tutors and
[1:26:56] governors for a period of time. There's
[1:26:59] a season that he's being tested on every
[1:27:02] level. He says that Jesus was tested for
[1:27:06] 30 years and then three years he was
[1:27:10] under hard testing
[1:27:13] like the finals would say.
[1:27:16] And this um this great proving time,
[1:27:20] this great testing ground, it's it's
[1:27:23] your attitude towards a father's
[1:27:25] business. It's not your attitude towards
[1:27:27] church per se or against this brother or
[1:27:30] that one or that doctrine per se,
[1:27:33] although all those things are included,
[1:27:35] but it's really our attitude towards the
[1:27:37] father's word and what his business is
[1:27:41] as it pertains to our life. Amen. Some
[1:27:45] of us should be
[1:27:48] some of us probably should be further
[1:27:51] along than what we are today if we'll be
[1:27:54] real honest. I can be honest and say I
[1:27:57] missed a lot of time, a lot of years
[1:28:02] just peeling and spinning in circles and
[1:28:05] things that didn't matter. Allowing
[1:28:07] people that are not even eternal to get
[1:28:10] me upset.
[1:28:13] Situations that are not eternal causing
[1:28:16] me stress.
[1:28:19] people, problems, issues that are
[1:28:21] surrounding me that are not even in the
[1:28:24] great eternities of the most high God.
[1:28:29] But yet God allows that to perfect us.
[1:28:32] And hopefully by his grace, he will
[1:28:35] waken us to our purpose here on the
[1:28:38] earth. And then we'll get interested in
[1:28:41] the father's business.
[1:28:44] Then when you're interested in the
[1:28:46] father's business, you don't have you
[1:28:48] don't need a team of people to encourage
[1:28:50] you along.
[1:28:52] You don't need someone to make sure
[1:28:54] you're reading your Bible and praying
[1:28:56] every day. The Holy Spirit, the tutor,
[1:29:00] is the one that wants you to read your
[1:29:02] Bible and pray every day. It's the Holy
[1:29:05] Spirit that's watching you over every
[1:29:09] test, over every trial. And if we are
[1:29:12] predestinated to adoption, couldn't we
[1:29:15] say that every test and every trial is
[1:29:19] connected to that adoption?
[1:29:22] Can we say that that's the main goal for
[1:29:25] the believer? It's not just eternal
[1:29:27] life. It's not just being baptized. It's
[1:29:30] not just being a Christian, but I'm
[1:29:33] talking about an adopted son placed with
[1:29:37] a position and the authority carrying
[1:29:40] out the father's work. That's what the
[1:29:43] believer is striving for today.
[1:29:46] And so the prophet brings this to uh and
[1:29:51] he gives highlights of it. Let me take
[1:29:53] this one in everlasting life in 1954.
[1:29:56] And he says this here, paragraph 111. He
[1:29:59] says, "But when you stay in the kingdom,
[1:30:02] stay in the gospel, stay right, one of
[1:30:05] these days, God will call you out and
[1:30:08] set you aside, adopt you as his son
[1:30:13] before the people and give you something
[1:30:15] that will shake the nations with it."
[1:30:17] See what I mean? It's the adoption into
[1:30:21] the family.
[1:30:23] He continues on in adoption. Um um
[1:30:28] number four, paragraph number 46. And he
[1:30:32] says,
[1:30:34] yeah, I'm sorry. This is in um what was
[1:30:36] the Holy Ghost given for? In paragraph
[1:30:39] number 46, he says, "Now in the Old
[1:30:41] Testament, when this baby was born, they
[1:30:43] watched it to see how it was behaved."
[1:30:48] Behavior.
[1:30:50] So this behavior is the time that's
[1:30:55] allowed it. The school teacher and this
[1:30:58] school teacher was the best he could
[1:31:00] find so that he'd be truthful and tell
[1:31:02] the father the truth about it. And as I
[1:31:05] was saying about these these athletes
[1:31:07] and these students that were being put
[1:31:10] forward and they were given the you know
[1:31:13] the the ceremony of being graduated and
[1:31:17] they get the diploma and the degree and
[1:31:20] the reason why many times they would
[1:31:22] pushed him through is because like I
[1:31:24] said the quota was for to every so many
[1:31:27] people would graduate or if he was
[1:31:29] gifted or talented in football or
[1:31:31] basketball or baseball then they
[1:31:34] wouldn't didn't really focus on his
[1:31:36] studies as much because we got to win
[1:31:39] the state championship, brother John.
[1:31:41] And we can't have our star player being
[1:31:44] taken out because of his grades. And so
[1:31:47] there's a little manipulation when
[1:31:49] you're dealing with man. Sometimes I've
[1:31:52] seen it with my own two eyes where
[1:31:55] people will come in and they appear to
[1:31:57] be spiritual. And I seen a young man
[1:32:00] come into the church just for a year or
[1:32:03] so. And he said all the right things. He
[1:32:06] did all the things that looked like he
[1:32:08] was in the word. And wasn't long that he
[1:32:11] was in the pull pit preaching. And he
[1:32:14] wasn't even born again yet. And those
[1:32:17] that work with him and those that walk
[1:32:19] with him could see this. But amongst the
[1:32:22] group, he hid. and he looked like he was
[1:32:25] being uh uh uh matured in the things of
[1:32:28] the word because he there's a language
[1:32:30] we speak here in the message and if I
[1:32:33] speak those languages quite right you
[1:32:35] will say amen whether I'm living right
[1:32:38] or not and he walked up those ranks and
[1:32:41] he did that and wasn't long and time
[1:32:43] went on he was never married and he left
[1:32:46] the church and he ran with some woman
[1:32:48] married some uh divorced woman and just
[1:32:51] lived a life that was totally contrary
[1:32:53] contary and that that was in the realm
[1:32:55] of this message of the church. How could
[1:32:57] someone slip through the cracks that
[1:32:59] way? Well, it happens, doesn't it?
[1:33:02] People come among us and then we'll wink
[1:33:05] at little things. We'll say, "Well, no,
[1:33:07] it's not that big of a deal." Well, it
[1:33:09] might be a big deal.
[1:33:13] God doesn't wink at that. We really want
[1:33:16] to be right with God.
[1:33:19] And the tutor will make sure of that.
[1:33:22] He's a real tutor. He's a real father.
[1:33:27] He He won't let you get by with nothing.
[1:33:30] He's in your space all the time. Like
[1:33:33] you just think he's a little thing, a
[1:33:35] little thing. You slide just a little
[1:33:36] bit and hear the visiting minister come
[1:33:39] in and nails you.
[1:33:44] He's like, "Well, who who told him what
[1:33:46] was going on in this house?" Yeah.
[1:33:49] Sometimes you have a little
[1:33:50] conversation, little conflicts at home
[1:33:52] and then the preacher will get up and
[1:33:54] preach and just nails you.
[1:33:57] You're like, "Oo, I know wife is looking
[1:34:00] at me. I know husband is looking at me.
[1:34:04] I know the kiddies know. Oh, that was
[1:34:06] for me. That was for dad right there."
[1:34:09] What is that? That's not the pastor.
[1:34:11] That's not the That's the Holy Spirit
[1:34:14] tutoring you and governing you instead
[1:34:18] of you thinking, well, it was just lucky
[1:34:19] or just per chance. No, it's the Holy
[1:34:21] Spirit watching over you, concerned
[1:34:24] about you. And the Holy Spirit is our
[1:34:27] tutor. He's our teacher. He's our
[1:34:31] personal
[1:34:32] um He's our personal what do you call
[1:34:35] those guys? Yeah. personal tutor to help
[1:34:38] us through the difficulties that we're
[1:34:41] going through in this life. And so we
[1:34:44] all need one and we're all under a
[1:34:45] governor and tutor. But you know, if we
[1:34:48] don't pass the test, we'll just be a
[1:34:51] regular son. Here what brother Bham says
[1:34:54] in what was the Holy Ghost given for
[1:34:56] paragraph 48. He says, "Now watch what
[1:34:59] God did when his son was born. And he
[1:35:00] let him go for 30 years testing him,
[1:35:04] trying him. Then he gave him three years
[1:35:07] of hard trial. Then at the end of the
[1:35:10] hard trial, when he seen that his son
[1:35:12] was about the father's business, Mount
[1:35:15] Transfiguration,
[1:35:17] book of Luke, he took Peter, James, and
[1:35:19] John, three witnesses, and went up on
[1:35:21] the top of the mountain. And there God
[1:35:23] performed the laws of adoptions.
[1:35:29] Brother Random continues on in paragraph
[1:35:32] 49 that same message drop down a little
[1:35:34] bit. He says he deals with the church as
[1:35:36] individuals,
[1:35:38] each individual in the church. And now
[1:35:40] it's got to a time, it's no secret. We
[1:35:43] all see it. When a man proves and God
[1:35:47] loves him and he takes him out somewhere
[1:35:49] to himself there in the front of the
[1:35:52] angels, he does something for him. lifts
[1:35:56] him up there in the presence of God and
[1:35:59] gifts him and fills him and sets him
[1:36:02] out. That's the age that we're living
[1:36:05] in.
[1:36:07] Amen. I thank God for this truth. I
[1:36:10] thank God for the goal that has been set
[1:36:13] for me that I am predestinated to the
[1:36:18] adoption.
[1:36:20] Not just an ordinary son, but a son that
[1:36:24] is taking the test and passing the test.
[1:36:27] Here what the prophet of God says in the
[1:36:30] adoption part two paragraph 188. He says
[1:36:33] this here.
[1:36:39] Now when the father in the older old
[1:36:42] testament understood that his son was
[1:36:45] come of age and had been
[1:36:49] seasoned out unto adoption unto they're
[1:36:54] born a child but when they're a son
[1:36:57] right then but then they'll never be
[1:37:00] more they'll never be no more than just
[1:37:03] a child just an ordinary son until they
[1:37:07] mature and show what they are. Then he
[1:37:10] calls them out. Then now here we are
[1:37:14] church. Are you ready? Now it's a little
[1:37:16] bit late. He says,
[1:37:19] then he takes them out to a certain
[1:37:21] place. The father does. And he sets him
[1:37:23] on high
[1:37:25] like this. And he has a ceremony. They
[1:37:28] all come around and I want everyone to
[1:37:30] know that this is my child. And I adopt
[1:37:33] my son. And I want anyone to know from
[1:37:35] henceforth that his name I dress him up
[1:37:39] a special dress on him. I want you to
[1:37:41] know that his name is just as good on
[1:37:43] any check as my name is. He's my child.
[1:37:47] I adopt him into my family. Although
[1:37:50] he's been my son since he was born,
[1:37:54] since he received the Holy Ghost, he's
[1:37:55] been my son. But now I'm going to place
[1:37:59] him positionally in authority. What he
[1:38:02] fires is fired. What he hires is hired.
[1:38:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. So we're we're
[1:38:10] we're coming into that place. We as each
[1:38:14] individual, we take these things very
[1:38:17] personal and very serious. We wasted
[1:38:20] time. Sometimes we would get um
[1:38:24] ourselves involved in other matters in
[1:38:26] other churches. I was big into that.
[1:38:29] which church is standing on the word,
[1:38:31] which one isn't? If I was going to live
[1:38:33] in Georgia, which church there is
[1:38:35] standing on the word, and which church
[1:38:37] in Pennsylvania is really or Texas is
[1:38:40] really standing on the word, or which
[1:38:42] pastor is really standing on the word.
[1:38:44] And those things are important if I'm
[1:38:46] living in Texas, but really what what
[1:38:49] really the father is trying to get me
[1:38:51] into my position,
[1:38:54] into my place.
[1:38:57] And we have a lot of that those times we
[1:39:00] waste years of getting involved in what
[1:39:04] other church groups are doing. They're
[1:39:07] doing whatever they're doing. They're
[1:39:09] going to continue doing whatever they're
[1:39:10] doing. And there are things that they're
[1:39:13] interesting. Yes, there are things that
[1:39:16] maybe we can talk about. I don't know.
[1:39:18] But you know that I shouldn't spend my
[1:39:20] time in that because I should be into
[1:39:23] the father's business, not everybody
[1:39:26] else's business. What is that to thee?
[1:39:30] Follow thou me?
[1:39:33] And you know this um this message is
[1:39:36] becoming more and more more real to us
[1:39:39] each day, each hour as we read it and we
[1:39:43] take it into ourselves and really
[1:39:45] approach it the way the Holy Spirit
[1:39:47] wants us to approach it. Now, we took
[1:39:49] this little character,
[1:39:52] I'll call him little character, big
[1:39:53] character really, King Hezekiah last
[1:39:56] week, and we showed how he turned his
[1:40:00] face to the wall when he prayed. And the
[1:40:04] prophet of God actually takes his uh
[1:40:07] example. And in the message, desperation
[1:40:10] says that this king prayed a prayer of
[1:40:15] desperation. That's what it was. He was
[1:40:18] in desperation. If you follow the life
[1:40:21] of King Hezekiah, you'll see that he was
[1:40:26] um he his father was a wicked king and
[1:40:31] he didn't go in the line of his father.
[1:40:34] But to really get a a good view or
[1:40:37] picture of his life, you can't just take
[1:40:40] Isaiah. You got to take 2 Chronicles 32
[1:40:43] and also 2 Kings chapter 20. And these
[1:40:47] three places highlights what Hezekiah
[1:40:51] went through and what his life was like.
[1:40:54] He was really I mean if you ever take
[1:40:57] the trip to to Israel and I was thinking
[1:40:59] about that after brother George had left
[1:41:01] it would be so nice to have brother
[1:41:02] George even just share just remotely of
[1:41:07] what the land of Israel is like. Just
[1:41:09] take a map and show those different
[1:41:11] details around it. and he took us and we
[1:41:13] went on that tour and you see the
[1:41:16] waterworks that Hezekiah built. The
[1:41:18] scriptures talk about it. How he
[1:41:20] channeled water. I forget how many miles
[1:41:22] he built the aqueduct system and just
[1:41:26] the wisdom that he used. A great great
[1:41:28] king. His dad was a wicked man. But the
[1:41:33] scriptures notate his mother, who his
[1:41:36] mother was. And I think that's a detail
[1:41:38] there for a reason. But Hezekiah was 25
[1:41:41] years old when he began to reign and he
[1:41:44] began to take down all of the false gods
[1:41:47] in the high places that were contrary.
[1:41:50] And when you read the book of Kings and
[1:41:53] and Samuel and Chronicles and you'll see
[1:41:57] how there'll be a righteous king in in
[1:41:59] Judah, righteous king in Israel, and
[1:42:02] then there'll be an evil one or a wicked
[1:42:04] one. And it always the people would just
[1:42:06] follow right into, you know, just
[1:42:09] worshiping Baal and all these evil gods.
[1:42:12] And you see how the human being after
[1:42:16] God has proven himself over and over
[1:42:18] again, they still will wander into these
[1:42:22] gray areas and even go into idolatry.
[1:42:25] You say, "Well, I mean, these people are
[1:42:27] not clear." See, because we're reading
[1:42:29] it like here, one page after the next.
[1:42:32] When you open it up and you see their
[1:42:34] life and the lifestyle, how easy it is
[1:42:38] to let something slip in to a
[1:42:40] congregation.
[1:42:42] It's like little things like just even
[1:42:45] high heel shoes. And I I'm not pointing
[1:42:47] out anybody that has them on today. If
[1:42:49] you do or if you don't, whatever.
[1:42:53] But I remember my oldest sister had
[1:42:55] brought home a pair of high heels. shoes
[1:42:58] and my daddy saw that and my mom and dad
[1:43:02] blew up on her wearing high heel shoes
[1:43:05] and they had a big platform bottom. So
[1:43:07] my dad didn't want to waste the money on
[1:43:10] them so he cut them.
[1:43:12] He shaved them down evenly, I guess. And
[1:43:16] I was just a little boy like what's the
[1:43:18] big deal? It's a pair of shoes. But when
[1:43:20] you look at where it comes from, you
[1:43:22] look at the details of it. And I just
[1:43:25] pointed that out because I don't I'm not
[1:43:27] thinking of anybody in my mind right
[1:43:29] now. I do have a church in my mind that
[1:43:30] I'm thinking about, but I'm not thinking
[1:43:32] about none of you when I'm talking about
[1:43:34] a high heel shoes. But just a little
[1:43:37] detail like that, it's like, okay, that
[1:43:39] would slip in and then paint will slip
[1:43:41] in and then whatever other little small
[1:43:45] details in message churches now. And you
[1:43:48] say to yourself, "Well, I'm talking
[1:43:50] about churches that are listening to the
[1:43:52] tapes only to tapes, too." Yes. It'll
[1:43:56] slip right in. And it's like, "Well, how
[1:43:58] does this happen?" Well, pick up your
[1:44:00] Bible. That's the way it's always been.
[1:44:03] And unless somebody really brings it out
[1:44:06] to you, brother, sister, here's what the
[1:44:09] prophet said. Here's what the Bible
[1:44:11] says. The Holy Spirit is not pleased
[1:44:13] with this.
[1:44:15] And you get a quickening of it. Then
[1:44:17] it's it resets you like you know what
[1:44:20] those things do matter they're very
[1:44:22] serious but you'll see how the human
[1:44:24] nature is if you don't stay with it if
[1:44:26] you don't stay on top of it what happens
[1:44:28] is that human nature will always drift
[1:44:31] back to what the other nations are doing
[1:44:34] around us because in the mall they have
[1:44:37] the models and the new styles and what's
[1:44:41] popular today before you know it it gets
[1:44:44] shorter it gets tighter it gets more
[1:44:46] worldly from the haircuts to everything
[1:44:50] else.
[1:44:51] Amen.
[1:44:53] And he just you're reading it in the
[1:44:55] scriptures, you're like, "Wow, these
[1:44:56] people just have they lost their mind?
[1:44:58] They're going to they're going to
[1:45:00] worship a false god right in the face of
[1:45:03] Jehovah." And then he throws them into
[1:45:05] into captivity and then they pray and
[1:45:07] then the Lord brings them out and then
[1:45:08] they go back into the same thing again.
[1:45:14] He shows you that it's our loving
[1:45:16] father. I like Psalms 23
[1:45:21] and verse five. The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:45:23] Can you help me quote it? The Lord is my
[1:45:25] shepherd. I shall not want. Maketh me,
[1:45:29] help me.
[1:45:32] He leadth me.
[1:45:35] He
[1:45:37] soul. He
[1:45:43] for his name's sake. You know his name's
[1:45:47] sake is for his reputation.
[1:45:50] That's what that means. For his name's
[1:45:53] sake. It's not for your name. It's for
[1:45:55] his if his name is on it, it's his
[1:45:59] reputation that's at stake.
[1:46:02] And when Moses cried out to God, he
[1:46:06] says,"Lord, if you wipe these people
[1:46:08] off, the people are going to look at you
[1:46:11] and say, "You was not able to bring them
[1:46:13] over. It's your name that's at stake." I
[1:46:17] want you to you get a chance. I have all
[1:46:19] the scriptures right here on it, but you
[1:46:21] just look up his own sake, his name's
[1:46:24] sake, and you look that up and see how
[1:46:27] God had protected Israel over and over
[1:46:31] again. Not because they were righteous,
[1:46:34] not because they deserved it, but bec
[1:46:36] but because his name was on them people.
[1:46:41] and his he leadth me to righteousness
[1:46:45] because his reputation
[1:46:48] is on it.
[1:46:52] This is exactly the way Hezekiah
[1:46:55] he prayed.
[1:46:57] You take each of those instances. Second
[1:47:01] Kings chapter 20, 2 Chronicles chapter
[1:47:03] 32, Isaiah chapter 38. Here is Hezekiah.
[1:47:07] His life is laid out before him. and he
[1:47:10] actually prays a prayer and he writes
[1:47:12] this prayer down. If we have time, we'll
[1:47:14] go into it just for a moment.
[1:47:17] But when the Lord is dealing with
[1:47:20] Hezekiah over and over again, he never
[1:47:23] attributes his father in the natural,
[1:47:27] but he always goes back to his father
[1:47:30] David.
[1:47:33] He says, "I'm going to deliver you from
[1:47:35] Sonakaribb because of my name's sake and
[1:47:38] my servant David's sake."
[1:47:42] Oh my my my my. Whose son are you today?
[1:47:47] Whose anointing are you following under
[1:47:48] today? People got a problem with us
[1:47:51] quoting brother Brandham. How many times
[1:47:53] did David outlive his name carry on? All
[1:47:57] through the kings,
[1:47:59] the real kings were identified with King
[1:48:02] David because David was a real one.
[1:48:06] He walked in the line of his father
[1:48:09] David. Well, David was his great
[1:48:11] great-grandfather in many cases, wasn't
[1:48:14] his father. But the Lord had a covenant
[1:48:16] with David. David wasn't a perfect man,
[1:48:19] was he? David made mistakes, didn't he?
[1:48:23] But the Lord chose David out of the
[1:48:26] sheep coat, out of a family and chose
[1:48:29] him to be the king. Even the firstborn
[1:48:33] king and all the other kings that would
[1:48:36] follow in righteousness would be
[1:48:38] attributed to King David.
[1:48:42] How many of you here has some old elder
[1:48:45] or pastor that you can identify with?
[1:48:49] Some brother in one way or the other?
[1:48:52] Maybe it's your natural father. Maybe
[1:48:54] it's your mother. Maybe it's your
[1:48:56] grandmother that you can look back and
[1:48:58] see their prayers.
[1:49:02] And that you're here today
[1:49:05] because somebody came before you that's
[1:49:09] connected to you some kind of way. Lord.
[1:49:12] Amen. I'm talking about God uses real
[1:49:14] people. He uses men and women. Sometimes
[1:49:17] they're in your own family. He'll use
[1:49:20] them. If you can see the goodness of God
[1:49:24] and draw on what they had and what
[1:49:26] spirituality they had, God will continue
[1:49:29] to bless you. Don't be ashamed of giving
[1:49:32] a man praise and thanks for their good
[1:49:35] works and their good deeds
[1:49:37] because we certainly criticize them
[1:49:41] enough.
[1:49:44] And if we handle out our criticism and
[1:49:47] our praise equally, we'll probably do a
[1:49:49] lot better. But a lot of times it's out
[1:49:51] of balance one way or the other. But
[1:49:54] King Hezekiah
[1:49:57] was this man that when the Lord told
[1:50:01] Isaiah to go to him and tell him to set
[1:50:04] his house in order, he turned his face
[1:50:07] to the wall and he prayed a prayer. He
[1:50:09] says, "Lord, I have walked before you
[1:50:12] with a perfect heart."
[1:50:15] you know that faithfulness
[1:50:18] and the perfect heart and that walking
[1:50:22] in favor with the Lord and the prophet
[1:50:26] says that you know how many of us can
[1:50:29] say that about ourselves that we've
[1:50:32] walked before the Lord with a perfect
[1:50:33] heart the Bible says that Job was
[1:50:36] perfect Noah was perfect um Abraham's
[1:50:41] considered perfect maybe of these Old
[1:50:43] Testament
[1:50:44] saints were consider considered and
[1:50:47] walked under the banner of being
[1:50:50] perfect. Jesus tells us, "Be ye
[1:50:52] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:50:54] heaven is perfect." And so what does
[1:50:56] this perfection mean? How does it mean
[1:51:00] for us even in the New Testament church?
[1:51:04] This perfection and being perfect comes
[1:51:09] through the blood.
[1:51:11] The worshipper that's once purged
[1:51:15] has no more condemnation,
[1:51:17] has no more desire to sin. This is where
[1:51:22] the believer finds his position that he
[1:51:25] is walking
[1:51:27] perfect not because of his own
[1:51:29] righteousness, but perfect because of
[1:51:32] the sacrifice that he's under.
[1:51:35] And if you got a if you got any
[1:51:37] questions or doubts on that, just get
[1:51:39] sister get the interview from sister
[1:51:41] Georgie Bruce. And brother Bam is
[1:51:44] talking to her and she's talking about
[1:51:45] how she can't put a spot on her life
[1:51:48] where she definitely received the Holy
[1:51:50] Ghost. And she wanted a a definite that
[1:51:54] she had been sealed into the kingdom of
[1:51:56] God. And brother Banner begins to talk
[1:51:58] to her. She says, "I made so many
[1:51:59] mistakes, but brother Banner, I made so
[1:52:02] many mistakes." He says, "Yeah, but he
[1:52:03] he paid for your debt. He paid for your
[1:52:06] sin. He's dealing with your heart. And
[1:52:09] your desire is to serve him. And he put
[1:52:13] that desire in your heart. You didn't
[1:52:16] put that in yourself. And no man can be
[1:52:18] perfect in himself." But oh, I declare
[1:52:21] to anyone standing here today that we're
[1:52:24] standing under a perfect sacrifice. Our
[1:52:27] Lord Jesus was perfect. The word that he
[1:52:31] sent us was perfect. This message is
[1:52:34] perfect. And the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:52:37] is perfect. He will have a church
[1:52:40] without spot, without a blemish, without
[1:52:43] a wrinkle. That he will present it to
[1:52:47] himself. A church that is perfect. Amen.
[1:52:53] You got to see yourself in there. You
[1:52:55] got to find your place in there.
[1:52:58] When I'm talking about what you saw and
[1:53:00] what someone said about you and who
[1:53:02] criticized you, I'm talking about what
[1:53:04] are you hanging your eternal destination
[1:53:07] on this morning. Is it your works? Is it
[1:53:10] your goodness?
[1:53:13] I'm hanging everything I got. The best
[1:53:15] deal I'mma get
[1:53:17] is coming under the blood of the
[1:53:19] innocent one. Accepting the Lord Jesus
[1:53:22] Christ as your savior. That's the best
[1:53:26] deal you'll ever get. What an
[1:53:29] opportunity
[1:53:31] to be a Christian.
[1:53:33] Amen, somebody.
[1:53:36] Yes.
[1:53:38] Law having a shadow. 1956, prophet of
[1:53:41] God says this. So when God speaks the
[1:53:43] word forever, it's part of him. Forever
[1:53:47] it it's a part of him. It can't no more
[1:53:51] fail than God can fail. If one word of
[1:53:54] God can fail, then God's not infinite.
[1:53:57] Neither is he omnipotent. Omnipotent.
[1:54:02] He has to take it back. Then he becomes
[1:54:05] immortal like I am. That's right. But
[1:54:08] when he speaks, it's perfect. Amen. Oh,
[1:54:12] that's what I like. Perfect. And we are
[1:54:15] perfect with the word.
[1:54:19] He continues on.
[1:54:21] law having a shadow 1954 paragraph 66 he
[1:54:25] says this and God himself coming
[1:54:29] unfolding himself out of heaven was made
[1:54:31] flesh in the form of man he took upon
[1:54:34] him the form of man and was going yonder
[1:54:36] to Calvary to anchor the sting of death
[1:54:39] and death stung the son of God on the
[1:54:41] way to Calvary he anchored pull the
[1:54:44] stinger out of death and today death has
[1:54:47] no sting for the believer for we are
[1:54:50] perfected in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:54:54] There's the blood of Christ what it
[1:54:57] does.
[1:55:00] God perfecting his church. 1954
[1:55:04] he says this. We give God praise tonight
[1:55:07] to know that the Holy Spirit is in us.
[1:55:10] Last night I was teaching of the
[1:55:11] perfection. God perfecting his church.
[1:55:14] Bringing the church to perfection
[1:55:16] through the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:55:18] how we being dead in Christ take on
[1:55:21] Abraham's seed are heirs according to
[1:55:24] the promise and we are perfected not in
[1:55:27] our own self not in our own holiness
[1:55:31] someone said to me not long ago said
[1:55:32] brother Brandham do you believe in
[1:55:34] holiness brother continues on in the
[1:55:37] message perfects in 1957 he says this
[1:55:40] here there you are that's the answer of
[1:55:44] the death of Christ that's the answer to
[1:55:46] Calvary Y he absolutely with his own
[1:55:49] blood purchased our sins and perfected
[1:55:52] forever his believers. Therefore in
[1:55:56] Christ we stand blameless perfected in
[1:56:00] the presence of God Almighty. We are
[1:56:03] underprivileged people with our own
[1:56:06] doctrines. We all been taught that we
[1:56:08] have to get up and uh get up to a
[1:56:11] certain place. We have to do a certain
[1:56:13] thing. No, my brother, it's not you've
[1:56:16] done, it's what God did for you. You, we
[1:56:20] are now, if we are justified by faith,
[1:56:23] we are perfected forever in the presence
[1:56:26] of God. Then Jesus said, "Be ye
[1:56:29] therefore perfect." Then it was
[1:56:31] perfected forever.
[1:56:35] Hebrews chapter 6 number two. Can you
[1:56:37] say praise the Lord? Somebody
[1:56:40] listen close as we read. He said,
[1:56:42] "Leaving the principles of the doctrines
[1:56:44] of Christ, let us go on to perfection."
[1:56:47] Now, we got that this morning.
[1:56:50] He says, "How that we are perfected."
[1:56:53] Perfected.
[1:56:55] Absolutely spotless and blameless. Not
[1:56:58] one sin on us.
[1:57:02] Are you above temptation? Never. Do you
[1:57:05] sin every day? Yes, sir. But yet we are
[1:57:09] perfected because we are in him.
[1:57:13] And God could no more judge us than
[1:57:16] nothing. Couldn't be righteous. He's
[1:57:19] already judge judged us in him. When he
[1:57:24] judged Christ, he judged me. He judged
[1:57:26] you. And he can't judge me again because
[1:57:29] he took my judgment if I be redeemed.
[1:57:33] Praise the Lord. Israel in the church
[1:57:35] 1953
[1:57:37] brother abandon says this paragraph 28
[1:57:41] God has already glorified his church
[1:57:44] those who he justified he's already
[1:57:46] glorified in the church
[1:57:48] in Christ if you're justified in Christ
[1:57:51] you're glorified in Christ already as
[1:57:55] far as God is concerned Jesus said be ye
[1:57:59] therefore perfect even as our even as
[1:58:02] your father in heaven is perfect. H how
[1:58:04] could you ever be perfect? But in the
[1:58:07] sight of Christ tonight, every born
[1:58:10] again Christian is perfect.
[1:58:14] I'm just as perfect in God as Christ
[1:58:18] was. You are too. Every other believer,
[1:58:22] for it's not my holiness, it's his
[1:58:24] holiness. God can't accept mine. I have
[1:58:28] none. But I come in Christ by faith. and
[1:58:32] by Christ I'm in him and perfect in the
[1:58:36] sight of God.
[1:58:39] Praise the Lord.
[1:58:42] Let me read two more on this. All right.
[1:58:44] The position of the believer in Christ.
[1:58:46] Now, the subject is perfection. Now, how
[1:58:49] can a mortal man ever become perfected?
[1:58:52] And yet, God said in his word that he
[1:58:54] chose us to be holy and perfected before
[1:58:57] the foundation of the world. How you
[1:59:00] going to do that? Jesus said, "Be ye
[1:59:02] there per be therefore perfect even as
[1:59:05] your father in heaven is perfect." Is
[1:59:08] that right? Now if God before the world
[1:59:11] ordained that we should be holy and
[1:59:13] without blame and perfect in the sight
[1:59:15] of God and we struggling and murmuring,
[1:59:18] don't you think God seen all these
[1:59:20] things?
[1:59:22] He forneew it and predestinate
[1:59:25] predestined ordained us to be so.
[1:59:29] elected us before the world was ever
[1:59:32] formed.
[1:59:34] Brother Bham continues on.
[1:59:37] Now the blood, this is in the message
[1:59:39] law 1955. The blood could not be perfect
[1:59:43] by an animal, but the blood in Christ
[1:59:45] was perfect.
[1:59:47] Now I will never be perfect and you will
[1:59:50] never be perfect. I will never be
[1:59:52] perfect in your sight. You will never be
[1:59:55] perfect in my sight. But let's lay that
[1:59:58] aside. What about in God's sight? I look
[2:00:03] at you as a human. I look at you as a
[2:00:05] brother. But God looks at you through
[2:00:07] the blood of his son as a redeemed one.
[2:00:13] Jesus said, "Be ye therefore perfect,
[2:00:15] even as your father in heaven is
[2:00:18] perfect." Not what you've done. You have
[2:00:21] nothing to merit it, but it's what
[2:00:24] Christ did for you.
[2:00:28] Praise the Lord. Did he do that for you?
[2:00:32] Then we stand perfect with him.
[2:00:35] We see this prayer that Hezekiah prayed.
[2:00:38] Lord, I stood before you with a perfect
[2:00:40] heart. Can we say that today that we're
[2:00:44] standing in him perfect? Our desires are
[2:00:47] perfect as it aligns with the word of
[2:00:50] God. Our desire to stand with the word
[2:00:55] is our desire to be what the word says
[2:00:59] about us. And it's in this great prayer
[2:01:04] that Hezekiah,
[2:01:06] he prayed this prayer.
[2:01:08] Lord, I have walked before you with a
[2:01:11] perfect heart and I desire more ears. I
[2:01:17] desire that you hear my cry.
[2:01:20] His prayer is found in Isaiah 38:es
[2:01:23] 9-22.
[2:01:26] And it says at the writing of Hezekiah,
[2:01:28] the king of Judah, when he had been sick
[2:01:31] and was recovered of his sickness.
[2:01:34] And he goes on, he talks about how I
[2:01:37] said in the cutting of my off of my
[2:01:39] days, I shall go down to the gates of
[2:01:42] the grave. I am deprived of the residue
[2:01:46] of my years. I said, I shall not see the
[2:01:50] Lord, even the Lord, in the land of the
[2:01:52] living. I shall behold man no more with
[2:01:55] the inhabitants of the world.
[2:01:58] Mine age is departed and is removed from
[2:02:02] me as a shepherd's tent. I have cut off
[2:02:05] like a weaver my life. He will cut me
[2:02:09] off with pining sickness. From day even
[2:02:14] to night wil thou make an end of me. I
[2:02:18] reckon till morning that as a lion so
[2:02:22] will he break all my bones. From day
[2:02:25] even to night will thou make an end of
[2:02:28] me. Like a crane or a swallow, so did I
[2:02:33] chatter. I did mourn as a dove. Mine
[2:02:38] eyes fell with looking up. Oh Lord, I am
[2:02:42] oppressed.
[2:02:44] Undertake for me. This is this is this
[2:02:48] king prayer. He turns his face to the
[2:02:50] wall and this is what his prayer is.
[2:02:52] What shall I say? He hath both spoken
[2:02:56] unto me and himself hath done it. I
[2:02:59] shall go softly all my years in the
[2:03:02] bitterness of my soul. Oh Lord, by these
[2:03:05] things men live, and in all these things
[2:03:08] is the life of my spirit. So wilt thou
[2:03:13] recover me and make me to live. Behold,
[2:03:17] for peace I had great bitterness, but
[2:03:20] thou hast in love to my soul delivered
[2:03:24] it from the pit of corruption. For thou
[2:03:28] hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
[2:03:32] For the grave cannot praise thee. Death
[2:03:35] cannot celebrate thee. They that go down
[2:03:38] into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
[2:03:42] The living, the living, he shall praise
[2:03:45] thee as I do this day. The father to the
[2:03:49] children shall make known thy truth. The
[2:03:53] Lord was ready to save me. Therefore, we
[2:03:55] will sing my songs to the string
[2:03:58] instruments
[2:04:00] all the days of our life in the house of
[2:04:02] the Lord.
[2:04:04] That's pretty much the end of his
[2:04:06] prayer. For Isaiah had said to him,
[2:04:08] "Take a lump of figs and lay it in the
[2:04:10] plaster on the boil, and ye shall
[2:04:13] recover." Hezekiah also said, "What is
[2:04:16] the sign that I shall go up to the house
[2:04:18] of the Lord?" And that sign was that
[2:04:20] that that clock, the sun that that sun
[2:04:24] thou turned black 10 degrees as a sign
[2:04:27] to him. This is a mighty man, a mighty
[2:04:30] king. If you look at his life, how he
[2:04:33] entered into his calling, he could have
[2:04:36] very well easily have gone the way of
[2:04:40] his natural father, but he took the
[2:04:42] heart away, didn't he? He He had to tear
[2:04:46] down years of corrupt teaching and false
[2:04:52] worship. and he had to bring the
[2:04:55] people's minds back to what the original
[2:04:59] way of serving the Lord was. He's just a
[2:05:03] man, but he he's now the king. And if he
[2:05:05] goes evil, the people will go evil with
[2:05:08] him. But I thank God for Hezekiah.
[2:05:12] I thank God for his example.
[2:05:15] I thank God that he was able to call on
[2:05:18] God. And this example shows us that the
[2:05:21] Lord will hear a desperate prayer.
[2:05:24] It is prayer. He says like the swallow
[2:05:27] and the swan. If you ever hear those
[2:05:29] birds out when you're out, you know
[2:05:32] those birds in a dove mourning dove. You
[2:05:34] ever hear doves cooing? It's nonstop.
[2:05:39] Birds in the swallow. Have you out there
[2:05:40] in the wilderness? See the little bird?
[2:05:43] They got these little singing, little
[2:05:45] rings that they do
[2:05:47] all day. All what's that bird singing
[2:05:50] about? It's like nonstop. That's what
[2:05:52] the birds are doing in the wilderness.
[2:05:55] We were out there in in in the
[2:05:57] wilderness and out fishing and you just
[2:05:59] hear the birds just chattering all
[2:06:02] along.
[2:06:03] He said, "The swallows, how they
[2:06:05] chatter." This is what this man is
[2:06:07] praying like.
[2:06:09] Look, he just got a death sentence from
[2:06:12] the most high God who told him, "Set
[2:06:15] your house in order. You're going to
[2:06:17] leave here.
[2:06:18] Thus saith the Lord." And what did he
[2:06:22] do? He turned his face to the wall and
[2:06:25] he prayed this prayer. He goes deep into
[2:06:28] desperation. And we see his cry was,
[2:06:31] "Lord, I walked for before you with a
[2:06:33] perfect heart. I did all these things
[2:06:36] for your name's sake. I followed after
[2:06:38] my father David and for your name's sake
[2:06:42] and the Lord heard his prayer. Delivered
[2:06:45] him out of the hand of Sinakaribb and
[2:06:47] delivered him out of the hand of this
[2:06:50] great threat. They threatened him. They
[2:06:52] threatened the people in the ears of all
[2:06:55] of Israel and they heard this great
[2:06:58] threat. This is a tremendous army. this
[2:07:00] army that was coming to take Hezekiah
[2:07:03] and Judah and Israel, he named off
[2:07:06] several kings and their gods that they
[2:07:10] swallowed up. He said, "Well, God
[2:07:12] delivered all of those other nations
[2:07:15] out of my hand." Don't you think? Don't
[2:07:18] you know you're next, Hezekiah?
[2:07:21] And you people of Israel, don't you
[2:07:23] follow your king now. Don't follow him.
[2:07:25] Don't let him deceive you. Just Just
[2:07:28] surrender. you're going to lose. And
[2:07:30] Hezekiah, the Bible says, he
[2:07:32] strengthened the the people of Israel.
[2:07:37] Look at what he did
[2:07:39] in 2 Chronicles chapter 20.
[2:07:53] Chapter 32, sorry. Verse number 20.
[2:08:02] 2 Chronicles 32:20.
[2:08:06] This is a son being tried.
[2:08:10] This is a son being tested
[2:08:14] like you, like me.
[2:08:18] How many of you can see that it's not
[2:08:20] your life's circumstance
[2:08:24] that you should be complaining about?
[2:08:28] Whatever you're going through today,
[2:08:30] take a deeper look at whatever it is and
[2:08:34] trace back and see where did it come
[2:08:37] from and who's in charge of all.
[2:08:42] And then you'll know that you're a son
[2:08:44] or a daughter of God. And then you'll
[2:08:46] know that this is just a test that's
[2:08:49] absolutely associated with your
[2:08:51] adoption. Amen.
[2:08:55] And this 2 Chronicles chapter what I say
[2:08:59] 32 and verse number two. And this is the
[2:09:02] cause. Yes. Thank you. Hezekiah the king
[2:09:05] the prophet he prayed and cried to
[2:09:09] heaven. And the Lord sent an angel which
[2:09:12] cut off the mighty men of valor and the
[2:09:14] leaders and the captains in the camp of
[2:09:17] the king Assyria. So he returned with
[2:09:20] shame to his face to his own land. And
[2:09:22] when he come into the house of his God,
[2:09:24] they that came forth of his own bow slew
[2:09:27] him there with the sword. Thus the Lord
[2:09:30] saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants
[2:09:33] of Jerusalem from the hand of Sinakaribb
[2:09:36] the king of Assyria, and from the hand
[2:09:38] of all other, and guided them on every
[2:09:41] side. Many brought gifts unto the Lord
[2:09:44] to Jerusalem in prisons to Hezekiah,
[2:09:46] king of Judah, so that he was magnified
[2:09:49] in the sight of all the nations from
[2:09:51] then forth. And in those days Hezekiah
[2:09:54] was sick to death, and prayed unto the
[2:09:56] Lord, and he spake unto him, and he gave
[2:10:00] him a sign.
[2:10:03] But Hezekiah rendered not again
[2:10:05] according to the benefit done unto him,
[2:10:09] for his heart was lifted up.
[2:10:13] Therefore, there was wrath upon him and
[2:10:15] upon Judah and Jerusalem.
[2:10:18] Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled
[2:10:20] himself for the pride of his heart, both
[2:10:22] he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so
[2:10:25] that the wrath of the Lord came not upon
[2:10:27] them in the days of Hezekiah.
[2:10:32] He had great riches, storehouses. Verse
[2:10:35] 29, he provided cities and so forth.
[2:10:39] Verse 31, how be it in the business of
[2:10:42] the ambassadors of the princes of
[2:10:45] Babylon, who sent unto him to inquire of
[2:10:48] the wonder that was done in the land,
[2:10:50] God left him
[2:10:54] to do what to him?
[2:10:56] to try him that he might know all that
[2:11:02] was in his heart.
[2:11:05] Wow, that's something.
[2:11:08] What is that saying? Huh?
[2:11:11] The Lord left him.
[2:11:14] Remember these kings? You take the book
[2:11:17] of Isaiah, you'll get another portion of
[2:11:19] it. These kings came to Hezekiah because
[2:11:21] they heard that he had been sick and now
[2:11:24] he's healed. And they come to see him
[2:11:26] and give God praise that he's now been
[2:11:29] made whole.
[2:11:31] And when they come, Hezekiah shows him
[2:11:34] all that was in the house of the Lord
[2:11:38] and all the things that God had blessed
[2:11:40] him with. And that was that was the
[2:11:43] wrong thing for him to do. And Isaiah
[2:11:46] comes to him and tells him that that
[2:11:49] these kings will come back and take
[2:11:51] everything for you. And we see that his
[2:11:55] heart was perfect,
[2:11:57] but then his heart had some issues in
[2:12:00] it, too. We see both of that. And so,
[2:12:04] it's nice. It's like the book of Isaiah
[2:12:07] and the book of Chronicles and the book
[2:12:09] of Kings are three different stories of
[2:12:12] the same story of the same man in three
[2:12:14] different versions. And I wonder
[2:12:18] if your Sunday morning version is the
[2:12:20] second Chronicles
[2:12:23] and your Monday morning version in
[2:12:26] Isaiah
[2:12:28] and whatever version at the family
[2:12:29] function. And I wonder what version will
[2:12:31] be read about you
[2:12:34] because it's still the same person.
[2:12:37] And although we have this perfection
[2:12:40] that we're under, we see how a man's
[2:12:43] heart, it's really a test. It's a
[2:12:47] testing ground. It's a proving ground
[2:12:50] that everything that we're doing,
[2:12:52] everything that happens to us, it
[2:12:54] doesn't always feel that way, but
[2:12:56] everything that happens to us is under
[2:12:58] this great test.
[2:13:01] Is that right, somebody?
[2:13:03] You are being tested.
[2:13:05] Yes. You know, when the service doesn't
[2:13:08] go your way and your little attitude
[2:13:10] fluffs up, test. Write that down. Watch
[2:13:13] them. Get them. Watch it down. Write it
[2:13:16] down. Write this little note about her.
[2:13:18] Watch her. Watch her to let me throw
[2:13:20] this at her. Let me throw this at her.
[2:13:23] Let me take the money or let me cancel
[2:13:26] the contract on them. Let me demote them
[2:13:29] on the job. Please, somebody drop a lie
[2:13:32] on them.
[2:13:34] Drop a lie. Spread a rumor about her,
[2:13:37] about him. It's all a test, sons and
[2:13:40] daughters of God. It's the tutorer, the
[2:13:43] Holy Spirit watching over you. Jesus, 30
[2:13:47] years of testing, then three years of
[2:13:51] hard test and hard trial. What are you
[2:13:54] going to do under the test, my brother,
[2:13:56] my sister?
[2:13:58] I mean, is shouting and praising only
[2:14:01] when good things are happening?
[2:14:04] Is that what praise and worship is
[2:14:06] about?
[2:14:07] Only the saints that feel good can
[2:14:10] praise the Lord.
[2:14:12] Is that what the service of praise and
[2:14:14] thanksgiving and worship? Is it only
[2:14:17] during the good times?
[2:14:21] Is our Christian experience supposed to
[2:14:23] be some euphoric feeling where we just
[2:14:27] feel on this high 247
[2:14:30] like, "Oh la, oh la,
[2:14:34] I'm so high today.
[2:14:37] High today, high next week, high for
[2:14:39] ever. No, no, no, no, no. You're going
[2:14:41] to come down off that high.
[2:14:46] You're going to come down off of that
[2:14:47] high for sure is the world.
[2:14:51] And somebody or something or some
[2:14:54] individual
[2:14:56] as you're walking down the aisle,
[2:14:57] they're going to stick their foot out
[2:14:58] just like that.
[2:15:02] You going to trip. you going to turn
[2:15:05] back. What you do that for?
[2:15:09] That's this life that we're in.
[2:15:15] It's all a test. Who's testing us? It's
[2:15:17] the Holy Spirit that's testing us under
[2:15:20] tutorers, under governors until the time
[2:15:26] appointed.
[2:15:28] You know, it's sad.
[2:15:30] You know, it's beautiful. Let me not
[2:15:32] sad. It's beautiful. Look at the big
[2:15:34] picture.
[2:15:37] Can I go a little bit further? Yes.
[2:15:42] You know, a family will lose a a member
[2:15:45] in the family and then, you know, mom
[2:15:47] and dad or mom or dad will leave and
[2:15:50] they'll leave a little inheritance for
[2:15:52] the family
[2:15:54] and then that's when the trouble starts.
[2:15:59] Oh my.
[2:16:02] This belongs to me. That belongs to And
[2:16:04] the family members are now arguing over
[2:16:08] what it should have been a beautiful
[2:16:09] time of sending mom or dad away.
[2:16:13] But the inheritance, the money brings
[2:16:16] out all or you take like you know the
[2:16:18] church, our little church acquiring this
[2:16:21] little building and all of the work
[2:16:24] associated with it and then there's the
[2:16:27] test,
[2:16:29] right?
[2:16:31] Oh, I knew you wasn't going to say amen.
[2:16:33] I was referring Maybe I shouldn't say
[2:16:35] it, but I gotta say it. I have to say
[2:16:36] it. It It brings out the best.
[2:16:41] The test brings out the best.
[2:16:46] You see, if I only see you with that
[2:16:48] smile on your face, that's fake.
[2:16:53] Look at your neighbor and say,
[2:16:54] "Neighbor, that's fake."
[2:16:57] If it's only a smile, 247 a smile,
[2:17:01] please.
[2:17:05] You got a scratch in you and you want to
[2:17:08] swing on somebody
[2:17:13] and the test
[2:17:15] brings it all out.
[2:17:18] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Thank I got one
[2:17:21] brother in the back willing to say amen.
[2:17:27] But it brings it out. These tests, these
[2:17:29] trials, things rise up. You mentioned
[2:17:33] me, but you didn't mention the others.
[2:17:36] You said that about my child. You said
[2:17:38] that about this. You said this. And they
[2:17:40] they just happened. And they happen. And
[2:17:43] we think we're just defending ourselves.
[2:17:45] We're defending. Really, brother,
[2:17:47] sister, you're being tested. I'm being
[2:17:50] tested.
[2:17:53] You are being tested
[2:17:56] because of what? Not just for some game.
[2:17:59] Not some playing around with you to see
[2:18:01] who's more spiritual than the other. I'm
[2:18:03] talking about an adoption, my brother,
[2:18:04] my sister. I'm talking about we are
[2:18:07] predestinated to the adoption. So, we
[2:18:11] say we have it. We say we love. We say
[2:18:13] we believe. But God left Hezekiah. He
[2:18:18] left him to see what was in his heart.
[2:18:22] Let's take one more portion with
[2:18:23] Hezekiah. We'll end on the negative. We
[2:18:26] look at Hezekiah in some of his great
[2:18:28] days in 2 Chronicles 32
[2:18:31] and verse number five through8. And
[2:18:35] we'll close there.
[2:18:40] My God left him to try him to see all
[2:18:43] that was in his heart. That's something.
[2:18:46] My
[2:18:48] So he gets this great threat that comes
[2:18:50] his way. This great test comes his way.
[2:18:53] He's a leader to the people. The people
[2:18:56] there are now under this great harm and
[2:19:00] this great threat from a king who has an
[2:19:03] army that many times over
[2:19:08] takes um I mean he's an undefeated king
[2:19:11] really and you're the next one in line.
[2:19:14] And so they get this threat in verse
[2:19:16] this threat in verse number six. And he
[2:19:18] set captives of war over the people. He
[2:19:20] gathered them together to him in the
[2:19:22] street of the gate and of the city and
[2:19:24] spake comfortably to them, saying, "Be
[2:19:28] strong and courageous.
[2:19:31] Be not afraid nor dismayed for the king
[2:19:34] of Assyria, nor for all the multitude
[2:19:37] that is with him. For there be more with
[2:19:41] us than with him.
[2:19:43] With him is an arm of flesh, but with us
[2:19:46] is the Lord our God to help us and to
[2:19:52] fight our battles. And the people rested
[2:19:55] themselves upon the words of Hezekiah,
[2:19:59] king of Judah. You know that that that
[2:20:04] encouragement, that word, be strong of
[2:20:07] good, courageous. You'll notice the Lord
[2:20:09] is he gives that instructions to Moses
[2:20:12] to Israel. He gives that instruction to
[2:20:16] Joshua. King David when he's speaking to
[2:20:19] Solomon he's quoting Moses be strong and
[2:20:22] good courageous. And he's quoting it
[2:20:25] Moses David to Solomon. And this
[2:20:28] instruction here Hezekiah is instructing
[2:20:31] this to his people that are under this
[2:20:34] great threat. He tells him be strong
[2:20:38] and of good courage.
[2:20:43] That word courage
[2:20:46] means to be fra means to be brave. The
[2:20:50] quality of mind which enables men to
[2:20:54] encounter danger and difficulties with
[2:20:59] firmness.
[2:21:01] Courage. The first part of that word is
[2:21:04] the root is French core is from the
[2:21:07] heart. Monor your heart. Courage that's
[2:21:11] that's where that comes from. It comes
[2:21:13] from the heart. Be strong and of good
[2:21:17] courage.
[2:21:19] And this message is repeated over and
[2:21:22] over again to the children of Israel.
[2:21:25] It's repeated to Joshua. It's repeated
[2:21:28] to us even in this day. Be strong and of
[2:21:33] good courage
[2:21:35] that you can stand firm through the
[2:21:37] difficulties and firmness. Stand without
[2:21:41] fear. Stand without the depression of
[2:21:44] your spirit.
[2:21:46] Stand with boldness and resolution.
[2:21:51] Um stand for the duty that is called on
[2:21:56] you to stand with. Be courageous. Be
[2:21:59] courageous.
[2:22:01] Be strong.
[2:22:03] Be courageous. This is what Hezekiah is
[2:22:06] telling the people, encouraging them to
[2:22:08] be strong, of good courage, for the Lord
[2:22:11] thy God is with you.
[2:22:17] We need courage, brothers and sisters,
[2:22:21] to stand in this hour, in this great
[2:22:23] testing time. Remember it's the
[2:22:26] relationship of aba father
[2:22:30] between his child that we're coming to
[2:22:33] the adoption.
[2:22:36] You know the lord will put people in
[2:22:38] your way in your space that are like
[2:22:41] little snags
[2:22:43] to snag you to weight you and allows it
[2:22:47] and he allows it and he allows it.
[2:22:52] Our prayer would be, Lord, send us
[2:22:55] perfect friends
[2:22:57] that never
[2:23:00] dis
[2:23:02] discourage our trust in them. Send us
[2:23:05] perfect co-workers and perfect
[2:23:08] neighbors,
[2:23:10] perfect children and perfect parents,
[2:23:13] perfect pastors and perfect deacons,
[2:23:15] perfect perfect uh song leaders and
[2:23:19] perfect pianists,
[2:23:21] perfect vocalist.
[2:23:24] Send us perfect per and we're all
[2:23:26] perfect.
[2:23:30] That's exactly what he said you.
[2:23:35] Yes. Yes. You join the church thinking
[2:23:40] that everybody's going to respect you
[2:23:47] from the beginning of the journey to the
[2:23:49] end. They're not going to respect you.
[2:23:51] Brother Joseph,
[2:23:54] no. Brother John, they won't respect
[2:23:56] you. Brother Caleb
[2:23:58] got something to say about you.
[2:24:02] I don't like this. I don't like that. I
[2:24:04] don't like this. And what you going to
[2:24:06] do about it? What you going to do about
[2:24:07] it?
[2:24:10] You're being tested, my brother. And
[2:24:12] that's what it's all about. It's not
[2:24:15] about me liking you more or him liking
[2:24:17] her more or this one gets favored and
[2:24:20] that one gets more and this one and
[2:24:22] this. Brother, you're tested. Sister,
[2:24:25] you're being tested. If I'm reading the
[2:24:27] word of God right, that's what it is.
[2:24:30] And our attitude towards it. He's
[2:24:33] looking at us.
[2:24:40] We should test the song leader one day,
[2:24:42] shouldn't we?
[2:24:44] We all just all just come. Don't nobody
[2:24:46] sing. Don't nobody just give him a hard
[2:24:49] time. Don't say nothing. See how he does
[2:24:52] under that.
[2:24:54] Huh? Oh, yeah. Would that be a test? How
[2:24:57] many's ever led a song service?
[2:25:00] That would be a test, right, Brother
[2:25:02] John? You get up to lead service, it's
[2:25:04] like people are trying to make you mad.
[2:25:15] Let's put him to the test one day. Let's
[2:25:17] see if he's a real song leader. What
[2:25:19] would a real song leader do?
[2:25:24] He would blank all of he'll put some
[2:25:25] glasses on that he can't see like bif
[2:25:27] focals where he can't see you and he
[2:25:30] would sing the praises to the Lord once
[2:25:33] he figured out what was going on
[2:25:35] like they are off the word. I am on the
[2:25:38] word and I'm going to sing praises
[2:25:42] anyhow.
[2:25:43] I'll sing praises by myself.
[2:25:47] Yes. That's what a song leader would do.
[2:25:51] He passes the test.
[2:25:56] Don't ask me what I would do if y'all
[2:25:59] didn't say amen
[2:26:01] because I've already passed that test.
[2:26:05] God bless you.
[2:26:08] No, not you guys always say amen.
[2:26:12] God bless you. But it's all a test.
[2:26:14] That's what it is. And it's not a test
[2:26:17] of how much love, how much. It's a test
[2:26:19] to the adoption. Amen.
[2:26:24] It's the adoption. That's what it's
[2:26:26] about. Watch him for a few years. Watch
[2:26:29] him for a few years. Then give them a
[2:26:31] hard test. Now put him in his place.
[2:26:36] Place him with the authority. Amen. Let
[2:26:38] us pray. Amen. The musicians come.
[2:26:44] Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word
[2:26:47] today. A few words of this great servant
[2:26:51] Hezekiah.
[2:26:53] How you left him to prove him, to try
[2:26:55] what was in his heart. How you heard his
[2:26:58] prayer. You used him mightily.
[2:27:02] You gave him 15 more years when you had
[2:27:05] pronounced. You actually changed
[2:27:08] your mind for him. Oh God. And you
[2:27:13] actually love Hezekiah
[2:27:15] because he walked in the spirit of his
[2:27:18] father David.
[2:27:21] Not as carnal
[2:27:26] father Ahaz who walked wickedly.
[2:27:30] No, no, no. He he took a stand on the
[2:27:33] word of God. Lord, we thank you for
[2:27:36] that.
