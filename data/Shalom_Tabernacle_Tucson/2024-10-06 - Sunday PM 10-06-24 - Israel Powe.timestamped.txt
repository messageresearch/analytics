[38:06] portion of the service we pray and ask
[38:08] your blessings now in jesus' name amen
[38:13] amen God bless
[38:18] you we used to say in the U Pentecostal
[38:22] church we say praise the Lord everybody
[38:25] and the Saints would say praise the Lord
[38:27] Lord and so when I say God bless you
[38:30] it's okay if you say God bless
[38:32] you praise the Lord God bless each of
[38:35] you so happy to be in the house of the
[38:36] Lord with you this evening we're going
[38:38] to the table of the Lord here and just
[38:41] for a few scriptures I really wanted to
[38:44] lay in that Revelations 18 and tying
[38:48] that into the angel the seventh angel
[38:51] but I'm just moved to go in a little bit
[38:54] different direction just to maybe
[38:56] comment on communion just a little bit
[38:58] and that's found in 1 Corinthians
[39:01] chapter 11 as we all know if we can
[39:03] stand to our feet and turn there
[39:31] amen thank the Lord if you have that you
[39:33] can say
[39:35] Amen verse 27 says
[39:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[39:41] and drink this cup of the Lord
[39:44] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[39:47] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[39:50] examine himself and so let him eat of
[39:53] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[39:56] that eateth and
[39:59] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[40:02] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[40:06] Lord's body for this cause many are we
[40:09] weak and sickly among you and many sleep
[40:14] take one more scripture in Isaiah
[40:18] 28 Old
[40:23] Testament verse number eight
[40:32] of course brother Banner refers to this
[40:33] scripture many times speaking of the age
[40:37] and hour that we live in
[40:40] now and says for all the tables are full
[40:43] of vomit and filthiness so that there is
[40:46] no place
[40:47] clean Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom
[40:52] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[40:55] them that are wean from the milk and
[40:57] drawn from the breast for precept must
[41:00] be upon precept precept upon precept
[41:03] line upon line line upon line here a
[41:06] little and there a little with
[41:09] stammering lips and another tongue will
[41:11] I speak to this people amen and so we're
[41:15] going to speak a few minutes on this
[41:18] communion and Discerning the Lord's body
[41:21] may God bless you you may be
[41:24] seated this um kind of goes
[41:28] into uh this message from this morning
[41:31] touch not my anointed and I brought that
[41:34] two ways and bringing it touch not the
[41:36] anointing that is in the elect the
[41:39] Christian the prophet the pastor the
[41:42] believer but there's an anointing in the
[41:44] word as well that those that are
[41:47] qualified can move forward and there's
[41:50] disciplines that are required when we go
[41:52] and handle the word just like any
[41:55] other um the examples that I gave surely
[42:00] um in handling God's word we have to
[42:02] have these disciplines and this is
[42:05] another one here in
[42:08] Discerning the body of the
[42:11] Lord the scripture tells us to let a man
[42:14] examine himself and this is the
[42:16] communion uh service here many times in
[42:19] many assemblies this is probably the
[42:23] least people that would come to
[42:25] communion service would you say brother
[42:26] George and different brothers that have
[42:28] been around brother um Joel brother Joel
[42:32] will be uh sojourning here with us for
[42:35] few weeks a month a few months him and
[42:38] his wife three months yes for sure maybe
[42:40] six and so we're so happy to have him
[42:43] with us he was a pastor for how many
[42:46] years 14 years in Phoenix and I knew him
[42:50] back then years ago and so so happy to
[42:54] have him with us him and his wife sister
[42:56] p
[42:58] Pamela they'll be here with us for some
[43:00] time but as you look across and you see
[43:02] this Discerning of the Lord's body the
[43:05] communion service it's what believers do
[43:08] it is part of our Christian experience
[43:12] and Paul here brings this not Discerning
[43:16] or eating of it unworthily into play and
[43:21] as I said this morning you
[43:23] know I can't preach you into being some
[43:27] something that you don't decide to
[43:29] become
[43:30] yourself uh the word of God the prophet
[43:33] of God the Bible itself being played in
[43:36] your home in whatever format it's played
[43:40] if you don't make the decision to
[43:42] receive it it won't benefit you amen
[43:46] there were people in brandham Tabernacle
[43:48] that walked away from his ministry saw
[43:51] the signs wonders and miracles and they
[43:54] walked away it wasn't an IND ment on his
[43:57] ministry or the Bible or the truth is
[44:00] what is it was decisions it's the
[44:03] decision that each one of us have to
[44:06] make and so I like that scripture it
[44:09] says let a man examine
[44:11] himself not you examining me not me
[44:15] Examining you when you're really
[44:17] repenting you're not looking at nobody
[44:20] else amen Saints when you're really
[44:23] trying to get closer to the Lord
[44:25] everybody else no one else is in the
[44:28] picture it's between you and God and let
[44:32] a man examine himself if you're okay to
[44:37] do it with it within you and the Lord
[44:40] then go do
[44:42] it there shouldn't be any condemnation
[44:44] in your heart if there is then you're
[44:46] not walking in faith and you shouldn't
[44:49] do it anyways and so once you have that
[44:52] is reconciled within you and I'm
[44:55] speaking from experience when there's
[44:57] something in the word that you have
[44:59] reconciled how you're going to handle it
[45:02] then it's okay if others don't see it or
[45:04] get it because you you've settled it
[45:07] between you and the Lord let a man
[45:09] examine
[45:12] himself then let him go eat of that
[45:15] bread and drink of that cup so let's
[45:18] take in the message here brother Brandon
[45:20] and questions and answers
[45:22] 1954 he says this here paragraph 2:10
[45:26] now it's communion time while we bow our
[45:29] heads I'm going to ask someone to come
[45:31] to the piano Lord this is the hour the
[45:34] time that when maybe men and women Lord
[45:37] across the world will see that the great
[45:40] hour of judgment is approaching when God
[45:44] will judge all nations in their
[45:47] political
[45:49] standings everywhere every place and
[45:52] Everybody Must Stand the judgments of
[45:55] God and father we're so happy to know
[45:59] that there is an escape of these people
[46:02] who would desire to escape and that root
[46:06] is through Jesus Christ who is The
[46:09] Offspring of David and we thank thee
[46:12] dear father for ever sending him to the
[46:14] Earth that he was the medium that we can
[46:17] go through he would intercede for us and
[46:20] take away our sins that we'd escape the
[46:24] wrath and the damnation of God we know
[46:27] that the Wrath is to come and as John
[46:30] said in the days gone by flee from the
[46:33] Wrath that is to come now Lord we pray
[46:36] that as we take communion tonight that
[46:39] you will sanctify us Lord with your
[46:43] cleansing blood and may every sin of
[46:46] these people be remitted I humbly and
[46:49] sincerely pray God that you'll not let
[46:52] one of us take it unworthily for thou
[46:55] has said in Thy Word if we do so we're
[46:58] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[47:01] now father make these people holy and
[47:05] consecrated that we may take this
[47:08] without a
[47:10] blemish isn't that how you want to come
[47:12] to the table of the Lord to take it
[47:16] without a blemish now I can't stand here
[47:19] and tell you whether you have a blemish
[47:22] or not but if you'll examine
[47:25] yourself before the Lord Lord and you
[47:28] need to take that up with him and ask
[47:30] him to cleanse you I love this prayer
[47:32] and I love how brother Randon brought
[47:34] that Amen in 1954 Redemption by power he
[47:38] says
[47:40] this here's a sad picture before we get
[47:43] over to our regular lesson is found the
[47:45] 38th verse and a mixed multitude went up
[47:49] with their flock there's where Israel
[47:51] made a mistake the supernatural had been
[47:54] done an unconverted people followed
[47:58] because of the supernatural finally got
[48:01] them into trouble and on down we'll
[48:03] notice here about the 42nd verse and the
[48:05] 43rd verse the Lord speaking to Moses
[48:09] said that no one but those who were th
[48:12] those who were sacrificed could eat the
[48:15] sacrifice rather but those who were
[48:18] circumcised no strangers no Outsiders no
[48:23] one should take it but those who are
[48:25] circumcised
[48:27] and what a disgrace that we have today
[48:29] in this day beloved friends that when in
[48:32] the church everybody that belongs to the
[48:34] church takes communion and that's wrong
[48:38] only those who are redeemed that's all
[48:42] who are worthy Isaiah spoke and said the
[48:45] tables of the Lord will be full of vomit
[48:48] said who shall I teach Doctrine them
[48:50] that are weaned from the breast said
[48:52] precept must be upon precept line upon
[48:55] line hear a little there a little hold
[48:58] fast to that what's good God speaking
[49:02] knowing that the day that we're living
[49:04] in that the church would be so
[49:07] politically till they' let everything
[49:10] people come in as long as they had their
[49:13] name on the church book they were
[49:14] members they taken communion and the
[49:17] Bible said he that eats and drinks it
[49:20] unworthily is guilty of the body and
[49:22] blood of the Lord St John 13th chapter
[49:26] Jesus speaking 2 Corinthians the 11th
[49:29] chapter Paul said years later he that
[49:32] eats and drinks this unworthily shall be
[49:34] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[49:37] let a man examine himself he says before
[49:41] he take I'm quoting scripture that's
[49:44] right he that eats and drinks
[49:47] unworthy eats and drinks damnation to
[49:50] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[49:54] and for this cause many are sick and
[49:56] weakly among you and many sleep be sure
[50:01] that you're standing right with
[50:03] God here it is in the shadow that no one
[50:06] but the circumcised no matter how loyal
[50:09] he was how much he helped the Jewish
[50:11] church he had to be a proelite he had to
[50:15] be a real circumcised believer before he
[50:19] could take the communion or eat the
[50:22] Passover oh how far we got off the line
[50:26] to today amen so a True Believer is the
[50:30] one that takes this um Passover this
[50:35] supper it's um brother rand's going to
[50:39] tell us what that means you know there's
[50:42] a difference between a Believer and an
[50:44] unbeliever and God makes that difference
[50:47] and when the believer examines himself
[50:51] he knows what he's doing when he
[50:53] partakes he examines his faith he examin
[50:56] his walk with the Lord he examines the
[50:59] life that he's living before he takes
[51:02] his hand upon that Sacrament and eat and
[51:06] drink of the cup amen because it is um
[51:14] there's a consequence with it there's a
[51:16] blessing with it but there's also a
[51:18] consequence in the Jubilee year 1954 the
[51:21] prophet says this what does this mean
[51:23] brother brandom it means this
[51:27] if you come and take communion and go
[51:29] out and live a different kind of a life
[51:31] than what a Christian ought to live you
[51:34] are bringing
[51:36] reproach and disgrace to the cause of
[51:39] the Lord Jesus Christ you understand it
[51:43] if you're a Christian come if you're not
[51:46] don't do it look but let a man examine
[51:49] himself and so let him eat that bread
[51:51] and drink that cup all right 29th verse
[51:54] for he that eateth and drinketh
[51:55] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[51:58] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[52:00] body for this caus many are sick and
[52:02] weakly among you and many sleep for we
[52:06] should judge ourselves we should not be
[52:08] judged but when we are judged we're
[52:11] chasen of the Lord that we should not be
[52:14] condemned with the world when we eat
[52:16] this bread and drink this cup let's
[52:19] examine ourself and say now do I now
[52:22] walk
[52:24] worthy well I don't walk worthy worthy
[52:26] no but Christ in me makes me walk worthy
[52:31] I love him I testify of him I'm not
[52:35] perfect never will be in this world
[52:37] you're not perfect never will be but my
[52:40] love to him and he lets me live for him
[52:44] and I love to do it and to testify of
[52:47] him I don't go out and carouse I do and
[52:50] do things evil that brings reproach to
[52:53] his name but if I find out that I do
[52:56] something then I'm chastened of the Lord
[53:01] Lord why does God do this that we
[53:04] wouldn't be condemned with the
[53:07] world how many wants to be chasen of the
[53:10] Lord you know if the Lord is chasing in
[53:13] you don't you think you deserve
[53:16] it if it's the
[53:18] Lord um I got some SP some spankings
[53:22] that I didn't deserve but I got away
[53:25] with more
[53:27] I should have got a lot more spank kins
[53:30] and you know and I felt so unjust it
[53:34] felt so unjust when my mom got me or my
[53:37] dad got me when I was actually innocent
[53:39] of the
[53:41] crime and my mom would say Israel but if
[53:45] you've ever done anything that you got
[53:47] away with this will make up for that and
[53:49] then guess what the argument was over
[53:52] then cuz I got away with the
[53:55] lot it was groups of us so we can hide
[53:57] behind each other's mischief and my
[54:00] mother knew sometimes she would spank Us
[54:03] in groups how's had a group whooping she
[54:06] say all of you line up cuz somebody's
[54:08] lying and I'm just going to beat all of
[54:10] you and she would she tearing all of us
[54:14] but Mama it wasn't me it wasn't me you
[54:16] was guilty before and it's like okay
[54:20] argument
[54:21] over and so this chesting of the Lord is
[54:25] for your own good it's so that you won't
[54:28] be condemned with the
[54:31] world Prophet continues now there's a
[54:33] great difference between the believer
[54:35] and the unbeliever god makes a
[54:37] difference remember the Believers in
[54:40] Egypt was all on the inside under what
[54:42] under the blood the lamb was killed and
[54:45] its blood with hiss up was sprinkled on
[54:48] the door look where it was put at on the
[54:51] lentil of the door that's the door jam
[54:54] you have to go through the L of the door
[54:57] and on the doorpost see what it is the
[55:00] cross hundreds of years before the Lamb
[55:02] of God came and was slain but it's a
[55:05] type of the Lamb it was put on the
[55:07] lentil of the door and every Israelite
[55:09] coming under that blood was forbidden to
[55:12] go out
[55:13] anymore there you are forbidden to go
[55:16] out they were under the blood they could
[55:19] not go until orders came to March orders
[55:23] to go forward type of Christ once for by
[55:27] one sacrifice has he perfected forever
[55:31] those that are Sanctified in Christ
[55:33] Jesus once and for all no more turning
[55:36] back no more going this no more doing
[55:38] that oh you'll you'll backslide and do
[55:42] things that's wrong and come on see but
[55:45] one time Christ sanctifies a human soul
[55:48] by filling him with the holy spirit it's
[55:51] perfected forever there you are no more
[55:55] desire to do wrong for the worshipper
[55:58] once purged has no more conscience or
[56:01] desire the right translation the
[56:03] worshipper once purged oh I wish I could
[56:07] just sink that deep the worshipper the
[56:10] believer once purged has no more desire
[56:13] of sin nowhere settled forever for he
[56:18] has per he has perfected by one
[56:21] sacrifice forever those that are in
[56:24] Christ Jesus the world becomes dead you
[56:26] don't care for it no more your
[56:28] affections are set on things above now
[56:31] if you are saying you're a Christian and
[56:33] still living worldly lives then you are
[56:37] chasen of the Lord for you should not be
[56:40] condemned with the world wherefore when
[56:43] you come
[56:44] together my brethren when you come
[56:47] together to eat Terry one for another
[56:49] watch and if any man hunger let him eat
[56:51] at home that you come not together un
[56:53] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[56:55] order when when I come you notice Paul
[56:58] here those Corinthians they didn't get
[57:00] it they went up there and even got drunk
[57:04] at the Lord's table they eat and drink
[57:07] and done everything wrong Paul said when
[57:10] you come together if a man's hungry let
[57:13] him eat at home but when you come
[57:15] together t one for another in other
[57:17] words wait on one another you say now
[57:21] here's a brother that I don't think
[57:23] ought to take communion but don't run up
[57:26] there and jerk him out have patience
[57:29] with him after the service is over and a
[57:32] time when he come over to his house some
[57:35] night and sit down and say brother now
[57:38] forgive me if I'm wrong but I seen you
[57:40] down the other day on the strink drunk
[57:43] whatever it was he was doing out with
[57:44] some other lady that wasn't his wife and
[57:47] you're taking communion I love your
[57:49] brother let you and I pray over this
[57:53] thing and straighten it up see wait on
[57:57] one another do service for one another
[58:01] don't be bigger than somebody else try
[58:04] and see how little you can be I've often
[58:07] heard it say don't never be big in your
[58:10] own sight if you're big let it be in
[58:13] God's sight be little in your own sight
[58:17] every man that humbles himself God will
[58:19] exalt those who he exalts themselves God
[58:22] will bring a base how many love that
[58:25] amen how do we wait on one another we go
[58:28] to one another but now we talk about one
[58:31] another but we won't go to one another
[58:34] and talk these things through and pray
[58:36] for one another amen I've seen sister
[58:39] sewing so I've seen Brother sewing so
[58:42] and they're even taking the communion
[58:45] and what's your responsibility is to
[58:47] pray for them and go to them is that
[58:50] right huh and I know it's not it's not
[58:53] common or custom because people don't
[58:56] like other people in their business but
[58:57] this isn't about other people this is
[58:59] about what the word of God says if you
[59:02] can't go to them and pray for them don't
[59:04] even talk about them don't don't gossip
[59:08] about them if you don't have the courage
[59:10] to go to them and look to them eyeball
[59:12] to eyeball and talk with them and share
[59:15] with them in a Godly considerate way
[59:18] then don't be sharing what you saw them
[59:20] doing and not doing and gossiping and
[59:22] all that kind of stuff it's just not
[59:24] scriptural amen somebody
[59:26] amen all right and Discerning the body
[59:31] of the Lord Brother random says this
[59:36] here I like this now our Eternal
[59:39] destination is not altogether determined
[59:42] by what we see and what we hear but it's
[59:45] determined on what discernment we have
[59:48] of what we see and what we hear Paul was
[59:52] not disputing with them for taking the
[59:54] communion their Act was right but their
[59:57] discernment was wrong for taking the
[1:00:00] Lord's Supper is the Commandment of the
[1:00:03] Lord but to take it unworthily not
[1:00:05] Discerning the Lord's body is where the
[1:00:09] wrong lays these Christians was taking
[1:00:12] the communion and not living the life
[1:00:16] Christianity is an experience in a life
[1:00:19] and these Christians was just living any
[1:00:20] kind of a life making a poor example of
[1:00:23] their profession and Paul says that this
[1:00:25] caused many are sick and weakly among
[1:00:29] you and many are asleep which means they
[1:00:32] are dead because they haven't discerned
[1:00:36] the body of the Lord let me stop there
[1:00:37] for a minute one of our prayers should
[1:00:40] be Lord give me the discernment of your
[1:00:42] body you know my prayer is that we'd see
[1:00:46] more healings in this church than we've
[1:00:48] ever seen before we see more baptism
[1:00:51] more people sa more people filled with
[1:00:52] the Holy Ghost than ever before that is
[1:00:55] my prayer that's my open confession in
[1:00:58] prayer and I'm believing God for that
[1:01:01] amen amen and that's what his word said
[1:01:05] the true church the real Church would
[1:01:07] have amongst them and this is part of it
[1:01:11] it's Discerning One Another Touch not my
[1:01:15] anointed my anointed Saints my Believers
[1:01:18] the brother sister sitting next to you
[1:01:20] if he's a little bitty Christian he's a
[1:01:22] big Christian he's a preacher you have
[1:01:24] to respect them
[1:01:26] as
[1:01:27] Believers and our love should be for
[1:01:30] them to see them grow and get better and
[1:01:34] this Discerning of the Lord's body is
[1:01:36] that you know I'm Discerning the Lord
[1:01:38] Lord give me
[1:01:39] discernment of the Lord's body and he
[1:01:42] says they're taking the these Christians
[1:01:46] and we and we who call ourselves
[1:01:48] Christians we have no right to take the
[1:01:50] communion unless we are living above
[1:01:53] reproach of the world we have no right
[1:01:57] the communion are for those who are
[1:01:59] living right as an example of
[1:02:03] Christianity the worst thing there is in
[1:02:05] the world is a person to try to
[1:02:07] impersonate something and there's too
[1:02:10] much of that in the world today not only
[1:02:12] do we in this day are guilty of the same
[1:02:16] crime that Paul was rebuking the
[1:02:18] Corinthian Church for but of trying to
[1:02:20] do something that the Lord had commanded
[1:02:23] without Discerning the body of the Lord
[1:02:26] and the body of the Lord is the
[1:02:29] Believers but today we are doing things
[1:02:32] not Discerning any of the word of God we
[1:02:35] should have a discernment on everything
[1:02:37] that we do it ought to be measured by
[1:02:41] the word of God all that Christians do
[1:02:44] and say should be measured by the word
[1:02:49] of God how many can say Amen to that
[1:02:52] what is the word of God that's this
[1:02:54] message that's this this Bible
[1:02:57] everything that we do every activity
[1:03:00] fathers mothers everything that we do
[1:03:04] ought to be discerned by the word of God
[1:03:08] Amen in the message
[1:03:10] communion prophet of God says this
[1:03:14] here he he goes into this discernment a
[1:03:17] little bit more if I can bring this up
[1:03:20] just for a moment paragraph number
[1:03:23] six may I bring that point when we are
[1:03:26] judged by the word which is Christ we're
[1:03:30] chasing if we're doing wrong we're not
[1:03:32] living up to this word we're chasen of
[1:03:35] the Lord and when the Lord chastens us
[1:03:38] that mean corrects us that we should not
[1:03:40] be condemned with the world so he deals
[1:03:43] with this discernment a little bit in
[1:03:45] paragraph same message in paragraph
[1:03:47] number eight and he says this here the
[1:03:52] discernment this is in the message
[1:03:54] communion July seven is paragraph number
[1:03:57] eight the very same message I was just
[1:03:58] in paragraph number eight the
[1:04:01] discernment of knowing that you are the
[1:04:04] Lord's
[1:04:07] body
[1:04:10] sorry I should have just stay with Let's
[1:04:14] see we okay there
[1:04:18] see paragraph number 8
[1:04:25] in the message communion July 7 thank
[1:04:28] you if we got
[1:04:31] it yeah the numbers are off so sometimes
[1:04:34] it does that sorry so it's number eight
[1:04:37] for me it's 15 for you all right the
[1:04:40] discernment of knowing that you are the
[1:04:43] Lord's body you can't discern it in
[1:04:47] wickedness and sin that's right we've
[1:04:49] got to be above that that we discern
[1:04:52] that the Lord is righteous and we
[1:04:55] discern that he's our perpetuation that
[1:04:58] all of our sins we've confessed and we
[1:05:01] believe in him of waiting upon his
[1:05:04] atonement to cleanse us from all of our
[1:05:06] iniquity then we're Discerning the
[1:05:08] Lord's body to what it discernment of
[1:05:13] what it's for and then Discerning again
[1:05:17] that in among us as the Lord's bride
[1:05:21] body let's discern if there's anything
[1:05:24] wrong with us
[1:05:26] in here that would hinder the gospel
[1:05:29] from growing or the Lord from presenting
[1:05:33] us before God as a Chase version let's
[1:05:37] discern that out right now and find if
[1:05:40] it's wrong let's confess it if it's
[1:05:43] wrong let's say Lord I'm sorry about
[1:05:46] that so you can you see why uh uh
[1:05:50] communion service is so beautiful we
[1:05:53] have it once a month
[1:05:55] and
[1:05:56] um and I know uh we've been criticized a
[1:06:01] number of times for having it uh so
[1:06:03] regular um but that's the that's what
[1:06:07] brother brandham did and you know and so
[1:06:10] um the communion it gives us an
[1:06:12] opportunity to to take this these
[1:06:16] scriptures in Discerning what's the
[1:06:18] discernment I'll read it again the
[1:06:20] discernment of knowing that you are the
[1:06:22] Lord's body yes you can't discern in
[1:06:26] wickedness and sin we've got to be above
[1:06:29] that that we discern that the Lord is
[1:06:32] righteous and we discern that he's our
[1:06:35] perpetuation that all of our sins we've
[1:06:37] confessed and we uh and we believe in
[1:06:41] him of waiting upon his atonement to
[1:06:43] cleanse us from all our iniquity then
[1:06:46] we're Discerning the Lord's body to what
[1:06:50] it discernment of what it's for and then
[1:06:53] Discerning again that in among us as the
[1:06:57] Lord's bride body let's discern if
[1:07:00] there's anything wrong with us in here
[1:07:04] that would hinder the gospel from
[1:07:08] growing or the Lord from presenting us
[1:07:11] before God as a Chase virgin don't you
[1:07:15] want to know that if you're if there's a
[1:07:17] hindrance there don't wouldn't you want
[1:07:18] to know that if you're hindering the
[1:07:21] work of the Lord wouldn't you want to
[1:07:23] know huh sure you want to know I would
[1:07:26] want to know I want that I want to
[1:07:30] discern that to
[1:07:33] know if we're hindering the Lord's body
[1:07:37] so therefore it might be
[1:07:40] something that we've done you've done
[1:07:43] something I've done it might not be
[1:07:45] consciously right now let's ask God to
[1:07:49] forgive us for it we used to sing a song
[1:07:52] Here forgive the sins I have confessed
[1:07:54] to thee for forgive the secret sins you
