[44:12] thank you Lord we love you
[44:14] in Jesus name we pray amen
[44:16] amen we give the Lord a hand to praise
[44:19] that's
[44:20] gratefulness and thankfulness
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:26] as I said to the church before I don't
[44:29] have no other place to go
[44:31] but this right here if this doesn't work
[44:34] I don't have a plan B this is it for me
[44:37] I I have nothing else outside of the
[44:40] word of the Lord Jesus I've put
[44:43] everything I got into this
[44:45] amen I believe you did the same thing
[44:47] amen
[44:49] amen so we just certainly honor the Lord
[44:51] we want to get right into the word
[44:53] before we go to the table of the lord we
[44:55] like to greet each of you and the
[44:57] precious name of our Lord and savior
[45:00] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[45:03] he's the reason that we're here tonight
[45:05] we come under expectation for what he
[45:09] has for us amen and we don't want to
[45:13] leave here disappointed and I don't
[45:15] believe the Lord wants us to leave here
[45:16] disappointed either he has something for
[45:19] each and every one of us I believe that
[45:21] hey man I'd like you to take your Bibles
[45:23] and turn into
[45:25] Ephesians chapter 5.
[45:30] we'll finish up a little bit from
[45:33] the faith for the rapture
[45:36] rapturing Faith was the requirement for
[45:39] the age
[45:42] in
[45:44] Ephesians chapter 5.
[45:53] and you have that you can say Amen
[46:02] verse
[46:05] number 21 23 for the husband is the head
[46:10] of the wife even as Christ is the head
[46:14] of the church and he is the savior of
[46:18] the body
[46:19] therefore as the church is subject unto
[46:21] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[46:24] husband and every
[46:26] in everything amen because Christ
[46:30] is the head we know that amen we'll take
[46:33] one more scripture
[46:35] second Corinthians chapter 2
[46:43] verse number
[46:54] eight
[46:57] wherefore I beseech you
[46:59] that you would confirm your love towards
[47:01] him
[47:02] for to this end also did I write that I
[47:04] might know the proof of you whether you
[47:07] be obedient in all things
[47:10] to whom ye forgive anything I forgive
[47:12] also for for I forgave anything to whom
[47:16] I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it
[47:21] in the person of Christ
[47:23] lest Satan should get an advantage of us
[47:27] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[47:31] that man we'll take one more scripture
[47:33] and second Thessalonians
[47:36] that we read this warning
[47:41] I want to just love the Lord
[47:44] chapter 4 first Thessalonians chapter
[47:46] four always get that mixed up
[47:49] first Thessalonians chapter four
[47:54] and verse 13.
[48:00] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[48:02] Brethren concerning them which are
[48:04] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[48:07] others which have no hope
[48:09] for we believe that Jesus died and rose
[48:11] again even so them also would sleep and
[48:15] Jesus will God bring with him
[48:17] for this we say unto you by the word of
[48:19] the Lord that we which are alive and
[48:22] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[48:25] not hinder shall not prevent them which
[48:29] are asleep
[48:30] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[48:33] heaven with the shout we know what that
[48:36] shout is don't we with the voice of the
[48:39] Archangel and with the Trump of God
[48:43] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[48:48] then we which are alive and remain
[48:52] shall be caught up together with them in
[48:55] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[48:58] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[49:01] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[49:04] words Heavenly Father we thank you for
[49:06] your word tonight bless us Lord help us
[49:10] father to get into your word and receive
[49:13] from you
[49:14] the portion that you have for us Lord
[49:17] let the young ones and the older ones
[49:19] each one receive their portion for this
[49:22] message tonight we commit ourselves to
[49:25] you
[49:26] abind us from speaking anything that's
[49:29] contrary to you forgive us of our sins
[49:32] Lord as we stand here in your presence
[49:35] in the presence of these people
[49:37] forgive us of our shortcomings our
[49:39] weaknesses and frailties
[49:41] and look upon the need of our heart and
[49:43] give us exactly what we have need of as
[49:46] our prayer we ask in Jesus name
[49:49] amen God bless you you can be seated
[49:54] we spoke this morning faith for the
[49:56] Rapture we'll continue with that
[49:58] therefore to keep bothering me up here
[50:02] faith for the rapture
[50:04] and brother banham calls it rapturing
[50:07] faith
[50:08] and I'm just gonna just to add to that
[50:11] wrap the Rapture is at hand
[50:15] the Rapture is at hand that's what's
[50:20] before us is the rapture
[50:23] I might miss a lot of things we don't
[50:25] want to miss that
[50:26] and we can spend our time in a lot of
[50:29] things and we actually get so upset
[50:33] and so moved out of our place over
[50:36] things and people that are not eternal
[50:40] we get upset at things that are just
[50:42] temporal
[50:44] be mad for weeks you can't remember what
[50:47] really made you mad
[50:49] but you hold on to it
[50:52] preach pastor
[50:54] hold on to it and then you try to find
[50:58] out why was I mad at you again
[51:01] it was something
[51:04] but
[51:05] but
[51:06] life is too short to be mad at things
[51:09] that ain't even eternal
[51:12] when we get on the other side ain't
[51:14] gonna be no mad folks over there
[51:17] and we're going to be we ain't gonna be
[51:19] proud for I saw this before you saw this
[51:22] or I was more anointed than you were and
[51:24] I pre I was gifted more gifted and none
[51:27] of that would be over there
[51:29] so let's Let It Go let's Let It Go now
[51:32] Lord help me get that off of me now
[51:35] get it off I'm trying to get into a
[51:37] rapture I want my focus my view for the
[51:40] coming of the Lord and that is what is
[51:43] what is at hand it's the Rapture that is
[51:46] at hand
[51:48] brother random takes this message
[51:49] insists I'm just going to be in one
[51:51] message here tonight just for a few
[51:53] moments and it's Christ The Mystery of
[51:55] God revealed
[51:57] the end of that message I read it for
[51:58] you this morning her brother Branham
[52:00] strikes the clock at two o'clock after
[52:03] preaching for nearly four hours
[52:06] four hours of a sermon
[52:09] he looks at the clock he said if you're
[52:12] spiritual you watch spiritual things you
[52:16] think God would be in something like
[52:17] that oh certainly
[52:19] he designs things that way he sets
[52:22] things up
[52:23] sometimes we don't catch it sometimes we
[52:25] can't see it
[52:27] but he's still there
[52:29] and once he's once he shows it to you
[52:32] you can't help but see it
[52:35] I uh what went to this customer's house
[52:38] the other day and um you know and this
[52:42] person needed their house painted and
[52:44] the first thing they told me is like
[52:46] you know I really don't need my house
[52:48] painted I just need this little part
[52:49] over here painted and I'm thinking to
[52:52] myself
[52:53] that's like me going into the dentist
[52:55] office and trying to tell the dentist
[52:57] what I don't need
[53:00] uh he's gonna tell me they're my teeth
[53:03] but he knows about my teeth
[53:06] and so I I asked the lady I said who
[53:08] told you that you didn't get your house
[53:09] painted well I just I'm sure of it I
[53:12] said okay well if I show you some things
[53:16] uh it's not me doing anything I'm just
[53:19] going to show you and once I show you
[53:21] then you can't unsee it
[53:25] okay fair oh I'm sure I'm sure
[53:28] I said man do you see that spot up there
[53:30] you see that boy oh that's the only size
[53:33] no keep looking look at the next one
[53:34] look at the next one I said that whole
[53:36] side of your house needs it whether you
[53:40] hire me or not does it matter
[53:42] now you know there's a need there
[53:47] and like many of us she's tried to
[53:49] resist it
[53:51] like I can't see what's going on with
[53:54] her house
[53:56] well it's not that bad it's not that
[53:58] what told you it's not that bad
[54:01] is that your feelings talking is this
[54:03] your pocketbook you want to deal
[54:05] that's what's talking but the reality is
[54:08] this is once once I show it to you
[54:13] you'll see it and then it's on you now
[54:17] and this is what the word of the Lord
[54:18] does for us
[54:20] as we come into His presence you pick up
[54:22] the scripture the same scripture your
[54:24] whole life it's sitting there you live
[54:27] in that house and you never saw that
[54:30] that line wasn't straight
[54:32] you've been in this house for 30 years
[54:34] you never saw the crack up there you
[54:36] never saw that scene popping but I'm
[54:39] gonna show it to you and once you see it
[54:41] you can act like you don't see it you
[54:43] don't have to call me no more
[54:45] but every time you walk in that room
[54:48] you're gonna know that crack is up there
[54:49] and this is what the Lord does for us in
[54:52] his word
[54:53] we can act like we don't see it we can
[54:55] act like it's not there but he reveals
[54:58] himself to us and it's the greatest
[55:01] thing that the Lord can do for us is
[55:03] when he reveals himself amen
[55:07] how many witnesses I got tonight
[55:09] aren't you so glad somebody told you
[55:12] somebody showed you somebody opened your
[55:15] eyes aren't you so glad you saw you
[55:19] wasn't what you thought you was you
[55:21] thought you was this and that but
[55:23] somebody showed you you needed to be
[55:25] saved you needed the Holy Ghost
[55:29] you needed to get right with God that is
[55:32] a beautiful thing that's a beautiful
[55:35] thing a man or woman can see their error
[55:38] and change their ways
[55:41] and this is where God is now revealing
[55:46] himself to his church and to his people
[55:48] and to remove the ignorance of Satan's
[55:52] devices now
[55:54] Satan is extremely upset when we get a
[55:59] revelation of who he is
[56:02] that disarms him
[56:04] he can't play the okie doke on us
[56:08] he can't play the games the bait and
[56:10] switch
[56:11] try to make it our fault when he's the
[56:13] liar he's the devil he can't play those
[56:16] games when you when once it's opened up
[56:18] on who really is the liar here
[56:21] who's the guilty party here
[56:24] and who was saved and on their way to
[56:26] heaven now once that's opened up to you
[56:29] it'll change your praise
[56:32] it'll change your worship it'll change
[56:34] your service to him
[56:37] so the prophet of God takes this message
[56:39] here
[56:40] and in paragraph 537 he makes this
[56:43] statement here
[56:50] just a few pages I'll get into this
[56:54] so it's as many many messages within a
[56:57] message this one message Christ The
[57:00] Mystery of God revealed
[57:02] so he identifies that the second pool
[57:05] that closed the third pool is at hand
[57:09] now look at what he says here in
[57:11] paragraph 5 35 we'll go up there just
[57:16] for a moment all right
[57:20] and in the last days has come down in
[57:23] like manner Vindicated himself in the
[57:27] same sign same Wonder same Pillar of
[57:30] Fire same gospel
[57:32] same word same manifestations his body
[57:37] will do the works that he promised like
[57:40] in Mark 16 and so forth his body was not
[57:45] held in the grave but was recognized
[57:48] with him in the resurrection
[57:50] do you get it then the body of his
[57:53] believing children will not be held in
[57:56] the grave when he comes but will be
[58:00] recognized with him because he died for
[58:03] the purpose to resurrect his bride the
[58:07] body
[58:09] and does that make you happy
[58:11] oh my
[58:13] he came for that purpose
[58:16] huh
[58:18] because it is his body because it's the
[58:21] word it's so completely yielded from
[58:24] denomination and things to him and he is
[58:26] the word and it's recognized with him
[58:29] because now we have the first fruit of
[58:32] our Resurrection to know that we have
[58:34] passed from Death unto light become
[58:37] prisoners of his God proven to us by his
[58:41] personal headship that he's the same
[58:43] yesterday today and forever by doing the
[58:47] same things through the church that he
[58:50] did then he and me and I in him and you
[58:55] know and so forth that's right his body
[58:57] was not held in the grave recognized
[59:00] with him in the resurrection same as he
[59:03] is now now catch this here listen
[59:07] which means this
[59:11] his word which he is has begin to rise
[59:17] the word that that down through the age
[59:19] of Luther Wesley has begun to raise up
[59:23] to its power there it began to move then
[59:26] moved a little more now it's coming to
[59:29] identification see watch now to the life
[59:32] in the body
[59:34] now to the life in the body is a
[59:37] Vindication of the Rapture is at hand
[59:42] when you see the headship and the body
[59:46] becoming one and the fullness of the
[59:49] measure of his manifestation
[59:51] shows that the body is about ready to be
[59:55] received to the headship when you see
[59:59] the headship and brother so and so come
[1:00:02] in one with the word when you see the
[1:00:04] headship and sister so and so coming one
[1:00:07] with the word when you see the headship
[1:00:10] and the body becoming one with the word
[1:00:15] the fullness of the measure of his
[1:00:17] manifestation shows that the body is
[1:00:19] about ready to be received to the
[1:00:23] headship
[1:00:24] so as we begin to get more In His Image
[1:00:28] more like the word we read more like the
[1:00:32] tapes we listen to shows us that the
[1:00:35] Rapture is at hand it's an
[1:00:37] identification
[1:00:39] we're becoming more and more not like
[1:00:42] the world not like the other churches
[1:00:44] we're becoming more and more like the
[1:00:48] word and that's an identification that
[1:00:50] the headship is coming the Rapture is at
[1:00:55] hand now we believe that amen
[1:00:59] this is where we are
[1:01:02] so the Rapture is at hand
[1:01:05] we can see the identification of the
[1:01:08] body now
[1:01:11] brother Adam goes down in paragraph
[1:01:12] number 541 notice what caused it
[1:01:17] Lucifer is doing now as he did at the
[1:01:20] first time just as the kingdom of the
[1:01:22] Gentiles was brought in with King
[1:01:24] Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile
[1:01:27] Race by a prophet who can interpret
[1:01:28] unknown tongues visions and dreams comes
[1:01:31] down through the Gentiles without
[1:01:33] anything
[1:01:34] uh just medo and Persians and iron and
[1:01:37] so forth and then defeat it goes out the
[1:01:40] same way again the Gentile Kingdom
[1:01:42] notice Luther in the last days is doing
[1:01:47] as he did at the first we read this this
[1:01:49] morning what did Lucifer do the first
[1:01:52] thing that Lucifer done to separate the
[1:01:55] fellowship of God and man he wanted to
[1:01:57] build him a United Kingdom
[1:02:00] greater Splendor and seemingly more
[1:02:04] cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael
[1:02:07] Christ had
[1:02:09] you got it now if you miss it just hold
[1:02:12] up your hand I'll say it again see
[1:02:13] Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in
[1:02:17] heart was to achieve a brighter and
[1:02:20] greater thing in heaven than Christ had
[1:02:23] is that right by seemingly a more
[1:02:26] cultured and More Beautiful more
[1:02:28] Splendor than the kingdom of Christ
[1:02:32] brother Adam continues on in paragraph 5
[1:02:34] 46.
[1:02:36] he says
[1:02:38] and now they got so much Splendor they
[1:02:42] don't know what to do but to unite it
[1:02:44] with the Catholic Church see
[1:02:47] Lucifer again building a bigger Kingdom
[1:02:50] to push out people that don't believe in
[1:02:53] denominations and even take their Church
[1:02:55] buildings make storerooms and the
[1:02:59] pastors of such has no rights at all and
[1:03:01] a man that is a godsend man would never
[1:03:04] stay in the denomination after he after
[1:03:07] hearing this or seeing it if he's got
[1:03:11] enough to go out and look at it
[1:03:13] certainly I don't say that critically
[1:03:15] say that truthfully to see that revealed
[1:03:20] notice in the last day so what are the
[1:03:23] last days
[1:03:24] we are in the last days we we know that
[1:03:28] so the prophet is pointing us like all
[1:03:31] prophets do point us to a time a future
[1:03:35] of what to look forward to he's showing
[1:03:38] us in the last days what's going to take
[1:03:41] place the Apostle Paul did the same
[1:03:43] thing he warned us that in the last days
[1:03:46] this would take place that will take
[1:03:49] place we'll see all these things taking
[1:03:50] place so you pick up your prophetic
[1:03:53] glasses and you begin to see that you're
[1:03:56] living in the last days you can identify
[1:03:58] what is going on here because the
[1:04:02] prophecy of the word revealed it to you
[1:04:06] notice in the last days
[1:04:08] Lucifer is doing the same thing can you
[1:04:11] see it the devil doing the same thing
[1:04:14] building up a hybrid Church
[1:04:16] a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by
[1:04:20] knowledge instead of the word by
[1:04:23] intellectual man instead of a born-again
[1:04:25] man building an intellectual Kingdom
[1:04:28] that will outshine Christ's little bitty
[1:04:31] flock see what it is that did that
[1:04:33] Fallen Angels the Bible said it was
[1:04:36] Fallen Angels who listened to Lucifer
[1:04:39] instead of Christ who they once belonged
[1:04:42] to is that right now listen close Fallen
[1:04:47] Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley
[1:04:52] Catholic Pentecostals who kept out their
[1:04:55] first estate like the Angels did has
[1:04:58] fell into organizations like Lucifer's
[1:05:01] main hold at Nyasia and what have they
[1:05:04] done organize a great economical
[1:05:07] Association of ministers to make an
[1:05:09] image unto the Beast as the Bible said
[1:05:12] and building a Christian economy that'll
[1:05:15] close the door source of this church and
[1:05:19] others like it see Lucifer at work
[1:05:23] so we see Lucifer's work is to close the
[1:05:27] doors of the true church
[1:05:29] that's his job
[1:05:31] it's the last day prophecy it's part of
[1:05:35] the squeeze it's part of knowing how to
[1:05:39] stand it's part of knowing what to look
[1:05:42] for he says when that squeeze comes then
[1:05:44] you'll know watch what I'm about to tell
[1:05:46] you watch the third pull then
[1:05:50] that's a time frame that's a that's a
[1:05:53] that's an event that takes place that's
[1:05:55] the squeeze that squeeze you socially
[1:05:58] they'll squeeze you on your job they'll
[1:06:01] squeeze you in your family function
[1:06:03] they'll squeeze you you can't hardly say
[1:06:05] what you believe without being
[1:06:07] criticized as being unsensitive or not
[1:06:10] complying or being hateful they've got
[1:06:14] all these labels for people who simply
[1:06:16] just believe the Bible
[1:06:18] somebody's got to be right
[1:06:21] somebody's got to be wrong don't you
[1:06:24] want to be right
[1:06:26] but it's been switched haven't it
[1:06:28] the things that are wrong are now called
[1:06:31] right
[1:06:32] and the things that are right are called
[1:06:35] wrong and when you stand up and say what
[1:06:38] is right they take it personal you're
[1:06:41] you're hateful you're you're not you're
[1:06:43] not um you're being um
[1:06:46] um what do they call you're not correct
[1:06:48] you're not politically correct
[1:06:51] you're you're discriminating against
[1:06:55] me I've been discriminated against my
[1:06:58] whole life
[1:07:00] I'm born in a family of 11.
[1:07:03] of course I didn't get my way
[1:07:05] discrimination since I was a little boy
[1:07:08] growing up
[1:07:12] oh I can wear it if I need to
[1:07:15] it's discriminating they just they
[1:07:17] hating on me they hating on me because
[1:07:20] I'm five foot eight
[1:07:23] I'm actually five nine
[1:07:25] they're hating on me whatever you see
[1:07:28] we're getting these little clicks and
[1:07:30] these little reasons why people don't
[1:07:32] like us
[1:07:33] they don't like you because they don't
[1:07:35] like you how about that
[1:07:38] do you really want everybody to like you
[1:07:42] huh
[1:07:43] you can't follow him and everybody like
[1:07:45] you you can't have one of those if
[1:07:48] everybody likes you you can't follow the
[1:07:51] pillar of fire if everybody like if you
[1:07:53] show can't go in the Rapture if
[1:07:56] everybody likes you it ain't about
[1:07:58] everybody liking you
[1:08:00] it ain't about everybody recognizing you
[1:08:04] but it is about you following what God
[1:08:07] called you to be and this hour this age
[1:08:10] this ecumenical move that's rising up we
[1:08:14] can see it you know it looks
[1:08:16] unthreatening in many cases especially
[1:08:18] in the United States we have all rights
[1:08:21] we all have rights
[1:08:23] they say
[1:08:25] and the people that are right don't have
[1:08:27] no rights the people that are wrong have
[1:08:29] more rights than other people have
[1:08:30] rights
[1:08:32] but this is what Lucifer has set this up
[1:08:35] he he he did this in the last days and
[1:08:39] he used fallen angels to do it now
[1:08:42] listen what kind of angels Luther Wesley
[1:08:45] Catholic
[1:08:47] Pentecostals and brother Branham goes on
[1:08:50] to say
[1:08:52] see Lucifer at work
[1:08:54] I'm trying to bring you the three-fold
[1:08:57] Revelation a mystery of God so what was
[1:09:00] that threefold Revelation that God
[1:09:02] wanted to reveal himself to people
[1:09:06] and then God wanted to have the
[1:09:09] preeminence or to have the first place
[1:09:12] in those same people and he calls them
[1:09:16] his bride
[1:09:17] and then he wanted to restore those
[1:09:20] people back to the original Adam man
[1:09:23] what Adam lost in the garden
[1:09:26] huh that's what we're going to now this
[1:09:29] is God's motive and objective for saving
[1:09:32] you
[1:09:33] his motive for saving you was not just
[1:09:36] so he can show you a miracle signs
[1:09:39] wonders Miracles Loaves and Fishes his
[1:09:42] purpose for saving you was not just to
[1:09:44] get you off the streets
[1:09:46] not just so you couldn't go you would
[1:09:49] you know be a decent citizen but his
[1:09:51] purpose for saving you was to restore
[1:09:54] you back to what Adam lost in the garden
[1:09:58] I'll be thankful for that
[1:10:00] think of it
[1:10:02] he's trying to get us God is trying to
[1:10:04] get us to this threefold purpose let me
[1:10:06] move on here just for a moment I got 10
[1:10:08] or 15 more minutes
[1:10:10] and he says this year
[1:10:13] organizations from man of God who went
[1:10:16] forth to establish truths in the earth
[1:10:18] before that truth King go along and uh
[1:10:22] uh proclamate and get onto the real
[1:10:25] revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come
[1:10:28] in and took it over and made a
[1:10:30] denomination out of it that's the reason
[1:10:32] the revelation of the seventh seal
[1:10:34] mystery had to be unfolded now do you
[1:10:38] see it what they left off if Luther
[1:10:40] would have went on
[1:10:42] uh it had been here if Wesley would have
[1:10:45] went on it had been Pentecostal if
[1:10:47] Pentecost would have went what would
[1:10:49] they have done president continues on he
[1:10:52] says this here
[1:10:54] paragraph 560.
[1:10:57] notice what's the denomination trying to
[1:11:00] do
[1:11:01] exalt itself like Lucifer remember we
[1:11:04] talked about Pride this morning
[1:11:06] they so-called they so-called themselves
[1:11:09] the church the bride which they are in
[1:11:12] Revelation 17 as we spoke of the false
[1:11:15] bride above Christ's Little Flock the
[1:11:18] bride Lucifer thinks and exalts himself
[1:11:22] above the humble word of God's truth by
[1:11:28] the knowledge of the Revelation has
[1:11:31] placed himself by Seminary education and
[1:11:35] theology until they have got themselves
[1:11:37] up and if you don't belong in their
[1:11:39] group then you are outwashed like
[1:11:43] Lucifer did in the beginning saying to
[1:11:46] the people just exactly what Lucifer
[1:11:49] said to Eve surely God will receive us
[1:11:53] so you see the denomination wants to
[1:11:55] Lord over God's word in your life
[1:12:00] you just gotta watch that spirit it's so
[1:12:02] slime
[1:12:04] it wants to exalt itself against the
[1:12:07] word of the Lord
[1:12:08] the word for your day the word for your
[1:12:11] hour the enemy will come in and try to
[1:12:15] water down the word for your day and
[1:12:17] Elevate something they got on the
[1:12:19] Internet or some scientific explanation
[1:12:22] or the reason why that ain't gonna
[1:12:24] happen or the reason why that's a
[1:12:25] mistake or the reason this is where the
[1:12:27] Prophet misses this is why you know we
[1:12:29] need an explanation for all these things
[1:12:31] this is Satan's job to elevate his
[1:12:36] explanation over God's word
[1:12:39] and God's word is designed there's some
[1:12:42] places in his word that you cannot
[1:12:45] explain
[1:12:46] there's some times and places in his
[1:12:48] word we have enough Mountaintop evidence
[1:12:51] to know that this event is going to
[1:12:53] happen is going to occur but we don't
[1:12:56] have enough evidence to say exactly how
[1:12:59] it's gonna happen so as a Believer we
[1:13:02] take everything that the word gives us
[1:13:04] the mountaintops of evidence but we
[1:13:07] can't explain exactly all the details
[1:13:10] this is why we have to wait patience
[1:13:13] one of the virtues
[1:13:16] but the enemy wants to come in and make
[1:13:18] you Lord over that word and make
[1:13:20] something or produce something or
[1:13:23] Elevate itself above
[1:13:26] they've even you know let's take for
[1:13:29] example me reading out of this little
[1:13:32] book here this little green book
[1:13:35] that might be offensive to some people
[1:13:37] that followed the message even
[1:13:39] you're reading these quotes your brother
[1:13:40] random said or brother random said or
[1:13:42] the the quotations from the message why
[1:13:45] do we do that well there was a vision
[1:13:47] that came to him to store up what
[1:13:51] huh
[1:13:52] was that was that a vision from the Lord
[1:13:56] do you believe those visions
[1:13:58] and he said the storm fool why why so
[1:14:02] they can put it on the shelf so the
[1:14:03] preachers Don't Preach from it so they
[1:14:05] don't present it to the people start the
[1:14:07] food why why is it on tape it's on tape
[1:14:12] so you can hear it and you can listen to
[1:14:15] it and you can eat it and you become one
[1:14:18] with it
[1:14:20] and as you become one with it you can
[1:14:22] see the Rapture is at hand
[1:14:25] as you become one with the word the
[1:14:27] Rapture is at hand
[1:14:29] now that might need explanation for some
[1:14:31] but some people I don't need to explain
[1:14:33] that to anyone
[1:14:35] it's the truth
[1:14:37] I was just going through those Vision I
[1:14:39] was like my goodness
[1:14:41] record these sermons
[1:14:44] store them up for the time will come
[1:14:46] they'll need them
[1:14:48] the Angel The Voice told the prophet he
[1:14:50] said was a little building it looked
[1:14:52] like the Tabernacle looked like that
[1:14:55] building in Klondike Arizona that little
[1:14:57] ranch building out there
[1:14:59] and he said it looked like that building
[1:15:01] it got closer it was actually the
[1:15:03] Tabernacle and he said store up food
[1:15:07] much food much taste because brother
[1:15:11] Israel needs something to preach on
[1:15:15] and every god-given preacher would need
[1:15:18] something to preach about it talk about
[1:15:22] see I'm not following somebody's
[1:15:24] testimony I'm not following somebody's
[1:15:27] memory of what they thought maybe
[1:15:28] happened but I heard the voice myself
[1:15:31] and
[1:15:36] say what the vicious say
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:41] and there's a blessing that comes with
[1:15:43] it
[1:15:44] I've said a lot of things in my life
[1:15:46] don't make no sense
[1:15:48] but I'm quoting out of this Bible pure
[1:15:51] pure knowledge according out of this
[1:15:53] message pure
[1:15:55] come from God Amen
[1:15:58] say what the tape says save the division
[1:15:59] says so you see that Satan's design
[1:16:04] to break your fellowship
[1:16:07] with the word of the Lord can I take 15
[1:16:09] more minutes
[1:16:11] I ain't been going that long come on now
[1:16:13] help me
[1:16:15] that Satan's design is to break your
[1:16:18] fellowship
[1:16:20] to give you an objection a object of
[1:16:23] purpose in life that's not quite aligned
[1:16:26] with God's purpose for your life
[1:16:29] do you know that God's got a purpose for
[1:16:31] your life
[1:16:32] God needs you God Wants You God's got
[1:16:35] something for you to do and that's an
[1:16:38] individual calling that he makes to the
[1:16:41] individual it's the most precious Union
[1:16:44] it's the most precious relationship is
[1:16:47] that relationship between you and the
[1:16:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:51] it reveals that to you
[1:16:54] He makes himself known to you doesn't he
[1:16:58] Satan's job is to break that Union
[1:17:01] oh mine
[1:17:03] and the prophet continues here and says
[1:17:06] that's what the denomination's done
[1:17:08] they've tried to exalt in paragraph 563
[1:17:12] let me take this here for you
[1:17:14] I had one or two spots I want to get to
[1:17:17] and we'll go to the table of the Lord
[1:17:20] God have mercy
[1:17:22] that men and women will not think I'm
[1:17:24] saying this to exalt something or some
[1:17:26] personal revelation
[1:17:28] I'm only telling you the truth can't you
[1:17:30] see what they're doing
[1:17:33] I speak it loud and harsh but you got to
[1:17:36] drive a nail till it clenches if it's
[1:17:39] going to do any good
[1:17:41] now saying to the people surely you mean
[1:17:44] to tell me that our great Catholic
[1:17:46] Church that stood all this time our
[1:17:48] methodists look at our forefathers but
[1:17:50] they broke the word of the Lord
[1:17:53] and Eve was God was
[1:17:55] one of his she was a byproduct of Adam
[1:17:58] and because she doubted one word of God
[1:18:01] God's word it did it
[1:18:03] and here is Lucifer at his job again
[1:18:08] today
[1:18:10] and remember the answer Christ is not
[1:18:13] communism
[1:18:14] the Antichrist is so close like the real
[1:18:17] thing till it'll just see the very
[1:18:19] elective if it was possible Jesus said
[1:18:22] Matthew 24 the elected if it was
[1:18:25] possible Lucifer again
[1:18:28] Lucifer again is breaking God's Unity
[1:18:32] in Man by his limiting the word of God
[1:18:36] to his reasoning
[1:18:39] don't let nobody limit this word to you
[1:18:42] if you see it in God's word God says
[1:18:45] you're healed run with it Sis
[1:18:47] go run with that brother take it if God
[1:18:50] you see something in God's word and he
[1:18:52] says by your stripes you're healed I
[1:18:54] don't care what the disease is run with
[1:18:57] it
[1:18:58] I prefer to run with that in the room
[1:19:00] with somebody's negative testimony
[1:19:03] because we have evidence that God is the
[1:19:05] Healer amen
[1:19:08] Lucifer again is breaking God's Unity
[1:19:10] limiting the word of God to his
[1:19:13] reasoning what he thinks is right and
[1:19:16] what he thinks he breaks the word of God
[1:19:19] and the same thing he did in the days of
[1:19:22] Jesus and Jesus said to you by your
[1:19:24] tradition has made the word of God of
[1:19:25] none effect and the denominations by the
[1:19:28] organizations intellectual reasons has
[1:19:30] made God's word of no effect upon the
[1:19:34] people that's right they just can't see
[1:19:37] it
[1:19:38] then they say where is the god of the
[1:19:40] Bible he's right here
[1:19:42] he's the Bible
[1:19:45] what he is notice now Lucifer comes in
[1:19:51] the cunningness and breaks the unity of
[1:19:54] God to man just like he did in Eden by
[1:19:57] great Temptations of Promise of
[1:20:00] self-power and exaltations
[1:20:04] or you might become a bishop you if you
[1:20:06] just stay with us you might come a
[1:20:08] district presbyter in the brother
[1:20:10] Branham continues on so look at Satan
[1:20:13] down
[1:20:14] Prophet is stripping them down
[1:20:18] as we call it
[1:20:20] piece by piece I'm covering him it's
[1:20:24] like you're looking at a picture and you
[1:20:27] can't see the snake in the picture
[1:20:30] and then you move this detail you move
[1:20:33] that shadow and then you move that rock
[1:20:35] and you move that tree and he starts
[1:20:37] saying is that a tail
[1:20:40] is that that look like scales what is
[1:20:43] that this is what the word of the Lord
[1:20:45] does it starts moving the darkness and
[1:20:48] you can reveal to you where the enemy is
[1:20:51] in your life not not the enemy and your
[1:20:53] brother's law I'm talking about the
[1:20:54] enemy in your life
[1:20:56] where the problem really is where your
[1:21:00] enemy really is talk about these people
[1:21:03] don't like me this your greatest enemy
[1:21:04] is you you the problem man
[1:21:08] you're the problem sis
[1:21:10] I get too many amens I'm the problem now
[1:21:14] can you say Amen you don't you in the
[1:21:17] mirror you the one that's the problem
[1:21:18] this is the hard head
[1:21:21] this is the stiff neck
[1:21:24] this is the ungrateful one this is the
[1:21:26] one that can't see this is the lazy one
[1:21:28] this is one that can't pray can't give
[1:21:31] God thanks for what he's done for you
[1:21:33] look in the mirror that's the problem
[1:21:37] and let God open that up to you and when
[1:21:41] the problem with you get solved all the
[1:21:45] other problems get solved when you get
[1:21:48] right everybody else gets right when
[1:21:51] your vision is clear
[1:21:53] you know how to place people at the end
[1:21:56] stop trying to make people like you and
[1:21:58] be your friends and understand you you
[1:22:00] the problem
[1:22:02] when you get a relationship with the
[1:22:03] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] those co-workers you'll love them
[1:22:09] you'll love them
[1:22:11] without them you wouldn't have a prayer
[1:22:13] life
[1:22:16] you can't walk around with a smile on
[1:22:18] your face all your life we got some
[1:22:21] Sorrows for you we got to develop a
[1:22:24] prayer life for you so we got to get
[1:22:25] somebody in your life that hates you
[1:22:28] that bothers you that annoys you
[1:22:32] and they might be living with you
[1:22:39] y'all said I can keep going
[1:22:41] closing
[1:22:43] them but when you get you right then all
[1:22:46] the other problems find their place
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:52] so he's uncovering this this being Satan
[1:22:56] is tactics of the last name it was a
[1:22:59] mystery that was healed hid for the
[1:23:01] foundation of the world and now he's
[1:23:03] being revealed to a select few
[1:23:06] and that select few is his bride because
[1:23:08] God's trying to bring them back to what
[1:23:11] Adam was
[1:23:12] paragraph 572 notice Lucifer comes in
[1:23:16] cunning me like he did then and by
[1:23:19] Temptations false promise of power out
[1:23:23] apart from the word of God he did the
[1:23:25] same thing at niac Rome he's doing the
[1:23:28] same thing today at the World Council
[1:23:30] the ELCA miracle churches
[1:23:35] paragraph 578
[1:23:38] brother random continues on with this
[1:23:40] uncovering
[1:23:43] notice we see the Promise being
[1:23:46] fulfilled Christ the true headship
[1:23:48] coming in his bride doing the same works
[1:23:51] that he did at the beginning making
[1:23:53] ready and fulfilling his word as he did
[1:23:56] in first John 14 12.
[1:24:00] he that believeth in me the works that I
[1:24:02] do shall he do also then the head and
[1:24:04] the body are becoming one in works and
[1:24:10] in sign and in life
[1:24:14] can you say that with me and works
[1:24:16] in sign
[1:24:19] and in life
[1:24:22] are you becoming one with the word in
[1:24:24] your life
[1:24:25] in your works
[1:24:28] you see
[1:24:29] me reading the scripture to you exposing
[1:24:32] you and exposing me me reading the quote
[1:24:35] to you exposing you and exposing me does
[1:24:37] not change our behavior until a power of
[1:24:41] the word now comes upon us to make us
[1:24:45] live what we heard
[1:24:48] I can't take this quote and stick it in
[1:24:50] and say grow like the rest of my Buzzard
[1:24:53] feathers Blended in
[1:24:56] you know fluff it out blend it in no no
[1:24:59] no no no no no no it's you got to be
[1:25:02] born again and then these quotes in this
[1:25:05] truth and the scriptures have to be
[1:25:07] birthed in you
[1:25:08] otherwise you're going to be struggling
[1:25:10] to try to make yourself live the message
[1:25:13] or live the rules and the regulations
[1:25:15] but you got to have a life to live that
[1:25:18] so he's trying to bring us in that we
[1:25:22] become one in works
[1:25:24] and in sign and in life
[1:25:28] Vindicated by God himself through his
[1:25:31] promised word for the last days he
[1:25:34] promised us in the last days now if
[1:25:37] you're spiritual you'll catch it
[1:25:40] then we can see that the marriage supper
[1:25:44] is at hand
[1:25:45] so the Rapture is at hand
[1:25:47] the marriage supper is at hand
[1:25:50] now if I never see you again remember
[1:25:52] the marriage supper is at hand and then
[1:25:56] the kingdom according to the promise is
[1:25:58] ready to be issued in the great
[1:26:00] Millennium and taking up of the church
[1:26:03] and destroying the wicked in the world
[1:26:07] under the Sixth Seal to be purified by
[1:26:09] volcanic to take all the corruption and
[1:26:12] sin of the world to mold her out again
[1:26:14] to bring forth a bright New Millennium
[1:26:18] let me go on all right
[1:26:20] that's a beautiful thought that one day
[1:26:22] all of the evil thoughts and evil
[1:26:25] spirits there's a holy fire going to
[1:26:28] purify all of that
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:32] how many's ever thought of evil thought
[1:26:35] oh yes that came from somewhere but in
[1:26:39] that other land it won't be there no
[1:26:40] more
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:44] all right now brother random brings us
[1:26:48] to the head and I'll prepare to close
[1:26:51] all right paragraph 583 notice being
[1:26:55] personally identified by the original
[1:26:57] headship
[1:27:00] we have the answer to the devil's
[1:27:03] questions amen
[1:27:05] Glory we have the answer to the devil's
[1:27:09] question he Christ is risen and has paid
[1:27:14] the price and racism raises up the head
[1:27:17] the body the devil can't stand it
[1:27:22] that's the reason these economical
[1:27:24] kingdoms are setting up that's the
[1:27:27] reason they're all coming into what they
[1:27:28] are doing now the devil that's the
[1:27:31] reason he's howling the way he is his
[1:27:36] wickedness his scheme has been uncovered
[1:27:40] by the Risen resurrected Christ in the
[1:27:44] headship over his body Glory
[1:27:48] now this is a beautiful thing
[1:27:51] that this that the the the wicked one
[1:27:54] Satan the devil has been uncovered his
[1:27:58] scheme has been unmasked
[1:28:01] we can now see what his intentions are
[1:28:04] what his motives are we can see that he
[1:28:07] knows how to quote the scriptures and
[1:28:09] the Bible
[1:28:10] we can see that he can pose himself as a
[1:28:13] minister
[1:28:14] or a religious person we see that he can
[1:28:18] take all of these forms right and he's
[1:28:22] howling mad
[1:28:24] and this is why he's raising up this
[1:28:27] ecumenical counsel this these forces and
[1:28:31] these powers to try to stop the
[1:28:33] preaching from going on to close the
[1:28:35] doors of the church in one form or the
[1:28:38] other
[1:28:39] doesn't want the holy ghost moving in
[1:28:43] the assemblies
[1:28:44] doesn't want a preacher preaching the
[1:28:48] message
[1:28:49] so that Spirit Rises up and it used
[1:28:51] scriptures and quotes to try to say that
[1:28:55] it's wrong now to preach the gospel
[1:28:57] and it's wrong to go and do these things
[1:29:00] that the Bible said we should do
[1:29:02] even to the gifts of the Spirit the
[1:29:05] least of the gifts is speaking in
[1:29:06] tongues could you imagine how many
[1:29:09] message churches were would go
[1:29:11] cross-eyed somebody started speaking in
[1:29:15] tongues in their Message Church
[1:29:19] huh
[1:29:21] it's all through their Bible it's the
[1:29:23] least of the gifts it's on the tapes
[1:29:26] it's on the tapes in the Branham
[1:29:28] Tabernacle he referenced it he
[1:29:31] authenticated it and yet today 2023 you
[1:29:35] let somebody speak in tongues in all of
[1:29:37] the message churches you're gonna have
[1:29:38] some problems
[1:29:39] uh-huh from message people and these
[1:29:44] gifts because it's Satan that's howling
[1:29:47] mad because we have his answer
[1:29:50] and the answer that we have for him is
[1:29:52] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:29:56] today and forever
[1:29:59] and now I have found my purpose in life
[1:30:02] I thought I wanted to be this I thought
[1:30:04] I wanted to play football I thought I
[1:30:06] wanted to be some lawyer or be whatever
[1:30:08] you thought you wanted to be but now I
[1:30:10] found my purpose in life my purpose in
[1:30:13] life was to become one with the word
[1:30:17] and as I get myself in line to be one
[1:30:21] with the words and I know that the
[1:30:23] Rapture is at hand
[1:30:27] isn't that beautiful
[1:30:29] so we know Satan can't take advantage of
[1:30:31] us now
[1:30:34] say you know if you don't believe that
[1:30:35] if you believe this we'll pay you more
[1:30:37] money if you don't preach on that
[1:30:39] you ain't talking to a believer
[1:30:41] believe we don't have time for that
[1:30:45] a believer
[1:30:47] loves other believers but if
[1:30:51] if him by himself he knows
[1:30:54] he knows that's what a True Believer
[1:30:56] does
[1:30:57] a Believer loves other believer loves
[1:30:59] Fellowship I love their brothers I love
[1:31:01] being able to call share a quote
[1:31:05] love all of that but if I had to stand
[1:31:08] alone
[1:31:10] and if I have to cross up and leave a
[1:31:13] break Fellowship a True Believer will do
[1:31:17] that why because the scheme has been
[1:31:18] uncovered our headship is the word and
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:31:27] and forever don't you thank God for that
[1:31:30] are you coming in line with the word
[1:31:34] that's where the Rapture is
[1:31:37] you know brother Brown I'm talking about
[1:31:38] speeding
[1:31:42] oh somebody said clothes hey do you feel
[1:31:45] that tightened up help me felt that got
[1:31:47] that heavy foot
[1:31:49] because the Lord knows I need to be on
[1:31:52] time
[1:31:54] the Lord didn't know that I should have
[1:31:55] woke up earlier
[1:31:59] Pace myself better
[1:32:01] and get on the freeway and no police
[1:32:03] around so I can speed right
[1:32:07] is that how it works
[1:32:09] if I see the police then I'll behave
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:13] that's how we operate yeah all right
[1:32:16] thank you
[1:32:18] but that's not what the words
[1:32:20] those laws are put there
[1:32:23] and it's just as simple as obeying what
[1:32:26] the word of the Lord has told us to do
[1:32:29] and even just those simple things like
[1:32:31] that Prophet talk to us about coming to
[1:32:34] church on time
[1:32:36] praying
[1:32:37] uh preparing for the service talked
[1:32:40] about if there's an ought between one
[1:32:42] another to go make it right now but we
[1:32:45] like to hold it and season it and hold
[1:32:48] it and then wear it
[1:32:50] why be offended I like that feeling of
[1:32:53] being offended because they offended me
[1:32:56] I want to feel that for a minute wait
[1:32:57] wait bro they want to make it right no I
[1:32:59] don't want to make it right yeah I want
[1:33:00] to feel this
[1:33:01] this whole fence how many you know what
[1:33:04] I'm talking about
[1:33:06] yes
[1:33:07] and but you can make that right and the
[1:33:10] prophet tells us that we shouldn't go we
[1:33:12] shouldn't uh let the sun go down upon
[1:33:14] our Wrath
[1:33:16] we shouldn't hold grudges with one
[1:33:18] another
[1:33:19] we should make those things right say
[1:33:21] brother Israel open up one of them seals
[1:33:23] break open the seal this might be one of
[1:33:26] the seals that needs to break on you
[1:33:27] that you know stop being so hateful and
[1:33:31] mean and love and forgive and learn how
[1:33:35] to be you know uh uh more like more like
[1:33:39] Christ in just these simple matters and
[1:33:42] we step over the top of those in just as
[1:33:44] simple as that as we start to recognize
[1:33:47] that we're getting ourselves in line
[1:33:49] with the word and as we get in line with
[1:33:51] the word
[1:33:52] we're actually getting in line with the
[1:33:55] Rapture can you think of it like that
[1:33:57] as you line up with the word you're
[1:33:59] lining up with the rapture

[1:41:15] First Corinthians 11 oh my
[1:41:18] will turn there in our Bibles
[1:41:25] we'll stand for the reading of God's
[1:41:27] word
[1:41:34] a bit of announcement let's keep in mind
[1:41:36] the in prayer the meetings coming in
[1:41:38] November that's our yearly meetings
[1:41:40] really praying for an outpouring of the
[1:41:44] Holy Spirit
[1:41:46] something to draw us closer to the
[1:41:48] headstone
[1:41:50] also the men's meeting that's coming up
[1:41:53] for the the prayer breakfast just for
[1:41:57] demand and just keep that in prayer as
[1:41:59] well
[1:42:01] and to pray one for the other
[1:42:04] First Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have
[1:42:07] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:42:10] delivered unto you
[1:42:11] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:42:13] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:42:16] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:42:19] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:42:22] broken for you
[1:42:24] this doing a remembrance of me
[1:42:26] after the same manner also he took the
[1:42:28] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:42:31] is the New Testament in my blood
[1:42:35] this two years off as you drink it in
[1:42:37] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:42:40] eat this bread and drink this cup if you
[1:42:42] do show the Lord's death till he come
[1:42:44] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:42:47] and drink this cup
[1:42:51] pardon me
[1:42:52] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:42:54] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:42:56] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:42:58] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:43:00] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:43:03] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:43:05] examine himself
[1:43:07] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:43:09] of that cup or he that eateth and
[1:43:11] drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a
[1:43:14] damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:43:16] Lord's body
[1:43:18] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:43:20] among you and many sleep
[1:43:23] as many are dead that's what that means
[1:43:26] or they die prematurely brother random
[1:43:28] says
[1:43:29] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:31] should not be judged but when we are
[1:43:34] judged we are chasing of the Lord that
[1:43:37] we should not be condemned with the
[1:43:40] world how many want to be chastened of
[1:43:42] the Lord
[1:43:43] so that you won't be condemned
[1:43:47] because the world is going to be
[1:43:48] condemned I'd rather be chasing right
[1:43:51] now than to be condemned with the world
[1:43:53] wherefore my brethren come together to
[1:43:56] eat Terry one for another
[1:43:58] If any man hunger let him eat at home
[1:44:00] you come not together unto condemnation
[1:44:02] the rest of Allah said in order when I
[1:44:05] come I was reading some of these
[1:44:08] scriptures and quotes on communion
[1:44:10] to the Saints in Phoenix on Wednesday
[1:44:12] night
[1:44:13] with brother Roland McGraw's church that
[1:44:16] why that's why I wasn't here on
[1:44:17] Wednesday just to help them out and the
[1:44:20] little group there

[1:44:25] filling in for the service and brother

[1:44:39] have the full confidence that they gonna
[1:44:42] handle it the way you would and I
[1:44:44] certainly appreciate that brother George
[1:44:46] thank you God bless you brother Joel
[1:44:49] appreciate you very much
[1:44:51] and um
[1:44:52] we was reading some of these quotes and
[1:44:55] one of the quotes that I read that
[1:44:58] whether Brandon says that when you eat
[1:45:00] the bread it shows to the church that
[1:45:02] you believe every word
[1:45:05] and then there was another one that says
[1:45:08] Lord Brothers praying to the Lord let
[1:45:11] everyone who partakes of this
[1:45:13] May
[1:45:15] um
[1:45:15] the the
[1:45:17] um weariness from their body departs May
[1:45:21] the weakness depart may they receive
[1:45:24] physical and spiritual strength in
[1:45:28] partaking of a simple little a simple
[1:45:31] little service like this Bread and Wine
[1:45:34] Jesus said to do it is beautiful it
[1:45:36] really is
[1:45:37] and we don't take it for granted we
[1:45:39] thank God that we have a revelation to
[1:45:41] do it we do it at night time because
[1:45:43] that's when it was instituted at night
[1:45:47] the uh
[1:45:49] Jesus had the last supper with his
[1:45:52] disciples it was the type of Israel
[1:45:55] coming out of Egypt it was an ordinance
[1:45:58] that they were partake and the Death
[1:46:01] Angel was to pass through the land and
[1:46:05] um after partaking of that last supper
[1:46:08] in Israel that ordinance they went 40
[1:46:10] years their clothes didn't wear out the
[1:46:13] Bible says there wasn't one feeble one
[1:46:16] amongst them look up that word feeble
[1:46:18] let's see what it means there wasn't one
[1:46:21] feeble one among them
[1:46:22] and they walked through that journey and
[1:46:25] they got and God blessed them and helped
[1:46:27] them and he brought them through and
[1:46:30] that great
[1:46:31] um that great
[1:46:32] uh uh last supper with our lord Jesus it
[1:46:36] kind of leads like looks like he just
[1:46:37] did that but then Paul picks it up and
[1:46:41] he said I received of the Lord
[1:46:44] and then he sets it in order and then he
[1:46:47] brings in
[1:46:48] if you partake of it unworthily you'll
[1:46:52] be guilty of the body so he brings the
[1:46:54] seriousness of partaking he brings the
[1:46:57] correction how some were coming and
[1:46:59] eating and it was a casual affair he
[1:47:02] said this is not coming together to eat
[1:47:04] food this is to remember the Lord's
[1:47:07] Supper Terry won for another and do this
[1:47:11] in remembrance of me so that you won't
[1:47:13] be condemned with the world and when you
[1:47:16] come to Take and Eat of this bread and
[1:47:17] drink others he says examine yourself
[1:47:21] so when we pray for one another we
[1:47:23] examine ourselves we pray for one
[1:47:26] another I'll pray for you pray for me
[1:47:29] you pray for the one behind you next to
[1:47:31] you and in front of you

[1:50:04] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:50:07] put into the heart of Judas Iscariot
[1:50:09] Simon's son to betray him
[1:50:12] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:50:15] all things into his hands that he was
[1:50:17] come from God and went to God he riseth
[1:50:20] from supper laid aside his garments and
[1:50:24] took a towel and girded himself
[1:50:26] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:50:28] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:50:31] to wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:50:34] was girded in committee to Simon Peter
[1:50:38] and said unto him Lord
[1:50:40] Peter said unto him Lord the thou
[1:50:44] does thou wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:50:47] and said
[1:50:48] what I do thou knowest not now but thou
[1:50:51] shall know Hereafter Peter said unto him
[1:50:54] thou shall never wash my feet Jesus
[1:50:57] answered him if I wash thee not
[1:51:00] thou has no part with me
[1:51:03] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:51:05] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:51:09] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[1:51:12] needed not to save wash his feet but
[1:51:15] it's clean every wit and you're clean
[1:51:17] but not all for he knew who should
[1:51:20] betray him therefore said he ye are not
[1:51:24] all clean
[1:51:25] so after he had washed their feet and
[1:51:28] had taken His Garment it was set down
[1:51:30] again he said unto them know ye what I
[1:51:33] have done to you
[1:51:35] you call me master and Lord and you say
[1:51:38] well for so I am
[1:51:40] if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:51:43] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:51:46] one another's feet isn't that amazing
[1:51:49] how the Lord humbled himself
[1:51:51] to wash
[1:51:52] another man's feet
[1:51:56] for I've given you an example that you
[1:51:59] should do as I have done to you
[1:52:02] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:52:04] is not greater than his Lord neither is
[1:52:07] he that is sent greater than he that
[1:52:09] sent him if you know these things
[1:52:11] happier ye if you do them
[1:52:14] and man it's hard to have pride in your
[1:52:17] life and heart while you're washing
[1:52:19] another man's feet
[1:52:21] and that's part of Jesus said to do it
[1:52:24] he did it and he left an example for us
[1:52:27] to do amen so the sisters will go out
[1:52:30] we'll sing a song before he goes before
[1:52:33] we go out
