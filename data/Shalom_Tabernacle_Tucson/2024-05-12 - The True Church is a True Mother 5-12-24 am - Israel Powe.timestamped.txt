[2:50] believe
[2:51] only
[2:53] [Music]
[2:55] believe
[2:56] only be
[3:01] all things are
[3:04] [Music]
[3:05] possible
[3:09] only you may be seated brother
[3:13] brandham
[3:16] I love the reading of his blessed word
[3:21] so now we shall turn this morning in the
[3:25] book of First
[3:27] Corinthians and read for
[3:30] a portion of the 15th
[3:38] chapter beginning with the first
[3:41] verse moreover Brethren I declare unto
[3:45] you the gospel which I preached unto
[3:48] you which also you have received and
[3:52] wherein you
[3:56] stand by which also you are
[4:01] saved if you keep in memory that I
[4:05] preached unto you unless you have
[4:08] believed in
[4:11] vain for I
[4:13] delivered unto you first of all that
[4:17] which I also
[4:20] receive how that Christ died for our
[4:23] sins according to the
[4:27] scriptures and that he was
[4:30] buried and that he rose again the third
[4:33] day according to the
[4:39] scriptures you might say brother Brandon
[4:43] that's rather an unusual text for a
[4:46] Mother's Day
[4:49] message well that's
[4:52] true but you know God's
[4:56] unusual and he does things in a unusual
[5:04] way and I think the thoughts of
[5:09] mother and I have one this morning by
[5:13] the grace of God still here on Earth
[5:17] with
[5:18] us and I'm grateful for
[5:22] mother but being that we were to have
[5:25] also a healing service and not knowing
[5:28] that I would
[5:30] be back again tonight but I thought
[5:32] maybe that we could paint a different
[5:36] type of a
[5:39] picture mother is so great you know the
[5:43] first one that receives you is this life
[5:47] is your
[5:49] mother no one can touch you because
[5:53] you're
[5:55] conceived and she Bears you under her
[5:58] heart
[6:01] and she is the
[6:02] first to know you and the first to in
[6:07] this life to to hold
[6:11] you then when you're born she is a one
[6:15] of the first hands that touch you and
[6:18] wipes back the tears out of your
[6:22] eyes she's the first one to patch you
[6:26] and to love you and to cool over you in
[6:31] this life is your
[6:33] mother now I think that there is not
[6:37] enough honor that we could give to a
[6:42] mother mother
[6:44] is first with the child and she's a
[6:48] great
[6:50] responsibility of what that child will
[6:52] be will be based upon the way that
[6:55] mother starts that
[6:57] child on the path that it must
[7:01] travel mother has the responsibility
[7:05] from God to place that child on the
[7:09] right
[7:12] Road I think that's why mothers has a
[7:15] special little
[7:18] touch I know of a boy in this city I
[7:22] think his mother's present
[7:25] now he's almost my age
[7:29] but I don't say this to hurt the
[7:33] mother because that she has enough hurts
[7:37] is all
[7:38] mother but the boy drinks and he drinks
[7:44] heavy and when he gets real
[7:47] drunk he'll come home and jump in the
[7:51] bed with his mother and put his arms
[7:53] around her and he's got grandchildren
[7:59] but there's something about just the pth
[8:02] of a
[8:04] mother that seems to take a a different
[8:09] place than anything else can
[8:13] touch that is in this life humanly
[8:19] speaking you know a
[8:22] man like
[8:25] Moses he if I could credit anything to
[8:29] his
[8:30] character it was because he had a
[8:34] God sent
[8:38] mother you know it was she that had
[8:42] prayed
[8:44] Joseph and it long for this baby and
[8:51] when he was
[8:52] born she was the one who CED him and
[8:56] cuddled him and built the ark and placed
[8:59] him in the bull rushes when her poor
[9:04] heartbreaking her only little baby in it
[9:08] was the the most outstanding little
[9:12] chump that was in all the
[9:16] world and how mother likes any baby but
[9:20] to see this special little
[9:23] fella and then in her heart she knew
[9:27] that he was born for a
[9:31] purpose and then to take him and place
[9:34] him into the very D of
[9:38] crocodiles out into the
[9:43] river by faith she did that knowing that
[9:47] God was able to take care of
[9:50] him
[9:51] and summize the love of a mother and the
[9:57] action of the car of her
[10:01] faith for Faith does not Place itself
[10:06] upon the shifting Sands of what he can
[10:09] see Faith rests solemnly up on the
[10:13] unmovable Rock of God's Eternal word
[10:17] amen for by faith says the
[10:21] scripture she did
[10:24] this and faith can take its stand
[10:29] on the rock that the waves are beating
[10:34] the foundations out and look straight
[10:38] into the face of death and know that
[10:41] it'll be just in a little bit but faith
[10:44] can look across the sea to him that said
[10:47] I am the resurrection and life amen fail
[10:51] to even hear the waves of
[10:55] Dashing that's the kind of fith that
[10:58] Moses mother had
[11:01] she taught him and she reared him in the
[11:05] Palace of
[11:08] pharaoh teaching him that he was born
[11:11] for a purpose that Jehovah had answered
[11:15] her prayer and she he could not have had
[11:19] a better
[11:20] teacher that's what helped Mo the
[11:23] character that Moses
[11:27] was I believe it was Abraham Lincoln who
[11:31] once made a statement like
[11:34] this now I'm neither democrat or
[11:38] republican I just I'm a
[11:42] Christian or I think one side could not
[11:45] say anything against the other side it's
[11:48] all
[11:50] corruption but Abraham linking to
[11:54] my thoughts was one of the it was one I
[11:59] the greatest presidents that this United
[12:02] States ever had including Washington and
[12:07] so
[12:08] forth for Abraham Lincoln had a a bad
[12:13] start he was
[12:15] poor he had no
[12:19] background as far as education or or
[12:23] some great something or money or
[12:26] something that could have helped him
[12:28] like Washington did Washington was a
[12:32] college graduate and he he know he was a
[12:37] smart
[12:38] man a great man to begin
[12:41] with but Lincoln was raised in a little
[12:44] long
[12:46] cabin under the
[12:50] great grounds of
[12:53] Kentucky and with no Flory in the little
[12:56] old cabin which sets us a memorial here
[12:59] Louisville
[13:01] now but being the great man that he was
[13:05] and had to learn to write up on the
[13:08] ground that he plowed to plant the
[13:11] corn but I might pass this on to the
[13:15] young
[13:16] people do you know Abraham Lincoln never
[13:20] owned a book in his
[13:24] life until he was after 21 years old but
[13:28] the Bible and the fox book of the
[13:31] martyrs see what you read molds a
[13:35] character that you
[13:37] are no wonder we got a bunch of
[13:40] neurotics today little old fiction
[13:44] magazines and bulgar and nonsense is
[13:47] placed up on our news
[13:50] stands he on the Bible and the fox book
[13:54] of the martyrs look what it
[13:57] made but in the face of all that one day
[14:02] he made a statement like
[14:05] this he said if there could be any good
[14:09] thing found in me it's because of a
[14:13] Godly
[14:16] mother that rear him to serve the
[14:22] Lord you see a child listens to its
[14:27] mother some little touch about that
[14:31] mother that a child will listen to when
[14:35] it's hurt it'll go to the mother for
[14:38] consolation before it'll go to the
[14:42] father because she was first with it you
[14:46] know and there's some gift that God
[14:49] gives a mother to be that way I mean a
[14:52] real
[14:55] mother I believe that mothers are
[14:57] honorable and godly
[14:59] but I believe such as mother days like
[15:01] this is a racket make a lot of money out
[15:04] of flowers things but Mother's Day
[15:07] should be every day not to send her a
[15:11] bunch of flowers on Mother's day but the
[15:14] love her and care for
[15:17] 365 days and
[15:19] nights through the
[15:23] year but of course the commercial world
[15:26] has a great hold in things like this and
[15:29] it it it depreciates
[15:32] mother oh well nice Mother's Day I sent
[15:34] her a bunch of flowers she appreciate a
[15:37] whole lot more just sit down talk to her
[15:39] just a little bit write her
[15:41] line Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on
[15:44] the cheek tell her you love her it'll go
[15:47] a lot farther than all the flowers that
[15:49] you could buy from the
[15:52] floors that's
[15:56] true I believe it was in The Ten
[15:59] Commandments the late Cecil de that
[16:03] wrote and put on the screen one of the
[16:06] masterpieces of the movie
[16:11] world and before it was put on the scene
[16:14] or let out Cecil de Mills called Old
[16:19] Roberts and Deus car a bunch of the Full
[16:22] Gospel ministers and tuck them into his
[16:24] own
[16:27] Studios and showed the four
[16:30] hours of the Ten Commandments and asked
[16:33] them their opinion of
[16:36] it God Rest his Gallant
[16:41] soul I when I seen the was looking at
[16:45] it and old remark always stuck to
[16:51] me if many of you did see it it was
[16:55] when the daughter of pharaoh after Moses
[17:00] had found out that he was a
[17:04] Hebrew and he had decided to go dwell
[17:08] with his
[17:11] people and there set his once beautiful
[17:17] mother faded out with her gray hair and
[17:20] her wrinkled
[17:23] face sitting in an old armed chair
[17:26] typical mother
[17:30] and the pharaoh's daughter came
[17:34] in and he said who son I'm I
[17:39] anyhow and when it was brought to light
[17:42] that Josie Bell was his real
[17:46] mother the daughter of pharaoh with her
[17:50] paint and so forth and all fixed up she
[17:53] said but
[17:56] look he may be your
[18:00] son but she said I give him wealth and
[18:04] Splendor you could have give him nothing
[18:07] but the Slime
[18:10] pits but the Aged grey-headed mother
[18:13] said but I give him
[18:18] life that makes the
[18:21] difference I gave him life
[18:28] God gave him eternal
[18:32] life how true
[18:36] mother sometimes people say to
[18:39] me mostly always in my campaigns I'm
[18:43] constantly preaching up on the
[18:48] resurrection and I read a text this
[18:50] morning of 15th chapter the fourth verse
[18:54] of First Corinthians on the resurrection
[19:00] but you see the way they Place mother
[19:02] today is a pot of flow setting by an old
[19:06] lady who's old and can't get up maybe
[19:09] and feeble and grayheadedgamer
[19:30] someone said you preached too much on
[19:32] the
[19:33] resurrection most every message has got
[19:36] something about the
[19:38] resurrection why
[19:40] sure it's the it's the Cardinal resting
[19:46] place of the
[19:49] Gospel no matter what he did if he did
[19:52] not rise again from the dead then all of
[19:56] it was in vain
[19:59] it to me proves that he was
[20:02] God proves every clean he
[20:06] made the
[20:11] resurrection and it also is the place of
[20:14] the resting of the
[20:16] Soul it's the starting
[20:20] part it's the crowning of our
[20:27] consolation and when
[20:30] we see that he rose from the
[20:35] dead it places us with the gospel armor
[20:40] at the
[20:42] Battlefront to take the place to
[20:45] fight for we know he said he that will
[20:50] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[20:56] again I think it's the great
[21:00] Carnation of the Full Gospel is the
[21:05] resurrection and his Divine
[21:09] promises and the consolation that it
[21:12] gives those who are trusting in
[21:16] it or it promises the great Union of our
[21:22] uniting together
[21:25] again it promises the the fading away of
[21:29] all
[21:31] sin it promises the fading away of all
[21:35] deformities all the sufferings that we
[21:38] have did in this had to go through
[21:40] within this life it promises and the
[21:43] banishing of it
[21:46] all it promises that even death will
[21:49] lose its hope and we'll rise in the
[21:51] likeness of
[21:54] Jesus so in my opinion the resurrection
[21:58] is the greatest of all the promises and
[22:02] the things of the
[22:04] scripture there's where it seal
[22:07] it the last Easter when I was preaching
[22:10] on the five things of living he loved me
[22:14] dying he saved me buried he carried my
[22:17] sins far away but Rising he
[22:22] justified freely
[22:25] forever that's the day for me that great
[22:29] day of days to see what it'll mean to
[22:33] all of us in the resurrection as we
[22:36] labor and wait for that blessed day of
[22:42] days it gives us the
[22:45] promise that someday that these old
[22:49] weakening people graded broke down
[22:57] mothers well be
[23:01] changed not only will mother sit there
[23:04] by herself but all of her family with
[23:10] her and what a day that will
[23:13] be what a time it will
[23:16] be when we look upon the faces of those
[23:20] who we have loved so
[23:26] well what a difference on that
[23:30] morning when we shall see our loved ones
[23:33] and and watch what they'll be then all
[23:36] the afflictions will be taken
[23:40] away all the Mars of suffering will be
[23:44] done no more pale cheeks of
[23:49] death No more tears from the
[23:54] eyes the resurrection promises all of
[23:57] this
[24:00] there'll be no more
[24:02] funerals no more patting the baby on the
[24:05] cheek that's like a piece of
[24:08] stone where the Undertaker hasn't bombed
[24:11] and pushed out and put paint on and so
[24:14] forth to look natural it'll never be
[24:17] needed again
[24:19] [Music]
[24:24] there then I think of when we see them
[24:28] standing
[24:30] Yonder our loved ones our
[24:33] mothers our kindreds our our
[24:37] friends and to see them in their
[24:40] Immortal bodies their celestial
[24:43] bodies watching their
[24:47] character seeing how they conduct
[24:49] themselves with that sweetness and
[24:52] quietness no more nervousness or
[24:55] frustrations
[24:58] the see him in standing in the likeness
[25:01] of the Lord
[25:04] Jesus that'll be a wonderful
[25:08] day each one of us in our minds are
[25:11] anticipating and longing for that hour
[25:14] of consolation when we meet
[25:17] them each one is thinking of their loved
[25:20] one maybe their mother that's gone
[25:23] on what a day it will be when you see
[25:26] her again
[25:30] and to Dad and to brother and to the all
[25:33] the loved ones what a day it will be

[1:06:27] Lord Praise oh ye his servants of the
[1:06:31] Lord praise the name of the
[1:06:39] Lord from the rising of the sun unto the

[1:07:10] dunk
[1:07:16] Hill amen he maketh the barren woman to
[1:07:20] keep house and to be a joyful mother of
[1:07:24] children PR praise ye the Lord
[1:07:28] amen I'd like to take a scripture in St
[1:07:31] John chapter
[1:07:33] 16 strangely enough I had this scripture
[1:07:36] last week Sunday when I spoke on
[1:07:41] offenses and I didn't get to this
[1:07:44] scripture and I refrained from reading
[1:07:48] all of a quote on purpose because I just
[1:07:50] didn't I didn't take the time to read it
[1:07:53] and I'm going to do that this morning
[1:07:56] but in St John chapter 16 verse number
[1:08:03] one Jesus speaking to his disciples
[1:08:06] preparing them for what's to come said
[1:08:10] these things have I spoken unto you that
[1:08:12] ye should not be offended they shall put
[1:08:16] you out of synagogues yeah the time
[1:08:19] cometh that whosoever kth you will think
[1:08:22] that he doeth God a service
[1:08:26] and let's drop down to
[1:08:28] verse
[1:08:33] number 19 so Jesus goes into this
[1:08:37] dialogue he's talking to them about how
[1:08:39] he's going to be taken away and he's
[1:08:41] preparing them not to be offended could
[1:08:44] this this will happen and as they spoke
[1:08:47] among themselves in verse 19 and Jesus
[1:08:49] knew that they were desirous to ask him
[1:08:52] and said unto them do you inquire among
[1:08:56] yourselves of that I said a little while
[1:08:59] ye shall not see me and again a little
[1:09:01] while and ye shall see me verily verily
[1:09:04] I say unto you that ye shall weep and
[1:09:07] lament but the world shall rejoice ye
[1:09:10] shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall
[1:09:13] be turned into Joy a woman when she is
[1:09:16] in travail hath sorrow because her hour
[1:09:20] is come but as soon as she is delivered
[1:09:23] of the child she rememberthe anguish for
[1:09:27] joy that a man is Born Into the world
[1:09:31] Amen we'll take one final scripture in
[1:09:35] Galatians chapter 4
[1:09:59] Galatians Chapter
[1:10:05] 4 verses
[1:10:12] 26 but Jerusalem which is above is free
[1:10:16] which is the mother of us all for it is
[1:10:19] re is written Rejoice thou baren that
[1:10:22] bearest not break forth and cry that
[1:10:26] that trth not for the desolate hath many
[1:10:29] more children than she which hath a
[1:10:31] husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are
[1:10:35] the children of promise but as then he
[1:10:39] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[1:10:42] him that was born after the spirit even
[1:10:45] so it is now nevertheless what sayith
[1:10:48] the scripture cast out the Bond woman
[1:10:50] and her son the son of the Bond woman
[1:10:52] shall not be Heir with the son of the
[1:10:54] free woman so then brethren we are not
[1:10:58] children of the Bond woman but of the
[1:11:00] free how many thank God for that we're
[1:11:04] not children of bondage we're children
[1:11:06] of Freedom title of the message this
[1:11:09] morning is the the true church is a true
[1:11:13] mother the true church is a true mother
[1:11:18] may God add a blessing to his word you
[1:11:20] may be seated um last week we spoke on a
[1:11:24] fence and being
[1:11:26] offended and that scripture in St John
[1:11:31] that we just read chapter
[1:11:33] 16
[1:11:35] um was a scripture that I was going to
[1:11:39] read for you
[1:11:42] all and share that the Lord through his
[1:11:46] word prepares you so you don't walk
[1:11:48] around being offended all the time
[1:11:51] there's actually a quote I couldn't find
[1:11:53] it but it's in there he says brother
[1:11:55] bandam talks about people um um
[1:12:00] offending and being
[1:12:02] offended and that's the predicament
[1:12:05] brother ding wall sent me an email and
[1:12:08] reminded me of that and I was so well
[1:12:10] remember the quote I didn't pull it up
[1:12:13] but you know we talked about how
[1:12:14] offenses will come and people who are
[1:12:17] offended and hear Jesus is now speaking
[1:12:21] of this great offense
[1:12:25] and how he says I'm telling you this so
[1:12:28] you can prepare yourself so you're so
[1:12:30] you're not offended and I think and I
[1:12:33] believe my brothers and sisters that if
[1:12:36] I can grow spiritual enough be uh more
[1:12:41] mature Christian enough to where I
[1:12:45] wouldn't be so easily offended by people
[1:12:49] God bless you Sister Green good to see
[1:12:51] you praise the Lord You Look So Young
[1:12:53] next year's daughter there my my God
[1:12:56] bless you richly but you know this you
[1:13:00] know you if you can be mature enough to
[1:13:04] not be offended by every little thing
[1:13:07] even people do stuff on purpose even you
[1:13:10] might misread something but really you
[1:13:12] want to get to the place where none of
[1:13:15] those things move you because what
[1:13:17] happens when you are offended it throws
[1:13:20] you off of course of what you're
[1:13:22] supposed to be doing every one of us us
[1:13:25] should be zeroed in and focused on
[1:13:27] something but the enemy comes to throw
[1:13:30] us off of focus so he lets someone say
[1:13:33] something or treat us a certain way and
[1:13:36] it hurts us and it offends us but
[1:13:39] blessed are are you if you're not
[1:13:42] offended number one with the word but
[1:13:44] it's so nice when you can live a life
[1:13:47] above the offenses that will come we
[1:13:50] know they're going to come Jesus say so
[1:13:52] the Bible says so when they happen it
[1:13:55] doesn't make them hurt any less it
[1:13:59] doesn't minimize that they that they did
[1:14:01] happen yes it happened it was offensive
[1:14:04] but as a Believer as a Christian I
[1:14:07] cannot control other grown folks I can't
[1:14:11] control outside people what they're
[1:14:14] doing I don't control the rain or the
[1:14:16] weather whether it's windy I do not
[1:14:19] control whether I have a good hair day
[1:14:21] or not that's not in my control I woke
[1:14:24] up on a wrong side of the bed I don't
[1:14:26] feel like I'm just grumbling grumbling I
[1:14:28] can't control a lot of that but what I
[1:14:30] can't control I don't want to walk
[1:14:32] around where I'm just ready to be
[1:14:34] touched off just just somebody just
[1:14:37] touch him off touch her off watch like
[1:14:41] they the enemy's like watch this watch
[1:14:43] this watch me get
[1:14:44] them and we're like the little mionet or
[1:14:47] the little puppet and the devil playing
[1:14:49] strings against us we don't want to live
[1:14:52] that way we live above that amen it's
[1:14:55] not easy we're striving for it God help
[1:14:59] us amen but this is the quote I was I
[1:15:02] read part of it I didn't read all of it
[1:15:03] and it kind of goes with what happened
[1:15:05] down in nog Gala so I'll read it for the
[1:15:07] sake of those of you that were there
[1:15:10] because I think it goes real good
[1:15:11] paragraph 151 in the message questions
[1:15:14] and answer answers when you ministers
[1:15:17] are correcting someone about a gift when
[1:15:20] you're correcting them scripturally
[1:15:22] correcting them and they get offend
[1:15:25] remember it wasn't the spirit of God cuz
[1:15:29] the spirit of God cannot be offended by
[1:15:33] his
[1:15:34] word he comes to his word see he's
[1:15:38] always willing a real saint of God wants
[1:15:42] to tow the mark yes sir I want to be
[1:15:45] corrected I want the Holy Spirit to
[1:15:48] correct me and things that I'm doing
[1:15:50] that's wrong I don't want nothing
[1:15:53] substitutionary I want the real thing or
[1:15:56] nothing just let me alone don't let me
[1:15:59] have anything at all see because I'd
[1:16:02] rather do that then to bring a reproach
[1:16:05] on the Christ and I wouldn't teach
[1:16:08] anything and I wouldn't say anything
[1:16:11] bless the scripture dot dot dot and if
[1:16:14] some brother some Christian brother
[1:16:15] would see me teaching something
[1:16:18] wrong I'd appreciate it if you call me
[1:16:21] over to one side after the Serv service
[1:16:25] and say brother brandom I like to come
[1:16:28] to your room and talk to you you're an
[1:16:31] era upon something see I sure appreciate
[1:16:35] that brother because I want to be right
[1:16:38] I want it now all of us want to be right
[1:16:41] that's why we want we want to speak
[1:16:44] these things they got to come through
[1:16:46] the scripture you see to make the
[1:16:48] scripture tie together that's very
[1:16:50] helpful to me very beautiful uh to lay
[1:16:54] that in there so things happen there's a
[1:16:57] way to to deal with them so we don't
[1:17:00] want to be offended people that have the
[1:17:02] word in their life it's offense
[1:17:06] proof you know these naked women and
[1:17:10] people these vulgar signs and you know
[1:17:12] they they put stuff on bumper stickers
[1:17:15] is all crazy talking about this group
[1:17:17] and that group and they might even they
[1:17:20] they might talk about your class that
[1:17:22] you're rolling with all right and I
[1:17:24] might be on the bumper sticker but when
[1:17:26] you see that bumper sticker just say
[1:17:28] they ain't talking about
[1:17:29] me they're talking about somebody else
[1:17:32] don't get offended don't take it like
[1:17:35] that all people that live on the east
[1:17:38] are like this or everybody in this
[1:17:39] neighborhood are like that all the
[1:17:41] Democrats all the Republicans they ain't
[1:17:43] talking about me so I want to stay with
[1:17:47] the word and live above those approaches
[1:17:49] above those offenses the true church is
[1:17:53] a true mother
[1:17:55] you know this definition of a mother as
[1:17:58] I had looked it up and this time last
[1:18:01] year I spoke I think on Mother's Day I I
[1:18:04] normally bring out five mothers I think
[1:18:07] I added two more out of the message and
[1:18:10] I might have a chance to get to those
[1:18:12] mothers but that word mother means gave
[1:18:15] birth to an older definition is gave
[1:18:19] birth
[1:18:20] to female parent that's another older
[1:18:24] definition
[1:18:25] origin apparent so this uh is someone
[1:18:30] that gives birth to someone else a
[1:18:35] mother all of us here had one or we
[1:18:39] might currently have one and this
[1:18:42] position of mother I love the way
[1:18:44] brother random highlighted that in that
[1:18:47] Mother's Day message in Sunday school
[1:18:49] this morning how she's the first one
[1:18:52] that gets you and God gives her a
[1:18:55] special little
[1:18:57] touch and it was it was through this
[1:19:00] channel I I had spoken I believe last
[1:19:03] year maybe earlier this year on the
[1:19:06] position of a widow what a widow is or a
[1:19:08] widower and any married person can
[1:19:12] potentially become a widow or a widower
[1:19:16] like today like right now we don't think
[1:19:19] of it that way but that's the reality of
[1:19:21] it becoming a widow is something that
[1:19:24] happens to you you don't seek that out
[1:19:27] you don't you know try to achieve that
[1:19:29] that somebody dies out of that
[1:19:32] relationship man or woman and God uses
[1:19:37] this office of a widow when he wanted to
[1:19:40] manifest a third pool to the human
[1:19:44] beings he saw it in the animals we saw
[1:19:47] it in nature we saw it in the creation
[1:19:49] but now to the human beings he uses a
[1:19:53] widow sister Hatty right
[1:19:55] and not only a widow but she was a
[1:19:58] mother and she requested something that
[1:20:01] only a mother would request it really
[1:20:04] highlights it but this this pain shall
[1:20:09] be turned into joy and you mothers that
[1:20:12] had more than one or two or three
[1:20:14] children or just one and I was listening
[1:20:17] to this I think they call him priest a
[1:20:20] Catholic priest and he was talking about
[1:20:24] he was inv deed to go uh to the birth of
[1:20:27] his godson and so he's a priest he's not
[1:20:30] married in the Catholic church and he
[1:20:32] said he went to go see this event of
[1:20:35] somebody being
[1:20:36] born and he said the imagery that's
[1:20:40] imprinted eternally in his mind he can
[1:20:44] never he said he he was watching this
[1:20:46] birth take place and he actually passed
[1:20:49] out it was too much couldn't take it but
[1:20:53] it's so it's so much aart hard life
[1:20:55] that's how we all got here but we
[1:20:57] weren't aware when we were born we
[1:20:59] weren't conscious enough but we all went
[1:21:01] through a birth to be here but this pain
[1:21:07] that the woman goes through in her labor
[1:21:10] pains and then through all of the
[1:21:12] changes of course the impregnation then
[1:21:15] the series of body changes and then
[1:21:18] another life being formed and then she
[1:21:21] gives birth the pains the labor pains
[1:21:25] get so great and tremendous many times
[1:21:28] that some mothers don't make it through
[1:21:31] the whole birth process it's a very
[1:21:34] sensitive time it's a very you know it's
[1:21:37] life is coming in to the to the Earth
[1:21:41] through this birth but this pain being
[1:21:44] turned into Joy brother random takes
[1:21:46] this scripture in St John chapter 16 and
[1:21:49] preaches birth pains and he types that
[1:21:53] with the church and here Jesus now
[1:21:56] getting ready to leave and he's
[1:21:57] preparing his disciples for his leaving
[1:22:00] and going away and he types it with your
[1:22:04] pain shall be turned into Joy you know
[1:22:08] those mothers that have that first child
[1:22:10] should say you know I'll never do
[1:22:13] something like this again it was so
[1:22:14] painful I'll never go through this again
[1:22:18] and then you find them five years later
[1:22:20] with three or four kids it's like
[1:22:22] because they you forget because the Joy
[1:22:24] of having the baby after you have that
[1:22:27] child is so beautiful it's so nice it's
[1:22:31] beautiful but when you got to go through
[1:22:33] the Pains of it can be very very drastic
[1:22:36] and Jesus speaks of this and he brings
[1:22:38] these types we see it in the Bible here
[1:22:41] where in Israel the Lord is going to
[1:22:46] increase them and bless them through
[1:22:50] opening of the womb through making the
[1:22:54] woman
[1:22:55] fertile he's going to anoint them the
[1:22:58] mothers that we're going to grow this
[1:23:02] nation from within we're not going to
[1:23:04] we're not going to go proelite from the
[1:23:06] Egyptians and from the the amalekites
[1:23:09] and we don't we don't need to help build
[1:23:11] our numbers by going to another Nation
[1:23:14] but no these mothers are going to give
[1:23:16] birth and through the channels of birth
[1:23:19] God is going to bless them Deuteronomy
[1:23:22] chapter 7 verses 1 and
[1:23:26] two the scripture says when the Lord thy
[1:23:28] God shall bring thee into the land
[1:23:30] whether thou goest to possess it and
[1:23:32] hath cast out many nations before thee
[1:23:35] Hittites gites amorites Canaanites
[1:23:38] perizzites the hivites jebusites Seven
[1:23:42] Nations greater and mightier than thou
[1:23:46] and when the Lord thy God shall deliver
[1:23:48] them before thee Thou shalt Smite them
[1:23:51] and utterly destroy them don't make any
[1:23:54] Covenant with them nor show Mercy unto
[1:23:58] them now remember all these nations had
[1:24:00] a head start on Israel because they were
[1:24:03] under a bondage and a very oppressive
[1:24:07] bondage they were slaying the male
[1:24:10] children it was very very harsh and very
[1:24:13] hard so this young tender little Nation
[1:24:17] now is going out on its own finally
[1:24:20] leaving Egypt going to make its own name
[1:24:23] build its own sanctuaries go and worship
[1:24:26] the way they want to worship under the
[1:24:28] leadership of the pillar of fire and the
[1:24:31] Lord says when you come into the land if
[1:24:33] you obey my voice verse 12 wherefore it
[1:24:37] shall come to pass if you hearken to
[1:24:39] these judgments and keep and do them
[1:24:42] that the Lord thy God shall keep unto
[1:24:45] thee the Covenant and the mercy which
[1:24:48] you swear unto your fathers and he will
[1:24:51] love thee and bless thee and what
[1:24:55] multiply thee he will also bless the
[1:24:59] fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy
[1:25:02] land thy corn thy wine thy oil the
[1:25:06] increase of thy kind the flocks of thy
[1:25:09] sheep in the land which I swear unto the
[1:25:11] fathers to give thee Thou shalt be
[1:25:13] blessed above all people there shall not
[1:25:17] be male or female Barren among you among
[1:25:23] your cattle
[1:25:24] and the Lord will take away all the
[1:25:27] sicknesses and so forth you know this
[1:25:30] blessing of the Lord if you keep his
[1:25:34] judgments this is actually a
[1:25:37] blessing that a woman would have a child
[1:25:41] that the Lord would bless her with life
[1:25:45] but we're living in a time now and Jesus
[1:25:48] spoke of the day that they wouldn't want
[1:25:51] to have children and it's actually
[1:25:55] um a prophecy that he gives in Luke
[1:25:59] 23 if you turn there quickly in verse
[1:26:02] number
[1:26:12] 28 verse 27 there followed him a great
[1:26:15] company of people of the women which
[1:26:19] also bewell and lamented him this is his
[1:26:22] coming up to his crucifixion
[1:26:25] Jesus turning unto them and said
[1:26:27] Daughters of Jerusalem so he's speaking
[1:26:29] to the sisters he's speaking to the
[1:26:33] daughters he says weep not for me but
[1:26:36] weep for yourselves and for your
[1:26:38] children for behold the days are coming
[1:26:42] in the which they shall say blessed are
[1:26:45] the barren and the wounds that never
[1:26:48] bear and the paps which never gave suck
[1:26:52] then shall they begin to say to the
[1:26:54] mountains fall on us now this is a
[1:26:57] prophecy that brother Brandon picks up
[1:26:59] in the message invisible Union of the
[1:27:01] bride of Christ and he picks this up in
[1:27:05] speaking of the day that people wouldn't
[1:27:08] want to Bear
[1:27:10] children yes some of the movie stars
[1:27:12] they'll adopt one right because it's
[1:27:15] cute it's popular they'll adopt one that
[1:27:17] don't even look like them they're go to
[1:27:20] one of these other countries and adopt
[1:27:22] one and I'm I'm all for adoption that's
[1:27:24] great but then but the day of them not
[1:27:28] wanting to Bear children not going not
[1:27:31] wanting to leave from being a girl to
[1:27:35] becoming a wife and from a wife to
[1:27:38] becoming a mother they they want to do
[1:27:41] they want to do their own thing but it's
[1:27:43] a prophecy speaking of the day that the
[1:27:46] women wouldn't want to have children
[1:27:49] anymore they want a cat they want a dog
[1:27:53] and furthermore now they want to be a
[1:27:56] cat or some kind of animal or
[1:28:00] whatever they won't have a baby they'll
[1:28:02] have a an animal and give that Lov and
[1:28:06] care to an
[1:28:08] animal there's nothing wrong with caring
[1:28:11] and loving an animal that's not what
[1:28:12] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:28:14] in Li of having a
[1:28:18] baby I'm talking about the attitude
[1:28:21] against being a mother
[1:28:24] that's what we're speaking of that's
[1:28:25] what Jesus is speaking
[1:28:27] of of the day that they wouldn't want to
[1:28:30] do that but I'm so glad that the true
[1:28:34] church is a type of a true mother what's
[1:28:38] a mother someone that has born a child
[1:28:42] someone that has gone through the birth
[1:28:45] the impregnation process and then born a
[1:28:49] child you know this barrenness was a
[1:28:54] curse in many instances of the Bible in
[1:28:57] the
[1:28:58] scriptures in
[1:29:01] um with with King David when his wife
[1:29:06] had laughed at him or scorned him for
[1:29:10] dancing in the spirit and second Samuel
[1:29:14] Samuel Michael was her name or Michelle
[1:29:17] however you would call it she scorned
[1:29:19] him and and the
[1:29:21] Lord uh pronounced bar Ness on her she
[1:29:25] couldn't bear a child it was like a
[1:29:28] curse and today many people would think
[1:29:32] that would be a
[1:29:33] blessing yes but not in the Bible days
[1:29:37] not scripturally in Genesis chapter 20
[1:29:40] when aimik and had had taken Sarah from
[1:29:44] Abraham when God brought a curse upon
[1:29:48] aimik uh H he he he he caused all the
[1:29:51] women to to not be able to have any
[1:29:53] children
[1:29:55] that baren is struck this is in the
[1:29:57] natural what about in the
[1:29:59] spiritual what about a church that ain't
[1:30:02] bringing forth pastors teachers
[1:30:05] preachers what about a church that don't
[1:30:08] have nobody at the
[1:30:10] altar what about nobody coming through
[1:30:13] into the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:17] Ghost we should not be
[1:30:19] satisfied if somebody ain't weeping and
[1:30:22] Welling their way
[1:30:24] through the cross of Calvary coming to a
[1:30:28] new
[1:30:28] birth like Abel in the garden he grabbed
[1:30:33] that
[1:30:34] lamb he struck him down he strapped him
[1:30:38] up and then he took his life it was
[1:30:41] blood it was emotional it was terrible
[1:30:45] but it brought forth a revelation of
[1:30:49] what God wanted what about a true church
[1:30:52] today true
[1:30:55] church has baptisms taking place new
[1:30:59] people coming in somebody going to tell
[1:31:03] somebody else not just preaching to the
[1:31:06] same crowd every morning don't roll your
[1:31:09] eyes when a sinner comes in here you're
[1:31:13] supposed to see sinners in here you see
[1:31:16] a sinner come in here oh my we should be
[1:31:20] praising God if we see a sinner come
[1:31:23] into the house of the Lord Lord but many
[1:31:25] assemblies everybody turns and look cuz
[1:31:29] she's wearing pants where you think
[1:31:31] she's supposed to be she's supposed to
[1:31:34] be right here to hear the word of the
[1:31:39] lord we make it hard for the sinner or
[1:31:42] the
[1:31:43] newcomer because we're so caught up in
[1:31:45] our carnal ways they don't look like us
[1:31:48] they don't dress like us look how they
[1:31:50] dress look at this and look at that
[1:31:51] that's what we wanted
[1:31:54] that's why we're
[1:31:56] here something's wrong and we don't see
[1:31:59] that God sends them Sinners into this
[1:32:04] church and let them come through to the
[1:32:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be
[1:32:11] saved from their
[1:32:18] sins that's what a that's what a true
[1:32:21] church a true mother
[1:32:25] wants to have a
[1:32:28] baby she wants her womb to give forth
[1:32:32] this child proverbs 30 verse 15- 16 says
[1:32:36] this the horse Lea hath two daughters
[1:32:40] that cry give give there are three
[1:32:44] things that are never satisfied yes four
[1:32:48] things say not is it enough the
[1:32:52] grave the barren womb the earth that is
[1:32:56] not filled with water and the fire say

[1:33:40] mother is a type of not
[1:33:44] only um her body or type of the land
[1:33:49] that God was going to bless it's a type
[1:33:51] of the church also that the Lord wanted
[1:33:53] to bless Israel with
[1:33:56] numbers more
[1:33:58] people
[1:34:00] increase men increase the women increase
[1:34:05] the youth through the birth through the
[1:34:08] birth Channel and the Lord wants to
[1:34:10] increase the church through the same way
[1:34:12] now these are the labor pains now these
[1:34:14] labor pains are they're they're they're

[1:35:20] bring forth the child in the church
[1:35:22] there it gets hard sometime brother
[1:35:23] manam deals with this talking about um
[1:35:27] in the Hebrews and the message the ark
[1:35:30] he says I was reading the other day
[1:35:32] while sitting on a Creek Bank of how
[1:35:34] that those Hebrew mothers that gave
[1:35:37] birth back there to the
[1:35:40] Patriarchs and each one when she come
[1:35:43] forth uttered his name while in labor
[1:35:46] and said what he would
[1:35:48] be what he would be in the last days not
[1:35:51] knowing what she was doing and muttering
[1:35:53] taking a hold of Genesis 49 and type it
[1:35:57] where they're in time where they're at
[1:35:59] and watch what it is brother brandom
[1:36:03] continues in the message Revelation the
[1:36:05] book of symbols 1956 he says this
[1:36:09] here paragraph 59 watch all those names
[1:36:13] they mean something every name in the
[1:36:15] Bible when you see one name in the Bible
[1:36:18] it means something did you know Israel's
[1:36:21] wives when they gave birth to the 12
[1:36:24] Patriarchs each one of those mothers
[1:36:26] when they were having the baby the baby
[1:36:28] was being born and them groaning the
[1:36:32] groans that they came out and named
[1:36:35] those boys and the Very groans that they
[1:36:38] give signify the nature of the child and
[1:36:42] the place they'd make their final
[1:36:45] resting place every Gran amen under the
[1:36:50] power of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:53] wow every gr grown under the power of
[1:36:56] the Holy
[1:36:58] Ghost these are the labor pains this
[1:37:01] mother Hebrew
[1:37:04] mother really speaking of uh uh Rachel
[1:37:08] and Leah they built the house and then
[1:37:11] their handmaids bah and the other uh
[1:37:14] secondary one they they built the house
[1:37:17] with these boys and in their labor pains
[1:37:20] they brought forth the name and this
[1:37:22] name I identify the child not only in
[1:37:26] the Homeland but even in eternity
[1:37:28] brother random says he says every
[1:37:33] groan it signify the nature of the child
[1:37:36] in the place that they make their final
[1:37:38] resting place every groan amen under the
[1:37:43] power of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:37:45] reason we should be groaning in the
[1:37:48] spirit now I don't mean a lot of this
[1:37:50] put on but I mean really introvert Veil
[1:37:54] for the church then you can get some
[1:37:57] real speaking with tongues
[1:37:59] interpretation brother bam continues on
[1:38:02] in the message adoption number one
[1:38:04] paragraph number 48 he says this notice
[1:38:09] oh this just burns our heart each one of
[1:38:12] those Hebrew mothers giving birth to
[1:38:14] those children she spoke the very place
[1:38:17] in her labor pains where they would be
[1:38:20] positioned in the promised land oh a
[1:38:23] great study if we can only get into the
[1:38:26] details get it in details which would
[1:38:29] take hours and hours someday when we get
[1:38:31] our church fixed I'd like to just come
[1:38:34] and take a solid month or two just stay
[1:38:37] right with it watch when they each one
[1:38:39] of those mothers when she called out
[1:38:42] Ephraim she was in labor positionally
[1:38:45] Place him where his feet was setting in
[1:38:48] oil just exactly every one of them
[1:38:50] wherever they were at Joshua not knowing
[1:38:53] this but by inspiration LED of the Holy
[1:38:56] Spirit after being uh uh um being into
[1:39:00] the promis land give each man his
[1:39:03] promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[1:39:05] promised through the birth back there
[1:39:09] how that God has set some in the church
[1:39:13] through the labor pains oh they get
[1:39:17] tremendous sometimes when a church is
[1:39:20] groaning under the persecution of the
[1:39:22] outside World Believing on the Lord
[1:39:26] Jesus so we we won't get persecuted from
[1:39:30] the outside world if we look like the
[1:39:32] world the only reason why Church get
[1:39:35] persecuted from the outside world is
[1:39:37] because we're doing contrary to what
[1:39:40] they are doing and they persecute you on
[1:39:42] the job they might not come here and
[1:39:45] persecute us here at this building
[1:39:47] they'll persecute you in the social
[1:39:49] group they'll persecute you at school
[1:39:52] you young people to serve the Lord and
[1:39:54] hold a standard 10 years old 12 years
[1:39:58] old 15 16 all the way up teenag and then
[1:40:02] in your 20s and then you're going to
[1:40:04] work and trying to live a life that will
[1:40:07] be pleasing to the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:40:10] outside world will pressurize you and
[1:40:13] persecute you get in your 30s and 40s
[1:40:17] the world is still on your back 50s on
[1:40:21] up all the way through if you're trying
[1:40:23] to hold up what's right the world is
[1:40:25] after you to persecute you but these
[1:40:28] these
[1:40:30] groanings thr these
[1:40:32] persecutions are what's supposed to
[1:40:35] bring forth a birth with the apostles
[1:40:38] prophets teachers evangelists Ministries
[1:40:43] growing where's the next pastor at he
[1:40:46] might be in the Sunday school over there

[1:43:00] bringing forth the
[1:43:02] birth God has set them in the church
[1:43:05] through the labor
[1:43:07] pains he continues on in this message as
[1:43:11] I was with Moses I'll be with thee 1960
[1:43:14] paragraph
[1:43:17] 127 said the tribe of Joseph better than
[1:43:20] he did Judah but he didn't do it that
[1:43:22] way he divided it according to the word
[1:43:26] revealed by the spirit he divided
[1:43:30] according to tribe and notice he done it
[1:43:34] by the
[1:43:35] Revelation by
[1:43:37] discernment by the discernment of God's
[1:43:40] spirit he did it each one of those
[1:43:43] Hebrew mothers giving birth to those
[1:43:45] babies that's paragraph
[1:43:47] 128 called their name and each one of
[1:43:50] their name has a meaning
[1:43:53] so brother Ram continues on in paragraph
[1:43:57] number 131 all right and I take my time
[1:44:02] here thank you paragraph 131 and when
[1:44:05] this great thing taking place when each
[1:44:08] one of these Hebrew mothers in
[1:44:10] travailing in childbirth called out like
[1:44:14] Ruben that placed him positionally in
[1:44:17] Palestine exactly the way that a mother
[1:44:20] said and called his name and said it I
[1:44:23] don't have it all wrote down here but
[1:44:24] say Ruben meant sheep herder Gad meant
[1:44:27] cattle Riser Ephraim meant corn raiser
[1:44:30] Now by spiritual discernment Joshua the
[1:44:33] new leader by spiritual discernment
[1:44:35] Place each one where he belong divided
[1:44:39] the land just exactly you know that's a
[1:44:43] that's a ministry right there knowing
[1:44:45] where you
[1:44:47] belong knowing what your name means
[1:44:51] spiritually speaking
[1:44:53] knowing what a revelation is to you not
[1:44:57] so much what other churches and people
[1:44:59] are doing not just questions and answers
[1:45:02] to argue you know some mental
[1:45:06] exercise but you positionally knowing
[1:45:10] where you
[1:45:11] belong that's what a mother that's what
[1:45:13] a true church is doing they're finding
[1:45:16] their position in this
[1:45:18] community he said well let's move to
[1:45:20] another place because it's nicer did you
[1:45:23] witness to the one you was in
[1:45:28] right yeah we in the wrong we in a bad
[1:45:30] neighborhood we in the wrong place well

[1:45:48] the NBA they call it making and creating

[1:46:23] where I'll survive that's where I'll
[1:46:26] Thrive that's where I'll be fruitful in
[1:46:29] the land that God gave

[1:46:39] over there no make it happen right
[1:46:43] here A True Believer all he need is God
[1:46:46] on his side all he need is one or two
[1:46:49] scriptures and the anointing in his life
[1:46:53] and he'll make it work he'll make it
[1:46:55] work God will work it out in his
[1:46:59] life amen praise the
[1:47:05] Lord oh
[1:47:08] my yes finding your place finding your
[1:47:13] position Joshua placed them and give
[1:47:16] them that spiritual discernment now
[1:47:18] these mothers had a tremendous part in
[1:47:20] their life they
[1:47:24] um they named them under this struggle
[1:47:28] between two
[1:47:29] sisters Leah wanted Jacob's
[1:47:33] love Rachel
[1:47:36] wanted Jacob's
[1:47:39] children and that stress and that rub
[1:47:43] and that that going back and forth with
[1:47:46] my sister and the labor pains get so
[1:47:50] great
[1:47:51] sometimes did you you all know that part
[1:47:54] of the reason that we have this air
[1:47:56] conditioning
[1:47:57] today is because one of our friends in
[1:47:59] the neighborhood stole the old
[1:48:04] one I called them hyenas brother
[1:48:08] George I corrected that I said they're
[1:48:10] not hyenas no there are
[1:48:13] friends that we need to go witness
[1:48:18] to but we got on it real quick didn't we
[1:48:20] brother Chris we got on here quick why
[1:48:23] did it happen so quick because somebody
[1:48:25] stole the old unit that we was squeezing
[1:48:27] out all the AC we can get out of
[1:48:30] it so if you're going to go thank
[1:48:33] somebody go out here and find one of
[1:48:34] these homeless people whoever stole the
[1:48:35] O unit and go thank
[1:48:39] them sometimes you need to thank the
[1:48:42] enemies that criticize you because your
[1:48:45] enemies keep you on your knees if
[1:48:48] everybody loved you you wouldn't have a
[1:48:51] prayer life but thank
[1:48:54] God we got some
[1:48:56] enemies that keeps you on your knees
[1:49:00] keeps you crying out to God asking God
[1:49:04] to have
[1:49:06] mercy yes through the labor pains
[1:49:09] through the birth through the the stress
[1:49:12] through the
[1:49:13] struggle then it brings forth yes a new
[1:49:17] air conditioning un it brings forth
[1:49:21] life amen
[1:49:23] man this is what it
[1:49:25] is brother brandom brings that out oh so
[1:49:31] well now
[1:49:36] this type how he brings it to the church
[1:49:39] now I just want to close with this here
[1:49:43] get to one one more of these mothers in
[1:49:46] Matthew chapter 20 and verse
[1:49:49] 23 let turn there quickly
[1:49:56] Matthew chapter
[1:49:58] 20 verse number 20 we remember this
[1:50:03] sister we don't know her name we just
[1:50:06] know her children's name then came to
[1:50:09] him the mother of zebede children with
[1:50:12] her sons worshiping him and
[1:50:16] Desiring a certain thing of
[1:50:19] him now if this was a minister watch out
[1:50:21] Minister what you would ask ask
[1:50:23] for single mom or single guy what would
[1:50:26] you ask for but this is a mother
[1:50:29] Desiring a certain thing of him and he
[1:50:31] said unto her what wil thou she said
[1:50:34] unto him grant that these my two sons
[1:50:36] May sit the one on the right hand and
[1:50:39] the other one on the left in thy
[1:50:41] kingdom but Jesus answered and said ye
[1:50:45] know not what you ask are you able to
[1:50:48] drink the cup that I shall drink of and
[1:50:50] to be baptized with the baptism that I I
[1:50:52] am baptized with they say unto him we
[1:50:55] are able and he said unto them ye shall
[1:50:59] drink indeed of my cup and be baptized
[1:51:02] with the baptism that I'm baptized with
[1:51:04] but to sit on my right hand and on my
[1:51:07] left hand is not mine to give but it
[1:51:10] shall be given to them who is prepared
[1:51:12] for you know what's interesting about
[1:51:14] this question is is my mind says what
[1:51:19] inspired this mother to ask this where's
[1:51:23] she getting this from ain't nobody else
[1:51:25] asking for it you know there's another
[1:51:27] recording where she asks for it and all
[1:51:29] the disciples get mad at at her and her
[1:51:33] and her two sons and the two sons like
[1:51:35] that's my mom I mean I didn't ask my mom
[1:51:39] was
[1:51:41] asking why was what is this Mom asking
[1:51:44] for why would she ask for this only a
[1:51:47] mother thinks like this a preacher would
[1:51:51] be like Lord
[1:51:54] can I sit on can I sit on your right
[1:51:56] hand or left hand I prefer the right but
[1:51:59] if not the right I'll can I sit on the
[1:52:01] left hand but not a mother a mother is
[1:52:05] Desiring a position for her two
[1:52:08] sons this is a mother that's thinking
[1:52:11] about you know moms have the coldest
[1:52:17] meals most of the time that's right
[1:52:20] because everybody else eats
[1:52:23] first mom has a stress and a strain
[1:52:27] that's in
[1:52:28] her that cares about her
[1:52:31] children will go heads up with a bear or
[1:52:35] a lion to save her babies that's a
[1:52:39] mother's love and this mother moved over
[1:52:43] it it looked carnal it looked carnal but
[1:52:46] it really was a spiritual question that
[1:52:48] she's asking she says can my son sit at
[1:52:51] your right hand and left hand she's
[1:52:53] saying can my sons sit where the
[1:52:56] Overcomers are going to
[1:52:59] sit Paul or Peter didn't ask Timothy
[1:53:02] none of the other ones asked this but
[1:53:04] this mother asked this question and with
[1:53:07] this question brought forth an answer
[1:53:10] that would speak to a different
[1:53:13] generation our age for the Overcomer
[1:53:15] that overcomes they will be the ones
[1:53:18] that will sit there brother Brandon

[1:57:11] see why she's a type of the church which
[1:57:15] has the same
[1:57:17] responsibility as a woman has a sacred
[1:57:20] responsibility to her mother Hood to her
[1:57:23] virtues to her husband the church has a
[1:57:26] sacred
[1:57:27] responsibility to prayer into what the
[1:57:31] word and to what to Christ just the same
[1:57:36] as the woman has so as a church our
[1:57:39] responsibility is prayer the word and
[1:57:44] Christ which is the anointing that's
[1:57:46] what we're standing on that's what we're
[1:57:47] founded
[1:57:49] upon that's how we get popular right

[1:57:56] describes Who We Are by how we are
[1:58:01] responsible in our prayer life we are
[1:58:05] responsible how we handle the
[1:58:07] word we are responsible to the Lord
[1:58:12] Jesus Christ he's the head of our life
[1:58:16] and we serve him reverently and very
[1:58:20] seriously with the utmost attention
[1:58:23] every detail every word every moment
[1:58:27] will be accounted for we don't do this
[1:58:30] on the side this is our very life it's
[1:58:35] to the prayer it's to the word and it is
[1:58:40] to
[1:58:41] Christ that's the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:59:30] verse number 28 talking about the day
[1:59:34] coming wasn't that day that Jesus spoke
[1:59:37] it but the day will come when they will

[1:59:44] say
[1:59:45] blessed are the
[1:59:48] barren and the wombs that never be be
[1:59:53] and the peps which never gave up think
[1:59:56] of a service and just spiritualize that

[2:01:30] that when women wouldn't no more want
[2:01:33] children they want a dog or cat or

[2:01:45] don't want that's the remarks of
[2:01:47] Hollywood they don't want his woman to
[2:01:50] be a old mother hub
[2:01:52] so he'll he'll have some operation
[2:01:54] performed on himself or her or one
[2:01:57] that'll keep them from having children
[2:02:00] they don't want no children Jesus spoke
[2:02:03] of it what did he say the time they'll
[2:02:05] be to cry for the rocks in the mountain
[2:02:08] to fall on us she'll practice birth
[2:02:11] control she can so she can go to parties
[2:02:14] she can't be bothered with the baby
[2:02:16] nursing her it'll disform her when she's
[2:02:19] pregnated it'll be it'll disform her she
[2:02:22] won't look like she used to and her
[2:02:24] husband ignorant enough to let her go
[2:02:26] that way she won't give him a Child
[2:02:28] Jesus spoke of it he said that when they
[2:02:31] were doing this at that time they're
[2:02:35] going to crying in for the rocks to fall
[2:02:39] on them it's coming of the
[2:02:43] Lord they pay great sums of money for
[2:02:46] cats dogs to

[2:05:01] message that we are not children of the
[2:05:05] Bond woman but of the
[2:05:07] free that's them out there not us in
[2:05:11] here we having babies all the
[2:05:16] time another baby another baby another
[2:05:20] one another one
[2:05:23] we want that cry room full of
[2:05:26] mothers spiritually speaking one them
[2:05:30] laboring at the altar laboring in their
[2:05:32] seat laboring with the word taking that
[2:05:36] message that God sent seriously handling
[2:05:40] in it it's the word of life and
[2:05:43] producing it in her life amen
[2:05:47] God richly bless you but the spiritual
[2:05:51] thought thought that this son this
[2:05:54] mother of zebede had to ask that
[2:05:56] question it brings us into what sister
[2:05:59] hady right asked for I talked about
[2:06:02] those mothers
[2:06:04] before um the mother in
[2:06:07] Finland the Spanish Mother Down In
[2:06:09] Mexico that had the dead
[2:06:11] baby the mother in Memphis that had the
[2:06:15] son that gone out into the world and she
[2:06:18] had prayed for him and he's out in the
[2:06:19] world dying with the disease yes sir and
[2:06:22] she prayed and brought the prophet to
[2:06:24] her
[2:06:25] neighborhood and then uh then the the
[2:06:28] little Finnish mother who who those two
[2:06:31] boys were killed in a car accident there
[2:06:33] in
[2:06:34] Finland and I think that mother is about
[2:06:37] 25 years old brother brandham says and
[2:06:39] that that one boy had a vision over his
[2:06:43] life and brother brandham looked through
[2:06:45] his Bible said this is a vision and
[2:06:47] called his life back there's two boys
[2:06:51] called his life back and the mother of
[2:06:54] the one that didn't get called back she
[2:06:56] wanted to know
[2:06:59] why and and he's trying to explain to
[2:07:01] her the team is trying to explain to her
[2:07:04] sister that was a vision are you a
[2:07:06] Christian no I'm not a Christian well
[2:07:08] why don't you be a Christian and maybe
[2:07:10] God will hear your prayer and she says
[2:07:11] okay I'll become a Christian okay she
[2:07:13] became a Christian now go raise up my
[2:07:16] baby you're like no sis it don't work
[2:07:19] that way I got to see a vision well go
[2:07:21] see one that's right she wasn't moving
[2:07:23] this is Mom because because he did it
[2:07:26] for one if he did it for one Glory if he
[2:07:31] can do it for one he can do it for me
[2:07:34] too and he can do it again and again and
[2:07:38] again she wasn't even a Christian knew
[2:07:40] nothing about it but she walked in those
[2:07:43] channels she stayed with them calling
[2:07:45] and pressuring the prophet is you the
[2:07:48] prophecy of vision and God sent the
[2:07:51] prophet a vision of her boy too and
[2:07:54] brother Brandon says the mother's
[2:07:58] prayer saved the child that's what he
[2:08:01] said the mother's prayer saved that
[2:08:03] child one had a vision one had a
[2:08:09] mother that mother moved on God glory
[2:08:14] that mother wouldn't move she stayed
[2:08:16] right with it stayed right with it
[2:08:19] praying for her baby
[2:08:21] and the Holy Spirit sent a vision to the
[2:08:24] prophet said go call that
[2:08:26] mother amen that's the god that we
[2:08:31] serve we think of sister Hattie
[2:08:33] R how she was a widow but she was a
[2:08:37] mother when the Holy Spirit came down
[2:08:40] into her room and dealt with her dealt
[2:08:44] with the prophet telling the stories of
[2:08:46] what was going on and she said that's
[2:08:48] nothing but the truth and then the
[2:08:50] opportunity came
[2:08:52] for her to request now if it was a
[2:08:54] preacher or Pastor or maybe a pastor
[2:08:57] would say you know what would I request
[2:08:59] all I requested you know maybe our
[2:09:02] church would grow we get our we need a
[2:09:05] building we we request whatever we would
[2:09:08] request all right but this mother she
[2:09:11] requested the greatest thing and brother
[2:09:13] Rand says God knew she would ask for
[2:09:16] amen so sister hadie ask what you will
[2:09:18] to be given to your sister you have
[2:09:21] money
[2:09:21] your parents are broke down to can
[2:09:23] restore their youth their health back to
[2:09:25] them and what did she ask where she did
[2:09:28] like James and John's mother did she she
[2:09:32] she went into the realm of the spiritual
[2:09:35] things and she saw the most important
[2:09:37] thing and that was for the Salvation of
[2:09:40] her two
[2:09:44] boys that's what I want you sure that's
[2:09:47] what you want that's what I want I'll be
[2:09:49] good I'm broke
[2:09:52] and we have our problems around here I'm

[2:09:56] make this thing work over here got these
[2:09:58] two boys going astray and this what I
[2:10:03] want and the lord gave her what she
[2:10:06] asked
[2:10:08] for what virtue was in that how
[2:10:11] beautiful was
[2:10:13] that you know some of us Brothers need a
[2:10:16] mother's
[2:10:17] heart in these areas right here and then
