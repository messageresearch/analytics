[1:05] beheld and lo a black horse and he that
[1:07] sat on him had a pair of balances in his
[1:10] hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of
[1:13] the four Beast say a measure of wheat
[1:15] for a penny and three measures of Bley
[1:18] for a penny and see thou hurt not the
[1:22] oil and the wine I believe we left off

[2:22] Brena now and John walked up to see what
[2:25] it would be what did he see he seen a
[2:29] black horse
[2:30] and his rider had a balel or scales in
[2:33] his
[2:34] hand now that's the first thing he saw
[2:38] when the lamb announced it uh broke the
[2:40] seal then the other beast and beasts
[2:42] were taking a turn about announcing come
[2:45] see John where he was standing maybe
[2:47] like this he walks over here when his
[2:49] lamb open walked over usually the
[2:51] Thunder strikes as we've seen the first
[2:53] seal and he watches to see what takes
[2:55] place and he sees a man coming first on
[2:57] a white horse he watches him ride down
[3:01] on down to John sees him come to the end
[3:04] he sees him come down he's White Horse
[3:06] got a bow in his hand and the rider has
[3:10] and he has no Arrows with it the next
[3:12] thing he sees he gets a crown rides
[3:14] right on through then we find out then
[3:17] the light there comes again he opens
[3:19] another and looks now here comes a a red
[3:24] horse this man has a sword in his hand
[3:27] rides right on down through the
[3:29] scriptures see with his sword in his
[3:31] hand and was to kill and take peace from
[3:34] the earth now the lamb opens another
[3:37] seal another one of the living creatures
[3:39] like a man say come see now he walks up
[3:42] see what this is and what he does there
[3:45] comes a rider on a black horse now last
[3:48] night we found out that the same Rider
[3:51] that rode the White Horse was the same
[3:53] one on the
[3:55] Redwood and the voice said in the midst
[3:59] of the called out to see to have come to
[4:01] see what it was he was uh in this living
[4:03] creatures and he saw this black horse
[4:06] and when the voice in the midst of the
[4:08] four beasts called out a measure of
[4:11] wheat for a penny and and uh three
[4:14] measures of barley for a penny but see
[4:16] it thou hurt not the the oril and the
[4:20] wine this rer let's discuss him if you
[4:25] notice the first Rider who he was and we
[4:28] found out last night
[4:31] scripturally that the second writer was
[4:33] exactly the same man only he on another
[4:37] heart what happened it changed his
[4:40] ministry see right we found out he was
[4:44] an antichrist amen and he changed his
[4:47] position we found out that when he first
[4:50] just was a white horse he would come ad
[4:52] doing now we've taken every one of these
[4:54] right back in the
[4:56] scriptures I watch where we're at
[4:57] tonight that other Church age now
[5:01] we're come down to the Third Church age
[5:03] now just Z the Third Church age is this
[5:06] Z like with third
[5:07] horse First Church age why what the
[5:10] nians had a Doctrine see this the first
[5:13] one all right and then the first thing
[5:15] we know this nickan Doctrine it becomes
[5:20] sanctioned and was right went into
[5:23] action and they crown this fell then
[5:27] this Spirit Antichrist become in in
[5:29] carnate in a man see and we find out
[5:33] later on he becomes an incarnate devil
[5:35] too the demon goes away and the Devil
[5:37] comes in and just as that church is that
[5:41] kind of antichrist Church progresses so
[5:43] has the Bride come along amen with
[5:45] different things too justification
[5:46] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost is
[5:47] moving right on see that's
[5:49] not only they taken their Revival first
[5:53] in the church is taken it at last their
[5:55] first three years the first three stages
[5:57] of them and went through the Dark Age
[5:59] then the Third three station comes a
[6:00] church out from justification
[6:02] sanctification baptism holy ghost in
[6:04] incarnate God made manifest the moment
[6:07] here he comes in as the Antichrist as
[6:09] the false prophet then the Beast then
[6:11] the Dark Age and the church comes out of
[6:13] that Dark Age justification
[6:15] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[6:17] Incarnate Word
[6:18] [Music]
[6:19] the and he goes
[6:21] down he goes down the church goes up
[6:24] it's just as perfect as it can be oh
[6:27] it's beautiful I just love it this
[6:30] writer is the same one but another stage
[6:33] of his ministry the first stage of White
[6:36] Horse see he was a just a teacher just
[6:39] an antichrist teacher he was against the
[6:41] word of God now how can you be an
[6:44] antichrist anybody that denies that
[6:47] every word of this isn't true to be
[6:48] taught just the same as an antichrist
[6:51] because they deny the the the the word
[6:55] and he is the
[6:56] word now First Stage White Horse
[7:00] he was just a teacher but an antichrist
[7:02] spirit in its Doctrine and its
[7:06] quality it was innocent it couldn't hurt
[7:09] nothing seemed like just going on that's
[7:10] why Satan comes in oh he's slick bird
[7:13] they told he said now you know you're
[7:15] looking for wisdom you don't know what's
[7:16] right and wrong so now if your eyes were
[7:19] open you would know what and said the
[7:20] fruit is very pleasant it's good it's
[7:24] it's Pleasant to the eye you should take
[7:26] it now you don't know what it is or not
[7:27] do you no I don't but God said not to do
[7:29] it but oh well I know but God said he we
[7:33] done he said surely you won't do that
[7:35] just sweet as it could be look what it
[7:37] did watch this Antichrist Spirit rise up
[7:40] amongst the early church a doctrine of
[7:42] nickel adans niol conquer the L make a
[7:46] holy name or just well we just want
[7:48] Fellowship while you're scattered out
[7:50] here nobody knows where nobody's at I
[7:52] think we all to have an organization
[7:53] just be different see we go put oursel
[7:56] together we work to make a lodge out of
[7:58] it that's what it is amen there is no
[8:00] such thing as the Christian Church of
[8:05] Methodist that's not a church that's a l
[8:08] Baptist that's not a church it's a lodge
[8:11] there's only one church that's the
[8:13] mystical body of Jesus Christ and you're
[8:15] born into that that's right by
[8:19] predestination that's right all the
[8:22] father has given me will come no man can
[8:25] come unless the father calls me and all
[8:27] he's give me will come to me so that
[8:29] that's it he just the lamb sits there
[8:31] making making intercession till the last
[8:33] one comes in the little bell rings and
[8:35] he walks out and takes his possession so
[8:38] brings his church home his subjects and
[8:40] cast his enemy into the lake of far and
[8:42] all of his subjects go in there with him
[8:44] and that's it then we walk out in the
[8:46] Millennium same riter now this first
[8:50] stage he was innocent and second now
[8:54] after you went a little bit higher a
[8:55] little more than that the second stage
[8:58] the Bible said he be given given a crown
[9:00] and they crowned the man a Superman see
[9:03] crowned him and then the Bible didn't
[9:06] call him a pope the Bible called him a
[9:09] false prophet why yeah of course he was
[9:13] be a false prophet by his Antichrist
[9:15] spirit that taught Antichrist against
[9:18] the original
[9:19] word because if you taught against the
[9:21] original word it was Antichrist and the
[9:24] word is God say Christ but then in the N
[9:28] see a counseling was made and
[9:29] Constantine give him all the property
[9:31] and then what did he do then he see
[9:35] Satan giving his throne and Authority
[9:38] the Bible said so as we went through it
[9:40] now the next thing we find out that the
[9:43] devil controls all politics that ever
[9:47] has been or ever will be we find out in
[9:50] Matthew 4:11 and now we find out then
[9:53] that Satan already had politics but he's
[9:56] trying to get the church so he goes down
[9:58] to deceive it he gets his Superman Works
[10:00] him into an organization and crowns him
[10:05] viker a
[10:07] Christ Christ acted instead of God Amen
[10:11] see this guy's a biker instead of God
[10:13] see it's the same instead of God what
[10:15] he's supposed to be a biker under Christ
[10:17] now now when he did that then what did
[10:20] he do then he Satan tuck his political
[10:24] power which he was already over and took
[10:28] the religious power which has already
[10:31] been crowned and put him together and
[10:34] then he made him another Crown over hell
[10:36] and then had past on if they pay enough
[10:38] money to get them
[10:39] out so now he's he's back over Heaven
[10:45] over Purgatory as he wants to call it
[10:47] such thing the Bible see but he had to
[10:48] make something the Bible said it come
[10:50] out of the bottomless pit and returns
[10:52] back the same way and on Earth the ruler
[10:55] now what was he given in first he had a
[10:58] bow but he didn't have any Arrow but now
[11:01] he's got a mighty sword in his hand he
[11:03] can do something now then he jumps off
[11:06] his White Horse the white horse rides on
[11:08] out now he straddles what a red horse
[11:12] blood blood red horse he really rides
[11:16] that one oh sure now he's giv great
[11:19] power and a great sword to kill then he
[11:23] rides his blood red horse we see from
[11:28] the second seal that was broke last
[11:30] night he taken peace from the earth and
[11:34] did kill one another and his own
[11:36] martyrology of the Roman Catholic Church
[11:39] shows that they put 68 million
[11:42] Protestants to death from the time of St
[11:45] hippo of a St Augustine of Hippo until
[11:49] 1580
[11:51] something
[11:52] 68
[11:54] million Smucker's great reform if you
[11:57] want to read it do reform
[12:01] 68 million recorded on the martyrology
[12:06] when one of their so-called Saints got
[12:09] the Revelation that anybody that
[12:12] disagreed with the Roman Church should
[12:14] die as a heretic that's just set him
[12:16] around then boy he went to spill in the
[12:18] blood he he jumped on his white his red
[12:20] horse and he went to
[12:22] ride oh now his great power comes he was
[12:28] made biker of heaven and uh worshiped
[12:32] his God ruler of the Earth by uniting
[12:35] the church and state Together made him
[12:38] ruler on Earth give him a crown over
[12:39] that he could pray the souls out of
[12:41] purgatory he could uh also uh inter he
[12:45] was just like God on Earth instead of
[12:47] God to together he had great power to
[12:52] kill whomever did not agree with his
[12:55] command who's going to say anything to
[12:58] him Church can't stand nothing he's head
[13:00] of
[13:01] IT State can't stand nothing he's head
[13:03] of it so they died by the
[13:07] million all them little Church's brother
[13:09] was busted up and killed and murdered
[13:12] and fed to lions and everything else
[13:15] see a dragon roam give him his seat and
[13:18] Authority the Bible said
[13:20] so so he rode his tighted red
[13:24] horse through human blood to it to come
[13:28] around red
[13:30] horse now John sees him on a black horse
[13:35] he changed something
[13:38] else I have to to say this just the way
[13:42] it comes to me amen amen and if it come
[13:46] to me and didn't compare with the rest
[13:48] of the scriptures then God never give it
[13:50] see the scriptures has to ever one it's
[13:52] just one a great big big thing like that
[13:56] scripture has to agree with scripture
[13:58] and anything's contrary to the scripture

[17:03] been absolutely supernaturally
[17:08] revealed now here is the mystery of the
[17:11] black horse according to what it was
[17:13] revealed to meise
[17:17] Lord he has started riding
[17:21] him in the time of the Dark
[17:24] Ages that's what the dark harsh
[17:27] represented the dark ages for it was a
[17:30] time of midnight to the True Believers
[17:33] amen that was left watch now in that
[17:37] church
[17:38] age at middle Church age the dark Church
[17:41] age watch how it says you just have a
[17:44] little
[17:44] strength is a midnight to
[17:48] them for the True Believer
[17:52] now watch practically all hope had been
[17:57] taken from the true
[18:02] church for this fell controled both
[18:06] church and
[18:08] state what are they going to
[18:12] do see Catholicism had taken over both

[18:31] know your history watch it and you well
[18:33] you won't have to even know it to know
[18:35] this now why all hope was gone that's
[18:38] his black horse now he had rode in on
[18:40] his White Horse cunning then he GI power
[18:43] he took peace slaughtered the millions
[18:45] that's what he was going to do as you
[18:46] rode on through he still does it see now
[18:49] here he is on his black horse now coming
[18:51] forth Dark Age that was at time just
[18:54] about the time after the church got set
[18:55] up and got in power they smothered out
[18:58] everything else and went through about
[19:00] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[19:01] year is what every reader knows as the
[19:03] Dark Ages how many knows that the Dark
[19:06] Ages there's your Dark Horse am
[19:09] representing that Dark Age now all
[19:12] Hope's gone no hope at all everything
[19:14] look dark for the little
[19:17] Believers now that's the reason it's
[19:20] represent a dark horse his balances are
[19:23] his scales in his hand you
[19:26] see calling out measure wheat for a
[19:29] penny and three measures of barley for a
[19:32] penny see actually that is wheat and
[19:37] barley is natural staff of life that's
[19:40] what bread and stuff's made
[19:42] from but you see he was charging for
[19:46] this yeah what it means that he was
[19:51] charging his subjects for the kind of
[19:55] the hope of life that he was standing
[19:58] out to
[19:59] by making he started in that very time
[20:01] of making them pay for
[20:06] prayers charging for prayer they still
[20:09] do it no venius because what was he
[20:13] doing capturing the wealth of the
[20:16] [Applause]
[20:17] world the
[20:20] scale weighing out measure of wheat or a
[20:24] penny three measures of barley for a
[20:25] penny the rider on a black horse
[20:29] see he was making stripping his subjects
[20:33] of their money when the Bible predicts
[20:37] that he holds about the wealth of the
[20:38] world as we said last night about Russia
[20:41] and all that they just take all the
[20:42] money just strip the people for
[20:44] everything they got there you are now

[21:28] was charging for that kind of a life
[21:30] that he was giving to his subjects
[21:32] charging for Prayer by the priest to

[1:05:08] of
[1:05:11] Josiah and when they brought out the
[1:05:15] money that was brought into the house of
[1:05:17] the Lord Alaya the priest found a book
[1:05:22] of the law of the Lord given by Moses
[1:05:25] Moes and halaya answered and said to
[1:05:28] shaan the Scribe I have found the book
[1:05:31] of the law in the house of the Lord and
[1:05:34] helaya delivered the book to
[1:05:36] shaan and shaan carried the book To The
[1:05:39] King and brought the king word back
[1:05:42] again saying all that was committed to
[1:05:44] thy servants they do it and they have
[1:05:47] gathered together the money that that
[1:05:50] was found in the house of the Lord and
[1:05:52] have delivered it into the hand of the
[1:05:54] overseers to the hand of the workmen
[1:05:58] shaan the Scribe told the king saying
[1:06:00] how Kaa the priest hath given me a book
[1:06:04] and chaan read it before the king and it
[1:06:07] came to pass when the king had heard the
[1:06:10] words of the law that he rent his
[1:06:14] clothes amen what an effect on the
[1:06:17] reading of the book Revelations chapter
[1:06:24] 5
[1:06:26] verses number
[1:06:29] one and I saw on the right hand of him
[1:06:32] that sat on the throne a book written
[1:06:34] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:06:37] Seven Seals I saw a strong angel
[1:06:41] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[1:06:43] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[1:06:45] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[1:06:49] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:06:52] able to open the book Nether e to look
[1:06:56] thereon and I wept much because no man
[1:07:00] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:07:06] book neither to look
[1:07:09] thereon and one of the elders said unto
[1:07:11] me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe
[1:07:14] of Judah the root of David hath
[1:07:17] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:07:20] the Seven Seals thereof amen let us pray
[1:07:25] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon
[1:07:28] the word this morning ask you to
[1:07:31] bless our feeble efforts Lord and may
[1:07:36] your name be
[1:07:37] glorified may your word not return
[1:07:41] void father to the one that hears it
[1:07:44] today May it benefit them and help them
[1:07:47] in their Christian Journey that's my
[1:07:50] prayer father The Young Ones the old
[1:07:53] ones Lord may they each one receive
[1:07:55] receive their portion from you is my
[1:07:57] prayer in jesus' name amen God bless you
[1:08:03] God bless you you may be seated the open
[1:08:05] book of redemption we started that on
[1:08:07] Sunday
[1:08:08] night and uh kind of want to move into
[1:08:12] that a little bit further the open book
[1:08:16] of redemption
[1:08:20] now the Old Testament reference that we
[1:08:23] read There was of King
[1:08:26] um
[1:08:28] Josiah this young man was just a um you
[1:08:34] know his life was
[1:08:35] spared to even become the king at 8
[1:08:39] years old is when he became a king at at
[1:08:42] the tender age of 18 or 16 years old he
[1:08:46] started to want to make his direction
[1:08:49] towards the things of the Lord and
[1:08:51] before him he had examples the other
[1:08:54] kings there was good ones and bad ones
[1:08:58] but the one that he set his heart after
[1:09:01] was King David which was the first born
[1:09:04] of the Kings of Israel he wasn't the
[1:09:06] first king but he had that position as
[1:09:08] the firstborn Kings of Israel and so as
[1:09:12] he makes his direction towards doing
[1:09:14] that there's a lot of Reform a lot of
[1:09:17] Reform he's changing laws he's moving
[1:09:20] what's important to what wasn't
[1:09:23] important he's changing the ideas of the
[1:09:26] people he's really going in a different
[1:09:29] direction and when he turns 26 years old
[1:09:33] you know the Bible says when he was 16
[1:09:35] that's when he began to to make these
[1:09:38] reformations and here he is 26 years old
[1:09:41] he has it in his heart and his mind and
[1:09:44] to rebuild the house of the Lord so he's
[1:09:46] going to put his resources in rebuilding
[1:09:49] the house of the Lord making it
[1:09:50] important again while he's doing this
[1:09:54] his men the workers find the
[1:09:58] book and this book is the book of Moses
[1:10:01] the laws of
[1:10:02] Moses and they take that book and they
[1:10:06] uh the Hokah the priest finds it then he
[1:10:09] gives it to the Scribe shaan and then
[1:10:11] shaan gets it to the hands of the king
[1:10:14] and when it gets into the hands of the
[1:10:15] king and they read it it has an impact
[1:10:19] over his life this young man tears his
[1:10:24] clothes
[1:10:25] what did he
[1:10:27] read now this
[1:10:29] book like any other book it could be a
[1:10:33] comic book it could be a law book of the
[1:10:37] library it could be a book with
[1:10:40] scribblings in it you don't know what's
[1:10:42] in the book until you open it and read
[1:10:44] it is that right so all books have the
[1:10:47] same value when they're just sitting on
[1:10:49] the shelf they don't mean nothing to
[1:10:52] nobody until it's open and read
[1:10:57] but in Revelations chap 5 this uh John
[1:11:00] in the vision he
[1:11:02] sees uh one sitting on the throne which
[1:11:05] was God and in his right hand he's
[1:11:07] holding a
[1:11:09] book and then a large Angel
[1:11:13] proclaims who is worthy to open the
[1:11:18] book or even to even look at the
[1:11:22] book and and to read what's in the book
[1:11:25] and no man was found worthy to look at
[1:11:28] the book to read the book so John starts
[1:11:30] to cry why are you crying
[1:11:33] John why are you crying it's a book it's
[1:11:37] just a book nobody can read it nobody's
[1:11:41] worthy to read it why are you crying
[1:11:43] it's because this book is the book of
[1:11:47] redemption and if nobody can read it and
[1:11:50] nobody can open it now the angel is
[1:11:54] really call calling for somebody to open
[1:11:56] it and read
[1:11:58] it who can open it somebody has to open
[1:12:01] this and read this because if if you
[1:12:05] don't open it if you don't read it I'm
[1:12:07] lost not only am I lost all of us are
[1:12:11] lost can I get a witness this is an
[1:12:14] important book this is something very
[1:12:17] emotional very very important happening
[1:12:21] in the life of John the Revelator as he
[1:12:25] sees this motion taking place no one's
[1:12:30] able to open the book no one is found
[1:12:34] worthy and brother Brandon brings it
[1:12:36] like this he says it's not that there
[1:12:38] wasn't worthy men there a worthy people
[1:12:42] there but there was no one worthy to
[1:12:45] open the book amen and uh uh uh uh
[1:12:50] Daniel was there Ezekiel was there Moses
[1:12:52] was there job was there all of the
[1:12:55] prophets of the ages gone by were there
[1:12:58] these are worthy people fine people good
[1:13:01] Brothers but they're not worthy to open
[1:13:04] the book now what is this book brother
[1:13:06] bam tells us that the book of redemption
[1:13:10] The Book of Life in The Book of
[1:13:14] Revelations the seven seal book is
[1:13:17] actually the word of God he says it is
[1:13:21] the Bible amen so let me read for you in
[1:13:24] a message M the first seal in paragraph
[1:13:28] number 31 brother vam says this John
[1:13:31] turning he saw a lamb coming out it must
[1:13:34] have been bloody and cut and wounded it
[1:13:37] had been
[1:13:41] slain it a lamb that had been slain of
[1:13:44] course it was still bloody if you have
[1:13:46] cut the lamb killed it the way the lamb
[1:13:49] was anyhow it was hacked of pieces on a
[1:13:51] cross Spears in his side Nails in his
[1:13:55] hands and feet Thorns over the brow he
[1:13:58] was in awful condition and this lamb
[1:14:00] come forth and went over to him that sat
[1:14:03] upon the throne that held the complete
[1:14:07] title deed of redemption and the lamb
[1:14:11] goes and takes the book out of the hand
[1:14:13] of him that sets upon the throne and and
[1:14:16] took and opened the seals and open the
[1:14:20] book you see the book actually was PL
[1:14:25] standing written before the foundation
[1:14:27] of the world this book The Bible was
[1:14:31] really written before the foundation of
[1:14:33] the world and Christ being the lamb was
[1:14:36] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:14:40] and the members of his bride their names
[1:14:42] were put in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:14:44] before the foundation of the world but
[1:14:47] it's been sealed up and now it's being
[1:14:50] revealed whose names were in there all
[1:14:53] about it what a great thing
[1:14:55] John when he saw it he said everything
[1:14:58] in heaven everything underneath the
[1:14:59] Earth everything heard him saying amen
[1:15:03] and blessings and honor he just really
[1:15:07] was having a great time for the lamb was
[1:15:10] worthy like some of you did this morning
[1:15:12] in the worship service some of you
[1:15:14] saying amen and praising the Lord just
[1:15:16] having a wonderful time praising the
[1:15:19] lord it's all appropriate it's all in
[1:15:21] your Bible what you going to do when you
[1:15:23] get over there fold your arms be looking
[1:15:27] around no you're going to be praising
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:29] Lord you're going to be saying something
[1:15:32] like thank you
[1:15:33] Jesus Lord I appreciate
[1:15:37] you
[1:15:39] amen and so this book of redemption is
[1:15:44] the Bible brother random tells us this I
[1:15:46] read these quotes for you a couple times
[1:15:48] here in the past and I think I read them
[1:15:51] last night but I just want to or or
[1:15:52] Sunday night just want to read them
[1:15:54] again for you to show you that the book
[1:15:57] is actually the Bible was planned before
[1:16:03] it even got here on the
[1:16:05] earth now the Bible like this wasn't in
[1:16:09] the format that it was planned and
[1:16:12] written in because this didn't exist
[1:16:14] until later on it was
[1:16:17] Scrolls and brother Brandon brings out
[1:16:19] those Scrolls and he says the book
[1:16:21] actually was sealed on the outside with
[1:16:23] Seven Seals this book The Bible sealed
[1:16:27] with Seven Seals and just going to uh
[1:16:30] we'll we'll go a little slow not that I
[1:16:33] have anything more than anyone else but
[1:16:35] I have the quotations of the prophet and
[1:16:37] I'll share those things with you why
[1:16:40] this was so important this book of
[1:16:44] redemption brother vam uses that term
[1:16:47] title deed of
[1:16:49] redemption and so that that's not in
[1:16:51] your Bible that this is what the prophet
[1:16:54] brought to us it's the title deed of
[1:16:56] redemption it's showing the origin of
[1:16:59] man where what Adam lost in the garden
[1:17:03] now I don't know any Theologian and I
[1:17:05] don't know anyone else all we know is in
[1:17:07] the Scriptures it talks about that Adam
[1:17:09] had authority over all of creation he
[1:17:12] named them he was the first he was in
[1:17:16] charge he was the god of the Earth but
[1:17:19] we don't see all the details what that
[1:17:21] Authority means until we come into the
[1:17:24] message brother bham shows us that his
[1:17:27] authority was that he can speak to the
[1:17:29] mountains and actually move the
[1:17:32] mountains he can speak to the trees and
[1:17:34] move a tree like how you move a tree is
[1:17:37] different than Adam moving a
[1:17:40] tree when you move a tree you need a
[1:17:43] shovel and a pick and some good Brothers
[1:17:47] to invite them over to help you move
[1:17:50] some of this dirt we can move them but
[1:17:52] we need help don't we that's not what
[1:17:54] Adam needed Adam had the ability he had
[1:17:57] the control over the migration of the
[1:18:00] fishes and the
[1:18:02] birds he had control over all of nature
[1:18:05] he wasn't not a he wasn't an ignorant
[1:18:07] man he wasn't a low IQ just a dumb knot
[1:18:12] on the on the log he was a very in
[1:18:15] intelligent man he was the first spoken
[1:18:18] word of God God's creation His Highest
[1:18:21] order was a man he went from creation
[1:18:24] from the Lis all the way up to his
[1:18:26] Masterpiece which was
[1:18:28] Adam and whoever Adam was wherever he is
[1:18:32] he's still alive
[1:18:34] somewhere and we going to meet him
[1:18:36] someday those of us that plan on going
[1:18:38] over there oh my think of this man
[1:18:42] Adam and he was the original man and he
[1:18:48] loses this
[1:18:50] Authority because of not of deception
[1:18:54] but he willingly gave up all of his
[1:18:57] rights to the throne through the Earth
[1:19:01] and he gave all those rights of because
[1:19:03] of sin now brother vam continues in the
[1:19:05] message the invisible Union of the bride
[1:19:07] of Christ paragraph 308 he says this
[1:19:10] here there is your name on The Book of
[1:19:13] Life The Book of Life is the word of God
[1:19:17] because the word is God and God is the
[1:19:19] only thing that is life so your name was
[1:19:23] represented in the Bible
[1:19:25] before the Bible become on word
[1:19:29] what who said that what he
[1:19:33] saying look at your neighbor and say
[1:19:35] read it again
[1:19:37] brothers everybody didn't say that
[1:19:39] that's all right we watching
[1:19:41] you paragraph 308 there is your name on
[1:19:45] The Book of Life The Book of Life is the
[1:19:48] word of God cuz the word is God and God
[1:19:53] is the only thing that that is life so
[1:19:56] your name was represented in the Bible
[1:20:00] before the Bible become on word and if
[1:20:04] you're here to do that won't it
[1:20:07] vindicate that
[1:20:09] word beautiful that's right in the
[1:20:13] message works is Faith expressed the
[1:20:16] prophet of God says this in paragraph
[1:20:17] 120 the Baptist believe there's two
[1:20:20] separate books talking about the book of
[1:20:22] life and the Lamb's Book of Life he said
[1:20:24] the B apst believe there's two separate
[1:20:26] books in one way it is two separate
[1:20:29] books and another way it isn't two
[1:20:31] separate books I'm two separate people
[1:20:34] I'm body I'm Soul and Spirit three
[1:20:37] separate people but only one makes me a
[1:20:41] being modern events made clear by
[1:20:44] prophecy
[1:20:46] 1965 the prophet says this now the Bible
[1:20:51] is a different book from any other
[1:20:54] sacred
[1:20:55] book there's no book like the bible let
[1:20:58] me stop here don't you let the devil
[1:21:01] fool you in a
[1:21:03] conversation and try to equate your
[1:21:06] Bible to the Holy
[1:21:08] Quran or any other writing historical
[1:21:11] writing there is no book like the Bible
[1:21:14] we believe that now I I'm not a I'm not
[1:21:17] a uh I'm not a historian to know
[1:21:20] different grammars and what Hebrew is
[1:21:22] and aramic and so forth but by
[1:21:24] revelation God called me to know that
[1:21:27] this book the Bible is what we're all
[1:21:29] resting upon and I will stand in the
[1:21:33] face of anybody smarter than whoever or
[1:21:35] whatever to declare that because the
[1:21:38] truth is what's revealed to you it's not
[1:21:42] so much what you can explain all the
[1:21:44] time and when you stand up for what's
[1:21:47] truth guess who's standing with
[1:21:51] you the author of Truth stand in right
[1:21:55] with you so in any discussion with
[1:21:57] anybody whoever they are wherever
[1:22:00] they're from if you're quoting the
[1:22:03] word you're right where you need to be
[1:22:07] right and there's no need to be ashamed
[1:22:08] of that and I believe we need to raise
[1:22:11] the value of our
[1:22:13] Bibles raise the value of reading it
[1:22:16] opening it up and reading it again and
[1:22:20] the power that is Unleashed when you
[1:22:22] read the good book The Words that are
[1:22:24] there will change your life start right
[1:22:27] there start right there you want to get
[1:22:29] closer to
[1:22:30] God you want God to deal with you start
[1:22:32] with just reading your Bible just do
[1:22:35] that and watch how God begins to bless
[1:22:38] you and anoint you it's a supernatural
[1:22:42] book it looks natural but it's
[1:22:45] supernatural it's powerful when you open
[1:22:48] it up something already begins to happen
[1:22:51] and you begin to read it and quote out
[1:22:53] of there it'll do things for you that
[1:22:55] you don't think or you're not aware of
[1:22:58] what it's doing is that powerful it is
[1:23:01] God in word form that's what it is so
[1:23:05] don't ever be ashamed of God the god of
[1:23:09] Heaven the god of Earth the god of the
[1:23:11] good book don't ever be ashamed of that
[1:23:13] amen amen amen Saints so the prophet
[1:23:17] takes this in now the Bible is a
[1:23:19] different book from any other sacred
[1:23:21] book there's no book like the Bible
[1:23:24] because the Bible is God in word
[1:23:26] form it's a word it's a thought
[1:23:30] expressed God's thinking expressed it
[1:23:33] his words through the prophets they
[1:23:36] wrote the Bible which is in word form
[1:23:39] and Jesus called it a seed and any seed
[1:23:42] will bring forth of its kind if it's in
[1:23:45] the right condition the right atmosphere
[1:23:46] now this book this book of Prophecy it
[1:23:51] is foretelling future events
[1:23:55] now the book contains the entire
[1:23:58] revelation of Jesus Christ you don't add
[1:24:02] to it or take from it right and every
[1:24:07] Revelation must come by
[1:24:10] it can I get how many Saints in here how
[1:24:13] many Bible Believers in here every
[1:24:15] Revelation must come by if it ain't
[1:24:17] coming by the Bible I don't need to hear
[1:24:19] it you don't need to you just tell them
[1:24:22] to keep moving
[1:24:25] you don't add to it or take from it
[1:24:27] every Revelation must come by it see it
[1:24:31] must be the word so we see that this
[1:24:35] book the Bible is the complete
[1:24:39] revelation of Jesus Christ it's the book
[1:24:42] of
[1:24:44] redemption it's the book that holds the
[1:24:47] answers to life we call it the book of
[1:24:51] life it's not only the book of all life
[1:24:54] it's the book of your life in
[1:24:58] specific now you have a relationship in
[1:25:02] this great book it's a book of mystery
[1:25:06] it also is a book of History it's a book
[1:25:09] of his
[1:25:11] story and history it's the book of not
[1:25:14] just everyone's life but your life it it
[1:25:18] gets into those details of your life you
[1:25:21] know like today you know knowing the
[1:25:23] laws of this land you know there's SE
[1:25:26] there's several kind of laws that we
[1:25:27] should know or or we have access to
[1:25:30] through the attorneys and the attorneys
[1:25:32] study the law we don't know all the laws
[1:25:34] we kind of have a good idea about
[1:25:35] certain things but when we really want
[1:25:38] the details you have to hire an attorney
[1:25:40] you know attorney for real estate law
[1:25:43] attorney for criminal law an attorney
[1:25:46] for all kinds of laws that are there and
[1:25:48] those laws are written in Book for all
[1:25:50] of us the average human being probably
[1:25:54] don't know all the rights afforded to
[1:25:56] them until they talk to an attorney
[1:25:59] right is this right or is this wrong
[1:26:01] well I don't know talk to an attorney
[1:26:03] and then the attorney you're not going
[1:26:05] to do it for free now the attorney will
[1:26:08] counsel you on which direction you
[1:26:11] should take is that right and that's you
[1:26:14] know he's not making up the law he's
[1:26:16] just telling you the law that's in there
[1:26:18] and so um the good book The Bible has
[1:26:22] been sealed with Seven Seals and God has
[1:26:25] sent prophets Through the Ages to reveal
[1:26:28] the details of this tremendous book The
[1:26:33] Bible it's a lifetime there there is no
[1:26:36] student that can study it through all
[1:26:39] the way and be done studying it doesn't
[1:26:41] exist like I'm done studying The Book of
[1:26:44] Revelation so let me move on to my next
[1:26:46] no it doesn't work that way it's a
[1:26:48] lifetime study because it's a it's the
[1:26:51] book of life itself and all of the
[1:26:54] changes that happen it actually has the
[1:26:57] answers for
[1:26:59] politics it has the answers for what's
[1:27:01] going on in the future and in the past
[1:27:05] all of the issues of Life why people why
[1:27:08] people have lost their mind out here in
[1:27:10] society the Bible has the answer to that
[1:27:13] where are we going when we the Bible has
[1:27:15] the answer to that why are some people
[1:27:18] like this and some people the Bible has
[1:27:20] the answer to why do people suffer why
[1:27:23] is there pain pain in the earth why is
[1:27:25] there evil why is there good the Bible
[1:27:30] has the answer because it is The Book of
[1:27:34] Life amen and the prophet
[1:27:38] brings the revelation of what Adam lost
[1:27:41] in the garden to us so
[1:27:46] profoundly what he lost in the garden is
[1:27:49] he lost his
[1:27:52] inheritance he lost the idal deed he
[1:27:55] lost that power and the authority over
[1:27:58] the animal creation where he had a
[1:28:01] relationship with them the lion and all
[1:28:04] the other animals now they're afraid of
[1:28:06] him after the fall what happened so he
[1:28:11] loses this his inheritance and the the
[1:28:15] losing of this inheritance is what we
[1:28:18] want to talk about just for a few
[1:28:19] moments here he loses this
[1:28:23] Authority
[1:28:24] now hopefully by God's grace we will
[1:28:29] come back to what Adam
[1:28:32] lost uh as a Son of God we're being
[1:28:36] redeemed redeemed means you were here
[1:28:40] you were lost and now you're coming back
[1:28:42] to where you were
[1:28:44] before talking about Mankind so we start
[1:28:47] by the first man Adam I know the Jehovah
[1:28:50] Witnesses don't believe that Adam will
[1:28:51] be saved they believe he's eternally
[1:28:53] lost L they don't believe in hell but he
[1:28:56] won't be there on the other side that's
[1:28:57] what many of them believe I believe
[1:29:00] that's what their teaching is but we
[1:29:02] know that Adam was not deceived he was
[1:29:05] playing the role of Christ to Eve his
[1:29:09] bride when he saw the sin take place he
[1:29:12] took on the role of a kinsman
[1:29:16] redeemer and so what he did was he could
[1:29:19] have left her stranded out there and
[1:29:21] been like well Lord I got you know
[1:29:24] several other ribs can you give me a
[1:29:26] different one now you know she was
[1:29:28] blonde give me one that's redhead or or
[1:29:31] something like that give me somebody
[1:29:33] else Lord she she don't you know could
[1:29:36] but he loved her she was part of him and
[1:29:38] I'm teasing I'm a little joking but why
[1:29:40] didn't he just do that because she was a
[1:29:43] part of him so she's all messed up and
[1:29:46] here he is he's all in the clear and she
[1:29:48] tells him she tells him what her and the
[1:29:51] serpent did and how her eyes are old
[1:29:54] open and it was a great thing and so
[1:29:56] forth and he knew exactly what he was
[1:29:59] doing when he leaves all of this beauty
[1:30:02] that's right and comes down into
[1:30:05] humanity and get ugly sticky and this
[1:30:08] carnal Nation nature comes all over him
[1:30:12] when he partakes of this
[1:30:14] fruit did it
[1:30:16] deliberately he's a real
[1:30:19] man that's a beautiful thing that he did
[1:30:22] looks horrible when the book opens up to
[1:30:24] you you'll see that was a beautiful
[1:30:26] thing what Adam did we might see him do
[1:30:29] it again actually we will see him do it
[1:30:32] again but he won't be the first Adam
[1:30:34] he'll be the second Adam doing exactly
[1:30:37] the same thing to buy back the human
[1:30:42] race and all of
[1:30:45] humanity so what did Adam lose he loses
[1:30:48] this his inheritance now when Adam sin
[1:30:52] paragraph 99 in the breach between the
[1:30:55] seven Church ages brother brandom says
[1:30:57] when Adam sinned by heeding his wife's
[1:31:00] reasoning instead of holding on to God's
[1:31:02] word that's what made Adam sin his wife
[1:31:06] reason with Satan and then produced the
[1:31:09] product to Adam and Adam turned loose
[1:31:11] the word and sold out he lost also his
[1:31:16] inheritance when he lost his Fellowship
[1:31:18] in right to life remember the day you
[1:31:21] eat thereof that day you die and when he
[1:31:24] lost his life he also lost his
[1:31:26] inheritance in life because he had
[1:31:29] completely Supreme control of the earth
[1:31:33] he was a god of the earth God is the god
[1:31:36] of the universe everywhere but his son
[1:31:39] had this Earth under his own control he
[1:31:43] could speak he could name he could say
[1:31:46] he could stop nature he can do anything
[1:31:49] he wanted to see but when he did that he
[1:31:52] lost his inher
[1:31:55] itan Adam could say let this mountain
[1:31:58] here be moved over there and it would do
[1:32:01] it Adam could say let this tree be
[1:32:03] plucked up and planted over here it
[1:32:05] would do it see for he had complete
[1:32:09] Supreme control as a minor God under God
[1:32:13] our father because he was a Son of God
[1:32:16] now couldn't we stop here just a minute
[1:32:18] and get a real sermon amen yes we could
[1:32:22] actually then if the blood is cleansed
[1:32:25] it back what about now see look what the
[1:32:29] Son of God the second Adam did the works
[1:32:33] that I do shall you do also Adam lost
[1:32:36] his inheritance the earth now it passed
[1:32:40] from his hand to the one he sold out to
[1:32:44] Satan he sold his faith out into God
[1:32:48] from God to Satan's reasoning therefore
[1:32:51] his eternal life his right to the Tree
[1:32:53] of Life his right to the Earth belonged
[1:32:55] to him and he forfeited every bit to the
[1:32:58] hands of Satan he passed it from his
[1:33:01] hand to Satan therefore now it has been
[1:33:05] returned and has been polluted and the
[1:33:07] seed of Adam has destroyed the
[1:33:09] inheritance that Adam should have had
[1:33:12] and that's the Earth that's right so
[1:33:15] brother vom here is showing us that from
[1:33:19] Adam's hands it goes to Satan's hands
[1:33:22] and then Satan's hands he now has
[1:33:25] control over the earth now if you go
[1:33:28] further into the message you'll see that
[1:33:30] brother bam tells us that Satan's dirty
[1:33:33] hands could not hold this book but he
[1:33:36] still has certain rights upon the Earth
[1:33:39] and he's in the form of a squatter now
[1:33:42] so the Earth has been redeemed by Christ
[1:33:45] it's back into the hands of the original
[1:33:48] owner and for thousands of years the
[1:33:51] Bible now God has sent prophet phets and
[1:33:54] those prophets lives in writing became
[1:33:57] the word of God which is already
[1:33:59] predestinated and written in heaven but
[1:34:01] it had to be a manifestation on the
[1:34:03] earth so Moses comes on the scene
[1:34:06] Abraham all of the prophets we have the
[1:34:08] Exodus we have all of the happenings and
[1:34:12] the wars and the history and all of this
[1:34:14] is taking place under the under um God
[1:34:18] bringing Redemption back to the hands of
[1:34:21] man so now now we see in part what the
[1:34:26] book of redemption is to those that
[1:34:30] receive it it is life to them it starts
[1:34:33] a Reformation in their life but yet
[1:34:37] there's still a promise that this book
[1:34:39] needs to get back into the hands of
[1:34:43] mankind so this is uh Revelations
[1:34:46] chapter 5 this is the scene that we're
[1:34:49] seeing when John sees this vision and
[1:34:52] there's on the Throne God in his right
[1:34:55] hand a book and the angel proclaims who
[1:34:59] is worthy to take the book now brother
[1:35:03] Bram goes further and he takes what this
[1:35:08] Worthy is this what what um what this
[1:35:13] scene was it was a vision and
[1:35:16] that all of the host of all the prophets
[1:35:20] that went on before were there but none
[1:35:23] of them were worthy because they were
[1:35:25] all born under a sexual birth which was
[1:35:28] the original sin this is why Jesus had
[1:35:31] to be born of a virgin so when he's
[1:35:34] proclaiming who is worthy no one was
[1:35:36] found worthy no man couldn't be an angel
[1:35:39] couldn't be a created being it had to be
[1:35:41] a man and no man that was on the earth
[1:35:45] came on the earth except with a sexual
[1:35:48] desire outside of Adam and our lord
[1:35:51] Jesus those were the two men Adam didn't
[1:35:54] come by sexual birth it was a spoken
[1:35:56] word and so here now the angel is
[1:35:59] calling for who is worthy to take the
[1:36:01] book now when John sees this great scene
[1:36:05] there is no answer for him there is no
[1:36:09] man that is worthy to take the book now
[1:36:12] just to to clarify a little bit about
[1:36:15] this what Worthy is this this word
[1:36:18] worthy comes from the word
[1:36:20] worth and um the word worthy means
[1:36:26] deserving such as merits having Worth or
[1:36:32] Excellence equivalent with of before the
[1:36:36] thing deserved so it's the equivalent is
[1:36:40] having the worth that's equivalent to
[1:36:42] the thing that's deserved so and it
[1:36:46] comes from the word worth and that word
[1:36:48] worth we talk about worthy no man was
[1:36:50] worthy that word worth means value you
[1:36:53] take the word down it's a Latin root
[1:36:57] virtuous from the root Viro which primar
[1:37:02] it it means strength this word worth
[1:37:05] means strength it also means importance
[1:37:08] and another nice definition from the the
[1:37:11] older uh uh definitions in the uh the
[1:37:15] Webster's uh uh dictionary diary that I
[1:37:18] like it is the quality that renders a
[1:37:21] thing useful or which will produce an
[1:37:25] equivalent good in some other thing it's
[1:37:28] the quality that renders a thing useful
[1:37:32] or which will produce an equivalent good
[1:37:36] and some other things so it wasn't that
[1:37:38] there wasn't worthy people there but
[1:37:41] there there was there was no one worthy
[1:37:44] to take this book because this is the
[1:37:47] book of all of redemption The Complete
[1:37:51] Book of redemption now who was there was
[1:37:54] also Noah Daniel and Jo and I'll bring
[1:37:57] this out just for a moment in Ezekiel
[1:37:59] chapter 14 if you could turn there
[1:38:01] quickly we'll look at these this you
[1:38:05] know maybe we won't waste time there of
[1:38:08] course we're not wasting any time
[1:38:10] reading the Bible but I let us turn
[1:38:14] there quickly all right this always
[1:38:17] stood with me one year I was going
[1:38:19] through the Bible and I
[1:38:20] remember
[1:38:22] this
[1:38:24] Ezekiel chapter 14 I can't take time to
[1:38:27] find it maybe they have it for me or
[1:38:29] somebody have it read it for me Ezekiel
[1:38:32] Chapter 14 verse number 14 what does it
[1:38:35] say you have it Levi oh they have it
[1:38:38] here thank
[1:38:39] you though these three men Noah Daniel
[1:38:42] and job were in it they should deliver
[1:38:44] but their own Souls but their
[1:38:48] righteousness by by their righteousness
[1:38:50] sayith the Lord now if you take the full
[1:38:52] context it goes down in all the way to
[1:38:55] verse 20 if you take the full context
[1:38:57] the Lord is talking about a people or a
[1:38:59] city that have sinned and their sin is
[1:39:02] so great that even if and the Lord names
[1:39:06] these three now this is in the Book of
[1:39:07] Ezekiel but he names Noah Daniel and Joe
[1:39:12] and showing you that these are some
[1:39:14] pretty worthy gentlemen Noah found Grace
[1:39:18] in the eyes of the Lord who was more
[1:39:20] righteous than job Jesus spoke of him
[1:39:22] and Danel
[1:39:23] the Lord he was man well thought of and
[1:39:26] beloved and here the Lord now through
[1:39:29] Ezekiel is talking to Israel he says
[1:39:31] he's talking about the sin is so great
[1:39:33] on the land that three if these three
[1:39:35] men were living in the city it still
[1:39:38] wouldn't save the city they would only
[1:39:40] save their own life and it even goes
[1:39:42] down it says they wouldn't even save
[1:39:44] their children's life this is how bad
[1:39:47] sin is but to show you the worthiness of
[1:39:51] some of the Bible characters so when we
[1:39:53] when we think of this that no man was
[1:39:54] found worthy it's not that that they
[1:39:56] didn't have any worth not that there was
[1:39:59] no worthy people there but who was able
[1:40:03] to take this book of
[1:40:06] redemption who was able to claim the uh
[1:40:09] to bring back salvation to the
[1:40:12] Lost no man was
[1:40:16] worthy no man so this broke John up it
[1:40:21] caused him to
[1:40:22] weep to cause him to cry and in his
[1:40:25] weeping the angel told him don't weep
[1:40:29] John don't don't don't weep because the
[1:40:33] the the the lamb has prevailed the lion
[1:40:35] has
[1:40:36] prevailed there there's a battle that
[1:40:39] took place and the lamb has prevailed
[1:40:42] Hallelujah and the lamb is
[1:40:45] worthy oh my oh he'll turn your Sorrows
[1:40:49] into gladness and he turned job he turn
[1:40:53] turned John sorrow into gladness when he
[1:40:56] found out that he no man was worthy but
[1:40:59] don't weep there is a lamb that's worthy
[1:41:02] and when he turns and look to see this
[1:41:04] lamb a lion comes forth and this lamb
[1:41:08] was
[1:41:09] bloody and he was able to take the book
[1:41:13] this is the value of
[1:41:17] Calvary I don't care how revelated you
[1:41:19] get you'll never get more revelated than
[1:41:22] the cross mess message the preaching of
[1:41:25] the Cross Jesus died for you my brother
[1:41:29] my sister you're here today because of
[1:41:32] the Cross somebody paid the price so
[1:41:35] that you can even say Amen you couldn't
[1:41:38] even pick up your Bible but somebody
[1:41:40] made a way for you to pick up your Bible
[1:41:43] made it available to you to
[1:41:46] read and he alone was
[1:41:50] worthy he's the only one that's worthy
[1:41:52] of Our Praise he's the only one that we'
[1:41:55] ever Bow Down and
[1:41:57] Worship as lovely as we love our
[1:42:00] prophets how many love your prophets in
[1:42:03] the bible you love them all of them we
[1:42:06] love them people of God but there's
[1:42:08] nobody we love like the Lord Jesus
[1:42:12] Christ there's nobody like the Lord
[1:42:16] Jesus Christ that's worthy of our
[1:42:20] praise our lifegiving and our worship
[1:42:23] ship yes that's what our ministry is all
[1:42:26] about
[1:42:28] amen and so
[1:42:30] this lamb now takes the
[1:42:34] book and
[1:42:36] redeems through the cross there's a
[1:42:39] Redemption that's the price that's
[1:42:41] paid is his own
[1:42:45] blood
[1:42:46] now so there is a law to this why after
[1:42:51] all the years throughout the ages there
[1:42:54] was no man that was found worthy because
[1:42:58] in the levitical
[1:43:01] laws Leviticus 25 I believe and 26 right
[1:43:05] in there there are
[1:43:07] laws and then these laws were expressed
[1:43:11] in the Book of Ruth how many remember
[1:43:13] Ruth's
[1:43:14] story remember Ruth's story Ruth was
[1:43:18] married into the Commonwealth of Israel
[1:43:21] she married a man who had a brother and
[1:43:25] he was married and she had a
[1:43:27] father-in-law and a mother-in-law and
[1:43:29] they're all living and they're living
[1:43:31] outside of Israel sickness strikes the
[1:43:34] home and the her father-in-law dies then
[1:43:39] her brother-in-law dies and then her
[1:43:41] husband dies so you're left with these
[1:43:43] three women Oprah Ruth and who was the
[1:43:47] third
[1:43:47] one huh are you
[1:43:51] sure amen thank you you Naomi these
[1:43:55] three sisters three
[1:43:57] women major change in their life now
[1:44:01] it's a major change how we going to go
[1:44:02] forward how we going to move forward so
[1:44:04] Naomi somehow gets it in her spirit that
[1:44:07] she needs to go back
[1:44:09] home
[1:44:11] beautiful you know the Lord will will
[1:44:13] put opportunities or allow things to
[1:44:16] happen in your life to turn your
[1:44:20] direction where you need to go has done
[1:44:23] that for you before Oh yes and sometimes
[1:44:26] it's not convenient it's not cute it's
[1:44:29] not even worth talking about it's you're
[1:44:32] just glad to be where you are today I'm
[1:44:35] so glad to be where I'm at I I don't
[1:44:37] need to tell you every place that I've
[1:44:39] been right right but I'm here today by
[1:44:43] his grace and when you think about where
[1:44:46] you come from my goodness what have
[1:44:50] Grace never found you what have you
[1:44:52] still still stuck out there in your mess
[1:44:55] stuck out there in your ideas and in
[1:44:57] your plan but Grace Finds you and puts
[1:45:00] you in a oh my a place where there's
[1:45:04] hope there's a future a place where you
[1:45:07] have a plan for your life
[1:45:11] amen and this is these three girls here
[1:45:13] these three and so the opportunity
[1:45:15] arises and Naomi's got to leave so Oprah
[1:45:18] makes a decision to go back Ruth makes a
[1:45:22] decision we don't fully know
[1:45:24] why she has she's not a
[1:45:27] Hebrew but she makes a decision to
[1:45:29] attach herself to
[1:45:31] Naomi and she attached herself to Naomi
[1:45:34] in such a way that you know Naomi says
[1:45:37] you know what I have nothing to offer
[1:45:38] you I'm broke I have no kids I have
[1:45:41] nothing to offer you go back and start
[1:45:43] your life over again Oprah did it you
[1:45:45] can do it know and Ruth says no I'm not
[1:45:47] gonna leave
[1:45:48] you listen listen young lady you're
[1:45:50] still a young girl you can Remar you can
[1:45:52] start over go back and and Ruth sets it
[1:45:54] straight she says look where you go I'm
[1:45:57] going to go your God will be my God I'm
[1:46:00] going to praise and worship like you
[1:46:02] where they bury you that's where they
[1:46:04] going to bury me you know when somebody
[1:46:07] tells you that that's a beautiful you
[1:46:09] know they're going to be with you that
[1:46:12] you know get our burial plots next to
[1:46:15] one
[1:46:16] another because when you die and they
[1:46:18] bury you that's where they going to bury
[1:46:20] me no options who what if another offer
[1:46:24] there'll be no other offer I'm with you
[1:46:27] so she attaches herself to Naomi brother
[1:46:30] brandham said by faith now I want you to
[1:46:34] notice that this is The Book of Life the
[1:46:38] book of Ruth's life being revealed to
[1:46:42] her now she makes this decision by faith
[1:46:45] she attaches herself to somebody who's
[1:46:48] broke and have nothing to offer she only
[1:46:51] did it by faith there was no future
[1:46:53] prize there was no she was just
[1:46:56] faithful she made a decision by faith
[1:47:00] and she was faithful to her
[1:47:03] mother-in-law and it really paid out for
[1:47:06] for her didn't it is that right so they
[1:47:09] go back we know the story The Ruth and
[1:47:12] Redemption they find a field she's
[1:47:14] gleaning in that field and after
[1:47:16] gleaning so many years she finds favor
[1:47:19] with the owner of the field she's being
[1:47:22] watched and don't know she's being
[1:47:23] watched she's being protected and cared
[1:47:26] for it don't know she's being protected
[1:47:28] and cared for but things just seems to
[1:47:30] be falling her way maybe she's lucky
[1:47:34] maybe she won the
[1:47:36] lottery maybe she was going to win a
[1:47:38] prize you know no prizes here there is
[1:47:41] no luck here it's called Providence it's
[1:47:44] called
[1:47:46] predestination it's called This is what
[1:47:48] was supposed to take place and she's in
[1:47:50] boaz's field what you doing in this
[1:47:52] field of all the fields you guys pick
[1:47:54] why you pick this field I don't know and
[1:47:57] you're just there and the Lord begins to
[1:47:59] bless you in that field little handful
[1:48:03] she's working hard every day and she
[1:48:05] gets a handful every now and then she
[1:48:08] like woo man I'm lucky today no that was
[1:48:12] by design for Boaz went to the Reapers
[1:48:15] and said don't bother her don't mess
[1:48:17] with her and if there's anything left
[1:48:19] over leave some on purpose while she's
[1:48:22] Gathering
[1:48:24] it is that the god that we serve you
[1:48:27] know he knows who you
[1:48:29] are he knows what you're going through
[1:48:32] Hallelujah he knows the sacrifices that
[1:48:35] you are making and there's no sacrifice
[1:48:38] that you can make that our Lord does not
[1:48:41] see that
[1:48:42] sacrifice so he's watching after Ruth
[1:48:45] now the prophet of God deals with this
[1:48:48] and I tie this into the book of
[1:48:49] redemption because he does in the um in
[1:48:53] the in the seven sealed message he says
[1:48:56] this
[1:48:58] here I can get it for you here in just a
[1:49:02] moment
[1:49:06] yes the Revelations chapter 5 part
[1:49:21] one for I read that 2 Timothy 2:19
[1:49:24] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:49:27] standing sure having this seal the Lord
[1:49:31] knoweth them that are
[1:49:33] his how many thank God that the Lord
[1:49:36] knows
[1:49:37] you Ruth making her decision a type of
[1:49:40] the church the the Gentile Church she
[1:49:43] decided and crossed over into the land
[1:49:45] not a lot of times we methodists and
[1:49:47] Baptists we think that's all you have to
[1:49:49] do she had just got started she hadn't
[1:49:53] got nowhere yet she just got over into
[1:49:55] the land now the next thing she had to
[1:49:57] do she had to work she become a legalist
[1:50:00] she had to work out her own salvation
[1:50:01] with fear and triing like you did she
[1:50:04] went out out into the field and put her
[1:50:07] clothes upon her she went out into the
[1:50:09] field and gleaned behind the maidens in
[1:50:11] order to get sustaining food for the day
[1:50:14] is that right what was she doing she was
[1:50:16] trying to find favor with Boaz so she
[1:50:20] worked her way through the stage of
[1:50:22] legalism
[1:50:23] and that's exactly what the church did
[1:50:25] the lutherans believed it by faith
[1:50:28] coming to the land but the Methodist
[1:50:30] taught
[1:50:31] sanctification which was the legalistic
[1:50:34] standpoint of it you got to do something
[1:50:38] I got to quit I've I got to let my hair
[1:50:40] grow out said the women of course they
[1:50:43] don't do it no more but they they did do
[1:50:45] it let the hair grow out they had to
[1:50:47] quit wearing the pants and paints in
[1:50:50] their faces they didn't wear their
[1:50:52] skirts wrong and short like others did
[1:50:54] they had to do something see that's what
[1:50:56] she did the state of justification the
[1:50:59] state of sanctification now when finally
[1:51:02] she found favor with Boaz what happened
[1:51:05] then Naomi told her you wait here while
[1:51:08] Boaz does the work of a kinsman redeemer
[1:51:11] cuz he's the only one that can do it
[1:51:14] he's our next of kin Ken Redeemer and
[1:51:18] you just wait here don't go in the
[1:51:19] fields no more don't do this that or the
[1:51:22] other you just wait until the kinsman
[1:51:23] redeemer has fulfilled and she rested
[1:51:27] that's exactly what the church has come
[1:51:30] to in this last stage of Pentecost in
[1:51:33] the beginning of Pentecost they all
[1:51:35] worked up and they had to do this they
[1:51:37] shook them and everything else now what
[1:51:40] now what is the church doing the true
[1:51:43] church is just resting what is rest here
[1:51:46] it is rest is the Holy Spirit the
[1:51:50] Sabbath day the Seventh Day Advent is
[1:51:52] wanted to tell us you know about being
[1:51:54] the seventh day Sabbath or something
[1:51:56] like that in Hebrews the 4th chapter we
[1:52:00] which have entered into his rest has
[1:52:02] ceased from our works as God did from
[1:52:04] his so the Sabbath is the
[1:52:07] rest and when Ruth was resting it was a
[1:52:10] type of the church resting in the
[1:52:13] promises of God we have the earnest now
[1:52:16] of our Salvation we're not worried
[1:52:18] whether we're going over there or not
[1:52:19] we're going that's right God said so God
[1:52:23] promised it and we've got the
[1:52:25] earnest done been received Christ has
[1:52:28] accepted us no way to get away from it
[1:52:32] now we're there amen all we have to do
[1:52:34] is just wait until he's done doing the
[1:52:38] kinsman redeemer we have the earnest of
[1:52:40] it right now waiting for the time that
[1:52:43] when he comes back and then what next
[1:52:47] thing Ruth was Ruth was rewarded now
[1:52:50] look at this paragraph 117 that's what
[1:52:53] the church did it entered into
[1:52:55] justification under Luther it went into
[1:52:58] sanctification under Wesley went into
[1:53:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:53:02] last days and now resting with the
[1:53:05] earnest of our inheritance that we know
[1:53:07] that something happened in us we've
[1:53:09] passed from Death unto life and waiting
[1:53:13] groaning with nature for the time when
[1:53:16] we will receive im an immortal life and
[1:53:19] Immortal fullness our bodies will be
[1:53:22] redeemed
[1:53:23] everything redeemed we're just waiting
[1:53:25] for him to return back from the gate
[1:53:27] amen then what Ruth was
[1:53:31] rewarded that's when we'll be rewarded
[1:53:34] that's what this seven sealed book is
[1:53:37] going to open up to us what is these
[1:53:41] things they're Mysteries they're not
[1:53:44] wrote in the word they have to be
[1:53:46] revealed by the Holy Spirit but if
[1:53:49] you'll notice actually they are revealed
[1:53:52] all down through the scriptures but
[1:53:55] they've been hid from the people when we
[1:53:58] get to the role after a while you'll see
[1:54:01] how it was fixed then you'll know just
[1:54:04] how them things open up so here Ruth's
[1:54:07] life typed out what the church is going
[1:54:10] through it looks hidden it looks like
[1:54:12] just a story of a this little girl a
[1:54:15] story of redemption in her own life but
[1:54:18] it's really your story too it was
[1:54:21] written and then it's Rewritten again
[1:54:23] and then it plays over again and then it
[1:54:25] plays over again you see this taking of
[1:54:28] the book the opening of the book and the
[1:54:31] revealing of the book happened in these
[1:54:34] lives now Ruth received this great
[1:54:38] reward by the decisions that she made
[1:54:42] look at Ruth Ruth started out poor and
[1:54:44] broke with her mother-in-law and she
[1:54:46] ended up owning the field that she used
[1:54:49] to work in she ended up being owner of
[1:54:53] the field that she was scrapping for her
[1:54:56] life in it was hard for her do you think
[1:54:59] God knew that she was going to end up
[1:55:01] owning that she's there counting how
[1:55:04] many measures she's getting or had a
[1:55:06] good day today she's counting where
[1:55:08] she's going to G how she going to glean
[1:55:09] she's going back to her mother-in-law
[1:55:11] counting up all these and she was
[1:55:13] gleaning in the field sweating working
[1:55:15] it out you're the owner
[1:55:18] Ruth she didn't know she was the owner
[1:55:20] and that's that's the way this the book
[1:55:23] unfolds to her and that's when you know
[1:55:25] your rightful position in Christ now
[1:55:28] what's another Old Testament example of
[1:55:31] This Book of redemption it's the Jubilee
[1:55:33] year and brother randam brings that in
[1:55:36] the same message as well Revelations
[1:55:39] chapter 5 and he brings in this law in
[1:55:43] Leviticus when it comes to a Hebrew
[1:55:46] slave or even coming to your land there
[1:55:49] were
[1:55:50] laws so when the Book of Ruth was
[1:55:53] written to
[1:55:56] Israel in order for Boaz to catch Ruth
[1:55:59] as his bride he had to be a near Kinsman
[1:56:03] this was a law this is an Old Testament
[1:56:05] law and this law was established by God
[1:56:10] and this is the beauty of the god that
[1:56:11] we serve he's a leader and he leads by
[1:56:14] example he creates a law and then he
[1:56:18] gets under and subjects himself under
[1:56:20] his own law so he does doesn't break the
[1:56:23] rules because it's him he created the
[1:56:26] law and then he has to live by the laws
[1:56:29] that he created and this is why the the
[1:56:32] role of redemption had to be a virgin
[1:56:35] born a son of Adam that knew that was
[1:56:39] not purchased that was not that did not
[1:56:42] come here by sexual birth so he had he
[1:56:45] couldn't send an angel he couldn't send
[1:56:48] someone else he had to do it himself
[1:56:50] he's the only one that could do do it so
[1:56:53] he came in the life of a virgin and in
[1:56:56] the the office of his son the Lord Jesus
[1:56:59] Christ to pay the price of redemption
[1:57:02] why is he going through all of this
[1:57:04] because he made that law and that law he
[1:57:07] subjects himself to that very same law
[1:57:10] aren't you glad about that you know in
[1:57:13] the beginning when he spoke his word
[1:57:15] brother brandom says he spoke the word
[1:57:16] then he had to believe his own word just
[1:57:19] like you have to believe his own word
[1:57:22] amen and so the rules don't change even
[1:57:26] for God he's too righteous he's too holy
[1:57:30] he's establishes a requirement and then
[1:57:33] he subjects himself to those same
[1:57:36] requirements beautiful isn't it so
[1:57:40] that's what he does in the life of when
[1:57:42] he came robed in flesh as a the Lord
[1:57:45] Jesus Christ he's now the the Virgin
[1:57:47] born son of God and he's going to play
[1:57:50] the role of a kins a redeemer book of Ru
[1:57:53] calls him a goel he must be
[1:57:56] willing he must be
[1:57:58] able and he must be of a near kin it
[1:58:02] couldn't just be someone else he had to
[1:58:03] be the nearest kin and this is what Boaz
[1:58:06] was so Boaz wanted to marry Ruth but in
[1:58:11] order to get Ruth he had to marry Naomi
[1:58:14] and so he goes after Naomi redeems Naomi
[1:58:19] and Naomi was attached to Ruth or Ruth
[1:58:22] was attached to Naomi so look at all the
[1:58:25] wealth that Ruth gets for her simple
[1:58:28] decision back in another country to
[1:58:31] attach herself to something that looked
[1:58:32] like it wasn't going nowhere but she did
[1:58:34] it by faith and God rewarded her
[1:58:39] mightily same thing with you today so
[1:58:41] the Jubilee can I take 10 more minutes
[1:58:43] before we close are everybody got enough
[1:58:46] water everybody done going to the
[1:58:48] bathroom all right God bless you so this
[1:58:52] Jubilee is also a Act of
[1:58:56] redemption this is when a Hebrew has
[1:59:00] lost what belonged to him now let's take
[1:59:03] it in Leviticus chap 25 vers number8
[1:59:21] quickly
[1:59:23] Thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[1:59:25] years unto thee seven times seven years
[1:59:29] in the space of seven sabbaths of years
[1:59:32] shall be unto thee 4 and9 years so this
[1:59:35] is that 50e of rest that the land should
[1:59:39] get and also there were the the smaller
[1:59:42] jubilees after six years the seventh
[1:59:45] year was a year Jubilee this is that
[1:59:47] this is the the the the law for the land
[1:59:50] and for the servants that they can go
[1:59:52] free after 50 years verse number 12 for
[1:59:54] it is the Jubilee it shall be holy unto
[1:59:57] you you shall eat the increase thereof
[2:00:00] out of the field in the year of this
[2:00:03] Jubilee you shall return every man unto
[2:00:07] his
[2:00:09] possession now you had
[2:00:12] something you lost something and you're
[2:00:16] living in slavery now the Jubilee year
[2:00:20] has come it is sounded now you can go
[2:00:24] back to what you lost you shall return
[2:00:28] every man unto his possession well as a
[2:00:31] man what did we
[2:00:33] lose as sons of Adam what did we lose we
[2:00:37] lost that original Authority that Adam
[2:00:42] had the faith that he had the knowing
[2:00:45] the authority that he
[2:00:48] have he didn't speak into creation as
[2:00:51] far as I can see but he had the
[2:00:53] authority over with the spoken word to
[2:00:56] move things and move things and move
[2:00:57] things and we can see that Moses uses
[2:01:00] this spoken word Authority when he's
[2:01:03] delivering Israel out of Pharaoh's hand
[2:01:06] and then we see the spoken word
[2:01:07] Authority given of creation given to our
[2:01:10] lord Jesus in this spoken word when he
[2:01:14] has control over the winds and waves and
[2:01:17] so forth and then now we see it again
[2:01:20] under the ministry of the seventh angel
[2:01:23] now the Bible has been sealed with seven
[2:01:27] mysterious seals and that's the complete
[2:01:30] Revelation the complete understanding of
[2:01:33] the full counsel of God so this book The
[2:01:36] Bible Through the Ages it's a savior
[2:01:39] it's not fully revealed or known or
[2:01:41] wouldn't be known until the seventh
[2:01:44] angel comes and he reveals the Mysteries
[2:01:47] that are in the book those seals had to
[2:01:50] be loosed off of the Bible we said
[2:01:53] brother Israel he you know one of the
[2:01:55] revelations that he loose was no eternal
[2:01:58] hell he talked about how that uh one of
[2:02:01] the other things was uh the serpent seed
[2:02:03] that was another mystery to be revealed
[2:02:05] and the um the order of the church and
[2:02:08] what the iniquity of of uh the the uh
[2:02:11] the Antichrist spirit and how that was
[2:02:14] to be revealed he preached that in in
[2:02:16] earlier years the mystery of marriage
[2:02:19] and divorce all those things those
[2:02:21] Mysteries were given to him and you say
[2:02:23] well Brothers well he he only preached
[2:02:25] the seven seal message in 1963 and he
[2:02:28] was already preaching the revelation of
[2:02:30] the of the the godhead and the
[2:02:33] revelation of the serpent seed in
[2:02:35] earlier years well it's because that
[2:02:37] those Mysteries belong to the ministry
[2:02:40] of the seventh angel now whether they
[2:02:42] came out in this series is the seven
[2:02:44] seal series a few years before many
[2:02:47] years after those Mysteries belong to
[2:02:50] the seventh angel
[2:02:52] he doesn't become the seventh angel when
[2:02:54] he starts to preach this series he was
[2:02:56] already the seventh angel and the M the
[2:02:59] mysteries of God should be finished
[2:03:02] Revelations 10:7 so in Revelations
[2:03:05] chapter 5 the book is closed no man is
[2:03:07] found worthy in Revelations 10 there's
[2:03:10] an open book now and so what is this
[2:03:14] that's this message that has been opened
[2:03:16] up in this last day the Mysteries that
[2:03:20] have been revealed in our last
[2:03:23] day and so brother branam when he goes
[2:03:26] through his seven seal uh uh h h a set
[2:03:31] of sermons remember what he said about
[2:03:33] his Bible he said his Bible became a new
[2:03:36] book right now it wasn't a new book as
[2:03:39] far as new information but it is now
[2:03:41] revealed to him greater mysteries of who
[2:03:45] the seventh that that constellation that
[2:03:48] happened to him that constellation and
[2:03:50] all of his life
[2:03:52] Mysteries like the thing I wondered
[2:03:55] about my whole life so as he's coming to
[2:03:58] a revelation of who Jesus is he's
[2:04:01] actually coming to a revelation of who
[2:04:03] he
[2:04:03] is where does he fit in the Plan of
[2:04:07] Redemption and that's what the book of
[2:04:09] the Bible will do to you too it's not
[2:04:12] just Bible stories of Moses and Noah and
[2:04:15] John the Baptist it's the story of your
[2:04:19] life it answers the mystery of your life
[2:04:24] it brings into Clarity who you are and
[2:04:28] this great purpose in the Plan of
[2:04:31] Redemption so when this Jubilee year
[2:04:35] would sound after 50 years everything
[2:04:38] you lost you can go back and you're free
[2:04:41] now to go get those things that you lost
[2:04:44] aren't you glad about that think about
[2:04:45] that just for a moment every 50
[2:04:49] years this don't happen too many times
[2:04:52] to an
[2:04:53] individual I don't know how many times
[2:04:54] you can be
[2:04:57] 50 after 50 years and you say well I'll
[2:05:01] catch up on it on the next 50 years you
[2:05:03] probably won't be
[2:05:04] here it's like a once in a lifetime
[2:05:09] event the sounding of this
[2:05:12] word and when you hear it it will have
[2:05:15] an effect upon your life when you hear
[2:05:19] it that's the sound that you can go free
[2:05:21] yesen now it's just a book to other
[2:05:25] people it's just a book to you but when
[2:05:28] it's picked up in
[2:05:31] red is open up to you
[2:05:34] now the mystery of who you are now opens
[2:05:38] up and where does the Plan of Redemption
[2:05:41] lay it lays in you so first we know what
[2:05:44] Adam lost and then we see the law that
[2:05:46] require that was required to bring that
[2:05:49] back through the Jubilee year through
[2:05:52] Ruth Our Father God who who who who who
[2:05:56] who submitted himself to his own laws
[2:05:58] and he brought the book back he paid the
[2:06:00] price and now
[2:06:03] he calls us to receive the benefits that
[2:06:06] are in the book that's our position
[2:06:10] today is to receive what Christ has
[2:06:14] already died for and redeem for us now
[2:06:17] he purchased his healing for us he
[2:06:20] purchased deliver in the spirit and
[2:06:22] freedom peace of mind he's given that to
[2:06:25] us that's not those are not lottery
[2:06:28] tickets that we win it's actually
[2:06:30] purchased for us when you when you're
[2:06:33] healed it's not because you won a prize
[2:06:37] not because you were lucky you you were
[2:06:39] healed because somebody paid for your
[2:06:42] healing and you were designed to be
[2:06:45] healed it's actually the the book The
[2:06:48] Book of
[2:06:49] entitlement it's the book that is the
[2:06:52] title deed you're entitled to the Deeds
[2:06:56] you're entitled to the promises that are
[2:06:59] in there that's why it's called the
[2:07:00] title deed book of redemption so this
[2:07:03] book of redemption we receive that and
[2:07:06] we thank God for it
[2:07:08] now I like what brother bam says here as
[2:07:11] I prepare to wind this message down you
[2:07:14] know he's talking about the Jubilee
[2:07:17] Year I'll bypass that for a
[2:07:20] moment
[2:07:25] and in the the breach between the seven
[2:07:28] Church a and the Seven SS paragraph 39
[2:07:30] he says this here now it's wrote
[2:07:33] mysterious because no man nowhere knows
[2:07:36] it God Alone Jesus Christ see it's a
[2:07:41] book of M A mysterious book it's the
[2:07:44] book of redemption we'll get into that
[2:07:46] in a little while now we know that this
[2:07:49] book of redemption will not be Thor
[2:07:51] really
[2:07:52] understood it's probed that through six
[2:07:55] Church ages but at the end when the
[2:07:58] seventh angel begins to sound his
[2:08:00] mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends
[2:08:03] that these fellows probed at and the
[2:08:06] mystery comes down from God as the word
[2:08:10] of God and reveals the entire revelation
[2:08:13] of God then the godhead and everything
[2:08:16] else is settled all the Mysteries
[2:08:19] serpent seed whatever more is to be
[2:08:23] revealed so this happens to you the
[2:08:27] individual is that right that's what a
[2:08:30] revelation is it's not a revelation of
[2:08:33] of
[2:08:35] uh uh who the next president is going to
[2:08:38] be you know how we get oh I know who it
[2:08:40] is I you know I know I I know who's
[2:08:42] going to be the next president and then
[2:08:44] like what value is that is it going to
[2:08:45] make you pray more what you want a prize
[2:08:48] now because you're the first one to know
[2:08:50] I mean you got to 50-50
[2:08:53] chance and some of them had thus said
[2:08:56] the Lord on who the next president was
[2:08:58] and then guess what
[2:09:00] happened huh they do it all the time but
[2:09:04] this isn't the revelation of these
[2:09:05] things out here this is the revelation
[2:09:07] of who you are in the
[2:09:09] word as God opens his word to you it
[2:09:12] reveals to you who you
[2:09:16] are and then you know that you have the
[2:09:20] rights to to uh
[2:09:23] Salvation you have the rights to the
[2:09:27] Holy
[2:09:28] Ghost you receive the rights to all that
[2:09:32] God has promised in the book of
[2:09:34] redemption because these are the
[2:09:36] promises that are deeded to the
[2:09:39] Believers that receive it this is our
[2:09:43] this is our
[2:09:44] ownership it our name is identified in
[2:09:47] there somewhere it's written in there
[2:09:49] it's not fully understood all at one
[2:09:52] time but day by day he reveals more to
[2:09:55] us is that
[2:09:57] right so in the seven seal book he says
[2:10:00] this
[2:10:01] here he's talking about the lamb being
[2:10:04] on the
[2:10:06] throne and
[2:10:08] um in the breach paragraph number 200 I
[2:10:13] just love this statement here he
[2:10:17] says now oh wouldn't that be glorious
[2:10:21] thing if our sinful thoughts tonight
[2:10:24] could be laid aside long enough to
[2:10:26] accept him and he would Advance all the
[2:10:30] way from Glory tonight to make himself
[2:10:32] known to any of you and what is he
[2:10:35] showing he's talking about that when
[2:10:38] when John cried
[2:10:41] out uh who is worthy and the angel says
[2:10:44] don't weep John for the the lamb let's
[2:10:49] turn to there real quickly just one more
[2:10:51] time Revelations chapter 5 and he
[2:10:57] says and one of the elders said unto me
[2:10:59] weep not Behold The
[2:11:03] Lion of the tribe of
[2:11:05] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[2:11:09] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[2:11:11] Seals
[2:11:12] thereof and behold and lo in the midst
[2:11:15] of the throne and of the four beasts and
[2:11:17] in the midst of the elders stood a
[2:11:19] lamb as it had been slain having been
[2:11:22] seven horns seven eyes which are the
[2:11:24] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[2:11:27] the Earth he came and took the book out
[2:11:31] of the right hand of him that sat upon
[2:11:33] the
[2:11:34] throne and when he had taken the book
[2:11:36] The Four Beast the 424 Elders fell down
[2:11:39] before the lamb having every one of them
[2:11:41] Harps golden vows full of odors which
[2:11:44] are the prayers of the Saints and they
[2:11:46] sung a new song so they they said the
[2:11:50] lion would come forth word John don't
[2:11:52] weep don't weep John the Lion's coming
[2:11:54] forth and when John turned to see this
[2:11:57] lion it was a lamb a bloody lamb that
[2:12:00] was Calvary that was what Jesus did at
[2:12:02] Calvary now brother brandham asked the
[2:12:05] question where did this lamb come from
[2:12:08] and I'll close with this one last point
[2:12:11] and show you how this operation of the
[2:12:13] Lamb Works cuz
[2:12:15] he's has to be on the right hand of the
[2:12:18] throne in heaven and brother Rand says
[2:12:21] in one paragraph 195 in the the breach
[2:12:24] he says notice where it came from where
[2:12:28] did it come from it come from the
[2:12:30] father's Throne where he had been seated
[2:12:34] since he had been slain and raised again
[2:12:37] he raised up and sat on the right hand
[2:12:39] of God ever living to make
[2:12:41] intercessions amen raised there today as
[2:12:44] an intercessor with his own blood to
[2:12:47] make intercession upon the ignorance of
[2:12:50] the people now that's the one I'm
[2:12:52] depending on he still was covered with
[2:12:55] bleach the bleach of the forgiveness of
[2:12:57] sin John looked at the lamb the lamb
[2:13:00] looked like he had been slain and then
[2:13:02] he noticed he was wounded cut bruised
[2:13:06] and bleeding a bloody
[2:13:09] lamb that's what took our place isn't it
[2:13:13] strange a simple lamb had to take our
[2:13:16] place he saw the lamb he proceeded out
[2:13:19] John hadn't saw him because he had been
[2:13:22] way back into the
[2:13:24] eternities even making intercession and
[2:13:26] showing that those who had come to God
[2:13:29] under the offering of the blood of bulls
[2:13:31] and and of goats a substitutionary
[2:13:35] offering cuz then he believed it it
[2:13:38] pointed to him and the blood had not
[2:13:40] been shed yet so he was there to clear
[2:13:42] them he was there to clear you and I and
[2:13:46] oh God I hope he is there tonight for
[2:13:49] every sinner the lamb been slain how can
[2:13:53] Jehovah see anything but the bloody lamb
[2:13:55] standing there and the lamb proceeded
[2:13:58] out into the vision now as it had been
[2:14:01] slain notice he come from the father's
[2:14:03] Throne oh think where did he advance
[2:14:07] from to this Vision he come from Glory
[2:14:10] where he's seated at the right hand of
[2:14:12] God he Advanced forth to John out of
[2:14:16] Glory oh would not it be a glorious
[2:14:20] thing if our sinful thoughts tonight
[2:14:23] could be laid aside long enough to
[2:14:25] accept him and he would Advance all the
[2:14:27] way from Glory tonight to make himself
[2:14:30] known to any of you now isn't that nice
[2:14:34] to know that he will leave the throne
[2:14:38] tonight today whatever hour to make
[2:14:42] himself known to you he's seated at the
[2:14:45] right hand but he leaves the throne to
[2:14:47] take the book he leaves the throne to
[2:14:50] bring the re Revelation in
[2:14:52] 1963 he leaves the throne every time a
[2:14:55] sinner comes to Christ he comes to the
[2:14:58] throne he'll meet you to reveal himself
[2:15:01] to you and what is he revealing to you
[2:15:04] his
[2:15:04] word his book what book is it it's the
[2:15:08] book of
[2:15:10] redemption that's our rights to this
[2:15:12] morning so he took the book now we can
[2:15:16] take the book we can take back all that
[2:15:19] God has restored back back to us because
[2:15:22] this word is a word of restoration it
[2:15:25] brings us back to what Adam lost the
[2:15:29] same Authority the same power the same
[2:15:31] life now we have to believe that we have
[2:15:35] to believe that in order for it to work
[2:15:38] for us we believe that God has called us
[2:15:41] to it he gives us that Authority you
[2:15:45] know and it's like you know I won't I
[2:15:47] don't want to stand in the way of
[2:15:48] someone who has the faith to speak to
[2:15:51] the storm maybe I can't or maybe I don't
[2:15:55] have the faith that Enoch had but what
[2:15:57] if someone did have that Faith what if
[2:15:59] someone is preaching that faith and
[2:16:02] instead of being a hater let them go if
[2:16:04] they're happy let them go they believe
[2:16:06] they can have all of their family saved
[2:16:09] and you just think well some of mine's a
[2:16:10] serpent seed well you keep your unbelief
[2:16:12] to yourself you know if you believe some
[2:16:15] of your family serpent seed that's on
[2:16:17] you but if I'm a Believer I don't
[2:16:19] believe there's no serpent seed there
[2:16:20] then I can claim that and that's what
[2:16:23] that's what you know you know it's like
[2:16:25] amen keep your unbelief to
[2:16:28] yourself you know you come in and you
[2:16:31] you're you're trying to claim a promise
[2:16:32] for healing and then someone comes up
[2:16:34] and say you know there's no answer for
[2:16:36] that you know you got to go on you know
[2:16:38] you got to do with the do hey you know
[2:16:39] what you know you should keep your
[2:16:41] unbelief to
[2:16:42] yourself you know if if it's not going
[2:16:44] to happen for him let God reveal to him
[2:16:46] it's not going to happen to him but you
[2:16:47] shouldn't be the bearer of bad news
[2:16:51] you should be the bearer of good
[2:16:53] news somebody believe that's going in
[2:16:55] the Rapture somebody believe they're not
[2:16:56] going to taste death why would I be well
[2:16:58] you know what you're looking like you
[2:16:59] about to die now what kind of what kind
[2:17:02] of person would I be just a pure
[2:17:05] hater keep your unbelief to
[2:17:09] yourself you say you a brother comeing
[2:17:11] you I see this God has this for me God
[2:17:13] has that for me God has this for me you
