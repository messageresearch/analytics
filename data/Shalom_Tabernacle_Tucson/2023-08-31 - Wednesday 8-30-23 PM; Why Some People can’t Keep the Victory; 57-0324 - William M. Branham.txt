I will cut my spirit within you and you shall walk in my statues and keep my judgments may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word Ezekiel 36th chapter and uh the 26th and 27th verses now we wish to speak this afternoon all this Great Mighty philosopher Ezekiel and his prophecy and now you know the prophets of the Bible was fell off as God's Eagles now in study of nature since I've been preaching because it was my first Bible to lead me to Christ have you ever heard about 20 years old we've never seen a Bible before finally you know we wasn't religious at all my people formally were catholic and they let the church married out of the church and was gone and they didn't have any religion at all and then the Lord just by his grace picked me up and it makes me loving oh I can never there's something within me that holds the love of God now in studying nature it's about SeaWorld God's great wisdom was was to let me understand the natural things so without an education I could then be able to understand maybe just Supernatural for all other things in the Supernatural of the natural types of things in Supernatural I don't know whether you get that or not but that that is true everything in earth is made of something above and types and so forth It's Shadows our own shadow here on this Earth is what we are now is just a type of what we will be in a glorious Resurrection when all of the sin and sickness and sorrows and death that's finished and the eagle was a type of the prophet now the eagle is a mighty bird and one of the satisfied I ever seen in my life was one day at the Cincinnati Zoo my boy was telling me a few moments ago they've got one just across the lake here and some kind of a little place where we got some animals over there in the zoo and uh I don't even want to see if anything I hate to see is anything changed up and I hate to see Christians cage done if you give yourself [Music] making strong Wings if you won't get any rooms apply so that's what I'll take the Christian has been has caged out [Music] it's exercising our faith then I noticed this Great Mighty bird the eagle and how he would take these great wins and his feet against the the cage and he'd fall backwards and he'd look up towards the sky he would beat again all the feathers as off of his wings and and his head was all beat up and even later on his back when he hit that great bars and fly back he would look up his eyes were weary would look at the skies because he's a Heavenly bird [Music] he would die if he went up there the air is still thin he couldn't breathe it it perished and got to the Earth but the eagle is made of heaven-sowing bird now if you'll get what I mean this afternoon I intended to be a lesson to the people as the Lord will let me speak you see gifts and callings are without repentance we have feet of a Mockingbird we have need of the rain we have need of all the other birds and all the eagles but the eagle can't help it because he's an eagle God made him an eagle and there's no need or any other bird trying to come up with himself they just can't go that far neither could the eagle be quick and sharp like a little hummingbird but everything has its place and every gift of the church has its place just because one's an eagle and one something else you want something else that's all working together in God's Great economy for the jewelry everything but now if the hummingbird try to be an eagle he would ruin himself if the eagle tried to be a hummingbird he would lose himself see if the dog try to be a cruel you see and the Soul can't feel down so there you are we just different and God makes us this way but the eagle we're talking about him now God liking his Prophets The Eagles now the reason he lied to death because however you go the further you can see if you can get up so high above the Earth you can see the entire Earth as it's round and higher you get the further you can see and God and His prophets of the Old Testament which God in Central Time diver Sanders spoke to the fathers by the prophets but in this last day I spoke to us through his son Jesus Christ and I as the Old Testament prophets would raise way up in the spirit we have they can look far off and we see things that were coming God would raise them up and down if the eagle could go ever so high and his eye wasn't according to his his ability of his lying that he wasn't doing any good at all out there if he was blind when he got there believe his honor is made to compare with the rest of his eyes and when he gets up he sees me and he can look more on and the Old Testament Prophet will lies in the spirit and Below up and would see things that were coming to pass andrazito was one of God's Eagles his travels and he would go away and he could see far off and even seen all the way down to our age now about 2500 years away he could see as he lays up in the spirit of God and he seen the day that we're living in that's why he could write it we can watch it as it comes to pass what the Bible wants us said every word will be fulfilled sometimes we try for us to believe it but God will do it anyhow because it's his word and he's he's all wisdom if infants you understand he knows just what was and what will be therefore he could Destiny to make everything work for his Jews our man's on the basis of three more or less free moral agent and he cannot uh God could not take a man and say now I'm going to make you do this I'm going to make you be a Seville a lost man I'm going to make you be a saved man that would be the nature of God now he's not willing that Andy should perish but he wants all to repent but if he was being instant as he is he knew it from the beginning we would perish and who would not perish because he knew what would be he's not willingness to be that way he wants all to come back to him but he knows who will and you won't so therefore he could by poor knowledge he can make everything work right according to his Clinic well that's a happy for his father like that just think of every one of you in years of Davis got your name over the Lamb's Book of Life you never put it there and you're preacher another put it there your church person but God put it down and when did God do it it's written in the blood of the Lamb how many believe there there isn't enough remover or whatever it is [Music] God touch your name on The Book of Life at the foundation of the world said we're just nothing you never had nothing to do with it I never had nothing to do with it God himself did it at the foundation of the world when he slew the land about four dollars he knew that Christ would be here and he was called the Lamb of God slaying from the foundation of the world and the Beast will receive all the girls upon the Earth whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world I wished you Pentecostal people could see this that's one thing you're assured him that's what brings fear and trouble to you or you saw those animals Raise Your Glass on the deep end of eternal security in all this oil you don't have to worry about energy keep your hat in the Bible it won't that's right it's a it's a word of God and a man so that I'm saved I just do what I always do what I want to do the Battle of my movies is wrong then how vertical vaccine longer because if God's in me I only want to do those things that please God it's the nature of the of the person that makes him do what he does that's the nature and God in the beginning knew every person that would ever be on the earth and to begin he knew ever fly ever seen everything that would ever be he's infant and he knew everything and so therefore the day of our names on the lands Book of Life will replace there before the foundation of the world and the gospel to be preached is nothing in the world but the sustaining all of the fish out of the lake as Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is a preaching man a preacher's gun is born to do he's got the kingdom of everything now there's so many fish in that Lake and when the last ones brought out that's the end of it now uh pretty sure he destroys in the net he pulled in that greatness the Bible teaches he blames in everything he brings in water spiders drugs snakes lizards Terrapins tadpoles fish but if you just watch them if you were just watching the nature is in I'm gonna prove what they are right exactly right you watch a gospel message go forth many will come up around there I will show the Nets got him just a little bit there'll be a little brother's Terrace yes didn't leave it in the beginning is it happened to starford that's all and the snake will say you know there's just something about that old horse ain't Snape to begin with that's right the old water spider broken [Applause] for fish God's the one to determine and that's it this Christian religion is to take its firm stand that's right if the Christian faith exists our own educational programs about denomination and so forth and the building of big buildings and whatever that we have today then we do not need the Holy Spirit to ruin God's Church right then the best thing for us to do with that is we're in the right program that's how every person that can get a denomination started let's do it let's build the biggest churches we can have and that's why the most smartest preachers we can get [Music] the brother this great new spirit that we're speaking about this great new church that Ezekiel fire was not to be run along Internationals it was to be run by the Holy Spirit and then if the holy spirit is to ruin the church we don't need so much question about denominations and about the intellectuals and who can say oh man the prettiest and dressed the best we don't need that then let's do what Jesus told us to do go into the streets and the bodies and get the lame whole blind door and write it over there and bring them in so the grace couples will be settled in these days we need that that's the type of religion that we need then we wonder how we get it that we never was commanded to produce fruit no sir God never said anywhere to produce fruit we are to Bear truth and there's quite a difference in producing and bearing now we produce education we produce psychology we produce intellectuals the outside phone but the bear the free interstate on the inside coming out we're trying to smear it on the outside but God's Church isn't guilt like that it's from the inside coming out the apple don't come from the outside of the tree it comes from the inside out the life of the tree shows what it is [Music] and the church will come today it's got an outside intellectual Seminary experience the best polished Scholars we ever had and the church has got the weakest will visit ever had in any age right is because we're trying to control it on intellectual that's not God's program God didn't intend it now look you said what can we do girlfriend what Matrix now notice now the church doesn't need a polishing it doesn't need a face lifting it needs a bird it needs a a conversion something got to happen not just the strengthen our borders not to bring in new members a Revival is not to get new members a Revival is to reside what we got that's what we saw family not long ago in Chicago I was standing out for the great famous Lake Michigan ways were leaping and jumping and have our own mother let's go to Revival today and I stood there there was someone standing with me they said Barbie girlfriend I said the lake has a Revival I said what do you mean by Revival I said look after anything and chubby pounding its ways back and forth and dashing against each other just relaxing and he said well what do you need a revolver is having a rejoicing time [Music] right now I'm jumping and shouting and praising God is wonderful if we can still have the same amount of water when we come down [Music] that's right the church is not built of those rejoicing about deviled things that is built around the baptism of the Holy Spirit the love of God when you say what good does a Revival do then if you notice every time the seed has a Revival or relate it just turns back and forth is to mark all the trash out of it as you get to revive whatever the trash is laying on the bank it cleans itself in a Revival and God knows the Church of the Living God needs a reasonable [Music] [Music] that's right the wind comes down from heaven and gives it a Revival that's what makes the church when a Russian Mighty Wind comes from Heaven one day a Pentecostal Revival broke out that's what we need to take into another Russian Mighty Wind on the Pentecostal Church the gift of little isms and little differences out of it so the love of God through all the trash out of the banks to clean her out let's get started again [Applause] used to be they used to take the girl before they had to smelter and the feeder would beat the girl turn it over it's beat it and beat it until they beat all the dress out of it and how he knew that it got down to a really good goals all the piracy tools Zone and so forth was beat out of it the feeder could see the reflection of himself in it then he noted had it clean listen my dear friends today when the Holy Spirit which is the Peter will beat the church with the gospel to the reflection of Jesus Christ shines into the church then she's pure again that's right but we got too much power right and copper and other things in us yet it must be brought out and only the cedar can do it a Revival is what we need now you cannot bring a message of this brand new Holy Spirit baptism into a giant formal treaty Church you just can't do it and I I remember I love you for all my heart have hope that God will let you know but I've got a little boy at home going on two years old if I've seen him too long and I didn't correct him I would love him Sudan you're your children now I want to say this there are great new of the Church of the Living God in this nation has become in two factions one of them is going so stiff and starchy and intellectual and the others went Plumb off at the deep end on the other side that's exactly the truth that's right went wrong to the phonetic side there's no middle of the road I made that remark some time ago when a good friend of mine Roy needed the State president of Indiana a descendants have gone he said I heard someone say that you should drive in the middle he said you know that's not good ethic a man in the middle of the road would get run over I admitting myself but look fine dear brother he just think so much of the things of the world that's the only way you can judge things by the witness this is a Runway Road there's nobody coming back you're going on or going home that's right you know I know the other you'll know either such horrible girl from Deep In This World we're all with Christ you don't care any come back no coming back you just move on we don't have any of them coming back now notice friends we need our uh yeah bunch of real consecrated people that's what we mean there are the message today perhaps that we were if the president would come to this city and he could say five words about something you ought to tear out this Lake out here and something another like that and we'll start dreaming that way because the president said so they ought to make a Subway over here or something other they would do just because the president said so but rather we are reading today from a book which is greater than any place of this word it is that a president takes your I love our president thinks he's a wonderful man he does them kind of things but of a national Affairs what I'm speaking about I'm talking not to the the city officials in the way of taking care of their city I'm talking to the Church of God by the word of God here's where we need to change now you can't hardly gets the message to the old form of believing Jesus spoke about long time ago in the Bible he says you can't put new wine and old bottles I often wondered what that meant what did our Lord mean when he said such new line in all Bible well [Music] today we only have glass bottles and whether it is New or Old it doesn't make any difference but when I visit the Eastern countries the Orient I find out that the water bottles of that day was made out of animal schemes and then when the animal's skin will fresh in a new skin or when it got old and dry and set to take new unpremitted wine and put it into that new wine unformitted still has a dream of life in it and when it begins to fairness while the oil bottles that were so set and stiff uh there was an explosion it could not hold it and it would just burst open and you the line would perish in the bottle repairs now that's the way it is today you can't take this brand new heaven born Pentecostal lime and mix it up for the whole time Creed of some sort some little certainly died in the world why did you do you're going to preaching about the baptism of the Holy Spirit Divine Healing and signs and wonders that are all scared of trying to stretching it up the days of Miracles Just Dance [Music] okay you can't do it let's just put new Pentecostal line you have to have new bottles right and these bottles this new skin has still got animal oil in it and that new skin will stretch and when you begin to preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit the love of God's Divine healings times and wonders of new skin from the Bible says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the new skin effects message [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that busy cost is not at your denomination now Pentecost is an experience this modern denomination here he causes what you received and that's right it's for the method it's the best dissolution metabolic just as much Pentecost and sometimes a whole lot more religions right it's an experience when you can taste it oh and when that new life begins to hurt and you read in the Bible says I'm the Lord heals all my diseases I believe in God for now what if you're always documenting the loudest your environment fluid has been pumped into you then the first thing in her life you know I always feel sorry for everything I go around to some of them Lords and look at that I think the Man's dead when you take him in and then they shoot a lot of fluid into him to be sure he's staying dead and that's about the way it is that some of these churches today around over America yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's right we need to get girls [Music] yes [Music] up there that really has a spirit and the young couple got married at that church and they took the letter down into Louisville everywhere in a great big City Church where there was Justice or I don't know so starchy and Rachel and one day that little Kentucky Manny come down with the visitor a boy and a little daughter-in-law and of course they just went to church their own Land Based their own look at television like the rest of them does stay away from prayer being Justin normal Christian Life too much about America is today that's Methodist Baptist Pentecostal in all too is to it's exactly right we still room to watch this or do that or take a little ride it's too hot to go to church or something like that I don't feel just good you're gonna be worse than that some of these days when you're condemned at the judges are right and there this little Manny knows she she wanted to go to church she said well honey where do you go to church at well they said mother we go down to the great Trinity Methodist Church down here at the corner oh she said I just got to go to church in the morning she said this is the status and I'm just joking and then when Sunday morning came they've taken little mama down there in a little dress all up over her neck just when the long sleeves and when she walked in the ushers cup back to it to say well what this word this fall out from what antique shop did you bring this from and she walked in her hair buttons on the back of her head and then faced it as thick as a peeled onion and she walks down through there and sits down the minister congregation [Music] we shall now enter into worship can the little lady said well everybody looked around a bunch of look around and see what I've taken place no wonder what happened and the minister said [Music] he said I shall try it again and he said well now he filled out ladies and gentlemen today we believe that Jesus Christ is the great one you know I missed she said well glory to God amen ities they didn't know what had happened and he said the Usher come around he said Madam you're either working the minister he just can't preach it's quite a difference between in and out if they're not her name is [Applause] [Music] the words taken forth is going into the heart and you know I just wonder she might not have her knee might not have been so great in this earth that it was on who's who but I'll imagine it's written in the last book of life [Music] yes I'm gonna have it on the land's Book of Life yes that's the place to get it some time ago I was up into Northern British Columbia and a scene came before me to just killed me first I was in chasing the world please repair on horse and your daughter was returning I wasn't going to take his picture but I thought I could but I couldn't get close enough training on a little about three year old horse and just been broken he was trying his best to throw me and all the gorgeous we went me trying to hit this little Barrel up there because you were 500 Miles without a world or anything so I said Twitter which way and it's kind of Cloudy even a little foggy and that's the reason I had to get close up to the old fellow to get a picture of him oh I'm sure this is the right direction I wrote a little long fall cleared away in the food came out and I thought well I can see my way to ride pretty good just too bad I'll just build up the Farms make the night of it so then after going a little round my little horse was slattering pretty well I tied him up come to an old blow dance a burn over rabbit and it was a blow down turned across the trees after a journey life went out of them many of them just slapped over each other when the winds blow then I stopped there and let me rest I got off and sit down there a little bit and tell you what I call Twitter jokes guys kind of big white clouds in the moon shiny pills I was going on and I thought well this is some place to stop and the winds were blowing as it had blown away the fogging not beginning to hear the most memorable noise I ever heard now so what is that going and that's why I heard it again [Music] I thought what a spooky drink and just then the moon came out was great pine trees standing there and there was just through each white and that moon shining down on them looked like tombstones and it was our most weary sound I ever heard and I thought what a place for me to stop but I fought in love do you want me to stay here I had my little horse tied up and I stood down again to wonder I thought well that makes down her own trees moaning like that makes it so weary for a person passing through here oh my any travel passing through this would be scared [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and all these little insects I was thinking on that that each of those insects are the same insect it's just a different experience one comes back is another the palm of one caterpillars locusts of all the same insects and then just a different stage of its land and I thought yes that's right well then I see why the Lord is stopping here these great big little trees launch for real trees and that reminds me of some of these good big starchy churches you know they stand way up high like that oh my Lord still there's still fire until it's so hot that's all over the city and not just about as dead as the tree was that all they were once trees deal with the spirit way back in the living Methodist area [Music] back in the beginning that tree God's Heritage back there which was his bad history if some of the new church they had Fellowship love they had Bible Doctrine they had everything just right and a long time warning said to eat this afternoon eat better so it's become nothing but a great big old empty spooky looking place that's about right and then every time the wind blows they just move and I said that's right every time God repeats the Pentecostal experience the only thing these big old lords can do is dangle things Americans there's no such a thing as that just as spooky as it can be to try to dial the people who refunding [Music] [Music] they'll never believe it [Music] [Music] [Music] a little bunch of trees they were green that's true breaking [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] experience in this church is either Living God I vote Lord will you do it that he never a bunch of backwards they call us you know the Splitters and all cats or whatever it is but they you say well they were green they might be dreams but they're sexable to the wind and they can give but then they got life [Music] that's one good thing I thought what do you shake them so hard
