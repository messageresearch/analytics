each other for years and we were friends the first time we met and we thank God for that and we're so glad that brother Israel and his family are here in Tucson with my hometown I was born here but it sure doesn't look like it used to and I thought they were going to run me off the road out there today just everywhere all day all night I said Lord to be a little quiet you know but anyway uh they're multiplying on the earth the people and the bride is multiplying in spiritual things amen so it's only the grace of God that we're here and uh it's a great privileged to uh have this first service and I I feel like that I'd rather have one of the other brothers be preaching good to see you brother and uh and uh we uh that's all right because uh we have something to say so you don't have something to say just say something am the bride every bride member has something to say am while I was praying somebody touched me you know that's what you could say God's good to me amen amen your testimony is valuable so we thank the Lord for that so I'm trying to just put my shoulder to the wheel here tonight and uh glad my dear wife is there and all your precious brothers and sisters who love brother Brandon and love the message amen and love each other amen and love the unlovable out there still amen anybody here that doesn't have the hope of Jesus Christ and Resurrection in your life I trust that uh this old timer could say something that might present to you truth and that you by grace of God might receive the truth and be set free amen that's right you will know the truth but you have to meet the truth you have to more than just have it here when the truth comes in as a person then that person makes you free amen so we thank God for that and appreciate his uh love and mercy to us as we uh want to let me get this situated here get my water bottle situated here this is like my Pulpit at home brother as right here this is not yours though there a little too steep right here hold that up amen hold that up and need use this thank you okay that better now you missed all those other words so I'm going to say them again I'm usually wired up you know so this will work so we want to read some scripture today while you're standing tonight I won't hold you long and um and we we want to thank sister uh Sharon and all the sisters has prepared a nice little lunch over there at the house today for us way out in what used to be sahita and Now or S Santo mountains and now it's uh Veil I guess but so anyway I got lost and was late and uh brother brother po told me he did that one time only went all the way and had to make the long U-turn down there by Marsh Station Road and come back so I've done it one time and if I can remember I'll never do again all right with the help of the Lord but thank God for the Holy Spirit that's in us that remembers everything we need to know everything you need to know the Holy Spirit remembers it amen so we thank God for that turn to the book of Ephesians chapter 2 and we will uh and we do want to greet from our local assembly and Saints there and we want to uh just say how we appreciate the music and the worship and the service you know and the the freedom that you have in Christ and I believe that we do have a freedom to express oursel in the presence of the Lord and uh you know when you really have the Holy Ghost sometimes he gets a bubbling over and you just can't control yourself when our brother started dancing there I thought I was in Africa and I said well this is going to be good amen you know you know but so I don't want to hold you long I just want to give you a little salad you starting the dinner like this this Feast you know this Feast is uh this Feast is going to go like several days here and lots of good word and teaching so so I'm going to just start with something light salad but in salad there's a whole lot of everything you know so you just whatever comes at you you just take it and it's all going to be good and it's preparing you for what's more God has prepared for the remainder of the meetings amen I believe everything works in perfect continuity with God don't you nothing's out of time out of cater you know God knows uh the end from the beginning and sister was saying and you brothers that was so beautiful we l that and uh you blessed us and uh somebody shouting I thought it might be brother Caleb but uh it was someone I said God bless you for doing that I appreciate that too because you could just uh we can do that so we thank the Lord and I appreciate the folks who have uh uh rented you this building I think is as rental and uh so it's my first time here brother and so I haven't even been to your church yet so uh maybe next time we can do that but you are welcome to come back up to us okay anytime Ephesians chapter 2 vers one let's and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of the world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience uh pretty pretty dark uh description of our past you know among whom all also we all had our conversation which which means our lifestyle in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we by we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others and here's the verse that we want to capitalize on but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved verse six I like that being put in parentheses but it's still powerful right there and God raised us up together and made us you know you didn't have anything to do in this God Made You amen God made you do it how many believe that God made us to sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come what ages brother seems like I've been here for ages since I first heard this message the ages of our life the ages of the ages of Misery the ages of problems the ages of fighting the battle hoping to go out of here any minute but yet we're still here it seems like ages but in these ages to come amen he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace and in his kindness toward us say kindness toward me say itday kindness toward me through Christ Jesus Hallelujah for by Grace you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God hallelujah then I read another scripture and that's in the book of Ephesians chapter 3: 19 one verse only and then we'll pray and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen shall we bow our heads heavenly father it's a joy and a privilege and an honor yet a great it's a great responsibility for me to be here and for all of us because we believe we're in we're in your presence we believe that you are watching us seeing us how we how we behave oursel in the house of God how we receive the word and you're interested in each of us as an individual from the back row all the way up to the front row people that have been in church people have never been in a church in their life well you're interested in all of us Lord and God we just ask that you would come by and just just brush brush us Lord with your pres put your hands upon us and just hold us Lord touch us father again we just pray that you would make yourself real to us Lord and it's going to take real uh spirit of God to make God real to us in this hour and we thank you for that father we ask you to bless your children be with us in the remainder of the of the service and now we come to that most sacred part Lord the opening of the word and father we just thank you that you have sent a prophet in this last day to open this word father take and cut the top off that Capstone off that pyramid then to join it back together bring out the secret Mysteries and then bring us back together Lord in a perfect body living Tabernacle of the Living God this is our desire father bless your children now and bless everyone anybody's sick or anybody's needy or some lost soul which it seems to be always Lord there's always someone amen that's struggling there's always somebody that's so beat down they just don't know where to go and Lord as I was so reminded the other day a brother gave me a little coffee cup and it said on there said when the world gives you more than you can stand kneel and Lord I just pray that you would hear their prayer hear their cry father we ask it for the glory of God in Jesus Wonderful Name everybody said amen God bless you you may be seated we're happy then that God is uh promised that he'd be in the in the midst of us and where two or three are gathering in his name and my wife and I are alone that's two and so he's always there amen but you know I had a brother one time used to live in Veil Arizona he was kind of lonely because a lot of his family weren't converted and he was just kind of all alone he said brother Ted I'm always alone I said no brother there's always two and the Bible said if were two or three of you there'll be another one a third one coming so amen there's always two because Christ is with you amen he promised he never leave you he never came to you to walk away when when you got discouraged amen how many's ever been discouraged in your life how many's discouraged right now oh you're not discouraged right now how many's planning on being discouraged in the future it's just something to kind of goes with it you know but see that's Satan's job but but if if you can keep focused on who you are in Christ and what God has done for you and that's why I love the theme of these meetings brother po I don't I've you know this is this is so V I've actually prepared about seven sermons and uh so this I I worked on this one for 3 days and it was so great uh to me you know CU all every word every quote is good to me I love every one quote I can I can fly to the moon on that amen when God quickens you one word it doesn't take you know just that's why when a preacher preaches you don't have to be afraid you're not going to get it all you'll never get it all you'll never get it all cuz God been talking to the preacher for weeks and months and years sometimes and by the way this my Jubilee of 50 years serving God in 47 47 preaching so by the grace of God right here in Tucson you know and I was I remember way back as a boy uh that uh um sitting in high school when I was 15 years old and and everybody run up and down the aisle and it was 1965 brother Brandon was up at finger rock and all the kids were running up and down and they said hey that teacher let us out of class to there something up on the mountain up there and you know I was raised Catholic you know and we knew nothing about God today it was always God dead and buried or Jesus hanging on the cross it wasn't about Christ in you amen but this message is Christ in you this message lifted God out of history and brought him up to this moment that we live in now well here I am sitting there you know as a as a boy interested in only Sports my favorite school in high or subject in high school and AI high was a recess and amen I did well in it blessed be the name of the Lord but I don't know how I ended up going to the University of Arizona spent time there but God rich in Mercy amen but when I was that boy at 15 years old I was saying teacher let us out I want to see what's up on the mountain there that hunger was there then it was more than just some surprise thing brother no and sister Shirley so great to see you sorry I wasn't there for your birthday parties congratulations happy 80th brother God bless every brother there didn't raise his hand did he and he said 50 80 years as a Believer God bless him amen well you were a Believer you're born a Believer right amen maybe I got that one wrong brother I don't know about your conversion that much we need to sit down and talk so I'd love to sit down and talk with all of you maybe you wouldn't love to talk with me but I would talk to you I guarantee I would so so uh but we can't do that now so we'll just get right on with this thought but you know I didn't see that light and somebody asked me brother Ted did you see that light I said no I didn't see that light because my teacher was one of those just a few of the teachers wouldn't let their students out you ever had a teacher like that uh I had one I said he wouldn't let us out we were all begging him let us out we can see what all these people are raving about over at AI high school and I I says uh and uh by the way uh on the grace of God sister Norman was our class M Mary Norman and and uh the Sister Sarah Brandon was there at the school as well at AI so we we knew them and there and they knew me and they they told me after I got converted they said there was no way there was no way you were ever going to be a Christian well see you know God does things that people don't understand I don't understand it but I believe it amen so but it was in my heart you know something God does just touches you you know and something just stays there and you don't ever forget it am you know and that's why I believe that you'll never forget things that you need to know the holy spirit's there to Quicken them to you amen and and uh so I couldn't go go see the light but uh I always wanted to know what it was or to see it well then years later after I came in by the grace of God the message 1974 uh right here baptized up in Sabino Canyon and preached my first sermon to a my coworker on a painting crew interesting testimony but it's I know you're not here for testimonies but I just have to get it off out of my off my chest you know like could to speak and uh so then so I preached my first sermon and man he was so close you know I preached my first sermon and he was trying he was a Buddhist and I was a Hindu you know before yeah you don't want to hear that part and uh so we were arguing who had the best religion here I am standing in the pool up at 7even Falls being baptized and he's sitting up there meditating trying to get through and here I am I got through something already got me through he said Ted is that you I said yeah Gary is that you he said yeah he said he said I thought you were a Hindu he said I did too but that didn't that didn't work said I never got what I found when Jesus came to me one day and I preached my first sermon brother I tell you what he was in tears and he just about to get up and dive in that pool and he said nope he said I'm so close I'm just going to stay with my meditation I never saw him again you know if you're if you're close go a little further if you're close don't go back don't go back when you see you feel God pulling you don't turn back because you this may be your last opportunity amen I don't know what happened to him you know if we're predestinated we know we'll be there but we are predestinated to act amen so so so by the grace of God after I was after I was converted I went by after some time and I saw some of my old schoolmates and uh and I uh I said say I found out what that light was that you all were running up and down and and knocking on the doors and saying come out you got to see this this is neat you know and um that's an old time that dates me right using that word uh and uh I don't mind being dated amen but my conversion is eternal amen no time there and uh so I said I found out what that light was and they were the ones that were jumping up and down raving about see in the light you know they saw it with their eyes I never saw it and then they they uh and then they said every one of them they said what what light are you talking about see I didn't see it but I know what it is I know what it was and I believe it amen they they saw it and it meant nothing to him brother that's why brother bam he said so many times in different ways he said it's better for you to see a photograph with a pillar F than to see it with your own eyes because your eyes might be playing tricks on you that day but when you see that photograph you know that's true amen but the best way is to see it by Revelation amen when God reveals it to you it becomes a part of your life amen blessed be the name of the Lord so we thank God for that so I wanted to I wanted to uh anybody have one of these tablets that thinks for itself so we want to read uh we want to talk about what what this s this scripture said but God rich in Mercy well I'm saying that I need to say this testimony about Seth Wallace he was sitting Wednesday night we do tape services in the church we I believe in everything that God gave us whatever God gave us we need it we need every brother every sister pulling together we need every gift every every Ministry amen and we need to we need to uh do like the prophet of God said and just stay in those tapes and say only what the pro the prophet said because otherwise you got nothing for the bride everything the bride needs is right there amen so we thank God for that so we were listening to a tape and brother Seth was there he's a young man I I really believe if I'm wrong somebody correct me that from the church we have a few from up there God bless you brother Gary and Brother David down here he used to be up there but he's found his way back home to his beautiful home and happy here don't like the cold Winters right amen I don't either that's why I'm saying that's why I'm saying haven't walked in here tonight if I ever do retire from pastoring I I'm going to make this my home church right here and come back to tucs Sun I have a house over here might as well do it right people will let me do it but you know when you got one or two or three or 10 or 15 or 20 or 30 Souls that depend on you being faithful and being there you know one soul is worth 10 million worlds we're going to do that by the help of the Lord amen so I'm going to tell you the title of my sermon is but God and that doesn't even sound right but God it doesn't sound like a much and it doesn't even sound right but the whole plan of God is expressed in these two words and I want to tell you about it for the next few minutes we're talking about love you know being the theme of the greatest force in the universe and when love projects and and so this scripture talks about mercy so we were here in this tape God rich in Mercy and brother Seth was sitting there and he'd been he'd been having to take uh medic medication neurological medicines for his uh seizures epilepsy and uh you know he was wanted to get married and have a family and everything like that and it was going to be tough and brother Dennis knows the whole story real well you twoo my brother um so we were hearing that tape this tape God rich in and mercy and while he was heing it he was sitting right there and his mother was on one side of him and his dad was there on the other side or something like that and he looks at both of them and he said Mom Dad God just healed me I'm not going to take my medicines anymore know it was you know God came on the scene it was one of those but God moments amen everything look like you're going to have to go do in this the rest of your life and all of a sudden God changed the whole picture amen no I I I love this sermon for that reason I hear it once a once a week I hear this sermon I so I guess maybe that's why I'm preaching this tonight after all the other ones that we had prepared I fell on this one and uh so we want to thank God not Ephesians 19 it says this I've always and I've always wondered about this anybody here always wondered about something anybody here wondered about something a long time then God revealed it to you don't wonder about anymore we have all kind of people here you know I always wondered before I was a Christian I wondered who I was what my purpose was what I was here for why I was alive why why nothing couldn't kill me I had friends dying of this and that overdoses of drugs and I something was there something was watching over us and you that are here tonight if you haven't given your heart to Christ you must but you will but he's not going to force you but he'll draw you he he will he will create an atmosphere around you where you you can't help it amen it'll just be something you he'll touch a button nobody else ever touched he'll he'll he'll touch a spot in you you didn't even know you have CU down in you is a little spot of eternal life I'm changing my sermon already it's always been there and it just takes the right finger to touch it can you say amen amen like the man that had his air conditioner broke down and he called a man to come and fix it and the man came and he spent 5 minutes he opened up the panel box he took his screwdriver and he put that screwdriver on a screw and he turned it about a quarter of a turn and he said try it now said it was perfect said how much do owe you he said you don't owe me anything said I'll send you a bill the bill came in the mail he $373 and the man said sir said I got a complaint about this bill the man your your service man only spent 5 minutes at my house and I'm supposed to pay him $373 for fixing my my uh air conditioners that I could have fixed it myself oh he said wait a minute what's your problem sir well I'm I'm I'm I'm protesting that the $373 well sir it was only $23 for the for the the the labor that he did the and for turning that screw was only for $23 that's what he told me but said the rest of the money was with all those thousands of screws in there to turn he knew the right one amen hallelujah so sometimes it comes with a great price of having met somebody who knew what screw to turn what what button to touch in your life amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's how we find our mate in life that's how we find our home church that's how we find it's by inspiration God is leading us amen blessed be the name of the Lord amen so we do appreciate that amen and so I told you it's going to be salad don't if it's something you don't like put it aside and then you know come back at it you know the other meals will come the other parts of the meal will come they'll be heavy they'll be good they'll be deep but this is real simple that's way I like to preach and stay and sometime I need to go deeper but I find out that Simplicity just works so well amen and so we find out then that that uh I've always wondering about how that we could know something that surpasses knowledge cuz it seems like it doesn't make sense you can know what can't be known it's beyond knowing it's the same word goo G in the Greek chos and it means to to know or to know a practical knowledge about something to know a factual knowledge about something and then the other word is that it surpasses that to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge amen so I thought about it like this it would have to be Revelation it would have to be a divine revelation that drops something in you that you still don't even know but you know it right it's like it's like like how to know I know the rain was going to I don't know but I know how do you know what to do I don't know but I just know it's a scripture that says and to know the love of Christ that passes knowledge but when you have it in your life you know it can you say Amen but better than that he knows you he knows how to move you he knows what he's going to do with you that's why sometime if he has to slap us around a little bit brother that's good for you amen because he's getting you right into your position sometimes things that we run away for from is good for us because God didn't want us to stay there God wanted us to get somewhere like Jonah in the belly of a whale where we would cry out to him amen and then he would send us in the right direction blessed be the name of the Lord my water bottle is sitting here for Lorn you belong to me and I'm going to use you you served your purpose well excuse me for just being me EXC my dear wife she's put up with me for so long excuse me for just being me but you wouldn't want me any other way would you well wives don't do it like that don't say well God God knew what he was doing when he brought us together I'm so glad for that appreciate his mercy and his grace so we find out then you don't know how but you just know yes amen and to know the love of Christ which surpasses your own knowledge I don't even have the capacity to reach to where that is but yet I can still know it amen and I want to know him more I want to know him deeper I want to go deeper than that knowledge I want that that's why I said you know you say well brother said when am I going to get there I don't know because I've been I've been at this 50 years and it's just look like look like I'm just beginning look like young people are for surpassing me at this time because you know we get knocked around little bit amen things don't go the way we thought they were going to go all of a sudden we think well this can't be according to God's program but you know God has a program that a lot of times he don't let us in on amen he gives us the main part but then between the lines there's a whole lot going on in there Amen in the love affair between you and Christ there's a lot of things he hides from you until the moment you need it and brother B said there's things in the scripture that God hides from you until the moment that you need it because if you get it too early you'll waste it you will not use it wisely amen so God's preparing us for the great moving the great infilling the great Revival amen and I believe that so but there has to be a killing first brother man before you can have a Revival that's one of the sermons I was going to preach tonight you have to have a killing you have to empty out you got to get your own thoughts out of there amen and that takes love brother that's where love comes in it's the greatest Force who else can do it science brother they can cut they can cut the heart out of you but brother in said a doctor can lay there and cut your heart right out of you but he cannot cut the blessing out of you he cannot cut the blessing of the Holy Ghost out of your life amen cuz that's way deeper yeah it's deeper there it's like you know doctors are trying to find cancer and they go look for it and they go look and brother man said he escaped the doctor's knife but brother you got something in you that escapes the world it escapes the man's mind it escapes your own Fallen nature escapes your own problems your own hangups your own conf lexes there's something that runs free amen moving inside of you amen that's God's love that's God's love but then God's love uh let me let me say it this way if it's all right um to use an analogy of how you can know something that surpasses knowledge of what you do know could I say it like this that it if the eagle in the chicken yard story that brother Ram told how many's heard that how many hasn't heard it I'm not going to tell you but I'm going she tell you what tape it's on not right now cuz if I need to remember I'll remember but I I'll show you where brother Ram talked that story but he likened that to us as eagles which is Children of the Great Eagle God you know amen so here this Eagle is with all these chickens and this Eagle well he looked like an eagle amen he dreamed Like an Eagle he had an appetite Like an Eagle he didn't like all those worms and stuff he wanted fresh meat you know he's already an eagle he he sounded like an eagle they were going and he was going so if you do that in church don't worry about it that's that's Eagle talk amen some people are afraid of that say that people are losing their mind I say praise the Lord praise that's the best thing you ever happened to me amen hallelujah you wouldn't want my mind you wouldn't want my old mind brother Dennis no sir they wouldn't want our old mind would they no sir amen they will we have a new mind thank God in Christ amen so there was this Eagle he he sounded like an eagle he felt like an eagle he dreamed Like an Eagle he had a nature of an eagle but he never knew what an eagle was until he looked up and saw something that he reflected up there in the Sky he said I had to see his reflection amen so I believe that God's the same way with his love when God uh come down and I'll just maybe I'll just cut this short nobody said no okay I preach in Africa it's different You Preach in Africa say I'm going to cut cut this short brother we've given you three hours I said what I went to a convention over lashi and we preached the brother said he brother Ted's going to preach and said every body come so they were going to turn me loose you know and preach all my five sermons at once and uh I just preach one and after about an hour hour and a half with the translation uh I sat down and the pastor come over and said hey we expected you to preach all afternoon we don't have an evening service we're going to go all night why didn't you tell me sometimes it's good to talk you know amen blessed be the name of the Lord like people saying you know around the message oh I wish brother Ben said this about that or said this about that or said brother sometimes sometimes we just got to go look again and find out that he did say something about that he absolutely told us everything we need to know already I believe that he just not looking deep enough sometimes we think we we were cheated but we weren't cheated we were given the best there could possibly be given to us in this hour amen blessed be the name of the Lord so this Eagle all haded to look up and saw that reflection he said now I know see it's in a different way it's a different capacity so I could say to you once I was young and I thought I knew and now I know you know but it it's a personal you can't even explain it it's just something that identifies A Life That's in you and what it does is on the as well it creates a love affair between you and Christ until you can't stand for five minutes not to talk to him you don't like people day are so hooked on their cell phones you got to have cell phone what if you what if we'd all checked in our cell phones at the door I don't know if that's a rule in your church it's not in ours either but we're going to do it what they say you can't go five minutes without looking at it you know because it you're you're addicted what it's telling you and what it's showing you what it what it's the emotions that it's pulling and everything like that what if my friend what if my brother and my sister that we could be so full of the love of God until there wasn't anything else existed amen even the devil wouldn't exist in that place amen sin couldn't exist there brother bam said I I long you know brother Bram had you know the Bram Tabernacle in those days that were spiritual that had all the gifts and the things working in the under the prophet and they were cleaning up their lives they were living Godly and they brother B said if I could just walk into a church one day where sin couldn't come in these doors he said where he said if it did said God the Holy Spirit would call it out right now they'd either make it right or they'd get out you see brother Ted that would empty the church it doesn't matter amen God is God you cannot turn away an elected seed of God you you canot preach too hard for an elected seed you can now but now on the other hand if you don't have any love you're going to drive them away right now if you you come on it's hard and it's critical and it's bullying and they feel like they they didn't get blessed they got beat up over there at the house of God I'm telling you what that kind of ministry isn't the ministry for this hour this is the ministry of healing this is a Ministry of Mercy amen we're talking about Mercy now we're talking about Mercy that got me back to Mercy and so with this I'm going to start this uh quote here in uh The God Who is rich in Mercy brother man said in paragraph 35 The God Who is rich in Mercy not 65119 that's the one we're in I want to take from there paragraph 35 I want to take from there a few or part of the verse but God the brother B separated those two words but God that's what I'm titling my sermon today but God The God Who is rich in Mercy but God The God Who is rich in Mercy and I want you to notice here of the uh Prophet or the Apostle rather Paul who wrote how that he made mention of this and how that uh and how you has he quickened who were once dead amen amen you hath he quickened it amen who were once dead now if you were once dead why do you remember your former life CU when you're dead you don't do any thinking but you remember your past because the devil remembers your past that's right but you were once dead you were once dead but now you're alive here's what he says watch now now if you don't you don't you don't believe it don't say Amen but if you say amen and you don't believe it you're a liar so you got to be careful amen better be careful what you what you're saying Amen to listen careful amen this might be deeper than you think but we find out see he said you were dead in sin and trespasses walking after the things of the world boy there I that was me I was doing that the desire of the flesh fulfilling the desire of the mind my this the Mind age right expanding the mind what caused this change verse 37 what caused this change you see and what caused it from one time being dead and then to Quicken Quicken means to be made alive how many's been made alive how many been made Quicken by God but you had to be once dead before you could be made alive amen that's why my sermon that I might preach next time or anytime or some sometime is you got to have a killing before you can have a Revival how you going to revive unless you're dead amen you're going to die to self and that's thank God the Lord knows how to do that for us amen God knows how to make us get sick and tired of oursel that's right sick and tired of how how little love we have and how much maybe knowledge but a little lack of real power amen cuz see say love the greatest Force everybody wants power but now it's personality power now it's uh you know it's it's a it's a Charisma power it's a knowledge power it's a money power comes right into the church amen some kind of thing like that brother B said anything that comes into any church that gives the promises the people power that isn't the Holy Ghost he said that's an antichrist Spirit you turned loose in there God help us friend we don't want the devil in here we don't want Antichrist but first we got to get him purified out of here otherwise he goes with us amen I want to walk in clean don't you want to walk in I want to walk into these meetings here in the 9th anniversary meetings of this church and find a place where I can get revived again I can get a fresh start again brother Chad well you started good a long time ago I need a fresh start I need a I I I need a a new burst of faith I need need a a new Awakening I need a I need to see my reflection again I I need to I need to find my bearings again you say well I thought you did already yes I did but you know the life and time that's why I said Through the Ages to come right brother Bill you've been through some ages man I mean Hard Times brother you know things that seems like it's taken forever for this thing or a promise and this is one of the big questions people ask me all the time say brother Ted Pastor tell tell me why I believe right I've been prayed for I've accepted it and I know I know God's going to do it and I believe he has done it and I'm confessing that he's done it but it still hasn't happen well if I could say to you what brother B said to you know blind blind John Ryan he'd say what does that have to do with it but sometimes that's kind of slaps us on the side of the face say wait a minute why are you say saying that you're because if we had more love we'd be feeling the presence of God in the in the fire in the problem in the challenge in the trauma amen you'd be feeling the power of God I believe that don't you because it's the greatest force in the universe and if there's anywhere in you there nothing that can beat it down aren't you glad for that all right some of you look tired already you're really going to look tired when I'm done if that's the case yeah if we're going that direction don't go that direction wake up Daniel Williams he had something he said he said he said sometimes I preach and people are so feel so comfortable they just fall asleep say they are so blessed and so they they're just they just loving every minute of it he said' if you do that in my preaching he said it's my fault he said because usually what I do when somebody falls asleep in my church he's gone to be with the Lord now I could say this you wouldn't want to know that about him while he was alive but other he said if if they did that in my church he said I would grab a song book or something like this candle here and I just slam it on top of their head and said until they woke up you would want a pastor like that would you what would what would you say if you had a a pastor saw you taking up big three four five six offerings in the church and then he come in there kick down the kick down the offering box Jesus did it Jesus Walks since they were making money they're God that's right amen they were making power their God love is our God our God is love amen our God is love am how's the salad and so brother B said see if you if it was dying physically and find your place again and it could be healed physically that would be a great thing but nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and God quickened him to life you once in times past were dead you were dead amen even many things tonight here tonight even many here tonight one time can look back and know that you were dead but now why aren't you dead tonight as you were then you deserve to be that way because you was a sinner I'm many to go a step further than say an amen and say I was a sinner I was a sinner I mean we could just it like this if brother brandham said it that's what you got to say that was the truth but it's more than that you got a revelation I was a sinner because the nature even though if you never did it a lot of things brother random never did but he said I'm guilty of it all because I wanted to that nature was in there amen amen but one day I found out there was another William Brandon all right amen all right and I was born again amen the love of God found him aren't you glad for that I'm watching the clock don't think I'm not trouble is I need new glasses so don't worry about that don't worry about that I got a way to fix those clocks just take the battery out that's why the devil can't fix you he can't get your battery he can't find your battery he don't know what makes you tick he don't know what makes you run amen he thinks it's just all the people say a nice things about you in church brother God can turn the tables on that one right there amen all of a sudden you're still just is happy you're still just is BL you got your prayer just got longer you got more people to redeem amen and we love the Lord that's right huj and so he says uh he says uh but God yes amen who is rich in Mercy that's the thing say God who is Rich all these things that they were but but God that's where I got my sermon title but God that made the change right there God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah and he says paragraph 39 where we'll stop with it I am so glad for that that he being rich in Mercy and if he was just rich in money or if he just rich in materials which he does you know how many times we pray Lord you own the cattle on a thousand hills you all the blessings your coffers are full you have silver and gold unres Untold and so Lord bless my pocketbook you know but what if God keeps it empty but blesses your heart I'm telling you what that is the greatest blessing can you say Amen sometimes no money is better than some money amen because when you have no money God has to create something for you God has to God has to do a miracle everybody wants to see miracles excuse me oh my too much basketball when I was young I'm not fighting with the my microphone stand now amen trying to block him out I'm going to get the reme remembrances sometimes of your childhood and things and dumb things idiotic things that used to do and stuff like that the devil said aha I caught you you were D you were wishing you could go back there brother the devil's in for a surprise it ain't that way at all because he can't get in your heart he can't get in where your real thought is he can he can maybe read your mind but he cannot read this mind there's another mind you got a you got a live wire moving around sending fire out brother it'll go across the universe brother it'll take down every devil in his path how many believe that you see but I my problem's too big brother Ted your problem is too big for me your to problem is too big for maybe a church but your problem isn't too big for love love can take care of your problem how many believe that amen but then out of that and did I finish oh what a great word that is that how we were once dead but now the word but you know my mother was an English teacher God Rest her soul I'm I'm speaking a lot of slang now and uh she said it's those tapes my mother said she cuz she was a nun in the Catholic church and dedicated me to be the priest of the family out of seven kids five boys two girls I was the only boy qualified by health reasons to be a priest so she never spanked me worst thing mama ever did Dad would chase me with a stick and mom would say Joe don't touch he's my priest I said I turned out a rot you know say well I'm going to make my kid you know I'm going to just show him love you I'm so taller Hey brother they're going to turn out rotten they're going to step on they crush your heart they turn out devil worshippers amen that's right yes sir I got experience with devil wores down at the border down there by SAS and I'll tell you that at some other time but they were the nicest people they were religious they knew the Bible I felt at home amongst these people but brother you find out what they really thrive on that's right and Lucifer himself made himself present that night brother and they were bowing down worshiping howling like wolves and I said God have mercy I'm a Catholic boy I don't belong here but I said I don't want to be identified with this kind of thing see you don't know how far that's going to take you you don't know how far that little thought is going to take you how many's ever been taken farther than you ever thought you would let yourself go brother when that happens there's only one thing that can but God has to come on the but God has to come but God has to fill your heart that I I believe brother I will thank you brother I appreciate the exhortation and the encouragement there must be the brother I thought was brother Caleb I love you brother I know a lot of Caleb in Joshua amen sister that song was beautiful keep doing it listen the Holy Spirit isn't dead he's alive but he's he's love he is a gentleman he is a gentleman that's right he is a gentleman he won't make you offensive amen he won't make you offensive that's why ministers have to draw back sometimes because they want to say something and the Holy Spirit isn't pulling them pushing them nobody's pulling no maybe it's not time maybe next time I'll say it but you're learning that don't you brother George you learn that the things that you you couldn't just give it all to him at that time because they Paul even said you're not ready for it he said I'd like to nurture you up a little higher right but see you got to learn these little Basics here first you got to learn how to love somebody else you got to you can't just be always taking it in taking it in taking it in you got to be a Channel of the love you got to be just like Papa God you got to be the Fountain of love amen is that true thank you Lord I felt Che I'm going to stop there and go on Amen one of these minutes I'm not going to let myself be checked go ahead by my own fear I'm not going to let myself be checked by my own fear amen or my own complex that's right about how people feel about me listen when you've been rejected by people that you love and I guess all of us have you get a little like okay all right I won't do that now I learn a more excellent way I'll tell quote Paul I learn a more excellent way but that's not the more excellent way is to is to hold back when God's leading you the more excellent way is get more love in you get more power the greatest force and I tell devil don't know what to do you you can have like Moses you know when he went down there to pharaoh and Pharaoh he said finally he said he everything he did to Moses Moses come back with an answer from God how how about you Eagle how about you Eagles every time somebody throws something wouldn't you like to be one of those preachers on the YouTube that goes out in the street corners sometime talk to those atheists and all those Wicked people and stuff those those seven gender people and stuff and amen and and and then you wouldn't you say but I don't know I don't know I don't have the boldness what brother George what gives you the boldness what gives you the boldness you know amen amen we have have boldness and access with confidence in God what gives us the confidence in God Amen we love him so much amen we love him so much excuse me you weren't supposed to that was not your position yes it was I'm sorry I'm not in well I'm not in your church either so I'm not tearing it up yet brother I saw stuff in this office that I wouldn't see in your office over there brother oh man God is good aren't you glad you're in the message they said to me brother Ted wow your silver hair and you can't even walk without bumping the microne stand and and you got seven sermons and don't even know which one you're going to preach when how long You' been in the message brother you know what my answer is brother Dennis just now just now came in amen so it's coming together now that's right see God takes us around and around and things are coming in add a little here add a little there add a little there take some out there take something out there take some out there amen constrain you pulling on something to see if there's a fountain in you that can cry out to God that can have a desperation when somebody calls you on the phone and and they if they don't have God come on the scene right now they won't be able to go forward but why' they call you CU they saw something in you have you got that kind of love said brother Ted I don't I don't either but I want it more amen I've seen it work how many we've all seen the power of God work in our life the love and the force of the Holy Spirit till you can pray a prayer and brother power comes down people are blessed you don't feel blessed you feel you feel ruined you feel like wow what did I just do but see that's the way it's supposed to be when God uses you you're not supposed to feel all puffed up it used to be in the old days when God used a preacher the preacher would get small and then the people would get big the the hearts of the people would get full amen nowadays preacher gets big and everybody wants to worship the messenger instead of the instead of the message himself which is Christ brother I'm tell you the truth hallelujah don't you let yourself fall into that preachers God Made You small stay small if God made you a nobody stay a nobody God can't make something out of a somebody he can make something out of a nobody he took took nothing and made something out of it amen yes sir blessed be the name of the Lord Brother B said he caught me when I was nothing you heard this quote said he caught me when I was nothing what brother man said perfect strength my perfect weakness he said I'm still nothing our Prophet said I'm still nothing but I'm in his hand but God you know they said you're not supposed to I got off on my mother being a English teacher that's why I went off I know where I went off my mother being an English teacher it doesn't even sound right you're not even supposed to rules of the English language or any language what if you said going around in Spanish and said P yes Hallelujah P or in France M you you brother but God doesn't seem to make sense and not even in the English language how that could be a word but God didn't know about it God put in the Bible 49 times we got the quotes in the Bible I'm going to read them to you I'll be done in about 3 hours is that good amen am I to take that as a no I don't know how to interpret that because I don't know you all that well but God see but is conjunction you don't begin a sentence with a conjunction that is rules of grammar but God can do it amen he did it in the Bible and a prophet did it too am brother BR said but God 600 and some times in the message but God so it's okay for me to preach a serment on it amen I'm going to do it anyway amen but is a it signifies a contrast or a change or a nullification of the previous and a and a rising of the of the new away with the old and on with the new amen but means there's a change here oh we take it as an example of uh somebody comeing to pay you and say Hey brother Ted I come to I was intending to come and pay you today period but I left my wallet at home I don't like that if I need the money I I didn't want that using butt isn't that true yes sir what the doctor says oh I'm glad you're my patient oh this new medicine I've been using it and it's working great for most of my patients period but in your case How about if it was different you go down to in a car down there you fly in you're late and you're get there and you wait you got a you got a little smart car reserved over there and one of those little tiny putt puts and uh and uh you you you you that's all you could afford so you reserved it and everything you got down to the to the desk and the man says I've been traveling a lot of time these things happen they really do and uh he says to he says to you oh sir I'm sorry oh yes you said said yes yes yes oh that smart car you had reserved guess what we don't have it we don't have it period but I got a brand new Lexus would you like to get in that so so it can change either way amen but with God it changed from bad to good it changes from negative to positive amen all the time how many love the Lord how many like the salad God bless you amen it's it's light fair but it really prepares the way for the good preaching that's going to be coming here I really believe it does I believe that's why God narrowed it down from all those sermons to just this one amen so the word but godic suggests an intervention to move from one event to another from one situation to another from one condition to another amen and and and it uh it speaks of redemption it speaks of God's love it speaks of moving on the God moving on the scene to uh to to as a as an interloper as a as an interceder as someone who steps between you and it you and that you and whatever it is it steps me between you and you it steps between you and you amen blessed be the name of the Lord it not what you know it what knows you amen and knows who you are aren't you glad for that and and then he stands in the gap for you see the love love The Power of Love is the greatest force in the universe that friends you can get so rotten a human being can get so bad that nobody going to stand in the gap for him then nobody going to take their side amen amen amen you know the thief on the cross was so bad but he was hanging out with a guy maybe worse than him I don't know but in their business together but they go both got caught on there they are both on both sides of Jesus but one of them there was a but God moment coming for him the other one he was just he was just cursing he was blaspheming amen listen don't blaspheme by saying God can't help me don't blaspheme by saying my pastor can't help me anymore don't blaspheme by saying my brothers in the church don't can't help me anymore because what you're doing is you're rejecting God's love cuz God's Love Takes human form friends the miracle about it is he takes the form and the devil doesn't see him you know that Jesus was the same Christ that was Michael in the beginning and Lucifer and him were together for thousands of years and here they meet later and Lucifer did not recognize Michael amen and he said if you be the Son of God how many of you ever say that Lord Jesus if you be the Lord if you be Christ if you I used to but I don't anymore brother cuz I know he is nowall Peter didn't know about it but one day when that Revelation came to Peter he said Thou Art the Christ brother I'm not looking for anybody else amen but then what happened to Peter he didn't see the rest of the story unfolding how many of you like me if you saved 10 years 15 years ago and you thought the Rapture be not over by now we'd be out of here yeah and we wasn't going to have all these problems and the ride was just going to get sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter with the love of God he gets sweeter and sweeter the message gets sweeter and sweeter but come to find out there was corruption in us that only bitter herbs can take out amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so thank God for that you say well I like the sweet better all right you might your man part does but I think my soul part likes the real shaking part amen of the message of the hour how many believe that so we're going on here a few seconds more these are going to be long seconds and these are like thousand one that's weird there's there's a joke about that but I don't tell jokes in the Pulpit you uh you got to uh just keep pulling and God will feel you I I want that I want God to pour out his holy spirit his love I think we know about love a little bit the longer we battle against everything that ain't love you know sometimes you come to know something true by seeing all the counterfeit like the bankers and people that study money you know they study all the they can pick up a counterfeit bill right like that because they're handling the right all the time but you know on the other hand people that are in this message that are taking most of their inspiration from the then new sacrifice I've heard this some people they oh it's in the five-fold ministry now I said well it should be because we should be feeding on those tapes night and day then they go and they go don't they brother George and they go they but but now those tapes is an old sacrifice you cannot get cleaned by old sacrifice my brother I have something to say to that person amen I said first of all you are never going to pre preaching my church again second of all he said I I didn't really mean it the way it sounded I said then why did it sound the way we got it why didn't you explain yourself he said well I didn't want to he say kind of what I've been feeding on I said where did you feed on that where did you feed on that what do you got to what do you got to preach to the bride that the prophet didn't say what do you got the preach that the prophet didn't say well this this this we're going deeper we're going deeper than he ever could because we outlived him my brother you're lying you are absolutely telling a lie God in that day it's it is finished he said it is finished he finished the mysteries of God he finished the the open book he finished the closed book he finished your life off he finished you as a finished product and he said I don't call you the church no no longer I call you bride now you are moved into Glory yes [Applause] sir man if salad can make you that happy what will the real meat I'm telling you what brother every quote of the Prophet one quote one quote can change your life one word can change your direction how many believe that I'm going to read a few scriptures where the word but God is used it's used a lot of times in the Bible I lost the exact number 49 times but God is used in the Bible it's used brother Rand used it 400 sometimes in the quotes but God so here's one and Abraham and Sarah went she's my wife and they were down there in guer and the King aimc which is a pretty good man and he was looking for another wife a younger one a more beautiful one and here Sarah and Abraham had been changed back she was youthful and beautiful fair to look upon and Abraham was strong and he had gone young again so that they could they could fulfill the promis and then as a result of that aimc said who is this beautiful girl and Abraham said well she's my sister well it wasn't really a lie and yet it was a lie the prophet God said he lied so if if you know that isn't the whole story you should tell the rest all right otherwise it's a lie you're purposely keeping something way but he had to say that reason why was fear now what was Abraham doing having fear because he got out of the promised land he had left where the blessings he left when you get away from those tapes when you get away from this message when you get away from a pastor who's preaching this message friend you're going to you're going to start having fear friend you're going to have fear now you're going to be afraid this isn't going to work that ain't going to work this a't to work that isn't going to work amen pretty soon you be want to Suicide yourself The Whole World's full of it now if you don't want to Suicide yourself you'll go out there and start shooting at cops and they'll suicide you one way or another it's a cop out it's a yeah that's a play on words but it's a it's a it's a way of back and out where you don't have to take responsibility but brother when God comes to you and sister when God speaks to you and says I am the Lord I am God I will fill you with my holy spirit will you accept me I died on the cross for you and you're say ah let me go think about it a while friend you have just made a big big mistake you made a big mistake cuz you know might not be alive 5 minutes from now you brother bam was that way when he would preaching he still had that Evangelistic fire even as the deeper he went in God he always had that reaching out reaching out cuz he loved people how many believe brother Bam could could could spread the blanket over you brother amen even though didn't seem to be enough for both of you but he'd spread his part over you amen amen that brother he would share everything he had he would he would give everything his shoes tried to give him away to the brother in Mexico that's one to love of come down there the old man blind man there and brother B said he wanted to measure his suit and give him his suit right there on the platform you talk about what seems to be silly what seems to be but brother that's what love will make you do sometimes things that everybody else can't understand but then when they start grumbling about it your love will still be strong for them you will never say oh they're they're just you know they just don't have the spirit they don't have any Revelation friend don't say that amen some of the people I thought had no Revelation got had more than I did and a lot of times when I was younger I thought I had all the sense in the world there was nothing nothing less for anybody else I come to find out I had nothing amen I thought it was but it wouldn't work but love works love works Love Never Fails try love have you tried love love never fails have you asked God to fill you with the Holy Ghost what is what is love it's God it's God himself he's the only Fountain of love he that loveth is born of God knoweth God and loveth God sir and has God in their life amen is that true you said well we need more gifts well said brother BR said love brings Fellowship Fellowship brings gifts we want to turn loose we want to have hatch out more preachers we got to we got to train more people brother love will do that love will train you I've been trained by love love tells me what to do where to go when to stop how far to go when I'm hurting somebody when I'm stepping on their toes you say brother Ted how do I learn that where's the school you went to I said the School of Hard Knocks the school of where do you did it wrong and you learned the right way like it was JP Morgan I think one time they said but Mr JP Morgan how in the world did you ever get so rich he said Son it was because I made right decisions they said well then how do you learn to make right decisions what what would be your answer if you were JP Morgan I made plenty of wrong decisions boy I learned amen amen when I tried something that wasn't love it didn't take me as far as I needed to go I come back to love you got to always come back to love that's why brother po you are right on track there and love is a got the nine gifts nine fruits of the Holy Spirit flowing out of out of love in this ninth anniversary meeting if it could be a baptism of love take over this church there wouldn't be a feeble one here brother said I got to say it brother said if you could all be in one mind one Accord and take this word that I'm telling you right now he said in five minutes from now brother we just need that five minutes you don't need a lifetime you one five minutes will change you forever he said five minutes change Moses up on the mountain 5 minutes in the presence of that burning bush of fire he wasn't a runaway Prophet no more he wasn't afraid no more amen blessed be the name of the Lord he met the Power of Love brother he went down there any demonstrator you say well I got love talk about it tell me you got love show me you got love that's what the Bible said show me you got faith I got faith and that's why I'm not telling all my testimonies tonight you're going to say oh brother Ted is telling us about his faith I don't want you to know about my faith that's precious to me but I want you to know I want you to know my faith because it works by love I want you to know that the love is what makes my faith work amen Faith worketh by love did you know that that's right I'll finish this sermon somewhere else we'll leave some salad on the plate here but let me go a couple of more minutes my time is up according to that I'm looking over at the pastor now he's my time clock here and contrary to some people's belief that have that have heard me preach I can end a sermon but I don't want to that's the problem you're blessing me so much am just being here because there's an interaction you know I like one-on-one Ministry so I kind of do that you know and I'll get on you like this well we don't want that tonight that'll take too long we'll go the fast line tonight amen see so Abraham aim was going to take her and everything and it said but God came to aimc in a dream so God can talk to people amen you don't have to do it all you don't have to worry yourself to death about your situ situation God can talk to your aimc amen you got an aik God can talk to him somebody mistreating you pray for him project love their way right brother Dennis isn't that work it works in Romania Works in Bulgaria Works among the Gypsy people right Works amongst the white people Hispanic people French people African people works everywhere there's nothing of a greater forced in love it works in every country Every Nation every people every tongue every language amen pck me name I went up in the Philippines to pck me that didn't even speak Filipino I mean they lived in Philippines all their life they never spoke a word of Filipino cuz they never went to school to learn so they got about three dialects they speak they're but this tall the little lady playing a little guitar she was so sweet I remember like a day it happened about 45 years ago my first trip into the Philippines and she's playing a one string guitar and brother and she smile and she's only got one tooth and her song only had one word it was so one Toth one Str one name Jesus yes yes brother the Holy Spirit came down you you you it listen I'm saying this and don't take me wrong people I've been all over the world and I think when people polish up just for the ears of man the Holy Spirit kind of take his flight friend you got to just be yourself you got to be just where the rubber meets the road my [Applause] brother just be yourself God made you the way you are specifically trained you and and used you and put you in that position where you're at so he could step into you and be an irresistible Force to somebody amen amen and we believe that so Abraham but God came on here's another thing about Abraham and I think I'll close on this and this will be we'll call this part one salad so here's Abraham and I love this part it just seems to get so good you know deeper when they get deeper in the message were we're looking for a place where we can live that God can use us when we're not even capable amen amen now I think I'm getting to that part in life for you know used to travel like four or five times a year overseas for up until about two years ago now as we had some health concerns and things we thought well I'll just say all my all my uh preaching and going overseas and conventions and things has come to a Hal but next year I'm back at it again hope but you know when reality hits and you may not be able to you can still project love amen because love doesn't just sit around that's right love doesn't just sit around how many got a holy spirit inage just sits around in there you got to stir him up that's what the Bible says stir him up it's like preaching you know stir up that gift that's in you stir up that life that's in you stir up that fire sometimes my stove I I still burn a wood stove up there you you wouldn't want that in Tucson it burn you out of the house right brother Dennis but we thank God for wood otherwise we'd be out of our house right brother Dennis we couldn't afford the electric bill up there where it gets real cold so I get that Fire Burning Brother David I never taught you how to really get a fire burning so hot that you couldn't stand being in the house cuz that's what I do and then when it D down you start feel chill little chill comes on you got to get you don't need to throw new wood on there you just need to go stir up those coals that are in there stir up the fire you once had amen stir up that fire that was once in there that's what these meetings are supposed to do it better maybe not teach you new things but reinforce the old things maybe get you back to the love amen maybe starting with salad isn't so bad you know the heavy meat and everything but brother don't let it ever become a head knowledge right brother right brother no so many times you see that with people qu quote quote the prophet quote quote just what the prophet said there's no feeling brother there's no feeling that's why I like to go back to the tape and hear hear the feeling that brother Brandon preached this with brother brandham didn't say well but but you know you were you were once dead and you know no we know this and you're all scientific but brother Brenham he had heartfelt religion brother he had heartfelt religion do you believe that and God used him and he came down like Jesus Christ did in his day and brother brandom was Among Us to to project love and to stand in the gap for us all amen but you say well why am I here still standing in the gap for them standing the gap for somebody else for your family member for somebody on the street amen some of you young people what's the matter with you go out there and start talking start telling people start witnessing but I'm afraid they won't receive it what's the matter your feelings up on your shoulder you're such a baby that somebody's somebody resists you you haven't got no love love is more powerful than resistance H I had a man was going to beat me up one day I was out in the park down there Fourth Avenue in tucon I said my soul was burning with the love of God friends that how many lost your first love and wants to get it back is there anybody brother if you ever had it you want it back if you ever had it you will you will recognize that you're not where you ought to be tonight she said it is good for you it might make you realize amen amen so I said I said sir I said the Lord Jesus loves you he said you want a joint I said no you enjoy it I don't like it anymore I don't want that anymore that was killing me but now I'm alive I was once dead like you I was once was uncertain of where I was going he said you going to keep preaching and make me turn my rotweiler loose on you and I said yeah I am you said brother Ted were you crazy yes amen my brother George was talking about not being afraid of the animals well that Rott water was showed his teeth just waiting for a a word from his trained he was trained well and I said sir I just can't leave I just I feel drawn to you you know I really care for you I was there I know what you're going through see that you have to know where people are you have to know Jesus had to catch their Spirit right brother Ram had to catch their Spirit when you have love you you're able to tune in how many believe that is this okay am is this a way get you a little bit of last morsel of salad here that you could catch their spirit and you could feel like all right I can't say everything but if I just say the right thing oh brother it isn't in the abundance of words in abundance of knowledge amen it's by a simple Revelation some little something that sticks with a person and he said you say one more more word and I'm going to turn my dog loose on you and he said sick but he didn't say it like he usually does something had come over him and he was afraid he was afraid that wasn't Ted how many knows it isn't you it's love that does that in you love creates love is a creative it creates an atmosphere when you have love you can create an atmosphere you can change the atmosphere how many needs to change the atmosphere in your home around your job or in your situation change it out clean it out clean it out change it amen and I I I was just praying I Lord I'm not afraid of his dog biting me if if that has to happen I'm just if if I'm a fool I'm your fool Lord I was just saying it in my heart how many know God hears that kind of prayers because he lives in your heart he is close to where he lives even if you whisper you close to where he lives when you're praying in your heart like the woman you know went and said inner heart if I could just touch His Garment rather that was right there because the inner heart was that love that God was pulling her can you say amen hallu and he said sick but the dog didn't recognize his voice and the dog sat still there then this man looked and he lost it cuz Sinners when they can't control something they just blow their top yes when they can't understand something they just blow their top yes newborn Christians if they're not full of the Holy Ghost yet they still got to get that sanctification they'll blow their top and things don't go the way they wanted it to go amen cuz that human love is still there brother say that self love and that love in the last days lat Church age brother said that self L and love for material things would literally take the place of the love of God in the church but not in this church right Shalom Tabernacle not in this church the love of God still got his place in this church can you say Amen how many says he has first place in this church say I give the love of God first place in my heart did because I want what that Prophet had I that Prophet had what Jesus had he they had those butt God moments going on in their life you had a butt God moment I want another one I want another one I'm in a place right now what but I'm waiting for God to intervene and he will because and here's why I'm going to stop with Abraham you know the the word love was never used in the Bible until Abraham you know what was going on with Adam and God well whatever it was it wasn't described like love but it was first used with Abraham it was this when Abraham God told him take your son your only son Isaac whom you love right in Genesis 22 amen and you offer him to me for a sacrifice and we know that brother said God was testing Abraham amen amen right so hey Abraham goes and he they see the mountain far off where the Lord directed them to go and he says to the the brothers the men family and different ones that were going with them uh you stay here said I and the lad we're going to go up on the mountain and I L we going to come back you know just prophesying is that true how many ever had enough love to say something like that amen you just knew it was going to happen how many here would raise your hand I'm not ashamed God spoke something and it happened through my life you know with brother BR you say well you're trying to be like brother friend brother brand had those things happen every minute of his every minute of his life brother amen he was walking in a realm amen what could you call the realm that he was in perfect love yes perfect Grace perfect Mercy amen amen and so here's Abraham let's he run9 now that's not funny anymore it's timey to quit when a preacher Smiles make cracker smile or something that people don't time to stop you learn those kind of things don't you here's here's what I wanted to say brother Joe you've been standing there a long time God bless you wait a minute is that better okay let's back up and get part you missed and uh so Abraham he's there and Isaac says Papa here's the wood here's the fire the words of sacrifice and and Abraham says Jehovah Gyra amen hallelujah yes sir and so Isaac typing Christ that gentle nature surrendering his life he laid down Abraham maybe tied him down so he wouldn't arrive with the pain he couldn't stand the thought of it but yet he was being obedient and uh he drew the knife up now Abraham was a herdsman you know Abraham was a man of butchering animals and things like that and said no you know that when a moment comes you don't you don't fool around amen but Abraham raised his hand he was ready and was just about three seconds not my kind but 3 seconds amen and it and it would have happened and then God spoke through an angel the angel spoke said stay your hand Abraham amen and here's the words that that baffled me baffled me because I believe in for knowledge I believe that God is in omniscient amen he knows everything yes but God said now I know that you really love me I use the word fear that you fear me but that word fear if you trace it down and I did and I studied It Old Testament they used fear and New Testament they used love fear meant such a reverence that came from a close amen Union with God so it's love now I know you love me now I thought God already knew that God already knew you loved him but why didd he put you through this trial amen did he know it he knew it like that but then there's something that surpasses knowledge like that right amen I mean the prophets had spoken about it and everything and everything all the scripture and the prophecies all had to come together and it couldn't be it couldn't be this could not be the sacrifice yes right but he said now I know that you love me so here's the finish of that Brother David is this God would just say it this way he couldn't even know what was really in him amen until he saw it in a man and when he saw himself in Abraham amen that same love he said now I know you love me and then he says out from his soul came the blessing of blessings upon Abraham said because you have done this amen yes now we have brother bam making the same stand in this hour and God said the same thing to him he said because you you have made a glorious decision amen and you've chosen the right way because it is my way amen and he said because of this a huge portion of Heaven will we granted to you brother B said that's not Thousand Acre property on on the other side said that's the word that's in you that you're waiting for to come into manifestation God huge portion of Heaven is in you waiting to come into manifestation then he said this in itself if I'm not if I'm not right brother Bill you're correct and I know you if this in itself I I learned that in French but I can't repeat it I just forgot the words but this in itself is that which will make which will bring and make come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine amen friends when you have love divine in your life you don't have no defeat you got Victory amen and it's a tremendous Victory because sometimes we got these nagging besetting sins that we couldn't get rid of but once they're gone amen once that love just speaks so loud that the Old Devil can't hang around like brother B said when they was sick said devil you like me to praise God said if you do hang around but if you don't I'm going to praise God for my healing anyway and they said brother bam you were miserable your face was turning blue you were throwing up he said your stomach was obviously sick and yet you said you were well he said brother you got it wrong said that wasn't me that was my faith talking let your faith do the talking Amen Let Your Love do the pushing let your desperation do the crying amen I believe those things are and let the mercy of God show his love to you cuz how would you know love if you didn't know Mercy right how would I know it's love if it wasn't merciful to me amen how many love the Lord today and mercy is kindness to the helpless amen and so that's why brother man said perfect strength by Perfect weakness he said we think we're so strong he said we got to have a killing he said' we got to get weak yes and when we're weak then we're strong amen aren't you glad now we're not going to jump up and down and shout when we we're sick we're hurting we get a bad diagnosis people tell lies about us friends that we love won't talk to us people turn their nose at you instead of their reach their hand they turn you the cold shoulder that don't feel good that is not fun I'm not asking for that but I'm just asking for more love to lift me higher so I can still keep joyful in the midst of it amen amen how many wants to have that Joy back in your life the joy of the Lord is my strength how are you going to get the joy of the Lord well what does it matter my love is so strong ain't nothing can separate me from the love of God that's in Jesus Christ I'm all right I'm good to go everything's going to be good because love is on the seen but God came and changed my life but God is here today amen amen amen no matter what happened amen but God remember that let's bow our heads heavenly father would there be a hand that would raise and say brother Ted kind of made some sense to me something got a little little touch there little flutter little flutter like like a little Dove or some wings fluttering over my heart I don't know what that is I think I really feel like you really care for me sir well it's him is me it ain't me but he loves you amen but he's chosen to house himself in people and then now we're standing in the Gap and I'm standing in the gap for you tonight if somebody want to raise your hand and say brother Ted I want you to pray for me you're kind of an elder and Oldtimer and you've seen a lot of stuff and could you pray the prayer over me would there be somebody whether raise your hand God bless you I see them everywhere I and brother I believe I I want more love but I believe there's something there that's burning in my soul even now I can't explain it I can't control it that's for sure and I want to I want to ask God's blessing on you and for the remainder of these meetings and for these ministers I'm going to be interceding for you Brothers Heavenly Father we humbly bow anyone else want to raise your hand say Lord I need a butt God moment it's just I'm going one dire I don't want to go this way no

anymore than I love you right now and I'd like to pray for you anyone else so Heavenly Father we're here tonight the beginning of this little salad here little light something light to kind of prepare the way for the real preaching was just a couple of little testimonies and things a little something that we could remember that brother bam used the word but God and the Bible used it and so we feel like we have the privilege of using that word to say that that's the moment that we have right now in moments like these Lord these but God moments something turns around and Lord I just pray that you would speak to the hearts and take those things that they've heard and then just roll them over and over and over again in their heart until they would surrender to it a man hear my voice and open the door so it's not just hearing your voice but then opening the door he's then I'm going to I'm going to come in and I see the welcome mat oh out there and I am going to come in we're going to eat
