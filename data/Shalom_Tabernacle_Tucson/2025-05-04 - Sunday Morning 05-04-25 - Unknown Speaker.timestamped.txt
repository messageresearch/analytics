[1:31] [Music]
[2:19] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[2:21] We'll open up in a word of
[2:25] prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, it's such
[2:28] a privilege and a blessing to be here
[2:30] today, Lord, to come before your
[2:32] presence with rejoicing and singing and
[2:35] praise. Father Lord as we listen to
[2:39] portion of the message Lord of the
[2:42] Thyotara church aid father we pray Lord
[2:45] that you just open our eyes to
[2:47] see Lord you said that we would the
[2:49] churches would know that you are he that
[2:52] searches the res and hearts. Father, we
[2:56] we're asking that today that Lord that
[2:58] you'd the words of our mouth, the
[3:01] thoughts, Lord, the meditations, Lord,
[3:04] would be acceptable in your sight, Lord,
[3:07] washed in the blood of Jesus Christ,
[3:10] Lord. And we we thank you for that,
[3:13] Lord, cuz we stand in thy strength and
[3:15] thy power, Lord. Without you, we could
[3:18] do nothing. So, Father, just take us

[3:24] Lord, as you see fit with words of
[3:26] faith, Lord, and sound doctrine. And
[3:29] we'll give you all the praise and the
[3:30] glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[3:33] ask.
[3:34] Amen. We'll be continuing starting at
[3:38] paragraph 56, ending at paragraph 97,
[3:42] and the thyrotire church ages from the
[3:45] message in Revelation chapter 28-29.
[3:50] Can we sing only
[3:53] believe? Only
[3:58] believe.
[4:00] Only
[4:03] believe. All things are
[4:09] possible.
[4:11] Only
[4:14] believe.
[4:15] Only believe.
[4:20] Only
[4:24] believe. All things are
[4:28] [Music]
[4:29] possible.
[4:31] Only
[4:34] believe. You may be seated. Brother
[4:40] Brandham. Dwan law. There was resorted
[4:43] to works instead of love and faith.
[4:47] um uh getting the more and more all the
[4:51] time as it went on. All right. I know
[4:54] your works. I know your faith. I know
[4:56] your patience and so forth. But now
[4:59] we're going to take the 20th
[5:01] verse. Listen to this. Notwithstanding,
[5:04] I have a few things against thee,
[5:07] because thou suffers that woman Jezebel,
[5:10] which calls herself a prophetist, to
[5:13] teach and sedue my servants, and commit
[5:16] fornications, and eat things
[5:19] uh sacrificed unto idols.
[5:22] Now, woman, what do we find out? Woman
[5:26] represented last night? Church. Now, now
[5:29] we find out here they were called
[5:32] Nickelodian doctrine of Balum and now
[5:35] it's become to a
[5:38] Jezebel. Now Jezebel if you'll notice
[5:41] this is a great history. Now if you want
[5:43] to write it down start in first kings
[5:46] about the first kings about 16. Jezebel
[5:50] was not a daughter of
[5:53] Abraham. Neither was this group over
[5:57] here, the pagan Rome. The Nickelians was
[6:01] a cold, formal bunch of Christians that
[6:03] had separated themselves from the real
[6:05] Christians, seemingly not having the
[6:07] faith. And they want to make the church
[6:10] like a lodge. The same as he got today,
[6:13] like a lodge. No spirit in it all. Days
[6:16] of miracles has passed. Oh, that was for
[6:18] another age. We got a brotherhood. A
[6:20] good mason, odd fell, anything like that
[6:22] produces that. And that's all right. But
[6:24] that'll never take the place of a new
[6:27] birth and Jesus Christ. Salvation to the
[6:30] soul. This truth. All right. This
[6:33] Jezebel. Now, she was a daughter of
[6:35] Abraham. That's true. A princess of an
[6:38] idoltor at that time when the royal
[6:40] family, her royal family was feigned by
[6:44] cruel, savage loyalty to Baum. Her
[6:48] father was a priest of the idol of
[6:53] estr. I don't know how you pronounce it.
[6:56] I just picked it up in the history. Ahab
[6:59] used this strategy like Constantine,
[7:02] this great powerful nation next to
[7:03] Israel. So therefore, what did
[7:06] Constantine do last night? He wasn't
[7:09] converted. Amen. He was a politician.
[7:13] What was he trying to do? He tucked the
[7:15] Christians when they told him they'd
[7:17] pray. And now that remember he's we're
[7:18] talking out of the Nickelodeon and he
[7:21] said if they would pray and he'd win
[7:23] this battle then he would uh he'd be a
[7:25] Christian. He had a dream painted his
[7:27] shields white that night of the cross
[7:30] where the Knights of Columbus is born
[7:32] right at that time. Now that's where
[7:34] they take their stand. But he never did
[7:38] anything like a Christian on one of the
[7:41] Nickelian churches called St. Sophie. He
[7:43] put a cross. As I said last night,
[7:45] that's a only thing he ever done. It
[7:47] sounded anything like it was for the
[7:49] church. As far as I could ever glean out
[7:50] any pages of histories, and many other
[7:53] scholars say the same thing. We know
[7:55] nothing about his conversion. Now, but
[7:58] what did he go into? The thing he wanted
[8:00] to do, he seen the most of Rome. Now,
[8:03] now look at this. Watch this strategy
[8:05] and watch how the Bible confirms it. God
[8:08] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[8:09] taking
[8:10] place and Constantine used the same
[8:14] strategy. God said here that Ahab used
[8:18] now Constantine seen a great part of his
[8:21] people were these nickelians Christians.
[8:24] Some of them was called heretics. That's
[8:26] the Pentecostals. They were heretics,
[8:28] holy rollers and what more? There's
[8:30] where your real signs and wonders lay.
[8:32] But the church natural then was coming
[8:34] on up to the organization.
[8:36] What did he do? Constantine played a
[8:39] smart part. He goes over there and gets
[8:41] his pagan friends and gets his Christian
[8:44] friends and unites the churches
[8:46] together. Sets up a a brought
[8:50] paganism into Christianity. Christianity
[8:54] and paganism married in the Pergus
[8:57] church. Now, what did he say over here
[9:00] to this tonight? The same thing that
[9:03] Ahab did. Ahabad to strengthen his
[9:06] kingdom married Jezebel, this idolatrous
[9:10] to strengthen his kingdom to get more
[9:14] strength into Israel. And that's what
[9:17] the churches is trying to do. You see
[9:18] where they're trying to make a Bible,
[9:20] have it out next year in ' 62, that it's
[9:24] a Bible that'll please the Jews. It'll
[9:26] please the Catholics and please the
[9:28] Protestants. Oh, brother. I got the
[9:31] newspaper clipping. I haven't got it
[9:32] with me tonight. You heard me read the
[9:33] other night. Yes. Amen. There you are.
[9:35] See all them things to try to increase.
[9:39] They take God's holy things and scatter
[9:41] them anyway to increase and make a lot
[9:44] of numbers. That's what the church done.
[9:47] It accepted people into it on the basis
[9:49] of shaking hands. They got renegades and
[9:52] everything else. Amen. Unregenerated
[9:54] people, but into the true body of
[9:56] Christ, which is not an organization,
[9:58] but the mystical mythical body of
[10:01] Christ. You can only come in there under
[10:03] one way and that's through the baptism
[10:04] of the Holy Ghost. Right. And the same
[10:08] signs that struck down apostles strikes
[10:10] the church.
[10:12] That's exactly right now. We don't have
[10:15] to compromise and say, "Well, we'll go
[10:17] join with these. We'll go join with the
[10:19] oneness. We'll go join with this or the
[10:21] Baptist or Methodist." Let's join them
[10:23] with Christ. Amen.
[10:26] Stay free from these things cuz each one
[10:29] of those organizations are all right.
[10:31] But they they get their doctrines and
[10:33] their things and you have to go see if
[10:35] the general overseer let you come in
[10:37] that country and have a meeting. If you
[10:39] don't teach just exact like they do,
[10:41] house you out.
[10:43] You can't stay with the Bible. Amen. God
[10:45] can't do it. He hates it. Amen. Amen.
[10:48] Any other born again Christian would
[10:50] too. Amen. Many of those people out
[10:52] there are absolutely wants to do wants
[10:55] to serve and wants to fellowship but you
[10:57] can't do it. They kick you out. Well,
[10:59] let them kick you out. Amen. Get the
[11:01] Holy Ghost anyhow. Exactly right. But
[11:05] you see, they they want to get that that
[11:08] dogma. They want to get you where you
[11:09] got a lot of money. The Baptist had a
[11:11] slogan in 44. A million more in 44. What
[11:15] did they get? It's like the great
[11:17] evangelist Billy Graham said when he was
[11:19] in Louisville, I'll go into a city. Said
[11:22] St. Paul will go into a city. He'll make
[11:24] one convert. Come back next year. He's
[11:26] he's got 30 off of that one. great great
[11:28] great great great grandchildren from
[11:29] that one conversion. He said I go into
[11:32] the city called 30,000 of I go back next
[11:35] year and can't find 30. Amen. What he
[11:37] said, he made a good statement but still
[11:39] I don't believe that our precious
[11:41] brother was right. He said you lazy
[11:43] preachers said I'll give you their names
[11:45] and address you sit with your feet up on
[11:46] the desk and write them a letter instead
[11:48] of going talking to them. I I kind
[11:50] admired him for that. I like a man to be
[11:52] what he is, not a hypocrite. Stand out
[11:54] and be what you are. And I like that.
[11:56] But I'd like to say, Billy, who was up
[11:59] there to take that convert that Paul
[12:01] had? Amen.
[12:04] What it was, Billy, if you just quit
[12:06] letting him go back there and shake
[12:07] hands and wake up and say, "Yes, I
[12:09] accept Jesus as my personal savior." And
[12:11] let him stay there till he dies and
[12:13] rocks and is born again of the Holy
[12:15] Ghost. He'll make new converts, brother.
[12:18] You He's a blooming with fire. You can't
[12:20] put him out.
[12:23] He's like a house on fire in a high
[12:25] wind. You just can't do it. Oh, he's
[12:28] spreading everywhere, brother. A real
[12:30] convert of Christ. He can't sit still.
[12:32] He's just He's on the move. Hallelujah.
[12:35] Oh, I'm so glad. Oh, glory. Old passion
[12:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost. It sets your
[12:40] soul apart. Amen. Can't stand still.
[12:44] Amen. Wind fanning a rushing mighty
[12:46] wind. Just keep
[12:49] just keep feeding the wood and keep
[12:50] going. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Nobody had to
[12:52] take Paul's convert. Paul take him deep
[12:55] enough in Christ till he got dead to
[12:56] himself and alive in Christ and he done
[12:59] the rest of it,
[13:01] right? That's what it is. Baptist
[13:03] brethren are fine, but a million more.
[13:05] What good does it do? You got a million
[13:07] more names. We just sit down and make up
[13:09] some of you and put them on there.
[13:11] That's all right. But brother, what we
[13:13] want is names on the lamb's book of
[13:15] life, slain from the foundation of the
[13:17] world, washed in the blood, filled with
[13:19] the Holy Ghost, signs and wonders
[13:20] following you. Amen. Search the
[13:23] histories. I wish you all get the nine
[13:25] councils and read those things to see
[13:27] how those martyrs help that theme of
[13:30] Pentecost. I'll tell you now, brother,
[13:32] you Baptist, Methodist, and whatever you
[13:35] are, the true genuine life is not the
[13:37] Pentecostal organization now. But the
[13:39] true genuine light is a Pentecostal
[13:42] experience.
[13:43] Down I've been days and days now those
[13:45] histories dig them into all I can find
[13:47] everywhere. And it's that flame of
[13:49] Pentecost has stayed alive from
[13:50] Pentecost down to this time. Amen.
[13:53] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. Been pushed
[13:55] out. Some of them say, "Well, the great
[13:57] Catholic Church has stood the waves."
[13:59] Why? It proves that she's the real
[14:01] church. Well, it's no strange thing to
[14:04] me with the state and everything else
[14:06] behind her. She could exist. Well,
[14:08] what's a what's a strange thing? That
[14:10] little bunch is pulled off, that little
[14:12] minority kicked out, to go in jail,
[14:14] solved to pieces. How do they ever
[14:16] exist? Because the spirit of the living
[14:19] God in their beast, sir, and all the
[14:22] demons of hell cannot prevail against
[14:24] it, sir. Upon this rock, I'll build my
[14:28] church on the gates of hell. Amen.
[14:31] Glory. The real thing. Yes, sir. Amen.
[14:34] That's what gives the Holy Ghost to
[14:35] these Methodist preachers and so forth
[14:37] here. See, it makes them rise up. Yes,
[14:40] sir. Amen. Hallelujah. Does something to
[14:42] you. It'll never fail. Ahab, that
[14:45] hypocrite. See, he goes over. He says,
[14:47] "Now, if I could just consolidate and
[14:49] I'd get this big nation, and if I marry
[14:51] that old boy's daughter down there,
[14:53] well, that we we'll be friends." What
[14:56] was he doing? Selling his very
[14:57] birthright.
[14:59] Now, when this Protestant church does go
[15:01] back and unite with the Catholic Church,
[15:03] it'll do the same thing it did back on
[15:05] Earth. Amen. Ahab lived in the day that
[15:08] it's been three times. He was in the
[15:11] midnight experience of the journey of
[15:14] Israel. And here it comes to the
[15:17] midnight again. And we come to the
[15:19] midnight again here.
[15:21] Amen. Three generations before this. One
[15:24] year, in here, and in here. Now, if you
[15:28] notice,
[15:29] Ahab married Jezebel to strengthen his
[15:33] people. That's exactly what Constantine
[15:36] did. He set up a great big church and
[15:39] took the altar, made a big marble,
[15:41] dressed this man up, hope, set him up on
[15:44] there. He was a living God. He could
[15:45] talk to him and and tell her about their
[15:48] sins and that just pleased that old
[15:50] lukewarm church and away they went.
[15:52] Sure, that's it. Well, but that didn't
[15:54] please that man who was born again. When
[15:57] they take that and then bring in pagan
[15:58] ceremonies or saying prayers, what did
[16:01] they do? They taken down Jud and put up
[16:03] Peter. They tucked down Venus and put up
[16:06] Mary and it brought it brought paganism
[16:10] into the Christian uh ranks. And when
[16:13] Ahab married Jezebel, he did the very
[16:17] same else. He brought idolatry into
[16:20] Israel. Amen. And what did Jezebel do?
[16:24] She killed every prophet she could get
[16:26] her hands on. Is that right? So did the
[16:30] popes. Amen. Amen. Every true Christian
[16:33] get their hands on the killing. But
[16:35] there was a star of that age. Amen.
[16:39] [Applause]
[16:41] Oh, yes sir. Hallelujah. He wasn't
[16:44] scared to tell him about it.
[16:46] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. He was God's star
[16:50] of that age. Amen. Got down to one time
[16:52] and said, "Lord, I'm the only one left."
[16:54] God said, "Now, wait a minute. Wait a
[16:55] minute. Wait a minute, Elijah. I got 700
[16:58] hit out around in there." See, you don't
[16:59] know where they're at. They're out there
[17:01] in the Pharisees, Sadducees, Baptist,
[17:02] Methodist, and Presbyterians, but I I'll
[17:04] get them out of there. You just wait.
[17:07] I've got them out there. That's they're
[17:08] they're they're mine. They're not bowed
[17:11] to need to bail them yet. But old Elijah
[17:14] was the voice of God in that day. He
[17:16] sure was a very type of the voice of God
[17:18] at the first coming of Christ. It'll be
[17:20] the type of the voice in the second
[17:21] coming of Christ again, according to the
[17:24] scriptures. Now, we find out that this
[17:27] little Jezebel when she got over there,
[17:30] she was really going to tuck down all of
[17:34] the uh altars of God and put up her own
[17:37] altars. And she had Israelites bowing
[17:41] before an idol. That's exactly what
[17:44] Constantine did when he formed the
[17:46] Catholic Church. He brought paganism
[17:49] over into the the Christian church and
[17:52] had Christians bowing to idols. Amen.
[17:57] Exactly. The dark age again. Dark age of
[17:59] Israel. Dark age of of the church bowing
[18:03] to idols. And Elijah was a star in his
[18:06] day. And caused all Israel to worship
[18:10] Bale. And so did the Catholic Church,
[18:12] their Thotyra. Now I want you to notice
[18:15] another thing striking here. I was
[18:16] getting my history here. Jesus
[18:20] said that she was called herself a
[18:24] prophetist. That woman Jezebel who calls
[18:27] herself calls herself a
[18:30] prophetist. Now you see the Catholic
[18:34] church don't permit their people to read
[18:36] the Bible because they say that the
[18:39] priest is the only one that can divinely
[18:41] divine that word. Well, that's true
[18:44] interpretation of a prophet. A prophet
[18:48] has the divine interpretation of God's
[18:51] word. Amen. That's exactly right. How a
[18:55] person can call one somebody a prophet
[18:58] and then say they have the wrong
[18:59] revelation.
[19:01] It's just as much sense as eternal
[19:03] sunship. Again, you see it's it's the a
[19:07] prophet means the correct diver. Amen.
[19:11] The one that the word of the Lord came
[19:13] to. The revelation came to it. The word
[19:15] prophet means a diver of the divine
[19:18] word. Amen. Jesus said, "If there be one
[19:21] among you, spiritual or prophet, our
[19:23] Lord will speak to him. And if what he
[19:25] says comes to pass, then hear him. I'm
[19:26] with him. If it doesn't come to pass,
[19:28] then don't hear him." That's all. It was
[19:30] it was the divine word of God. And the
[19:33] word of the Lord came to the prophets.
[19:35] Now, they said that this church then was
[19:38] a prophet. Now remember, it's changed
[19:40] from this nickel. Now it's changed over
[19:43] to a her. Amen.
[19:47] Amen. You see it? A Jezebel. Now, last
[19:50] night was a doctrine of
[19:53] Balum. See, doctrine of the Nickelians
[19:57] and doctrine of Balum. Now, Balum was
[20:00] the one who made hoarded them with
[20:02] Israel. And what did the u the the do
[20:06] nicadians do? Made the organization. So
[20:08] put them both together and you got a her
[20:11] church. Amen. Sure. Revelation 17, the
[20:15] great horror that sets upon uh many
[20:18] waters. Woman,
[20:21] prostitute. What is she? How is she a
[20:23] prostitute? She's committing
[20:24] fornication, spiritual fornication,
[20:26] misinterp.
[20:29] Get away from that fanaticism. That's
[20:32] real fanaticism.
[20:34] Right. Now see, she calls herself a
[20:37] prophetist. We're the one. We're the
[20:39] council. We're the lady of sin counsel
[20:42] again, the council of man. And we have
[20:45] decided this and this and thus. So you
[20:47] listen to us. But Jes that that little
[20:50] priest up here interviewed me about
[20:52] Elizabeth Frasier or that Frasier girl
[20:54] said um uh the the cardinal wants to
[20:57] know if you are the bishop if you
[20:59] baptize this Frasier girl. Say she's
[21:01] becoming a Catholic. I said, "Yeah, I
[21:02] understand that." said, "Did you baptize
[21:05] her?" I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "How
[21:06] did you baptize her?" I said, "In
[21:07] Christian
[21:09] baptism." He said, 'Well, what do you
[21:11] mean by that? I said, "Christian
[21:12] baptism." The way the Bible says,
[21:13] "There's only one way to baptize in
[21:15] Christian baptism." Amen. Every person
[21:16] in the Bible was immersed under the
[21:18] water in the name of Jesus Christ. He
[21:21] wrote down, started writing down like
[21:22] that, said, "You know, the Catholic
[21:23] Church used." I said,
[21:24] "When?" I said, "I have all the ancient
[21:27] history sure that I could ever get a
[21:28] hold of from London and everywhere else
[21:30] so I can study when this hour will soon
[21:32] approach. when something's going to
[21:34] happen. I said, I I want to know where I
[21:37] he said, oh, he said, in the Bible. I
[21:39] said, you say that. He said, Jesus
[21:40] organized the Catholic church. I said,
[21:42] was Peter the first pope? Said, most
[21:44] certainly. I said, I thought the church
[21:46] was infallible and didn't change and all
[21:48] the masses is said in Latin, so it
[21:49] wouldn't change. He said, that's true. I
[21:51] said, well, you sure done some changing
[21:53] since that time. I said, if that Bible
[21:56] is a Catholic book, then I'm an
[21:57] oldfashioned Catholic. Amen. That's
[22:00] right. I said, "I'm an oldfashioned
[22:02] Catholic then." I said, "It certainly."
[22:04] He said, "Well, now you see the Bible is
[22:06] just the history of the Catholic
[22:07] Church." He said, "God is in his
[22:09] church." I said, "God is in his word."
[22:11] Amen. Right. Let my word be true and
[22:14] every other man's word alive. And here
[22:16] on this book of Revelations is the only
[22:18] book, let me repeat it, that Jesus put
[22:20] his endorsement up on. And the first
[22:23] thing he did was reveal his deity. And
[22:26] he completely does it. And it said,
[22:28] "Anybody that'll take anything out of it
[22:31] or add anything to it, the same will be
[22:33] taken as part of the book of life."
[22:35] Blessed is he that readeth or he that he
[22:37] hearth and cursed is he that'll add one
[22:39] thing to it or take anything away from
[22:41] it. You are. So you see the danger part.
[22:43] So don't ever add nothing to that. Just
[22:45] leave it the way it is and just keep on
[22:47] going. The spirit will reveal it to you
[22:49] if you'll just be humble. Hallelujah.
[22:51] Seeise. That's right. Glory. Nowise. So
[22:54] it's not complicated. God Jesus thanked
[22:57] the father for saying I thank thee
[23:00] father that thou has hid these things
[23:01] from the eyes of the rabbis and the
[23:04] bishops and the cardinals and the gentle
[23:05] overseers and and has revealed to such
[23:08] as learn. See that's what you want. It's
[23:10] a revelation of God that can only come
[23:13] as he said there who does man say I am
[23:15] he said the art the Christ is the son of
[23:16] the living God. He said Simon you never
[23:18] learned that in a seminary. Nobody ever
[23:21] told you that that come was a revelation
[23:24] from heaven and upon this rock I'll
[23:25] build my church and the gates of hell
[23:27] can't prevail against them. Exactly
[23:29] revelation that Abel had in the
[23:31] beginning it's the revelation was then
[23:33] it's still the revelation and it'll
[23:35] always be the revelation. That's right.
[23:37] Now we find out here that she was a
[23:40] woman now and a woman represents a
[23:43] church. Is that right? Christ is coming
[23:45] for a what? Ride. A woman chase virgin.
[23:49] And the old woman here, she claimed
[23:51] herself to be of of the the church of
[23:53] God. But what she was, she was decked in
[23:56] riches and pearl and everything and had
[23:59] a cup of the filthiest of her
[24:00] fornications that she made all the kings
[24:02] drunk upon the wine of it. Is that
[24:04] right?

[57:13] [Music]
[57:18] Amen. How many can say Lord you are
[57:20] worthy this morning.
[57:24] Hallelujah. Blessed be his wonderful
[57:26] name. How many have a unspoken need?
[57:28] Just want to raise that your hand
[57:30] signifying that this
[57:31] morning. Amen. So good to see the
[57:34] Troutman's back this morning with us.
[57:37] Amen. God is so faithful. He's our
[57:39] healer. He's our
[57:41] portion. Amen.
[57:45] Brother Galant is at the prayer request
[57:48] this morning. But just one that I'd like
[57:50] to mention before he takes those is um
[57:55] the Marcato family here in Tucson. Many
[57:57] of you know them. Our son Greg is
[57:59] married to their daughter Hannah. So
[58:01] Hannah's brother Levi was in a a dirt
[58:04] bike motorcycle accident on Friday and
[58:09] um injured his ankle very badly. It was
[58:13] uh bones were broken. It was just tendon
[58:16] that was keeping his his foot attached
[58:17] to his leg. Um so they uh they did
[58:21] surgery yesterday. Um concerned about
[58:24] infection. They were concerned they may
[58:26] have to amputate, but the marcados last
[58:29] night said, you know, our request is
[58:31] that that the Lord will deal with his
[58:34] soul through this. So Levi needs a
[58:36] closer walk with the Lord. And the
[58:38] parents are saying, you know what,
[58:40] whatever it takes. And it's hard as a
[58:42] parent to do that, but that is uh that's
[58:45] where they're at. Lord, if this is what
[58:46] it takes to get Levi's attention. So,
[58:49] let's believe with the Marcato
[58:52] [Music]
[58:53] family. Nothing is too big, too small
[58:56] for our God. I just I love that.
[58:58] Regardless of what we're going
[59:00] through, he's our friend. He's our
[59:03] provider. He's our healer. But they're
[59:06] saying he needs soul healing more than
[59:08] the physical healing. So, let's just
[59:09] believe for both this morning. Amen.
[59:12] Brother Joe, I take the rest that needs
[59:15] for
[59:16] [Music]
[59:20] us. God bless everyone.
[59:24] We also want to
[59:25] remember our sister Annie Anilia is here
[59:29] today and an is going to go for a
[59:31] procedure on Tuesday. So, we want to
[59:34] remember her and continue to remember
[59:36] brother Jim Alexander.
[59:39] uh uh in Mesa and the snow. Sister Lori,
[59:44] brother Snow, let's go to him
[59:47] now. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[59:49] we're we're glad we can come before you,
[59:52] Father, for you're the answer, Lord, to
[59:54] every need, Lord, and through your
[59:57] blood, you made us worthy to stand
[1:00:00] before you. Come, Lord, to your throne
[1:00:02] with
[1:00:03] boldness. And Lord Jesus, we want to
[1:00:07] bring before you Levi, Father, that has
[1:00:09] had this accident,
[1:00:10] Father. Lord Jesus, we pray that the
[1:00:13] doctors would find a way and the nurses
[1:00:15] and Lord, thy holy power, Lord, to save
[1:00:19] that foot, Father. And through it all,
[1:00:22] bring them closer to
[1:00:24] thee, Lord Jesus. Father, all things,
[1:00:28] Lord, there's a reason sometimes and we
[1:00:30] don't understand. But Lord, we just
[1:00:32] commit them into your hands, Father.
[1:00:35] Lord, and for our brother Jim Alexander,
[1:00:37] Lord, the still in the hospital, I
[1:00:40] believe, Father, and Lorie Snow, Father,
[1:00:43] and Brother Snow, Lord, they have storms
[1:00:46] in their life also. And pray, Father,
[1:00:49] that you'd be the peace in their life.
[1:00:51] You'd be the power, Lord, that brings
[1:00:53] them through stronger in you, Lord.
[1:00:55] healed. For you said, Lord, that healing
[1:00:59] was the children's bread, Lord. And
[1:01:01] they're your children, Lord. And we
[1:01:04] declare, Father, them. We declare for
[1:01:06] them the word of God. By your stripes,
[1:01:09] they're healed. Father, let that
[1:01:11] confession be strong in their life also.
[1:01:14] Lord, we know you'll bring us all
[1:01:16] through. Every unspoken request, Father,
[1:01:19] meet every need. Lord, we pray. In the
[1:01:22] name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen.
[1:01:28] [Music]
[1:01:41] Wonder if we can sing that song. The
[1:01:44] name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[1:01:46] Righteous run into it and they are safe.
[1:01:49] David said, "Some trust in chariots,
[1:01:51] some in horses, but we will remember the
[1:01:54] name of the Lord our God." And he said a
[1:01:57] couple verses before that, "We'll
[1:01:59] rejoice in thy salvation. In the name of
[1:02:01] our God, we will set up our banners. The
[1:02:04] Lord fulfill all thy petitions." So, I'm
[1:02:07] glad we have that assurance and we come
[1:02:08] to him. He wants us to come to him. And
[1:02:11] since we we don't have because we don't
[1:02:13] ask. So, we've asked him this morning
[1:02:16] and we've got to let's claim the name of
[1:02:18] the Lord this morning. Amen. The name of
[1:02:20] the Lord
[1:02:23] is a strong tower.
[1:02:27] The righteous run
[1:02:29] into him and they are
[1:02:34] saying the name of the Lord
[1:02:39] is a strong
[1:02:42] tower. The righteous run
[1:02:45] into it and they are safe. How I love
[1:02:50] the
[1:02:51] name. How I love the name of the Lord.
[1:02:57] How I love the name of the
[1:02:59] Lord. How I love the name of the Lord
[1:03:04] most
[1:03:07] high. How I love the name of the
[1:03:11] Lord. Oh, how I love the name of the
[1:03:15] Lord. Yes. How I love the name of the
[1:03:19] Lord. Amen. There's healing in the name
[1:03:21] of the Lord. Yes, there's healing in the
[1:03:25] name of the
[1:03:26] Lord. There's healing in the name of the
[1:03:30] Lord. There's healing in the name of the
[1:03:34] Lord. Most
[1:03:38] high. There's healing in the name of the
[1:03:42] Lord. There's healing in the name of the
[1:03:46] Lord. There's healing in the name of the
[1:03:49] Lord. most high. Let's sing one more.
[1:03:52] There's deliverance in that name this
[1:03:54] morning. Deliverance in the name of the
[1:03:57] Lord. There is deliverance in the name
[1:04:01] of the Lord. There's deliverance in the
[1:04:04] name of the
[1:04:06] Lord most
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:10] high. There's deliverance in the name of
[1:04:13] the
[1:04:14] Lord. Deliverance in the name of the
[1:04:17] Lord.
[1:04:19] Deliverance in the name of the Lord most
[1:04:23] high. Oh Jesus is the name of the
[1:04:30] Lord. Jesus is the name of the
[1:04:34] Lord. Jesus is the name of the Lord most
[1:04:42] high. Yes. Jesus is the name of the
[1:04:45] Lord.
[1:04:47] Jesus is the name of the
[1:04:50] Lord. Jesus is the name of the Lord most
[1:04:58] high. Amen. You can be seated this
[1:05:01] morning. We'll just sing a that song. I
[1:05:03] never shall forget today as our pastor
[1:05:06] comes this morning. Tim and Emma are
[1:05:08] going to be gone for a couple the next
[1:05:10] couple Sundays, next few Sundays
[1:05:13] vacationing. So, we want to get our
[1:05:15] little workout at the Tim this morning
[1:05:17] before he leaves. I never shall forget
[1:05:20] the
[1:05:21] day. Amen. Long years
[1:05:24] ago, went out in
[1:05:27] sin, I had no
[1:05:30] hope, no peace within.
[1:05:34] down on my
[1:05:36] knees in
[1:05:39] agony. I prayed to Jesus and he gladly
[1:05:44] set me
[1:05:46] free. I never
[1:05:49] shall forget the
[1:05:52] day. When
[1:05:55] Jesus rolled my sins
[1:05:58] away, it made me
[1:06:02] happy, glad, and
[1:06:05] free. I'll sing and shout it for he's
[1:06:09] everything to me now. I can feel him by
[1:06:11] my side. I can
[1:06:14] feel him by my side.
[1:06:18] my feeble
[1:06:21] stands. He comes to
[1:06:24] guide. Trials
[1:06:27] come. He comforts
[1:06:32] me. I have the victory.
[1:06:37] I never
[1:06:40] shall forget the
[1:06:43] day when all the burdens of my soul were
[1:06:47] rolled
[1:06:49] away. It made me
[1:06:52] happy, glad, and
[1:06:55] free. I'll sing and shout it. For he's
[1:06:59] everything to me.
[1:07:03] Oh sinner,
[1:07:05] come to Jesus
[1:07:08] now and at his
[1:07:11] feet. Just humbly
[1:07:14] bow. Confess to
[1:07:17] him your every
[1:07:21] sin. He'll save and cleanse you. Give
[1:07:24] you joy peace within.
[1:07:28] I never
[1:07:30] shall forget the
[1:07:33] day when all the burdens of my soul were
[1:07:38] rolled
[1:07:40] away. It made me
[1:07:43] happy, glad, and
[1:07:46] free. I'll sing and shout it for
[1:07:50] everything to me.
[1:07:53] The seals were
[1:07:55] broke in
[1:07:59] 63. I saw my
[1:08:02] name and I
[1:08:05] believe there is no
[1:08:08] doubt of who I
[1:08:11] am. I am a son of God. I'm truly one of
[1:08:17] them.
[1:08:19] I never
[1:08:21] shall forget the
[1:08:24] day when all the burdens of my soul were
[1:08:29] rolled
[1:08:30] away. It made me
[1:08:34] happy, glad and
[1:08:37] free. I'll sing and shouting glories
[1:08:41] everything to me. Sing that chorus
[1:08:43] again. I never
[1:08:46] shall forget the
[1:08:49] day when all the burdens of my soul were
[1:08:54] rolled
[1:08:56] away. It made me
[1:08:59] happy, glad and
[1:09:02] free. All sing and shouted for is
[1:09:06] everything to me.
[1:09:25] Hallelujah.
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:10:00] Heat.
[1:10:23] Heat. Heat.
[1:10:27] [Music]
[1:10:49] Heat. Heat.
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:12] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:36] [Music]
[1:11:39] [Applause]
[1:11:42] to me. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:11:44] praise.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:48] Amen. How many can remember when the
[1:11:50] Lord set you free?
[1:11:53] I never shall forget the day
[1:11:58] when the burden of my soul had rolled
[1:12:02] away.
[1:12:06] It makes me happy.
[1:12:12] Glory and
[1:12:13] hallelujah. I'll sing and shout it
[1:12:18] for everything.
[1:12:23] Amen. Amen. Let us pray. Heavenly
[1:12:25] Father, as we come into your presence,
[1:12:28] Lord, singing your
[1:12:31] praises. May you bless us, Lord, now
[1:12:34] with your word as it comes forth, anoint
[1:12:37] us, Lord Jesus, with all of the good
[1:12:40] things you have in store for your
[1:12:42] children. You know what we have need of,
[1:12:45] Lord. And we didn't come here just to be
[1:12:49] seen, Lord. But we need something from
[1:12:52] you. Grant that to every heart that's
[1:12:55] gathered here. May no one leave here
[1:12:59] disappointed. May they receive from the
[1:13:01] great Holy Spirit. We ask in Jesus'
[1:13:05] name. Amen. Amen. So, the Lord bless
[1:13:09] each of you richly. I'm so happy to be
[1:13:11] back home here on the Sunday morning
[1:13:14] with you. Um we had a wonderful time in
[1:13:17] Liberia and we bring you greetings from
[1:13:19] the saints there and uh they're just a
[1:13:22] wonderful group of people and we've had
[1:13:25] just a a great time with them. I gave a
[1:13:28] small report on Wednesday
[1:13:31] uh just of the our trip and the time
[1:13:34] that we had there with those believers
[1:13:36] and they definitely send their greetings
[1:13:39] to each of you. It's a developing
[1:13:42] country. this the country of Liberia,
[1:13:45] the main city is um
[1:13:47] Monrovia, named after President uh James
[1:13:51] Monroe. And he had started a movement
[1:13:57] for the
[1:13:58] freed Africans, free a
[1:14:01] African-Americans to repopulate this
[1:14:03] portion of Africa. And that's the
[1:14:04] history of Liberia. And so, um, I think
[1:14:08] two ships were sent back with the slaves
[1:14:12] that were freed into Monrovia or
[1:14:15] Liberia. And so, their flag is very
[1:14:18] similar to ours. It's the same colors.
[1:14:20] It has a constitution the way we have.
[1:14:23] Um, they they speak English. It's their
[1:14:25] first language. And then they have other
[1:14:28] little dialects and so forth. That just
[1:14:31] gives a brief history. And the most
[1:14:34] important part is they believe this
[1:14:36] message with all their heart.
[1:14:38] What is so nice is we're not contending
[1:14:41] with whether or not to put Brother
[1:14:43] Random's pictures up or take them down.
[1:14:45] Not over there. They believe it just
[1:14:48] like it's on the tapes. And so
[1:14:51] if you're not careful, you know, being
[1:14:54] an American, you think that you have an
[1:14:57] edge on people and we do in technology
[1:15:00] and you know, maybe our cities are more
[1:15:02] advanced and so forth, but they have all
[1:15:05] the tapes that you have and when they
[1:15:08] read the message, God speaks to them.
[1:15:11] And I and I can say this, and some of
[1:15:14] you might be shocked, there's some
[1:15:16] pastors over there that can really come
[1:15:18] here and teach some of us how to follow
[1:15:20] this message.
[1:15:23] Because God is no respector of persons.
[1:15:27] If you believe it, God will bless you.
[1:15:30] No matter what your language is, no
[1:15:31] matter where you from, no matter what
[1:15:34] accent you have, if you take God at his
[1:15:37] word, God will bless you. And I see this
[1:15:40] blessing over their lives. So I join
[1:15:42] with them 100%. My heart is with them.
[1:15:44] They've heard the apostasy that we hear
[1:15:47] of and those that are leaving the
[1:15:49] message and brother Adam did this wrong.
[1:15:50] And those brothers and brothers that
[1:15:53] started a lot of that here had tried to
[1:15:55] bring those back into those countries
[1:15:57] and those brothers handled it like we
[1:15:59] handle it here. We put it in the garbage
[1:16:02] can and we stay with the message. Amen.
[1:16:05] Amen. So God bless you. I bring you
[1:16:07] greetings from the saints there in
[1:16:10] Liberia. If the Lord willing I and it
[1:16:12] works out, I'll bring some pictures and
[1:16:14] maybe take an afternoon one time and and
[1:16:17] go a little bit deeper into that
[1:16:19] country. I want to I thank the young
[1:16:22] people. It surprised me. I saw your
[1:16:23] little thank you card out there and it
[1:16:26] welcome home. And so, thank you so much.
[1:16:29] I appreciate that. And I certainly
[1:16:32] appreciate your prayers, you know, to be
[1:16:34] able to leave and know that the
[1:16:37] saints are not upset with me for not
[1:16:40] being here on
[1:16:41] Easter. I certainly appreciate your
[1:16:44] prayers and uh I don't choose to be
[1:16:47] gone, especially not Easter and and
[1:16:51] especially I I wasn't there on the
[1:16:52] vacation. and I was there preaching and
[1:16:54] so I appreciate you praying for me and
[1:16:58] giving me that support and giving me
[1:17:00] that liberty to go. Amen. I haven't
[1:17:04] heard it. Maybe someone does have an
[1:17:06] attitude, but I haven't heard it or felt
[1:17:07] it. So, God bless you. I'll try to stay
[1:17:10] home a little bit more, but this was
[1:17:13] needful for me to go. they uh the
[1:17:15] brothers there, you know, being an
[1:17:17] American, they look to you that maybe
[1:17:19] you have some insight more than they do,
[1:17:22] but when you sit and break bread with
[1:17:24] them, they believe this message.
[1:17:28] They know the quotations. So, you just
[1:17:30] can't, you know, I love that. I so
[1:17:33] appreciate that. And um of course, we do
[1:17:36] have, I mean, we we know believers that
[1:17:39] are here in this congregation that met
[1:17:41] Brother Brandham. We we've been to
[1:17:43] Sabino Canyon, Sunset Mountain, Brandham
[1:17:46] Tabernacle, and many of these believers
[1:17:48] will never get the opportunity to even
[1:17:51] come to the US. So, they won't even see
[1:17:54] those places. So, the next next best
[1:17:57] thing is if they can find somebody who
[1:17:59] has seen them and they love that. And
[1:18:03] so, when you share those testimonies
[1:18:05] with them, they so appreciate it. And
[1:18:08] that's so nice. I'm recharged. I'm re
[1:18:11] revived. I can go another 100,000 miles,
[1:18:14] I think. So, I'm so glad to be back with
[1:18:18] you. Love you all so much and appreciate
[1:18:20] you. Appreciate brother the deacon board
[1:18:23] and the the trustees that hold their
[1:18:26] post of duty. It makes it so easy for
[1:18:29] me. Brother Joe, Brother Galante,
[1:18:32] Brother Ben, the trustees, Brother
[1:18:35] Chris, Brother Scott, and then the
[1:18:37] brothers who lead the song services and
[1:18:39] the musicians. I certainly appreciate
[1:18:41] that that you come to the house of the
[1:18:43] Lord to serve the bride of Christ. And
[1:18:46] it's easy, it's easy to stay home,
[1:18:49] especially if you know I'm not there,
[1:18:51] the pastor is not there, then you want
[1:18:52] to go visit or go here or go there. But
[1:18:54] I appreciate the saints that that hold
[1:18:57] hold it down for us. and God bless you
[1:19:01] richly. So, we have communion tonight.
[1:19:04] Uh, everyone is welcome. We'll go to the
[1:19:06] table of the Lord and remember that. I
[1:19:09] think we skipped last month and so we'll
[1:19:11] have the opportunity to do that tonight.
[1:19:16] Amen. If you're happy and you know it,
[1:19:18] say amen. Amen. Amen. If you're happy
[1:19:21] and you know it, then your face will
[1:19:24] surely show it.
[1:19:26] Amen. Can I get a smile this morning?
[1:19:29] Oh, that's so nice. God bless you. All
[1:19:32] right, so let's stand and go to the word
[1:19:34] of the Lord in our bulletin. Psalms
[1:19:37] 34. Brother Joe has that in there. And
[1:19:40] I'd like to take verses 1 through 11. if
[1:19:44] we
[1:19:45] could read that as a
[1:19:51] class. Welcome any visitors that are
[1:19:54] here for the first time
[1:19:57] and God bless you richly. We're so happy
[1:20:00] to have you with
[1:20:03] us.
[1:20:05] Psalms 34. This is one of my mother's
[1:20:08] favorite Psalms. this Psalms
[1:20:12] 34 and it says
[1:20:15] this. I'll take the first verse and the
[1:20:19] class you read al together the second
[1:20:21] verse and we'll read the 11th verse al
[1:20:24] together. I will bless the Lord at all
[1:20:26] times. His praise shall continually be
[1:20:29] in my mouth.
[1:20:38] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[1:20:41] exalt his name together.
[1:20:49] They looked unto him and were lightened
[1:20:52] and their faces were not ashamed.
[1:21:01] The angel of the Lord encampeth around
[1:21:03] about them that fear him and deliverth
[1:21:07] them.
[1:21:14] Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints, for
[1:21:17] there is no want to them that fear him.
[1:21:26] that shall not
[1:21:29] altogether. Come ye children, hearken
[1:21:32] unto me. I will teach you the fear of
[1:21:36] the Lord. Amen. God add blessing to the
[1:21:39] reading of his word. We'll take one more
[1:21:41] scripture in
[1:21:42] Ephesians chapter 1.
[1:22:02] verse number
[1:22:05] three. Blessed be the God of our father.
[1:22:08] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:22:11] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[1:22:14] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:22:18] places in Christ, according as he hath
[1:22:21] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:22:23] of the world, that we should be holy and
[1:22:26] without blame before him in love, having
[1:22:30] predestinated us into the adoption of
[1:22:32] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:22:36] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:22:38] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:22:41] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:22:45] in the beloved. Amen. in whom we have
[1:22:48] redemption through his blood, the
[1:22:51] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[1:22:52] riches of his grace, wherein he hath
[1:22:56] abounded towards us in all wisdom and
[1:22:58] prudence, having made known unto us the
[1:23:02] mystery of his will, according to his
[1:23:05] good pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[1:23:08] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[1:23:11] fullness of time, he might gather
[1:23:13] together in one all things in Christ,
[1:23:18] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:23:21] on earth, even in him, in whom also we
[1:23:26] have obtained an
[1:23:29] inheritance, being predestinated
[1:23:32] according to the purpose of him who
[1:23:35] workketh all things after the counsel of
[1:23:39] his will.
[1:23:41] We have obtained an inheritance and that
[1:23:45] inheritance is the third pool
[1:23:47] inheritance. That's what we're going to
[1:23:49] talk about this morning. May God bless
[1:23:52] the reading of his word. You may be
[1:23:54] seated. Amen. Now, this book
[1:23:59] of Ephesians parallels Joshua. Brother
[1:24:03] Brandham tells us and in the adoption
[1:24:06] message he says this and I brought this
[1:24:09] on Wednesday and on Thursday partly and
[1:24:13] Mesa and here
[1:24:15] um the prophet of God says this in the
[1:24:18] adoption part
[1:24:21] one paragraph number six he says Bible
[1:24:24] teaching is usually a little treacherous
[1:24:27] a little you know kind of walking out on
[1:24:29] thin ice we call it but we just feel
[1:24:32] that maybe at this point, at this time,
[1:24:36] it might be good to kind of bring the
[1:24:37] church to what I think a complete
[1:24:41] understanding
[1:24:43] positionally of what we are in Christ
[1:24:46] Jesus. And sometimes I think that
[1:24:48] preaching is a wonderful thing, but I
[1:24:51] believe sometimes, brother Beer, that
[1:24:53] teaching goes far beyond that and kind
[1:24:57] of especially to the church. Now
[1:25:00] preaching usually catches the sinner,
[1:25:03] brings him under condemnation by the
[1:25:05] word, but teaching places a man
[1:25:09] positionally.
[1:25:13] Amen. What he is. And we can never
[1:25:16] rightly be able to have faith until
[1:25:20] positionally we know what we are. Now,
[1:25:24] isn't that beautiful how the prophet of
[1:25:27] God highlights teaching and it's
[1:25:30] actually the Holy Spirit that does the
[1:25:32] teaching. He's the teacher. It's not the
[1:25:35] Sunday school teacher. It's not the
[1:25:37] pastor. It's not the preacher. It's not
[1:25:39] so much your mom or your dad, but it's
[1:25:41] the Holy Spirit that does the teaching.
[1:25:45] And the teaching is to stabilize the
[1:25:50] believer. Actually the teaching is what
[1:25:53] separates us from the other nominal
[1:25:56] Christians. The nominal churches can
[1:25:59] praise and worship. They can sing. They
[1:26:03] can shout. They can go to church. They
[1:26:05] can do all the things that a normal
[1:26:07] Christian does. But the teaching, if
[1:26:10] it's been given by revelation, this is
[1:26:14] what separated Cain and Abel. The way
[1:26:17] they worshiped was based on what the
[1:26:20] Holy Spirit taught one and the other one
[1:26:23] did not get by the Holy Spirit. The Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit taught Abel that it was blood.
[1:26:29] And so his sacrifice was reflected upon
[1:26:32] what the Holy Spirit had taught him. Has
[1:26:35] the Holy Spirit taught you anything? Oh,
[1:26:38] I'm so glad that the Holy Spirit is our
[1:26:40] teacher. He'll teach you things that the
[1:26:43] university can never teach you. He'll
[1:26:46] teach you things that you can't teach
[1:26:47] yourself. He'll teach you things that
[1:26:50] you can't find on the internet or some
[1:26:53] cheap knowledge. He'll teach you things
[1:26:56] by the spirit. And that will equip you
[1:27:00] for to have the faith that you need. You
[1:27:04] can't really have faith until you know
[1:27:06] your position. You got to know that
[1:27:08] you're a son of God. You're not just an
[1:27:10] anybody. You're not just halfway just
[1:27:13] mossing along. He predestinated you
[1:27:16] because you're a son and a daughter of
[1:27:19] God. And the Holy Spirit teaches us
[1:27:22] that. The Bible teaches us that and so
[1:27:26] the prophet highlights teaching. And so
[1:27:28] we should highlight it, too. Now,
[1:27:30] teaching isn't just for the preacher.
[1:27:33] Can I get a witness? It's not just for
[1:27:35] the men in the church. It's not just for
[1:27:38] the old-timers. Teaching is for the
[1:27:40] believer. The scripture commands us to
[1:27:44] study to show oursel approved. A workman
[1:27:48] that needeth not be ashamed. That's what
[1:27:51] the Bible says. You got to take that
[1:27:53] word and go read it, study it, and the
[1:27:57] Lord will bless you in that.
[1:27:59] You know, you might not be able to
[1:28:00] understand all the details of the ins
[1:28:03] and the outs, but as a believer, you
[1:28:06] start by reading the word of the Lord,
[1:28:08] and he will open up his understanding to
[1:28:11] you. Maybe you're not a maybe you're a
[1:28:13] slow learner in a school. Maybe you're a
[1:28:15] fast learner. Maybe you have high IQ.
[1:28:17] Maybe no IQ at all. But if you're a
[1:28:20] believer, the Holy Spirit will teach you
[1:28:21] something. He'll He'll teach you how to
[1:28:25] have faith when unbelief strikes you.
[1:28:28] He'll teach you how to claim your
[1:28:30] healing when sickness strikes your body.
[1:28:33] He'll teach you not to be afraid of what
[1:28:36] the enemy tries to throw your way
[1:28:39] because you're a believer. Amen. And the
[1:28:42] Holy Spirit will teach you that. How
[1:28:45] many to say, Lord, teach me this
[1:28:47] morning.
[1:28:49] Amen. So, he's given us an inheritance.
[1:28:51] And this a beautiful inheritance that
[1:28:53] he's given to us. Um I like to take a
[1:28:57] scripture over in 1 John chapter 4. And
[1:29:00] we normally take
[1:29:03] John and know him as the apostle of
[1:29:08] love. He talks about the love of God and
[1:29:12] loving one
[1:29:13] another and chapter 1, chapter 2,
[1:29:16] chapter 3. But then in 1 John chapter 4,
[1:29:22] he brings in a reminder to us
[1:29:26] and that is this in chapter 4 verse one.
[1:29:30] And this is what a true believer you you
[1:29:33] know you you don't want to only take one
[1:29:35] side of the scripture that would be
[1:29:38] taking away or adding. And so as a
[1:29:40] believer we have to take everything that
[1:29:43] the word has given us on every subject
[1:29:46] on any subject. Now, so if I'm only
[1:29:50] quoting to you the legalistic side of
[1:29:54] the Bible, well, I'm not being honest
[1:29:56] because it's not all legalism.
[1:29:59] There is a grace side, too. And if I'm
[1:30:02] only teaching you grace, grace, grace,
[1:30:04] and that you don't have to do nothing.
[1:30:06] There's no works. In fact, in that
[1:30:08] church age that we're listening to for
[1:30:10] our Sunday school, brother Bannam, uh he
[1:30:13] points out that works is mentioned four
[1:30:15] times in that Thitarian church age. That
[1:30:19] works are part of our salvation. And if
[1:30:22] you get rid of the works, then you you
[1:30:24] know you're out of balance there again
[1:30:26] too. But I like what John says here in
[1:30:29] verse number one. says,
[1:30:30] "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[1:30:34] try the spirits whether they are of God,
[1:30:38] because how many? Many false prophets
[1:30:42] are gone out into the world." So, we're
[1:30:45] not talking about the drug dealer. We're
[1:30:47] not talking about the guy who owns the
[1:30:50] bar. We're not talking about the
[1:30:52] scandalous girl or this one and that.
[1:30:54] We're talking about a prophet that
[1:30:57] teaches falsely. Amen. And the the the
[1:31:01] apostle here is warning us not to
[1:31:04] believe every spirit because many false
[1:31:08] prophets are going out into the world.
[1:31:10] Look at verse two. Hereby know ye the
[1:31:12] spirit of God. Every spirit that
[1:31:15] confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in
[1:31:17] the flesh is of God. And every spirit
[1:31:20] that confesses not that Jesus Christ has
[1:31:22] come in the flesh is not of God. And
[1:31:25] this is that spirit
[1:31:27] of antichrist. Say it with me.
[1:31:31] Antichrist whereof you have heard that
[1:31:34] it should come. So you heard that it
[1:31:37] should come. And even now already is it
[1:31:41] in the world. Amen. Ye are of God,
[1:31:46] little children, and have overcome them
[1:31:50] who the false prophets, false teachers,
[1:31:53] all of their foolishness. You overcome
[1:31:55] them because greater is he that is in
[1:31:58] you than he that is in the world. So, we
[1:32:03] thank the Lord for that, don't we? We
[1:32:05] know that there's an antichrist. We know
[1:32:07] that it was supposed to come. We know
[1:32:08] that it is already here. But we know
[1:32:11] that we are of God and we overcome those
[1:32:16] antichrist spirits because greater is he
[1:32:19] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:32:23] world.
[1:32:25] Now this great uh inheritance that the
[1:32:29] Lord has given to us.
[1:32:32] Brother Brandham shares with us what
[1:32:35] this inheritance is in the
[1:32:39] adoption number two. And he says this in
[1:32:42] paragraph number 12. It says this here.
[1:32:46] Praise the Lord. Adoption number two.
[1:32:49] Paragraph number 12. He says this right
[1:32:52] at the
[1:32:53] beginning. There's so much we can say
[1:32:55] here. I'll just take a highlight of it
[1:32:57] if I can.
[1:32:59] He
[1:33:00] says, "Now tonight our scripture is
[1:33:03] dividing the book of Ephesians is the
[1:33:05] book of Joshua of the New Testament.
[1:33:08] It's dividing up and setting in order
[1:33:10] the overcome ones." Now, it's just it's
[1:33:14] just a background for a few moments to
[1:33:16] get to the place we start
[1:33:18] reading paragraph 13. And now when the
[1:33:21] time of the promise drew nigh, God
[1:33:23] raised up someone to bring them to that
[1:33:26] land. How many in class know tonight who
[1:33:29] that one knows who that one was? Moses.
[1:33:33] Notice a very very real type of our one
[1:33:36] that was given to bring us to the
[1:33:37] promised land. Now we have a promise cuz
[1:33:41] our promise is
[1:33:44] spiritual rest where their theirs was
[1:33:48] physical rest. And so they was coming to
[1:33:51] a land that they could say this is our
[1:33:54] land. We are no more wanderers. We've
[1:33:58] settled down. This is our land. And here
[1:34:02] we have rest. We plant our corn, our
[1:34:05] vineyards. We'll eat from our vineyards.
[1:34:08] Then when we pass on, we'll leave it to
[1:34:10] our children. And oh, how we can go into
[1:34:13] the land of the laws of inheritance like
[1:34:15] Naomi and Ruth, Boaz, bring all that
[1:34:18] back. How breth in Israel, how that
[1:34:21] anything he had lost must be redeemed by
[1:34:24] a kinsman. Oh, how beautiful. Paragraph
[1:34:28] 17, just drop right down. He says, Paul
[1:34:30] told the Romans said, "Believe on the
[1:34:32] Lord Jesus Christ, and thou and thy
[1:34:35] house shall be saved." If you got faith
[1:34:38] enough for your own self to be saved,
[1:34:41] have faith enough. No matter how wavered
[1:34:44] that boy is or that girl is, they'll be
[1:34:47] saved anyhow.
[1:34:50] God somehow if he has to lay them on
[1:34:53] their back, laying there in a hospital
[1:34:55] dying, they'll be saved. God promised it
[1:34:59] the
[1:35:01] inheritance and they shall be there.
[1:35:04] Isaiah said, "And all their offsprings
[1:35:06] with them, they shall not hurt nor
[1:35:09] destroy." How important is this
[1:35:11] inheritance to you? This is our
[1:35:14] inheritance. For Israel, it was physical
[1:35:17] land. For us, it's spiritual land. There
[1:35:21] are things that belong to us by the
[1:35:24] spirit, and our family is one of them.
[1:35:28] And we care and we concern about our
[1:35:30] family, don't we? But God promised those
[1:35:33] children to us. He promised it. It
[1:35:36] belongs to us and we claim it. And it's
[1:35:40] not an easy going. It's not somebody
[1:35:42] going to give it to you. You got to go
[1:35:44] take that promise. You got to go pick up
[1:35:46] the scriptures that talk about salvation
[1:35:48] to your loved ones. Pick them up and
[1:35:51] read them. Read them until you get
[1:35:54] emotional. Read it until you feel it in
[1:35:56] your bones. Read it out loud. Read it in
[1:35:59] the morning. Read the scriptures that
[1:36:02] claim your family and then stand up and
[1:36:06] claim it. Say, "Lord, you gave me those
[1:36:09] children. Lord, you promised it to me
[1:36:13] and my family belongs to me. I claim
[1:36:16] every one of them. Even the nieces and
[1:36:19] the nephews, second cousins, first cous,
[1:36:22] if it's my family, I claim them. I claim
[1:36:25] every one of them for your glory, for
[1:36:28] your honor, and for your praise. That's
[1:36:31] my inheritance.
[1:36:33] This is our land. A beautiful example of
[1:36:37] this as we went through their with the
[1:36:39] young people on
[1:36:41] Friday. There's a beautiful little
[1:36:43] example of these sisters found over in
[1:36:49] Numbers chapter 27. If we can turn there
[1:36:53] quickly, these little
[1:36:56] sisters, the daughters of the
[1:37:02] Loiad. How many know where I'm
[1:37:06] going? How many know where I'm going?
[1:37:08] Well, there's one. There's
[1:37:11] two. How many don't know where I'm
[1:37:14] going? Now, all you young people that
[1:37:16] was in the Bible study on Friday, where
[1:37:18] you at?
[1:37:20] You should know exactly where I'm going.
[1:37:22] All right. Numbers 27.
[1:37:24] Quickly. I love this because this
[1:37:28] expands
[1:37:30] beyond somebody telling you what you can
[1:37:33] have. Uh-huh. Numbers. What did I say?
[1:37:39] Numbers. Is that what I want? Yeah,
[1:37:43] that's what I want. Numbers
[1:37:45] 27. Verse number one.
[1:37:49] Then came the daughters Z of Zilofiad,
[1:37:52] the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,
[1:37:54] the son of Mar, the son of Manasseh, of
[1:37:58] the family of Manasseh, the son of
[1:38:00] Joseph. And these are the names of his
[1:38:03] daughters, Mahala, Noah, Ola, Milka, and
[1:38:08] Tiraza. And they stood before Moses and
[1:38:10] said before Eleazar the priest and
[1:38:14] before the princes and all the
[1:38:15] congregation by the door of the
[1:38:17] tabernacle of the congregation saying
[1:38:20] our father died in the wilderness and he
[1:38:24] was not in the company of them that
[1:38:26] gathered themselves together against the
[1:38:28] Lord in the company of Kora but died in
[1:38:31] his own sin and had no sons. Why should
[1:38:35] the name of our father be done away from
[1:38:38] among his family because he hath no
[1:38:42] son? Give unto us therefore a
[1:38:46] possession among the brethren of our
[1:38:49] father. And Moses brought their cause
[1:38:52] before the Lord. And the Lord spake unto
[1:38:54] Moses, saying, The daughters of
[1:38:58] Zeilof speak rightise.
[1:39:02] Thou shalt surely give them a possession
[1:39:05] of their inheritance among their
[1:39:07] fathers, brethren, and thou shalt cause
[1:39:10] the inheritance of their father to pass
[1:39:13] unto them. Thou shalt speak unto the
[1:39:16] children of Israel, saying, If a man die
[1:39:18] and have no son, then ye shall cause his
[1:39:22] inheritance to pass unto his who? His
[1:39:27] daughter. And if he have no daughter,
[1:39:30] then he shall give his inheritance unto
[1:39:32] his brethren. And if he have no
[1:39:34] brethren, then he shall give his
[1:39:35] inheritance unto his father's brethren.
[1:39:36] And if his father have no brethren, then
[1:39:38] he shall give his inheritance unto his
[1:39:41] kinsmen that is next to him, of his
[1:39:44] family, and he shall possess it, and it
[1:39:46] shall be unto the children of Israel, a
[1:39:50] statute of
[1:39:52] judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses. I
[1:39:56] like these sisters.
[1:39:58] I like these sisters. I like their
[1:40:00] spirit. I like their desire for the
[1:40:04] promises to fall upon them. There was no
[1:40:07] statue or judgment for them. But they
[1:40:11] can ask
[1:40:12] anyways. They asked Moses, "How how can
[1:40:15] this be? We have no brothers. My dad had
[1:40:18] no sons. And how is this name gonna
[1:40:21] prolong? How can we keep this alive?"
[1:40:23] And so Moses says, "You know, I never
[1:40:25] thought about that." Well, of course,
[1:40:27] you wouldn't think about it because it's
[1:40:29] not your problem, but this is their
[1:40:32] problem and this is their desire. So,
[1:40:34] they brought it to the prophet and the
[1:40:37] prophet brought it to the Lord. And the
[1:40:40] Lord said, "These sisters speak right
[1:40:44] now. We'll make a judgment and a statute
[1:40:47] for them, and we will create a ma a way
[1:40:51] for them. We'll make a provision for
[1:40:54] them. And this shall h this is how it'll
[1:40:56] be for the rest of Israel going on. See,
[1:41:00] this is how faith moves you. Yes. Amen.
[1:41:03] You find the promise, the Lord will make
[1:41:06] a way for you to have it.
[1:41:10] You might not have no examples in the
[1:41:12] church that can identify with your
[1:41:15] situation.
[1:41:16] And you might not have anybody that can
[1:41:18] testify to what you're going through.
[1:41:21] But if you bring your cause to the Lord,
[1:41:24] He will create a way for you out of no
[1:41:28] way because that's the God that we
[1:41:31] serve. You approach him in faith and he
[1:41:34] will make a provision for your case if
[1:41:37] he's got to create a new statute in
[1:41:39] judgment. We see it right here in the
[1:41:41] Old Testament. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:45] Everybody can get something from the God
[1:41:46] that I serve. Yeah. Even believe
[1:41:50] unbelievers, God will make a way for
[1:41:52] them. Amen. Give them if they have
[1:41:55] faith. I love that. And so these are
[1:41:59] teachings. These daughters must have
[1:42:02] been taught what the inheritance was.
[1:42:05] Amen. They had a knowledge of what was
[1:42:08] going on here. He's being blessed. They
[1:42:11] being blessed. They all g's my blessing.
[1:42:14] So, they had a knowledge somewhere and
[1:42:16] it was a scriptural desire and they
[1:42:18] brought it to the Lord and the Lord
[1:42:20] says, "Okay, y'all are right. We forgot
[1:42:23] we forgot about y'all when we made the
[1:42:25] laws, but we'll create a statue for you
[1:42:28] here today."
[1:42:30] Now, can we have that faith in the
[1:42:33] promises of God today? Can you? Yes, you
[1:42:37] can. If you're a believer, believers
[1:42:40] believe. That's what they do. Now, amen.
[1:42:43] Let's go a little bit further. This
[1:42:46] taking the scriptures and studying them
[1:42:49] and believing for them is the
[1:42:52] commandment that the scripture gives us
[1:42:54] to study the word of the Lord so that we
[1:42:58] can know what these promises are to us.
[1:43:01] So that we can know what belongs to us.
[1:43:03] Because just, you know, shouting,
[1:43:07] praising, and enjoying the atmosphere of
[1:43:10] the Holy Spirit, that's great, but
[1:43:12] that's not
[1:43:13] enough to move the enemy off of your
[1:43:16] property. That's not enough to place you
[1:43:21] positionally as a believer. My sister,
[1:43:25] God has a place for you and it's found
[1:43:28] in the scriptures. And you need to
[1:43:30] identify your place in the
[1:43:33] scripture. Not your emotions, not your
[1:43:36] past, not what everybody else is doing,
[1:43:39] but your position in the scriptures.
[1:43:41] Brethren, the same thing. God has a
[1:43:44] position for you, and that is in the
[1:43:46] word of the Lord. And so, the teaching
[1:43:48] of the word is what places the believer.
[1:43:51] Amen. Gives him a foundation on where to
[1:43:55] stand. Hopefully, a pastor has that
[1:43:58] position. Hopefully a trustee or a
[1:44:00] deacon has that position. Hopefully a
[1:44:03] newcomer, an old-timer, a believer has a
[1:44:07] position in the scripture that
[1:44:10] identifies who they are.
[1:44:13] We're not just on our feelings. I feel
[1:44:15] saved today. How many know there's some
[1:44:17] days you don't feel saved? How there's
[1:44:20] some days you just don't you know which
[1:44:22] way you don't even know if you're even a
[1:44:23] believer. There's some days that you
[1:44:25] just feel
[1:44:27] horrible and you know your faith isn't
[1:44:30] where it should be. But the scripture
[1:44:33] says he will not lose one of them. And
[1:44:36] that he called you not to lose you. He
[1:44:39] called you to justify you, to glorify
[1:44:43] you, to take you on over into the
[1:44:46] greater and deeper things in God. And
[1:44:48] once you know that in the scripture, you
[1:44:50] know how to stand.
[1:44:52] Amen. Yes. Amen. We can't serve the Lord
[1:44:55] emotionally.
[1:44:58] I feel like my ministry is good, so I'll
[1:45:00] preach today. Let me look and see how
[1:45:02] many saints are out there. Is there
[1:45:03] enough? Yeah, I can preach today. I can
[1:45:06] lead songs today. Well, how many who's
[1:45:07] going to be there? I don't know if I can
[1:45:09] lead songs or not. Depends on who's
[1:45:10] going to be there. No. No. You have a
[1:45:14] post. You have your position. And the
[1:45:16] scriptures identify that for you. Amen.
[1:45:19] Praise the Lord. We don't do it
[1:45:20] emotionally. We do it scripturally.
[1:45:22] Amen. So the prophet of God
[1:45:26] takes
[1:45:28] before some of his greatest teaching
[1:45:31] messages arguably one of them spoken
[1:45:33] word is the original seed. The other one
[1:45:36] the church ages the series that he
[1:45:39] preached and the other the series on the
[1:45:44] revelation of the seven seals. Great
[1:45:47] mysterious things. And here is how
[1:45:49] brother Brandham approached those
[1:45:50] series. And I could take out of the
[1:45:53] Pergamian church age and here's what he
[1:45:55] says here. Paragraph number
[1:45:57] 35. Now I think that was all. Now
[1:46:00] remember tomorrow night we're on another
[1:46:02] church age each night. And I'm
[1:46:06] sure that we could have plenty of time
[1:46:08] tomorrow to run all day long on this and
[1:46:12] then tomorrow night too. But see many of
[1:46:14] them will be working and I'll try just
[1:46:16] to get the very highlights of this
[1:46:18] message. hit the spots that spoke of
[1:46:21] here, which you can take one of them and
[1:46:24] just keep on run it out till there's
[1:46:27] just no telling where it would go. You
[1:46:29] see, and then you study it out at home.
[1:46:34] Amen. And I'll be praying for you and
[1:46:38] you be praying for me. And God bless us
[1:46:41] together as we his believing
[1:46:44] children. He says this in the spoken
[1:46:47] word is the original seed. Prograph 458.
[1:46:49] And remember, I've told you the truth. I
[1:46:52] thank you for sitting here all this day
[1:46:54] since early this morning. Many of you
[1:46:56] standing around the walls and the halls
[1:46:58] yet feet and legs are cramping sitting
[1:47:01] out in the cars. Your batteries run down
[1:47:03] almost from listening. And here it is.
[1:47:06] It's all on tape. The boys has taped it
[1:47:09] back there. You'll be able to get it.
[1:47:12] And if you do get it, take it home and
[1:47:15] study it real closely,
[1:47:18] wisely, and see what the Lord will
[1:47:20] reveal to you.
[1:47:22] Amen.
[1:47:24] Paragraph,
[1:47:26] 122 in the message, God hiding in
[1:47:29] simplicity. Here he is again. So he's
[1:47:32] bringing in the uh uh uh the the message
[1:47:36] um just as he's bringing in the seals,
[1:47:38] the series on the seals, paragraph 124.
[1:47:41] I read this for you all before, but I
[1:47:43] want to read it to you again just to
[1:47:44] bring the importance of it. Now study
[1:47:47] that. Study it all. And you people who
[1:47:50] are visiting here, when you go to your
[1:47:53] motel rooms, take those things and
[1:47:55] ponder over them.
[1:47:57] We don't have time to break it down as
[1:47:59] it should be broke down, but I want you
[1:48:02] to do it when you get to the motel or
[1:48:05] hotel or wherever you're staying or the
[1:48:09] home. Gather together and study over it.
[1:48:15] Now, who's telling who's telling us this
[1:48:17] now? This is the prophet now telling us
[1:48:19] this. Amen.
[1:48:21] Amen.
[1:48:23] Um, praise the Lord.
[1:48:28] Levi, can you get my backpack out of my
[1:48:30] office for me, please? I need that.
[1:48:31] Paragraph 64. Many of them I see are
[1:48:34] writing. I want you to get this one
[1:48:36] here. Don't watch Levi. Look at this
[1:48:38] quote here. Paragraph 64. It says, "Many
[1:48:41] of them I see are writing." They got
[1:48:44] their books and writing the scriptures
[1:48:47] down, marking them in their Bible for a
[1:48:50] chain. So that's fine.
[1:48:53] I like for you to do that. Then go home
[1:48:57] and study it. And if you study it
[1:49:00] yourself, then you'll understand it
[1:49:03] better. See, just study it and ask God
[1:49:06] to help you to understand.
[1:49:10] Oh, that's so nice. So, the discipline
[1:49:14] of study belongs to the believer.
[1:49:18] That's not just
[1:49:20] brothers. That's sisters, too.
[1:49:24] That you could study the word of the
[1:49:26] Lord. Not so you can argue it, not so
[1:49:29] you can be smarter, but you're feeding
[1:49:31] on the word of God. Your spirit man
[1:49:34] needs to hear it. Amen. He They need He
[1:49:38] needs to hear it. And that's what it was
[1:49:40] designed to do. And the prophet here in
[1:49:43] the seals is now telling us that. Thank
[1:49:45] you. Just bring it right on. Thank you.
[1:49:47] All right. Thanks. Very
[1:49:51] good. And the first seal at the
[1:49:54] beginning, he says this here in his
[1:49:57] prayer, paragraph number one, he opens
[1:49:59] in
[1:50:02] prayer and he he he he says the same
[1:50:06] thing. I'm just to save a little bit of
[1:50:07] time. He he's saying the same thing
[1:50:09] about, you know, for the Holy Spirit to
[1:50:13] reveal it. Then at the last of the first
[1:50:16] seal, paragraph 409, I will read this.
[1:50:19] He says this here. We pray God that
[1:50:22] you'll take these words now that has
[1:50:24] been said and make them real to the
[1:50:27] people. Let them see it, Lord, being
[1:50:30] pinched for time and you know, Father.
[1:50:34] So I pray that enough has been said that
[1:50:36] the Holy Spirit will take it and reveal
[1:50:39] it into hearts. Those who are writing
[1:50:44] the scriptures down, may they study
[1:50:47] them. Those who are making tapes or
[1:50:49] hearing the tapes, may they study it.
[1:50:51] Not put their own interpretation to it
[1:50:53] now, but just study the word. Grant it,
[1:50:56] Father, in Jesus name. Amen. Can you
[1:51:01] say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:51:04] Study it. Is that right?
[1:51:07] Study it. Write the scriptures down. He
[1:51:09] says, "That's what I want you to do.
[1:51:13] That's what a believer does. Is that
[1:51:14] right?
[1:51:16] They study to show themselves approve a
[1:51:20] workman that needeth not to be ashamed.
[1:51:25] And so the word of the Lord has been
[1:51:26] given to us. This great seven seal
[1:51:29] mystery. I think in hearing it, we are
[1:51:33] just making ourselves aware of it
[1:51:36] consciously, subconsciously. We put on
[1:51:39] that series. Brother Brandon preached it
[1:51:42] not to just ministers, not to just
[1:51:44] pastors, but the entire congregation was
[1:51:47] there when he preached the seals.
[1:51:50] And that discipline of study is
[1:51:53] something that you that's where your
[1:51:56] teaching comes. Now, this is where is
[1:51:59] where you get settled now as a believer.
[1:52:02] Amen. Is through the nuts and bolts of
[1:52:05] the ministry of the of the message. And
[1:52:08] brother Vanom says this in the second
[1:52:10] seal paragraph
[1:52:14] 223. Don't take Satan's unbelieving
[1:52:18] mark. Now he'll put it on you tonight if
[1:52:20] he can do it. He'll poke you up against
[1:52:23] the wall and you'll walk and say, "Aw, I
[1:52:26] don't know about that." You go home and
[1:52:28] study it and then be sincere and pray
[1:52:32] cuz everything is too perfectly
[1:52:34] scriptural at this very hour. Amen. This
[1:52:38] sacred hour of time, it's done been for
[1:52:41] years proved. Come right up to it. And
[1:52:45] this is the hour. This is the
[1:52:49] time. Praise the
[1:52:51] Lord. Oh my. I think I need your help
[1:52:54] again,
[1:52:55] Levi. One more time. I need the white
[1:52:58] cord that's plugged into the behind my
[1:53:01] desk. Thanks, son. I think I raised him
[1:53:04] very well. So he will obey. So God bless
[1:53:09] you. Let's take questions and answers
[1:53:11] just for a moment. In
[1:53:14] 1954 and brother Bam gives the warning
[1:53:17] about studying too much.
[1:53:20] And I think there that you know that
[1:53:22] balance of you know so well I'm not a
[1:53:24] minister. It's the seven seals. It's too
[1:53:27] much. It's too deep. It's too much. It's
[1:53:29] it's so profound and that all those
[1:53:32] things are true. So they'll ne the belie
[1:53:35] many believers will never pick it up and
[1:53:37] just put it on their natural ear. But
[1:53:40] there's a blessing in the whole tape.
[1:53:43] There's testimonies. There's hunting
[1:53:44] stories. There's a leadup tool. And you
[1:53:47] get something out of every aspect of
[1:53:49] there. If it isn't just seeing how
[1:53:52] disciplined the prophet was about
[1:53:54] bringing his text to the people and him
[1:53:57] not adding his own interpretation,
[1:54:00] that's something you'll learn just by
[1:54:02] listening to him. and watching how he
[1:54:04] respected the Bible, respected the
[1:54:07] people. You can get that by listening to
[1:54:10] the Seven Seal series. Amen.
[1:54:14] Don't let the devil fool you and keep
[1:54:18] those messages on the shelf. You go pick
[1:54:20] those up. You listen to those. The Lord
[1:54:24] has something for every one of us. Now,
[1:54:27] we're not all preachers. We're not all
[1:54:28] teachers. We're not theologians. God
[1:54:30] never called us to be that. But we can
[1:54:33] receive something,
[1:54:36] something more than we had before.
[1:54:38] Questions and answers. Number one, 1954,
[1:54:40] the prophet of God says this. Now, I'll
[1:54:43] admit that people study too much and try
[1:54:45] to go too far ahead and try to think too
[1:54:48] hard and sometimes have mental
[1:54:50] breakdowns and things on account of
[1:54:54] studying about the Lord. You must quit
[1:54:57] that. You don't have to do that. The
[1:55:00] only thing you have to do is fall in
[1:55:02] love with him. Hallelujah. And just go
[1:55:04] right on loving him. Amen. It's not
[1:55:08] trying to push into something or make
[1:55:11] yourself something you're not. Just go
[1:55:14] ahead and let God use you in the way he
[1:55:18] wants to.
[1:55:20] Just yield yourself, commit yourself,
[1:55:23] and walk on happy singing, rejoicing.
[1:55:28] That's the way. Thank you, sir.
[1:55:31] Amen. So, we just fall in love with him.
[1:55:34] Is that right?
[1:55:37] A little power here on my iPad.
[1:55:43] Okay. How many want to know what I'm
[1:55:45] doing?
[1:55:47] All right. Mind your business.
[1:55:50] Okay. God bless
[1:55:52] you. Oh my. I'm so glad to be back home.
[1:55:56] I'm just right at home. All right. So
[1:55:58] the prophet tells us that you can do
[1:56:01] that. You can study too much about the
[1:56:02] Lord and and you're trying to make
[1:56:04] you're trying to push yourself into
[1:56:06] something. I remember as a young
[1:56:08] minister, the brothers were preaching on
[1:56:10] a certain thing. I come out of
[1:56:11] California and they would preach on this
[1:56:13] great revelation and brother Ezekiel, I
[1:56:15] try to make myself see it and the
[1:56:18] pressure was for me to preach like how
[1:56:19] they're preaching, but it wasn't a
[1:56:22] revelation that the Lord really borne
[1:56:24] within my heart. I was just saying it
[1:56:27] because the group I was with was saying
[1:56:29] it. The phrasiology, the same thing. And
[1:56:33] I didn't have really any context where
[1:56:35] it came to me on my
[1:56:37] knees where I was listening to the tape
[1:56:40] and it came to me. I was just quoting
[1:56:43] other brothers and and that's part of it
[1:56:45] you have to learn. You know, it's like a
[1:56:47] little kid watching his dad. He's
[1:56:49] imitating and this and that. But there's
[1:56:51] a time when the Lord has to reveal that
[1:56:54] to you. And when he reveals it to you,
[1:56:56] then it's a revelation and you can just
[1:56:58] be who you are. And I'm so glad I don't
[1:57:01] have to be like nobody but what the Lord
[1:57:04] made me and what he gave me in the word.
[1:57:07] I am free to say it with all of my
[1:57:11] heart. And I'm not afraid of any of the
[1:57:13] quotes.
[1:57:15] That's beautiful, brother Ben. There is
[1:57:18] no quote that offends me. Bring it and
[1:57:22] I'll say amen to it. Amen. And that's
[1:57:25] the true believer. That's the liberty
[1:57:26] you have. And so you don't push yourself
[1:57:29] to try to make you see something. You
[1:57:32] just, you know, the Lord brings um the
[1:57:36] truth to
[1:57:38] you. Now in John, he speaks of this
[1:57:43] antichrist to come. We see it again over
[1:57:45] in Thessalonians chapter 3.
[1:57:55] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2
[1:58:01] rather we'll hear the Apostle Paul say
[1:58:04] this here. Now we beseech you brethren
[1:58:08] if you have it say amen. Amen. Now you
[1:58:11] we see you, brethren, by the coming of
[1:58:13] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[1:58:14] gathering together unto him, that you be
[1:58:18] not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled.
[1:58:22] Amen. Neither by spirit, nor by word,
[1:58:25] nor by letter, ask from us, as that the
[1:58:28] day of Christ is at hand.
[1:58:32] Let no man deceive you by any means, for
[1:58:36] that day shall not come except there
[1:58:39] come a falling away first and the man of
[1:58:43] sin be revealed, the son of predition.
[1:58:47] So we see this falling away to happen.
[1:58:50] We read the entire chapter of second
[1:58:52] Peter chapter 2 for you on Wednesday
[1:58:55] verses 1 all the way through. How many
[1:58:58] remember that? It's a powerful
[1:59:00] scripture. Talked about how they once
[1:59:02] knew the way and then they've turned
[1:59:05] from the holy commandment. So, we're not
[1:59:07] talking about street people or
[1:59:10] worldlyism in that sense. We're talking
[1:59:13] about people who are supposed to be one
[1:59:15] of us. We're talking about the wolves in
[1:59:18] sheep's clothing or wolves in pastor's
[1:59:22] clothing. Wolves, they hide under the
[1:59:26] ministry. They think they act like
[1:59:28] they're one of us, but they really
[1:59:30] aren't. And the scripture gives us this
[1:59:34] warning. And what's it trying to do?
[1:59:36] Take away our faith from the real divine
[1:59:41] inheritance that God has given to us in
[1:59:44] this day. This great inheritance, you
[1:59:47] hear brother Brandon bring it to us as
[1:59:50] the third pool. It was the highlight of
[1:59:53] his ministry, the revealing of the seven
[1:59:58] seals. First pull, second pull, and the
[2:00:02] third pull. In the seventh seal, he
[2:00:05] begins to open to us what that seventh
[2:00:09] seal, what that third pull was. And
[2:00:12] we'll pick it up in there in paragraph
[2:00:14] number 278 in the seventh seal. We'll
[2:00:16] hear what the prophet of God says here.
[2:00:19] Now remember, he had already preached,
[2:00:24] "Sir, what time is it?" There was a
[2:00:26] great blast that took place and he
[2:00:29] didn't know what the blast meant. He
[2:00:31] didn't know if it would meant his the
[2:00:33] end of his ministry or that he would be,
[2:00:36] you know, he'd be leaving the earth or
[2:00:38] he didn't know. And the Lord had to
[2:00:40] reveal to him there was a great
[2:00:42] revelation the seven seals would be open
[2:00:46] to the people. And so let's just take
[2:00:49] this as I see my time waning to share
[2:00:54] this with you.
[2:00:56] Amen.
[2:00:58] Now, now, can I say something here
[2:01:01] before I get into
[2:01:02] this? This seventh seal that I'm going
[2:01:05] to I'm going to read to you just for a
[2:01:07] moment. There's there's a portion where
[2:01:11] it ends in the vision of the tent. Look
[2:01:15] at your neighbor and say tent.
[2:01:18] vision.
[2:01:20] You know what's interesting in Liberia?
[2:01:22] When I ask them to look at their
[2:01:23] neighbor and say whatever, they'll keep
[2:01:26] saying and saying and I'm done with the
[2:01:28] clause and I'll go on and they'll just
[2:01:30] keep repeating
[2:01:31] me. I got to stop and it's like, okay,
[2:01:34] now we're done on the repeating part.
[2:01:37] So, but you know, that's quite
[2:01:39] interesting. So this tent vision uh you
[2:01:44] have to say there was a tent vision
[2:01:45] because brother Brandham said there was
[2:01:48] and you know there's raised eyebrows or
[2:01:50] what you call here he come now what are
[2:01:52] you going to say now you know the word
[2:01:54] of the lord shouldn't do that to you you
[2:01:57] should be
[2:01:59] embracing any of these subjects is that
[2:02:03] right I believe so it's the only the
[2:02:06] devil that puts a scarecrow around a
[2:02:09] vision
[2:02:11] or around a truth.
[2:02:13] But as a believer, you have nothing to
[2:02:15] be afraid of. In fact, this is your
[2:02:17] salvation. This is your protection. This
[2:02:21] is what God gave you.
[2:02:24] Something to talk about, something to
[2:02:26] believe for. And he has this great
[2:02:29] vision. And I'll say this here, you
[2:02:31] know, uh, as a as a young brother coming
[2:02:33] up in a ministry, one of the fears that
[2:02:36] I had surrounded around me was the
[2:02:39] church age book. And many people had
[2:02:42] said that it's not brother Brandham's
[2:02:44] book. It's not the same as the actual
[2:02:46] series that he preached. And so I took
[2:02:48] the church age book, by the way, was the
[2:02:50] book that I came into the message on. It
[2:02:52] was good enough to bring me in. So, I
[2:02:55] took that church age book and I put it
[2:02:56] to the shelf as brother Lee Bell's book
[2:02:58] because Reverend so and so said there's
[2:03:00] mistakes said Reverend so and so said
[2:03:01] it's not valid. Reverend so and so blah
[2:03:03] blah blah blah blah. So, I put that
[2:03:06] church age book on the shelf and even
[2:03:10] still today I have a hard time with
[2:03:11] certain parts of it because somebody
[2:03:14] swed the seed of you know that it's not
[2:03:18] fully valid message material even
[2:03:22] quoting from it. It's like, "Well,
[2:03:23] Brother Brandon didn't say that." Well,
[2:03:25] let me ask you, if I wrote a book,
[2:03:27] couldn't you quote and say that I said
[2:03:29] it if I wrote the book? Run it through
[2:03:32] your mind. If it's my book and I wrote
[2:03:34] it, I have to own what's in that book.
[2:03:37] If it is my book, and it might not be a
[2:03:40] verbatim quotation like that, but I'm
[2:03:42] quoting myself in the book, whatever it
[2:03:45] is. Can I get a witness? Amen. And so I
[2:03:48] I know there's some of you that are on
[2:03:50] the edge of this and maybe in Phoenix
[2:03:53] some of the brothers might be on the
[2:03:54] edge of this because I know it's a it's
[2:03:56] a a position that people take. But can I
[2:03:59] read for you what brother Brandham said
[2:04:02] about the church age book? And then
[2:04:04] you'd have to say the only reservation
[2:04:08] that I'm having about the church age
[2:04:10] book had to come from somebody else
[2:04:12] because it didn't come from brother
[2:04:14] Brandham.
[2:04:17] And if it's okay to have a reservation
[2:04:20] on the church age book and we have the
[2:04:22] quotes on it, then it's okay for the
[2:04:24] brothers to have a reservation on the
[2:04:26] tent vision.
[2:04:33] None of us have a message. He said it or
[2:04:36] he didn't say it. If he said it, then I
[2:04:40] am not going to give my allegiance to
[2:04:43] Reverend so and so
[2:04:46] for what? What do I have? What's the
[2:04:48] skin off my nose? What am I going to
[2:04:50] lose? Say what the tape say.
[2:04:54] Can I read for you here? So why am I
[2:04:56] doing this? I'm trying to boost your
[2:04:59] faith in all of the message. All of it.
[2:05:03] No matter how interpreted, whatever what
[2:05:05] it means, I can't tell you. But you got
[2:05:08] to start with saying that every word is
[2:05:10] true and it belongs to you. You don't
[2:05:13] picking up the church age book thinking,
[2:05:14] well, this ain't right and that ain't
[2:05:16] right. I don't think that was the design
[2:05:17] of the church age book. I believe
[2:05:20] brother Bradam sent it and he put his
[2:05:21] name on it. He issued it out to the
[2:05:24] people for our betterment.
[2:05:27] Amen. So, let's take what the prophet
[2:05:30] said. Enough of me. Let's hear what he
[2:05:33] says. Or you all want me to close now?
[2:05:38] I believe I'll close. You want me to
[2:05:39] close? Keep going.
[2:05:43] I'll keep going
[2:05:45] then. God bless you. Somebody said,
[2:05:49] "Bring it on.
[2:05:52] Okay, God bless you, saints. I just have
[2:05:55] to relax myself, so my I do those little
[2:05:58] things. So, just pray for me. All right.
[2:06:01] The prophet of God says this. In 1965,
[2:06:04] February the 17th, a man running from
[2:06:06] the presence of the Lord. He says, "Then
[2:06:09] the seven church ages has been f
[2:06:12] finished." Is that right, brother Vale?
[2:06:14] and on print now. And I'll know you want
[2:06:17] to get them because they answer a lot of
[2:06:21] questions that's been in your hearts.
[2:06:24] And then after that, we'll we're going
[2:06:26] to try to get the seven seals open, you
[2:06:29] know, in the book so that each one can
[2:06:32] read it read in form that they that they
[2:06:36] want to can understand and study it. I
[2:06:41] think when it's rolled out it and
[2:06:43] brother Adam continues on the anointing
[2:06:45] was at the end time paragraph 261. I'm
[2:06:48] watching my time. God bless you. Now
[2:06:51] Lee, there comes your name on the book.
[2:06:53] See, you got it fixed out. And that's
[2:06:58] um not here and now and the hookups is
[2:07:02] Dr. Lee Vale sitting here. He's
[2:07:04] grammarizing this book of the seven
[2:07:06] church ages and the problem will come up
[2:07:09] or the question about your name taken
[2:07:11] off the lamb's book of life. See, it's
[2:07:14] puzzled a lot of ministers. But wait
[2:07:16] till you get the book. You'll understand
[2:07:19] it if you just got any light in you.
[2:07:24] See, that's anointed ones at the end
[2:07:27] time. This is 1965. Remember, he
[2:07:29] preached the church ages in the 60s, 5
[2:07:32] years prior. So now he's talking about
[2:07:35] his church age book. He's not talking
[2:07:37] about the tapes that he had already
[2:07:39] recorded. We know that's thus said the
[2:07:41] Lord. We know it's valid. But the enemy
[2:07:43] wants to make the church age book
[2:07:46] something secondarily to brother
[2:07:48] Branna's message and it was brother
[2:07:50] Brandham's book. It was his idea to have
[2:07:53] the book and we have it today and so we
[2:07:56] use it today. Sure. Invisible union of
[2:07:59] the bride of Christ 1965.
[2:08:03] last series. But brother Bannon brings
[2:08:06] in paragraph 205. He says here it brings
[2:08:09] into view the two books that's going to
[2:08:11] be mysterious to you when you read the
[2:08:14] book of the seven church ages. The two
[2:08:16] books, the book of life, the ones you
[2:08:18] could put your name on. It never comes
[2:08:21] off. So he's referring to that book,
[2:08:23] some of the things that would be
[2:08:25] mysterious to you. And he explains it in
[2:08:28] 1965.
[2:08:30] He continues on. I've heard but now I
[2:08:33] see. November 27th in that same series
[2:08:37] that he brought the invisible in union.
[2:08:39] I've heard but now I see. Trying to do
[2:08:40] God a service. All those wonderful
[2:08:43] messages. He says this here in paragraph
[2:08:45] number 40. I'm glad tonight to have
[2:08:48] another associate brother with us. Just
[2:08:50] looked around and recognized then and
[2:08:52] seen him a few minutes ago. Brother
[2:08:54] Gordon Lindseay. He's one of the
[2:08:56] old-timers who was with us a long time
[2:08:58] ago doing a great job printing. He's
[2:09:02] printing my book now. The seven church
[2:09:06] ages. We hope to have it ready again.
[2:09:09] The seven seals. If he happens to read
[2:09:12] that before he prints it, we're going to
[2:09:14] have a theological discussion. I can
[2:09:17] just feel it coming. Brother Random
[2:09:19] says, "Amen." And trying to do a God of
[2:09:22] service without it being his will. 1965,
[2:09:25] brother Bham says
[2:09:26] this. You all seen in my book, it'll all
[2:09:30] be drawn out in the seven church ages
[2:09:33] which he told me, which I stand by as a
[2:09:37] witness to God to be judged at the day
[2:09:41] of judgment for it. It come from God,
[2:09:45] not from my thinking. Notice here I
[2:09:48] thought I thought different from that if
[2:09:50] I was going to have my own thought.
[2:09:54] Amen. How many can say praise the Lord?
[2:09:57] So any reservation on the church age
[2:09:59] book didn't come from brother Brandham.
[2:10:01] So where did it come from? This is the
[2:10:03] question I have. Even some of the
[2:10:06] terminology we use to classify whatever
[2:10:10] doctrine we're following. If brother
[2:10:13] Brandham didn't coin the phrase, then
[2:10:16] why am I wearing it? That's a question
[2:10:19] I'd like you to internalize and ask that
[2:10:21] question for yourself. So, I believe
[2:10:24] this. Does he believe this? And we
[2:10:26] coined these little phrases that didn't
[2:10:28] come from brother Brandham didn't do
[2:10:29] that. Either you believe all the word or
[2:10:32] you don't. I have no labels that I'm
[2:10:34] interested in wearing other than being a
[2:10:36] Christian that believes every word.
[2:10:40] I had a question come to me here a
[2:10:43] couple years ago. Said, "Brother Israel,
[2:10:45] I heard this that you're uh you believe
[2:10:48] the return." And I was playing with
[2:10:50] them. I says, "What do you mean by
[2:10:52] return?
[2:10:54] I need more information than that."
[2:10:58] Are you talking about the
[2:10:59] visions? Oh, let's talk about them.
[2:11:02] Because I believe every one of them.
[2:11:05] Amen. You can label whatever group. I
[2:11:08] don't know where some of these labels
[2:11:10] come from and I don't have a problem
[2:11:11] with them. Please understand. I don't
[2:11:14] have a problem with them. But ask
[2:11:15] yourself, where did it come from? If it
[2:11:18] didn't come from the message, ask
[2:11:20] yourself, where did it come from? You're
[2:11:21] holding so dear to it, too. Ready to
[2:11:24] fight?
[2:11:26] Look at some of the folks that claim to
[2:11:29] believe every word. Some of them
[2:11:32] believe the vision of the tent. They
[2:11:35] believe that. They said they believed it
[2:11:37] and some of those very ones are saying
[2:11:39] it's being fulfilled now in
[2:11:43] Jeffersonville.
[2:11:45] Yes. And then some of them are saying
[2:11:48] that it's spiritual. It's to come. It
[2:11:50] can't be literal. It's spiritual. It's
[2:11:52] taking place at the bride now. Where all
[2:11:54] these where's all this coming from?
[2:11:57] Amen. And I've come up with and make a
[2:11:59] statement like that. You better ask me,
[2:12:01] brother Israel, where is the quotation?
[2:12:04] Take title and paragraph, please.
[2:12:08] And if the prophet didn't bring it, ask
[2:12:10] yourself the question, who is teaching
[2:12:13] us this?
[2:12:16] Amen.
[2:12:18] So, I stay with the word. And that's our
[2:12:20] that's our commitment to stay with the
[2:12:22] word, not emotional groups, not people
[2:12:24] we're tied to, not people we like. We
[2:12:27] stay with the word. Yes. And the
[2:12:30] teaching of the Holy Spirit will teach
[2:12:32] us to do that. It's a tremendous
[2:12:36] discipline as a Christian not to add or
[2:12:39] take away from the scripture. And
[2:12:42] because many have done that, that's why
[2:12:44] we have all the different groups that we
[2:12:46] have today because they violated that
[2:12:48] principle of not adding or not taking
[2:12:51] away from. Can we just say amen to what
[2:12:56] he said? Amen. Can we?
[2:12:59] Amen, somebody. Yes. Okay. God bless
[2:13:03] you.
[2:13:06] So, let's look at this third pull just
[2:13:09] for a moment as I close with it. As the
[2:13:12] prophet is bringing the seventh seal
[2:13:16] understanding, the seventh seal of
[2:13:18] revelation to us in the series, the
[2:13:23] revelation of the seven seals, the
[2:13:25] prophet of God says this
[2:13:29] here.
[2:13:31] Okay, where do I start? So, he's
[2:13:35] bringing all the six seals. He brought
[2:13:37] questions and answers on the seals. And
[2:13:40] then now he's bringing the the seventh
[2:13:42] seal. And he says this in paragraph 258.
[2:13:45] I'll just have to re hit a few
[2:13:47] highlights and I trust it'll be a
[2:13:48] blessing to you. If you want something
[2:13:51] to happen, you'll have to take my word
[2:13:53] for this. If I'm planning on doing
[2:13:54] something, I know better than to tell
[2:13:56] anybody about it. Not that the person
[2:13:59] would tell it, but Satan will hear it.
[2:14:02] Amen. He can't get it in my heart there
[2:14:06] as long as God has got it closed up with
[2:14:09] the Holy Spirit. So that's between me
[2:14:12] and God.
[2:14:14] See, he don't know nothing about it
[2:14:16] until you speak it. Then he hears it.
[2:14:19] And I tell people, I'll do a certain
[2:14:21] thing and watch the devil cut off every
[2:14:24] will he can to get there. See, to beat
[2:14:27] me to it. But if you can get the if I
[2:14:29] can get the revelation from God and just
[2:14:31] don't say nothing about it, then it's
[2:14:32] different. Remember, Satan will try to
[2:14:36] impersonate.
[2:14:38] That's the point I want to bring. He
[2:14:40] will try to impersonate. He'll try to
[2:14:44] impersonate everything that the church
[2:14:47] will do. He's tried to do it. We notice
[2:14:51] it through the Antichrist. Here's that
[2:14:54] word again.
[2:14:57] Hm. But this is one thing he cannot
[2:15:01] impersonate. There will there will be no
[2:15:04] mimics to this. See, cuz he can't. He
[2:15:07] don't know it. There's no way for him to
[2:15:10] know it. It's what?
[2:15:14] The third pull. Say it with conviction.
[2:15:16] It's the third pull. He just knows
[2:15:20] nothing about. But Reverend so and so
[2:15:22] said he knows. Pastor so and so said he
[2:15:25] knows. The prophet said he don't know.
[2:15:28] It's the third pool. He just knows
[2:15:30] nothing about it. See, he doesn't
[2:15:32] understand it.
[2:15:35] Now, to be real clear and open and
[2:15:37] honest with you, I'm just reading out of
[2:15:39] the seven seal message that he's
[2:15:41] bringing to us what this third pull is.
[2:15:44] He makes comments before that. He makes
[2:15:46] comments after that. But I'm just going
[2:15:48] to bring this little section that he's
[2:15:51] bringing as he's bringing the revelation
[2:15:53] of the seventh seal to us. All right.
[2:15:59] Amen. So, Brother Man continues on. He's
[2:16:02] giving the the background and how that
[2:16:05] great blast took place. He didn't know
[2:16:09] what was taking place. Paragraph
[2:16:12] 278. How many's ever been to Sabino
[2:16:15] Canyon? Here, the prophet says this. One
[2:16:18] morning I got up and went up in Sabino
[2:16:21] Canyon, those great rugged high
[2:16:23] mountains. And I went up there. There's
[2:16:25] a little foot trail after you lead off
[2:16:27] and go up into Lemon Mountain, which is
[2:16:30] 30 mile walk near about 30 foot of snow
[2:16:34] up there. So up in the mountain real
[2:16:36] early before day going up through this
[2:16:39] little foot trail, rolling rocks along,
[2:16:42] I felt led to turn this way. I turned
[2:16:45] and went up into some great jagged
[2:16:47] rocks. Oh my, hundreds of feet high. I
[2:16:51] knelt down between those rocks. I laid
[2:16:54] down this Bible and laid down this this
[2:16:57] little
[2:17:00] tablet and I said, "Lord God, what does
[2:17:03] this vision mean?" I I said, "Lord, it
[2:17:07] does it mean my dying? Does it mean my
[2:17:11] dying?" And you remember I told you I
[2:17:13] thought it might mean my death because
[2:17:16] something exploded till it just shook me
[2:17:18] to pieces. You remember it? How many
[2:17:21] knows it have heard it? Congregation
[2:17:23] says, "Amen." Why, sure. See all of you.
[2:17:27] And I thought it could mean my death.
[2:17:29] And then in the room, what was it, Lord?
[2:17:32] What does it mean? Does it mean I'm
[2:17:34] going to die? If it is, all right. I
[2:17:36] won't tell my family. Just let me go on.
[2:17:38] See, if my work is finished now, what
[2:17:41] was it? But he sent a witness back. You
[2:17:44] remember me telling you that it wasn't
[2:17:46] that? It was the furtherment of my work.
[2:17:49] You get it? And sitting up in Sabino
[2:17:52] Canyon, the heavenly father knows this.
[2:17:54] Just as true as you see that come to
[2:17:56] pass. Those angels come right down and
[2:17:59] vindicated every message to be the same.
[2:18:02] Then you know whether it comes from God
[2:18:04] or not. It was fortold you by a vision.
[2:18:09] I couldn't tell you until the services
[2:18:13] over cuz I was forbidden to. What a
[2:18:17] discipline.
[2:18:18] What a discipline
[2:18:20] in Sabino Canyon. Sitting up there that
[2:18:22] morning, I had my hands up and my the
[2:18:26] wind had blowed my old black hat down.
[2:18:29] When I was standing there with my hands
[2:18:30] up praying, I said, "Lord God, what does
[2:18:33] this mean? I can't understand it. Lord,
[2:18:36] what am I to do? If it's my going home
[2:18:39] time, let me go up here is where they'll
[2:18:41] never find me. I don't want nobody
[2:18:43] mourning around. If I'm going, I wanted
[2:18:46] just the family to think I just took a
[2:18:47] walk and they won't find me. Hide me
[2:18:49] away somewhere. If I'm going to go away,
[2:18:53] let me go. Maybe Joseph will find my
[2:18:55] Bible laying here someday and let him
[2:18:58] use it. See, if I'm going away, let me
[2:19:00] go, Lord. And I have my hands out and
[2:19:03] all at once something hit my hand. I
[2:19:07] don't know. I can't say. Did I go to
[2:19:08] sleep? I don't know. Did I go into a
[2:19:10] trance? I don't know. Was it a vision? I
[2:19:13] can't tell you. Only thing I can say is
[2:19:16] just the same thing like them angels
[2:19:18] was. It struck my hand and I looked and
[2:19:23] it was a sword and it had a pearl
[2:19:25] handles, real pretty, had a guard over
[2:19:29] it with gold and the blade looked like
[2:19:32] something like chrome like silver only
[2:19:34] was real shiny and it was so feathered
[2:19:37] sharp. Oh my. I thought, isn't that the
[2:19:39] prettiest thing just fit my hand? I
[2:19:42] thought that's awful pretty. But I said,
[2:19:45] "Hey, I'm always afraid of them things."
[2:19:47] A sword. I thought, "What will I do with
[2:19:49] that?" Just then a voice shook down
[2:19:52] through there that rocked the rock said,
[2:19:54] "It's the sword of the king." Then I
[2:19:57] come out of it. The sword of the king.
[2:20:00] Now if it is said a sword of a king, but
[2:20:02] it said the sword of the king. And there
[2:20:05] is only one the king, that's God. And
[2:20:10] he's one. He has one sword. That's his
[2:20:14] word. What I live by. That's so help me.
[2:20:18] God standing over his holy desk here
[2:20:20] with this holy word laying here. It's
[2:20:23] the word. Amen. Oh, what a day we're
[2:20:27] living in. What a great thing. See the
[2:20:28] mystery and the secret. The third
[2:20:31] standing there. When this left me,
[2:20:32] something just come to me and said,
[2:20:35] "Don't fear." Now, I didn't hear no
[2:20:37] voice like on the inside of me spoke. I
[2:20:40] have to just tell you the truth just
[2:20:41] exactly what happened. Something hit and
[2:20:44] said, "Don't fear. This is that third
[2:20:47] pull."
[2:20:50] Third pull. You remember it?
[2:20:52] Congregation says, "You've had so many
[2:20:54] impersonators on this what you tried to
[2:20:57] explain, but says don't even
[2:21:01] try this." You remember? You remember
[2:21:04] it? How many remembers that vision?
[2:21:06] Amen. Why? It's all over. It's taped
[2:21:09] everywhere. That's been about six years
[2:21:11] ago. 7 years ago. Been seven years ago.
[2:21:16] Don't try to explain that. This is the
[2:21:19] third pool. But I'll meet you in there.
[2:21:22] So he takes us back to seven years.
[2:21:25] That's 1956.
[2:21:28] What did he say in the in 1956? It was a
[2:21:32] tent vision. Yes. Now, if you're reading
[2:21:35] the message and you're studying that,
[2:21:37] you you can follow what the Holy Spirit
[2:21:40] is leading him to. He said was six
[2:21:42] years. He says seven years ago. So, he's
[2:21:44] pointing you on the tape to go back to
[2:21:47] that 10 vision.
[2:21:49] So, why are we afraid of it? Who's mad
[2:21:52] about it? Who's inflamed about it? The
[2:21:55] true believer loves the word of the
[2:21:57] Lord. And nothing to be ashamed about,
[2:22:00] nothing to hide about. He said it. this
[2:22:03] on the tape. I'm a believer. I'll say
[2:22:05] amen to it.
[2:22:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:22:12] He points him back seven
[2:22:15] years. Remember, you know, in 1956 when
[2:22:18] he gives that 10 vision, he wasn't even
[2:22:20] in a brand
[2:22:21] tabernacle. Huh? No, he was on the
[2:22:25] field.
[2:22:27] It was in the tape tabernacle.
[2:22:31] It was recorded on the tape.
[2:22:34] Aren't you glad about it? So, I can go
[2:22:37] pick up that tape and I don't have to
[2:22:39] ask permission from no one. Amen. He
[2:22:42] said it in the seventh seal, I can go
[2:22:44] pick it up and unreservably with all the
[2:22:48] amens in my spirit. I can say amen to
[2:22:51] all of it. Praise the Lord.
[2:22:55] The devil wants you to be ashamed of
[2:22:57] that. Wants you to back away from it, to
[2:22:58] stop quoting it. But no, no, no, no, no.
[2:23:02] This is my inheritance.
[2:23:06] Hallelujah.
[2:23:09] Praise the Lord. So that was the third
[2:23:12] pool. Can I close
[2:23:14] now? Somebody say yes or
[2:23:17] no. Normally they want me to get out of
[2:23:19] the pull pit. Huh? Can I go a little
[2:23:23] further?
[2:23:25] Can I close?
[2:23:29] They won't let me
[2:23:31] close. I bless you, brother Kurt. I just
[2:23:35] I feel so good preaching this word. All
[2:23:37] right. Now, Brother Bannon brings this
[2:23:39] third pull and the rest of it. You in
[2:23:43] your interest should be highlighted to
[2:23:46] go pick up that message. You you the
[2:23:48] hearer should go hear it for yourself.
[2:23:51] Right. I'm highlighting the church age
[2:23:53] book so you can go read it again. You
[2:23:56] think it'll help you? Do you think it's
[2:23:57] a blessing? Was it Brother Brandham's
[2:24:00] book? Then tell me it wasn't and then
[2:24:02] quote to me how you got that information
[2:24:04] that it wasn't his book. Please,
[2:24:09] it's got to come out of this
[2:24:13] message. There's a growing sentiment
[2:24:15] that the tent vision is
[2:24:20] spiritual and the brothers are going
[2:24:22] around preaching that and saying that.
[2:24:23] I'm just asking for the quotation, tape,
[2:24:27] title, and paragraph, please, where the
[2:24:31] prophet explained the tent vision that
[2:24:33] way. He didn't do it here. He didn't do
[2:24:36] it anywhere on the tapes. So, if I'm
[2:24:39] going to listen to that, then I'd have
[2:24:42] to say it didn't come from the prophet.
[2:24:44] Where did it come from? Amen.
[2:24:49] Teaching settles you, saints.
[2:24:52] teaching positions
[2:24:54] you. This is God's word.
[2:24:58] It's not mine. I'm not going to win or
[2:25:01] lose by whether I was right. I I knew it
[2:25:03] all along. We're not going to get on the
[2:25:05] other side. Yeah, I knew they was wrong
[2:25:07] all along.
[2:25:10] I'm trying to get right before the Lord
[2:25:12] right now. Who cares who's right or
[2:25:14] wrong? Oh, I saw it before you did. And
[2:25:17] what? You want a cookie? You want a
[2:25:19] biscuit?
[2:25:21] or I saw it before. I saw it before they
[2:25:23] saw it. Like what?
[2:25:26] No man can see anything if God don't
[2:25:28] show him. But if God does show you, you
[2:25:31] are blessed and you can give God the
[2:25:34] praise and say it with conviction
[2:25:38] because it's in the Bible. It's in the
[2:25:40] tape. God bless you. God richly bless
[2:25:43] you. It's our third pull. It's our
[2:25:45] inheritance. Let me read one more quote.
[2:25:47] Musicians come, please. Thank you.
[2:25:50] And I'll close right here. So he tells
[2:25:53] us Satan will try to
[2:25:57] impersonate. He will. Amen.
[2:26:01] Amen.
[2:26:03] In the vision, he says this
[2:26:05] here. Tells us, don't try to explain it.
[2:26:09] He refers us back to 1956, 7 years
[2:26:12] prior. He said he didn't know there was
[2:26:14] even connected. His mind never even
[2:26:16] thought like that. He's opening these
[2:26:18] seals. The cloud ring appears. He gets
[2:26:21] the permission to pre to preach the
[2:26:23] seven seals. He's forbidden to tell
[2:26:26] everybody what's going on until after
[2:26:28] the seals have been broken and open. And
[2:26:31] now he's opening to us what the third
[2:26:33] pool is connected to these great seals
[2:26:36] and opening up. And he refers us back to
[2:26:38] a vision seven years prior which happens
[2:26:42] to be the tent vision which happens to
[2:26:44] be a great conflict today amongst uh
[2:26:47] message believers. But for us, it's not
[2:26:50] a conflict.
[2:26:52] Can I get a witness? How many you with
[2:26:54] me? How many know where I'm coming from?
[2:26:56] At least you know where I'm coming from.
[2:26:58] It's no conflict with the tent vision.
[2:27:01] He said it. Now, what does it mean?
[2:27:03] How's it going to play out? I can't tell
[2:27:04] you. Soon as I get the quote, I'll
[2:27:07] preach it.
[2:27:11] Paragraph 298, he says this
[2:27:15] here. A voice come and said, he's trying
[2:27:19] to explain. He says, "You can't teach
[2:27:21] Pentecostal babies supernatural
[2:27:24] things." Said, "Now let them alone." So,
[2:27:28] how many want to be taught by the
[2:27:32] Lord, but you don't want to be a
[2:27:35] baby, a Pentecostal baby. You want to be
[2:27:40] able to be taught by the Holy Spirit
[2:27:42] these supernatural
[2:27:44] things that come by the Holy Spirit and
[2:27:48] he and he alone alone brings it to
[2:27:53] you. So if the third pool that many are
[2:27:56] saying they have the revelation they
[2:27:58] explained this way the tent means this
[2:28:01] and this means that and they have the
[2:28:03] third pool where's their second pool?
[2:28:09] Where's the first pull? You got the
[2:28:11] third pull. If you got the third, you
[2:28:13] have to have number two, right?
[2:28:17] And if you got to pick up brother
[2:28:19] Brandham to express pull number two,
[2:28:22] then don't put him down when you're
[2:28:25] expressing pull number three.
[2:28:29] You need the prophet for pull one. You
[2:28:31] need the prophet for pull two. Don't put
[2:28:33] him down when you're trying to explain
[2:28:35] pull number three. You got to stay with
[2:28:37] that prophet. It was his pulls. I'm glad
[2:28:41] about it. I'm not I'm happy.
[2:28:45] God bless you so much. I'm so happy to
[2:28:47] be a Christian. Bless his wonderful
[2:28:50] name. God bless you so much. Let's give
[2:28:53] the Lord a hand of praise. Thank you.
[2:28:55] God bless you. Amen. Let us pray. Thank
[2:29:00] you. God bless you. Lord Jesus, we ask
[2:29:03] your blessings upon us today, Lord. The
[2:29:06] word of the Lord. And Father, we have
[2:29:09] nothing except what you give to us. And
[2:29:12] as we walk in this truth, let us walk
[2:29:14] humbly and
[2:29:16] faithfully. Lord, we know we have to say
[2:29:18] things to take a stand for what is
[2:29:22] right. I hear things on the field. I
[2:29:25] hear thing amongst the pastors. I go and
[2:29:28] I travel. I see these things being said,
[2:29:31] Lord.
[2:29:33] And Lord, I want to be faithful to what
[2:29:36] you
[2:29:39] said. And so you place it upon my heart
[2:29:42] and I bring it to the people here. I
[2:29:45] trust, Lord, that my attitude isn't
[2:29:48] wrong. I trust that it's right. I trust
[2:29:51] that we're leading and pointing the
[2:29:55] people to your
[2:29:56] word. And that's the responsibility of
[2:29:59] every Christian, not just the pastor.
[2:30:01] Every Christian is responsible to lead
[2:30:05] the people to you, to your word. And I
[2:30:08] pray ask your blessings now upon each
[2:30:12] one. Bless the saints there in Mesa this
[2:30:16] morning that's gathered. May the Holy
[2:30:19] Spirit encourage them and strengthen
[2:30:21] them. Bless every believer here today.
[2:30:24] May they be encouraged and strengthened.
[2:30:26] Oh God, we love you. We ask these
[2:30:30] blessings in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[2:30:33] you. Amen. Singing.

[2:31:07] word. He never failed me. He never
[2:31:11] failed.
[2:31:15] singing.
[2:31:17] Oh,
[2:31:21] oh, round. No, we come this far by
[2:31:26] faith. One more time. Yes, we have come
[2:31:31] this far by
[2:31:36] faith. Leaning
[2:31:38] on. Let's all stand to our feets.
[2:31:42] And I'm
[2:31:45] trusting holy word. He never failed me
[2:31:52] yet.
[2:31:54] Yeah.
[2:31:55] Singing.
[2:31:58] Oh. Oh. Can't turn
[2:32:02] around. No. We come this far by singing.

[2:32:27] Lord. I will
[2:32:30] trust in the
[2:32:34] Lord. I will trust. Yes, I will.
[2:32:39] I can't trust no one else until I
[2:32:44] die. Until I
[2:32:47] die, I will
[2:32:50] trust in my
[2:32:53] Lord. I will
[2:32:57] trust in the Lord.
[2:33:01] I will
[2:33:04] trust in the Lord until I die. I'll stay
[2:33:11] on the
[2:33:13] battlefield and I'm going to stay on the
[2:33:20] [Music]
[2:33:22] battlefield. Stay on the battlefield.
[2:33:28] I'm going to stay on the
[2:33:33] battlefield until I
[2:33:36] die for the rest of my
[2:33:40] life. I'm going
[2:33:42] to by your grace, Lord, I'll stay on the
[2:33:48] battlefield. Stay on the battlefield.

[2:34:02] hand and tell them that one more time.
[2:34:04] I'll stay
[2:34:06] on. I'm going to stay
[2:34:09] on. Encourage them. Tell them stay on
[2:34:12] the battlefield, my brother, my sister.

[2:34:17] on the
[2:34:20] battlefield. Want to stay on the
[2:34:25] battlefield until I
[2:34:29] die until I

[2:34:36] on for the rest of my
[2:34:40] life. For the rest of my
[2:34:43] life, I made up my mind. I'm going to
[2:34:48] stay on the
[2:34:51] battlefield until I die. One more time.
[2:34:55] I'll trust in the Lord. I'll trust in
[2:34:58] his word. I will
[2:35:01] trust in the
[2:35:06] Lord. I'll trust
[2:35:09] him for my family, for my healing. I'll

[2:35:41] trust in the
[2:35:44] Lord till I die. Let's give the Lord a
[2:35:49] hand of praise and thank
[2:35:52] him.
[2:35:54] Amen. Let us pray. We'll close in
[2:35:56] prayer. Heavenly Father, thank you for
[2:35:59] your word this morning. Hallelujah.
[2:36:01] Lord, your heart our hearts to be
[2:36:05] blessed with the truth of
[2:36:08] God to show us our
[2:36:11] inheritance. Those four or five sisters
[2:36:14] in numbers,
[2:36:15] Lord, that needed an inheritance for
[2:36:18] them. Hallelujah. There was no provision
[2:36:21] for them, but they sought the
[2:36:24] prophet. And the prophet sought you,
[2:36:27] Lord, and you told them that they were
[2:36:29] right. and you made a provision for
[2:36:32] them. What was it? They had a desire for
[2:36:36] that inheritance to be fulfilled in
[2:36:39] their life. And this inheritance of the
[2:36:42] seventh seal has been given to us, Lord.
[2:36:45] It belongs to us. It does not belong to
[2:36:48] the makeeliever or the unbeliever. It
[2:36:51] does not belong to the world. It belongs
[2:36:54] to the true believer.
[2:36:56] And it was given to us so that we can
[2:36:59] repeat it in the morning and the
[2:37:02] evening. We can repeat it on Sundays. We
[2:37:06] can repeat it in our homes when we rise
[2:37:08] up, when we lay down. We can repeat it
[2:37:11] when we're discouraged and know that
[2:37:13] there's a promise for us. We can repeat
[2:37:16] it all the days of our life. And we
[2:37:19] thank you, Lord. You've given it to us.
[2:37:21] We ask that you'll bless us now as we
[2:37:24] go. bring us back at that appointed
[2:37:26] time. We pray. May each one, Lord, leave
[2:37:29] here. It's bless their hearts and speak
[2:37:31] to them. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:37:35] God bless you. You're
[2:37:39] dismissed. We'll
[2:37:43] trust. God bless you. God be with you
[2:37:46] till I die.
[2:37:52] I'm going to treat
[2:37:55] everybody

[2:38:44] to stay on the
[2:38:48] battlefield, Lord. I'll stay
[2:38:53] on.
[2:38:54] Hallelujah. I want to stay on the
[2:39:01] battlefield until I die.
