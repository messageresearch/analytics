[8:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for keeping us each each
[8:29] one safe, Lord.
[8:31] Thank you Lord for brother Zach Lord and
[8:34] for our pastor and musicians.
[8:37] Pray you come down Lord and give us your
[8:40] presence Lord and touch each one in
[8:41] Jesus name.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[8:47] Hey Psalms 34:3 says, "Oh magnify the
[8:51] Lord with me and let us exalt his name
[8:54] together." Amen. Shall we all stand? And
[8:57] let's sing that song. At the cross. At
[9:00] the cross.
[9:02] Where my savior died.
[9:05] At last indeed my savior flee. And did
[9:12] my song
[9:15] from God?
[9:17] Could he devote that
[9:22] sacred
[9:25] for such a wor as high?
[9:31] Oh, at the cross, at the cross where I
[9:35] first saw the light and the burden of my
[9:40] heart rolled away.
[9:45] It was there by grace. I received my
[9:51] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[9:59] Oh, was it for crime that I have done?
[10:06] He grown upon
[10:09] the tree.
[10:13] Amazing
[10:15] pity
[10:17] gra unknown
[10:20] and love beyond
[10:23] me.
[10:26] Oh at the cross at the cross where I
[10:31] burst of light and the burden of my
[10:36] heart rolled away.
[10:40] It was there by me. I received
[10:46] my side and now I have but drops of
[10:52] grief.
[10:55] But drops of grief can never
[11:00] make the debt of love I own.
[11:08] Dear Lord, I give myself
[11:13] away is all that I can do. We surrender
[11:20] ourselves to you, Lord. At the cross. At
[11:24] the cross where I first saw the light
[11:28] and the burden of my heart rolled away.
[11:35] It was there by faith. I received my
[11:41] sight and now I am happy all the day.
[11:49] Amen. Let's give him a little praise.
[11:53] You may take your seats if you'd like.
[11:56] Just a closer walk with him. Just a
[11:59] closer walk with him. I
[12:03] am weak but thou art strong.
[12:11] Jesus
[12:14] keep me from all harm.
[12:21] I'll be satisfied
[12:26] as long
[12:29] as I walk. Let me walk
[12:35] &gt;&gt; through this world of fall and snares.
[12:40] through
[12:42] this world of holiness.
[12:45] [Music]
[12:49] If
[12:51] I ber, Lord, who cares?
[12:58] Oh, who
[13:01] with me? My burden
[13:04] shares
[13:07] none but me.
[13:10] Dear Lord, but none but thee.
[13:15] All together now. Oh, just
[13:20] a closer walk with thee.
[13:28] Granted,
[13:30] Jesus
[13:31] is my plea.
[13:37] daily
[13:40] walking close to thee.
[13:46] Let it be,
[13:48] oh dear Lord.
[13:51] Let it be
[13:56] when
[13:58] my people like
[14:06] no time
[14:08] for me to be no more.
[14:16] Guide
[14:18] me gently. Send me home
[14:24] to thy kingdom
[14:28] so to thy shore.
[14:33] [Music]
[14:35] Oh, just
[14:37] a closer one.
[14:45] Granted,
[14:48] Jesus is my plea.
[14:54] Oh, daily
[14:57] walking close to thee.
[15:03] Let it be
[15:07] long. Let it be.
[15:13] Let it be,
[15:16] dear Lord.
[15:19] Let it be.
[15:25] Amen.
[15:27] How great are you, Lord. How great thou
[15:30] art. Sing that song to him.
[15:36] 134 if you'd like to sing it.
[15:40] Oh Lord my God,
[15:47] when I
[15:49] awome
[15:51] wonder
[15:54] consider
[15:56] all
[16:01] my
[16:08] [Music]
[16:12] I hear the rolling
[16:16] thunder
[16:20] power throughout
[16:24] the universe.
[16:33] Sing my soul,
[16:37] my Savior
[16:40] God to thee.
[16:46] How great thou are.
[16:52] How great thou are.
[16:59] and my soul,
[17:04] my savior
[17:06] God to thee.
[17:10] [Music]
[17:12] How great thou art.
[17:19] How great thou art.
[17:24] [Music]
[17:27] through the world.
[17:31] And for
[17:34] I wonder
[17:36] [Music]
[17:39] and hear the birds
[17:44] sing
[17:46] in
[17:47] the trees.
[17:49] [Music]
[17:52] Then I look down
[17:57] [Music]
[17:58] the lofty mountain.
[18:06] And here the road.
[18:10] [Music]
[18:19] and sing my soul,
[18:24] my savior
[18:26] God to thee.
[18:30] [Music]

[18:39] How great thou are.
[18:44] [Music]
[18:46] Sing
[18:47] my soul,
[18:51] my savior,
[18:54] God to thee.
[18:58] [Music]
[18:59] How great thou are.
[19:06] How great thou art.
[19:13] When Christ shall come
[19:19] with shouts of
[19:23] [Music]
[19:27] take me home.
[19:32] What joy shall fill my heart.
[19:40] Then I shall bow
[19:44] [Music]
[19:46] in hungation
[19:48] [Music]
[19:54] and there proclaim
[19:57] [Music]
[19:59] my God I praise.
[20:04] Shall we all stand? Sing it with all our
[20:06] hearts. Then he sings my soul,
[20:13] my Savior
[20:15] God to thee.
[20:19] [Music]
[20:21] How great thou are.
[20:28] How great thou are.
[20:36] Sing my soul,
[20:40] my Savior
[20:42] God to thee.
[20:48] How great thou are.
[20:54] [Music]
[20:55] How great thou art.
[21:02] and
[21:04] my soul.
[21:07] [Music]
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Your God today.
[21:13] [Music]
[21:16] How great thou are.
[21:23] How great
[21:25] thou are.
[21:28] [Music]
[21:32] My soul,
[21:35] my savior
[21:37] God to thee.
[21:41] Amen.
[21:44] How great thou are,
[21:49] [Music]
[21:51] how great thou.
[21:55] Amen. God bless you, saints. So good to
[21:58] be in the house of the Lord with you.
[21:59] Praise the Lord to each of you. God
[22:01] bless you richly. Good to see you,
[22:03] Sister Becken, the kids, and each of
[22:05] you. We're going to listen to the
[22:07] portion of the message, the countdown.
[22:10] And brother Brandon will be starting in
[22:13] the scripture, if you'd like to turn
[22:15] there in Hebrews chapter 11. Let's take
[22:18] from paragraph number two through
[22:22] paragraph the number I gave them, 96.
[22:25] About 40 minutes or so, 45 minutes. and
[22:29] then we'll go to the Lord in prayer.
[22:31] It's a powerful tape. Brother Randon
[22:33] preached this message three times. Twice
[22:35] in 1962
[22:37] and then this is the last time he
[22:39] ministered it in 1964 in Bakersfield and
[22:43] totally comparing the um scientific
[22:48] achievements to our daytoday. Just a
[22:51] tremendous tremendous uh message that he
[22:54] brings to us. So trust you're looking
[22:57] forward to that. Amen. Amen. Let's sing.
[23:00] Only believe.
[23:03] Only
[23:05] believe.
[23:09] Only
[23:11] believe
[23:14] that all things are possible.
[23:20] Only
[23:22] believe.
[23:25] Only
[23:27] believe.
[23:31] Ally
[23:33] believe.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[23:40] [Music]
[23:42] Only. Can we say Lord I believe with all
[23:45] your heart? Oh Lord
[23:49] I believe.
[23:52] Lord,
[23:54] I believe
[23:57] that all things are possible.
[24:03] Lord, I believe.
[24:08] Oh Lord,
[24:10] I believe.
[24:14] Lord,
[24:16] I believe.
[24:18] Hallelujah.
[24:20] All things are possible.
[24:25] Lord, I believe
[24:29] and may remain standing, brother
[24:31] Brandham.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; But now we're standing in respects of
[24:39] the word while I read a portion of
[24:41] scripture here and ask God for a context
[24:43] for my text. We are turning to Hebrews
[24:46] 11th chapter. if you'd like to follow as
[24:48] we read. Now faith is the substance of
[24:52] things hoped for and the evidence of
[24:54] things not seen.
[24:57] For by it the elders obtained a good
[25:00] report.
[25:01] Through faith we understand that the
[25:04] worlds were framed by the word of God.
[25:07] So that things which are seen were not
[25:11] made of things which do appear. Let's
[25:14] pray. Lord, bless your word.
[25:18] Sanctify the instrument that it shall be
[25:21] used for. And may the instrumentality be
[25:24] to go together with the word to bring
[25:27] forth life and make this word live again
[25:30] before us. We ask that in Jesus name.
[25:32] Amen. And be seated.
[25:44] Just give me your undivided attention
[25:45] just for a few moments about 20 minutes.
[25:47] I have a little text here. I'd like to
[25:49] call it countdown.
[25:54] You know all the things. Did you hear
[25:56] what the scripture said? The things that
[25:58] are we see were made of things that was
[26:01] not because it was the word of God who
[26:05] spoke things into existence. The world
[26:07] that we are sitting upon today, the
[26:11] chairs that we're sitting in, the floor
[26:13] that's beneath us, the dirt, the trees,
[26:16] everything is nothing but the
[26:18] interpretation of the word of God. When
[26:21] God interprets it, when it happens, that
[26:24] reveals it. Let there be and there was.
[26:27] Let there be and there was. And to see
[26:30] nature, how it is formed. Now, nature
[26:32] has been my Bible. As everyone knows who
[26:35] I've been in my audience when I spoke,
[26:38] I'm really almost on the illiterate side
[26:41] and just barely read. I had a seventh
[26:44] grade education. I had a lot of
[26:46] experience. But in my preaching, I have
[26:49] to take my inspiration and hype it with
[26:53] something in the in nature so that you
[26:56] can understand what I'm talking about. I
[26:58] can't use words like a smart educated
[27:01] man does because I haven't the education
[27:04] to do it with. So therefore, I pick up
[27:06] nature and type what my inspiration is
[27:09] telling me with nature. I felt awful
[27:11] lonesome for that. But one time I read
[27:13] in the Bibles where the prophets of the
[27:15] Old Testament did that. And then the
[27:18] greatest of the prophets was John. And
[27:20] we noticed when he was 9 years old, he
[27:22] was carried into the wilderness by the
[27:24] spirit because he had to introduce the
[27:26] Messiah. His father was a priest. It was
[27:29] ordinary. That is he would follow the
[27:30] trend of his father. But his job was too
[27:33] important to take some ethics of what
[27:36] somebody else thought. He had to get his
[27:38] message from God. So at the age of 30,
[27:41] he came out of the wilderness uneducated
[27:44] but with a burning zeal in his heart
[27:46] with a revelation from God and a vision
[27:48] that he was going to announce the
[27:50] Messiah. He knew it so plainly until he
[27:53] said, "There's one standing among you
[27:55] right now that you don't know."
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Think of that. One standing among you
[28:00] right here that you don't know. He his
[28:03] shoes I'm not worthy to unloose, but he
[28:06] will baptize with the Holy Ghost and
[28:08] fire. His hand is in his hand. And did
[28:10] you notice his his manner of speech? Now
[28:14] he said to the Pharisees when he come
[28:15] out, he knew being a prophet, he knowed
[28:17] what was in their heart. And he said,
[28:19] "You generation of vipers," meaning
[28:22] snakes. See, they he knew that that now
[28:26] some other man might have said, "You
[28:28] something else, you know, you some a
[28:30] good high grammar. You uh insignificant
[28:33] piece of inconvenience or whatever you
[28:35] might have wanted to call it. That might
[28:36] be wrong. I just picked that up." See, u
[28:39] so it might have been some other words
[28:41] that he could have used. But you see his
[28:43] inspiration, he knowed that a snake was
[28:46] little and low down and sneaking. So he
[28:48] said, "You generation of snakes who's
[28:51] warned you to flee from the wrath that
[28:53] to come, don't begin to say within
[28:55] yourselves that we belong to this or
[28:57] that. For I say unto you that God's able
[28:59] of these rocks, stones, what he'd seen
[29:02] in the wilderness and on the bank to
[29:04] raise up children unto Abraham." Also,
[29:06] the axe is laid at the root of the tree,
[29:09] what he'd seen. Every tree like in the
[29:11] wilderness, it didn't bring forth fruit.
[29:12] That's what he used for firewood. See,
[29:14] it laid at the root of the tree. And if
[29:16] you don't bring forth good fruit, he
[29:17] shoeed down and cast into the fire. See,
[29:19] his inspiration followed nature. And if
[29:23] you watch nature real close, you won't
[29:26] get too far from the word because God is
[29:28] in nature. I think last time I was down
[29:31] on the West Coast, I preached on the
[29:33] four ways of seeing God. God in his son,
[29:35] God in his word, God in nature, and so
[29:37] forth. Now if we notice everything that
[29:40] God made in nature being able to speak
[29:42] that way on natural things typing
[29:44] spiritual things it because it was made
[29:47] of things which does not appear it was
[29:49] the word. Now we take for instance like
[29:52] yeah a few months ago I was asked to
[29:54] preach a sermon a funeral sermon for a
[29:56] dear old friend of mine. Many ever read
[29:58] my book and you remember where I a boy
[30:01] that was a one belonged to some of the
[30:03] boy scouts or something and he I asked
[30:05] him to save him my save me his old cow
[30:08] uh or scout suit when he wore it out
[30:10] well he saved me one leg and you
[30:12] remember it in the book and I put it on
[30:14] Lloyd Ford his mother died recently
[30:16] about 85 years old very precious friend
[30:19] of mine and Lloyd being single yet and
[30:22] stayed with his mother he came to me and
[30:24] he said brother Bill that's how he knew
[30:26] me we I call him Lloyd He called me
[30:28] Bill. And I said, "Uh, what do you want,
[30:30] Brother Lloyd?" He said, "Will you uh
[30:32] will you preach Mother's funeral?" I
[30:34] said, "I'd be glad to do it. It'd be
[30:35] like my own mother." Oh, I said, "She's
[30:37] cooked me so many meals and things and
[30:39] been so sweet to me." He said, "I want
[30:41] you to say those last words over Brother
[30:43] Brandham." I said, "What would you what
[30:44] would you want me to say, Lloyd?" He
[30:46] said, "One thing I want you to do just
[30:48] assure my people. Assure us of her
[30:50] resurrection." So I took the text from
[30:53] something over in Job uh of how that Job
[30:57] was watching nature and I said in my
[31:00] death of my own mother, my own mother
[31:02] that just died about two years ago, my
[31:05] young sister had just been saved a
[31:07] little while and she called me up when
[31:08] she knew mother was going and she said,
[31:10] "Uh, Bill, what can I do?" Said, "I just
[31:13] can't stand it no longer standing there
[31:15] looking upon my mother." I said, "It's
[31:16] the sweetest sight I ever seen." She
[31:19] said, "How can you say that in your
[31:21] mother?" Why? I said, "She's ready to go
[31:23] and wanting to go. She's old and she's
[31:26] ready to pass in this life." I said to
[31:28] her, "Mother, does Jesus still mean to
[31:30] you what they did the day you got the
[31:31] Holy Ghost?" She'd say, "Yes." When and
[31:34] I when she couldn't do it no more. I
[31:35] said, "Smile." When she got slow, she
[31:38] couldn't smile or speak. I said,
[31:39] "Mother, you're dying. She's in my arm."
[31:41] And I said, "Mother, if Jesus Christ
[31:43] still means the same to you? And is this
[31:45] sweeter, even sweeter than he was when
[31:48] you received the Holy Ghost? I'm your
[31:50] preacher son. I've got to meet the
[31:51] public. Does Jesus mean something to you
[31:53] while you're dying? If it does, if you
[31:55] can't speak," she couldn't speak. I
[31:57] said, "Can't you speak, mother?" She
[31:58] couldn't move. I said, "Bat your eyes
[32:00] real fast." And she started batting her
[32:01] eyes real fast. No. Water running down
[32:03] her cheeks when she couldn't even speak
[32:05] no more. But her senses in her sense the
[32:08] presence of Jesus Christ. In a few
[32:10] minutes, a wind comes sweeping through
[32:11] the room and mother went out with it to
[32:14] meet God. Now,
[32:17] this woman when she died, I said, "Is
[32:19] there hopes in the resurrection?" I
[32:21] said, "Everything I've been privileged
[32:23] is speaking practically to every nation
[32:24] under the heavens. I've seen all kinds
[32:26] of gods and all kinds of religions, but
[32:29] there's none of it true. But
[32:30] Christianity, it's the only one. Even
[32:32] nature itself, it speaks for
[32:34] Christianity. God the creator. Look,
[32:36] there is life, death, burial,
[32:39] resurrection, resurrection. The you
[32:42] can't go outside without seeing it.
[32:44] Watch the leaves come on in the spring.
[32:47] Watch them get to their youth in their
[32:49] old in their middle age and then their
[32:51] old age and the veins and the leaves
[32:52] packing the life. Few minutes you find
[32:55] out it isn't long before any frost falls
[32:57] or anything. Them leaves drop off and
[32:59] what happens? The life that's in that
[33:01] tree, that sap goes down into the roots.
[33:04] If it didn't, the winter cold would kill
[33:06] the tree, kill the life. It can't stay
[33:09] up. It's got to go down and bury itself.
[33:11] But in the spring of year, here it comes
[33:12] back with a new leaf again. It's
[33:14] testifying there is a life, a death, a
[33:18] burial, a resurrection. Everything
[33:21] tightened. We just can't get from it.
[33:23] Watch the sun when it's rises of a
[33:25] morning. The sun that lights the skies.
[33:28] It's a little baby rocked in its
[33:30] mother's arms. when it's weak, not very
[33:33] much light, not very strong. Then about
[33:35] 8:00 it starts off to school. At 11:30,
[33:38] she's graduated and it's out of high
[33:41] school, out of college. Then she's in
[33:43] her strength from about 12 till about 2.
[33:45] Then she begins to get weak, weaker,
[33:47] weaker, weaker, and finally she gets
[33:49] real weak like an old man or woman. Goes
[33:52] down. Is that the end of it? She comes
[33:54] back the next morning. You'll testify
[33:56] there is a resurrection and a life
[33:57] beyond death.
[33:59] Everything testifying. All nature
[34:01] testifies. The word testifies to it. The
[34:04] very spirit itself, it's in our heart
[34:07] testifies to it. Something within us
[34:09] calling out that there is a resurrection
[34:12] of the dead. So you see to say if
[34:15] everything serves God's purpose, it's
[34:17] got a resurrection. But it can only rise
[34:19] if it serves God's purpose. If a flower
[34:22] lives and is not germatized, it will not
[34:24] rise again. If you plant corn and it is
[34:27] not geratized, it will not rise again.
[34:29] Anything that doesn't serve God's
[34:31] purpose has no resurrection. But you
[34:33] can't keep anything in the ground that
[34:36] serves God's purpose. It comes forth
[34:38] again to testify of the resurrection. We
[34:40] know that all these things are right.
[34:42] There are testimonies to us to encourage
[34:45] us each day. Everywhere you look, you
[34:47] see God. There is a natural body of
[34:50] people. There is a spiritual body of
[34:53] people. There is a natural bride. I've
[34:56] had the privilege of marrying fine young
[34:58] couples. I never think of it unless I uh
[35:02] kind of turn them around little
[35:04] superstitions and I face with my back to
[35:07] the east and them looking to the east.
[35:09] And as I look at them, I think of their
[35:11] hearts beating as one Christ and his
[35:14] bride. There is a natural bride. And
[35:17] then there is a natural bride. It's only
[35:19] a testimony. There is a spiritual bride.
[35:22] There is a spiritual bride because there
[35:24] is a natural bride. All these natural
[35:27] happenings now they forerrun spiritual
[35:31] happenings. Each happening
[35:34] accompanies the other happening only it
[35:37] improves it. You say what's like that?
[35:40] Well something like a spiritual life
[35:42] when it comes into the natural life it
[35:44] improves the natural life. It it makes
[35:47] you in a better condition than you was
[35:49] in the natural life. When the leaf is
[35:51] getting old and dies, when it comes back
[35:53] with the life again in the resurrection
[35:54] to testify in another year, it comes
[35:57] back in a better condition than it did
[35:58] when it went down. See, everything
[36:01] testifies of these things. Now, let's
[36:05] take for instance the achievement that
[36:07] man has been uh able to do on earth and
[36:10] all of these natural achievements. Now
[36:14] if I want your undivided attention now
[36:16] the all the natural achievements uh
[36:20] happened in the earth has been
[36:22] forerunners of spiritual achievements
[36:25] that God has done by his church. All the
[36:28] natural things are type of the spiritual
[36:30] things. Now you say how is that? Let's
[36:32] take for one transportation.
[36:35] First the transportation was by horse.
[36:39] The next it was by automobile. Then
[36:41] science build us an airplane and but you
[36:45] see it is uh first was one horsepower.
[36:49] The car was maybe 20 horsepower. The
[36:52] airplane goes up to hundreds of
[36:53] horsepower. See what it is? It's just as
[36:56] we come on with the horse. Then an
[36:58] automobile was made. Then the next thing
[37:01] was an airplane. We just keep achieving
[37:03] on higher and higher going greater and
[37:06] greater. This is the achievement of
[37:09] science. This is a forerunner of the
[37:13] spiritual things that's happened of God
[37:16] by his spirit has been in his promised
[37:19] word. The natural man by the knowledge
[37:23] looks backward for his achievement.
[37:25] That's science.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; See to what God has done in a former
[37:30] creation. They go out and pick up clouds
[37:32] and get pieces of rocks and fossils and
[37:35] and elements and ties them together. See
[37:37] on that achievement they are taking what
[37:40] God has done
[37:43] and perverting it from its original
[37:45] estate and making his living quarters
[37:47] and so forth and his economy a little
[37:50] better by what has been created. That's
[37:54] in the natural achievement by man. But
[37:56] God in the spiritual achievement is
[37:59] going forward not going backward. He's
[38:02] going forward looking into the word and
[38:05] believing the promises for things that
[38:07] never has from you
[38:09] &gt;&gt; for the spiritual revelations to
[38:12] manifest the spiritual things that God
[38:16] has promised. He sees them come to pass.
[38:19] Just as the scientists in his laboratory
[38:21] are working on different things to help
[38:23] man take in creation,
[38:25] the spiritual man is looking forward to
[38:28] something that God promised that has
[38:30] never yet been created.
[38:33] The natural man looks backward. The
[38:35] spiritual man looks forward. That's the
[38:37] way they got got that in the church. The
[38:40] natural church member looks back to what
[38:42] Penny Sanki Knox Calvin that was all
[38:44] right. But that was their day. We're
[38:46] looking forward for something else. A
[38:49] promise is greater than higher and what
[38:51] God has promised.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Science goes back to pick it up. We go
[38:55] forward in the word of the Lord to find
[38:58] what God has achieved in these two
[39:00] things. one four runs the other or types
[39:03] it. Now as science has been able to
[39:06] achieve more horsepower as he did by
[39:10] taking the power and making greater
[39:13] instruments autotos and aeroplanes. God
[39:16] has achieved from the same manner as
[39:19] each one of those type. Now watch. Way
[39:22] back in the days of Luther, their power
[39:25] was horsepower.
[39:27] And then God by getting Luther in his
[39:31] hands, controlled out of a great
[39:34] organization or a system, he let the man
[39:36] see that the just shall live by faith.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; And when he was able to achieve
[39:43] justification and preach it, the church
[39:46] come to life. Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; It come to life and it begin to move
[39:50] just a little bit back under the days of
[39:52] the horsepowers when horsepower was
[39:55] about ready to fade out of the carriage
[39:58] and horse and buggy. Now he achieved
[40:01] justification and through that then the
[40:04] church received life by believing on
[40:07] Jesus Christ. Not taking some say I
[40:10] believe the church I believe this to
[40:11] believe him is life.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Justified by faith. Luther preached it.
[40:17] That was tight by the horse and buggy
[40:20] days. Then he got a man in England by
[40:23] the name of John Wesley under his
[40:26] control to take out all the isms away
[40:28] from him. And he was able by John Wesley
[40:31] to bring into the church sanctification.
[40:35] Sanctification raised a church to its
[40:37] feet and got it able to walk. Now at the
[40:40] end of Wesley's age was the automobile.
[40:42] We realize that when the end of the
[40:44] Wesley church, I mean not see ever ever
[40:46] a reformer comes at the end of the age.
[40:49] Now we find out that Wesley and last of
[40:52] his church age, it come just before the
[40:54] Pentecostals. Well, we see that the
[40:57] church got strengthened through
[40:58] sanctification to walk away from the
[41:01] things of the world. Sanctify means
[41:03] separate for the glory of God. It too
[41:06] bad it lost that. But it uh got strength
[41:10] enough. Luther give it life back in the
[41:12] horse and buggy day. Wesie got it on its
[41:15] feet to walk and sanctification
[41:18] separating from the things of the world.
[41:20] Through that come the little branches
[41:21] off like the pilgrim holiness and
[41:23] Nazarines and whatever more come from
[41:25] that through sanctification. But
[41:27] remember they couldn't stay still. The
[41:29] pillar of fire moved out and they come
[41:31] to Isusa street here in California. And
[41:34] then what did it do? It represented the
[41:36] airplane days from the automobile when
[41:39] the God was able by the Wright brothers
[41:41] to or the man was to achieve an airplane
[41:45] that could fly immediately for running
[41:48] that the Zeusa street Pentecost fell and
[41:51] man tucked to the air into the
[41:53] supernatural to the unknown. He spoke
[41:56] with unknown tongues. He done unknown
[41:58] things that was foreign to the church
[42:00] because he had tucked off of the ground.
[42:02] He left the air into the air.
[42:06] What did it immediately after the
[42:09] airplanes come on? He took to the air.
[42:13] God showed by the airplanes that his
[42:15] church was arising. He shows by the
[42:17] natural things what's happening in the
[42:18] spiritual. They always follow just like
[42:21] the wise man following the star to find
[42:23] Christ after following for two years.
[42:25] Now notice all those things are
[42:27] achievements that man has achieved only
[42:30] are types and shadows of what God is
[42:33] doing. He always does it that way. He's
[42:35] told us the signs that would be in the
[42:37] skies, the things that would be
[42:38] happening just before the coming of
[42:40] Christ. We see that now. It's only a
[42:43] pointing post. And we see signs how they
[42:45] have achieved and how God has achieved
[42:47] by his church. Does a man ride in an
[42:49] airplane? He don't want no horse and
[42:52] buggy no more unless he just want a
[42:54] little fun. But the horse and buggy,
[42:55] remember what is the power in the
[42:57] airplane? Just more horses added, that's
[42:59] all. And so when John Wesley found
[43:03] sanctification
[43:04] a set aside work from justification, he
[43:08] never condemned justification. He only
[43:10] added more power to it.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; And when the Pentecostals found the
[43:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[43:17] restoration of the gifts, they never
[43:19] denied sanctification or justification.
[43:21] They just got more power and raised up.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. He went up because he found
[43:29] more power. See all those things
[43:31] foreshadowing as they come up. If we had
[43:33] time, we could really stay on that, but
[43:35] we haven't. But he raised up as science
[43:38] achieved something looking backward. God
[43:40] chieves going this way, going forward to
[43:42] the kingdom. Now we find from Isusa
[43:45] street the plains took off in great
[43:48] revivals and swept the world to the
[43:50] unknown in the heavenly places speaking
[43:53] unknown tongues with unknown gifts to
[43:55] the world. Why? They thought they were
[43:57] fanatics, but they had been able. God
[44:01] got a group of people in his hands. You
[44:03] got a little crosseyed negro man down
[44:05] here in Isusa Street that had no more
[44:08] sense than to believe what God said was
[44:10] the truth.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; See, when a science has got to get a lot
[44:15] of sense in a man's head of wisdom, of
[44:17] knowledge to go back and find these
[44:19] things, God's got to get what he's got
[44:21] in him out of him so he can use him.
[44:23] Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; One going this way and one going that
[44:26] way.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; One's going down, the other's going up.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Now, she left these intellectual
[44:33] churches grounded. When the Pentecostal
[44:36] took off with speaking in tongues and
[44:38] great gifts of healing, they healed the
[44:41] sick. They've done great things. They've
[44:43] done it. There's no doubt what they've
[44:45] done it. It's a proof that they done it.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Sure did. And they left this
[44:49] intellectual church sitting on the
[44:51] ground. No matter. They say, "Oh, you
[44:52] can't go." They did it anyhow. Whether
[44:55] you like the little boy in jail for
[44:58] shooting a gumbo, somebody come in said,
[45:00] "The little boy come into this." He
[45:01] said, "Oh, they can't put you in jail
[45:03] for that." He said, "They can't. He is
[45:05] already there." And that's why they say
[45:07] that the Holy Ghost was for another age.
[45:09] That's what they think. It's here. We
[45:12] know it. We It It's We've been flying in
[45:15] the air for the last 40, 50 years with
[45:17] it. Seeing things that the intellectual
[45:19] people knows nothing about. Only thing
[45:21] they can do is sit down and say just
[45:23] make fun of it. Like a little calf one
[45:26] time come out of a stall. They said it
[45:28] was just fat and round. He's kicking up
[45:29] his heels and he had a very fine farmer
[45:32] fed him good and he's all round and full
[45:34] of vitamins. And there's another old
[45:36] lazy farmer over there that had a little
[45:38] calf also born in the barn that winter
[45:40] when a little fell hadn't eaten nothing
[45:41] but weeds. And when he come out he was
[45:43] so poor he couldn't hardly move. And
[45:44] every time the wind would blow shove him
[45:46] sideways. He seen this little fat cat
[45:48] just kicking up his heels and having a
[45:50] great time. You know, he looked to the
[45:51] crack of the pants and said, "Such
[45:54] fanaticism."
[45:55] He was all full of vitamin. No wonder he
[45:58] could kick up his heels. And when a man
[46:00] is filled with the Holy Ghost, there's
[46:02] something in him. It's full of God's
[46:04] spiritual vitamin.
[46:06] Makes him praise God. Shout. And that
[46:08] given because why? He's no longer
[46:10] earthbound. He's in the heavens sailing
[46:12] around in heavenly places in Christ
[46:15] Jesus. He left them earthbound with
[46:17] their bicycles and automobiles
[46:20] and they went to the air. Yes, they're
[46:22] practically taking them out of they're
[46:25] out of date. They healed the sick. They
[46:28] spoke in unknown languages and done many
[46:30] things.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; But now friends, may I say this? It has
[46:33] come to the age of astronaut.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; We've moved out of the airplane age. We
[46:41] got more power. Now the astronaut age
[46:44] has come in. What is it? Not a we come
[46:47] in to a spiritual age of astronaut. See
[46:51] going above. It's not it's the same
[46:53] spirit only more power. Only lift it and
[46:56] higher can go higher, see more, bleed
[46:58] more, be more like Christ.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Not the automobile, not the horse and
[47:04] buggy, not even the airplane, but the
[47:07] astronaut.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; He sweeps on and above each one. It's
[47:11] called the eagle age in the Bible. God
[47:13] calls his prophets eagle age. We realize
[47:15] over in the Bible, we find in Malachi 4
[47:18] that we're promised that in the last
[47:20] days. Now, he likes his prophets to
[47:22] eagles. He calls himself eagle. He's the
[47:25] great Jehovah eagle. He's able to
[47:28] achieve to himself a bride. He's going
[47:31] to in the last days be able to get a
[47:33] bride that with a ministry that's so
[47:37] exactly the like a man and his wife
[47:40] becomes one. And when Jehovah gets his
[47:44] people like him, then he lives in his
[47:47] people. They are one. It fulfills the
[47:49] scripture. Exactly what he said in St.
[47:51] John 14:12. He that believeth on me, the
[47:54] works that I do shall he also. It also
[47:56] fulfill what Jesus said would take
[47:58] place. As it was in the days of Sodom,
[48:00] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[48:01] of man. Now is the astronaut age. And
[48:05] the astronaut sees things that the horse
[48:08] rider automobile or airplanes either
[48:11] sees.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; He goes high.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Airplanes still down here bouncing
[48:16] around in the clouds and having blowouts
[48:19] and hip downs and everything else, but
[48:21] he goes beyond the clouds of creeds and
[48:24] denominations.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Moves on up into the heavens.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; I'm away from everything. the astronaut
[48:32] age. We are living in the astronaut age.
[48:36] Just as sure as God has testified of the
[48:38] natural happenings there, so is he
[48:40] testifying now that if we've achieved an
[48:43] astronaut, God has achieved what he
[48:46] promised to achieve in the last days
[48:47] according to Malachi 4. Only thing he
[48:49] has to do is get somebody in his hands
[48:53] &gt;&gt; that can cut loose from the airplanes
[48:55] and automobiles and what more. Not look
[48:58] back to what it was, but more power to
[48:59] lift him higher. lift him into the
[49:01] presence of God.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Lift him up there where all things are
[49:04] possible. Now we see it's happening.
[49:07] There's no doubt to it. So does a
[49:09] spiritual astronaut. As a the natural
[49:12] astronaut goes on above the planes. The
[49:14] planes always wrecking up and fussing in
[49:16] the clouds and everything like that.
[49:18] There can be nothing greater, no more
[49:21] achievement than the astronaut. Only
[49:23] thing he has to do is keep putting more
[49:25] power. He'll go anywhere he wants to.
[49:27] See, because he's done gone into space,
[49:29] airplanes are still down, wrecking,
[49:31] pussing, grounded, and everything like
[49:34] that. But the astronaut don't have to be
[49:36] grounded. He goes on above the clouds.
[49:38] He goes on above, on above the creed, on
[49:41] above the denomination, on above those
[49:43] say it is and so it isn't. So he's got a
[49:45] guide. The Holy Spirit, the word tells
[49:47] him so. And he moves on.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; How does the science make an astronaut?
[49:52] He takes what power they got. Just keep
[49:54] breaking something into it. It'll make
[49:55] it go farther, go without air and so
[49:58] forth. He keeps I don't know the the
[50:00] chemicals of it. I'm not a mechanic. But
[50:02] whatever it is, he keeps making it go
[50:03] higher and higher. He keeps improving at
[50:06] all times. And now he can go beyond any
[50:08] reason. So does God's astronaut.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Goes beyond all church creed, all
[50:13] boundaries, all these things. Says the
[50:15] days of miracles has passed. There is no
[50:17] such a thing. How did the astronaut find
[50:18] this? He figured it out on paper. It
[50:21] come off of paper what he figured out.
[50:23] the same thing that any man can sit down
[50:25] and read the word of God and see what's
[50:26] promised.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Search the scriptures in them you think
[50:30] you have eternal life said Jesus and
[50:32] they testify of me.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; That earthbound bunch they had back
[50:36] there in them days didn't know what he
[50:38] was
[50:39] &gt;&gt; ministry what does it the astronaut sees
[50:41] things that the planes and everything's
[50:44] out of date. So does a spiritual
[50:46] astronaut goes beyond the clouds and
[50:48] beyond creeds and beyond doubt out into
[50:51] outer space.
[50:53] Outer space of all unbelief.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Outer space where he don't hear the
[50:59] chatter saying, "Well, you can't do it.
[51:00] The whole body cooperate cooperate with
[51:02] you. You can't do this. You can't do
[51:03] that." He doesn't notice it. He's an
[51:05] astronaut. He goes on beyond those
[51:08] clouds.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; It's too stormy. We can't make it. It
[51:11] don't make any difference to an
[51:12] astronaut. He goes beyond the storm.
[51:14] That's the way it is to a real astronaut
[51:16] faith today. They say, "Well, the doctor
[51:18] said so and so that might be all right,
[51:19] but an astronaut don't believe that."
[51:21] When his wrote here and he's got it in
[51:22] his heart, something tells him, he just
[51:23] propels right on out. It's all goes
[51:25] right on out into the space because
[51:27] we're living in an astronaut age. Yes,
[51:30] sir. Out in space where all things are
[51:33] possible to them that believe. He has a
[51:35] guide which is his word that tells him
[51:37] how to go. The word of God natural
[51:40] astronaut is has uh something to control
[51:44] him. When the astronaut is in the air,
[51:47] he has something backwards here back
[51:49] down here on the earth that controls
[51:51] him. It's called radar. That radar moves
[51:54] him around, tells where he's at, tells
[51:57] what he's doing, and that radar controls
[51:59] him from a radar tower here on Earth.
[52:03] That's the natural astronaut. So the
[52:05] spiritual astronaut has a control power,
[52:08] has a control tower, too. It's not down
[52:11] here like man is. It's up there. And
[52:14] it's the Holy Ghost that's in him that's
[52:16] controlling him. A power of the baptism
[52:19] of the Holy Ghost. It's under control.
[52:22] Keeps him in control by the word. Not in
[52:25] a bunch of fanaticism, some hooped up
[52:27] nonsense, but thus sayaeth the Lord. And
[52:30] it happens. It's always under control.
[52:32] He's got a control tower. That's the
[52:34] Holy Ghost and the word is his his
[52:37] program and he lays right into that
[52:39] program and the power of the Holy Ghost
[52:42] endows him to move out and it brings the
[52:45] achievement that God wants to be
[52:47] achieved for his people that it might
[52:48] fulfill what he promised. Jesus did not
[52:52] heal the people because he had to do it.
[52:54] He fully fulfilled the scripture. He
[52:57] healed because it was written he would
[52:59] do it. He don't have to show these signs
[53:01] today. He don't have to have a ministry
[53:03] of such and such, but he promised he'd
[53:05] do it.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; He does it to fulfill his promise.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, man, women, can't you
[53:11] see that? Can't you see the type of the
[53:14] spiritual and the natural? These great
[53:16] achievements has brought the time clock
[53:19] of science and it broke into such a
[53:21] place until they say now it's only on
[53:24] the clock of science. They say it's
[53:27] three minutes till midnight.
[53:31] They're at the end.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; They found the thing that will destroy
[53:35] him.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; They found everything an astronaut can
[53:37] get in the air and go over with atomic
[53:39] powers to set up there and say,
[53:40] "Surrender or be blown up." Three
[53:44] minutes until midnight, they have worked
[53:46] on what God has done. They've been able
[53:49] to pervert. Instead of trying to make
[53:51] life, they're always trying to find
[53:52] something to kill somebody. Something
[53:54] out do the next thing, beat the next
[53:56] nation, beat the next place. That's what
[53:58] they're trying to do. But man looks on
[54:00] calling man his brother and trying to
[54:02] lead him to a home where he won't have
[54:03] to die.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; One is in death, the other is in life.
[54:07] But these in death only represent life.
[54:09] The leaf when he falls off a tree and
[54:11] dies only mean it's coming back again
[54:13] &gt;&gt; because it has been.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; The clock ticks up on the achievement of
[54:18] science today to 3 minutes to midnight.
[54:20] On God's great clock, it ticks Jesus
[54:23] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[54:25] forever.
[54:26] We have arrived.
[54:29] The works that I do shall you also.
[54:32] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[54:34] and forever. When the scientific clock
[54:36] says three minutes to destruction, God's
[54:39] clock says Jesus Christ the same
[54:41] yesterday, today, and forever. He's on
[54:43] the earth in the power of the Holy Ghost
[54:46] to make his word live and do for his
[54:48] church just exactly what he promised it
[54:50] would do.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Filling his astronauts, getting them all
[54:54] fueled up and ready. So,
[54:57] they got in their great big scientific
[55:00] tube here not long ago, astronaut tube,
[55:03] and are taking the countdown now headed
[55:07] for the moon. They're getting off of
[55:09] here, too. They got a astronaut in a big
[55:13] tube powered by atomic power that they
[55:16] can send it plum to the moon. They claim
[55:18] they got in their tube and are waiting
[55:20] for the countdown. the spiritual
[55:23] astronaut, God in Christ, and is
[55:25] listening to the countdown of the word.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Now, you Lutheran order shout, "You
[55:33] Baptist and Presbyterian, watch the
[55:35] countdown of the word."
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Countdown of the word. And
[55:40] they're headed for heaven,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; not to the moon. They'll pass the moon
[55:45] so fast they won't even see it.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Waiting for the countdown. Yes,
[55:53] sir. Waiting for the countdown is right.
[55:55] What are they doing? They're wrapped in
[55:58] Christ in rapturing grace.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Nothing they did themselves. Christ took
[56:02] the uneducated, the foolish things of
[56:04] the world, wrapped his astronauts in it,
[56:06] and empowered them with the Holy Ghost
[56:08] to take off.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; This world's going to be left alone.
[56:12] That's right. Taking off. Notice the
[56:14] natural man even counts backwards. I
[56:17] said he did things backwards. He counts
[56:20] backwards. Watch his count. 10 9 8 7 6 5
[56:24] 4 3 2 1 zero.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; See, he goes back and starts counting.
[56:29] See, he's all up. 10's a bad number.
[56:32] That's right. To start with 10, it's a
[56:34] bad number. They had 10 tribes of
[56:36] Israel. And that was all carnal. And he
[56:38] had to take Joseph's two son, Ephraim
[56:41] and Manasses, the prophet's children,
[56:43] and bless them. And when he did, his
[56:45] hands crossed. And he said, "Father, not
[56:48] so. You put your hands on Ephraim.
[56:49] should be on Manasses. He said, "God,
[56:51] cross my hands from the taking it from
[56:53] the older son, the law, and putting it
[56:55] up over on Christ." And through that,
[56:58] come through the cross came the change
[56:59] of the birthright.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. To the younger son. Oh my, how
[57:04] wonderful. We had time to go into that
[57:06] will some other time. All right. Now, 10
[57:08] is a bad number, but man always counts
[57:11] backwards. Starts at 10. 10 98765 443 2
[57:14] 1 zero. What does God do? He starts with
[57:17] his number seven.
[57:19] That's God's number.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Watch him. Seven. Oh, he counts ahead
[57:24] starting with one. He starts with his
[57:26] first church age. That's what his
[57:28] symbols was on earth. The seven church
[57:30] ages. He made the world in seven days.
[57:32] Seventh day he rested. That's his last
[57:34] number. And his creation he rested.
[57:37] Notice he counts straight ahead, not
[57:40] backwards. He goes forward. He starts
[57:42] from his first church age which began in
[57:44] 8033. And he started the countdown. He
[57:47] counted his church ages. That was the
[57:49] birth of the church on the day of
[57:51] Pentecost. What did he start counting?
[57:53] He started counting the church ages.
[57:54] First one was Ephesus. Number one, two,
[57:58] Samaria. Three, Pergus. Four, Thirara.
[58:02] Five, Sardis. Six, Philadelphia. Seven,
[58:05] Leosia. It's later than you think.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; It's later than you think. The
[58:11] counting's over.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; The next thing is zero.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Let's go.
[58:16] Everything's ready. The count's over.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; When John Glennise,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; our astronaut, got into that big tube to
[58:25] take off, the nation stood speechless.
[58:29] They didn't know that morning that he
[58:31] took off. When he did, he got in the
[58:32] tube and everybody was crying and
[58:34] waiting and watching what was going to
[58:35] happen. The nation stood spellbound. You
[58:38] seen the all the televisions blaring and
[58:40] everything so everybody could sit. Their
[58:42] natural eye couldn't see it. But of
[58:45] course, they put it on television. You
[58:46] remember it. Then when he got spaced up
[58:48] in the tube just right, and when he did,
[58:51] they started 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero.
[58:55] Off he went. What happened when the big
[58:58] lever pull? The atomics begin to catch
[59:00] fire, begin to break, fire begin to fly,
[59:04] smoke be to roll, and the great big tube
[59:07] took off for the air into the unknown
[59:10] out under somewhere. He took off in the
[59:13] man's achievement. the greatest he's
[59:15] ever had. But let me tell you, that's
[59:17] just a very small thing. One of these
[59:19] mornings,
[59:21] God's achievement of his astronauts
[59:23] that's climbed into Jesus Christ, been
[59:26] born in there by the Holy Ghost, filled
[59:28] with his power. One of these mornings,
[59:30] the whole universe will be screaming and
[59:33] wailing and nashing of teeth when they
[59:35] see they missed it. When the great eagle
[59:38] powered by the Holy Ghost and fire
[59:40] begins to spread her wings,
[59:43] &gt;&gt; the astronauts will take off into the
[59:45] sky. You're going to meet the
[59:47] bridegroom. When the bride takes off in
[59:49] the astronaut power of God Almighty, who
[59:52] sent Jesus Christ to the earth in the
[59:54] form of the Holy Ghost has brought the
[59:56] church through these achievements until
[59:58] now she's getting resurrected powering
[1:00:00] her the power beyond the things of the
[1:00:03] world. Seeing him out here in the church
[1:00:06] making himself the same yesterday,
[1:00:07] today, and forever. Yes, sir. The
[1:00:09] countdown's even over. Ever. Church age
[1:00:11] is done past. We're ending on the Lady
[1:00:14] Oia. Get in, my brother, sister. Get
[1:00:17] pressurized. The pressure won't hurt
[1:00:19] you. Uh when you get on the inside and
[1:00:21] get pressurized. Get in Christ. You
[1:00:23] don't care what the world says. They
[1:00:24] can't never hit you anyhow. You're safe.
[1:00:26] You're tucked in. Jesus Christ is our
[1:00:29] great glorious astronaut tube that we'll
[1:00:32] be in. that'll be propelled by the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost and power and fire when she begins
[1:00:36] to fly. One of these mornings, the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost fire hit the earth like that. When
[1:00:40] it do, the church will be lifted up and
[1:00:42] all the nations will stand. They won't
[1:00:44] need television. They'll see him. Every
[1:00:46] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:00:48] confess as she propels her way in her
[1:00:50] into the glorious rims of of heaven to
[1:00:53] be married to her bridegroom. God, help
[1:00:55] us to live for that day. Let us bow our
[1:00:57] heads.
[1:01:02] Are you driving a horse and buggy today?
[1:01:07] Are you riding a bicycle?
[1:01:10] Are you
[1:01:12] a automobile? Or have you got up into
[1:01:15] the clouds with a plane? If you have,
[1:01:18] I've got something to tell you. There's
[1:01:20] an astronaut age on now.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't you come get into that
[1:01:24] astronaut?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know it sounds scary. The first
[1:01:27] man ever got in an airplane like scared
[1:01:29] to death. First one had an automobile.
[1:01:30] You know what? Done. But now it's a
[1:01:32] common thing. Oh, brother, sister. Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ is here. The great astronaut tube
[1:01:39] that we're to be in. Cloud over us won't
[1:01:42] mean one thing. He'll break every cloud
[1:01:44] of doubt, every thing of unbelief and
[1:01:46] sweep out into the space. If you haven't
[1:01:49] got into him yet, you have an
[1:01:51] opportunity this afternoon. Would you
[1:01:53] raise your hands and say, "Pray for me,
[1:01:54] Brother Brandham, that I can walk into
[1:01:56] that place where I can see every word
[1:01:58] that God promised. I can see and feel a
[1:02:01] pulsating power of God within me. That I
[1:02:04] know that my this world and things is
[1:02:05] gone from me." God bless. Just look at
[1:02:07] the hands. My oh my. All everywhere. Our
[1:02:10] heavenly father, you see their hands.
[1:02:12] I'm only responsible for preaching the
[1:02:13] word. You, they are yours. I give them
[1:02:16] to you. They are yours. Let the Holy
[1:02:19] Spirit down and may they see that these
[1:02:21] achievements they see it in the natural.
[1:02:24] Then if we look back we see it in the
[1:02:26] spiritual. You're here you promised just
[1:02:30] before the end time come that as it was
[1:02:34] in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and we
[1:02:38] had look back and see those days. Look
[1:02:41] there and see where two ministers
[1:02:43] outstanding angelic anointed man went
[1:02:46] down in Sodom and preached in the days
[1:02:48] of Abraham calling out Lot. Then there
[1:02:51] was one stayed with Abraham
[1:02:54] and that was the one who done a sign to
[1:02:56] Abraham. The others and Sodom did their
[1:03:00] sign. And father, so many things could
[1:03:03] be said right here. Maybe the church
[1:03:05] wouldn't understand, but I pray that
[1:03:07] you'll give them such a crave for it,
[1:03:10] Lord, that they'll come and see we're at
[1:03:12] the end time, the astronaut age. I pray,
[1:03:15] Father, that they'll realize it isn't
[1:03:17] trying to condemn what they have. It's
[1:03:20] only trying to give them more rapturing
[1:03:22] grace. For the hour will come when we'll
[1:03:25] have to have rapture power. Not only to
[1:03:28] heal the body, but to change it in a
[1:03:30] moment, in a twinkling of an eye. Christ
[1:03:32] will be so real into their bodies so he
[1:03:35] can change it by his great death and
[1:03:38] what he purchased. May they take this
[1:03:40] today, that token that I spoke of last
[1:03:42] night, hold it before them and walk into
[1:03:45] this astronaut. Granted, Father, where
[1:03:47] visions, powers, and worlds beyond
[1:03:50] known, and oh God, where all the great
[1:03:52] mysteries of God is unfolded in those
[1:03:54] seven seals and made known to man,
[1:03:56] granted, Father, they're yours. Now, I
[1:03:59] realize that alter calls is what we do,
[1:04:02] but Lord, you said as many as believed,
[1:04:05] I pray that you'll give them faith to
[1:04:07] believe. They're in your hands, Lord.
[1:04:09] And if I never see and they never see me
[1:04:11] no more until we meet at your side,
[1:04:14] we'll know them as we are known. I pray
[1:04:17] that you'll help them. And may we all be
[1:04:19] there safely carried through by amazing
[1:04:22] grace of our great astronaut faith that
[1:04:25] we have in Jesus Christ where we're in
[1:04:28] house with him. Amen.
[1:04:39] Amen. Thank God for his word tonight.
[1:04:44] How many you are grateful for the word?
[1:04:46] I bless you. Amen. Uh, brother Bobby
[1:04:49] Wartz, his funeral is tomorrow. We want
[1:04:52] to keep that family in prayer, the
[1:04:54] entire family. Um, sister brother George
[1:04:58] Moore sent me a text about Eden. She's
[1:05:01] been throwing up and has had a fever for
[1:05:04] 4 days. They've taken her to the ER and
[1:05:08] uh, requesting prayer for her. Sounds
[1:05:11] like it's pretty serious.
[1:05:13] Also, brother um will Alifont's dad Stan
[1:05:18] Alifont
[1:05:20] was taken to the emergency room. His uh
[1:05:23] retina detached in his eye and so he's
[1:05:27] in the emergency room, I believe, here
[1:05:29] in Tucson. Sister Deborah McGinty had a
[1:05:32] a treatment for her face just the other
[1:05:35] day. Going to keep her in prayer.
[1:05:39] um brother
[1:05:43] Art's
[1:05:44] family that was um
[1:05:49] that he lost at the funeral for. There's
[1:05:51] a number of them that want a Bible
[1:05:53] study. So, we're going to do that this
[1:05:56] Friday. I'm going over there to one of
[1:05:57] their homes. They were ready. They were
[1:05:59] wanting to do it right away. So, be in
[1:06:01] prayer for that. Amen. Um,
[1:06:09] also someone had a request for a
[1:06:12] coworker named Billy.
[1:06:15] And so I don't know who turned that one
[1:06:16] in. Was that you, Joe? All right.
[1:06:19] Brother Joe has a coworker named Billy.
[1:06:22] Thinking about our brother Angel Harris.
[1:06:26] Um, I haven't heard from him. I know
[1:06:28] it's not good. So we'll pray for Angel
[1:06:32] also for the the group in Mesa there
[1:06:37] tomorrow. There's a gentleman Jonathan
[1:06:39] Houchin that will be preaching for the
[1:06:42] service there. So be in prayer for that
[1:06:45] and also for our meetings that are
[1:06:46] coming. Um we want to be in prayer for
[1:06:49] that and also we want to just pray for
[1:06:52] one another. Amen. Was there someone
[1:06:55] else that had a request they want to
[1:06:56] make known? Yes.
[1:06:59] Mr. Joy, she's not feeling well. All
[1:07:01] right. Someone else had a request they
[1:07:03] want to make known. All right. So, we'll
[1:07:06] keep these requests before the Lord.
[1:07:09] Brother Brandham talked about this the
[1:07:12] black man there in in the ISUsa street.
[1:07:17] Um, how many know what his name was?
[1:07:21] Anyone here?
[1:07:24] Got it. Yeah. Seymour. William Seymour.
[1:07:27] I was studying his life here a couple
[1:07:29] years ago. I have a few books on him.
[1:07:31] But when he was seeking the Holy Ghost,
[1:07:34] so he was preaching it, but he had never
[1:07:36] received it. And so he was praying and
[1:07:39] it got to where he was praying five
[1:07:42] hours a day. That's how serious it he
[1:07:45] was about seeking the Holy Ghost. And
[1:07:47] the Lord used him tremendously. I was
[1:07:49] thinking about that, his consecrated
[1:07:51] life and how the Lord used him.
[1:07:55] So, we are in the astronaut age. Lord,
[1:07:57] help me to get off my bicycle and get
[1:08:00] into the astronaut age. Amen. So, God
[1:08:03] bless you. Um, let's take these requests
[1:08:06] before the Lord. We have a little time
[1:08:09] to go before the Lord in prayer. And so,
[1:08:12] let's stand to our feet and we'll sing
[1:08:13] that. There was no other requests,
[1:08:16] right? Or announcements. There's no
[1:08:18] announcements. I don't think I believe
[1:08:20] the choir is moving forward every Sunday
[1:08:25] afternoon on till the meetings. There'll
[1:08:28] be choir rehearsal at 3:30. Keep that in
[1:08:30] prayer. Also, we will have another work
[1:08:33] day, but there is some little things
[1:08:34] that can be done that if someone has
[1:08:37] free time afterwards. There's a couple
[1:08:40] things that um that um if you have time
[1:08:44] to do that, uh work on that list. I
[1:08:48] think that's another way to do it. But
[1:08:49] there will be another workday November
[1:08:52] the 1st, right? Amen. So that's all I
[1:08:56] can think of for now. And uh God bless
[1:09:00] each of you. Let's sing that song,
[1:09:02] Amazing Grace, just as we before. Or I
[1:09:05] need you. I need you.
[1:09:08] I need you, Lord. I need you. I need
[1:09:14] thee. All
[1:09:16] I need thee
[1:09:22] every
[1:09:25] hour
[1:09:27] I need thee.
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:32] Oh, bless
[1:09:35] me now,
[1:09:38] my savior.
[1:09:43] I come
[1:09:47] to
[1:09:50] thee.
[1:09:54] I need
[1:09:57] thee. Oh,
[1:10:00] I need thee.
[1:10:06] Every
[1:10:08] hour
[1:10:11] I need thee.
[1:10:15] Oh,
[1:10:17] bless
[1:10:19] me now,
[1:10:22] my savior.
[1:10:25] your
[1:10:27] I come
