[34:53] home
[34:54] amen and uh
[35:00] we'll read this love
[35:03] chapter these words are just so
[35:07] powerful verse one of Corinth 1
[35:09] Corinthians 13 says though I speak with
[35:12] the tongue tongues of men and of angels
[35:15] and have not charity love I become the
[35:21] sounding brass and of a tinkling symbol
[35:23] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[35:26] and understand all Mysteries and all
[35:28] knowledge and though I have all faith
[35:30] and so that I can remove mountains and
[35:32] have not charity I'm
[35:34] nothing and though I besto all my goods
[35:36] to feed the poor and though I give my
[35:38] body to be burned and have not charity
[35:40] it profited me
[35:43] nothing charity or love suffereth long
[35:46] it's kind charity envieth not charity
[35:49] vth not itself it's not puffed up does
[35:52] not behave itself
[35:54] unseemingly seeketh not her own is not
[35:57] easy easily provoked thinketh no evil
[36:00] rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in
[36:03] the truth beareth all things believeth
[36:07] all things hopeth all things endureth
[36:10] all
[36:11] things love never faileth but whether
[36:13] there be prophecies they shall fail
[36:16] whether they be tongues they shall cease
[36:18] whether they be knowledge it shall
[36:20] vanish away for we know in part and we
[36:23] prophesy in part but when that which is
[36:25] perfect has come then that which is in
[36:27] part shall be done away when I was a
[36:30] child I spake as a child I understood as
[36:32] a child I I thought as a child but when
[36:34] I became a man I put away childish
[36:36] things for now we see through a glass
[36:39] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[36:42] in part but then shall I know even as I
[36:44] also am known now abideth faith hope and
[36:48] love these three but the greatest of
[36:49] these is love let's just
[36:52] pray gracious Heavenly Father we love
[36:55] you and we can say that because you
[36:57] first loved
[36:58] us Lord and it was your amazing grace
[37:01] that stooped down and found an empty
[37:03] case a hopeless
[37:05] life and brought
[37:07] meaning Lord and we we just want to be
[37:11] part of your purpose you said the bride
[37:12] was your purpose you said in fact some
[37:16] in her is summed up and manifested the
[37:18] entire wisdom and purpose of God and
[37:20] it's hard for us to Fathom that but we
[37:22] believe it because you said it help us
[37:25] Lord to just become part of your purpose
[37:29] that these shells Lord these just be
[37:32] like a dead Badger skin veiling the
[37:34] Shina glory to this world and help us to
[37:37] get out the way just to share from our
[37:39] hearts this evening Lord that you'd be
[37:40] glorified and be lifted up we ask it now
[37:44] in Jesus name amen God bless you can be
[37:47] seated there was one quote that I missed
[37:50] this morning and I thought it would be
[37:52] appropriate to read it just
[37:54] now if you are a Christian amen amen you
[37:57] will
[37:59] it's out of Pardon he says that's the
[38:01] reason the church is cooling off that's
[38:03] why the great Revival that just struck
[38:05] the land had put Millions into the
[38:07] church it it is they have to got to a
[38:10] place that they're using these
[38:11] experiences and so forth as a tradition
[38:14] instead of being Godly sorrowful and
[38:16] letting the Holy Spirit do the work of
[38:18] his office within you instead of letting
[38:21] the Holy Spirit do the work of his
[38:23] office within
[38:25] you and creating in You a New Life life
[38:28] and making you so hungry to go to church
[38:30] that you can't stay away from church if
[38:32] you are you
[38:34] will then that's what it is not not to
[38:37] sign tickets and join and have so forth
[38:39] It's to be it's to have the Life of
[38:41] Christ in you that just you just long to
[38:44] go it just longs to go there's something
[38:46] within you pushing
[38:48] you so I thought I would start with that
[38:50] but I do want to share a little bit of
[38:53] my testimony and and I have a heart for
[38:56] some of the younger people people I was
[38:58] once a younger
[39:00] person and um I was born in Alaska and
[39:03] raised there my my dad was a minister
[39:07] not in the message I wasn't raised in
[39:09] the
[39:11] message um he was a good man my grandma
[39:13] I
[39:14] think she was somebody that came on of
[39:17] that probably that Pentecostal Branch
[39:18] brother po her name was Ida she was from
[39:21] Mount iron Minnesota born in
[39:23] 1900 and she had the Holy Ghost simple I
[39:27] I I think there was no way for me to
[39:30] ever be an atheist because of my
[39:32] grandma because she lived
[39:34] it I saw simple
[39:38] Faith she was uh 93 when she finally
[39:41] passed but when she was about 90 my
[39:44] auntie could never get her to go to the
[39:47] doctor and uh so she convinced the
[39:49] doctor to come to her house which is
[39:51] kind of now was Insurance these days
[39:53] they don't do that but I remember
[39:55] sitting there by my grandma when the
[39:57] doctor came in with his little bag and
[39:59] grandma looked at him kind of suspicious
[40:01] and looked at my Aunt her daughter you
[40:03] know Auntie goes well Ma I got a doctor
[40:06] to come see you and she goes Jesus is my
[40:08] doctor that was my
[40:10] grandma and so from a young age I you
[40:13] know I'd go to church I was raised it
[40:15] was Assembly of God when we were real
[40:16] young and then as I got a little older
[40:19] my dad went to a kind of a charismatic
[40:21] fundamental whatever they call it church
[40:24] and
[40:25] um but you know I I I was raised in that
[40:28] and so I had a background to know right
[40:29] and wrong but I saw hypocrisy in
[40:32] church there was so many things that I
[40:34] couldn't quite Square I couldn't be an
[40:36] atheist but I was done I
[40:38] rebelled and um so I went out into the
[40:42] world and I was just living like as
[40:44] rough as you can
[40:45] get I got addicted to everything there
[40:47] was to be addicted to in that time frame
[40:49] it's worse now the designer drugs they
[40:52] had but you can't be playing in a rock
[40:54] band and not have access to all that
[40:56] kind of
[40:58] lifestyle I was hooked on smoking
[41:00] cigarettes and drugs and alcohol and
[41:03] just live it right at just living and
[41:06] yet my dad was a pastor and I'm sure it
[41:08] must have made him feel pretty
[41:10] rough you know but I've been searching
[41:13] and I knew and this is going to sound
[41:15] kind of ironic but it's my story I want
[41:17] to just give you a little bit of my
[41:19] testimony um this rock band the guy who
[41:22] was our league guitar player his name
[41:23] was Mark and um he was the roughest guy
[41:27] I ever knew when it came to partying he
[41:29] was just like times
[41:31] 10 and
[41:33] yet I I I kind of left that scene for a
[41:36] while and tried to get right with God
[41:37] because I just felt like the devil was
[41:40] fighting that battle you know I'm out
[41:41] there in the world and I I just not
[41:43] miserable a
[41:44] miserable the devil's a bad Taskmaster
[41:47] you know he convinces you that he's got
[41:49] this better way but he just kicks you
[41:51] when you're down he don't love on you he
[41:54] don't care about you he just tricks you
[41:56] into think you young people you think
[41:57] it's shiny out there it's nothing but
[42:02] heartache and I I saw I went back to the
[42:05] church for a while and started trying to
[42:08] make my life right again you know trying
[42:10] to be
[42:11] something and I heard about Billy Graham
[42:14] was coming to Anchorage
[42:15] Alaska and they were looking to have
[42:18] counselors for the Billy Graham crusade
[42:20] so I signed
[42:21] up and they sent a bunch of ministers to
[42:24] the churches in advance like a month in
[42:26] advance
[42:28] and I think remember brother Bram said
[42:29] how Billy Graham would go to a city get
[42:31] 30,000 comrades come back and couldn't
[42:32] find 30 well I think he probably heard
[42:34] brother Bram on tape say that so he
[42:36] thought he would find a way to solve
[42:37] that problem by getting ministers to go
[42:39] in in advance and get everybody kind of
[42:41] ready and then like follow up after he
[42:43] left so he started this
[42:46] program and so I went through all this
[42:49] these classes they sent brother Billy
[42:51] sends his team out to all these I call
[42:53] him brother Billy he was one of them
[42:54] Messengers don't be scared about that
[42:57] he's a good man I tell you what he has
[42:59] an anointing there was an anointing
[43:01] there but so I went through the classes
[43:03] and you had to take an oral and a
[43:04] written exam to pass
[43:06] it yeah to be an actual Cru you know
[43:10] Crusade counselor got a little badge and
[43:13] then You' sit in the audience and we
[43:15] were at the solivan arena that was like
[43:16] a big old you know Arena and Billy was
[43:19] kind of on this platform down their
[43:21] preaching and you would sit up in the
[43:22] audience and when you did the altar call
[43:24] and people started going down you would
[43:26] follow them down there and then walk
[43:27] them through Romans 3:23 for all of sin
[43:30] and come short of the glory of God
[43:31] Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is
[43:33] death you know you just walked them
[43:34] through the Salvation
[43:36] scriptures and but he also said put down
[43:39] on your list 10 people that you want to
[43:42] go to the biligram and get saved and be
[43:44] praying for them and so for a month the
[43:46] number one person on my list was Mark
[43:48] the guitar player in my
[43:51] band and so I'm praying for Mark and his
[43:54] wife Stacy and I'm I'm just you know and
[43:58] I went there was seven nights and he was
[44:00] there I went all six as a counselor one
[44:01] night I couldn't go the next day I'm at
[44:03] work I ran a warehouse I was really
[44:06] young I ran this warehouse and I get an
[44:09] intercom call back in the days you know
[44:10] was Jim come to the top you know
[44:12] whatever they give you an intercom over
[44:13] there here's Mark standing there and
[44:15] he's beaming he said I went to billly
[44:18] Graham last night and got saved I just
[44:19] jumped and shouted in my work now you
[44:22] think about this because he's the guy
[44:23] who gave me my
[44:25] tape so now now he's he's saved and he's
[44:29] doing good and he goes to some church
[44:31] for a while and I'm starting to
[44:33] backslide
[44:35] again and all of a sudden I heard he
[44:37] went into some
[44:39] cult my buddy the guitar player he's
[44:42] been going there for about a month and I
[44:45] thought I'm GNA go see my buddy Mark and
[44:47] see what he's got himself into and I get
[44:49] to his house and he wasn't quite home
[44:50] yet from work I'm sitting there with his
[44:52] wife Stacy and I looked at his bible and
[44:55] I see some notes in there serpent SE and
[44:57] I'm like what in the world has he got
[44:59] himself
[45:00] into and I thought you know
[45:03] what when he starts trying to point me
[45:05] to some other man besides Jesus Christ
[45:06] and get me to some other book besides
[45:07] the Bible I'm going to take him to
[45:10] task and thank God the Holy Spirit came
[45:13] to me and said if you want to be a good
[45:15] talker you got to be a better
[45:17] listener why don't you just listen to
[45:18] what Mark has to say and when he's done
[45:21] then you just take him in love to the
[45:22] Bible and to Jesus
[45:23] right well here's a guy who' been out
[45:26] there party with me had no background
[45:28] one month in the
[45:30] message and he preached me a three-hour
[45:33] sermon that blew my
[45:35] mind he went from Genesis to Revelation
[45:38] I for the first time I've been raised as
[45:40] a pastor's son I I taught in the chapel
[45:43] and I went to a Christian School all
[45:44] four years in my high school I I knew
[45:46] the Bible I
[45:48] thought but I could never Square things
[45:51] about our doctrine of the godhead or the
[45:54] evidence of speaking in tongues or any
[45:56] of those things I couldn't Square them
[45:57] and all of a sudden he's saying well Jim
[45:59] why was it
[46:00] blood why did she have to be born why
[46:02] did he have to be born of a
[46:06] virgin why why was it that all through
[46:08] the Scriptures it talked about that in
[46:10] the serpent had a seed where did that
[46:12] come from what was the fall what was
[46:14] this carnality why did and all a sudden
[46:16] the scriptures just went like like
[46:18] brother BR said the lashes of your eye
[46:19] or your shoelaces I just all of a sudden
[46:21] I was like scared almost about how he
[46:24] tied the Bible together in three hours
[46:26] he goes why seven Gentile Church ages
[46:28] this is not just seven churches of Asia
[46:29] Minor that Paul went and ministered to
[46:31] this is prophecy about seven Gentile
[46:33] Church ages man he just went and he was
[46:36] anointed and he says I want to give you
[46:38] this
[46:40] tape and he handed me my first tape
[46:42] there's a man here contr on the light
[46:44] now I had big hair I mean crazy hair if
[46:47] I didn't blow dry it out it was kinky
[46:49] curly like I put curlers in it and so
[46:52] I'd always tried to do the wave or the
[46:53] mullet or whatever was going on in the
[46:55] 80s rock band days
[46:57] so I had this big hair I was hooked on
[46:59] everything there was and I'm driving
[47:01] around my little truck listening to that
[47:03] tape for three
[47:05] days every time I was in that truck I
[47:07] was listening to that tape and all of a
[47:10] sudden I stopped and I
[47:11] thought when was the last time I had a
[47:15] cigarette I haven't
[47:18] drank I went to work and they said what
[47:20] happened to you I go what do you mean
[47:20] they go you used to cuss every other
[47:22] word like a sailor you don't

[47:26] happened to
[47:28] me and I started going what is this I've
[47:31] been to church all my
[47:33] life but I never had anything happened
[47:35] to me like
[47:36] this a miracle happened in my life

[47:41] life of me I tried he was
[47:44] gone no desire for I realized because I
[47:47] used to be having one here one burd in
[47:50] an astray reaching for another when I

[49:06] man and you know I just took I told you

[49:20] collection there is so I got me a
[49:22] duplicator and a bunch of empty boxes of
[49:24] cassettes and I went knocked on his door
[49:26] and he opened the door just come on in
[49:29] he had like about 300 tapes I duplicated
[49:31] everyone I could
[49:32] get um I was hungry I I just this was
[49:36] the I mean it just changed me I was so
[49:39] excited about how this word was opening
[49:40] up to me for the first time like it was
[49:42] alive I went to my my work and I
[49:45] everyone at work knew all a sudden Jim
[49:47] went from this crazy party in rock and
[49:48] roller to this I mean I have my church J
[49:51] book and my Bible in the breakroom you
[49:53] know I'd be sitting there reading I go
[49:55] to my office and close the door and I
[49:56] started reading in the church age book
[49:58] about the logos being the thought
[49:59] expressed and all of a sudden the word
[50:01] became alive to me and I put my head on
[50:02] my desk like he was there in the room
[50:04] with me he was becoming alive the
[50:06] written word was becoming a living word
[50:08] to me and I was so I had to have more
[50:10] and I had to have more and so I started
[50:12] getting the tapes and I tell you I
[50:13] listened to the tapes and listened to
[50:15] the tapes listened to the tapes got into
[50:17] the books I I saw the pastor studying
[50:19] there all the red books and little
[50:21] spoken word books I have you could go
[50:23] see my library it's they're dog eared
[50:25] and page and highlights and
[50:27] you look at my church age book I just
[50:29] became somebody who was hungry for the
[50:32] word but I started being called a
[50:35] theologian by the church group some of
[50:37] the people in there said Jim slow down
[50:39] buddy you know I would go to a place and
[50:43] they'd be talking about hunting and fish
[50:44] and I like to hunt and fish but I was
[50:45] wanting to talk about the word and they
[50:48] started making me feel like I was an
[50:49] oddball you could ask my wife I'd leave
[50:50] there crying like what's wrong with me
[50:52] everyone thinks I'm a fanatic you know
[50:56] and I got to where and I found out later
[50:59] it's probably a gift but I got to where
[51:00] these quotes will come like this now
[51:03] when that anointing falls on me I've had
[51:05] people say Jim I need to know where a
[51:06] quote's at and they would just and I
[51:07] would just tell them but it's just like
[51:09] the Lord does that well because so he
[51:11] started calling me oh Jim baates the Jim
[51:13] debates they call me because they
[51:15] couldn't they couldn't pull one over on
[51:16] me with their
[51:18] doctrines well BR and Brad didn't say
[51:20] that well brother Bram also said this so
[51:23] I was Jim debates the Theologian the
[51:25] quatic
[51:26] I kind of got this
[51:29] reputation and you know it got to where
[51:32] I started hearing some of the stuff of
[51:33] being preached and I was like that's not
[51:35] what brother Braham said I or I'd go and
[51:37] find a quote now I'm just going to tell
[51:38] you this is my
[51:42] testimony I saw where butter Braham said
[51:44] he was going to get a bear twice as big
[51:45] as the one in his den and I said okay to
[51:47] the ministers well where's this at oh
[51:50] stop it stop it stop it that's that that
[51:52] got broke or I go see you know I'm I so
[51:56] I'm sit there going if this is this is
[51:58] the truth man if this is thus sayith the
[52:00] Lord a vision or a prophecy then it's
[52:02] got to be butter BR said if you can find
[52:04] one place where I've messed up put a
[52:06] sign on my back false prophet that's so
[52:08] that's my mentality I'm just telling you
[52:09] my
[52:10] truth this is where I was at so I hear
[52:14] these brothers and I go to them well
[52:15] what about this did he ever get this
[52:16] tent like he was going to get or sh you
[52:19] start to sound like those guys down
[52:20] there you know they just start to tell
[52:22] me stop that so I got I was was like
[52:26] getting upset with this I was like you
[52:29] guys aren't saying what he
[52:31] said so I quit the
[52:34] church before tape churches were popular
[52:36] we just started for about three years I
[52:38] just started listening to the tapes
[52:40] little small couple
[52:42] families and I started getting anchored
[52:44] in this word even
[52:47] more and I got to where you know I'm
[52:50] just if that's the way they're going to
[52:51] be I'm not going to go hang out with
[52:52] them because they're denying this
[52:53] word now I'm just telling you my test I
[52:56] want you to listen because I got
[52:57] something I want to share with you that
[52:58] change my life even
[53:01] more so I'm in this kind of uh place and
[53:05] I thought you know I was reading where
[53:07] brother Bram said if you ever want to do
[53:09] something nice for me do it for my
[53:10] family is that how you feel brother Poe
[53:13] that's how I feel you know when someone
[53:14] does something nice for my family it
[53:15] just makes me feel like don't do it for
[53:16] me do it for my family bless my children
[53:19] bless my
[53:21] wife and I thought I want to get brother
[53:23] Billy Paul up here fishing
[53:26] so I wrote him I was I was you know
[53:28] sending some of my ties down there
[53:30] because I didn't have a church I didn't
[53:31] have a pastor at the time so I just
[53:35] picked a thing and I found William
[53:36] brandham Evangelical Association and
[53:37] started sending ties there found out
[53:39] later brother brandham actually created
[53:40] that and they sent me a little receipt
[53:42] about my ties I was a rebel I'm just
[53:44] telling you I was a
[53:46] rebel but I thought I was a good rebel I
[53:49] was passionate about this word and I and
[53:51] if you weren't saying what brother Bram
[53:52] said I was going to go after you cuz it
[53:54] was the precious thing that changed my
[53:56] life and deliver me from all this stuff
[53:58] this thing was so precious to me don't
[54:00] touch it leave it
[54:03] alone you know and so brother Billy Paul
[54:05] said brother Bates I'll come but you got
[54:07] to cooperate with that Pastor I said
[54:09] brother Billy he says brother Bates you
[54:11] want me to come I said yes sir so I want
[54:14] to brother Frank was our pastor and me
[54:16] and him were like loggerheads I mean we
[54:18] fussed I mean I'd go after him and he he
[54:21] didn't like it I'd pin his ears back and
[54:23] he was older than me and more in the
[54:24] mess he's longer than me but he couldn't
[54:26] quote the quotes like I
[54:27] could I'm just sharing with you my
[54:31] story and so I said brother Frank let's
[54:34] get together and get brother Billy Paul
[54:35] up here fishing he said okay brother
[54:37] Bates that's the prophet's son let's do
[54:39] that so we cooperated kind
[54:42] of and he was a pastor and the old
[54:45] Pastor there was a big Scandal the
[54:46] church had split there was the old
[54:47] Pastor now that brother Frank was a new
[54:49] pastor and there was a couple other
[54:52] factions and you know so we finally get
[54:54] brother Billy Paul up there and
[54:57] we're going to take him out fishing at
[54:58] this Lodge and I flew out early with one
[55:00] brother that I was just like that guy's
[55:02] off in the program you know that's what
[55:05] they called it actually back then they
[55:06] called itself the program so I'm like
[55:08] not going to have anything to do with
[55:09] that I read all about the nickel aans in
[55:11] my church age book I was equipped these
[55:14] guys Conquering the
[55:15] lady right you with me you guys this is
[55:17] probably some of your testimony
[55:20] too and so I had been talking to brother
[55:22] Billy I've been writing him letters I've
[55:24] been asking the same questions about the
[55:25] quotes these brothers were shut me down
[55:26] and brother Billy Paul was just like
[55:28] Daddy said it I believe it that settles
[55:29] it I was like man this guy believe he's
[55:31] a
[55:32] Believer I found some I could talk to
[55:34] that he's not going to just deny it he's
[55:36] just gonna you know and he didn't make
[55:37] he didn't interpret it to me he didn't
[55:39] explain it away he just said if Daddy
[55:40] said it if God thought it brother BR
[55:42] spoke it I believe that's that's brother
[55:43] Billy Paul you've heard him say that
[55:45] right so he gets up there and I thought
[55:47] man brother Billy Paul's gonna crack
[55:48] these guys head and straighten them all
[55:50] out I'm going to be Vindicated that I'm
[55:52] right and they're
[55:53] wrong so we got to this Lodge and we're
[55:55] fishing there about five factions of us
[55:57] all in different directions Old Pastor
[55:59] new pastor somebody from the program
[56:01] from up out of the states and then we
[56:03] had Wild Bill I don't know if ever you
[56:04] met Wild Bill but that guy was a class
[56:06] of his own if you ever heard brother
[56:07] Billy Paul or Brother David Bram talk
[56:09] about dark Brownie and tell that story
[56:10] they told it all over the world that
[56:11] happened in that Lodge that
[56:13] night so we get back to the lodge after
[56:16] fishing and we're sitting around this
[56:18] group of us
[56:20] brothers and
[56:22] uh I think it was David Bram was like 19
[56:25] early '90s 991 maybe 1991 or something
[56:27] like that and um Rush limbo had just
[56:31] come on the air and so David brand was
[56:34] like brings up politics and we're all
[56:36] talking about it and I watched brother
[56:38] Billy and all of a sudden he just how
[56:39] many of you knew brother Billy Paul
[56:42] first time that man hugged me I thought
[56:43] I was going to melt you never could feel
[56:44] real love like that we just read that
[56:47] love chapter you know it that's how he
[56:50] behaved those attributes is what I saw
[56:52] in that man now I'm not trying to
[56:53] glorify him he'd slapped me if he was
[56:55] here like brother B stop it but you know
[56:58] it's just what I saw in him and so then
[57:01] he goes he says well you know Daddy said
[57:03] in Jezebel religion that final attack
[57:05] would be on the White House he comes
[57:07] stomping out of the Wilderness you know
[57:08] here we go here we go we're going to get
[57:10] in third pole we're going to get in all
[57:11] this you know and he did but he did he
[57:14] took the conversation to to the
[57:16] message and then pretty soon you know we
[57:18] started to I'm ready to and then all a
[57:19] sudden he goes he says say say brother
[57:21] and he picked out somebody he goes you
[57:23] got a testimony tell me your
[57:25] testimony here's brother Frank telling
[57:27] about how he was a druggie he was so bad
[57:29] on acid that he said he couldn't even
[57:31] read a tape measure the little faces
[57:32] were looking at him telling him to kill
[57:33] himself he had to hug a tree to see if
[57:35] there was something real and then God
[57:38] saved him by this message and I'm
[57:40] listening to his testimony I'm like man
[57:45] God saved that
[57:46] man then he went to this brother he told
[57:48] his testimony this brother and pretty
[57:50] soon it started changing the atmosphere
[57:52] in the
[57:53] room and once that atmosphere started
[57:55] changing in brother Billy started
[57:57] telling testimonies about the angel of
[57:59] the Lord and his
[58:00] dad and the Ministries and the things
[58:03] that he saw and now it's starting to get
[58:05] really thick in there and then one one
[58:09] person had to get up and
[58:11] leave and there was an empty chair and
[58:14] brother Billy says you never notice when
[58:16] they you go to talking about him he says
[58:19] they come they draw an ey he says and
[58:21] there's always an and when he pointed
[58:22] that chair a bomb
[58:24] dropped I've never been in in a presence
[58:26] like that more powerful than
[58:29] that in that presence that love you know
[58:32] you've heard about people say it gets
[58:33] milky in the room you're in a presence
[58:36] where in that
[58:38] presence
[58:40] man you can't bring your stuff in
[58:42] there in your in that presence you love
[58:46] everyone in that presence you don't look
[58:48] down on anybody you don't think you're
[58:50] better than anybody else we were on our
[58:52] face on the floor crying we got up
[58:55] hugging each other we had a prayer
[58:56] meeting and a song service in a little
[58:58] Lodge in
[59:00] Alaska and it I I I was in a presence
[59:03] that I couldn't even I mean I felt like
[59:04] I was going to just I don't know fall
[59:06] apart you're not it's not a paranoid
[59:08] fear at all but you're in a reverence
[59:10] and and a love that just I can't
[59:14] explain and so the next morning I get up
[59:17] early I'm still like struck by this bomb
[59:20] that just dropped on me I'd been saved
[59:24] but God had delivered me he took me he
[59:25] took all those things away from me I was
[59:27] in love with this
[59:28] word but I want you to hear
[59:31] this so I get up early and I'm in we're
[59:33] on these little tiny cabins you know and
[59:34] this big Lodge where we were in and I
[59:37] was up early I thought I'm the first one
[59:38] up so I went outside and it's just quiet
[59:40] hearing the birds it's the beautiful
[59:41] Alaska there's this little Lake down
[59:42] there I look on the dock and there's
[59:44] brother Billy and Brother David are
[59:45] ready to fish they're already up and I
[59:48] don't know what I look like but brother
[59:49] Billy looked at me he said brother Bates
[59:51] and he motioned me down there and he
[59:52] says are you all right I saides sir he
[59:56] says you sure I said brother Billy it's
[59:57] just I'm still trying to absorb what
[59:59] happened last night he goes what Happ
[1:00:00] you know how brother Billy would fish he
[1:00:01] was fishing he goes what are you talking
[1:00:03] about brother
[1:00:04] Bates I said that love that came in the
[1:00:06] room he when I said the word love he
[1:00:08] grabbed me because he knew I caught it
[1:00:11] he grabbed me but you know how brother
[1:00:12] Billy was he'd be intense he grabbed me
[1:00:14] and he just pulled me in he says brother
[1:00:15] Bates he says if you think that was
[1:00:17] something you should have seen my
[1:00:19] dad and he started telling me about his
[1:00:22] dad he says I knew my dad better than
[1:00:23] anybody I had to take him from the
[1:00:25] pulpit he says brother Bates I had to
[1:00:27] make sure I didn't keep him there too
[1:00:28] long I had to make sure that you know I
[1:00:30] didn't take him too soon because then
[1:00:31] somebody wouldn't get healed and I and I
[1:00:33] was I took that job seriously he said I
[1:00:35] could read my dad like a book he says
[1:00:37] but I couldn't tell the difference
[1:00:38] between his friends and his enemies I
[1:00:39] said brother B I'm telling you the truth
[1:00:41] he said he treated everyone the same he
[1:00:43] said you know those men that just
[1:00:45] my daddy and he knew it he loved those
[1:00:48] men brother Bateson you can't Bluff
[1:00:51] that and I'm sitting here thinking I've
[1:00:53] been fussing with these brothers in that
[1:00:54] Lodge
[1:00:57] and I didn't love them
[1:01:00] right I didn't I couldn't separate them
[1:01:03] from what I thought was false
[1:01:05] Doctrine and yet God loved me when I was
[1:01:11] nobody and I sat there I said brother
[1:01:13] Billy and he says no brother ba you
[1:01:14] remember he said Daddy said nothing but
[1:01:16] perfect love will enter in over
[1:01:18] there he said what you felt last night
[1:01:21] he said if you would have been around my
[1:01:23] daddy you would have saw that every day
[1:01:28] and I thought man I said' brother Billy
[1:01:30] I don't know I said I he said 'now get
[1:01:32] that love brother Bates but stay in the
[1:01:33] front lines don't stop fighting just
[1:01:36] fight different you're not fighting your
[1:01:38] brothers you're fighting spiritual
[1:01:40] wickedness in high places it's the devil
[1:01:43] that tries to separate us it's the devil
[1:01:44] that tries to get us off over here
[1:01:46] looking at each other instead of that
[1:01:48] love that came in that
[1:01:49] room now I'm telling you my
[1:01:52] testimony so I went away from that Lodge
[1:01:54] and I was like praying now differently
[1:01:57] like Lord I need that Divine love what
[1:01:59] do I do and he spoke to my heart and
[1:02:01] said be brother Frank's
[1:02:03] friend I said well that's not too hard
[1:02:05] to do he's kind of a nice guy now I
[1:02:07] heard his
[1:02:09] testimony so I called him up now this
[1:02:11] I'm telling you that worked on this it
[1:02:13] worked here it started
[1:02:15] here you know the love starts with
[1:02:19] you and this church I feel the love here
[1:02:23] don't lose that get it stronger
[1:02:27] love one another love those others I
[1:02:29] mean I saw that at the prayer breakfast
[1:02:31] just loving all these other churches and
[1:02:32] pastors and all this just you know what
[1:02:34] it's not
[1:02:36] compromising it's just showing that love
[1:02:38] that God had for us when we were
[1:02:41] unlovable and so I I started calling him
[1:02:43] up let's go have coffee and he was a
[1:02:45] coffee connoisseur and got me hooked on
[1:02:47] breves and to this day brother Frank
[1:02:50] needs to repent for that but no
[1:02:52] I'm but I became his friend and and I I
[1:02:56] would start to go and help him I started
[1:02:58] and the Lord told me to go back to that
[1:03:00] church I said go back there you took me
[1:03:02] out of there he says brother Bates now
[1:03:04] you're ready go

[1:03:14] Brother Frank I'm gonna come here I'm
[1:03:15] not going to give you no trouble bring
[1:03:18] I'm gonna bring my family here I said

[1:03:33] started becoming friends we started
[1:03:35] talking and we started being able to
[1:03:37] communicate and then something else
[1:03:39] happened we brought brother Billy Paul
[1:03:40] up again
[1:03:42] fishing and he was dealing with me about

[1:09:05] place he liked to go get fish fish and
[1:09:08] chips we get there and we get our food

[1:09:26] what who do I think I am you know that
[1:09:28] little bit of fight still in me you know
[1:09:31] and so he just started taking like we
[1:09:32] had our drinking glasses he goes now
[1:09:34] what if he says what if that Pastor
[1:09:35] butter Frank's here and you're here who
[1:09:37] put you there I said God he say don't
[1:09:40] think God can put him there he said how
[1:09:42] are you going to do that if you don't if
[1:09:44] you don't have that love he started
[1:09:46] telling me stories about his dad he told
[1:09:48] me we sat there for probably two hours
[1:09:50] and he just talked to me like a big
[1:09:53] brother he said now I'm going to say
[1:09:55] happened to you and I said yes sir he
[1:09:56] said I'm going to give you some advice
[1:09:57] now you young people listen to me this
[1:10:00] might be good advice for you he says I
[1:10:02] want you to cooperate with everyone and
[1:10:04] compromise with no
[1:10:07] one I thought about that for to this day
[1:10:10] I think about it it's a Razor's Edge
[1:10:11] only the Holy Ghost could do that one
[1:10:13] it'll bump that way you're compromising
[1:10:15] one it'll bump that way you're not
[1:10:16] cooperating so I ask God every day Lord
[1:10:19] help me stay
[1:10:20] balanced I don't want to compromise on
[1:10:22] this word but I want to cooperate
[1:10:25] brother Braham cooperated he put his
[1:10:26] Circle bigger he didn't he didn't let
[1:10:28] them draw him out of their Circle he
[1:10:29] just put his Circle bigger drew them
[1:10:31] right back in brother Braham Liv the
[1:10:33] message he
[1:10:35] preached and it started to change my
[1:10:37] life I felt like I was like Peter can
[1:10:41] you imagine Peter that
[1:10:43] time Peter looked and he
[1:10:46] saw he saw his his word his the the most
[1:10:49] powerful force he'd ever seen that could
[1:10:51] ra speak to the storm raise the dead you
[1:10:54] know just multip of bread and
[1:10:56] Fishes now sweating it out in the garden
[1:10:59] soldiers were trying to drag him away
[1:11:02] and he pulled his sword and said I'm GNA
[1:11:03] protect this message I got you Lord
[1:11:07] chops an ear off Jesus said Peter you
[1:11:10] don't even have a clue what you're
[1:11:12] doing and the Lord showed me he says you
[1:11:14] don't need to protect this message Jim
[1:11:15] Bates you don't need to defend it it
[1:11:18] defends itself and when it looks weak
[1:11:20] it's not weak it's stronger than ever
[1:11:23] when Jesus went to Calvary it looked we
[1:11:25] but that was the word overcoming for
[1:11:27] Peter Peter needed salvation after
[1:11:28] you're converted Peter and God showed me
[1:11:31] that was in my life how many of you have
[1:11:33] been a little bit like Peter take your
[1:11:35] quotes and go whacking people and trying
[1:11:37] to fight and
[1:11:39] fuss just relax rest in this
[1:11:42] word and that's what God did to change
[1:11:44] my life it was like he delivered me of
[1:11:46] all those things but he started to show
[1:11:48] me this love without that love you're
[1:11:50] not going it's not compromising it's
[1:11:53] elective and it it corrects the air here
[1:11:55] but it does it like we just read doesn't
[1:11:58] behave itself unseemly it's not easily
[1:12:00] provoked it doesn't puff itself up it's
[1:12:01] not it doesn't do those things it
[1:12:03] believes all it endures all
[1:12:06] things and I just ask God every day Lord
[1:12:09] give me more of that
[1:12:12] love let me read you something I'm not
[1:12:14] going to take much longer brother but I
[1:12:16] got just a couple things for you and
[1:12:18] then we're going to close this but I
[1:12:19] want to read you something that BR Bram
[1:12:22] said he said love he said God's love
[1:12:25] love is the most powerful thing that
[1:12:26] there is in the world it conquers
[1:12:28] Anything Is Love by this you shall
[1:12:30] conquer by love divine love loving one
[1:12:32] another loving the cause of God loving
[1:12:34] Christ loving suffering Humanity that's
[1:12:36] how you
[1:12:38] conquer you know brother brandham
[1:12:40] stopped a bowl with love a charging Bowl
[1:12:43] Hornets in a
[1:12:45] nest a an insane man that was going to
[1:12:48] come up there to punch him out he said
[1:12:50] it was love he cast out Devils by love
[1:12:56] and so when Billy Paul told me he says
[1:12:57] brother Bates he says stay in the front
[1:12:58] lines just fight different I started
[1:13:00] realizing that the most powerful weapon
[1:13:02] we have is love it disarms the enemy he
[1:13:04] doesn't know what to do with that you're
[1:13:07] fighting back you're just playing in his
[1:13:08] ground then chopping with your sword so
[1:13:12] my advice to any young person here
[1:13:14] that's like I
[1:13:16] was this message meant everything to you
[1:13:19] and you want to defend it just get
[1:13:22] behind that get into Christ get into
[1:13:23] Christ and he is love and let him work
[1:13:25] through you get out of his way let him
[1:13:28] do his work I got another one for you
[1:13:30] this one's for the home he says love
[1:13:33] should go govern the home love is the
[1:13:35] greatest force that was ever put into
[1:13:37] the power of a man a home that's not
[1:13:39] disciplined by love is not much of a
[1:13:40] home if the husband and wife doesn't
[1:13:43] somly love each other they cannot trust
[1:13:45] each other that's why I think that
[1:13:46] instead of resting our faith upon some
[1:13:48] emotion which is all right or some gift
[1:13:51] which is all right like shouting
[1:13:52] speaking with tongues or with other
[1:13:53] things that we take for saying that we
[1:13:55] had the Holy Spirit when we do this
[1:13:57] those things are all right but if we
[1:13:58] would come back to the principle love
[1:14:00] first and then those things I think our
[1:14:02] church would progress a lot faster if we
[1:14:04] would get God first and God is love now
[1:14:07] he says love is two different words and
[1:14:09] he talked about the agapo and the pho
[1:14:11] right you got that up there that fast
[1:14:13] look at them this is awesome so the love
[1:14:16] you have for your wife agapo is the love
[1:14:18] divine love now that love you have for
[1:14:20] your wife and the love God Is So
[1:14:22] contrary just listen to the love that
[1:14:23] you have for your wife of a man insult
[1:14:25] her you would kill him on the spot with
[1:14:27] that kind of a love a filo love but with
[1:14:29] a goppo love you'd pray for his lost
[1:14:32] soul that be the difference there's two
[1:14:35] different types of love and I'm almost
[1:14:36] sure that many of us has been deceived
[1:14:38] with having fileo love thinking it's a
[1:14:40] goppo love filo love is in is
[1:14:44] intellectual agapo love comes from the
[1:14:46] heart that's human love affectionately
[1:14:48] love in Godly love Godly love doesn't
[1:14:50] question human love reasons but Godly
[1:14:53] love doesn't it's perfect in its Trust
[1:14:55] trust it's perfect it just produces
[1:14:56] faith when you really love Faith Works
[1:14:58] by love we need more faith to overcome
[1:15:01] we need more love we need that love from
[1:15:04] the heart the love of God the agapa love
[1:15:08] not the intellectual love that would
[1:15:09] want to go out there and whack somebody
[1:15:12] that you feel like has done you
[1:15:14] wrong in that presence I'm telling you
[1:15:16] in that presence and you've probably how
[1:15:18] many of you have been in that presence
[1:15:19] you know what I'm talking about it takes
[1:15:21] you you can't see you can't everybody
[1:15:23] looks lovely to you brother po
[1:15:26] I I couldn't in that presence I couldn't
[1:15:28] I couldn't be that guy anymore I
[1:15:29] couldn't be the same Jim Bates
[1:15:31] anymore and now brother Frank we still
[1:15:34] don't always agree on everything but I
[1:15:35] love that man he's one of my best
[1:15:36] friends and I would die for him that's
[1:15:38] the truth that's what the love of God
[1:15:40] can do to
[1:15:43] you I want to tell you a little story
[1:15:45] and I'm going to read you one more quote
[1:15:46] and then I'm
[1:15:47] done now I want you little girls to
[1:15:50] listen up you little boys I got a story
[1:15:52] for you there was this Christian home
[1:15:55] and there was a little girl in there how
[1:15:57] old are you sis with the black dress
[1:15:59] you're 11 years old maybe about that
[1:16:02] age and this little girl she'd go with
[1:16:05] her mom to the store a little Dime Store
[1:16:07] she saw this little cheap costume ring
[1:16:10] she really wanted it how many of your
[1:16:11] little girls wanted some
[1:16:12] jewelry ever she wanted that ring really
[1:16:15] bad mama yeah maybe it was $5 or
[1:16:18] something can I have that ring she said
[1:16:21] well maybe if you do your chores and
[1:16:22] save your money you can get it so this
[1:16:24] little girl does does her chores she
[1:16:25] works hard she does all the things her
[1:16:27] mama tells her she gets her little
[1:16:29] change and she saves up till she has
[1:16:30] enough money to buy that ring she goes
[1:16:32] and gets that ring and she's so happy
[1:16:33] and proud she's earned this
[1:16:35] thing and so she shows her daddy when he
[1:16:38] gets home daddy daddyy look what I got I
[1:16:40] got this ring and I I put all this into
[1:16:42] I saved up for it I did all these things
[1:16:43] and
[1:16:44] I and daddy would go up there every
[1:16:46] night to say prayers with her before she
[1:16:48] went to bed he said
[1:16:50] honey you love Daddy yes Daddy I love
[1:16:53] you would you give me that ring oh no
[1:16:57] Daddy I I couldn't do that every night
[1:17:00] week after week he'd say the same thing
[1:17:03] one day he went up there and she was
[1:17:04] sitting on the edge of her bed she had
[1:17:06] her head down and she was kind of like
[1:17:07] trembling a little bit daddy walked up
[1:17:09] to say prayers and she put her hand out
[1:17:12] he put his hand out and she dropped that
[1:17:13] little ring in
[1:17:15] there he said oh honey he said I've been
[1:17:17] waiting for you to do that he said' I
[1:17:20] got this real diamond ring for you that
[1:17:21] I've had all along just waiting for you
[1:17:22] to give that up now we think that
[1:17:25] doesn't sound fair that little girl
[1:17:26] earned that see that's how we are
[1:17:28] sometimes we hang on to something we
[1:17:29] feel like we deserve or earned we're
[1:17:31] hanging on to something but God's got
[1:17:33] something way bigger for you amen don't
[1:17:36] you know we you know I was I was there
[1:17:37] thinking I was doing something for God
[1:17:39] and I I had earned this I had done all
