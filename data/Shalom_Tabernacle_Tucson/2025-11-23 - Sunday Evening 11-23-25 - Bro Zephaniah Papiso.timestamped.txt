[2:22] and just feeling the presence of the
[2:25] Lord in the building and we know he's
[2:28] here again tonight. We have that promise
[2:29] where two or three are gathered
[2:30] together. He's in our midst. So we just
[2:32] want to welcome him and and I just want
[2:35] to give my all this morning. Do my part
[2:37] to create an atmosphere. How many will
[2:39] join me and say I'll I'll do my part

[2:52] Amen. We are standing on holy ground.
[2:56] We are standing
[3:02] on holy
[3:05] ground.
[3:11] And I know that there
[3:16] are angels
[3:19] all around.
[3:25] So let us praise
[3:33] Jesus
[3:34] now.
[3:40] For we are standing
[3:44] in his presence
[3:47] on holy
[3:49] ground. Sing that one more time to me.
[3:54] Yes, we are standing
[4:01] on holy
[4:04] ground.
[4:10] And I know that there are angels
[4:18] all around.
[4:24] So let us praise
[4:32] Jesus
[4:34] now.
[4:39] For we are standing
[4:44] in his presence
[4:47] on holy
[4:49] ground.
[4:57] As I come into your presence,
[5:02] past the gates of praise,
[5:06] into your sanctuary,
[5:10] till we're standing face to face.
[5:15] I look upon your countenance. I see the
[5:20] fullness of your face.
[5:25] I can only bow down
[5:30] and say
[5:32] that you are awesome in this place.
[5:38] Mighty God,
[5:42] you are awesome in this place
[5:47] of a father.
[5:50] You are worthy of my praise.
[5:55] To you our lives we raise.
[5:59] You are awesome in this place, mighty
[6:04] God. Tell him again, Lord, you are
[6:08] awesome in this place.
[6:12] Mighty God,
[6:16] you are awesome in this place. God of
[6:21] power.
[6:24] You are worthy of all praise.
[6:29] To you our lives we raise.
[6:33] You are awesome in this place. Mighty
[6:37] God.
[6:39] Yes you are awesome in this place.
[6:45] Mighty God.
[6:49] You are awesome in this place above
[6:54] Father.
[6:57] You are worthy of all praise.
[7:02] To you our lives we raise. Brother
[7:06] Chuck, would you come open our service
[7:07] with a word of prayer tonight? Mighty
[7:10] God,
[7:14] you are worthy of all praise.
[7:18] To you our lives we raise.
[7:23] You're awesome in this place, mighty
[7:28] God.
[7:30] Amen.
[7:34] Bless you,
[7:39] Lord. What a privilege it is to come
[7:41] into the house of the Lord tonight.
[7:44] Lord, just uh
[7:46] set our
[7:48] thoughts of the day aside, Lord God, and
[7:50] just concentrate on you, Father. Worship
[7:52] you in spirit and in truth as the word
[7:55] of God says. Lord, we just want to
[7:58] humble ourselves, Lord. Just come before
[8:01] you, Lord, and magnify your name, Lord.
[8:04] Hear your precious word of life. Ask you
[8:07] to anoint that word to our hearts, Lord,
[8:10] and our lives to your service. Father,
[8:13] we just love you and thank you so much
[8:14] for your amazing grace to us, Lord. Even
[8:17] giving us the desire to be here, Father.
[8:19] We just are so grateful, Lord Jesus.
[8:22] It's contrary to the things of the
[8:24] world, Lord. We don't want to identify
[8:27] with the world in any way, Father. We
[8:29] just just raise you up, Lord God. As you
[8:33] bless your children who have gathered
[8:34] together tonight, may you just come
[8:37] down, Lord God, and speak to each one,
[8:40] Lord. you know our needs before we ask
[8:42] them. Father, we just place them in your
[8:43] hands and just ask for your will to be
[8:46] done here. Grant it, Lord, we ask. And
[8:48] we ask these things in Jesus name,
[8:50] giving you thanks. Amen.
[9:03] But as he passes
[9:07] by,
[9:09] you will find
[9:12] he's not too busy
[9:15] to hear your heart's cry.
[9:21] He's passing
[9:23] by this moment.
[9:26] your knees to supply.
[9:31] Reach out
[9:34] and touch the Lord
[9:37] as he sing it one more time as you're
[9:40] seated tonight.
[9:42] Yes. Reach out and touch the Lord
[9:48] as he passes
[9:51] by.
[9:53] You will find
[9:56] he's not too busy
[9:59] to hear your heart's cry.
[10:05] He's passing
[10:07] by this moment,
[10:10] your needs to supply.
[10:16] Reach out and touch the Lord
[10:22] as he
[10:24] goes by.
[10:27] Amen. You can be seated.
[10:30] What a wonderful thought that is. You
[10:32] know, he's he's never too busy to hear
[10:34] your cry.
[10:35] I can look at myself and know that
[10:37] there's times when people have come to
[10:38] talk to me about something and you just
[10:40] maybe it's not a good time and you just
[10:43] you cut them short. They can tell that
[10:45] you don't have time for him at the
[10:47] moment, but he never is that way. And
[10:50] that's that's the example I want to I
[10:52] want to pattern. And regardless of what
[10:54] we're going through, he's there for us.
[10:57] He wants to hear about it. And he's paid
[11:00] the price for whatever we have need of,
[11:01] he's every need, he'll supply. Just so
[11:04] thankful for that. Through it all, I've
[11:06] learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned
[11:08] to trust in God.
[11:10] I've had many tears and sorrows.
[11:15] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[11:20] There have been times I didn't know
[11:22] right from wrong.
[11:27] But in every situation,
[11:31] God gave blessed consolation
[11:36] that my trials
[11:38] only come to make me strong.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; So I can say through it all.
[11:47] Yes.
[11:50] Through it all,
[11:52] I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[11:57] Oh, I've learned to trust in God.
[12:02] Through it all,
[12:05] oh, through it all,
[12:10] I have learned to depend upon his word.
[12:19] Now, I've been to lots of places
[12:24] and I've seen a lot of faces,
[12:28] there have been times I felt so alone.
[12:35] All but in those lonely hours,
[12:39] yes, those precious lonely hours,
[12:44] Jesus let me know
[12:47] that I was his all.
[12:50] Oh, he made me know that through it all.
[12:56] Yes. Through it all,
[13:01] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[13:05] Oh, I've learned to trust in God.
[13:10] Through it all,
[13:13] yes, through it all,
[13:18] I have learned to depend upon his word.
[13:23] Lord, how many can say they thank him
[13:24] for the mountains and the valleys
[13:26] tonight?
[13:28] Thank him for the mountains tonight.
[13:32] Thank him for the valleys.
[13:36] Thank him for the storm he's brought me
[13:39] through.
[13:43] Oh, for if I never had a problem, I'd
[13:48] never known that he could solve them.
[13:52] I'd never know what faith in God could
[13:56] do.
[13:59] So through it all,
[14:05] through it all,
[14:08] I have learned to trust in Jesus.
[14:13] I've learned to trust in God.
[14:18] Through it all,
[14:21] through it all,
[14:25] I have learned to depend upon his word.
[14:32] Yes, I have learned
[14:36] to depend upon his word.
[14:44] Amen.
[14:46] Amen.
[14:52] Jesus
[14:53] loves me.
[14:56] This I know
[15:00] for
[15:02] the Bible
[15:05] tells
[15:06] me so.
[15:09] Little
[15:11] ones
[15:13] to him
[15:15] belong.
[15:18] They are weak
[15:22] but he is strong.
[15:27] Yes
[15:29] Jesus
[15:31] loves me.
[15:35] Oh yes,
[15:38] Jesus
[15:40] loves me.
[15:43] Oh yes,
[15:47] Jesus loves me.
[15:52] Oh, the Bible
[15:55] tells me so. Let's sing that first verse
[15:58] one more time. Jesus loves me. Oh Jesus
[16:03] loves me.
[16:06] This I know
[16:10] for
[16:12] the Bible
[16:14] tells
[16:16] me so.
[16:19] Little ones
[16:22] to him belong.
[16:28] They are weak,
[16:31] but he is strong.
[16:35] Oh yes,
[16:38] Jesus
[16:40] loves me.
[16:44] Oh yes,
[16:46] Jesus
[16:48] loves me.
[16:52] Oh yes,
[16:55] Jesus
[16:57] loves me.
[17:01] The Bible
[17:03] tells
[17:05] me so.
[17:13] My boat of life
[17:16] sails on a troubled sea.
[17:21] whenever there's a wind in my s.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; But I have a friend
[17:34] &gt;&gt; who watches over me
[17:38] &gt;&gt; when that breeze turns into a g.
[17:48] I know the master of the wind.
[17:56] I know the maker of the rain.
[18:04] He can calm the storms. He'll make the
[18:09] sun to shine again.
[18:14] I know the master of the wind.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I soar
[18:25] like an eagle to the sky.
[18:30] Among the peace my soul can be found.
[18:38] An unexpected
[18:40] storm
[18:42] may drive me from the highs.
[18:46] It may bring me low, but it'll never
[18:50] bring me down.
[18:56] I know the master of the wind.
[19:05] I know the maker of the rain.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; He can calm the storms. He'll make the
[19:17] sun to shine again.
[19:22] I know the master of the wind. Stand as
[19:26] we sing it one more time.
[19:29] Oh,
[19:30] I know the master of the wind.
[19:39] I know the maker of the rain.
[19:47] He can calm the storm,
[19:50] make the sun to shine again.
[19:56] I know the master of the wind.
[20:01] He can calm the storm.
[20:04] He can calm the storm.
[20:07] He'll make the sun to shine again.
[20:14] I know the master of the wind.
[20:20] I'm so thankful for that tonight. Amen.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Joe, Joe Joe, if you would
[20:27] come for the request and we'll take up
[20:30] an offering, but brother Israel
[20:31] announced this morning we're going to
[20:32] take up a missionary offering that will
[20:35] be later in the service. So hold on to
[20:37] that one for now. And this will be the
[20:39] our normal ti and offerings that'll be
[20:40] taking up.
[20:54] Let's pray.
[20:56] Heavenly Father, we're thankful for this
[20:58] day, Lord. We're thankful to be ga
[21:00] gathered together once again, Lord
[21:03] Jesus, and the things we heard. It
[21:05] compels us, Father, to dig deeper, Lord,
[21:08] and to love your word more, Father, to
[21:11] search the uncarchable riches.
[21:14] Thank you for every mystery, the mystery
[21:17] of God in Christ. Lord Jesus, we see you
[21:20] in every verse of the Bible.
[21:23] Lord, just help us tonight. Father, you
[21:26] said if we draw an eye unto you, you
[21:28] draw an eye unto us. So Lord, let that
[21:30] be our portion, everyone's portion this
[21:32] evening. And Father, for our brother
[21:35] that would come and speak to us, we pray
[21:38] that you just bless him, Lord. Give him
[21:40] the uncction of the Holy Ghost.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, and help us in every way.
[21:45] Father, we pray for this offering which
[21:47] we're about to receive. Lord, let it go
[21:49] to the intended use of the work of God.
[21:52] Multiply it, Father, like you do the
[21:54] fishes and the loaves. And we'll give
[21:56] you all the glory and praise. In the
[21:58] name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen.
[22:10] Amen. Let's go to the key of G. Sister
[22:12] Sharon, he gets sweeter as the days go
[22:14] by.
[22:17] Well, the more I trust him, the more I
[22:20] love him. Nothing good for me. He'll
[22:23] deny.
[22:25] The longer I know him, the better I can
[22:28] show him. I couldn't stop now if I
[22:30] tried. For it gets sweeter
[22:35] as the days go by.
[22:39] Oh, it gets sweeter
[22:43] as the moments fly.
[22:47] His love is richer. Oh, it's deeper.
[22:52] It's fuller. So much sweeter. Oh, it's
[22:56] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter. As the days
[23:00] go by,
[23:03] oh the moment he saved me, his good
[23:07] grace he gave me placed his love down
[23:09] deep in my heart.
[23:12] His great joy in knowing with him I am
[23:15] growing and never more.
[23:19] Glory gets sweeter
[23:23] as the days go by.
[23:27] Oh, he gets sweeter
[23:31] as the days,
[23:33] as the moments fly. His love is richer.
[23:38] Oh, it's deeper.
[23:41] It's fuller, so much sweeter. Oh,
[23:45] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the days go
[23:49] by.
[23:51] Oh, it gets sweeter. Brother Trevor,
[23:54] will you come and sing for us tonight?
[23:56] As the days go by,
[24:00] yes, he gets sweeter.
[24:04] As the moments fly,
[24:08] his love is richer. Oh, deeper
[24:14] is fuller so much sweeter. Oh, sweeter,
[24:19] sweeter, sweeter as the days go by.
[24:28] Bless you.
[25:12] One day when heaven
[25:14] was filled with his praises,
[25:18] one day when sin was as black as could
[25:22] be,
[25:24] Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
[25:30] dwelt among men. My example is he.
[25:36] Word became flesh and the light shined
[25:40] among us. His glory revealed.
[25:48] Living he loved me. Dying he saved me.
[25:55] buried. He carried my sins far away.
[26:01] Rising, he justified
[26:04] freely forever.
[26:07] One day he's coming. Oh, glorious day.
[26:13] Oh, glorious day.
[26:22] One day they led him up Calvar's
[26:26] mountain.
[26:28] One day they nailed him to die on a
[26:32] tree.
[26:34] Suffering anguish, despised and
[26:38] rejected,
[26:40] bearing our sins. My redeemer is he.
[26:46] Hands that heal nations stretched out on
[26:50] a tree
[26:52] and took the nails for me.
[26:58] Living he loved me. Dying he saved me.
[27:04] Buried he carried my sins far away.
[27:10] rising. He justified
[27:13] freely forever.
[27:17] One day he's coming. Oh, glorious day.
[27:22] Oh, glorious day.
[27:32] One day the grave could conceal him no
[27:36] longer.
[27:38] One day the stone rolled away from the
[27:42] door.
[27:44] Then he arose over. Death he had
[27:48] conered.
[27:50] Now is ascended
[27:52] my lord ever more.
[27:56] Death could not hold him. The grave
[27:59] could not keep him from rising again.
[28:08] Living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me.
[28:14] Buried, he carried my sins far away.
[28:20] Rising he justified.
[28:23] Freely forever.
[28:26] One day he's coming.
[28:29] Oh, glorious day.
[28:33] Living, he loved me. Dying, he saved me.
[28:39] Buried, he carried my sins far away.
[28:45] Rising, he justified.
[28:48] Freely forever.
[28:51] One day he's coming.
[28:54] Oh glorious day.
[28:57] Oh glorious day.
[29:12] Amen. Let's all stand together tonight.
[29:23] Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing
[29:28] power? Are you washed in the blood of
[29:32] the lamb?
[29:34] Are you fully trusted in his grace this
[29:39] hour? Are you washed in the blood of the
[29:44] lamb?
[29:46] Oh, are you washed
[29:49] in the blood?
[29:52] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[29:58] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[30:02] white as snow? Are you washed in the
[30:06] blood of the lamb?
[30:10] Now are you walking daily by the
[30:14] Savior's side? Are you washed in the
[30:18] blood of the lamb?
[30:22] And do you rest each moment in the
[30:26] crucified?
[30:28] Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
[30:34] Oh, are you washed
[30:37] in the blood?
[30:40] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[30:46] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[30:50] white as snow? Are you washed in the
[30:54] blood of the lamb?
[30:58] Now when the bridegroom
[31:01] cometh, will your ro be wide, p your and
[31:05] wine in the blood of the lamb.
[31:10] And will your soul be ready for the
[31:14] fans?
[31:17] Oh, be washed in the blood of the lamb.
[31:22] Oh, are you washed
[31:26] in the blood?
[31:29] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[31:34] Now are your garments
[31:38] are they wise. as nor are you washed in
[31:43] the blood of the lamb.
[31:47] So lay aside
[31:49] any garments that are stained with sin.
[31:53] Oh, be washed in the blood of the lamb.
[31:59] For there's a fountain flowing for the
[32:03] soul unclean.
[32:06] be washed in the blood of the lamb.
[32:11] Or you wash
[32:14] in the blood
[32:18] in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[32:24] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[32:27] white as snow are you washed in the
[32:32] blood of the lamb? Oh yes, I'm washed.
[32:37] Yes, I'm washed in the blood.
[32:42] Oh, in the soul cleansing blood of the
[32:46] lamb.
[32:48] All my garments spotless. Oh, white as
[32:53] snow. I've been washed in the blood of
[32:58] the lamb.
[33:00] Oh yes, I'm washed
[33:03] in the blood.
[33:07] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[33:13] All my garments spotless,
[33:17] white as snow, heart wash in the blood
[33:22] of the lamb.
[33:27] Oh, I want to see him look upon his face
[33:33] there to sing forever
[33:37] of his saving grace
[33:40] on the streets of glory.
[33:44] Let me lift my voice.
[33:47] Here's all past home at last. Ever to
[33:51] rejoice
[33:53] now as I journey through the land.
[33:57] Singing as I go.
[34:00] Pointing souls to Calvary
[34:03] to the crimson flaw.
[34:07] Many arrows pierce my soul from without.
[34:12] Open my Lord. Oh, he leads me on and
[34:16] through him I must wait.
[34:20] Oh, I want to see him and look upon his
[34:25] face
[34:27] there to sing forever
[34:30] of his saving grace.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; On the streets of glory. Oh, let me lift
[34:38] my voice. Oh, cares all pass. Oh, at
[34:42] last ever to rejoice. And when in
[34:46] valleys low, I look. Wind and valleys.
[34:49] Lo, I look toward the mountain behind
[34:54] &gt;&gt; and behold my savior there. He's leading
[34:58] in the fire. And with a tender hand
[35:03] outstretched toward the valley long,
[35:06] he's guiding me. I can see as I onward.
[35:15] I want to see him. I want to look upon
[35:19] his face.
[35:20] Oh, there to sing forever
[35:24] of his saving grace
[35:28] on the streets of glory. Just let me
[35:32] lift my voice
[35:34] cares all past at last.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; This last verse went before me. Wow.
[35:44] Rise from the mighty name.
[35:48] Then my Lord directs my path. He does

[38:27] God bless each of you. We're so happy to
[38:29] be in the house of the Lord with you. We
[38:31] have our precious brother, brother
[38:33] Zephaniah
[38:35] Papiso
[38:36] um from uh South Africa and he's been
[38:40] with us before and we look forward to
[38:42] what the Lord has uh for us tonight. If
[38:45] he wants to share testimonies, he can do
[38:47] that. He has a tremendous testimony how
[38:49] he came in to the to the word of faith.
[38:52] He was a assemblies of God man and the
[38:55] Lord called him mightily and uh the Lord
[38:58] has used him in his ministry. Before he
[39:02] comes we have a birthday and that's
[39:04] Angel
[39:06] um my little brother Angel. What's his
[39:09] last name? Hernandez.
[39:13] Armano Angel. And I think he's prepping.
[39:16] He's a runner. How many know Angel's a
[39:18] runner?
[39:19] &gt;&gt; He's a long-distance runner. The Lord
[39:21] blessed him and his little craft there.
[39:24] But the main thing he's running for the
[39:25] Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; And we love our brother. And, uh, his
[39:30] birthday is on Tuesday. And so, um, we
[39:34] like to have him come forward and we're
[39:36] going to lay hands up on him and pray
[39:37] for him as requested. And, uh, we'll do
[39:41] that as he comes. And um maybe brother
[39:45] Zeke come and brother Joe come and we'll
[39:48] play we'll pray for brother Angel. And
[39:51] where's mom at? Mom can come too if she
[39:53] or she wants to stay back. All right.
[39:55] Come on. Amen. How many knows our lives
[39:59] belong to the Lord Jesus. How how old
[40:02] are you, Angel?
[40:04] Huh?
[40:06] Oh, he'll be 12 on Tuesday. 12 years
[40:09] old. Amen. And so come on up here.
[40:12] That's all right. This is our good
[40:14] friend. Uh last Thursday I had a little
[40:17] message. I was preaching. I had several
[40:19] scriptures and then I had some of the
[40:21] brothers um stand up and read. Angel was
[40:24] one of them and he's a good reader. So
[40:27] maybe we all use him a little bit more.
[40:28] Amen. So we'll pray from here. Come back
[40:31] down and let's pray. Let's bow our
[40:32] heads. Amen. Lord Jesus, we thank you
[40:36] for this life that you given our dear
[40:40] brother Angel. Lord, he is a true
[40:43] Christian. Lord,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; we believe that with all of our heart.
[40:47] We know the enemy would love to destroy
[40:49] his life and cause problems for him up
[40:52] the road. As the teenager years are just
[40:56] coming ahead, I pray you would guide him
[40:59] and guard him
[41:00] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost that he'll make it
[41:03] through those teenage years, Lord. Oh
[41:07] God, we see the gifts of God over him.
[41:11] We see the talents, Lord. We see the
[41:13] potential. But it's all nothing without
[41:16] you. And so we place our hands upon him
[41:19] to bless him, Lord. That you would bless
[41:21] him, Lord. His mother, his father, his
[41:24] family. In Jesus' name we pray. We thank
[41:27] you.
[41:29] Amen.
[41:31] Amen. Happy birthday, Angel. God be with
[41:34] you. Amen.
[41:36] So,
[41:40] yes. And there's a few other birthdays.

[43:20] somebody and see? When we've been there.

[44:44] Praise God.
[44:51] Amen. You may be seated.
[44:56] I I want to talk slowly because you
[45:00] might not hear what I'm saying
[45:03] uh according to yeah my accent. Thank
[45:06] you musicians. Thank you. God bless you.
[45:10] Um so much singing.
[45:14] I love it so much the way you've been
[45:16] singing here and I'm really enjoying it.
[45:18] Thank you John. Thank you church. Thank
[45:21] you pastor. Amen.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; If you've heard before that they say
[45:25] people in Africa sing so much you sing
[45:28] better than them.
[45:33] I'm so glad to be here and uh I bring
[45:37] greetings from back home. I spoke to my
[45:40] wife.
[45:42] Times are different. While it's morning
[45:45] here, it's evening with them. They are 9
[45:49] hours ahead of us. So,
[45:54] well, she sends her greetings,
[45:57] &gt;&gt; brother Karma. The brother that is
[46:00] narcissist to me when I'm not there, he
[46:03] takes the services. is so
[46:07] he really wants to be here himself. I I
[46:11] am so glad that I could be here. Um
[46:16] where I come from in South Africa, I am
[46:21] 1,000 kilometers from Cape Town. I'm 800
[46:26] kilometers from Johannesburg, 400
[46:30] kilometers from Debon and uh 600 from
[46:35] Debon and 400 km from Port Elizabeth.
[46:38] Those are
[46:40] big cities. Just showing you that I'm in
[46:43] the middle of nowhere
[46:46] in the Eastern Cape. Um I was shocked to
[46:51] hear that brother Bates,
[46:54] he was just asking where you from
[46:55] brother and I tell him that I'm from
[46:57] South Africa. From where in South
[46:59] Africa? I said Queenstown. Queenstown is
[47:02] uh
[47:04] 50 kilometers away from me. That's a
[47:07] little town that is very near to us.
[47:09] There's a most little one where I come
[47:11] from Lady Fry. And out of that one, 14
[47:15] kilometers out in the in the rural area.
[47:18] So I tell him, I'm from Queenstown. At
[47:20] least you will know Queenstown. He says,
[47:22] "Yes, yes, I know Queenstown. I know
[47:24] Lady Fra. I know Benu." And I thought,
[47:27] "What?"
[47:28] Only to find out they were there years
[47:31] back as a worldwide missionary outreach
[47:35] and he didn't know they were in my
[47:37] church. And that's the person that can
[47:40] tell you better of where I come from.
[47:43] He says they tried to to take a shortcut
[47:46] to go to my place and the shortcut ended
[47:49] up being a long cut
[47:51] rocks and things and then they got there
[47:54] but we had beautiful services. I was
[47:57] their interpreter and he didn't know
[47:59] that that was my place and I was so glad
[48:02] and I sent some pictures back home. Oh,
[48:05] they were so glad to see the pictures.
[48:07] Um yes and again I saw brother John
[48:10] Martin Ellen Martin this morning he was
[48:13] here at church he also went to that
[48:15] place and that now shows that many of
[48:20] you are still going to go there
[48:24] I met brother Israel two years ago I
[48:27] thought it was three it's two years ago
[48:30] when I came through with brother Roger
[48:32] Collins and then we met at Roger Collins
[48:36] and then I came here one evening and uh
[48:39] Wednesday evening and brother Israel
[48:41] said to me brother have you going to
[48:42] preach tonight and I thought I'm not
[48:44] preaching when you were still in the old
[48:47] building.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. So I am glad to see you all and I
[48:53] want to really congratulate you for this
[48:56] new building. God bless you. I sent uh
[49:02] the links back to my people back home so
[49:05] that they can see all the services that
[49:08] took place. I had promised brother
[49:10] Israel that uh I will be here for the
[49:13] dedication of this uh
[49:16] this uh church and the anniversary that
[49:20] you had. But yeah, as the time came by
[49:23] then I thought now I'm not making it
[49:25] because I didn't have any money. And I
[49:28] looked and I thought, "No, no ways. I
[49:30] must push." You know, I always push. I
[49:32] gonna push and be there. Anyway, then I
[49:35] checked my account. I had about 1,000
[49:39] US, which was exactly my my ticket to
[49:42] come over. And I took that. I sent to my
[49:45] sister-in-law. I said, "Book a book a
[49:46] book a flight for me. I'm going."
[49:49] And I like to do things like that.
[49:51] That's why I'm here now. And I've seen
[49:54] brother Israel in South Africa, I think
[49:56] two times. I don't know, two two times
[49:59] maybe. I think he was once on his own
[50:01] and the next time he was with sister
[50:03] Sharon. So,
[50:06] uh,
[50:08] okay, I just want to talk about those
[50:10] things before I get to the reading of
[50:12] the scripture. Um, this church is really
[50:16] beautiful. Eh, it's beautiful.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can just thank the Lord for
[50:22] it. Um,
[50:26] and I love you so much. I I I have a
[50:30] place in my heart for the believers in
[50:33] Phoenix. When I was there, not everyone
[50:36] was there. When I went with pastor to to
[50:39] Phoenix, not everyone was there, but I
[50:41] really love those people. Each time we
[50:44] we talked on the phone, I would ask him,
[50:46] you know, how about Phoenix? How are
[50:48] they doing? How are they doing? Then
[50:51] then I saw some of them here during the
[50:54] last weekend. I was uh so thankful. I
[50:57] don't know why, you know, my heart just
[51:00] moves like this when I think about them.
[51:02] And uh
[51:07] yes, now
[51:10] maybe about the testimonies and that I
[51:14] can just drop a testimony as I I move
[51:16] on. One thing good about the testimonies
[51:20] is that you
[51:23] you tell a testimony and I I don't don't
[51:26] get tired of telling a testimony
[51:29] and uh
[51:32] because you are telling the truth each
[51:34] time you tell it is the same as you told
[51:36] it before. So it's such a blessing.
[51:40] Maybe I shouldn't go back to the way you
[51:44] know I came in. It will take some time
[51:47] but uh
[51:49] the one that I've been telling now in
[51:52] the places that I've been is about my
[51:55] wife's grandmother
[51:58] her name was Katrude
[52:01] and uh
[52:03] we came in the message of course I'm
[52:06] from Assembly of God with my wife we got
[52:08] baptized I don't want to go into it
[52:10] brother it's going to take time and then
[52:14] Now
[52:16] the Lord helped me you know I I was in
[52:19] Johannesburg then I had to go back home
[52:21] to my closer people and spread the
[52:24] message over there and uh by God's grace
[52:28] I had that opportunity of translating
[52:31] the message
[52:32] &gt;&gt; into closer then it helped me a lot
[52:37] I was telling one brother that I I
[52:40] couldn't type because you had to type
[52:41] out what you you are translating then I
[52:43] couldn't not type. We had the old
[52:45] typewriters and I would go like this
[52:47] when I'm typing
[52:49] and it took a long time and then I
[52:52] decided later that I'll get somebody to
[52:55] do the typing for me. The little money
[52:57] that I was being paid then I had to cut
[53:00] it in half because I want the message to
[53:02] go out and pay this sister that was
[53:04] doing she was not a sister in the
[53:06] message then and that's how she came in
[53:09] when she was doing the typing. I'd let
[53:12] her do the typing and then share the
[53:14] message and let her do the typing and
[53:16] that's how she came in and uh so it
[53:21] really helped me to to get the message
[53:23] out there. Um
[53:26] I want to remember a few things. Then my
[53:31] wife's grandmother that is the mother to
[53:34] her father
[53:37] saw a a spoken word book that she
[53:39] carried when she went to visit her and
[53:43] on the cover page it was a photo of
[53:46] brother Brennham when brother Benam was
[53:49] still younger and then my wife tells me
[53:54] grandma said oh that's exactly him
[53:56] that's William Brennham I saw this man
[53:59] in 1951 when I was still a young lady
[54:01] working in in in in what you call in
[54:04] East London and uh she says
[54:09] it's him exactly he spoke and uh
[54:15] a lady by the name of Ununice had a big
[54:18] hump on her back and and she says
[54:21] brother Brennham he says William
[54:23] Brennham William Brennham spoke and that
[54:26] hump vanished like that
[54:30] Not only that, she says she had a long
[54:34] what on one of her fingers and then it
[54:38] says each time she was cutting bread,
[54:40] she was so careful that she mustn't cut
[54:42] the what from the finger. And then the
[54:45] day that she saw that miracle when she
[54:48] woke up the next day, look,
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; didn't even know which finger it was.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; There's not no one. It vanished.
[54:56] But the most important thing that I I
[54:59] thank the Lord for is that you know the
[55:02] Lord has got his ways.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; He brought me in
[55:07] and I went around and I brought in her
[55:11] granddaughter.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; My wife after that her two brothers.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; I brought them in. After that, the baby
[55:20] sister of theirs also in
[55:23] &gt;&gt; uh last Easter, we baptized my
[55:26] mother-in-law
[55:27] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[55:30] I'm so thankful about that. He know the
[55:33] Lord didn't lead her to go and see
[55:35] brother Brennham for nothing.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And the Lord knew we were coming.
[55:40] There's many, many more um testimonies,
[55:44] &gt;&gt; but I I'm so glad that I could see you
[55:46] here. When I first landed here in 2023,
[55:51] I don't know what happened. I was
[55:53] listening to some music, you know. I
[55:56] think I remember the song that I was
[55:58] playing when we landed into Tusan. Yeah.
[56:04] These are the days of Elijah. I was
[56:07] listening to that song and we're landing
[56:10] here and it's like I'm so full of joy
[56:13] like I'm landing into Israel. It was
[56:15] like I'm learning into the holy land. I
[56:18] don't know. I don't know. Somebody told
[56:20] me later that brother Brennan actually
[56:21] says something about Tusan being
[56:24] Jerusalem and that type of a thing. I
[56:26] don't know. I will know later. But then
[56:29] brothers and sisters um
[56:34] I'm really very glad to be here. I want
[56:37] to perhaps as I I carry on with the
[56:42] little message that I'm going to share
[56:43] with you tonight, I will get into touch
[56:46] into some of the testimonies. God
[56:48] willing. I want us to go to the
[56:51] scriptures
[56:53] and read.
[56:55] Friday morning, I woke up at the hotel
[56:58] where I was with a song in my heart.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; A song that I didn't know. I don't know
[57:03] now even. But the song was going like
[57:09] the shepherds, the shepherds, the
[57:11] shepherds. And I woke up and I sang the
[57:13] song. You know, it's a new song.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; But little later in the day, I forgot
[57:18] how the the the the the rhythm goes, the
[57:21] the the tune, but it was
[57:25] a loosey. Then I was singing all the
[57:27] shepherds, the shepherds, the shepherds.
[57:29] So I thought, let me hear about these
[57:31] shepherds. Let us read then from our
[57:34] scriptures. I want us to turn to the
[57:36] second book of Kings
[57:39] chapter 8 and we read verse 9. Could we
[57:44] all stand for the reading of the word
[57:46] please
[57:56] second book of Kings
[57:58] chapter
[58:01] 8
[58:03] and uh I'll read
[58:10] it shouldn't be kings No, no, it's not.
[58:15] It's the second book of Samuel.
[58:19] Why did I write Kings?
[58:31] I'm also depending on the scriptures
[58:33] that will pop up there.
[58:40] Second book of King of Samuel rather
[58:43] Samuel
[58:46] chapter 8.
[58:52] You know it happens many times that you
[58:54] you get a scripture you you write it
[58:58] only to find out you've written a wrong
[59:00] one. Even now it's not this scripture.
[59:03] Um,
[59:06] okay. I will get it. Saints, please bear
[59:09] with me.
[59:18] Let me look at the
[59:23] 1st Samuel. Let me check. 1st Samuel 8:9
[59:27] failing which will go back to the book
[59:29] of Kings
[59:32] because I want to read this scripture
[59:35] I can do without it
[59:38] because I've get I've got many other
[59:40] scriptures
[59:43] now it's not first Samuel it's not 8
[59:49] n of 2 Samuel let me see Oh,
[59:54] is the chapter that I didn't write? So,
[59:58] these are only verses. How will I know
[1:00:01] now? But anyway,
[1:00:05] let us turn to first Peter chapter 2
[1:00:07] verse 25. Let's leave that one alone.
[1:00:19] First Peter 2:25.
[1:00:30] Amen.
[1:00:32] It's the correct one. That one. Now,
[1:00:35] let us pray. Lord God, we thank you so
[1:00:38] much, Lord, that we can stand here to
[1:00:41] open your word. We learned from our
[1:00:44] prophet Lord that any man that's got two
[1:00:47] hands can push back the pages of the
[1:00:50] Bible. But it takes you Lord the great
[1:00:53] Holy Spirit
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; to come and reveal Lord and open up Lord
[1:00:58] what is contained in this scripture Lord
[1:01:00] as we read. It's a little thought in my
[1:01:03] heart, Lord, and I know it's from you
[1:01:05] when I heard that song about the
[1:01:07] shepherds, oh Lord, but Lord, may you
[1:01:10] come and talk to us, Lord, through your
[1:01:12] word as we read it. Heal the sick, Lord.
[1:01:15] Encourage, Lord, those that are weak, oh
[1:01:17] Lord God, and may we take courage, Lord,
[1:01:22] and
[1:01:23] get that closer walk with you. We pray
[1:01:26] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:01:28] Amen.
[1:01:36] that scripture that I wanted to to to
[1:01:38] read there, the prophet was talking to
[1:01:41] David and saying, "Go and tell David
[1:01:45] that I took him from following the sheep
[1:01:49] out there." So that's the scripture I
[1:01:51] wanted to read, but let's read this one.
[1:01:54] For you were as sheep going astray, but
[1:01:58] are now returned unto the shepherd and
[1:02:02] bishop
[1:02:03] of your souls. Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:02:09] Now
[1:02:12] when I had this little thought about the
[1:02:15] shepherds, I went and I listened to the
[1:02:17] message
[1:02:19] why it had to be shepherds that brother
[1:02:23] Brennham is preaching and I listened to
[1:02:26] the message through and I came back and
[1:02:28] listened to it again and I thought I
[1:02:30] must share that with you people. Amen.
[1:02:34] And uh brother Brennham
[1:02:37] the very first verse or paragraph that I
[1:02:41] saw of that message
[1:02:43] he was speaking and saying that I might
[1:02:48] not preach to you again. I am greeting
[1:02:51] you. It was about Christmas time.
[1:02:54] Amen.
[1:02:55] Maybe we we we we we can check the this
[1:02:59] message is 641221.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:03:10] he he carries on now to talk about uh
[1:03:17] the shepherd.
[1:03:19] And he says, "A shepherd
[1:03:23] is somebody that stays close to his
[1:03:26] sheep."
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; He says he stays so close to his sheep
[1:03:30] until
[1:03:32] he smells like a sheep.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; He says he even laughs like a sheep.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; He he laughs like a sheep. He says so
[1:03:42] close. And in some areas you find out
[1:03:46] that uh where they have a sheep fold
[1:03:49] where they keep the sheep. We do keep
[1:03:51] the sheep out there. So some shepherds
[1:03:55] won't even go inside a house. They will
[1:03:58] sleep at the entrance of that sheepfold.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; To look after the sheep.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; All right. So now carries on and on and
[1:04:07] on and on to say why did God choose
[1:04:11] shepherds to hear the good news of the
[1:04:14] birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Why did
[1:04:17] it had to be shepherds?
[1:04:19] And uh brother sister
[1:04:23] I encourage you to go. I know you know
[1:04:25] this message but you can read it again
[1:04:27] and again. By the way, I wanted to wish
[1:04:30] you a good Thanksgiving day coming
[1:04:34] Thursday. Is it on Thursday?
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you with your families
[1:04:38] wherever you will be. I will be in
[1:04:40] Jeffersonville, God willing. Now,
[1:04:44] brothers and sisters, Proam talks about
[1:04:47] this shepherd.
[1:04:49] The shepherd
[1:04:51] cares for the sheep so much that he even
[1:04:57] doesn't worry about his own life. The
[1:05:00] scripture I was reading about David, the
[1:05:01] Lord was saying to him, he was following
[1:05:04] the sheep, tending the sheep, going
[1:05:06] after the sheep. That was his job. And
[1:05:09] brother Brennham says most of the
[1:05:13] prophets, they were shepherds. There
[1:05:16] were those lowly men uneducated that
[1:05:18] were were attending shepherdship all
[1:05:21] over. He says almost all of them. But
[1:05:25] now
[1:05:26] I want to come to where now the Lord
[1:05:31] himself
[1:05:32] presents himself as a shepherd.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; We we we can go to the book of John
[1:05:39] chapter 10.
[1:05:44] I took it I took after pastor uh pastor
[1:05:49] Paul he read so many scriptures so I'm
[1:05:52] also reading many scriptures this
[1:05:54] morning if we go to this book of uh John
[1:05:57] chapter 10 chapter 10 and
[1:06:04] verse 7 then Jesus said
[1:06:09] then said Jesus unto them again verily
[1:06:12] Verily I say unto you, I am the door of
[1:06:14] the sheep.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; All that ever came before me are thieves
[1:06:20] and robbers.
[1:06:22] But the sheep did not hear them.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; I am the door. By me if any man enter
[1:06:29] in, he shall be saved and shall go in
[1:06:32] and out and find pasture.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; What a promise.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The thief cometh not, but for to
[1:06:40] steal and to kill and to destroy. I am
[1:06:44] come that they might have life and that
[1:06:46] they might have it more abundantly. I am
[1:06:50] the good shepherd.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's the title I wanted to give my
[1:06:54] message that let us follow the good
[1:06:57] shepherd.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:59] Because if you are lambs here, I don't
[1:07:04] see any goat.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; When I look around, I just see lambs all
[1:07:08] over. Do you know when we were at
[1:07:11] school, we were taught like a
[1:07:15] taught English like
[1:07:17] a a baby sheep is a lamb.
[1:07:22] A baby goat,
[1:07:24] they said he's a kid.
[1:07:28] And one day I heard brother Brennham
[1:07:30] speaking in one of his messages. He says
[1:07:32] you you're my kids in the gospel. And he
[1:07:35] said and he corrects himself. He says
[1:07:37] but you're not a kids. A kid is a goat.
[1:07:41] So he says no you are not you're not
[1:07:43] kids. You're my little lambs in the
[1:07:46] Lord. Now when I look at you I see only
[1:07:50] sheep. I see lambs of the Lord.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; I see Hallelujah.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. beautiful people. I see people
[1:07:58] that need to be fed of the Lord. People
[1:08:00] that need to be tendered by the Lord
[1:08:03] himself. I see people that are looking
[1:08:05] for a shepherd.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a a shepherd in this
[1:08:10] life, you will just perish. Let me put
[1:08:15] it that way.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; You should have a shepherd.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; So the Lord Jesus Christ says, "I'm a
[1:08:21] good shepherd."
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And now I will read on. He says, "Why do
[1:08:26] I say I am a good shepherd?
[1:08:31] The good shepherd giveth his life for
[1:08:34] the sheep.
[1:08:36] But he that is in hiring
[1:08:39] and not the shepherd whose own the sheep
[1:08:43] are not seeth the wolf coming and
[1:08:46] leaveth the sheep and fleth. and the
[1:08:50] wolf catcheth them and scatter the
[1:08:53] sheep. Now, now
[1:08:57] why I say we must follow this good
[1:08:59] shepherd is because there's other
[1:09:01] shepherds that are not shepherds.
[1:09:05] Because the Lord says here, this
[1:09:07] supposed to be a shepherd. He looks he
[1:09:11] doesn't look over the sheep. All he's
[1:09:13] looking at is when the wolf is coming so
[1:09:16] that he will not attack the wolf. He
[1:09:19] will run and leave the sheep alone
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; and the wolf comes around and scatters
[1:09:25] the sheep all all over. Now we must
[1:09:29] follow the good shepherd.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Now the good shepherd.
[1:09:36] Amen.
[1:09:41] Maybe we we can read from this message.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Before I go there, brother Brennan says
[1:09:50] one of the messages that he preached
[1:09:51] before this one in 1964, he says he
[1:09:54] preached one in Phoenix and one in
[1:09:57] Tusan. Yeah. The other one was why
[1:10:00] little Bethlehem. Still talking about
[1:10:03] the sheep and the shepherd. And he says
[1:10:05] there the Lord had to be born in a
[1:10:09] stable for he is a sh he's a sheep. He
[1:10:13] had to
[1:10:15] in what why little Bethlehem that's
[1:10:17] where he says he breaks down that word
[1:10:21] Bethlehem in Hebrew. In Hebrew it says
[1:10:26] bite which means house. Lem means bread.
[1:10:31] I know a little Hebrew.
[1:10:35] So that was the house of the bread.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; That place is called the house of the
[1:10:40] bread of God. Amen. Because Rabam says
[1:10:43] you can also al also push in l in
[1:10:46] between lam
[1:10:49] is bread. B his house. So he had to come
[1:10:54] as the bread of God. He had to be born
[1:10:56] not in any other place. Had to be born
[1:10:58] in Bethlehem.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. now
[1:11:04] on and on and then he says the next one
[1:11:07] he preached I think it was here in Tusan
[1:11:09] he says
[1:11:11] we have seen his star
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; in the east
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; and we have come to to worship him
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; that was Christmas time
[1:11:22] I didn't know Christmas was so close
[1:11:25] until we got to some of the restaurants
[1:11:26] here and when you get there they play
[1:11:29] Mary's boy child
[1:11:33] in all Christmas is just around the
[1:11:35] corner. But how happy are we? Because we
[1:11:39] know Christmas better than they know
[1:11:40] Christmas.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Because our Lord came as a little lamb
[1:11:45] and he was never born at Christmas time.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prom says he came as a lamb. He
[1:11:51] was born not in December but he was born
[1:11:54] in April
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; when little lambs are born.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; So it's okay. It's okay to remember that
[1:12:00] he was ever he he was born. It's okay to
[1:12:03] remember that. But for us, as the pastor
[1:12:06] said this morning, it's it's we were
[1:12:09] given to know the mysteries.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Don't you take that as an advantage that
[1:12:17] you know when exactly he was born.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; So now
[1:12:24] here are the shepherds.
[1:12:28] We can go and read in the book of Luke
[1:12:30] chapter 2
[1:12:34] and verse 8. I will hurry in the book of
[1:12:39] Luke chapter 2 verse 8.
[1:12:44] And they were in the same country
[1:12:47] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:12:50] watch over their flock by night. I don't
[1:12:53] know if you came across where brother
[1:12:55] Brennham says he's disputing that
[1:12:59] he was born in December in winter. Your
[1:13:03] winter and uh Palestine's winter in
[1:13:06] December. Back home is summer now. It's
[1:13:10] not winter. It's very hot in December.
[1:13:12] Our summer holidays are in December,
[1:13:15] November, December, January. That is
[1:13:17] summer. But Rem says, "Now, how could
[1:13:20] you find any any shepherds out there in
[1:13:25] the cold tending their sheep there when
[1:13:28] the snow is so
[1:13:32] snow all over?" He says, "It's
[1:13:34] impossible. It was not in winter when he
[1:13:37] was born in December."
[1:13:41] Brother, sister,
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I had pastor asking you what star is
[1:13:47] that when all are having birthdays and I
[1:13:50] looked at brother Brennham's birthday.
[1:13:52] Braam's birthday was in
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; April
[1:14:00] and I look you know you see the way it
[1:14:03] goes according to you know the Lord
[1:14:05] Jesus was born at the same time he also
[1:14:07] was born at the same time I don't want
[1:14:08] to go into that because the Lord Jesus
[1:14:11] was born in a stable and brother
[1:14:13] Brennham was born in a cabin
[1:14:16] in that shack in that little thing
[1:14:18] exactly like the Lord was born I don't
[1:14:20] want to go into
[1:14:21] Because brother Brennham when he grew up
[1:14:25] as a little tiny little boy he saw
[1:14:28] visions. The Lord Jesus when he was a
[1:14:31] little boy he spoke to the Pharisees and
[1:14:33] those people about the scriptures the
[1:14:35] things of the Lord. When he grew up he
[1:14:38] was loved by God that is Jesus but hated
[1:14:41] about the the by by the the the the
[1:14:44] Jews. Brother was loved by the Lord but
[1:14:48] hated by the people around him. I
[1:14:51] remember in the life story he says one
[1:14:53] day he was coming back from school
[1:14:55] carrying the books for one little lady
[1:14:58] there and a little girl and these boys
[1:15:00] were jealous of him. How can he do that?
[1:15:03] They came and they hit brother Brennham
[1:15:04] like that they hit him. What does he
[1:15:06] think he is? In fact, brother Brennham
[1:15:08] says he they didn't even approve
[1:15:13] the fact that he was white.
[1:15:17] Yes. because of the background of the
[1:15:19] grandmother that was Indian
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; and it went with him all the time that
[1:15:25] what does he think he is? Who does he
[1:15:27] think is carrying book for this
[1:15:29] beautiful girl? What? And they hit him.
[1:15:32] They hit him. So he says he ran to to to
[1:15:35] to his father's house and he came with a
[1:15:39] shotgun
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; determined to shoot them.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; He says going to shoot them. He says
[1:15:46] we got him. We got him. They walking.
[1:15:48] The grass is so tall and they walk. We
[1:15:50] got him. We got him. He says, "I got
[1:15:52] there and with my father's shotgun, I
[1:15:55] said, "Which one of you wants to die
[1:15:57] first
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; so that he doesn't see the others when
[1:16:00] they die?"
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And he tried to shoot and the gun
[1:16:03] wouldn't go off. He tried to shoot and
[1:16:07] says, "I was the type of a person that
[1:16:09] when I was angry, I would just laugh."
[1:16:13] And he says but the Lord wouldn't allow
[1:16:17] him to be a killer
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; otherwise there wouldn't have been those
[1:16:22] prayer for the sick that the great
[1:16:26] ministry of his
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; the Lord he keep him like that you want
[1:16:29] to know where when he grew up
[1:16:32] seeing those visions
[1:16:34] he went through I didn't know I was
[1:16:37] going to go there he went through
[1:16:40] very hard times
[1:16:43] until he lost his wife,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; he lost his daughter
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; and he was in such a desperate situation
[1:16:51] and he says the devil says to him
[1:16:56] when the Lord couldn't did not heal his
[1:16:58] wife and the devil says to him you pray
[1:17:01] for others now it's your own family your
[1:17:04] wife and your your your daughter he
[1:17:07] doesn't heal them and prophet says
[1:17:12] you I'm sorry church I won't be reading
[1:17:15] the the quotes all the time but I know
[1:17:18] what what I'm saying if you search and
[1:17:20] some of you remember already how it's
[1:17:22] like that I I and he says the devil says
[1:17:26] to him
[1:17:28] what do we make of it now he can't
[1:17:31] answer your own prayer he says I said
[1:17:34] then if he doesn't I will the Lord has
[1:17:39] given
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; the Lord God has taken.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; His name be praised. He didn't take what
[1:17:45] the devil was giving him until this one
[1:17:48] day. I want to come to this one.
[1:17:52] Do you know it was not easy for our Lord
[1:17:55] was never easy for our Lord.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; He would be preaching and they would be
[1:18:00] throwing stones on him. He would be
[1:18:03] healing the sick and they would they
[1:18:05] would take him him to court for that for
[1:18:07] healing the sick. It same with brother
[1:18:09] Brennan everywhere where not everybody
[1:18:12] clap their hands they wanted to know how
[1:18:15] do you do that with what authority how
[1:18:18] do you do it
[1:18:20] I'm sorry if you look at the the videos
[1:18:22] those old videos of brotherham sitting
[1:18:24] with all the ministers
[1:18:27] up front there and then when he's
[1:18:30] praying for the sick or discerning the
[1:18:32] thoughts and you you see some other
[1:18:33] brothers looking as if they're going to
[1:18:35] see how is he doing how does he do this
[1:18:38] thing, what where's the trick? Where's
[1:18:41] everything? But it was not so easy for
[1:18:43] it was not easy for brother Brennham
[1:18:45] until this one day. He says he was at
[1:18:47] work when he was working for
[1:18:50] public services. And he says he's
[1:18:53] climbing onto this one pole. He's
[1:18:55] climbing. He says, "I was singing on a
[1:18:58] hill far away stood an old rugged
[1:19:03] cross." He says, "I happened to turn and
[1:19:06] I saw on the shadow there. I saw my
[1:19:08] hands on that pole like that."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, it was my sins that
[1:19:13] you put you up there."
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You know what, brother, sister? It's not
[1:19:17] easy to leave your church and come and
[1:19:19] sit here. It's because the Lord has
[1:19:23] predestinated you to hear this message.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; It's because you are a seed.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; A predestinated seed. You have to come,
[1:19:30] you leave all those things. You come
[1:19:32] here. It's not very easy. And I look
[1:19:34] there, my brother, my sister, it took
[1:19:37] pains
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; for brother Brennham to bring this
[1:19:40] message.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I was
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, I thought I would bring those
[1:19:51] testimonies here. I was out of Cape Town
[1:19:54] in a place called Kaledon where a
[1:19:57] brother came. He had a picture in his
[1:20:00] hand, a photo of brother Brennham.
[1:20:02] Brother Brennan was in the Cape Town
[1:20:04] drill hall with back in 1951. And this
[1:20:07] brother brought this picture from the
[1:20:09] farm. He says there's an old lady there
[1:20:11] that's been keeping this photo for a
[1:20:13] long time. And you can you can see
[1:20:15] brother Brennham is under the power of
[1:20:17] the Holy Ghost. They take him out of of
[1:20:20] the hall there. And he's been keeping
[1:20:22] that one. And I took that I I sent it to
[1:20:25] Jeffersonville.
[1:20:26] And uh
[1:20:28] this brother says the old lady went on
[1:20:32] to say that day she was there. That day
[1:20:37] there was a a
[1:20:39] news reporter that was there taking
[1:20:42] pictures and that. But when he saw
[1:20:45] brother Brennan in that condition in the
[1:20:48] under the power of the Holy Ghost, this
[1:20:51] man just thought, I'm going to touch him
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; and see how it feels.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Guess how it felt. And he says he went,
[1:21:02] this man went and he touched brother
[1:21:03] Brennham.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And he tells them it was like an
[1:21:06] electric shock.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; It was like touching live power.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the man was not a believer.
[1:21:16] They say the next day he had his tie on.
[1:21:19] He was sitting in church. He was one of
[1:21:22] us. You know now
[1:21:28] it was not so easy. And then brotherham
[1:21:30] says it was my sins
[1:21:33] that put you up there.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; On that cross.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You know what I thought?
[1:21:38] I said again Lord
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; it was my sins.
[1:21:43] that put you up there
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; in that prophet of yours
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; for me this time so that I could see
[1:21:50] this message. Listen here. I'm not
[1:21:53] making brother Pam anything. I'm taking
[1:21:56] I'm just comparing. And I will never
[1:21:58] worship the prophet of God.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; But the Christ in him I will worship.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; The Christ in me. I will worship.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; The Christ in you. I will worship.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; But he unfolded this thing to us. If he
[1:22:15] didn't, you wouldn't be sitting here.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; If he didn't bear all the rep brooch. If
[1:22:21] he didn't take it to him to say even if
[1:22:24] I'm the only one
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; I will stand for this message then you
[1:22:32] know what my brother my sister
[1:22:36] then
[1:22:38] it brings me to this code that I want to
[1:22:40] read this one now
[1:22:42] yes I'm not going according to my notes
[1:22:44] now amen you know you you may put this
[1:22:48] one up this
[1:22:52] I wanted to get so much and I thought
[1:22:55] Lord
[1:22:57] it's 65410
[1:23:09] 654
[1:23:11] and uh
[1:23:16] Oh no.
[1:23:18] How I wish
[1:23:20] We we we we could I was so glad I didn't
[1:23:23] even write I didn't I didn't even write
[1:23:26] the title. No, but but
[1:23:32] can we get it up there? No,
[1:23:38] it's 65 0410 and I want paragraph 178.
[1:23:47] Okay,
[1:23:48] I just I'll wait for you, sister, if you
[1:23:51] can get it.
[1:24:00] Yes, it's this one.
[1:24:15] 650410. Sister.
[1:24:21] Okay. Okay. No, it's not.
[1:24:24] It is.
[1:24:26] Oh, God.
[1:24:29] Why? How can the enemy be such a thief?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; How can the enemy be such a thief? I was
[1:24:40] writing this this afternoon, sister. I'm
[1:24:42] sorry. It's not that one. But brother
[1:24:44] Brennham in this one says, "I can see my
[1:24:48] end yonder at 56 years old."
[1:24:54] If you get it that you get that one,
[1:24:55] sister, you may put it up.
[1:25:00] The thief is stealing it from me now.
[1:25:04] Was it that one? Oh, yeah. Oh, but okay.
[1:25:09] Let's go back there, sister.
[1:25:16] Because I I want to bring something here
[1:25:20] that is why Oh, was it this one? 178.
[1:25:23] Oh, remember we are flesh of his flesh.
[1:25:25] Is it where is it? We are flesh of his
[1:25:28] flesh. Bone or his bone if we are his
[1:25:32] bride. Death won't bother quickening
[1:25:36] power at all.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you very much. It's it
[1:25:40] though. the skin worms destroy this body
[1:25:42] yet in my flesh I shall see him
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; glory to God
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; and he says what I I don't know what I
[1:25:49] say what a hope for an old man like me
[1:25:54] knowing I see my end time right out here
[1:25:58] yonder soon at 56 years old I don't know
[1:26:03] the other quotes where he says this but
[1:26:06] this is eight months if I count
[1:26:09] correctly
[1:26:10] from the time that he passed on.
[1:26:13] You know, you you young people that are
[1:26:16] here, you are so fortunate like our dear
[1:26:19] brother Angel here that stood here and
[1:26:21] was prayed for.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; You you you you are so fortunate that
[1:26:26] the message get hold of you.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Before the world gets hold of you.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when the pastor was
[1:26:35] talking about the internet, you go in
[1:26:37] the internet, you you you just type
[1:26:39] William Brennham, all you hear is bad
[1:26:41] things. All you hear is he's a false
[1:26:44] prophet. The first thing that you hear,
[1:26:46] false prophet, this this this and they
[1:26:49] are saying, "Brother, sister, even some
[1:26:53] of those that were believing it now are
[1:26:58] starting to go astray." I can't imagine
[1:27:02] when you can grow in the message and be
[1:27:04] here listen to such preaching of the
[1:27:06] word listen to all these days and at the
[1:27:10] end you you you you come against that
[1:27:12] message that very I don't know how how
[1:27:15] it's possible
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; now that's what you get why don't they
[1:27:21] see that one
[1:27:24] where brother Brennham
[1:27:27] would see his death coming and say I am
[1:27:31] going when I'm 56
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; soon. Is that what he says?
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Why am I getting it wrong?
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; But when but when they say he's a false
[1:27:44] prophet, what about that one?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; That one only. If you you you you look
[1:27:52] in the internet that they will tell you
[1:27:54] a sister so and so prophesied about his
[1:27:57] death and brother so and so prophesied
[1:28:00] those denominational people coming back.
[1:28:02] But what about that one?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; It was not easy.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It was not easy for him. So now if you
[1:28:16] you were following me until
[1:28:20] I it was my first time to to see a man
[1:28:23] worldwide that is like brother Brennham
[1:28:26] that would all of his sermon the titles
[1:28:29] are just the word of God. all the titles
[1:28:32] to an extent that you would say
[1:28:38] you you you you would say that Jesus had
[1:28:42] his
[1:28:43] uh own messages like the mount the
[1:28:46] sermon on the mount like other messages
[1:28:49] that he had there until when the Lord
[1:28:52] was about to leave he had his very last
[1:28:56] message you know the message of the Lord
[1:28:58] Jesus Christ the last one that he
[1:29:02] Jesus communion.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Communion.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; In a Jewish place, synagogue.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; And when you come to brother, what is
[1:29:13] the last one that he preached?
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Am I wrong?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Communion
[1:29:19] in a Jewish synagogue here in the Old
[1:29:22] Testament.
[1:29:26] I'm not I'm not making brother anything
[1:29:29] than what God has made him.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; To come by God's grace and open up those
[1:29:39] mysteries that the pastor was talking
[1:29:41] about
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; to me and you.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; It was Christ in him that was doing
[1:29:46] that.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, you know when the Lord
[1:29:48] left the Lord Jesus Christ, I will not
[1:29:51] leave you alone. I will ask the father
[1:29:54] to give you the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Right? And brother, the Lord when he
[1:29:59] left, he didn't leave us alone. He left
[1:30:01] the word with us.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He left this word, the Bible.
[1:30:07] Amen. He left this this Bible with us.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Brother, you must take this inheritance.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; You must treasure this.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our prophet said read your Bible
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; and pray every day.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; This is not just a book.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is God in a word form.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You must take that. And the Lord
[1:30:33] left that that those pages. He left this
[1:30:37] word for us. We we treasure it so much.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; You know what happened when brother
[1:30:42] Brennham left?
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; What did he leave us with?
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:49] spoken word books.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; We use we used to have such a stack of
[1:30:56] books but we're privileged these days.
[1:30:58] You don't carry so much you know in your
[1:31:01] little gadget everything is there
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; all the 1,200 and something messages of
[1:31:08] in that little gadget.
[1:31:12] But I'm sorry to confess on our behalf
[1:31:16] on all of us. We are so lazy.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We are so because we we won't listen to
[1:31:24] the full message. Just take a code here,
[1:31:28] a code there, a code there. Sometimes
[1:31:32] you misconstrue it. You take this one
[1:31:34] where it doesn't belong. And instead of
[1:31:36] listening to the whole whole message, we
[1:31:38] have it there. He left us the spoken
[1:31:41] word. Not only the spoken word, he left
[1:31:44] us a voice this time.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Each time I read the messages, brother
[1:31:51] Brennham doesn't say, "Go and check in
[1:31:53] the book." He says, "Play back the
[1:31:55] tape."
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; And hear what I said. Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Even with
[1:32:03] even with indictment.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, that message I I translated that
[1:32:09] message when he talks to the
[1:32:10] denominational ministers and he says he
[1:32:13] will beg them. He says now don't switch
[1:32:16] off the tape now.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Listen on.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; He carries on that. He left that voice.
[1:32:23] That voice. And the Lord left the voice
[1:32:25] this time. The voice. You want me to
[1:32:28] read a go about the voice?
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; If you with me, you can read this one in
[1:32:35] the in the church age book. I think it's
[1:32:38] in page 157 of of the church age.
[1:32:44] Page 157 of the church age. It says uh
[1:32:47] this is the third paragraph. In every
[1:32:50] age, we have exactly the same pattern.
[1:32:53] That is why the light comes through some
[1:32:56] God-given messenger.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; In a certain area,
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; the light comes in a certain area to
[1:33:02] some God-given messenger. I know the
[1:33:05] messenger.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; And then from that messenger, there
[1:33:10] spreads the light
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; through the ministry of others
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; who have been faithfully taught.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; I think I had brother David Magguire
[1:33:20] here quoting that. He he said I never
[1:33:23] seen brother Brennham
[1:33:26] says many of us here didn't see him
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; but he says but if you meet people that
[1:33:33] ever met
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; brother Brennham there's difference in
[1:33:37] those people
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; he says and that's that's what I noticed
[1:33:44] also you know
[1:33:47] I was I didn't know that I loved brother
[1:33:51] Perry green so much
[1:33:54] until he left to be with the Lord
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; because you you can see in those people
[1:34:04] who any brother any brother any sister
[1:34:07] when brother Billy Paul came not because
[1:34:09] he's a son of brother Brennham because
[1:34:11] he had seen brother Brennham he had seen
[1:34:12] the angel let me put that one on as well
[1:34:15] you know when I first saw him in I
[1:34:17] thought what a difference this brother
[1:34:19] if he greets you come my Brother, come
[1:34:22] on. Brother, you're sorry. If he greets
[1:34:25] you, he doesn't say it like we do. God
[1:34:27] bless you. God bless you, sir. God bless
[1:34:31] you, sir. And he holds like that. So
[1:34:34] much love. Sit down, my brother. So,
[1:34:36] thank you, brother.
[1:34:39] So, so so much love. And you, you see a
[1:34:41] difference in this person.
[1:34:44] You know
[1:34:46] when he stands up to talk and say
[1:34:50] brother sister when I sing that song
[1:34:53] standing on the promises I don't want to
[1:34:55] be sitting in the premises
[1:34:59] and and you see him shaking that head
[1:35:01] and you think this man has been with
[1:35:04] him. You can tell he's been with him.
[1:35:06] Doesn't the scripture say like that? But
[1:35:08] then brother sister let's carry on with
[1:35:10] this message.
[1:35:12] those that are faithfully taught. But of
[1:35:15] course, all those who go out don't
[1:35:18] always learn how necessary it is to
[1:35:22] speak only
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; what the messenger has spoken.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Should I say it? I love you people here.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; I love you
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; for for listening to to to brother
[1:35:39] Brenham. Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Listening to that voice all the time.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, my brother was asking me
[1:35:46] when you listen to these days brother do
[1:35:48] you listen to English only or do you
[1:35:50] listen to a translator? It's my own
[1:35:52] voice on there from those
[1:35:56] but brother let me tell you how much I
[1:35:58] enjoy it with my own voice
[1:36:02] because when I was doing it I was just
[1:36:04] doing it for fun. I was not doing it for
[1:36:08] money.
[1:36:10] I tell you my brother,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; look at what I I'm not here to good
[1:36:16] about myself, but I'm just thinking
[1:36:19] taking the little
[1:36:23] wages,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; sharing it enough in order for the
[1:36:27] message to go to the people.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] to an extent that when people are
[1:36:32] listening to the message back home,
[1:36:35] I think Proam says the battle
[1:36:38] rages on or something of that sort and
[1:36:41] God give me a a a way of saying it in.
[1:36:49] You hear brothers that are English
[1:36:51] speaking that can speak English when
[1:36:53] they pray we hear them saying Lord your
[1:36:56] prophet said
[1:36:59] and I think to myself it was God that
[1:37:02] gave me that
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; otherwise they wouldn't stick with it
[1:37:05] they would you know brother Brennan will
[1:37:09] say things
[1:37:11] I love this prophet so much excuse me
[1:37:14] because brother Brennham will will say
[1:37:16] things there which I are so fitting like
[1:37:22] you will say you can't be inside the
[1:37:24] pawn shop and outside the pawn shop at
[1:37:26] the same time.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; And you'll say a river does not run up
[1:37:29] and down.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he will say
[1:37:34] a lot of other things. You can't be half
[1:37:36] a sheep and half a goat.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; No. and and he you know he puts all
[1:37:40] those things he brings and the the
[1:37:43] sayings the idioms that he uses
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; they fit our languages out there.
[1:37:53] I I was I was telling the the brothers
[1:37:55] this where he say
[1:37:59] can't call cattle greasy
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; and in our language
[1:38:07] directly the way he puts it
[1:38:12] a podcast called
[1:38:16] okay or black
[1:38:19] now
[1:38:21] I'm I'm reading on
[1:38:28] Paul wanted the people to say only what
[1:38:30] he said. That is 1 Corinthians 14:37.
[1:38:34] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:38:36] or spiritual, let him acknowledge that
[1:38:39] the things that I write unto you are the
[1:38:42] commandments of the Lord. What came the
[1:38:45] word of God out from you, or came it
[1:38:48] unto you only?
[1:38:50] They add here or take away there and
[1:38:54] soon the message is no longer pure.
[1:39:00] So we are not those people that take
[1:39:03] here and add there.
[1:39:06] We want to keep the message pure.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; As it was from the messenger.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] now
[1:39:18] and soon the me the message is no longer
[1:39:20] pure and uh
[1:39:24] the revival dies down
[1:39:27] once the message
[1:39:30] is not pure. The revival dies down.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; How careful we must be to hear one
[1:39:37] voice.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; He left us that voice.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:39:43] to hear that one voice.
[1:39:46] Not many voices.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; For the spirit has but one voice,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; which is the voice of God.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Paul Paul warned them to say what he
[1:39:59] said, even as Peter did. Likewise, he
[1:40:03] warned them that even he Paul could not
[1:40:07] change one word of what he had given
[1:40:12] been given by revelation or how
[1:40:14] important it is to hear the voice of God
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; by one way of his messenger and
[1:40:21] then say what has been given them to say
[1:40:26] to the churches.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; I have
[1:40:32] Now the
[1:40:34] is a shepherd that is a true shepherd.
[1:40:37] There is a shepherd that is not a true
[1:40:39] shepherd. When
[1:40:42] David would follow the sheep like like
[1:40:45] we do back home, you know the sheep are
[1:40:47] right in front of you and you turn them,
[1:40:49] you follow them. But now the Lord Jesus
[1:40:51] when he came, he he didn't follow the
[1:40:54] sheep. He walked before the sheep
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; and sheep follow him.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; You know there is a tribe back home the
[1:41:03] sutu tribe they are so good in tending
[1:41:06] the sheep. They train the sheep so much
[1:41:09] that they will walk and the sheep will
[1:41:11] follow. If you ever go to our country
[1:41:15] you'll see those suit people. They walk
[1:41:17] it will be green this side green this
[1:41:20] side. The sheep would maybe try to graze
[1:41:23] there, but they train them so much. They
[1:41:25] walk before the and the sheep follow
[1:41:30] the scripture and the sheep follow. We
[1:41:33] we we follow. We must follow the good
[1:41:35] shepherd. Brother, sister, that other
[1:41:38] shepherd that is not a a a real shepherd
[1:41:42] is a hiling that other shepherd. That
[1:41:45] one he wants money. Say I already said
[1:41:48] it. He wants money. He wants fame. He
[1:41:50] wants this. He wants that. But a real
[1:41:53] shepherd,
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; the Lord said he lays his life for the
[1:41:57] sheep.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; he he he walks before there. There are
[1:42:01] so many shepherds today. You know,
[1:42:05] people might think that they don't need
[1:42:06] a shepherd. But brother, sister, if you
[1:42:09] go out of this church, go around the
[1:42:12] corner, you will find a shepherd.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Because you are you are a sheep. Amen.
[1:42:17] There will be a shepherd. But it depends
[1:42:20] whether that is a good shepherd or a
[1:42:22] hire.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You know Balam.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Balam was called by Bailac.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; To go and cast the children of Israel.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Why did he call him? Because
[1:42:34] Bailo
[1:42:36] he he knew all the the mechanics. He
[1:42:39] knew the administration type of part of
[1:42:41] it. He will tell you when the church
[1:42:44] starts, when we must go out, how how
[1:42:47] long as songs must be sung that before
[1:42:50] before you know the pastor comes. He'll
[1:42:52] know all those things. He'll know how to
[1:42:54] put the money in the bank, how to take
[1:42:55] it out of the bank. That's Bailo. But
[1:42:57] Bailo was lacking that spirit. So he
[1:43:01] thought he'll go and hire another man. A
[1:43:03] man that can shout like I do perhaps a
[1:43:06] man that can can kind of stir everything
[1:43:10] up.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That baby like brother
[1:43:14] John can sing until you know we all get
[1:43:16] in the spirit. Amen. He'll try and get
[1:43:19] but he is a hirling.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; He's not a real shepherd.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; That is why we must follow the the good
[1:43:28] shepherd.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And that shepherd my dear brother. Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that shepherd, my dear
[1:43:36] brother, will take us from here
[1:43:39] into eternity. That's right.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And that shepherd is Jesus. Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That shepherd. Amen. I in this message
[1:43:50] uh
[1:43:54] why it had to be shepherds.
[1:43:57] I went paragraph
[1:44:00] 19. We'll read a few.
[1:44:03] My time is almost up. We read a few. Oh,
[1:44:07] it's gone already.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 19. And uh how it is. So then
[1:44:18] he was the bread of life as we taught
[1:44:22] last week in Phoenix
[1:44:25] or week before last as being the bread
[1:44:27] of life. He could come.
[1:44:30] He could come. No place else but the
[1:44:33] house of bread that is Be Bethlehem. And
[1:44:36] that was the why. Now here Jesus is born
[1:44:39] in Bethlehem. And in Bethlehem there was
[1:44:42] a synagogue. Great religious leaders
[1:44:45] lived in Bethlehem. David, great King
[1:44:48] Shepherd was born in Bethlehem. His
[1:44:51] father Jesse was born in Bethlehem.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; His grandfather Oette was born in
[1:44:55] Bethlehem.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; All the way back he come from Bethlehem.
[1:45:01] But I want to come now where where
[1:45:06] this good shepherd
[1:45:09] paragraph 25 we stay in this message.
[1:45:11] Let's jump to 25.
[1:45:16] 25. Notice angels coming and angels
[1:45:19] coming and giving their message to men
[1:45:22] of such low estate. Yes,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; when there were men there much more
[1:45:28] earthly thought of qualified than these
[1:45:30] poor illiterate shepherds.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; But he decided to come to the shepherds.
[1:45:35] The shepherd was the most illiterate of
[1:45:38] anybody. He didn't need to know nothing
[1:45:42] but just about the sheep.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; he didn't need to know mathematics.
[1:45:47] He didn't need to know how to split an
[1:45:50] atom. He didn't need to no scholarship.
[1:45:54] He just had to know his ship. That's all
[1:45:57] he needed to know. And God the great
[1:46:00] wisdom and the great founder of
[1:46:04] and resource of all wisdom would choose
[1:46:06] such a person as that person rather as
[1:46:09] that and bypass all the well-trained
[1:46:12] scholars that's trained to know that it
[1:46:15] speaks one thing that they were trained
[1:46:19] in the wrong field
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; passing up all the important of the
[1:46:23] land. There were important people, great
[1:46:26] teachers, kaiapas, the high priest, many
[1:46:30] of the great men, all Israel's mighty
[1:46:33] learned, all the denominations and all
[1:46:36] the boasting theologians. God bypassed
[1:46:40] every one of them. Now, God's wisdom.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; So, now let let me uh
[1:46:51] stop with those quotes.
[1:46:54] and uh
[1:46:58] talk to us
[1:47:00] the lambs
[1:47:03] that we must at all times follow the
[1:47:07] good shepherd
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; and the good shepherd is the Lord Jesus.
[1:47:11] Amen.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:47:16] I noticed and I thought
[1:47:21] it cost you a lot of money to build this
[1:47:24] building
[1:47:26] and to have the services over that
[1:47:28] weekend.
[1:47:30] But brother, sister, you know what? If
[1:47:33] you do something for the Lord,
[1:47:38] the Lord will do
[1:47:40] better things for you.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Big things than you you ever think of.
[1:47:47] There was a time back home when we had
[1:47:50] when we started out there. We had Easter
[1:47:53] services at my place. We didn't have
[1:47:58] a a place for church. We'd keep it in my
[1:48:01] home and we'd go to international people
[1:48:03] to rent their church buildings
[1:48:07] and
[1:48:09] I took
[1:48:11] I'll say it it's not out there back home
[1:48:14] now all the money I had and I put it in
[1:48:19] the work of the Lord.
[1:48:21] So, we had good a good time, a good
[1:48:24] time, a good time. And then after the
[1:48:26] services, no money for groceries,
[1:48:28] nothing.
[1:48:30] We had to take out some stuff from my uh
[1:48:37] mud hut.
[1:48:40] It's a for it was a for building.
[1:48:42] Anyway, we took out things and we put
[1:48:44] them in the in the shack
[1:48:47] at the back. And then now
[1:48:50] we busy taking those things back to the
[1:48:53] house. Now we have no money. We taking
[1:48:55] those but we're not complaining. We feel
[1:48:57] so good from the services. And guess
[1:49:00] what? Here is an envelope
[1:49:03] amongst the books there. I don't know
[1:49:06] where it came from.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; And when I opened the envelope has got
[1:49:10] money.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; About 600
[1:49:16] new notes. They all knew. I don't know
[1:49:19] when I put that in there.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord has just provided for me. And
[1:49:23] then brother, you know, one time a
[1:49:27] brother gave me some blocks to build a
[1:49:29] house because I didn't have a house. So
[1:49:31] a brother that was a businessman gave
[1:49:33] me, brother, you build yourself a house.
[1:49:35] And I decided, no ways. I'm not going to
[1:49:37] build no house. I'm going to take those
[1:49:39] blocks and give them to the church. So
[1:49:43] we start a church building.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; brother. And we we build it up to this
[1:49:49] height, if not higher than that, with
[1:49:52] those bricks. And the builder that we
[1:49:55] hired to go and do this thing, he says,
[1:49:57] "Uncle," because he was a nephew of
[1:49:59] mine. He says, "Uncle, why don't you
[1:50:01] build yourself a house? It would be good
[1:50:02] if this was your house." I said, "No,
[1:50:04] you don't know what you're talking
[1:50:05] about." I started by building brother,
[1:50:08] sister.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; When you follow the good shepherd,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Somebody said in a church, you become an
[1:50:15] asset. Yes.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; And not a liability.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Am I looking at your face? Look me in
[1:50:24] the eye now.
[1:50:27] Who's a liability here?
[1:50:33] But the Lord help us so much that we
[1:50:36] don't become liabilities, we become
[1:50:38] assets in the church.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; You do your thing. You open the door.
[1:50:42] Hallelujah. Another one sings up here.
[1:50:44] Another one accept, you know, welcomes
[1:50:47] all the guests. Another one do do this
[1:50:49] thing. You support your deacons. You
[1:50:51] support your pastor. Hallelujah. I was
[1:50:53] so glad I missed him this morning's
[1:50:55] prayer. Yesterday's morning prayer,
[1:50:57] brother. I'm so sorry I missed it and
[1:50:59] I'm so glad you're doing that. I I'm
[1:51:01] taking such a lot from you and I'm going
[1:51:04] to do it back home.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to before
[1:51:10] I go then my my time is already over.
[1:51:13] I'm looking there. Uh I'm taking only
[1:51:15] five minutes perhaps now. I'm dropping
[1:51:18] this testimony as well.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; I had a visitation.
[1:51:29] I was doing open air service
[1:51:34] downtown Johannesburg.
[1:51:38] And while I'm preaching there, you know,
[1:51:40] I'm preaching and preaching and carrying
[1:51:42] on
[1:51:43] While I thought I was doing so good now,
[1:51:46] here is a man that's lifted up his hand
[1:51:48] said,
[1:51:50] "May I ask a question?"
[1:51:52] And people were listening and he wants
[1:51:54] to disturb me now. But I listen to the
[1:51:56] Holy Ghost, he kind of said, "Give him a
[1:51:59] chance to ask a question."
[1:52:01] Those that are used to preaching open
[1:52:04] air meetings, you don't do that.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; So I I gave him because God said, "I
[1:52:10] must give him." He says, "When is the
[1:52:12] kingdom of God coming now?"
[1:52:16] And I said, "Sir, that is in the future.
[1:52:19] But if you accept the word of God that
[1:52:21] I'm preaching now, you are a candidate
[1:52:23] of that kingdom. It's coming."
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't tell me that. You don't
[1:52:29] know what I'm talking about. I'm talking
[1:52:31] about when Jesus is going to reign as a
[1:52:33] king yet." I said, "Yes, it's in the
[1:52:36] future." But then he says, "Where's the
[1:52:38] scripture for that?"
[1:52:39] Did I have a scripture? And he had drawn
[1:52:42] such a multitude to come and see now
[1:52:44] that a minister, a preacher is going to
[1:52:46] be defeated by this whatever you can
[1:52:50] call him. So there were so many people.
[1:52:52] He says, "Where is the scripture?
[1:52:54] Brother, sister,
[1:52:56] out of nowhere
[1:53:00] there stood a man from the crowd,
[1:53:06] darkish, shortish man. He says, "Here it
[1:53:09] is."
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And he quotes, you'll know where the
[1:53:13] scripture is. He says, "The kingdom of
[1:53:16] God is not coming with observation."
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Because it is within you. And then he
[1:53:22] sat down.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; I just said, "There you are."
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Then I carry on my preaching. And this
[1:53:28] guy says to me, "You don't know what I'm
[1:53:30] talking about." He says, "I'm a Bible
[1:53:33] scholar. You can't tell me anything."
[1:53:35] Brother, did I give him? And I said, "Do
[1:53:38] you know what Jesus said to the Bible
[1:53:40] scholars of his day?"
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "You generation of vipers."
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; And he was so mad. Now he comes, he
[1:53:47] wants to hit me. And when he did that,
[1:53:49] it was like I was feeling something
[1:53:53] hot on my shoulders. And I said, "Sir,
[1:53:57] you did not get me." I didn't say you
[1:53:59] are a generation of vipers. I said Jesus
[1:54:02] said to those of his day,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; "You are a gen." And he says that
[1:54:06] Bible's a liar.
[1:54:09] The very man that was a Bible scholar
[1:54:12] and he says that Bible is a liar. And
[1:54:14] now the young people that were came
[1:54:16] there they they they were on him and
[1:54:19] saying what do you think we must believe
[1:54:20] now? You you saying and I don't know
[1:54:24] where a lot of people came. They were
[1:54:26] say they were cheering and amening as I
[1:54:28] was carrying on. But brother this is
[1:54:30] what I want to to to to to highlight
[1:54:33] here.
[1:54:34] After that I thought let me go and pray.
[1:54:37] I felt like going and praying. Then I
[1:54:39] went to to to a place where we pray. A
[1:54:43] wife to that man that tried to disturb
[1:54:46] me. I was in tears. And the one brother
[1:54:49] was saying he says please forgive me.
[1:54:51] Ask the Lord to forgive me. Now then I
[1:54:53] went and I prayed.
[1:54:55] You know that visitation
[1:54:58] I will never forget.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; That man that read the scripture, I
[1:55:04] don't know where he came from.
[1:55:07] I don't know where he went.
[1:55:10] All I remember is that after that I
[1:55:13] never walked on that place again. It was
[1:55:16] on a park. We would be walking through
[1:55:19] Johannesburg running, you know, rushing
[1:55:20] for a train at the station. When I get
[1:55:22] to that place, I get so much fear. I
[1:55:25] walk around. I don't look for a long
[1:55:28] time.
[1:55:30] And brother, I tell you,
[1:55:33] I'm not imitating brother.
[1:55:37] Something took place that day and it was
[1:55:40] a visitation.
[1:55:42] I I don't know. I don't know. I don't
[1:55:44] know where that man came from. I don't
[1:55:46] know where he went. How could he just
[1:55:48] get the scripture like that to to say
[1:55:51] and brother sister but from that day on
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; no matter what time of the day where I
[1:55:58] would be rushing for a train when I got
[1:56:00] to that spot just about to cross that
[1:56:03] park some get so much fear then I walk
[1:56:05] around I walk around. Now what I wanted
[1:56:09] to encourage the church here is
[1:56:18] just take this one more code is the last
[1:56:21] one. I hope I will get a correct one.
[1:56:25] Very last one in question and answers on
[1:56:29] the seals
[1:56:31] 63324M.
[1:56:39] It will be question number 174.
[1:56:45] I don't know if you have that one
[1:56:47] sister.
[1:56:49] Question and answers on this 630324M
[1:56:54] and Question number 174.
[1:56:58] All right. Yes. Should evangelists
[1:57:02] continue on the field
[1:57:05] in this hour. Of course.
[1:57:08] What they mean? Sinal by all means don't
[1:57:11] change anything.
[1:57:13] If Jesus is coming in the morning,
[1:57:15] preach today like if it was going to be
[1:57:18] 10 years from today.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:21] But live like it's going to be at this
[1:57:25] hour.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Don't don't get scribbled up now. That's
[1:57:32] what I'm trying to warn you about. See,
[1:57:34] just don't be odd peculiar. Don't change
[1:57:38] nothing.
[1:57:39] But if you're doing something wrong or
[1:57:42] doing evil, repent.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; See, come back to God. continue on your
[1:57:47] evangelistic services service just as
[1:57:50] you always did. Now,
[1:57:54] if you're building a house, put it on
[1:57:57] up. If you're building this in this
[1:57:59] building, put it all up. Put it on up.
[1:58:01] And then he says, "Um, oh, amen. I'd
[1:58:06] rather be putting my money in something
[1:58:09] like that
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; than be found with it in my pocket."
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, with that one, I want to
[1:58:18] encourage you to to to carry on with the
[1:58:22] work of the Lord.
[1:58:25] And uh this

[1:58:44] Father.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; That good shepherd will will feed us of
[1:58:47] his word.

[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit will never mislead you.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:05] No.
[1:59:06] Some people
[1:59:10] I remember that that one quote that the
[1:59:12] pastor put up here
[1:59:15] during those services or was after that
[1:59:18] that weekend he put up a code here and
[1:59:20] I've been reading it where brother
[1:59:23] Brennan
[1:59:29] talks about that man
[1:59:31] that came and asked for a a sandwich and
[1:59:36] Rabanam says okay come on come on up
[1:59:38] says come on in fixing something to eat
[1:59:41] instead of g giving me a sandwich and he
[1:59:43] sat down and he ateam
[1:59:46] says the man was he didn't like to even
[1:59:49] call him a bum but the man was a bum and
[1:59:53] he says while he was eating I thought I
[1:59:57] must ask him some some some question
[2:00:00] seeing that he's a traveler he says I
[2:00:02] said,
[2:00:04] "Where do you come from?"
[2:00:07] And the man said, "Nowhere
[2:00:10] nowhere."
[2:00:12] And thought, I'll ask him another
[2:00:15] question and say, "But where are you
[2:00:18] going?"
[2:00:20] And the man said, "No way."
[2:00:24] And takes from that and says, "Some
[2:00:26] people just do that.
[2:00:30] They come to church
[2:00:32] and and just join church.
[2:00:36] They have no purpose in life.
[2:00:41] You know my brother, my sister,
[2:00:45] he says a person should have a purpose
[2:00:47] in life.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; You should know that you you you want
[2:00:51] you need to have the Holy Ghost
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; because the Lord when he left us here,
[2:00:55] he left us with a voice. But not only
[2:00:57] the voice he left with with the Holy
[2:01:00] Ghost.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; So that you must not get lost on the
[2:01:03] road. That's
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; He's the one that died for us.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; He's the true shepherd
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; that laid out down the life for us.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Now we cannot come to church just just
[2:01:15] to you. There was a song that used to be
[2:01:18] sung by the Okay, whoever is let me let
[2:01:22] me let me let me But the church goes
[2:01:25] like this.
[2:01:26] While we warming the seats,
[2:01:29] while we're warming the seats in the
[2:01:32] church where we go, do we take time to
[2:01:35] pray for the one who opens God's holy
[2:01:39] book to be given a word to say?
[2:01:44] We can blame ourselves
[2:01:47] when the church is called start moving
[2:01:49] for Jesus.
[2:01:52] We we we cannot be like a person that
[2:01:55] comes from nowhere goes to nowhere.
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; we we must we we we we are in a season
[2:02:04] now that people are just moving around.
[2:02:07] Back home where I come from, they change
[2:02:09] churches like I don't know what.
[2:02:12] Today they in pastor Israel, tomorrow
[2:02:14] they in my church, the day after
[2:02:16] tomorrow they another church. And this
[2:02:18] person doesn't even know what he's doing
[2:02:21] because you brother sister you should
[2:02:23] put your shoulder to the wheel. Help the
[2:02:26] church where you going. Brother Brennan
[2:02:28] says you you you in your in the church
[2:02:30] where you going. You must be a blessing.
[2:02:33] You must be a blessing. Amen. You you
[2:02:36] you must pray for the people. Oh
[2:02:39] brother, sister, let us bow our heads
[2:02:42] before we we we pray. I'm sorry I took
[2:02:45] so long. I didn't want to go into all
[2:02:48] the testimonies,
[2:02:50] but brother, sister, I had that little
[2:02:53] radio
[2:02:56] ministry that I was doing out there.
[2:02:58] People, my brother, my sister were
[2:03:00] getting healed there because I had
[2:03:03] decided that I will follow the good
[2:03:05] shepherd. I will do what the Lord puts
[2:03:07] in my heart.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I first came on there,
[2:03:12] brother, sister, I was paying 10,000
[2:03:15] rand.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, thank you.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; Every month for just one hour, every
[2:03:22] Sunday evening, brother, sister, you
[2:03:26] don't know how much it thrilled my heart
[2:03:28] to know that on the day that I started
[2:03:30] the radio ministry, it was brother
[2:03:33] Brennham's 100th birthday.
[2:03:36] And I thought to myself, I'm giving
[2:03:38] brother Brennan such a present. I'm
[2:03:41] playing his voice for my people to hear
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Lord
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; in this area all over here. And I didn't
[2:03:48] care how much I paid there. I'm doing
[2:03:52] something for the Lord.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; It's up to you, brother, sister. If you
[2:03:59] don't have the Holy Ghost, why don't you
[2:04:03] ask the Lord for the Holy Ghost?
[2:04:06] Why don't you pray
[2:04:08] so that the great shepherd
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; may lead you through.
[2:04:14] Thank you Jesus.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam until he left he would
[2:04:18] say if you are not baptized be baptized
[2:04:22] in the name of the Lord Jesus. I don't
[2:04:25] know why you should be just sitting
[2:04:28] and not coming to him, not saying I need
[2:04:32] that shepherd, Lord.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; I need to follow the good shepherd, not
[2:04:36] the one that is going to run away when
[2:04:39] he sees the wolf. Somebody said, "This
[2:04:42] man is not even looking after the sheep.
[2:04:44] He's looking which side the wolf will
[2:04:46] come so that he may run." But let that
[2:04:50] not be you today. How many brothers and
[2:04:55] sisters say tonight Lord,
[2:04:59] be my
[2:05:01] good shepherd.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; I know you are the good shepherd.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; you laid your life down for me.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; And now
[2:05:11] you are here as the Holy Ghost to come
[2:05:15] and lead me.
[2:05:17] Why don't they stumble over that one
[2:05:20] goat?
[2:05:23] 8 months before he left this
[2:05:28] world, this earth,
[2:05:31] he knew that my end is near
[2:05:36] soon ya when I'm 56 years old.
[2:05:41] Why don't they see that? And they will
[2:05:44] come and say, "Brother Brenham was wrong
[2:05:46] here, brother was wrong there." They
[2:05:47] come with all lies. But you brother,
[2:05:50] sister, the good shepherd is here for
[2:05:53] you.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Who says Lord I promise
[2:05:58] I want to follow the good shepherd.
[2:06:01] Thank you Lord. God bless you my dear
[2:06:03] sister. God bless you my brother. God
[2:06:06] bless you young man. God bless you. God
[2:06:09] bless you my dear sister. I I thought we
[2:06:11] would be closing our eyes and praying
[2:06:15] within us, Lord, that the good shepherd
[2:06:18] is here. That good shepherd will lead
[2:06:20] us. He knows our needs even before we we
[2:06:24] say them out. I want to thank you for
[2:06:28] your love offering.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me here. But even
[2:06:33] if I didn't have anything,
[2:06:36] but I'm so thankful that I could see you
[2:06:40] and I promise you that we will meet over
[2:06:43] there.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Each time we sing this song back home
[2:06:48] when the roll is called Aonda. I wish I
[2:06:51] could let people overseas listen to it.
[2:06:54] It's a promise to us.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; From us to you.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; Saying when the ro is called, I'll be
[2:07:02] there.
[2:07:03] Oh, brother Brennham, in the preview of
[2:07:05] the bride, he says he saw different
[2:07:08] nationalities.
[2:07:10] He could tell if this was African, if
[2:07:12] this was Japanese, if this was Chinese,
[2:07:15] all nationalities were there. And he
[2:07:17] says, I looked as they were marching
[2:07:19] there that bride in the preview of the
[2:07:23] bride until I saw two or three getting
[2:07:26] out of step.
[2:07:28] I can imagine brother Brennan not even
[2:07:32] realizing he he was in a vision and say
[2:07:35] get in line, get back in line.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was me that he saw but I know
[2:07:41] he saw me. I know he saw you. I know he
[2:07:44] saw all of us that are part of this
[2:07:46] bride in that preview of the bride. May
[2:07:50] God bless you. Make sure that you have
[2:07:54] that good shepherd.
[2:07:56] Thank you Jesus.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Lord God, I want to pray Lord
[2:08:02] before this church. Lord, I want to
[2:08:06] thank you for the pastor Lord that gave
[2:08:09] me a chance Lord to stand here. Lord,
[2:08:12] maybe I should have just stood and give
[2:08:15] given testimonies. Lord, there is this
[2:08:18] language barrier. But Lord God, I'm
[2:08:21] praying by all means, Lord, that the few
[2:08:24] things, Lord, that I could have said,
[2:08:25] Lord, I took a took me a long time. But
[2:08:28] Lord God, here's my sister over there,
[2:08:31] the young brother, that brother at the
[2:08:33] back, and that sister on my left, Lord
[2:08:36] God. And many that lifted up their
[2:08:38] hands, oh dear Jesus, I know, Lord, they
[2:08:41] don't lift up their hands. That's
[2:08:43] because they want me to see them. They
[2:08:45] want you to see them, Lord.
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; I pray for them, Lord. I pray for
[2:08:50] myself. I pray for the pastor. I pray
[2:08:53] for this church here Lord Jesus. May you
[2:08:56] Lord encourage them. Give them I see
[2:08:59] that Lord that they are in the right
[2:09:01] direction Lord. Following your word Lord
[2:09:04] following what the prophet of the age
[2:09:06] said following Lord what those mysteries
[2:09:09] were open to us. Oh Lord God we thank
[2:09:12] you so much tonight Lord. May you bless
[2:09:14] them Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:16] Christ. Why? With our heads still bowed,
[2:09:19] I want to ask who is going to be praying
[2:09:24] for me when I leave here.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; I would like to see that promise.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; As you lift up your hand as I give to
[2:09:33] over to my pastor, will you be praying
[2:09:35] for me?
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you. I remember once Beum said to
[2:09:41] me, "Each time you think of me, just
[2:09:43] pray for me."
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; And I'm doing that.

[2:12:44] offering. Dear Lord Jesus, as we have
[2:12:48] the opportunity to give to the kingdom
[2:12:50] of God. Lord, I pray that you would
[2:12:52] bless the gift and the giver. May you
[2:12:56] multiply it and may it be used for the
[2:12:59] purpose of the furtherance of the
[2:13:01] gospel, the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[2:13:04] Christ. Lord, we thank you that we have
[2:13:07] something to give. We thank you Lord
[2:13:11] that you have provided and everything
[2:13:15] actually belongs to you already.
[2:13:18] You own the cattle on the thousand
[2:13:20] hills.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; it's already yours.
[2:13:25] But Lord, you give us little things,
[2:13:27] little livingings, little meager things
[2:13:29] to live by.
[2:13:31] And Father, our stewardship is to be a
[2:13:34] good steward.
[2:13:37] And Lord, the things that you've given
[2:13:38] to us, we want to give it back to you.
[2:13:42] Lord, this is an opportunity, Lord, as
[2:13:44] you place it upon our heart to give to
[2:13:47] the missionary work.
[2:13:49] And I've tried to do that, Lord. I don't
[2:13:51] know exactly the best way, but to
[2:13:55] support the ministries that I know that
[2:13:58] are true.
[2:14:00] Give the saints the opportunity to be a
[2:14:02] part of that.
[2:14:04] And Lord, we thank you for these
[2:14:08] precious,
[2:14:09] precious saints here.
[2:14:12] the lambs, the sheep of God. They're
[2:14:15] wonderful people.
[2:14:17] They're family members. They're our
[2:14:18] friends, Lord. They're brothers and
[2:14:20] sisters that we'll spend eternity with.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, our thoughts towards them are only
[2:14:25] good, Lord. We thank you for them. We

[2:14:31] appreciate their prayers.
[2:14:33] I pray for them. They pray for me, Lord.
[2:14:37] And I appreciate the love you place in
[2:14:39] our heart towards each other.
[2:14:42] Oh God, may you bless them. Bless
[2:14:45] the work of our hands. Bless where we're
[2:14:49] going. Bless what we're building, what
[2:14:52] we're working on.
[2:14:54] Bless us, Lord, on the complex things in
[2:14:58] our life. Lord, that we would come
[2:15:00] through those victorious.
[2:15:03] Lord, as we heard the word tonight,
[2:15:05] Lord, Father, I just ask you, let it
[2:15:08] settle in our hearts and our minds,
[2:15:11] let the truth of it unlock in our spirit
[2:15:14] that we can walk in the truth of
[2:15:17] following the good shepherd. You are the
[2:15:20] good shepherd, Lord. We follow you
[2:15:22] closely.
[2:15:24] ask you'll bless this offering and as we

[2:15:35] the Thanksgiving season.
[2:15:39] But Lord, we're just so thankful for
[2:15:40] you. All that you've done for us. Bless
[2:15:44] us we pray. Bless this offering and
[2:15:47] those that give. In Jesus' name we ask.

[2:16:49] he touched me.
[2:16:52] and made
[2:16:54] me whole.

[2:17:07] savior
[2:17:11] as ses
[2:17:14] cleans and made
[2:17:17] me whole.
[2:17:24] I

[2:18:31] So, God bless you saints. God be with
[2:18:33] you. I trust the Lord will bless you and
[2:18:36] go with you. Amen. Maybe we'll sing one
[2:18:39] more just before we go. We'll sing that
[2:18:43] song.
