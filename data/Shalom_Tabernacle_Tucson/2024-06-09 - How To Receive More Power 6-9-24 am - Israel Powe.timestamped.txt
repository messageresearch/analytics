[0:00] for notice let me read it here it's in
[0:02] the the 10th
[0:04] verse and they cried with a loud voice
[0:07] saying how long oh Lord holy and true
[0:10] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[0:13] on them that dwelt on the earth and
[0:16] white robes were given to every one of
[0:18] them and it was said unto them that they
[0:23] should rest yet a little season see what
[0:27] a little season until their fellow
[0:30] see now what is it the prophets now are
[0:33] preaching to Israel see for thy fellow
[0:35] servants also thy fellow of
[0:39] servants and also thy
[0:41] Brethren that should be killed see once
[0:45] predestinated to be done so see to be
[0:49] killed as they were should be fulfilled
[0:54] see in other words it's
[0:57] predestinated to them it's the
[0:59] scriptures of they had to do it just
[1:01] rest for a little while now you got your
[1:03] robes you're going home and just sit
[1:04] there little while see wait just a
[1:06] little now notice now notice thy
[1:10] Brethren thy Brethren had yet be killed
[1:14] which means the 144,000 yet to be called
[1:18] in the
[1:20] tribulation 144,000 is called wish we
[1:23] had time we might get it tomorrow night
[1:24] if the Lord willing we but just before
[1:26] we get in on other seal see also now
[1:31] what they have to be martyred by the
[1:34] Antichrist we just come to and notice in
[1:36] his last ride where he breaks that
[1:38] Covenant then Jews down there in
[1:40] there these Jews
[1:43] 144,000 is to be called out by the two
[1:48] witnesses of Revelations
[1:51] 11 now you remember there was the
[1:53] prophesied you've read that how many's
[1:55] read that sure we all pled reading the
[1:58] scripture and they prophesy these two
[2:01] witnesses prophesy in the time of
[2:04] Daniel's second half of the 70
[2:08] week that is the last three and a half
[2:11] years remember how we took to Daniel 70
[2:13] week I said we need it when we got in
[2:15] here I didn't know why but something
[2:17] told me we need it here we
[2:19] are see notice in the time of Daniel I
[2:23] remember Daniel was told that the
[2:26] Messiah would come the prince the
[2:28] Messiah rather and and he would prophesy
[2:31] Israel still had 70 weeks left and in
[2:34] the midst of the 70 weeks the Messiah
[2:37] would be cut off and the daily sacrifice
[2:40] taken away is that right but there were
[2:43] still three and a half weeks determined
[2:46] in this block he takes the Gentile bride
[2:49] now she goes up and when she goes up two
[2:52] prophets arrive to Israel see and those
[2:56] Souls that's been martyred now down
[2:58] through your real true Jews down through
[3:00] there that had their name on the book
[3:02] that Liv the right life and done the
[3:03] right thing Liv Judaism to their do they
[3:07] were murdered by aan and many others
[3:09] honest people millions of them go down
[3:12] there and them Germans shot them to
[3:14] death and murdered them and killed them
[3:15] and hung them on fences and burn them up
[3:17] and create them and everything else that
[3:20] bloodless blood hearted hungry Hitler
[3:23] and staling and muscan and all that
[3:26] people that hated them Jews I think
[3:29] that's it one of the one of the things
[3:30] is holding this nation together because
[3:31] he've already respected the Jew amen
[3:35] give him a place you honor the Jew and
[3:37] God honor you now there's a bunch of
[3:40] Jews as Renegades just like there's
[3:42] Gentiles the same way but the real Jew
[3:44] God's put his name on the book before
[3:46] the foundation of the world and here he
[3:48] was murdered down in this time and
[3:49] remember think of it now how perfect
[3:51] this is right after that millions of
[3:54] slaughtered Jews innocent people by the
[3:56] nations of the world here the scripture
[3:58] says right in this time that they each
[4:02] one under the altar realize what's
[4:04] happened and they're given white robes
[4:06] and they said well what can't we go back
[4:08] to the kingdom right now the Jewish
[4:10] Kingdom to be set on the earth you know
[4:11] John said the kingdom of to be set not
[4:14] this is the kingdom of the Gospel you
[4:15] see but the kingdom of Jews will be
[4:17] preached by these these two prophets so
[4:19] notice the the kingdom of the earth here
[4:22] the Kingdom of Heaven is preached by the
[4:23] Jews uh to I mean to the Gentile the
[4:26] kingdom of here on the earth is be set
[4:27] up in the Millennium uh after the
[4:29] millennium the Jews now notice notice
[4:31] this now here why they why they're
[4:33] preaching see before these these
[4:37] prophets ever rise on the scene these
[4:39] Jews that had to die under I them is
[4:42] each one of them that is predestinated
[4:44] is given by Grace a white
[4:47] r each one of them giving him white r
[4:50] notice now what happens as soon as that
[4:53] takes place I'm watching that clock back
[4:55] there I know we're we're getting late
[4:57] but I don't want see I no that poor fell
[5:00] stand there God help you brother I hope
[5:02] each one of us get a white Rob that day
[5:05] standing changing back and forth with
[5:07] legs are hurting somebody worked all day
[5:09] I know what that is and look here and
[5:11] some of the poor little old women stand
[5:13] I notic some of these men give the women
[5:15] their seats and somebody else give some
[5:16] portal the mother of the baby and I I I
[5:19] see all that I'm sure he does notice but
[5:22] I don't want to keep you too long I just
[5:24] get you to see the message that's all I
[5:25] want you to do see now notice these Jews
[5:28] I have to do this in order to let you
[5:30] see the revelation of this seal see what
[5:32] it is the soier Under The Altar and who
[5:34] they are now notice in the time of
[5:37] Daniel now the second half of the 70th
[5:40] week now remember Messiah was to be cut
[5:43] off in the midst that's the middle
[5:46] what's half of seven three and a half
[5:48] how long did Christ preach three and
[5:50] that's right W but there is determined
[5:52] yet to the people what another three and
[5:55] A2 years well during this time well see
[5:59] what happened s is the Gentile bride is
[6:02] selected in the seven Church ages and
[6:04] goes
[6:06] up and when it does that way all these
[6:09] Jews is martyred along there because of
[6:11] blindness laying under the altar God
[6:13] comes over and says you see what it was
[6:14] now I'll give each one of you robe they
[6:16] said how long Lord are we going in now
[6:18] said no no no no your fellow man the
[6:21] Jews has got to suffer a little bit yet
[6:23] they got to be martyred like you was
[6:25] martyred the Beast has got to get them
[6:27] when he breaks his Covenant now notice
[6:29] and now notice
[6:32] once now just remember these prophets
[6:36] are to prophesy according to Revelations
[6:38] 11 you you rais your hands you read it
[6:40] see and they're given power and we're
[6:42] going to find out who they are just in a
[6:44] minute Lord I notice who these prophets
[6:46] are and now the Bible tells it here sure
[6:49] they does sure see I notice in the
[6:52] middle of this three and a half weeks
[6:55] now that they're prophesying down here
[6:57] and the the revelations here said and
[6:59] they they
[7:01] prophesy
[7:04] 1,3 and2 score
[7:08] days if now the regular Jewish calendar
[7:11] the regular time of God's calendar is
[7:14] exactly 30 days in a month the rolling
[7:17] calendar what makes it up the regular
[7:19] calendar is 30 days in a month now if
[7:22] you want to take 30 days and add three
[7:23] and a half years to it and see 30 days
[7:25] and you what you got
[7:27] 1,3 23 score days 1,23 score days 60
[7:32] days exactly three and one half years
[7:36] now you see there's no mistake to that
[7:38] there it is just fits together like a a
[7:40] dove tail coming together no two
[7:43] prophets preach for three and a half
[7:47] years to the Jews in that is called out
[7:51] the
[7:52] 144,000 and then notice these two
[7:55] prophets are exactly Moses and Elijah
[8:00] amen now look look they look at their
[8:04] Ministry now watch what these prophets
[8:06] do they have power to Smite the Earth
[8:09] with a plague as of as they will who did
[8:12] it Moses amen they have power to shut
[8:15] the heavens and it rain not the day of
[8:17] their Ministry who closed the heavens
[8:18] for three and a half
[8:20] years there they are that's them see
[8:23] it's see the man when he dies he doesn't
[8:26] change his status he doesn't change his
[8:28] makeup see look when when before uh when
[8:34] Saul had backslid and there was no
[8:36] prophets in the land he couldn't
[8:38] understand what to do what to do he up
[8:40] against it he's going to battle he went
[8:41] to the witch of Endor now this a blood
[8:43] of bulls and goats she could do this and
[8:46] she called up the spirit of Samuel and
[8:49] when Samuel come up there he
[8:52] stood and his Prophet Ro not only that
[8:55] but he's still a prophet Hallelujah said

[42:22] expecting to hear from Heaven this
[42:24] morning so we'd pray that you'd anoint
[42:27] brother Israel as you always have done
[42:29] and that you would anoint our ears to
[42:31] hear the very word of God from Heaven
[42:33] Lord Jesus not something political
[42:36] or light but we know it's a very serious
[42:40] a late hour and so we just gather in
[42:42] your name to hear from heaven and point
[42:44] us the true Direction Lord to the North

[54:21] may each one receive their portion today
[54:24] we ask it father in Jesus name amen amen
[54:29] Lord bless each of you we're so happy to

[54:33] this morning welcome you to the house of
[54:35] the Lord God bless each of you visitors
[54:38] and Friends Lord bless you richly amen
[54:41] we like to go right into the word today
[54:45] and
[54:49] um and turn in our
[54:52] Bibles very familiar portion of
[54:54] scripture and acts
[54:56] chapter 1 and also St John chapter
[55:01] 7 just a little message that was born
[55:04] out of a question I had on my
[55:06] heart as we try to grow in the
[55:09] Lord and many times the Lord will put
[55:13] questions on your mind and questions out
[55:16] of the word and I trust that this will
[55:19] be a blessing to you today
[55:22] amen now in the scriptures Acts chapter
[55:25] 1
[55:27] verses number four through 8 and the
[55:30] Bible
[55:32] says and being assembled
[55:35] together with them commanded them that
[55:38] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[55:41] but wait for the promise of the Father
[55:44] which saith he ye have heard of me for
[55:49] John truly baptized with water but ye
[55:52] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[55:54] not many days hence
[55:57] and when they therefore were come
[55:58] together they asked of him saying Lord
[56:02] will thou at this time restore again the
[56:06] kingdom to Israel and he said unto them
[56:10] it is not for you to know the time or
[56:12] the seasons which the father hath put in
[56:15] his own
[56:18] power but ye shall receive power after
[56:22] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[56:25] and ye shall be Witnesses unto me in
[56:28] both Jerusalem and in Judea and in
[56:33] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[56:36] the earth amen just take note that they
[56:40] were asking
[56:42] for um when these things would come to
[56:45] pass when would the kingdom come into
[56:48] its power they were looking for
[56:51] something St John chapter 7 we like to
[56:55] take a portion of the word
[57:08] there TR everybody is doing fine
[57:12] amen St John 7 and
[57:16] verse number
[57:18] 33 so our lord Jesus speaking again it
[57:22] says then said Jesus unto them yet a
[57:24] little while and my with you and then I
[57:27] go unto him that sent me ye shall seek
[57:31] me and shall not find me where I am
[57:35] thither you cannot come then said the
[57:37] Jews among themselves wheither will he
[57:40] go that we shall not find him will he go
[57:44] into the disperse among the Gentiles and
[57:46] teach the Gentiles what manner of saying
[57:49] is this that he said ye shall seek me
[57:53] and shall not find me and where I am am
[57:56] thither you cannot come in the last day
[58:00] that great day of the feast Jesus stood
[58:03] and cried saying if any man thirst let
[58:07] him come unto me and drink he that
[58:10] believeth on me as the scripture has
[58:12] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[58:16] of Living Water but this spake he of the
[58:20] spirit which they that believe on him
[58:23] should receive for the the Holy Ghost
[58:26] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[58:30] not yet
[58:32] glorified many of the people therefore
[58:34] when they heard this saying said of a
[58:38] truth this is the prophet others said
[58:43] this is the Christ but some said shall
[58:46] Christ come out of
[58:48] Galilee hath not the scripture said that
[58:51] Christ cometh of the seat of David and
[58:53] out of the town of Bethlehem where David
[58:56] was so there was a division among the
[59:00] people because of him amen and there's
[59:03] still a division today but our title of
[59:06] our message this morning is how to
[59:09] receive more power how do we receive
[59:13] more power let's pray Lord Jesus we ask
[59:16] your blessings upon the word that we'll
[59:18] bring today help us Lord to move out of
[59:22] the way say what you want us to say
[59:25] today let us hear what you want us to
[59:28] hear as our prayer we commit each Soul
[59:31] each one the youngest one to the oldest
[59:34] one into your hands today and we thank
[59:37] you in Jesus name amen God bless you you
[59:40] may be
[59:42] seated now this is
[59:44] um it's a simple question it's a valid
[59:48] question and I think every believer here
[59:51] every True
[59:53] Believer wants more of the power of God
[59:57] every true Christian you need that you
[1:00:01] need the power of God in your life you
[1:00:04] needed to overcome the devil and you and
[1:00:07] there is more of it to be had amen and
[1:00:10] it's like you know you're walking
[1:00:12] through life you have a journey that
[1:00:14] you're going through and in your life
[1:00:17] there's all these
[1:00:19] Crossroads of Junctions where the Lord
[1:00:23] is giving you more knowledge more wisdom
[1:00:27] and hopefully more power this is I'll
[1:00:31] call them the power Junctions that these
[1:00:34] are Crossroads that a man would come to
[1:00:37] First Kings
[1:00:39] 19 um The Prophet Elijah is told to go
[1:00:42] anoint Hazel juu and Elisha and Elisha
[1:00:47] is out in the field um plowing his
[1:00:50] family's oxen a piece of portion his
[1:00:53] inheritance and Elijah simply comes by
[1:00:56] him and cast his mantle upon him and
[1:01:00] this touching of the mantle somehow
[1:01:03] changes this man's life Elisha now
[1:01:08] goes and kills all he slays all of the
[1:01:12] oxen I mean he didn't put them for sale
[1:01:15] he didn't try to get money out of them
[1:01:17] he made a decision right there right
[1:01:20] there something happened to this young
[1:01:22] man's life to cause him to go slay his
[1:01:25] his family oxen and go follow a man do
[1:01:30] we don't know where you're exactly going
[1:01:33] and um what the purpose is but the Lord
[1:01:37] told Elijah to go anoint him and then
[1:01:41] annointing him he just simply takes that
[1:01:45] mantle and it touches him this is a game
[1:01:48] Cher for Elisha obviously we see him
[1:01:52] later following Elijah in second Kings
[1:01:55] chapter 2 veres
[1:01:58] 7-10 the Lord is now done working with
[1:02:02] Elijah and he's going to call him off
[1:02:04] the scene and this little buddy this
[1:02:07] little Minister this little second
[1:02:09] fiddle this guy that's always under the
[1:02:13] coattail of Elijah is asked a question
[1:02:16] it's a beautiful question that was asked
[1:02:18] him this is not a question that's asked
[1:02:21] many times maybe this was the only time
[1:02:24] it was asked him
[1:02:26] what a wonderful opportunity for a
[1:02:29] question like this to be asked this
[1:02:32] would be this would be in the fairy
[1:02:34] tales this would be you finding a genie
[1:02:37] in the bottle yes sir in the fairy tales
[1:02:40] you got three wishes from this great
[1:02:43] Genie and he's going to change and he's
[1:02:45] gonna offer that you're gonna think real
[1:02:47] good and real hard aren't you you gonna
[1:02:49] think like what should I ask for at this
[1:02:52] moment well this Prophet asked him that
[1:02:55] question what will I do for you today
[1:02:58] and
[1:02:59] Elisha asked him he saysi want a double
[1:03:02] portion of your
[1:03:04] spirit I don't want I I got something
[1:03:07] already because you touched me and I'm
[1:03:09] following you but now I want a double
[1:03:12] portion of your
[1:03:14] spirit the danger with many Believers
[1:03:17] and many Christians they stop asking for
[1:03:21] this portion of the Holy Spirit what
[1:03:24] does the bible saying Acts chapter one
[1:03:26] we just read there um when the Holy
[1:03:29] Ghost has come you will what you shall
[1:03:32] receive power that is not a one-time
[1:03:36] event when the Holy Ghost come whenever
[1:03:39] it comes you shall receive power can we
[1:03:43] say it like this when the Holy Ghost
[1:03:45] come you shall receive more power no
[1:03:50] matter first stage second stage third
[1:03:53] stage old man young man when the Holy
[1:03:56] Ghost comes upon you you shall receive
[1:04:00] power now the power of God we can you
[1:04:05] know we can misunderstand it many times
[1:04:08] because the way it's dispersed out and
[1:04:11] the way it's manifested many times it
[1:04:14] could throw us off and sometimes we
[1:04:16] think power is signs wonders and
[1:04:21] miracles and it is the scriptures say
[1:04:24] that you know when Jesus did Great and
[1:04:27] Mighty Miracles like the the little boy
[1:04:30] that was possessed with the demon and
[1:04:32] Jesus spoke the word and he went into
[1:04:35] this epilepsy fit and then the Lord
[1:04:37] delivered him they thought man what
[1:04:40] Mighty power this Prophet has to deliver
[1:04:44] him but it goes a little bit deeper than
[1:04:48] just the signs wonders and miracles okay
[1:04:51] and I'll read from you for you as I'm
[1:04:53] getting ahead of myself but I have to do
[1:04:55] this or I won't get to it in the message
[1:04:59] calling Jesus on the
[1:05:01] scene and this is
[1:05:04] 1964 now remember brother Van's Ministry
[1:05:07] consisted of the first second and third
[1:05:10] pool which we are benefactors of today
[1:05:14] amen and let me stop by saying this you
[1:05:17] know it was brother brandom's third pool
[1:05:20] and we thank God that we can we can
[1:05:22] touch into it as well this is why we
[1:05:25] preach
[1:05:26] and and a lot of times we say the same
[1:05:29] things we say different things but we
[1:05:32] mean the same as I was talking with one
[1:05:34] of our Fine Brothers here last night
[1:05:36] about the different churches that
[1:05:39] believe that brother brandom is gone now
[1:05:42] so the message is now the ministry is
[1:05:44] for the bride is for uh the pastors
[1:05:48] today because brother brandham is gone
[1:05:51] while they'll proceed to quote from
[1:05:54] Brother brandham
[1:05:55] so brother brandom is gone he's not here
[1:05:58] but you're reading
[1:06:00] quotations from the man you said is gone
[1:06:03] so how is he gone that's
[1:06:05] right so if he's gone then let him be
[1:06:07] gone and go forward in your third pool
[1:06:11] second pool in your first pool but many
[1:06:13] times we were saying the same thing and
[1:06:15] I I do know that we are benefactors of
[1:06:19] the third pool and we we can't preach
[1:06:22] the message that we have today because
[1:06:24] it was given to us in that fashion but
[1:06:28] it came in stages and that first pool
[1:06:31] signs wonders and miracles second pull
[1:06:35] the sign in the hand which caused a lot
[1:06:37] of uh
[1:06:38] impersonations and then the third pool
[1:06:41] the opening of the word and even greater
[1:06:43] manifestation but look at what brother
[1:06:45] random says here in
[1:06:47] 1964 calling Jesus on the scene he says
[1:06:51] this here he's reminiscing about the
[1:06:53] ministry from before he says paragraph
[1:06:56] 46 and that's what it takes to have a
[1:06:59] Revival it's everybody under the heat of
[1:07:02] the Holy Spirit that's brought down the
[1:07:04] powers of God and a Revival moving then
[1:07:08] there's the prayer meetings going day
[1:07:11] and night every minute everywhere why
[1:07:14] the people wouldn't even leave the
[1:07:16] grounds I remember in Jonesboro Arkansas
[1:07:19] when I first started about my third
[1:07:22] meeting St Louis and then Corning and
[1:07:25] then then down to Jonesboro the paper
[1:07:27] stated
[1:07:28] 28,000 people in the meeting for 20 or
[1:07:33] 30 miles from the city where the tent
[1:07:37] set up you couldn't get a farmhouse to
[1:07:39] stay in the little city of Jonesboro and
[1:07:43] people come from Miles packing lanterns
[1:07:47] walking through the jungles a bus come
[1:07:51] and set out in the wilderness I sat out
[1:07:53] in the wilderness one evening praying
[1:07:55] before the service started and I seen
[1:07:58] young ladies coming with their shoes and
[1:08:00] stockings under their
[1:08:02] arms then before then they get down
[1:08:06] there stop and brush off the dust from
[1:08:08] their feet put on their stockings and
[1:08:10] shoes and go into the meeting I seen
[1:08:14] them lay their sick children under an
[1:08:17] old Cotton trucks and stay there day and
[1:08:21] night hold papers and canvas over them
[1:08:25] while it was raining storm of blowing
[1:08:28] not leave their place waiting just to
[1:08:31] get inside the building there is where
[1:08:34] the blind was seen the deaf was hearing
[1:08:38] and the ministry tonight is a 100 miles
[1:08:43] beyond that but the Revival fires have
[1:08:46] died down see the people walk up there
[1:08:51] and just just point your finger and say
[1:08:54] well do you believe brother that's all
[1:08:57] he was out and gone that's all that had
[1:08:59] to be done they believed the Revival was
[1:09:04] moving so here brother random is
[1:09:07] highlighting the signs wonders and
[1:09:12] miracles of that was happening to the
[1:09:15] Physical Realm the body but now he
[1:09:18] brings in the word later on in his
[1:09:21] ministry and he's saying that the word
[1:09:24] here 196 before was a 100 miles
[1:09:29] beyond all of those signs wonders and
[1:09:32] miracles so we love the signs the
[1:09:34] Wonders and miracles but um that is just
[1:09:39] a portion that was a portion of one
[1:09:43] phase of power to take you to the next
[1:09:47] level of power and let me say this to
[1:09:49] you Saints here today if you're a
[1:09:51] Believer or Christian ever who you may
[1:09:54] be newcomer Oldtimer we all should be on
[1:09:58] our next phase or our next level of
[1:10:03] power God should be or we should be
[1:10:06] expecting God to pour out another
[1:10:10] portion of his power in our lives in our
[1:10:14] experience down in our souls we should
[1:10:17] be looking for that and it's dangerous
[1:10:20] when we don't we lose that so these
[1:10:22] disciples now they walk withes Jesus and
[1:10:26] the Lord is now telling them that um
[1:10:30] that that um come and drink drink of
[1:10:34] this Fountain and I will give you Waters
[1:10:38] flowing from your
[1:10:41] belly rivers of Living Water he's
[1:10:44] talking about them he says from your
[1:10:46] belly will flow rivers of Living Water
[1:10:49] and this is what he was talking about he
[1:10:52] was speaking about the oncoming of the
[1:10:54] Holy Spirit that was to come so they had
[1:10:57] something to look forward to amen and
[1:11:00] Acts says and when you shall receive
[1:11:03] power the and and and when and when the
[1:11:08] Holy Ghost has come you shall receive
[1:11:11] power to be Witnesses now one of the
[1:11:14] nice things that this um message has
[1:11:19] done for us particularly those of us who
[1:11:22] handle it who study it very seriously
[1:11:25] who look into it we never stop looking
[1:11:28] we never stop searching we're always
[1:11:31] looking at details it's in the DNA of a
[1:11:34] man even a carnal man not even a
[1:11:37] spiritual man the scientists have not
[1:11:40] stopped in their great achievements that
[1:11:43] they have achieved they're continuing on
[1:11:46] they're studying right now somebody's in
[1:11:49] their lab someone's in their workshop
[1:11:52] someone's working on a project for this
[1:11:54] disease or this equation or this they're
[1:11:57] always advancing because it's it proves
[1:12:00] to you and I that a man has a soul this
[1:12:04] what makes us different from the Animal
[1:12:08] Kingdom and if you don't have a desire
[1:12:10] in your heart to understand the moving
[1:12:13] of the spirit what the second and the
[1:12:16] third pool is it's just like a monkey or
[1:12:19] an animal because they don't care either
[1:12:22] and many Christians that come to the
[1:12:24] household of faith and all these tapes
[1:12:27] have been stored up and he preached a
[1:12:29] series on the church ages a series on
[1:12:31] the Seven Seals but we can't pick it up
[1:12:34] because we don't have time or we're not
[1:12:37] interested that's how the animals think
[1:12:39] that's what a monkey thinks like but a
[1:12:42] man of God a child of God is gonna pick
[1:12:46] that Bible up and begin to open it and
[1:12:49] look into the counsel of Life The Word
[1:12:53] of Life and try to
[1:12:56] find more of the blessings of God that
[1:12:59] pertains for his life this is the True
[1:13:02] Church of the Living God we don't stop
[1:13:04] searching we don't stop
[1:13:07] seeking brother brandom tells us in the
[1:13:11] message see I'll get to it quickly but
[1:13:14] in St John chapter 3:16 he reads that
[1:13:17] scripture and he says this in the
[1:13:21] message
[1:13:24] um love
[1:13:27] 1957 and he quotes it for God so loved
[1:13:29] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:13:31] son that whosoever believeth in him
[1:13:33] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:13:36] life you say brother Brandon would you
[1:13:39] read such a little text for a great
[1:13:41] service you see doesn't make much
[1:13:44] difference how small it is it's what it
[1:13:47] says it's the contents in it the context
[1:13:52] what makes it so valuable that is is
[1:13:55] enough scripture to convert the entire
[1:13:57] world to God and to Christ tonight if it
[1:14:01] be received in the right mental attitude
[1:14:04] it would do it it would bring every
[1:14:07] sinner to his knees and the reason I
[1:14:10] chose this tonight is because my theme
[1:14:13] has always been love I think love is the
[1:14:18] most powerful force that the world has
[1:14:23] because God is love and there's no more
[1:14:26] power more powerful force than God and
[1:14:31] love is one of the greatest things that
[1:14:33] I could speak of so nice little insight
[1:14:37] there right so we know that love is the
[1:14:40] greatest source of power that that the
[1:14:45] prophet brings to us that he can think
[1:14:47] of nothing greater than Love Now
[1:14:52] physically if I was to challenge each of
[1:14:54] you you to Armed wrestling contest of
[1:14:57] course we know who we
[1:14:59] win not me all right but let's say let's
[1:15:04] humor me okay let's say I am GNA win all
[1:15:07] right and I'm gonna win because I got
[1:15:10] the biggest I got 23 inch guns here all
[1:15:13] right or 24 whatever they are they're
[1:15:16] probably 13 but let's say I got 24 inch
[1:15:20] guns here know power so Joseph I bring
[1:15:23] you up here bam Brother Andy bam got him
[1:15:27] just wipe all of you Brothers
[1:15:29] out more power than anybody in here
[1:15:32] that's
[1:15:33] physically but let's say the love that a
[1:15:36] man would have for his
[1:15:38] son see that love is more powerful than
[1:15:44] any physical Force the love a woman
[1:15:47] would have for her child the love that
[1:15:50] God had for your soul there is nothing
[1:15:55] more powerful than love if you get the
[1:15:59] love right everything else will be right
[1:16:03] if your love is correct your ministry
[1:16:07] will be correct your ability to sing
[1:16:10] your study habits your giving your
[1:16:12] living your sacrifice your praying all
[1:16:16] comes in line when the love is right
[1:16:19] because it is the greatest source of
[1:16:22] power that you can think of it's love
[1:16:25] love for God so loved the world that he
[1:16:28] gave his only begotten son so love is a
[1:16:31] great source of power brother phanom
[1:16:35] goes further and he says that a man
[1:16:38] fully surrendered to
[1:16:41] God so as a man would surrender himself
[1:16:46] to God now he surrendering himself to
[1:16:51] more of God more of his
[1:16:55] power he continues it tells us that that
[1:16:59] in you is the seed of
[1:17:02] God and in that
[1:17:05] seed is every fruit every gift every
[1:17:09] ounce of power that you'll ever need is
[1:17:11] already in you this is what Jesus said
[1:17:14] he says come unto me and drink you that
[1:17:17] are thirsty drink and I will give you I
[1:17:21] will quench your thirst with rivers
[1:17:25] flowing from within you so we think of
[1:17:29] power maybe as an outside Source power
[1:17:32] coming to us another Touch of power but
[1:17:36] the power if you have the Holy Ghost is
[1:17:38] already in you now and he's just
[1:17:42] releasing more of that power as you
[1:17:45] surrender to him here what the prophet
[1:17:47] of God says here in the message the
[1:17:49] Queen of Sheba paragraph number
[1:17:52] seven then if Satan
[1:17:56] and he was referring back to Jonah and
[1:17:58] many times we like to say about Jonah of
[1:18:00] him being backsliding now I'm not
[1:18:02] holding up so much for what he did but I
[1:18:05] believe that all things work together
[1:18:07] for good to them that love
[1:18:09] God sometimes we do things that we don't
[1:18:13] understand our own
[1:18:15] doings if we are led by the spirit of
[1:18:18] God every child of God in my hearing or
[1:18:21] hearing of my voice rather knows that
[1:18:25] sometimes that you do things that you
[1:18:27] think yourself is
[1:18:29] ridiculous when you become so closed in
[1:18:33] with God when the Holy Spirit gets you
[1:18:36] in such a condition till you're fully
[1:18:40] surrender to him I've seen men so filled
[1:18:44] with the devil until it would take
[1:18:46] several men to hold them and then if
[1:18:48] Satan can put that kind of a power on a
[1:18:51] man fully surrender to him how much more
[1:18:55] power can the Holy Spirit put on a man
[1:18:58] that surrendered to him to make a person
[1:19:01] in a wheelchair rise and walk to make
[1:19:04] the shadow of a man dying with cancer on
[1:19:06] a to jump to his feet screaming under
[1:19:09] the power of God for how much stronger
[1:19:13] is God than the devil so as we surrender
[1:19:17] our life to him We're surrendering
[1:19:20] ourselves to more of this power prophet
[1:19:24] God continues here paragraph number
[1:19:28] 34 in the
[1:19:32] message show us the
[1:19:40] father now that little tree just like
[1:19:44] you after you've accepted Christ in the
[1:19:47] little baby form then we are planted
[1:19:50] together in Christ now the only thing
[1:19:54] this little tree does you just have to
[1:19:57] pour the water to it and it starts
[1:20:01] drinking and when it drinks its a lotted
[1:20:04] portion it's got to drink more than that
[1:20:08] it has to drink so much until it starts
[1:20:10] pushing out limbs then it just keeps on
[1:20:14] drinking until it pushes out leaves then
[1:20:18] it just keeps on drinking till it pushes
[1:20:20] out blossoms then it just keeps on
[1:20:23] drinking till it makes it to every
[1:20:25] service is that what it said no it
[1:20:27] didn't say that let me me back up it
[1:20:30] keeps on drinking until it pushes out
[1:20:33] oranges all the time drinking drinking
[1:20:37] drinking and when we become Born Again
[1:20:40] Servants of God the seed of God planted
[1:20:43] in our heart we just keep drinking
[1:20:46] drinking and pushing
[1:20:48] out everything you have need of in this
[1:20:52] earth journey is in you when you receive
[1:20:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the
[1:20:59] healing you ever need all the rejoicing
[1:21:02] you'll ever need all the power you ever
[1:21:06] need everything you got need of is in
[1:21:10] you when you're got Christ in you but
[1:21:13] the only thing you have to do is keep
[1:21:15] drinking drinking people don't get
[1:21:17] thirsty enough the Bible said blessed
[1:21:20] are you when you do hunger and thirst
[1:21:24] after
[1:21:25] righteousness when you're thirsty you
[1:21:28] can drink and the more you
[1:21:30] drink the more you can spread out the
[1:21:34] more grace you get the more power you
[1:21:38] have can you say
[1:21:40] Amen the more faith you
[1:21:44] have you have as you keep drinking from
[1:21:47] Christ who is the inexhaustible Fountain
[1:21:50] of Life drinking the seed form God's
[1:21:54] word is a seed God is in his word look
[1:21:58] at him when he makes his word manifest
[1:22:01] Promises of what he would do look at 120
[1:22:04] people taking God's word went up on the
[1:22:07] day of Pentecost and waited until that
[1:22:10] commission T into the city of Jerusalem
[1:22:15] until you're endued with power from on
[1:22:17] high so there's power in Waiting there's
[1:22:21] power in drinking from the spirit and
[1:22:24] what we're drinking is more of the word
[1:22:27] more of his of his goodness more of what
[1:22:30] he said about us the seed in US is
[1:22:33] growing it's already in you all the
[1:22:36] rejoicing you have need of is already in
[1:22:39] you all of the power that you have need
[1:22:42] of is already in you when you become a
[1:22:45] Christian that seed of life is in you so
[1:22:49] more power is already in you but you
[1:22:52] have to surrender yourself to him
[1:22:55] more and drink more of the inexhaustible
[1:23:01] Fountain I think maybe we get stagnant
[1:23:04] in our growth we get stagnant in our
[1:23:08] expectations of our life and our we get
[1:23:11] tired we get weary and doing the things
[1:23:14] and tasks that he's called us to because
[1:23:16] we need power and the Bible says they
[1:23:17] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:23:20] their strength they'll Mount up with
[1:23:22] wings as Eagles
[1:23:25] waiting on the Lord waiting on his
[1:23:27] promises brings more of this power into
[1:23:31] your life and every one of us need more
[1:23:35] of this
[1:23:36] power how do we get that we get that by
[1:23:38] waiting upon him taking him at his word
[1:23:43] the more grace the more
[1:23:46] power the more we surrender the more he
[1:23:50] has to give to us so it's on us to
[1:23:53] surrender more and we would receive more
[1:23:57] remember the the the the outward man the
[1:24:00] outward Junctions for the church started
[1:24:04] with Wesley and then on with Luther and
[1:24:08] then or Luther and then Wesley and then
[1:24:10] the
[1:24:11] Pentecostals and then on into the briay
[1:24:13] that we're in now it's a series of
[1:24:18] changes a series of
[1:24:21] anointings remember there's not going to
[1:24:23] be Rapture until there's a body change
[1:24:28] and the body change is in type every
[1:24:32] time we receive healing it's a touch or
[1:24:35] taste of what uh the body change is when
[1:24:39] God comes down and anoints your heart
[1:24:43] you had heart trouble and he heals you
[1:24:45] or he heals some disease that you have
[1:24:48] that's just the foraste or it's the down
[1:24:51] payment it's the earnest of what your
[1:24:53] body change will be so our next move for
[1:24:57] the church is a body change and then
[1:25:01] after the body change is the rapture
[1:25:03] we're not going in the Rapture until our
[1:25:06] bodies are changed and so this series of
[1:25:09] changes in your life receiving more of
[1:25:13] God in your life has to be a part of
[1:25:16] what the Christian church has always
[1:25:18] been been experiencing along with you
[1:25:21] you the believer
[1:25:25] and so what's the next level of power
[1:25:30] for the Christian Church what's the next
[1:25:32] level of change for you what are you
[1:25:37] expecting to happen next in your life
[1:25:40] what is the next level that God is going
[1:25:43] to anoint you with you know this this
[1:25:48] change in Elisha's life it really was a
[1:25:51] tremendous change he had the man on him
[1:25:55] and then from the mantle touching him he
[1:25:57] went over into a double portion he says
[1:26:01] I want a double portion of your spirit
[1:26:04] now Elijah didn't tell Elisha what to
[1:26:08] ask for there's that comes from you that
[1:26:12] comes from your prayer life the desires
[1:26:15] that you have that comes from you uh you
[1:26:19] developing a way to witness to people
[1:26:22] that's you sharpening your iron I can't
[1:26:25] come and tell you how to what tape to
[1:26:27] give someone or how to do that but when
[1:26:29] you have burden and you have the love in
[1:26:30] your heart it will develop a strategy
[1:26:34] that works for you on how to witness to
[1:26:37] somebody about the goodness of the Lord
[1:26:40] if you care you'll study that if you if
[1:26:44] it's a part of you you will work on that
[1:26:46] Lord how can I do this on my John go
[1:26:49] keep something in handy with me take a
[1:26:52] track with me or put a script scripture
[1:26:54] on my mind how should I how should I
[1:26:57] move how should I operate in giving
[1:26:59] someone the word this is developed when
[1:27:02] you have Love in Your Heart properly
[1:27:05] when you have the love in your heart you
[1:27:07] go down on your knees and pray for these
[1:27:10] things to take place and then through
[1:27:12] your prayer life it starts to develop
[1:27:14] little customized ways of operating you
[1:27:19] can't follow the crowd you go down on
[1:27:22] your knees and that's where you get your
[1:27:24] instructions I don't go online to hear
[1:27:26] what other brothers are preaching to
[1:27:28] find out what to preach on no I go down
[1:27:30] on my knees I listen to the Tes I read
[1:27:34] my Bible and then from on high the Lord
[1:27:37] speaks to every heart that way we're not
[1:27:40] following crowds you got to find and
[1:27:43] develop how God is going to lead you and
[1:27:46] direct you this starts with a burden
[1:27:50] starts in your prayer closet amen you go
[1:27:55] down where'd you come up with that how'
[1:27:57] you where'd you get that idea from you
[1:28:00] people that's what they do they'll come
[1:28:02] in they'll see something working oh how'
[1:28:04] you how'd you figure that out and I'll
[1:28:06] try it too no why don't you go develop
[1:28:08] your own once you get down on your knees
[1:28:10] and find out how to make your own pork
[1:28:13] chops stop asking me for a recipe you
[1:28:16] can develop that yourself just keep
[1:28:19] trying right huh am I talking to anybody
[1:28:23] here
[1:28:24] yeah I like getting other recipes from
[1:28:26] other people but have can you create
[1:28:28] something yourself that tastes good
[1:28:32] huh that's what everybody does how to
[1:28:35] change at Tire go online how to love my
[1:28:38] spouse go online how to be a better
[1:28:40] person go online how do everything's
[1:28:43] going online what about going on on your
[1:28:45] knees how did they figure it out years
[1:28:49] ago how did they let me ask you this how
[1:28:53] did they serve the Lord before we had
[1:28:56] air
[1:28:58] conditioning how did they serve the Lord
[1:29:01] before we had the Comforts that we have
[1:29:04] today they figured it out didn't they
[1:29:07] they were believers they got a
[1:29:09] revelation on their
[1:29:11] knees and this is where it always
[1:29:14] starts
[1:29:16] Lord I want to surrender more of my life
[1:29:19] to you I need to give more of myself to
[1:29:21] you I need more grace and with more
[1:29:24] Grace comes more power now brother R
[1:29:27] makes this statement here and I like
[1:29:29] this it's kind of touchy but I'm going
[1:29:31] to say it anyways he talks about the
[1:29:33] Pentecostal
[1:29:35] church and he says this
[1:29:39] here in the message hear ye him
[1:29:42] paragraph number
[1:29:51] 52 you know our Lord he meets in the
[1:29:53] real a man sometimes he meets in great
[1:29:55] groups of men sometimes he meets with
[1:29:59] few we have record of him meeting with
[1:30:02] 500 one time after his resurrection then
[1:30:05] we have where he where he met with 70
[1:30:08] and with the 12 and and even with three
[1:30:11] and then we have times where he'll meet
[1:30:14] with just one so nice that's what makes
[1:30:18] him God to me is because that he is
[1:30:23] humility
[1:30:24] I've had the privilege of doing much
[1:30:26] traveling and meeting great men when I
[1:30:29] meet men that tries to be great that's
[1:30:32] you can always class that man that there
[1:30:36] isn't very much to him great men that
[1:30:40] they try to make you think you're the
[1:30:43] great one but it's men that wants to be
[1:30:46] great if you'll just Chase it down to
[1:30:49] the bottom you find out it's a stuffed
[1:30:52] shirt
[1:30:54] now I don't mean that to be flat a group
[1:30:56] of Methodist Brethren that just received
[1:30:58] the Holy Spirit came to my church where
[1:31:00] I used to pastor and it was great man
[1:31:02] lived up in Indiana they said brother
[1:31:04] bam after we received the Holy Ghost
[1:31:06] we've been reading some books say should
[1:31:08] we wait on the Lord and seek the Lord to
[1:31:10] tell us our ministry I says don't do it
[1:31:13] at all he says well the book said I said
[1:31:16] but wait a minute brother if you ever
[1:31:19] take men that's so zealous that they
[1:31:21] want to always be doing something God
[1:31:25] couldn't trust that person what' he
[1:31:29] say did he say that paragraph 55 if you
[1:31:33] ever take men that's so zealous that
[1:31:36] they want to always be doing something I
[1:31:38] didn't have that in my notes but it's
[1:31:39] here I'm reading it God couldn't trust
[1:31:42] that person if you'll notice in the
[1:31:44] Bible the man that God used was the man
[1:31:48] was trying to get away from all of it
[1:31:51] that's the one that God used take for
[1:31:53] instance say Paul Moses and so forth
[1:31:55] trying to run from the very uh cause if
[1:31:59] a man God would give man uh give man to
[1:32:02] do a certain thing he was so zealous of
[1:32:04] it the first thing you know he'd be so
[1:32:06] swelled out but if a man doesn't want to
[1:32:08] do such maybe God can use him for a
[1:32:11] while anyhow if you just can get
[1:32:14] something out of him but men that
[1:32:16] usually wants to go and blast over the
[1:32:19] world and tear it down usually God can't
[1:32:22] trust him because he wants to do it
[1:32:24] himself he gets in his own way with it
[1:32:27] if a man don't want to go then God
[1:32:29] almost has to drive him into it that's
[1:32:31] the type of man that God usually uses in
[1:32:34] this scripture so let me
[1:32:39] read that was in the message what
[1:32:42] message was that hear ye
[1:32:47] him 0 6712 that's a good one that's not
[1:32:51] what I had here but that's really
[1:32:57] good let me read what I have here maybe
[1:33:00] you can pick it up for me sis I think
[1:33:02] it's further in that
[1:33:04] same message so that's all right as long
[1:33:08] as the organization stays with the power
[1:33:11] of God God blessed that
[1:33:14] organization that's the reason I'm
[1:33:17] Pentecostal today because I think it's
[1:33:20] got more power of God in it than any
[1:33:23] organ ganization I ever seen But when
[1:33:26] the Pentecostal power leaves the
[1:33:29] Pentecostal church I'll go with it so
[1:33:32] here here here look at what brother
[1:33:34] random is saying
[1:33:35] here he's equating the Pentecostal
[1:33:38] Church amongst all the other churches as
[1:33:41] the church that had the most power in it
[1:33:45] he said this is the reason why I went
[1:33:46] with the Pentecostal church because it
[1:33:48] had the most power in it a
[1:33:51] Pentecostal blessing Pentecostal power
[1:33:55] is in it but he says when the
[1:33:57] Pentecostal Church loses the Pentecostal
[1:34:01] power then I'mma leave with it and we
[1:34:04] can classify that with the churches
[1:34:06] today call them message churches
[1:34:07] whatever you want to call them what if
[1:34:09] we said If the message churches leave
[1:34:12] that Pentecostal power then that's not
[1:34:15] really that's not really a message
[1:34:18] Church they might call it a message
[1:34:20] church but what's what makes it what
[1:34:23] makes it the Church the true church has
[1:34:25] got the Pentecostal blessing in there
[1:34:29] and you know when you think of these the
[1:34:32] the humility it takes that the way up is
[1:34:36] actually down that more power comes as
[1:34:40] you you know uh as you stop trying to be
[1:34:43] more popular you try to be less popular
[1:34:47] and when you're becoming less popular
[1:34:49] there's more power in that and probably
[1:34:53] the great great Ministries that we're
[1:34:56] longing to see maybe they're in
[1:34:58] existence but they're so true nobody
[1:35:01] knows who they are yet maybe that's the
[1:35:04] case you know these big name that are
[1:35:07] out there their name is spread
[1:35:09] everywhere and they want to make sure
[1:35:11] they got so many people following them
[1:35:13] or liking them or are part of their
[1:35:16] Ministry they want to grow bigger and
[1:35:19] bigger and bigger and they become a
[1:35:21] stuffed shirt and you meet them in other
[1:35:24] country you meet them other places you
[1:35:26] can barely shake their hand because you
[1:35:29] don't know how important I am you don't
[1:35:31] know how big of a church I have I am
[1:35:34] Pastor so and so I'm the most important
[1:35:38] preacher in my city they have this
[1:35:40] atmosphere about them and that Spirit
[1:35:43] comes as you get you think you're
[1:35:44] getting greater and bigger and more
[1:35:47] popular that's in the eyes of men but
[1:35:50] what about the power of God the power of
[1:35:54] God lays in the dirt it's humble it
[1:35:58] don't have to be recognized it don't
[1:36:00] have to be appreciated because it ain't
[1:36:03] about him anyways it's about preaching
[1:36:07] the gospel big church little church no
[1:36:11] church they'll preach the gospel because
[1:36:16] that's a true
[1:36:18] Ministry and you probably don't know
[1:36:21] them you're not aware of them imp
[1:36:26] possibly because the Way Up Is Down can
[1:36:28] I go a little bit further
[1:36:31] yes
[1:36:33] this power when it leaves the church
[1:36:36] brother BR says I'll go with it he gives
[1:36:39] an example of Moses when he took that
[1:36:43] Spirit off of Moses and put it on 70
[1:36:46] others brother B says that it wasn't
[1:36:49] more power given it was just more
[1:36:52] Machinery now
[1:36:54] he had more
[1:36:56] Health the the power was there but it
[1:36:58] was on more people so it can be used
[1:37:02] even
[1:37:04] greater oh my
[1:37:07] now look what the prophet of God says
[1:37:09] here in the message the everpresent
[1:37:12] water from the
[1:37:15] rock paragraph 161 just up a little bit
[1:37:19] above that 160s what we need today is
[1:37:23] does not pray for more power what you
[1:37:27] got enough power to make a new
[1:37:30] Earth what you need is Faith to use that
[1:37:35] power what you need is
[1:37:38] what faith to use that power and what
[1:37:43] you need is to control that
[1:37:47] life and live such a Godly life that
[1:37:51] when you ask God anything you know
[1:37:54] we have confidence in God of that we
[1:37:56] know if we keep his Commandments he'll
[1:37:58] withhold no good thing from us if we
[1:38:01] walk with him God walking with us oh my
[1:38:05] but they have one thing to do they have
[1:38:07] but one thing to do that's stay straight
[1:38:09] on the course so as you live a life
[1:38:14] living the life is the way that you get
[1:38:18] or receive more
[1:38:20] power we want some
[1:38:24] something external many times we want to
[1:38:27] feel something or see something but
[1:38:30] really we need to live that life and to
[1:38:32] control the life that God has given
[1:38:34] us in our life we have a way that we
[1:38:38] conduct and carry
[1:38:41] ourselves and this and this current
[1:38:44] atmosphere and cl uh climate is very
[1:38:47] proud very
[1:38:49] boastful me and my Ministry and my
[1:38:54] talents and my gift and wait till they
[1:38:57] hear me preach and I'm better and I'm
[1:39:00] more and I have the best and I'm greater
[1:39:03] that it's a common human it's a common
[1:39:06] human flaw the disciples had it Lord who
[1:39:10] who's gonna be in charge when you leave
[1:39:12] Lord who's the greatest Among Us Lord
[1:39:15] can I sit on this hand or that hand when
[1:39:17] they should have been following his
[1:39:19] example he's on his way to
[1:39:21] Calvary he the Lord Lord Of Glory sought
[1:39:26] no
[1:39:27] reputation was not looking for a
[1:39:29] reputation but he made himself of no
[1:39:33] reputation and what this age has done
[1:39:35] we've made it all about our
[1:39:40] reputation
[1:39:42] me and
[1:39:44] mine you might get a good following
[1:39:46] bigger following you might be more known
[1:39:49] it might be bigger in one sense but in
[1:39:51] the eyes of God where do you stand huh
[1:39:56] where do you
[1:39:57] stand in the power of God control that
[1:40:02] life you'll live such a life you
[1:40:05] remember Moses he comes to the burning
[1:40:09] bush when that burning bush approaches
[1:40:12] him or he approached it it spoke to him
[1:40:15] and told him take off your shoes
[1:40:17] Moses where you stand in this Holy
[1:40:20] Ground what is that in your hand Moses
[1:40:23] is that's a rod now go use that rod and
[1:40:26] go tell Pharaoh in his hand he had the
[1:40:30] rod it was a time where the rod meant
[1:40:33] nothing and then it really meant
[1:40:36] something it was a power moment that
[1:40:39] Lord what's that rod in your he took
[1:40:41] that Rod is it was equivalent of the
[1:40:43] name of Jesus Christ to the
[1:40:45] believer remember the disciples lived
[1:40:49] and they served in their Ministry
[1:40:51] without having the holy ghost so Jesus
[1:40:54] prepped him and told them to wait until
[1:40:57] you receive power from on high and now
[1:41:01] we want a rod in our hand don't we want
[1:41:04] the Lord to put a rod in our hand
[1:41:06] another step or another um unction
[1:41:10] another level of the spirit another
[1:41:14] height a deeper depth a higher height in
[1:41:18] the spirit I prefer that before God than
[1:41:23] to be
[1:41:24] known through wherever wouldn't you
[1:41:27] prefer that yes wouldn't you prefer that
[1:41:30] when you got down on your knees that the
[1:41:32] Lord heard your prayer wouldn't you
[1:41:35] prefer you had the power of God when you
[1:41:38] pray things move and things
[1:41:42] happen over the Fanfare being popular
[1:41:46] it's a it's a spirit of the day it's
[1:41:48] something that we all have to put aside
[1:41:51] amen it's Pride
[1:41:54] and Satan is behind all of it so he says
[1:41:57] don't pray for more power but pray for
[1:42:02] Faith to operate that power pray for God
[1:42:05] to give you Grace to control your
[1:42:08] life that in controlling your life that
[1:42:12] will produce the power of God in your
[1:42:15] life uhhuh brother Bram says this
[1:42:19] here in the everpresent water from The
[1:42:22] Rock paragraph 162 today we got the word
[1:42:26] we follow the word we see the word
[1:42:28] working in Believers we know it it's so
[1:42:31] God working with us confirming the word
[1:42:33] with signs foll when we stay with the
[1:42:35] word the word produces the
[1:42:39] results
[1:42:43] amen oh
[1:42:46] my and the message the token I don't
[1:42:49] have it here tonight to this this
[1:42:51] morning but as I prepare to close the
[1:42:53] message the token says as we fully obey
[1:42:57] the word all the word it entitles us to
[1:43:00] the
[1:43:01] token and now this entitlement comes as
[1:43:04] we wait on the Lord and fully obey the
[1:43:08] word and so there's there's things in
[1:43:11] the making of whatever scientific
[1:43:13] achievement you take that smartphone or
[1:43:15] you take the latest model vehicle and
[1:43:18] the computer in it or the iPad or
[1:43:20] whatever technology or whatever how to
[1:43:23] grow a plant or trees or how to operate
[1:43:26] whatever you're G to do you know man
[1:43:28] doesn't stop they'll take they'll take
[1:43:32] the achievement of where we are today
[1:43:35] and he'll start looking at how he can
[1:43:37] better that how he can make that better
[1:43:41] how he can uh uh uh capitalize on it or
[1:43:45] take out some of the you know the energy
[1:43:48] wasting or this taking too much time
[1:43:51] let's cut it down a little bit let's
[1:43:54] make this more you know make it more
[1:43:56] convenient make it more powerful so when
[1:44:00] people come in and you can serve them
[1:44:02] better and that's the way a a deacon is
[1:44:05] thinking that's the way a trustee thinks
[1:44:08] that's the way a Pianist or a organ or a
[1:44:11] musician a song leader a preacher Sunday
[1:44:14] school teacher this is how they should
[1:44:16] be thinking you know this is what's
[1:44:18] working thank God for it but is there a
[1:44:21] better way to make it work better you
[1:44:24] know these pews are great but is there a
[1:44:26] better seating arrangement that's better
[1:44:29] you know the air conditioning whatever
[1:44:30] it is you should always be looking at
[1:44:32] that like humans do in a a better way to
[1:44:36] make this work how can we do it we're
[1:44:40] not laying back and saying oh it's well
[1:44:42] enough it's good enough that's the wrong
[1:44:43] attitude I'm
[1:44:45] sorry well was you know and um and uh in
[1:44:49] that it's part of us it's in us to do
[1:44:52] that and brother vam get gives this type
[1:44:54] to us in the message the
[1:44:56] countdown he brings that type he says as
[1:44:59] it's happening in the natural in science
[1:45:03] it goes together with the spiritual so
[1:45:07] you see them scientifically out there
[1:45:09] blowing your mind they got a fully
[1:45:12] electric vehicle fully elect don't rent
[1:45:15] one now but if you got one they're
[1:45:18] beautiful scientific
[1:45:20] achievement and and um there are
[1:45:23] you know it's I mean goodness you think
[1:45:26] they're gonna be rolling with that same
[1:45:29] electric vehicle in five years you think
[1:45:32] they're gonna be doing the same thing
[1:45:33] they're doing today absolutely not
[1:45:36] they're rolling out another model next
[1:45:38] year another way of doing it you know
[1:45:42] NASA said we'll do it like this we'll do
[1:45:44] it like this all these protocol then Eli
[1:45:46] mus says you know what I think I want to
[1:45:47] make my own like no you can't do that no
[1:45:50] my mom didn't say no nobody ever did you
[1:45:52] ain't thinking about what nobody talking
[1:45:54] about go into the lab and figure it out
[1:45:58] and he
[1:45:59] did he did and all the haters in the
[1:46:02] back oh he can't do it own work he said
[1:46:05] he flying on you think he's gonna stop
[1:46:08] with his
[1:46:11] achievements what about the preacher
[1:46:13] today what about the Sunday school
[1:46:15] teacher today you know I think the
[1:46:18] greatest preachers in the message are
[1:46:22] among us
[1:46:23] today and the reason why I think that is
[1:46:26] because not that we got a new word but
[1:46:28] we have access to all the word now I can
[1:46:34] read it and study it on my way between
[1:46:38] other task it's on my phone it's I can
[1:46:41] comprehend it in a much greater way and
[1:46:45] consume it in a greater
[1:46:48] way so what kind of preachers and
[1:46:50] teachers should we be that's right the
[1:46:53] brothers who did it brother Neil Haba
[1:46:55] and the brothers who paid it forward to
[1:46:58] get that technology rolling and get it
[1:47:01] going and we all benefit from it but
[1:47:05] they don't go to our church so but they
[1:47:06] still ain't Believers though you see how
[1:47:08] we are we get but you know what we
[1:47:11] benefit from it I didn't do it but
[1:47:13] somebody else did it do you think you
[1:47:15] have some critics you think there's
[1:47:18] going to be a Critic hey let's put all
[1:47:19] this in print ah we don't need to do
[1:47:22] that just leave like it is leave it like
[1:47:24] it was but you know those are people who
[1:47:26] don't have
[1:47:27] grandkids those are people who are not
[1:47:29] keeping it alive for the Next
[1:47:32] Generation so glad somebody recorded it
[1:47:36] and not only recorded it didn't stop
[1:47:38] there with just a recording they put it
[1:47:39] in print then they put it on a computer
[1:47:42] then they put it in a
[1:47:44] tablet
[1:47:46] Heen that ought to equip the believer
[1:47:49] with more access on how to handle the
[1:47:52] word of the the Lord in this day
[1:47:56] amen
[1:47:57] sure yes
[1:48:01] now couple more minutes all right sir
[1:48:04] it's not even 12 o'clock all right he
[1:48:06] says
[1:48:08] now when they fully obeyed the
[1:48:12] word they God brought them the token in
[1:48:18] the message just once more he says this
[1:48:21] here paragraph number 15 Satan has no
[1:48:24] power only as he can Bluff with it if he
[1:48:28] can Bluff you into it all right you'll
[1:48:31] have to have it but legally he has no
[1:48:35] power at all every Power he had was
[1:48:37] taken from him at Calvary that's where
[1:48:40] the price was paid he's nothing but a
[1:48:43] bluff if you want to listen to his bluff
[1:48:45] well all right but you don't have to you
[1:48:49] are free tonight he has made you free
[1:48:53] and now if something in the word can
[1:48:56] make you realize that you are free by
[1:49:01] his grace or if something realize and
[1:49:05] the word makes you understand or some
[1:49:09] Act of God that it included you it
[1:49:13] includes us all then you just accepted
[1:49:17] on those basis and you're free also so
[1:49:21] this is what study the power of studying
[1:49:24] the word is when you're studying the
[1:49:26] word you already know the story many
[1:49:29] times David Daniel the Hebrew boys so
[1:49:33] forth and so on we know those stories
[1:49:35] but when you go back and read it again
[1:49:37] you're trying let the spirit strike
[1:49:40] something to Quicken something greater
[1:49:43] in your faith it's not nothing new but
[1:49:46] is quickening something more is there
[1:49:49] something in the word that when I read
[1:49:52] this is going to strike me in a greater
[1:49:55] way in a greater measure that's why we
[1:49:58] read it read it over read it over and
[1:50:01] over again because something in the word
[1:50:04] is there for the
[1:50:05] believer there's some Act of
[1:50:09] God and the word makes you understand or
[1:50:11] some Act of God that it included you it
[1:50:14] includes us all then you just accepted
[1:50:17] on those basis we realize that we're
[1:50:21] free
[1:50:23] now the prophet of God takes this
[1:50:24] message humble
[1:50:26] thyself I wanted to get to
[1:50:28] this and so we're here now in the
[1:50:31] message humble thyself we fully wait
[1:50:35] find something in the word that can make
[1:50:36] you realize you know you think you want
[1:50:39] Power you think you need power but you
[1:50:41] don't realize what power is he says he
[1:50:44] says God can only operate as we let him
[1:50:48] operate and there's so many wonderful
[1:50:50] things that I'm saying you know people
[1:50:52] people want power and really they don't
[1:50:56] know what power
[1:50:58] is they don't really know what goes with
[1:51:02] it the Way Up Is Down always if you want
[1:51:06] Power see how humble you can get just
[1:51:10] get away from all of your worldly
[1:51:11] thinking and humble yourself before God
[1:51:14] and then you've got more power than the
[1:51:17] man that runs all over the building and
[1:51:18] makes a big loud of noise see because
[1:51:21] you have been able to conquer yourself
[1:51:25] and commit yourself to Christ to see to
[1:51:29] humble yourself before him that's really
[1:51:33] power you show me a church that's humble
[1:51:37] real humble not arrogancy a church just
[1:51:41] a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a
[1:51:45] church that has the favor and power of
[1:51:48] God in it that's right that's the thing
[1:51:51] it takes
[1:51:53] humility humbling ourselves before God
[1:51:57] letting God just work through us don't
[1:51:59] have to make a lot of noise so we see
[1:52:03] that humbleness humility there is power
[1:52:08] in that humility and trying to do God a
[1:52:12] service he says this someone someone
[1:52:15] said to me he said well now someday the
[1:52:18] Lord probably seeing visions brother B
[1:52:20] will reveal to you what these things are
[1:52:22] we can all get closer to God and have
[1:52:24] more power than we got than we get in
[1:52:26] speaking tongues and things I said it
[1:52:28] can't be that way he's talking about
[1:52:30] bringing the seals and so forth because
[1:52:32] you see I believe the word to be the
[1:52:35] truth and the Bible says whosoever
[1:52:37] should add one word or take one word
[1:52:39] from it it has to be in this word see
[1:52:44] it's the
[1:52:45] Mysteries that the people has
[1:52:48] overlooked for right there is where come
[1:52:51] my message message of serpent seed and
[1:52:54] the true belief of the security of the
[1:52:56] believer so Believers and people there
[1:53:00] are things in the word that I that you
[1:53:05] have overlooked be honest be honest with
[1:53:08] it there's some later messages 63 64 65
[1:53:13] we overlooked them and then when covid
[1:53:15] happened we started finding things
[1:53:17] didn't we and you see the foolishness
[1:53:20] happening amongst churches and then we
[1:53:22] start find more things these are
[1:53:24] messages that we heard before tape
[1:53:26] services that we've heard but then
[1:53:28] there's things that we stumble over we
[1:53:30] just you know grows through or brace
[1:53:32] through and we Overlook them but those
[1:53:35] Mysteries is where the serpent SE come
[1:53:39] out of let me read it one more time for
[1:53:40] you all right because see I believe the
[1:53:43] word to be truth paragraph 73 and the
[1:53:46] Bible says whosoever shall add one word
[1:53:49] take one word from it it has to be in
[1:53:52] this word see it's the Mysteries that
[1:53:56] the people has
[1:53:58] overlooked for right there is where come
[1:54:01] my message of serpent seed true belief
[1:54:05] of the security of the believer so you
[1:54:07] see the stuff going on today you see all
[1:54:10] the stuff going on in the different
[1:54:11] churches and different even our local
[1:54:13] assembly and church out here church
[1:54:16] across overseas wherever you see this
[1:54:19] great landscape of differences and
[1:54:22] people people and you know you know
[1:54:24] people from the outside people from the
[1:54:26] inside they're in turmo they have these
[1:54:28] websites now they have these voices and
[1:54:31] platforms and they don't have a pullit
[1:54:33] but they're online and they're getting
[1:54:35] views and your young people are watching
[1:54:37] them mind to you everybody has access to
[1:54:41] it they're watching these things take
[1:54:42] place out there and they're not even in
[1:54:44] church we're hearing preachers across
[1:54:47] other states and state lines we're
[1:54:49] listening to them we don't even live in
[1:54:51] these places we've never even been in
[1:54:53] some of these churches but we know what
[1:54:55] the pastor is preaching but see these
[1:54:57] these points that have been
[1:55:00] overlooked that it really it it's going
[1:55:03] to uh push the True Believer to go back
[1:55:07] into the word because whatever is going
[1:55:10] on today please hear me Saints whatever
[1:55:13] is going on today you got to find it in
[1:55:15] the word so if somebody wants to turn a
[1:55:18] corner or tell you we're g to change
[1:55:20] this or do this differently you got to
[1:55:23] find it in the word if it ain't in the
[1:55:25] word then just stay on course stay with
[1:55:29] the word because in the word that's
[1:55:32] where the power of God lays in there I
[1:55:36] believe with all my heart there's
[1:55:37] another outpouring of the spirit for the
[1:55:41] True Believer I believe that for me I
[1:55:44] believe that for this church some people
[1:55:46] don't believe that Brothers we're just
[1:55:48] waiting we're just waiting yeah we're
[1:55:50] waiting for what that's right we're just
[1:55:52] waiting we're just waiting in one of
[1:55:53] these days it's but brother sister the
[1:55:56] next move is a body
[1:55:58] change huh it's a body
[1:56:02] change in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:56:04] the eye this Mortal will put on
[1:56:07] immortality that's our next move think
[1:56:11] about it Church think about that the
[1:56:14] next move is a body change after the
[1:56:17] body change then it's the Rapture if
[1:56:20] you're not in the body change how you're
[1:56:22] going to be in a
[1:56:25] Rapture if your desire is not for
[1:56:27] another touch in the body change I'm not
[1:56:30] talking about the outside body I'm
[1:56:31] talking about your
[1:56:33] soul the soul yes the word anointing you
[1:56:38] in your soul bringing up your faith to a
[1:56:41] level you never had before until one day
[1:56:44] you'll be like Enoch and you'll get up
[1:56:47] out of
[1:56:50] here sure
[1:56:52] so what is the next level of power for
[1:56:57] you what's the next level of power for
[1:57:00] you my brother my sister what's the next
[1:57:03] charge what's the next anointing brother
[1:57:06] bam takes the message to countdown I'll
[1:57:08] just skim through it real quick a couple
[1:57:09] of quotes and he says that those great
[1:57:14] achievements in paragraph number
[1:57:16] 36 says the natural Man by knowledge
[1:57:20] looks backward for his achievements that
[1:57:24] science to see what God has done in a
[1:57:28] former creation they go out and pick up
[1:57:30] Claws and get pieces of rocks fossils
[1:57:33] and elements ties them together on this
[1:57:36] achievement they are taking what God has
[1:57:38] done and perverting it from its original
[1:57:41] estate and making his living quarters
[1:57:43] and so forth his economy a little bit
[1:57:47] better by what has been created that's
[1:57:50] in the natural achievement by man but
[1:57:53] God in the spiritual achievement is
[1:57:56] going forward not going backward he's
[1:57:59] going forward looking into the word and
[1:58:03] believing the promises for things that
[1:58:07] never has come yet for the spiritual
[1:58:10] Revelations to manifest the spiritual
[1:58:13] things that God has promised he sees
[1:58:16] them come to pass just as the scientist
[1:58:20] in his laboratory are working on
[1:58:21] different different things to help man
[1:58:23] taking creation the spiritual man is
[1:58:26] looking forward to something that God
[1:58:30] promised that has never yet been created
[1:58:35] the natural man looks backward the
[1:58:37] spiritual man looks forward are you
[1:58:41] looking to the third pool are you
[1:58:44] looking into the body change what are
[1:58:46] the Dynamics of a Rapture what does it

[2:03:52] 56 when a man is filled with the Holy
[2:03:56] Ghost there's something in him that's
[2:03:59] full of God's spiritual
[2:04:02] vitamin makes him praise God shout and

[2:04:10] Earthbound he is in the heavens sailing

[2:04:39] friends may I say this it has come to
[2:04:43] the age of
[2:04:46] astronaut we have moved out of the
[2:04:48] airplane airplane age we've got more
[2:04:51] power power now the astronaut age has
[2:04:54] come in what is it we've come into a
[2:04:58] spiritual age of astronaut see going
[2:05:01] above it's the same Spirit only more
[2:05:05] power only lifted higher can go higher
[2:05:09] see more believe more be more like
[2:05:12] Christ not the audible will not the
[2:05:15] horse and buggy not even the airplane
[2:05:17] but the astronut astronaut he sweeps on
[2:05:21] above of each one it's called The Eagle
[2:05:25] age in the
[2:05:27] Bible amen God calls his Prophet Eagle
[2:05:31] age we realize over in the Bible we find
[2:05:34] in Malachi 4 they were promised that in
[2:05:37] the last days now he likes His prophets
[2:05:39] to Eagles he calls himself an eagle he's
[2:05:42] a great Jehovah Eagle he is able to
[2:05:45] achieve to himself a bride he's going to
[2:05:50] in the last days be able to get a bride
[2:05:54] that with the ministry that's so exactly
[2:05:58] like a man and wife becoming one and
[2:06:01] when Jehovah gets his people like him
[2:06:04] then he lives in his people they are one
[2:06:08] to fulfill St John
[2:06:12] 1412 how did the astronaut find this how
[2:06:16] did the astronaut find this paragraph 66
[2:06:19] he figured it out on paper

[2:06:26] out the same thing that any man can sit
[2:06:30] down and read the word of God and see
[2:06:32] what's promised search the scriptures
[2:06:36] and then you think you have eternal life

[2:06:42] Earthbound Bunch they had back there in
[2:06:44] them days didn't know what he was let me
[2:06:47] say this search the
[2:06:49] message for in them it gives you the
[2:06:53] power that's supposed to be taking place
[2:06:56] today there's some unique things that
[2:06:59] God is doing I believe and wants to do
[2:07:03] if not for a group I'm believing it for
[2:07:06] myself there are things that my faith is
[2:07:08] raising up because I'm reading this in
[2:07:10] the message reading in the word of God
[2:07:12] if God is with us then where are all the
[2:07:14] Miracles if he's with us where's all
[2:07:17] those Miracles I love the tapes now
[2:07:19] where are the tapes in my life where are
[2:07:22] the tapes in my Ministry where are the
[2:07:24] effects of the tapes in my church this
[2:07:27] is a this is a scientific process this
[2:07:30] is a carnal man's process but what about
[2:07:33] a spiritual man what about a spiritual
[2:07:35] man that takes a text or takes a promise
[2:07:39] first pull second pull third pull now
[2:07:42] let's read it again let's hear it again
[2:07:45] and go back through it again what was
[2:07:47] the fir what was the second pull my
[2:07:49] goodness what was the third pull how do
[2:07:51] you right that's nothing but the truth I
[2:07:54] give you your family it's all what about
[2:07:56] that where is that
[2:07:59] at it's in the word something trying to
[2:08:02] strike it off you got to pick it up you
[2:08:05] got to read it bring it off the paper
[2:08:09] read it again The Mantel will strike you
[2:08:12] and then in your prayer life what if God
[2:08:15] ask you say brother Israel he won't ask
[2:08:17] you that says who what if God asked you
[2:08:20] what will I give you to
[2:08:22] today say Lord I want a double
[2:08:25] portion who can say that who would ask
[2:08:28] what kind of man would ask for a double
