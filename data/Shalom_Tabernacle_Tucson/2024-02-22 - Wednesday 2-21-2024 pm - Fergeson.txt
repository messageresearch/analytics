with you tonight and I I remember brother T Rasmus used to tell us about the time of the soup kitchen remember that story I don't know if some of you forgot it you remember and he said uh the people will come with bowls to receive soup you remember now and there was this lady she brought a little bitty bowl and this other lady brought a big bowl and they were in line and when they got up there they filled the lady's Bowl the little bitty bowl and then they filled this lady with a big bowl so the lady with the little bowl she said well it's not fair she said it's not right she says you give me a little bowl and you give this other one a big bowl and the people giving the soup said it's not our fault you came with a little bowl and we filled it and the other lady came with a big bowl and we filled it so tonight we trust the Lord you came with a big bowl under expect ations to receive a lot from the Lord amen praise the Lord amen and now I I'll believe in on Friday to get back home and uh lots are waiting for me a lot of stuff to do and uh so I want you all to keep me in your prayer that the Lord will be with me I had a call from my dear friend and Buddy brother attim mosaka and him and brother man which man is you don't know these brothers he's a missionary to the pygmies and what's outstanding about the pygmies is when the Catholics sent the missionaries into Africa the pygmies never responded just just a few of them and then the Baptist and the missionaries in and the pygmies never responded this state with their traditional way of worship and then the Pentecostal send their missionaries into Africa and the pygmies never responded until this message came yeah and when this message came we estimate it's close to maybe 100 75,000 Pig mes that believe this message and it is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where we probably have about 1.6 million Believers of this message there it's the biggest in the world of any country and so um as the pygmies begin because they live in the Deep dense forest and I remember meeting some of them for the first time when I was in lumo it was one of the first meetings I had in lumo and I saw this lady she was probably no bigger than about that and I thought it was a little girl and then she was carrying a baby on her back and two of them and then I saw another one like this and when I pray I realized that it was not a a little girl it was an adult she was an adult she was a woman and the little bitt people and anyway uh uh what they did is barachi he built a a hospital in the in the pygmies among the pygmies so he was calling me giving me a little report and of course the United Nations held on organization got involved in it and stuff so um they've invited me to come and I don't know I've been praying the Lord I don't think I can make it in they'd like for me to come for a convention among the pig me people back in April I can't see how I could make it I just don't think so but um I want you all to remember them in prayer and there was an in incident took place just recently you probably heard about it is that some of the radical Muslims there's a church in the eastern part of the Congo in the what we call close to the iori region which is right close up to the border with Uganda and uh it's a little bitty Village and of course message churches are scattered through all the little Villages and stuff there and the Islamic extremists attacked this Village they killed 30 people they attacked the Church of the message was a it's a small Church they killed a pastor and they killed eight members of the church they captured some of the people and among those that they captured was the pastor's wife they killed him and they kept they kidnapped rather his wife and she escaped from them and fled into the forest and that happened about three weeks ago and as of now we've had no reports of her we do not know if the Muslim extremist recaptured her we do not know if she's still alive or what I want you all to remember them in prayer they left behind eight children and so we've been trying to see what we can do if we can send some relief some help to those children um so we're trying to it's very very hard to get Communications and I've looked at the international news and to my surprise it's nowh on the international news of course there's a lot of things that even I witnessed myself in traveling to these countries as a missionary that was never reported on the news until one day the uh the um the Canadian embassy called called me in and they told me they says we know that you've been traveling to some of these countries into some of these regions they said it's very dangerous some of the places you've been traveling and so we would like for you to give us a report on where you go and what activities you're doing and of course that to me was a no no because if I give a report then you know I'm going for the gospel I'm not involved in all the political and and the all the turbulance and all what's going on there I'm just going for the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and so you know I just said the Lord you know you will be done I never gave the Canadian embassy a report on it and then they sent the biggest uh broadcasting in in Canada the CBC sent their reporters in to the church to have a personal interview with me because there's very few Canadians that were eye weaknesses of some of the stuff that took place in many of these countries and I was there I could said I was there I saw this this happened that happened and therefore I told myself look I'm not a reporter so when they came into the church I ran into the basement and hid from them I don't know Sharon remember that she was probably a little girl at the time young at the time when when this happened and then the Global Mail which is Canada's largest newspaper they wanted to publish you know story and my report and what I've done and stuff and I kind of Shun from these things you know the public city out there kind of shun it because you know we doing it all for the honor and for the glory of God Amen but what I I'm praying about which I would love to do because many if you sitting here have never already met some of what brother brandham called the rugged missionaries and these are the people that take the gospel take the message into the deepest parts of the forest and I've happened to meet some of them some of them are close friends of mine I was thinking I spoke at brother Israel here your pastor and I told him maybe we can have maybe one day a meeting and instead of having it the way he does it maybe a missionary conference and bring maybe one or two of these missionaries in that can tell you a little bit about the work what they have done because God has done a tremendous work and of course we've heard about it we heard about the tens of thousands because what's happening in North America people talking about are falling away and from the message and stuff that's unheard of in the Central African Rep countries of course there's always confusion you know and one think this and the other believe this and you know you're always have that everywhere but the numbers in the message just seems to be exploding and just growing and growing and growing in many of these countries including you know countries like Angola and Gabon and some of the countries that you probably have just heard of but um it's just been continually growing God has done a mighty work among the the people in these countries and well certainly I really I thank the Lord that in his love and mercy he used me in a little way to be able to spearhead some of the work that has been done in these countries we have tens of thousands of Believers has come of course in my little Ministry what the Lord has given me the most I've ever seen come under my Ministry is I remember about or it must have been about 15 years maybe 15 or 20 years ago I went into the uh Congo what we call Congo brazille with brother Isaac brandham and I had three services there and in the three services there were 100 there were over one th000 the brothers estimated around 1,500 converts that gave their hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ and of course I couldn't stay to baptize all these people so the local pastors baptize about 1,500 Believers imagine a church growing by 1,500 after three services three services see so it's just been amazing the things what our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has done and to him we give the honor and and the glory and don't forget you pray for them because don't limit your vision to your family or to the community that you live remember that that brother random saw the bride coming from all over the world see so it's a worldwide bride and of course I could tell you a lot that things what I've seen what the Lord has given me the privilege but tonight we're going to cut a little bit on that and get to what we want to look at with the word of the Lord but I just want you all to remember especially that family with the Muslim there was um one of the Muslim families excuse me one of our brothers he's a missionary and he left Chad and Chad is a Muslim country but there are some Muslim countries that are not we call radical Muslim countries so when I visited Chad I was really welcomed by the authorities even if they were Muslims I was treated very good by the by the people I was even amazed that I was accepted as a Christian in such a respectable way when I went to Chad the chadian authorities did all they could to welcome me when I went but of course some countries are not like that in a country like Al Algeria even Muslims are killing Muslims so just imagine they go into Villages where they don't agree at machetes and stuff and they kill one another so just imagine what they will do to ask Christians so they kidnapped some of the missionaries some brothers killed them some Christians so we had one missionary and his wife he went to Algeria and while he was there he was kidnapped by some of the M some of the the most radicals usually when they kidnap you that's the end of you if you don't sometime they ask Ransom sometime if the ransom isn't paid it's the end of you so we kept praying and praying and praying and he was kidnapped for a little over six months and then finally the Muslim radicals released him and so thank the Lord he was released and we are so grateful to God we got news that he was released by them so I want you all you know to pray for those missionaries it's been rough and some of them taking this gospel into the jungles and different places and the work that God has done and to him we give the honor and the praise amen now tonight we want to look at a different subject and I I pray that this will be a blessing to us and of course some of the the best Services I've had was with little groups of people that we've came in and the anointing came down and the Holy Spirit blessed us and such a blessing amen amen and you you heard me say that I've I mean I've preached probably some of the biggest of the largest congregations or gatherings in this message and the biggest group I've ever preached to in my life was a Congregation of about 25,000 and in a convention in Africa and that's the biggest and of course groups of 10 15,000 people and the smallest I've ever preached to was a Congregation of two in maray France towards the south of France and there was four of us there was brother F that went with me f FR p the pastor of the church and I so we were four pastors and two members two members of the congregation and the sad part of it is after I finished preaching and I left a couple of months later someone came into my say and split that chur took one of [Laughter] M certainly grateful to God Amen that you might think well we got a small [Laughter] Church what I did I I pushed my heart out and I never forgot the message I preached on the light of the day the light what is light and I preached my heart out to that little two people sitting in the congregation oh my well God bless you all amen tonight we want to speak on the assurance that God has given us the assurance that God gives us that we have eternal life okay and um I really trust that it would be a blessing to you amen um now I'll take two scriptures to be able as we go forward on this I'll take two scriptures we will all stand for a little word of prayer just to pray Father in heaven we honor you yes Lord with our prayer with our than as David said it I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord and father there's no better place that we could come to enjoy your presence and your blessings than to come into a little place like this that's been dedicated and set aside for you and know God as Israel tries you our brother our pastor here tries to point these people to you and to your message oh God may you anoint him give him the wisdom father oh god of Heaven bless this little congregation father oh God we so thank you for him for his efforts his Zeal his love for you we see Lord your spirit working his life and how happy we are for it Lord and this little congregation father to stand with him and to pray that he will multiply the work here in tucon Lord that it will be a little lighthouse for your name and for your honor and Glory we ask it in Jesus lovely name amen now we want to look at Matthew chap 4 verse 1-7 Matthew chap 4 verse 1-7 this is after Jesus was at the banks of the River Jordan and the Holy Spirit came down upon him then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was was afterwards hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God then the devil take him up up into the holy city and set him up on the Pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone and Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God this is very good because you know I used to think years ago that we have to have temptations and then I realize no we can ask God to Deliver Us from Temptations we could tell the devil Satan stop tempting me me have you ever told the devil that there's something else I'll tell you about that in a little bit okay it'll probably be a blessing to you now um I want to I want to take another scripture found in John chapter 14 let me see if I have it here no I don't have it here Al I'll get it from my here excuse me John chapter 14 and we'll read from verse 16 and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but he know know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come unto you yet a little while and the world see it me no more but he see me because I live he shall live also at that day he shall know that I'm in my father and he in me and I in you a father may it please you to bless us and bless your word we pray as we look to you in Jesus name amen God bless you all you can be seated now we will not go back on um we will not go back on the message on Sunday it's impossible for us to go back and recap it but just to mention that in God's economy the greatest thing that God can give to you is eternal life and there is nothing greater than eternal life and if we live all our lives here and we miss eternal life we have missed everything and if we've lived our life here and we gained eternal life we have gained everything and we went deep into the message on Sunday to show that there Comes A Time in your life where God gives you eternal life so the eternal life is there it is in God it is the part of God and then God gives you eternal life and when you receive eternal life you become as Eternal as God is we went to show that that eternal life comes down in your own life so I receive eternal life in my life and my life I give to him and your life you give to him and Sunday we went deep into that now tonight we're going to change direction we're not going to go much into that and then we're going to say to to to go into this God proven God giving you the proof that you have eternal life or the assurance that you have eternal life now Jesus here says as we read the scriptures here of John chapter 14 where he says at that day that's this day you shall know that I'm in my father he in me and I in you so there have to come a time in your life in your walk with the Lord that you will know that God is in you you see you've heard it with the hearing of the ear but there come a time when you will know for sure you would have that deep inner peace and that Assurance you will know all the doubts are gone you will know that God is within you now I want to stop to say this the age in which we live in brother brandom says one of the characteristics of this age in which we living is that the people is not sure deep in their hearts there's a lack of assurance and that is normal because if I try to assure myself self with an intellectual capacity is not going to work because intellectual faith is based on reasoning and intellectual and human love is based on reasoning you see that power to reason and while it's reasoning the prophet of God says that reason is like the shiting Sands of the sea so there will always be a question mark coming but the funny thing about is even Believers with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the life of God within them could still have a question mark which we will show you why in a little bit and what is the difference okay amen are you listening yes sir all right now brother Brandon told us this and so we will start with this here um just before I yes that's correct I could start with it right away amen he quotes the scripture I'm sorry here just excuse me here I want to want to be sure I don't get my notes mixed up like what brother Billy Paul says he watching when he begins to get his note mixed up brother Billy used to tease me on that so yeah all right so here it is want to share this with you think it will be a blessing to you now in the message proven his word where is that yeah should be here I'm sorry yeah that's correct in the message proven his word brother brandham says here he said you know there's a scripture in the Bible in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 where it is written prove all things yes and hold fast to that which is good when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right so even if there's a question concerning eternal life or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Seal of God it should be proven he said brother Ferguson could I prove yes God wants you to prove all things don't be afraid to prove it not he didn't say doubt it he says prove it it there's a difference between doubting it and proving it so the Bible says prove all things but bandam continues he says and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and then as you find what is right it says hold fast in other words grip it and don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not SL clip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven right so you don't grip it until it's being proven right the first thing is prove it and we are not afraid to prove it and we are to prove all things all right now we will go a little deep into this so God is telling you to prove it now brother brandham goes on and he says anything that's proven not right then turn it loose as quick as you can and get away from it don't never hold on to the wrong things now it is possible that stun Christians find people hold sometimes hold to the wrong thing thinking it is right but then these things should be proven whether they're right or wrong and it is the duty of all of us as we expecting to go to heaven when Jesus comes and it is The Minister's Duty that when any question is brought up that he soles us out and then proves it before the people that they might understand now we spoke about that the importance of understanding we will not go into that tonight that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding to the wrong thing so we have a scripture and Jesus says all scriptures must be fulfilled that we should prove all things and then hold fast or hold tight get a dead grip and don't turn it loose hold fast to that which is good so brother bham says here it is The Minister's Duty when anything is brought up that he solves this out and then proves it before the people that they might understand because no one wants to be found wrong holding to to to the wrong thing and then he goes on to say it is the duty of all of us so it's not just The Minister's Duty it is the duty of all of us to prove it and here is a thing that's happening in this age that we are living in many many many many Believers of this message and I'll talk to you kind of Heart to Heart tonight as a little family together many many Believers and even Ministers of this message will not prove the thing that's true we I'll go a little deep into it when I because you see the reason is when you prove it and you find out that this thing is wrong and you say all it is wrong people think you're against them because you disagree but if I'm wrong on something and someone tells me brother fuson you made a mistake you're wrong I'm happy to be corrected I want to be corrected I've grown by correction and people have come to me with quotes and but I don't want I don't want people's ideas you got your own idea you know I throw it to the trash I'll be honest I tell the people playing you come to me with your own idea please I mean I've traveled to many different countries and I've listened to a lot of ideas of people their opinions their doctrines their interpretation and stuff until sometimes my bhead can hardly contain it so I don't need more of that amen I need quotes I need scriptures I need what the prophet says I need what the Bible say and then my soul is satisfied see so if I'm wrong and someone could say brother Ferguson here is something or even if someone tell me brother Ferguson you said this where is the quote it don't hurt my feelings I love that I see and I believe we all do I believe Israel loves that too we've been together many times and I and I'll tell him certain things and he'd ask me sometime he would ask me for the quotes and my what a blessing it is to share the message with one another so it's very important to do it see to hold fast now if God ask you to do a certain thing he's not going to ask you to do a certain thing that he not doing himself so God will prove you and God will prove whether you have life or not don't you think that God is just going to give you life and it's all and just let you die like that he's going to prove it and what I like is this if God is proven it I want to be sure that he's proven it to me but I want to know how he does that oh man because brother Brandon makes this statement and I want to give you all a little hint tonight like I told you we'll talk to each other like heart to heart that sometimes the Holy Ghost could come and speak to you yes and you don't recognize it's God speaking to you absolutely yes sir do you want an example in the Bible H Samuel the Lord came that's right and called Samuel Samuel and Samuel thought it was Eli and he came to Eli and he said thou just call me and Eli said I didn't call you he said go back and light on Samuel went back and Li down and God came again Samuel Samuel and Samuel got up and he went to Eli Eli you did call me and Eli said I didn't do it it happened three times and then El I begin to realize well hey I didn't call him it's God he says go back and when he calls you says Speak Lord thy servant hear it and it's so important for us to be able to recognize where when God speaks to us and when God moves and how God acts because it goes over the head of many people amen God could come in the meeting here tonight in his Simplicity and speak to you and many times where does he speak to you let me show you another little quote I got the quote right here I just try to say from time if you want to you you should read it first but a first I will I got it right here but here is Elijah and we've heard about Elijah being in the the cave and we've read the story and maybe preachers has preached on it and here is Elijah he's in the cave and there was an earthquake that went from the earthquake went from the Lord and the Bible says but the Lord was not in the earthquake and there was a fire that came from the Lord the fire came from the Lord but the Lord was not in the fire that's right and then what next there was a whirlwind that passed my that was that would cause people to shout and scream and go wild and everything and the Whirlwind passed and the Bible says the Whirlwind came from the Lord these things came from the Lord but the Lord was not in it there are many things coming from the Lord but the Lord is not in it and then there was a still Small Voice I want to ask you a little question where did that still Small Voice come you know what brother br said he said that still Small Voice was the voice that spoke in the heart of Elijah Elijah heard that still small voice speaking in his heart I got the quot here and then Elijah pulled himself together and listen and the voice here said what do thou hear Elijah where was he speaking many times where does God speak to you in your heart that's still small voice but did you recognize it some people are so busy with the activities of the day they got this to do they got that to do yes they got this to do they that to do they're on the phone with this person and they on the phone with that person and they have to text this one and text that one they have no time to listen to that still small voice speaking here in their hearts one of these days we'll come back again I'll bring you more quotes on that there's some things I found what brother bam said that we will not going into tonight on that voice speaking within you but we will not go into that because it will take us far away let's come back here to what we want to say okay so God has awaited proves it yes and he will prove that life in you he will prove here's what brother brandham said of it so I can um excuse me I can read it for you in the message possessing the enemy's Gates butam said this he says here he made a difference he made a showing of what did believe and what did not believe there's always there three crowds of people that is the unbeliever the make believer and the believer but God has a way of proving who is a Believer am amen so what you know to me it's a blessing if God will prove to me amen that I am a a Believer what a blessing amen and if God could prove to you that you are a Believer what a blessing and brother bam is saying here but God because if God tell you prove all things he's going to tell you to prove to do something that he himself is not going to do so when he tell you prove all things he himself provs but many many Believers of this message just take for granted that they have it and don't go forward to do what the Bible says prove all things it's as simple as that amen amen and if preachers will take the time to prove it before they preach it we have a different thing in the world today I'm not saying all preachers doesn't do it there are preachers that Pro it before they preach it but that's what we should do we should bring it to the word and prove the thing not with a skeptical attitude not with a doubtful attitude not with an attitude to reason on the word but to see and examine what does the word say about it and it's still a duty better around him said to do it because no one want to be found holding into the wrong things I've seen people come to me with all kinds of stuff I said where is it in the Bible yeah where did Brother bam say they have no quotes they have no scriptures but yet you hold to it how can you hold to something what what is the foundation you have nothing to stand on you are saying it because you believe it you think so but the hour has come where that has to go and how could it go when you prove it yes that's right correct now we will see a little bit how you prove it and I don't know if my my problem tonight is I want to I promise myself I'm not going to keep you long like I did Sunday night and even if I can't finish I'm going to cut it and and leave all right is it all right well nobody said amen to me there let's continue here but God has a way of proving who is a believer that believer stands firm on what God says to be the truth yes then brother brandham goes on how does he prove that you're a believer what is God's method of doing it now there's a way you do it and there's a way God does it and the way you do it is different to the way God does it I'm not here no amen that's all right don't say Amen if you're not sure see that's all right I'll share it with you now because God proves and the way that God Prov proves it is by testing it we'll go and see that now so brother bam says here in the message this D shall possess NE of his enemy okay he says here you go through a test God test you like he did Abraham I'm sorry this is not the right one yeah yeah let me read this one for you he test Abraham's seed after him yeah and now the reason we don't possess the Gate of the enemy the reason that there's so much Among Us is because we are not able to stand the test let me tell you something the test of the word is right that's what brother man when he preached the message how can I overcome he told us he said overcoming means to be able to stand the test and if God give me life that life of God will stand a test and if God give you anything and then he testes what he give you whatever he give you will stand the test amen so you don't have to worry about whether you pass the test or not I'm not worrying whether I will pass the test or not if God has given me what I need I'll pass the test now here is something that all of us must understand as a Christian as Christians Paul says we are more than Overcomers right and it's true but what God does is this let's take our little brother here what's your name my brother brother brother Sean come brother sea let me give you a little example now God knows that brother Shawn has to go through certain tests certain trials okay brother Sean himself might not know what is coming ahead for him all he know is that the test is coming and what God does is this God gives ban the victory before the test comes that's what this message teaches amen he gives you the victory he gives you what is what is required to overcome before the test come so you can says I am an overcomer even before the test comes but when the test comes then you prove that you got it you prove you have the victory then the victory you have is proven thank you brother all right let's go back here to the quotes now here's what he says and now the reason we it we can't stand a test but thank God there are many of us we could stand a test because what we receive is genuine okay now I'll go a little further for you and I want to share something with you here tonight as we got a little bit deep into it brother P says here the message and I see shall possess the G of his enemy and when the test comes the testing time then the seed begins it shows which is seed and which is not regardless of what took place Abraham stood with the word the promise so the test will show what is seed and what is not now when God is going to test you there is two very very important phases of the testing there is the testing before you receive life are you following which we're going to look at and there is a testing after you receive life okay now let's go into it so we could look a little bit at it don't be afraid of the test don't let the devil hear you well I don't know what's going to happen to me I have all these step and I can hardly go through them don't let the devil cause you to confess stuff that's contrary to the word of God God knows what you're going to go to and he's already equipped you yes that's right that's why brother R says a True Believer cannot fail in fact your faith knows no failure you might know failures but not your faith that's what the prophet says so if you make a separation between you and your faith the faith that God has given me knows no defeat because faith is is the victory I could fail but not my faith you could fail brother SS but not your faith when God gives you Faith you've got Victory how could that Faith fail impossible that's what the prophet tell us now let's go on here to see the testing before you receive life and the testing after okay are you following me now um let me see then just the Lord help me tonight all right let's go quickly so we could examine it okay so God tested you before okay ah brother Brandon mentions here in the message when their eyes were open they knew him he's talking about the disciples on the road to EMAs and they were sad and broken and disappointed you know whatnot see and he said here and said are you just they said to him are you just a stranger around here and you don't know what's these things that's when Jesus was with them and he said what things just like he didn't know nothing about it see he said that just to throw them off and he did that purposely just to try and don't you know he doesn't change his nature he does the same thing just to try you to see what you will do he'll work around somewhere it'll be thrown before you and just to see what you say about it so the Holy Ghost is there trying listening to see what you say about it when you go through the trial which we will look at the trials before the you receive life and the trial after you receive life we look at it a little we look at it in a little bit see now let's say God TR to trial at you and then he watches to see what you will say about it a lot of people doesn't realize that what you say is important to God what you say is important and what you don't say is important some people say well I would say nothing that's wrong because if you don't confess me before man you see it's important for you if you have faith there's a confession so what you say and I'm telling you the honest truth the only way you wouldn't say nothing is if you're dumb right if you stricken with dumbness is the only way you're going to you're not going to say nothing I've seen people that try to hold their peace and after a while they come a time and point where they're going to have to speak and then they say whatever the Bible said from the abundance of the heart of the heart the mouth let's repeat let's repeat it from the abundance of the heart the mouth now you could see the person that is the most quiet person in the world hang around him a little bit and you would see that scripture fulfilled from the abundance of the heart the mouth don't forget don't look at conditions look at the word because whatever God said in his word he is always [Music] right so he he he puts you to it and the Holy Spirit is listening God is a good listening you know to see what you will say what are you going to say and Satan do Satan is anxious for you to say the wrong things yeah to displease the Lord he wants you to say the thing that you shouldn't say which tonight we could we could take a whole sermon and going into that just talking about saying the right thing saying the wrong thing remember was the third pister had said the right thing and brother Bram in the unveiling of God he said you must say the right things to God so I've always prayed and that's why David said in the Psalms he said let the meditation of my heart be acceptable unto the oh Lord so we want to be able to what is in our hearts and what we say we want to be able to be acceptable to the Lord and I realize this in my ways is you know as the Holy Spirit comes and he anoints me then he anoints me with the thoughts of God to say the things I should say and quits you know shuts my mouth and helps me not to say the wrong things because we attempted to say things to displease the Lord and we have to be very careful and many Christians even around this message don't realize that many things some things what they're saying is really dis dis disrespect respectful and displeasing the Lord because it's not his word amen when you speak things contr to the word of God you see what it is you see we can go deep into that but let's just pull away from it okay so he he testes you to see what you say about it your attitude yeah the way you take what you think about it he does that purposely he does it yet because that is his unchanging nature he did it at the old times now in testing you to see what you say about it What attitude you take what you do we'll go on here to see it and here's what he says here he says here uh in possessing the Gate of the enemy again after trial the purpose of Abraham the promise of Abraham was that his seed now his Royal seed also as I told you a while ago and this seed that he gave Abraham was a seal of promise and the Royal seed according to Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by the Holy Ghost after they have stood the test try to think of it but goes on he says many think to got the Holy Ghost many claim to have the Holy Ghost many can show many evidences and signs of it but still if it can't stay with this word it's not the Holy Ghost see you believe every word now here's what people Miss they say I got the Holy Ghost because I believe every word the real truth of it is you could believe every you have to believe every word before you get the Holy Ghost brother bam says you believe every word then you was sealed after the test then you sealed after the test now what is that test that you get before you get the Holy Ghost what is that test that we all go true it's different after the Holy Ghost I'll share it with you just in a little bit bit so you believe every word and you sealed after the test when we believe every promise in the word then we are sealed by the Holy Ghost to confirm the promise that's what it is see that's what Abraham the way he did it then and only then have we the right to possess the Gate of our enemy you cannot do it until first you become that seed there's another one I wanted to read for you quickly um just before uh yeah brother Bram goes on in the same message that I see your Poss to together of his enemy he says if you Abraham's seed you look at the promise of God what God Said to do about it that's said Abraham's seed we look at the promise I don't care how many Falls this way and how many Falls that way the promise remains true because see as human beings we have a tendency to wash the the track record of others he did this and she did that and she failed here and she did if he could just keep our eyes off that kind of stuff see because that's why when brother BR had div vision of the with the bride you know remember that Vision he had and he said some of them get out the line you know why they got out the line the prophet of God says they were looking at the church the Box Living Church that went before them that church that get out of line they were looking at that quit looking at people who make our kinds of failures get your eyes off of them yes sir yes sir yes keep your eyes on Jesus that's right amen because you're going to get in trouble when you do that yes you're going to lose you're going to you're going to you're going to you're going to deviate you'll get in trouble keep your eyes on him forget these people they want to deviate not forget them pray for them but keep your eyes on Jesus love them pray for them don't wish them anything but keep your eyes on the word keep keep your eyes off of the failures of man amen and if you see a failure Let It Be a stepping stone to you that you could say well he made a failure and I'm not going to do that amen that's the attitude we always want to take the attitude of scriptural now let me hurry here because we can spend a lot of time and stuff like that now brother brandom goes off here you've got to come through you've got to come through those testing CS Abraham first tested and then seal then given the promise that his SI of forest the Gate of the enemy I like that um then we want to see the SE say that test testing of course is for certain purposes that you get the test and one of the testing is to see whether you will continue to go on or not because I tell you honest truth sometimes when you go through a test it looks very very discouraging yes and that's where the devil tempts you to turn back to give up Satan says you can't make it you can't you can't you can't and that's where you're attempted so the testing is to see whether he will go on but then let's go a little deep into that testing tonight and the the quote I have for you here where bam explains a testing before the baptism of the holy spirit before you receive life is in the message here called everpresent water from the Rock and brother bam says it here now here is something that's very important for us to understand and I'll read it for you when a fellow receives Christ as his savior everything is under housed up see they come into church and they get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ and everybody is a bunch of angels yeah and the pastor is the best person he ever met ever met he is such a lovely brother and oh and they're in love with all of us yes yes and boy everything seems nice yes it does and then all of a sudden says here everything is under the house step but before this man can come into the baptism of the holy spirit this person he must first have a sanctifying process he must he must have a testing time in his life brother then you thought those lovely leaves of Fellowship because leaves represent Fellowship love Le Fellowship I'm in fellowship with brother George woo what a sweet Fellowship we've been having and then all of a sudden it looked like those lovely leaves the fellowship turned into a little cactus needle with a little SP on he said this about me I never thought brother George would act like that I never thought the I never thought that church that's the testing time see now this called is a a condition that we will look into if we have enough time when these things happen the Temptation is for bitterness to come in but here is something strange I'm going to say something to you tonight that seems very contradictory to the word of God and I hope I have enough quotes to back it up now now I know I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand if you got better if you better all right I'm going to ask you to do that I know better than that because I'm not going I'm not going to be the only one watching that hand raised others others in the church will be watching your hand raised to if you admit you have bitterness but here is something strange I want to tell you and this seems very very contradictory and if you don't say amen I don't blame you because if anybody tell me this they better back it up with quotes you can have bitterness in you and it does not stop the Holy Spirit from coming in your life now don't don't no don't don't please don't don't don't say Amen don't put your hand up to agree because I'm going to back that up with the word okay huh now now you've heard preachers tell you you got to get rid of all bitterness before you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is good and that I could say Amen to also look before I get in before I share those quiz with you let me finish this one first it's all right so I'm going to hold you in suspense over here for a little bit of bit okay now I'm going look tonight I'm going I'm going to back up this with quotes I'm going to show you what the prophet of God said about it okay sir now let's continue this W here with the pro with the testing before you get the Holy Ghost okay because the Bible said prove all things so even when I tell you that prove it say brother Ferguson prove it we want the proof we don't want to just accept it because you say it we want the proof and you have right because the word of God tells you to prove all things am yes amen is that correct some people want you to believe it because I say it no unless the one saying it there unless is God if God speaking to you amen and if God even if God speak to you I have to prove it I have a right to prove God I prove God and you have a right to do it because the Bible didn't say prove some things prove all things yes I okay I'm try to hurry okay I got told you before I have to cut this meeting because if I don't I'm going be in trouble then you're going to say every time brother person come here keeps us long so I'm going to have to cut it have to just cut it all right let's go on even if I have to leave you on hanging over here on a branch some somewhere all right are you ready now all right now brother bom continues when a fellow receives Christ as the Savior everything is in the house stuff oh brother oh I couldn't be more blessed I came it to that little church and oh boy I was blessed I was blessed I was was blessed oh brother I was blessed but before this man can come into the baptism of the holy spirit this person he must have a sanctifying process he must have a testing time in his life all of you had it amen that's right so you get the test in time you think well nobody knows what I'm going through M no one knows the Deacon doesn't know the pastor doesn't know no one knows you know what the devil tell you little darling keep it to yourself nobody knows what you're going through that's a lie that's right don't let the devil lie to you brother Bram says here all of you had it had this destined time every son that cometh to God is first courage chasten chasti and if we cannot stand chastisement then it shows we are not children of God we are bastards and not children of God the Bible says it but if we could stand a chastisement knowing that all things work together for good to them that love God then we are Sons and Daughters of God then he seals us with the Holy Spirit until the day of redemption and see that's the chastisement The Strain the thing we go through so it's a testing before the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen are you going to believe all the word are you going to be true to him are you going to continue on what's your attitude when the testing come what do you say what do you do what is your attitude and then you look to the word to see Lord what is your word you're struggling to do it you're struggling but yet you're looking to the word the word of God says this the word of God says that Lord I want to do it I want to please you I want to do what you want me to do then he seals you now when he seals you with the Holy Ghost let's deal with that point I spoke about there with the bitterness because this looks like it kind of caught your attention a little bit which is good [Laughter] amen all right I'm going to share it with you are you ready they going to proect it on the board too you're going to read the quote for yourself that's good okay I'm going to read for you a couple of quotes because there are things in your lives that only the Holy Ghost can deal with right it's not done in the sanctifying process it's done when the Holy Ghost comes in the sanctifying process is a testing and we give up from the things of the world but there were things we will always have a struggle in our lives until the Holy Spirit comes in because only his entrance could help us with those things are you following me are you beginning to understand a little bit more now you see that's why some people try to get good before they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't do that yes it's the sanctifying process where you sanctify from the things of the world and give it all to Jesus and then the Holy Ghost comes in when the Holy Ghost comes in then he there's a lot of stuff that he takes out of you okay so don't try to get out of it before the Holy Ghost comes you put in the cart before the horse now B continues Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now same thing what I'm telling you you have to heal yourself and I have to heal myself and together the Messiah Works among us because we are his people chosen Sanctified by his blood the Holy Spirit dwells in us just like that little button being the Holy Spirit when it comes in baptismal form then it just begins to spread out when we get all the roots of bitterness and evil away from us God just takes over and begins to [Music] move okay he goes on the message why he says a man was made to be a God to be a god do you know that he's in the image of God he's a Son of God he's like him he was given a domain Genesis 1: 126 domain over the whole earth that's right right he Ruled the Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God made like God had hands and feet like God he was in the image of God imagine hands and feet like God hands and feet like God oh I wish we had time to go into that but let's not you s brought F all right I'll give you a little bit remember when Moses wanted to see God that's right and God hid him in the Rock yes and he saw the back part of of God and what was it a man a man what what was it a theophany the theophany of God the theophany of God Is Like a Man Hands and foot like a man you ever thought of that yes and the woman was made in the image of the man so you could look at your hands boy I got hands like God have you thought of have you ever thought of that huh have you ever watch your hand and say like God huh come on church have what you Fe say I feet like God when saw Jesus in the midst of the golden candles he had feet he had hands come on it's true God is a spirit and the spirit form he's going know certain certain form but he's he's got to see off and he's got a you and I you can look at you Bo I got hand like God praise God Amen oh we feel good about that don't we oh my this message tells us stuff that we don't even we never even knew before all right let's go on a little bit I'm you thr out a lot of stuff tonight I'm going try to keep on this uh where was that yeah yeah yeah here what happened because he goes on here he was in the image of God what happened because he disbelieved God's word it sent him right back to shift for himself now God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out see the little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of of of doubt and bitterness healing itself to the Holy Spirit then you begin to become a Son of God a daughter of God begin to grow in the grace of God the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you so he comes in brother brandom says you've got that fi that little light comes in and it begins to gr out it takes all the roots of bitterness and doubts and everything as you yeld yourself to the spirit there's another couple ones I have and I share have probably brought them with me and I didn't bring all on that Holy Spirit as a little button coming within you and taking all the roots of bitterness and everything out of you because what happened is in the transformation of your life there were things that the sanctification process in the testing time will not do it takes the Holy Spirit stepping within you and when he comes within you then there's a transformation that particular part things that he takes out in the Holy Ghost um of course brother bam talked a lot about it in the future home if you want to read the future home he talk about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire and he said when that fire comes in it burns all the unbelief and everything can sh to God out of you but you see it is part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the baptism of the Holy Ghost has a lot in it when you talk about it it's not just one particular thing does everybody get it now am okay I'm sorry I should have had more quotes on this and I'm sorry sorry most some of the other quotes I don't have with me tonight I thought I had most of it and I said surely I have it when I checked but maybe I could get back on another time and bring out more of that to you maybe another time if the Lord ever Le me back here to be with you all okay now there's another one I have yeah thank the Lord oh my I knew there was another one and I couldn't find it here it is the uncertain song and yet the man somewhere down in him said somewhere in him if he could only let that as I Illustrated like a button when a man is saved that much of him is God that's the little light that comes in to make him quit to make him quit doing what is wrong now if you could take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing growing crowding out unbelief and you don't do it by exaltations of bodily exercise you do it by a Sanctified consecrated life that the Holy Ghost Moves In and through you so the Holy Ghost comes in and all these things he moves it out of you am it's like a that's why you know when I when I was a little boy one of the things I love to do was stand when a bulldozer was working and see how that bulldozer move all the rocks and stuff out and I always wondered why I was attracted to look at a bulldozer when it was working and then one day I was looking at the message and brother brandham said the Holy Ghost is a bulldozer when he comes in he just push all that stuff out all the little rocks and stubbles and stuff just bulldozes it and throws it to the side and boy what a blessing and I said now I understand why I like to look at the bulldozer I used to step and look at that when I was a little B kid I love to see the bulldozers and truly speaking I love to see the Holy Ghost moveing into a church as a bulldozer and bulldo everything can share it to God out of it all right let us continue just had this one but I'll try to continue on now is that all right now um I should have had more quotes on that on the little button as the Holy Ghost comes in but I think you all catch it the things that in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that he does for us which of course we are so grateful for is my enemy tonight all right now let's see now so we went under the testings before we Reed the Holy Spirit the sanctifying testing time and brother said it is in that time where a lot of people fall away when they hit that testing time the testing time is something that they have to understand that God brings upon them God lets them go through it and that's you have brother said it's where a lot of people fall off a lot of people quit and they go back during that sanctifying testing time see now um we could talk a lot about it but we try our best not to now now he's going to give you you a test now this is a test that God gives you there's a test that God gives you and there's a test that you apply yourself so you prove all things you prove all things and God proves all things you all understand God proves All Things by giving you the test but you do not prove All Things by giving a test the prophet of God want us he said do not test your fate don't do it God will do it for you the devil will do it for you you don't need to test your faith and how do you test your Fai how do you test your faith that Faith you got more he goes through all kind of trial God tests it he will try your faith Satan testes it Satan will try your faith and then you test your own faith why don't do it but you quiet on me tonight you know you test your Fai brother mam says when you ask yourself a question do I have enough Faith he said you're tested your faith don't do it always believe you have enough Faith yes amen take the positive amen God has given me Faith I have enough Faith but do I have enough faith I'm praying and asking God but I'm not sure I have enough Faith you're testing your faith the prophet said don't do it amen don't do it t in your faith now let's go on because we we deviating so much on all these little points that we could spend all night on but let's get back here to where we should be all right now let's look at the testing after you receive the Holy Ghost okay now we will take a scripture on it and the scripture we take is our lord Jesus and brother brandham talked a little bit about about it let me share that with you okay are you ready now if you think you were tested before you get the Holy Ghost brother when you get it you're going to go through the [Laughter] testing so Abraham first tested and then sealed then give the promise all right now let's see what he says here all right brother bam is dealing with both of them here and he says here uh the word of God always attracts that spiritual mind because it is the mind of Christ in you that knows that that word is true so your the mind in you attracted to the word and you go through a test in time the church goes through a test in time each individual goes through a test in time before it can ever possess the Gate of the enemy okay and then you go to what brother bam calls your final testing shouldn't go into that shouldn't even mention it tonight all right each individual goes through a testing time before he can ever possess the Gate of the enemy Abraham went through it Christ went through it after Christ was filled with the Holy Spirit there at the river of Jordan he went through a test in time after Abraham was called out put into his land where he was to be a to be a pilgrim then give circumcision and God met him time after time yet he had to go through the time of testing every Seed of Abraham does the same thing Abraham and his seed so Christ went through the testing after he received the Holy Ghost now let me go a little further for you with you on that one okay are you ready amen what a poy amen are you ready amen so you go through the testing before and then you go through the testing after because when the Holy Ghost comes he's begin to do a work in you you think the Holy Ghost is going to come into you because you're perfect forget it the Holy Ghost comes within you to make you perfect Amen to fulfill the work of God in you when the Holy Ghost comes there's a lot of stuff he does in you amen but now brother bandom goes on here let me see no this is not it here where is it oh Lord help me yes here we got it I'm going to take my time and read this for you yes is it all right amen amen all right let see your possess the of his enemy and when we receive Christ as our savior then if we are sincere in that then God gives us a sign that he has received our faith in Christ by giving us the Seal of circum cision which is the Holy Ghost that's the seed of circumcision grieve not the spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption not to the next meeting but the day of your Redemption that's right Ephesians 4:30 now that's how we receive the Holy Ghost now if you say oh I'm a Believer and God has never give you the Holy Ghost yet he's never recognized it it's just confessing that you believe but when all the doubt I'm not saying you're not a Believer now in a certain portion you are a Believer but when God has found when God has found favor or you have found favor with God rather and he recognizes you to be his child and he knows your heart and sees your sincerity he knows all things that cut away from you then he sees you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proven to the world that he has accepted what faith you profess to have in him you get it now did you get it if you get it let me see your hands amen amen well I didn't see much hands let me see your hand oh that looks good everybody put up their hand all right I'll go back and read a little bit for you then he seals you into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost proven to the world that he has accepted what faith you possess to have in him get it now now immediately after that comes the Temptation every son you see he uses the same scripture every son that cometh to God must first be tried tested so he used that same that same scripture for the testing before the Holy Ghost and the testing after he goes on Jesus as soon as he received the fullness of the spirit on the river when John baptized him immediately the devil took him into the Wilderness to go through a time of of temptation but when he took the word of God and overcome the devil it is WR it is written it is written he came back out and then ready for the ministry all right but continues now there's a lot of times where where many of us Pentecostals has made a mistake and we think well the Holy Ghost is SP on on me glory to God that's all I have to do no so you just then getting getting started you it's not then it's your test and your trial now brother Bram goes on ah so after that comes the Temptation after God puts you through the test now he will try you to see what do you really what life you have in you he puts you through a test amen amen okay now could you give me a few minutes just a few minutes here tonight if I could deviate a little bit from God testing you which he testes you to see if you really believe it's a word a word test sometimes people don't realize it the devil send one of his Messengers comes up to you he says you know you know I was reading I was listening to it tape the other night and I have a hard time believing everything I heard there he says do you really think that some of this stuff that brother bam is talking about that you really think it's the truth and you stop and you just confess you have the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost we get to that in a little bit you say well you could be right you know what happened to you something is wrong and then you leave that person and that Old Devil you know I tell you this people don't realize it but Devils leave people and come on Devils I remember I went up to the big or to in Joseph once where they got that massive pipe organ one of the biggest in the world to take some people up there to see this thing and when I was leaving a devil was following me singing that song a Maria in whom you know Mary to the sound to Mary in whom salvation is sure this thing singing in my head brother Israel I could hear the thing singing in my head as I leave this place people don't realize Devils let me give you a little example again people don't realize it I remember I was working when before I went full-time in the ministry I used to pastor and work and I was working on making pants and suits in a a factory in in Montreal Shan was just a little bitty girl at the time she was little bit little baby at the time she was pretty young and so I went I went there and H there was a washroom there and the washroom was for men and women but you have like one washroom the washrooms were like this so you would go in you know and come out several washrooms here so I went in one of these washrooms and when I went in my mind in my mind I'm thinking about comic books and M Batman and Superman and Spider-Man and all of this a strong thought of that in my mind so I came out of the washroom and I said what is this my mind just almost as if my mind being tormented with Superman and Batman and and all these thing I mean I don't want to think about Superman and Batman I want to think about the Lord Jesus so there was a little guy there I came up to him I says you went into that washroom before me he said yes I says you you into comic books he said yes I said Spider-Man and Batman and Superman and and these things he said yes he said I'm a he says why are you asking me that and I couldn't tell him because that spirit that was on him for those things met me while I was in the washroom and was trying to anoint my mind well that's good and you and I have to be aware of the influences of spirits upon us that's why with the Holy Ghost in US it it sees us from that kind of an influence that we don't fall victim to devils amen now so he will test you where do you stand with this message here's this one gone this way and that one gone this way and they're friends I got a quote on that let me read it let me see if I can find it Lord help me here this is one that's so important oh Lord I am not happy with myself oh is it all right let me see if I can find that one for you oh this is nice and I should have read it Lord help me here yeah let me see oh isn't he wonderful maybe I can find this one if I don't then I'll just leave it and continue on but this is really let me see here I'm sure I heard it out oh no I didn't I'm so sorry all right this was nice but if I don't find it then we move on it's all right cuz you always say about Fus when he comes oh long winded preacher but oh my my no I don't find it yeah yeah I got it this is wor reading are you ready yes okay the trial the ttin I love this possessing enemy Gates brother bam says and proba you heard this quote already I don't know maybe some of you might be aware of it but this is nice for us to read again was only a few years later when the Trials come and the church got All Shook Up as it's so easy for a Congregation of people to do when something just don't seem to happen the way that it is supposed to be and then you hear what the people say the devil the devil the devil the devil is in the church the devil the devil the devil sometimes Satan gets blamed for stuff that God [Laughter] does and sometime God gets blame for stuff that Satan does people mix this all up all the time let's go on here it's so easy for congregational people to do when something just don't happen the way that is supposed to be God makes it that way God brings tensions into the church oh we want a little church where the pastor is just in love with everybody and everything is going smooth there's no heartaches and if tension come in the church is because the pastor and the deacons and somebody's doing wrong we want a church where everything is just so smooth the people don't realize that the most important thing that you want is a church that will guide you to eternal life and keep your eyes on this word amen not save you from trials and troubles okay anything trying to save you from trials and troubles is working against God's program you need it to prove God lets it happen amen yes sir but God deliver you don't look to the pastor look to the brother pray for me brother I'm going through the trial God will deliver you but God has a purpose in it he's working out something in your life he's working out something in my life I said Lord please take it away from me even Jesus as a human being Cried Out father if it be thy will he had to go through it amen job had to go through it what would you and I now goes on every son that cometh to God must be tried and proven and tested he let sickness strikes you he lets disease come upon you to test you and to prove you to show to the world that you're truly the Seed of Abraham he permits it by his own will he permits disasters he permits the friends to turn against you you said the devil caused me to lose my friend God let it happen for a purpose the devil can't do anything unless God let him do it amen all right he permits the friends to turn against you he permits all these things and turn the devil loose to tempt you and he'll do all but take care life he could throw you on a bed of Affliction he could turn your neighbors against you he could turn the church against you and what are you going to do what are you going to do you want me to give you my little testimony I'll give you my little testimony and if I have to cut after a little bit I'll have to I was not in the message at the time that was the word 18 years old but a call of God In My Life Church of the nazarine so the pastor was leaving one day and I was doing a lot of evangelism out on the streets and bringing people into the church and testifying to others and so the Elders of the church come to the pastor and say Pastor we've got a little brother they used to call me little brother Fergie they said we got a little brother Fergie here Among Us brother George would you would you let him take the service on Sunday morning so I said all right so the Pastor said all right you let me preach right up behind the Propet you know I told the church I said the Church of the nazarine has a powerful Outreach but what we need is an Outreach it says we need to reach out more for God and I I don't remember all what I preached but at the end of the meeting almost three quarter of the church came to the platform the people were weeping the people were praying the people were rejoicing so the pastor was supposed to take the service that night he came back and someone met him and gave him the report I came to church you know and I'm feeling good you know I just preached a wonderful message you know how you feel when you preach the wonderful message I'm so happy have my Bible in my hand and I came into the meeting I sat down you know looked around at all the people and boy I inan the clouds you know the pastor got up the the Propet looked at the congregation he said Elijah was in the cave he said the Whirlwind came he said the Lord was not in it the fire came the Lord was not in it the Earth came the Lord was not in he say in a small still small voice of course he didn't know the message to the still Small Voice was in Elijah he said a still Small Voice he said we don't need an emotional preacher to come here and tell us we need more of God he said why don't you walk out when he was preaching and when the Pastor said that the congregation the members of the congregation turn and look at me and I went from the cow and my two feet hit the Earth and when that happened to me the pastor blasted me blasted me blasted me really good and when he was finished he went he continued he said we don't need that kind of prer here at our church and as soon as he was finished preaching and the first song was sung I was the first one to hit the door and out of the door I was walking and that church was on a hill and there was steps coming down and I was going to come down the steps to go in the street and to me that was the last time I was going to put my foot in that church and as I was walking down the steps as quick as I could to get out of that church something tapped me on the shoulder like this and said to me is that a right attitude a boy spoke to me and I stopped and the steps halfway down and something tell me go back and apologize to the pastor for your attitude I walked back up the steps I went back into the church I came to the pastor I said pastor I was leaving the church tonight with a wrong attitude I says would you forgive me for it I didn't tell the pastor he was wrong when you know in your heart you're wrong don't point the finger at the other one I need to make it right the pastor look at me with he says you know I make mistakes too church that Saturday after I went to a little town and we had a house meeting and in that house meeting this they brought this woman in and she had what was called elephant foot it's the first time I saw in my life her left foot was swollen big all the way down and I prayed for that woman and the next day her feet came back normal like the other God honored my prayer now hadn't I done if I given into my own emotions and my own feelings God will not honor my prayer and when we give into our own feelings and our own emotions God will not honor our prayer we want to pleas him and even though I was not in the message back in the denominations God wanted to use me to accomplish his will and in order to use me he let me go through a hard trial yes it was hard it was humiliating but it worked out to the glory of God amen amen look so he does it to you and don't worry you go through the trial you lose friends this one say this that happened this happened you go through it this Doctrine comes up this person believe this that other one say this it's not in the word it's not in the message it's the idea some man you go through it because deep in your heart there's only one desire father I want your word I want your will I want to please you Lord and you go through it you pass those trials why because you were pred destinated to life now give me just a couple of minutes okay I'll move away from that God testing you we can go a lot into that more and the process by which he he he sanctifies you and that process when the Holy Ghost comes in to take all the bitterness as he comes in as a little bit of button and then all the bitterness moves out and brother B said he just keep spreading and spread and spreading within you as all those things come out of your life you you follow me now what is important for the Holy Ghost is a fully surrendered life not a perfect life you see there may be things in my life that's not right but I've surrendered it all to him and then he comes in and when he comes in he takes care of the rest okay I think everybody understands that tonight all right let me deal with this now now here's what God does to you brother Brandon makes a statement like this and I'm going into something hereon have enough time but God God help us okay um just one minute here I'm sorry I'm really sorry for this H but let's trust the Lord but B makes this statement when he preaches the message what is the Holy Ghost you probably already heard this quote but I'm going to read it for you again because tonight we're just going to read it as a quote we're going to see it in action now in the message what is the Holy Ghost brother bam says here upon this place we wish to approach this subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today of the what is the Holy Spirit what is it and now the reason I have taken these subjects in line like this you cannot come and receive he said it's the outstanding subject of course he said the same thing in desperation we know that there's nothing more important in the life of almighty God in us um he says you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is to and what action it brings when it comes then you know what you've got when you get it see that's just what settle it now so he he's telling us here you cannot come and receive it unless you know what it is of course we know what it is we know that what the holy spirit is and you know what results it brings and he says then you cannot know whether you got it or not unless you know what results it brings now here is something that I used to think and God changed me from thinking like that are you following amen I used to think that the evidence of the holy spirit is something you receive after you receive the Holy Ghost now I might sound I might be talking in a little bit of a funny way when I say this to you I used to think that way and then I final it's not so God gives you God lets you know the evidence of the Holy Ghost what results the Holy Ghost will bring before he gives you the Holy Ghost so that after you get the Holy Ghost you could come back and compare what you receive with what he has shown you what it will bring in you oh all right now I'll I got some quotes on it that I picked up in the message and um I will read it for for you because it's not what we think it is it's different yeah I'm going to read this for you it's taken from the message proven his word and brother brandham mentions this here that light of the Holy Ghost comes in spread and taking all the bit in the out you and stuff now proving his word here now brother BR I'm talking here about Josh Rees and the and the general went over and picked him out a man out of each tribe and they took off he took Caleb his side body because he know Caleb believed they went over into the promised land and come back with a bunch of grapes that taken two men to pack say he said now so that Israel listen to this take they went over into the promised land and come back with a bunch of grapes they taken two men to P say he said now so that Israel will have the evidence before they even get into the promise see they'll have the evidence that God said it's a good and it's filled with milk and honey it's a grand land it's a good land now all this old garlic leash leash and whatever you got here in Egypt now we are taking you to a land with milk and honey you probably never tasted either one milk or honey down there in Egypt all these years they just give you rationing butam goes on here he talks up there and then he continues he said so they got up there and now always when you come back to bring an Evidence there the enemy lays in the road so when you begin to come back with the evidence that God has given you eternal life that God has sealed you the enemy is in the road he met Jesus what did he tell Jesus if th be the Son of God turn these bread into wine if you have the Holy Ghost if you have eternal life if the enemy lies in the road that's what brother bam is telling us here now let me continue to read he said it says and now always when you come back to bring an evidence that the enemy lays in the road when some of them Fells looked over and seen those great Giants of OFA Canaan oh they said we can't do it but they they they but they brought back the evidence that the land was there they had not been falsely LED God was proving to them his word even before they entered the land so God prove his word give them the evidence even before they entered Jesus did the same he says when the Holy Ghost has come upon you this will happen and that will happen you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost come he showed the church what the Holy Ghost will bring what the evidence what will happen when it comes amen now in order that you could see it so when you get it you will know you have the evidence ahead you have the evidence the problem with this message to many Believers is the people are not taking time to go into the word to find out for themselves to see what the word says about these things which is so important to be honest with you I can't blame you because even me myself I didn't know all of this before I didn't even know that God gives you the evidence before he gives the Holy Ghost because sometimes God does a thing and then he show you what he did after but many times he show you even before what he's going to do and that makes God prophetic because he shows you before you said when he showed brother Bram yes thank God for brother Bram but I need for him to show me and you need for him to show you [Music] too now now you get it that's man says you can't unless you know the result who you going to know what you get listen listen let me just break it for you simply I'm just trying to hurry oh Lord help me I'm in trouble now I thought I was finished for the latest 9:00 list see you go to the store and you want to you want to buy some apples and you have no idea what apples is they could sell you bananas onions anything for apples because you don't know what apples is you go to to the store you have an idea what you're going to get before you buy it right you better have an idea see have you ever seen a a a a woman go to the store to shop and she doesn't know what fish is she doesn't know what onions is she she better find out before she goes imagine you going to buy a car and you don't even know what a car is you said mother fuus that's crazy apply that to the Holy Ghost and you see what we're trying to say people is confused they don't know what it is you see like my wife she take a little note you know she she take notes of what she want to buy she's to buy this she's going to buy that you know so much of this so much of that she has a little note with her many women does that we coming for the Holy Ghost we got to know what we're coming for we're coming for a blessing some people don't even know what a blessing is you're coming for a blessing you want to know what you comeing for you come to church you want to know Lord show me show me I'm here to know I want to receive it but let me know what I want to receive amen and then you hear people talking all kinds of foolish things and the foolish things what they say means nothing to you because you know somebody could come to you and show you a banana and say this is an onion you look at the person and says look that's not so because you know what an onion is when some says this is the Holy Ghost you know it's wrong because you know what the Holy Ghost is and what the results it will bring amen amen so when you come for an Evidence he said that's where the enemy L but bom goes on here he says when some of them fellows looked over and seen these great Giants of Canaan oh they says we can't do it but they brought back the evidence that the land was there they had not been falsely LED God was proven to them his word even before they entered the land I have more quotes than that but I wasn't go into that but now we know what the Holy Ghost does when he comes okay now if I'll share it with you like this when you know what the Holy Ghost does when he comes you could take what you see the Holy Ghost done in your life and compare it with the word brother Bram said the folks of Pentecost did that he said when they went to Pentecost he says on the Holy Ghost came he said they compared what they receive with the promised word and then when they saw it come together so Peter could have stood on the day of Pentecost and said what you see happening is not drunken men but this is what Joel said come to pass so brother bam says when they receive it they compared it back with the word to see what they had all right you and I we do the same Paul did that Paul met him under the road to Damascus and Paul went to Arabia and spent about three years in Arabia comparing his experience with the word of God to be sure of what he had his experience is because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is an experience but that experience must be compared with the word and you and I it is our duty before God to prove all things and it is our duty not the duty of somebody else I don't want somebody else to prove it to me I want to be able to have the proof myself and then as somebody you know you take the word of God that's why you hear the tapes you listen to the message you come to church you hear you know the truth of the word of God and then you take what you hear and compare it with your experience to make sure that both of them death tail and then you know where you stand Now quickly as I'm going to finish now because I have to stop if I have all a lot of quotes here and how you go about doing that and I won't have time I won't have time so I'm going to have to stop if you cannot let's see if God knows let's say there might be folks in the church here and um you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the life of Jesus Christ has come within you youve tried to compare it with the word of God and you just having a hard time to be able to come compare it and to really be satisfied in your heart even when you compare it then God does something else when you're in a condition like that and we have a several cases in the message of that and also in the scriptures are you following me what I'm saying huh are you following me all right let's take one of the examples that brother Brandon mentions here in the scriptures and the example we have in the Bible was Joseph in the Bible and Mary came to him and told him Joe Joseph the angel Gabriel visited me and what is conceiving me he said I'm pregnant and what is conceiving me is of the Holy Ghost brother bandam said Joseph made a mistake he never took it back to the word okay had he taken it back to the word he would found out that Mary was right but he was a sincere believer a True Believer and couldn't take it back to the word therefore God did something else for him and not only did God do it for Joseph Joseph of that time but he did it in this age which I'll share it with you so what God did he visited Joseph in a dream that needed no interpretation now we have another case of sister Shepherd brother bam said she was worried I have all the quotes here in Blasphemous names he mentioned it many many times about five or six times he said sister Shepherd was worried and for sister Shepherd she went to meet the Lord she was at the church at Hearts Springs she and the CER they were very close friends and but Israel here your pastor knows her very well and I knew and every time I'd come to Hot Springs she'd always come to hear me preach she love my Min she loved me and Lov my Ministry anyway she was having that H time she said brother BR I heard you say that it was not speaking in tongues and prophesying and all of this and she was worried and she said to the Lord if you want to Lord I don't want to to do this but let me just read it for you just a little bit then um she said to the Lord prove it to me prove to me that I have the Holy Ghost Lord that was her words to God now that's a hard thing for somebody saying and all right I'm just just read it for you just a little bsy bit here have the quote here brother said first you go to trial to see if you're going ready going to go on that was the one I was telling you and then God gives you the Holy Ghost okay that quote was here but I'm going to I'm not going to go back on that one in Blas name but random sister I was Sister in dreaming she dreamed well first she was Disturbed what's the use of going on and trying to struggle your life if God requires us to receive the Holy Ghost and we don't have it she's worried then brother Bram continues here paragraph 98 he says now a sister's dream now she was worried whether she had the holy ghost or not and she laid down across the dwall where her husband and was reading a paper and he goes on right here and then he goes on to say she was walking the floor first I'm trying to hurry before she dreamed and ringing her hands and thinking Lord have I got the Holy Ghost can you prove to me me some says that because I shouted or some say because I spoke with tongues and we believe all of that but have I really got it now here is a woman with the Holy Ghost still asking God prove it to me now such a prayer people will think would be a prayer would be an unscriptural prayer for you to go before God and said father could you prove it to me but if you really go God ansers Prince still Shepherd did it and God did the same what he did to Joseph he visited sister Shepherd where a dream that's right we have lot of examples but I need to stop I found four examples in the message of that but I need this something it's after huh okay you want me to read another one for you you hear people say and it's true if you have the Holy Ghost God gave you the Holy Ghost and you're a True Believer you could never have a doubt in your mind I agree you will never have a doubt in your mind that something happened in your life you know that God did something for you but but I'm not saying everybody in some people's case they take it back to the word and it settles in some people case they try to take it back to the word and there's still a question mark in their mind they're not doubting their experience they're wondering they're worried about it let me give you an example another one again and what God did okay oh you you holding me here I want to try to to to to finish so he takes us to Shepherd we're going to take another one her name is Sister Bruce and here's what sister Bruce told Brother brandom I got more than just sister Bruce this year is the private interview with sister Bruce but I'm talking about here and uh he's talking to Sister Bruce he says I visit you in the hospital that time and I prayed constantly God wouldn't let you die because you value to the church that's so nice yes it is I've prayed for people that God wouldn't take them because they're such a value to the church and I didn't even realize it I read this some sometimes you do things and then you come back you know you hit in those cours it's a blessing all right cuz you your value to the church now I know you I know you are going to be all right sister Bruce I believe that with all my heart see sister Bruce answering sister Bruce sister Georgia Bruce says brother Bram most of all I want the experience that I have been sealed in the Holy Ghost and if God will reveal it to your heart right yes brother bam says I believe with all my heart that you're real born again sister sister Bruce how could that Spirit just leave you but you get sick you get rary and you're a nervous type person but bam goes on to talk to Sister Bruce he says he goes on to say Satan Maybe Might present something that out of this way see then God you your nature and God works and Satan works and then when Satan tries to make you believe that you are not see you keep building this and maybe this and this see don't look at yourself sister Bruce remember brother Bram goes on then sister Bruce says this to brother brandham sister Bruce says he says I'm G I'm skipping some of it all right because we can to read a lot this is nice her discussion with brother brandom sister Bru says I have never had an experience that I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on you very quiet tonight right you might say well brother puson I'm worried because I never had something I could put my finger on to say this particular day this this this this this this right here no don't raise your hand if you're in that condition tonight some people say I had the experience I know God Did It For Me M sister Bruce is telling that to brother brandham then brother bham turns along and tell her this when he's finished let me see if I can read it for you oh Lord help me here taking too much time he's praying for her at the end of the pray he says now to the great Shepherd over all of us the Lord Jesus Christ and in his name I lay my hands upon my sister may The God Who made her and brought her to this earth may his may his spirit that sealed her away from the things of the world to be your servant made heal her sick body but AB Bram never prayed and asked God to seal her or to give her the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he knew she had it and in his price it made his spirit that sealed her away and yet she's questioning she's not doubting her experience she's wondering do I already have it could I already put my my foot on it there's another case that it again I have two more cases but I think to be fair to you all I better move away a little bit from it there was something else I wanted to share with you just before I finish up and don't be afraid to go before the Lord not in doubts of course when you begin to ask the Lord for an Evidence don't forget you want to meet Satan amen don't forget once you once you hit that word proof and evidence the devil is in that too he did it to the lutherans he did it to the Baptist the believe if we believe we got it forget it if we shout we got it if we speak in tongues we got it that devil is in the evidence you got to be careful but the truth of it is you've got the right to come before God and ask him because why why live through your life in this in this life with all kinds of doubts hindering you and boring you there has to come a time and point in your life where the doubts are settled and the only how the doubts are settled is he's got to do it and therefore you come before him and you just pray and if the doubts are settled in your heart you says praise the Lord I've come to the place because you have to come a day in your life where you know that he is in you and you're in him and he will bring you he brings you there and you could pray and ask him you see it now there is many scriptures I have other of quotes but I think other things I purposely pulled away from I got more on how you go ahead proven it but per personally I think we got to stop okay because I've taken you all along okay and I trust that this meeting tonight was a help if it was a help to you could you raise your hand give God praise it was a help to you to settle some questions in your heart and God richly richly bless you I can honestly tell you all that in the last couple of weeks months of my life I have never gone into the Realms of Revelation and things that God has shown me like in the last couple of months in my life so many things brother George used to open my eyes to see I'm so grateful to him and some of what I shared with the ministers and if I had the time back with the ministers I could have probably shared more with them on things what he has caused me to see and to believe and it's all the realities of this message and the realities of the things of the Lord and what he has done so you can you you I mean if this why live your life with all kinds of funny question mark and the devil tempting you and bothering you and you're not sure and you stumbling to the church and hoping and hoping and hoping one day that will be settled no quit that that's not the program of God for you go straight before him prove the thing amen go before him and um you know brother bam talked about what God did for him to make him know that he had the Holy Ghost how many knows what was what brother Ram said God did for him whoa nobody I'm in trouble tonight big trouble I should not have even mentioned it I thought everybody you know I you see I put away my notes I was going now try to get your pastor to come up here and meet get away from here I remember I I did this in one Church you know and I sat down and the pastor got up there and pull me right back up grab my hand and pull me right back up to the platform Contin and the congregation was there wanted you know they don't want me to leave but the Lord knows okay better bandom I promise I promise we'll try to finish here okay it's quick it's quick okay it's in question and answers and brother brandham says here uh when somebody says evil about you say something good if you can't say something good about them then don't say nothing just let it go see and then when you get to yourself pray for them okay then he says this here if there's one thing in my my life that helped me to understand that the Holy Ghost came into me down there that day has been that I was hot-headed fiery Irish on both sides and I can always never eat hardly at all my mouth was always mashed where somebody mashed it jumping up your I shouldn't jump up and you remember him when he was so mad he said he would get so mad and he try to shoot those guys now he said if there one thing that help him to know he had the Holy Ghost why is he saying this because it was the change that God did in his life because part of the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when he makes that change in you now a tell this that helped me too and I'm not comparing butam but you know I was when I was a little boy I was training into box and when I was training into box My Philosophy was this because I grew up in a tough place and I was fearless and I was in the gangs and My Philosophy was I rather go to jail than go to the hospital I says the other guy will go to the hospital but I'll go to jail and you know what that meant see so anyway that's how I was and in boxing we would box and I would said hit me in the training process and stuff hit me any part of my body but don't touch my face because when you touch my face whatever devil whatever the devil was that was in me will rear up and I remember I was went to a box with this guy I can't remember his name right now and we agreed we will not punch one another in the face all right so the bell rang bang and we went into the ring the box and and he punched me in my face I said what happened he said my hand slipped and then he punched me again in my face the second time and I said what happened you my hand slipped I said all right and then I I let loose there was no more rules no more I punched that guy until he fell in his knees he lifted his hand up to surrender and I was still punching and the referee had to drag me off of him that's how it was and it was bad my rat was so bad I can't tell you all but one of the worst things was happened is when with my daddy we were up in the tropical forest together and I teased him and tell him some stuff I shouldn't and I the problem with it is I'd given my heart to the Lord and I was a young convert already I was already a convert a Christian and you know how the devil is after that happened to me the devil said you nothing else but a hypocrite with a big H you know how the devil loves to pour it on you and that night Daddy went out and he took some drinks and he came back and he grabbed me from off of I was sleeping on the ground we didn't have any bed you had to sleep on the floor he grabbed me like this and Raised Me Up and he was about 260b and he out of my sleep trying to get to sleep out of my eye and he punched me when he punched me of course I you know but if I wasn't a boxer and was training at that time to take punches and you know i' had K Patrick and guys that were 130 and 14050 I weighed about 125 pounds and they'll punch me they'll punch me so I could take a punch when I get into the ring anyway when he punched me like this you know and then being the fact I was in the gangs and fight I tripped him and he fell on the ground and when he fell on the ground I grabbed his head and banged it against the wall and I mean I was I just lost it and when I lost it some tell me it's your dad you promised not to do that when I jumped off of him I had him Bend to the ground and I ran out of the house and that night my face was swollen when I slept in the forest and when I heard the Bible says when they hit you on One Cheek present the other cheek I said Lord I could never be a Christian present the other cheek on my present the other cheek is my I'm finishing now and one day I was at the funeral and this guy for some reason I don't know something happened and before I realized it he he slapped me across my face brother before I become a Christian you hit me in my face if it take months and years you pray for it and you know what before I realized it I turned to him and says I forgive you it was when I came into the message then I knew that something had happened in here and when it happens in you and God changes you he puts you through a trial to show you that he has changed you that you're not the same and that is one of the evidence of the Holy Spirit in your life God bless you all thank you for your patience with me tonight and God bless every one of you I love you all I expect to spend eternity with you I trust that this meeting was a blessing to you don't be afraid to go forward and prove it as you yield yourself to him you could say father in Heaven I want a proof I want the Assurance I want to know in my heart what is the use of my life as sister Shepherd was saying if I don't have it she said Lord could you prove it to me sister Bruce and then I got two more examples in the Bible in the in the message that I will not read tonight I'm not going about going to it maybe another time okay and purposely I held back some other stuff not to go into it to be able to save time but I want to say I love all of you am and God bless every one of you and when the trials come remember just sing that song victory is mine victory is mine I told Satan to get behind victory is mine you already have the victory even before the Trials Come God equips his man he equips his woman he equips his child even before he equipped Adam and Eve before the devil came Adam had to Eve had to push that aside in order to fall we don't want to push aside what he has equipped us with he's giving you what you need to stand and to have the victory tonight all right let's bow our heads Lord God what an honor for us to come together on a night like this and to share the things of God and to look deep into your word and to see the transformation that you've brought in our lives to see Lord the things that you've done for us how grateful we are and this little congregation here sitting here tonight Lord oh God how I pray that you'll continue to bless them I pray father that as we go forward together we could say out proove all things I cannot reject my brother cannot reject my sister but anything that is wrong I want to prove it if it's wrong I don't want to be guilty of holding
