[33:53] God praise
[33:56] God praise praise
[33:59] God praise
[34:03] God we don't ever want to forget our
[34:05] brothers there in Mesa and Phoenix there
[34:09] we greet the Saints there I pray the
[34:11] Lord would bless them richly and those
[34:13] that couldn't be in the service tonight
[34:15] we pray the Lord will bless you richly
[34:18] amen God bless you let's receive brother
[34:19] Josh one more time and make him feel
[34:21] welcome God bless
[34:25] you amen God bless you BL you tonight I
[34:29] love that song Amazing
[34:31] Grace it still means the same to me now
[34:34] as it did the first time I heard it by
[34:36] God's grace that's the only thing it's
[34:39] by by his
[34:40] grace tonight while we're standing we
[34:42] can turn over to um Isaiah
[34:47] 59:19 just kind of a followup what's
[34:50] been on my heart after the the message I
[34:53] preached a few Wednesdays ago getting in
[34:55] the Lamb's condition by God's grace I'd
[34:58] just like to try and say something
[35:00] encouraging tonight if we
[35:02] could and this morning what a service
[35:05] and I've heard brother Israel say tons
[35:07] of things I loved many great thoughts
[35:10] but this morning when when he brought
[35:12] that thought forth Lord let me get fat I
[35:15] said that's something I can say Amen to
[35:18] maybe physically and spiritually I like
[35:20] to eat a little bit but Isaiah 59:19
[35:28] very familiar scripture it reads so
[35:29] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[35:32] from the West and his glory from the
[35:34] rising of the sun it says when the enemy
[35:37] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[35:40] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[35:43] against him now who who lifts up that
[35:46] standard is it the pastor is it you who
[35:49] lifts up the standard is it another
[35:51] brother or a sister that's your standard
[35:53] did they lift it up for you but it says
[35:56] the spirit of the Lord Lord let's bow
[35:59] our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just
[36:02] ask that you would bless this service
[36:03] this evening Lord that your spirit would
[36:06] come down Lord that you would walk these
[36:07] aisles and father that you would that
[36:09] you would use me Lord there there's
[36:10] nothing that I could say in myself that
[36:12] I could do in myself that would be a
[36:14] help but father only through your
[36:16] inspiration can I be a help Lord Lord we
[36:19] just ask you would bless each one here
[36:21] that you would just walk by and touch
[36:23] each one father we ask this in Jesus
[36:25] Christ's name amen amen you may be
[36:29] seated so it's a spirit of the Lord here
[36:32] we see that that that is what raises up
[36:34] the standard and a lot of the times you
[36:36] know we try
[36:38] and I've seen even people that are not
[36:40] Christians that are maybe that are maybe
[36:42] wanting to be born again that are
[36:43] wanting to learn of Jesus that are
[36:45] that's wanting to hear the word what
[36:47] they get in the get in the habit of is
[36:49] they try and raise a standard their s
[36:52] they put a standard on their self and
[36:54] then they try and meet that own standard
[36:57] but the scripture here it plainly states
[36:59] that the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[37:00] up a standard against him and it's not
[37:03] our own abilities that can lift up that
[37:04] standard it's not how great a people we
[37:07] are that lifts up a standard but it's
[37:09] the grace of God as the song said in our
[37:11] life that helps lift that standard it
[37:13] has to be the spirit of God the true
[37:16] spirit of God in somebody that'll lift
[37:18] up a standard because if it's not the
[37:19] true spirit of God then it's just it's
[37:21] just works before God that there's
[37:24] nothing behind it it it's just you
[37:25] trying to work your way into heaven
[37:28] and if we can do anything to to Merit
[37:31] ourself working our way into heaven then
[37:33] why did he go to the Cross why why did
[37:35] Christ die for us it was all in vain if
[37:37] we can do one thing that merits our
[37:40] Salvation if we can do one thing not
[37:42] just our Salvation if we can do one
[37:43] thing that merits our healing if we can
[37:46] do one thing that merits just one time
[37:48] that he's delivered us if our own
[37:51] strength can do that then why did he
[37:53] have to go to Calvary why did he have to
[37:55] die on the cross and it's easy to get to
[37:58] that place where we try and we try and
[38:00] lift our own standard when we try and do
[38:02] it all oursel when we try and push and
[38:03] pull and get ourself to where we need to
[38:06] get to let's turn over to Psalm 34
[38:09] that's the second scripture tonight
[38:11] verses
[38:14] 1-8 Psalm 34
[38:20] 1-8 it says I will bless the Lord at all
[38:24] times at all times says his praise shall
[38:28] continually be in my mouth and I love it
[38:31] when the scriptures when they tell us
[38:33] exactly how often to do something when
[38:35] there's when there's no we don't have to
[38:37] interpret it we don't have to wonder how
[38:39] many times or how often but this
[38:41] scripture right here it tells us exactly
[38:43] how much the Lord wants these things
[38:45] done because if it's left up to us we
[38:48] can let things slip if expectations and
[38:51] accountability isn't there by the word
[38:53] of God we tend to let things slip we we
[38:56] we start to we start to fall back a
[38:58] little bit in our spiritual lives he
[39:00] goes on he says my soul shall make her
[39:02] boast in the Lord The Humble shall hear
[39:05] thereof and be glad he said oh magnify
[39:07] the Lord with me and let us exalt his
[39:10] name together it says I sought the Lord
[39:14] and he heard me and delivered me from
[39:17] all my fears how many of his fears it
[39:20] was all of his fears now David didn't
[39:23] say that he delivered himself from all
[39:25] his fears David didn't say that he took
[39:28] it into his own hands and did it himself
[39:30] now David was a great warrior David was
[39:33] a great man a much greater man than I am
[39:36] but David he didn't do it himself no
[39:39] matter how great of a individual he was
[39:42] he didn't put his hands on it he knew
[39:44] where his strength was at he knew where
[39:47] his courage came from he knew who fought
[39:49] his
[39:50] battles and we have to have that same
[39:52] Revelation in our lives that I don't
[39:54] fight my own battles I don't win my own
[39:57] battles but it's the Lord that stands in
[40:00] my place it's the Lord that stands in
[40:02] the gap for me it's by his grace that
[40:06] all my fears that I can be delivered
[40:08] from them he goes on he says they looked
[40:11] unto him and were lightened and their
[40:14] faces were not ashamed it says this poor
[40:18] man cried and I kind of got my
[40:20] inspiration from this from Brother John
[40:22] we were talking one time and he was
[40:23] telling me about someone that that was
[40:25] leading songs and they were talking
[40:27] talking to him about this song in
[40:28] particular singing it in front of a
[40:30] congregation and he said just when I'm
[40:32] when I'm singing I can't seem to get
[40:33] into it and he brother John told them if
[40:35] you've never been that poor man if
[40:38] you've never realized that you are that
[40:40] spiritually poor man we're not talking
[40:42] financials we're talking if you never
[40:44] realized that you were in that place and
[40:46] now you're in a different place this
[40:48] Psalm isn't going to mean as much to you
[40:50] you're not going to be able to sing it
[40:52] from your heart and it's just the same
[40:54] reading it or it's the same preaching it
[40:56] when you're reading this M if you've
[40:57] never came to the Revelation that I
[40:59] can't do it myself I couldn't have done
[41:01] it myself I couldn't have bridged that
[41:03] Gap I couldn't have made me good enough
[41:05] but by God's grace and his Mercy it came
[41:08] into my life and it changed my heart it
[41:10] turned me around it gave me a new
[41:13] heart it did something to my spirit I
[41:16] had a contrite heart I had a broken
[41:18] spirit I had a broken heart but it came
[41:20] in and it did something to me if you
[41:23] don't if we don't have that Revelation
[41:25] right there these scriptures the word in
[41:27] general not just Psalm 34 this whole
[41:29] Bible is not going to mean as much it's
[41:31] a story of redemption it's a story of
[41:34] restoration it's a story of of of our
[41:37] our Lord and savior coming down and
[41:39] grabbing
[41:47] us says this poor man cried and the Lord
[41:50] heard him and saved him out of all his
[41:52] troubles there it is again David was
[41:54] saved out of all his fears now he's
[41:56] saved out of all his
[41:57] troubles David still he didn't do
[42:00] nothing to save himself out of all his
[42:02] troubles it wasn't by his own
[42:04] strength he consulted the Lord
[42:07] beforehand and maybe we'll turn to
[42:09] another scripture here in a second after
[42:11] after this it says the angel of the Lord
[42:12] encampeth round about them that fear Him
[42:15] and deliver them oh taste and see that
[42:17] the Lord is good blessed is the man that
[42:20] trusteth in him it's it's not the man
[42:23] that trusteth in himself how smart we
[42:25] are how good we are how much we can get
[42:28] a job done but it's the man that
[42:31] trusteth in him Psalm 443 it says
[42:34] talking about the children of Israel for
[42:36] they got not the land in possession by
[42:38] their own sword neither did their own
[42:41] arms save them now we know that land it
[42:43] was a type of the Holy Ghost a type of
[42:46] the Holy Ghost and all the blessings
[42:47] within we didn't we didn't receive the
[42:49] spirit of God by our own sword by how
[42:52] great we are by anything we did for to
[42:55] to make him come down upon us
[42:58] that's not what happened and we can get
[42:59] in trouble when we try and get it by our
[43:02] own sword the work has already been done
[43:05] th this is a time of acceptance the work
[43:08] has been
[43:09] done it's been bought and it's been paid
[43:12] for and it's therefore the taking this
[43:14] is a time where we realize that it's
[43:16] been done and we accept it in our own
[43:19] heart where we accept what he's done for
[43:23] us but sometimes it's a struggle to
[43:25] accept it because we we might want to to
[43:27] take some credit we we might want to
[43:29] think that that we've done something to
[43:31] make oursel better that's just part of
[43:33] human nature wanting to take credit for
[43:34] something that's just people in general
[43:36] we always want to we want to be
[43:38] recognized we want to take credit for
[43:40] things that we do but with God it
[43:43] doesn't work that way you you got to lay
[43:44] it all down you got to there's no credit
[43:47] to be had I I was born and then up till
[43:50] when he came into my life I can't take
[43:52] credit for anything and I can't take I
[43:54] can't take credit for anything after he
[43:56] came into my life it is all him every
[43:59] bit of it
[44:01] him let's turn to let's go to 1st Samuel
[44:04] 30 we're talking on David
[44:18] here there's a lot of the times in our
[44:21] lives when it kind of when all hope
[44:23] seems lost when there's there's no other
[44:25] way to go no other way to turn
[44:28] seems like we' just been beat over the
[44:29] head over and over and over again by the
[44:33] devil and that's usually when we get to
[44:35] the point where we try and do it oursel
[44:37] where we try and start fixing some
[44:39] things oursel we start we start trying
[44:41] to clean up things ourself you know he
[44:43] provokes us enough to where we we move
[44:46] without without seeking the Lord's will
[44:47] on something to where we take a step
[44:50] without seeing if he's even there to go
[44:51] before us so 1st Samuel 30 let's go
[44:55] verse 4 and this is this is after David
[44:57] he had been he he had done been tossed
[45:00] out he he was nobody wanted him nobody
[45:02] wanted him
[45:03] around and this is David he's coming to
[45:05] ziklag and it said the amalekites they
[45:07] had just ransacked the place they had
[45:08] took everything that was rightfully
[45:10] David's the amalekites had came in and
[45:13] they had stripped him of it they had
[45:15] took it from him and I'm sure we've been
[45:17] there before too we've came to a point
[45:19] in our lives the Lord has blessed us so
[45:21] much and then the enemy sweeps in and it
[45:24] seems like he takes every single thing
[45:27] from us he steals our joy out of a
[45:29] service we can't sit there we can't be
[45:31] happy we can't even focus in a service
[45:34] he he takes all these different things
[45:35] and he just takes them like they're his
[45:37] but they're not his they're rightfully
[45:39] Ours by the scripture you know it
[45:42] reminds me of shamgar when them
[45:43] Philistines they come marching down the
[45:46] road and the the prophet kind of
[45:48] dramatizes a little bit he tells a story
[45:50] and he says shamgar had all of his stuff
[45:52] in his barn he had it all stacked up for
[45:54] next year that was rightfully Shamu
[45:56] guards but those Philistines he knew he
[45:58] heard him coming down the road and that
[45:59] they were going to come one more time
[46:01] and they were going to take everything
[46:03] from him everything that the Lord had
[46:05] blessed him with they were about to Rob
[46:07] him of but shamgar says that he got some
[46:10] righteous indignation up that's a that's
[46:12] a righteous anger shamgar was tired of
[46:15] things being taken from him he was tired
[46:17] of the devil hounding him on the way to
[46:19] church than not being able to focus in a
[46:22] service he said I want my peace back I I
[46:24] want to be able to know that God has
[46:26] given me these things and I can keep
[46:28] them so what shamgar did he got that
[46:30] righteous indignation up and he went out
[46:32] and he killed them all and now he it was
[46:35] a supernatural killing don't I'm not
[46:37] saying he didn't do it in himself but by
[46:40] by the power that that God put in him
[46:42] shamgar eliminated the threat he
[46:44] eliminated the problem he went to the
[46:46] root cause and he took care of it he was
[46:50] sick and tired of the devil stealing
[46:52] stuff from him and that's where we got
[46:53] to get to take it back take back what's
[46:56] ours if he stolen something from you
[46:58] take it back the word says you can have
[47:00] it the word says it's yours the word
[47:03] says you can have joy that you can have
[47:05] happiness in your life the word says you
[47:07] can be healed it says you can have peace
[47:09] what was he chastised for our
[47:12] peace peace is a hot commodity nowadays
[47:15] because the enem is constantly attacking
[47:17] our mind it's all over social media it's
[47:19] all over the Internet he's always
[47:21] putting something in front of your eyes
[47:22] and the eyes the prophet said it's the
[47:24] gateway to the soul
[47:27] he's always putting something out in
[47:28] front of your eyes for you to view
[47:30] something we look on the streets women
[47:32] half dressed the men the men are even
[47:34] half dressed nowadays they wear shorts
[47:36] up to here they can't even dress right
[47:39] they can't even dress
[47:40] theirself but take it back it's not his
[47:45] he's a bluff none of it's
[47:49] his verse four says then David and the
[47:51] people that were were with him lifted up
[47:54] their voice and they wept until until
[47:57] they had no more power to weep who's
[47:59] been there until you've had no more
[48:02] power to weep you feel like you've cried
[48:03] every tear you got to cry you feel like
[48:06] you've prayed every prayer that you had
[48:08] to pray you don't know what else to say
[48:10] to God you're on your knees and maybe
[48:12] you're there speechless you have no idea
[48:14] what to say anymore you feel like you've
[48:15] laid your heart out already you feel
[48:17] like you've done all you can you feel
[48:19] like you've done your part and now
[48:21] that's when the enemy sneaks in he says
[48:22] well have you tried this and then he
[48:25] tries to get you to do it yourself
[48:27] he tries to get you to clean up yourself
[48:29] make yourself
[48:30] better verse 5 says and David's two
[48:33] wives were taken captive henon the jezus
[48:36] and Abigail the wife of nabal the
[48:38] Carmelite and David was greatly
[48:40] distressed for the people spake of
[48:42] stoning him because the soul of all the
[48:45] people was grieved every man for his
[48:47] sons and for his daughters but David
[48:50] encouraged himself in the Lord his God
[48:54] David didn't encourage himself by saying
[48:56] look how strong I am look how smart I am
[48:59] look how great of a warrior I am he
[49:01] didn't even sit there and say oh look
[49:02] I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ look how
[49:04] great I am because that's something we
[49:06] don't need to get away from we may be
[49:08] the Bride of Jesus Christ but if we
[49:10] don't look back to here and realize why
[49:12] any of the blessings are even possible
[49:14] if we ever lose sight of Calvary if we
[49:17] think we become so revelated and so
[49:19] lifted up and so special of a people
[49:22] that we lose sight of Calvary and its
[49:24] meaning we have to turn around and look
[49:26] look back at it we've gotten into a
[49:28] place of trouble we've got to thinking
[49:31] that we're we're a little too we're a
[49:32] little headyy and high-
[49:34] minded and as Believers we can get that
[49:36] way too we can think we're a little bit
[49:38] better than somebody and that'll affect
[49:41] saving a soul on the streets we think
[49:43] we're a little bit better maybe we start
[49:45] we we pull out our bride radar and start
[49:48] scanning people with it maybe are you
[49:50] bride are you bride can you possibly be
[49:51] bride what those don't exist if somebody
[49:55] would have scanned me before Christ came
[49:57] into my life it would have said no but
[50:00] by the grace of God but by his mercies
[50:04] which are knew every day now it says
[50:07] yes and that's because of Calvary and we
[50:11] can read the Seven Seals we can read the
[50:12] church ages we can get excited about
[50:14] that and those are great things but we
[50:16] can't never lose sight of what Calvary
[50:19] did for us in our lives what the what
[50:21] the blood of Jesus Christ does for us we
[50:24] have to plead the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:27] when these problems arise I plead the
[50:29] blood over my family o o over my health
[50:31] over my mind over my heart so that
[50:35] something can't can't get in here and
[50:37] and Harden My
[50:39] Heart it's hard to receive something
[50:41] from God if you have a hardened
[50:43] heart it's hard to do something for
[50:46] another person if your heart is hardened
[50:48] we think of King Saul his heart got
[50:50] hardened and he just wanted to harm
[50:53] David that's all he wanted to do to him
[50:56] David only only wanted to serve him
[50:58] David only wanted to help him be a part
[51:00] of everything with him but Saul through
[51:03] through complexes and through
[51:05] insecurities his heart got hardened and
[51:08] he wasn't able to do
[51:10] anything and he lost the presence of the
[51:12] Lord he had an evil spirit on him and
[51:14] that's what can happen to
[51:16] us I lost my plates here I don't even
[51:19] know verse six I think it said but David
[51:22] encouraged himself in the Lord his God
[51:24] and David said to abathar the priest a
[51:27] himc son I pray thee bring me hither the
[51:29] ephod I love that right there so David
[51:32] just they had just been ransacked
[51:33] everything had been taken from him and
[51:35] instead of using his great abilities as
[51:38] a warrior he said bring me that ephod I
[51:41] want to consult the Lord about this I
[51:42] don't want to because sometimes we can
[51:44] even even dealing with one another
[51:47] dealing with people we can we can jump
[51:49] to a conclusion and and we can approach
[51:52] somebody hastily and we can you know
[51:54] maybe we got a little bit of a temper
[51:55] and we can kind of let it out a little
[51:57] bit but David here I love what he did he
[51:59] said bring me the ephod and abathar
[52:02] brought thither the ephod to
[52:05] David and David inquired at the Lord
[52:07] saying shall I pursue after this troop
[52:10] shall I overtake them and he answered
[52:12] him pursue for Thou shalt surely
[52:14] overtake them and without fail you will
[52:18] recover
[52:20] all let's go over to verse 17 and see
[52:22] what this led to for David verse 17 says
[52:25] and David smoted them from the the
[52:26] Twilight even unto the evening of the
[52:29] day and there escaped not a man of them
[52:32] save 400 young men which rode upon
[52:34] camels and fled and David recovered all
[52:37] that the amalekites had carried
[52:40] away and David rescued as two wives and
[52:43] there was nothing lacking to them
[52:45] neither small nor great neither Sons nor
[52:48] daughters neither spoil nor anything
[52:49] that they had taken to them David
[52:51] recovered all and if you read verse 20
[52:54] David didn't just recover all of what he
[52:56] lost but he was given even more on top
[52:58] of that the the Lord is abundant he was
[53:01] given even more he didn't even know that
[53:04] he was going to come out on top like
[53:06] that David going into it he was just
[53:07] looking what I just want to get back
[53:09] what was mine but what the Lord will do
[53:11] is you'll go into a service and you'll
[53:13] say Lord I want to take back the joy
[53:15] that I once felt in these Services Lord
[53:17] I want to be revived in my heart and
[53:19] you'll have a certain standard we'll set
[53:21] our own standard right here and then he
[53:24] goes right up here and he just go go
[53:26] above and beyond beyond anything that
[53:29] you could have even thought of you
[53:31] didn't go in thinking you were going to
[53:33] be healed of whatever is you need
[53:34] healing for but he heals you of it and
[53:36] then he makes you feel even better on
[53:38] top of that maybe he heals you of a
[53:40] couple things things you didn't even
[53:41] know
[53:42] about but that's how our God works and
[53:45] David here I want to notice it's such a
[53:47] simple thing but David it was simply
[53:51] because he went that the time got hard
[53:53] and this is a very simple thought the
[53:55] time got hard and he immediately dropped
[53:58] to his knees he went to prayer there
[54:00] wasn't anything there was no thinking
[54:02] the Bible doesn't give any um it doesn't
[54:04] say he thought about anything else that
[54:06] that he considered going and smiting
[54:08] them on his own but the first thing
[54:10] David did was he dropped to his knees he
[54:13] said bring me that ephod I'm going to
[54:15] talk to the Lord about this I'm angry
[54:17] right now I'm upset the enemy's taken
[54:20] everything from me I could God are you
[54:24] even with me he didn't even ask that
[54:26] that
[54:27] question but what he did was he dropped
[54:29] straight to his knees and he consulted
[54:31] the Lord about he consulted the the one
[54:34] person about it that could actually do
[54:35] something about it the one that could
[54:37] actually fix the
[54:41] problem and people may say oh we know
[54:44] prayer is good we want to hear you know
[54:46] prayer is such a simple thing to to
[54:47] preach on or talk about and people say I
[54:50] I want to hear Mysteries I want to hear
[54:51] I want to hear somebody get up and
[54:53] really tell me about all these Mysteries
[54:55] that we have in the message these deep
[54:56] things let let's talk about that let's
[54:58] Ponder on that and that stuff does have
[55:00] its
[55:01] place but how important is prayer how
[55:03] important was it to the prophet and if
[55:05] we want the Mysteries let me read a
[55:06] quote to you he said that's what I want
[55:08] you to do it's prayer that I depend on
[55:11] he said that's the secret of all the
[55:13] mysteries of
[55:15] God that's the secret of all the
[55:18] mysteries of God that's the key that
[55:20] opens the door to everything of God is
[55:23] prayer if you pray and you believe when
[55:25] you pray pray then believe that you
[55:27] receive what you ask for and God will
[55:30] make it
[55:32] known it's prayer that unlocks it all
[55:35] such a simple thing a thing that maybe
[55:37] sometimes we brush off oh I know to pray
[55:40] I know I know you know you try and give
[55:42] somebody advice you say well have you
[55:43] prayed about it of course I know to pray
[55:46] but have we really have we really got
[55:49] down have we laid laid some time to the
[55:51] side and prayed to the Lord seeking him
[55:54] on these things
[55:57] but he'll let you try and trust in
[55:58] yourself for a while he'll let you try
[55:59] every door he'll let you try every
[56:01] solution every way that you have that
[56:04] you think you can figure out a situation
[56:06] whatever it may be in your life he'll
[56:08] let you try those doors he'll let you
[56:10] walk through them he'll let you look in
[56:12] the room he'll let you walk back out but
[56:15] today looking back to Luke and looking
[56:17] back to what happened at Calvary there's
[56:19] been a veil that's been rent in half for
[56:21] us you know when we're trying to do it
[56:23] our own way we're trying to stitch that
[56:25] Veil back together together we're trying
[56:27] to put something back in between us and
[56:29] the Lord but the veil was Rin we can
[56:31] talk directly to him he can talk
[56:33] directly to us we can receive these
[56:36] blessings directly from him we don't
[56:38] have to go put a bull or a goat on an
[56:40] altar anymore but it's by the shed blood
[56:43] of Jesus Christ that that Veil it was
[56:45] rent that we're able to receive these
[56:48] things we don't have to push and pull
[56:50] it's already been done for us the
[56:52] prophet here in the message the mighty
[56:54] conqueror he says you can't walk walk
[56:56] outside of this Veil he said you've got
[56:58] to come in here to find out you've got
[57:00] to get here where there's nothing
[57:02] between you and God think about that do
[57:06] an inventory in your mind where there's
[57:08] nothing between you and God where the
[57:10] angels of God can descend and Ascend
[57:13] back and forth bringing the messages of
[57:15] God back and forth to the individual
[57:17] there's nothing between my soul and the
[57:20] Savior the poet said he said there he
[57:23] sits the mighty conqueror he rent every
[57:26] Veil into he rent The Veil that you
[57:29] could be saved he rent The Veil that if
[57:31] you've committed adultery if you have
[57:34] cursed if you've done anything wrong he
[57:36] rent that Veil for you that stick that
[57:39] Satan holds over you he rent
[57:42] it if you've only received him now that
[57:45] stick I like that he said it like that
[57:47] how many of us have felt like sat that
[57:49] we messed up somewhere and there's a
[57:51] stick that Satan holds over you maybe
[57:53] when you're in a time of prayer when
[57:55] you're trying to get down that he just
[57:56] sits there and he holds it over your
[57:58] head and you can't get it out of your
[58:00] mind route when you go to when you're
[58:02] seeking the Lord that's in the Forefront
[58:04] of your mind that's a thought that the
[58:06] enemy's putting there he's trying to
[58:08] bring you into remembrance of your
[58:11] mistakes instead of remembrance of what
[58:13] happened at Calvary when we go to pray
[58:16] be in remembrance of the the shed blood
[58:18] of Jesus Christ not of your mistakes
[58:20] before the
[58:22] blood we don't care about the mistakes
[58:24] before the blood they they don't mean
[58:25] anything anything to
[58:27] us we don't need to think about those
[58:30] anymore there there's no purpose in
[58:32] looking back to those mistakes what good
[58:35] could that do you looking back to before
[58:37] you were saved what what good is that
[58:39] going to do a
[58:41] Believer that's only going to hinder a
[58:45] Believer he says he rent that Veil for
[58:48] you that stick that Satan holds over you
[58:49] he rent it if you'll only receive it he
[58:53] said if you're sick today and the doctor
[58:55] said says you can't get well he rent
[58:57] that Veil into two and everything is
[59:00] broken before God he rent every Veil he
[59:03] tears down every domain he sits there
[59:06] today present tense today the prophet
[59:10] might have said this in 56 but it's just
[59:11] as good now today he's still sitting
[59:14] there the mighty
[59:17] conqueror says the mighty conqueror
[59:19] since he rent the veil in
[59:22] two and we don't want to be caught
[59:25] trying to sew it back to together we
[59:26] don't want to be caught trying to put
[59:28] that Veil back together because we can't
[59:30] accept his grace like we said it's a
[59:33] time of acceptance It's a Time the
[59:35] work's already been done the the job's
[59:37] done the blood's
[59:40] there but it's just accepting
[59:42] it but it's difficult sometimes to
[59:45] accept it it's hard to get oursel into a
[59:47] place that last message getting into the
[59:49] right condition to accept something from
[59:51] the Lord getting into a condition to
[59:54] where we can have a Revival in the
[59:55] church it seems like Revival keeps
[59:57] getting mentioned a Revival in this
[59:59] church people want it people are
[1:00:01] yearning for it I'm not talking about a
[1:00:03] group Revival I'm talking about every
[1:00:05] individual in their own heart receiving
[1:00:08] Revival from the Lord that's what we
[1:00:09] want but but Revival it's also it's not
[1:00:13] just about the hooting and the hollering
[1:00:14] and running the aisles and doing back
[1:00:16] flips and all all that stuff that stuff
[1:00:18] is great and the spirit can get on
[1:00:20] people but what Revival is about is when
[1:00:22] you can receive that Revival in your
[1:00:24] heart and walk out of those doors and go
[1:00:26] live out there with that same Revival in
[1:00:29] your heart where when you exit this
[1:00:31] place nothing's taking it from you when
[1:00:33] you go to work it don't matter what
[1:00:35] they're what filth they're talking about
[1:00:37] you still got Revival in your heart
[1:00:38] where was that Welch man when when they
[1:00:40] approached him and they said where's the
[1:00:42] Revival at and he said he was at work he
[1:00:45] said the Revival's right here it's in me
[1:00:48] this is where the Revival
[1:00:50] is Revival isn't about how loud it gets
[1:00:53] it's about if God can actually get to
[1:00:54] that heart and if he can do something
[1:00:56] with it but if we have these things
[1:00:58] laying in the way we got to get them out
[1:01:00] of the way first we got to make things
[1:01:03] right we got to follow his outline of
[1:01:05] how he said to do it if we want to
[1:01:08] receive
[1:01:11] something I just like to quote the
[1:01:13] message that we heard too and this is to
[1:01:15] me this is what Revival looks like you
[1:01:18] know Christ that we don't want to Smite
[1:01:19] The Rock a second time it's already been
[1:01:21] smitten The Rock has been smitten we
[1:01:24] just need to speak to it now and the
[1:01:26] prophet said what we heard Wednesday he
[1:01:28] said if you need Joy speak to the Rock
[1:01:31] he said if you need salvation let this
[1:01:33] sink deep in your heart if you need
[1:01:35] salvation speak to the Rock if you need
[1:01:37] Divine Healing speak to the Rock if you
[1:01:40] need the Holy Ghost speak to the Rock
[1:01:43] and he'll bring forth his Waters the
[1:01:45] Waters of Salvation if you'll just speak
[1:01:47] to the Rock anything you have need of
[1:01:50] speak to the
[1:01:53] Rock he said the rock is just the same
[1:01:56] today as he ever was he still got
[1:01:59] eternal life he still got Eternal peace
[1:02:03] he still got joy unspeakable and full of
[1:02:05] Glory you know what message a prophet
[1:02:07] preached more than any other message
[1:02:09] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:12] and forever Hebrews 138 he wanted to get
[1:02:15] that point across the Lord wanted you to
[1:02:17] know I'm the same as I was then what you
[1:02:20] seen me do then I can do now I can move
[1:02:23] upon you now Jehovah of the old is Jesus
[1:02:26] of the new I'm still the same I haven't
[1:02:29] left you I haven't forsaken you there
[1:02:32] may be afflictions but I'm still the
[1:02:33] same what did I do with the Hebrew
[1:02:35] children I was the fourth man in the
[1:02:36] fire then and I can still be that now
[1:02:40] but he's waiting for somebody to accept
[1:02:42] that word that's in the word he's
[1:02:45] waiting for somebody an individual to
[1:02:47] grab a hold of it and let that sink into
[1:02:49] their heart you know we read it and we
[1:02:51] say that's a beautiful scripture that's
[1:02:53] really nice he would do that and then we
[1:02:55] don't think that I'm I'm in the fire
[1:02:57] right now well if you're in the fire
[1:02:59] right now he can be your fourth man he
[1:03:02] can still do it for
[1:03:04] you he's in everpresent help in times of
[1:03:07] trouble he can still be there he hasn't
[1:03:09] changed a bit if I wouldn't hang my soul
[1:03:12] on a God that changes a God that moves
[1:03:14] around a God that's that's kind of
[1:03:16] whimsical that just changes his mind and
[1:03:18] I'll heal you today I won't now no but
[1:03:20] the promise is there he's done it before
[1:03:23] believe he can do it again what's a song
[1:03:26] only
[1:03:27] believe it's simple we make it difficult
[1:03:30] sometimes but it's simple to just
[1:03:31] believe just take this word and take it
[1:03:34] into your heart and believe
[1:03:37] it he said he's still joy unspeakable
[1:03:40] and full of Glory still got Divine
[1:03:42] Healing he's the same yesterday day and
[1:03:43] forever the only thing that people need
[1:03:45] to do is speak to the Rock Amen you
[1:03:48] believe that how how often I don't know
[1:03:51] this's a little thought I had I don't
[1:03:52] know if I mentioned it here that
[1:03:53] Wednesday or not how often do we do we
[1:03:56] forget to call our loved ones you know
[1:03:58] we we'll call our our mom or our dad or
[1:04:00] our brother or sister whoever it may be
[1:04:02] we'll call them and be on the phone
[1:04:04] every day with them and talk hours and
[1:04:06] hours and you know that shows that we
[1:04:08] were thinking about them that shows
[1:04:10] probably that we love them so why don't
[1:04:13] we do the same thing with the Lord how
[1:04:16] often do we forget to make that call
[1:04:17] every day do we slip up and maybe we
[1:04:20] don't make that call we don't spend the
[1:04:22] time we should communicating with him
[1:04:26] he looks at those things he thinks about
[1:04:29] those
[1:04:32] things I hope it is brother Rick if not
[1:04:35] we need to get it
[1:04:36] there he says let us bow our heads in
[1:04:38] and speak to the Rock everybody in
[1:04:40] prayer says Heavenly Father we come in
[1:04:41] the name of the rock I love this prayer
[1:04:43] he says the rock in a weary land the
[1:04:45] shelter in the time of storm we pray oh
[1:04:47] Lord God that The Rock will overshadow
[1:04:50] us with his power and his
[1:04:52] Mercy he said that did every sick person
[1:04:55] here make be healed today may they speak
[1:04:57] to the Rock there are men and women
[1:04:59] sitting here suffering with cancer or
[1:05:01] fill in the blank right there and that
[1:05:03] quote fill in the blank for yourself
[1:05:05] that's what I like with quotes he can
[1:05:07] heal anything so it doesn't have to just
[1:05:09] be cancer put what you got in there put
[1:05:13] what you have in that quote I'm not
[1:05:15] saying SP splice the tapes and change
[1:05:17] the quotes and change the words round
[1:05:18] don't get me wrong but put your
[1:05:21] Affliction in there make it personal to
[1:05:23] you maybe you're not sitting here with
[1:05:24] cancer today but maybe you have your own
[1:05:26] struggles whatever they may be I don't
[1:05:28] know what any of your struggles are I
[1:05:30] don't know if any of you are sick I
[1:05:32] don't know what your problems in life
[1:05:34] are I don't know if you need marital
[1:05:35] help if you need healing in your body or
[1:05:37] whatever it may be you know I could sit
[1:05:39] up here and say oh I bet somebody needs
[1:05:41] healing in their back well I'm probably
[1:05:42] right somebody probably does need
[1:05:44] healing in their back but the person
[1:05:46] that does know is him and he can take it
[1:05:48] from you right on the spot we just have
[1:05:51] to take the word and put it to use we
[1:05:55] have to take take the word and really
[1:05:57] accept it in and not just accept it in
[1:06:00] for the service today then walk out the
[1:06:01] doors then Monday rolls around tomorrow
[1:06:03] and our back hurts again and we say man
[1:06:05] I missed it I guess it didn't happen I
[1:06:08] guess I wasn't healed oh it doesn't
[1:06:10] matter it's probably going to get worse
[1:06:12] the prophet told us it will get worse
[1:06:15] and I guess we're talking on the lines
[1:06:16] of healing now but that's that's what it
[1:06:18] is it'll get worse but you have to
[1:06:21] persevere through that you have to keep
[1:06:23] a steadfast faith through the
[1:06:29] Affliction he said send there suffer
[1:06:31] with cancer some of them blind and some
[1:06:33] crippled the doctor says there's no hope
[1:06:34] in them then let them speak to the Rock
[1:06:38] I wanted to find a quote I had on him
[1:06:40] being on that
[1:06:44] thought bear with me
[1:06:49] here here it is it's in the church age
[1:06:52] book it's on that Revelation that that
[1:06:55] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:06:56] and forever in the church age book it
[1:06:59] said it is the revelation of God that
[1:07:01] will give you authority over every devil
[1:07:05] it's the revelation of God that'll give
[1:07:07] you authority over every devil it's not
[1:07:09] the it's not how great you are how much
[1:07:11] you've accomplished and he said that
[1:07:12] Revelation in the church age book he
[1:07:14] called that Revelation in particular the
[1:07:16] Keystone of the Bible do we all know
[1:07:19] what a keystone is it's a top of an
[1:07:21] archway when one part comes up and the
[1:07:23] other part comes up and that Keystone
[1:07:25] right in the middle it's what connects
[1:07:27] every bit of it it's what makes every
[1:07:29] bit of it make sense it's what makes
[1:07:31] your healing make sense your deliverance
[1:07:33] makes sense your salvation makes sense
[1:07:36] it's what it's what helps the Old
[1:07:38] Testament type the New Testament he said
[1:07:40] that revelation of God right there
[1:07:42] that's the Keystone of the
[1:07:44] Bible he said and you can see why they
[1:07:46] would add or take from it would be
[1:07:48] cursed he said it would have to be so
[1:07:51] for who can add or take away from the
[1:07:53] perfect revelation of God and over
[1:07:55] overcome the enemy it is that simple
[1:07:58] there is nothing of such prevailing
[1:08:00] power as the revelation of the word in
[1:08:04] another place he said he's the same
[1:08:05] elshad tonight said he changes not and
[1:08:09] his Covenant people which would be us
[1:08:12] has the same privilege to draw from the
[1:08:15] same source that the Father Abraham had
[1:08:17] to draw because God swore by the same
[1:08:20] Covenant that he'd give us the promise
[1:08:23] Hallelujah he says oh my there you are
[1:08:25] there's where my hope is built on
[1:08:27] nothing less but Jesus's blood and his
[1:08:33] righteousness said when all around my
[1:08:35] soul gives away I've been there before
[1:08:39] when I felt like all around my soul had
[1:08:41] given away like I didn't have anywhere
[1:08:42] else to
[1:08:44] go he's All My Hope and stay on Christ
[1:08:48] the solid rock I stand all other ground
[1:08:51] is sink in sand he said there you are he
[1:08:54] said elshad the the bosom the breasted
[1:08:56] God if you need salvation for your weak
[1:08:59] Soul draw from his side if you need
[1:09:01] healing for your body draw from this
[1:09:03] side for my Covenant was with Christ my
[1:09:05] son and in there he was wounded for your
[1:09:08] transgressions and he was by his stripes
[1:09:11] you were healed he said I'm the almighty
[1:09:13] just lean up here and go to drawing from
[1:09:15] them
[1:09:17] promises he said just lean up here when
[1:09:19] I think about leaning on something it's
[1:09:21] not I'm not pushing and pulling I'm just
[1:09:23] sitting and I'm just accepting I'm just
[1:09:25] waiting on something if I'm leaning on a
[1:09:27] wall then I'm just at rest and when we
[1:09:30] pray for these things just go to
[1:09:33] rest just sit there and lean and lean as
[1:09:36] long as it takes just lean and rest and
[1:09:40] see if it doesn't come forth see if
[1:09:43] through patience see if through waiting
[1:09:44] on the Lord see if the promise doesn't
[1:09:47] doesn't
[1:09:49] happen he said God you promised it Lord
[1:09:52] tomorrow I don't care how you feel what
[1:09:54] you look like Lord I'm drawing from that
[1:09:56] promise watch how strength begins to
[1:09:58] renew how things begin to straighten up
[1:10:01] how arms begin to move out how eyes
[1:10:03] begin to brighten up how Hearts begin to
[1:10:06] beat normal he said the breasted God I'm
[1:10:10] drawing he said well I don't care how I
[1:10:11] feel what I look like I'm drawing from
[1:10:15] that
[1:10:19] breast he's got another spot I'm trying
[1:10:21] to find here I'm all all over the place
[1:10:23] I done went down and up and in the
[1:10:24] middle and
[1:10:28] let me
[1:10:35] see well I'll get to it sooner or
[1:10:38] later yeah the prophet says here but you
[1:10:41] might say to me brother brandom I've
[1:10:43] already did
[1:10:44] that is in the door to the heart when
[1:10:47] Jesus knocked at my heart I let him in
[1:10:49] he said well that's good but when he
[1:10:51] come into your heart did you welcome him
[1:10:53] to your entire being
[1:10:56] he said there's many people that will
[1:10:58] welcome Jesus and his savior but can he
[1:11:01] be your lord can he take complete
[1:11:04] control in you he said Lord is ownership
[1:11:07] the Lord has complete control you would
[1:11:10] plenty welcome him to keep you out of
[1:11:12] hell and torment you would welcome him
[1:11:14] as your savior but are you willing to
[1:11:16] welcome him as your lord to take over
[1:11:18] full control you know we have to
[1:11:21] approach God With No Reservations
[1:11:24] holding nothing back not wanting to keep
[1:11:26] anything to ourself everything can be
[1:11:28] taken away if need be that's the kind of
[1:11:31] attitude we have to have and God loves
[1:11:33] he loves a desperate and a broken heart
[1:11:35] a heart that's just that's in pieces he
[1:11:38] loves to put it back together he loves
[1:11:40] to mend things it's like the Potter and
[1:11:42] the clay I think the first time I
[1:11:43] preached here I spoke on the Potter and
[1:11:45] the clay how that clay it's probably
[1:11:48] it's it's sitting there getting smooshed
[1:11:49] and beat on and and pushed around and if
[1:11:52] it had a mind of its own it'd probably
[1:11:53] be pretty confused but but all it's
[1:11:55] doing it's getting it to the Masterpiece
[1:11:58] that the that the Potter wants it to get
[1:12:00] to that's all that this that's all that
[1:12:02] this life here is getting us to the
[1:12:05] Masterpiece that he wants us to be and I
[1:12:07] don't mean in our flesh I don't mean
[1:12:09] sitting here we're going to we're going
[1:12:11] to struggle with the flesh as long as
[1:12:13] we're here we're going to make mistakes
[1:12:16] but the Perfection is through the blood
[1:12:17] when he sees us and we're perfect that's
[1:12:19] through the blood of Jesus Christ we're
[1:12:21] not perfect in our flesh we're not
[1:12:23] perfect in making our better but it's
[1:12:26] only through that shed blood that we can
[1:12:29] be
[1:12:31] perfect he said that's a danger of
[1:12:33] rejecting Jesus Christ tomorrow some
[1:12:35] other time he said you get so hard and
[1:12:37] so callous you don't want nothing about
[1:12:39] it he said that's what the world is
[1:12:42] today it's getting so calloused it don't
[1:12:44] want Christ it's got so much luxury in
[1:12:48] things and if we could turn over to
[1:12:50] Psalm 51
[1:12:56] verse 7-1
[1:13:12] 17 verse seven
[1:13:14] reads David talking here Purge me with
[1:13:19] hisp now David who is he asking to purge
[1:13:22] him the Lord he says' and I shall be
[1:13:26] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[1:13:28] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[1:13:30] that the bones which thou Hast broken
[1:13:32] May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins
[1:13:35] and blot out all mine iniquities this
[1:13:37] should be all of our prayer this should
[1:13:39] every day of our life this should we
[1:13:41] shouldn't get to a point where we think
[1:13:42] we're Beyond praying this prayer right
[1:13:44] here we'll never get to that point while
[1:13:47] we're here he said and blot out all mine
[1:13:50] iniquities he said create in me a clean
[1:13:52] heart oh God and renew a right spirit
[1:13:55] Within Me cast me not away from thy
[1:13:57] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[1:14:00] from me restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:14:04] salvation Lord restore the joy that the
[1:14:06] devil stole from me the joy I used to
[1:14:08] walk in here and I used to love Services
[1:14:11] I used to be so excited to get to the
[1:14:12] house of God lord restore that to my
[1:14:15] heart if that's your prayer I hope he
[1:14:17] restores that to your heart I've been
[1:14:19] there before I I've I've been to a place
[1:14:21] where I've came to services and I'm
[1:14:22] being open and honest now where I've
[1:14:23] came to services and I want looking
[1:14:25] forward to it I it was more of a work to
[1:14:27] me than it was me me doing something you
[1:14:30] know out of out of my heart wanting to
[1:14:32] do something unto the
[1:14:34] Lord and if you pray that prayer he will
[1:14:37] bring that Joy back that Joy was brought
[1:14:39] back to me I was brought back to a place
[1:14:42] back to the beginning really because in
[1:14:44] the beginning when when it's brand new
[1:14:47] and you realize that are you telling me
[1:14:48] this man Jesus he marched to Calvary and
[1:14:51] he died for me when he didn't have to
[1:14:53] when that Revelation and that that
[1:14:55] thought is brand new in your mind that
[1:14:58] that's when we come in here on fire that
[1:15:01] that's a thought that leads to
[1:15:02] Revival that's a thought that leads to
[1:15:04] the spirit of God
[1:15:08] falling he says restore unto me the joy
[1:15:10] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[1:15:12] free spirit then I will teach
[1:15:14] transgressors thy ways I love that right
[1:15:17] there then I will teach transgressors
[1:15:18] thy ways and sinners shall be converted
[1:15:21] unto thee deliver me from blood
[1:15:23] guiltiness oh God and thou God of my
[1:15:25] salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud
[1:15:28] of thy righteousness oh Lord open my
[1:15:30] lips and my mouth shall show forth thy
[1:15:32] praise for thou desirest not sacrifice
[1:15:36] else would I give
[1:15:37] it thou Delight us not in burnt offering
[1:15:41] that's like us he's not the The Works
[1:15:43] are
[1:15:45] good but that's not what he's looking
[1:15:47] for he wants your
[1:15:49] heart he he wants to put a new spirit in
[1:15:51] you he and he wants to do it over and
[1:15:53] over again baptism after baptism he
[1:15:56] doesn't ever want to stop the The Works
[1:15:58] are great and the works are good but he
[1:16:00] just wants your heart that's all he
[1:16:02] cares about because if he if he gets a
[1:16:04] hold of your heart then the works are
[1:16:06] real then the works really mean
[1:16:08] something then but if he hadn't got a
[1:16:10] hold of that heart yet the works are
[1:16:12] they're okay you're still a good person
[1:16:15] there's a lot of good people out there
[1:16:16] but I want God to get so aold of my
[1:16:19] heart that I want to work for him
[1:16:21] nonstop and I don't want to work because
[1:16:24] because of anything I don't want any
[1:16:26] reward I don't want to I don't want them
[1:16:28] to talk about like he tells that story I
[1:16:30] can't think of the brother but I think
[1:16:31] he he got to heaven and they what they
[1:16:33] talk about his his crown and his robe
[1:16:35] and he said I don't want to be talked to
[1:16:37] about that I just want to look at him
[1:16:39] for a thousand years don't talk to me
[1:16:41] about those
[1:16:42] things everything I did down here was
[1:16:45] for him I didn't seek no reward I didn't
[1:16:48] need anything need any payment he had
[1:16:51] already paid the ultimate price for me
[1:16:54] and then that revelation came into my
[1:16:55] heart and then I worked for him every
[1:16:57] day of my
[1:17:00] life he says for thou desirest not
[1:17:02] sacrifice else I would give it thou
[1:17:04] desirest not in burnt offering the
[1:17:06] sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a
[1:17:09] broken and contrite heart oh God thou
[1:17:12] wil not
[1:17:13] despise then Ezekiel
[1:17:16] 36:26 says a new heart also will I give
[1:17:19] you and a new spirit will I put within
[1:17:22] you and I will take away the Stony heart
[1:17:24] out of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:17:27] heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit
[1:17:30] within you and cause you to walk in my
[1:17:33] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:17:35] and do them the prophet says in Hebrews
[1:17:38] he says and if your heart begins to
[1:17:40] stray around you know there is something
[1:17:42] that's happening go back to the Altar
[1:17:44] and say Christ renew my the joy of my
[1:17:47] salvation give unto me that love that I
[1:17:50] once had it's leaking out Lord there's
[1:17:53] something I've done make me holy again
[1:17:55] stand said oh Lord nothing I could do I
[1:18:00] can't quit this and I can't quit that
[1:18:03] I'm looking to you to take it out of me
[1:18:06] Lord and I love you he's the only one
[1:18:08] that can change your desires he's the
[1:18:10] only one that can change your nature no
[1:18:13] matter how hard we fight no matter how
[1:18:15] hard we pull if there's still some
[1:18:17] Desires in there that aren't quite right
[1:18:19] we have to lean on him to change those
[1:18:22] things we have to act not just that we
[1:18:25] have to lean on him to change anything
[1:18:26] and
[1:18:28] everything he said and walk away from
[1:18:30] the altar a new person in Christ Jesus
[1:18:33] then you won't have to depend on your
[1:18:35] church depend on your priest depend on
[1:18:37] your
[1:18:38] pastor you're depending on the shed
[1:18:41] blood of the Lord Jesus by grace are you
[1:18:46] saved and such a simple thought but we
[1:18:50] have to have that revelation of by Grace
[1:18:52] you are saved every single day or else
[1:18:55] if we don't have that in our hearts
[1:18:57] we'll start doing it ourself we'll start
[1:18:59] making our own way let's go to one more
[1:19:01] scripture Mark 5:
[1:19:08] 21-30 I just want to look at two people
[1:19:11] who maybe tried to do it all their
[1:19:21] self verse 21 reads and when Jesus was
[1:19:24] passed over Over Again by ship unto the
[1:19:25] other side much people gathered unto him
[1:19:28] and he was nigh unto the sea and behold
[1:19:31] there cometh one of the rulers of the
[1:19:32] sinagogue jerus by name and when he saw
[1:19:35] him he fell at his feet what a great
[1:19:39] place to be what a great place to get to
[1:19:43] what I don't think that's in the in the
[1:19:44] scripture by happen stance he fell at
[1:19:48] his feet and besought him greatly saying
[1:19:50] my little daughter lith at the point of
[1:19:53] death I pray thee come and lay thy hands
[1:19:55] on her that she may be healed and she
[1:19:58] shall live now Jesus liked the
[1:20:01] expectations that gyrus came forth with
[1:20:04] that's his expectations right there he
[1:20:06] he blatantly said I believe if you come
[1:20:09] that she will be
[1:20:11] healed and Jesus went with him and much
[1:20:15] people followed him you know sometimes
[1:20:16] when we come in with the wrong
[1:20:18] expectations it it wouldn't be and Jesus
[1:20:20] went with him it would be and Jesus
[1:20:22] departed from him and Jesus got away
[1:20:24] from him we have to walk through those
[1:20:27] doors like the like the Pastor said this
[1:20:29] morning what you expect is what you'll
[1:20:32] get and that's so true that's true in
[1:20:34] every aspect of life and especially true
[1:20:36] in the house of God what you expect you
[1:20:39] will get and gyrus got what he expected
[1:20:42] is a clear proof of it and Jesus went
[1:20:44] with him and much people followed him
[1:20:46] and thronged him and a certain woman
[1:20:48] which had an issue of blood 12 years and
[1:20:50] had suffered many things and many
[1:20:52] Physicians look at this next line and
[1:20:54] had spent all that she had and nothing
[1:20:58] better and had spent all that she had
[1:21:02] how many of us have gotten to the point
[1:21:04] where we have spent all that we had I'm
[1:21:07] not talking about out of our wallet I'm
[1:21:10] talking about our our mind what we can't
[1:21:12] think about it anymore we can't think
[1:21:14] about the problems we can't thinking
[1:21:16] about the healing we spent all that we
[1:21:18] have
[1:21:19] emotionally spiritually and we're at a
[1:21:22] point like she was at she had spent all
[1:21:25] that she had she said but rather it said
[1:21:28] but rather grew worse when she had heard
[1:21:30] of Jesus came in the press behind him
[1:21:32] and touched His Garment for she said if
[1:21:35] I may touch but his clothes here comes
[1:21:36] her expectation Here Comes her
[1:21:39] expectation coming
[1:21:40] forth if I may but touch his clothes I
[1:21:43] shall be whole and straight way the
[1:21:46] Fountain of her blood was dried up and
[1:21:49] she felt in her body that she was healed
[1:21:51] of that plague and Jesus immediately
[1:21:53] knowing in himself that virt had gone
[1:21:55] out of him turned him about in the press
[1:21:57] and said who touched my clothes their
[1:22:01] hopes their their everything relied on
[1:22:04] Jesus Christ that day they were at the
[1:22:07] end of their Road they were at a point
[1:22:09] where they couldn't put their hope and
[1:22:10] anything else she had tried doctors gyus
[1:22:13] said he had probably tried doctors too
[1:22:15] they had probably tried everything they
[1:22:17] knew to try and they finally got to that
[1:22:19] last door which was Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ and what I would like to say
[1:22:24] maybe maybe sometimes it would be better
[1:22:26] if he was the first door and he wasn't
[1:22:28] that last door if we could these
[1:22:30] scriptures are here to learn by these
[1:22:32] things to take a lesson from
[1:22:35] it Psalm 39:7 says and now Lord what
[1:22:38] wait I for my hope is in thee Psalm 135
[1:22:42] says I wait for the Lord my soul doth
[1:22:43] wait and in his word do I hope
[1:22:46] Lamentations 3:19 through 24 says
[1:22:49] remembering mine Affliction and my
[1:22:52] misery the wormwood and the gold my soul
[1:22:55] hath them still in remembrance and is
[1:22:58] humbled in me this I recall to my mind
[1:23:01] therefore have I hope it is of the
[1:23:03] Lord's mercies that we are not
[1:23:06] consumed because his compassions fail
[1:23:09] not they are new every morning great is
[1:23:12] thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion
[1:23:15] that's that's the to the individual we
[1:23:18] should say that the Lord is my portion
[1:23:20] saith my soul therefore will I hope in
[1:23:25] him my prayer is Lord let me be in
[1:23:27] remembrance of what you've done for me
[1:23:29] let me be in expectation of what you're
[1:23:31] going to do for me but Lord don't let me
[1:23:34] pass up on these present blessings in my
[1:23:36] life Lord don't let me forget where
[1:23:38] you've put me right
[1:23:40] now and it's only by the shed blood of
[1:23:43] Jesus Christ it's only as the first song
[1:23:45] said right there the Amazing Grace of
[1:23:48] Jesus Christ that this has
[1:23:51] happened it's not about our past
[1:23:53] mistakes
[1:23:55] it's not about any of that stuffff but
[1:23:57] those are things that we're that he
[1:23:58] tries to remind us of and just as the
[1:24:01] musicians come I just have a few more
[1:24:02] quotes here to
[1:24:05] read the prophet in that day on
[1:24:09] Calvary he said now there's where we
[1:24:11] lose our position if we don't watch we
[1:24:15] try to look back to what we was and as
[1:24:18] long as we look back to what we was the
[1:24:21] sacrifice means nothing to us
[1:24:25] he says oh can't you see it church I
[1:24:27] would I would not try the job I can't
[1:24:29] and neither can you there's no need of
[1:24:32] trying he said you're lost to begin with
[1:24:35] and as long as you look back to what
[1:24:36] you've done but don't look to what but
[1:24:39] don't look to what you've done he says
[1:24:41] look what that day on Calvary did to you
[1:24:44] he said it paid your price it settled
[1:24:48] the question your sins be as Scarlet
[1:24:50] they're as white as snow red like
[1:24:53] Crimson white like wool
[1:24:55] then you have no sin you are perfectly
[1:24:57] sinless no matter what you done or what
[1:25:00] you do you're still sinless as long as
[1:25:03] you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:25:06] savior your sins are
[1:25:08] forgiven Anything Is Forgiven is
[1:25:11] remitted and forgot about if God's
[1:25:14] forgot about it won't you forget about
[1:25:16] it if it's been thrown away until the SE
[1:25:19] of forgetfulness now it's easier said
[1:25:22] than done but then won't you forget
[1:25:23] about it quit letting the devil hold
[1:25:25] that stick over your head quit letting
[1:25:27] him hold whatever that thing may
[1:25:30] be it's gone it's forgotten about it's
[1:25:35] forgiven in another place the prophet
[1:25:37] says now just don't turn loose he says
[1:25:40] take a hold just hold on the calvary
[1:25:43] until you're satisfied every portion
[1:25:46] that God promised is
[1:25:48] satisfied he said that's right get right
[1:25:50] down to business he said when you get to
[1:25:52] business God will get to business
[1:25:55] he said it'll be up to you now just
[1:25:57] claim those promises to you he said oh
[1:26:00] God I believe you I will never turn
[1:26:02] loose I'll stay right here till
[1:26:04] something happens to my soul said
[1:26:07] remember friends this may be the last
[1:26:09] time may be the last prayer you'll ever
[1:26:12] pray he said the death angel May summon
[1:26:14] you before
[1:26:16] daylight he said Now's the Time to get
[1:26:18] down to business with God he said Now's
[1:26:21] the Time to believe it confess your sins
[1:26:24] go right back to where you left him go
[1:26:27] right back wherever you left him and
[1:26:28] there you'll find him
[1:26:30] again said what caused you to lose your
[1:26:33] joy find out where you lost it at go
[1:26:35] right back there and say Lord I'm sorry
[1:26:38] I'm starting right
[1:26:40] here find out where you left him where
[1:26:43] did you lose your joy at wherever you
[1:26:45] lost your joy wherever you stopped
[1:26:46] serving him go right back to that spot
[1:26:48] again start right there right where you

[1:27:10] today Lord both the
[1:27:15] services father we know that there's a
[1:27:17] way back your Prophet preached
[1:27:20] it and Lord let us

[1:27:25] blood of Jesus Christ near and dear to
[1:27:27] our
[1:27:28] heart Lord as we
[1:27:30] may we may feel revelated sometimes we
[1:27:34] may we may feel special in our own self
[1:27:37] and our own flesh but Lord help us to
[1:27:39] come to the realization that none of it
[1:27:41] is possible without what happened at
[1:27:44] Calvary with what happened at the cross
[1:27:46] that was the Pinnacle of Christianity
[1:27:48] right there there's nothing better
[1:27:50] coming than that there was never
[1:27:52] anything as good as that for
[1:27:55] it and Lord as we come into that
[1:27:57] Revelation in our heart as it's new to
[1:27:59] us as your mercies are new as it's like
[1:28:02] the first time that we realized

[1:28:09] that Lord that needs help in their soul
[1:28:12] and their Spirit they have a broken
[1:28:13] heart a a contrite heart
[1:28:16] Lord Lord the scripture told us that you
[1:28:18] will not despise
[1:28:20] that but Lord we believe that you would
[1:28:22] come down and you would touch them in
[1:28:23] their hearts
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:27] Lord help each one of us to receive more

[1:28:50] and that we may be a light in this day
[1:28:53] Lord that we could walk out of here and
[1:28:54] we could draw
[1:28:56] people not because we look
[1:28:58] different not because we act
[1:29:01] different but Lord because people can
[1:29:03] tell that there's a different spirit

[1:55:41] name amen didn't you enjoy that
[1:55:43] tonight amen I can't help but hear that
[1:55:46] story of David and that when he went to
[1:55:48] zlac and to think
[1:55:50] of you read and put the timing together
[1:55:53] a little bit that was just a week or two
[1:55:56] before he became king so here the lowest
[1:55:59] point in his life and he encouraged
[1:56:02] himself in the Lord God saw that said
[1:56:05] okay when you have nothing and
[1:56:07] everything's been taken away from you
[1:56:09] you turn to me now I see the character
[1:56:11] in you that I need to lead my people and
[1:56:15] it wasn't long before his situation
[1:56:17] completely changed and there he was the
[1:56:19] king so you may feel down and
[1:56:21] discouraged tonight but God sees the big
