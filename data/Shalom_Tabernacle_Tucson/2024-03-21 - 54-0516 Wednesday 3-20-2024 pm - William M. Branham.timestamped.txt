[23:18] one no three persons no two persons but
[23:22] one person and his name is Jesus Christ
[23:26] the Lord Jesus Christ we'd like to
[23:27] welcome you to the house of of the Lord
[23:29] tonight we're going to listen to a
[23:32] portion of this tape questions and
[23:34] answers on the law having the Shadow and
[23:37] this will kind of go into or introduce
[23:40] the second part of these uh messages
[23:43] I've been bringing on Wednesday night
[23:45] conduct order and Doctrine and we're
[23:47] going into the order part and as I Was
[23:50] preparing for that um there's several
[23:53] areas to get into um and this tape was
[23:56] one I believe we heard it before I'm
[23:59] sure we heard it before here
[24:02] um because in paragraph number 42
[24:07] brother random makes a very very strong
[24:10] statement about birth control and I
[24:13] think it's the only place that he really
[24:16] says it this harsh and but it's the
[24:19] truth and so what we have done when I
[24:21] first heard this quote it was a year or
[24:23] so ago we were listening to it
[24:25] here and uh I know a lot of people in
[24:28] the message or in the ranks of the
[24:31] message they just you know on the issue
[24:33] of birth control brother random normally
[24:36] would um counsel with the
[24:40] individual and uh he made that very
[24:43] clear but on this tape he says this and
[24:47] he says it very clearly you'll hear it
[24:50] for yourself and this is what he says
[24:53] here it's in paragraph number 42 I
[24:56] believe I think I got it
[24:59] maybe I
[25:01] did maybe I didn't all right it's up
[25:05] there yeah a baby's born form first germ
[25:09] it's in the mother's wom it's a baby I'm
[25:11] firmly against birth control see yes sir
[25:15] for where it's just as much as harm to
[25:17] take a life of a little baby that ain't
[25:20] two months old as it is to pull a pistol
[25:23] and shoot a man down in Cold Blood
[25:25] murder yes sir I'm against birth contr
[25:28] control what God sends God will take
[25:31] care of and so that was in
[25:35] 1950
[25:36] um whenever this tape is we're about to
[25:39] listening to
[25:40] 1958
[25:43] 1956 1954 all right and so
[25:49] um
[25:51] um and so this discussion came up and
[25:55] I'll go into it very quickly and then
[25:56] we'll go into the tape this discussion
[25:59] came up with some pastors I was with
[26:01] years ago from Africa that have taken
[26:05] this quote on birth control and they
[26:07] really firmly so you see these large
[26:09] large families and then when they start
[26:12] traveling to the US they found out that
[26:13] the Pastors in the US and many of our
[26:16] churches practice it very very openly
[26:20] and so how is it everybody's only have
[26:22] two kids and four kids and all like that
[26:24] and so these congregations one of the
[26:27] pastors told me that the brothers in
[26:29] these congregations went back to their
[26:31] pastors and so why didn't you bring the
[26:33] balance on this they were thinking he
[26:35] said now I have to raise all these kids
[26:37] and I kind of laughed at it but it's you
[26:40] know
[26:41] so the word of the Lord is is the truth
[26:44] that's the standard that we start with
[26:47] and what we have done many times we have
[26:49] made an exception we've made that the
[26:52] rule and so people just go right in and
[26:55] then they start practicing birth control
[26:58] and this is a you know this is a me this
[27:00] is a subject that's on the tape and here
[27:02] brother brand says it's wrong so I think
[27:04] you need to find that balance for
[27:05] yourself and find out what it really is
[27:08] and what your motive and objective is
[27:10] don't just do it because everybody else
[27:12] in the message churches are doing it
[27:15] amen now brother brandom said it's okay
[27:18] you don't have to say Amen it's still
[27:19] the truth in
[27:23] 1964 they asked the Prophet this
[27:27] question
[27:29] and look at how he answers it in 64 so
[27:31] in
[27:32] 54 when was this
[27:35] tape help me again4 in 54 this is 1964
[27:40] 10 years
[27:41] later and they asked brother
[27:46] brandom this
[27:50] question
[27:52] here oh Lord please help
[27:56] me just put it in
[28:26] here okay
[28:32] 1964 August 30th 1964 uh question number
[28:37] 420 it's a direct question direct quote
[28:40] and this kind of help give you the range
[28:42] of of the message brother bam says this
[28:45] here it's a question is it right
[28:47] according to the word to practice birth
[28:50] control I told you I'd answer that
[28:53] privately you that's got these questions
[28:57] come to me
[28:58] privately so you see the difference not
[29:01] that there's a difference but here on
[29:03] the tape he said he believes it's wrong
[29:06] he Compares it to murder he Compares it
[29:08] to shooting uh uh someone and so that's
[29:12] the reality of it and so I you know we
[29:15] say what the tapes say and we say
[29:16] everything that it says when they asked
[29:19] him 10 years later he answers it um
[29:22] privately so there's a you have to work
[29:25] those things out for yourself and as I
[29:27] said
[29:28] you know you start with what the rule is
[29:31] it's wrong and then from there there's
[29:33] exceptions and the reasons and your
[29:35] motives and your objectives okay amen
[29:38] all right don't try to take it off the
[29:40] tape he said it was wrong he compared it
[29:42] to murder and you're going to hear it
[29:45] tonight all right so let's go into um I
[29:50] don't think he gets into a scripture
[29:52] because we're going to stop this message
[29:54] a bit short before it gets into the
[29:56] scripture so just for the for the sake
[29:58] of a scripture reading let's turn
[30:02] in 1 Corinthians chapter
[30:08] 14 and like I said um we have taken the
[30:14] conduct Behavior poster Duty forsake not
[30:17] the Assembly of yourself giving your
[30:19] best how we dress fasting and praying we
[30:23] brought all that on conduct on the last
[30:26] few Wednesday services
[30:28] and we're going to start into order the
[30:31] order of things and brother Adam gets
[30:33] into a lot of that here uh in this tape
[30:36] tonight questions and answer law having
[30:39] a
[30:40] shadow the scripture reads in 1
[30:42] Corinthians
[30:44] 14 verse number 37 if a man think
[30:48] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[30:51] him acknowledge that the things that I
[30:53] write unto you are the Commandments of
[30:56] the Lord but if any man be ignorant let
[30:59] him be ignorant wherefore Brethren covet
[31:02] to prophesy and forbid not to speak with
[31:05] tongues let all things be done decently
[31:09] and in order amen so that's what we want
[31:13] tonight let's prepare our hearts to go
[31:16] to this portion of the tape and we'll
[31:19] sing only believe
[31:21] amen i' like to greet each of you see
[31:24] brother Andy in the back God bless you
[31:26] the bonds of each of you God bless you
[31:28] richly amen singing
[31:32] only
[31:34] [Music]
[31:36] believe
[31:37] only
[31:40] believe that all things are
[31:46] possible
[31:48] only
[31:49] [Music]
[31:51] believe
[31:53] only
[31:55] [Music]
[31:56] believe
[31:58] only
[32:02] believe all things are
[32:07] Poss
[32:09] only God bless you you may be seated
[32:11] brother
[32:18] brandham do and that way the Holy Spirit
[32:21] keeps us all broke up you know the
[32:24] prophet one time went down to The
[32:26] Potter's House see to be broke up to be
[32:30] melted over see you have if there's
[32:33] something wrong God don't just put a
[32:35] patch in anything he said you put a new
[32:37] piece and a in an old garment it'll make
[32:40] it worse than that that just a thing to
[32:43] do is it's if if put the whole thing so
[32:46] if you've done something wrong don't
[32:48] just get around a little say well I'm
[32:49] sorry I did it I won't try not do it
[32:51] again just break up and get molded over
[32:53] again make that piece another piece now
[32:57] last evening now in this week now
[33:01] probably tonight will be gospel teaching
[33:04] again and
[33:06] I uh I do the very best that I know how
[33:11] see and now in coming in many times you
[33:15] all think I just come in maybe this
[33:17] morning maybe they might be a stranger
[33:19] or two but most of them I perhaps
[33:21] suggest the regular little Tabernacle
[33:24] group here and sometimes teing into the
[33:27] go ble like that it isn't to make you
[33:31] angry with me or to it's what it is yes
[33:34] it's to tear you up certainly that's
[33:36] what it does the word of God sharper
[33:39] than a 28 Sword and the thing of it is
[33:43] in there there'll be this one come in
[33:44] with something that one come in with
[33:46] something this one there and all good
[33:48] people but they'll have different ideas
[33:50] and each one want to present their idea
[33:52] to the church see you can't do it the
[33:55] church has got a solid gopel doctrine
[33:59] that has to be based on the word of God
[34:01] if you got a difference why either take
[34:04] it to the pastor and let him see what he
[34:06] thinks about it and so forth and let it
[34:08] be submitted don't take some Theory now
[34:11] it has to be brought out in the word a
[34:13] lot of times the pastor build all those
[34:15] things up then when I come in he's
[34:26] dir
[34:36] very humble brother Neville he know he
[34:38] did he's just a little bit too humble he
[34:42] don't speak when he ought to
[34:45] speak that's
[34:47] that's that's right and I I I think I
[34:51] here not long ago we had a little talk
[34:53] together I said what's the matter
[34:55] brother nille is this you you you a
[34:57] loving sort of a brother and you don't
[35:00] want to hurt no one you you think I'm
[35:01] standing in the Tabernacle there well
[35:04] after all it's brother Bill's Tabernacle
[35:06] it's God's Tabernacle he's a Shepherd
[35:09] put in full
[35:10] charge that's right it's his place to do
[35:12] these things I said B said I'm you don't
[35:15] want to hurt one's feelings look if you
[35:18] side in with somebody siding this way
[35:19] and other siding this way you got to
[35:21] stand the mutual grounds and draw it
[35:23] together here and say this is it see
[35:25] that's it see you must do that
[35:28] and the people really I found this
[35:31] around the world if you'll be
[35:34] absolutely straight and
[35:37] sincere the people appreciate you more
[35:40] amen just lay it right down Jesus name
[35:44] he loved the people he even gave his
[35:45] life there for those Pharisees that were
[35:48] crucifying him and he prayed for their
[35:49] forgiveness but yet he said you
[35:51] generation of viers Snakes in the Grass
[35:55] and so forth like that he wasn't exactly
[35:57] talking to the being the human being it
[35:59] was a spirit I look at Peter coming
[36:01] behind him said oh Lord you can't do you
[36:03] turn around and said get thee behind me
[36:06] Satan are always an offense to me he
[36:09] wasn't speaking to the Apostle it was he
[36:11] was a fountain of Truth and it was the
[36:14] spirit that was on that apostle that was
[36:16] making him say that to J see and he
[36:19] wasn't speaking to Peter he loved him
[36:21] see he loved him and know he is to be
[36:24] the head of the Church of Jerusalem but
[36:26] he he was wasn't going to speak back to
[36:29] Peter he was speaking to the spirit that
[36:32] was causing Peter to hinder The Works of
[36:35] God Amen you get it that's the same

[37:08] one Accord then the whole thing a shine
[37:12] it see see what I mean and that's what
[37:15] we have to
[37:16] do last night and answering the question
[37:19] I did the best that I knew how the
[37:22] person that wanted that vicarious ailly
[37:26] Dilli it they never gave me any uh point
[37:29] on it last night that I should had
[37:32] answer it this morning or give you the
[37:33] Roman numerals written out but if you're
[37:37] here this morning and so desired all
[37:39] right You' be glad and um last evening
[37:43] after the service was over there was a a
[37:46] man came to the platform which was the
[37:49] Christian Scientist man been standing
[37:52] the
[37:53] meeting and what a great compliment he
[37:56] passed and he said he had never heard
[38:00] that type of teaching never heard the
[38:01] Bible so well explained and just go
[38:05] show walk out of the church and someone
[38:08] standing out there
[38:10] said said that guy sure is an
[38:13] impostor well of course that's someone
[38:15] that backslid from the Tabernacle here
[38:17] and went away with that group not long
[38:19] ago three or four of them pulled away
[38:22] and let this church hear this pastor and
[38:25] all regardless if those people who left
[38:29] this church they went out from us
[38:30] because it wasn't of us said the Bible
[38:32] amen right and we went to them with
[38:35] brotherly Godly love one after another
[38:38] trying to reconcile them to the church
[38:40] they wouldn't listen we take in groups
[38:42] and went with them they wouldn't listen
[38:44] then we told it to the church and the
[38:45] Bible said let them be as a heathen and
[38:48] a Publican that's right they cannot come
[38:51] back into the church without first
[38:53] coming before the church and repenting
[38:55] before the church and then repenting
[38:56] before God and then be brought back and
[38:58] see how they act actually that that's
[39:01] right they cannot come back all the
[39:03] Bible That's Bible teaching we must stay
[39:05] with this B see if the brother has off
[39:09] go to him and if he won't hear you take
[39:11] someone with him with you if you won't
[39:13] hear that tell it to the church then let
[39:14] them be as a heathen and a Publican and
[39:17] said whatever you bind on Earth I'll
[39:18] bind in heaven what you lose on Earth
[39:20] I'll lose in heaven see so we must keep
[39:23] listen hard teaching sometimes but it'll
[39:26] keep your church Church level up it'll
[39:28] keep it what God Said like I sometimes
[39:32] if anything I hate do correct my
[39:33] children when or give them a whing amen
[39:36] but I I just hate to do that but yet the
[39:39] Bible said do it and you watch these
[39:41] little people today that don't whip
[39:43] their children and correct them find out
[39:45] what they got got a little smart stomp
[39:48] their foot and slaming arme against the
[39:50] wall and ball you out app parent that's
[39:52] said see the Bible's right in everything
[39:56] isn't that right amen the Bible is right
[39:59] and everything so this has been a time
[40:01] of
[40:02] teaching um someone who wouldn't come in
[40:06] last night stood on the outside said I
[40:08] wouldn't answer all the questions that I
[40:10] went back in the room and started them
[40:12] out and found the ones I wanted to
[40:14] answer and brought that KN and answered
[40:15] them look if you put in a question I
[40:18] didn't answer you bring it to me I got
[40:20] two this morning that I gave you
[40:21] remember last night somebody brought
[40:23] them up late and I had to give him to
[40:24] brother Neville and I got him this
[40:25] morning the answer I try to answer
[40:28] everyone to the best of my knowledge
[40:31] what is thus sayith the Lord now you may
[40:34] miserably disagree with me on things but
[40:38] just the same the love of God will
[40:40] remain just the same towards you and I
[40:44] because we're children together and
[40:46] before we start the morning's uh Sabbath
[40:49] teachings which we hope not to take too
[40:51] long whatever the Lord will and then I
[40:55] want to answer this now remember Church
[40:59] you every one of you knows what this
[41:01] church stands for you absolutely
[41:05] understand now we don't have any
[41:07] membership we just have Fellowship see
[41:10] because if we have membership then we
[41:13] bring the people like to an organization
[41:16] which we are strictly inter
[41:19] denominational
[41:20] unorganized only one thing to lead us
[41:23] that's the Holy Spirit and we believe
[41:25] that the Holy Spirit leads through our
[41:27] leader if God set a a Holy Spirit set a
[41:31] teacher in the church then if the Holy
[41:33] Spirit wants the church to know
[41:34] something he'll speak through the
[41:35] teacher amen for the Holy Spirit that's
[41:38] what the teacher is ordained to do is
[41:41] that right it's ordained that gift is in
[41:44] the church as a teacher and we should
[41:46] all listen to it until that gift goes to
[41:49] proving something that isn't right in
[41:51] the Bible then we have a right to
[41:53] question it see as long as it's not the
[41:55] go saying well there's no such a thing
[41:57] thing is water baptism is no such a
[41:59] thing as this that the other are the
[42:01] baptism of Holy Spirit then question
[42:03] that see amen but now the Holy Spirit
[42:07] leads now the church believes in the
[42:09] baptism of
[42:11] water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:14] Christ for the remission of sins after
[42:18] repentance it believes in the baptism of
[42:22] the holy spirit with the fruits of the
[42:25] spirit following
[42:28] the fruits of the spirit longsuffering
[42:30] gentleness patience goodness meekness we
[42:34] believe in nine spiritual gifts all nine
[42:37] of them wisdom knowledge teachers
[42:40] Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues
[42:42] interpretation of tongues Divine Healing
[42:45] those things we believe we believe in
[42:47] church government and the government is
[42:50] ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible
[42:54] the pastor is always the head of the
[42:57] Church yes the pastor is always that's
[43:00] God's Elder in organizations you have to
[43:02] come to the bishop now the Bible there's
[43:04] no higher order in the Bible than the
[43:08] Elder of the church that's right just
[43:10] tell me where it's that there's no
[43:12] higher order in the Bible for the church
[43:15] than the Elder which is the pastor he's
[43:18] the highest order of the Bible and then
[43:21] if U the the Elder if don't receive any
[43:25] acquisation against your Elder unless it
[43:27] first be by two or three Witnesses no
[43:31] matter what anybody says about an elder
[43:33] don't you believe it until you have two
[43:35] or three Witnesses and let them
[43:37] Witnesses be tried
[43:39] first and then if that Elder has done
[43:41] something wrong and these three Holy
[43:43] Ghost Witnesses have been tried and
[43:45] proved that they've really done
[43:46] something to the Elder then go to the
[43:48] Elder and that sin openly rebuked see
[43:51] that others might see and take heed now
[43:55] in orders of the church and now we just
[43:57] trust that God will keep you perfect and
[44:00] your hearts stayed upon him and remember
[44:03] friend this glorious church that we've
[44:05] been talking about and this last week
[44:08] why can't we have that here on eth and
[44:10] 10th Street amen we've got the
[44:14] qualification we've got the people who
[44:16] love
[44:17] God don't you believe that we got we got
[44:21] people in here I see strangers in here
[44:24] coming in since brother Neville has been
[44:26] Pastor here a fine people I meet him
[44:29] here at the altar people from Louisville
[44:31] people from Henryville new albony and
[44:33] around people I don't even though I've
[44:35] never seen them in my life wonderful
[44:39] people now would you all like to have a
[44:42] real Bible Church a real Bible Church
[44:47] where all the spiritual gifts were
[44:50] setting order everything making manifest
[44:53] just exactly the way it should be would
[44:55] that be wonderful now you're going to
[44:58] have to
[45:01] sacrifice not money you're going to have
[45:04] to sacrifice what some of your own
[45:07] ideas you're going to have to sacrifice
[45:09] some time in prayer you're going to have
[45:12] to sacrifice your maybe a stubborn will
[45:15] to break down in
[45:17] humility see you're going to have the
[45:20] whole Christian move is
[45:25] sacrificial he that will follow me let
[45:28] him deny himself take up his cross and
[45:31] follow me daily is that right how often
[45:34] you have to sacrifice every
[45:37] day Paul said he died daily every day
[45:42] died now I
[45:44] believe with God's
[45:46] help our brother Neville and I just went
[45:49] through a great Siege of going through
[45:53] different things and rubbing over
[45:54] different things and trying to find out
[45:58] and I say this not brother Neville don't
[46:00] even know I'm saying knows nothing about
[46:02] it he's just sitting there that's all I
[46:04] question him in the doctrine of this
[46:07] Tabernacle see if it was
[46:11] right and he's
[46:13] right he teaches the doctrine now what I
[46:16] find in the church is leading up to an
[46:19] answer here in one of these questions
[46:21] that I give which is the only one that I
[46:23] know these all in here I think if I'm
[46:26] not mistaken
[46:29] yeah these are the same some of the same
[46:30] ones was here last night look them over
[46:33] brother NE see if they are if you will
[46:34] and get them back to me see y' and um
[46:37] that's what I come in for at these times
[46:40] is to look around in congregation is
[46:43] more or less the as Paul told to one of
[46:46] the elders down there keep these things
[46:48] when I come down we accept the church in
[46:50] order first thing I got with brother
[46:52] Neville see what he believed see if
[46:54] there's any contrary and our our faith
[46:57] our our way or explain the Bible there
[46:59] wasn't one eror we went right straight
[47:01] through the same thing then if the Elder
[47:03] and I and he's teaching it right then we
[47:05] got to find out where the where the
[47:06] trouble's at see we get this thing
[47:08] straighten out now one thing I find out
[47:10] in the church while is no not maybe uh
[47:13] three or four strangers with this just a
[47:15] little Tabernacle is one thing it's a
[47:17] lack of love for one another Among
[47:20] Us uh I I don't you know me well enough
[47:25] to know that when I know something's
[47:26] wrong
[47:27] I I'm going to come to you that's right
[47:30] because I'm Duty bound to God and it
[47:34] might have to hurt you but I'm going to
[47:35] tell you the truth see I'm going to tell
[47:38] you the truth so we can both get
[47:39] straighten out with God and go to the
[47:41] Bible said agree with th advies quickly
[47:43] don't let the Wrath son set on your
[47:45] wrath see now in order to be a a correct
[47:48] Pastor or Minister you've got to watch
[47:51] your congregation if you see the enemy
[47:53] coming in and slip that over here and
[47:54] say here just a minute see now that's
[47:56] wrong thing then you're watching the
[47:59] Bible said take heed to the flock to
[48:03] feed the flock which the Holy Ghost has
[48:05] made you overseer over now if you fail
[48:08] to do that God's going to make the
[48:09] answer for it that's right so that's
[48:12] what we want to do is that old the ones
[48:14] I had last night all right now I tried
[48:18] to answer each one but these these two
[48:20] here I'll get that this before we go
[48:22] into Sunday school so uh everyone of be
[48:26] answer I see do you believe that God
[48:30] gives the Holy Spirit to everyone that
[48:33] is truly born again
[48:37] Christian at the time they accept
[48:41] salvation or do you believe that uh this
[48:45] is a different work of Grace that in the
[48:49] experience of most Christians come later
[48:54] please um CL CL ify this subject as many
[49:00] are confused because of the differ
[49:03] teaching on this
[49:06] subject uh if I don't answer this
[49:09] correctly well then you ask me I I I I
[49:13] and put it on my Des for tonight and
[49:15] then I I'll get a hold of it now
[49:17] Christian friends a person cannot be
[49:21] borned again until they have received
[49:24] the Holy Spirit amen see you can you are
[49:29] not even converted until you receive the
[49:32] Holy Ghost I'm not say you're lost
[49:34] before you receive the Holy Ghost
[49:36] because you're not there is three there
[49:39] is one work of
[49:41] Grace only one work of Grace that's the
[49:44] Holy Spirit and it's made in three
[49:48] manifestations just like the one God
[49:52] made in three manifestation father son
[49:55] Holy Spirit one God
[49:57] amen only one now there's three works of
[50:01] Grace but three manifestations there's a
[50:03] manifestation of justification by faith
[50:06] a man believes God the yester I believe
[50:10] that I believe there's a true God and
[50:12] now and for my personal savior I accept
[50:15] Jesus Christ his son as my personal
[50:17] savior now that's what's called
[50:19] justification by faith which the
[50:21] disciples received first now the next
[50:24] thing is this man would go out and today
[50:27] he might Smoke Drink curse do things
[50:31] that his habits is hanging into him it's
[50:33] just rooted in there it's Spirits habits
[50:37] are spirits the Bible said there are
[50:39] unclean spirits in man now he want that
[50:42] maybe he's lustful excuse this we're a
[50:45] mixed audience but we're we're standing
[50:48] in the Judgment House of God and we must
[50:51] say these things clear for instance man
[50:54] sometimes especially man become
[50:57] lustful sex Maniacs not only that but
[51:01] just lustful way women dressed and
[51:04] things today no wonder they are but and
[51:07] but women becomes the same way lustful
[51:09] Spirits get on them and the nice little
[51:11] ladies and they put on Sharp clothes and
[51:14] little bitty things around them which
[51:16] looks terrible and they get out why they
[51:18] don't want to be bad but they don't
[51:20] realize that that Old passioned Demon
[51:22] spirit is working on them they don't do
[51:25] that to appear before God they do it not
[51:27] to be cool because pure science proves
[51:29] you that you take your clothes off the
[51:31] hot air on your body is more hotter to
[51:33] you than what it is when you got clothes
[51:35] on the Indian girl in in Arizona
[51:39] beautiful lot more than what you see one
[51:41] of these
[51:42] nudes and she don't only put on her
[51:45] clothes but a big blanket around her
[51:46] when she walks across the desert to keep
[51:48] cool and piration when the heat comes up
[51:51] that's it's the air conditioning see see
[51:54] so it's nothing in the world but a lust
[51:57] passion Spirit maybe you're lady enough
[51:59] not to do anything wrong to live untrue
[52:02] to your husband or to your own
[52:05] Mor but my sister that's disgraceful and
[52:09] you don't realize if you could look in
[52:11] God's looking Place year and find out
[52:13] what God said about that it's an evil
[52:15] spirit that's on you and you don't
[52:18] realize it Mary magdalina didn't realize
[52:21] the spirit that was on her see well now
[52:23] when you get that kind of spirit on you
[52:25] or man you get out here and start
[52:27] lusting for women it's a you say well
[52:31] it's human nature not like that no it's
[52:34] the spirit the Bible said it was the
[52:37] spirit that's right so the thing to do
[52:40] then the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[52:44] you from lust and passion amen called
[52:47] sanctification the word sanctification
[52:50] means to be cleaned and set aside for
[52:53] service you get one now that's lust
[52:56] Spirit leaves you under sanctification
[52:59] let a little lady nice goes to church
[53:02] she sings in a choir but she has to more
[53:05] grass with a little pair of sharks on
[53:07] let her get Sanctified one time and let
[53:09] her put on a
[53:12] pair let that man that'll almost have a
[53:14] wreck looking at that woman in the yard
[53:16] and let he get Sanctified one time and
[53:18] go down the street amen just keep his
[53:20] mind on what he's doing amen exactly
[53:23] right if he gazes sideways he'll turn
[53:25] his head this way the the holy spirit
[53:26] says turn your head amen amen there you
[53:30] are Hallelujah that's right that's
[53:33] sanctification hallu now in this person
[53:35] it's been called by God is
[53:37] manifestations of
[53:39] gifts now a very dear friend of mine in
[53:43] Denver the other day was discussing this
[53:45] with me we used to be here and preach in
[53:48] this city very fine man as far as I know
[53:52] but see he was a
[53:55] Nazarene and and he felt the
[53:57] sanctification was the baptism of the
[53:59] Holy Spirit which it is not there's no
[54:02] scripture to show that I Pro that a
[54:05] little bit in the Bible that it isn't
[54:07] you're not sealed by sanctification
[54:09] you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy
[54:12] Spirit a sealing is the completing of
[54:15] the work that's the reason it couldn't
[54:17] be sealed under Luther Wesley either one
[54:19] it had to come to the baptism before the
[54:21] church was sealed away till the day of
[54:23] redemption you see now but AR they're
[54:26] not lost they're saved certainly they
[54:29] are
[54:31] now
[54:32] sanctification is the same work of Grace
[54:35] or are the same Grace that saves you
[54:38] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[54:40] my father draws me amen so it's the holy
[54:43] spirit all along but that's a portion of
[54:46] the holy spirit this is a greater
[54:48] portion of the Holy Spirit and now when
[54:50] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[54:52] Ghost that is a completion of the Holy
[54:55] Spirit taking it's AB bold in you to
[54:58] manifest gifts speaking with tongues
[55:01] interpretation of tongues Gifts of power
[55:04] wisdom knowledge understanding man said
[55:08] last night said where did you get your
[55:11] education for these
[55:13] things well said I've come out of great
[55:16] seminaries and we've never had such as
[55:18] that ever taught in a seminary that I
[55:20] ever heard I said it don't come from
[55:22] Seminary I said I'm poor with a seventh
[55:26] grade education 10 15 years ago I
[55:29] couldn't hardly write my own name and I
[55:32] cannot do much better today but it comes
[55:34] through
[55:35] inspiration amen I said then watch it
[55:38] why he said you never watch what you're
[55:40] going in the Bible you just grab the
[55:41] thing and run on through the Bible it
[55:43] says it just all comes back together I
[55:45] said after I get out of the pull pit I
[55:47] couldn't tell you what I
[55:49] said not me I don't know see it's him
[55:53] putting it together I don't know hallu I
[55:56] can't tell you I just get up here and
[55:58] something strikes me and I just know the
[56:00] scriptures like that you might ask me
[56:01] the scripture hour later I wouldn't know
[56:03] see but it just comes like that and you
[56:06] watch and see if it's right or wrong
[56:08] when I get in the full I don't know what
[56:10] people are doing when they come to the
[56:11] prayer line what they've done in their
[56:12] life but watch it strike and tell them
[56:14] this is exactly what they've done in
[56:15] their life and what they ought to do to
[56:17] get saved is that right what they are to
[56:19] do to be healed and whether they're
[56:20] going to live or die how do I know that
[56:22] then ask me 10 minutes after out the
[56:24] platform I couldn't tell you what it
[56:25] said I don't know it's all that I
[56:28] haven't got anything to do with it I
[56:30] just yield myself to the Holy Spirit and
[56:32] he does the talking that is the whole
[56:35] thing amen that's right so it isn't I
[56:38] it's not me if you judge that I have the
[56:41] Holy Spirit then it's the Holy Spirit
[56:44] and if you judge that it isn't the Holy
[56:45] Spirit then you might think it was the
[56:47] devil but the thing of it is compare it
[56:49] with this and see what it Compares with
[56:52] the Holy Spirit wrote this so if it
[56:54] Compares with that and brings that out
[56:56] truth then it must be of God then isn't
[56:58] that right amen now no the Christian
[57:03] brother now look it's just in this
[57:06] manner I'll try not to take too much of
[57:08] our time on this look a new
[57:12] birth Jesus told Peter after he would
[57:15] been the apostles all of them they had
[57:17] been justified by Believing on the Lord
[57:19] Jesus Christ they've been Sanctified
[57:21] through the truth he was the truth and
[57:24] then he said and given power they went
[57:27] forth to preach the gospel the the UNG
[57:29] great gifts that was in him was being
[57:31] made temporarily or you know shallow
[57:34] away
[57:35] manifested but he said now the next
[57:37] thing you got to do is make this thing
[57:39] grow now he said Peter said Lord I'm
[57:42] willing to go to death and everything
[57:44] with you he said Peter after you are
[57:48] converted strengthen your
[57:51] brother after you're converted well Lord
[57:54] I've been baptized by you Jesus Christ
[57:56] baptized Peter he baptized uh the
[58:00] apostles all right now he said now I've
[58:03] been baptized that I've done all these
[58:05] things and I've walked by you I I I've
[58:08] been saved and you give me power you
[58:10] wouldn't expect God to put that power in
[58:12] an unclean vessel so he had to clean him
[58:15] up and give him a life of of sincerity
[58:18] anyhow before he he let him go out and
[58:20] preach the gospel and they return back
[58:22] rejoice and said but even the devils are
[58:24] subject to it see
[58:26] and why then he said now Peter I know
[58:29] all this but you're not converted yet
[58:32] see you're not right yet Peter you're
[58:34] not converted but after thou are
[58:37] converted then strengthen your brother
[58:39] Peter hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet
[58:42] see when the Holy Ghost come then Peter
[58:44] was an inspired teacher Jesus recognized
[58:47] it in last night's question you remember
[58:49] what he said come down and said Upon
[58:51] This Rock I'll build my church amen not
[58:53] upon Peter not upon the pope or upon
[58:56] that place or in that no not upon
[58:59] himself Jesus never put upon he been the
[59:02] Chief Cornerstone no he said Thou Art
[59:05] Peter and flesh and blood has not
[59:07] revealed this to you but my Father which
[59:09] is in heaven and up on this Rock Amen
[59:12] spiritual revealed Tru I'll be on my
[59:15] church that is not upon what the
[59:17] Seminary teaches not what the church
[59:18] teaches but what the spirit inspired
[59:22] teaching that comes into this Bible and
[59:25] Manifest this Bible to be true upon that
[59:28] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[59:30] Hell will not Prevail against it see
[59:32] what I mean now now a person can be
[59:37] look a mother's look this way now the
[59:40] little young ladies most of are out in
[59:42] the room out there and the young man
[59:44] we're all married folks I want to ask
[59:47] you
[59:48] something what is everything in the
[59:51] natural types the
[59:53] spiritual everything Mo mes made the
[59:56] pattern of the Tabernacle like he saw in
[59:58] heaven is that right amen everything in
[1:00:00] the natural tipes the spiritual now when
[1:00:03] a the St John the SEC uh I mean 1 John 5
[1:00:08] and 7 it said there a tree that bear
[1:00:12] record in heaven the Father the word
[1:00:15] which was the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:00:17] these three are one is that right so
[1:00:20] there's three that bear record in earth
[1:00:22] water blood spirit they are not one but
[1:00:26] they agree in one see now you can be
[1:00:30] justified without being Sanctified you
[1:00:32] believe that now you holding his people
[1:00:34] will agree with that all along see all
[1:00:36] right then when I tell you you can be
[1:00:38] Sanctified without receiving the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost you Pentecostal people are shout
[1:00:42] over that see because that's true you
[1:00:46] can it's just another step into the same
[1:00:49] Grace now you can be justified without
[1:00:52] being Sanctified you can be Sanctified
[1:00:53] without receiving the Holy Spirit I've
[1:00:55] brought that this week Through the Bible
[1:00:57] ages and everything and I could spend
[1:00:59] two years right here on the same thing
[1:01:01] and never leave the subject it's in the
[1:01:03] Bible we just merely touched the little
[1:01:05] points and things around here and there
[1:01:07] not even dug down in and got all the
[1:01:08] scriptures the Old Testament the
[1:01:10] prophets and everything and brought them
[1:01:11] right out the picture hour after hour in
[1:01:14] these cave up here Greens Mill and
[1:01:16] things has God reveal that
[1:01:19] him now look a
[1:01:22] friend now but you cannot have a father
[1:01:26] father without having the
[1:01:28] son you can't have the son without
[1:01:30] having the Holy Ghost see they are
[1:01:34] inseparable but water blood and spirit
[1:01:36] is separated although it's by the same
[1:01:39] Grace that they come now look when Jesus
[1:01:43] died at Calvary he produced
[1:01:47] exactly what it
[1:01:50] constitut to get into the body of Christ
[1:01:53] come out of the body of Christ amen when
[1:01:56] Jesus died what come out of his body now
[1:01:58] listen closely what come from his body
[1:02:02] first was water amen blood and spirit
[1:02:07] amen now when a baby is born in the
[1:02:10] Earth Mother Dad what's the first
[1:02:13] natural thing in a natural birth break
[1:02:16] water that right first
[1:02:20] laor pain the words are cutting the
[1:02:24] Sinners sitting there
[1:02:26] M does he mean that I have to quit
[1:02:30] doing well I have to get old pain and
[1:02:33] labor it takes death to bring forth life
[1:02:36] amen death life can only come through
[1:02:40] death so you say
[1:02:43] well yes that's right here you go all
[1:02:47] right I Repent of my sins I want to be
[1:02:50] baptized show to this congregation I
[1:02:53] believe in the death baral and
[1:02:54] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:56] Waters come
[1:02:57] forth what's the second thing in the
[1:02:59] natural birth blood is that right
[1:03:03] breaking of blood then the blood
[1:03:05] cleanses and takes all the unclean
[1:03:07] habits away from you sanctifies you get
[1:03:11] you fixed
[1:03:12] up all right that cleanses them all sin
[1:03:17] now you're set aside for
[1:03:19] Serv now what's the next thing to come
[1:03:21] out of the body of
[1:03:23] Christ spirit amen when the water comes
[1:03:27] the blood comes in a
[1:03:29] little posterior protoplasma
[1:03:32] stimulations added to the baby like that
[1:03:35] a little gospel spanking and he cries
[1:03:39] out God spirit is that
[1:03:42] right that's what the church needs
[1:03:45] sometime is just a little bit of gospel
[1:03:47] spanking like that down
[1:03:51] listen and then he say oh he CES as our
[1:03:54] father the spirit comes Bor out to him
[1:03:58] man he's born again of the spirit of God
[1:04:01] he's a Christian when he's
[1:04:03] begotten a baby's a baby when it's
[1:04:06] formed the very first germ in the
[1:04:08] mother's woms it's a baby I'm firmly
[1:04:11] against birth control see yes for just
[1:04:15] as much harm to to take the life of a
[1:04:18] little baby if it ain't two months old
[1:04:20] as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a
[1:04:22] man down in Cold Blood murder yes sir
[1:04:25] I'm against birth control what God sends
[1:04:28] God will take care
[1:04:30] of notice now that is wrong to do that
[1:04:34] now that's the baby right there it's a
[1:04:36] life for the first germ of life is in it
[1:04:39] which it'll only be the only life it'll
[1:04:40] in it let other Spirits in it then the
[1:04:43] baby becomes begotten it little muscles
[1:04:45] quiver and jump and twist like that then
[1:04:48] that's the next thing then the water
[1:04:49] blood then it has to get when it breaks
[1:04:51] its little lungs through just as the
[1:04:53] natural baby is born there a spiritual
[1:04:56] body at the side of the mother to give
[1:04:59] the baby a spiritual life and then when
[1:05:02] we're growing old here and we've been
[1:05:04] born again of the spirit year begotten
[1:05:07] in the wounds of the earth here when we
[1:05:09] lead this Earth this robe of Flesh I'll
[1:05:12] drop and rise and seize the Everlasting
[1:05:14] priz and Shout while passing through the
[1:05:17] air as long as in this earth here
[1:05:19] there's a born again Christian a spirit
[1:05:22] in here groaning and waiting if this
[1:05:24] Earthly Tabernacles is God we have one
[1:05:26] all that way when this when this natural
[1:05:31] was conceived and being brought forth
[1:05:34] when it was born it was a spiritual body
[1:05:36] to receive it and now as this natural
[1:05:38] body is dilling away there's a spiritual
[1:05:39] body to receive it when it goes away
[1:05:42] when it's begotten of the we are
[1:05:44] begotten of the father through the word
[1:05:47] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:05:50] and made new creatures in Christ Jesus
[1:05:53] so it's all one work of GRA
[1:05:56] but now look in the age Luther Wesley
[1:06:01] and all down to the Pentecostal age as I
[1:06:04] said I'm am not
[1:06:06] Pentecostal I believe in Pentecostal
[1:06:08] Doctrine many things is some things that
[1:06:10] I disagree in as I told you last night
[1:06:13] some things I I disagree prly in the
[1:06:17] initial evidence of what they call you
[1:06:20] have to speak with tongues to prove that
[1:06:23] you've got the holy ghost that can not
[1:06:26] be scripturally
[1:06:28] proven that is just let your pastor come
[1:06:31] to me see that's right and I even from
[1:06:34] the highest the do Pope and all those
[1:06:37] others we've come together even the head
[1:06:39] of the Assemblies of God one of the
[1:06:41] greatest and speaking in tongu for
[1:06:42] evidence and Dr Pope reached across the
[1:06:45] table him and eared and them and took
[1:06:46] hold my hand said brother Brandon that
[1:06:48] is the truth but what are we going to do
[1:06:50] about it now if we fail to do that then
[1:06:52] the people go off just like Pilgrim
[1:06:54] Holiness and so forth I said no they
[1:06:56] want you just lay it out like the Bible
[1:06:58] says they let God add to the church let
[1:07:03] God give to the church see those gifts
[1:07:05] are in the church right in here this
[1:07:07] morning there's Gifts of speaking in
[1:07:08] tongues there's Gifts of Prophecy
[1:07:10] there's Gifts of everything setting in
[1:07:11] your but if you just not go to hanging
[1:07:13] at that gift if you do you're going to
[1:07:15] get the gift without the giver see the
[1:07:18] thing of it is seek after God seek after
[1:07:22] the love of God in your heart and that
[1:07:24] is God wants you he'll move you into
[1:07:27] whatever he wants you to do see that's
[1:07:29] it that's how the church is putting
[1:07:31] order now now in that and this here
[1:07:35] remember that when you are justified by
[1:07:38] faith I hope that explains the SC now
[1:07:41] you are a Christian right then when you
[1:07:45] accept Jesus as your personal savior you
[1:07:48] are a Christian at that time that's
[1:07:51] right I believe if you would die right
[1:07:54] then when you accept Jesus as savior I
[1:07:56] believe you'd be saved that's what the
[1:07:59] dying priest did on the cross and that's
[1:08:01] what others that's what the scripture
[1:08:03] says Jus say he that Hearth my words and
[1:08:04] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:08:06] everlasting life see I believe you are a
[1:08:09] Christian name now I I can't judge where
[1:08:13] you are not God knows whether you are
[1:08:15] not see that's your heart I was I wasn't
[1:08:19] sent or no other man to judge we were
[1:08:21] only sent to preach see now you're a
[1:08:23] Christian when you accept Jesus
[1:08:25] and when the blood of Jesus Christ is
[1:08:27] applied to you your sins are your habits
[1:08:31] and fth of this world that you wed in is
[1:08:34] gone from you smoking drinking gambling
[1:08:38] all these uh unclean habits Leave You by
[1:08:41] sanctification and then the Holy Spirit
[1:08:43] comes in and anoints you and put you in
[1:08:47] service to do something for him now that
[1:08:52] is them now in the next then the next
[1:08:55] thing is to do is uh then you're born
[1:08:59] again when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:09:02] that's when you're converted you might
[1:09:04] be in process of conversion but you're
[1:09:06] not converted until it's completed and
[1:09:08] you're sealed into the kingdom of God
[1:09:11] Amen heal down just like if I start
[1:09:13] loading a box car out here well I throw
[1:09:15] some tans in I throw some clouds in I
[1:09:18] throw some more things in I say is it
[1:09:19] ready the inspector come by NOP not yet
[1:09:22] but the Box Car sitting right there on
[1:09:24] its road to its Des Nation but as soon
[1:09:26] as I get the whole thing loaded up
[1:09:29] sealed in packed in right then the doors
[1:09:31] are Slam by the inspector and is
[1:09:34] sealed there you are and she's ready
[1:09:37] she's sealed and gone that's right Jesus
[1:09:40] said blessed are ye when you hunger and
[1:09:42] thirst after righteousness for you shall
[1:09:45] be filled amen now there's another
[1:09:51] question last night you spoke of your
[1:09:54] belief in the gift of the spirit you
[1:09:57] mentioned that you yourself had spoken
[1:10:00] in tongues do you believe that the
[1:10:04] program
[1:10:05] including sermons should yield to the
[1:10:09] spirit when it is trying to bring forth
[1:10:12] a message in
[1:10:15] tongues now I answered that to an extent
[1:10:19] last night now I will finish it this
[1:10:23] morning now
[1:10:27] speaking in tongues is a gift of God but
[1:10:31] it's subject to what's on the floor is
[1:10:34] the first place now there Christian
[1:10:38] there's where you make your
[1:10:40] mistake now I don't know someone told me
[1:10:43] that Monday night or Tuesday night when
[1:10:45] I was preaching if somebody spoke in
[1:10:47] tongues while I was preaching it's a
[1:10:49] good thing I didn't hear it or I'd have
[1:10:51] stopped and called you out right there
[1:10:54] CU you was out of AR
[1:10:56] the Holy Spirit if I'm anointed of God
[1:10:59] speaking by the Holy Spirit he's
[1:11:01] speaking here he don't speak over here
[1:11:03] and over here and over here a confusion
[1:11:06] the Bible says that Christian see so
[1:11:09] that's right we must get those things
[1:11:11] down in our heart everything has to come
[1:11:14] in a season speaking in tongues is give
[1:11:17] away to a place for speaking in tongu
[1:11:20] see and then if if someone speaks in
[1:11:23] tongues now I ain't saying the person
[1:11:25] was wrong I don't say the person was
[1:11:28] demon possessed I believe the person was
[1:11:31] sincere I believe the person if they
[1:11:34] could speak with tongues they're blessed
[1:11:36] of God but the person it's just like
[1:11:39] brother neille standing here trying to
[1:11:40] sing a song maybe he's gifted to sing a
[1:11:43] song and he's here singing a song me
[1:11:45] saying you're trying to preach right in
[1:11:47] your face in him singing a song well
[1:11:49] that's not order if the holy spirit's in
[1:11:52] the singing Let the singing go on see if
[1:11:55] uh then if I Sor start preaching and he
[1:11:57] raises up and and starts to sing a song
[1:12:00] while I'm preaching that's out of harder
[1:12:03] the holy spirit is not an author of
[1:12:07] confusion that's right so get that
[1:12:09] church you're a lovely people see but
[1:12:13] you're all in
[1:12:14] eror now if you've got a gift use a gift
[1:12:17] where the gift belongs if I got a pick
[1:12:20] and shovel I certainly wouldn't try to
[1:12:21] hold my tomatoes with it no see I use
[1:12:26] the pick and shovel when I'm picking or
[1:12:28] digging a ditch I wouldn't try to drive
[1:12:30] my automobile through the corn field see
[1:12:34] I use the automobile to travel back and
[1:12:36] forth and I use my plow in the corn Fel
[1:12:39] so I ain't got nothing against the plow
[1:12:41] I haven't got nothing against the
[1:12:42] automobile they both are instruments to
[1:12:44] the Ure for EMB betterment of mankind I
[1:12:48] haven't got nothing in speaking in
[1:12:49] tongues I haven't got nothing against
[1:12:50] preaching against singing against
[1:12:52] interpretation tongues against Gifts of
[1:12:54] healing but it's all to be used in his
[1:12:56] place oh please
[1:12:59] church have faith just a little while
[1:13:02] see you must come under teachings you
[1:13:05] see I don't need no one to teach me if
[1:13:07] the Holy Ghost has come my friends that
[1:13:10] that gives me just a little room to
[1:13:12] doubt whether you've really got it or
[1:13:13] not see see the way you're acting with
[1:13:16] it see see the same you're doing now why
[1:13:21] if there is no if the Bible said the a
[1:13:23] holy spirit is the teacher why did the
[1:13:26] Holy Spirit put teachers in the church
[1:13:28] stand to set the church in office the
[1:13:30] same Holy Spirit sure we don't need any
[1:13:33] seminaries to go around a big bunch of
[1:13:35] man to look out these things the holy
[1:13:37] spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher
[1:13:40] and it gives us some fell a gift of
[1:13:42] teaching then you must be subject to
[1:13:44] that gift if here some man to when we're
[1:13:48] going here and he's got a gift of
[1:13:50] healing Faith and Healing and I'm sick I
[1:13:53] walk up to him and say brother what must
[1:13:55] I do he stands there he's a prophet and
[1:13:58] he stands there with a gift he said thus
[1:14:01] sayith the Lord William Brandon you know
[1:14:04] you done a certain thing day before
[1:14:06] yesterday in a certain place and that's
[1:14:08] the reason you're sick today because you
[1:14:10] did something I'm subject to that gift I
[1:14:12] ain't going to say oh you're wrong I
[1:14:15] don't care what you say I know who I am
[1:14:17] not I'll die in that condition see I've
[1:14:22] done something wrong now the things me
[1:14:24] do when I see that I'm wrong I say yes
[1:14:27] my dear brother the holy spirit's upon
[1:14:30] me and that's the truth I did wrong you
[1:14:34] pray for me and I'm going to ask God to
[1:14:36] forgive me so that I can be right with
[1:14:38] God now you're getting back on the heing
[1:14:41] life then I say yes I'll go back and
[1:14:44] make that right if I cheated this
[1:14:45] brother if I talk wrong to that brother
[1:14:47] or sister there I'm going over to make
[1:14:49] it right you're the Holy Spirit going to
[1:14:50] reveal it to me then I go over and make
[1:14:52] that right say I'm sorry brother I was
[1:14:54] in the wrong watch me get well that's
[1:14:57] right but if I puff myself up and say oh
[1:15:00] I know as much about it uhuh you must
[1:15:02] listen to the Holy Spirit see he's the
[1:15:04] teacher and the guide of the church see
[1:15:07] now the holy spirit that now the Bible
[1:15:10] says that if uh in that that the spirit
[1:15:14] of the Prophet the one now a man who
[1:15:17] speaks with tongues is
[1:15:19] prophesying you know that certainly now
[1:15:22] if a man speaks with tongues and the
[1:15:24] prophet is preaching from the platform
[1:15:26] then that spirit is subject to this
[1:15:29] Spirit if brother nille was standing
[1:15:31] here preaching and he's under the
[1:15:33] inspiration of God and he's making an
[1:15:35] over call or whatever he's doing as long
[1:15:37] as he's in this pull pit and his voice
[1:15:39] isn't moving he's under the inspiration
[1:15:41] of God or should be and then if he does
[1:15:44] then when he gets finished and he's sat
[1:15:46] down then if the spirit falls into the
[1:15:48] meeting you say well brother brand it
[1:15:50] fell on me in the beginning I know that
[1:15:52] is true it isn't the spirit falling on
[1:15:55] you brother the spirit or sister whoever
[1:15:57] you are the spirit is subject to the
[1:16:01] word of God because Paul said if an
[1:16:03] angel come and taught anything different
[1:16:05] let it be at purse this every holy
[1:16:08] spirit will recognize this word of God
[1:16:10] to be true is that right but now some
[1:16:13] people sometimes people have gifts and
[1:16:16] the gift will speak for oh my it's a
[1:16:18] it's a gift of God and it wants to go
[1:16:21] forth and do something it's Inus but
[1:16:24] it's got to come under subject of the
[1:16:26] Holy Spirit see it's a gift therefore
[1:16:30] don't you see where you see tongues is
[1:16:32] not the only evidence tongues as a gift
[1:16:37] see the Holy Spirit has to operate that
[1:16:41] now Paul said if a man speaks with
[1:16:43] tongues in the church and there be no
[1:16:45] interpreter let him hold his peace no
[1:16:48] matter how much he wants to speak how
[1:16:51] much is crying out in the feet that's
[1:16:53] the gift
[1:16:55] see what I mean that's the gift here I I
[1:16:58] sit many times with the gift that the
[1:17:01] Holy Spirit has given me to pray for the
[1:17:03] sick I see a time you said oh there's
[1:17:05] some poor little fell I must pray for
[1:17:07] him my heart just yield for him and the
[1:17:08] Holy Spirit said leave him Al and go
[1:17:10] over here to this one I come in a
[1:17:12] meeting I sit there and there's a poor
[1:17:14] old mother laying there with all
[1:17:16] crippled up Ling there shaking like a oh
[1:17:18] God that poor L she looks up and say
[1:17:20] brother brandom please have mercy on me
[1:17:22] oh how my heart beats for that poor
[1:17:24] little thing M and your that's a lady
[1:17:26] over here maybe was female trouble the
[1:17:28] angel will never touch that woman land
[1:17:29] there go here this lady the female
[1:17:31] trouble and say th sayith the Lord your
[1:17:33] healed amen now me my gift I want to get
[1:17:36] to that woman there but the Holy Spirit
[1:17:38] just go over here see what I mean Philip
[1:17:41] was down there a Revival just having a
[1:17:42] wonderful time thousands being converted
[1:17:45] and everything but the Holy Spirit comes
[1:17:46] to go out the gates into the desert he's
[1:17:48] going to be a color man pass through
[1:17:49] after a while am give him the message
[1:17:52] and he never returns you see what I mean
[1:17:55] yes Jesus passed through you he was God
[1:17:58] and he passed through this F of the all
[1:18:00] these cripples and blinds and lames and
[1:18:02] Halt and wer was laying there how his
[1:18:04] poor heart must have burned for that
[1:18:05] poor mother with a Waterhead baby that
[1:18:07] poor old Dy stand there blind saying
[1:18:09] somebody help me and here come the very
[1:18:11] God of creation moving by and flesh
[1:18:13] coming by him walked right on by him
[1:18:16] watch what he did walked over to a man
[1:18:18] that maybe had ptic trouble or something
[1:18:21] he had 38 years he could get up and walk
[1:18:23] and go where he wanted to he said when
[1:18:25] I'm coming to the pool another can rout
[1:18:27] run me and get down there see when I'm
[1:18:29] coming to the pool Jesus said will thou
[1:18:31] be made whole said take up that bed and
[1:18:33] go into the house heal that one man
[1:18:35] which could walk around and was in
[1:18:37] pretty good of Health he got around for
[1:18:38] 38 years with it but he was laying that
[1:18:41] prent maybe one time he could jump into
[1:18:43] the pool and he had all this disease and
[1:18:45] I had it for 38 years and there was
[1:18:47] people dying laying there sure Jesus
[1:18:49] wanted to go to them but the Holy Spirit
[1:18:51] led him there for the Bible said that he
[1:18:53] knew the man was a there next
[1:18:55] amen see no matter what the what the
[1:18:57] gift says it's got to yield to the
[1:18:59] spirit that's why Paul said that the
[1:19:02] gifts out in there and our congregation
[1:19:04] will yield to the prophet see you got to
[1:19:07] yield to the order that's it it's the
[1:19:10] gift I hope that explains it there's
[1:19:14] where the Pentecostal Church gets tied
[1:19:16] up many times many of in order that's
[1:19:19] what cause trouble in the brand
[1:19:21] Tabernacle see it's because you people
[1:19:23] with your gift don't know how to use
[1:19:25] that and that's the reason you need
[1:19:27] Bible teaching to know how to use that
[1:19:29] gift to get the best out of it for the
[1:19:31] kingdom of God's
[1:19:32] say speaking in tongues I wish every one
[1:19:35] of you spoke with tongues I wish the
[1:19:38] interpretation of tongues was every one
[1:19:39] of you but you couldn't do it the same
[1:19:41] time you've got to yield to the order of
[1:19:44] the spirit when the spirit is Anointed a
[1:19:47] brother here preaching he say you're
[1:19:49] preaching the gospel like that then let
[1:19:50] your gift yield to that spirit because
[1:19:53] just like I said last night you know uh
[1:19:56] now a lot of people did not speaking in
[1:19:58] Tong they said the devil and you good
[1:20:02] nazarine people your own church status
[1:20:04] word back flip exactly when the light of
[1:20:07] speaking in tongues and the gifts of the
[1:20:09] Spirit come you deny in a person in a
[1:20:11] nazarine church you know how they feel
[1:20:14] if you speak in tongues you're a
[1:20:16] devil I know a woman today that was just
[1:20:19] revealed to me last night a little woman
[1:20:21] in New Or that's real real bad and sense
[1:20:24] an morning been striking me she come to
[1:20:26] my house and the Holy Spirit told her
[1:20:27] exactly what was wrong told her all
[1:20:30] about some horrible sinful things she
[1:20:32] did and pronounced her healing and the
[1:20:34] woman went away and got with a bunch of
[1:20:36] methodists and Nazarene preachers that
[1:20:38] believes that anybody speaks with tongu
[1:20:39] is got is a devil and the woman bleeds
[1:20:42] that and she's blaspheming and she'll
[1:20:44] never get over until she comes and
[1:20:47] receives the Holy
[1:20:48] Ghost you can't mistreat
[1:20:51] God be careful what you're doing if one
[1:20:53] word against that will seal you out of
[1:20:55] the kingdom of God
[1:20:57] forever now if you believe me to be his
[1:20:59] servant if you think God is with me and
[1:21:01] helping me and in my words in according
[1:21:03] to the Bible then you correct me but if
[1:21:05] they are according to the Bible and you
[1:21:07] believe me to be his servant you better
[1:21:08] take heed and listen that's true so then
[1:21:12] here my hands is used for a certain
[1:21:14] purpose but I've got to go to that bu
[1:21:16] that place there to use them there's no
[1:21:18] need of my hands fighting at that now
[1:21:20] when my Feet's trying to take me over
[1:21:21] there just like a man preaching he's pre
[1:21:24] preaching or now it's time for speaking
[1:21:26] in tongues and this this hand or
[1:21:28] speaking in tongues wants to get to it
[1:21:29] see but don't claw the air wait till my
[1:21:32] feet gets me over there then I can reach
[1:21:34] over to there see now when a man
[1:21:37] speaking or preaching up here at the
[1:21:38] platform or a message going forth if the
[1:21:41] man is of god he's anointed of the
[1:21:43] spirit to preach the word and that's the
[1:21:45] Holy Spirit the holy spirit's moving
[1:21:47] that that's just your gift there trying
[1:21:48] to get you started but the holy spirit's
[1:21:51] coming through the word and the Holy
[1:21:53] Spirit will always the Holy Spirit feeds
[1:21:56] on the word of
[1:21:58] God right and It'll recognize the word
[1:22:01] and be rever and then when a time comes
[1:22:03] when the holy spirit's left the platform
[1:22:05] off the minister comes out in there then
[1:22:07] you're in order then somebody give up
[1:22:10] maybe has has a messages speaking in
[1:22:12] tongu then he gives interpretation to it
[1:22:15] then watch it it won't be quoting
[1:22:16] scripture it won't be saying something
[1:22:18] God don't use repetition see It'll stand
[1:22:21] up and say thus sayith the Lord Mr
[1:22:24] brother S and S is laying here sick what
[1:22:27] done it was day before yesterday
[1:22:28] sometime he done a certain thing got out
[1:22:30] of the will of God on that thus sayith
[1:22:32] the Lord now that'll interpretate that's
[1:22:36] for the the Holy Spirit only speaks to
[1:22:38] edify the church if you speak with
[1:22:40] tongues with no correctly interpretation
[1:22:42] don't do it in the church do it at home
[1:22:44] that's what the Bible say then and if if
[1:22:47] that's true then the spirit of God's up
[1:22:50] you maybe you'll speak and say all you
[1:22:51] move from this section of this city
[1:22:53] tomorrow there's coming a sideone
[1:22:55] that'll sweep all this section out now
[1:22:57] before that can be remember speaking and
[1:23:00] sound is not too
[1:23:01] accurate Paul said Let It Be first
[1:23:04] judged by two or three
[1:23:05] witnesses that two or three was divine
[1:23:10] judgment judges what with the Holy
[1:23:13] Spirit Level sound and Doctrine I
[1:23:16] believe God was in that the next raised
[1:23:19] up said God was in that got to had one
[1:23:22] more one more raised up said God was in
[1:23:24] that then let what part of the church is
[1:23:26] in this section flee as hard as he can
[1:23:28] get out of there if tomorrow the storm
[1:23:31] comes through and blows it up no God is
[1:23:33] with you but if it doesn't do it you
[1:23:36] better be careful you got the wrong
[1:23:37] Spirit among
[1:23:38] you you better get back up the Altar and
[1:23:41] get this thing prayed out all the church
[1:23:42] together and that poor person spok in
[1:23:44] Tong ought to come around the Altar and
[1:23:45] say Lord somebody help me I don't want
[1:23:47] to be Anointed with that that's wrong
[1:23:50] see so Lord help me get the thing off of
[1:23:52] me let me get right with you see what I
[1:23:55] mean so be careful church do you
[1:23:58] understand if you do say amen amen if
[1:24:01] you do now that's true Bible teaching
[1:24:05] amen now it won't now you hear a lot of
[1:24:07] times come up and say oh the Lord is
[1:24:09] coming soon Jesus is coming and uh and
[1:24:13] the people must be ready or something
[1:24:15] like that sure the Lord's wrote that in
[1:24:16] the Bible if it come it'll come right
[1:24:17] through the prophet coming out through
[1:24:19] right that but it's for the edifying of
[1:24:22] the
[1:24:23] church see the edifying of a church it's
[1:24:26] a direct message everybody's heard that
[1:24:28] message but if say this man here if
[1:24:31] yesterday he was untr to his marriage
[1:24:33] vow and the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:24:35] condemns him this morning that's
[1:24:36] something the church don't know that's
[1:24:38] right see it condemns that man he stands
[1:24:41] and says that's the truth God forgive me
[1:24:44] then God's with you see what I mean then
[1:24:46] you won't all be confused you've got
[1:24:48] those gifts now here's the last
[1:24:50] quotation of it listen friend listen all
[1:24:53] the this
[1:24:55] you had those gifts you didn't deserve
[1:24:58] them God given them to you before the
[1:25:00] foundation of the world still yours when
[1:25:04] you was born in this world you was born
[1:25:05] with him felt that gift which is within
[1:25:08] you see you're born with those things
[1:25:11] you can't make yourself do something I
[1:25:13] couldn't make my eyes brown because
[1:25:14] they're blue amen who taking thought can
[1:25:16] add one toic to his statue it's all in
[1:25:19] God's Divine
[1:25:20] program if I tried to be a s any what
[1:25:23] good would it do me
[1:25:24] can amen God had a sany inin I'm William
[1:25:27] Brandon you're whoever you are now look
[1:25:31] if you will take those gifts that you
[1:25:33] have and use them correctly and orderly
[1:25:37] in the church this little church will
[1:25:39] grow like everything but when you get in
[1:25:42] yourself in the flesh you'll keep it
[1:25:44] tore up as long as the church stands
[1:25:46] here exactly right now have I made it
[1:25:49] clear I hope so if I haven't and if
[1:25:52] there's one question that hasn't been
[1:25:53] answered you let know and I'll be glad
[1:25:55] to do it well that's a long time and you
[1:25:58] know I've got I got a long time I hope
[1:26:01] to stay here in this world and I know

[1:26:09] thing correctly Brotherly Love

[1:26:14] that now do you think we are to dismiss
