[21:00] saved tonight amen praise the Lord God
[21:04] bless you we're going to go into this
[21:05] message tonight that we started I think
[21:08] it was on a two Wednesdays ago on the
[21:10] 9th there Revelations chapter
[21:13] 4 and uh brother brandham reads the
[21:17] scripture it's a lengthy tape we're only
[21:20] going to play a portion a second portion
[21:23] of it but let's get a context as he read
[21:26] in the scriptures if you turn with me to
[21:28] revelation chapter
[21:31] 4 this is after the church age the
[21:34] church ages the church is raptured up
[21:37] and the Book of Revelations is a book of
[21:40] symbols it's literal it's symbols it's
[21:43] types and shadows and it
[21:46] requires the seventh angel to reveal
[21:50] those Mysteries and so Revelations
[21:53] chapter 4 brother random goes into this
[21:56] he actually goes back into Exodus and
[21:59] Leviticus and bring some of these things
[22:01] out but we'll just take from verse
[22:03] number one it says after this I looked
[22:06] and behold a door was open in heaven and
[22:10] the first voice which I heard was as it
[22:13] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[22:16] said come up hither and I will show thee
[22:20] things I will show thee things which
[22:22] must be Hereafter and immediately I was
[22:26] in the spirit and behold a throne was
[22:29] set in heaven and one sat on the
[22:32] throne he that sat was to look upon like
[22:36] Jasper and sardine stone and there was a
[22:39] rainbow around about the throne and the
[22:43] sight like unto an emerald and round
[22:46] about The Throne were 4 and 20 seats and
[22:49] upon the seats I saw four and 20 Elders
[22:52] sitting clothed in white rment and they
[22:55] had on their heads crowns of gold and
[22:58] out of of the throne preceded Lightnings
[23:01] and thunderings and voices and there
[23:04] were seven lamps of fire burning Before
[23:08] the Throne which are the seven spirits
[23:11] of God so brother Adam goes into that a
[23:13] little bit on that first part so we're
[23:16] just going to back the tape up just a
[23:18] bit to paragraph whatever paragraph I
[23:21] gave them there just to get a little bit
[23:23] of the context and then we'll take about
[23:27] an hour or so
[23:29] and let the prophet talk about these
[23:32] voices so let's get into uh this message
[23:35] how many's looking forward to hear what
[23:36] God has to say from his word amen let's
[23:40] sing that old Hymn of the church to

[30:43] the throne shining out in each Church
[30:48] age this church age is reflecting back
[30:51] this
[30:52] away the voices of God Jesus Christ the
[30:56] same yesterday today and
[30:59] forever see seven there was voices and
[31:04] seven lamps on
[31:07] fire Hallelujah seven spirits which are
[31:11] the seven spirits of God remember a
[31:15] couple Sundays ago we got to it the big
[31:17] diamond but it's cut in many different
[31:20] ways to reflect the fire and lights from
[31:23] it that's way Jesus Christ is the
[31:26] beginning of of the creation of God
[31:30] Revelations
[31:31] 1 that right then R was God
[31:36] created he is the beginning of the
[31:40] creation of God and God is eternal is
[31:44] that right but when God was created when
[31:47] a little baby that was conceived in the
[31:51] womb of a mother a virgin and she began
[31:55] to develop these cells with within her
[31:58] to bring forth this little baby that was
[32:01] the beginning of God's creation for God
[32:06] was made flesh and dwell Among Us and
[32:07] become
[32:09] Emmanuel God With Us the beginning of
[32:12] the creation of God than in that great
[32:16] Jewel that come from the dust because he
[32:18] was made of dust is that right eat food
[32:22] like I do eat food like you do which
[32:25] dust of the body he become Calum poish
[32:28] petroleum Cosmic light but in him
[32:31] dwelt Eternal Light amen no wonder of
[32:36] the wise man said to the star guide us
[32:39] to thy perfect
[32:41] life they were just reflecting the light
[32:44] of one Perfect Light and there he was a
[32:47] perfect light of God beginning of the
[32:51] creation of God now in there was he how
[32:56] did he be able to reflect himself back
[32:58] to the stars of the earth as the wise
[33:01] men saw them in heaven and they become
[33:03] ministering Spirits here on the earth he
[33:05] was wounded the big diamond cut off for
[33:08] our transgressions bruised for our
[33:12] iniquity the chasti with our peace upon
[33:15] him with his stripes we were healed what
[33:18] was it doing
[33:19] reflecting any man that claims to be a
[33:23] servant of God that denies Divine
[33:26] Healing and his power

[39:35] pneumatics of the Bible is the most
[39:36] perfect thing there is on Earth you
[39:39] can't get one flaw from Genesis or
[39:42] revelations in the pneumatics of the
[39:43] Bible not another piece of literature
[39:45] written that you can't find a flaw for
[39:47] you read three verses but not in the
[39:49] Bible they've been trying for over 200
[39:52] years to add one phrase to the Lord's
[39:54] Prayer or take one away from it it's
[39:57] perfect
[39:58] can't add no more or take any more from
[40:00] it they've been think they make the
[40:02] prayer a little bit better they try to
[40:03] comb this into it and put that into it
[40:05] or take this out of it it just ain't
[40:06] right see it's perfect all of God's ways
[40:10] is perfect therefore we are
[40:13] imperfect but he said be ye therefore
[40:16] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[40:18] perfect how can we be through the
[40:20] precious blood of Jesus Christ we forget
[40:23] our own selves and just live in him amen
[40:26] there you are how how precious is it all
[40:29] right the sixth verse now if we get into
[40:32] it seven lanes and Before the Throne was
[40:36] a sea of glass liken a crystal and in
[40:39] the midst of the throne and around about
[40:41] The Throne were four Beast full of
[40:44] eyes before and
[40:48] behind oh my look at
[40:51] this Beast full of eyes full of eyes
[40:55] before and now wait
[40:58] Before the Throne was a sea of glass
[41:01] like into Crystal and in the midst of
[41:04] the throne were four and around the
[41:07] throne were four beasts full of eyes
[41:10] before and behind now the sea of
[41:14] glass you just go to this a't very much
[41:16] of a stle here but I W to erase this for
[41:19] a minute now
[41:27] now we want to study here just a little
[41:29] bit the sea of glass is symbolized in
[41:34] the old Temple where Moses was commanded
[41:37] of God to build the temple on earth like
[41:42] he saw it in the heavens everyone knows
[41:44] that all right and let me draw a little
[41:48] bit here now say here was the
[41:51] ark in the Old Testament all right the
[41:55] next thing that was called holy of Holly
[41:59] and the next place here was the altar
[42:01] which was called holy place and right
[42:05] before here was the Sea of brass it's
[42:10] called in other words it was a place
[42:12] where the
[42:17] sacrifice sacrifices was
[42:20] washed was wash here before they was
[42:23] received on the altar at the brass altar
[42:26] brazing altar the sacrifice is burned
[42:29] now we want to watch this now where the
[42:33] where now now in this sea of
[42:38] glass was before the throne and before
[42:43] the holy place just I remember the seven
[42:47] golden candles stick set
[42:49] here like this comeing a l see now
[42:53] that's one reflects the light from the
[42:54] holy place out to here now if you you
[42:57] don't have to write this unless you just
[42:58] want to but that's I got something else
[43:00] here I draw out myself that I wanted to
[43:02] get to you on but now you see this was
[43:05] called the sepr it wasn't quite that big
[43:07] it was set over more or less positioning
[43:09] in the temple it was set along about
[43:11] like this here was a sea of brass it was
[43:15] a Laver made out of brass where they
[43:17] wash the sacrifices before the
[43:20] sacrifices was burned or accepted they
[43:22] had to be
[43:24] washed oh wouldn't that make a
[43:30] sermon wasn't that wouldn't that just
[43:32] just
[43:35] was before any sacrifice is received to
[43:40] God it's first got to be
[43:43] washed how not emotionally but Washed by
[43:48] the word now we can go back and get word
[43:50] this Jewish
[43:52] rabbi when I preaching on that sermon of
[43:55] the Waters of Separation The Red for
[43:57] Waters kept up that they were made of
[43:59] waters of separation and before we can
[44:04] every come to God with true
[44:08] faith we first got to come By the Waters
[44:11] of
[44:13] Separation yes you got to come to what
[44:17] the
[44:18] word oh let me just see if I can talk
[44:21] this so you everyone will get it now put
[44:25] on your SP
[44:28] spiritual
[44:31] thinking take off the war bom and put on
[44:35] your spiritual thinking now cause here
[44:37] comes something
[44:40] washed before it can be received at the
[44:44] altar must first be washed By the Waters
[44:50] of
[44:50] Separation now turn with me right quick
[44:53] to Ephesians 5 just hold your place and
[44:56] go back just a few pages back to
[44:59] Ephesians the 5th chapter and the
[45:04] 26
[45:08] verse that he
[45:10] might sanctify and cleanse it the church
[45:14] he speaking
[45:15] of see now let me go back a little
[45:17] farther than that go back about the 20
[45:21] first verse while you're
[45:23] looking submit yourselves one to another
[45:26] in in the fear of
[45:29] God submit yourself congregation submit
[45:33] yourself to your pastor Pastor submit
[45:36] yourself to your
[45:38] congregation if a little click Rises up
[45:40] don't be on either side submit yourself
[45:42] to the whole
[45:44] congregation congregation if you
[45:45] starting to click submit yourself to
[45:47] your pastor in the fear of God see oh
[45:52] brother wi submit yourselves into your
[45:55] own husband as unto the
[46:00] Lord because he is your
[46:03] lord how many knows that you women
[46:06] exactly
[46:07] right the Bible said so at the beginning
[46:10] still the same way why submit yourself
[46:13] unto your own husband as unto the Lord
[46:17] for the husband is the head of the wife
[46:20] even as Christ is the head of the church
[46:24] and he is the savior of of the body so
[46:29] as a husband you unold that you married
[46:31] people and adult or children is old
[46:35] enough to know the way of life all right
[46:38] as unto the Lord for the husband is the
[46:40] head of the wife even as Christ is the
[46:43] head of the church and he is the savior
[46:45] of the body therefore as the church is
[46:48] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[46:52] to their own husbands in everything
[46:57] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[46:59] also loved the church and gave himself
[47:03] for it amen don't run
[47:05] over you do that you're not fit to be a
[47:08] husband that's
[47:10] right that he might listen here it is
[47:14] get it now that he might sanctify and
[47:18] cleanse it with the washing of the Water
[47:22] by
[47:24] [Music]
[47:25] theise the Lord and every worshiper that
[47:29] ever gains access into this has to come
[47:33] by the
[47:36] words there's too many comes
[47:39] otherwise I believe in little stories
[47:41] and things that my mother died long
[47:44] years ago and she's waiting for you in
[47:45] heaven that does all right after the
[47:49] word has been applied many people come
[47:52] to the altar because want to meet their
[47:53] mother in heaven that's all right you
[47:55] should do that but that's not the reason
[47:58] that you come to the altar you come to
[48:01] the altar confessing your sins because
[48:03] Christ died in your stead amen by the
[48:07] word then any sacrifice do not come
[48:10] according to the word is unaccepted then
[48:12] is that right oh brother I hate to say
[48:15] this I hate to say it forgive me for
[48:17] saying it that's the reason acts 19
[48:20] stands in the Bible amen have you
[48:23] received the Holy Ghost since you
[48:25] believe they said we not worth He said
[48:27] and how was you
[48:29] [Music]
[48:31] baptized why Ain you got into
[48:35] here they come some other way besides
[48:38] the word so all we went through the form
[48:41] of was baptized John said that won't
[48:45] work John only baptized into repentance
[48:48] not for remission of
[48:49] sins and when they heard this they were
[48:52] re baptized Why by the word amen washed
[48:57] By the Waters of the word the word said
[49:01] the name of Jesus
[49:03] Christ Hallelujah anything that attacks
[49:06] anything else onto that is
[49:08] false now my precious brother I know
[49:11] this is a tape also now don't get
[49:14] excited let me say this with Godly
[49:18] love the hours approach where I can't
[49:20] hold still on these things no more too
[49:23] close to coming see
[49:27] trinitarianism is of the
[49:29] devil I say that thus sayith the Lord
[49:34] am look where it come
[49:37] from it come from the Ning
[49:40] Council when the Catholic Church BEC in
[49:44] rulership the word Trinity is not even
[49:46] mentioned in the entire book of the
[49:50] Bible and as far as three Gods that's
[49:54] from Hell there's one God
[49:59] it's exactly right now do you say then
[50:02] you believe it all these people as
[50:04] trinitarians are of hell no sir I
[50:07] believe they are
[50:08] Christians but the hour is approaching
[50:11] brother where they are sincerely
[50:16] wrong any man anywhere anytime that
[50:20] wants to talk on the subject come to
[50:24] me any Minister Bishop
[50:27] Archbishop whatever you might be and
[50:30] this is taped go around the world I
[50:33] asent brotherly love for any person that
[50:37] hears me on this tape around the
[50:41] world that will come to me and show me
[50:45] one text of scripture or
[50:49] one paragraph in any history that's
[50:54] authentic history where that any person
[50:57] was ever baptized in the name of the
[50:59] father Son and Holy Ghost until the
[51:01] organizing of the Catholic church I'll
[51:03] change my
[51:05] Doctrine thank you
[51:07] [Music]
[51:08] Lord every person was baptized in the
[51:11] name of Jesus Christ and my precious
[51:14] Brethren your eyes are blinded to those
[51:18] things pray God give you light now if
[51:22] you got scripture to support it I'll be
[51:24] looking for you're listening for your
[51:25] call
[51:29] you're you beyond this tape you're
[51:32] willfully walking in spiritual ignorance
[51:36] if you don't challenge me on
[51:40] that you want to know what light what's
[51:43] dark let's ask
[51:44] God remember I say thus sayeth the Lord
[51:49] amen oh blessed be if you be me to be
[51:53] his servant and if that wasn't according
[51:55] to the word it would be wrong
[51:57] then if it is according to the word it's
[51:59] your duty to come straight in the
[52:02] out see what
[52:05] happens it's a eror I believe that many
[52:10] thousands of trinitarian people who
[52:12] believe in three Gods is saved because
[52:15] they don't know any difference we're
[52:17] going to get to that on down in the
[52:18] message now don't you all stop your TAP
[52:21] walk out of the house your trinitarian
[52:22] brethren listen to this but you just set
[52:25] still a few minutes you ought to
[52:26] yourself you ow to your
[52:29] congregation don't stop getting the
[52:31] tapes just stay with it search it by the
[52:34] word and see if it's right the Bible
[52:36] said prove all things I know it's UNP so
[52:39] was Jesus so was the message
[52:41] always you love me when I come and heal
[52:43] the sick and Afflicted among you you
[52:45] thought it was great great crowds and
[52:47] build up the church now Jesus did the
[52:49] same thing until one day he had to get
[52:52] down to truth and when he did even 70
[52:55] turned away from him
[52:57] and he turned to the rest of the 12 and
[52:58] said will you go also and Peter said
[53:00] those notable words Lord who would we go
[53:03] to for thy words alone are
[53:06] Eternal God's word alone is eternal
[53:09] right and find me anywhere that God ever
[53:13] had anybody baptized in the name of the
[53:15] father Son and Holy Ghost you go to
[53:17] Matthew
[53:18] 28:19 Father Son and Holy Ghost where
[53:21] Matthew said go to the for teach All
[53:23] Nations baptize them in the name of the
[53:24] father son Holy Ghost and anybody that
[53:27] thinks the father son Holy Ghost is the
[53:28] name it shows there something wrong with
[53:30] their
[53:31] education now for a seventh grade
[53:33] student to say that to Bishops just
[53:34] listen to
[53:36] this father's not a name son's no name
[53:39] and Holy Ghost is no name there are
[53:42] titles that goes to the name of father
[53:44] son Holy Ghost which is Jesus
[53:50] Christen remember that's not in Anger
[53:53] that's said in love and godly respect
[53:56] right amen with love and consideration
[53:59] for the full body of Christ to where I'm
[54:02] invited by my trinitarian brethren and
[54:05] all over the world to come and preach in
[54:07] their
[54:07] congregation
[54:09] but I never mention it when I'm among
[54:12] you I want to be unless you ask me
[54:14] yourself and I'll go to the parish with
[54:15] you and talk with you about it but
[54:17] before your congregation would stir them
[54:18] up it's your place to get the Revelation
[54:20] and go teacher You're The Shepherd of
[54:22] the flock I'm speaking to
[54:25] ministers amen if you don't understand
[54:27] come let's set and reason together the
[54:29] Bible said prove all things and hold
[54:32] fast to that what's
[54:34] good sea of glass where the sacrifice is
[54:37] washed and we are washed oh don't forget
[54:41] that we're coming back to it at you
[54:42] while wash about the water of the word
[54:47] then you've got to hear the word before
[54:49] you get there because only one way you
[54:51] can approach God that's by faith is that
[54:53] right Faith cometh by here
[54:56] hearing of the
[54:59] word washing our conscience not to meet
[55:02] a man not to meet father not to meet
[55:04] Mother not to meet baby that's all true
[55:06] we will do that but the first thing we
[55:08] got to come is God's Avenue of
[55:11] approach we be worse when we hear the
[55:15] word of God by faith we're
[55:19] walking Grace what God did for
[55:22] you that's right you believe God you
[55:26] believe on God and as soon as you're
[55:28] sorry you're already forgiven as I was
[55:31] speaking to a brother yesterday kind of
[55:32] got a little mixed up on him and I said
[55:35] look brother if you said something to
[55:37] hurt your wife's feelings immediately

[1:22:31] the Seminary you got in a Methodist
[1:22:34] Seminary you reflect methodism you
[1:22:36] reflect you got in a Pentecostal
[1:22:37] Seminary you reflect
[1:22:39] Pentecostalism but if you got it in the
[1:22:42] glory of God by the burning bush why
[1:22:46] would Moses come out from his presence
[1:22:48] he had to put some over his face so the
[1:22:50] people couldn't even look at him is that
[1:22:52] right am
[1:22:55] he was full of the power of God Amen
[1:22:57] Stevens a man full of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:00] trying to stop him why he's like trying
[1:23:02] of put out a house on a windy day in a

[1:23:11] they blow it the worse it got well you
[1:23:13] couldn't stop him directly when they put
[1:23:15] him before the S of course the Bible
[1:23:17] said he stood there looked like an
[1:23:19] angel I don't think an angel just meant
[1:23:21] he was a certain being stand there but
[1:23:23] an angel knows exactly what he's talking
[1:23:26] about so does any Angel a messenger of
[1:23:29] the church AG you don't have to go back
[1:23:30] and see what the Seminary thinks he
[1:23:32] knows what God Said in his Bible the
[1:23:34] power that's reflecting to prove that he
[1:23:36] is the same
[1:23:38] this not afraid he's telling just
[1:23:40] exactly what he knows to be TR and God
[1:23:42] standing right there backing it up with
[1:23:44] the same kind of signs and wonders and
