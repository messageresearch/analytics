[1:29] blessings in Jesus name
[1:34] amen Revelations 6 verse number three
[1:37] and when he had opened the second seal I
[1:41] heard the second beast say come and see
[1:44] and there went out another horse that
[1:46] was red and power was given to him that
[1:50] sat thereon to take peace from the earth
[1:54] and that they should kill one another
[1:57] and there was given unto him a great
[1:59] sword Lord amen so we're prepared to
[2:02] hear this portion of the
[2:08] message
[2:10] only
[2:13] be
[2:15] only
[2:17] believe that all things are
[2:23] possible
[2:24] only
[2:27] be only only
[2:32] believe
[2:34] [Music]
[2:37] only all things are
[2:42] possible
[2:44] only be God bless you you may be seated
[2:48] brother
[2:49] brandham now the first and second verse
[2:52] I'll read it to kind of give a little
[2:53] background then we'll take the third and
[2:56] fourth verse for the second seal and
[2:59] then the fifth th and sixth verse is the
[3:01] third seal and the seventh and eighth is
[3:04] the two verses to each harsh Rider and I
[3:07] want you to watch how these Fellas on
[3:10] this Pale Horse maybe here it comes just
[3:13] keeps changing as it goes down and then
[3:15] that great last seal to be open if God
[3:18] willing next Sunday night that when it
[3:21] happened there was just only thing had
[3:22] taken place was silence in heaven for a
[3:26] half
[3:27] hour God help us
[3:30] now I'll read the third verse now and
[3:33] when he had opened the second seal I
[3:35] heard the second beast say come and see
[3:39] and there went out another horse fourth
[3:42] verse that was red and power was given
[3:45] to him that set there on to take peace
[3:47] from the earth that they should kill one
[3:51] another and they should kill one another
[3:54] and there was given unto him a great
[3:58] sword
[4:00] now a mysterious thing now when the the
[4:03] Beast told John just come and see and he
[4:08] didn't see what it was he just saw a
[4:12] symbol and that
[4:14] symbol the reason it was he said come
[4:17] see but he saw a symbol that he was to
[4:21] symbolize it to the
[4:23] church in a way that they would watch
[4:26] until it came to the last age and then
[4:31] the seals would be open I everyone
[4:34] understands that now see the seals would
[4:36] be open and aren't you happy to be
[4:39] living in this
[4:41] day see not only that friends but always
[4:44] remember now last Sunday morning where
[4:48] the whole thing was based on
[4:50] Simplicity yes amen simple humble
[4:54] happens in such a way that people just
[4:57] go right on by and don't even even
[4:59] though it happens and remember we are
[5:02] looking for the coming of the Lord
[5:07] anytime and um when
[5:11] we uh made a statement that uh uh
[5:15] perhaps the Rapture would be the same
[5:18] way it'll be gone over and no one will
[5:23] nor about you just come like that see
[5:26] usually just go all back through the
[5:28] Bible and look how it happens like that
[5:30] yes amen even as great a thing as the
[5:32] Lord Jesus coming nobody knew nothing
[5:35] about they thought they cranked somebody
[5:37] the churches said just a fanatic he's
[5:40] really crazy he said he's a mad man we
[5:42] know the art mad mad means crazy we know
[5:46] you got a devil and it's running you
[5:48] crazy and you try to teach us when you
[5:51] were born out there illegitimately where
[5:54] you was born in fornication try to teach
[5:56] man like us the priest and so forth the
[5:59] temple
[6:00] my that was a an insult to them when
[6:03] John came been talked about down Through
[6:05] the Ages from Isaiah to Malachi that's
[6:10] 12200 or 712 years he had been seen of
[6:13] the prophets coming everybody was
[6:15] looking for him to come expecting it at
[6:18] any time but the way he come he preached
[6:23] and done his service and went on into
[6:25] glory and even the apostles didn't know
[6:27] it right for they asked him they said
[6:31] now if the son of man is going to
[6:32] Jerusalem all these things to be offered
[6:35] said why is it the scripture says that
[6:38] Elias is going to come first Jesus said
[6:41] he's already come you didn't know it and
[6:44] he did just exactly what the scriptures
[6:46] said he would do and they did to him
[6:48] just what was listed amen and they
[6:51] couldn't understand he said it was
[6:53] John that oh see that they woke up to it
[6:57] they and when even at last after all the
[7:00] things he he had done and the signs he
[7:03] did had showed him and had even called
[7:05] him said which one of you can condemn me
[7:07] of sin unbelief if I haven't done just
[7:10] what the scripture said that my office
[7:12] would do when I come to the Earth then
[7:15] show me where I've
[7:16] sinned see and I'll show you what you're
[7:19] supposed to be and let's see whether you
[7:21] believe it or not see he'll come right
[7:23] back and said you're supposed to believe
[7:24] on me when I come and they didn't do it
[7:26] see so they know better than tying on
[7:29] himm that but he said which one of you
[7:31] can accuse me of unbelief see haven't I
[7:34] done just what it was and even the
[7:36] apostles going along stumbled we know
[7:38] how the scriptures going then finally at
[7:41] last they said now we believe we believe
[7:45] that no man has to tell you for you know
[7:49] all things I just like to seen his face
[7:51] he must have looked at and said well do
[7:53] you now
[7:55] believe finally it dawned on well it was
[7:59] wasn't supposed to be maybe till that
[8:00] time and God works everything just right
[8:03] you know I love him for that but now
[8:06] we're thinking of our age now because we
[8:08] get talking on that we won't get into
[8:10] these seals at all and um I remember uh
[8:15] I'm getting much requests for prayer for
[8:17] the sick and I'm praying for the all the
[8:19] time for every request to get and for
[8:22] the handkerchiefs and things and if we
[8:23] can get these seals finished up to the
[8:26] last seal Sunday morning we if it be the
[8:28] will of the Lord would like to have just
[8:31] a good oldfashioned healing service here
[8:33] you know we just take the entire morning
[8:35] for praying for the sick and I I'm
[8:39] pretty sure it'll be a strange healing
[8:41] meeting see I just have a feeling like
[8:43] that and
[8:46] so not strange but it may be a little
[8:49] strange to some see what um now how
[8:54] great is God's grace to reveal his
[8:57] secrets to us in this this
[9:00] day now we all will believe that we're
[9:03] living in the last day we believe that
[9:07] and remember the secrets was to be
[9:09] revealed in the last day and how does he
[9:13] reveal his word his Secrets the Bible
[9:17] would you like to read where he says it
[9:19] let's just turn over and see how he
[9:20] Reveals His Secrets now I want you to
[9:22] read Amos turn over to the Book of Amos
[9:26] and I want you to read in the third
[9:28] chapter of Amos and the seventh verse
[9:32] all
[9:35] right I going read the 6 verse two shall
[9:38] a trumpet blow in the city and the
[9:41] people not be afraid shall there be evil
[9:45] in a city and the Lord has not done it
[9:49] surely the Lord will do nothing but he
[9:54] revealeth his Secrets unto his servants
[9:56] the
[9:57] prophets now
[9:59] in the last days we are it's predicted
[10:03] to us that there will rise a a prophet
[10:09] now we know that we've had all kinds I
[10:12] realize that we looking around tonight
[10:14] uh I'm speaking here where students are
[10:16] sitting and I I'd like for you to
[10:19] understand me and you realize these
[10:21] tapes cover the world see just about all
[10:23] the world and I want you to not by no
[10:27] means think that I am trying to inject
[10:31] some kind of a a cult of Elijah's
[10:35] blankets or robes and all all those
[10:38] things we've had plenty of but you know
[10:40] all those things are only a forerunning
[10:42] of the real thing that is to come to
[10:44] throw the people off did you know we had
[10:47] false uh uh false leaders raised up
[10:51] false Messiah before Christ
[10:54] come did not the the teacher of that day
[10:57] that Mighty teacher make
[10:59] when the the question come up about
[11:02] beating these men and so forth he said
[11:04] let them alone if it's of God you'll be
[11:07] fine fighting against God but if it
[11:09] isn't of God so didn't a man raise up
[11:11] not long ago take 400 Into the
[11:12] Wilderness and so forth we have those
[11:15] things what was it all
[11:17] forerunning the real thing when it
[11:20] comes now see Satan raises those up
[11:25] watch the shrewdness of this fellow that
[11:26] we're talking about here Satan where
[11:28] we're unfolding him right here just
[11:30] strien him down by the scriptures and
[11:31] let you see who he is that's what the
[11:34] what supposed to be done and you
[11:36] remember he has not tried to go in and
[11:39] be a communist Satan hasn't he's an
[11:44] antichrist so close that Jesus said
[11:46] would deceive the very elected and
[11:49] that's the ones that's hid down in these
[11:50] seals whose names are on the books since
[11:53] the foundation of the world he is a
[11:55] shrewd fellow and when he sees this
[11:58] thing come
[11:59] coming coming up then he throws
[12:02] everything he can out there to upset it
[12:04] before it gets there did you know there
[12:06] will be false Christ rise in the last
[12:09] days it should follow immediately after
[12:12] this after this great message that this
[12:15] uh a brother will speak that will'll
[12:18] actually come be anointed in the spirit
[12:22] of Elijah immediately and they'll
[12:25] mistake him some of them will think he's
[12:27] the Messiah but he'll R they say no
[12:30] because it's got to be coming like John
[12:33] in the time of John the Baptist when he
[12:35] came out there to preach they said to
[12:37] him aren't you the
[12:38] Messiah aren't you he he said I am not
[12:43] I'm not worthy to loose his
[12:45] shoes but I I baptize you with water but
[12:48] he'll baptize with the Holy Ghost and
[12:50] John was so sure that he's on Earth he
[12:52] said he is among you somewhere
[12:57] now but he didn't know on him till he
[12:59] saw that sign come down upon him then
[13:02] when he seen that light coming down
[13:03] spread out like a dove and lit up on him
[13:06] he said there he
[13:08] is but John was the only one saw it you
[13:10] know John was the only one heard the
[13:12] voice all the rest of there no one heard
[13:14] it but then when the real true servant
[13:18] comes on with all the impersonation to
[13:20] it it's to upset the people's mind Satan
[13:25] does that and those you that can't
[13:27] discern right from heart
[13:29] they just tumble over but the elected
[13:32] won't do it the Bible said he wouldn't
[13:35] be able to deceive the elected and now
[13:37] just before the coming of Christ the
[13:39] Bible said there will be false Christ
[13:41] arise and will claim to be Christ you
[13:44] would say l the people say it's in the
[13:47] desert don't believe it l is in the
[13:49] secret chamber don't believe it or as
[13:51] the sun shineth from the East and to the
[13:53] West so shall the coming of the son of
[13:56] man be see yes he'll He he'll appear and
[14:00] it'll be a universal thing and now that
[14:04] will of course when they find out that
[14:07] something is taking place you see then
[14:09] they'll now remember that will take
[14:11] place immediately after the going home
[14:14] of the church at the
[14:15] rampure now there'll be false
[14:18] impersonations all the time and we do
[14:20] not mean to be connected in anything
[14:23] like that no sir and I believe when the
[14:26] person comes this one that's predicted
[14:28] to come I'm showing it only by the
[14:31] scriptures that the man will have to be
[14:34] a prophet he certainly will and the
[14:37] revelation of God because God the word
[14:41] of the Lord comes to his Prophet exactly
[14:45] right that's and God cannot change you
[14:48] see if he had a better system he would
[14:50] he would have used it but he he's got he
[14:53] chose the best system at the beginning
[14:56] just like he could have chose a son to
[14:58] preach the gospel he could chose the
[15:00] moon he could chose the the wind but he
[15:02] chose man amen and he never did choose
[15:06] groups
[15:08] individuals see are never two Major
[15:11] Prophets on the earth at the same
[15:13] time see every man is different he's got
[15:16] a different makeup God can get one
[15:19] person that's all he has to have right
[15:20] in his hand he do what he wants to am he
[15:23] just has to have one in the days of Noah
[15:26] Days of Elijah days of Moses many trou
[15:29] was up in time of Moses you know how
[15:31] they didn't wanted to say well you're
[15:33] not the only Holy One in the bunch and
[15:36] and Dayan and and Kora and God said just
[15:40] separate yourself I'll just open up the
[15:42] Earth and swallow them away you see and
[15:44] and so and then the people got to
[15:47] complaining he said I'll just I'll take
[15:48] the whole thing away and there Moses
[15:51] took the place of Christ and to throw
[15:52] himself in the breach and say don't do
[15:54] it Lord see and of course he after
[15:57] ordained Moses do this didn't come over
[15:59] Moses cuz he was acting like Christ in
[16:01] that time it was Christ in Moses amen
[16:05] absolutely
[16:07] now we're so glad today that God is
[16:11] revealing hisself to us and I believe
[16:14] the great day is just begin Dawning
[16:18] breaking the lights are begin to flesh
[16:21] the birds of paradises begin to sing in
[16:24] the Saints heart they know this isn't
[16:26] long now something's going to happen
[16:29] got so if he does not do anything now
[16:34] all scripture is
[16:36] inspired amen the scriptures must
[16:41] absolutely be the truth no way around it
[16:45] that's why different with our friends
[16:47] the Catholic church I believe that it
[16:50] was not written by just mere man I
[16:53] believe it was moved by the Holy Spirit
[16:57] and all these little things things
[16:58] that's been added and tried to add to it
[17:00] did you notice that the solving up
[17:02] there's everyone kicked out and these
[17:04] real true scriptures Dove tail one with
[17:08] the other to there's no contradiction in
[17:10] them no at
[17:12] all show me one piece of literature that
[17:15] can it can write a verse harly without
[17:18] contradicting itself write a verse atud
[17:21] and the Bible does not contradict itself
[17:23] anywhere amen I've heard the old critic
[17:25] say that but I've had an offer for him
[17:27] for a long time it'll show me where it's
[17:30] at it isn't in here it's just because
[17:34] the human mind is confused God's not
[17:37] confused he know what he's doing he
[17:38] knows look if God's go to judge the
[17:41] World by a church as the Catholic Church
[17:44] says it is all right then what church is
[17:47] that just look at the churches we got we
[17:51] got 900 and something different
[17:53] organization of churches ahuh one
[17:56] teaches this way and one that way what a
[17:57] confusion then anybody just do anything
[18:00] you want to you go on anyhow God's Got
[18:02] To Have Some standard am that's his word
[18:07] speaking not throwing off to the
[18:09] Catholic now cu the the Protestant is
[18:11] just as bad but uh speaking with a
[18:14] priest he said Mr Brandon he said God is
[18:18] in his church I said sir God is in his
[18:22] word and he is the word that's
[18:25] sir he said well he's in the church is
[18:28] in infallible I said he don't say that
[18:32] but he said the word
[18:33] infallible he said well we used to teach
[18:36] that baptism that way and so forth I
[18:38] said when said back in the early days I
[18:40] said do you allow that to be the
[18:43] Catholic church he said yes I said then
[18:44] I'm Catholic oldfashioned Catholic I
[18:47] believe the oldfashioned way you guys
[18:49] today got all messed up and hardly
[18:51] anything in the scripture you teach
[18:53] intercession with women and dead people
[18:55] and all these other things and oh my not
[18:58] meat eating and I don't know what all
[19:01] see I said you find that in the
[19:03] scripture for me he said it don't have
[19:04] to be there as long as the church says
[19:07] so that's it don't make any what that
[19:08] says it's the church I said the Bible
[19:11] said that whosoever shall add one word
[19:14] to it or take one away his part will be
[19:16] taken in the book of
[19:18] life so it's the word I believe the word
[19:23] now and then if Amos says and other
[19:26] scriptures that go with it that if uh
[19:30] and you remember on this we're just
[19:32] striking the highlights of it just my if
[19:37] when I get in that room there and and
[19:39] that anointing comes in if I could write
[19:41] down what he what all goes on I'd be
[19:44] here for three months on one of the
[19:47] seals so just strike the places and let
[19:50] it out just what it would seem to be
[19:53] that wouldn't choke the people but yet
[19:55] uh not enough to hurt them but just so
[19:58] that believing it is it is season the
[20:01] thing you know what I
[20:03] mean
[20:05] now watch this
[20:07] now if God does not do nothing said Amos
[20:13] until first he reveals it to his
[20:15] servants the
[20:18] prophets and then we see what he's
[20:23] doing it must be that he's fixing to do
[20:26] something what he's revealing
[20:28] now God is fixing to move on the scene
[20:33] in judgment I believe amen he's fixing
[20:37] to do something and one thing again it
[20:39] testifies surely we are in the last days
[20:44] we're at the End of the Age the lady OFA
[20:47] Church age now for these things were to
[20:52] be revealed only at the last
[20:57] day
[20:59] I just think of that now it's
[21:02] just just try to soak in what we believe
[21:07] that the Holy Spirit would have us no
[21:09] now remember nothing to be
[21:13] revealed God will do nothing at all
[21:17] until first he reveals it to his
[21:19] servants the
[21:20] prophets and before he does anything he
[21:24] reveals it and when he reveals it you
[21:27] can remember this something's on its
[21:30] Road it's being revealed and these
[21:33] things that we're talking about was to
[21:35] be revealed at the last day just before
[21:39] the last trumpet at the end of the
[21:43] message of the last Church age
[21:46] amen that's right amen if you want to
[21:49] read that now you can turn to you I just
[21:51] referred to you last night two three
[21:53] times Revelations 10 1-7 see and in the
[21:57] days of the the sounding of the seventh
[22:01] Angel's
[22:02] message the mystery of God would be
[22:05] revealed and finished amen and there's
[22:09] only one thing left when this uh seven
[22:13] sealed book is open than the entire
[22:17] mystery of God what we've probed that
[22:19] through years and according to the
[22:21] scripture then we there was no way to
[22:24] understand it until this day
[22:26] amen but because it's been hid amen
[22:31] we've seen the symbol what it was
[22:33] symbolized by but it could not be
[22:36] correctly revealed until the last
[22:39] day now then we must be there at the at
[22:44] the end
[22:56] time
[23:01] [Music]
[24:56] h
[25:09] [Music]
[25:26] now

[1:08:47] image upon his feet that were of iron

[1:08:54] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[1:08:57] silver and the gold broken into pieces
[1:09:01] together and became like the chaff of
[1:09:04] the summer threshing floor and the wind
[1:09:07] carried them away that no place was
[1:09:10] found for them and the stone that smoke

[1:11:14] more time lord Jesus bless your word
[1:11:17] bless your people in Jesus name we pray
[1:11:21] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:11:24] now we started this message or looking
[1:11:28] into these
[1:11:30] quotations from as we were um uh from
[1:11:36] our special meetings we got into the
[1:11:38] stature of a perfect man and coming into
[1:11:41] Perfection and this Great Pyramid that
[1:11:43] we are to be um kept in place for the
[1:11:47] last day and then one day I was out here
[1:11:50] driving I was coming to the church here
[1:11:52] for some great reason during the week
[1:11:54] and I just remembered that there was a
[1:11:56] dream or something that had to do with
[1:11:59] brother brandom with eyes of fire so I
[1:12:02] went to look that up and it was a dream
[1:12:05] of brother Billy Paul and I took it that
[1:12:08] dream and and looked at it it's in the
[1:12:11] message there's a man could turn on the
[1:12:14] light and we uh played that didn't we
[1:12:19] here at the church and after we played
[1:12:21] it it was just a real awareness not that
[1:12:26] we know everything that the dream means
[1:12:28] but we know that church planing is over
[1:12:33] and the time to get ready is now so that
[1:12:36] we're not waiting for another something
[1:12:38] to happen to get us ready the getting
[1:12:42] ready time is now and brother random
[1:12:44] goes in that dream and he says that
[1:12:46] brother really Paul doesn't dream much
[1:12:49] he talks in his sleep but he had a dream
[1:12:52] that shook him up and in this dream he
[1:12:55] sees this Stone come out of the mountain
[1:12:58] that was cut without hands and it
[1:13:02] smites and I'll read the bottom part I
[1:13:05] didn't give this to the sister in the
[1:13:06] back but in paragraph uh
[1:13:11] 40142 brother brandham says this here
[1:13:15] and I motion to a big Granite Mountain
[1:13:19] light without hands cut a stone out of
[1:13:22] the mountain weighing hundreds of tons
[1:13:25] and here I come I said turn your heads
[1:13:27] don't look it'll all be over just in a
[1:13:30] few minutes said then a great holy hush
[1:13:33] come over everywhere as this Stone comes
[1:13:36] towards this place it may be later than
[1:13:40] we think there see that's exactly
[1:13:43] scriptural you see the stone without
[1:13:45] hands cut out of the mountain and so one
[1:13:49] of these days is going to be that way
[1:13:53] when you're going to scream for
[1:13:54] something and I said to them you've
[1:13:57] already had that time God has constantly
[1:14:00] warned you time after time yeah I said
[1:14:04] even if it's my own kid or whoever it is
[1:14:07] the hour is here I can only say what
[1:14:10] he's told me to say it'll be there and
[1:14:13] it was and so we just read that
[1:14:16] scripture it's Daniel chapter 2 and
[1:14:20] brother bam shares with us and shows us
[1:14:22] that Daniel saw the beginning and ending
[1:14:25] of the Gentile
[1:14:27] dispensation not of the Jews but of the
[1:14:30] Gentiles how their time and the
[1:14:32] governments came into power and came
[1:14:35] into being and just to get going in this
[1:14:38] message I want to read a few quotes on
[1:14:41] what's happening right now as brother
[1:14:43] banham will show us that uh the time the
[1:14:47] things that we see ought to cause us to
[1:14:51] look into the word and not so much the
[1:14:54] news outlets and hearing this one and
[1:14:56] that one but the word has the answer to
[1:14:58] what's going on today and here in the
[1:15:01] message
[1:15:03] um the time is at hand paragraph
[1:15:08] 17 and the time every fellow has to come
[1:15:11] to a time where you make a decision
[1:15:13] there's got to be a time where you make
[1:15:16] your decision of whether you're going to
[1:15:18] be married or not then the decision that
[1:15:21] you and your girlfriend have to to make
[1:15:23] whether you're going to live together or
[1:15:25] get married or not there's all kinds of
[1:15:28] decisions to be made in life and they'll
[1:15:31] linger long for a certain period Then a
[1:15:34] time comes where it's got to be settled
[1:15:37] that's the last time it's got to happen
[1:15:40] now one way or the other and Christian
[1:15:44] friend I believe that we're living in
[1:15:46] the end time that when all things that
[1:15:49] was written in the Bible it's time now
[1:15:52] for all all these things to come to pass
[1:15:56] and I believe that the very things that
[1:15:58] we see happening now is just exactly in
[1:16:02] season with God's
[1:16:05] word brother Adam continues in the
[1:16:07] message trying to do God a service
[1:16:09] without being its will being God's will
[1:16:12] paragraph 3:20 he says this God has
[1:16:17] promised his word how it would be
[1:16:21] fulfilled and how it would come to pass
[1:16:24] when he chose his bride how it would be
[1:16:27] done it's happening right before you in
[1:16:30] the name of the Lord and that's by the
[1:16:33] original word the evening time message
[1:16:37] is here can you say praise the
[1:16:40] Lord we'll take one more in this message
[1:16:44] uniting time and sign paragraph 99 the
[1:16:47] prophet of God says this
[1:16:50] here now you see but in the last days
[1:16:54] you see we see things happening now that
[1:16:57] has never happened before see it's God
[1:17:01] sign and all this uniting is a Time sign
[1:17:05] now we want to look at that carefully
[1:17:07] and be real sure what we get that we get
[1:17:11] it want to be real sure that we get it
[1:17:15] amen we'll take one more on this
[1:17:16] happening now and this is in the message
[1:17:19] One in a
[1:17:22] Million
[1:17:23] paragraph 12 he says the time and the
[1:17:25] hour that we're living if a person don't
[1:17:28] know which way to go what to do or how
[1:17:31] to turn you're not walking by faith
[1:17:34] anymore you're just guessing
[1:17:38] presuming and presume is to advance
[1:17:41] without official Authority so if we
[1:17:44] haven't got the real official authority
[1:17:46] to know what God Said would take place
[1:17:49] in this hour how are we ever going to
[1:17:53] face this hour and we've got to face it
[1:17:57] knowing by faith in his word that the
[1:17:59] things that's supposed to be happening
[1:18:01] now and the condition and the Nations
[1:18:05] the condition of the people condition of
[1:18:08] the church and so forth we've got to
[1:18:10] know that and then how to walk out to
[1:18:13] face it if you don't know how to do that
[1:18:16] you're just what we call kind of
[1:18:19] haphazardly just jump in hoping it'll be
[1:18:23] here hoping this and hoping that and
[1:18:26] will it be but God don't want us to do
[1:18:29] that he wants us to know what he has
[1:18:32] said about this day then meet it by
[1:18:37] faith because he said it would be that
[1:18:39] way then we know uh we know your truth
[1:18:43] then because you haven't got some
[1:18:45] person's word for it you got his word
[1:18:48] what we must do and we're hoping that
[1:18:51] our heavenly father will grant this to
[1:18:53] us this week man it's so nice how
[1:18:58] brother random lays that out that this
[1:19:01] it's happening right before you that the
[1:19:03] evening time message is here and that
[1:19:07] this this time that he wants us to know
[1:19:11] of what day that we're living in and so
[1:19:15] the the the point is
[1:19:17] that we are seeing things take place and
[1:19:20] transpire that we have never seen before
[1:19:22] for I just read it for you there's
[1:19:25] things that are taking place in politics
[1:19:27] and in churches and in communities and
[1:19:31] in families and things that are going on
[1:19:34] that we have never seen before and if
[1:19:37] you put on your radio everybody has
[1:19:41] their version of the answer but God
[1:19:44] never sent a news Outlet to tell me how
[1:19:47] to prepare my heart for the hour that
[1:19:50] we're living in there's things that take
[1:19:52] place that I can't explain but I know
[1:19:55] how to
[1:19:56] stand and walking by faith isn't walking
[1:20:01] in a realm that you don't know what's
[1:20:03] going on walking by faith is not
[1:20:07] presuming that's right walking by faith
[1:20:09] is say well I'm walking by faith I don't
[1:20:12] know what's going on I don't know how
[1:20:13] this is going to happen I don't know
[1:20:14] what's going to work out that's not
[1:20:15] walking by faith walking by faith is
[1:20:18] knowing where you stand knowing that
[1:20:22] this this is The Hour That was supposed
[1:20:24] to be here and everything that happens
[1:20:27] out there the word already told us it
[1:20:29] was coming and the things that we
[1:20:32] haven't seen yet because there's things
[1:20:35] possibly that we have never seen take
[1:20:38] place begin here in
[1:20:41] 2024 and so what do we do we need to
[1:20:44] know what's said in this word about this
[1:20:47] day and know what the
[1:20:49] expectations our expectations of the day
[1:20:53] should be so first we see everything
[1:20:56] happening and I'll lay that Foundation
[1:20:59] now that whatever we see going on the
[1:21:01] word has an answer for it secondly once
[1:21:06] we know what the word said for our day
[1:21:09] then we stay behind that word and that's
[1:21:12] our expectation we expect it to get
[1:21:15] worse we expect it to get crazier we
[1:21:20] expect it to be more unex
[1:21:23] explainable I mean there's friends
[1:21:26] there's relationships there are churches
[1:21:28] that simply changed
[1:21:31] overnight right before our
[1:21:34] eyes Christian people worldly people
[1:21:37] political people right before our eyes
[1:21:41] it's actually changing so fast it used
[1:21:44] to be there be a certain movement come
[1:21:47] every five six years and now it's like
[1:21:50] every year there's another level and
[1:21:52] another level and another level and
[1:21:55] people calling you and getting you
[1:21:56] online and pulling you this way come
[1:21:58] over here and do this church this way
[1:22:01] this is how we Church you need to church
[1:22:03] the way we
[1:22:05] church but once we know the word we know
[1:22:09] the expectation of the day and then
[1:22:11] finally we need to meet that challenge
[1:22:15] by faith and so this um idolatry in the
[1:22:20] last day will go into this just for a
[1:22:22] moment how in the last days which we are
[1:22:26] in those last days the prophet of God
[1:22:29] tells us there is a beginning and the
[1:22:33] ending of the Gentile dispensation so he
[1:22:36] takes the message the mark of the beast
[1:22:39] and I trust you pray with me this
[1:22:41] morning how I know you pray with me is
[1:22:44] when I get an amen every now and
[1:22:46] then just one or two paragraph 163 in
[1:22:51] the message the mark of the Beast
[1:22:53] brother brandom says this notice King
[1:22:56] Nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back
[1:22:57] Yonder when the Gentile age was issued
[1:23:00] in let's watch how it come in and the
[1:23:03] way it come in you'll find out it goes
[1:23:06] out the same way we know that there is a
[1:23:09] beginning of time of Grace for the
[1:23:13] Gentiles and a ending of time is that
[1:23:18] right now watch King Nebuchadnezzar when
[1:23:21] Daniel sent down the there a smart
[1:23:23] Prophet when all the rest of the Jews
[1:23:25] had kind of humbled down and was bowing
[1:23:27] to the Romans or to the Babylonians but
[1:23:30] there was three four men three Shadrach
[1:23:34] Meek and abendigo and Daniel who purpos
[1:23:38] in their heart that they would serve God
[1:23:41] and when they throw Shadrach and so
[1:23:43] forth in and Daniel had to become a
[1:23:45] great man and he had become a great man
[1:23:47] and before King Nebuchadnezzar and basar
[1:23:50] and so forth when he become a great man
[1:23:53] now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made a
[1:23:55] image of gold and set it out out in the
[1:23:59] field and said that everybody would have
[1:24:02] to bow to that image did you ever notice
[1:24:05] the innocence of it who that image was
[1:24:09] made of it was Daniel the image of a man
[1:24:15] and didn't he say the spirits of the
[1:24:16] Gods the
[1:24:18] Heathen as they are today got three or
[1:24:20] four of them the spirits of the God
[1:24:23] lived in him so brother bam is telling
[1:24:25] us that these boys who were believers
[1:24:29] who knew Daniel and Daniel was a prophet
[1:24:32] for sure and these boys who were
[1:24:34] commanded to worship only one God come
[1:24:38] to attest a time and their experience
[1:24:42] where they were forced to worship this
[1:24:46] image and a holy image the image of a
[1:24:49] holy man A Gifted Man a man that they
[1:24:52] knew and they did not fail the test they
[1:24:57] stayed with the original word brother
[1:25:00] Banner continues in the message
[1:25:01] beginning and ending of the Gentile
[1:25:03] dispensation and he says this
[1:25:06] in paragraph number four Daniel was the
[1:25:11] prophet that was carried from Jerusalem
[1:25:13] down into Babylon and carrying away of
[1:25:15] the Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar he
[1:25:17] was a young fellow when he went down
[1:25:19] into Babylon there's not many of them
[1:25:21] that had still uh holding on the grand
[1:25:25] old faith I like Daniel because he had
[1:25:28] purpose that in his heart when he went
[1:25:31] down into Babylon that he was going to
[1:25:34] remain a
[1:25:35] Believer and he wasn't going to defile
[1:25:37] himself with the king's meat and so
[1:25:39] forth now the very thing that Daniel was
[1:25:42] the prophet to the Gentiles Daniel saw
[1:25:45] all the Gentile age rise and fall he was
[1:25:48] the first one he's called the Gentile
[1:25:50] prophet he wasn't a gentile himself but
[1:25:53] he saw the Gentile dispensation from
[1:25:55] start to finish the head of gold and
[1:25:58] ending up in the feet of iron and clay
[1:26:01] and while down in there purposing in his
[1:26:04] heart that he wouldn't defile himself
[1:26:05] with the king's meat with the king's
[1:26:07] Affair another group of brothers named
[1:26:10] Shadrach meach and abendigo went down
[1:26:14] there which was not prophets but
[1:26:18] Believers and they also purpose in their
[1:26:21] heart and then when those four Believers
[1:26:23] come together I'd imagine quite oftenly
[1:26:26] they had prayer meetings together just
[1:26:29] like we do we get together because we
[1:26:32] have things in common you know there's
[1:26:34] an old slogan birds of a feather flock
[1:26:37] together and that old proverb rather and
[1:26:40] that's a pretty good thing too birds of
[1:26:42] a feather flock together aren't you
[1:26:46] happy of
[1:26:47] that brother ROM continues on in that
[1:26:51] same message message I'll drop down
[1:26:54] paragraph number
[1:26:58] 19 and we saw the vision the head of
[1:27:01] gold the breast here of silver the
[1:27:04] thighs of brass notice each kingdom got
[1:27:07] little harder King Nebuchadnezzar's
[1:27:10] kingdom was a head of gold he
[1:27:11] interpreted it told him just exactly how
[1:27:14] those kingdoms would succeed each other
[1:27:16] until the end and then notice from gold
[1:27:20] is the softest silver is NE next then
[1:27:22] brass is next then iron is next harder
[1:27:26] harder colder further away notice then
[1:27:30] the midst of all of that Daniel beheld
[1:27:32] the image until the stone was hued out
[1:27:35] of the mountain that was cut out without
[1:27:37] hands that rolled into the image and
[1:27:40] broke it and made it like wheat on the
[1:27:42] summer thrashing floor and the Wind
[1:27:46] Drive away and the stone grew into a
[1:27:50] great Mountain that covered all the
[1:27:52] earth and the sea that was the coming of
[1:27:57] the
[1:27:58] Lord Jesus which is now at
[1:28:03] hand so brother randam identifies that
[1:28:06] the coming of the Lord and that stone
[1:28:08] would replace those kingdoms he
[1:28:10] continues on in this message I have to
[1:28:12] make this point in paragraph 25 and
[1:28:15] beginning and ending of Gentile
[1:28:17] dispensation he says this
[1:28:20] here cuz King Nebuchadnezzar had called
[1:28:22] him
[1:28:23] basar he I'll go up he said he saw the
[1:28:26] end time coming he saw the Gentile
[1:28:29] starts and if you notice the Gentiles
[1:28:31] started off with an idol worship they
[1:28:34] was worshiping a great Idol setting out
[1:28:37] in the field an idol of a man I believe
[1:28:41] Daniel himself cuz King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:45] called him
[1:28:46] basar which was his God he started
[1:28:49] worshiping an image of a righteous a
[1:28:52] holy man and Daniel refused to do it so
[1:28:55] did the Hebrew children Shadrach meach
[1:28:59] and
[1:28:59] avendo and that was and that's the way
[1:29:02] it was issued in and it was condemned
[1:29:05] the head of gold was issued in by image
[1:29:09] worship Force to it and ended up in a
[1:29:12] supernatural hand writing a supernatural
[1:29:15] language that only Supernatural
[1:29:17] understanding could understand it amen
[1:29:19] that's the way the Gentile Kingdom
[1:29:21] issued in
[1:29:22] and it'll go out the same way so we see
[1:29:26] that what the Temptation came for those
[1:29:29] Believers was for them to Bow Down and
[1:29:32] Worship this image of their friend and
[1:29:35] brother who was the prophet now not just
[1:29:39] one place I have a string of maybe seven
[1:29:42] or eight of where brother vam makes that
[1:29:45] comparison the image of a holy man he
[1:29:48] said he believes that it was Daniel so
[1:29:51] you put your s in those believer shoes
[1:29:54] and see what the the the the the
[1:29:57] pressure was and we dealt with this in
[1:30:00] the message um and the brother brandom
[1:30:03] preached on the bruised Serpent and he
[1:30:05] says that there was an element of
[1:30:06] Believers in his church that made him
[1:30:09] the anointed Christ the Incarnate Christ
[1:30:13] and he had to deal with it he corrected
[1:30:16] it but he gave us the reason why they
[1:30:19] did that and the reason reason why they
[1:30:22] did that is found in Luke 3:1 15 he said
[1:30:27] he went to the Lord about it and the
[1:30:30] Lord referred to him the scripture that
[1:30:34] they did the same thing that John and
[1:30:36] the reason why they saw John as Christ
[1:30:41] or started to confuse him because it had
[1:30:43] been so long that they hadn't had a
[1:30:46] prophet so could you imagine us Gentiles
[1:30:49] we never had one right so you can
[1:30:52] imagine that element to be there but
[1:30:54] there's a reason why it was there we we
[1:30:58] didn't know where to place this we
[1:31:00] didn't know how to handle it it's too
[1:31:03] much like God it must be God so maybe he
[1:31:08] is
[1:31:10] God and so in Luke 3 verse
[1:31:16] 15 the prophet says that the Lord
[1:31:20] directed him to that scripture I'll read
[1:31:22] it for you quickly I you Mark Luke John
[1:31:25] 3:15 all
[1:31:35] right and as the people were in
[1:31:39] expectation and all men mused in their
[1:31:42] hearts of John whether he were the
[1:31:45] Christ or not so in dealing with this
[1:31:49] brother Bram brings out the these two uh
[1:31:53] uh uh let's let's call them two sides of
[1:31:56] the road if you would you have this
[1:31:59] group of people who were actually amused
[1:32:02] so much with John's Ministry that that
[1:32:05] he has to be the Christ the Bible says
[1:32:07] so the angel of the Lord quickens this
[1:32:10] to brother brandom this is why this is
[1:32:12] happening it's still
[1:32:14] Antichrist it's still wrong but now we
[1:32:18] know why they did it they did it because
[1:32:21] we didn't know where else to place it
[1:32:24] it's too much I mean nor are the pastor
[1:32:26] I know was ever accused of being the
[1:32:28] Lord Jesus Christ sir I was never
[1:32:31] accused of such I was accused of many
[1:32:33] things never accused of
[1:32:36] that it's really an honor it's really
[1:32:39] you got to be doing something pretty
[1:32:41] good for somebody to want to baptize in
[1:32:44] your
[1:32:46] name y'all ain't saying nothing it's the
[1:32:50] truth but it's like it's so Antichrist
[1:32:54] what does Antichrist mean it means anti-
[1:32:56] word it's against the word but there's a
[1:32:59] reason for it that's one the other side
[1:33:03] is in Matthew Chapter 13 it's in the
[1:33:06] message um the seed is um it's in uh
[1:33:13] it's in the message the seed of
[1:33:16] discrepancy Matthew Chapter 13 and
[1:33:18] brother random says this
[1:33:19] here in the seed of discrepancy
[1:33:22] paragraph number 30 this is the other
[1:33:24] side he says when a man stands and says
[1:33:28] he's a gospel preacher and says that the
[1:33:31] days of Miracles is pass that's the seed
[1:33:35] of discrepancy when a man stands and
[1:33:37] says that he's a minister a pastor of a
[1:33:41] church or somewhere and he does not
[1:33:43] believe that Jesus Christ is the same in
[1:33:45] every detail except the physical body
[1:33:49] same yesterday today day and forever you
[1:33:53] read it that's the seed of what
[1:33:56] discrepancy when he says that miracles
[1:33:58] in the apostolic age pass that's the
[1:34:01] seed of discrepancy when they say
[1:34:03] there's no such a thing as Divine
[1:34:04] Healing so we see this element is it was
[1:34:09] there it's still around it's still there
[1:34:13] can I go a little bit further in
[1:34:15] questions and answers in
[1:34:18] 1964 and question number 329
[1:34:22] a sister writes this question in and
[1:34:24] says this here this is in 1964 people
[1:34:28] are saying brother brandham is more than
[1:34:30] a man he can
[1:34:32] create and Jesus can look just like
[1:34:35] brother
[1:34:36] brandom now let me the person said this
[1:34:38] whoever it might be I don't know but I
[1:34:41] am your brother see Jesus is your savior
[1:34:45] I cannot be your savior for he has
[1:34:48] already saved you can I get an amen amen
[1:34:52] now you're so close to being the truth
[1:34:55] there
[1:34:56] what and yet so far from the
[1:35:00] truth the person that told this person
[1:35:03] this now it's just looks to me like a
[1:35:05] woman's handri very beautiful
[1:35:08] handwriting and I say that was a woman's
[1:35:10] handwright wouldn't you say brother caps
[1:35:11] wouldn't you think that was a woman's
[1:35:13] handwright pretty handwright I don't
[1:35:15] know who it is but if it was me I would
[1:35:17] be proud that he's complimenting my
[1:35:19] handwriting right he's getting into the
[1:35:22] handwriting now brother brandom could
[1:35:24] Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or
[1:35:28] something like that one sense of the
[1:35:30] word that's exactly the
[1:35:32] truth another sense of the word is
[1:35:36] Antichrist so if you run off on either
[1:35:39] end you're going to go wrong because in
[1:35:42] one sense yes but in another sense no so
[1:35:46] it's like over here over here which way
[1:35:48] go left no go right no go left no go
[1:35:50] right what side is
[1:35:54] it exactly the truth another sense of
[1:35:57] the word is Antichrist that's the
[1:36:01] difference between right and
[1:36:04] wrong to make me the person of the Lord
[1:36:07] Jesus Christ would be an antichrist see
[1:36:11] for that person of the Lord Jesus is
[1:36:15] sitting at the right hand of majesty on
[1:36:17] high and will come again in great power
[1:36:20] and Glory for his life that was in him
[1:36:23] being upon me and upon you who have him
[1:36:27] is exactly the truth and you become
[1:36:30] Christ you remember my message on
[1:36:32] Messiah the word Messiah means the
[1:36:35] anointed one now you are if you have the
[1:36:38] Holy Spirit you become the anointed one
[1:36:41] see then there's all kinds of anointed
[1:36:45] ones so this is a tremendous question
[1:36:49] it's a element that goes on it's a an
[1:36:52] element that
[1:36:54] exists um the prophet of God tells us
[1:36:57] why it exists it's scriptual it existed
[1:37:00] with John it ex it exists in this
[1:37:03] ministry here and it's it's so close to
[1:37:06] the truth and it's and it's off to but
[1:37:10] if you don't believe it come in every
[1:37:12] detail except the physical Corporal body
[1:37:15] that's the seed of
[1:37:16] discrepancy you see and so this element
[1:37:21] of the last day those are some of the
[1:37:24] things that we would see the Bible tells
[1:37:26] us that knowing the last days these
[1:37:29] times would come Jesus told us in
[1:37:31] Matthew 24 so that you wouldn't be
[1:37:34] alarmed in your heart these things are
[1:37:36] pestilence Wars uh men lovers of
[1:37:40] themselves uh uh truce Breakers you
[1:37:42] don't have any Faithful Friends anymore
[1:37:45] everybody's willing to stab their back
[1:37:47] on you nobody they'll talk about you
[1:37:49] before they call you they'll rum it
[1:37:51] they'll pass it along and then they'll
[1:37:53] check the facts later you know what I'm
[1:37:55] talking about and it's true and we see
[1:37:57] that increasing and increasing the love
[1:38:00] of many waxing cold and then the prophet
[1:38:03] of God brings in this element of the
[1:38:08] Janice and the
[1:38:10] jambus that their Folly would be made
[1:38:13] known so I just want to take a moment or
[1:38:18] two and look at Exodus chapter 7 I
[1:38:23] believe it was that Janice and jambers
[1:38:26] come on the
[1:38:27] scene it is here that that
[1:38:31] that that in the book of Timothy the
[1:38:35] Apostle Paul now says as Janice and
[1:38:39] jambus withstood Moses so do these men
[1:38:44] of reprobate Minds confir concerning the
[1:38:48] truth they resist the truth
[1:38:52] truth I think I took those notes out
[1:38:55] yeah in Exodus chapter
[1:39:00] 7 in verse 11 we read it for you last
[1:39:03] time this is what the scripture is
[1:39:04] referring to when Moses was called of
[1:39:07] God to go down and let my people go and
[1:39:11] Moses takes his staff in his arm in his
[1:39:14] hand and he has these two signs that
[1:39:17] were given to him to go down and and
[1:39:20] really change is of course Moses we want
[1:39:22] you to do something that has never been
[1:39:24] done before you you don't have some
[1:39:27] contemporaries that you can run this by
[1:39:30] you don't have a pattern of friends or
[1:39:32] other prophets or preachers that you can
[1:39:34] check this with to make sure it's
[1:39:36] balanced this is going to be the first
[1:39:38] time it ever I want you to go down and
[1:39:40] let my people go I want you to go down
[1:39:43] to Pharaoh I'm not talking about
[1:39:45] sneaking them out I'm talking about
[1:39:48] going to the head man of the the whole
[1:39:52] operation and and and we you don't have
[1:39:55] no Army you don't have you don't you
[1:39:57] don't have no weapons of warfare you
[1:40:00] know how bad they are you know how tough
[1:40:02] they are but I want you to go down and
[1:40:05] tell them that the God who has no
[1:40:09] name has sent you to to let my people
[1:40:15] go that's a strong proposition but the
[1:40:18] pillar fire comes to him the Pillar of
[1:40:21] Fire makes himself known to him and I'll
[1:40:24] say this when when God makes himself
[1:40:26] known to you you will be Fearless too
[1:40:30] you do some stuff that's crazy you'll
[1:40:33] stand up and you'll
[1:40:35] testify if you came in contact with God
[1:40:38] you can't hold your peace no more you
[1:40:41] got to tell it it's like fire shut up in
[1:40:44] your bones Jeremiah said he goes down
[1:40:49] there he has has the message of
[1:40:53] Deliverance he has the word of the Lord
[1:40:56] he has the signs he has the Wonders and
[1:40:58] he goes down there he says Let My People
[1:41:00] Go he says by what who's who's god well
[1:41:04] this is my God he throws his rod down
[1:41:07] and when he throws his rod down didn't
[1:41:10] even Flex Pharaoh didn't even Flinch
[1:41:14] that's right he said Reverend jamus
[1:41:17] Reverend uh uh Janice or magician
[1:41:20] whatever they call them enchanters come
[1:41:23] come and they throw their rods down too
[1:41:25] brother bam says that
[1:41:27] Moses never
[1:41:31] moved he never went back to check the
[1:41:33] quotes and make sure his quotes was
[1:41:35] right and everything was right no he
[1:41:37] stayed right there God told me to do
[1:41:40] this what they
[1:41:41] doing the Lord didn't tell me they was
[1:41:43] going to do this but I'm here I'm called
[1:41:45] to stand
[1:41:47] here you're going to see something that
[1:41:49] you've never seen before but stay with
[1:41:52] the
[1:41:53] word because this has been Vindicated
[1:41:57] and I'll stand by my word he throws his
[1:42:00] rod down they throw their rod down and
[1:42:02] becomes a
[1:42:05] serpent cheap magician trick fa you come
[1:42:08] in here with this enchantments we've
[1:42:09] been doing this for centuries you
[1:42:12] playing games with us you got to come
[1:42:14] deeper than that Moses just sat there
[1:42:17] and waake what they doing what's going
[1:42:18] on somebody hungry huh one of the snakes
[1:42:22] eats up
[1:42:23] one and then he eats up the other one
[1:42:26] and then Moses goes down and grabs that
[1:42:30] rod and when this takes place Janice and
[1:42:34] jambus still continued in their
[1:42:38] Ministry Pharaoh's heart was hardened
[1:42:41] because now his men can do what Moses
[1:42:43] did the Second Great Miracle comes about
[1:42:47] and that's in Exodus 7 and verse 22
[1:42:51] Moses comes back I think it was 7 days
[1:42:53] later and he takes his rod and he puts
[1:42:56] it into the water and calls for
[1:43:00] blood and blood
[1:43:03] comes and when the blood came Janice and
[1:43:06] Chambers did the same thing these were
[1:43:11] devils and they were anointed Devils but
[1:43:15] you're the audience watching it all play
[1:43:18] out they both got powers
[1:43:21] they both doing what they said they was
[1:43:23] going to do they both are anointed but
[1:43:26] you got to stay with the calling that
[1:43:29] God give to you because the word of the
[1:43:32] Lord Satan can't stay with all of
[1:43:36] it because the word is like this it's
[1:43:39] like the the eagle's
[1:43:41] wings every verse every chapter takes
[1:43:44] you up higher and it goes Higher and
[1:43:48] Higher and only Eagles can fly with
[1:43:52] eagles and so Janice and jam did the
[1:43:56] same thing the LI come pardon me the
[1:44:00] frogs come Janice and jambus did the
[1:44:04] same thing so this these Miracles
[1:44:08] between Janice and jambus against Moses
[1:44:12] is causing now Pharaoh's heart to harden
[1:44:16] and you say to yourself why God why
[1:44:19] don't you just explode Janice and jambus
[1:44:22] off the face of the Earth why don't you
[1:44:25] just make their powers not work you know
[1:44:28] we we see these people on the internet
[1:44:30] you you you punching the name uh brother
[1:44:32] brandom it's not all believers on there
[1:44:36] it's not people that's trying to tell
[1:44:37] you the truth it's all kind of he like
[1:44:39] why would these people lie the way they
[1:44:42] lie he say Lord how do you let them
[1:44:45] continue on why don't you blow them up
[1:44:47] or explode them or give me the power to
[1:44:50] explode
[1:44:51] them give us the power to wipe them off
[1:44:54] you're not a Believer out of here
[1:44:57] boom and but God doesn't do that does he
[1:45:01] he allows it to
[1:45:03] continue he makes it almost it's almost
[1:45:06] confusing if you're watching it play out
[1:45:09] how can these wicked men prosper and God
[1:45:14] allows them to prosper because that
[1:45:18] heart has to harden and it's the heart
[1:45:21] that needs to and the cup of the
[1:45:23] iniquity needs to fill up greater and
[1:45:27] greater so judgment can come so brother
[1:45:30] bandam deals with this in the message
[1:45:32] anointed ones at the end
[1:45:37] time and he says this
[1:45:41] here paragraph
[1:45:45] 148 notice they did the same
[1:45:48] Miracles notice they did it they they
[1:45:51] didn't do it till after the original
[1:45:53] word went
[1:45:54] forth is in the message anointed once at
[1:45:57] the end time paragraph 148 that's the
[1:46:00] way Satan done in the Garden of Eden
[1:46:02] that's the way he done it all the time
[1:46:05] who prophesied first Moses who come on
[1:46:08] the scene first Moses or balam Moses who
[1:46:11] come on the scene first Jeremiah or
[1:46:13] hananiah you see
[1:46:16] it paragraph 150 pharaoh denomination
[1:46:21] says we have man that can do the same
[1:46:23] thing and they
[1:46:25] did they did it see why did Pharaoh do
[1:46:29] this why did God permit
[1:46:31] it why would God send a true anointed
[1:46:36] Prophet down there to perform a sign
[1:46:39] before pharaoh and then let a
[1:46:41] denominational copy come around and copy
[1:46:44] it before the
[1:46:46] people why would he let an impostor rise
[1:46:49] up to do it and do the same thing
[1:46:52] exactly the genuine spirit of God done
[1:46:55] see the scripture must be
[1:46:59] fulfilled notice he did this so that he
[1:47:02] would Harden the heart of pharaoh and
[1:47:04] the
[1:47:05] Egyptians to prove that Moses wasn't the
[1:47:08] only one that had the
[1:47:12] word they could do everything just the
[1:47:14] same as Moses could do and why did God
[1:47:18] let this thing happen in the last day so
[1:47:21] the same thing as the liyon spirit said
[1:47:24] to zedekiah how can we get Ahab out
[1:47:26] there to make these things come to pass
[1:47:30] how is he going to get these people
[1:47:32] trusting in their churches to get out
[1:47:34] here to come to this thing to come to
[1:47:38] pass that he
[1:47:41] predicted they in the late oan Church
[1:47:43] age because thou sayest thou are rich
[1:47:46] and have need of nothing and set as a
[1:47:48] queen why did he let this impersonation
[1:47:52] rise up in the last days paragraph 152
[1:47:55] when these things are coming to pass by
[1:47:57] the true word of God and let
[1:47:59] impersonators come up and do the same
[1:48:02] thing and then to deny the true word of
[1:48:05] God he did it for Moses and Pharaoh did
[1:48:08] it against Moses and those Janis and
[1:48:12] jambers did it against Moses and the
[1:48:14] Bible says that it will repeat again in
[1:48:17] the last days here we are
[1:48:21] now if that ain't scripture fulfilled
[1:48:24] where is it at did Moses fet them say
[1:48:28] here here you can't do that I'm the only
[1:48:30] one been ordained to do that here you
[1:48:33] stop that right now he just let him
[1:48:36] go let them go remember the Bible says
[1:48:42] as their fol was made manifest so will
[1:48:45] these in the last days be made manifest
[1:48:48] when the bride is raptured and taken
[1:48:51] into the sky hallelujah thank you Lord
[1:48:56] Moses the true manifested word never
[1:48:59] said nothing just let it go but he did
[1:49:02] that so he could Harden the heart of
[1:49:06] pharaoh deceive Pharaoh he did that very
[1:49:10] same thing so he could deceive Ahab and
[1:49:13] the only one little guy standing there
[1:49:16] himself Little M Micah telling them thus
[1:49:19] sayith the Lord here stood another one
[1:49:21] anointed thus sayth the Lord and
[1:49:23] contrary one to another so God allows it
[1:49:27] doesn't
[1:49:28] he you know God hardened Hitler's heart
[1:49:33] hardened miscellanies heart hardened the
[1:49:37] rest of the world's heart the rest of
[1:49:39] the world act like they didn't know what
[1:49:40] was going on in
[1:49:43] Germany but we still had our Olympic
[1:49:45] Games going on we we want to make sure
[1:49:47] we got that in there and people went
[1:49:49] over there and warned us and warned the
[1:49:52] other nations what Adolf Hitler was
[1:49:54] doing he was Rising into power and we
[1:49:57] act like it wasn't even going on I mean
[1:50:00] these people over here crying and losing
[1:50:02] their entire
[1:50:04] life everything been taken from them
[1:50:08] without any law or Justice to cry to no
[1:50:12] police to call no court to run the case
[1:50:16] and hear others around the world act
[1:50:19] like they didn't see the Jews going
[1:50:21] through this trouble because we ain't
[1:50:23] Jews but wait they're coming for you
[1:50:27] too and it act like it wasn't happening
[1:50:29] but God hardened the heart these are his
[1:50:32] children he hardened the heart of Hitler
[1:50:35] hardened the heart of melini and he he
[1:50:38] let this heart get so hard and hateful
[1:50:43] towards the Jews they persecuted them
[1:50:47] pushed them out they ran for their lives
[1:50:50] they hid like
[1:50:53] animals and they all went back to the
[1:50:56] promised
[1:50:58] land and he did that so he can get them
[1:51:01] to the promised
[1:51:03] land he did that so he can get them into
[1:51:06] position where he wanted them and God
[1:51:10] allows the same thing for
[1:51:12] us God allowed job to go through his
[1:51:16] test without even giving him a coherent
[1:51:20] reason as to
[1:51:23] why that's a tremendous question why do
[1:51:26] I have to suffer or why is things going
[1:51:29] wrong for me why are things turning out
[1:51:32] this way why I don't have the friends
[1:51:35] that I should have or why didn't I
[1:51:37] didn't prosper in my business like I
[1:51:39] wanted to why is my Ministry failing
[1:51:43] why and
[1:51:45] job asked that question and Believers
[1:51:49] asked that question question and you
[1:51:51] don't have the answer sir come on
[1:51:54] somebody why why why
[1:51:59] why but job had a sacrifice didn't he he
[1:52:04] had enough to know where to
[1:52:06] stand he had enough to know what the
[1:52:09] word said about his
[1:52:11] sacrifice and then he could meet the
[1:52:14] challenge of his test because he did
[1:52:17] what God Said to
[1:52:18] do praise God
[1:52:21] Amen that's the same with you and I

[1:54:51] things we've never seen before God's
[1:54:53] word identified that would be here and
[1:54:56] then now that we know this we expect it
[1:54:59] to be that
[1:55:02] way can I take one scripture as I
[1:55:04] close time is it yeah Genesis quickly
[1:55:10] Genesis chapter
[1:55:11] 13 15
[1:55:18] sorry remember that covid
[1:55:21] year
[1:55:23] huh pretty tough wasn't
[1:55:26] it what if something comes that's worse
[1:55:29] than
[1:55:30] that what shouldn't we even be expecting
[1:55:33] something
[1:55:35] worse it's like we some some people love
[1:55:39] crazy they love dysfunction they love a
[1:55:41] good oh something crazy tell me about it
[1:55:44] we're waiting for crazy to happen we
[1:55:46] looking for
[1:55:48] it
[1:55:50] you want things to get better the news
[1:55:53] out there wanted to get better but
[1:55:54] Believers is like let it happen Lord let
[1:55:58] something strike here to shake this
[1:56:00] thing up make us all question ourselves
[1:56:04] and find the altar again and repent over
[1:56:06] again and maybe get re-baptized if I
[1:56:10] have to whatever it
[1:56:13] takes amen Genesis chapter 15
[1:56:17] quickly this is the promise being
[1:56:20] revealed to Abraham before his name is
[1:56:23] changed and the Lord is confirming this
[1:56:25] promise to him he puts Abraham to sleep
[1:56:28] and shows him a vision with this uh
[1:56:32] hepher he brings a sacrifice and he he
[1:56:35] brings his the hepher of three years old
[1:56:37] the she goat three years old and uh the
[1:56:40] ram of three years old and the turtle
[1:56:42] dove and the young pigeon he took them
[1:56:46] unto all of these and divided them in
[1:56:49] the mid verse 10 and laid each piece
[1:56:52] against one another but the birds
[1:56:54] divided he not verse 11 and when the
[1:56:56] fouls came down upon the carcass Abram
[1:56:59] Abram drove them away and when the sun
[1:57:03] was going down a deep sleep fell upon
[1:57:04] Abram and L A horror a great Darkness
[1:57:08] fell upon him and he said unto Abram
[1:57:11] know of assurity that thy seed shall be
[1:57:15] a stranger in the land that is not
[1:57:17] theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[1:57:20] shall afflict them 400 years this is
[1:57:25] before Jacob this is before Joseph this
[1:57:28] is before all the years of plenty this
[1:57:30] is before Pharaoh's dream this is before
[1:57:32] we Egypt gets fat all of this God
[1:57:35] already showed it to Abram verse 14 and
[1:57:39] also that Nation whom they Shall Serve
[1:57:42] will I judge and afterwards shall they
[1:57:45] come out with great substance and thou
[1:57:48] shalt go to thy father fathers in peace
[1:57:50] Thou shalt be buried in a good old age
[1:57:52] but in the fourth
[1:57:54] generation
[1:57:56] what they shall come hither again for
[1:57:59] the iniquity of the amorites is not yet
[1:58:05] full so this is right in line with the
[1:58:10] hardening of Pharaoh's
[1:58:13] heart the
[1:58:14] iniquity has to be at a certain level
[1:58:18] before God can do what he said he was
[1:58:20] going to
[1:58:21] do I mean it's not so it's not it's
[1:58:25] filthy but it's not filthy
[1:58:29] enough it's crazy but it needs to get
[1:58:35] crazier we had two or three pastors that
[1:58:37] was in it for 40 years backslide we need
[1:58:40] three or four more of those big
[1:58:44] names following the word following the
[1:58:47] message it's not enough we need we need
[1:58:50] we need the iniquity to arise we need
[1:58:52] the unbelief to rise and these people
[1:58:55] continue on and they rise and God allows
[1:58:59] it and the True Believer knows and
[1:59:02] expect it to be
[1:59:06] there and the false believer their
[1:59:09] hearts Harden more Harden more more
[1:59:14] resentful more uh combative more
[1:59:20] disagreeable here more people leaving
[1:59:24] the message than ever before it seems it
[1:59:27] seems I've only been around for 30 Years
[1:59:31] or or more something like that I've seen
[1:59:33] a few things some of you have been in it
[1:59:36] all your life you've seen a few things
[1:59:39] I've never seen it like
[1:59:42] this it's
[1:59:44] like it's like everything is being
[1:59:47] reinterpreted or that used to mean that
[1:59:49] but they don't mean that no
[1:59:52] more they keep changing the rules of the
[1:59:56] game we used to be able to say Amen
[1:59:59] because we heard what he said but we
[2:00:01] ain't hearing the same thing no
[2:00:04] more tremendous but God said that would
[2:00:07] be
[2:00:08] here so that the
[2:00:11] iniquity and the
[2:00:13] cup has to get Fuller and
[2:00:17] Fuller and fully but there
[2:00:20] Folly will be made known now how does
[2:00:24] this Folly become made known the Folly
[2:00:28] is made known by our stand on the
[2:00:33] word remember Janice and jambus they
[2:00:37] stood through those first three little
[2:00:39] tests the rod with the serpent the blood
[2:00:43] in the water and the frogs they couldn't
[2:00:46] take them away but when it came to the
[2:00:48] lice and the other things they had to
[2:00:50] step back they actually said out of
[2:00:52] their mouth this they told Pharaoh this
[2:00:54] is the Finger of
[2:00:56] God it's like
[2:01:00] what in the beginning we right with him
[2:01:02] oh we can do that next man oh we can do
[2:01:05] that this is the Finger of
[2:01:09] God and that's what the word will do if
[2:01:11] you stay with that word my brother my
[2:01:14] sister you don't have to be the most
[2:01:15] talented you don't have to have the mic
[2:01:17] in your hand every serice
[2:01:19] everybody don't even have to even know
[2:01:21] you even exist all you got to do is find
[2:01:26] a portion of God's word and hold on to
[2:01:30] it until he calls you home hold
[2:01:34] on hold on until he calls you
[2:01:40] [Applause]
[2:01:42] home
[2:01:46] Lord and that's what I'm trying to do
[2:01:48] this morning
[2:01:50] I'm trying to hold on until he calls me
[2:01:55] home their Folly will be made
[2:01:57] manifest can I take 10 more minutes it's
[2:02:01] not even 12:00 yet okay
[2:02:04] Saints the God of this evil age brother
[2:02:07] bandam says this in paragraph 174 see
[2:02:11] trying to keep you from seeing the real
[2:02:13] meaning of the word see he's
[2:02:15] interpreting it saying it means this God
[2:02:18] said I promised in the last days I send
[2:02:21] you Malachi 4 it don't have to be
[2:02:25] interpreted he did it he said as it was
[2:02:29] in the days of lot the world will be in
[2:02:31] solom condition and in that time I will
[2:02:34] reveal the son of man by it exactly we
[2:02:38] got all kinds of
[2:02:41] impersonations everything else of it but
[2:02:44] we got the real one too see he said he
[2:02:48] would do it he said the Antichrist would
[2:02:51] rise up and almost deceive the elected
[2:02:53] if it was possible but said let them
[2:02:56] alone let them go ahead their Folly will
[2:02:59] be found out why the word test proves
[2:03:05] it thank you Lord the word
[2:03:09] test when it comes to that word that had
[2:03:13] been backed this way and that oh I don't
[2:03:16] believe in serpy I don't believe in this
[2:03:18] that and here brother it's never been
[2:03:20] revealed see no never oh brother just
[2:03:23] look where you're we're going to have to
[2:03:25] close and he continues
[2:03:27] on
[2:03:30] Hallelujah yes their Folly will be made
[2:03:35] manifest because the
[2:03:37] word
[2:03:39] test proves
[2:03:41] it now Satan cannot stay with the
[2:03:46] word word by word cannot do it he can
[2:03:50] impersonate any kind of a
[2:03:52] gift but he can't stay with the word
[2:03:56] hallelujah Monday Tuesday and
[2:03:59] Wednesday he can make the Sunday
[2:04:02] morning uh jelly donut service free
[2:04:06] coffee meeting he can make that one but
[2:04:09] church again on Wednesday how many times
[2:04:12] y'all going to
[2:04:13] meet and then Sunday night again and
[2:04:17] what y'all doing washing feet for what
[2:04:20] you don't need to wash one another's
[2:04:22] feet that was back in Jesus's time sir
[2:04:26] but Jesus said if you do it happy you'll
[2:04:29] be and so many people ain't happy the
[2:04:32] ones that ain't happy ask them are you
[2:04:35] washing the Saints feet ask
[2:04:40] them I got the Bible for it happy are
[2:04:43] you if you do these
[2:04:45] things talk about Happy Feet yes
[2:04:50] happy are you if you do these things
[2:04:52] that's what Jesus said I can't figure it
[2:04:55] out that's what he
[2:04:58] said Christ is revealed in his own word
[2:05:00] today so confused about the evidence of
[2:05:02] the Holy Ghost paragraph
[2:05:04] 27 Satan can impersonate any kind of a
[2:05:07] gift that God has got but he cannot
[2:05:11] bring that word word by word and when
[2:05:16] we're talking about the word we're
[2:05:17] talking about this word word and we're
[2:05:20] talking about this
[2:05:21] word which includes the
[2:05:24] dreams and the visions and the hunting
[2:05:27] trips and all of
[2:05:29] it I mean we we take it
[2:05:34] all word by
[2:05:37] word brother Israel that was before 47
[2:05:42] or no it was after 63 whatever what year
[2:05:46] was he a prophet again
[2:05:49] somebody help me what year was he a
[2:05:53] prophet pick up your Bible it'll tell
[2:05:55] you in the
[2:05:59] days I will send my
[2:06:03] Prophet to turn your
[2:06:05] heart from what you was believing to the
[2:06:09] original faith of the Saints behold I
[2:06:12] send unto you Elijah who the
[2:06:16] prophet before that great and Dreadful
[2:06:18] day
[2:06:19] of the Lord and He will turn your hearts
[2:06:23] to that original faith and so we stay
[2:06:26] with the word
[2:06:27] amen we stay with it word by word all of
[2:06:33] the
[2:06:34] Visions all of the hunting
[2:06:38] trips even the manuscripts that the
[2:06:42] smart people say don't exist they've
[2:06:45] changing your Bible all the time but we
[2:06:47] stay with it word word by word what
[2:06:52] version Bible do you use the same one
[2:06:54] that God used when he was here in
[2:06:57] flesh and he spoke to us his
[2:07:01] message the King James version you got a
[2:07:03] problem with that I
[2:07:06] don't but the great minds they got a
[2:07:08] problem with that they they that the ESV
[2:07:11] is the one we want to use now or the
[2:07:13] living Bible That's the only one they're
[2:07:15] good good works no criticism against
[2:07:18] them I read from them thank God for them
[2:07:21] they're enlightening they use the
[2:07:23] English language open things up open my
[2:07:26] understanding but God gave us his word
[2:07:28] it's King James virgin what's wrong with
[2:07:31] that what the scholars and the doctors
[2:07:34] says that's not the correct correct
[2:07:36] version well when they get one of these
[2:07:39] pictures they can start talking to me if
[2:07:42] they don't get one of these here then
[2:07:44] that's not where I'm going and that's
[2:07:46] not being a smart Al that's just being
[2:07:48] like I don't know a giraffe in the days
[2:07:51] of
[2:07:53] Noah that got on the
[2:07:55] ark or a mouse or whatever animal that
[2:07:59] got on the ark what intelligence did
[2:08:01] they use to get on the ark and Men grown
[2:08:05] men educated men couldn't see Noah's
[2:08:09] message no matter how smart I am or you
[2:08:12] are anybody else are you in the
[2:08:15] ark are you in the word of the Lord
[2:08:19] it's a higher level than what we want to
[2:08:21] think it is there's no mistakes in this
[2:08:25] word it's a perfect Bible is actually
[2:08:28] perfect be careful be careful about this
[2:08:31] they there's some straight up
[2:08:33] inconsistencies based on who first of
[2:08:36] all your sticky dirty hands trying to
[2:08:39] look for a mistake in it you've
[2:08:41] contaminated it while you're trying to
[2:08:43] look for it the mistake is in you God
[2:08:46] sent his word and God watched over his
[2:08:51] word and if there was anything that
[2:08:53] needed to be corrected God would have
[2:08:55] corrected it
[2:08:59] himself so I can take
[2:09:02] confidence in my
[2:09:05] Bible you listen to them Scholars out
[2:09:07] there they'll have you disbelieve in
[2:09:09] your Bible it's not all true it's true
[2:09:12] Saints it will you listen to some people
[2:09:15] they'll have you not believ in all of
[2:09:17] the message
[2:09:21] even the church age
[2:09:23] book oh yes I'm there now I might as
[2:09:25] well say it they got a problem some got
[2:09:28] a problem with the church age book and I
[2:09:31] came into the message you know the first
[2:09:33] thing I read was a church age
[2:09:36] book it got a hold of me brother Ike I
[2:09:40] actually believed it and I kept going on
[2:09:43] kept moving on with the Lord and then
[2:09:45] somebody told me a few years later a
[2:09:46] year or two later that rever so and so
[2:09:49] said that brother so and so said that
[2:09:50] brother bam said to bur him there's
[2:09:53] lel's book somebody said that and so I
[2:09:56] had my church age book but I was like ah
[2:09:59] yeah but
[2:10:00] maybe and I did that for a couple of
[2:10:03] years and finally I said you know Israel
[2:10:07] go to and see what brother brandham said
[2:10:09] about the church so I
[2:10:12] did I went in looking what he said about
[2:10:14] the church a book and guess what guess
[2:10:17] whose book it is
[2:10:19] H that's what he
[2:10:22] said so in order for me to change that
[2:10:25] position I'd have to listen to somebody
[2:10:27] else and I'm not willing to do that
[2:10:30] thank the Lord thank the Lord oh
[2:10:35] my amen don't you love the
[2:10:38] Lord we know where to stand don't we we
[2:10:41] know these things that are happening God
[2:10:43] said it in his word that it would be
[2:10:45] there we know that these things are
[2:10:47] supposed to to be here so we expect him
[2:10:49] to be here and then also we know how to
[2:10:54] meet this day and these
[2:10:57] challenges with
[2:10:59] faith we meet the day with the word of
[2:11:03] the day and we stay steady with the word
[2:11:06] of the day and then Monday and Tuesday
[2:11:09] you might have not have the same friends
[2:11:12] and then Wednesday and Thursday the
[2:11:14] crowd changes again and then Friday and
[2:11:17] Saturday some might come back some might
[2:11:19] change their mind we don't know do
[2:11:22] we but when Jesus calls us home I want
[2:11:25] to be right in this
[2:11:30] word waiting on the coming of the
[2:11:34] Lord their Folly will be made manifest I
[2:11:38] want to finish this last quote here this
[2:11:40] last part of this message as the Lord
[2:11:44] prophesied to Abraham and told him that
[2:11:46] in the fourth generation
[2:11:49] this would take
[2:11:50] place so in Souls that are in prison now
[2:11:53] brother random deals with this in
[2:11:55] paragraph 308 and he says this here
[2:11:57] again also in Genesis 15:16 if you want
[2:12:00] to put it down he told Abraham over in
[2:12:03] the land of the amorites their
[2:12:05] iniquity they were Gentiles now I can't
[2:12:08] take you in there right now cuz the
[2:12:11] iniquity of the amorites the Gentiles is
[2:12:15] not foled up yet but I will judge them
[2:12:20] I'll come in that fourth generation then
[2:12:22] I'll judge that Nation with a rod of
[2:12:25] iron is that right has it been so long
[2:12:28] that God's
[2:12:29] longsuffering the ministry constantly
[2:12:32] through tape and everything else has
[2:12:34] combed across the world to see if there
[2:12:37] is one more but maybe the last one come
[2:12:40] in just recently has it been the
[2:12:43] iniquity that's been so long if Jesus is
[2:12:46] the same which he Hebrews 138 his
[2:12:48] message must be the same same his action
[2:12:52] must be the same if the first and second
[2:12:55] pool is without question is there a
[2:12:57] question in your mind about the first
[2:13:00] and second pool did it come to pass just
[2:13:03] like he said congregation says yes says
[2:13:06] amen then why question the third why
[2:13:10] would you question it well because
[2:13:12] somebody online said that somebody
[2:13:14] online said that somebody on the
[2:13:16] internet said put it down Saints just
[2:13:19] let it go let them continue why would
[2:13:22] you question it the first two was
[2:13:23] identified by the scripture I Pro I
[2:13:26] proved it to you this morning that the
[2:13:28] third is identified by the scripture too
[2:13:31] look upon the
[2:13:32] world see where she's at look how they
[2:13:35] have rejected the truth and how it's
[2:13:37] been properly identified The Prophecy
[2:13:40] part now where are we at oh God be
[2:13:44] merciful that makes my heart bleed on
[2:13:47] the inside
[2:13:48] what about it where we
[2:13:52] at amen he deals with this fourth
[2:13:56] generation in the church age book my
[2:13:59] last quote here he
[2:14:05] says in the Ephesian Church age he says
[2:14:07] Revelations
[2:14:11] 2:4 this message is is to the entire age
[2:14:15] which lasted about 120 years its message
[2:14:19] then is to all generations in that span
[2:14:23] Now history keeps repeating itself in
[2:14:26] the generations of Israel we see Revival
[2:14:29] in one generation only to see the fires
[2:14:32] fading in the next in the third
[2:14:35] generation Embers may be glowing
[2:14:37] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[2:14:40] no vestage whatsoever of that original
[2:14:43] flame then God lights the fire again and
[2:14:48] the same process is repeated it is
[2:14:52] simply the manifestation of the truth
[2:14:55] that God has no
[2:14:57] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[2:15:00] by natural birth anymore than that
[2:15:02] there's truth to the apostolic
[2:15:05] seccession it isn't in the word you
[2:15:07] start out with truly Born Again
[2:15:09] Believers and when the next Generation
[2:15:11] comes along they are no longer just
[2:15:13] plain Christians but they have taken the
[2:15:16] denominational name or now B apst
[2:15:18] Methodist
[2:15:19] Etc that is exactly what they are too
[2:15:23] they are not Christians you have to be
[2:15:25] born of the will of God not the will of
[2:15:28] man to be saved but these folks are all
[2:15:31] coming together now by the will of man I
[2:15:34] don't say that some of them aren't right
[2:15:36] with God not for a minute do I say that
[2:15:38] but the original fire has died down they
[2:15:41] are not the same
[2:15:44] anymore so our desire our prayer is
[2:15:48] Lord light the fire
[2:15:51] again light it up in my soul again keep
[2:15:56] this word the expectation of the word on
[2:16:00] fire so I can meet the challenge of this
[2:16:03] day by faith I know the iniquity the cup
[2:16:07] of the amorites has to fill up has to
[2:16:10] get more sinful more wicked more
[2:16:13] horrible great Ministries fall it's got
[2:16:16] to be that way I actually expected to be
[2:16:19] be that way but now my faith is now
[2:16:21] anchored in the word and I
[2:16:25] desire for another outpouring of the
[2:16:28] Holy Spirit you know we rarely hear that
[2:16:31] in our prayers
[2:16:32] anymore Lord send us
[2:16:35] Revival in The Message Church it seems
[2:16:38] quite odd vernacular to say Lord send
[2:16:41] this church a Revival but we need a
[2:16:44] Revival and if we don't need one I need
[2:16:47] one
[2:16:48] one and that's the way it is I need a
[2:16:52] Revival to get me out of here for the
[2:16:55] coming of the Lord for the Rapture for
[2:16:58] the resurrection God help us amen don't
[2:17:02] be afraid to pray that prayer my brother
[2:17:03] and my sister Lord send me a Revival
[2:17:06] send me an outpouring a
[2:17:08] refreshing oh God let it happen today
[2:17:12] even God bless you let us pray Heavenly

[2:17:40] what some may think about us
[2:17:44] and pressures from this way way or that

[2:17:52] group but oh Lord Jesus focus our eyes
[2:17:56] back on you

[2:18:01] time that we're
