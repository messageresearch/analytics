TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] okay all right can we all stand we'll start our Sunday school we're going to be listening to the fifth seal this morning a portion of it starting at paragraph 118 and then we'll be reading from Revelation chapter 6 verse 9 10 and 11 let's all pray first father God we're thankful that we can be here this morning we're thankful Lord for the blood that covers Us the blood of Jesus Christ Lord makes us to stand holy and righteous in thy sight not works of our own right but all that you have done for us Lord we pray this morning Lord that you would just come and be with us Lord let thy presence be felt let thy anointing take the word of God and just speak to our hearts father and change us from glory to glory into your image we thank you Lord this morning that we know who Jesus is Lord and and what you have done for us and we accept that father Lord just bless the Sunday School classes Lord the reading of your word everything that would be said and done this morning Lord help us to be alert and attentive and to do all of thy will focused on you oh God and ready for service we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ amen Revelation 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw unto the alt I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true thust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little Seas season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be finished let's sing only believe only be only be all things are possible [Music] only be only be only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Randa I just wish that some great Theologian explain to me how this world stands in arbit I wish you could scientifically throw me a ball in the air turning let it make the second revolution in the same place you couldn't do it and yet this is so perfectly timed till they can tell the eclipse of the Sun to the minute 20 years from now they a't got a a watch or a clock or any piece of Machinery that that's perfect and yet it stands there and then leaning backwards what if it straightened up a little bit you just make yourself silly see so you see don't try to get wisdom to understand just believe what he said The more simpler you can get then there you are you'll find it now I'm so thankful for that thankful that he is has made his simple now we find the sixth chapter and the ninth verse let me start now and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony they H notice there is no mention of another Beast or a living living creature to this announcement of the fifth seal I remember there was on the fourth seal there was on the first seal second third and fourth but none here see if you notice let's just read back one of the seals let's go back to the four seal and that's the seventh verse and when he had opened the four seal I heard the voice of the fourth be Sav come SE when he open the third seat I heard the voice of the of the third Beast say come and see yeah of the second beast come and see and the first Beast they come and see but then when we get to the fifth seal there's no Beast I just noticed and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar right quick there's no there's no Beast there and a beast represents power we know that see there's no living creature now one of those creatures we find out in studying the the the Revelation in the churches that the one of them had uh was a line and the other one the other one was an ox and the other one was a man and the other one was an eagle we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the acts of the Apostle just the way that the um the uh Tabernacle in the wilderness and you understand it because I won't take time going to it how we draw it out here and showed just exactly they were watching over this the lamb and the word to perform the word just as he did the the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness and so forth now we even positionally show by the tri ible colors of Israel and by the uh how many heard the SE the seven Church ages I guess most half two-thirds of you notice that even the nature of the Beast was exactly a tribal emblem which way the four the 12 tribes set four on each side uh uh three tribes on each side and the four be set watch these tribes from all four ways and when we went got the gospels and show exactly when you enter into the ark there was a guarden the ark the Covenant and then we find out that the Covenant of the new church its representation on Earth was the Holy Spirit the blood had sent back to us the Holy Ghost and the four Feast represented as the the 12 tribes of Israel as it watch and finding their natures and taking that same nature and bringing it to each one of those four Gospels it exactly was exactly the say one talk to the lion the other the ox the other the four gospels there is the four gospels is the protection of the holy spirit amen I just always wonder it's stuck with me now this is about six years I guess since I heard heard a great man say that that was the The Acts of the Apostles is just the framework I've heard it said many times but to hear a man with his status as a preacher and as a teacher that's wrote some of the famous books that the people read everywhere and to say that the Acts of the Apostles wasn't actually suitable for teaching of the church when the Acts of the Apostles is the very Foundation of not the work the foundation because the Bible says that the the the the foundation of God is built upon the doctrine of the Apostles chist the the Cornerstone and when this fell stood there and made that remark I I just my heart just failed I thought no wonder well I see now in the seals it just wasn't revealed that's all you so there there there was stand there but something is saying that now notice they guard now when we got Matthew 28:19 and run that thing down through Matthew which represent the line and coming in there we found exactly why they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and there he was standing there with that very scripture to guard the sacred Trust of the baptism of the name Jesus [Music] Christ well I'm getting off on the church ages now notice but here when we come to this fifth seal now there's there's there's no Rider Goes Forth and there's no Beast to announce it John just the lamb opened it and John saw it there was no one there to say now come look come see notice the old power of the living creature are there's and on the six seal there is no Beast to announce it on the seven seal there's no Beast to announce it no powers to announce it see no one doesn't on the look on the after the four seal there's no Announcement by any beast power from the fifth sixth or seventh seal not at all now notice I love this as in the times of the rider of the four horses the rider Singler of the four different horses there was a beast that announce the power every time the Riders straddle another horse and come forth to ride another kind of a Beast come out and announced it that's a great mystery that is the mystery why announcing the mystery why isn't there one here on the fifth seal to announce it here it is according to the Revelation that the Lord Jesus gave me today or this morning early that is that the mystery of the church ages are already finished at this time the mystery of the Antichrist is revealed at this time the Antichrist took his last ride and we found him on these Pale Horse mixed with these many colors and rides all the way into predition we get on the trumpets and so forth when to teach that I go to it now but we get Plum off the subject again and we we go he rides that's the reason there's no one there now we know written call some reason for something I remember at The First beginning I said they can't be nothing without a reason remember the little drop of ink now you got to find the reason for some reason they didn't have to have a beast or power to announce the seal being broke and Only God Can Ral why amen that's all because it's all all Lays in him but the reason that he Reve feels that I as I understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the Antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at [Music] all that's right there they're way in the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of Revelations and does not return till it comes back with this King in the 19th Chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be see and now what was to be for the church age was revealed by uh the seals and now watch what takes it the the four stages of his writer has been revealed the four stages of the Antichrist writing has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have to have anymore and there was four living creatures of God to announce a rider as they wrote four beasts are four powers now now we know that Beast by interpretation of the terms of the Bible symbols means power now let's get that close the four are beast in the Bible represents a power among the people now if we find out like in Daniel when he saw a certain uh Nation rise up it it would be a maybe a bear holding a rib in his side symbol then he seen another Power raise up a goat it represented something and he seen another Power raise up and and it was a leopard with so many heads it represent a certain Kingdom then he saw another rise up a great line with teeth and and stomp the residue that represent a different Power all together one was a a kingdom of uh Nebuchadnezzar and another type of of a dream Daniel saw a vision Nebuchadnezzar Dreamed a Dream but Daniel interpret his dream and was correctly with the vision amen oh if you just know what happened what happened before we left here you understand while six straight dreams cut exactly with the vision amen a dream interpreted is a vision because a person not maybe being born but the subconscious to stay be awake when he sees it then God guts over this subconscious and speaks to him which he promised that in dreams in the last days he'd visit people and also in Visions see now a Visions when you're Wide Awake standing right like this and certain things are revealed you stand tell it just right about it see what happened and what's going to be and so forth but now A Dream is when you are asleeping your five senses are inactive and in your in your subconscious you're somewhere because when you come back you remember where you've been remembered all your life so it's your subconscious then an arsty is coners enough sh used to say you can't be something that you hate and that's just about right see and then if you're born to sear now you see to do that those both consciences has to be right together not one here with five senses active other not you're when you're sleeping the five senses are not active but you see when both of them you're born right together you don't go to sleep you just go from one to the other like like that you don't go to sleep there's not enough room to go to sleep and you can't make yourself that way so gifts and callings are predestinated of God they they are God's gifts and callings even without repentance the Bible says see they were ordained before the foundation of the world see now now we find out that the are beast of d Danel it meant that it was a power raising up amongst the people all right and and John's Visions here also showed that it was power as Nations raising up like the United States appears in Revelations 13 as a lamb and then U if you want to know a different you say well that's talk about National Power it also represents holy power too a beast did you know that notice Rebecca when uh when the the servant of uh Abraham elar when he came to get Bea Rebecca she he mounted her up on a camel the very camel she watered and she rode this camel to meet her unseen bridegroom the very thing she watered was a thing that tuck her to her future home and husband it's the same thing today see the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes aivee and cares is to our unseen bridegroom see and look how perfectly uh Isaac had left the home and was out in the field away from his home when Rebecca saw him and the church meets Christ in the air and then he takes her back into the home father's home where the Mansions are prepared Isaac took Rebecca the same way and notice it was love at the first sight oh my she just run to meia that's way the church will meet Christ in the air and forever be with you now turn to the Bible these Beast are powers notice I want now I want you to notice the devil had his four uh changing colored Beast to go forth on he had his four Beast that was all three of them put into the color of one and made that one um a Pale Horse a white horse red horse black horse and we seen each one of those was a stage of his ministry a stage of the early church that had formed into a denomination at Nia the original Pentecostal Church Upon whom the Holy Ghost is poured out coming down took up an antichrist Spirit formed an organization gave birth to some Daughters of organization changed his power three times and and want and made a Pale Horse and then given a name called death and rode him into eternity just as plain as it can be no now notice he's given this this horse and he riding God God has also as every time I watch when the Antichrist appeared first what did he appear in White Horse innocence he could be just a doctor in the church wanted Fellowship your fellowship's with Christ but they wanted a fellowship they just couldn't stand it they want to get the well you know like little clicks will rise up in the church you you know you pastors they like to say birds of a feather but if we're born again Brethren that that's not the attitude to take no now we uh we we if we see something wrong in our Brethren let us just pray and keep it before God and love that man till we bring him right into the presence of God see that's way really the way to do it you know Jesus said there will be weeds in there because Jesus said it would be but don't pull him up you take the wheat with it just let him alone he'll do let him do this segregating when the time comes let it all grow together notice as the Beast went out uh the Antichrist went out on a beast his power oh I love this all this begin to feel religious right now see baby the stimulation notice and the Antichrist all them them Revelations and the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in a room oh brother although I've seen since a child every time it comes near me to alarms he almost put in unconscious condition you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred notice as the an Christ went for on his Beast of ministry there God sent forth a beast to combat it see I watch then every time the Beast rode on his horse the Antichrist rode on his horse on his Beast to announce his ministry God sent his Beast also his on that to announce his combat to it now the scripture says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it and so when the enemy went out as an antichrist God sent a certain type of power out to need him and then when they he went out again as a red horse rider another color another Power another Ministry God sent another anry the combat at the holy church sent the third one again God sent his third be coming announc it he sent the fourth one God sent his fourth one and then the Antichrist end and the church ages ended too at that time watch now oh this is really good [Music] h h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] [Music] h all [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] h [Music] [Music] amen welcome everyone out this morning we're so glad to have each of you with us those

appreciate him this morning we ask the Lord to bless him amen yes sir so at this time let's receive him and put those hands together for the Lord for our dear brother amen God bless you you can D there God bless you it's good to be here bless appreciate uh brother Israel's kind hospitality yesterday and uh it's it's just good to be here I'm going to attempt to sing a song and some of you olders will remember this song it was popular back in the 50s but the words have been changed to fit the Christian experience amen and uh so you'll recognize it and uh hope I can get through it it's it's a beautiful song my life was like a ship an empty Crest with no assurance and my soul was bound for hell what love I'd known had no endurance and I had no Guiding Light i' never known a bright and clear day and this this emptiness yes this was my way and regrets I I've had a few my Joys were few and so evasive and the world with all its charms with open arms seem so persuasive and I had no peace of mind no happiness no True Deliverance [Music] and this this emptiness yes this was my way for what is this life what is it worth if all our Joys lay on this Earth a world that's filled with loneliness a world of hate and godly less to think all this this emptiness yes this was my way this is my favorite verse but then God he showed me his son his son who died on calvary's mountain and I saw the Crimson Tide flow from his side oh redeeming Fountain and I heard his voice cry out father it's done redemption's [Music] fished and God in tenderness said this is my way and and one day he'll come this risen Christ who gave himself a sacrifice and all the world will know his name and every tongue his praise shall bring and on that day I'm going to shout and sing I Did It Go God way for the record shows I took life's blows and I did it God's way now some of you are looking at me like what did he just think but God has a way and man has a way amen let's turn to Ezekiel the 36 chapter Ezekiel 36 you may stand for the reading of God's word is Ezekiel 36 again I appreciate brother Israel for giving me the opportunity to share a few things this morning and I hope something I say touches your heart Ezekiel 36 and we'll start with verse 26 and 27 Ezekiel seen in the spirit here he says uh a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of you out of your flesh and will give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you so notice he says I'm going to give you a new heart and a new spirit then on top of that I want to put my spirit within you hello and I want you to notice something particular seed cannot fall on a Stony heart that's why some people when you talk to them about the gospel of the message they got a Stony heart they can't receive it there has to be a heart transplant I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them 2 Corinthians 5:17 second Corinthians 5 17 very common scripture with the Saints 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore everybody have it therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or creation a regeneration you know you look at the Greek they say that's a in the Greek that's metamorphous from a caterpillar to a butterfly hello you know it's a marvelous thing that God has in his creation certain things depicting a new birth because that caterpillar is Earthbound but once it goes to that molten stage all of a sudden it can fly and the monarchs can fly from Canada all the way down to Mex Mexico you know regeneration old things are passed away behold all things have become new father just take these few words now in jesus' name and let them penetrate the heart of your people Lord help us to receive and Lord help me to just get out of the way and hide in the shadow of the Cross and Lord as I always ask Lord if you want to interrupt the service any time to touch someone Lord you are more than welcome to have preeminence you are more than welcome to touch that weary soul that needs a touch from you we've already felt your presence this morning I like that kind of atmosphere that that ought to be common in our churches I love that atmosphere Lord so Lord I just ask you right now to just take these words and use them for your glory in Jesus name and the Saints said amen you may be seated I want to take a thought this morning we're talking about a new heart a new spirit and uh I want to take a quote and I didn't bring it I don't have it but you'll all be familiar with it on questions and answers in the seals brother Brenham is talking about a man that he could take with the scriptures and he could twist him you know and and really you know he he could do something with this man because brother Braham had more knowledge than him and then all of a sudden he goes oh he didn't like that how many familiar with that quote he said he didn't like that he said I'm projecting myself in it and I'm not in the picture at all that's right he said he said now I could tell that man different but he said you you know when you've done something wrong because it's like tuning a fine instrument and that's what we want to talk about this morning throughout your Christian walk God is fine-tuning the inst strument hello remember the prophet's in the 50s he's going through the seals he's not an immature man he's a seas and preacher and Prophet but yet God's still fine-tuning it oh yes and we need to be sensitive sometimes in our life that God wants to fine-tune no matter what age you are in Christ he's going to fine-tune it because he wants usefulness productivity he wants something more than just a churchgoer you want something more than just War warm the pew how many love brother Joel hello but he does he wants productivity we're going to talk about that a little bit this morning so I'm gonna I'm G to deal with four issues this morning about fine-tuning the instrument okay the first one is something that I've asked a great portion of my life as a Christian I've asked Lord God please give me a heart that's tender give me a heart that's broken that's tender because I've noticed with the body of Christ and you see it out there in politics religion the educational system Hollywood you see it out there but in the church sometimes I've seen a hardness develop upon the people or the preacher that's good see if you do things mechanically I don't care if it's lead songs or preach if if you do things live out your and you do it mechanically after a while gets boring you'll get burnout because the joy of the Lord has creeped away from the body of Christ hello huh and you're doing things mechanically and then in the spirit and I just want to I just want to touch on something I'm gon to get off my notes for here for a second but you folks that are real spiritual and don't think you ought to have emotion hello or or it's not about feeling everybody listening to me let's go to the prophet on the platform and he's he's wanting to minister after he preaches but he's waiting on the Lord sometimes it takes a few minutes sometimes it takes 20 but BR brother brandom is waiting for a feeling hello because when that Pillar of Fire stands here and the angel stand I think it's on the the right side there is a feeling hello a feeling you cannot live a Christian walk without feelings or emotion the prophet said if you don't have emotion bury it hello hello either Buri it or resurrected or revive it do something because it ain't useful if you're just going through the mechanics hello so a tender heart a tender heart of Brokenness and this is why it's so important now let's turn to Mark I wasn't going to read this but I was in my motel looking at this last night and I don't know sometimes it's good to just read it so you see it but Hardness of Heart is a sin do you know that Hardness of Heart I used to work concrete years ago because before I realized this is not what I want to do all my life years ago so I changed to be a painter because but uh in in in Mark 6 just one scripture there Jesus is multiplying the Loaves and the fishes and it says in verse 52 I don't want to read the whole thing because you you understand the the the fish and the loaves of the multiplication and 7,000 people is a lot of people and it always says the men you notice that Scholars thinks that there were women and children it's hard to get 7,000 men in the same place without women and children so it's a big crowd and he multiplies the fish and the Lo no notice what it says in verse 52 for they could considered not the Miracles of the low's for their heart was what hardened hardened hardened let's go to Mark 8 now a few months later could have been three or four months later he does the same thing again only there's 4,000 probably plus women and children now watch this same situation too they go across the lake and one of the disciples says Master we haven't taken any food with us we only have one loaf and so Jesus begins to question him how many how many baskets were taken up after I fed the seven how many basket and they told him and notice it what he says here in verse um verse 17 and when Jesus knew it he saith unto them Mark 8:17 why reason ye because you have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have you your heart yet hardened now here's what's important about what we're looking at right here here cuz it's twice in The Book of Mark twice when they saw those that manifestation of Miracles and everybody's belly fed hello do you realize as a son or daughter of God that you can miss a Divine moment because of the condition of your heart it's not fine-tuned hello and you can miss a Divine moment take a look at the prophet's life when he's on the platform and he goes out and there oh sister you you with the polka out a dress such and such and such about your life oh sister you should you should have responded you missed it and then he goes to somebody else that was a Divine moment I met someone here in t tucon years ago that had been in brother Brandon's meetings he was an older gentleman of course then but he said brother Joel I was in a meeting where God's Prophet called me out and I didn't respond and I missed it and he was still sick you can miss God by not responding hello you know when someone gets a breakthrough in the church we call it a breakthrough they get a little touch of heaven and they're screaming and shouting hello the rest of you should be enjoying that bow your head or lift your hand because when someone Rejoice we all Rejoice so we don't sit there and go what's the matter with her a fanatic dropped in I'm quoting the prophet on that um hello no you should all Rejoice because someone's getting a breakthrough see you don't know if that sister has been oppressed or depressed that week and she's at thoughts of suicide and she needs that and there's probably others that need it too but you're sitting there and you're mechanical and you're not in you're not in that Divine moment because the heart's not tuned we don't come to church just to stare at the ceiling or who's dressed and what we come we need a touch from heaven we need a touch in the Holy Ghost we need a touch from Heaven if there's one place we ought to feel God it's in this building hello this ought to be a place where people come in they they can feel God hello yes sir and what is a minister he's trying to or song leader they're trying to press through the veil because we come in with all that unbelief and doubt and a hardened heart or we have conditions and our hearts not tuned and we're trying to break through that Veil because we know if we break through that ve someone's gonna get a shout in the camp someone might get up and dance the problem said dance is a side of Victory hello did you did you know the prophet made a statement I'd like to see the church so drunk in the Holy Ghost they don't even know their own name hello huh I mean some of those old Saints used to get so drunk in the Holy Ghost they'd have to pick him up take him to the car and take him up they'd be drunk in the Holy Ghost for days sit speaking in tongues and you know hello amen there may be a few people brother Israel after the service you might have to give them smelling Sals or call the paramedics but you know hello this should be common amongst us huh we ain't a bunch of Baptists with a message of Presbyterians hello all right a tender heart now let's go to Mark 16 we always go to Mark 16 and quote these signs shall follow them that believe but let's let's look at it from a different spec perspective this morning Mark 16 here we have these women they run to the Grave right and then they come back and say he's alive the tomb's empty he's alive and they didn't believe it right then two walk to the road EMAs that might have been quite a conversation because it's I think it's about six miles or more to Emmas and then they came back but on the road with Jesus and the Bible said he took on another form hello and and they they're walking with Jesus he's opening up Moses and the Psalms and the prophets and they're feeling this Burning inside they're feeling this anointing there's something different about this man where talking to us and then when they get there he disappears and they run back and they tell him we've seen the Lord he's risen he he talked to us they didn't believe it they didn't believe it watch what Jesus does verse 14 of Mark 16 afterward he appeared into the lean as they sat him meat and abided them he ided he scold them like like they were naughty children huh he abraded them because of their unbelief and their Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen see that's not a fine tun heart because a fine-tuned heart if someone's telling you about an experience they had or something going on you'll go wow that's beautiful brother man I enjoyed that huh hello because you through your week you're fine-tuning that heart through the months and years you're fine- tuning that heart because you know I've often told people a a as you the closer you get to God and there's an intimacy there and you fine-tune that heart you can get in the presence of God in seconds did you hear me seconds but you have to learn the skill of condescending where the Prophet said you get little and God gets big hello and he said it's hard for a human being to do that we got all this self-importance you know just ask me hello I mean I met preachers dear God they're the most important thing on the planet just ask them I'm going to tell you something the prophet said God don't need you but you sure need him does that put in perspective because you see we're Irreplaceable I don't know if you know that you know but yet at the same time brother Israel if God trains you and equips you for years he doesn't want to lose that because you have a train in you that takes years so if you have a God has a plan for your life he might knock you upside the head put you in the hospital do a lot of things to get you humbled where he can use that vessel for his glory hello amen a tender heart this is why Hosea in the 10th chapter Hosea says he talks about breaking up the fow ground this is one of Charles finny's favorite M scriptures break up the fow ground because it's time to seek the Lord fow ground is ground that's been teed and B bore crops but it's Lin dormant for years it has pests bugs and weeds hello like the human heart gets amen oh I ain't got no weeds oh please hello I know Human Nature Jesus said he knew the hearts of men and we all need sometimes an altar service we all need a place where we can get alone with God and lay on our face and say God Empty Me forgive me cleanse me Wash Me In The Blood because I see too much of myself and not you break up the fow ground it's time to seek the Lord amen a tender heart a a tender broken heart God is well pleased hello let's continue you could take a service just on each one of these a pure heart another thing I've asked Lord over the years is Lord give me a pure heart I want a pure heart I want to be able to look at a congregation or or my wife or or or my family or whoever it might be that I got a clean heart a pure heart I ain't watching pornography over here at night and then trying to preach oh please hello you know I'm tell you something Hollywood has never been a friend of the church I don't know if you know that or not but it's true hello I mean someone that tells me they can watch R-rated movies X-rated movies watch all sorts of fleshly violent cussing stuff and then tell me I got the Holy Ghost no you don't because if you have the spirit of God in you there's no way with a pure heart you can watch that no way no way and look at this President Administration we have never seen such a flood of Filth and ungodliness and I'm going to tell you something as a Son of God with the spirit of God that's going to bother you if you've got God living inside of you yes you're going to be troubled of what's going on in this nation because you see it in the education Hollywood politics I mean Obama lit up the White House with a rainbow this man has these ungodly creatures that came out of the dark caves and he's pimping them in the White House lawn huh it's not normal Sodom and Gomorrah brought judgment on their heads because of that and you should as a son daughter of God be troubled what's going on in our nation and the things that are going on you should be troubled and it should put you on your knees once in a while my God give me a pure heart because the prophet made this statement on Feast of the trumpets in 64 he say those 200 million spirits that were released that drove the Jews back to their Homeland those Spirits have a influence on the church you ever read that huh that's why you see School CH shootings Church shootings you see all this violence across the land this anti-jew those are demon spirits that the demonic spirits you're seeing manifested hello I mean think about it just the news media loone which you know when when Jesus was taken up and Satan showed him all the kingdoms he saw the Republican Kingdom the Democrat Kingdom the Communist Kingdom the Socialist Kingdom he saw Hollywood he saw all these educational he saw everything and and Satan said if you remember it's all about bowing down and worship and control you ever notice that covid was about control and you can't worship huh hello it's always about control and worship huh watch it watch the history a pure heart the pure in heart they shall see and understand God well I just don't see what you're talking about in that message get a pure heart ask God to cleanse it deeper get some intimacy draw closer to Jesus hello get some intimacy with the Lord and all of a sudden the light bulbs will go off wow wow yeah I see it now Lord huh but God's not going to show you part of his kingdom if you got a filthy heart or a double heart huh your cry ought to be God give me a tender heart give me a pure heart God I got to have a pure heart because I've noticed this over the years and I'm I gave my heart to Jesus in 75 and came into this message in 77 I've watched this over the years a sinner can walk through that door and sit in that Pew and discern what's in that preacher in the congregation don't even see it I watch that huh that's why we got to have a pure heart because sometimes people can read you like a book and you don't get it huh you know Sinners have discernment they're not stupid they do a pure heart this number three is to me not something I pray about it just comes natural all right I love a witnessing heart when I first gave my heart to Christ back in 19775 I was living my mom and a drunk boyfriend they they had their own thing going and it was during that time that God put a hunger in my heart I started reading Matthew Mark Luke and John and I was a thief on the cross how many knows when you're a teenager sometime thank God if you're a teenager raising especially to love the Lord know amen there come on come on but you know when you're out there in the world and don't know Christ and haven't been raised in a message hello sometimes your but on stupid and you hold it down do a lot of stupid things some sometimes it's sticks you know got too much CO's beer my my my weed got stuck you know it's stuck huh I know one of the last times I I started you know uh getting away from the the the drug culture I I never did the heavy stuff but you know the weed and the hash that stupid stuff um I you know you know when you're smoking that marijuana you always think you got to hid in the safe place right you smell like I mean you can think you're hiding but they can smell you smoking that marijuana across a block you know and so one of the last times I did that we had a little mouse in our shed where I hid my marijuana and he pooped and peed in the marijuana he just don't how many he knows unless you're really stoned you don't want to use that marijuana hello hello I threw that stuff away hello but God used a mouse hello he might use something in your life to get rid of junk hello be sensitive to it but you know when I gave my heart to Christ I had a supernatural dream after I was reading Matthew Mark Lu and in this dream the pillar of fire was chasing me now at the time I didn't realize that until I came with the message but the pillar of fire this ball it was chasing me and I was running in the dark and how many knows when you're running from the Lord the psalmist said if I run to the ends of the Earth you're there if I run to the deepest hell Lord you're there you can't run anywhere he's going to get you huh and so I remember giving my heart to Jesus and what did I do I turned around and went to all my friends that I used to smoke dope and drink with and I told him I got saved I had a supernatural experience and I gave my heart to Jesus now they may have looked at me like a deer in the headlights but I went to tell them huh why because it's a bread in a son or daughter of God you got to tell how it got lit you see we have a thing in the body of Christ where we have the speaker and The Spectators let me say that again we have the speaker and The Spectators now I'm going to tell you something if you're a spectator and you always absorb and never give out you got health issues spiritual health issues because your DNA is to give out what you absorb there's two lakes in the in Israel one's the Sea of Galilee and one's the Dead Sea water flows into the G Sea of Galilee and flows out that's a healthy Lake but in the Dead Sea water flows in but it never flows out that's the way some people are they can have water flowing in but never flows out and boy what they're critical about things that are going on man that preacher was too long he hello they can be critical but they never give out see the Sea of Galilee is like the Christian who takes in and then he gives out you know you say well brother Joel what can I do I'm just a little housewife or I'm this you know everybody goes to the doctor and dentist takes some spoken word books and put them on the table in that dentist or doctor's office come on and put brother Israel's phone number on there brother George if you don't want a phone call and I know brother Israel would like a phone call ring hello yes I I I had a I I found a book in this doctor's office man it's really tremendous do you have any more of those books yeah brother that would hello I've heard preachers say well you know there's nobody out there that'll receive but they never go and try huh it amazes me how someone wants to go to Africa or India or South America but they won't talk to their neighbor ouch hello see it's in our D DNA to give out it really is you got to share it when's the last time you know when I had a little storefront building up in in in in uh in Phoenix we got the married couples together and we went door to door knocking and invited people to church hello there's something we can do amen now I don't like to do it in July or you know August I'm I'm kind of seasonal you know what I mean but you know you can do something you know they used to in this message PE preachers would put have radio broadcast and play brother's tapes they don't do that much anymore but there's something we can do sure because it's in our DNA amen it is we just love to share I mean think about this I've often said the church age book is one of the greatest documents in human history and this message is the greatest message on planet Earth that a people have ever had now that's not hype that's just truth that's not hype huh and so when I had my storefront building I'll tell you one testimony I have many but I'm watching that time but I have many testimonies there was a brother that I witnessed to and it it probably took three or four months brother George but he was a Hispanic brother real good spirit about him and I would give him a book here and a book there and finally something clicked the light bulb went on you all know what that's like the light bulb comes on and it's not a it's not a 25 watt it's 150 huh hello hello hello I mean how many remember those well I I don't want to get ahead of so so his name was Brother Carlos and and so um he invited me I got an invitation to go to his United Pentecostal Church nice family and there was a woman Pastor how many knows when you're invited to a church and they got a woman Pastor you don't preach on women against women preachers huh the wisdom has totally gone out and the fine tuning is not there praise the Lord so I remember going there and and and preaching and the spirit of God just fell on that congregation they they were Pentecostal and they were dancing and shouting speaking Tong running around that building I don't know what I said but God was gracious well from that on brother Carl and his he had a wife and two kids that came over to the church start going now you know you may differ with me in this but if you just come to the message and start studying it and and and applying it it takes about a year to start seeing the what I call the big picture big picture yeah well he was in it probably four or six months he said brother Joel I want to go to LA I was raed raised on the streets of LA and he he he knew some of the gangs and he really didn't get too much involved in that but he said I I knew a lot of people there in LA and Pasadena he said I want to go over there and share the message I like to be around people like that so for two years we would go back and forth to La we'd take a Friday Saturday and Sunday we we'd preach Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning we go back and forth I came down here brother Jerry amalon was so gracious he let me in his house and we get all the Spanish material we wanted and then we go to La have house meetings share the message hello and it was just a beautiful time and I had people you're going to La the prophet said that's under judgment that's why they need us hello you go where there's a need yes sir yes sir I wasn't intimidated by what the prophet said because I knew I'm a blessed man and not curse so ain't going to happen while I'm there so we would go we did that for two years and I I got an invitation to Assembly of God Church I like to preach in churches outside of the box I really do I got a lot of stories but we went to that little church and the song leader for some reason didn't like me it was a Hispanic church and I don't know you know the prophet said sometimes you carry a different spirit and people just hate you how many's ever had that happen oh yeah they hate you you know and he was leading songs and for some reason there was an attitude there and finally the the woman Pastor she said you need to get down let this brother up there and speak and that's what she he did you know what's interesting I've this over the years if you keep your spirit right I got up there and preached and I do not not know what I preached on but the Holy Ghost fell the man that didn't like me his daughter gave her heart to Jesus I love it I love it huh I'll be honest with you I love it can I tell One More Story along that line there was a black black Apostolic Church in Phoenix and I I was invited to the church by the assistant pastor and I got there and I was invited into the pastor's study they just come off their convention I think it was the last night and uh the pastor started asking me questions what do you believe I said well I believe in the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the oness of the godhead and so forth he said where'd you get that very loving man I said well I I uh heard a Prophet by the name of William brandom and he had had some really beautiful things to share and he looks over his assistance and I can never forget this he go he's a bromite now you know I wasn't intimidated at all because I knew it was a test and what do you do with a test get up and walk out or sit there and go okay Lord you help me now so we went out and they they they sang their songs and gave their testimonies and so forth and then uh he invited me up he said we have a brother here and I want to come up and share a few things I do not again know what I say a lot of times I'll take something like the eagle something kind of inspirational all I know the Holy Ghost fell in that place brother Israel and they started dancing and shouting speaking tongues all over the building after the service the pastor invited me into a study now I sat there and he started confiding to me about the church his life and I sat there and thought wow wow when I was was here a about an hour or two ago he called me a bromite now there's respect it was because of the anointing you know sometimes men don't realize what they got in their midst but I respected him for respecting what took place you know so anyway I would uh go out to LA it was a beautiful time man the spirit of God would move in those little houses meaning we go from house to house to house there was a one brother he was his name was Brother Carlos he was married and had two teenage uh children and I don't believe in the spirit of exaggeration amen but I I I remember G him me and all the most of it was Spanish material I gave him a church age book he wasn't working because he had injured himself in a cooking job and I don't remember but he consumed the church age book between 24 hours and 48 hours cuz told you to do is read it and I thought remember those days folks when you'd read the message like that now it's kind of yeah well that's nice hello hello but he came back with the biggest smile brother Joel because you know when you're locked in that that that cage of Pentecostalism hello and then you see a kingdom man a Jesus man open up the scriptures all of a sudden lik wow wow there was another sister we we would go from house to house and all over the city there and uh you know usually the husband at work but there was two of us and she had like three daughters and we went in her house I started sharing some truths with her and I remember she asking me she said brother she said you mean I can serve Christ and not belong to a denom ination hello because they're so locked into the system they're so locked into it I knew I was in the will of God going to Los Angeles because the state presor to the Spanish churches warned the people stay away from those meetings huh I wasn't intimidated I thought I've got truth to set people free hello can you throw up on the screen Revelation and I'll try to be quick but Revelation 18 1-4 I want to show you something we have Revelation to set people free amen okay go up go up we see this Angel come down from heaven in verse one go to two I want to I want to show you this keep going two notice go down a little bit go down go well down means I want to notice it says Babylon is Fallen The Babylon has fallen and become the habitation the habitation of what what do we say we want a visitation of the Holy Ghost and a habitation of God in our midst but this system of Revelation 17 she was she had a habitation of devils and the hold of every what foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird it was a cage what is a cage it's a place of containment yes so when you go to a zoo what do you see you see places of containment the rattlesnake and the tarantal in a little place as it and this creature gets bigger there in bigger cages but there's still a cage the birds the animals are in cages a lion he's a big cage huh and see this this is what we see in Revelation 17 this church and her daughters we see places of containment the Roman Catholic Church is a small cage and as you move further in Revelation the the Baptist might have a bigger cage in the Presbyterian hello but there's still a habitation of something that in the end time a prophet came along and he said when I preach the church ages I preached against the Deeds of the nicoles and all these things but when I went into the seals I saw the Spirit behind it remember that I saw the Spirit behind it politics and religion the church is political now you'll notice in Revelation go to Revelation 18:23 but you'll notice in those cages in those systems of Pol of political and religion they have merchand I they have merchandise of Ivory and gold and silver and fine Linens hello and slaves and The Souls of men ever been in a system and thought you were just a pawn huh before you came to this message but notice this verse now go down on that verse and I want to read the last part of it for thy Merchant were great men of the earth and by thy sorceries were all nations deceived look at the word sorceries it means controlled by demons hello Paul said seducing spirits and doctrines of devils so when I present this message when someone in a cage no matter how big the cage is it's still a cage I have keys of Revelation and I've watched them work I've seen people give their heart to Christ when I talk to them in the spirit of God followed them I've I've shared this message with different ones and I I've seen the light bulbs go on and and and they walk out of that cage I'm free because truth sets you free and the anointing breaks a you I'm free I'm no longer a Baptist or a presbyterian or simply a God I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and I tell people I want you to call me my my pronouns you say brother Joel what are your pronouns Son of God join Here with Jesus Christ a child of the Living God a priest and a king and of the most high God those are my pronouns huh if the world can get crazy I'm going to get scripture wo Hallelujah [Laughter] so someone asked you do you got a pro down you bet I believe I do huh hallelujah thank you Jesus but I do I love to testify I'm working on a a church right now I'm in Prescot Valley I was talking to a someone I've known for years and and I was up there a couple weeks ago my wife and I had our anniversary our 41st anniversary and so we went up to Prescot and I stopped by this young man's house Bobby and he's married and got a got a seven-year-old daughter and you ever shared this message with someone the truth and you just feel the presence of God in such a way oh and I was sharing things with him and I said Bob your father and your grandfather failed because they stayed in that United Pentecostal I believe there's coming a day when you're going to walk out of that because whom the sun set free they're free indeed when you no longer have the Yoke of the system you're never called by a Blasphemous name now you're called a Son of God a daughter of God and you're free to worship God because someone had opened the door and you're free you're free you're free so I want to go up to that church and they got a Spanish pastor and I want I share some books with them I love doing that and I'm not the best I don't have the greatest faith I no that no it just I've told the Lord if I'm available I'm available I may not be your CH first choice but I want to be available because I love to share this message and open the door of the cage and say come on out come on out look into Jesus is the author and finish of your faith hello bow at his feet okay I'm gonna do the last one now if I say something to offend you just pray for me okay how many still love brother Joel but I want to talk about a few minutes here on our reverence and respect respect toward the things the prophet has said I have noticed and I've been in this since 77 so that's well over 45 years and I've noticed in the past few decades pulpits and people sometimes they show a great disrespect toward things brother brandom says and I want to tell you something and this is very important when brother brandham had the vision of the tent Vision or the white the dream of the white horse rider or or or he talks about the third pull or the seven thunders of the seven seal and all those controversial things hello are you with me people get an attitude that's good brother now now watch this watch this is very important do you remember when you first came in the message I do 77 huh do you know was it cost $4500 to get the complete library of the kets 40 500 that's a lot of money huh we never could afford that but we got all the key tapes you know the key messages in Billy Paul's dream back in 1960 brother B comes to him and and brother B says it's imperative that you hear these certain teachings so some are Evangelistic we love them but there's some key messages that are very important hello hello so so remember those old days when you had that old cassette and you turn it on the prophet would be speaking and you I mean you know you had a lot of wow moments when you first come in the message and and I remember what did he just say stop rewind stop and you'd hear it again because it's all new whether it's no eternal hell hello or some sometimes Jesus was talking and sometimes God was talking hello humanity and Divinity and and he' bring all these little nuggets and I call them the wow moments you know what what did he just say how many had some of those moments huh but you know as you go along you know you get used to the message you get more seasoned and mature hello and then you start sitting under preachers or hearing preachers and you got an attitude toward thus sayith the Lord toward a vision or a dream or something the prophet said you didn't get that attitude off those tapes you got them off some preacher that's [Music] right hello this is why I believe every son and daughter of God that loves this message once in a while needs to get alone with God lay on your face or take a walk and say Lord is there anything I believe or any attitude I have that's contrary to the scriptures because I'll give you a word this morning that you need to hear you if if you have a certain attitude towards something that Prophet said your attitude might have something to do with your destiny wooo I mean look at Abraham Abraham in the fourth chapter of Romans the Bible says honey you don't look to good you kind of have a dead body and she goes well sweetheart you got a dead body there too hello their body was as good as dead they knew it and yet God had promised a child what do you do with that the Bible says hope against hope Abraham believed the promise and it was in imputed unto him for righteousness that's right and when you see a prophet with a vision a dream uh thus sayith the Lord a teaching and you don't understand it that's okay if you came to me and say brother Joel what do you think about this or that I say I I don't know but I believe it because I as a son or daughter as I as a Son of God I want a deep reverence and respect toward that which is sacred and thus sayth the Lord I want a deep respect God didn't ask me if I understand it all but do I believe it then do I respect it because your destiny May ride on your attitude hello man there's some people that believe what I'm saying that's good brother amen It's Not So off- based is it huh I mean think about the Old and New Testament here's a book where all these men are dead and there's still promises and you don't understand some of them does it know the promise because they're dead no hello come on let's have a refresher court and respect and reverence amen amen is God good oh Lord if you'd come to the instruments fine tuning the heart fine tuning the heart a tender heart a heart that's pure a heart that knows how to open its mouth and share with others and you know I'll tell you something about let me you know there's so many things I could share but you know when you share something with someone else it's good sometimes times when you're rejected Jesus said if they do it to a green tree what are they going to do dry it's good to be rejected the prophet said you need to be around someone that differs with you because it help you dig I don't want to be around people that always agree with me hello hello I love brother Israel I really do and brother George and and some of you people are M but I still don't want to be around people that agree with I want to be around people sometimes that oh you're a Jesus freak oh you're a bromite you're you know that's okay that's okay that's all they understand huh don't be intimidated by what people say amen let's let's sing a few songs how many want to learn a new song [Music] well I know it and I don't know if you've ever heard

Revelation 19 and there's one of the few places where God brings judgments and then he says tells the Saints to Rejoice did you know that you're not supposed to Rejoice over the deck of the wicked but when God destroys those kingdoms and that whr of Revelation 17 God says Rejoice ye Saints for that which shed the blood of the martyrs I'm bringing a judgment and I want you to Rejoice because only I
