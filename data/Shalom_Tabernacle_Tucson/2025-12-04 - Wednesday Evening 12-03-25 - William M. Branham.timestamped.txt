[12:43] He'll never
[12:46] leave
[12:47] me,
[12:49] no matter where I go.
[12:56] Oh,
[12:58] he knows my name.
[13:06] He knows
[13:08] my every
[13:10] thought.
[13:13] He sees
[13:16] each tear that falls
[13:20] and he hears me when
[13:23] I call.
[13:29] I have
[13:31] a maker.
[13:37] before
[13:39] my heart.
[13:44] Before even time
[13:48] began,
[13:50] my life was in his hands.
[13:57] Oh,
[13:59] he knows
[14:01] my name.
[14:07] He knows my head

[14:52] And he hears me when
[14:55] I call.
[15:00] And he hears me when
[15:03] I call.
[15:08] Oh amazing love,
[15:12] how can it be
[15:16] that you, my king, would die for me?
[15:23] Oh, it's amazing love
[15:28] I know is true.
[15:32] It's my joy to honor you.
[15:38] In all I do,
[15:42] I honor you.
[15:48] I'm forgiven.
[15:51] Because you were forsaken.
[15:56] I'm accepted.
[15:59] You were condemned.
[16:04] I'm alive and well. Your spirit lives
[16:08] within me because you died and rose
[16:14] again.
[16:19] It's amazing love.
[16:22] How can it be
[16:27] that you, my king, would die for me.
[16:34] It's amazing love
[16:38] I know is true.
[16:42] It's my joy to honor you
[16:48] in all I do.
[16:52] I honor you.
[16:56] One more time. Oh, amazing love.
[17:01] How can it be
[17:06] that you my king would die for me?
[17:13] It's amazing love
[17:17] I know is true.
[17:22] It is my joy to honor you.
[17:27] In all I do
[17:31] I honor you.
[17:34] Oh, in all I do,
[17:39] I honor you.
[17:44] Amen. His amazing love that allows us to
[17:48] be here and sing to him tonight.
[17:51] Oh, let's sing that song. Uh, no longer
[17:54] slaves. Let's start with the chorus. I'm
[17:57] No longer

[18:37] You surround

[18:42] a song

[18:49] from my eneies.
[18:54] Till all

[19:14] of God.
[19:16] Oh, I'm no longer

[19:26] I am

[19:30] of God.
[19:33] From my mother's womb,
[19:37] you have chosen me.
[19:42] Love
[19:44] has called
[19:46] my name.
[19:49] I've been born again
[19:53] to your family.
[19:57] Your blood
[19:59] runs through
[20:02] my veins.
[20:04] Oh, I'm no longer

[20:09] to fear. Here
[20:14] I am

[20:55] a slave
[20:57] to fear.
[21:01] I am
[21:03] a child
[21:05] of God.
[21:08] Amen. As we change the order of the
[21:11] service, let's all stand.
[21:13] Sing that song. Uh, my hope is built on
[21:15] nothing less. KFD.
[21:18] Oh, my hope is built on nothing less
[21:25] than Jesus blood and righteousness.
[21:31] I dare not trust
[21:33] the sweetest spring,
[21:36] but holy lean on Jesus name.
[21:43] On Christ the solid
[21:46] rock I stand.
[21:49] All other ground is sinking sand.
[21:55] All other ground is sinking sand.
[22:03] When darkness seems
[22:06] to hide his face,
[22:09] I rest on his
[22:12] unchanging grace.
[22:15] In every high and stormy gale, my anchor
[22:22] holds within the veil.
[22:27] On Christ the solid
[22:31] rock I stand.
[22:34] All other ground is sinking sand.
[22:40] All other ground is sinking sand.
[22:47] His oath is gone
[22:50] and in his blood
[22:53] support me in
[22:56] the welling flood.
[22:59] When all around my soul gives way,
[23:05] he then is all my hope and stay.
[23:11] On Christ the solid
[23:15] rock I stand.
[23:18] All other ground is sinking sand.
[23:24] All other ground is sinking sand.
[23:31] When he shall come
[23:34] with trumpet sound,
[23:37] oh may I then in him be found,
[23:42] dressed in his rightousness
[23:46] alone,
[23:48] called bless to stand
[23:51] before the throne.
[23:55] On Christ the solid
[23:58] rock I stand.
[24:01] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:07] All other ground is sinking sand
[24:14] on Christ the sun.
[24:20] All other ground is sinking sand.
[24:26] All other ground is
[24:30] &gt;&gt; sinking sand. Amen. God bless each of
[24:34] you. Welcome to the house of the Lord
[24:36] tonight. Amen. So good to see each and
[24:38] every one of you. God bless you richly.
[24:41] Um we're going to be finishing up a tape
[24:44] entitled Believe from the Heart. It's
[24:47] about 30 minutes or so. And there's a
[24:51] couple of quotations I wanted to read
[24:53] out of there for you and the scripture
[24:56] reading that brother Brandham used in
[25:00] when he opened up that message. And so
[25:02] if you'd like to turn your Bibles into
[25:06] the New Testament, Mark chapter 11.
[25:10] Like to welcome my visitors, Matt and
[25:13] Cheryl.
[25:14] And these are the families of Brother
[25:17] Nathan. Amen. his sister and her
[25:20] husband. Welcome. Amen. And uh brother
[25:23] Papiso is going back to the Eastern
[25:26] Cape, South Africa this week. He leaves
[25:29] on early Friday morning. And we really
[25:32] enjoyed him to be here with us. And so
[25:35] make sure you shake his hand and send
[25:37] him God's blessings. Amen. Brother um
[25:42] Christopher Mesa is here. God bless you.
[25:45] Wave your hand, brother. He's been with
[25:47] us before. He has a ministry. He does a
[25:49] lot of street uh witnessing and
[25:52] preaching. I believe he's from the
[25:54] California area as well as myself.
[25:58] Although we didn't we never met in
[25:59] California, but we know the same people,
[26:01] but he's in Jeffersonville now. And uh
[26:04] he's happy to have him with us. Amen.
[26:07] God bless each of you.
[26:10] Happy birthday, Sister Barbara. I think
[26:12] so. Is it your birthday? Yes. To her.
[26:15] God bless you.
[26:18] So, praise the Lord and God bless each
[26:21] of you. In the scripture in Mark chapter
[26:25] 11,
[26:27] Jesus speaking here, he says this,
[26:36] very familiar scripture.
[26:40] Verse 22. who in Jesus answering saith
[26:42] unto them, have faith in God. For verily
[26:46] I say unto you, that whosoever shall say
[26:49] unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and
[26:52] be thou cast into the sea, and shall not
[26:55] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[26:58] that those things which he saith shall
[27:01] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[27:06] he saith.
[27:08] Therefore I say unto you, what
[27:11] thingsoever you desire when you pray,
[27:16] believe that you receive them, and ye
[27:19] shall have them.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Such powerful scriptures there.
[27:23] Brother Bam tells us in the belief from
[27:25] the heart message in paragraph number
[27:28] 33, he says this.
[27:31] Well, it seems like then upon thinking
[27:33] those things
[27:35] that there could be a placing by reading
[27:39] the word of faith that would go beyond
[27:42] the intellectual conceptions into the
[27:45] heart. Jesus said, "If thou shalt say in
[27:48] thy heart." Now, we get all frustrated
[27:51] in our minds. We go out and say, "Oh, I
[27:53] seen that done." Yes. And once in a
[27:57] while, it just hop skip and so forth.
[28:00] But it seems like it just can't get
[28:02] moving right is because we try to mix
[28:05] the intellectual with the supernatural.
[28:08] They have no dealings with each other at
[28:11] all. Intellectuals will say one thing
[28:14] and supernatural will say another. And
[28:17] any man that's ever led by the spirit of
[28:20] God does not take any thought of any
[28:23] intellectual, but he is led from his
[28:26] heart by the spirit of God. He is
[28:29] misunderstood.
[28:31] People say, "Oh, how could it be?" Um,
[28:34] paragraph 39, he continues on. He says,
[28:37] "Now, if you try to bluff that, it won't
[28:40] work. If you try to reason in your mind,
[28:42] say, yes, God's word is right. I believe
[28:44] that. I believe it will come to pass. I
[28:47] think that." Now, if that's
[28:49] intellectually, you just might as well
[28:51] stop thinking it until something comes
[28:54] down on the inside of you that just says
[28:57] it's so. And that's all there is to it.
[29:00] There is not enough demons out of
[29:02] torment could ever shake it from you.
[29:05] It's something on the inside called the
[29:08] heart. There is where real faith finds
[29:12] its resting place.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that what you want to happen
[29:16] to you tonight?
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Something to happen in your heart.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, send me something in my
[29:24] heart. Amen. So let's sing onlyly
[29:27] believe. Singing only believe.
[29:34] Only
[29:36] believe.
[29:39] All things are possible.
[29:45] Only
[29:46] believe.
[29:50] Only
[29:52] believe.
[29:55] Only
[29:57] believe.
[30:01] All things are possible.
[30:06] Holy
[30:08] Lord I believe. Let's lift our hands and
[30:11] say Lord
[30:13] I believe.
[30:17] Lord
[30:19] I believe
[30:22] that all things are possible.
[30:28] Lord, I I believe.
[30:34] Lord,
[30:36] I believe.
[30:39] Lord,
[30:41] I believe.
[30:45] All things are possible.
[30:50] Lord, I believe.
[30:54] God bless. You may be seated, brother
[30:56] Brandham.
[30:59] It was a few days ago
[31:03] when we were just TO SEE HOW GOD DOES
[31:05] THINGS SO simple and we are so
[31:08] frustrated till we look for great big
[31:10] things.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Be satisfied with little things.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Watch him when he does his glorious
[31:18] works.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; How he protects you. Don't be looking
[31:21] way over the top of something. Look down
[31:23] here.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:26] Notice I begin to think this that it is
[31:30] possible
[31:32] that when a man like the apostles
[31:36] and when you can live close to God AND
[31:39] GOD TO HIS GRACE OPERATES THROUGH you
[31:42] that the more God YOU GET THE MORE GODLY
[31:45] YOU BECOME.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; The more eternal life comes in the more
[31:50] of the intellectual it pushes out.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; Now I don't mean to be a fanatic. I mean
[31:55] to be a real sane sound believer
[32:00] not a bunch of ism but a real solid true
[32:04] sensible intelligent believer and I
[32:07] watch
[32:09] I've seen it work
[32:11] and to think that if you get into that
[32:14] contact with God it becomes to it isn't
[32:17] your voice anymore IT'S NOT YOUR THOUGHT
[32:20] ANYMORE
[32:22] IT BECOMES GOD'S THOUGHT AND GOD'S
[32:24] VOICE.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE JUST THE VINE OR JUST A BRANCH.
[32:30] He's the vine and it's his spirit that
[32:34] goes in and energizes.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; As long as YOU CAN GET YOURSELF OUT OF
[32:38] THE WAY, HE'LL FILL IT UP.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; And then you can be a witness just like
[32:45] Noah's ark was a witness. Like Jesus was
[32:48] a witness of God. He become SO FULL OF
[32:51] GOD TO HIM AND GOD WAS ONE. God dwelt in
[32:54] Christ reconciling the world to himself.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; The very expression
[33:02] a man's work declares his character.
[33:06] CHRIST WAS GOD'S WORK.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; AND CHRIST DECLARED GOD'S CHARACTER.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; His healing for the sick, his longing
[33:17] for saving the souls till even he gave
[33:20] his own life.
[33:23] God's work, God's character was declared
[33:25] in Christ. And if you can just empty
[33:28] YOUR OWN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHTS OUT AND
[33:32] GIVE GOD THE right away,
[33:34] &gt;&gt; HE CAN DECLARE HIS CHARACTER THROUGH THE
[33:37] WORK OF YOUR YIELDING.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Empty up. Get the world. Get your doubt
[33:44] out of the way.
[33:46] If you come to the altar to be prayed
[33:48] for, SAY, "I'LL GO AND SEE IF I'LL GET
[33:50] HEALED." God can never declare his
[33:52] works.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; You've got to get your own thoughts out
[33:55] of the way and let him feel you.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Now, the way I'm noticing these things,
[34:02] like this old bull up here was going to
[34:04] kill me that time, like them hornets
[34:06] back out by the fence, like many other
[34:09] things that's taking place, the bear in
[34:11] the woods.
[34:13] It's a study of nature.
[34:16] It's something that happens. I'm saying
[34:18] this now. excuse it as being a personal
[34:21] experience, but I want to tell you
[34:24] BECAUSE IT'S A MODERN TIME. Someone
[34:27] said, "Oh, well, those things happened
[34:29] back in the days of the prophets in the
[34:31] days." Well, GOD WAS SHOWING EXAMPLES.
[34:34] BUT DID YOU KNOW TODAY GOD'S BUILDING A
[34:37] CHURCH?
[34:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "WELL, THEY HAD PROPHETS. THEY
[34:42] HAD TO SPEAK THE WORD OF GOD." BUT HE'S
[34:44] GOT A CHURCH OF GOD TODAY.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[34:50] Notice
[34:52] if something takes place, wished it
[34:55] could be all the time. I WOULD TO GOD
[34:58] THAT IT COULD BE ALL THE TIME,
[35:00] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't. It just comes at his
[35:02] will.
[35:04] Now, a few days ago or about two or
[35:07] three weeks ago,
[35:09] I was praying for people with leukemia.
[35:12] I was praying with people waiting for
[35:14] vision. That's sick and suffering.
[35:18] Many have waited on for years. For
[35:20] instance, this little Edith Right,
[35:23] crippled. I remember when her DADDY WAS
[35:26] LAYING DYING AND GOD SHOWED A VISION FOR
[35:28] HER DADDY AND LET EDITH lay there.
[35:30] There's a little woman. I I guess she's
[35:32] still in here. Mrs. Guyger from Fort
[35:34] Wayne. Pitiful looking little mother,
[35:36] young woman. She gave birth to a baby
[35:39] and the baby was so big. She was so
[35:41] little. It run her into cancer and got
[35:43] healed of the cancer. Now she's got
[35:45] almost a middle break from nervousness.
[35:47] She's in the menopause and the poor
[35:50] little thing and a real loyal husband
[35:53] and a little husband went everywhere
[35:56] praying and seeking and crying and be
[35:59] praying for such as that. And you know
[36:02] what happened? Brother Woods back there,
[36:05] his daddy came down, a Jehovah witness.
[36:08] Brother Woods was a Jehovah witness. God
[36:11] witnessed and declared himself to him by
[36:13] healing his boy David crippled.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Then his brother came down and his
[36:20] brother was living an immoral life and
[36:22] there the Holy Spirit turned around and
[36:23] rebuked him.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Seen the woman he was running with and
[36:28] he surrendered his life and let EVERY
[36:31] DEVIL GO OUT of him that day and he's
[36:33] walking the streets now AND DOING
[36:35] EVERYTHING HE CAN TO SERVE GOD,
[36:37] testifying to his people.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then his poor old daddy,
[36:40] honest as he could be and all of his
[36:43] dealings as a farmer and so forth. AND
[36:47] WHEN HIS DADDY COME DOWN, he wanted me
[36:49] to go fishing with him. And we went down
[36:51] the to the lake on the road down a
[36:53] vision came that morning. And he said,
[36:56] "Every lake that you cross and every
[36:58] stream of water will be muddy. No
[37:00] fishing. But when you get down to the
[37:03] wolf creek there to the dale holler said
[37:08] that's going to be pretty and blue AND
[37:10] YOU HAVE NEVER CAUGHT A catfish in that
[37:12] water but YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH A WHOLE
[37:15] STRING OF them
[37:17] and said they're going to catch one or
[37:19] two little ones and then you're GOING TO
[37:20] CATCH A BIG FISH WITH A SCALE FISH.
[37:22] It'll be big of a species. I turned
[37:25] around and quoted to him. I watched the
[37:27] old man's eyes as he looked over towards
[37:28] his boys.
[37:30] When we went down there and got in the
[37:32] water, every lake was muddy going down.
[37:36] When we got there, it was just as blue.
[37:37] It hurt your eyes nearly. And we fished
[37:40] and we couldn't catch a bass crappie or
[37:42] anything. And all of a sudden, I started
[37:45] catching catfish and caught a whole
[37:47] string of them. Some of them five pounds
[37:50] and a piece and sometimes two on one
[37:52] line with a poleing line. We fished and
[37:55] got a string of fish. And the next
[37:56] morning I went back fishing. I caught
[37:58] one great big bluegill with a what we
[38:01] call the redbellyied sunfish, the
[38:04] biggest I ever seen.
[38:07] Then when the man come to me, I said,
[38:09] "Now sir, the Bible said if there be one
[38:12] among you spiritual prophet and what he
[38:15] says comes to pass and hear him if he
[38:17] doesn't." And I TOOK FOUR OUTSTANDING
[38:19] PROPHECIES OF JEHOVAH witness and showed
[38:22] him that none of them had come to pass.
[38:24] Every one of them failed. I said, ' Now,
[38:26] what about the fish?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; AND GOD SHOWED THAT vision to change
[38:32] that man and turn him around for that
[38:35] one man WHERE THERE WAS THOUSANDS LAYING
[38:38] SUFFERING.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE ALMIGHTY,
[38:42] GOD TO LET YOU KNOW THAT HE DECLARES HIS
[38:46] DOINGS BY HIS WORK AND HIS CHARACTER IS
[38:50] DECLARED BY THE SAINTS.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Look at the pool of Bethesda. You said
[38:53] that don't sound like God doing that.
[38:55] Look at the crippled, lame, halt, blind,
[38:57] withered, waiting. And here come Jesus
[38:59] right through their garments full of
[39:00] virtue and walked to a man and went to a
[39:03] man who could walk, do anything he
[39:04] wanted to, but had some kind of a
[39:06] disease and healed him and left
[39:08] the rest of them standing there.
[39:10] See his character. He wanted to show his
[39:13] powers. He wanted to do something. Yeah.
[39:16] The world stand still to notice it now.
[39:20] noticed day before yesterday when we
[39:23] went back. I come back to the
[39:24] Indianapolis meeting and I thought I'd
[39:26] have to stay just a little while away
[39:28] from the people. I got kind of rested up
[39:30] cuz I'd have 20 or 30 a day on private
[39:33] interviews, those visions coming. I was
[39:35] just about dead when I got home. No one
[39:38] knows what I go through on that.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; No one. There's no way to explain it.
[39:44] But then,
[39:46] Brother Woods and his brother and I run
[39:48] off down to the place in to fish again
[39:51] for a day and night. And that afternoon
[39:53] sitting back there, Brother Woods began
[39:56] to speak about an old woman that used to
[39:58] belong to the Anderson Church of God up
[40:00] here when they were in their bloom. How
[40:03] good said how she used to take them
[40:04] little Jehovah Witness boys and love
[40:06] them.
[40:07] And brother Wood said to his brother
[40:11] Lyall, he said, "Lyle, would it not be
[40:15] great now if we would go find that old
[40:18] sister and let her know that we're
[40:19] saved?"
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Now, that word found favor with God
[40:24] after been talking about God for a long
[40:26] time. But that word found favor. Those
[40:29] two Jehovah Witness boys, both of them,
[40:31] agemen, want to find an old woman and
[40:33] tell her that they were saved. two
[40:36] brothers. When they said that, the
[40:38] spirit of God and his sovereignty fell
[40:41] on me
[40:42] &gt;&gt; sitting there in that boat.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I COULD HAD VOICE THE WAY I
[40:47] COULD SPEAK that into the people's
[40:48] heart.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; I could not no more control myself THAN
[40:54] YOU COULD FLY TO THE moon
[40:57] just by that word.
[41:01] AND I SAID, "BOYS,
[41:04] THERE'S SOMETHING FIXING TO HAPPEN."
[41:07] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; It's a little animal of some sort. IT'LL
[41:12] BE BROUGHT TO LIFE. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[41:13] LIFE CONNECTED WITH IT. AND you'll see
[41:15] it right away.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, now what have I
[41:19] said? AND I BEGIN TO THINK OF some
[41:22] things. What made me say that? No
[41:26] vision. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING SPOKE.
[41:30] WHAT WAS IT? IT WASN'T MY INTELLECTUALS.
[41:33] I COULDN'T EVEN THINK OF SUCH A THING.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; IT WAS DOWN BELOW THAT.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN THE HEART THAT GOD HAD COME
[41:42] into
[41:43] &gt;&gt; he was doing the speaking.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T EVEN WASN'T THINKING OF SUCH a
[41:48] thing.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; And it spoke.
[41:52] I think there's where Jesus said,
[41:55] "If thou believest in thy heart and
[41:59] shall say to this tree or to this
[42:02] mountain," and then don't doubt, but
[42:05] believe that what you say will come to
[42:07] pass, you'll have what you say.
[42:10] There's my point.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Get to that spot. The word something is
[42:15] not yourself.
[42:17] It's something beyond your reasoning
[42:19] that speaks it. We went on. In closing,
[42:23] I say this. Brother Woods are sitting
[42:25] here as a witness. The next morning,
[42:27] that night, we went and the Lord gave us
[42:29] a great night of fishing. No one
[42:31] catching any fish. And we caught three
[42:34] there just in a few minutes. And the
[42:35] three weighed nearly 20 lbs. And we just
[42:38] had great strains of fish. The next
[42:40] morning, we went back and was putting
[42:43] the baits new on the line. And not one
[42:46] fish.
[42:48] It was over.
[42:50] I SAID, "LET US go into this little cove
[42:52] and rest a few of his brethren, and we
[42:55] shall fish for bluegills with a fly
[42:57] line." We went back up there and was
[42:59] fishing for bluegills back in the little
[43:01] cove with her boat.
[43:03] And every time we GET STOPPED LONG
[43:05] ENOUGH, THE MOTOR would stop. We wasn't
[43:06] fishing. We were talking about God.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; And Mr. Lyall, which is now he went to
[43:14] his sister to try to get her out, but
[43:15] overwitness. She told him she told him
[43:18] he's listening to devils that we WERE
[43:20] DEVILS. SAID, "LY YOU KNOW BETTER than
[43:23] that and all these certain things." Then
[43:27] Lyall caught a little bluegill about
[43:29] like that and he was talking so he let
[43:32] the little fell swallow the big hook. It
[43:34] went plum down into the stomach of the
[43:36] little fish and when he got a hold of it
[43:38] he couldn't pull it so he just squeezed
[43:40] it in his hand, wrapped it around and
[43:42] pulled the intros out of it. had to get
[43:44] this hook out of the mouth, for if he
[43:46] cut the hook off, it would kill dead.
[43:47] Fish go die anyhow. And here's the words
[43:50] that he said. You sure shot your wad,
[43:54] little fella, and throw him into the
[43:56] water. And he flipped three or four
[43:57] times and went circling down to the blue
[43:59] waters till he hit the bottom. Laid
[44:01] there just a few minutes. He come back
[44:03] up the top water and floed three or four
[44:05] times. his little fin straightened out
[44:06] like that, laid sideways, curled over
[44:09] and for about 20 minutes, us fishing, he
[44:11] done floated back into the wilderness,
[44:14] back up into some trash.
[44:17] And I was and someone said, "That little
[44:19] fish is really having a breakfast or
[44:21] feeding." I said, "Yes, that's right."
[44:24] And we said, "Oh, isn't God great?"
[44:28] Brother Wood said, "Oh, it's so great,
[44:30] Brother Brandham. We have the privilege
[44:32] of being here with you." Oh, I said,
[44:34] 'Don't think that, Brother Woods. THIS I
[44:37] SAID, IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT THE HOLY
[44:40] MOUNTAIN. It's not THE HOLY PLACE. IT'S
[44:43] THE HOLY GOD.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; NOT A HOLY MAN, BUT A HOLY GOD.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And while we were talking, something
[44:52] moved on me.
[44:55] I'M GOING TO SHOW MY POWER OUT.
[44:59] Before I knew WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT,
[45:03] that scripture come to my mind.
[45:07] Whatsoever thou sayest, believe it shall
[45:10] come to pass in your heart. Say it and
[45:13] you will have what you say.
[45:17] I I just almost IT WAS FLOODING OUT OF
[45:19] ME. I THOUGHT, WHAT'S this going on?
[45:22] Lyn Bank sitting there. We were fishing.
[45:25] The little dead fish been laying about
[45:27] 20 minutes. All curled over there.
[45:28] floated back into the place. Little
[45:30] intros hanging out of his mouth.
[45:33] AND I LOOKED AT THAT LITTLE fish
[45:36] and the THOUGHT COME TO ME. HE SAID TO
[45:40] THE FISHERMAN, "CAST ON THE OTHER SIDE
[45:42] OF THE BOAT." THEY TOOK HIS WORD. PETER
[45:46] SAID, "LORD, WE FEAST ALL NIGHT AND TUCK
[45:48] NOTHING. NEVERTHELESS, AT YOUR WORD,
[45:50] YOU'LL tow the net."
[45:52] &gt;&gt; There it is. Afterward, something said
[45:54] to me, GOD KNOWS THE FISH. JUST SPEAK
[45:57] THE WORD AND WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT
[45:59] FISH.
[46:02] I said a little fish
[46:05] in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST COME BACK TO
[46:08] LIFE
[46:10] AND GOD MY SOLEMN JUDGE OF THAT TWO MAN
[46:12] STAND THERE THAT LITTLE FISH TURNED ON
[46:15] HIS SIDE AND SWIM AWAY FROM AS HARD AS
[46:17] HE COULD GO ALIVE AGAIN.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[46:22] ALMIGHTY GOD AS I STAND HERE BEFORE HIM
[46:25] in the presence of this COMPANY AND THIS
[46:27] BIBLE KNOWS that's the truth.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; WHEN PEOPLE ARE DYING AND YET GOD SHOWED
[46:33] HIS POWER TO THOSE JU JEHOVAH WITNESS
[46:36] THAT HE IS THE RESURRECTION AND LIFE AND
[46:39] THERE'S NOTHING about God.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Thou sayest and believe that what you
[46:45] say comes to pass. You will have what
[46:48] you say.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; What was it? God showing his power. Not
[46:53] me, just a vine or a branch. He
[46:55] energized the branch so I COULDN'T KEEP
[46:57] FROM UTTERING THEM VOICES. WHAT would I
[46:59] ever thought of a little dead fish
[47:01] laying there? Won't you eat me? I had
[47:02] him cut up and baited on the line. That
[47:05] little fish hanging there, LAYING THERE
[47:08] DEAD. MR. Wood sitting right here
[47:10] looking at me now, a witness of that.
[47:13] And the spirit of God swept down through
[47:16] that valley.
[47:18] AND THEN YOU THOUGHT THE RAPTURE WAS
[47:20] COMING.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Even the Mr. Wood screamed out and said,
[47:23] "Oh, IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE."
[47:25] &gt;&gt; THAT BROTHER, WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
[47:28] THE ONLY EXPRESSION THEY could give was
[47:29] to me being their brother. And I turned
[47:32] quickly because they seem that God had
[47:34] USED ME TO SPEAK LIFE TO A FISH. And now
[47:37] that sounds crazy, BUT THAT'S THE SAME
[47:40] GOD THAT SPOKE LIFE TO THAT DEAD
[47:42] POSSIBLY IN THE EARLY YARD.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE'S ALPHA AND OMEGA. THE
[47:48] BEGINNING AND THE END. HE'S THE LIFE,
[47:49] THE RESURRECTION. HE'S THE POWER OF THE
[47:51] everlasting one.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Same yesterday and forever.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; That gives me to know this that someday
[48:00] WHEN LIFE IS GONE FOR THIS MORTAL BODY
[48:02] AND I'LL UNDERSTAND STILL. IF HE'S
[48:05] INTERESTED IN A FISH, SURELY HE'S
[48:08] INTERESTED IN me and you who are trying
[48:10] to serve him in some glorious day. God,
[48:14] &gt;&gt; not the branch, BUT THE VINE ITSELF WILL
[48:16] SPEAK.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; From its headquarters in glory, those
[48:20] which are sleeping, Christ shall rise
[48:21] and go to everlasting life.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; What a feeling. No one could express it.
[48:27] WHEN YOU SEE A DEAD FISH LAYING ON THE
[48:29] WATER WITH HIS intros pulled through his
[48:31] mouth
[48:33] by a big-handed man who squeezed a fish
[48:36] like this and took it and wrenching, you
[48:37] hear tearing when he tore the entrance
[48:39] from the fish. Throw the little fell in
[48:41] the water. He quivered four or five
[48:42] times and kicked over and that was it.
[48:44] And see that little fell just in a
[48:46] moment of SPEAKING THAT WORD SWING
[48:48] HIMSELF BACK IN CONDITION JUST AS LOUD
[48:50] AS HE WAS and swung down through that
[48:51] water just as hard as he could go.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Going back out to join his fellow fish.
[48:56] He's God.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; HE KNOW THAT PICTURE THERE. Just the
[49:02] same as he knowed that and had a coin in
[49:04] his mouth.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; JUST THE SAME AS HE KNOW IF YOU TOLD IF
[49:08] THOSE PEOPLE THEY SAY and St. Mark the
[49:11] fifth chapter. It said that Jesus barred
[49:14] Peter's boat there and went out fishing.
[49:16] Now I said let down for the draw and
[49:18] they fish. They know they fished all
[49:20] night and caught nothing. Just as we had
[49:22] done the same thing.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And caught nothing. But God wanted to
[49:26] see if they'd take his word.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Let down the net for the
[49:30] draw." If there was no fish there taking
[49:32] God at his word, he'll put some there.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; That's all there was to it.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Then that same God in his same character
[49:39] that was in the beginning is the same
[49:41] God, but the same character today. He's
[49:43] the first, the last, he's the same yet
[49:45] today and forever.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; He's still God.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; So you who were here this morning and
[49:51] prayed for him, let me tell you
[49:53] something.
[49:54] seeing these testimonies and God's
[49:56] witness whether they're true or not.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. You're looking for great
[50:00] things. You're trying to look over some
[50:02] great big something over here when it's
[50:04] right next to you.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. The very God that put the
[50:09] hunger in your soul to come be prayed
[50:11] for is the very same God that gave life
[50:14] to that fish.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; The very same God that stopped that bone
[50:17] in the field. The very same God that
[50:20] slayed that maniac there in my presence.
[50:22] The same God that brought Daniel from
[50:24] the lion's den. The same God that said
[50:26] cast your nets on this other side take
[50:28] for the draw. He's the same yesterday,
[50:30] today, and forever. His works cannot
[50:32] fail. His character cannot fail. And his
[50:35] works declare his character. So he's
[50:37] arisen today and is here in our midst.
[50:39] The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[50:42] And we're witnesses of his character.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; His character has changed me when it
[50:47] come to be. I was once a sinner, and now
[50:49] I'm saved. I was once lost. Now I'm
[50:52] found.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; I once loved the things of the world. I
[50:56] hate it now.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; I once cared not for God. I love him
[50:59] now.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Something happened to me. Something
[51:03] happened to you. What is it? It's God's
[51:06] work declaring his character. He loves
[51:08] us. He's interested in your welfare.
[51:11] He's interested in your healing. He's
[51:13] interested in your soul. Won't you let
[51:15] him have his way in your life? Don't you
[51:17] doubt him for nothing. You go believe in
[51:19] him and God will give you the desire of
[51:22] your heart for it's his good will to do
[51:23] it. He longs TO DO IT. BUT THE THING OF
[51:26] IT IS WE GET ALL FRUSTRATED. STAND
[51:28] STILL.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Look at it. Say, "God, that means me."
[51:36] No matter who prays for me, what prays
[51:38] for me. It doesn't take a Oral Roberts,
[51:41] a Billy Grim, or a William Brandom or a
[51:43] Allen. It takes God.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; It takes your faith anchor in God. Say,
[51:49] "God, it is the truth.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; There alone I stand." And let let just
[51:54] keep in here until it drops down into
[51:56] here. From your head to your heart. It
[51:59] becomes a reality. Then it'll work. Only
[52:02] can it work when it comes to the heart.
[52:04] The Lord bless you. Now, while we bow
[52:05] our heads, put your desire on your
[52:07] heart. Place it before God right now.
[52:09] Will you do it while we pray? If it's
[52:12] for salvation, if it's for whatever it's
[52:15] for, you place it before God right now
[52:17] when we pray.
[52:21] My
[52:22] faith
[52:24] looks up
[52:27] to thee,
[52:29] thou
[52:31] lamb of Calary.
[52:38] Saveior.
[52:46] Now
[52:48] hear me what
[52:52] I pray.
[52:54] Take
[52:56] all my guilt
[53:00] away.
[53:03] Oh,
[53:05] let me from
[53:09] this day behold.
[53:18] While light dark may
[53:24] I tread. Get quiet now. and
[53:29] greets
[53:31] around
[53:33] me spread.
[53:35] Be
[53:37] thou my God.
[53:42] Be
[53:45] this turn
[53:48] today.
[53:50] wipe
[53:52] all my fears
[53:56] away.
[53:58] Nor
[54:00] let me ever
[54:04] stray from the
[54:09] far
[54:10] side.
[54:19] Blessed Lord,
[54:23] we could say like those who stood on the
[54:26] mount that day and said, "It's good for
[54:28] us to be here."
[54:31] And we would to build three tabernacles,
[54:35] put pastors in each.
[54:38] But the voice quickly turned and said,
[54:40] "Hear ye him. He's my son.
[54:46] Now, let us turn from pastors,
[54:49] from the Moses and the Elijah's
[54:52] and from the great man of the earth,
[54:53] although we're thankful for all of them.
[54:57] But you said first to hear him.
[55:01] And his word said this, not the pastor's
[55:03] word, neither the advances.
[55:06] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[55:09] pray, believe you receive them.
[55:12] you shall have them. If you should say
[55:15] to this mountain, be moved and be cast
[55:18] into the sea, and don't doubt in your
[55:20] heart.
[55:22] But believe that what you say shall come
[55:25] to pass, you shall have what you say.
[55:29] Not necessarily would it be momentarily.
[55:31] Neither was it momentarily with Abraham
[55:33] and Sarah.
[55:36] But you said, "If you believe that what
[55:40] you say shall come to pass,
[55:43] you shall have what you say."
[55:47] Now, Father,
[55:50] here's our prayer.
[55:52] Take us just now.
[55:56] take our hearts into thy hands
[56:00] and squeeze them real tight with love,
[56:04] pushing all of the fear and unbelief
[56:06] from them,
[56:08] making them hollow and empty.
[56:12] and then fill him immediately
[56:15] with thy spirit as the tar and pitch
[56:19] went into the ark to keep fear and doubt
[56:24] from ever coming to our hearts again.
[56:27] And make us of thy workmanship
[56:30] that you might declare your character to
[56:33] the world through us as written epistles
[56:36] read of all men.
[56:39] May everyone that was been anointed,
[56:41] that's what you said, do
[56:43] may they be healed today from every
[56:46] person from the common tooth ache till
[56:49] the blind, afflicted, or whatever it
[56:50] might be. May that faith anchor now into
[56:54] that heart that was fearing and doubting
[56:55] when it come in.
[56:57] No God, I'll always remember
[57:02] myself. We three men as Peter, James,
[57:05] and John stood on Mount Transfiguration
[57:08] and seen what you did there. We'll never
[57:12] forget that little cove down
[57:15] Fanny Creek
[57:17] as long as we have memories and
[57:19] recollections.
[57:22] It might not mean much to the world, but
[57:24] when we seen the omnipotence of God, the
[57:28] ominate presence of the living God, move
[57:31] down and have sympathy enough upon
[57:34] mankind to show your power to bringing
[57:37] the little fish that was dead on the
[57:39] waters back to life again. That goes
[57:42] plum over the top of a skeptic or an
[57:44] unbeliever. But how it registers in the
[57:48] Christian heart.
[57:50] We know that they aren't God.
[57:52] You're the same God here in this room
[57:54] this morning. How much more do you care
[57:57] for the people in this room of men and
[57:58] women as you do for a little fish? What
[58:02] did that little fish mean to you?
[58:04] Nothing. Just declaring your word.
[58:07] And I pray God that you'll declare your
[58:09] works in every man and woman, boy and
[58:11] girl in here today. If there be some
[58:13] your Lord who does not know you as their
[58:15] savior have not yet experienced and
[58:18] would want to empty their heart out
[58:20] today from all the things of the trash
[58:22] of the world that you might fill their
[58:24] heart with love as Noah did the ark with
[58:28] the pitch. I pray that you'll deal with
[58:30] them in these fleeting minutes now
[58:32] that's left in the program. Grant it
[58:35] father through Jesus name. And while our
[58:36] heads are bowed,
[58:40] may
[58:42] thy rich grace
[58:46] impart
[58:48] strength
[58:50] to my fainting
[58:54] heart,
[58:56] my
[58:58] seal inspired.
[59:02] Now, if you want Christ while they're
[59:04] singing,
[59:06] want to empty up your heart this morning
[59:08] and God to take you just as you are
[59:10] there, would you raise your hand to him?
[59:12] Say, "Remember me." God bless you, sir.
[59:14] You, sir. You, sister. You, brother.
[59:18] You. Someone else over on my right.
[59:21] Raise your hand. God bless you, sister.
[59:24] Someone else say, "I want to empty my
[59:25] heart." God bless you, sister back
[59:27] there.
[59:29] Let me from this day be holy.
[59:38] Someone else wants to raise your hand
[59:39] now just before prayer.
[59:42] Father God, you've seen every hand seven
[59:45] or eight 10 hands went up. They're now
[59:48] emptying out all their fears and
[59:51] unbelief. They're now claiming thee as
[59:54] their allsufficient one, as their lover,
[59:57] as their savior, as their healer. All
[1:00:01] doubts and fears, they're desiring to be
[1:00:03] taken from them. I pray that you'll
[1:00:05] grant it, Lord, by your great grace.
[1:00:08] Let it happen just today.
[1:00:11] You could speak life to a fish,
[1:00:14] speak life to a little dead boy, speak
[1:00:18] life to Elijah Perry laying there dead
[1:00:20] and his hands crossed.
[1:00:22] speak life to a little dead baby out in
[1:00:24] Mexico,
[1:00:26] spoke life gather in Lazarus after being
[1:00:28] dead four days.
[1:00:30] How much more can we take our stand
[1:00:32] today on the rock of his eternal word
[1:00:35] and look beyond this shadow of doubt to
[1:00:38] him that said, "I am the resurrection
[1:00:40] and life." May faith take its resting
[1:00:42] place now on him, that solid rock,
[1:00:44] Christ. And may they receive everything
[1:00:47] that they've asked for. hear our prayers
[1:00:49] as we pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[1:00:53] Amen. Amen.
[1:00:57] I
[1:00:59] love him.
[1:01:03] I
[1:01:05] love him.
[1:01:10] He pray
[1:01:19] my salary.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I'll always sing again. Shake hands with
[1:01:33] someone near you. Just sit still. Now
[1:01:34] we're service. It's not over yet.
[1:01:37] I
[1:01:39] love
[1:01:51] my
[1:02:05] God.
[1:02:11] You feel all scoured out. You feel
[1:02:13] better now.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; You feel like the word.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's it's a cleansing blood
[1:02:22] and Lord Jesus that goes right through
[1:02:24] the heart, cleanses us from all sin and
[1:02:26] iniquity.
[1:02:29] for
[1:02:31] just my
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; now brother Neville
[1:02:52] tonight. Amen. We thank God for that. So
[1:02:56] so powerful. There's a prayer request
[1:02:58] for brother Dave Cook Junior that is is
[1:03:02] um he's got some decisions to make on
[1:03:04] his treatment here a year or so ago or
[1:03:07] some time ago. There was a a pretty
[1:03:09] aggressive tumor found in him that the
[1:03:12] doctors can't operate. Um they couldn't
[1:03:15] take it out. It was too complicated.
[1:03:18] And then um
[1:03:20] my if that was you, you would surely
[1:03:22] want the saints to pray with you. And
[1:03:25] our God is God. He's the healer. So,
[1:03:28] we're going to take him to the Lord in
[1:03:29] prayer. Um, also my wife will be
[1:03:32] traveling back on Saturday to come back
[1:03:35] home, keep her in prayer. And, um,
[1:03:40] remember the Saints, Brother Art's
[1:03:42] family that started those Bible studies
[1:03:46] there and um, the Lord is really dealing
[1:03:49] with them, some of the young people in
[1:03:51] that. So, pray for them. Is there
[1:03:54] someone here that has a request they
[1:03:55] like to mention? Yes.
[1:04:16] for Scott Sh for this surgery. Was there
[1:04:19] someone else? Um,

[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; The pastor has just called me to say
[1:41:45] lera
[1:41:47] which is see you later.
[1:41:51] they say so in Hebrew
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; meaning see you later. So God bless you
[1:41:57] saints and um I've been blessed by being
[1:42:00] here amongst you. The way you sing when
[1:42:02] I said the other night that I think you
[1:42:05] sing better than us I meant it and I
[1:42:09] thank the Lord for his presence while I
[1:42:12] was here and I'm taking everything back
[1:42:14] home. Sometimes, you know, when a song
[1:42:18] is sung here, and I'm thinking of uh
[1:42:21] them back home, like uh the one song
[1:42:24] that was sung just before the last one
[1:42:26] that the brother sang here. Uh oh, he
[1:42:29] knows my name. My daughter loved that
[1:42:32] one so much. So, I just thought, let me
[1:42:35] take a clip of that one. Well, please do
[1:42:38] pray for me. Pray for us. We'll be in
[1:42:40] touch all the time. I'll give report of
[1:42:44] what is taking place over there and I
[1:42:46] think I'm going back to my radio
[1:42:49] ministry and uh some other things I had
[1:42:53] I'll call it a privilege when I was over
[1:42:56] in Jeffersonville
[1:42:58] we were going with brother u William
[1:43:02] Linger he hosted me in his home and we
[1:43:06] were going to the sides and I had time
[1:43:10] to share a lot of testimony ies with him
[1:43:12] and him with me. And uh
[1:43:17] on Wednesday evening, we went to the
[1:43:20] Branam tabernacle to go and pray. They
[1:43:24] opened and I was so glad. I saw so many
[1:43:27] saints there. The parking lot was full,
[1:43:30] the one behind the building and the one
[1:43:32] in the opposite street. And after that,
[1:43:35] the brother asked me if I could go with
[1:43:38] him to the hospital and go and pray for
[1:43:42] a brother that's
[1:43:46] suffering with cancer. His name is
[1:43:49] Brother Andy Holy.
[1:43:52] So I went in there. I quoted brother
[1:43:55] Brennham. In fact, I didn't quote
[1:43:56] brother Brennan. I quoted what the angel
[1:44:00] said to brother Brennham
[1:44:02] that nothing will stand against his
[1:44:06] prayers
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; and the angel said not even cancer. So I
[1:44:11] go to the I read some scriptures and I
[1:44:13] prayed for the brother. Well I don't
[1:44:16] doubt the Lord will heal the brother. I
[1:44:21] just asked the church to to pray with me
[1:44:23] for the brother. I just after 3 days I
[1:44:29] was in Connecticut
[1:44:31] then I received a report that the mother
[1:44:34] had seen the brother and he's
[1:44:37] she says
[1:44:39] he's made a miraulous turn for the
[1:44:42] better.
[1:44:43] Amen. I even asked the brother to take a
[1:44:46] picture because that thing's protruding
[1:44:48] like this on his neck. But I said,
[1:44:51] "Brother, take a picture of that. When
[1:44:53] it goes away, give me another picture."
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Let us pray, saints.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you so much tonight Lord
[1:45:00] that we could be in your house Lord and
[1:45:03] truly Lord what you said in your word is
[1:45:07] nothing but the truth Lord that where
[1:45:10] two or three are gathered in your name,
[1:45:12] you are there. We heard dear God from
[1:45:15] our prophet this evening Lord as he was
[1:45:18] stressing those wonderful words Lord
[1:45:21] dear Jesus we believe and we know Lord
[1:45:24] it's true Lord you spoke Lord it was not
[1:45:27] him speaking Lord it was you speaking
[1:45:30] through him Lord and he spoke life into
[1:45:33] that dead fish Lord not only the fish
[1:45:36] Lord many other things took place Lord I
[1:45:41] can imagine those brothers that were
[1:45:42] there with him that day, Lord.
[1:45:45] Hallelujah. When that holy hush, Lord,
[1:45:48] that spirit, Lord, was in that valley,
[1:45:51] Lord, until the brother said, "It's so
[1:45:54] good to be here." Thank you so much
[1:45:56] tonight, Lord, that your saints came in
[1:45:58] the house, Lord, to come, Lord, and
[1:46:02] offer these supplications and prayers
[1:46:05] before you, Lord God. Touch all those
[1:46:08] that were mentioned here, Lord, that are
