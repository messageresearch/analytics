TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e [Music] e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e [Music] thank you good morning can we all stand we're going to be listening to a about a 20 minute portion of the seventh seal from Revelation 8 verse one and before we do that and read that verse let's let's all pray Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful to be here today Lord we're ready father to hear your word Lord to be sped fed spiritually father Lord from the vitamins and the stored up food that you have provided for us Lord we love to hear it Lord make us doers of the word for we can do nothing without you lord it's all your power and all your grace it's not our works but it's father your mercy that has come upon us Lord we pray that you just meet every need here today Father open our eyes to see all of your word father visit everyone and we and every Sunday school child and we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ amen Revelation 8 verse one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour only believe only [Music] believe only believe all things are possible only believe only be [Music] only all things are possible [Music] only you may be seated brother e e e e e e e e e e behind the word of God come to the Earth the battle again Eve broke down the barrier from where she was uh isolated behind the word of God and from that very hour let down the bar Satan won the battle exctly how he won the battle over God's word his subject one of subjects let let down the bar from the word and that's exactly how he's won the battle every time and because one of his subjects let down the bar holy church the Living God and this last Church to an organizational system the word and the real genuine Holy Church of the Living God with a line riter would not accept the word and turn the church from the word to Dogma now how many knows that it's Dogma that the Roman Cath knew when here not long ago that Mary was resurrected you remember it here a few years ago about 10 years how many rememb is that papers sure everything the new Dogma see it's all Dogma not word a priest on an interview recently he said Mr Brandon he said God is in his church I said God is in his word amen he said we're not supposed to argue I I'm not arguing I'm just making statement amen God's in his word that's right anybody will take anything away from it or add anything to it said the word he said well God gave Christ gave his church power and told them whatever they bound on Earth be bound in heaven I said that is exactly truth he said we have on upon this principle that we have power to lose sin and I said if you'll do it the way that it was give to the church and the way they did it I'll accept it if you do there water here to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins not that somebody telling you your sins are remitted right that's exactly watch Peter with the keys on the day of Pentecost remember he has the keys that they're talking about and the the man said man and Brethren what can we do to be saved Peter said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ what for for the remission of sins and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises into to you and your children them as far off even as many as the large Our God shall call that's right so that settles it forever it's all over that did it now but to see Antichrist come in as we pictured it and showed it what a revelation amen amen and the think all these years we' seen it moving up and here it's absolutely directly thus sayth the Lord hallelujah now and we notice this interval between the sixth and the seventh chapter now the seventh chapter of Revelation here is a uh reveals a happening it's not in here just for nothing it's not put in between this for nothing see it is here for a purpose and it's a revelation that reveals something notice how mysterious and how mathematically it fits right into the scripture exactly you believe in God's mathematics don't you're sure lost you sure get lost in the word if you start to putting a four or six or or something besides his mathematical words running in order you'll sure have in your scena cow picking grass on top of a tree somewhere you'll you certainly run out because God does not his whole word does run completely in in in mathematics yes perfect the most perfect there's no other literature written like it like it so perfect in MA mathematics now the the eth chapter only reveals the scene of uh the scene of the seventh seal where nothing else is revealed not nothing is not revealed in the seventh seal now has nothing to do with the seventh chapter of of Revelation it's uh revealing of the seven seal is perfectly mute and if I only have time I'll try a few places to show you all the way back from Genesis the seventh chapter the seven seal is is spoke of from the very beginning in Genesis the seven these seals move right up could you remember this morning bringing these things up and watch tonight bring them up and you find out when it gets to that seventh seal she cuts off Jesus Christ is speaking himself told of the end time and when he got told all SE six seals when he got the seven he stopped there it is see it's a great thing now now uh we're going to speak here now on this seventh chapter just a minute to kind of bridge it in between sixth and seventh seal because that's the only material that we have to go on right now is the six between the six and seven seal is it calling out of Israel now I have many fine Jehovah Witness friends sitting here it's all or have been maybe some of them still Jehovah Witness but they've always applied Mr Russell did this 144,000 to being the supernatural bride of Christ see it's not it has nothing to do in the church age at all it absolutely Israel now we're go to read in a few minutes now this interview between the six the seals is a calling and sealing of 144,000 Jews called in the tribulation period after the church is gone see has nothing to do with the church age at all all called in perfectly harmony with the scripture Daniel's last three and a weeks uh lotted to Daniel's people not the Gentiles to Daniel's people and Daniel was a Jew now notice Israel Israel believes only her prophets and after they are Vindicated and nowhere through the church age since in the early Apostolic church has the Protestant church ever had a prophet tell me who it was the shortcut never they had in the early Apostolic age one called actopus which was a Vindicated Prophet but in when the Gentiles came in into inheritance of God and Paul turn to the Gentiles after Peter as we read last night had received from the Lord that he's taken a a people from the Gentiles for his name his bride than they never has been on the pages of History a gentile Prophet you just go back through history and find out why exactly it be contrary to the word exactly when the first went forth was a line that was prophets word the next went forward was a work sacrifice the next come forth was a cunningness of of man but we are promised in the last day that to return to the church again for the benefit of straightening up all that has been Mis Mis undone left undone for it's predicted year that the seventh Angel's message would finish the the mysteries of God now we've went through it all we see that it's perfectly in harmony with the scripture that's the reason now could you imagine when this person comes on the scene when he does remember it'll be so humble and things the the churches will miss it a long ways and could you imagine the churches still under the tradition of the reformers would ever receive a pro Prophet from God who would be firmly against her teachings and organizations now there's only one person could fulfill that only one spirit's ever been on the earth that I know of would either be it would have to be Elijah in his time and it was predicted that it would be which is nothing but the spirit of Christ when Christ come he was a fullness he was a prophet he was a the god of the prophets AMJ Christ look how they hated him but he come exactly the way the word said he would come but being that he was a prophet they blasphemed themselves away from the kingdom of God by calling the spirit of God which was Discerning and so forth an unclean spirit said he was is a fortune teller a devil that's is a fortune teller is a devil see devil Spirit certainly do you know that absolutely fortune telling is an impersonation of the prophet which is absolutely blasphemy before God now notice called in perfect harmony with the scriptures of Daniel's last three and a half years notice Israel's believer Believers only are told in the Old Testament to believe their prophets after the prophet has been Vindicated if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet how the Lord my thy God will make myself known to him speak to him in Visions through dreams interpret dreams somebody have a dream a prophet will be able to interpret it and if if he has a vision he speaks it I'll make myself known to him through visions and dreams make myself KN and if what he says comes to pass then hear that prophet because I'm with him if it doesn't then don't fear him at all get away just let it alone see now that's now Israel always to go to believe that and don't you see because why I I want you to catch this lesson good tonight now why because that's an order from God to them amen I don't care how many tracks that the Gentiles get over there and spread out I don't care how much you go through Israel with a Bible earning your arm proving this that or other they'll never receive nothing but a prophet exactly right for a prophet is the only one who could take the Divine word and put it in his place and be a Vindicated Prophet they'll believe it right I was talking to a Jew up here at Benton Harbor when that John Ryan being blind all of his life nearly received his sight they take me over there that House of David and this uh Rabbi come out with his long beard he said but what Authority did you give John Ryan side I said in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God he said far be it from God having a son see and he said uh you people can't cut God in three pieces and give him to a Jew make three Gods out of him you're a bunch of heathens I said I don't cut him in three pieces amen I said Rabbi would it be a strange thing for you to believe one of your prophets told the something wrong he said our prophets don't tell me nothing wrong I said who was Isaiah 9 and6 speaking of he said Messiah I said then Messiah will be a man Prophet is that right said yes sir that's right I said show me where Jesus missed it he said I said What relation will Messiah Prophet be to God he said he will be God I said that's right now you got so help me that Jew standing there and the tears rolling off his cheeks said I'll hear you sometime later I said Rabbi you believe that and he said look he said God is able these stones to rise children of Abraham I know he's in the New Testament I said right Rabbi now what about it he said if I preach that I'd be down there you know where the place sets on the hill there down there in the street begging my bread I said I would rather be down there begging my bread the Jew still got his hands on money you know I'd his name and gold on the I said I'd rather be down there eating salty crackers and drinking Branch water and know that I was in the harmony with God truth than I would be here my name on that building and go letters like that and know what I was away from God I know that you wouldn't listen to me no more so he want that's it you can't cut God no two or three pieces called father Son and Holy Ghost make three gods and hand it to a Jew it's very command is Thou shalt have no other gods before me I'm the Lord thy God why did Jesus say Jesus say hear you oh Israel I'm the Lord your God one God not three you'll never give that to him no no Prophet will ever talk about three gods word you never hear that no sir that's Pagan and Heathen is where it come from e [Music] h [Music] and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever I shall Feast at the table spread for me surely goodness and Mery shall

seated hey God bless you happy to be in the house of the Lord just a bit of a testimony behind the song I'm about to sing I have it all written down so I don't get lost but my car was having problems so I took it to the mechanic and it was its uh it was a turbo and so I took it over there and over the weekend I went up with the Robson who were kind to take me up there to Flagstaff and we had a wonderful time us there and um so we took it to the mechanic over the weekend and then I got it back and it was it was running fine then but once I got to where I was going to my uh martial arts I the

I'm pulling out the I start kind of just pressing on the gas a little bit and then the turn and then my car just kind of just like starts shaking I'm over here going 20 mil an hour while my RPMs is like in the fives and so I look behind me and then there's smoke coming out the back of my car and so I'm over here just on the side of the road while I'm waiting for my uncle and my grandfather to get there and so while I'm there I'm just thinking what's what's going on like Lord is this a test what's what do you what's going on and so we were going to take it to uh we were going to tow it but the towing was just too high especially late at night so we just left it in the parking lot overnight and I was singing this song to myself while I was waiting for my while I was waiting for my uncle and my grandfather and so after I was done singing Just to myself I felt led to pray over the vehicle so I walked around I put my hands on the hood and I just said God this is your vehicle you just you do what you want me to to should do with it if you want me to pay over $1,000 again I'll do it but then the next morning I get a call from my grandfather saying hey don't worry about it I'll pay for it you can pay me back later but then I get a text from the mechanic saying your Turbo's warranty you're not paying anything for the turbo it's all it's all paid for that's it and so just if any

of you we're missing quite a few this morning but we listened to last the uh greatest battle and brother Brown was talking about the stored up food and we get a partake of that this morning together so very appreciative that we have that I know we've probably all heard this maybe multiple times and maybe there'd be something that he could open and reveal to us yet in this late hour I'm sure there's probably still some Hidden Truths there at least to me that he could open and and teach me and help me so don't just brush it off this morning but let's enter in and receive from from the Lord today so we'll be finishing the seventh seal this morning uh rather this morning and this evening evening so hopefully we didn't scare you there I think we have a couple of hours left or an hour and 45 so just let the Lord open his his word to you God bless you we'll sing only believe only only be all things are possible only only long be all things are possible only let's make it real Jesus is here Jesus is here my Jesus is here and all things are possible oh yes our Jesus he is here Jesus is here Jesus is here and all things are possible Jesus is here amen you can be seated the seventh day messenger teaching in the seventh seal God bless you notice notice these prophets will come not only not only that the prophet Revelations 11 11 we've read some of it I want you to read as you study on the tapes and so forth they are absolutely Vindicated prophets by the sign of prophets then Israel's going to hear that now do you my Jehovah Witness friends understand now that these 144,000 has nothing to do with the bride there's not one bit of scripture to support that no it they're not they are Jews the elect is called out during the time time of the last three and a half years of Daniel's 70 weeks that's uh I keep quoting this so not so much to you all here but see people these tapes go everywhere see you understand that you hear me quoting back it's for that purpose notice now I see how they had to Blind do you see how they had Jesus or God had to Blind the Jews to keep them from recognizing Jesus if they knew if they only knew that that was seen the sign that he did if they had been in the right stage like it was back under the law what God commanded them about a prophet and they had seen Jesus did that they said this is the Messiah why was it those in that age who had their names written on the land's Book of Life his Apostles and so forth they seen it and recognize it what did the rest of them see they were blinded they couldn't see it they don't see it yet and they won't see it until she's born as a nation at one time am that the word Can't Fail remember the word Can't Fail don't care how many Sensations you have and what all takes place yet that word cannot fail it's going to be exactly the way God said it was see now we realize that these things must happen and that's the reason they didn't recognize Jesus when he perfectly identified himself to be the prophet even the little little Old Samaritan woman stand out there at the well he had never been in Samaria he just went up said he had need to go that way and he went up there and there's that little woman and heard her State she was in better shape to receive the Gospel than those religious priests and things of that day she done now Ze but in the face of all of their rejection yet one of their most noble man admitted that they knew he was a teacher sent from God I was talking to one of the finest doctors there is in the southern states in his office not long ago a very fine specialist in love a real Gallant man and I said to him I said Doctor I want to ask you a question said all right I said I notice your medical sign the staff you got a serpent wrapped around a pole what does that stand for said I don't know I said it stands or this it was a symbol of Divine Healing where Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness see which was only a symbol only a symbol of the true Christ now today medicine is a symbol of Divine Healing and though many of them don't believe it real good doctors do believe it but some of them don't believe it but the very emblem that they hold up testifies to the power of almighty God whether they want to believe it or not Hallelujah right there's a brass serpent hanging on a pole on the medical em now notice these Jews now the scales of blindness um was on these people's eyes they they couldn't help it it was there and God put it there and they are on there until the age at their promise uh this coming prophets you can send missionaries you can do whatever you want to Israel will never be converted until these prophets come on the scene and that will be after to the Rapture of the Gentile Church no more than the ox age could receive a lion's call for God has said in his word that a ox Spirit went out and in the reformers age a man went out see you just that's the only thing you they can receive that and in there and out they are blinded that's just all there is to it now notice but the age is coming when the Gentiles will be done with there's a tree and The Roots was Jewish and it was cut off and the Gentile was grafted in the wild olive tree and it's bringing forth its fruit now when that Gentile bride is cut off that bride tree I talked about and it's taken up in the presence of God God will wipe off them unbelieving Gentiles over here to the side the s sleeping virgin and graft again amen he promised to do it amen and until that time you just have to know where if you know where you're going well all right if you don't know uh you're stumbling in darkness now that's when the Jews will be converted during that age now like the church age under the power of the anointed promise They will receive Christ but now not while the Gentiles now we can see what kind of a message that these two prophets of Revelations 11th chapter will preach now you clearly can see exactly what they're going to do for the remnant are the 144,000 predestinated receives the Seal of god let's just read now listen real closely I want you to read with me can't going going to refer back to this just in a little bit seventh chapter now this is between the sixth and seven seal after these things after these things these seals The Sixth Seal was let loose and that's a tribulation period everybody understand that now Sixth Seal was let loose the tribulation onone after this watch after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that it should not blow upon the Earth or on the sea or on any tree Four Angels and I saw another Angel uh ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the sea the Earth the sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the servants not the bride servants not the sons servants Israel has always been God's servants amen the church is Sons see by birth Israel is his servant watch every place it's all Abraham was his servant we're not servants we're children Sons and Daughters of the of our God in their forehead now watch our God in their forehead and I heard the number of them that were sealed I want you to listen close to reading him and there were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel he perfectly names now if they had to be a British Israel deser something here listen how this takes the wind out of it of the tribe of Judah we seal 12,000 call the tribe of the tribe of Reuben were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD 12,000 watch your watch your tribes now and of the tribe of aser sealed 12,000 a tribe of NEP were sealed 12,000 the tribe of Manasses 12,000 and the tribe of Simeon sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Levi seal 12,000 of a tribe of Asia 12,000 that's sure I guess you pronounce that 12,000 the tribe of zerin 12,000 and the tribe of Joseph was sealed 12,000 of all the of The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 now there's 12 tribes 12,000 out of a tribe 12 * 12 is what 144,000 now watch were all of the tribes of Israel now what after this now here comes another group now the bride's gone we know that but watch this group come up after this I beheld in law a great multitude which no man can number of all Nations kindreds and people in tongue stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed in white robes and Palms in their hand and cried with a loud voice voice saying salvation to our god which Seth upon a throne and to the lamb and all the nations stood around about the throne and about the Elder and the four beast and fell Before the Throne on their faces and worshiped God saying amen blessings Glory wisdom Thanksgiving honor power might be to our god forever and ever amen and one of the elders now he's before the elders here we've seen him all through the seals and one of the elders answered unto me what are these now John being a Jew recognized his own people he see him in tribal farm that right he recognized and called each one of the tribes but now when he sees these that he's kind of puzzled and the Elder knows it so he says uh who are these what which are arrayed in white uh robes and when cometh the John answering out and I said un him sir thou knowest John didn't know them the all Kinders tongues and Nations and he said unto me these are he said unto me uh these are they which come out of Great Tribulation in other words the Great Tribulation and have washed their robes made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore they are Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and they he set upon a throne shall dwell among them they shall hunger no more neither shall they thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them sun light on them or any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them un living Fountains of water and God shall wipe all tears from their eyes now we open the get to the seal did you notice they were first we start now Israel and then we see the purge church not the bride The Purge Church by tribulation coming up here great number of real sincere hearts that come up out of the Great Tribulation not the church it's gone on the rde there's the church now we find out over a little later Jesus said that the throne would set in how the that stand in the Judgment each one now we find now that these people were sealed with the Seal of the Living God is that right these Jews what is the Seal of the Living God now uh not calling any hurt any feelings of this saying see do you know that reading after many of Scholars who write on this claim that this group here Blood Washed are actually see the bride did you know that many scholars also claim that the 144,000 is a bride what a something got to fit out your wrong uh in your right because there's something wrong now notice our Adventist Brethren say that the Seal of God is keeping the Sabbath day you know that but I want one Speck of script scure on it sure that's Sabbath keeping the Sabbath day the Seal of God see it's just a a somebody draw that idea but if you read Ephesians 4:30 it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day you of your Redemption yes when the medal work is done and you are come Christ comes to redeem his own you're sealed not until the next Revival when you're once sealed with the Holy Ghost it's a finished work that God has received you and there's no getting away from it Hallelujah you said well I had it and I went wait oh you didn't have it God said it goes on to the day of redemption you just argue with him but me tell the day of your Redemption notice as there were as they were a Remnant according to election these Jews are now a Remnant according to election in the days of Elijah's first Ministry to the Jews were 7,000 Believers were kept Away by the hand of God now there is in this Remnant time coming to their time to be 144,000 according to the [Music] election that the message at that time to believe the message be 144,000 now you see oh now just a minute brother I don't know about this election stuff well I never read it there all right let me see if it's right now let's turn back to Matthew and um get down here and find out if we can't find a little something on this somewhere I believe now that I'm right I haven't got roll down here but just come to my mind let's take at the ending the 30th verse where we went last night the ending of the six seed on the 30th verse now let's read that and see now where we get to the 31st verse see they'll see the son of man coming in glory now the 31st verse and he shall send his angels with great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other amen amen the elected will come out what is it and the tribulation period the God will call his elected and that is the Jews during that time the elected the Bible speaks of it Paul speaks of it according to the election there will be 144,000 according to the election that will believe the message out of literally millions that'll be there there were millions in Palestine at the days of the prophecy of Elijah and 7,000 was saved out of millions now according to the election where millions of Jews are gathering in into the Homeland it's become a nation there'll be millions in there but only 144,000 elected ones will be taken they will hear the message same thing it is in the Gentile Church there is a bride and she is elected and he will be called according to the election notice this all types the church perfectly the elected Believers others do not believe you can just tell it you tell a man a truth and let it be proven by the word and then vindicate it I don't believe it you can just don't fool with it no more am Jesus said not to said this is like casting Pearls Before swines said just leave them alone they'll turn you on their feet to make fun of you just walk away and leave him if a blind leads a blind I went to a man not long he come to me rather been arguing all around everywhere against Divine Healing and he come up and he said I don't believe you're Divine Healing I said mine I guess wouldn't be any good because ain't got any and he I said but God's is perfect said there is no such a thing I said you're too late to say that buddy H you done you done wait too long for that you might have argued a few years ago but there's another age on now Millions to testify I said you're you're too late now to say that he said uh he said I don't believe it I don't care what you do I said certainly not you can he said smite me blind said if you're you got the Holy Ghost like Paul said smite me blind I said how can I do it when you're already blind I said your father has blinded you to the truth I said you you're already blind and he said uh I wouldn't believe I don't care what you could do how much evidence you could prove or anything like that I still don't believe I said certainly it wasn't for unbelievers it was only for believers what was it see you know right then the election's off just don't fool with it at all Jesus did the same thing he said let them alone the blind leads the blind won't they all fall in the ditch but when it come to a little prostitute it struck fire what was it there's an elected seed laying there see seen it right now when it come to Peter there was elected seed laying there see and they saw it and all the father has G half past tense giveing me they'll come they'll come to me oh my I love that yes sir notice the Believers does believe it the unbelievers can't believe it so now if anybody wants to argue about serpent seed and things and you try to show them they won't listen to it just walk away see God don't argue neither as his children notice God's 144,000 elected Jews don't bow to the Beast is denominational ISM statues or anything though their nation is in a covenant with it at the time Israel is in a covenant but here's 144,000 it's not going to do it amen that's the elected same thing is right you're in the Gentile church now he an elected group you can't pull him in that kind of stuff won't believe it amen awesome light one struck and that settles it right then they see the sit happen then sit Vindicated and proved and like that and they look down here the Bible see that word just going you do might as well just quit fooling with them because they believe it that's all all though they can't explain it but they know they got it God says a lot of things I can't explain I know it's real anyhow all right this time was between the sixth and seventh seal that he calls these people spoken of by Jesus in Matthew the 24th chapter and the 31st verse that we've just read see trumpet sh um are the two witnesses of the on the trumpet sounds is a trumpet of the two witnesses of the age of Grace for the Jews one trumpet sound you notice one trumpet sound he said it sound the trumpet I notice over here 31st and he shall send forth his angels not one see it's two of them with a great sound of a trumpet what is it when God gets ready to speak there's a sound of a trumpet that's always his voice it's calling to B thing God speaks these angels will come forth with the sounding of the trumpet and you notice at the last Angel's message the trumpet sounds the first Angel's message a trumpet sound second Angels a trumpet sounded when he sent it out notice but when the seals were announced they were all in one Great Divine thing to call out a group of people there was one trumpet sound amen and seven SE seals were broke notice gather his elected Jews from the four parts of the heavens he U mentioned uh six seals as we have seen but not the seven seal he's never said nothing in here about the seven seal nowhere see right away the 32nd verse turns to Parables of the time of the calling of the elected Jews now watch here see and he'll send the angels with a trumpet he gather the elect from the four corners of Heaven now he start see don't say nothing about seven seal here see he spoke of The Sixth Seal first second third fourth fifth and sixth but notice now learn a parable of the Fig Tree when its branches is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that Summer's n so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the door that last that question they asked him and what will be the sign of the end of the world when you see these Jews when you see these other things taking place you know what take place now when you see these Jews talking to the Jews now watch what company is he talking to Gentiles Jews Jews see now he said you beh of all Nations for my name and so forth now when he said you see these Jews begin to put forth their buds over on well that Israel begins to turn back getting into her country when she gets there the church is ready to Rapture is's only three and a half years left until the end of the old world and she goes out into chaos and in comes the Millennium to the new new Earth said even at the door now 1,000 years on Earth is only one day with God and three and a half years what would it go to so many seconds in God's time that's when he said it's at the door very I saying you that this generation shall not be consumed done away with this people until all these things are what what won't be way they tried to kill a Jew off the Earth all the time they'll never be able to do it but notice the very generation of Jews that seen the return back into Palestine that generation would see these things happen amen and just the last two years she was fully become a nation with her own money and whatever that's you now where are we at friend amen the seals and everything opening up we're getting this in between here there it is see where we're sitting I hope you get I haven't got no education I know what I'm talking about but maybe I can't explain it to make sense to you but I hope that God takes the words that's mixed up and divides them out right amen and let you know what it is because it's we're at the door we're here at the time now notice see right away now it turns uh to these Jews and at the the end time he says what's going to take place we know even that now we know we're well aware that the tribes are scattered uh they have been for 2500 years they were prophesied to be scattered to the Four Winds did you know that we know that of course we won't have to go back and get picked that because we got something here really important I want you to see before you get too tired now get wore out notice we know even every tribe that is tribal chronology or whatever you want to call it or geology or the tribal positions are not no more together they're scattered everywhere the Jews are get into Jerusalem is not they don't even know the tribes they haven't got any more tribal banners or anything all know are Jews they were prophesied to be that way the world over now there book has been destroyed they don't know they say what tribe you from I don't know what tribe I don't know one from Benjamin one from this and one from that they don't know where they're from their books have been destroyed through the wars and for 2 200 years only thing they know they're Jews amen that's all so they know they're back in their Homeland they yet notice though they don't know their tribes but God amen amen I just love amen you know he even said this every hair on your head's number notice he loses nothing I'll raise it up against the last day though they have lost their the tribal banners they're who which one is and whether they're this or that they don't know whether they're from Benjamin or where from Reuben or are they sure where they're from but anyhow God calls them here now now notice in Revelations 7 we read this 12,000 of each tribe of the elected out of all of it there's 12,000 out of each tribe that's elected and they're set right you're in order am oh my what are they they're in tribal order yet they're not now but they will be amen they're in tribal order what will be in tribal order not the record Jew no but the ones that he elected the 144,000 will be set in tribal order amen oh my I would like to show you we won't go into it that's exactly what the church has to be amen right in order now I want you to watch real close and read with me for a minute now here's something that maybe you never noticed in the U the tribal calling I told you a while ago to read Revelation 7 read with me watch those tribes in Revelation 7 Dan and Ephraim is missing and not numbered with him did you notice that Joseph and Levi was substituted in their place amen do you know what I'm saying Dan and ephra is not there amen no sir but Joseph and Levi was substituted in the place of of of Dan and Ephraim why the the ever remembering God remembers every promise of his word amen oh I'd like to preach on that God don't forget nothing though it looks like like he told Moses Israel had been down there 400 years but had to go up that time he told Abraham that his seed would be a sojourning in a Strange Land for 400 years then he bring him out the mighty hand but then he said to Moses I have remembered my promise amen and I've come down to make good what I've said God doesn't forget he doesn't forget his curses neither does he forget his blessings but every promise that he made he stays with it amen here's why they were missing now if you watch now read I want you to read with me now go over to Deuteronomy the 20 uh 29th verse there 29th chapter there is a reason for these tribes not being there everything has got a reason for it Deuter we want to take the the U 29th chapter of of deuteron now the Lord so help us that we can understand now now we want to start in Deuteronomy the 29th chapter at the 16th verse now listen Moses speaking for you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which we passed by and ye have seen the Abominations and their Idols wood stone silver gold which were among them every want to carry a little some other little statue of saints of C you know something like that L therefore listen lest there should be among you a man woman or or a family or a tribe amen whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gall and wormwood and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he that he bless himself in his heart and say I have peace though I walk in the imagination of my own heart see people say What He blesses himself you know make a little Cross or something like you do now you see same thing and you see it's a heathen trait he He blesses himself in his own heart his own imagination in his own mind to ask drunkenness to thirst just drink that don't make any difference as long as you go to church all right the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord his jealousy shall smoke against that man and of all the curses that are written in this book don't take one word from her add one to it see shall lie upon him and the Lord shall block his blot out his name from under the heaven that's what he here on Earth see under the Heaven and the Lord shall separate unto him evil out of all the tribes of Israel according to all the curse of the Covenant that's written in this book of the law therefore If any man will serve an idol or keep an idol on him or bless himself in his own imagination of his mind and serve Idols God said man woman family or tribe his name will be completely blotted out from amongst the people amen is that right amen how true idolatry did the same thing in the church years ago and does today and how notice watch how the Antichrist tried to make an anti move how many knows that the devil T types and pns after after God SS what is what is sin is right thing perverted what is a lie is a truth misrepresented what is adultery is a right act legal act done wrong see now and trying to do this blot out of name did you notice in the church age the same Beast serves the images of dead people and so forth tried to blot out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ and give titles as Father Son and Holy Ghost amen same thing with that curse behind it like that Dan and Ephraim did just that under a hypocrite of a king in Israel amen an impostor jobon now notice in First Kings the um 12th chapter I know we're this to me it it it lays a background on what we can depend on what we see First Kings want to go to the 12th chapter U 25th uh to the 30th verse then jerob Shing and the Mount of eph dwelt there and went out into a built pimple and now jeroboam said unto in his heart see the imine of his heart now shall the kingdom turn to the House of David he was getting scared you see because the people might go out if this people go up to sacrifice in the house of the Lord at Jerusalem then shall the heart of this people be turned again to the Lord even to Riel king of Judah and they shall kill me and go unto RI um riom king of Judah where upon the king took counsel and made two caves of gold and said unto to them it is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem behold your Gods oh Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt and he set up the one in bethl and the other put he in D and this thing become a sin for the people went to worship before uh the one even to Dan see Ephraim and bethl and Dan and they set up idols and these went out to worship this and here we are plumbed down into the Millennium age almost and God still remembers that sin they're not even counted in there hey just as sure as he remembers every good promise he remembers everyone evil too just remember when that's the reason I believe friends I've always tried to stay with that word no matter how strange it seems see now they wouldn't think about that there then they didn't think about it then they thought well they got by with it all right but here they are over here in this Millennium age setting in when their names and tribes is blotted out from because they serve idolatry that God cursed didn't he say he hated the nickens and that Jezebel [Applause] okay away from it didn't he say he'd kill Jezebel's daughters with the killing of death which is eternal separation from his presence don't trust in it at all get away from it so God remembers notice but did you notice there is to be blotted out why under Heaven there was no immediate sacrifice that could give him the Holy Spirit to let him see these things but he did it anyhow in his own selfish mind but Ezekiel in his vision in the Millennium he sees them again in perfect order Ezekiel if you want to read it just put it down you read it to save time Ezekiel 48 1-7 also read 23 to 29 Ezekiel seeing every tribe just exactly in order all right and also in Revelations 14 John seen them again in tribal order that's tried every tribe to his place what Happ remember he said under the heavens that his name would be blotted out of the tribal ofar as long as he was under the heavens there would be no more and this 144,000 is down here in the tribal part yet right but you see they' been blinded they had only the sacrifice of bulls and goats see now notice he blotted them out under the heaven but the Gentile in the days of the Holy Spirit against that your name was taken completely off The Book of Life and could never have forgiveness in this world the world to come that right that's where we stand Israel under goats sheep they they did have a place as long as his own Earth here the tribes is missing they could never be included now all when he called over there 144,000 they were missing that's right they're not even numbered in there and Joseph and Levi is putting the place of Dan and EPA now you can look at there right there it is before you see and here's God's promise way back there hundreds and hundreds of years before that now what happened they were purged during the time of the awful tribulation period now if God's going to purge that that virgin that was a good woman but she just failed to get o in lamp and he's going to purger through persecution in there he puts them tribe right in there for the same thing and purges them during the time of the tribulation period because it is a a purging it's judgment but you see there a and look here here comes up the 144,000 after the purging of Israel and here comes up also the sleeping virgent comes up Purge and has white robes on see how perfect how beautiful that is just like Jacob in the time of trouble see they Jacob in the time of trouble he had done wrong but he went through the purging time because he had wronged his brother Esau see he deceived to get his Birthright but he went through a purging before he could have his name changed from Jacob to Israel which is a type of the order of God type today now we're turn out to the the eth verse of the uh of the first verse I mean of the eth chapter Revelation uh 81 I know you're tired and I just try to listen just for a few minutes now the god of Heaven helps my bre we must remember that this seventh seal is the end of time of all things right the things written in the seven seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundational World it every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world is end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's a it's even the end of time time runs out the Bible said so Matthew the 7th chapter I mean Revelations the 7th chap 10th chapter and one the seventh verse time Runs Out angel said time will be no more that in the days of this great thing to happen everything runs out in this time the end of the the at the end of this seventh seal notice it's the end of the church age it's the the end of the seven seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vs and even in the ushering in of the Millennium that's on the seven seal it's just like fireing a rocket into the air and that rocket explodes here and it goes up then it explodes again it puts out five stars one of those stars explode and blows out five stars in m and then one of them Stars explodes gos out five stars from it see it fades on out that's what the seven seal and this ends a time for the world it ends a time for this it ends a time for that it ends a time for this it ends a time everything just ended up on that seven seal now how's he going to do it that's what we don't know isn't it we don't know it's even time for all these things and the ushering in of the Millennium notice the breaking of this seal was so great that heaven was hushed by it in silence for the space of a half hour now is it great what is it it was hushed Heavens it wasn't a thing move for a half hour now a half hour might not be long if you're having a good time but in the suspense of between death and life it seemed like a Millennium it was so great Jesus never mentioned it another rest of them John couldn't even write of it no he forbidden to write here see it's just a just he didn't write but this is silence and the four and 20 Elders that stood before God there harping with their Harps they quit playing their Harps the Angels har they singing in heaven think the holy cherubin and sarapin that Isaiah saw in the temple with six sets or three sets of wings three two over his face and two over his feet and flying and day and night they're before God singing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and even when they walked in come into the temple the post of the temple move with their their presence and these holy sarapin hushed up Angels quit singing lying in the presence of God saying holy holy holy they shut up no angel singing no Praises no no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for a half hour all the host of Heaven Was silent for this half hour when this seven seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke amen the land breaks it you know what they were ODed by it I believe they didn't know that it was they just stopped why what is it now none of us know but I'm I'm going to tell you my my revelation of and uh I am not prone to be a fanatic if I am I'm ignorant of it I am I'm not giving away to uh such as uh larious uh carry-ons and imaginary things I said some things might been kind of strange to some people but when God comes around behind it and vindicates and says it's a truth then that's God's word they seems strange that way and now as certain as I stand in the platform tonight uh had the Revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner that I will speak to you by God's help of a fold of it and then you let's go to that first here's the Revelation to begin what I want to tell you what it is what happens is the those seven Thunders that he heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive Thunders rolling out now why let us prove it why it is the secret that no one knows about John was forbidding to write about it even even not a symbol about it why this is why there was no active in he activity in heaven it might give away the secret do you see it now amen if it's so great it must be included because it's got to happen but when the seven Thunders now notice when the seven angels come forth to sound their trumpets there was one Thunder when Israel was gathered there was a trumpet when time shall be no more the last trumpet one Thunder but here is seven straight Thunders right in a row one two three four five six seven that perfect number seven Thunders in a row uttered not n just just one two 3 4 five six seven straight then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens can't know about it nothing else because there's nothing to go on is a relaxing time it was so great till it's kept secret from the Angels now why if Satan should get a hold of it you might do great damage yes there's one thing he don't know now he can interpret anything he wants to and impersonate any kind of a gift amen I hope you're learning but he can't know this it's not even written in the word it's a total secret the Angels everything shut up if they made one move it might give something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped uh seven God's perfect number seven just right down the low seven Thunders utter straight together like you're spelling out something notice at that time John's started writing he said don't write it Jesus never spoke of it John Couldn't Write it Angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself amen said only God would know it amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up now you getting somewhere all right notice we can see the signs coming up if Satan could get a hold of it if you want something to happen now you'll have to take my word for this if I'm planning on doing something I know better than to tell anybody about it not that that person to tell it but Satan will hear it see he can't get in my heart there as long as God's got it closed up with the holy spirit so that's between me and God see he don't know nothing about it until you speak it then he hears it and I've triy I tell people I'll do a certain certain thing and watch the devil cut off every wheel he can to get there see to beat me to it but if I to get the Revelation from God this don't say nothing about it then it's different remember Satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do he's tried to do it we no it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he cannot impersonate there'll be no mimics to this because he don't know it you no way for to know it amen it's a third pull he just knows nothing about it he doesn't understand it but there's a secret LS beneath that amen glory to God in the highest amen yes thank you Lord I can never think the same the rest of my life when I seen now I don't know what I know the next step there but I don't know what how to interpret that it won't be long amen praise the Lord I've got roll down here when it happened if you can see here stop go no further than this right here I'm not prone to be a fanatic just and all God's people say amen always difficult to find exactly where to stop you said stop there we'll stop for the time and then we'll pick it up this uh evening and we trust if you can make it you'll hear that with us of course you talked a lot about the 12 tribes of Israel there and he'll continue the third pole and the Sabino Canyon and the rest of the seven seal this this evening so God bless you just been good to worship with you I know we have brother Glenn here
