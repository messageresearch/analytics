What a day of rejoicing that's going to be. meet brothers and sisters we've never met before, but I just feel the the same spirit and and just so thankful for us.

I am so thankful for that. I know my arms aren't strong enough, but I thank the Lord that his arms are longer than I could fall and they're stronger than we can fight against. And just thankful that something has held me and will continue to hold me. Amen. &gt;&gt; The trial of this world was getting closer. The pull I felt was more than I could bear. [Music] When I was on the verge of giving over, the strength within myself just wasn't there. Something keeps holding me. Every day I sing, he's helping me faithfully to overcome my trials, guiding me constantly, giving me victory. He's a reality. Something keeps holding me. And saints lay before me.

Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; You're giving me victory, [Music] Lord. your reality. Something keeps holding me. Amen. You can be seated. I'd like to ask my wife, Sister Joy, if she could come and sing as well. I know that she uh she said there's another song and you don't need to call on me, but Joyy's been fighting been in a war with with the adversary the last few days. She tries to bring a box of rattlesnake and she has sent it back. But he's persistent. And so she was having she was having a good day until she started to go in the in their family room and just play the piano between services and just start worshiping. Then he comes again to attack. And so we just want to say, you know what, Satan, you're not welcome here &gt;&gt; and you're not going to take our praise away from us. We're God is still good and we want to thank him for it. So just in light of that, if you could just worship with joy tonight. It's a sacrifice of praise that she's making. And so just just worship with her this evening if you would. Amen. I just want to say that that service about Jesus being the lamb and he is my healer and he's touched me many times before and I just want to thank him and he'll do it again for me. [Music] How Good you are. How great your love. How amazing is your grace? How beautiful your face. Oh, how good you are. How great your love. How amazing is your grace? How beautiful your face.

[Applause] How many can say amen to that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. Learn to trust in God. Let's stand as we sing that. [Music] Through it all, oh through it all, [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, oh through it all, I have learned to depend upon his word. Now I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials only come to make me strong. Now I can sing through it all. Oh, through it all I have learned to trust in Jesus. Yes, I have learned to trust in God. Through it all. Oh, through it all I have learned to depend upon his word. Now I thank God for the mountains. I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valley. I thank him for the storms he's brought me through. For if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know that he could solve them. I never know what faith in God could do. So I can say that through it all. Yes, Lord. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I have learned to trust in God. [Music] Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon it. One more time. Through it all, it's through it all. Through it all, I learn to trust in Jesus. Jesus, I've learned to trust you. And my God is through it all. Through it all, I've learned to depend upon his word. Yes, I've learned. I've learned I've learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Is that your testimony tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. That we can depend upon his word. Amen. And we're coming to the portion of the service where we're hearing the preaching of the word of God. Amen. The most important part of this service. And we certainly enjoyed that meeting this morning. &gt;&gt; I really enjoyed it. It was so good. I thank the Lord for it and uh got so many good things out of there. My heart was really blessed and like I said that the Lord Jesus was here this morning &gt;&gt; and he promised he would gather where two or three would be gathered in his name. He said he would be there &gt;&gt; and he's here tonight. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Are you going to receive from him? &gt;&gt; And that's our expectations. I'm not expecting to receive from brother Mark or anyone else but from him. &gt;&gt; And I believe he has everything we have need of for this life's journey. &gt;&gt; And we don't know when this journey is going to end, do we &gt;&gt; on this life? We don't know. &gt;&gt; But we're here now. And we're here to receive whatever the Lord Jesus has for us. Amen. And so we appreciate our dear brother Mark. He's here with us. And his original plan was to stop by this morning and be gone. and I squeezed on him a little bit and uh so he's here with us tonight. Did I do a good job? But keep I think I did a good job. I he said he got bamboozled. So we appreciate brother Mark. Um I took a trip I I think I went to West Africa that time and I asked Brother Mark to come. I couldn't think of any um you know there's several ministries you can have come in while you're gone and he was one of those that I can have him come in and take the services for us. I have a lot of confidence in him and his spirit and the way he does things and they have meetings next weekend ones that we'll spend eternity with. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So as he prepares to come and as he just takes his time we'll sing Amazing Grace. Why don't you reach over and shake somebody's hand and let's start that part. When we been there 10,000 [Music] years, Christ shine as the sun may sing grace. How sweet the sound. [Music] Amen. The part that says a wretch like me, it's easy to point and say, "Yeah, a wretch like him or a wretch like her." You they came from the world, you know, they they're wretches. But when you can recognize that you were the wrench and before the foundation of the world, you were in his mind, that makes you a worthy wrench. Washed by the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when you've been washed, the wrench part is dropped and you become worthy. That's why when we sing that song, we should recognize, hey, this is for me. &gt;&gt; He died for me. You know, what did I do? Nothing. But he did it all. No wonder brother Ram liked that song. Amazing Grace. How sweet the sound. Amen. God bless you. Welcome to Tucson, Arizona. Shalom tabernacle. Um I'm glad most of you came back. You must love the message around here. A lot of times we'll take a nap in the afternoon. We won't wake up in time. You know, because I used to hate taking naps when I was young. I I just that was for old people. And then I turned what past 25 and I'm like I gotta have a nap after Sunday morning because if not I wouldn't make it through the day. But you know how many really enjoyed that word this morning? &gt;&gt; You know I was the interpreter and I really enjoyed it. I don't know about you but I was I was having a good time. I said forget them. I'm getting the blessing myself right now. Double blessing. &gt;&gt; A blessing in Spanish and then a blessing in English. And I I love it when the minister is inspired when he knows what he's talking about &gt;&gt; and he believes what he's talking about that makes it even more precious because the word of God should quicken us. &gt;&gt; It should it should make us the most happiest people in the world. There's something about when God's anointing comes down and you're hearing the message and it's like &gt;&gt; that's for you. &gt;&gt; You're like, "Wow, praise the Lord. I feel no wonder Brian used to say I feel religious right now." Why? because a spirit would come down and it would remind him you were in my mind &gt;&gt; in the beginning and you have a job to do. You have a message to preach and you know God uses so many different ministers. I mean there are so many different ministers in this world. People that have been preaching for years, people that are dying to preach. Those ones I got to pray for. I'm thinking why would you want to preach in the first place? But they're dying to get up here. I don't know why. You know, this is not a highpaying job. You know, we don't have a retirement plan with here on the earth church. you know, we're working 24/7, &gt;&gt; but I think everybody has their own grace &gt;&gt; to speak to the people. And the brother one, I've known him for a couple of years, and I love the way he speaks, his Spaniard accent, you know, and uh I thought to myself, one day, I would love to have him preach at our convention, and God granted it this year. &gt;&gt; He's preaching for us on Sunday. So, if you can't make it, you know, um you can watch it on live service after you finish doing your church service, okay? Don't don't don't be skipping to come, but just it's there on on the website. Brother Paul Ball says, "That's right." Brother Paul says, "So, uh, anyway, so we're looking forward to having a wonderful time in the Lord." And I love fellowship. I really do. I love being around people. Like brother Paul said, we're going to spend an eternity together. If we can't get along now, &gt;&gt; one of us ain't going to heaven. It's as simple as that. That brother, I don't know about that brother. Well, you better watch that, brother. Because if it was Saul of Tarsus here in the church this evening, nobody would want to sit by him &gt;&gt; because he's a murderer. He's a persecutor. You know, he's he hates God's people, but yet he's religious. And we want to distance ourselves from him. But look at the grace of God &gt;&gt; that God takes this wretched man, Paul, and he converts him and he changes his heart. And who would have thought that he would have been the first messenger to the first church age? And who would have imagined that our prophet would have said what Paul preached? &gt;&gt; I have preached &gt;&gt; what a blessed people we are. This is why we should be the most happiest people on the earth. &gt;&gt; That's why when you come to church, please come with a smile &gt;&gt; because when I'm up here, I can see all of you. &gt;&gt; I can see everybody of you, you know. Are you happy? Yeah, I'm happy. No, don't be lying. Smile. Well, this is this is my smile. Get used to it. Like, okay. But we should be happy to be in the house of God because this is life for us. &gt;&gt; We were born for this church. You weren't born to be rich or to be a star, to be a famous singer, you know, Hollywood actor, you know, forget them. They're all going to hell. If they don't get converted, &gt;&gt; but you were born for a reason. You were born to praise God. &gt;&gt; You were born to serve. You were born to to suffer in life, to get sick, to to get tempted, to get tried, to get kicked around. How many of you been kicked around before? It ain't a very good feeling, church, get kicked around. But you know what? Get up and, you know, dust it off and get keep on pressing on because this ain't home. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what, we're almost home, though. &gt;&gt; Look at the signs around us at the time. They're getting darker and darker and man has lost his mind. &gt;&gt; He's gone crazy. The the black is white and the white is black and it's like, what's wrong with our world today, &gt;&gt; you know? But thank God that this never changes. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham preached a message Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. He preached that message 28 times. &gt;&gt; What does that tell you? How important it is to know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, and tomorrow. And if you live to be 100 years old, Brother Levi, if you do, the day you die, because you're all going to die one day, not now, but hopefully later. the day you die, he's still the same yesterday, &gt;&gt; today, &gt;&gt; and forever. &gt;&gt; But when we die, we go to eternity and we become eternal. Amen. So, we don't want to talk about death because that's a very scary thing. We're going to talk about seed work this evening. And uh if you just bow your heads real quickly, we're going to pray, then you can be seated. Heavenly Father, we are so thankful to be in your house of worship once again. &gt;&gt; Lord, we say that this is the most happiest place that we wouldn't rather be anywhere else. Lord, even though we got problems, &gt;&gt; we got trials, we got tomorrow, some of us got to work, we don't want to go to work, we're probably even thinking of calling in sick. We don't know, Father, but we don't know how long we're going to be here. But we have a promise that when we hear your word, there's something that tells us it's not very far away. &gt;&gt; And we hear a small still voice within this message that speaks to us and tells us, "Hold on, my child. Joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; One day there's going to be a resurrection. &gt;&gt; Dead in Christ going to rise and we who remain shall be caught up together to meet our blessed to meet our blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Father, bless this church, the sanctuary. Lord, it's a this is a gift to your people. Father, this is your house. Lord, it's been dedicated for your service. Father, bless your people. If a bystander would come in one day, a wanderer would come in. Lord, may you find hope, may you find presence and know that here you dwell amongst your children. Father, your word is already blessed, but we are the ones that need the blessings. Father, if we're tired, take away our tiredness. If we're sad, give us joy. If we're depressed, give us, Lord, victory in the name of Jesus. Father, I commit myself into your hands and this church and this ministry and your bride throughout the world. Lord, in the precious name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. Let's read real quickly the book of Amos 3:3 3-7. Uh the the title of this message is seed word. &gt;&gt; For something to grow, it's got to be a seed. &gt;&gt; And for the seed to grow, it's got to be water. And we know that the natural types is spiritual. The the the the good fertile ground is a good heart that will receive the word of God. And the water is a Holy Spirit that will make that person grow. You know, there's something about somebody who loves the Lord that you just love being around them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I I I have found people in Colombia that I just love being around. Why? There's something about them that just attracts me to want to hang out with them. You know, take them to buy drink some coffee, buy coffee for them, you know, buy him a a donor or something, but just hang out with them because these are fun people to be around. These are children of God, you know. &gt;&gt; You know, and you know, your your pastor, he's one of our our our favorite ministers. uh and uh because we we just love brother Paulo and you know I think he's a message believer he's I think he's a Christian too you know there's something about that we just really enjoy your pastor and uh thank you for the opportunity to to speak even though I feel I was bamboozled into this one but I already preached this morning in English you know but the good news is that I have nothing good to say &gt;&gt; this is not my word that's right &gt;&gt; one day when I stand before God he's going to ask me what did you do son I'm going to say nothing. Cuz what I preached, it wasn't even my word. It was your word. What did you accomplish in life? Nothing. You nothing. You You didn't do a great accomplishment. No, I didn't do nothing. I I did the best I could do, &gt;&gt; but I did did make one decision. The only thing I could give God was my heart. &gt;&gt; I gave him my heart. and he took it and he changed it and he mold it and he's still working on us church &gt;&gt; because we have not reached perfection because if we have reached perfection we'd have been gone a long time ago. &gt;&gt; But something is holding us back church. &gt;&gt; Maybe the last one hasn't come in yet. &gt;&gt; Maybe the last one is you. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's me. I don't know. But when the last one comes in, and the prophet has said it before, the doors of mercy will close to the Gentile people &gt;&gt; and God will turn to the Jews, the original ones that were looking for him &gt;&gt; because we weren't looking for him, &gt;&gt; but grace found us. Aren't you glad about that? &gt;&gt; Amen. My father used to go me and say, "Boy, read the scripture and sit them down." So, I'm going to do that because I can still hear his voice right now. Amos 3:es 3-7. And the question is, can two walk together except they be agreed? Will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey? Will a young lion cry out his den if he hath taken nothing? Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no jin is for him? Shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all? Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, and God hath not done it? Surely, the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealed his secret to his servants, the prophets. Hebrews 13:8:9 reads, "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Be not carried away with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meat which have been profited them and have been occupied therein. Heavenly Father, we know that your word is blessed. We are the ones that need the blessings. Father, as we as we for a few moments speak about you, Lord, may you just come down and touch our hearts. Father, we want to leave from here, Lord, strengthened and encouraged by your word. Father, we want to have that hope that when we wake up tomorrow, Lord, that hey, I can make it. God's grace has brought me this far, and God's grace will take me even farther, Lord. We need you now more than ever. And we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. I I I always tell the church because the prophet has said it before that we should be the most happiest people in the world. &gt;&gt; Now when you when you when you define what happy is is somebody who always is full of joy like a little bubbling spring. Something is always bubbling in him. And I think to me uh when I was growing up you know as young people very young we we always couldn't wait for church to end &gt;&gt; because we wanted to go outside and play basketball because basketball was very important for young people to bond with. until somebody started losing. They got tempered got out of control. &gt;&gt; And then we grew up and after a while we we got a more of a revelation that this is the best place to be is in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Because we we are here for one purpose. We are here to be strengthened. We are here to feed the spiritual man. &gt;&gt; You know this morning our souls was rejoicing. We've heard it before. &gt;&gt; Nothing new. But we're reminded by the spirit that this is God's word. And so we rejoice this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. and almost, you know, we didn't want to dismiss. We wanted to stay here for a little bit longer. &gt;&gt; Well, the ones that weren't hungry did. And, you know, it just bubbles in our hearts when the word of God is spoken. There's something about that it just brings us to life. I I always remember my father. My father was, you know, he he loved this message with all his heart. And when he when he pressed forward, he made the commitment, I'm pressing forward, not going backward. And whenever he would testify to new conference in the church and he would speak about the the the creation of the squirrels, you know, and the stopping of the storm, my father always told that story like it was for the first time with so much anointing. And I used to love hearing my dad talk about the squirrels. He get praise the Lord. The creative word, our prophet called the squirrels and then the voice tells him, didn't you ask for three year? You know, and my my father was he with so much enthus. He never got tired of saying it. And I think that a child of God, the closer you get home, the more spiritual we should be, the more happier we should be. Church, &gt;&gt; you know, I tell the church, I'm not looking to fill up my church with people. I'm looking for the people to get filled up. &gt;&gt; You know, a bonfire doesn't take 50 matches. It takes one match. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I have an analogy. One day I was cleaning the yard. I don't do it very often because it takes inspiration and sometimes I don't get enough inspiration. So, but that one day I got inspired to clean my yard cuz my wife said, "When are you going to clean the yard?" So, I got inspiration really quick. And I started cleaning the yard and I'm I'm out there whacking. I'm sweating. Nobody brings me a glass of tea, but I'm out there cleaning the yard, you know, clean the yard and rake, you know, and when I got done, I just felt led to start a bonfire. It was nice cooling. I thought, man, I'm gonna start me a bonfire, Brother Po, and I'm gonna enjoy the bonfire by myself because I deserve it. So, I gathered wood and I thought, I don't got time to wait for it to ignite. So, I'm going to get a gallon of gas. Hello. &gt;&gt; Like brother Juan said this morning. Okay. Okay. And so, I got a gallon of gas and I drenched the wood and I'm thinking, this is going to be good, brother. Oh, I'm going to enjoy this fire. And I drenched the wood and I just, you know, then I I I sat back, you know, and I got a match and I waited for the fumes to, you know, kind of raise up, you know, and it reminded me of this. How many of you have been in the message for more than 20 years? 30, anybody 30, 40, 50, 55? And I thought, how many messages have we heard in 50 years? &gt;&gt; And every time I heard a message, brother, there was life in that word. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter if an evangelist came from Mexico or Colombia or Spain or whatever, when he spoke the word of God or he preached the word of God and he brought forth the message, there was inspiration in that message. Even if you go back and listen to a message from 1946, the prophet preaching, the inspiration is still there, church. &gt;&gt; Whenever you feel tired and weary and depressed, put in a tape from 1946, and you're still going to feel the anointing &gt;&gt; and that's going to tell you that the word of God, it is still bubbling. &gt;&gt; And it reminded me of this wood here's all these fumes. This all that flames are igniting. For years, we've been hearing the message. We're so ignited with so much message, message after message. I've heard I've heard this many tapes. I've I've heard this many quotes. You know, we got to the point that when if I start to to mention the verse in your mind, you can already finish it. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God created. &gt;&gt; Ah, see why I know the Bible. I've known it for years. And here's all these fumes just evaporating, but something's missing. And I sat there for a while and waited. I could see I could see the the fumes from the gas just rising like this is going to be good. Real good. And I got back, brother. And I just got that match and I went, you know what I heard? And I said, I have created this. And I sat down and I enjoyed my bonfire. It was burning like, "Oh, it's just beautiful." And I thought for years we've been sitting in church listening to messages, beautiful inspired messages. You know, we just be dowed with so much gas. &gt;&gt; Quote after quote, you know, Brother Bram quote something and we can finish the quote. Why? I've heard it before. &gt;&gt; I've heard that before. Yeah, that's a beautiful quote. I love that quote. And that's as far as it gets. And year after year, just quote after quote and quote and scripture and scripture and we know all these songs about the prophet end time message and just and brother we're just sitting there like a pile of wood &gt;&gt; with so much fire but something's missing. I thought Lord if you could just send a spark &gt;&gt; upon your church &gt;&gt; brother would be an explosion. &gt;&gt; God doesn't need a full church to have a revival. He needs one person. who's a religious arsonist &gt;&gt; who loves the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when that brother gets full of the fire, brother, he'll come to a church ignited &gt;&gt; and his life will will inspire you, brother. &gt;&gt; There was a sister in our church that hadn't come for a while and she went to the world when she came back. And I would see her in church and and you know, in my church, I I'm one of the musicians and I'd be watching her because a pastor can do that, okay? I would watch her and you know she she would would raise up her hands and she would begin to cry. Man, that blessed me. I thought here is a child of God that's crying and her and her worship to the Lord. It inspired me and I'm the pastor. I'm supposed to inspire you. And here was a member inspired me because her fire her her spirit to worship to praise God. She didn't care no what she got to do. She'd raise up her hand. They start crying and I thought, "Wow, that inspires me." If it all could be like that, that we'd come to church and forget who's here. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm not ashamed to cry, &gt;&gt; I don't want to bite you to see me. What's wrong, brother? No, I got something in my eye, brother. Well, there sure is a lot of it cuz there's tears everywhere. &gt;&gt; You know Jesus when he wept, he didn't hide behind. No, he wept like a man because he his heart was broken. He had been rejected. the creator had been rejected by his creation &gt;&gt; and it broke his heart and he cried, you know, he weep over Jerusalem. Why? Because he had emotions and and I think to myself, when the presence of God comes down, why do we got to be so uptight? &gt;&gt; Why we got to be, you know, well, someone's going to see me. Let them see me. &gt;&gt; Who cares? &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was made for a reason. I was made to I was made to praise God. I was made to worship God. Maybe I don't have the the best voice in the church, but I don't care if I can sing from my heart. By the time my song gets to heaven, God is rejoicing &gt;&gt; and he's saying, "Oh, what a beautiful song this my son is singing." He's singing it from his heart. &gt;&gt; He might be getting condemned by the other church members because he can't sing worth a hoot, &gt;&gt; but I but his but his praises, his adoration have reached my presence &gt;&gt; and I'm receiving them. That's what God wants. &gt;&gt; He wants your praise. &gt;&gt; When you're tired, when you're weary, when when you feel, oh, I I don't feel like going to church till Wednesday. I had a rough day. You know, God will understand. Will he? &gt;&gt; When you get to when you get to the end of your road and you're breathing your last breath, will it matter how much money you had in the bank? Will it matter how much property you had or how many times you you shout amen in church and really didn't mean it? You know what will matter the most? If in your heart there's a beating and that beating is Jesus &gt;&gt; and something tells you you're a few beats from eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the most glorious age for a believer when he comes to the end of his road and he has lived his best for the Lord. He's given his all. Lord, I I like what brother Brandham said. If the Lord were to offer me a thousand years of of of of riches, you know, and have power and all these things, you know, but at the end lose everything or ask me, do you want a hundred years of misery? You know, who wants misery? Every time we pray, we're always saying, Lord, bless me. &gt;&gt; Lord, give me, Lord, open the door. We never say, Lord, close the door. or Lord, can you please send me another trial? Because yesterday was easy peasy like my grandkids say. Easy peasy whizzy. Even squeezy, grandpa. It was easy. You know, we were always praying for blessings. We're always saying, "Lord, bless me. Give me, give me, give me." But when we get to the end of life, what really matters? I I I still can hear the words of my mother. Mikosh, she said, "All my life, I have prepared for this moment &gt;&gt; to die, to go see Jesus." And I'm thinking, what a what a revelation that that's why we're here. &gt;&gt; We're preparing to go home, not to stay here. &gt;&gt; You know, we're not looking for an extension in life to to live longer. You know, you know, this world has nothing to offer. &gt;&gt; The world is falling apart or the our system is broken. Our money system has no value. &gt;&gt; Morals have gone. Our politicians are more crooked than crooer. And and then our president that we have, you know, I don't know who voted for him, but he's Poco Loco, but yet the people are even crazier because they voted for him, you know. And I'm thinking this world is so messed up that we don't care who's in office as long as we get whoever we voted for, you know. And we're so consumed with life and the problems in life that we forget why we're here. And when we come to church, we're so filled with problems of life and oh, if you only know my problems and here's Christ talking just wanting to have a few moments with you. &gt;&gt; Burbam said, "If you gave if you told God, you know, if you gave him second place, he would take second place. You gave him third place, he would take third place. &gt;&gt; He'd take fourth, he take fifth place in your life, but he should be the first place." Come on. &gt;&gt; When we when we think about who we are, what we're doing in this age, and we ask ourselves, why is it that God chose to live in this most glorious age? You know, we we've done nothing great. You know, the message we preach was one that was given to us already. &gt;&gt; When a brother said, "Brother Castile, that was a tremendous message to preach." I'm like, "Yeah, well, it wasn't mine. I'm just repeating what the prophet said. God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; in this last hour to bring a message to call out a people to prepare a people to take his people home to live with his people forever. &gt;&gt; Who doesn't want to live forever? Churchmen, &gt;&gt; we should be happy. And the reason that I mention that is because on June or July the 6, the quote of the day said this and it said, "God don't want you to be frowny. God wants you to be happy. &gt;&gt; The human heart was made to be happy. &gt;&gt; What makes you happy? Jesus loves me. &gt;&gt; Should that be the most glorious thing that Jesus loves me? That that I've been so blessed to to have a message brought to me in this last hour &gt;&gt; that I have access to the message at any hour of the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when I can't sleep, you know what I do? I put on the tape of Brother Brandham and then I fall asleep within 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; Well, that that that's not very good. No, it is good &gt;&gt; because the anointing it relieves my stress and it knocks me out. How many want to get knocked out today? I do by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; and he says temper will cause cancer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, I I have battled with a temper for when I do a certain job because I don't like to make mistakes. And I've learned to just be I say, "Lord, temper." Why? He says, "Because temper will cause cancer. Don't ever be upset. Just walk in his love." &gt;&gt; Amen. knowing that you're walking in him and nothing can harm you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can harm you. There's neither powers, things present, things future, nothing can separate us from him. We're in him and we never come in our own will. He by choice, like this morning, he &gt;&gt; by choice elected us and brought us to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's his business to take care of me. &gt;&gt; No man can pluck them from my father's hands cuz he's the greatest of all them. Amen. It's the father who care who takes care of it who's got any more power than God. So what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you? The whole powers that created the universe. Amen. that took the solar system and blew it like that and every star went into its place. Sure. And he watches over you. Amen. That's the kind of father &gt;&gt; that we have. &gt;&gt; You know, I have three grandkids. The newest one came about a month and a half ago. Her name is Rosalia Castillo. Beautiful little girl. My granddaughter. I've been waiting for years for this one. And my my oldest grandson, you know, there there's something about grandsons, you know, they I love them to death. And sometimes my kids think, you know, you never loved us like that. I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I did. I did." But there's there's something special about grandkids. And my oldest one, he whenever I see him, you know, sometimes he misbehaves and he gets out of control, but I still love him. There's something about his character that, you know, he he can walk up to me and say, "Grandpa, can I live with you forever?" And just by saying that, all the wrong that he's done, it is erased. And I say, "Yes, you can, me, let's talk to your dad. Let's get your social security and you can come and live with grandpa forever." Cuz he said, "I want to be with you forever." You know, and their day when when we went to go eat, he he said, "Grandpa, I need to go to the bathroom, but he only wanted me to take him." So I took him. He goes and he sits in the toilet, locks the door because he needs privacy now. He's 5 years old. Grandpa, I need privacy. Like, okay. So he goes inside, locks the stall, sits down on the toilet, and starts singing from his heart. I'm thinking, who sings in the toilet at a restaurant, but his heart is so sincere, you know, and and and and he writes his own songs. I don't know where he gets the words, but he writes his own songs. And next, they know I'm here and there, and he loves my heart. He come back and he loves my heart. And I'm thinking, "Wow, little kid so small singing to the Lord." I wondered what was God thinking at that moment. What a beautiful child &gt;&gt; praising me. And then even when you get to the end, he would say, "And loves my heart." I'm thinking, "Where do you get that part from?" You know, and and so so sincere, so so so pure, you know, that they they that they so so wonderful children, you And I'm thinking if a grandfather can love his child like that with all the mistakes because sometimes they do get to control. They get too loud. We got to say, "Hey, all right, that's enough. Shut up. You're too loud." You know, they're they they're going in my truck and one of them was singing one of the Christian songs and the other brother was saying, "Hey, you're singing too loud. Shut up." and my grandson would sing even louder, you know, and I'm thinking, you know, all the imperfections, I love them. And and and if we could love our children like that, I thought, what about the love of God that he loved us so much that he would think about us before we even came here &gt;&gt; and we have everything in its place for us to come and enjoy of his blessings. And I thought, you know, what a privilege that in this hour we got to have the privilege of of of knowing a prophet that God sent with the message to prepare us for that day. You know, you just cannot imagine what awaits us, church. You can see a picture of heaven and think, well, that's a beautiful picture of heaven, but it does not compare to what it is. And then God sends a prophet because God does nothing unless he talks to a prophet first. If it was not for that, we wouldn't have a message today, church. But you know even the prophet was so humbled that he would say I'm not a preacher or a great public speaker but from my heart I'm trying to introduce you to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday &gt;&gt; today and forever. You know the prophet never said me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me me. He always said he. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he asked the question, what kind of a sign will the seed sign be at the end time? And so I believe that we're living in the end time church. &gt;&gt; I believe now more than ever we should be getting close to the Lord, not farther away. Uh there's so much that's taking place in this world. It seems depressing, but I remind myself that it's not God's word that has failed or the message. It's humanity that is filled. &gt;&gt; And so God promised to say in this last time a word seed. That's why this morning when I was hearing the word of God, I was rejoicing because there's something about the word of God that it quickens us, that it inspires us, and we can say, "Wow, amen to the word of God." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be wonderful to live in that kind of an atmosphere all day long? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine going to work saying, "Woo, glory, hallelujah, at work." just constantly praising God, you know, and when they yell at you, okay, boss, praise the Lord, &gt;&gt; you know, just being so happy, you know, &gt;&gt; that God sent a prophet with his word, &gt;&gt; to restore us back to our original condition. &gt;&gt; And the more you you you walk in the presence of the Lord, the more you love being in the presence of the Lord. Brother Bram says in the message the exposition of the seven church ages part four the smir the smearian church age he says as the eternal god was manifest in the sun and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bbodiedly. How many of you heard that before? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son. Even so we eternal in his thoughts in eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word seed &gt;&gt; manifest in flesh &gt;&gt; and those eternal thoughts are the sons of God even as we are so-called now we did not become seed by the rebirth. We were seed and therefore we're reborn. For only the elect can be reborn &gt;&gt; because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened &gt;&gt; in nonseed. There is nothing to quicken. &gt;&gt; So when when I see all that God has done for us, you know, we ask ourselves, what do we do to deserve this? What do we do to merit God's grace? And it should make us realize, hey, we should be happy for what God has done for us. Now, everything on earth today, its origin started in Genesis, the prophet says. And we have today and now we have things today that did not begin in Genesis because it's been hybrid. Anything hybrid is a phony. It's no good. It cannot produce itself. Anything that's hybrid is man-made and cannot bring itself back again. Take corn for example, hybrid. Make it great big ear and what does it do? All right, if you want to eat it on the big ear, but what happens to it? Plant it back again and it cannot produce itself. It's no good. It's dead. Therefore, anything that wasn't spoken by God in the beginning is a hybrid. That's why it's so important that as believers, we should know our message. &gt;&gt; We should know our scripture because many times when a pastor gets up here on the pulpit or a visiting minister, you don't know what he's going to say. &gt;&gt; You know, I I I was telling the church, you know, if it's the word of God, it should be amen to the word of God. &gt;&gt; And so, I asked him 10 questions, one of our Bible studies, I'm going to ask you 10 questions. Whatever is God's word, say amen. Whatever is not, don't say amen. So, I was testing the church. I said, "Okay, the first question. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." Everybody said, "Amen." I said, "Good. We're off to a good start. One for all." And asked him 10 questions. Then I got the one that said that there we are expecting an eighth messenger. And nobody said, "Amen." I said, "Glory to God." Somebody's being paying attention. &gt;&gt; And I thought to myself, after I asked the 10 questions, I thought to myself, "These people know their message. But if they know the message, why aren't they saying amen to it? &gt;&gt; If it's the word of God, it's either amen or it's not. &gt;&gt; You know, whenever I study and I find a quote, I think to myself, wow, this is powerful. &gt;&gt; The church is going to love this one. &gt;&gt; It's inspired. And and I get and I preach and I read it, you know, inspiration. And I hear a few, amen. I'm like, did I read it wrong? Is that what the prophets? And I go back. Wait a minute. Wait, that's what he said. All I got was just two amens. &gt;&gt; There there's something wrong be 40 years, &gt;&gt; 30 years hearing this message. Brother, we need a spark in the church. &gt;&gt; We need a revival &gt;&gt; to be revived. Homie had bring it back again, church. You know, but but the devil knows that that his time is running out of out of time and he's he's fighting us tooth and nail to hold us back from the blessings. &gt;&gt; You know, I have so many blessings for my grandsons. So many blessings. But you know what holds me back is their attitude. They misbehave. I hold them back. Every time I go to the store, I'm looking to buy them something. You know, my shoes are falling apart, but it's okay. Got to buy the toy for the grandkid. Why? looking to bless them and God the same way too. He wants to bless us but we're we're not ready for the blessings church. No prayer being should be a revival &gt;&gt; because prayer is one of the most powerful tools that we have is prayer. &gt;&gt; There's nothing more glorious than breaking the barrier &gt;&gt; and entering into his glory and praising God. &gt;&gt; But to get there it's a battle. &gt;&gt; Why? Because when we come and kneel down at the altar, you know, it's got carpet, it's comfy. And then we kind of just kneel against the the stepping, you know, we get more comfortable and we start praying. After a while, you know, the leg falls asleep, then the other leg falls asleep, and then after a while, we fall asleep. Why? It's comfortable, you know, but prayer, it's it's a job to pray to break through. Why? The devil knows, hey, if they can break through, I have lost the battle. And that's the way that people get gets away from the word of God. It becomes an hybrid affair. It must die. It cannot bring forth of its kind to life again. The church that will refuse to believe the word of God is a hybrid church with dogmas and creeds and doctrines that's not scriptural. That church cannot bring forth a spiritfilled child because it's hybrid. &gt;&gt; You know, as a minister, we have an obligation, a duty to bring only what God has already said. &gt;&gt; You know, when people are looking for something new, there's something wrong with you. I wonder what new he's going to bring. You know, like if you've heard all the message already, you're looking for something new. You know, go back and hear the tape that you heard again last week and you're going to find something new that you missed. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know when when my father passed away, I started playing these tapes on Sunday morning at 9:00 and my mom would say, "Miho, I am so embarrassed. I was there." I don't remember your dad saying that. And that was a pastor's wife. Why? Because as humans, we get, you know, distracted and we don't hear things. &gt;&gt; But you go back and hear that same type again, you're going to get another blessings church. The church cannot bring forth a spiritfilled child because it's hybrid. It's no good. It might be bigger, great big walls and fine pews, big bowels, you know, and plush seeds. But that doesn't mean one thing. It's spiritually dead. That's right. It cannot bring forth spiritfilled children because it's dead itself. &gt;&gt; Take the message this morning and take away the spirit, the anointing that was there. And what was it? it would just be a talk to us. &gt;&gt; But when you got the spirit quickening in his word, brother, it's live to you. It's telling you, hey, this is not hybrid. This is my word, church, &gt;&gt; and it's for you. &gt;&gt; He relates his testimony. Abraham says in the message the end time sign seed he says here some time ago I was out west and I was standing in a man's house that invited me out for dinner and he said Mr. Bannam I see you admiring that sculpture that painting or not painting but it was kind of cart out of wood uh plaque like or over the fireplace. I said yes sir I am. And he it was an old ox cart or covered wagon with oxes, a a man in front, a little boy sitting on the seat with his mother and they were traveling and he said that was my father and mother and the little boy on the seat was myself. He said we come here in an ox cart. He said but since then we have so prospered. He said I want you to step out here in the yard. He said I I forget how many thousands of acres that he owned there on a ranch. He said I brought brought I bought that in my young days. And he said then after that the adjoining ranch on to the west I own the adjoining ranch to the south I own. He said you see the smoke over there. He goes yes sir said that's a city I forget how many property he owned in that city there. He said, "I'm the president in that bank there telling me what all he had and I listened for a while." And I said, "I would like to ask you one question, &gt;&gt; sir. You have pointed to the east, to the west, showing the ranches and to the the city. I would like to have you look up this way and see and tell me how much you own up there." That's the main thing &gt;&gt; because someday you're going to leave every bit of this down here and then where do you go from there? That's the main thing. &gt;&gt; This is a a short stay here, church. &gt;&gt; We're here for a little time. You know, we're we're you know, life goes by so quickly. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. &gt;&gt; Goes by fast. You know, when we were young, we couldn't wait to get older, you know, more mature. Now that we're old, we can't wait to get young again. &gt;&gt; Why? because we're we're dying. Church, the natural man is dying. But but that's all right. Don't let the spiritual man die. &gt;&gt; You keep feeding him with the word of God. You keep you keep filling that that soul with the word that is eternal. That seed that that plants seeds of joy, of happiness, of eternal life, but that's an eternal state, he says. So I think we ought to consider where we are going for eternity. if we can so supply and fix our families and so forth here on earth with homes and houses and comfort that education that's the things we should do but the one of the main things we should do we leave undone till we get to the end of the road and drown ourselves in in eternity knowing nothing about God &gt;&gt; about his plan of salvation and redeeming grace of Jesus Christ. It's pitiful that we do, but we do. You know, to me, I I think that the the one of the most inspired words of this hour is this message of this hour, church. &gt;&gt; And to me, you know, when when you hear the prophet preach, he he's preaching from his from his heart, from his soul, trying to reach a people to give them something that will be eternal in their lives &gt;&gt; and a seed that that will grow in you. You know, I heard the prophet say the other day, you know, I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to bring forth the word that that God has given me to present to you that you might grow in grace and grow in love one another that you might have something in you that others will desire to have as well. &gt;&gt; The thumb will say, "Brother, I just love being around you. There's something about you. There's an anointing. There's a spirit around you that I want to be with you for eternity. I was thinking of Jesus Christ when he had gone whipped 39 times. He'd been whipped. All that he had suffered, you know, all that he went through, he should have been dead by now. &gt;&gt; All that burden, all that blood he had lost should have been dead by now. The suffering, the burden, just the pressure of life and having to carry his own cross to his own death. And I thought that when they put him on the cross, you know, he he he uh they put nails in him, they added more infliction upon what he was already carrying. And I thought only God's son could endure such punishment, such such pain. But then I got to thinking, he couldn't die yet. He hadn't reached the last soul yet. There was still one soul that had to come in. &gt;&gt; It was a dark, cloudy day. Satan and his angel had gathered together to see this Jesus crucified. It was a dark cloud, a dark thick moment. It was it looked like a time of depression that the son of God was about to be crucified and all of Satan's angels had showed up at Calvary &gt;&gt; to see him get crucified. &gt;&gt; But Jesus couldn't die because he had one more soul to reach. &gt;&gt; His job wasn't done yet. And I think today he hasn't come for his bride because there's still one more soul left &gt;&gt; that needs to be reached. &gt;&gt; And I was thinking about that that that thief on the cross, you know, when when when he came he he came in a borrowed vessel. He he had to be born in Mary. He he was he was born in a borrowed uh manger. When when he died, he had a borrowed tomb to be buried. And then when he gets ready to get crucified, he's hung between two thieves. And in some parts of the scripture, it says that they both rallled upon him. And I was thinking about one there on the right that maybe when he was growing up, his his mama told him, "Son, one day God is going to send a king, a savior for his people, and he'll be a king to to to us and he'll restore our kingdom." And maybe that that young man as he was growing up he he heard the message but you know somewhere in life maybe he got away from God got successful. You know sometimes we think that being successful is a sign from God and we think that you know I got to work more. I can't be in church because I have to work. When you put anything before God &gt;&gt; you're creating a God church. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And this young man through life he maybe he got away so away from God that he became a criminal. one of the best criminals. My dad used to say, "Man, if you're going to be something good, be the best at it. You're going to be the janitor, be the best janitor. If you're going to be the best musician, be the best, but do it from your heart for the Lord and give him your all. You're going to be a worshipper, be the best worshipper." And this young man, he he's there on the cross. And then another scripture says that when he when he's seen the other one rallying him against him, he said, "Hey, what's wrong with you? Why do you think we're here? We deserve to be here. &gt;&gt; Look, look at our lives, the choices that that we made, it led us to be crucified as well. We deserve what we getting. &gt;&gt; But this man, he's innocent. He's done nothing. And I was thinking maybe that when they nailed the sign in his car that said king of the Jews, maybe that thief, remember what his mama had said, one day guy is going to send a king to his people and he'll be their savior. And when he sees that sign, maybe he says, "This is the one." And he looks to him and he says, "Remember me when you come into your kingdom." And Jesus says, "This day you will be with me in my kingdom." &gt;&gt; He had reached his last soul. &gt;&gt; And when he did, he went home, church. &gt;&gt; We're we're still here for a reason. You know, the rapture should have taken place a long time ago. &gt;&gt; After all that, we've been preaching all these years, all these quotes. You know, it should have happened a long time ago, church. But it seemed that as the time to get more extended, the churches get more emptier. people get more colder, find more reasons to to not go to church, you know, and they don't like the way the pastor preach, you know, or agree to him in the line and all that. And after a while, they get so cold. And after a while, you know, the pastor is struggling with the peoples. Now, I'm not saying here, don't don't misjudge me. I'm just saying in general, it's a battle church. &gt;&gt; It's a battle. But we have the assurance God promised he was going to have a bride in this last hour. &gt;&gt; When the last message is preached, when the last soul is preached, church, God is coming for his bride. &gt;&gt; He sent us a prophet with a glorious message. &gt;&gt; Glorious message, church. You know, and when you the more you hear it, the more you ought to fall in love with Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; The more you should be inspired, you know, because you'll find yourself in that message that was meant for you, church. You You can go to any church you want, big mega churches, you know, and they they spend half of the time singing and lights flashing. When it comes time to preaching, it's a real simple message, but this message was preached to to prepare a people. &gt;&gt; We we we should be the most educated, spiritual people upon the face of the earth because we've been given a glorious message, church. a glorious message. &gt;&gt; How many love the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we are living in a time where we have a a weak generation but a very smart generation. &gt;&gt; You know our kids today they they come up with some phrases like where did they get that phrase from? When I was young I never said stuff like that. And one day my grandson walked into the house. We're having a celebration. Three years old and he walks in. He goes, "What's going on here?" We're like, "None of your business, boy." You know, language of of he he says things, you know, and he holds you accountable for things, you know. You know, I made a promise to my grandson, you know, and I told him I I'll fulfill my promise if you do such and such. Well, he didn't do such and such, so he didn't get the promise. You know what he told me? But grandpa, you promised me. I go, "Yes, I did, but you didn't do your part." And when we don't do our part, God can't fulfill his promise if we're not in our part, church. &gt;&gt; Now, in order in redeeming sickness, in order in redeeming, Barraham says, "Now, in order in redeeming sickness, we'll have to apply sickness as a result of sin." Sin sickness is not something your you your sin direct, but the sickness that you have is indirect. Maybe you inherit it from sick from sins of your parents or your forefathers. Each generation gets weaker and wiser because we inherit the differences and the sickness and the diseases of the body as it keeps handing down from generation. One one man was made and he lived almost a thousand years. Next one he come down it shortened his days keep shortening his days and on down to an average life now is around about 40 to 45 years old I suppose see we keep getting weaker all the time but wiser all the time just to fulfill what God's word said was going to happen in this last days church &gt;&gt; now God does not change God cannot grow in wisdom we heard this morning the first words that he says must be the last words because he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And we are so blessed in this hour that we have access to God's message, to his throne at any hour of the day. You're struggling in life, come to the Lord. &gt;&gt; You need something from him, come to the Lord. Seek him. You You feel tired and weary and depressed, hear a message. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the best answer is listen to a message. But the battle is have actually going to push the button &gt;&gt; because the devil tells you, "No, don't because your fingers hurting. Don't push the button. Just just just think about something else." But the minute you push that button, you hear the voice of the prophet, brother, you begin to be blessed &gt;&gt; because God sent a prophet &gt;&gt; with the message &gt;&gt; to bless us, church. &gt;&gt; God, help us to wake up. May we come to a place that we are so on fire for the Lord that we can't wait to get to church. &gt;&gt; How many of you are waiting to be in church on Wednesday? &gt;&gt; Brother, we ain't even there yet, brothers. Give me a break to rest two days. No, we should be on fire for the Lord church &gt;&gt; every day seeking him. &gt;&gt; The more you talk to the Lord, the more spiritual you become &gt;&gt; and you start walking in a higher level &gt;&gt; of spirituality. After a while, you don't see the things of the world. You just see Jesus. Like when brother Brand was at that cafe and they had that worldly music playing in the background, Babe Paul tells his dad, "Dad, isn't that a beautiful song?" And brother Bram says, "What song?" The one that's playing on the jukebox. He goes, "I can't hear it." He goes, "Dad, you are so in tune with Jesus that you don't hear nothing else." And I thought, "Oh, if we could get to that place &gt;&gt; that all we see is Jesus, nothing matters in life. If I didn't get the promotion, who cares? I still got Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; If I can't find you home, who cares? I still have Jesus. God, help us to want more of Jesus &gt;&gt; because we need him now more than ever. Amen. God bless you this evening. Amen. Keep pressing on, church. You know, I can't promise you that it's going to get better. It's probably going to get worse. That sound like really depressing news. It's going to get more worse. You know, you're supposed to be encouraging. I am encouraging you &gt;&gt; to get closer to God &gt;&gt; because we're going to need it, church. &gt;&gt; You know, the little trials come and we get so discouraged with little trials. What's going to happen when a real trial comes? &gt;&gt; We have to be grounded, church. &gt;&gt; And what do we have to be grounded to? His word that we've been hearing for years. &gt;&gt; Our feet have got to be planted in God's word. &gt;&gt; He has to be living in us, not around us. &gt;&gt; You know, I I love feeling the anointing. It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; But that anointing has got to be in me, &gt;&gt; not just around us. Amen. And when you hear the word of God and it it ignites you, makes you want to say, "Wow, I I want to keep pressing on." &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Beautiful to hear the word of God. Amen. God help us this evening. God help you in your journey in life. May God bless this church as you move forward. Uh I know there's still more souls to to bring in here in Tucson. &gt;&gt; Amen. You got loved ones that are not serving the Lord. Uh for God there's nothing impossible. Claim them in the name of Jesus. Amen. God will bring them in. How? That's not my job. I just got to claim them. Got to believe it. &gt;&gt; You know, he loves them. Bring him in. Amen. God help us to show more love and to be more like him. I like, you know, brother Batman had gone to the point where people thought he was Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why? It's life. It's not that he had a beard and he had, you know, a palm print or with nail prints. No, his life, his spirit reflected that of Christ. Paul said it is no longer me living, but it's Christ living in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God, help us to be &gt;&gt; like Christ living in us. Like Paul, brother Brandham, like Christ can live in us and we can grow stronger. Amen. Let us stand to our feet. God bless you this evening. Pray one for the another. How many of you love one another? &gt;&gt; Okay, let me ask you again. How many of you love one another? &gt;&gt; Even in our perfections, we have to learn to love one another. Amen. As God loved us in our imperfections, we have to learn to love one another as well. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing outside of love can enter in to the kingdom of God. We need more of him. Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for this day you've given us to have spent and Lord honoring the day of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; What a beautiful place to have spent in your house of worship Lord and with the freedom of spirit to to worship and to praise you Lord and to rejoice with your word and to be reminded even though we've heard it before that this is your word Lord. Father, we just ask for your guidance. Father, speak to our hearts when we find ourselves, Lord, uh troubled, weary, maybe sad, maybe backsliden. Father, may we have the knowledge or the wisdom to understand that we can still call upon you, Lord, and we can say, "Father, I'm struggling right now. I'm going through trials, Lord, of I can't seem to get the victory, but I know your victory, Lord. I know you already paid the price, Father. I was on your mind in the beginning, Father. And I know you say in your word that everyone that the Father has given you, you have not lost one. &gt;&gt; And I'm believing, Lord, that I'm one of those that have been written, engraved in the palm of your hands, Father, and in my in simplicity, Lord, my my humbleness, Father, I come before you with nothing to offer you but my broken heart, Lord. Father, take it and shape it and mold me and use me. Father, give me joy, Father. Let me wake up in the morning, Lord, and to be reminded by nature that because the sun rises, you have risen also, Father, that there's life in you. That beyond the river, there's a life that awaits us, Father. We want to be like you, Father. We want to live for you, Lord, and be as close as we can, Father. Forgive our sins, Lord, our trespasses, our imperfections, our sinful ways, Lord. sometimes our slothful ways. Forgive us, Father. And Lord, just cover us by the precious blood of Jesus. Lord, we stand before you, Father. We ask all these things for this church, Lord, your loved ones, the bride across this world. We present him in your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Jesus [Music] for the grace that you have given us. Though I can't repay from my heart, I'd like to say that I [Music] I thank you.

I just want to share something with you. kept coming through my my mind during the service and it was something that just the freedom that we wanted. We just sang about that. There's freedom in his presence. There's joy in his presence. But we look out. We're singing about chains that had us bound, &gt;&gt; but we're not singing it with our heart. And we're still we're still singing like we're bound. We're still singing like we don't have that joy unspeakable. And I was just I was thinking of at our wedding when Joy and I got married, we we sang a duet and it was something that I just stressed about. I couldn't get the harmony part and I was like, why did I why did I agree to do this? So night before the wedding was practicing the part instead of thinking about our life together. And then the wedding day comes and I was thinking about this. I'm I I just don't want to blow this. It's my wedding day and I don't want to get up and blow this. So looking at the video afterwards, I I felt it, but you could see once the song was done. It was just like this burden was lifted and I could just relax and and the rest of the time it was wonderful and what I was looking forward to on our on our wedding and but I just think sometimes we have got that burden that's on us. But we started the service tonight singing that song. He is our peace. Cast all your cares on him. &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't need to sing this special. I'll do it for you. &gt;&gt; You don't need to fight this fight. I'll fight it for you. &gt;&gt; You don't need to carry that load. I'll carry it for you." Maybe we just go back and sing that song we opened with tonight. He's our peace. He's broken down every wall. &gt;&gt; And cast all your cares on him. There's nothing like the presence of the Lord. He's here tonight. I mean, just let it let go. Let Jesus this evening, he is our peace [Music] who has broken down every wall. Lord, you're my peace. You are my peace. Thank you, Jesus. You are my peace. Peace. You are my peace. You have broken down every wall. [Music] You are my peace. Lord, you are my peace. Cast your cares on him tonight. Oh, just cast all your cares on him.

We don't see them, but we need the Lord Jesus. And um and he's the one who cares for our children. Amen. He cares for our families. There's a lot of there was I just heard a not a testimony, a story just yesterday of this family that lost their little one that had gone away, was missing, and they found him. He had drowned in the neighbor's pool there. just think of a family to lose a family member like that. And so we know it's not our strength and our wisdom that watches over our children. It's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say, Lord, please don't take your hand off of my life, over my children's life, over our ministry, whatever we think we're secure. &gt;&gt; Lord, please &gt;&gt; don't take your hand off of me. &gt;&gt; We need that. So we'll just pray for don't we love our one another? We love our children. We just ask God to bless them. Brother Mark, why don't you &gt;&gt; let us bow our heads? Heavenly Father, I always remember the scripture when you were preaching and the children wanted to see you and they came to you but the disciples pushed them back. &gt;&gt; Lord, it displeased you and you said suffer the little ones to come unto me &gt;&gt; because the kingdom is theirs too, Father. And Lord, in this hour, there is a bride that you are preparing, Lord, &gt;&gt; with your word, Father. And the bride has children, Lord, that we we've got to send them to school in such a perverse hour, Lord. But, Father, we're not trusting in the system. We're trusting in you, Father. And we're taking them, Lord. We're saying, Father, you've given them to us, but now we're giving them back to you in the name of Jesus. Father, when they wake up in the morning to go to school, may they feel their angel, the anointing that goes with them, Father. other when they're in school and they would want to do something wrong, may the angel remind them, you are a child of God. &gt;&gt; I've been sent to watch you, to watch and protect you, Lord. Give them grace, Father, in their classes, Lord. Give them wisdom, Father. Give them a testimony that other children can see that they are different, Lord. And they are different, Father, because they're not from this world, Lord. Bless the parents. Give them grace, wisdom, trust, Lord, to trust in you, Father. We've committed our children into your hands, Lord. Watch over them and protect them, Father, in the precious name of Jesus. Lord, we ask all these things. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. God be with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm pressing on the upward way. New heights I'm gaining. I'm gaining every day. [Music] Praying as I hold ground.
