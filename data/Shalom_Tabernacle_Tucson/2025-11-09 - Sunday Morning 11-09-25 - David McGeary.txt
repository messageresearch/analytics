Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Amen. Good morning, saints. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; How many is happy to be here today? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Everyone looks so nice. look like you come expecting [music] to hear from the word of the Lord. Amen. Normally our Sunday morning [music] service, we have an adult Sunday school. Um, and that's about 15 minutes and we usually play a series of the prophet. [music] And this morning with the special meetings, we've just going to move that Sunday school to right [music] now. And there's a few quotations that I wanted to play for you um in line up with our theme, the sons and daughters of God. Amen. So, I trust it'll be a blessing to you. It's on my t on my phone here. It's kind of old school the way I'm going to do this. And so, you won't be able to look at the screen, but but you can hear the voice. All right. How many love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing a portion of only believe as we [music] Oh, believe on [singing] [music] that all things are possible only. [singing] Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. All [music] living. God bless you. What a miserable thing that poor bird is. For he was built, made to be a heaven flying bird. And you're trapped for the rest of his life in a little cave. and to know that he could look and see the things that and the places where he longed [screaming] to be but he could not get out of this cave. I thought what a miserable [screaming] thirsty or bird he must be. I thought that's about one of the most saddest sightes I ever seen. But then as turning [screaming] around I see the sadder side that is the [screaming] sons of Adam who were made to be the sons of God [screaming] beating their brains out [groaning] trying to find treasures to satisfy in this life and knowing that they were born to be sons of the living And they just simply beat themselves to death. Running here and running there and shooting each other and gambling and stealing and robbing from one another when they're really born to these sons of God. That's the saddest part I ever seen is man imprisoned [screaming] by sin. But there's one thing about it. There could be such a thing as some kind of hearted person. [screaming] Let that eagle out of it. And I'm so happy to say to the sons of Adam this afternoon that there has been a kind-hearted person coming to the sons of Adam, the Lord Jesus, who will let everyone go free that wants to go. It's up to you. Christian people who read the Bible when that child become a certain age and if he was a if he was a bad boy now he never could be denied being a son no also because he was born I'm just a little enough Calvinist to believe that that when a man is born a son of God he's the son of God that's right and God putting savior here knowing he's going to lose you now you might be worked up and think you're saved here that might be true but let me tell you something when you're really saved God don't save you here and know he's going to lose you there. If he did, he's not the infant God. He's defeating his own purpose. You can't do that. If you're saved, you're saved. If you're not, you're not. IF YOU'RE SAVED, YOU LIVE LIKE YOU'RE SAVED. &gt;&gt; I don't act quit drinking, quit smoking, quit gambling because I know it's wrong. There's something in me. God loves me so much and I love God, so I wouldn't do it anyhow. Not a law, but a love. It isn't law that SAVES US. IT'S LOVE THAT SAVES US. God so loved the world. It isn't evidence. It's the signs that saved us. It's love that saved us. Certainly. Now notice this father. He was so happy of his son. Then when that son became of age, that father took him out into the street into a public place. And notice the father put a royal robe on him. And he set that son up before the public and he had a ceremony and he adopted that same son that was born in his house into his family. Did you know that? Read the old test. Take Ephesians first chapter 5th verse and run your reference on that simply. Don't go back to your adoption and placing a son. God is predestinated to be the sons of God by Jesus Christ. predestinated us unto the adoption predestinated our fornowledge by adopting us into the sons of God. Now when it become a son when he was adopted into the same family he was born in. Now listen Presbyterian friend Methodist and Baptist and Pentecostal when you're born again that only puts you in the family. It's your character, your conduct that gives God confidence in you. The reason that we haven't got the great church marching on today is because God can't find people THAT PUT HIS CONFIDENCE IN. The Holy Spirit keeps saying they're tearing UP. THEY'RE BREAKING UP. THEY'RE DOING THIS. They're all on the lines. Stay with God's word. That's God's truth. That's the pattern. That's the blueprint. That's the reason the church today's got all kinds of isms and everything in it is because they DON'T STAY WITH THE WORD. THEY WON'T LISTEN TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. The Holy Spirit won't testify of one other thing but God's word. It's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Creation, the creation is waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. What's everything waiting on? &gt;&gt; What's the whole creation waiting for? the manifestations of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the church to become into its position. &gt;&gt; Who was the son of God when Adam where was his domain? The earth. &gt;&gt; He he had domain over earth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; He wasn't ly Elohim man. He was Jehovah. See that is I am God and I've made some lesser ones under me and I'll give them a dominion &gt;&gt; and in their domain the dominion under them is the earth. Man had dominion over the earth and all the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're watching for the coming of that glad millennium day &gt;&gt; when our blessed Lord Come and catch his waiting right away. Oh, the earth is groaning, crying for that day of sweet release when our savior shall come back to earth again. &gt;&gt; Waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself. Getting one that he can work through like this. Say, "There's my spirit flowing freely. There it is. I I can work here. Get another one over here and place him. I can place him." Adoption. place him, manifest him, take him out of here and put a ceremony on him, visit him with an angel, tell him something. If he's told the truth, now if he's just making up something, it won't work. &gt;&gt; No, no, that won't work. We've had a lot of that. But I mean, but I mean, manifestations of sons of God, when God manifests himself and he sends him out and then he goes forth and what he says is truth. &gt;&gt; What he does is the truth. What he does, he manifests Christ. He said he made known to us the mystery. Get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes. This afternoon I had oh about 30 minutes to study just to look the lesson over. Maybe not I I'll say half of that 15 minutes between the times. And I got to running and I thought the mystery, how mysterious. And the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament. Then back over into the New Testament, tied something together. See the mystery of his coming, the mystery of his will, the mystery of the setting together. Remember, it cannot be taught in any seminary. It's a mystery. &gt;&gt; You cannot know it by education, by theology. It's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. Tell me, my brother, tell me, my sister, when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time? Now &gt;&gt; when was there ever a time in the history there's a manifest a time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations &gt;&gt; it had to wait till this time &gt;&gt; now All things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ will join him and his church together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; TO BE WHAT? WHAT INHERITANCE? The sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. TO BE A SON OF GOD. &gt;&gt; And now this may just choke you to death, &gt;&gt; but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? &gt;&gt; How many ever know that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many knows that Jesus said so? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible Jesus said, "Did not your law say itself that you are gods? And if you call them gods, which God said in Genesis 2, that they were gods because they were aired full domain over the dominion of the world. He gave him dominion over all things and he lost his godship. &gt;&gt; He lost his sunship. He lost his domain. And Satan took it over. Amen. &gt;&gt; THE &gt;&gt; WE'RE waiting for the manifestations &gt;&gt; of the sons OF GOD TO COME BACK AND take over again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the fullness of time WHEN THE PY GETS UP to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested. &gt;&gt; When the power of God will walk out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will take over POWER THAT SATAN'S GOT AWAY FROM ME. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Belongs to me &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; And as we overcome by the Holy Spirit like he had, we will set with him as he takes the earthly throne of David to sit and rule with him just like he did up there. Amen. Power and authority over all the earth. The earth is groaning, waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God to be manifested, God's son. Because as earth, this world was not given for God to control. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; WHO IS THE GOD OF THE EARTH? MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's his domain. All everything in the earth is subject to the man. Through sin, he fell. Through Christ redeeming power, he comes back again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because the earth belongs to man. It was given to him and he was ruler over everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all nature's groaning, waiting for that time that when the sons of God will be manifested again, &gt;&gt; manifestations for the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to leave that right now. But &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] And everyone can say amen. Uh God bless you. Amen. [applause] Amen. God bless you this morning. Let's all stand. Lord, I lift your name [singing and music] on high.

All my sins are washed [singing] away. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; No one knew how alone [singing and music] I was feeling. for the emptiness [singing] I tried so hard [music] to hide. Though [singing] I laughed and said [music] my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears I [singing and music] cried. Then one day someone told me of [singing] your mercy. and the love you showed on [singing] a hill called Calary. [music] There you purchase [singing] my redemption [music] when you broke sin's power and [singing] set [music] my spirit free. &gt;&gt; I'm [singing] amazed [music] that you love me.

If the brothers will come this morning. [applause] &gt;&gt; And after this, we'll have the adult choir if you want to go ahead and start making ready as well. Good morning. It's sure good to be in church with each one of you this morning. Are you hungry? Are you ready to be fed? &gt;&gt; Amen. You're going to be feasting during this service and then after and then [music] a little later another service and some more food. So, we just hope that you came ready and willing to eat. And brother Brandham taught us now if you see a or hit a seed, just keep feasting. You don't necessarily have to eat that seed, but you maybe swallow it or make sure it's a seed. All right. God bless you. Sure been good to be in service with you. Dear saints, a request from Sister Tila, as I continue to undergo treatment on my back injury. The pain is unbearable. I'm unable to stand sit up for a long time has caused me to be missing church services. And we miss our sister Tila. So let's hold her up in prayer. The Lord will deliver her in his good time. From brother Jonathan Gonzalez [music] here. God bless you, brother and sisters. I would like to pray for brother Lazy, our elder in the back corner. We love him very much. May God touch his body. And we certainly want to remember our pastor. Thank you for the reminders, brother Jonathan, the pastor, their family, and each of the ministers are traveling, all that's done for the glory of the living God this morning. Amen. And as God's children, he wants to do more than we probably [music] know or want or desire. So just hold that need before him and faith believing. Won't you lift up a hand for that loved one, for that financial, spiritual, physical, whatever it is. Dear God, we're so thankful to be in church again this morning. We just lift up a sacrifice of praise. We appreciate the leadership, Lord, Brother Israel. Just desiring more souls to be one and the leadership, Lord, the board, and the song leaders, Brother John, Brother Craig, Brother Scott, Lord, anoint them, and the ministry, Lord. We we know there'll be a man up here, but we know you'll be speaking to us, Lord. And so, want to be receptive, Father, and just humble hearts to hear what you'd have in store for us this morning. We love brother McGary, Lord, and his family, Sister Leslie here, and we just tried to stuff everybody [music] in every corner that we possibly could do. And so, just help us. May we be comfortable, Lord, as we hear the word and just hear from heaven. We bring a just a meager tithes and offerings, Lord, knowing that you'll magnify it and bring that last soul in because we know your coming is real soon, real soon. And we want to be ready. Dear God, we commit all things to your mighty hands in the name of the wonderful Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] And all the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And also, just a quick update, I got a text from [music] my stepmother this morning, the little baby Grady. They're moving him out of the ICU down to a regular floor. So, she just wanted to thank the Lord for all the prayers that have been going up for him. So, we just say, "Thank you, Lord." Oh, amen. We'll sing that.

We're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you happy to be here? &gt;&gt; We're happy that you're here to join us as well. and we wanted to thank you for the sacrifices and the efforts you made to be here with us. Amen. And so um we have come to this portion of the service of the just before we go to the preaching of the word, we wanted to share just uh testimony on how we got the building and maybe show a slideshow uh from the beginnings to where we are at this moment. 2025, we really counter the privilege that the Lord Jesus has given us the opportunity to serve him in the little way that we can. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I get a smile from everybody? Let me see your &gt;&gt; Let me see your teeth. God bless you, richly. God bless you richly. I was so uh overjoyed. I saw in the back there our good friend from uh Bogota, Colombia. Brother Fabio Bernal is here with his dear wife. I want them to stand up. They came. It surprised me. Yes. God bless you. [applause] Y Mandiga. Amen. He had his 50y year anniversary just earlier this year and it was our first time to go Sharon and I to Colombia. You didn't know he was coming? Yeah, I didn't either. and I was so surprised to see him. What an honor to have him here with us. Amen. And uh so um just a little history back in 2016, June of 2016, I was on my way to church. Um, I lived in Savarita at the time and the Lord had it spoke to my heart that um that that would be my the last service that I would have uh where I was fellowshipping at the assembly there with uh with brother Doug Mccuse. He was my pastor for 14 plus years. And he did a fine job standing for the word of God. And it was an honor and a privilege to to work with him to sit under his ministry here. And the Lord spoke to my heart there um on my way to church. And so I um didn't know exactly what we would do. So we went to the Hotel Tucant. It was you formerly the Ramada Inn and we um had rented out a little room there and a few saints joined us in that um meeting spot. Um they rented us the room Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon and we rented on on Wednesday. And so uh we did that from June until November, October or November. And the Lord blessed us to go into a little it was a formerly a bank and then it turned into a church that they had us to come in. And that's th those are the beginning of the slideshow that you'll see of when we were in this bank. It had a safe in it and it was how many's been to the old church. He had that big old safe. It it looked nice with a curtain and everybody would ask what's behind that curtain. It was a big vault. We couldn't do anything with the doors were this thick. Couldn't do anything with it. And so we would use that for storage and marriage counseling. No, no, no. But it was big thick building, big storage building there. And so we um you know while we were there we you know we had the cars broken into a couple times and um we had our air conditioning stolen um once but the Lord upgraded that and gave us a better system. So, you kind of get mad at the thief, but then you say, "Well, thank the Lord for the thief because the school we were renting from the TUSD, they allowed us to purchase an AC units that we actually needed and they didn't charge us for it." &gt;&gt; And so, I did not complain. I purposefully did not complain uh while we were on Broadway uh because I know it was a blessing for us to be there and uh I didn't know how much of a blessing it was until it was time for us to move after 8 years of being there. 8 and 1/2 years at that location. Yeah, it'll be 10 now. Eight and a half, nine years. our lease had we were warned that our lease that they were going to sell that building and demolish it and we had um 6 months um that we needed to to vacate. They would just renew it every year. They raised our rent one time. That was the first year. After that, they never bothered us. Our our rent was very very low. And um so we continued to do that and until we were on this deadline of time crunch. So the year had ticked away and then we got to the six month mark where we had to find another building and uh no one knows the stress that's associated with that. trying to find a location that everybody will be happy, that'll be safe, that's affordable, that's that's in an appropriate place. And so I really, it bothered me. It stressed me out quite a bit. I was praying about it uh quite a bit. And we had uh November services every year. We would have those special meetings. And so last year or 2024 or March, brother Robert Figueroa had invited me to come with him to some meetings down in Warz. Brother Tito um I forget his last name. Perez no T Perez. Tito Perez. Yes. invited us uh to be a part of his meetings and I've gotten invitations many times you know in Ngalas in different parts of Mexico and so forth and I used to go and I just kind of had stopped going for whatever reason and this invitation came through Robert Figureroa and he kept asking me and I didn't get back to him then finally he told me brother Israel if you don't go I'm not going because I'm not going to drive down by myself so I said okay I'll And so me and brother Robert um we got together. We drove down to Wararez, 5 hours down Friday afternoon, we got in a bit late. We crossed the border into Mexico Friday night. Get into the service and brother um Guadalupe Lopez is preaching. No interpreter. I'm sitting there in Mexico. I can't speak a lick of Spanish, just a little bit. I can understand, but I just can understand. So, I prayed in my heart. I says, "Lord, open my understanding so I can understand what they're preaching." And I wanted this great miracle to happen. And then two minutes later, a brother tapped me on the shoulder says, "Do you need an interpreter?" And so, [laughter] so I said, "Yes, I do." And he began to interpret for me. And I was sitting in that meeting just looking at the people worship and the Lord uh began to deal with my mind and my heart about missionary work and how I needed to be giving more in the missionary work more actively starting with my brothers right there in Mexico, our neighbors. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, Lord, we're the ones that need a building and you want me to give more?" Um, and so [snorts] before that trip, we had went on the market. We're looking, Brother John Yarl. Where's Brother John at? Stand up, brother John. He's a realtor. And we went through uh looking through the market, looking at properties and so forth. And I think it's sister uh um Smith, Sister Carlina, saw this property. and her and my wife and different ones are always looking and they shot this out to us. And then so me and brother um brother John came and saw this building during the week and to be honest I wasn't really really thrilled when I first saw the property and everything and um but it it was you know we didn't have we had to leave and so we looked and it was on the pro it was on the market for $900,000. this, the house, the whole property, acre plus. And so we looked at that and and John and I went to church on Wednesday and then notified had a a business meeting with the some of the saints after the service and was thinking of crafting an offer for $800,000 and just to tie the building up, ask for more time and so forth. So we discussed that and so that was the Wednesday. Then the Thursday passed the church came to see it and then Friday is when I went to Warz. That's when the Lord spoke to my heart that uh we need to be giving more. I said yes Lord that's what we'll do. We come back across the border on our way to Tucson and I get an email from the school telling us that we had an additional six months. So the Lord gave us a little bit more time. &gt;&gt; So I said, "Thank you, Lord. We have a little more time. The pressure is off a little bit." And so we came back and while looking we realized the rents that we was paying was probably a third of what most any other property people were paying. And that's when I realized how much of a blessing it was where we were. So we had another year. We had six, seven months or or so to to to get uh a little bit more time. And so our meetings come up in November. So that was in March. We made our commitment to give more in the missionary field and works and so forth like that, mission works. And um our meetings come up in November and we had the the theme was divine love and um before the meetings um we started looking again because we had taken this property off of our mind because we had more time and we'll look for something better or look for something affordable. And so what we did was um we kept looking and then at the beginning of our meetings we looked and on the market this property was still there. So brother John approached them again and saw what they were asking and what was going on. Well this time they came to us and said that we will carry you for $750,000. We'll carry you. You don't have to go to the bank have to get a loan and all that. So I said, 'W whoa, that's great. We'll take that, Brother Bill. We'll take that. So let's talk about it after our meeting's over. We go through our meetings. Uh Veterans Day weekend, I was out um having breakfast with brother brother John um Jesse Lynn's brother's last name's not coming to me. John Davis, Jonathan Davis. And um they con the owners of this property contacted brother John again after our meetings came to us and said you know the owners want to offer this to you all and maybe one other group and this is not going to be on the market but we will sell you this building and property for $450,000. Wow. [applause] &gt;&gt; Yes. [applause] &gt;&gt; So, the Lord cut that building price in half. &gt;&gt; Gave us a year to save up a little bit more. &gt;&gt; And then just Well, then you asked me if I like it now. [laughter] I said, "Yes, I think I like the property. Yes, I love it. you know, the Lord can cut whatever expense, whatever it is, he can cut it in half. He'll do it for you. So, it's just a tremendous miracle that we're here uh in this place, in this little location. We had a lot of renovations and stuff we had to do to get to this point. I want to thank the trustees um and the different teams that came together for the designing and the cleaning and the all of the stuff that we had to do. Uh we we had brother V he was uh uh coming through brother Kim Dingwall which was a friend of brother Randy Snow and they kind of got together and they just um the Lord really used them to help us in this uh in our building endeavors. Brother Ike La Fontaine came with the music helped us out the the local brothers here. I can't express enough all of the members and the families and even outside brothers from other assemblies would just show up looking to work and help us out here. &gt;&gt; A pastor that I didn't know very closely, a elder in the city of Phoenix called us just out of the blue and wanted to have lunch with me and my wife. And we did and the Lord placed it on his heart to give us a substantial offering just to give it to us just like that. Yes, [applause] that was [applause] that was brother Ron Peterson and his assembly there in Phoenix. And then we had anonymous donors that come through. Um, brother um, uh, Chris Dooall, he wanted to supply all the paint for the work. Joel Jensen, brother Yarborough, and all of the saints. Brother Caleb Duran, one of the sister pastors here. Uh, brother Carpenters family, the Carpenters from Mesa, big tremendous help to us. Brother Miguel Para, Chuck King, and um of course um the um the Smiths, Chris Smith, and the families, all the trustees and deacons, Brother Joel Robson and his dear wife, Sister Aaron. Just a tremendous tremendous uh Yes. [applause] And all of the families pulled together. I know I I'm not mentioning all of the names. I can't I could but we won't. But it's just been a real real blessing. And um you know it's not wasn't easy. Still not easy. And what you see today, many of the saints didn't even see the finished product up even last week. That house didn't even look like that. What they did over there, I was shocked and amazed. And so we're just we're thankful. We really are grateful. Amen. [applause] So we certainly appreciate our board um over the years. The two main deacons that have really been real uh pillars to me to help me as all of the brothers is brother Joe Robson and brother Art Salceo. and they're they've been uh standing with me very very uh faithfully. Amen. [applause] Um there's a small group that we started to go to minister to in Mesa which is connected to brother Carpenters's family but really is brother Art and his family. Brother Art, Sister Annabel, and his two daughters um drove down from Phoenix just about every service for five and a half years, including the week day, just solid solid believers. And then some things changed with their um jobs and so forth. And so we um they they wasn't able to travel and they would stream. And so the carpenters opened up their sanctuary just on Thursday. So it's just a little fellowship that we have um started to go to there to minister to them. Some of brother Art's family are through this tragedy and so forth are wanting Bible study. We had a Bible study with them and we love to see the Lord prosper that and let that grow as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, um, I'd like to go right into the slideshow. I didn't see it all. I saw part of it, but if if you'll be patient with us, and this is kind of from our beginnings to 2025. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. Thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Happy birthday to you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat.

It's in these things that we give God thanks. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to uh change the order of the service or continue in the order of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; and get go right into the word. And so if the musicians will find uh that um song Amazing Grace, our brother David McGary is [music] uh ministering for us this morning and um we so appreciate his [music] sacrifice to be here with us and we know that the Lord is going to bless us this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; With his word. And so let's stand to our feet as we invite him to [music] the platform this morning. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound as rich like me. [music] I was lost, [singing] but [music] now I am found. [music] I was fly, [singing] but now [music] I see. was grace [music] that [singing] my all to fear [music] and grace my [singing] fears. [music] How precious [music and singing] did that grace grace [music] appear. May the hour [music and singing] be when we've been there 10,000 years. Oh, when we [singing] been there 10,000 [singing and music] years, Christ shining, shining [singing] as [music] the sun. Hallelujah. [singing] no less days to sing [singing] God's praise. Then when [singing] we first began, [singing] let's lift our hands. Praise [music] God. Oh, praise God. [music and singing] Praise God. Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise God. [singing] Praise God. [music] Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise God. [music] Praise God. Praise God. Praise [music] God. [music] Let's just bow our heads. Our gracious father. Lord, as I [music] watch the slideshow, Father, my heart just leapt for joy and to see all that you've done. And Lord, how [music] precious these times are and how fleeting that time is. And Lord, we're approaching your soon coming. [music] And Lord, our whole heart's desire is that we be ready to meet the [music] challenge of that hour. We ask you to bless us this morning, Father, in the word that you've given us. That you so preserved all these years to be true and faithful. Lord, we [music] ask that the brokenhearted would be lifted this morning and that we could walk from this place [music] strengthened by your grace and your mercy. Father, forgive us our trespasses and let us love one another with an undying love. We ask [music] you to be with us this morning. In Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. [music] Hallelujah. You love the Lord this morning. Nice to be here this [music] morning. I haven't been in Tucson for almost 10 years and has been since the passing of my good friend, Brother Doug, and his wife, Sister Imma Jean. And &gt;&gt; but God's always got a perfect time for everything, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; That's the one thing that you can rest in. It's good to see my friends Bill and Marcy here. Brother Bill came out of California with me, I don't know, 50 plus years ago. Eli Kendall, each one of you were united together because of God's word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because of his love for us, and he knew we'd be here. And that's what we just want to help fortify us uh this morning. So, if you turn with me in your Bibles and and uh and turn with me to Mark the 13th chapter, I'm sorry. Let's start with Matthew the 13th chapter and the 11th verse and then we'll turn to Mark the fourth chapter and the 11th verse. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but unto them it is not given." That's right. &gt;&gt; For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly. But whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away, even that he hath. Amen. Let us also turn over to Mark and read the basically the same thought but Mark puts it in this context also and he says uh in uh Mark uh I think it's 4 and 11 he speaks these words. He and he said unto them, unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but unto them that are without. All these things are done in parables. Seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven a them. Our father, we ask you to bless your word to us. In your precious name we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may [snorts] be seated. I'll I'll try to move right along this morning. You know, this is my favorite setting right here. I like just uh a small group of people and and where you can see one another. I tell you, you don't know how precious it is when you start. I I I know what it's like to have a meeting and I know what it's like to build a building and I know what it's like to start in just a little teeny place. We when we started, we had to sweep up cigarettes the night before because they had the dance. And then we got we moved to a little church. Our first little church building was on a street called Broadway in Halam City. That's where brother George came to visit me for the first time. And then from there we moved to another place and another place and and all along the way it was labor of love. Each people putting in their labor and their time together. And that's what makes us a body. You know, we're not a religion. &gt;&gt; We're a people. &gt;&gt; You know, culture is taught. It's not inherited. &gt;&gt; That's right. You you learn because you're taught things. You're taught the way to think, the way to act, the way to perceive, where to go, where not to go. And and and so, but we have a culture. &gt;&gt; Our culture is the word of God. &gt;&gt; We're we're not we're not we're not a religious. We don't have something that we believe. We have something that we are. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; And I want to say that again. It's not something that we believe. It's something that we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and it it was planned that way by God. He he he we trust. He knows all things. Uh when he dealt with brother Israel, he knew this place would be here. And it wasn't only for you. It's for those maybe that we haven't met yet, &gt;&gt; we haven't seen yet. that that are hungering and thirsting after righteousness. &gt;&gt; And he he's made us different and he's done these things for a purpose and for a cause and and it's for his glory. &gt;&gt; You know, I just thought of uh coming here this morning, I thought when I first came into the message, you know, the only thing we knew was Malachi 4:5. &gt;&gt; It's all we knew. God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; I just knew God sent a prophet. You know, Malachi 4:5 and great and dreadful day of the Lord. &gt;&gt; God sent a prophet. He's Malachi 45. His name is William Brandom. &gt;&gt; I didn't even know what he taught. &gt;&gt; I didn't know what he taught. I didn't know what he believed. I just knew he was a prophet. &gt;&gt; And and that revelation opened the door for me to to hear what he had to say. And so, you know, we we didn't know anything. And and what did we do? All of a sudden, we found out what he taught. I found out about long hair, &gt;&gt; you know. And I I had to cut my hair. We found out about dress. We found out about clothing. The first few years I was in the message, I listened to tape, alls I heard was hair, pants, makeup. You You know what I mean? I don't care what tape I could have put on. I could have put on the seventh seal and that's all I heard. You You know what I mean? No music, no this, no that. You know, it was just I I don't know. God has a knows how to feed you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when to feed you. It's all stored up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it takes the spirit of God to take it out in season. You know, it was spiritual food for the due season. and and and that's all we knew, you know, and and uh and and then we moved on a little farther, you know, and and uh we we we found out about church order. I mean, alls I heard for the next two years was church order. be at church at 9:30, pay your tithes, pay your offerings, you know that you got to have pastors, you got to have someone over, you know, and and but if he said it, I believed it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, so I had moved in from ABC's found out about church order and then we moved in and found out about this opening of the seals &gt;&gt; and the the church hes you know and saw the history of the church coming down. Saw the horse riders sitting within the framework of the history of the church. Saw the seed going to the ground and and come up again. And and we saw all those things, things we didn't know, things I didn't. It was right in God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the time, you know, and but God knew his season. He he he was growing us. He was ripening us. He was he was drawing us through the filter of his word that all the impurities would go out of his life because he had something for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, he's got something for us. And and so, you know, and then we, you know, we we saw the seals. We we saw these things. I'm just talking about myself. &gt;&gt; You know, I didn't come into the message on Tuesday and know everything he said on Wednesday. &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? And I I'll be honest with you, there's still things that he says that I I don't know yet. &gt;&gt; I don't know everything that's in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, I feel there's more in there than what I know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'm hungry for it. &gt;&gt; I'm in anticipation for it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to set up camp. &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to believe that that he he'll feed me till the day he changes me. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; And you know, then we we Our eyes begin to open and we saw that it just wasn't a man there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A preacher, &gt;&gt; you understand? But that by the great wisdom of God, God had veiled himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now he was unveiling himself. And we begin to see and understand the ministry of the son of man. how that God came in the and if I could say that and veiled himself in a prophetic ministry &gt;&gt; and it it just wasn't him standing there as William Brandon but that the the the Lord himself had veiled himself in there &gt;&gt; and we saw that it was that that deity was amongst us &gt;&gt; though he was just such a yielded vessel And we could feel an anointing and a presence that that came when we listened, you know, &gt;&gt; to him. And there was nothing like when you start to listen and understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and as your revelation grew, the more you wanted to hear. &gt;&gt; And the more you understood the that it this wasn't an uneducated man. This was the divinely educated man. He he he didn't come from a university. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And and I I'll just say this and and sure that if corrected, but I believe he grew &gt;&gt; as God opened the word to him. I I believe he prayed for revelation just like he asked us to pray to revelation &gt;&gt; and and as and as our brother said as it was revealed to him he'd come back and reveal it to us &gt;&gt; and and so we grew and and so you know we we we understood the son of man and and then you know then it seemed like there was a great shift away to who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. All of a sudden, all the people were saying, "Who you are? Who you are? Who you are?" You know, that was we all wanted to know who we were, where that we fit. &gt;&gt; And and so I come to this place this morning and I I I say, "Well, what's our path forward?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so I I'm I told brother Israel, all what I really want to preach to you this morning is his congregation. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what I can do to help &gt;&gt; his congregation and your path forward &gt;&gt; because I want you to be successful &gt;&gt; and there's a way to be successful &gt;&gt; and the way to success is always in God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I have a little thought this morning if you'd bear with me. And I would like to call it the children of prophecy. &gt;&gt; You are the children of prophecy. And if I could say that that a a a prophecy is a message containing divine will and fornowledge of future events. That's what prophecy is. &gt;&gt; And prophecy has a child &gt;&gt; or it birthed something. If I could say it this way, the Lord said, "In the beginning was God and God created the heavens and the earth." And you go and read in the first uh first chapter, the third verse of the book of Genesis, he says, "Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; Now, let there be light was the prophecy. And then light was the child of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't do anything until he speaks it first. &gt;&gt; So he he said, "Let there be and and and there was light." And so that prophecy gave birth to light. &gt;&gt; You know, in the scripture, the scripture says, "A virgin shall conceive." And and Mary was the child of that prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That what what it was. She was the child of that prophecy. It was spoken. &gt;&gt; But if the the word of God never just remains spoken. It's always manifested because if it's not manifested, it's not interpreted. God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. So we he doesn't need interpretation. He said let there be light. The the and that was the what he prophesied. He said let there be light. That was spoken. That was the prophecy. The light was what was manifested and that became the interpretation of that. Now remember this morning we're talking about you being the children of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that virgin conceived and then the scripture said there will be he'll there will be one born unto us a a child and he shall be called counselor prince of peace mighty God. The scripture spoke the old testament spoke out it was what? Prophesying in sundried times and diverse manners. God spoke by his prophets and the word of God was spoken out &gt;&gt; and and that word would not return void. &gt;&gt; It had to produce a child. &gt;&gt; You understand? There had to be something that came into existence by the word that was spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Else not, it's intellect. &gt;&gt; It just sits back intellectual. it it has no reality &gt;&gt; to it. &gt;&gt; And and that's the one thing that we want. We don't want to worship history. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We we want to find him in his living reality in the moment that we're living and know that he's here. Oh yes. [screaming] &gt;&gt; So we we find out that there was so many prophecies spoken of him. He said, "Search the scriptures." &gt;&gt; In them, you think you have life. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So obviously they were searching the scriptures, but they weren't catching the life of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. because they weren't catching the child that the prophecy birth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They they didn't understand why it was spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just this message itself, it's got a reason it was spoken. &gt;&gt; It wasn't spoken so we could look back and say it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But it's spoken that we might understand that we're the children &gt;&gt; of what was spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're the children of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If I could just turn, our our brother spoke of of uh the uniting time and sign and I it just moved me so much to uh uh the word of God that was uh uh spoken in uh let me see if I I brought my message with me. I might have left it on the desk in there. Um, would you go see and and and see if I have that my the book in there? It's it's my book. I I'm I don't use computers. [laughter] You you you you have to understand uh that the only reason that I'm here is because I'm old. Uh that that was uh uh well, it it could be right up here on the platform with me and me not find it. So, let me see. Oh, I found it, brother. I told you [laughter] I'm old. So, there we go. And you know, and uh so that's why I'm here. So I don't use computers. I I still use books &gt;&gt; and uh because I you know, I read a a statement where brother Bram said he said I hope you get it. He said read and listen. &gt;&gt; Read and listen. So I think that's a great point. But the I want to just take us just for a moment if you would bear with me because you are the children &gt;&gt; of prophecy &gt;&gt; that that if if if I if this could sink in this morning &gt;&gt; for you here at Shalom Tabernacle that you could understand that that is the whole reason that you're here &gt;&gt; is to fulfill what he's spoken &gt;&gt; and I want us to just settle just for a moment as I read these things. The things I'm going to read this morning are from the message called the invisible union of Christ and the invisible union of the bride of Christ. You know, also referred to as the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. This this is a a union &gt;&gt; that is is so special &gt;&gt; and it's so unique &gt;&gt; and it is is so uh set aside. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know when we we understand that the unity that we're talking about isn't all of us being &gt;&gt; buddies. &gt;&gt; That's right. Right. &gt;&gt; You You know what I mean? Jesus said, "I I' I've not come to bring everybody. I've come to divide." &gt;&gt; I've come to separate father against mother. God God's a separator. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that &gt;&gt; the the word of God tells us just like it's a prophecy. He He said, "Let there be light and there was light." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we know that God's word calls for total separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; It it's it's not a suggestion. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's not something that you say, "Well, I suggest that you separate yourself &gt;&gt; from unbelief." &gt;&gt; No. God's word called for it. In other words, he said there is going to be a separation from unbelief. &gt;&gt; There is that is a prophecy &gt;&gt; in other words that there's there is going to be &gt;&gt; a people &gt;&gt; that are separated from unbelief cuz God called for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Now, if he called for it, &gt;&gt; then there's got to be somebody there &gt;&gt; that's the child of that call. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a people &gt;&gt; that that he knew &gt;&gt; when he spoke it. &gt;&gt; He knew that that was going to produce a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. that there would be a people that would separate themselves all from unbelief by their doing. &gt;&gt; No, not by their doing, but because they were the child of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When God's word calls for total separation from unbelief, that's me. &gt;&gt; You understand? We begin to look at the word of God as the yearum thundum. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It's the mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're supposed to look at that mirror and then turn and say, "That's me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's me. That that that speaks of me. &gt;&gt; It's like healing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We believe God's a healer. But he told us what to do. Healing's a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. By your stripes you are healed. Well, you find yourself sick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does everybody that get sick get healed? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. But it's given to some. &gt;&gt; It's given to some to know the mystery of word of God. &gt;&gt; It's given to some. And he said, "What you do is you you you become the child of that prophecy and you look at a well man &gt;&gt; and then you walk into it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, you walk into what's been spoken of you. &gt;&gt; You walk into you're not you're you're not instantly there, but you ripen into it. You grow into it. You move into it. And as the body of believers here, you've got to understand that God knew you would be here. He understood it was his will. And he's got something in his mind that he wants you to grow into. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; If you would just listen closely as I read, we know that there's a union &gt;&gt; and there's a bride that's going to come together &gt;&gt; because it's spoken &gt;&gt; and there will be people that are a part of it And there will be people that won't be a part of it. &gt;&gt; We know there's an anointing &gt;&gt; and and a baptism of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And that's what the mystery of of anointing the ones at the end time was. That here's brother George. I'll use brother George. Brother George. He has the anointing on him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's anointed and I'm anointed. &gt;&gt; Amen. The anointing's the same. &gt;&gt; No difference in the anointing. But what the difference is is one has an elected seed in them and the other one doesn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why he said you never judged it by the anointing. He said you judged it by their belief and acceptance of the word of God. How they deviate &gt;&gt; from the word of God is the only way you know it. You don't know it by the anointing. You know it by the deviation from the word of God &gt;&gt; now. I want to find security in that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I'm a child of the prophecy. I'm a child of what's been spoken &gt;&gt; and I don't want to put it in my hands. &gt;&gt; I want to put it in his hands. &gt;&gt; Let's read what he says. You think that's a good idea? &gt;&gt; I I think that's a real good idea because with that we're always safe. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't you believe that? &gt;&gt; Now we're believers. We know that we're that uh just here in this great place that on a mountaintop in a canyon a sword &gt;&gt; came in hand. We know that history. &gt;&gt; You understand that? We know not far from here a cloud appeared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And seven angels &gt;&gt; appeared. &gt;&gt; We know that. &gt;&gt; Yes. We know that William Brandham fulfilled Malachi 4:5, &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30, &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:7, &gt;&gt; and this may sound uh maybe I hope you don't misunderstand that, but you can't base your faith on what he fulfilled. &gt;&gt; That's right. You've got to base your faith on what he prophesied. &gt;&gt; In other words, your faith anchor place is the word of God. &gt;&gt; George Washington crossed the Delaware. I guess that's a fact. &gt;&gt; I don't know. It just but we based our whole country on it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So we this morning can absolutely 100% base our faith on what he spoke. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's given unto you to understand the mysteries of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's many people I live in Dallas Fort Worth. I went to WV Grant's church to meet WV Grant. Were Grant reached out and he grabbed me by my collar just like this just as right to my face. He put his face up in my face. His son was preaching on the platform. He grabbed me and he said, "David, you see all these wheelchairs and all these crutches?" His lobby was full of them. He said, "9 and 9/10 of them came from William Brandom's meetings." &gt;&gt; And he never believed. &gt;&gt; He He actually looked me in the eye. He said, "David, whatever you do, you stay with William Brandom." He was the only true prophet I ever knew. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I that was a soul's harbor. &gt;&gt; We walked away from that place and two weeks later WB Grant passed away. I'm so glad, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; he had that testimony &gt;&gt; on his lips &gt;&gt; to when he went to meet the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Follow me just a moment. Children of prophecy. He's talking about sers as this the time and how that he prophesied about it and spoke what he saw in the vision and how that we know it came to pass. &gt;&gt; So it birthed &gt;&gt; the seven seals. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then we've got the revelation in this last days for the message of of the Lord God to gather his bride together." We've got the message to gather the bride together. No other age has it been promised. It's been promised for this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, John 14:12, Joel 2:38. Those promises is just exactly like John the Baptist identified himself in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, he was identified in the scriptures. He was the child &gt;&gt; of those prophecies coming to pass. &gt;&gt; They didn't come to pass in any other man. They didn't come to pass in any other ministry. There were there was no other messengers, no other age. They were it was totally the scriptures, the prophesied &gt;&gt; prophecies of Malachi 4:5. William Brandham was the child of the prophecy of Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; Can you can you understand that? because uh but you're a child of prophecy, too. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's not the day that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the day that produced us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not the time. And if you try to live there &gt;&gt; and not live in the prophecy, &gt;&gt; you'll find that the prophecy will pass you by. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; We want to go forward, don't we? &gt;&gt; We want to have victory. I I'll read and just read these statements and close quickly. You know, he makes this statement. He says Jesus identified himself. What do they say? Away with such a person. John's a wild man. The church wasn't able to receive it. It's the pattern. Neither will the church receive it today. &gt;&gt; It's the pattern. It's given unto you to know the mysteries of God, but to others it is not. &gt;&gt; Even to the point that lest they repent, &gt;&gt; it wasn't given to them. &gt;&gt; That wasn't who they were. &gt;&gt; But he says this. He says, "But to the elect." God is calling to the elect. &gt;&gt; God is calling &gt;&gt; to the elect. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. When the disciples went away and they went out and they they done all these great miracles and all these these great works and they came back and they were rejoicing. He said, "I saw Satan falling from the sky and and they were so excited." But you know what he told them? He said, "Don't rejoice &gt;&gt; because these spirits were subject to you, but rather rejoice because your name was written on the book of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think of that. &gt;&gt; He He's trying to identify you. &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring us to the place that we understand we are the manifestation of what that he spoke. [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's not something that we believe out here. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something that we actually are. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; The elect, they know it. calling a virtuous bride, the word, the last day church, the elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The elected &gt;&gt; lady, &gt;&gt; the chosen lady. &gt;&gt; Just follow me for a few quotes if you would. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word. &gt;&gt; How many believe that? Do we believe the prophecy? &gt;&gt; Not the history, &gt;&gt; but what's spoken &gt;&gt; then the bride is always part of the bridegroom. So, the bride will not be a denomination. It'll have to be the word manifested &gt;&gt; to be the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; It'll have to be the prophecy &gt;&gt; birthed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And come into existence &gt;&gt; to be the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; Is that right? If it wasn't spoken, if it was never spoken that there would be a bride, there was no way that we could decide that we were the bride. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God even says there's been brides and brides and brides and churches and churches. &gt;&gt; Everybody can make the claim. I don't care about the claims. I care about the reality of the prophecy coming to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I care about. I want to be able to look into THE MIRROR OF GOD'S WORD AND SAY, "THAT'S ME. &gt;&gt; I'm what he was speaking about. &gt;&gt; And walk away &gt;&gt; confident &gt;&gt; that I was more than a man that spoke it. Listen, he promised to do it. &gt;&gt; He promised to call out and elect people. &gt;&gt; He promised to do it. Can I put another word there? He prophesied &gt;&gt; to do it. &gt;&gt; It will be. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said how he did never loses his pattern. &gt;&gt; He always did it by the pattern. He does it every time by the pattern. &gt;&gt; He does it again. Calls out his virtuous bride in the last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting for Isaac. What a beautiful time. What does he do? He always does it. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; He always does it the same way. He never changes his method. &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says now. You're the So what I'm what I You understand what I'm trying to say? I'm reading to you what brother Brandham said, &gt;&gt; but this is in 1965. &gt;&gt; So what he said then is prophecy today. That's correct. &gt;&gt; He spoke it, &gt;&gt; but what he spoke had to become flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And there's got to be somebody somewhere &gt;&gt; that says, "This is me. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; I'm the child of this prophecy. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm who he spoke of. [cheering] Can you imagine as a body believers &gt;&gt; shalom tabernacle if you could walk out in this Tucson with a burning light in you knowing you're the CHILDREN OF GOD KNOWING YOU WERE CALLED FOR A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; You would change the atmosphere &gt;&gt; around you. Now I want you to notice he does it in that way in every age. He does it every time by the same method. He has to take believers. &gt;&gt; And then in order to have believers to meet the word, &gt;&gt; he's got to predestinate it to that age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He had to predestinate. &gt;&gt; He had to prophesy. &gt;&gt; He had to say, "There's going to be believers there. There's going to be somebody there that will receive the word. There's there's go they're they're going to be there. I'm going to have them be there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of that prophecy. Yes, you are. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that he spoke of &gt;&gt; when he said he'd have a believer there. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter that I was in California. It didn't matter. I was selling drugs with the Hell's Angel motorcycle gang. It didn't matter I had long hair. It didn't matter how de wretched I was. &gt;&gt; He spoke it. &gt;&gt; He planted it. &gt;&gt; He prophesied it. He was going to get me from where I was TO WHERE HE PROPHESIED THAT I would be [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; and nothing was going to stop it. &gt;&gt; He's speaking of you here. &gt;&gt; This is this is &gt;&gt; this is shalom. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got to predestinate it to that age. You see it? He's got to predestinate this thing to be there in order to meet the challenge of the age. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? &gt;&gt; Do you feel it? &gt;&gt; Do you see it? &gt;&gt; Do you understand it? That's what's happening today. &gt;&gt; He predestinated it to this by fornowledge. &gt;&gt; He predestinated in Malachi 4, it's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he come over and predestinated anything to happen in his word, he had to prove his word to be so. And when he predestinates anything to happen and says it will happen, he knows that seed will be there just at that time. He predestinated a bride. She's going to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to be a rapture. She's going to be there. He predestinates it by fornowledge. See, there's nothing going to stop it. &gt;&gt; I'm not asking you to believe that this morning. &gt;&gt; You automatically believe it because Brother Brandham said it. &gt;&gt; But I'm asking you to take possession of it. &gt;&gt; I I want you to hear when he says there's going to BE A BRIDE. SHE has to be there. I want you to say, I'M THE CHILD OF THAT PROPHECY. &gt;&gt; I think that you're that you're getting the point &gt;&gt; there. It's just so so beautiful &gt;&gt; that the things that he said, the things that he told us that we were &gt;&gt; we believe those things. &gt;&gt; We we we understand those things. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, just think you you don't you don't think this is different. &gt;&gt; I I got so many quotes written down here. I'm just I I I just get into this and it thrills my soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know there's anointed ones at the end time. &gt;&gt; I know there's people I don't agree with. &gt;&gt; I have good friends. I mean, they're my friends. I love them. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to hate them. &gt;&gt; I have friends that only play tapes. &gt;&gt; I I I play tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I told Brother Israel, I said, "I you got me in the worst place in the world. I got to preach after brother George. I got to preach after brother Ferguson. And now I have to preach after the plane of the tape. [laughter] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I didn't want him to turn the tape off. &gt;&gt; But you know why I I love him? &gt;&gt; It's because it's not there. It's in here. Amen. &gt;&gt; He took this stony heart &gt;&gt; and replaced it &gt;&gt; with a heart of flesh. &gt;&gt; And I know God doesn't change. &gt;&gt; I know he can change. &gt;&gt; We don't change the word. The word changes us. &gt;&gt; It comes to all of us in season. There's people that don't believe in preachers. I love them. &gt;&gt; The love doesn't come from doctrine. &gt;&gt; It comes from me being a sinner. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. You say the love of God comes from you being a sinner. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; Because I know where I come from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I look back, &gt;&gt; I'd never come into this pulpit. &gt;&gt; But I want to cover that now. I'm going to skip all the things I got wrote wrote here to read. You know, the things that he said. I'll just read a few of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "The anointed word of God being vindicated before any man that's born to be a son of God with the predestinated germ into him &gt;&gt; for this hour, &gt;&gt; he'll see God's message as sure as there is a God in heaven." &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? He said here he said he the bridegroom took away your shame. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And put in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Washed by the water of the word and the blood of life. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. your first husband that you were married to the world, the anointed bridegroom which forained you. &gt;&gt; I I I I want to keep laying this down. You're predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're forordained. &gt;&gt; He put the seed in you &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You were with him in his thinking. If you ever had eternal life, you always had eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not used to thinking that way. &gt;&gt; That's shuck thinking. &gt;&gt; But he's prophesying. &gt;&gt; There's a seed. &gt;&gt; There's a predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; It was in his thinking. He wrote your name on the lamb's book of life &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. If it wasn't there, you won't be there. &gt;&gt; But if it's there, nothing can put it on. Nothing can take it off. &gt;&gt; You understand? You are. Those were prophecies. &gt;&gt; Those were things that he spoke. Those were things that there were. And there's a predestinated people that God put here that would see that, believe that, accept that, and understand that was their identification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, what breaks my heart is I see the heaviness of our past. and what we are in the flesh &gt;&gt; weighing on us. &gt;&gt; We just can't seem to wrap our minds around what he's done for us. We just can't seem to bring ourselves to the realization &gt;&gt; of of what that he says. He said you were fore orained to it. He goes here says you are standing completely justified &gt;&gt; as though you never did it at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is my message &gt;&gt; to the church. &gt;&gt; He talks about as we go off the air, he says you are standing if you're standing on God's word. Because if you're standing on what he said, &gt;&gt; if you're standing on what he prophesied, if you're standing on the word, the word for this age, the word for this hour, if you're standing on that and you believe what he said, you believe what he said about you, he said, and you're and you're you're on God's word and with God's word, every amen, every jot, every tit Where are you standing? I'm trying to get you to pull away from them chucks [cough] &gt;&gt; from that old thinking. &gt;&gt; Quit looking in your mirror and look in what God's mirror says of you. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; he says, "Come out into the wheat where you can get right before the sun. I hear the combines coming. You're standing completely justified. You never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; What did he he he he say over here? But the word justified is as though you never done it. &gt;&gt; It's not even regarded at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; How is it done in God's book of the sea of God's forgetfulness? Your old book and marriage is divorced is dead. Even even in the memory of God. &gt;&gt; You say he knows all things. No, he don't. Oh, that's a little tough. &gt;&gt; I'll read you. I can read you it straight out of the book where he says God doesn't even know it. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's not where we were in the beginning. That's not where we were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; You know this. &gt;&gt; You knew you were in his thinking, &gt;&gt; right? How long you been in this message? &gt;&gt; How many go listen to rising of the sun? &gt;&gt; Go listen to the Easter Seal. &gt;&gt; Go listen to Invisible Union of the bride. That that's the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Go read Satan's Eden, &gt;&gt; God of this evil age. &gt;&gt; The indictment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God hasn't lost control. &gt;&gt; There's two powers. &gt;&gt; Satan's power lying and God's power telling the truth to his elected lady. &gt;&gt; It's not a great mystery. &gt;&gt; It's very simple. We believe what he said, &gt;&gt; not the history of it, &gt;&gt; but the unfolding of it &gt;&gt; in our lives. &gt;&gt; God can only reveal himself to the you that you were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? You were with him in the beginning. Has that has that settled in? &gt;&gt; He he goes he like I'll just you guys can go back and read it. You never you you just never did it in in the f in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was thrown. He accused you &gt;&gt; but you never done it in the first place. The old union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; You wasn't married to it to what? &gt;&gt; Begin with &gt;&gt; he, the bridegroom, bore your shame himself. &gt;&gt; For you were for you were in your place. He took your place. For you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world. The Bible said so. You are predestinated seed. &gt;&gt; I hope that shalom tabernacle will walk from this place saying I am predestinated. &gt;&gt; I am the bride of Christ. or we are we were elected &gt;&gt; for this hour &gt;&gt; our path forward &gt;&gt; is to walk in the prophecy that was spoke of us. &gt;&gt; I love this message with all my heart. I was on the earth when my prophet left. I didn't sit in the meetings. I knew the men that did. And how when he walked in a room that he sucked the life out of that room and presented the presence and the glory of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've talked to people that have stood at him when he would look them in the eyes. &gt;&gt; That wasn't given to me. &gt;&gt; Do I wish it was? &gt;&gt; Sure. I knew the men that knew him. I've watched them cross the portal one by one. But there's one thing I've ever understood from everybody that knew him. I saw the change &gt;&gt; in their life. &gt;&gt; I saw the humility. &gt;&gt; I saw the reverence. &gt;&gt; I I I I I just I I saw the nature that they knew it was bigger than they were. &gt;&gt; All their doctrines, all their knowledge, all their thinking that this man possessed something that was bigger. I wasn't privileged to that. But what I am privileged to is what he stored up for me to eat. &gt;&gt; The past didn't blind me. &gt;&gt; I was a child of what he spoke. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the prophecy. Yes. &gt;&gt; On the child of when he spoke that there would be a bride, &gt;&gt; that there would be an elect lady, &gt;&gt; that there was a seed and the seed had that power to transform itself. &gt;&gt; Those are the things that we are. &gt;&gt; The people that listen to him, it passed them by like like you couldn't understand it. You go up and you said, "How can he sit there and raise the dead and do all the miracles and all those things and and not see it?" And yet they had the same anointing on them &gt;&gt; that every other believer had on them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. It wasn't given to them, &gt;&gt; but it was given &gt;&gt; to you. &gt;&gt; You're the child &gt;&gt; of that prophet. &gt;&gt; You're the one he knew in the beginning. You are the one that he said stand perfectly without spot, &gt;&gt; without wrinkle. &gt;&gt; That you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Oh, the spiritual union of Christ and his church. Now, when the flesh is becoming word, &gt;&gt; that's me. You say, "Oh, it just can't be. You're a sinner." &gt;&gt; No, I'm not. &gt;&gt; He said, "I never did it &gt;&gt; in the beginning." And the and the when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh, manifested, vindicated, just what the Bible said would happen in this day is happening. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, you're standing completely. You never sinned at the first place. God don't even know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just think of how our spirits when you heard me say that that little thing you start putting it through your filter. Let this message filter your thoughts. &gt;&gt; It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You never did it. You were accused of it by the accuser, but really from the beginning, you were predestinated to be sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away, is dead, absolutely out of existence, even in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to close with this statement if you would. I trust that it means to you what it means to me. There is somebody who is perfectly spotless. &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the prophecy &gt;&gt; look at what he said. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And walk into it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He said I would be spotless. &gt;&gt; He said he made me spotless. &gt;&gt; He said that's not what I was in the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; He you you he not only did he do that, but he he even he even went further than that. And just think of of how far that he takes me back. He says, "Hallelujah." You notice you're not only that, but you're going to the wedding in the sky. You are wearing the wedding band of predestination. &gt;&gt; Unmmerited grace, &gt;&gt; a wedding band of grace unmmerited of your own. &gt;&gt; God did it himself. &gt;&gt; He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band on you there and put your name on the book. What? Thanksgiving. Hallelujah. Praise God. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; You You know what he said? He said, "I love that revelation more than anything else." &gt;&gt; No, but do we believe it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or when you look at yourself, &gt;&gt; do you still see that sinful man? &gt;&gt; Do you still see that flesh? You the you see the flesh that wars against the spirit &gt;&gt; and these two are contrary. &gt;&gt; God don't even like your flesh. &gt;&gt; That's why he's going to give you a new body. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; You we know why we're here. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he wanted to reveal himself. He let us drop down here &gt;&gt; so he could prove he's a savior, &gt;&gt; a deliverer, &gt;&gt; a healer. &gt;&gt; That's not my existence. &gt;&gt; That's not God. That's not the real me. &gt;&gt; The real me was what I was in him. &gt;&gt; He looks at what he predestinated. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He looks at what he spoke. &gt;&gt; He looks at what he wrote. &gt;&gt; He looks at what he created &gt;&gt; for you &gt;&gt; in the beginning &gt;&gt; and that's what he sees. But can we look at that this morning and not start looking at ourselves? &gt;&gt; Not start looking at all our failures. &gt;&gt; Do I have failures? Yeah. But you know what also I have? I have a prophecy &gt;&gt; that he became me &gt;&gt; so I'll become him. That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm going to look at it &gt;&gt; and I'm going to walk in it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let God's word filter me. &gt;&gt; But I know what I am. I know where I'm going. &gt;&gt; I can look at you and say, "I come from God. &gt;&gt; I go to God. &gt;&gt; You may doubt it, but he said it and I believe it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I'm a child of this prophecy. [applause] This ain't an old message. &gt;&gt; This is something new. &gt;&gt; This isn't Pentecost. &gt;&gt; This was new. &gt;&gt; This was the eternal return. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To what you were in the beginning. &gt;&gt; And you can look at this flesh and say, "Oh flesh, oh grave, where's your sting? Yeah, &gt;&gt; I have a crown of life &gt;&gt; predestinated for me to wear. &gt;&gt; My name's written in a book. &gt;&gt; He said he'd have a bride. He's going to have a bride. &gt;&gt; And either you're going to put yourself in this morning or you're going to put yourself out. &gt;&gt; That's right. You're either you're going to take the prophecy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Despite where you're at, &gt;&gt; and know that it's got to come to pass, &gt;&gt; and it's going to come to pass in me. &gt;&gt; Mary said, "Let it be done &gt;&gt; according to thy will. Jesus looked at Peter and to said, "Who do men say that I am?" He said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God. He said, "Blessed art thou, see Simon of Jonah, flesh and blood never revealed this to you, &gt;&gt; but my father which in heaven has revealed it." &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal to me my name was on the lamb book. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood didn't reveal to me that I was going to a wedding supper. How many wants to go to the wedding supper? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're going to see me there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm there. &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's just so hard to believe, isn't it? You're looking at me. &gt;&gt; Your minds are going a mile a minute. &gt;&gt; You just can't see how it's possible. &gt;&gt; You know why it's possible? He prophesied it. &gt;&gt; He told Noah, "It's going to rain." Yes. &gt;&gt; Everybody went [laughter] right. What's that? &gt;&gt; Rapture. What's that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Election. What's that? Predestination. What's that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I didn't choose him. &gt;&gt; He chose me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I didn't start the work. &gt;&gt; He started it. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I can't finish the work. &gt;&gt; He'll finish it. &gt;&gt; I just know one thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was predestinated. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I've been reunited &gt;&gt; with the nature &gt;&gt; I had in him &gt;&gt; in the beginning. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I don't see that." It don't matter if you see it. But if you believe it's prophesied of you, &gt;&gt; and you know you're a child of that prophecy, &gt;&gt; then you know it'll come to pass. &gt;&gt; Mary, not knowing a man. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Believed it was going to happen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; see no evidence whatsoever believed. Children of Abraham, &gt;&gt; children of prophecy, &gt;&gt; believe that the God that made the promise was able to bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; The God that said I was predestinated to be THE BRIDE. THE GOD THAT SAID MY NAME was put on the Lamb's book of life. The God that said there was a germ SEED THAT FOUND ME. That God is able to bring THIS PROPHECY TO PASS. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of that prophecy. In closing, &gt;&gt; oh my goodness, I got lost. I I've redeemed you, brother. You'll never be a long- winded preacher again. I just I just took that over from you. He said, he said this, if it was flesh in the days of the son, the groom, it'll be flesh today by the bride. &gt;&gt; Whosoever sins you remit, to them they are remitted. Whoseever sins you retain, to them they are retained. That's what he said. He says, "Now that's made flesh in the bride. Your ability to retain and remit sin." But listen now, the Catholic Church picked that up &gt;&gt; and takes it to their priest. But that's carnal. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, they picked it up. Would you forgive me? Would you forgive me? Would you forgive me? But that's not what he said. &gt;&gt; He said, "Forgive me. &gt;&gt; You can't forgive me &gt;&gt; cuz I never did it in the first place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This guy did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But that ain't the real me. [applause] &gt;&gt; Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; The seed of God remains in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans, I think it's nine. &gt;&gt; He says, "Jacob I loved, Esau I hated. &gt;&gt; The children not yet being born, neither have done any good nor evil. that the law of predestination and election might stand not of the flesh but of the call. &gt;&gt; You don't think we have a path forward? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. We're not near as far down the road as we think we are. We're continually labeling ourselves sinners. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We're continually walking in doubt of ourselves. &gt;&gt; We let our flesh have preeminence over us. &gt;&gt; And we very rarely flee to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Come on. Good. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; he put us here &gt;&gt; in this hour. The Catholics took that. Now, we're talking about your sins being remitted, your sins being totally put in the sea of God, forgetfulness to be remembered. no more. Your sins not being laid to your charge. You know everything you did, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he wants to bring you past that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants you to bring you to the place where you absolutely know that's not on you anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you'll never gain power &gt;&gt; over Satan &gt;&gt; with you packing that baggage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll always be able to stand up and point to your past &gt;&gt; and accuse you. But when you know &gt;&gt; that the God of heaven &gt;&gt; does not have that in his mind. &gt;&gt; He doesn't recall it. &gt;&gt; That's not how he sees me. When I stand there to pray for you, &gt;&gt; I'm not packing David McGary. &gt;&gt; That's not him who's praying. It's what he had in his mind. I'm just doing what he said to do. &gt;&gt; But listen what he said. What brings the remission of sin in your life? What brings it? You don't have to think what you did yesterday. He knows what you did yesterday. Well, you were yet a sinner. He died for you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing hid from him. He knows it. &gt;&gt; It's why he came down. &gt;&gt; Paid the price so you wouldn't. But what remits our sin? Many of us would say, "Well, Calvary. Calvary paid the price for it." But if you don't accept it, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; he died for everybody. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thousands of people in this town got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't given to them. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; To know the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; There's anointed ones at the end time everywhere. Is there differences in the message? Fine. Nothing. He didn't know. &gt;&gt; But the one thing I know, he said this, the Catholic Church picked that up and takes it to their priest. But that's carnal. Watch. It's the spiritual revealed word that did it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What remitted your sins? &gt;&gt; The spiritual revealed word that you never did it &gt;&gt; in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's what remits your sins. You think you're going to go out there and redo it? &gt;&gt; No. Accept the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Believe it and walk in it. &gt;&gt; That's what gives you power over the enemy is what he said. &gt;&gt; He said the spiritual revealed word is what remitted your sins. I read it. He said you never did it in the first place. You were predestinated for the beginning. It's not laid to your charge. God don't even remember it. He It's out of his throne in the sea of forgiveness. You stand perfectly &gt;&gt; justified. &gt;&gt; Virtuous pride. &gt;&gt; That revelation &gt;&gt; is what remits us from our sins. &gt;&gt; He said, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel. Them that believe shall be saved. Them that believe not shall be lost. If you believe this morning, your sins are remitted. They're remitted. &gt;&gt; But you can choose &gt;&gt; to retain them. &gt;&gt; You can choose to pack the baggage &gt;&gt; of your flesh. &gt;&gt; But I'm not a child of the flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know how he's going to do it, &gt;&gt; but he said he would. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And alls I know &gt;&gt; is that I stand this morning &gt;&gt; as if I never &gt;&gt; did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. in the first place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shalom, if you would bring that message. Every miracle, every gift in the Bible, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; was attached to the great commission. Go into all the world. These signs will follow. &gt;&gt; It's always attached. It's freely given. Freely give. Our message is far beyond. And I hope you don't take offense in this is far beyond the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5, Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7. It was an exodus into the eternal thinking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Of almighty God where you were &gt;&gt; in the beginning. You share the message. You watch the results. You didn't build this place big enough &gt;&gt; for this gospel. [applause] &gt;&gt; The world's hungering for this gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my message to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. This is my message to the church now. You've never done it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you, children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the prophecy. [applause] [applause] [cheering] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a wonderful word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say amen to that? &gt;&gt; My my. That's the best news I heard all day. &gt;&gt; I never done it in the first place. So, God bless you. We're going to dedicate this tabernacle and the the place and the people and the little ministry. Once again, um I'm ask brother Ferguson to do that as he prepares uh to come. And as he does that, I'd like him to uh rededicate my family. I'm going to have my family come up to the front, Karesa, Levi, Aaliyah, my wife, and just to pray for us. And brothers can pray as well. Let it be a place where we could come and worship the Lord. So it's set aside like if you said I dedicate this, it's set aside for a particular purpose. No, in the Psalms. I'll take just two. It's all right. You all can hear. Okay. We'll just take just as we go into the dedication. Just &gt;&gt; this one is all right. This is okay. All right. Good. All right. I'd like for us to just one second. Yeah. We want to take a little scripture that I think we all know it by heart and to dedicate this house of the Lord. This place is a place of worship where we are dedicating it for the word of the Lord and to the honor and praise and glory of God. So we want to look at Psalm 122 and we will read just one verse out of this. I was glad. [clears throat] I was glad when they let's let's read it together. I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. [clears throat] Then we'll take another from the psalm today. Some people think it's sad. It's sad when you tell them come into the house of the Lord. You've met people George Church that when you say come to the house of the Lord, they're sad to hear that. But we're glad when they said unto us, &gt;&gt; how many is glad when they &gt;&gt; to know that you could come into the house of the Lord? Let's lift our hands and give him praise for it. &gt;&gt; Then we will read. Now, I'm not going to preach, brother David. The Lord used him. I'm just going to read another psalm here, another scripture here just before we do the dedicational prayer. We will read here Psalm 133. It's a very short psalm, just three verses. We will read that and then we will go into the dedicational prayer. Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a what a scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a scripture. It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the dew of Herman and as the Judith descended upon the mountain of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more. So, as you see, brethren, as we get together here in the house of the Lord, it was glad for us when he said, "Let us come into the house of the Lord." We come into the house of the Lord in the spirit of unity. Now, I I'd like to for us to sing a little song if we could just as a dedicational song and we will sing it if the musicians and our song leader will come. Amazing grace. Amazing grace. We will sing that and [music] then right after I would like for the ministers to come. If all the ministers could come to the platform [music] and then we will all join hands together to dedicate. Now first Israel wants to dedicate. You want me to do the dedication of the family or the church first? The family. Okay. Let's sing Amazing Grace and then we will [music] have the dedication of Israel and Sharon and the family. [music] could you come up &gt;&gt; and after we sing this you overcome [music] let's sing that together amen [singing] like [singing] me &gt;&gt; I once was lost Oh, but now I'm found. &gt;&gt; I was blind, [singing] but now I [music] see. It was grace that [singing and music] taught my heart to fear. And grace my [singing] fears really. [singing] How precious [music] did that [singing] grace appear beyond [singing] [music] our first. [singing] I'd like for the ministers to come to the platform at this time to brother David. Um that all you ministers just get a place on [music] the platform. We'll all come together for the dedication of the church of the building and we want to I want you all to join your faith with me, your heart with me and we will all pray together for Israel and Sharon and for this family. We want to dedicate it. I'll just move this platform a little bit back. If we could take it back a little bit. Thank you. Now, a few ministers could just stand with me. [clears throat] And Sharon, could you come? Uh, Karisha, could you come? Levi and Aaliyah. We will just have them come right here. Come, Levi, come. Um, I'm going to do a little funny thing. I'm going to put Sharon to the end here. I don't want you you could just slip right in there. Your dad Levi. Sharon, I want you to go to the end. Levi, you just stand right here. And Lee, you just stand right here. Okay. Excuse me. See, it makes it a Okay, [laughter] excuse me if you see me doing this. It's true that the Lord in his love and mercy brought Israel and Sharon together. And during the years I I remember when Israel spoke to me about Sharon. I told him Sharon was my is my first daughter and she was always a daddy's girl. &gt;&gt; And she loved mommy. She loved mommy but just a little you know how it is you [laughter] know and someone said to me when they got married said would you cry? And I said well am I going to cry when you know when when they get married? Because it was hard for me because I was Sharon's pastor. I was her father and I was also her boss. She worked for me. She worked at Voice of God office. So poor Sharon. That was hard on her. She had she had to have me as a dad, her pastor, and also her boss. So that was three persons in one to her. So it was kind of when I had to take her hand and trick her over to Israel's headship. &gt;&gt; It was really something for me in Sacramento. I didn't cry natural tears to my eyes, but in my heart I cried to see Sharon go in and I know that, you know, she'd go for the best. And I really am happy to see what the Lord did because in the call of the ministry when God calls a man, he calls his wife also. And a lot of people don't realize what a pastor's wife has to go through. And they have to go through a lot. Amen. And it was hard sometimes for them. And Sharon growing up and I remember Sharon telling me, she says, "Daddy, I will not be the p the the wife of a of a a pastor because I don't want she didn't want it. She did not want it. She did not want it to be because she saw all what they had to go through as little girls. I'll be gone for weeks in the mission fields in Africa. When we were building the work in Africa, I had to go and it was hard on them. But it's through it all. I could certainly thank the Lord because he fitted her. He he he shaped Sharon for this role. Amen. And I'm certainly happy to see what he did. &gt;&gt; And now I want to just come Sharon a little closer. I'll lay my hands and you all just lay hands on each other. Just hold. Yes. Just just yes, that's correct. Just hold hands with each other and Lord God of heaven, you've as our brother spoke this morning, you predestinated things. You brought things in ways that we could never understand. Our minds are too limited as human beings to be able to figure it all out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But somehow the other you know exactly how to put the pieces together in your divine plan. And knowing Lord that you were you were going to take brother Doug Mchuse that was here and brother Perry knowing that there had to be others to follow and to keep the light burning in the city of Tucson where you sent brother Brandon to this place for purpose for many purposes Lord. And father, as you have Israel here and I remember Lord when he was moving to Tucson, I I was in doubts in my mind. I wondered what would happen. Listen, I we we weren't sure. But father in heaven, even if we did not understand, you knew exactly what you were doing. This was part of your plan. This is part of what you wanted to achieve. And Lord God, I as in my hands in Israel and he's like my son and Sharon my daughter and the love that you've placed in our hearts for each other and not only a love but a spirit of understanding that you've placed between us Lord and I thank you for it and it is something that you could bless us. You said what God has joined together let no man put us under. and you could bless us with a spirit of love and understanding that we could understand each other, understand our motives, our objectives, why we do certain things, why we don't do certain things. And oh God of heaven, because we know that we are under one leadership, and that is you. And Lord, from this union, you've given Karisha, you've given Levi, you've given Ayah, and oh God, how happy am I for my grandchildren here, Father. I pray that your mighty spirit your hand will be upon them to help Karishia to help Levi to help Aaliyah. Lord, oh God, if there is a tomorrow, they will be the children of tomorrow to continue to be a light to this message, an example and a witness to the things that has been committed into our hands. And Lord, it is such a joy for us to see our children and our grandchildren and coming Lord all down the and we know see them holding to you and staying with your word and oh God they can't do it without your help. I just pray that the Holy Spirit will keep this family united together in a spirit of love and understanding. Lord, we love you. We thank you. And I commit them now into your hands. not just praying for Israel and his family, but for the ministry that you've committed in his hands. And to know that his family is also a part of that ministry. We give you honor. We give you thanks. We glorify you for everything knowing that all the praise and the glory and the honor and the trust and the confidence is all towards you, Lord. And today in the presence of this whole congregation and in the ministers that are all here that have united their hearts with us in the presence of the Holy Spirit and in the presence of the angels of God that are here Lord God of heaven. We pray Lord God and under the authority of your word. We command a blessing upon our brother, his wife, his family, all the ministers in the church. We pray as we lift our hands to you in worship and in thanks in Jesus precious holy wonderful name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you as well. [applause] No, don't go yet. Don't go yet. God bless you all. Amen. Bless you. Sure. Come on up. You minister just just come right up on the platform if you could find a little spot on the platform. There's room over here. Just come right on up. All you brothers, I'm so happy to see brother Fabi here. Brother Fab, I wish I could speak Jews to be [laughter] Oh my. &gt;&gt; We We would Now I'd like for the whole congregation to stand at this time. &gt;&gt; All of us to stand. Now we have put all our efforts into the building. We believe that the Holy Spirit has guided you. Now we want to do this today. We want to dedicate this sanctuary as a place of prayer as a place where the Holy You can come and be blessed where you can receive deliverance. We dedicating it. We setting aside for that purpose. And as we dedicate it, we dedicate our lives with it. So it's not just the building we are dedicating because the the real the sanctuary is not really the physical, you know, the brick and stuff. It's really you. So you as we read it, it was glad. I was glad when they said unto me, come into the house of the Lord and to see brethren here in the spirit of unity. God bless you all. Let us bow our heads. Father, &gt;&gt; father, &gt;&gt; here are all the brothers. &gt;&gt; And your prophet told us that when your anointing comes, when your spirit comes, it welcomes the people, it's a welcoming feeling. And father, as we gather here and knowing that you are here, knowing that your presence is here with us, uh Lord, we we don't have to just say that brother Israel welcome us. We don't have to say that the church members welcome us. We know in our hearts that the Holy Spirit also welcomes us here in this building, in this meeting. And father, as we bow our heads to give you honor that you made it possible to purchase for this group of believers here to purchase this building. There's much prayer went into it, much hope, much faith, much searching, praying. Oh God of heaven, the sacrifices, the people that have contributed financially, giving whatever they could to help. Oh God of heaven, how we honor you for them. And then we pray that the anointing as you came down in the tabernacle of Solomon, oh God of heaven, and the ministers are had the priests can hardly minister. And as we see brother David this morning standing there ministering having a hard time to even stop Lord because of the presence and the anointing of your presence Lord how we honor you as you bring us together in a spirit of unity that we could understand the motives and the objectives of each other that we could Lord say that we all have the same motive is to glorify you to praise you to honor you and Oh God of heaven, knowing that you are here, we thank you as we dedicate this building and every one of us dedicate our entire lives and all that we are to you. And we thank you in the lovely name of the Lord and Jesus Christ. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; We could sing that chorus. We could sing that little chorus. Brother, where's brother Ram?
