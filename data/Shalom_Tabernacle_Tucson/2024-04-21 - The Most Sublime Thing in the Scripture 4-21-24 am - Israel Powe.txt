[Music] [Music] what [Music] amen let us all stand we'll turn into Revelations chapter 6 we're in the fourth seal for our adult Sunday school and um verses number seven and 8 is our scripture reading and so let us bow our heads for word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again Lord we pray that you'll speak to our hearts and you'll bless this service in a mighty way bless those that are gathered here and those that are making their way to the house of the Lord oh God we commit our ways to you all of our thoughts all of our expectations Lord let it be focused and centered upon you forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings we pray and may we find Grace this morning in Jesus name amen amen amen Revelations chapter number six verse verses number seven and 8 let's read it all together as a class and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth amen let's sing only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only believe oh only Bel only [Music] Bel all things are possible only we leave God bless you you may be seated brother brandham was invented or manifactured to take stain Hallelujah take the C out of ink or any other stain they got it it'll break it up to you it never will find it again it goes back to gases and all way back to Cosmic light and the past molecules and everything else that turns back to the original where it come from it's a creation had a creation had to come from a Creator but all the chemicals that was manufactured and pucked together they broke up and that's just all there is to it there's no more of it Hallelujah even the very the very water substance it is blends with the Clorox which which is ashes Amen to God it's all clean that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does to the true child of God when he confesses that sin and stands are justified in his Mery goodness even it's so great God said I can't even remember it [Music] anymore and he's absolutely my son Hallelujah really I saying to you if you s this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe in what you said shall come to pass you can have that what amen I know that's true I've seen squirrels appear I don't know six different times I know not the one that would be said here just as he could create squirrels as same as he create flies or frogs anything else God the Creator right and when no mortal being but when that's sin of that martal is confessed and dropped into that torox of the bleach of Jesus Christ that bleaches all sin he's purely unadulterated without sin without he that's born of God does not commit sin for he cannot stands between him and God it ever get there breaks it up and sends it right back to the one who perverted it I feel religious I demoli now to reveal notice fully Satan on his throne yes sir offered it to God offered it to our Lord here he is sitting here with this beastly heart in him now here is the person the Beast the Incarnate devil he makes his appearing here on Earth under the false pretense oh my goodness under the false pretense of the true word he Associates himself with the word he did just the same thing that his his type did which was Judas 2,000 years ago what did he do Judas came in as a Believer being a devil from the beginning he was born the son of predition he pulled up over on Jesus C he know him from the very beginning amen for he was the word all right and remember Judas took the place as treasure and fell by money so does the church of this day the Catholic churches we noticed last night charging for novenas charging for prayers and charging for everything it's almost same that fell the same thing to the daughters of the Catholic church was the Protestant the whole thing wrapped up in money and Lord Judas and here's where he fell and there's where the Protestants fall watch rides a Pale Horse oh as he appears on his ride this last ride he's on his last now now that is not in our day that will be on down it's a seal for to because see the church is done gone up when this happens when Christ appears here on Earth as je as um as this fellow appears and becomes completely completely the devil from Antichrist all the way down to false prophet then into the Beast of Devil Himself Hallelujah and he's riding on a Pale Horse colored all up mixed with all kind of colors to make him pale and deathly but when our Lord appears here on Earth he'll be right in on a Snow White Horse and he'll be completely fully the emmanual the word of God incarnate in a man how much different there is in that's the difference of notice the Antichrist is on a pale horse mixed colors a horse is a beast that represents a power his power is all mixed up why it's politics amen it's um it's National Powers it's uh religious Powers it's demon powers it's all kinds of powers mixed together a mixed Pale Horse was he's got all kinds of powers but when Jesus comes it's on a one solid color horse the word amen this one mixes his colors of red white black three colors in one represented in one and three powers represented in one white horse black horse red horse and three crowns in one sure I seen the crown myself all that close looked at it let me get to it on kind of glass so there it was big lock on it set in a case Triple Crown so I know it's the truth amen so there he was Triple ground biker Heaven purgatory and Earth three powers United together all mixed up in a color pale death spoken a whole thing political and and religious and and demon powers mixed together politics he is the king of politics Satan is smart sure don't try to out wi just just trust the Lord amen I've all went through it before all smart educations and things like that come from the wrong side just follow through the scripture find out if that's right follow King's Children see what they become then follow say children see what they not as I'm supporting ignorance not at all no but you take any person's Harley of the Bible very seldom and there's one named Paul that was a smart man and he said he had to forget everything he know in order to know Christ he said I never come to you with enticing words of wisdom of man but I come to you in the power of the resurrection of Christ that's right power of the Holy Ghost look at the others some of them didn't know right the left hand and and all I look down through the age of the prophets and where they come from and so forth see what I mean see it's a smart intellectual and wisdom wisdom is exactly the very thing that takes you away from God hallelujah he had three powers or three three Jewish dictions of Earth heaven and Purgatory he is himself a trinity that's what he's made up of and he rides in a trinity his powers in a trinity his crowns in a trinity his horses in a trinity that what he is a trinity a power of Trinity a crown of Trinity a horse riding of Trinity that's offices a four again Hallelujah see a four against all right three stages of his ministry makes him one person Satan incarnate three stages of the many Antichrist false prophet and Beast and three typing see now these three types now that makes him go uh God makes himself knowing too and water blood spirit makes a Christian a Son of God by the word of God see and these three power makes him a devil see all this sh is water blood and spirit which is of god and that's politics religion and Demon power mixed together makes him the devil Christ first coming Immortal he comes three times Christ is in three watch how he comes he's a four watch Christ first coming he come a mortal to bleed and die is that right that's his first coming the second coming is the rapture we need him in the SKU Immortal his third coming he's the Incarnate God God Emanuel the rain on earth right want Read Fourth stage of the riter watch the fourth stage of this writer is called death death means Eternal separation from God that's what death means to be Eternal separated from God now if we place this fell out place if we have showed by the Bible who that fell is and we even took the heels of place and everywhere just exactly detail right on down and now he's called by the eagle death amen that's what he calls him remember here see death is eternal separation remember Saints don't die they sleep not die he that hear my words and Believe on him and sent me has eternal life that's right shall not come into the judgments pass from Death un life I am the resurrection life said Jesus he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die Lazarus dead he sleepeth fear not the girl's not dead but sleepeth they laugh in the scone is that right yes amen oh my see s don't die separation from God is death Eternal death and this fell is called death so keep away from him amen what is he an organiz organizational system the first number one church organized and when he took the the understanding of Constantine at the na a counsel we brought them women last night and showed how that Eve the first bride before her husband ever got to her she fell by disbelieving God's word in Eden the spiritual bride that was born on the day of Pentecost of Christ before he could get to her what happened she fell at Rome what fored her virtue of the word for D amen oh my I I feel stimulation coming [Music] again amen I don't mean to act crazy I don't mean that but I just you don't realize what that does to me I've been sitting in this for 4 days now and so I have to say something kind of get me feeling human again all right start talking like that you see Visions breaking all over the place that's reason I say something to get myself back again and Shake back again J knows me when to have a Discerning line I'll say something will make people laugh then I'll say something make people cry then I'll say something make them angry I've got something spotted out I say something to see how takes then I see what kind of light's over and what takes place I know where that where it's calling or not is that's our genuine believer all right you call them and say you so ins so and when you get down Spirit begins to anoint them you begin to see that flashing coming ever work like that around that's reason I say something kind start back again start off new again see ever since last Sunday I just set right in a room just praying that's all under the anointing I know this is right amen if you believe God I know you do you just watch the end of the week Oh Glory Hallelujah now death means Eternal separation from God you remember now Saints don't die remember his bride was given a Pale Horse I mean this rider was given a Pale Horse to um uh to go forth with he given this this Pale Horse to go forth with and he rode this Pale Horse of death now we know what that was we know what church that was and remember and last night she was not only a she was a mother of harlots am and we find out that what made her a was a woman that's that type of a woman I miss it's a flat word to say amongst the mixed audience but the Bible says that you see so then we realize that that's a that's a woman that lives untrue to her marriage vows you see she's supposed to be says herself calls herself the Queen of Heaven that would be the Bride of God God is Christ and we find that she's committing fornications and she's causing the king to the Earth to commit fornication all the rich man and great man the whole earth went after see and then we find out that she produced some daughters and they were harlots what is a harlot but a the same name a fornicator fornications evil adulteries committing what to do organized got a system Tau the manmade systems pente cost and a whole bunch now don't let your your conscience drop down your pocket Pentecost let me tell you something let's look the thing right in the face we're too late down the road I to go to pulling punches good here we are living in the lady of sin Church age and that was the most ridiculous Church age of all the rest of them Luke Warman the only one that Christ was on the outside trying to get back in and that's a Pentecostal message amen said I'm rich boy you was poor first now if you really got rich see haven't needed nothing and and all what you was he said you're naked miserable blind poor wretched and don't even know it now if a man was naked out there on the street and know it while he tried to help himself but when he when he don't know it you can't tell him no different then he's in a bad shape God have mercy notice oh my I remember this Antichrist himself being the man his bride which is his church was given a space to repent and she did not do it in that church age th you remember can you let's go back this man it won't hurt us to go back just let's go back first second chapter just a minute we'll just read second chapter of now I'll watch this this right quick now my we're just about closing time haven't got started but notice thar now it begins at the 18th verse of the of the second chapter unto the Angel that's the messenger of the Church of Tara write these things say the Son of God who has his eyes like to flames and his feet lik to fine brass I Know Thy works and thy charity and thy service thy faith thy patience and the works and th uh has to be more than the and the last be more than the first not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou suffers that woman Jezebel there you are you know her andine she was the wife of Ahab and here is the woman Church Jezebel the wife of the false prophet which is supposed to be the Janine prophet of God the poor right the genuine prophet and his wife Jezebel now Ahab was supposed to be a genuine Jew but he was a rascal you know that because his wife just let him any way he wanted to we find out Jezebel takes her money and leads these the way they want to too which cth herself a prophetess get it to teach and subdue my servants see that Jezebel teaching is equp the country the commit fornications and eat things a sacrifice the idol I gave her space to repent of her fornications and she repented not watch this next verse I will cast her into a bed that's hell and them that commit adultery with her onto great tribulations that's going into the great tribulations not the church now except they repent of their deeds now watch out here I will kill her children her harlots with death spiritual death you believe it that's the word I will kill them with death if they're killed they're Eternal separated all right remember he gave her a space to repent th Ty age was the Dark Age the dark horse rider rode in that time when all the masses and everything had to be paid for and the prayers and and the novenas and so forth now see his black horse then after he refused to repent in thra what changes his riding from a black horse to a pale one death or his last Ministry I might just give the individual a little Shake here to refuse God to refuse God's call you'll do it the last time sometime and just like that church did it's over God patience will not always strive with man see and when she refused it and refused to accept it then she changed and went and now she's got a name called Death separation God said I'll even take her children the Protestants and every one of them I'll kill with eternal separation there you are Age The Dark Age black horse now turns to death for his last Ministry see how the church ages blend in with the seals it's perfect and we know it's try the holy spirit makes no mistake he gave us a greater Vindication the last time when we got the church ages down back there you know [Music] h [Music]

power shall thy enemies submit themselves unto thee Earthship sing come and see the works of God he is terrible in his doing toward the Children of Men He ruleth by his power forever for his eyes behold the Nations let not the rebellious exalt themselves say bless God and make the voice of his praise be heard which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be moved thou broughtest us into the net thou laid us Affliction Upon Our loins I will go into thy house with burnt offerings I will pay thee my vows I will offer unto the burnt sacrifice of fatlings with the increase of rams I will offer Bullocks with goats C my soul I Cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue but verily God hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer blessed be God which has not turned away my prayer nor his Mercy from me amen your grace and mercy followed me carried me hunted me down and it found me I thank God for it amen we like to take a scripture found in Revelations chapter 5 we've been in there for a little bit and just can't um move from it right now in Revelations chapter 5 will'll turn take a few verses there we have you seated verse number one through 4 when you have that you can say amen and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is was worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon amen we will ask God's blessings the reading of his word um father we ask your blessings as we read your holy word word father we pray that you now would take the service into your care and bless each one we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated title of the message this morning the most Sublime thing in scripture the most Sublime thing in scripture is what is just taking place in Revelations chapter 5 we have taken this scripture and we read and if you continue reading on in verse number five and then eight down through verse 14 you see this is a tremendous happening taking place why is the Elder John weeping why is he so moved that he wept because no man can open this book what kind of book was in it what kind of book was it and what was in it that would cause the Apostle to be so overwhelmed that he wept much because no man was worthy to even look at this book and we know that this book was a complete Plan of Redemption we know that this book held names in it and the whole uh Recon ilation of sin would be dealt with once a kinsman redeemer was found worthy enough to take this book and to loose the seals and to open them and so we are grateful and thankful that we know what day and time of the week it is we know that we are in not the sixth Church age not the fifth Church age but we're in the seventh Church age and the scripture says in Revelations 10 1-7 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound what else does it say The Mysteries of God should be what finished if brother brandom is not the seventh angel then tell me who is and if he is not the seventh angel you better find one that can fulfill this scripture that's right somebody has to fit that role and it's so easy to say what's not what's not what's not what are we going to replace it with let's take some of the greatest men and Minds that we known in the Pentecostal movement let's take the Reverend Oral Roberts phenomenal Ministry worldwide Ministry outlived his life and his ministry is still carrying on those that hold his Theology and that position can we say that or Roberts would fit that scripture to reveal the Mysteries that were supposed to be revealed can we say that with an honest face would it be the Reverend Billy Graham would it be any of the Pentecostal fathers even the great FF Bosworth great man or uh Smith Wigglesworth or even the little brother the oneeyed black man in isus that brought that original Pentecostal move the Reverend William Seymour would he fulfill Revelations 10:7 who is it who could it be um um the great evangelists is of our day the ones that have come and gone and so let's fast forward today do we have somebody today would it the Bishop TD Jake how about our friend uh Joel ostein he's just a friendly guy I have to call him a friend he looks like a nice guy I've had so many customers tell me they would love to go to his church I know a Greek or Orthodox attorney said he went all the way to Dallas or Houston wherever he is and he had to go to brother olin's church he don't even believe like that but would it be the the Reverend Joel ostein F find a minister find one just pick one so so so I want to Value what you're following so when I stand up here and I'm reading the quotations of the Reverend William brandham I'm G to be reading from somebody and so are you it might be Fox News it might be something you heard out there and that's what you're you got it all figured out and you have something that you have to Center Your Truth around and I thank God that that question has been answer for me and I don't want to be obnoxious to those who don't have that answer but this is my answer the Reverend William brandham fulfills this scripture in Revelations 10:7 one that would come to reveal the Mysteries as contained throughout the entire Bible That's Right amen and so brothers and sisters be encouraged we have nothing to be ashamed of we have nothing to hide or put our head down because God has done a marvelous thing and opening up his word to us and that's what I'm here on this particular message here the most Sublime thing in the scripture we took of course a couple of services on this Hebrew servant that in in the Commonwealth of Israel so that none would be broke or lose it all the Lord had a year of release he released them from their creditors and their debt it was a law that God established so that you just came out of Egypt you're not going to handle one another the way the Egyptians handled you so after seven years you've been bound you owe this money at the year release comes I'll blow the trumpet the priest will blow the trumpet and then when you hear the sound of the trumpet it's a sign that you can go free it's a great reset we're going to reset you messed up bad investment did something wrong you lost this you fondled that but now you're in bondage for seven years and when the trumpet sounds you can go free brother banam we went through the scriptures and the quotes on that brother banham brings the type to us for today that we hear the gospel trumpet and when that gospel trumpet we hear it through our ear right and once you hear that not everybody can hear it some people can be in range of it and still not hear it but how many remember when you heard it you had to move didn't you you had to get up even if it drugg you to the altar you had to come forward because something was calling your name it's a very pivotable point in your life very memorable you don't have to make it up have this not something you're trying to make up this is what happened to me I was going this way and then I Heard a Voice and he turned my heart this way that will always be with me you know on you hear the death of saints many Saints dying they'll and they start to lose their faculties their memory they'll forget their wives name they'll forget their children's name they'll forget many things but some of the last things things they they will never forget are the old hymns they'll never forget the name Jesus it's a beautiful thing because it's a it's a happening that stays with you when you hear that gospel trumpet it's you know I've been you know preaching over 30 years now I've sat under seven different pastors over the years and like I said I tease all the time I don't look that old but I've been around a little bit I'm going stop teasing that way because then I might start looking old too but I've been around for a little bit and I've seen a lot of things go on and take place over the years but when I start talking about those early years of the Lord calling me it just moves me brother Bobby because I remember what I used to be and how he turned me over to here that is the gospel trumpet that's the hearing of the word of Truth and that old Hebrew servant now he has to make a decision and the decision is would you like to continue on with your master they've been good to you they feed you well he's a good boss or would you like to go free now when he makes this decision to stay with his master he's got to go to the priest there must be a witness and he's got to say it from his mouth I love my master I want to stay and you know the master can make it look convenient make it seem you know cool or the nice thing to do but once he makes that decision he can never go free again it's a GameChanger for the rest of his life from this day on forward if he stays with that Master no matter what no matter what other trumpet sound no matter other folks that are in the the agreement with the master they might go free you can never go free and they take that all pierce it through the earlobe of his ear because that's where he heard the trumpet and he made the decision to stay permanent and so we see that this gospel trumpet is the announcing or the proclamation that you can go free now this this Proclamation it's written all through your Bible we can talk about you being free for our Salvation we could talk about your healing we can talk about any Redemptive blessing you need the Peace of Mind the peace of God your family needs to be saved you find that in the word and that sounds to you you can have that and you know uh this great happening that happened here in um Revelations chapter 5 brother vandom makes makes that statement he said it's the most Sublime thing in the scripture so let's look at it just for a moment in Revelations chapter 5 here the great Apostle is weeping he's emotional this is not a nothing this is a something that causes him to to to recognize that even all the Angelic host in heaven they can't open the book good men like job and Daniel and Joseph great men who had tremendous testimony like Ezra and Nehemiah some of the great prophets throughout the ages couldn't open this book men better than you and I great men men that the angel of the Lord came to men that show that was shown God's glory men like Moses men like David that had a heart after God the great tremendous man throughout the entire Bible were not worthy to open this book and John wept now in verse number five the scripture goes and says this and one of the elders Sith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and behold and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne so here John in the great vision the Lord's showing them these things he's weeping no man's worthy then the Elder tells to stop weeping the lion has prevailed and when he hears that the lion has prevailed and he turns and he went to to go look and see and he says in the midst of the throne here arises a lamb a bloody lamb that was slain now we can get a kind of a visual of what's taking place we can see uh uh Calvary we can see the Old Testament land that was slain that something now is being redeemed a price is being paid and now the lamb comes forth out of the midst of the throne and he takes this book it's it's so Sublime if you're a Christian today this is what happened to you this is your experience this is your testimony as I've been sharing with the church here on the Wednesday night conduct order and Doctrine and under the conduct I was just sharing it with the church and I quoted it last uh yesterday evening that we as Believers on the outward motion one of the greatest single outward things that we can identify that God is dealing with someone as we watch How often they come to the house of the Lord particularly newcomers I I've gone to visit different places and you'll see a new face in the place and you'll ask about them oh this brother I used to work with them he finally decide to come to church first thing I'd ask how long has he been coming oh he's been coming for like two months now he hasn't missed the service and it's likeing okay God's dealing with him something's going on there it's not everything but it is something and it's just an outward identification that you can say something something is happening in this young lady's life or this young man's life and I started to meditate on that even more and I started to think of what would be one of the greatest things that a Believer has from his very birthday at the altar wherever it is and coming to Christ up till today what would be the greatest um relationship what would be the greatest constant thing that we do as Believers that helps to keep us clean and I can't think of anything greater than repentance the ability to repent and find Grace when you messed up what if that was taken from us today what if from today no more mistake your repenting is over this is your last chance to repent today after this if you messed up you're out of here well all of us just need to quit right there we wouldn't even step out of this building huh because repentance is the single greatest thing that a man I don't care how long he's been in church how how new he is to church he'll always be finding grace and mercy Lord forgive me I'm messed up I'm wrong I'm not where I should be my mind isn't right I got a bad attitude I didn't handle that Lord forgive me I'm sorry how many know what I'm talking about is that valuable to you or not oh my think of it think if we couldn't have that but he has provided that for us the reason I can preach this morning is because I repented this morning the reason you can come and worship this morning because there's blood on the throne there's Mercy on the throne the reason those of you that can dance in the spirit You Can Dance because of his Mercy because of his grace I can worship God I can read my Bible I can say Amen to the word I can go forward with God because of repentance amen I'm so glad about it and this lamb removes himself or appears and comes forth out of the throne look at verse number eight and when he had taken the book and the four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps golden vows full of the odors which are the prayers of the Saints what did they do they sung a new song saying what Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy one of them songs right Thou Art Worthy oh Lord Amen to receive Glory blessings and honor they sang this song and he says for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth and behold and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands there's a lot of people here now saying with the loud voice do you think that was like our praise service today you think they looking around see who ain't praising him is there a worship leader saying y'all stand up and help me praise the Lord was there somebody else pushing them along helping them to appreciate what's taking place no no no them seats stayed here on the Earth but the real worshipper showed up here in Revelations 5 and when it saw the lamb take the book and see that the book was taken and the seals can be open now and now we can be saved now oh mighty begin to praise and worship the Lord and that's what we come here to do today praise and worship him saying with the very low message Voice verse 12 we need to rewrite our Bibles Revelations chap 12 I can't hear some of y'all praise the Lord said well brother Israel uh loud is a relative term I am very loud if you yeah but like brother juel for said I've watched the prices right and it ain't just black people praising the Lord on Price is Right is that excuse like we like to use sometime you know blacks whites all of them jumping up running up and down because they want a new car or whatever and so saying with the loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and so what's John doing in re rations chap 13 Revelations 5:13 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard who heard I this is John the Apostle saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sited upon the throne anathan the lamb forever and ever and the 4B said amen and the 420 Elders fell down and worship him that liveth forever and ever so John wasn't a spectator but every creature in heaven heard him every creature on the earth heard him and everything under the Earth heard I John giving praises to the lamb so this is a tremendous event wouldn't you say so something tremendous is happening here so if repentance would be one of the greater things that a Believer must develop to be a believer you have to be able to repent it's it comes before water baptism right is repentance repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if repentance is one of the greatest things one of the worst things is for you not to repent or to move forward in your journey with unconfessed sins brother randam deals with this repentance he says if you thoroughly repent and you're properly taught the moment you're baptized the Holy Ghost should come upon you and you should be filled with the Holy Ghost that's what he said so the onus is on the teaching and the hus is upon those who are coming that they thoroughly repent now it doesn't happen all that way many of us repent we come to the Lord It's A year later six months later two years later I knew one Pastor or Minister told me it took him 10 years before the Lord filled him with the Holy Ghost and um that's a long time right but when you thoroughly repent and now now you can move on with the things that the Lord has for you those promises that he has for you so in the message Easter seal brother random says this here in paragraph number 107 God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end of time but you see you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against it has be stricken off and you got the abstract to it you got the seal it's yours everything is on it be Belongs to You amen and when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sends down the abstract and the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you you thoroughly repent Hallelujah and the property is boughten and you hold the abstract for the Assurance let somebody try to put you off the land and say he belongs and you you with the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't a law in the land can do it because you hold the abstract and there's no devil no church or any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have already raised in him amen the old things what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion changes our Notions it sets our affection on things which are above and smoking drinking gas gambling the things you used to do is dead it's beneath you how many can say praise the Lord so we see as I said this happens to the believer even to today the believer that comes to Christ we see this lamb coming forth I'm going to take this in the message to breach I'll be in here just for a moment and then I'll come back to these quotes in paragraph number 200 in the breach brother says this he's talking about this great event that took place with John he has this Vision he sees it taking place the Weeping the lion and then the lamb takes the book and everybody begins to praise and worship now here the Lord is leading brother brandom here and he says here in paragraph number 200 oh would not it be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you so let me ask you where does Revelations come from when God reveals truth to you where does that come from we know the lamb is on the throne uh as a mediator for our sin sin God looks through him and the entire Earth is being held off from major judgment because of the Lamb there's still Mercy On The Mercy Seat can I get a witness there's still Blood on the throne Mercy is not over it's still there but when the Revelation comes to you who's giving you that Revelation well Jesus said if a man would would um um um open their heart he said he would come and suck with them and he would not leave you comfortless so he'll send the Holy Ghost to that believer he personally identifies himself with the the new disciple it's Jesus himself it's not an angel it's not one of his Representatives it's not somebody in his place but it's Christ himself making himself known to the individual ual I can't I can't think of how beautiful that is the words to express how beautiful that is when a man comes to Christ that's who he's coming to and when something touches his heart that's the Lord Jesus touching his heart he say Lord come into my heart that is him the Lord Of Glory coming into your heart and when he changes your mind and gives you truth and gives you a revelation that is him the Lord Jesus giv giving you truth giving you a revelation and when your sinful thoughts can go away from you and you repent of your sins he'll come from Glory down to the believer down to to sou Arizona he'll come to your neighborhood he'll come to your prison cell he'll come to your bedside in the hospital he'll come when you call him to come he'll leave from glory to come down and make himself known to the individual and who is it it's the Lamb of God Amen I love that don't you I read that one more time oh wouldn't it be a glorious thing if our sinful thoughts tonight could be laid aside long enough to accept him he would Advance all the way from Glory tonight to make himself known to any of you now that's what we need that's what this church needs that's what our ministers need that's what the pastors need that's what all believers need is this lamb to come to us individually now this repenting such a key part of our life in our walk not only do we repent to God how many you know we got to look sometimes brothers and sisters in the face you say I'm wrong I'm sorry I have some fired up amens on that first part saying Lord I'm sorry I was wrong we can all identifi that's easy Lord because it's Lord I'm sorry I'm wrong but look eyeball to eyeball with sister or brother and even deeper than that sinner folks people who don't know nothing about the word you got to go tell them you was wrong if they're not obligated to tell you you are obligated as a Believer because you don't want these sins over your life you don't want to live a life with all of these loose issues and problems and I and I and it's true there's some people that had a hard time saying I was wrong I messed up they say I was wrong but yeah you started it anyways remember that I was wrong but if you would have been nicer I wouldn't have reacted that way stop go back stop it you was wrong period oh that's hard right now I can feel it I can feel the rub yeah feel it who in here wasn't wrong that's right nobody can pick that book up nobody was worthy there was only one that was worthy to hold the book that can declare and bring Kinsman and Redeemer and that was the Lamb of God he's the only one that never did no wrong some of y'all need to make it right the way you looking at me that's all right I'm not gonna wait for you to say sorry I forgive you anyways you know I'm teasing all right God bless you this repenting is not only with God it's with individuals it's with other people it's a it's a way of life the reason why we can repent is because Revelations 5 a lamb came up out of the midst of the throne the reason why we can say I'm sorry because the lamb came up out of the throne because of Calvary we can make things right in our life amen amen now brother bam continues in this message on the wings of a snow white dove he says this in paragraph 299 now the Lord can show me a vision he could tell me what's the matter with e each one of them I can prove that to you see you know that but that don't heal them that doesn't heal them no it's got to be something dropped in them see and I hope like I could go up here and take each one of you and baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that won't remit your sins no no no I don't believe in water baptism in the name of of Jesus Christ unto regeneration I believe the blood is regeneration see not the water but you see I could baptize and baptize but you only go down a dry Center come up a wet one see only you have thoroughly until you have thoroughly repented repent and then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and that's why I differ with the Oneness movement not baptizing to Regeneration no I believe it's the blood that cleanses not the water see repentance then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ brother ROM continues Revelations chapter 4 number three 1961 the prophet says this by faith were walking Grace what did what God did for you that's right you believe God you believe on God and as soon as you're sorry you're already forgiven excuse me this is one of my favorite quotes I had this for years and years and then last year or so I was trying to find it and I was coming back through this message again I found this one here where brother bam it's really breaking this down I think this is really good paragraph 180 by faith you are walk in Grace what God did for you that's right you believe God you believe on God and as soon as you are sorry you're already forgiven I was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of got a little mixed up on it and I said look brother if you said something to hurt your wife's feeling immediately you'll feel sorry for her you're sorry you did it you're all already repented in your heart that's right but you've got to go tell her about it you got to go say honey I'm sorry I said that then you what so part of the repentance is feeling sorry in your heart and many people well you they know I feel bad about it they know I'm feel sorry in my heart that's only part of it you have to go and say those words go to her go to him you got to go and say honey I'm sorry I said that then you've thoroughly repented now that's the way it is with God a man that would go and say I hurt her feelings don't make any difference I'll tell her I'm sorry but really I'm not you're a hypocrite see that's right that will never be received by God well I said I was sorry but if it's not in your heart you've got to thoroughly be sorry for your sins then when you know that you're sorry for your sins and then repentance and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive forgiveness receive the Holy Ghost see just simple God has made it so simple amen so Prophet go continues in the message of God be with us then we're are all the Miracles paragraph number 193 now if there's any of you got duck nature you got a great big pool back here see if you can smell if you got a whiff that God remains God if you got a whiff from Heaven tonight the God keeps his word and he's a miracle working God you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet smell the water the first thing he said do certainly repent from the bottom of your heart and lay yourself as a sacrifice Christ on the Altar and you will be consumed of the world and Born Again of the spirit and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost go through the right process not come shake hands with the preacher or put your name on the book but die so dead that you don't know the world no more so this is part of the issue with um those that don't receive the Holy Ghost is the repentance part not thoroughly repenting halfway repenting maybe just coming through some of the emotions of it but the Lord is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins if we confess them is that right if we say we have no sins we're not telling the truth it's a lie the scriptures tell us that in 1 John 1 and8 if we say we have no sin we deceive who ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so this uh sins the sins that we have we all have them but we can get rid of those sins by confession it's through repentance that we do that now the trouble with the unconfessed sins is it becomes iniquity when we know that we should make it right but we don't and we can live years and and live seasons of our life with this unconfessed sin hanging over us but you know it's God's grace and mercy that he doesn't uh uh uh call us with that sin on us he he shows us grace and mercy and gives us the opportunity to repent God is not going to repent for you you have to repent for yourself God will lead you to repentance he'll make it available for you to repent the price is paid for your repentance and he will make you uh understand and aware that you need to repent but he's not going to repent on your behalf repentance comes from the individual I am sorry Lord I um transgress your laws and I want to be made back whole again I want to come back into your fellowship and the fellowship of your word and The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit one and number two when we come to Christ and we rep rep of our sins and we're baptized in water and Christian baptism that's the first part the next part is we're to receive the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is not going to come upon us if we didn't thoroughly repent is that right Saints we read that for you it's very clear that we can um believe that God will uh uh fill those with the Holy Ghost that repent of their sins thoroughly repent and they're baptized and they receive the Holy Ghost now how many of you receive the Holy Ghost as soon as you were baptized a quick show of hands one hand couple hands there two yeah few hands it's beautiful my junior sister she had an experience of the Lord my youngest sister Kimberly um we had been going to church for years we bring her to church for the first time she really repented she came into the baptistry there she baptized her she came out of the water speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost just filled her so full I would have loved that to happen to me but then it take it took a minute for me it took more than a minute I should say it took a while and it takes a while for a lot of us is that right that's part of the experience it's not an indictment on our faith it's just we have to thoroughly repent sometimes we need more information in the word we need more you know you know Clarity of what's really going on and then you have that moment yeah your heart is right it's fully repented and then he fills you with the precious Holy Ghost that's for the church today we're not just coming to baptize people in water that's part of it but we want to see them filled with the Holy Ghost is that right Saints and he won't F an unclean vessel so sanctification by the blood as you be as you begin to thoroughly repent through the blood the blood is sanctifying you through the word of God the the word has blood on it it's judgment but forgiveness judgment but forgiveness judgment but forgi you're wrong but make it right you're wrong now get it right and that's what the word is and you get your heart right and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost and after you're filled with the Holy Ghost you don't stop your repenting it's a continual work right Saints Paul said I Die daily what I want to do the bad man wants to do wrong and the good man wants to do to to do good and I find this war in me great Apostle this war in me this sticky nature that when I would go do good evil is always present how many he knows what he's talking about being very transparent none of us are in here without a sticky nature none of us are in here where we didn't have to say Lord have mercy on me forgive me this morning not for what I did last week I'm talking about this morning forgive me for all of my sins make me that I can approach your throne of grace and mercy today amen can I take a few more moments yes so we all know this testimony of that little woman that um it's in the message 1953 that um she had an unconfessed sin in her life I want to play a portion of that what brother random said about it is that okay all right and that's in the message I think you got it back there sis it's about 7 minutes a portion of the tape just a little background she was a Sunday school teacher she was in or 30 or 32 years old the prophet of God said she um was so distraught in her mental that she was getting treatment every other week and taking medications to try to get over this trouble and problem and the pastor that invited brother Bram I think it was in New Albany I think he'll mention the church there invited him to come preach and when he went to go preach for them this little lady needed prayer she was a Sunday school teacher and so brother RNA prayed for her the pastor had already promised brother vam we're not going to have you praying for the people just come to preach to us when this lady come through he said I'm sorry brother brandom can you just pray for her so he prayed for this little lady and a few days later him and sister brandom see her walking down the street with another sister and she's just rolling her hands like this nervous as can be brother bam says I went up to her I asked her are things getting better she says no they're actually getting worse did you pray for me so he prayed for her again on the street there and then he said that this lady and sister brandham became friends and she told sister ma when that anointing is on brother brandham could you call me and have me come because I feel like if the anointing is on him he can find out what my problem problem is brother V Master did is there any unconfessed sin no everything is cleared up I'm a Sunday school teacher is there anything wrong no everything is clear and so he said one morning he was under the impact of a tremendous Vision he says in this tape go back and hear it yourself and after that that the angel had left but the anointing was still there sister brandham came to him and says honey is the Angel still near and he said yes so can I call that woman from New Albany she's got these kids and she really needs an answer so here brother Brams prayed for her twice gifted anointed didn't catch it couldn't see what was going on and here we are to this point where he finally gets her to come back to his home after the impact of a vision God's grace the anointing still on him and this is what unfolds this is in the message What's the title of that sis let me yeah do you now believe 1953 we'll play that paragraph 45 through paragraph number I gave it to you back there that's now one had told her here it come again the vision broke and I seen it with a blonde headed man and she was riding fast in the car and a automobile was going and a train just barely missed him and she started screaming I could hear her but I I still in the vision and She fainted and fell in the floor and here was the vision she was gotten married just before the W and young girl and her husband went overseas and when he went overseas she started getting Lonesome and she started having company with a blond-headed boy and one night being out she broke her marriage bow and lived untrue to her husband on the road in the train almost stuck him and killed him and then when my wife heard her scream and so she come into the room we got her up she began to scream said oh brother bom don't you tell that to nobody don't you tell that to nobody I said there you are sister I said unconfessed sin she said well I had you had all different people come nor nor and pray for and stop devils and kick devils and everything else but he stayed right there I said and he'll stay right there as long as you got that unconfessed he said brother bom I confessed that to God I said it wasn't God you sinned against it was your husband you got to make that right she said oh break up my home I said that's all I can say lady there is the cause and until you make that right you'll never get any better that's way back she said I don't even think of that I said no you don't but your subconscious is thinking of that all the time now I said no psychiatrist could pull that out of you now I said you know that there's nobody in the world know that but you and that man alone I said God's holy spirit has revealed to you and told you where your trouble is now you go make that right with your husband and then you'll get well she said I can't do to break up our home brother brand she started crying said sister brand don't you let him tell nobody that like that I said now my wife said well he don't tell things like that sister said you know he wouldn't do that and she said oh my husband he would he would leave me right now and said he break up my home what happen with my little children and so forth and I said look sister first CLE yourself with God God will take care of the rest of it so she said well I just can't do it brother B I said of course that's all I can do sister I've just done what God told me to do there's your trouble I said they anoint you at all every five minutes to the day for the rest of your life it'll never do you any good I said they might lay their hands on you and stalk and kick devils and said get out of here sat you don't you don't have to hard at him he knows what faith is he knows what what your life is so there's no need of you trying to bless him he'll stay right there and got a right to stay there as he knows what his rights is what he can do and what he can and she said well I just can't do it I started to walk when she started crying I look back and standing by her side stood another man in a vision I said is your husband a type of call man yes he has black hair yes hes it over sideway kindy W yes I said he's a deacon in that church yes I said he's got the same rockness to confess to you I said when he landed in France told about a girl with I said that he's working doesn't he work for a chiet company said yes he does I said there's a lady Works in there it's blackheaded in the office I said he was in a green chevret car and he was out in a lane at a certain place with that woman she's wearing a pain dress no more than day before yesterday you got the same thing to confess why she said not my husband he's the beacon I said no wonder whether Johnson can't get nowh down there I said such is that your church that's right that's what the whole lot of a lot of churches too God will never bless over sin and I said you go get your she said my husband wouldn't I said all right that's all I know now I said you go get your husband and make that thing right and you all get your eyes straightened up then God will be with you well I went on in to see another person then when I come back me she went in called her husband on the phone and they other ladies com and they went and met my wife said do you think they'll come back I said sure he'll be nice so it hadn't been a little while my wife said look coming up the steps here come with their arms around one another just a cry the tears running down their cheek open the door and I said what about it he said brother bam said my wife called me and got in the car and said she come confessing to me that a wrong that she had did and then said she come and accuse me of the same thing and I asked said where are you being and then and then said I is the truth brother Brandon said I don't know you I've heard of you my brother John and said I've never seen you but I want to shake your hand and say it's an absolutely truth and I'm guilty and no good to be called a father of my children or a deacon in that church and as soon as I can get brother Johnson I'll resign from my job I said don't do that just get right with God and continue with your job I said no need to doing that he said oh God would forgive me I said sure he forgive you have you confessed to your wife and asked her to forgive you you all forgive one another yes I said now sit down Now's the Time then when I went down and said Heavenly Father this demon has tormented this girl for all these years has no legal rights to hold her now the PA has done been found and made right now come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and she's perfectly normal and well from that time on see see what is it it goes slow but we get the call see what it means Visions that's the reason some of you send me letters and say brother Roberts will pray for 500 while I'm praying for two God's brother Roberts is praying for people way God told him to do it I'm doing the way God told me to do so it's just slow but I I want to know what I'm doing and before I condemn a satanic spirit and so forth I want to know first whether that's in God's legal plan it is God as brother BOS says Jesus died for everyone that's right then if you're living in above that reproach and doing right then Satan has to turn loose of you but if there's anything back behind there maybe something that you ought to have done maybe you're living clean and pure but God told you something to do you need let you do it god holds that right on you until you go back and make that thing right again whether there something you should have done or should not have done you see what I mean amen how me thank God for his word now that's the word of the Lord um I can't go on and finish this message this morning wanted to get into the sublime part of the scripture but because of Revelations 5 it makes this happening all possible this lady was living with UNC confess sin but forgiveness was there for her but it was on her to confess it once she confessed it God forgave her and when God forgave her he healed her and not only healed her it brought out an unconfessed sin for this Deacon in a church and this Deacon was in a church as a deacon living with this unconfessed sin this Sunday school teacher is living in the same church with unconfessed sin and brother bam says no wonder why they're having so much problems in that church but look at what look what the confession will do he wants to resign his job as a deacon and brother ROM says don't do that just get right with God isn't that what we're isn't that what we're here isn't that what the believer is trying to do is trying to get right with God so that we can be approached or approach his throne of grace and mercy and Revelations chapter 5 makes this available to us I'll read one portion of the scripture on that and then I'll try to finish it tonight is that okay all right now in the message the most in the in the message the breach it's in paragraph let's see if I can find it here quickly paragraph 238 so we covered a lot of ground this morning I mean there's a lot of folks a lot of saints in here that's been baptized and they haven't received the Holy Ghost or they don't know whether they have or not I don't believe God wants us to live with a question mark over our faith like I think I received to that camp I think I might have no he'll give you the assurance that you have it so like the people in the Bible can say exactly what the Lord did for them I repented and yes I have received the Holy Ghost doesn't mean I'm sinless doesn't mean I won't ever make a mistake but this is what happened to me and that becomes your testimony we have so many question marks because you know we're raised in the truth of the word so there isn't that you know we was was in a false church and then we finally come to a new church and that was our starting point and then the newness of life and all those things to pinpoint many of us come up in our in our cradle knowing seeing a picture like that from the cradle up you've been hearing the truth all the time and it's hard to find those points and I'm not an expert on any of it I know God keeps his word though and if you repent of your sins and you get baptized in jesus' name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said You shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and any true Ministry or any true church is going to point you to that you must be born again little ones big ones brown ones nice ones me you have to be born again every one of us and the Lord makes that known he leaves from glory to make that known to you aren't you glad about that let me read this quote here in paragraph number 238 prophet of God says this in the message to breach notice let see notice he's not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne who was it the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right can No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand who what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture amen an act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that set upon the throne paragraph 234 243 just drop down a little oh who is waiting for me tonight he's asking who's waiting for me tonight who is that one church that's waiting there what else could wait there for you that kinsman redeemer oh my what a Sublime statement or act so Saints this this is I I if if our hearts aren't repented today we can't have a real church service we can't even be a real believer and that's the truth brother bam talks about a church that would thoroughly a church that's thoroughly repented and that would pray to God all the time he said they would have a Revival God couldn't keep it from happening I mean you couldn't keep it from happening let's take a few scriptures Romans 4 1-8 what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh ha found for Abraham If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to Glory but not before God for what sayith the scripture Abraham believed God and it was counted unto him for righteousness now him that worketh not now to him that worketh is a reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness even as David also described the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputed God imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered bless blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin Hebrews 8:12 for if I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more Hebrews 10 11-1 17 the scripture says verse 13 from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more see this is what the blood brings us to we thank God for it don't you that that came to Jesus in Matthew chapter 9 and verse number one he entered into a ship he passed and came into his own City and behold there brought to him a man sick of the py laying on a bed and Jesus seeing their faith saith unto him that was sick of the py son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemed and Jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts for wither is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk but that you may know that the son of man have power on Earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the py arise take up thy bed and go unto thy house so we know that forgiveness and sins Lays in him who took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne he came forth as the bleedy bloody lamb and he is the reason why we can find forgiveness today and not just today but for every day you need that forgiveness in your life we need it every day we thank God for it and his our sins and our iniquities he will remember no more it's Sublime Saints it's beautiful and we thank God for it so God bless you richly let us pray father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you Lord that we can Minister on the power of forgiveness and the power of the blood and Lord that we can not just come and ins spectate but Lord we can actually find Grace and Lord the sobering thoughts of being a sinner and then becoming a saint oh how tremendous that is a few moments maybe on the altar a confession that is made and you receive that and we leave from off of our knees The Sinner and now we've been made the righteousness of God it's it's hearing the word of faith and then responding to that word and we can find Grace it's so beautiful we everyone Lord have experienced that but Lord we see the danger of Christians and even deacons and teachers and preachers can fall into this trap of living a life of unconfessed sins and through the teaching of the message of the hour we can see Lord that we actually can sin against one another and we have to make that right with one another before we can be made right with you oh it's so Sublime though that if I'm still conscious today if I'm still breathing today there's still a chance for me to make all my wrongs right I can ask for forgiveness today and you are faithful and you're just to forgive any man any woman of any sin they've committed Lord there's nobody like you Lord you're worthy to be praised Lord we commit Our Lives to you father what would I do without you how can I preach without you how can we serve without you lord your grace and your mercy has made a way for us to come into your presence we see this tremendous happening in Revelations chapter 5 you opening the book of redemption and making a way for us to come back again Lord we're eternally grateful it'll never get old we'll never remove it out of our songs we'll never stop preaching about it Lord we're so glad about it we will always exalt you the lamb that took away the sins of many Lord if there be somebody here today that has been baptized but they have not received the Holy Ghost or they're not aware of the whether they have it or not they're kind of maybe sure and it needs they need a happening they need a tie poost Lord I pray that you'll reveal that to them today I know these uh little burdens and these little happenings are not for nothing Lord it was spoken for a purpose is it was spoken for somebody that's hearing it today and I pray Lord Jesus that you'll uh settle it down in their heart and in their faith and Lord and bring them to that place where they can receive the Holy Ghost not to just be baptized but to receive the Holy Ghost in their life repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and unto your children and unto them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and Lord as you're calling today may you call each one to repentance a thorough repentance and Lord that they would come in and receive the Holy Ghost that's what our church needs that's what we need Lord Lord that's what I need Lord every one of us need that and there's something hindering that that is not a thorough repentance Lord reveal it and help us to come clean with that and move forward and as this Deacon and this Sunday school teacher found Grace it's because of you that they can find Grace and and whoever's here today can find Grace too we thank you for it Lord You're are the most Sublime thing this is the most Sublime thing in the scriptures and we thank you for it in Jesus name we love you amen amen oh my praise the Lord amen God's word is true and I'm so glad that I can preach it and declare it the more the shest thing I've
