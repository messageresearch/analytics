[7:24] Once like a bird in prison I dwelt.
[7:30] No freedom from the sorrow I felt.
[7:35] But Jesus came and listened to me.
[7:41] Glory to God. He set me free.
[7:47] He set me free. Yes. He set me free.
[7:53] He broke the bonds of prison for me.
[7:59] I'm glory bound, my Jesus to see.
[8:04] Glory to God. He set me free.
[8:10] Now I am climbing
[8:13] higher each day.
[8:16] Darkness of night has drifted away.
[8:22] My feet are planted
[8:25] on higher ground.
[8:28] Glory to God. I'm home bound.
[8:33] He set me free and he set me free.
[8:39] Behold the bonds of prison for me.
[8:45] I'm glory bound by Jesus to see.
[8:51] Glory be to God. He set me free.
[8:56] Could come to sin and things that come.

[9:11] I'm praying to you. And glory to God,
[9:16] I'm going through. He set me free. And
[9:22] he set me free.
[9:25] He pulled the bonds of prison for me.
[9:33] My Jesus, you see.
[9:37] Glory to God. He set me free. Oh, he set
[9:43] me free. Yes, he set me free.
[9:48] He wants a prison for me.

[11:33] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[11:39] would not be denied.

[11:51] would not hear my prayers.

[22:45] help, Lord, that you'd guide him through
[22:48] these things and bring them forth whole,

[22:57] Clarissa, Father, Lord, it's just a
[23:00] small thing for you to do anything,
[23:02] Lord. We pray that fever would break,
[23:04] Lord, after it's done its job in the
[23:07] body, Lord, and she'd be well in the
[23:09] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, for our

[27:22] life
[27:24] pressing my way. Amen. Welcome to the
[27:29] house of the Lord tonight. Amen. God
[27:31] bless each of you richly. Um, how many
[27:34] enjoyed the service this morning? It was
[27:37] a real blessing and we thank the Lord
[27:39] for our brother Joseph. We certainly
[27:41] enjoyed that. God bless him and his
[27:44] travels back home. Back home. Also, um,
[27:48] I misqued those dates in November.
[27:51] They're the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, and
[27:56] um not the 13th. And so that's that
[27:59] veterans just before the Veterans Day
[28:01] weekend. We want to be in prayer for
[28:04] that. Amen.
[28:06] And brother Kim was streaming the
[28:08] service and he caught it and I said,
[28:10] "Well, thank the Lord somebody's
[28:12] listening to the dates."
[28:15] Praise the Lord. So, um
[28:18] um we want to be in prayer for those
[28:20] meetings. And tonight, we have a very
[28:22] special friend to me and to the
[28:25] ministry, uh brother Armando Rivera. And
[28:29] he's from El Salvador,
[28:33] but he's habit habiting habitating in
[28:36] Phoenix and he's pastoring there for a
[28:39] number of years. How many ever been to
[28:41] his church here? Praise be. It's a
[28:45] lively group. Very lovely. Lovely. Easy
[28:49] to worship, easy to preach in. And in
[28:52] his church, the way the Lord blessed
[28:54] them in their neighborhood, they
[28:55] purchased that church. And then the next
[28:58] alley behind them, there's a home that
[29:01] was purchased and made into a
[29:03] restaurant. They call it the Granero,
[29:06] the greenery.
[29:08] And it's for believers. So after the
[29:10] service, Friday nights typically you can
[29:13] go there and it's a full menu. Salmon,
[29:16] steak, hamburgers, takitos.
[29:19] It's a real full-blown. It's just
[29:21] believers and they'll serve you. You've
[29:23] been there, Will. You never been. This
[29:26] is a place to be. And
[29:29] it's easy. Yes. And and they make you
[29:32] feel at home and
[29:33] &gt;&gt; very welcome. And so the Lord put that
[29:36] on their heart because they would after
[29:38] service go to the restaurants and then
[29:40] be parted and you got to deal with the
[29:42] music and the brother that runs it is a
[29:45] bonafide chef. They do a very good job.
[29:48] It's a sight to see and they make you
[29:50] feel at home and welcome there. So maybe
[29:54] I prop I haven't properly introduced you
[29:56] to our brother Armando. We know him well
[30:00] but you got to go to his church. She has
[30:02] services Sundays, Wednesdays, and
[30:05] Fridays.
[30:07] And this Wednesday night, Friday night,
[30:09] and Sunday service crowd is about the
[30:12] same.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; They're all there. Right, Brother
[30:15] Joseph?
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Joseph said, "I was surprised
[30:20] these people come to church during the
[30:22] week." Yeah. So lovely congregation.
[30:26] They love us. They love me. They love
[30:28] our our work. Brother Armando loves our
[30:32] group here. He prays for us.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; And we're one and the same. And so it's
[30:36] a real privilege to have him with us and
[30:38] he's going to take brother back to the
[30:41] airport tomorrow. He's going to take him
[30:43] tonight then to the airport tomorrow. So
[30:45] it worked out. I said, "Well, brother
[30:47] Armando, if you're coming, why don't you
[30:49] speak for us?" Some of his families here
[30:51] with us. That's his dear wife there. God
[30:53] bless you, sister Dola Vendiga.
[30:57] And so without further ado, we'll stand
[30:59] to our feet and we're going to invite
[31:01] our precious brother
[31:04] Armando to take the pull pit
[31:07] and let's sing
[31:09] that hymn. Amazing grace.
[31:13] Amazing
[31:14] [Music]
[31:17] grace,
[31:19] how sweet
[31:22] the sound
[31:25] that sent

[31:42] but now
[31:45] I'm found.
[31:48] Was blind,
[31:50] but now
[31:53] I see.
[31:56] Let's bow our heads as they play that
[31:58] softly. Heavenly Father, we come here
[32:01] tonight, Lord, to honor the great
[32:05] resurrection day you've given to us,
[32:08] Lord. Another day of life. And without
[32:11] you, Lord, we could do nothing.
[32:14] So Lord, we simply just bring our little
[32:16] life to you,
[32:19] &gt;&gt; asking you to pour in us the things that
[32:21] we need to be ready for the rapture and
[32:25] the great body change, the resurrection,
[32:28] the coming of the Lord. I pray, oh God,
[32:31] something to be said to stir our souls
[32:33] and to help us to grow in your grace and
[32:36] your mercy.
[32:38] Bless brother Armando, Lauren, and the
[32:41] ministry here tonight. bless your
[32:43] people. Commit this service into your
[32:46] hands. In Jesus name we pray and we love

[35:45] also uh
[35:47] uh brother Israel. Amen. I think you
[35:50] have a wonderful pastor.
[35:53] great men of God. Amen. And uh his
[35:57] family,
[35:58] &gt;&gt; God bless them. Amen. And uh and the
[36:02] church.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; And and I I I want to say to the to the
[36:07] veterans, to those who have walked in
[36:10] this message for so many years,
[36:13] h it helps me a lot to see you be
[36:18] faithful.
[36:20] uh we find a lot of people kind of you
[36:24] know
[36:26] getting slow or something but it's so
[36:29] wonderful to see those warriors
[36:33] &gt;&gt; for for many years. Amen. They're there
[36:36] standing. You are an inspiration to the
[36:40] new generation.
[36:42] And I can say that for me, you you are
[36:46] an inspiration to me. When sometimes I
[36:49] feel tired, I'm like, "No, no, no, no.
[36:51] It's not possible. There there's my
[36:53] brother over there, my sister over
[36:55] there. This cannot be happening to me. I
[36:57] got to keep going. I got to go." Amen.
[37:00] So, I'm I'm glad to be in the house of
[37:03] the Lord. Amen.
[37:04] And uh so uh we're going to read the
[37:08] word and uh we're going to be reading in
[37:11] Acts 2029. I wrote it in a Spanish if
[37:15] you stand up for to honor the word of
[37:17] God. Amen. and uh
[37:25] Acts 2029.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] For I know this, that after my depart
[37:45] departing
[37:47] shall grievous wolves enter among you,
[37:50] not sparing the flock.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Also your own selves shall men arise
[37:59] speaking perverse things to draw away
[38:02] disciples after them.
[38:06] Therefore, watch
[38:08] and remember
[38:10] that by the space of three years at
[38:12] cease not to warn everyone
[38:16] night and day with tears.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; And uh after that we're going to be
[38:24] reading another scripture. But let us
[38:25] pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you
[38:28] tonight for the opportunity that we have
[38:31] to come into your house, Lord.
[38:33] And we have been taught that this is the
[38:37] place where we come and be in your
[38:40] presence
[38:42] also. Lord, we are taught that this is
[38:45] your house.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; This is the place where we come and
[38:48] worship you, Lord.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; So help us to do that. Help us to
[38:53] surrender ourselves to you, Father. And
[38:57] we thank you for the mercies and how you
[39:00] have been good to us. All the blessings
[39:04] that we have received. And father when
[39:07] we when you look for us, Father, we did
[39:10] not know and we came to you Lord with so
[39:14] many needs and you supplied all of that,
[39:17] Father.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Because no man come and look for you.
[39:22] But father, there is a time
[39:25] where we tested how good you are.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; And now Lord, we look for you. We seek
[39:33] you, Father, because now we understand
[39:36] that your love, Father, is infinite.
[39:40] That you're faithful, Father. Thank you,
[39:43] Lord, for that. And so today, Lord, we
[39:46] give you thanks for everything. and
[39:48] we're asking for your blessings in our
[39:51] lives in the name of our Lord Jesus
[39:53] Christ. Amen.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; I I wrote uh the scripture Acts 20:29,
[40:07] but I want to read the scripture where
[40:09] he says that this church has been bought
[40:12] with the blood.
[40:17] Amen. Unless I I have the I have the
[40:21] wrong.
[40:24] Amen.
[40:28] Amen. So
[40:30] Amen. So that scripture I want to read.
[40:51] Technology sometimes is difficult for
[40:54] me.
[40:57] Amen.
[41:03] Amen.
[41:05] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[41:07] to all the flock,
[41:10] over the which the Holy Ghost hath made
[41:13] you overseers to feed the church of God
[41:17] which he hath purchased with his own
[41:20] blood. Amen. Amen.
[41:24] Uh this is this is the the thing about
[41:28] uh
[41:30] what is in my heart and uh
[41:37] I believe that
[41:40] we we have been brought
[41:44] from a life
[41:46] of sadness,
[41:49] destruction,
[41:52] uh
[41:54] things that are not right.
[41:57] And we we were brought to the gospel
[42:02] and uh through the years I I have
[42:06] understood
[42:08] that the gospel that has been given to
[42:10] us is not
[42:14] any other gospel but the gospel of Jesus
[42:16] Christ.
[42:18] And when I say we were brought to this
[42:21] gospel,
[42:23] it doesn't mean that there are other
[42:25] gospels.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; There is just one.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; But there are so many things around it
[42:34] that people call gospel when there when
[42:36] it is not a gospel.
[42:39] The the gospel is the good news.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are we are here to receive
[42:46] good news
[42:48] &gt;&gt; and to and to tell people that there are
[42:51] good news. Amen.
[42:53] Now we know that there are promises that
[42:56] there are there there are things that
[42:59] were promised to us that the Lord was
[43:02] going to do great things in our lives
[43:05] and that there is a process that we have
[43:08] to go through with this and and one of
[43:11] them is that he he was going to forgive
[43:15] our sins
[43:17] &gt;&gt; that he was going to cleanse us
[43:20] &gt;&gt; and then he was going to give us the
[43:21] Holy Ghost.
[43:24] Amen.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; And then after he has given us the Holy
[43:28] Ghost, what is next?
[43:31] You know, so I want to read this.
[43:34] Brother Brennan says, I I I did not
[43:36] write uh it did not print it the the the
[43:39] message, but then brother Brennan says,
[43:41] "Then our headship is a kingdom.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you." said
[43:50] the Bible,
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus, the kingdom. We are not a
[43:54] denomination.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; We belong to a kingdom.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; And the kingdom is the word of God.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Made spirit and life in our own life.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just a a bunch of people
[44:12] just gather, you know, like without any
[44:16] structure.
[44:18] It's not just a bunch of people just
[44:19] going by the wind or going here and
[44:22] there. No, we this this is a kingdom
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and and and and and we have to recognize
[44:32] that that we are part of this kingdom
[44:35] that that we we have power
[44:38] &gt;&gt; with God.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that this is this is the
[44:43] church of the living God.
[44:49] We what what is there? What what do we
[44:52] wait?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; What what what more is there
[44:57] &gt;&gt; as far as this human life goes? You know
[45:02] that there is nothing there there are
[45:04] things said about this humanity that I'm
[45:08] not going to change.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It's going to be that way.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; I was young and I'm getting old.
[45:16] And I ask God to give me strength, you
[45:19] know, but I know that that there is an
[45:22] appointment
[45:24] &gt;&gt; for this body.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; And I have I I'm not I'm not overwhelmed
[45:30] by that.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; I'm not like what is happening to me?
[45:35] No, it's already written.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; It's it's not like something surprising
[45:42] me.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; No, it's there.
[45:45] And because I am a Christian, it doesn't
[45:48] mean that it's not going to happen to
[45:49] me.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, it seems to me
[45:54] that we put attention to this human
[45:58] affairs
[46:00] &gt;&gt; and it's like it blinds us
[46:03] &gt;&gt; to enjoy
[46:06] the kingdom.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:13] I am happy, brothers and sisters,
[46:15] &gt;&gt; to be a Christian.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I am happy to be in the kingdom of God.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; I am happy that the Lord called me to be
[46:25] in this kingdom.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:30] To be now, not not tomorrow, not in 10
[46:34] years, not in five years, right now.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:42] You know the is it's real.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Uh it's now that we have power.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says everything that was
[46:52] God
[46:55] was poor
[46:57] &gt;&gt; in Jesus.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; And all
[47:04] that was in Jesus
[47:07] &gt;&gt; was poor
[47:09] where
[47:11] in the church.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; So, we're not just anything.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; We're not just a group of people, you
[47:18] know, that come over here and just No,
[47:21] we have a shout
[47:23] &gt;&gt; of victory.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; I have many things to be happy about.
[47:37] I have many things in this kingdom
[47:40] that I am happy about,
[47:44] you know, and and and and and
[47:47] we have to realize
[47:49] that this is it.
[47:53] Now,
[47:55] if you're going to get married, this is
[47:57] it.
[47:59] You you have to know that you have you
[48:02] have a kingdom and there is a king and
[48:05] you therefore are a king yourself.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; He made us kings and priests.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Made us
[48:19] &gt;&gt; no will make us.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; We are right now.
[48:26] If somebody if I do not know who I am or
[48:30] you know or or I have lost you know the
[48:33] sense of of who I am and somebody comes
[48:36] oh brother Armando do you know who you
[48:39] are. So well I just know I am somebody
[48:43] from El Salvador. No, no, no. Wait.
[48:46] Do you know that that last name Rivera
[48:50] that there was a king in Spain,
[48:53] his land, his last name was Rivera?
[48:58] &gt;&gt; And and you should go and trace the last
[49:00] name.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And if I trace and that person says, you
[49:04] know what, you don't have to go into
[49:06] that trouble. I already
[49:09] did it for you.
[49:11] and and you are in that bloodline.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; I'll be like really
[49:18] where is my my part my inheritance?
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; So we we we are in the bloodline of no
[49:29] humanity
[49:31] &gt;&gt; but we are in the bloodline of the King
[49:34] of Kings.
[49:37] Hallelujah.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; But we have to enjoy and realize it
[49:42] &gt;&gt; that when somebody ask who are you?
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I am a Christian.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; You know brothers and sisters I I I uh
[49:58] there is a brother
[50:00] uh that came from the assemblies of God.
[50:03] He was there for 14 12 years ministering
[50:07] and so he came and to be a minister and
[50:10] he came to our church. I baptized him
[50:11] and everything and now you know the
[50:16] his whole
[50:20] setup has been changed.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; You know the the wife is long long
[50:26] skirts everything has changed
[50:28] &gt;&gt; and now he has uh two daughters. One is
[50:32] a uh 16 to be 17 and the other one is
[50:35] like 14 15 and they they the long skirts
[50:39] and they were worried about how are they
[50:41] going to do in a school.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; They what what are we going to do there?
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I said that's where you're going to
[50:48] that's where you're going to show you
[50:49] loyalty.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to be tested now,
[50:57] &gt;&gt; you know. And so the other day uh the
[51:01] brother preached and when he was
[51:03] preaching you know you know when you are
[51:06] preaching you know there are things that
[51:07] come out you know that's why this
[51:09] internet are not so much into that
[51:12] because of you know there are things
[51:14] that people don't understand why you are
[51:16] saying it and they are not in the
[51:18] atmosphere.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; So I invite all my brothers that can
[51:22] come to church to come to church.
[51:26] If you cannot come, that's good. It's
[51:28] okay. I I guess. But if you can come,
[51:32] the scripture says, "Let us go into the
[51:34] house of the Lord."
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So the brother was speaking and he said
[51:41] uh I think that one of the daughters
[51:44] went to him and and and and said, "Dad,
[51:47] they are telling us why do you dress
[51:50] like that?
[51:53] Why do you dress like that?
[51:55] &gt;&gt; And then the that dad, you know, these
[51:58] are people that don't know, you know,
[52:00] they don't they don't know much theology
[52:02] and teaching and but but they believe,
[52:05] you know, what they are taught in the
[52:07] Bible as far as they know it.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; And then he told the daughter, well,
[52:12] this is what you got to answer. I dress
[52:15] like this because I am of Christ.
[52:21] Why do you dress like that? Cuz I belong
[52:23] to Christ.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; There's no more explanation. There's no
[52:28] more I am of Christ. Simple.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Simple but truth.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; So, and I added a little bit in there
[52:40] and I said, "Then you tell that person,
[52:44] I I dress like this because I belong to
[52:46] Christ." To whom do you belong?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing to be a
[52:54] Christian.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; We I enjoy this.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; This is is wonderful.
[53:05] If I get sick, I pray.
[53:09] If disappointment comes, I said, "Lord,
[53:12] I got to get out of this.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know what depression. I
[53:17] don't know the oppression. I don't know
[53:19] any of those things. I don't study them.
[53:21] I don't know what they are. I just know
[53:22] that there are things and I'm like,
[53:24] could it be that I am depressed today?
[53:28] Could it be that thing? You know, I hear
[53:30] so much about it. And I'm like, you know
[53:32] what? Get out of here. You don't belong
[53:35] with me. I I I is so happy. I'm so glad
[53:40] my king came
[53:42] &gt;&gt; and gave me salvation.
[53:46] Hallelujah.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; So, and I, you know, my church, I tell
[53:50] the the my people, you either enjoy it
[53:54] now
[53:55] or what are we doing here?
[53:58] &gt;&gt; This is the house of the Lord.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; And we come here to worship.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:06] Can you say amen?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; I'm watching the clock.
[54:12] Amen. So, this is it. We we were, you
[54:15] know, we
[54:17] we have to enjoy this. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He's good.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; He gave us the Holy Spirit.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; And what else do we need with his power?
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The counselor, the real counselor,
[54:35] not a psychologist, but a a real
[54:39] counselor.
[54:44] Amen.
[54:46] So
[54:49] the scripture
[54:51] is telling us that this church
[54:55] was bought
[54:58] by his own blood.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And brother Brennan tells us we are not
[55:03] bought by anything but the blood of God.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:11] That is a great price, brothers and
[55:13] sisters, that was paid for us.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] The blood of God,
[55:21] &gt;&gt; cleansed you,
[55:23] forgave you,
[55:26] has made you whole,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; has given you direction,
[55:31] has given us purpose to live.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; We know what's coming.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We know what is going on.
[55:40] We know that the changing the changing
[55:42] of this body is coming up.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy
[55:48] what I have.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] So
[56:01] loyal says some of the definitions is to
[56:05] be reliable
[56:07] is to be always true.
[56:11] That's to be loyal.
[56:14] And
[56:17] in in in humanity
[56:19] we appreciate as humans loyalty.
[56:24] Everyone wants somebody loyal.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:41] But let's
[56:43] besides the words and definitions, let
[56:46] us see some examples of what it is to be
[56:50] loyal.
[56:56] an exposition of the church edges
[56:59] church Pergamus
[57:01] the messenger in that area right there.
[57:04] Brother Brennan says
[57:07] just to know about Martin and his mighty
[57:10] ministry might make one think that the
[57:13] persecution of the saints had evaded.
[57:16] Not so. They were still being destroyed
[57:19] by the devil through the instrumentality
[57:22] of the wicked.
[57:23] They were burned at the stake. They were
[57:26] nailed to the logs face down and wild
[57:29] dogs were turned loose upon them so that
[57:33] the dogs will tear away the flesh and
[57:35] bowels, leaving the victims to die in
[57:39] terrible torture.
[57:41] Babes were ripped from expectant mothers
[57:44] and thrown to the hogs. Women Women's
[57:48] breasts were cut away and they were
[57:51] forced to stand erect while each heart
[57:56] throw poured pour out the blood until
[57:59] they crumble in death. And the tragedy
[58:03] was even greater to think about when one
[58:06] realizes that this was not solely to the
[58:10] to the the work of the heathen. But many
[58:13] times it was caused by so-called
[58:16] Christians who felt that they did God a
[58:19] favor and exterminating these loyal
[58:23] soldiers.
[58:30] What is loyalty?
[58:33] Is to maintain
[58:36] to keep
[58:38] &gt;&gt; my position,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; my stand
[58:43] &gt;&gt; until death.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; That's one definition to be loyal.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] is to go all the way down.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; I'm down for it
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and not by force
[59:03] but because there is something in the
[59:05] heart.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:14] I think it was Polycarp
[59:17] that they captured him and he was taken
[59:20] to the stake in the fire and he said,
[59:24] "Don't tie me down.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; You don't need to tie me down."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I'm loyal.
[59:32] I know what it is to be loyal.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; And he was there. He they they did to
[59:39] him evil but he did not run.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He kept his loyalty to his calling.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, loyalty
[59:59] to be loyal.
[1:00:01] The scripture says that in the last
[1:00:03] days, Paul wrote to Timothy, there will
[1:00:06] be people that are going to be disloyal.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And we are living those things today. We
[1:00:14] see them today, brothers and sisters.
[1:00:19] people who run away from the faith,
[1:00:22] people who live, you know, the
[1:00:24] standards,
[1:00:26] people who and the scripture says that
[1:00:29] they that they will go away.
[1:00:32] That's that's a prophecy and it has to
[1:00:35] be fulfilled.
[1:00:36] So we don't have to be worried about
[1:00:38] that.
[1:00:40] It's it's we ourselves. I Lord, I want
[1:00:43] to be loyal to you, Father.
[1:00:47] Amen. So that's one definition of being
[1:00:50] loyal to death.
[1:00:56] What if we take that to the family,
[1:01:01] to the wife and the husband?
[1:01:04] What if we take those things to that
[1:01:06] level?
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be loyal to one
[1:01:10] another
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; no matter the temptation.
[1:01:15] But brother that that you cannot do by
[1:01:18] yourself.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; There has to be a power that come to
[1:01:22] you.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; So that's that's that's big to be loyal
[1:01:29] like that. Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; But let me read about other loyalty.
[1:01:40] And so the full gospel business man has
[1:01:42] been a oasis. The rapture message the
[1:01:46] rapture yuma Arizona
[1:01:48] paragraph 24.
[1:01:51] And so the full gospel businessman has
[1:01:53] been a oasis where we can come together.
[1:01:57] No churches no churches is sponsoring
[1:01:59] it. They all together the men out of the
[1:02:02] churches and we come together in
[1:02:04] fellowship across the world around
[1:02:06] everywhere. I've helped establish many
[1:02:09] many many chapter throughout the entire
[1:02:11] world of the full gospel businessman.
[1:02:14] I'm thankful for that opportunity that
[1:02:17] was given me in there. This businessman
[1:02:20] will sponsor it. Then all the churches
[1:02:22] they want to come anyhow. But then I
[1:02:24] don't want to never try to pull somebody
[1:02:28] from their church.
[1:02:30] Just stay right in your church
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; and scared out the light. Amen. Be a
[1:02:38] real Christian.
[1:02:40] Your pastor will appreciate you.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; A real loyal,
[1:02:48] genuine saint.
[1:02:51] Any man that believes in God will
[1:02:53] appreciate a person like that.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; So, we are called to be faithful.
[1:03:05] You might well well no brother Amando be
[1:03:07] careful. How are you understanding that?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I I am understanding that there is a a
[1:03:15] flock
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; and there is a pastor.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Tucson is Tucson. Phoenix is Phoenix.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But this is talking about a flag
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; and a pastor.
[1:03:29] And if there is a loyal believer,
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; not in Tucson, but in that church,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and what it is to be loyal to give my
[1:03:40] life.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So let let's let's uh dwell a little bit
[1:03:47] into that.
[1:03:51] Where are you going? Well, I'm I'm going
[1:03:54] to brother Thomas church.
[1:03:56] But brother, have you heard what
[1:03:58] happened in there?
[1:04:01] You know, have you don't know?
[1:04:07] Wow. Keep keep talking to me.
[1:04:10] Loyalty.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; A person who is loyal says, "I don't
[1:04:16] care."
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz loyalty will take you to what?
[1:04:25] To death.
[1:04:28] cuz you are loyal
[1:04:31] to that pastor.
[1:04:38] Brother Joseph,
[1:04:40] there have been many ministers who has
[1:04:43] gone to my church and they say, "How did
[1:04:45] you do this?
[1:04:48] How how how did this happen?"
[1:04:51] I'm like I read the message
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; and I tell them what the message says.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; If I am going to preach, I'm not going
[1:05:01] to come here brother with with a spirit
[1:05:04] of brothers and sisters. Let us be
[1:05:08] loyal.
[1:05:09] Loyalty means I can't
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; you know once I get out of this place
[1:05:17] I'm tired. I'm done. I gave everything
[1:05:20] to my God.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I don't have energy because I left all
[1:05:27] my energy right here.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; And I believe that the congregation
[1:05:34] should do the same.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz the reason that we are here is for
[1:05:39] him, the Christ, the Lord, the one who
[1:05:42] saved you and saved me.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Loyalty.
[1:05:49] Amen.
[1:05:52] But I'm going to read another.
[1:05:55] Are you seeing what loyalty?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Have you seen a lot of loyalty like this
[1:06:03] in in churches?
[1:06:07] Have you seen a lot? And I use the term
[1:06:11] lot because I know there ain't.
[1:06:16] There are a few brothers and sisters
[1:06:20] and I think I'm looking at them today.
[1:06:27] Brother Bennon says in the message in
[1:06:30] the winds of a snow white dove
[1:06:32] paragraph 245,
[1:06:36] Sister Palmer, our sister, Sister
[1:06:38] Palmer, her husband is a very dear
[1:06:41] friend of mine, a minister from Georgia
[1:06:44] or Alabama, Georgia. And she was coming
[1:06:48] up to the tabernacle. They drive when
[1:06:51] I'm preaching up at the at the
[1:06:53] tabernacle.
[1:06:55] 1500 miles.
[1:06:57] Wow.
[1:07:02] 1,500
[1:07:04] miles
[1:07:06] to hear one service.
[1:07:08] Brother Palmer lost control of his car
[1:07:11] or the boy one when they was turning a
[1:07:14] corner and they had a wreck. She's got
[1:07:16] an effect of it. Let's pray.
[1:07:20] Dear God, deliver this December servant
[1:07:22] of yours, his little wife, loyal.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Loyal,
[1:07:31] true.
[1:07:35] But what makes it loyal?
[1:07:38] Driving 15 miles.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That makes it loyal, brothers and
[1:07:44] sisters.
[1:07:47] Loyal is not just a term. It's not just
[1:07:50] an adjective. Loyal is a description
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; of the behavior of a person.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Brother, he come from Sierra Vista. He
[1:08:02] is a loyal brother.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; The brother that lives around the corner
[1:08:08] didn't come today. He's not loyal.
[1:08:16] loyal.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm I'm brothers and sisters, I
[1:08:23] I want to be a loyal
[1:08:26] believer.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to shock you.
[1:08:31] I want to be loyal to the church.
[1:08:38] Perhaps some of the people seeing in the
[1:08:41] internet are like
[1:08:44] loyal to the church
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; only if I read it from brother Brandon.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Then let's read it.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And next time I come, I want those
[1:08:57] brothers in here.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] Are we happy?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Message
[1:09:14] the restoration of the bright tree.
[1:09:16] Paragraph 43.
[1:09:21] I'm going to wait till it's there so
[1:09:23] that everybody reads it.
[1:09:29] When I read that, brothers,
[1:09:32] I was like, is this real, brother? Amen.
[1:09:37] It is
[1:09:47] is it is it that message
[1:09:50] the restoration of the bright tree?
[1:09:53] Paragraph 43.
[1:09:59] Brother Israel, this is what I have.
[1:10:03] I I don't I don't know.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Do you trust me that I am a loyal
[1:10:12] servant?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Many times I might not know how to
[1:10:19] pronounce some words brothers but he
[1:10:22] understands.
[1:10:26] Now, brother Brennan says paragraph for
[1:10:28] 43 as I said and if someone of them are
[1:10:33] change seats every once in a while
[1:10:35] somebody sit down and the others get up
[1:10:38] and wait a little while and I will be
[1:10:40] just as brief as I can.
[1:10:44] Now remember,
[1:10:47] pray for me.
[1:10:53] Now remember, pray for me
[1:10:56] and just be loyal.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; To the church.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Be loyal to Shalom Tabernacle.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; You have it right there.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe the prophet
[1:11:29] There is no misinterpretation.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Stay right here.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Being royal mean stay right here.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; No, I have this thing going. I have that
[1:11:47] going. I taught my church and I told
[1:11:49] them the believers I said don't you get
[1:11:52] a job that is gonna take you away from
[1:11:55] coming to church.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; There was a brother for three months he
[1:12:02] was not working
[1:12:04] three months
[1:12:06] and the devil came to him to offer him a
[1:12:09] job
[1:12:11] and he said where are you from? He said
[1:12:14] from Honduras.
[1:12:16] And the and the person said the devil in
[1:12:18] that person said you know I heard who
[1:12:22] endurance are good you know good boxers
[1:12:26] they they are mean people and I need one
[1:12:29] like you
[1:12:33] was the devil
[1:12:36] and he said what is the job?
[1:12:39] Well, the job is over there where I sell
[1:12:41] liquor
[1:12:42] and and I stay all night long. So, there
[1:12:45] are some fights in there and I need you
[1:12:47] over there. The brother said, "No."
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I've been for months not working, but
[1:12:56] the Lord will provide.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Can you give the Lord a hand of praise,
[1:13:03] brothers and sisters?
[1:13:06] Believe
[1:13:07] [Applause]
[1:13:10] God is real.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:24] Stay right here
[1:13:29] to the church
[1:13:32] with
[1:13:35] That means not just the church
[1:13:39] with brother Neville.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; In other words, with the pastor.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Be loyal.
[1:13:50] What is to be loyal?
[1:13:53] To give your life.
[1:13:59] That's a definition. to be a loyal
[1:14:03] person. I will come from I know I I'll
[1:14:07] go miles. I'll go I'll take the
[1:14:09] distance. I'll go through struggles. I
[1:14:11] go through problems. But I'll be loyal.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:18] Do we love the Lord?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:23] Amen.
[1:14:25] I am about 40 minutes.
[1:14:32] God bless you.
[1:14:37] Do we know what the first seal is? Yes.
[1:14:41] Is the antichrist dressed as something
[1:14:45] innocent.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; What is the second seat?
[1:14:52] We know it.
[1:14:55] But do we know to be loyal to the
[1:14:56] church?
[1:15:01] Do we know what this is?
[1:15:04] This is where God dwells.
[1:15:09] That's what brother Brennan says.
[1:15:12] And brother Brennan says, "Lord,
[1:15:16] we thank you for this place." Talking
[1:15:18] about Brandon Tabernacle. He said,
[1:15:20] "Here, Lord, you have changed souls.
[1:15:25] You have saved men. You have taken away
[1:15:28] from us sicknesses.
[1:15:30] You have restored our life. You have
[1:15:33] given us life
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; here Lord.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; If for somebody else this isn't sacred
[1:15:40] for the believer.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; It's sacred.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; If somebody just look at it like it's a
[1:15:48] building that's on them. But I'm me.
[1:15:52] The prophet is calling me to be loyal
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Are you loyal to Christ?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Now bring it down a little bit.
[1:16:08] Be loy be loyal to where he has poured
[1:16:12] out everything. He is
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; the church.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you brothers and sisters.
[1:16:22] It's is I'm delightful to to to speak to
[1:16:26] you, but I know it's getting it's
[1:16:28] getting late. Amen. And some of us have
[1:16:30] to go to work on on uh on Monday. Amen.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you take something from from
[1:16:38] here tonight, remember we got to be
[1:16:41] loyal
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; to the church.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; That might be strange to some believers.
[1:16:49] They did that. That's why they left.
[1:16:52] That's why they are over there in in in
[1:16:54] Lawn Rangers
[1:17:00] somewhere.
[1:17:04] They they do not know. Brother Brandon
[1:17:06] said these things. Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:14] I don't want to I don't want to uh
[1:17:17] finish without reading one more code.
[1:17:22] Amen.
[1:17:24] But you know,
[1:17:27] brothers and sisters, I I believe
[1:17:31] that the Holy Spirit
[1:17:35] wants to live in us.
[1:17:38] I believe that he wants to be worshiped.
[1:17:42] I believe that he wants to do for us
[1:17:46] more than we know about.
[1:18:05] I'm not going to read that quote. I'm
[1:18:06] going to read other code. But but look
[1:18:09] at this.
[1:18:12] Brother Brennan says before the
[1:18:14] millennium happened
[1:18:17] where the bride is going to rule and
[1:18:20] reign,
[1:18:21] he said there has to be a cleanup.
[1:18:27] And every time, Brother Brennan says
[1:18:31] every time that the Holy Spirit wants to
[1:18:34] dwell, there has to be a cleanup.
[1:18:39] Amen.
[1:18:41] And God takes us to through that process
[1:18:45] until the vessel is clean.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] And we want the Holy Spirit in our
[1:18:54] church.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Do you want it in the church?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; But what needs to happen?
[1:19:02] Clean up.
[1:19:11] The young people need the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; It's happiness.
[1:19:19] You wake up in the morning, you're not
[1:19:21] asking this is life. Eat, sleep, get up.
[1:19:25] Eat, sleep, get up. This is life. When
[1:19:27] you have the Holy Spirit, you have a
[1:19:29] purpose.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; Life is not boring.
[1:19:34] You see the enemy trying to capture you,
[1:19:38] attack you when you have the Holy
[1:19:41] Spirit.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But before the Holy Spirit come, there
[1:19:45] needs to be a clean up.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Before the vessel is is full, we have to
[1:19:55] clean it.
[1:19:58] In Spanish, there is a word.
[1:20:02] It's almost cleaning,
[1:20:06] but it's not real cleaning.
[1:20:09] And
[1:20:12] the girls when they are learning, you
[1:20:14] know, the the chores at home, you know,
[1:20:16] they they start with that, you know, the
[1:20:19] mom says, "Go wash the dishes."
[1:20:23] And then the mom goes, "No, this is this
[1:20:25] is not washed.
[1:20:32] And the mom takes the, you know, the the
[1:20:34] mom takes the glass or or the cup or the
[1:20:36] plane and says there this this oil here.
[1:20:41] No, you just it stays all in how you
[1:20:45] just you just pass it through the water.
[1:20:46] No, you need to watch it.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And then the man says, "Let me see. Let
[1:20:51] me show you how you watch it."
[1:20:54] gets a a a masterful hand.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And really watch the cup.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; You know the stain, the smell, the oil.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; For what? What is he going to be watched
[1:21:15] for? Because it's going to be used.
[1:21:20] I am sure as human beings which we have
[1:21:24] our normal minds if they put two glasses
[1:21:26] of full of water over here and one has
[1:21:29] like brown
[1:21:31] something over there and one here if you
[1:21:33] bring it over here I'll be like what are
[1:21:35] you trying you trying to kill me or
[1:21:37] something
[1:21:39] you you're going to say brother Amando
[1:21:41] take water which one do you choose
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; of course I'm going to choose the clean
[1:21:45] one
[1:21:48] And this is a pure message.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; This is not a denomination.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; This is not something mingle with the
[1:21:57] world.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; This is a message that came from heaven.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; This is the spirit of God before the
[1:22:04] throne. Oh hallelujah. Who brought us
[1:22:08] this word, brothers and sisters. It's
[1:22:10] clean
[1:22:14] and before the Holy Spirit come
[1:22:18] the vessel has to be clean
[1:22:22] and you understand what cleaning means.
[1:22:28] Amen.
[1:22:30] Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] Last time I preach here,
[1:22:38] I said
[1:22:40] when you worship,
[1:22:42] great things happen.
[1:22:45] There is something that happens when you
[1:22:47] worship. You surrender yourself.
[1:22:51] You you you you get out of your
[1:22:53] formality.
[1:22:55] You get out of your own. You said, "Oh,
[1:22:58] God, I love you, Lord. I'm here for you,
[1:23:02] Father.
[1:23:04] I'm going to worship you. I'm going to
[1:23:06] say how great you are. I'm going to
[1:23:08] exalt your name. Oh, I'm going to lift
[1:23:11] you up. Oh, God. You You're out. You're
[1:23:14] out of yourself.
[1:23:16] Something is going to happen.
[1:23:21] in the message
[1:23:25] perseverant.
[1:23:27] He brother Brandon preached in so many
[1:23:30] places but I got this this here
[1:23:34] but that didn't stop her a bit
[1:23:38] church letter or nothing else didn't
[1:23:40] stop her why she have heard faith cometh
[1:23:45] by hearing and hearing of the word of
[1:23:47] God. God is good brothers.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; She was perseverant.
[1:23:55] She crowded right on through every
[1:23:58] barrier.
[1:23:59] Now she arrived at Jesus. Now she
[1:24:02] thought, "It's all over now." That's the
[1:24:05] way some people think when they get the
[1:24:06] Holy Ghost. It's all over. It's just
[1:24:10] beginning.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; The journey has started. But now you're
[1:24:14] not alone.
[1:24:16] You got the kingdom. Hallelujah. You got
[1:24:19] the power.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to be perseverant.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; When you arrive, when she arrived at
[1:24:29] Jesus, Jesus said, "Give her Jesus said,
[1:24:33] "Give her a real heart shaking."
[1:24:36] I believe he knew she was coming. So
[1:24:39] when she arrived, he turned around to
[1:24:42] her and let her know that he wasn't sent
[1:24:44] to her race. Oh my, what a let down that
[1:24:48] would have been. Oh, but what did he do?
[1:24:51] That didn't stop her a bit. Not at all.
[1:24:54] Still, she called him son of David.
[1:24:57] Curse the gentile has no hold on Christ
[1:25:00] by the name of son of David.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; No. No. See, the son of David was under
[1:25:06] the kingship and Christ is the king of
[1:25:08] the Jews. But to the church, he's not
[1:25:12] the king. He is the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:15] He's the husband as Sarah called Abraham
[1:25:19] her lord. He's lord of the church but
[1:25:22] king of the Jewish race.
[1:25:25] And so when she worshiped him and said,
[1:25:30] "Lord, help me."
[1:25:33] What did she do? Worshiped.
[1:25:39] worshiped
[1:25:42] and said, "Lord, help me.
[1:25:46] Precious Lord,
[1:25:49] precious King,
[1:25:52] holy man of God.
[1:25:55] You are great.
[1:25:57] You are my way out.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Please help me." Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; One thing is to worship and another
[1:26:06] thing is Lord help me.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:13] Lord help me. Jesus said but you know
[1:26:17] it's not me for me to take the
[1:26:19] children's bread and cast it to you
[1:26:21] dogs. Oh my. If that would have been a
[1:26:24] modern Pentecostal she have turned that
[1:26:27] little nose up and said I'll never go to
[1:26:29] a meeting like that again.
[1:26:32] Why? They don't have the hope that she
[1:26:35] had. Hallelujah. That's right. She had
[1:26:39] the hope. She have heard and faith have
[1:26:42] got it. She had a reason. She had a need
[1:26:46] and she she just wasn't going to turn
[1:26:50] loose. That's right. I like that. Yes,
[1:26:53] sir. Still, she held on. Although she
[1:26:57] was called a dog in a race that was
[1:27:00] lower than dogs said, "I'm not sent to
[1:27:03] your race." But remember, she is an
[1:27:07] atmosphere of worship.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; She's hearing this, but she is in in a
[1:27:14] state of worship.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm only sent to the lost sheep of
[1:27:21] the house of Israel. And she said,
[1:27:23] "Lord, help me." And he said, "It's not
[1:27:25] me for me to take the children's bread
[1:27:28] and cast it to the dogs." Oh my.
[1:27:32] She wasn't a hobbit plant to have to be
[1:27:35] baby. No, no, no, no. She wasn't a
[1:27:38] hobbit plant. Had to be baited. She
[1:27:41] wasn't a mother hybrid. So-called
[1:27:43] believer of the crop today.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:48] She got a hold of something.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Now, well, I am Methodist. I was
[1:27:54] reading, we were listening to the
[1:27:56] message Hebrews and brother Brennan
[1:27:58] says, "You brothers and sisters, you men
[1:28:00] and women there's rises a little problem
[1:28:03] in the church and the first thing you do
[1:28:05] is is run away."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan say you stay there.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Be loyal.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm Methodist and I don't have to
[1:28:17] take that. Bless God, I belong to the
[1:28:20] assemblies. I belong to the church of
[1:28:22] God. I don't have to take that. No, no,
[1:28:24] no, no. That's a hybrid. That's a hybrid
[1:28:26] type. You are bred into some
[1:28:29] organization, but a true, but a real
[1:28:32] true through through bread Christian is
[1:28:34] born of the word of God and holds on no
[1:28:37] matter what takes place.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; It's not for me to give you
[1:28:46] the bread of the children, your dogs,
[1:28:49] but she was worshiping.
[1:28:53] And what did she answer?
[1:28:57] How did that come about?
[1:29:00] There was wisdom because the Holy Spirit
[1:29:03] is wisdom, brothers and sisters.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she said, "But sir, the
[1:29:11] dogs from the crumbs that comes that
[1:29:14] fall from the table."
[1:29:17] Oh woman, great is your faith.
[1:29:21] Hallelujah. But what was she doing? She
[1:29:25] was worshiping. She approached it
[1:29:28] worshiping.
[1:29:30] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord,
[1:29:33] brothers and sisters. God bless you.
[1:29:34] Amen.
[1:29:36] Hallelujah. Brother Bernan, questions
[1:29:38] and answers set. Now wait, let me stop
[1:29:41] there just a minute. Now that's what I
[1:29:43] am trying to tell you people. Brother
[1:29:45] Neville believes the same message that I
[1:29:47] believe. Brother Cops, brother Biller,
[1:29:49] brother Rattle, all these brothers
[1:29:51] around here believe the same message
[1:29:53] that I believe. They preach it same as I
[1:29:55] do. And if you want to really want to,
[1:30:00] you are going to move out or you're
[1:30:02] going to retire or something another and
[1:30:05] want to come for the word. Want to come
[1:30:08] for what? The word.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Come here.
[1:30:17] You know, I hear people in the message,
[1:30:21] you need to go to church. That's a
[1:30:24] that's a blanket statement.
[1:30:26] You need to go to church. But what
[1:30:28] church
[1:30:31] come to my church?
[1:30:36] We need you or no?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; We got to be loyal.
[1:30:44] Brother says, "Come here,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; He said it."
[1:30:54] Do you believe the message
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; or this is shaking you a little bit?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; What is brother What is Brother Armando
[1:31:01] pointing to? What is he doing? Brother,
[1:31:04] I'm telling you, we need to realize who
[1:31:07] we are and what we are. We are not just
[1:31:11] a bunch of people going here and there.
[1:31:14] We have a kingdom.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; We have a church.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a flock. We have a pastor.
[1:31:20] Hallelujah.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We have responsibilities and we fulfill
[1:31:24] our responsibilities.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a lot to say about that,
[1:31:29] but I'll stop.
[1:31:33] And want to come for the word, come
[1:31:36] here. Come to the tabernacle.
[1:31:40] That's where you hear it.
[1:31:45] Come to Shalom Tabernacle.
[1:31:50] Here is where you're going to hear the
[1:31:52] word.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; There you're going to be saved.
[1:31:59] Hallelujah.

[1:46:08] I can't forget that moment when my life
[1:46:12] you made a change.
[1:46:15] Since your spirit came, I'm not the
[1:46:18] same. I give you all my thanks
[1:46:24] and it's my thanks.
[1:46:27] Thanks.

[1:47:40] that you love me.
[1:47:44] I'm amazed
[1:47:47] how you care.
[1:47:51] Through your preious
[1:47:54] blood I found pardon
[1:47:59] and my sins are washed away. They're all
[1:48:05] washed away. All my sins
[1:48:09] are washed away.
[1:48:14] No one knew how alone
[1:48:18] I was feeling
[1:48:22] and the emptiness I tried so hard to
[1:48:26] hide.
[1:48:29] Oh, I laughed and said my life was fine
[1:48:34] without you.
[1:48:38] I was covering up the secret tears I
[1:48:42] cried.
[1:48:45] Then one day someone told me of your
[1:48:50] mercy
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:53] and the love you showed on a hill called
[1:48:57] Calary.
[1:49:00] There you
[1:49:03] purchase my redemption
[1:49:06] [Music]
[1:49:08] when you broke sin's power and set my
[1:49:12] spirit free.
[1:49:15] Now I'm amazed
[1:49:19] that you love me.
[1:49:23] I'm amazed
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:27] how you care.
[1:49:31] Through your preious
[1:49:33] blood, I found pardoned.
[1:49:38] And my sins are washed.
[1:49:43] They're all washed away. All my sins
[1:49:48] are washed away.
[1:49:54] It is true. There have been days when I
[1:49:58] failed you.
[1:50:01] Lord, you know the many times I've gone
[1:50:05] astray.
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:09] But I've learned your love is stronger
[1:50:12] than my weakness.
[1:50:17] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[1:50:23] No one else has ever cared for me like
[1:50:29] you, Lord.
[1:50:32] Other friends could never be so close to
[1:50:37] me.
[1:50:39] And I'm not afraid to face the problems
[1:50:43] of tomorrow.
[1:50:47] Knowing you are everything I'll ever
[1:50:52] need.
[1:50:55] I'm amazed
[1:50:58] that you love me.
[1:51:02] Oh, I'm amazed
[1:51:06] how you care.
[1:51:10] Through your preious
[1:51:13] blood, I found pardon.
[1:51:18] And my sins are washed.
[1:51:22] They're all washed away. All my sins
[1:51:27] are washed
[1:51:29] away. And my sins
[1:51:32] and my sins are washed.
[1:51:37] They're all washed away. All my sins are
[1:51:43] washed
[1:51:45] away.

[1:53:37] your goodness and your mercy to each one
[1:53:39] of us that you found us. You saved us
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and cleaned us up, Lord. Put your spirit
[1:53:44] inside of us, Lord, when we couldn't
[1:53:48] even get along with ourselves, Lord. You
