[2:49] Amen. Praise the Lord, saints. Good
[2:51] morning. Welcome to the house of the
[2:53] Lord. We're going to go into our adult
[2:57] Sunday school portion of the service. Um
[3:00] we have been in the Holy Ghost series.
[3:05] What is the Holy Ghost? What was it
[3:07] given for? We started that in October,
[3:10] the last week of October. So all of
[3:13] November coming into December, we have
[3:16] been in what is the Holy Ghost? What is
[3:18] it given for? And um the Sunday school,
[3:21] the adult Sunday school portion of the
[3:23] service is not just for the background
[3:27] of
[3:28] um the plane of the tape. I think that
[3:31] um it sets the pace for the rest of our
[3:35] day. Of course, here in the prophet, but
[3:38] then it really gives us the opportunity
[3:40] to embrace the subject. We already know
[3:42] what's going to be preached. It's the
[3:44] series on the Holy Ghost. Many of us
[3:46] have heard it. And then you can listen
[3:50] to that series on your own away from the
[3:54] setting of the church. But there's
[3:56] something beautiful when you come
[3:57] together and listen to it as a class, 20
[4:00] minute portions. That's the way that's
[4:02] broken up. And so we just encourage you
[4:05] to embrace that and really draw from the
[4:09] blessing that is in these few moments of
[4:12] what we call our adult Sunday school
[4:14] portion of the service. What was the
[4:17] Holy Ghost? What was it given for? I
[4:19] pulled away from that this morning
[4:21] because I had it on my heart. uh just
[4:24] came on my heart strongly to play the
[4:28] tape
[4:29] um why I'm against organized religion.
[4:32] And so that's what we'll listen to this
[4:34] morning. And in order to get a good
[4:37] portion of that accomplished, we will
[4:40] take our our Sunday school portion and
[4:42] play and start that tape there. It's a
[4:45] message Brother Brandon preached. He
[4:47] takes his scripture
[4:49] in 1 Samuel chapter 8. if you want to
[4:53] prepare to read there verses 4 through
[4:56] through 10. It's a very impactful
[4:58] message and I'm doing this because it
[5:01] was led I was led on my heart to play
[5:04] this tape for the saints uh today and I
[5:07] trust it'll be a blessing to you. Um
[5:10] earlier this year we I encouraged the
[5:15] saints. There was a question came up on
[5:17] something in marriage and divorce and
[5:20] some of the things that brother Brandham
[5:22] says. And so a question came up among
[5:25] some of the young people and even some
[5:27] of the older ones later this year and I
[5:31] felt like I missed warning the saints of
[5:36] some of these basic truths that are in
[5:38] the message. You know, you always feel
[5:40] guilty if somebody missteps or there's a
[5:43] problem that happens in the church. The
[5:45] pastor, I mean, I take that very
[5:47] personal and so I feel like maybe I
[5:50] didn't preach that hard enough or I
[5:51] didn't make that clear enough. Why would
[5:53] someone have a question on that? So, I
[5:55] was feeling a bit bad and I was on my
[5:58] way to uh to the service on Thursday
[6:00] night in Mesa and then the Lord had
[6:02] reminded me that I actually had told the
[6:05] church to listen to Marriage in the
[6:08] Voice. I don't know how many of you all
[6:09] remember that. I got copies of the
[6:12] books. I ordered them. I place them out
[6:14] there for you to get them and to hear
[6:17] them for yourself. And we played that.
[6:18] How many remember that? That was earlier
[6:21] this year. And when I did that, there's
[6:23] a sister, the Lord dealt with her. She
[6:26] repented and gave came back to the Lord,
[6:29] repented and was baptized and was
[6:31] totally but all of the questions that
[6:34] came up later was in that message. And
[6:36] then so my question is, so I said,
[6:39] "Thank you, Lord. I'm off the hook."
[6:40] Because I presented that to the people
[6:43] to listen to marriage and divorce. Now,
[6:45] if you listen to that, if you take that
[6:48] and embrace that, then God bless you. If
[6:50] you don't, then that's really something
[6:53] you should examine. Okay? Many times,
[6:56] Brother Brandon will tell us, you know,
[6:59] when you go home, read the rest of these
[7:00] scriptures. And I wonder how many of us
[7:02] really do that. It's as if he's just
[7:06] saying that to fill in time. No. And he
[7:09] actually says it on this tape. When you
[7:10] go home, take these scriptures and read
[7:12] them. And I think that that's when you
[7:15] will really get the fullness of what
[7:18] that message is trying to bring to you.
[7:20] Amen. So, God bless you. As we prepare
[7:23] to go to this message, let's all stand
[7:25] and sing. Only believe.
[7:29] Amen. Only [singing] believe. [music]
[7:34] Only [singing]
[7:36] believe [music]
[7:39] that all things are possible
[7:45] only.
[7:50] Only [singing]
[7:52] [music] believe.
[7:56] Only [singing]
[7:57] believe.
[8:01] All things are possible.
[8:06] Only
[8:08] Billy.
[8:11] God bless. You may be seated. Brother
[8:12] Brandham.
[8:14] tonight is why I'm against organized
[8:18] religion.
[8:19] And I'm going to read now for a
[8:22] background
[8:24] or scripture reading to make it uh
[8:28] certainly scriptural. I want to read
[8:31] from 1st Samuel 8
[8:35] 4-10
[8:37] then 19- 20. To my visible audience, I
[8:42] trust that when you go home that you'll
[8:44] write these scriptures down and read
[8:46] them carefully and to the brethren who
[8:50] will be listening to the tape. I trust
[8:53] that you also will not just stop the
[8:58] tape when something said maybe that you
[9:00] wouldn't agree with, but will
[9:04] seek God in it. see if it's scriptural.
[9:09] I think we owe it to ourselves
[9:12] and to the message of the day.
[9:17] I believe that all churches has
[9:20] Christians in them
[9:23] and I certainly do not speak against
[9:26] Christians.
[9:28] But the reason that I have did what I
[9:30] have done and said what I have said is
[9:34] because of the inspiration of the Holy
[9:37] Spirit on the word. Now let us read in 1
[9:42] Samuel the 8th chapter beginning with
[9:46] the fourth verse and reading the 10th
[9:50] inclusive verse.
[9:53] Then all the elders of Israel gathered
[9:55] themselves together and came to Samuel
[9:59] at Ramoth
[10:01] and said unto him, Behold, thou art old,
[10:05] and thy sons not walk
[10:08] not in the way now. Make us a king to
[10:13] judge us like all the nations.
[10:17] But the thing displeased Samuel when
[10:21] they said, "Give us a king to judge us."
[10:24] And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the
[10:27] Lord said unto Samuel, hearken unto the
[10:30] voice of the people in all that they say
[10:34] unto thee, for they have not rejected
[10:38] thee, but they have rejected me, that I
[10:41] should not reign over them,
[10:45] according to all the works which they
[10:48] have done since the day that I brought
[10:51] them up out of Egypt, even unto this
[10:53] day, wherewith they have forsaken me and
[10:57] serve other gods, so do they also
[11:02] unto thee.
[11:04] Now therefore, hearken unto their voice.
[11:07] How be it, yet protest solemnly unto
[11:11] them, and show them the manner of the
[11:14] king that shall rule over them. And
[11:18] Samuel told all these words of the Lord
[11:21] unto the people that asked of him a
[11:24] king.
[11:26] Now the 19th verse and 20th
[11:31] for the conclusion.
[11:33] Nevertheless, the people refused to obey
[11:36] the voice of Samuel, and they said,
[11:39] "Nay,
[11:41] but we will have a king over us,
[11:45] that we also may be like all the
[11:49] nations, and that our king may judge us,
[11:53] and go before us, and fight our
[11:57] battles."
[11:59] The Lord add his blessing unto the
[12:03] reading of his words. Now, as a Sunday
[12:09] school class,
[12:11] I would like to uh say that we want to
[12:16] try to be as as attentive as we can to
[12:20] the word.
[12:22] And we know that that sometimes things
[12:27] are said and certain churches that
[12:30] stumble someone who has been taught
[12:32] contrary to what they have are hearing.
[12:37] For instance, a man told me the other
[12:39] day who is a friend of mine sitting
[12:41] present now.
[12:42] He said, "When you said, Brother
[12:44] Brandham,
[12:46] as much faith as I've had in you and
[12:48] believe, when you said there wasn't no
[12:52] eternal hell,"
[12:54] said I like to fell out of my seat.
[12:58] I said, "Surely the man is wrong." And
[13:01] then said, "You let us stand for quite a
[13:04] while." And then you said there is only
[13:07] one form of eternal life and that comes
[13:12] from God. And that's what we all seek.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; See, and there's no scripture that says
[13:17] there is an eternal hell because eternal
[13:20] never did begin.
[13:23] Neither does it ever end.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; So the Bible said hell was created for
[13:28] the devil and his angels. So it isn't
[13:31] eternal. There was a time when it
[13:34] wasn't. And there will be a time when
[13:36] it's not again.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; But they may be punished in there
[13:40] through fire and brimstone
[13:43] and the pits of fire for aons of time.
[13:49] But it finally will end because hell is
[13:53] not eternal. And if there was an eternal
[13:55] hell, you'd have to have eternal life to
[13:57] live in an eternal hell. And if it was
[14:00] eternal, it always was. And you always
[14:02] was in hell. and you'll always be in
[14:05] hell. See, so there is no such a thing.
[14:08] So you see, eternal is never had a
[14:11] beginning or an end and is only one form
[14:13] of eternal life and that is in God.
[14:17] Comes from the Greek word Zoey which
[14:19] means God's own life. And when we are
[14:22] born again of the spirit of God, we
[14:25] become
[14:28] eternal with God because we have part of
[14:31] his life which makes us sons and
[14:34] daughters to God. Then we have eternal
[14:36] life and the life that is in us. God
[14:39] will raise up the body with the life at
[14:42] the last day. But it's the spirit of God
[14:46] that's in us that raises up because it
[14:48] is a spirit of Christ that was in Christ
[14:52] that quickens our bodies and raises us
[14:54] up also with him to set and and glory
[14:58] and reign with him. Now to the subject.
[15:02] Now I have been through these years and
[15:08] this tabernacle has stood though I was
[15:11] ordained in a missionary Baptist church
[15:14] by Dr. Roy E. Davis about 33 years ago
[15:21] here in Jeffersonville.
[15:23] Now
[15:24] I since then I was in the organization
[15:28] just a short time a few months until
[15:31] something come up that was unscriptural
[15:34] by the church and I told him I could not
[15:38] go and so I was of course um asked to do
[15:45] it or else and I
[15:47] so that was one thing and I believe that
[15:51] this is God's word.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; And I said to the man which was a a
[15:58] master teacher,
[16:00] if you will show me that in God's word,
[16:05] but it was he said that's our teaching.
[16:07] I said, but I want it out of the word.
[16:12] &gt;&gt; See, God's word. am
[16:16] not because that I do not belong to an
[16:18] organization
[16:20] that I have been against the
[16:22] organization because I am grateful to my
[16:25] brethren to which I am speaking today
[16:29] that I have invitations to I guess
[16:32] pretty near every denomination
[16:35] especially in the full gospel ranks and
[16:39] even in many of the other churches I
[16:42] have been asked to come into their
[16:45] fellowship and join with them. But I
[16:47] have stayed independent
[16:50] because what influence that I have, I do
[16:54] not wish to place it upon one group of
[16:57] people. I wish to place what God has
[17:01] given me. A prayer for the sick to be
[17:05] benefited by all God's children and
[17:08] every organization.
[17:11] He has never questioned to me uh not to
[17:14] pray or for this one because they belong
[17:16] to such and such. God judges the heart
[17:20] of man.
[17:22] And now to begin with the reason that I
[17:25] haven't
[17:26] belonged to them and have spoken
[17:30] against it is first is because I do not
[17:35] believe that organization of
[17:37] Christianity is scriptural. Amen.
[17:40] &gt;&gt; I believe it's unscriptural.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; And that's what I will try tonight
[17:46] endeavor by the grace of God to prove to
[17:49] you that it is unscriptural,
[17:52] unorthodox to have any organization.
[17:56] Now the first place we call it religion.
[18:00] The word religion is a covering. Means
[18:05] to cover something.
[18:07] Now, Adam had a religion,
[18:10] but he certainly made it himself out of
[18:14] fig leaves
[18:16] &gt;&gt; and it didn't work.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; He made his own theory and tried to make
[18:22] a way of escape to find salvation and
[18:25] something he had done himself and God
[18:27] rejected it from Adam to the order of
[18:31] the last organization.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Never been. And by God's grace, we'll
[18:36] prove it today through the Bible.
[18:39] Religion was a covering. Adam made
[18:43] himself a covering out of fig leaves.
[18:46] Made it himself to try to do something
[18:49] himself. But God required death and
[18:52] atonement.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a quite a vast difference
[18:56] between religion and salvation. Yeah.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; See, salvation, religion is a covering.
[19:04] See, salvation is a birth.
[19:17] Earth
[19:19] a gift of God and it cannot be achieved
[19:23] by any man or any group of man.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; It's an individual
[19:30] that God brings this gift to. And these
[19:35] gifts of eternal life
[19:38] were ordained of God to each individual
[19:43] before we even had a world according to
[19:46] the scriptures.
[19:48] The Bible said in Revelations that the
[19:52] Antichrist that was to come upon the
[19:54] earth would deceive all that dwelt upon
[19:57] the earth whose names were not written
[20:00] in the Lamb's book of life before the
[20:04] foundation of the world.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; God by his fornowledge
[20:11] saw who would come and who wouldn't
[20:13] come. Christ came down to make a way for
[20:16] those who would come.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; See, knowing the others, if he's God at
[20:22] all, he has to be infinite. And if he's
[20:27] infinite, he cannot be infinite without
[20:29] being omnipotent.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; He cannot be omnipotent without being
[20:35] omnipresent.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; He can't be omnipresent without being
[20:38] omnicient.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; You see, all that makes him God. So he
[20:42] knowed the end from the beginning.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:45] &gt;&gt; He knowed who would and who would not.
[20:49] And he knowed there was many who would.
[20:51] So he sent Christ to make an atonement
[20:53] for those who would come.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Now nothing we do can have anything to
[20:58] do with it.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All the father has given me
[21:03] half past tense will come to me.
[21:10] And no man can come unless my father
[21:13] draws him.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Now see, it's all in God's knowledge.
[21:20] You say, "Brother Brand, am I in? I
[21:22] don't know. I'm hoping I am." We work
[21:26] out our own salvation with fear and
[21:27] trembling. Now, the church is
[21:30] predestinated
[21:32] to meet God without spot or wrinkle.
[21:35] Amen.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if we're in that church, we are
[21:38] predestinated with that church.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Now, examine yourself by the word. Then
[21:45] you can check up how far along we are.
[21:49] Now, now organizational
[21:52] Christianity can never give that
[21:55] assurance. No. Some of them said, "You
[21:57] come up and confess that Jesus is the
[22:00] Christ, be baptized in the church." The
[22:02] devil does the same thing. He believes
[22:05] himself that Jesus is the Christ and
[22:07] tremble. See, that's right.
[22:10] God never commanded nowhere in the
[22:13] scripture for there ever to be any
[22:16] organization. There's no place in the
[22:19] Bible for that.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Adam started one and it failed. And then
[22:26] Nimrod tried to make an organization.
[22:30] If you're a historian and you know the
[22:33] history of Babylon, read Hess's two
[22:35] Bablins, you'll find a great lot of
[22:37] light that Nimrod, this man of sin, uh
[22:43] took Bablin and all its uh little sister
[22:46] church or places around which was a type
[22:49] of of this last day apostasy
[22:54] Christianity and made one great big
[22:58] place and all the rest of them played
[23:00] paid tribute to it. And in there, he
[23:03] built a tower and tried to organize man
[23:06] together, but it failed.
[23:09] It failed.
[23:11] That failed. Kora and Numbers 16:1, if
[23:16] you'd like to read, Kora tried the very
[23:19] same thing.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] He got all the Levites together
[23:25] and he got the uh uh some of the
[23:28] celebrity, the high man, great man, holy
[23:33] man,
[23:34] and him and Dayan got together and said,
[23:38] "It's not right. One man trying to be
[23:42] oversolved." And so they tried to get a
[23:45] an organization started together and
[23:48] they come up before Moses
[23:52] and Aaron who God had chosen for the
[23:56] work and told them they took too much
[23:59] upon themselves that the whole
[24:01] congregation was holy and they had a
[24:04] right to in the multitude of counsel or
[24:07] safety. Of course they say that doesn't
[24:10] apply to Christianity.
[24:13] That's in war.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Notice whole lots of difference. You can
[24:17] take a scripture and say Judas went and
[24:19] hung himself and you go do likewise if
[24:21] you want to. But that don't make it
[24:23] right.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; God had chosen Moses.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; And God had chosen Aaron
[24:34] &gt;&gt; and it was the message of the day.
[24:38] Praise the Lord.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; And no matter how good the other side
[24:42] looked, it was contrary to God's
[24:45] thinking.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; And we've got to let God's thinking be
[24:50] our thinking. Let the mind that was in
[24:52] Christ be in you.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; And this Bible reveals the mind of
[24:58] Christ.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; And the whole book of Revelations called
[25:02] the apocalypse is the revelation of
[25:06] Jesus Christ.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we can see how he condemns the
[25:10] thing, how he takes it to one side, and
[25:13] we'll get to it after a bit. All right.
[25:16] Kora, I believe he was sincere in his
[25:20] act.
[25:21] I believe the man didn't uh didn't mean
[25:26] to do wrong. I believe it was the
[25:30] ignorance of the man that didn't see the
[25:34] hand of God moving and know the
[25:37] scriptures and that's the reason he just
[25:39] brought it to reason
[25:42] &gt;&gt; and that's just about 90%
[25:46] of the trouble today
[25:48] &gt;&gt; that we try to inject into the program
[25:52] of God our thinking
[25:56] &gt;&gt; and we are not supposed to think it all.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; He does our thinking.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to surrender our thinking
[26:05] to his will.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; You understand? Now
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Kora with good intent
[26:14] went around with a false doctrine
[26:18] telling these brothers and showing them
[26:20] by reason that God hadn't only blessed
[26:23] Moses the prophet the messenger and had
[26:27] only blessed him but the whole
[26:29] congregation
[26:31] &gt;&gt; was holy. He said and now the whole
[26:35] congregation has a right to do this. The
[26:37] whole congregation has a right to do
[26:39] that. And so they got good man,
[26:44] Levites. Now that is God's choice which
[26:48] would be called today the ministers.
[26:51] Levite was the minister of the temple.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Did not Moses call him down for it? And
[26:59] here he never went at it unre
[27:03] irreverent. He told them to take sensors
[27:07] and put holy fire in it and put this
[27:11] incense over the top of it and to wave
[27:15] this holy incense which was the command
[27:18] of God.
[27:20] And they come up to make a group of men
[27:24] to control the church where God had
[27:28] commanded one man to do so.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:34] And when they did that,
[27:36] Moses fell on his face,
[27:39] &gt;&gt; for he knew that God had commissioned
[27:41] him to that work
[27:44] &gt;&gt; and God said, "Have him to bring those
[27:47] sensors up here before the tabernacle."
[27:50] And so when they begin to wave their
[27:54] sensors full of fire and the incense are
[27:56] going, God said to Moses and Aaron,
[27:59] "Separate yourself from them."
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Come out
[28:05] &gt;&gt; from among them.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; For later he called them sinners.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Unbelievers.
[28:13] And sin is unbelief in the word of God.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; You steal because you don't believe. You
[28:22] lie because you don't believe.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; You commit adultery because you don't
[28:27] believe. If you was a believer, you
[28:29] wouldn't do such.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; There's only two roads. That's either
[28:35] faith or unbelief. You're controlled by
[28:38] one or the other.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; [music]

[1:19:36] just he'd make sure he kept the mic in

[1:20:15] and we appreciate each of you. Amen. I
[1:20:18] had a message I had been working on.
[1:20:19] It's definitely on my heart and I was
[1:20:21] putting it all together last night. I
[1:20:23] was going to bring that. And then this
[1:20:24] morning, something I had been listening
[1:20:27] to just really touched me and I felt
[1:20:30] like I should play it. I've thought that
[1:20:31] many times, but this was a little bit
[1:20:33] more. And I feel like the answer to
[1:20:37] what's going on in my life and our lives
[1:20:41] is on this tape here this morning. I
[1:20:44] believe that if it is not for anyone
[1:20:46] else, it'll be for me. I didn't listen
[1:20:48] to the entire message, but just felt
[1:20:50] impressed to play um that for the saints
[1:20:54] this morning. All right. And that
[1:20:56] message is um why I'm against organized
[1:21:00] religion. So as prepare as we prepare to
[1:21:02] go there, let's stand and read the
[1:21:04] opening scripture that we started that
[1:21:06] message in Sunday school. 1st Samuel
[1:21:09] chapter 8
[1:21:11] verses number 4 and 10.
[1:21:20] 1st Samuel chapter 8
[1:21:24] verse number four
[1:21:29] verse number 10. I'll put it on the
[1:21:32] screen for you too if you can't get it.
[1:21:35] But the thing then all the elders of
[1:21:38] Israel gathered themselves together and
[1:21:40] came to Samuel at Rama and said unto
[1:21:44] him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons
[1:21:47] walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king
[1:21:51] to judge us like all the nations. But
[1:21:54] the thing displeased Samuel when they
[1:21:57] said, "Give us a king to judge us." And
[1:22:00] Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the
[1:22:03] Lord said unto Samuel, "Hearken unto the
[1:22:06] voice of the people, and all that they
[1:22:08] say unto thee, for they have not
[1:22:11] rejected thee, they have rejected me,
[1:22:14] that I should not reign over them."
[1:22:17] according to all the works which they
[1:22:19] have done since the day that I brought
[1:22:21] them up out of Egypt, even unto this
[1:22:24] day, wherewith they have forsaken me,
[1:22:28] served other gods, so do they also unto
[1:22:31] thee. Now therefore hearken unto their
[1:22:34] voice. How be it yet protest solemn
[1:22:39] solemnly unto them and show them the
[1:22:43] manner of the king that shall reign over
[1:22:46] them. Samuel told all the words of the
[1:22:49] Lord unto the people that asked him of a
[1:22:52] king. Verses number 19.
[1:22:56] Nevertheless, the people refused to obey
[1:22:58] the voice of Samuel, and they said,
[1:23:01] "Nay, but we will have a king over us,
[1:23:04] that we also may be like all the
[1:23:07] nations, and that our king may judge us
[1:23:10] and go out before us and fight our
[1:23:12] battles." And Samuel heard all the words
[1:23:14] of the people, and he rehearsed them
[1:23:17] into the ears of the Lord. The Lord said
[1:23:19] to Samuel, "Hearken to their voice. Make
[1:23:23] them a king." And Samuel said unto the
[1:23:26] men of Israel, "Go ye every man unto his
[1:23:30] city." Amen. May God add a blessing to
[1:23:32] the reading of his word. As we move
[1:23:35] forward and listen to this message here,
[1:23:38] a portion of this message
[1:23:40] um why I'm against organized religion
[1:23:43] and let's sing only believe as we
[1:23:46] prepare there. [music]
[1:23:48] Only
[1:23:50] believe. [singing]
[1:23:54] Oh,
[1:23:56] living
[1:24:00] that all things are possible.
[1:24:06] Only
[1:24:08] believe. [music and singing]
[1:24:12] Only
[1:24:13] believe. [singing]
[1:24:15] [music]
[1:24:15] Hallelujah.
[1:24:17] Only
[1:24:19] believe.
[1:24:23] All things are possible.
[1:24:29] Oh, let's make a confession. Lord, I
[1:24:32] believe.
[1:24:34] And Lord,
[1:24:36] I believe.
[1:24:40] Lord,
[1:24:42] I believe
[1:24:46] that all things are possible.
[1:24:52] Yes Lord
[1:24:54] I believe.
[1:24:58] Oh Lord
[1:25:00] I believe.
[1:25:02] Hallelujah. [music]
[1:25:04] Lord
[1:25:06] I believe.
[1:25:10] All things are possible.
[1:25:14] [music and singing]
[1:25:16] for
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you. May be seated, brother
[1:25:22] Brenham.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:27] God in the beginning was the word and he
[1:25:29] was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He was the word. He is the word. And
[1:25:34] when God dwells in you, it's the word of
[1:25:37] God dwelling in you
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; where you can punctuate everything he
[1:25:41] says with an amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; That's God dwelling in you. Now, if you
[1:25:48] notice
[1:25:50] these innocent men
[1:25:53] with sensors in their hand, holy bar in
[1:25:57] their hand, God opened up the earth
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; and swallowed them up
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; and separated them from Moses because
[1:26:08] Moses separated himself from them. Amen.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; And Moses warned the congregation.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Don't fool with that kind of a group.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Get away from them.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Now you know the scriptures.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Read the 16th, 17th, 18th even chapter
[1:26:30] and you'll find it. Separate yourself
[1:26:32] from these sinners.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Unbelieving sinners. Come out from among
[1:26:38] them.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] for they're headed for destruction
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; and everything that they had. And when
[1:26:47] they the earth followed and fell with
[1:26:51] these men holding this holy fire,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; innocent man deceived by man. Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; See, today
[1:27:05] there's a many innocent man
[1:27:08] falling into the trap of tradition
[1:27:10] [clears throat]
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; holding the holy word in his hand.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; And supposedly to be preaching from it.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I seen a expression come across a
[1:27:24] minister's face just then. a Methodist
[1:27:26] minister, was a Methodist minister till
[1:27:28] last Sunday night. And honey, look, I
[1:27:32] suppose it means a whole lot to you,
[1:27:35] brother, to be out.
[1:27:39] Now see holding sensors
[1:27:45] fire
[1:27:47] burning sweet smelling savior before God
[1:27:51] and those hands
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; holding that yet perished
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; with the sense in their hand because
[1:28:00] they were trying to do something in
[1:28:02] sincerity yet against
[1:28:05] the word of God. Oh, amen.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Trying to make an organization
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; said, "You take too much upon yourself."
[1:28:14] Who are you to say that you've got all
[1:28:15] the word of God? They failed to see that
[1:28:18] Moses was the messenger of that hour.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; He had thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; There was nobody on earth like him.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; He had the message and the people failed
[1:28:32] to see it. And Moses was exactly with
[1:28:35] thus sayaeth the Lord.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Sure. All right. Now, we find the same
[1:28:42] thing today. Good man, great man,
[1:28:47] precious man
[1:28:49] trying to preach the word of God in
[1:28:52] their hand through some manmade
[1:28:54] tradition,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; cutting out here and cutting down here
[1:28:58] and making it this and come join the
[1:28:59] church and change your membership.
[1:29:04] spiritually die with that word in their
[1:29:06] hand.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; They could not believe God's messenger
[1:29:14] or his message of that day.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; They couldn't understand why a great God
[1:29:20] wouldn't work with a whole group of
[1:29:21] people and just put it up on one man.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; How many of them have I talked today?
[1:29:27] What would we do, brother Brown?
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; We know you're right. But what will we
[1:29:31] do? the organization to put us out. We'd
[1:29:33] have no other place to go. I feel sorry
[1:29:35] for them,
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; but there is a place.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, we had starved to
[1:29:44] death." David said, "Once I was young,
[1:29:47] and now I'm old." Now, I've never seen
[1:29:49] the righteous forsaken, nor his seed to
[1:29:52] beg bread.
[1:29:55] That's exactly on the same basis
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; that they refused Jesus.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; They were so wrapped up in their
[1:30:03] denomination and holy priest and holy
[1:30:07] buildings and holy churches and holy
[1:30:10] temples, they failed to see God in his
[1:30:13] human temple.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; You being a man, make yourself God. Mhm.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; See, they were so wrapped up in it.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; These men were so wrapped up that Dayan
[1:30:27] and Nam were right.
[1:30:31] Nimrod was so wrapped up that he could
[1:30:34] achieve something that would take the
[1:30:36] people above the wrath of God.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Adam was sure that if he covered his
[1:30:41] nakedness, God couldn't see it.
[1:30:44] You can't cover it. God has to cover it.
[1:30:48] That's right.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; God's program covers it, not yours.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; It's always been that way.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; They fail to see Jesus in his temple.
[1:30:59] God manifested in flesh
[1:31:04] today. It kind of makes me feel bad when
[1:31:06] I see that the words of the Bible has
[1:31:10] been so cut up by tradition.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. and honestarted people who stand
[1:31:15] there and hear that word and they know
[1:31:17] it's the truth but they're daring to
[1:31:20] take a move
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; because their tradition teaches them
[1:31:24] different.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Wash the pots and pans then. Brethren,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; go ahead. But for us and for me in my
[1:31:31] house, we take Christ the word.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Let's take John 3 just a moment.
[1:31:40] Nicodemus,
[1:31:42] a master and ruler of a great
[1:31:45] denomination called the Sanhedrin. They
[1:31:49] brought themselves together and they
[1:31:50] made their traditions, the one of the
[1:31:52] Pharisees and one of the Sadducees. And
[1:31:54] they had their denomination and their
[1:31:57] differences. And so they, this man was a
[1:32:02] master,
[1:32:03] a ruler
[1:32:05] of this great Sanhedrin,
[1:32:08] a marvelous man in teaching. He know the
[1:32:12] scriptures. He thought, he knew it by
[1:32:15] their tradition.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Did not Jesus say, "You have by your
[1:32:20] tradition made the commandments of God
[1:32:23] of non effect
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; because of their traditions." What is
[1:32:28] that? Placing their own interpretation
[1:32:31] upon the word instead of leaving it
[1:32:33] alone what it says.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; They say it doesn't mean this. Did you
[1:32:38] notice that's the same voice that the
[1:32:40] devil used to Eve to start the first
[1:32:42] organization?
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Surely it would be this way. God
[1:32:47] wouldn't do that. You know, it's the
[1:32:49] same thing.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today. Now we notice
[1:32:54] this ruler
[1:32:56] came to Jesus.
[1:32:58] The first thing now he come in search of
[1:33:02] eternal life.
[1:33:04] He come in search of salvation
[1:33:08] yet a man of his standing.
[1:33:11] a master in Israel.
[1:33:14] But a master in Israel come to a man
[1:33:19] that we have no record ever had a day in
[1:33:21] school.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; An old age man,
[1:33:28] old priest sage come to a young fellow
[1:33:35] aristocrat.
[1:33:37] They were rich man come to a beggar that
[1:33:42] didn't have a place to lay his head
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; to ask [screaming] him
[1:33:48] for way to salvation and
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; the first place
[1:33:55] they of that Sanhadrin so confessed
[1:33:57] Nicodemus they had seen something in
[1:34:00] Jesus
[1:34:02] that other men of their organization
[1:34:05] didn't have
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:34:09] Hallelujah.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; They seen that there was something in
[1:34:12] him
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; because he said, "Rabbi, we know thy
[1:34:16] we."
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't confess it because they
[1:34:22] get kicked out.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:34:25] we know thou art a teacher come from
[1:34:27] God.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; For no man could do these things that
[1:34:30] you do except God be with him. We know
[1:34:32] that.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Oh myise.
[1:34:37] organization.
[1:34:40] Now, we notice that Jesus was a
[1:34:43] manifestation of God.
[1:34:46] Now, no man can do these things except
[1:34:49] God be with him.
[1:34:51] They know that there was something
[1:34:53] different in that man.
[1:34:56] He was the light of the day.
[1:34:59] He was God's witness.
[1:35:02] So did Kora.
[1:35:05] See the same thing in Moses.
[1:35:08] They didn't have a man that day like
[1:35:10] Moses.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; He was God's divine witness
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; of that day to the power of God.
[1:35:20] Cora and his group saw it. And Moses.
[1:35:24] They understood that it couldn't be
[1:35:26] Moses.
[1:35:28] Moses could not open up the Red Sea.
[1:35:32] Moses could not send plagues upon the
[1:35:34] earth.
[1:35:36] It was God.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; In Moses.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; And because God represented himself in a
[1:35:44] witness or a light of the day, they
[1:35:47] failed to see it.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Kora wanted to make a whole group of
[1:35:51] men. Bring in anything. That's what the
[1:35:54] organization's good for. Bring in every
[1:35:55] riff wrath there is and call it
[1:35:57] Christianity.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Send a boy to school that knows more
[1:36:01] about God than a hot and top would know
[1:36:03] about an Egyptian knife. Send him over
[1:36:05] there and give him an education, learn
[1:36:06] him for psychology, and give him a PhD
[1:36:09] and a doctor of degree or bachelor of
[1:36:12] art or something like that and send him
[1:36:14] away to preach the gospel. It's never
[1:36:15] even been saved.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; That will deny the virgin birth and the
[1:36:19] resurrection. Deny divine healing. Deny
[1:36:22] the power of God.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:26] Deny the very principles that Jesus died
[1:36:29] for. Deny Mark 16 of being inspired.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; My Lord,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; deny these signs shall follow them that
[1:36:35] believe when Jesus said the words
[1:36:37] himself.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Deny Acts 2:38.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Deny any rest of scriptures that's
[1:36:44] inspired.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; And try to take a tradition of man that
[1:36:47] they know nothing about and harp on it.
[1:36:49] And when you tell them the truth and
[1:36:50] show them the truth, they're ashamed to
[1:36:52] move because their organization.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Kora did the same thing.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; He seen God in Moses.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; He seen it was God's agent working
[1:37:03] through him.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; And Nicodemus
[1:37:07] saw God in [screaming] Christ.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; No man can do these things except God be
[1:37:13] with him.
[1:37:18] Nicodemus was already in the
[1:37:21] organization trying to get out.
[1:37:24] Kora was out trying to make one to get
[1:37:26] into. That was a different
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus is trying to find salvation
[1:37:33] to get out of the thing. He been in it
[1:37:35] since the boy. He's tired of it. He want
[1:37:37] to get saved. But Cor was trying to make
[1:37:40] him a a place where he could be a big
[1:37:41] shot.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; That's where the people today. That's
[1:37:44] the trouble with Christianity. We got so
[1:37:47] much false impersonations.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And our Pentecostal people excuse
[1:37:52] expression is lousy with it.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Carnal comparison.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Let God raise up a man and give him
[1:37:59] something and everybody in the country
[1:38:02] will try to impersonate that person.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you realize you're killing your
[1:38:06] own team.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; When you're playing football in a grace,
[1:38:10] as Paul would have put it, let us run
[1:38:12] this race with patience. The man that's
[1:38:14] got the ball, don't take it out of his
[1:38:15] hands.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Try to guard him. But instead of that
[1:38:19] because you don't belong to your
[1:38:21] organization, you're trying to take it
[1:38:22] away from it.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Am I
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; some man that so clumsy he couldn't
[1:38:28] stumble over the flowers in a rug and
[1:38:30] then try to take it away from it? That's
[1:38:32] right. Ah, spiritual speaking. I mean,
[1:38:35] excuse me.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Well, you stumble over a little thing
[1:38:40] like Acts 2:38, he's short of fall.
[1:38:43] Stumbles over Mark 16, how's he going to
[1:38:45] make it?
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] very chief lessons of Christ and the
[1:38:52] very thing that was discussed at the NIA
[1:38:54] council. They still stumble over after
[1:38:57] all these years
[1:38:59] trying Cora was trying to make an
[1:39:02] organization to get into it and
[1:39:03] Nicodemus had been in it trying to get
[1:39:05] out of it.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus was accepted
[1:39:10] and came out. Kora perished in it.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. in his effort. He perished in his
[1:39:18] own effort.
[1:39:20] Oh my.
[1:39:23] The organization that Nicodemus was in
[1:39:28] knew that Christ was sent of God
[1:39:33] said. So Nicodemus in the third uh
[1:39:37] chapter here confesses it. Rabbi, we
[1:39:41] know that thou art a teacher sent from
[1:39:44] God. For no man can do these miracles
[1:39:47] that you do except God be with him.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; And the same group
[1:39:54] because of their organization called him
[1:39:58] the elub
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; because of his power to cast out devils
[1:40:02] and said he deceives our people by his
[1:40:06] doctrine.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing today.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Deceiving what?
[1:40:14] Jesus said, "I only do that that pleases
[1:40:17] the father."
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; I only keep the words of God because he
[1:40:23] was the word.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; You couldn't do nothing else but the
[1:40:26] word,
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; but because of their organization.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Because of their way they had man tied
[1:40:34] up in their hearts. They knew it,
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; but their organization wouldn't let him
[1:40:40] keep it.
[1:40:42] than to make a way of escape to keep the
[1:40:45] people from leaving the organization.
[1:40:47] all men goeth after him to keep the
[1:40:50] people from leaving the organization and
[1:40:52] following God's truth which he was truth
[1:40:55] I am the truth the light
[1:40:58] to keep them from following that they
[1:41:00] said that he was deceiving the people
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; think of it a man that in his heart know
[1:41:09] that he was God
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; God was in him
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; no man can say these things or do these
[1:41:17] things unless God be with him. Knowing
[1:41:20] that and saying that and confessing that
[1:41:22] and then turning around and calling the
[1:41:24] elabub and a deceiver of the people
[1:41:31] their people by his doctrine. Oh my.
[1:41:35] Nicodemus knew he was a prophet. Now
[1:41:39] that was one in the organization at
[1:41:43] loved God enough and feared God enough
[1:41:45] and recognized by the Old Testament that
[1:41:49] this man had the qualifications and was
[1:41:52] proven and vindicated.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; A prophet sent from God.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; The man I'll honor him if he did come
[1:42:01] but he got there. He's a lot better than
[1:42:04] a lot of our teachers today. They won't
[1:42:06] come at all. Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus finally arrived. So don't
[1:42:10] condemn him. You haven't arrived yet.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus knew that he was a prophet. So
[1:42:19] he feared God.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't let that man get away from
[1:42:25] him. The light of that day, no matter
[1:42:28] how much it was contrary, how much his
[1:42:30] organization said it was contrary, he
[1:42:32] seen God vindicating that man. And he
[1:42:36] knew he was a prophet. And if he was a
[1:42:38] prophet, the word of the Lord comes to
[1:42:40] the prophet.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; And he knowed what he was talking about.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; So he went to Jesus.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; He wanted to know how to get salvation.
[1:42:55] This man was a prophet. The word of God
[1:42:57] was with him and he would know the way
[1:42:59] of salvation. Amen.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; But what Nicodemus had to learn is what
[1:43:08] many people today of the denominations
[1:43:10] of this day has to learn.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; What Nicodemus ought to have known is
[1:43:17] what the people today ought to have
[1:43:18] known of these denominations. He was
[1:43:21] more than a prophet.
[1:43:26] He come to him to find tell him to tell
[1:43:29] him which way to life. And Jesus himself
[1:43:32] was life.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; He that has a son has life.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; So he didn't mustn't come to try to
[1:43:39] learn a teaching. He must come to accept
[1:43:42] the person.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; That's what it is tonight.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; The chief cornerstone is rejected again.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; That's it. Exactly right. What is the
[1:43:52] chief cornerstone? It's a word. Of
[1:43:55] course, Christ, he is the word.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; He had to learn something.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; He thought, well, this man is a prophet.
[1:44:05] He's just a prophet. So, did you notice
[1:44:08] Jesus never answered his question?
[1:44:11] He just rebuked him for his blindness.
[1:44:16] more than a prophet.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; He was the word and the shining light of
[1:44:22] the word.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He was God shining through an
[1:44:26] instrumentality
[1:44:28] proving that it was God in the man.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; He was the word. First John the first
[1:44:35] chapter St. John 1 chapter other says in
[1:44:37] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:44:39] was with God and the word was God and
[1:44:42] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:44:44] us and here was the word of God shining
[1:44:47] through this little frail frame of a man
[1:44:49] and it blinded the organization
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; but he come to get individuals
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; more than a prophet
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; he was a word.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; He is life.
[1:45:08] Not he didn't have to teach you of some
[1:45:10] life to come. He was that life himself.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; He was life. He was light.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; He was life. He was eternal life.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Was in him. And he alone is a giver of
[1:45:25] eternal life.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; He that has the son has life. Yes. Amen.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; So you you can't just have the word
[1:45:34] teaching of him. You've got to have him.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, people sit down and learn
[1:45:38] that Bible and all the Greek words and
[1:45:40] what the definitions are and the
[1:45:42] punctuations and so forth and know more
[1:45:44] about God than nothing."
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; No. He that has he that has the the the
[1:45:52] farm, he that has the plan, it's he that
[1:45:55] has the son
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; that has him the person.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; He's the one that has life.
[1:46:06] Nicodemus knew that he knew about life,
[1:46:09] but he never knew that he was eternal
[1:46:11] life.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the man he was talking to.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; The messenger.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; The light of the day.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; The light of the world.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; The light shining in darkness and the
[1:46:25] darkness comprehended not. He was sent
[1:46:27] to his own. His own received him not.
[1:46:29] Why?
[1:46:30] Why? Because they were so organized,
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; set up with washing pots and pans and
[1:46:35] traditions
[1:46:37] that they failed to see the word made
[1:46:39] flesh.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; It's repeated.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; It's repeated again.
[1:46:47] History repeats itself ever so often.
[1:46:50] Yes, he knew that he had he knew about
[1:46:53] life, but Nicodemus didn't know that he
[1:46:56] was life. That's what it is today. So
[1:46:58] many people try to make Jesus all a
[1:47:00] great teacher. They even try to say he
[1:47:02] was a prophet. But when you try to say
[1:47:04] he was God, that's too much.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; See, but he was God
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; and he is God and he always will be God.
[1:47:13] That's all.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Notice he never told
[1:47:18] Nicodemus. Now when he come to him, he'd
[1:47:21] never said, "Now, Nicodemus, I have
[1:47:23] great respects for you, that you are a a
[1:47:27] master in Israel. I tell you what,
[1:47:29] you're searching eternal life. Perhaps
[1:47:31] you ought to polish up on your
[1:47:33] scholarship. You don't say your words
[1:47:35] right."
[1:47:37] Nonsense.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Or maybe you ought to seek a higher
[1:47:41] office in your denomination to have
[1:47:43] eternal life. That's what so many people
[1:47:45] try to do today.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; A higher office. They want to become
[1:47:50] from a a pastor to a state presbyter or
[1:47:54] to some bishop or something like that.
[1:47:57] That has the more to do with God than
[1:48:00] nothing.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Watch what he did before such a person.
[1:48:07] He rebuked him for his not knowing
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; the hour he was living.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You mean to tell me that you're a
[1:48:17] master in Israel and Caleb understands
[1:48:19] these things?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; When he said a man's got to be born
[1:48:23] again.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Why? He said, "Uh, me, an old man
[1:48:28] entered into my mother's wombs." He
[1:48:29] said, "And you are a bishop, a cardinal,
[1:48:33] a state president in a Pentecostal
[1:48:34] church or somebody else, some great guy
[1:48:37] in the organization, and you don't know
[1:48:40] this scripture."
[1:48:43] Oh, we got Moses. If you would have
[1:48:45] known Moses, you'd have known me because
[1:48:47] he was the one that spoke of me.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; But not according to their traditions,
[1:48:53] their their organization. That was
[1:48:56] different. But Moses did speak of him.
[1:48:58] And he was that one that Moses spoke of.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; And yet they didn't know it. Why? They
[1:49:04] got theirelves so bound down with
[1:49:06] traditions.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; They didn't know it. And my brethren, it
[1:49:10] re takes this tape. Don't turn it off
[1:49:13] now.
[1:49:14] Just a minute. Let's look this thing
[1:49:16] right in the face. I love you.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; You're a shepherd. And I'm not trying to
[1:49:21] be a know-it-all. If I'm making that
[1:49:23] impression, then you stop the tape and
[1:49:25] pray for me. I'm only trying to bring to
[1:49:28] you something that's true.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Don't let it get by you.
[1:49:35] Now, I respect the order of man and so
[1:49:38] forth, but when you make these
[1:49:40] organizations, look at the Pharisees
[1:49:42] would have nothing to do with the
[1:49:43] Sadducees because the Sadducees didn't
[1:49:46] believe in and neither angel or or
[1:49:49] spirit or resurrection or anything. And
[1:49:51] the Pharisees were successful and they
[1:49:53] were at war with one another.
[1:49:56] Now, the oneness be one thing, the
[1:49:58] Trinity believes another, the Methodist
[1:50:00] another, and the Presbyterian another.
[1:50:02] And you draw little lines and what have
[1:50:04] you got? A separation of brotherhood.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; By the way, we'll find that place in the
[1:50:12] Bible in just a little bit. What it is,
[1:50:15] what God says it is. Now,
[1:50:19] no, he never told him to polish up. He's
[1:50:22] just rebuking him for not knowing the
[1:50:24] real thing. Art thou a master in Israel
[1:50:28] and know not these things? If I have
[1:50:31] told you earthly things and you can't
[1:50:34] understand it, think a master,
[1:50:39] a high order
[1:50:41] in an Orthodox church,
[1:50:44] bishop, cardinal,
[1:50:48] and you can't even understand a baby
[1:50:50] form of natural things.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And I tell you, how are you going to
[1:50:55] understand spiritual things from heaven?
[1:50:59] But a ignorant old fisherman who
[1:51:01] couldn't even write his own name
[1:51:03] understood it.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; And was made the head of the church at
[1:51:08] Jerusalem.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; Peter.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, all the father has given me, he will
[1:51:16] come.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; They see it, they believe it, they act
[1:51:21] on it,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; knowing nothing's going to hold them.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:26] Just like the farmer, it's not pleasant
[1:51:30] to put a joke. But to make an
[1:51:32] illustration, they said a farmer set a
[1:51:35] hen and they didn't have enough eggs. He
[1:51:37] put a duck egg under the little duck was
[1:51:39] hatched. He's the funniest looking thing
[1:51:40] them chickens ever saw.
[1:51:42] He had a long funny face and he went
[1:51:45] along quacking instead of clucking and
[1:51:47] and the chickens all eat and pecked in
[1:51:49] the barnyard. And that wasn't his diet
[1:51:52] exactly. So one day the old hen led him
[1:51:55] out behind the barn to catch some
[1:51:57] grasshoppers and over the hill was a a
[1:52:00] lake and the wind happened to come up
[1:52:03] off the lake and he smelt the water.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; It's just his nature.
[1:52:09] The old h said cluck cluck cluck cluck
[1:52:11] come back. He said quack quack quack
[1:52:12] right through the water. Why? He was a
[1:52:15] duck to begin with.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; No matter how much the hen clucked, he
[1:52:19] was still a duck. Amen.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is of a man that's
[1:52:23] predestinated to eternal life. When he
[1:52:26] sees the light of God, the enough
[1:52:28] organizations in the world will tuck him
[1:52:30] back into
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Why? It's his nature.
[1:52:39] [clears throat]
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He might have been dicting with them a
[1:52:40] long time, eating their trash and
[1:52:43] socials, but he comes to a place, he
[1:52:46] finds something different.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; So, he knows it. My sheep know my voice,
[1:52:52] said Jesus.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Stranger they'll not follow.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; They might be following something
[1:52:59] strange, but down in there is something
[1:53:00] different. Let them hear the truth one
[1:53:02] time and watch them.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He rebuked him for not knowing
[1:53:11] thou art the master in Israel and know
[1:53:12] about these things. You must be born
[1:53:15] again. Now the natural man I want tell
[1:53:19] you to notice something here. You must
[1:53:22] be born again. Now natural life if we
[1:53:26] have natural life in order to be active
[1:53:29] in this natural life in natural things
[1:53:32] we have to have a natural birth.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; They don't just jerk you off of a tree
[1:53:39] somewhere.
[1:53:41] See stick you out some way. They've
[1:53:44] tried it but it didn't work.
[1:53:46] It's got to be an actual birth, natural
[1:53:51] birth to make you active so you can have
[1:53:54] the five senses. Walk, talk, see, taste,
[1:53:58] feel, smell, hear, move around, so
[1:54:00] forth. Because you're then a human being
[1:54:02] and you're you're subject to all these
[1:54:04] things because they go into the natural
[1:54:06] life.
[1:54:08] And in such a birth sometimes we become
[1:54:12] very wise in worldly wisdom.
[1:54:16] Uh are the affairs of the world become
[1:54:20] presidents and and great scholars and
[1:54:24] master mechanics and scientists and so
[1:54:27] forth. And you always know from the very
[1:54:30] beginning it was Cain's children that
[1:54:33] had that kind of wisdom.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Not say us.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. They were humble sheep men. But
[1:54:40] Seaest children were godly people. But
[1:54:44] Cain's children was always smart. H
[1:54:50] science doctors and great man.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; That's right. The Bible said so. You
[1:54:55] know that teaches that. And very
[1:54:58] religious but perished at the end.
[1:55:04] We become wise by going to school,
[1:55:07] taking scholarship and so forth. We
[1:55:10] become very wise, smart, and can do
[1:55:14] things and say things and sometimes
[1:55:17] outalk a man that's spiritfilled.
[1:55:20] Didn't Jesus say the children of this
[1:55:22] world is wiser than the children of the
[1:55:25] kingdom?
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; Sure. Because they by their intellects
[1:55:32] that they can can talk and outsmart and
[1:55:37] out talk and take the scriptures and
[1:55:39] twist it to make it say things that it
[1:55:41] doesn't.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, it doesn't exactly mean that. When a
[1:55:45] man says that, get away from him.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; God watches over his word. You know the
[1:55:51] Bible says
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; it's wrote just the way it should be.
[1:55:54] Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Now it's put in such a way to deceive or
[1:55:58] to make the wise stumble over it.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It's so simple. That's the reason they
[1:56:03] stumble over it.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; All right. All this wisdom and things
[1:56:07] that they can accumulate yet
[1:56:11] but it is from that birth is from
[1:56:14] beneath. This earth is from the earth
[1:56:18] and it is against the spirit of God.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; The first birth to make us active here
[1:56:27] makes us mortal man because of the sin
[1:56:30] act at the garden made man come into the
[1:56:33] world by a woman and a man that is born
[1:56:36] of a woman is of a few days but a man
[1:56:38] that is born of Christ is eternal.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Job said a man that's born of a woman is
[1:56:43] few days and full of trouble.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; Notice but a man that's born of Christ
[1:56:48] has to be born from above.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, but a man that's born to the
[1:56:53] earth become wise and can almost
[1:56:57] outsmart.
[1:56:59] Look how shrewd the devil was. He fooled
[1:57:01] every priest to come on the earth.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; He surely he fooled. He's still doing
[1:57:06] it.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Sure did. He was smart.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; But he come up against his match one day
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; who defeated him. And the only thing we
[1:57:16] have to do is lay against him. He's
[1:57:18] already defeated him.
[1:57:20] Amen.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; But it's from beneath. And it this
[1:57:24] wisdom that man accumulate to prove and
[1:57:28] show all these things why man should do
[1:57:30] this and man should do that. It's
[1:57:32] contrary and [clears throat] immity the
[1:57:34] carnal mind to God. The scripture said
[1:57:37] so.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Right. No matter how smart they can
[1:57:40] twist it around. I want somebody to show
[1:57:42] me where God ever had an organization or
[1:57:44] ever commanded one. But what condemns it
[1:57:47] here in the Bible.
[1:57:49] No matter how smart they can try to be,
[1:57:51] it's contrary how the wisdom can stand
[1:57:54] and out argue to you and make you feel
[1:57:56] that little by telling you about it. But
[1:57:57] it's contrary to the scriptures.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody said to me, "Brother Brand,
[1:58:05] there's one thing I got against you."
[1:58:07] Said, "You're Jesus only." I said, "I am
[1:58:08] not.
[1:58:10] I don't belong to any organization."
[1:58:13] A presenter of a certain state sent to
[1:58:15] the day and said, "Someone told me you
[1:58:17] were Jesus only. Brother Ram I said that
[1:58:19] is contrary that is wrong said they told
[1:58:22] me that you believe in free love that
[1:58:24] man should leave their wives and hunt I
[1:58:26] see that's just lies of the devil
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; you know that
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; I said I absolutely am against such
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; unscriptural things
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; I believe in holiness and purity
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; I believe that man is bound to his wife
[1:58:42] as long as he live
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; right
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; you shouldn't take her without praying
[1:58:46] first
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; And Jesus only, the Jesus only group.
[1:58:52] Nothing against them. They're just as
[1:58:53] good as any group to me. But they
[1:58:55] baptize. Wrong. They baptize to
[1:58:58] regeneration.
[1:59:00] I believe that we're regenerated by the
[1:59:02] Holy Spirit, not the water.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; I do use the name of Jesus Christ in
[1:59:07] baptism. And there's not another
[1:59:10] scripture in the Bible to b to make it
[1:59:12] contrary. There was nobody in the Bible
[1:59:15] ever baptized in the name of father,
[1:59:17] son, holy ghost.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; I want somebody to come show me one
[1:59:20] place one person's baptized like that.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; If it's unscriptural, quit doing it.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; He said it doesn't make any difference.
[1:59:27] It did to Paul.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He commanded be baptized over again in
[1:59:31] the name of Jesus Christ and then
[1:59:33] receive the Holy Ghost. And Paul said,
[1:59:35] "If an angel from heaven, Galatians 1:8,
[1:59:38] come taught any other gospel than that
[1:59:39] he had taught, let it be accured."
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; See, it's tradition.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; I talked to a great man not long ago
[1:59:48] said, "Brother Bam, I can't I know
[1:59:49] that's right." He said, "But what can I
[1:59:52] do about it?" I said, "Obey it."
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, I I have a prestige
[2:00:00] amongst our people." I said, "But I want
[2:00:02] a prestige with God to obey his word.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; You got to take your choice. Will you
[2:00:07] serve God or man?"
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they get their
[2:00:11] organization, set these declarations in
[2:00:14] them, follow right down. The first time
[2:00:15] that was ever used is in the Roman
[2:00:17] Catholic Church. That's
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; right. I want somebody to show me
[2:00:20] something different.
[2:00:22] I read history through, you know. So
[2:00:25] remember, that's a Catholic baptism. And
[2:00:27] everyone that's baptized that way is
[2:00:29] baptized into the Catholic fellowship. I
[2:00:32] prove it before the night's over, the
[2:00:34] Lord willing.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you must come back.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Not the Jesus only. Now, there's plenty
[2:00:43] of fine men in the Jesus only church.
[2:00:45] Plenty of fine men in the assemblies of
[2:00:46] God, the church of God, Methodist,
[2:00:48] Baptist, Presbyterian, and Catholic.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; But there's none of them in the church.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Not a one of them. These individuals in
[2:00:59] there belongs in the church, but it
[2:01:00] ain't that denomination they got that
[2:01:02] makes them the church.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Like man try to make it that way. It's
[2:01:05] wrong. Just a minute. We get down giving
[2:01:07] you some scripture in a few moments.
[2:01:10] Yes, to be active on earth you have to
[2:01:13] be born natural to be active and such a
[2:01:16] birth makes us wise as I have said see
[2:01:19] and we become smart intelligence our
[2:01:21] intellects gives us that but remember
[2:01:24] that that birth the very beginning of it
[2:01:26] is contrary
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; amen it's earthly and contrary to the
[2:01:31] word of God foolish to God and to his
[2:01:34] plan ignorant to God's plan
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; if it wasn't
[2:01:39] Nicodemus would have known more than
[2:01:41] Jesus knew about him.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; See it. Art thou a master in Israel.
[2:01:47] Amen. See where your denominations go.
[2:01:50] Where your great smart men who meet
[2:01:52] together and draw out their plans and
[2:01:54] set. Let me tell you this. Every time
[2:01:56] God sends a light on the earth on
[2:01:58] something on the scripture, they run
[2:01:59] right away with it. And as soon as that
[2:02:00] man's gone, they make an organization
[2:02:02] out of it. And as soon as they organize
[2:02:04] it, I want to ask any historian here
[2:02:07] present now or it's on tapes to come
[2:02:09] show me at any time that man, every
[2:02:13] organized the church had died right
[2:02:15] there and never did raise again.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; It's contrary to God.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; It's contrary to the scriptures.
[2:02:24] Therefore, I'm against it.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Anything that God's against, if God's in
[2:02:28] me, then I'm against what God's against.
[2:02:30] His enemy is my enemy. Yes. Amen.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; His church is my church.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; His life is my life. He gave his life.
[2:02:38] He become me that I through his grace
[2:02:40] might become like him.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; We changed places. He become a sinner
[2:02:45] like me and died for me in my place so
[2:02:48] that I could be a son of God.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Like he was.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Now you see where your denomination's
[2:02:53] got to already. We started.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. wise in the worldly wisdom but
[2:03:00] dead to God's plan.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Now let's you back stop here just a
[2:03:06] moment.
[2:03:08] Adam was contrary to God's plans
[2:03:13] because he disobeyed the word tried to
[2:03:16] make himself a covering a religion. It
[2:03:19] failed and it's always failed what man
[2:03:22] tries to do. Nimrod was wrong.
[2:03:28] Kora perished.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; What were they trying to do? Make an
[2:03:32] organization.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; And after that, when they finally
[2:03:38] organized themselves, Jesus found them
[2:03:43] dead.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Said, "You got eyes and you can't see.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; You got ears and you can't hear." Hey,
[2:03:52] said you're blind leading the blind. If
[2:03:55] the blind leads the blind, don't they
[2:03:57] both fall in the ditch?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "Thou art a master in Israel
[2:04:02] and can't even understand what the new
[2:04:03] birth is. When if you would have kept
[2:04:06] away from them traditions and held on to
[2:04:08] the word, you'd have known that I was
[2:04:10] coming to give man new birth."
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You'd have known my day.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; If you'd have known Moses, you'd have
[2:04:17] known me. Moses spoke of me
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; and he said I would come and here I am.
[2:04:25] And if I don't do the things that Moses
[2:04:27] and the prophets said I would do, then
[2:04:29] don't believe me.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; If I don't do the works of God, then
[2:04:34] don't believe me. But if you can't
[2:04:35] believe me being a man, and if you can't
[2:04:38] believe me because I'm a man and doing
[2:04:40] the works of God, believe the works for
[2:04:43] they testify of the things that I'm
[2:04:45] doing.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:47] Amen.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; But then I ask today if he had lived on
[2:04:52] earth today, the assemblies of God had
[2:04:54] one, the oneness had one, and everybody
[2:04:56] would have a Jesus.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Sure, their denominations got to pack
[2:05:00] the ball.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; See, if it isn't going, they're not
[2:05:03] separating brotherhood. I remember a
[2:05:06] little boy named little David.
[2:05:08] He's a man married now. I guess got a
[2:05:10] family. I remember when he first
[2:05:12] started, I went to St. Louis. I've heard
[2:05:13] little boy preachers that he get up and
[2:05:15] say Jesus a little boy born in a manger.
[2:05:18] Mommy, what was the rest of that? But
[2:05:20] not that little boy. He'd throw off his
[2:05:23] coat, tuck a text, and preach.
[2:05:25] But what was he? He happened to be a
[2:05:27] Jesus only. His father, Mr. Walker,
[2:05:30] belonged to Jesus only. While the
[2:05:32] assemblies couldn't stand that, they had
[2:05:33] to get them a little David while the
[2:05:35] rest of them had to get them a little
[2:05:36] David. And one time when the little boy
[2:05:38] was holding a meeting down in Florida,
[2:05:40] he called me, "Come down and help him."
[2:05:42] And brother Moore and I read the two
[2:05:44] pages of the front part of the paper
[2:05:47] with nothing but little David's. Every
[2:05:49] church had a little David.
[2:05:52] Oh goodness. Well, if a bunch of the
[2:05:55] elders of God had to recognize the gift
[2:05:57] in that little fella, he would have
[2:05:58] swept thousands of souls into the
[2:06:00] kingdom. See, tell him forget his
[2:06:03] tradition about man and this like that.
[2:06:05] God had a gift in his life. Use it. When
[2:06:08] divine healing was first represented,
[2:06:09] everybody had a feeling in their hands
[2:06:11] and could smell his oh my.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; They had to do it.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Their organization was in the back race.
[2:06:19] See, you've got your organizations the
[2:06:22] head of the plan of God. You
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; But God has his church going on just the
[2:06:28] same.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; A mystical body.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; You don't join that. You're born in it.
[2:06:32] Hallelujah.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Wise and wisdom of the world but dead in
[2:06:36] God's plans. Tell me then,
[2:06:40] tell me then.
[2:06:43] You can tell them and prove to them that
[2:06:47] they are wrong by God's word and promise
[2:06:51] and still they won't see it.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; I can sit right down and take the word
[2:06:57] and show you that denomination is wrong.
[2:07:00] I can show you that creeds that you have
[2:07:02] today is wrong.
[2:07:04] See these church creeds. Sure it's wrong
[2:07:06] and they'll say, "Well, uh, we've been
[2:07:08] taught to believe this." You see, to my
[2:07:12] opinion, it's it's fodder. If you know
[2:07:15] what I'm talking about, cannon fodder,
[2:07:17] you know, that's right. They can't see.
[2:07:20] Jesus said, "You you can't see it. You
[2:07:23] might come to me and have life." There
[2:07:26] was Nicodemus, an honorable man, a great
[2:07:28] man, a bishop in his church, renowned
[2:07:30] man, loved by everybody and come to
[2:07:32] Jesus and know no more about life than a
[2:07:35] than nothing did.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; He was very ignorant of it. When Jesus
[2:07:39] rebuked him for it,
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; but he was sincere enough to come. The
[2:07:44] rest of them wouldn't even come. They
[2:07:45] stood off with the high priest and with
[2:07:48] the bishop so and so and so and so,
[2:07:50] right? They stood off with them. rather
[2:07:52] taking in the traditions of their elders
[2:07:54] than to hear the word of God.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Now you can tell them they won't listen
[2:08:00] to it. You can just exactly could you
[2:08:03] imagine I want to ask you something. I
[2:08:05] don't mean this sacriiggious now
[2:08:07] brethren says the tape. I don't mean
[2:08:09] this sacrilegious. Could you imagine me
[2:08:12] going out here and and a knot on the
[2:08:15] tree could ask me how in the world do
[2:08:17] you walk around like you do?
[2:08:21] I got life. I'm a knot on this tree.
[2:08:25] He can prove he's got life, but it's the
[2:08:27] wrong kind.
[2:08:29] If he wants to walk around, the only way
[2:08:31] he would ever be walk around, see,
[2:08:32] taste, feel, smell, and hear, if he
[2:08:34] could talk and say to me, and ask that,
[2:08:36] the only way he'd have to be born the
[2:08:38] same way that I'm born.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; He'll never understand it any other way.
[2:08:46] Amen.
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; But if he's born the same way that I'm
[2:08:50] born, then he'll know the things that I
[2:08:52] know.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yes, sir. You can't tell a knot
[2:09:03] of the tree how we move about and be
[2:09:07] active. You would have to receive our
[2:09:10] kind of life to understand it. Same with
[2:09:15] the spirit.
[2:09:18] The same thing is with the spirit. Or
[2:09:21] you can't understand it.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; There's no need of trying to figure it
[2:09:26] all out. Just come to him first.
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; For except the man be born again, he
[2:09:31] can't even see the kingdom. He said
[2:09:33] that's understanding. You've got to be
[2:09:35] born again in order to know it.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Well, you say I'm born again and deny
[2:09:40] the word.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; How can you be? Your own life gives you
[2:09:45] vindication of it.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Your own group that you're joined with,
[2:09:51] birds of a feather,
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; wait till we get down to those things in
[2:09:57] a few minutes.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Comes by the spirit. How can you tell
[2:10:01] people things of the spirit that's not
[2:10:03] born of the spirit? You have to be born
[2:10:05] of the spirit to understand the things
[2:10:07] of the spirit.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; The Jesus said, "The wind bloweth where
[2:10:10] it listeth." I cannot tell which way it
[2:10:12] comes or where it goes. See, so is
[2:10:14] everyone born of the spirit, they can't
[2:10:15] tell you. A man that's born in the
[2:10:17] spirit don't take no thought.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; He lets God do the thinking.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; You think I could stand on a platform
[2:10:24] here, take a thought and tell a man back
[2:10:25] there, his name's John, go and he come
[2:10:27] from so and so place. He done this, he
[2:10:29] married another woman back there 20
[2:10:30] years ago and he had children, but this
[2:10:32] woman he has to take this thing back and
[2:10:33] do that. You think taking thought I
[2:10:35] could do that?
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; No such wisdom in this birth here on
[2:10:38] earth for that.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; It's beyond that.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has to come from above.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Then when you're born of the spirit
[2:10:45] above, the life that was in him who did
[2:10:48] do those things said, "The works that I
[2:10:50] do shall you do also."
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; Your birth has to be changed. You've
[2:10:57] been deceived. You might have spoke in
[2:10:58] tongues. You might have jumped up and
[2:11:00] down. You might have shouted. You might
[2:11:02] have done all this, that, and the other.
[2:11:03] You might have been a a loyal member. So
[2:11:05] was Nicodemus.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hey, but he lacked the birth. And when
[2:11:11] you deny the word, try to place it
[2:11:13] somewhere else and do something to it
[2:11:15] and scatter it away like that. And Jesus
[2:11:18] said, "These signs shall follow them
[2:11:20] that believe. Go into all the world and
[2:11:22] preach the gospel to every creature.
[2:11:25] Long as the gospel is being preached,
[2:11:26] these signs shall follow."
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Tell me the place where you ever tuck it
[2:11:30] away from the church.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Show me the scripture where he said
[2:11:32] every just for so long. He said, "Unto
[2:11:34] all the world and to every creature.
[2:11:37] Yes, you'd have to receive the kind of
[2:11:40] life that he had in order to live his
[2:11:43] life. And when you see his life, then
[2:11:45] you will know his word.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. When he personal pronoun,
[2:11:50] not a thought, not an imagination, not a
[2:11:54] sensation, but when he, the Holy Ghost,
[2:11:56] has come,
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; he will take these things that I've told
[2:12:00] you and reveal them to you and will show
[2:12:03] you things that is to come.
[2:12:06] Hallelujah.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; That's the birth.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; That's a vindication that it is word.
[2:12:11] And when a man says he's got the Holy
[2:12:12] Ghost and deny the word of God and place
[2:12:14] it somewhere else, how can the Holy
[2:12:16] Ghost deny his own word?
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Not show me organization in the word.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:12:28] Could you think of a businessman?
[2:12:32] Now, here's how far our church is
[2:12:33] behind. Could you think of a businessman
[2:12:36] that started up a business sharing it's
[2:12:38] a it's really a thriving business and
[2:12:40] he's got to get some help right quick
[2:12:42] and he go to a bunch of dead man corpses
[2:12:44] and saying would you come work for me
[2:12:47] that'd be no benefit to him
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; that's the reason the organization never
[2:12:53] li rises again
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; a bunch of dead
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; unbelief
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; congregating themselves together like
[2:13:03] Nimrod God like Kora, like down through
[2:13:06] the age. How can he never did use it?
[2:13:08] Never did use organization. He can't do
[2:13:10] it.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; It's already out of the will of God.
[2:13:13] It's passed beyond that.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; It's out of reach. It's out of search.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; How could you go to a man that couldn't
[2:13:19] move? Paralyzed head, hand, and foot.
[2:13:21] Tell him you want to run a foot race for
[2:13:23] you. Run this race with patience. Lay
[2:13:24] aside.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; How could he do it when the man can't
[2:13:27] move? He's paralyzed.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; You've got to get the paralytic off of
[2:13:31] him first. Amen.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Then he can run.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; That's what the organization needs.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; Is the divine healing.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; I hope I don't find sound critical. See,
[2:13:46] I'm not criticizing, but if a nail isn't
[2:13:48] clenched, it pulls out easy.
[2:13:56] That's why the Holy Spirit can't use a
[2:13:59] denomination as soon as it Remember, I
[2:14:03] believe that Martin Luther had the Holy
[2:14:07] Spirit.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Maybe not the portion it is
[2:14:10] today because it wasn't given out. We've
[2:14:11] been through this, you people of
[2:14:12] tabernacles, you're on the blackboard.
[2:14:15] But he did believe to God, and he that
[2:14:17] believeth has everlasting life.
[2:14:20] I never thought there's a person believe
[2:14:21] that like me until this morning you
[2:14:22] heard Charles Fuller as it was going
[2:14:24] down. He believes too that the new birth
[2:14:27] is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:14:28] The new birth is being born. The Holy
[2:14:30] Ghost is a baptism.
[2:14:33] All right. Now we find
[2:14:36] that this man has got to be born again
[2:14:40] in order to be active. All right. to be
[2:14:43] born of the flesh,
[2:14:46] then you have wisdom of the world and
[2:14:49] wisdom of the world obeys its fleshly
[2:14:53] teacher.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Right? That's exactly why men that don't
[2:14:58] have the new birth and tell them the
[2:15:00] word of God, they'll obey their bishop,
[2:15:03] their presitter or their organization
[2:15:05] instead of the word of life.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Why? It knows nothing else but that.
[2:15:10] Well, you know, someday I might be a
[2:15:11] presbbiter. Why? Nicodemus was a master.
[2:15:15] That's beyond a preset. That was beyond
[2:15:18] a a pastor. That was be a master in
[2:15:22] Israel.
[2:15:24] Yes. And he was a great man. He belonged
[2:15:27] to this group and know no more about God
[2:15:29] than nothing. See, only notice some
[2:15:32] history. What good's a historical God if
[2:15:34] he isn't the same today?
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; What's good is a God of Moses if he
[2:15:38] isn't the same God today? Amen.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; What's good of a God that could save a
[2:15:42] man on a cross that couldn't save one in
[2:15:43] the same condition today? As I've always
[2:15:46] said, what good does it do to give your
[2:15:48] canary bird uh good seeds and vitamins
[2:15:51] to make him have good strong wings and
[2:15:52] fine feathers and put him in a cage?
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; I don't get it. Try to tell him about a
[2:16:00] god of power and things and stick him
[2:16:02] into an organization. Don't even believe
[2:16:03] in such a thing.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; It's all out. That's the reason it
[2:16:07] fails. He's dead. You can't use it. God
[2:16:09] never used it. Just think the Holy
[2:16:11] Spirit never did at any time use an
[2:16:14] organization.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Nowhere scripture or nowhere historical.
[2:16:20] If anybody on this tape or present can
[2:16:22] show me where the Holy Spirit took an
[2:16:24] organization and made a move in the
[2:16:26] earth, come tell me.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; I want you to tell me the history book
[2:16:30] it come from.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; You know it's not in the scripture. So I
[2:16:34] want you to show me the history it come
[2:16:36] from. God never used anything like that.
[2:16:38] He uses an individual
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; always.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; All right. To be born of the spirit. Now
[2:16:46] to be born of the flesh and have wisdom
[2:16:49] of the world. The wisdom will obey its
[2:16:53] fleshly teacher. To be born of the
[2:16:56] spirit is to believe and obey the
[2:17:00] teaching of the Bible by the Holy Ghost.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And a man that's born by the
[2:17:05] spirit will obey God's word regardless
[2:17:08] of what any tradition tells him.
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; Just said
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; you're reborn. That's the reason you see
[2:17:16] to belong to an organization.
[2:17:19] Put all your hopes in that. Now I don't
[2:17:21] say people in organizations not born
[2:17:23] again. Now I'll get to that in a few
[2:17:25] minutes. Lord willing. Sure they are.
[2:17:27] But they're individuals. Not the
[2:17:28] organizations born again. The
[2:17:30] individuals in there are born again. But
[2:17:33] the organization only breaks him away
[2:17:34] from God. That's all it does. Separates
[2:17:37] him.
[2:17:39] All right? Regardless
[2:17:41] of the flesh denomination
[2:17:45] teaches, the flesh it's always contrary
[2:17:49] to the will of God. To be born again
[2:17:54] means be birthed from above.
[2:17:58] Again means from above.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; I guess you know that.
[2:18:02] To be born again means to be birthed
[2:18:04] from above.
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; A year. See, you can study it if you
[2:18:08] want to in the lesson. See, means a
[2:18:11] birth that's come from above because
[2:18:13] you've been born here. Now, to be born
[2:18:15] again, you have to be born from up here.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; To be born again, then that kingdom is
[2:18:20] so much higher than this kingdom, so
[2:18:23] much greater than this kingdom. So, this
[2:18:26] kingdom is foolish to that, and that's
[2:18:28] foolish to this.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I've often said, me and my wife
[2:18:32] here not long ago went over to get some
[2:18:34] groceries along a few months ago and we
[2:18:36] seen a woman had on a skirt. It was the
[2:18:40] strangest thing we'd ever seen a long
[2:18:41] time.
[2:18:43] Well, this morning,
[2:18:46] I don't say this sacriiggious. I heard
[2:18:48] one of the great famous organizations
[2:18:50] and my daughter and I was listening to
[2:18:53] the radios. We went to dedicate a church
[2:18:55] and a song they sang some kind of a
[2:18:57] something together by so and so some
[2:18:59] that classical singing. It sounds to me
[2:19:01] like women holding their breath till
[2:19:03] they're blue in a face. Man think that's
[2:19:05] singing that's squeaking. I like good
[2:19:08] old Pentecostal singing right from your
[2:19:10] heart. You couldn't carry a tune in a
[2:19:12] cold bucket but yet you're singing
[2:19:14] making a joyful noise to the Lord. I
[2:19:16] think that's spiritual. I like it.
[2:19:18] without holding your breath that you
[2:19:20] just blew in the face and die away and
[2:19:23] come back who you don't even know
[2:19:24] yourself what you're saying how you
[2:19:25] expect anybody else to know that's Jesus
[2:19:28] said we speak them things we know that's
[2:19:31] right that's right what we are do sing
[2:19:34] what we know in our heart what we feel
[2:19:36] and when they got through my daughter
[2:19:38] studies music and and she said brother
[2:19:41] she said that was really a classic I
[2:19:43] said yes but how many out of that choir
[2:19:48] of out of 50 people do you think that
[2:19:51] had cigarettes on their breath?
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; How many of that choir you think last
[2:19:58] night being Saturday night didn't have a
[2:19:59] little social drink?
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; How many women in there had bobbed hair?
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; How many had paint on when the pastor of
[2:20:09] the church said a few days ago, "God
[2:20:11] made a prettier world when he invented
[2:20:13] paint."
[2:20:15] when we know that this one woman in the
[2:20:18] Bible painted her face and God fed her
[2:20:20] to the dog.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; And we anybody that knows anything about
[2:20:25] the church and about heathens knows that
[2:20:28] paint is a heathen trait always been.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; And yet women do it.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Men smoking, drinking, carrying on and
[2:20:39] stand there and sing voices like that.
[2:20:41] We'll get to it in a few minutes right
[2:20:43] here. All right. Belong to an
[2:20:46] organizational thinking with there's
[2:20:48] going to be the disappointment of
[2:20:50] judgment. My opinion to be born of the
[2:20:52] spirit is to believe and behave yourself
[2:20:56] in the spirit is to understand and
[2:20:59] believe with your heart that Jesus is
[2:21:02] Christ and this is his word. that no
[2:21:05] other words can be added to it or taken
[2:21:08] away from it without your name taken out
[2:21:10] of the book of life.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; That was a strong one.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; If you add one thing to it in your
[2:21:18] tradition or take one thing from it, uh
[2:21:21] Christ said himself, your name shall be
[2:21:24] rubbed off the book of life.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; Now find organization, denomination in
[2:21:30] the Bible.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; You'll run from it. All right.
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; Regardless of the flesh,
[2:21:39] denomination teaching is contrary to the
[2:21:42] Bible.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Born again means a new birth from above.
[2:21:47] Birth from above. Then we are active in
[2:21:50] the things from above.
[2:21:54] Oh my. For it is himself acting in his
[2:21:59] word to you his branch to the vine.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's the reason Jesus said, "If I do
[2:22:06] not the works of my father, believe me
[2:22:08] not."
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, certainly. He said, "No man has
[2:22:13] ascended up to heaven, but he that come
[2:22:16] down from heaven." Watch him fix
[2:22:18] Nicodemus here. When Nicodemus, you
[2:22:20] know, they thought him being a man, he
[2:22:21] couldn't be God. And he said, and there
[2:22:24] he said, "No man has ascended up to
[2:22:26] heaven, but he that came down from
[2:22:29] heaven, even the son of man which is now
[2:22:31] in heaven.
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; That was too much for him."
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; How could he, the son of man, come down
[2:22:42] from heaven, come down from heaven? Was
[2:22:45] the same that ascended up to heaven? And
[2:22:47] the same one that's standing here on top
[2:22:49] of this house talking to Nicodemus is
[2:22:51] now in heaven.
[2:22:53] Well, he ought to have seen that it was
[2:22:55] God. He's ominant present everywhere.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; But he and his traditions didn't know
[2:23:02] that he was a spiritual mind of the
[2:23:04] carnal mind. He couldn't catch it.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "Who does man say I, the son of
[2:23:09] man am?" Some says, "Well, he's the son
[2:23:12] of David." He says, "Then why did David
[2:23:15] in the spirit call him Lord? Say, "The
[2:23:18] Lord said unto my Lord, set thou on my
[2:23:20] right hand till I make thy pose a
[2:23:22] foottool." How he is both root and
[2:23:25] offspring of David.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; He is before David. He was David. And
[2:23:29] after David
[2:23:32] Lord,
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; he is a root and offspring of David. The
[2:23:34] Bible said so. Both root and offspring
[2:23:37] of David. How could he be his son?
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; How could he be his law?
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; The Bible said from henceforth they
[2:23:44] asked him nothing. I guess it was a good
[2:23:47] thing too.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; All right. Born again from above. Then
[2:23:53] we are active
[2:23:55] active in things from above.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; And for his life is in us, which is his
[2:24:04] word of vindicating
[2:24:08] the word itself. The spirit that's in
[2:24:10] you is the word made flesh in you.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; The spirit minds the word
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; and is active in vindicating the word.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Now the spirit is not active in any
[2:24:25] denomination.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; It's not interested in making
[2:24:29] organizations
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; because the spirit itself is contrary to
[2:24:34] the organization.
[2:24:36] The organization are looking for worldly
[2:24:38] things, the mind of the world and to
[2:24:40] make big temples and polished things and
[2:24:42] great polish organizations and polished
[2:24:44] preachers and so forth like that and the
[2:24:47] best class in the city where the spirit
[2:24:49] is trying to find honest hearts.
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit is anxious to manifest
[2:24:56] and prove that every word of God is
[2:24:59] true.
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:01] How can you How can the spirit work in
[2:25:03] an organization when it's denying taking
[2:25:06] creeds instead of the word?
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Can't do it. So you see it's dead. God
[2:25:11] don't go to them kind of places to find
[2:25:13] his a group of men that work for him
[2:25:15] because they're already dead. They're
[2:25:16] unbelievers in the word or wouldn't be
[2:25:18] in there.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:25:21] we are active in the things from above.
[2:25:24] Now the spirit minds the word. That's
[2:25:27] right. Because the spirit gives the word
[2:25:30] life.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; See, the letter killth, the spirit
[2:25:33] giveth life. Now, I was coming up today
[2:25:37] looking at the great beautiful trees out
[2:25:39] over the forest, the big hills, brown,
[2:25:42] yellow, evergreen dotted in them. I
[2:25:44] said, "You know what that is?" I said,
[2:25:46] "We just had death and God has put his
[2:25:49] bouquet out, sticking them up on the
[2:25:51] hills. It's a funeral.
[2:25:54] The life has gone back into the dust.
[2:25:56] God's just buried all these seeds out of
[2:25:58] the flowers and things, buried them
[2:26:00] back, and he's just bloomed out his
[2:26:01] bulky. He's looking up over the earth
[2:26:03] because his funeral flowers.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; But when the sun rises again,
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; That seed shall take life again.
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; All right. The spirit is interested in
[2:26:20] vindicating the word. And if you've
[2:26:22] accepted tradition instead of the word,
[2:26:25] now you say, "Well, we believe it all,
[2:26:27] but brother Bram, I know we don't
[2:26:28] believe this." Then right there's where
[2:26:29] you stop.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Chaplain told me one time and he at
[2:26:35] captain said, or I believe it was a
[2:26:36] major said, "Chaplap, go over there.
[2:26:39] There's a captain dying. He's been
[2:26:40] machine gunned." He want the captain was
[2:26:43] struggling. They pulled him into a Red
[2:26:45] Cross tent and he said, "Captain, you
[2:26:48] looked up through the gurgles of blood."
[2:26:50] He said, "Yes, sir. And he said, "Uh,
[2:26:52] you're the chaplain?" "Yes." He said,
[2:26:54] "You're a dying, captain." He said, "I
[2:26:56] know it." He said, "Are you a
[2:26:57] Christian?" He said, "I used to be."
[2:26:59] Said, "Where did you leave him,
[2:27:00] Captain?" He said, "You'll find him
[2:27:03] right where you left him." Correct.
[2:27:06] Captain said, "I can't think." The
[2:27:07] chaplain said, "You'd better. You
[2:27:10] haven't got by a couple more minutes
[2:27:11] while you're struggling." Mouth coming
[2:27:13] open, the blood coming from his mouth
[2:27:15] and ears, and machine gun bullets across
[2:27:17] you better hurry. Your lungs are filling
[2:27:19] up. And the captain began to wander
[2:27:22] laying there as he's struggling a smile
[2:27:24] come over his face said I know now said
[2:27:26] where did you leave him start right
[2:27:27] there he said now I lay me down to sleep
[2:27:31] that's where he left him that's where he
[2:27:32] finds him when your organization teaches
[2:27:35] something contrary to the word you leave
[2:27:37] him right there
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; come right back because he's active in
[2:27:40] vindicating and making that word true
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; that's what Jesus was always doing the
[2:27:45] will of the father see all right so see
[2:27:48] Nicodemus organiz ization understanding
[2:27:51] meant nothing to God. Now no matter if
[2:27:54] he is a big shot as we call it in the
[2:27:56] organization a master in Israel all of
[2:27:59] his learning and understanding didn't
[2:28:01] mean that when he stood before Christ
[2:28:03] only a rebuke to him.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; Now I imagine all the people say holy
[2:28:08] father Nicodemus
[2:28:10] holy father Nicodemus we bow to you sir
[2:28:13] but when Jesus he stood before God he
[2:28:16] rebuked him for his ignorance.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what all that goes to.
[2:28:20] Forget it. Come on. Let's go to God.
[2:28:23] &gt;&gt; Right. All right.
[2:28:25] Neither did Kora's great understanding
[2:28:29] mean anything or Adam's each denying
[2:28:32] God's vindicated message. Now let's
[2:28:36] listen close now. We're going to get in
[2:28:37] some high waters in a minute.
[2:28:42] See each one of them. The reason that
[2:28:45] they got in trouble, Nicodemus,
[2:28:48] Kora, Nimrod,
[2:28:52] and so forth, is because they didn't
[2:28:56] recognize God's messenger with the
[2:29:00] vindicated word of that day.
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; Now, anyone knows that. Uh uh we could
[2:29:07] stay on that a long time. But God
[2:29:11] predicts and says a certain thing will
[2:29:13] take place. Man makes organizations,
[2:29:17] gets man set just exactly. They believe
[2:29:19] there was a coming Messiah. All them
[2:29:21] Jews. Well my sure. But when Jesus come
[2:29:24] the way he did, they said that can't be
[2:29:26] him.
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; They failed to understand the word.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus didn't come contrary to the
[2:29:33] word, did he? But he come contrary to
[2:29:36] the organization interpretation of the
[2:29:38] word.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't come contrary to the word.
[2:29:42] He come exactly with the word. But Kora
[2:29:45] failed to see it.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; And all down through it's been that way.
[2:29:51] Now look,
[2:29:53] this message of the day just can't be
[2:29:56] something said we got the truth and we
[2:29:58] got this that. It has to be fortold in
[2:30:01] his word. And then after the word is
[2:30:04] brought forth, it has to be properly
[2:30:08] vindicated by the word.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus was properly
[2:30:16] vindicated of God by the word.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you'd have known Moses,
[2:30:22] you'd have known of my days."
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Well, did the prophets speak of him.
[2:30:27] Well, all the prophets said what he was
[2:30:30] and yet it blinded them. They couldn't
[2:30:33] understand it. See, but Jesus was I
[2:30:37] don't I want to say this for the tape
[2:30:39] and for you too. See the messenger
[2:30:44] with the message of the day. Now, if you
[2:30:48] go the Seventh Day Adventist say, "We
[2:30:50] got her skip the Sabbath." You show me
[2:30:52] that in the scriptures.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Miss Eddie Baker said she had it.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Show it to me.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Witness said they had it. Show
[2:31:03] it to me.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; Methodist say they got it. Show it to
[2:31:07] me.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Baptist say they got it. Show it to me.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Show me any organizations. I'm proving
[2:31:14] to you that they're everyone out of the
[2:31:16] will of God.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; Every one of them contrary.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Teaching traditions of man instead of
[2:31:22] the word of God. That's right.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know of one of them that would
[2:31:26] accept the things that's really written
[2:31:27] in the Bible the way it is.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Right. But when somebody comes by and
[2:31:32] said, "I got the message of the day." He
[2:31:34] must properly be seen first and foretold
[2:31:37] to come.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist walked out there. They
[2:31:41] said, "Are you the Christ?" He said,
[2:31:42] "I'm not."
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Are are you the Elijah?" He said,
[2:31:47] "I am not."
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who are you?" He could
[2:31:51] identify himself. He had the message of
[2:31:53] an hour.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the boson crying in the
[2:31:56] wilderness and said the prophet Isaiah."
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Now, if my birth and life didn't compare
[2:32:02] with that, don don't receive me.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; When Jesus come was the same thing,
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; same thing. The messenger with the
[2:32:12] message must be a fortold message by
[2:32:15] God. Amen.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; And then God speaking through this
[2:32:19] messenger vindicates that it's the
[2:32:21] truth.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; Do you hear it?
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Do you understand it?
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Understand it. It must first be thus
[2:32:33] saith the Lord foretold.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; And then the messenger with the message
[2:32:39] must be exactly what God said would take
[2:32:42] place at that time.
[2:32:58] Amen. Thank God for his word this
[2:33:01] morning. I trust that was a blessing to
[2:33:03] you. Amen. It just really food for my
[2:33:06] soul. You know, there's a statement
[2:33:08] brother Bannon makes in there that born
[2:33:10] again is found in St. John chapter 3.
[2:33:15] uh six and seven
[2:33:17] uh to be born again. That word again
[2:33:19] means above. I didn't know that until I
[2:33:22] looked it up in the Greek. That's what
[2:33:24] that means. We are born again. That
[2:33:26] means we're born from above. So, God
[2:33:30] bless each of you. And he says that God
[2:33:33] will meet you where you are. Wherever
[2:33:35] you left him, you can still find him if
[2:33:39] you just go where you left him at.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that wonderful?
[2:33:44] So you can't get too far away. That he
[2:33:46] knows exactly where you are. You say,
[2:33:48] "I've gotten I've gotten away from you,
[2:33:50] Lord. I don't have that presence in my
[2:33:53] life." But just as he asked the captain,
[2:33:55] "Where did you leave him at?" And he had
[2:33:58] to look back and find out where he left
[2:34:00] him. And right where he left him, the
[2:34:02] Lord was right there waiting for him.
[2:34:05] And we're so glad for that that um
[2:34:07] sometimes we lose our way, but we can
[2:34:10] find our way back in his word. Amen. And
[2:34:12] I thank God for that. So let's stand to
[2:34:14] our feet and we'll sing
[2:34:20] song. Ask brother John to come.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; And it is time for us to
[2:34:45] God bless you.
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; Only the name of Jesus can protect us.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; If I'm wrong, praise God. Then we have
[2:35:07] more time to prepare.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; I'm right. Praise God. He has given us
[2:35:14] fear more
[2:35:18] disobedient something
[2:35:24] for being home.
[2:35:25] &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you, brother Rick.
[2:35:27] Thank you for those words. God bless you
[2:35:30] richly. The Holy Spirit helping you.
[2:35:33] Let's sing that song. The only real
[2:35:35] peace that I have. Dear Lord is in you.
[2:35:38] [music] Amen.
[2:35:40] For the only
[2:35:43] real peace [music]
[2:35:46] that I [singing] have,
[2:35:49] dear Lord, is in you.
[2:35:54] [singing and music]
[2:35:56] Oh, the only
[2:35:59] real peace [music]
[2:36:01] that I Hallelujah.
[2:36:05] Lord is in [singing] you
[2:36:12] with all my
[2:36:15] frustrations.
[2:36:18] I need you.
[2:36:21] I know [music and singing] I do.
[2:36:28] For the only [singing]
[2:36:31] real peace
[2:36:34] that I have,
[2:36:36] dear Lord, [singing] is [music] in you.
[2:36:41] One more time. Oh,
[2:36:45] the only [singing and music]
[2:36:47] real peace
[2:36:50] that I have,
[2:36:52] dear Lord, is
[2:36:56] you
[2:37:01] the only.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[2:37:07] I have dear Lord.
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:37:15] [music]
[2:37:17] with all
[2:37:20] of my frustrations
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; I need you, Lord. [music]
[2:37:27] I [singing] know
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; that I knew
[2:37:34] only [singing]
[2:37:36] real peace
[2:37:40] I have, dear Lord,
[2:37:44] is [music] in you. [singing]
[2:37:46] Let's bow our heads. Amen.
[2:37:50] Think about that. The only real peace
[2:37:55] that exists,
[2:37:59] oh Lord, is in you.
[2:38:02] You'll never have peace outside of him.
[2:38:07] And he loves us today. He loves you
[2:38:09] today.
[2:38:12] You right there, you sitting in your
[2:38:14] seat. He loves you.
[2:38:17] And the only peace that you'll ever
[2:38:19] have, the best deal that you'll ever
[2:38:22] receive
[2:38:24] is going to come from him.
[2:38:27] You'll never get a better deal, a better
[2:38:30] opportunity, [music] a more fair
[2:38:34] plan outside of him.
[2:38:39] And I pray [music] for you today. I pray
[2:38:41] that God will
[2:38:43] open up your heart,
[2:38:46] open up your mind
[2:38:48] to his love [music] to you today.
[2:38:51] He loves you, my brother. He loves you,
[2:38:54] my sister.
[2:38:58] [music] And just for a moment, why don't
[2:38:59] you just
[2:39:03] find that place in your life like the
[2:39:05] old captain did?
[2:39:08] Where did I leave the Lord? Where did I
[2:39:10] leave him
[2:39:12] in my sincerity? Where did I leave him
[2:39:15] in my praise? Why am I so upset? Where
[2:39:18] did the bitterness come in? Where did my
[2:39:21] ungratefulness? Where did that start to
[2:39:24] happen? These bad thoughts and my
[2:39:28] arrogance. Where did that where did that
[2:39:30] start?
[2:39:32] And Lord, let me find [music] that place
[2:39:34] where I missed it, where I lost you,
[2:39:36] where I left you.
[2:39:39] and I know you're there to receive me.
[2:39:43] I give you that opportunity this
[2:39:45] morning,
[2:39:47] every one of us today
[2:39:49] to think of that
[2:39:53] [music] as I pray.
[2:39:55] Lord Jesus,
[2:39:58] so clearly upon my heart,
[2:40:01] knowing [music] that you've made a way
[2:40:02] for us, all of us.
[2:40:05] And Lord, that way is your word.
[2:40:09] And so many times we try to climb over a
[2:40:11] wall when you have a door open for us
[2:40:15] just to walk right through.
[2:40:19] Why climb around? Why claw over? Why
[2:40:22] struggle when you've opened the door for
[2:40:25] us to walk through?
[2:40:28] Lord Jesus,
[2:40:30] I pray that we will receive you in the
[2:40:32] simplicity of your word today.
[2:40:34] receive the great message of God in this
[2:40:38] day. Lord, our souls will be filled and
[2:40:42] blessed. Every one of them from the
[2:40:45] little one to the oldest one among us.
[2:40:49] Lord, your portion, [music]
[2:40:50] you'll never deal with an organization
[2:40:54] and sometimes that organization is just
[2:40:56] one [music] person.
[2:40:58] You'll only deal with an individual
[2:41:01] that humbles themsself.
[2:41:04] Lord, that's what I want to be, Lord. I
[2:41:07] don't want to be tied to a group. I want
[2:41:09] to be tied to you and you alone, the
[2:41:13] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, may you bless
[2:41:16] every heart that's gathered here. Lord,
[2:41:18] we thank you for your Holy Spirit.
[2:41:22] We have no regrets, Lord, in following
[2:41:25] the Holy Spirit in our life.
[2:41:28] Please help us to do that even more is
[2:41:30] our prayer. [music]
[2:41:32] We just thank you. We ask your blessings
[2:41:34] upon each one. And as we continue
[2:41:36] [music] to worship you, Lord, may each
[2:41:39] one receive more of your grace and your
[2:41:43] mercy. In Jesus' name we pray.
[2:41:47] In Jesus name we [music] pray. Lord, if
[2:41:49] there's someone here
[2:41:51] that needs a touch in their body,
[2:41:55] may they lift up their hand to you right
[2:41:57] now and claim that healing touch. If
[2:42:01] somebody's discouraged right now, Lord,
[2:42:03] may they lift up their hand to you and
[2:42:05] receive the encouragement
[2:42:08] to receive the blessing of the most high
[2:42:11] God.
[2:42:13] May you grant it Lord that our needs
[2:42:16] will be met today as we come in Jesus
[2:42:20] name we pray. Lord we claim it now.
[2:42:25] Amen. Amen.
[2:42:29] The harder
[2:42:31] I soar in my dreams,
[2:42:37] the [singing] hard
[2:42:39] harder I fall.
[2:42:43] Brother John, help me sing that. And
[2:42:46] [music] sometimes
[2:42:48] I wonder
[2:42:51] if dreams were [music] were worth
[2:42:54] dreaming [singing]
[2:42:56] at all.
[2:43:02] But [singing] my disappointments
[2:43:05] [music]
[2:43:07] can keep
[2:43:10] me blinded
[2:43:12] and [music] blue.
[2:43:18] Not when [music] I am [singing] reminded
[2:43:23] of the sweet peace I have, [singing]
[2:43:28] Lord, with you.
[2:43:34] The only [singing]
[2:43:37] real [music] peace
[2:43:39] that I have.
[2:43:42] Dear Lord [singing]
[2:43:44] is in you.
[2:43:51] The only [music]
[2:43:53] real peace
[2:43:56] that I have, [singing]
[2:43:58] dear Lord, [music]
[2:44:00] is in [singing] you.
[2:44:04] [music]
[2:44:07] In all our [singing]
[2:44:09] [music]
[2:44:09] frustrations,
[2:44:12] I need you.
[2:44:15] I [music] know I do.
[2:44:23] The only [music and singing]
[2:44:26] real peace
[2:44:28] that I have,
[2:44:31] dear, Lord, [singing] is in [music] you.
[2:44:41] More of you.
[2:44:47] More [singing]
[2:44:49] of you.
[2:44:55] I've had it all. [singing]
[2:44:59] But what I need is [music and singing]
[2:45:03] more
[2:45:04] of you.
[2:45:10] All things [singing]
[2:45:12] I've had my fear
[2:45:18] and yet
[2:45:20] I hunger [music] still
[2:45:26] empty and bare. [singing]
[2:45:28] [music]
[2:45:29] Lord, hear my prayer for more
[2:45:35] of [singing] you.
[2:45:40] I need more
[2:45:42] of you.
[2:45:46] [music]
[2:45:47] I need [singing] more
[2:45:49] of you.
[2:45:55] I [music]
[2:45:56] had it all, [singing]
[2:45:59] but what I need is more of you.
[2:46:06] [music]
[2:46:10] of wings.
[2:46:11] I [music and singing] have my fear
[2:46:16] and yet
[2:46:18] I hunger
[2:46:21] still [singing]
[2:46:24] empty and be
[2:46:28] Lord hear my prayer for more [singing]
[2:46:33] [music] of you.
[2:46:38] Yes, Lord.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; I
[2:46:55] had it all. [singing]
[2:46:57] But what I need
[2:47:01] is more of you.
[2:47:07] All [singing] things [music]
[2:47:09] I have my fear
[2:47:15] and yet
[2:47:17] I hunger [singing]
[2:47:19] still
[2:47:21] [music]
[2:47:23] empty and [singing]
[2:47:26] Lord hear [music] my pray
[2:47:30] &gt;&gt; for more [singing]
[2:47:31] of
[2:47:38] Shining [singing and music]
[2:47:42] with God
[2:47:45] in [singing and music] a secret
[2:47:49] place
[2:47:52] [singing]
[2:47:53] in the spirit
[2:47:57] behold. [music]
[2:48:09] Amen.
[2:48:11] Our brother Sean is here this morning
[2:48:14] and he's calling on the [music] Lord
[2:48:17] Jesus to take him back where he's fallen
[2:48:20] from. He wants to find that place back
[2:48:22] in him. I believe that's a heart [music]
[2:48:24] desire for many that are here to find
[2:48:28] that walk with the Lord to go back where
[2:48:31] he should be. He wants his mother to
[2:48:34] come pray with him. Amen.
[2:48:37] How many can witness to this?
[2:48:40] The Holy Spirit wants us
[2:48:43] born from above. Not born from above.
[2:48:47] &gt;&gt; And how many want that in their life
[2:48:49] too? the Holy Spirit to take you where
[2:48:53] you're supposed to be spiritually.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you lost something, he'll
[2:48:58] restore it to you today. You can claim
[2:49:01] it right now in the name of Jesus
[2:49:03] Christ. Let us pray. Dear Lord Jesus, I
[2:49:08] lay my hands on my brother Sean and his
[2:49:09] dear mother. Lord, you heard his
[2:49:12] request, his testimony. Lord, you've
[2:49:14] been good to to them. You [music]
[2:49:16] blessed them. And Lord, you gave him a
[2:49:19] good job and Father, and he's gone
[2:49:22] astray a bit, Lord, in his prayer,
[2:49:24] [music] in his worship, in his time with
[2:49:26] you, Lord. And now, Lord, he wants to
[2:49:30] reclaim that in the name of Jesus
[2:49:33] Christ. And the family of God are
[2:49:35] standing behind him, supporting him,
[2:49:38] desiring the same things for him, Lord.
[2:49:42] And Lord, we encourage him, Lord, to
[2:49:44] keep moving forward in the good word of
[2:49:48] life. To keep moving forward under the
[2:49:51] anointing [music] of the word of God,
[2:49:54] Lord, that he's born from above, that
[2:49:57] you would lift him above all of the
[2:50:00] deception of the age and the [music]
[2:50:03] time wasters and all of the things that
[2:50:06] are not important. Lord, may the
[2:50:08] important things in life come into view,
[2:50:11] Lord, as he receives it, Lord Jesus, and
[2:50:15] each one that has that desire in their
[2:50:17] life and in their heart this morning. In
[2:50:21] Jesus name we pray, grant it, Father.
[2:50:25] Grant it, Lord. We receive it, Lord
[2:50:27] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[2:50:32] Hallelujah.
[2:50:38] Thank you.
[2:50:45] How I [singing] long
[2:50:47] [music] to be shut
[2:50:51] with God. Just sing it one more time.
[2:50:56] Shine [music]
[2:50:59] with God
[2:51:02] in the sea. secret
[2:51:06] place.
[2:51:09] There
[2:51:11] the spirit
[2:51:14] beholding
[2:51:17] his face
[2:51:24] power
[2:51:25] [music]
[2:51:26] to run.
[2:51:31] How I long
[2:51:34] to be [singing] shut
[2:51:38] with God.
[2:51:41] Amen. There was a line in one of the
[2:51:43] verses that Sister [music] Priscilla was
[2:51:44] singing this morning. Something along
[2:51:47] the lines, are you weary in the battle
[2:51:51] thinking that it was yours?
[2:51:53] You know, we just [music] need to let
[2:51:54] go. It's his battle. You just need to
[2:51:57] get out of the way. Let him have his way
[2:51:59] in our lives. his battle. He promised
[2:52:02] that he would finish the work that
[2:52:04] [music] he started in our lives.
[2:52:07] We just let go and let him accomplish
[2:52:08] what he has in his mind [music] for us.
