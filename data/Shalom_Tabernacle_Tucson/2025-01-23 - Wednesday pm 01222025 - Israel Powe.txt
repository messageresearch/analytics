this portion of the service the old-fashioned prayer meeting Lord may it never die may we never neglect it Lord and as we go into your word bless us father as we read the word as we hear the word we Minister the word may each heart be blessed as our prayer Lord we thank you for giving us the opportunity to take a stand on your word in such a great hour and father we ask you to vindicate the stand that we have taken Lord by bringing every promise to pass in our life Lord as we look into your word lord it's not our word it's your word it's your promises help us Lord to receive that let it be engrafted into our souls is our prayer in Jesus name we thank you amen amen so God bless each of you so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you uh this evening amen God richly bless you we like to go right to the word and uh before we go to our prayer requests this evening and there's a portion in the scriptures we like to take in Revelations chapter 3 verse number 10 speaking to uh this church age here the Philadelphian Church age and when you have that you can say Amen verse number 10 says because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth amen um Jesus in his prayer in Matthew chapter 6 uh let's turn there in our Lord's Prayer her's happy to be here tonight amen the scripture in verse number nine maybe we can read it all together says after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen what a prayer Lord keep me from the hour of Temptation and uh we're going to uh take just a little thought on the five must that brother brandham gives to us um speaking of King David and the message trying to do God a service without it being his will and um we want to bring those remind those you of those five must once again so let us pray Lord we ask your blessings upon your word Lord upon your people and father we pray that you'll forgive us of every sin every unbelief that we've done forgive us father we ask that we can come into your presence and receive from you in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you can be seated now this five must as I've said here in a number of different places I I talk about don't adding and don't taking and not taking away as um the great disciplines that's required in a pastor minister or believer anybody that handles God's word must have that discipline within themselves not to add to the word and not to take away from the word and as much as we have heard that before in the past and we know that to be true there is a temptation to do just exactly that to add something or to take away leave out something this is where the original sin started with Eve in the garden Satan only got her to um add just one word thou shalt not surely die we were reminded of that Sunday morning weren't we beautifully how the serpent came and caught her Enchanted her through wisdom through knowledge and speaking to her about the scriptures and just simply got her off on one word and that's all he wants from you and I today is to disbelieve one word not a whole group of word if he can get you on several things great but really all he has to get you is on one word one word out of place throws the whole Bible out of order it was placed in order the solar system there's an order to it there's a discipline to that it's not just random nature there's a discipline to that and uh this discipline like handling a firearm or anything like explosives or working with electricity anything like that requires a certain discipline you just can't I have a brother who works with explosives uh propane tanks and the the stress and the pressure and working in a place like that because you can lose your life just working with vow V uh vows how you say it vow valves not vowels but Valves and making sure things are tight and the right pressures the right amounts you can't go in there without getting enough sleep you can't go in there have stepping you can't do like I do on the job and the construction just be daydreaming you got to be focused in what you're doing because somebody can lose their life and it requires that and it's every bit as important in handling God's word it's the same thing and so as much as we love everybody and we want to love every person every believer and all all the other groups of people the Temptation will always be to twist to add to take away from the word and God has commanded us to stay with that word Beyond Fellowship friends families whatever our commandment is to stay with the word and when you come in contact with more groups of people you'll find more of these issues challenging you to do just that to stay in with the word amen so the prophet of God takes these five must and in the message um I'm not going to be long Lord help me um is the what message did I want Saints thank you John is becoming one of my favorites him and sister Heather they helped me out they help me preach all right um doing God a service without it being his will and uh you can become my favorite too all of you can so just help me out here in the message the prophet of God it goes in right here and I'll start right here in paragraph 103 and he says this now notice influence sometimes great guys get together you hear them say great so and so and great so and so are great don't never do that there is no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers sisters I don't care if you're pastoring a church that's got five people in it that don't make you little that makes you a brother see if you're true to God's word don't care what how you don't get little God don't have little children and big children he just has children they're all the same notice God himself come from the palaces of Glory to become one of us now who is the big one not come down here to take the form of a priest but a servant wash the very clay that he was created the feet of his Apostles and others now who is great but influenced these men were they didn't understand they thought something new was going to happen no something that God didn't say was going to happen they went at it the wrong way now to get the context of what we're talking about here tonight it's in 1 Chronicles uh chapter number five is where David corrects the error but if you want to go um uh further than that is chapter 4 I believe chapter 2 3 4 somewhere right in there to get the full context of what David had done he wanted to bring the ark which was the word of the Lord back to its rightful place he wanted to move God's word he wasn't trying to do something bad he wasn't trying to set up an idol he wasn't trying to lead the people into a denomination or organ he was really with all of his heart trying to do something right but you see no matter how right it is if you're handling a firearm and it's loaded that gun doesn't care who the owner is if you you shoot it and it's pointed at whatever it's pointed at it's going to hit it and there's many many families that have been injured and hurt and devastated because of this discipline right here it's a loaded weapon and it doesn't matter you didn't mean to it doesn't matter it was my own gun it doesn't matter what matters is it's a loaded firearm and there's a discipline required when you're handling it and you can't play with with that you can't leave it laying around you can't just expect junior is going to understand that no and it's that serious amen right and so handling God's word is every bit as important and and so brother Ram is talking about that and he's bringing this in where David wanted to move the ark back and then as they were bringing it back they didn't consult the word of God which was the prophet and when that Ark stumbled an innocent man didn't want the ark to hit the ground and he went forward and try to catch the ark from follow falling fallen and God struck him dead and that got everybody's attention and that's the time to stop doing whatever you're doing you don't keep moving forward if somebody dies like ananas is Sur fire or anything like that happens you got to stop what you're doing and and and take inventory what's going on here there's a reason why this is going on and this is this is the great shock that happened to David and the prophet of God is bringing that he says but influenced these men were they didn't understand they thought something new was going to happen they went at it wrong that that's what all this enthusiasm started back Yonder a long time ago each denomination had to have a Divine healer each denomination had to have this that or the other each denomination had to have a little David each one had to have this that or the other see what happened it done the same thing it did here same thing influence the word for the season the time that they were living in was ignored notice the Levites shoulders was the original provided way of God to do these things pack that Ark on the Levites shoulders anything outside of that was contrary what he said that's what he meant God cannot change that's the reason stay with his word I've got a script yeah 1 Chronicles 15:15 if you want to put that down now notice there in following God now I want you to kind of jot this in your mind to keep God's Commandments to do anything right for God to do God a service correctly there is five musts to do God's service correctly emphasizing the correctly notice David was doing God a service he was doing everything he know to do except leaving off God see he was doing something right something good for the people something good for the church but the these five must I want you to remember these no matter how sincere man may be in doing it God a service these five must be there first it must be his time to do it what if Moses would come and say We'll build an ark and float up the Nile like Noah did Noah's time was all right for an ark but not his time what if Jesus would have come and says now I'll tell you what we'll do we'll go up the mount like Moses did and get a new Declaration of law see uh-huh he was that law see you must be in his time it must be in his season you got that now must be in his time must be in his season time and season and it must be according to his word that has been spoken it must I don't care how well you say this ought to be or that ought to be or for this ought to be it's got to be according to his word according to his time and his season and it must be given according to the person he has chose to do it by I don't care how much dignitaries there's King David just as great as any of them he was King over the nation but he had a way of doing it and he had to he had told them how he would do it but they failed to do it must be Accord according to his word according to his time according to his program it must be by the person he has chose to give it and to do it Moses tried to run from it take somebody else but God chose Moses to do it many of them Paul tried to get out of it many others but it's got to be the one he chooses to do it it must come first to His prophets the word of God must come to His prophets amamos 37 the Lord God will do nothing until he first reveals it to his servants the prophets for and the prophet must be Vindicated by the word of God there is your five must it's got to be that way his time his season when he said it would be the man he chose and must come to the prophet and the prophet must be a Vindicated Prophet we find out many of them in the Bible it come to the prophets it wasn't Vindicated our Prophet is Jesus Christ so brother Adam tells us it's the time it's the season it's the person it's that person it must come through a Vindicated Prophet or the word has to be spoken by a Vindicated prophet and that that Prophet must be Vindicated it must come by a prophet and that Prophet must be Vindicated so um just looking at that and really thinking about that then we can say that a prophet is the time piece that shows us the time and the season that we're in that's right so instead of trying to figure out what time and Seasons once you got the prophet and he's Vindicated he will determine what time and season that you're in because his word is going to be current for the day we're living in that's right in the days of Noah it was current for that day it's going to rain in the days of Moses it was current for that day we're leaving Egypt and each day John the Baptist he was waiting for to introduce the Christ so the Vindicated Prophet is is the one that uh shows us the time in the season and when you look at this trying to do God a a service it it seems like you know for us to do something that's right or something that's good or if we want to serve God correctly if we want to do God a service or do anything right for God as he says if you want to keep God's Commandments then these five must be there so you say well I can't do God a service because I'm not a I'm not a prophet or I'm just a sister or no that's not what he said you got to already he said it has to come through a Vindicated Prophet so the prophet's word is the instructions that gives you the ability to keep the Commandments of God that's how you know you're doing it correctly because you received a Vindicated Prophet that Prophet came he was Vindicated and he brings you into the time and season so this timing is very very important timing for um just one example uh in St John chapter 5 the Bible says that at a certain season a angel would come near the pool of Bethesda and near this pool of Bethesda were were a multitude or two multitudes of lame halt withered people that were sick and diseased and what they would do is sit around this pool waiting for the troubling of the water so there was a time element that was required when that water was troubled that meant that the angel was on the water and once the first one to get in that water was made whole of whatever their trouble was the scripture says so they're watching they're waiting they're looking at this time and um you know knowing that the prophet has been Vindicated knowing that he has brought to us the word of the Lord I would challenge that this need of patience is it's probably what all of us can use that virtue of patience waiting on the Lord now the the just the raw definition of patience means this the capacity to accept or tolerate delay yes yes yes let me finish without getting angry I almost got that I can wait I can tolerate you well boy I'm mad at you but let's read the definition it's without getting angry you if you got mad you lost your patience don't look at me like that unless you going to say Amen to me the capacity to accept or tolerate delay trouble or suffering without getting angry annoyed or upset beautiful word huh you have need of patience the scripture tells us and so in Revelations chapter 3 and verse number 10 tells us that you have kept the word of my patience patience now brother brandom tells us what that means the word of my patience and he says this in the Philadelphian Church age under the eulogy in the church age book it's written just like this Revelations 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth what does he mean by the word of my patience Hebrews 61315 for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but become even more impatient with life let me show you this truth even fully set forth even more fully set forth so what has this you know age of getting things quick and fast and the communicate what is that bread is it made us more patient or more impatient you know it the the the your computer will never be fast enough think about that the faster version is what you want and yours is faster than it was five years ago but it still ain't fast enough and it ain't going to ever be fast enough because it doesn't create patience it creates more impatient people you can't get back to people quick enough they want to hear from you now they want to answer now they want every everything done right now they want their career now they want it set now they want their salary at is maximum people they don't want to go through 20 years 30 years 40 Years of nothing that's right 20 years for what that's right who wants to wait 30 years for for what no I want this now I deserve it now I feel like right it belongs to me it doesn't create and so what it does and so be careful now these little short sermons I give you it's just it ain't going to never be short enough because if I go 25 minutes and then I go 28 be like brother Israel what's going on you you I mean you kept us a whole extra three minutes where are you going Eternal ones believers who crossed the banner of time we're Eternal beings where are we going to take their clock maybe the new church won't even have no clock you praise the Lord there you go it just creates more impatience it it's it's really on you to wait on the Lord without getting upset without getting anxious without getting annoyed wait on the Lord in the great promise of the Holy Ghost coming to the disciples Jesus told them to go wait for the promise of the father he didn't tell him how many days he didn't tell him it's going to come so he said wait there what until until when Lord I need to know I got stuff I need to do I'm making my schedule I'm trying to plan out my life I want this done before I'm 25 I got to list of things to get done before I'm 30 before I'm 40 I got a list of things and Lord you need to honor my list you talking to the wrong person right there when you're waiting on the lord it's until you get an answer can I get a witness Lord teach me how to wait you know he's proving himself by giving us salvation once we experience salvation he has proven himself to us the greatest thing that could ever happen to a man is to be forgiven of all of his sins the greatest experience that can happen you repent and he forgives you and then from there he has everything else in order and mapped out for your life if you can just believe him but what happens is we get impatient and this is what Eve did she was given the instructions in the Garden of Eden and but and she knew there was a promise to replenish the earth and the prophet of God says she couldn't wait that's right that that you know I got to have I know it's going to happen you gave me a promise I know it's there you said it's going to happen so Lord how can I help you you can help me by just waiting until I come get you like I got you when you wasn't even thinking about me I came and got you you wasn't even searching for me you wasn't looking for me I came and I found you and now all of a sudden after I found you not of any good of your own now you going to put me on the clock and start pushing me and pushing me and pushing me God's going to tell you to wait mm wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall do what they get stronger sir the longer you wait the stronger you get if it comes too quick it's only going to breathe more impatience is that what he said read it for you one more time here the church age book he says there here you wait for why if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience but would become even what more impatient could you imagine serving someone that is impatient difficult difficult to serve someone that's impatient like that so he gives us this Word of Promise he gives us these five mons the time and the season you know this great blessing that the Lord has blessed us our with our church building nothing short of a miracle in my in my heart in my mind it was nothing I planned out in my planner there was no you know yeah just as I planned it there's none of that huh no no no there none of that so so so when we going start stressing then somebody let me know when we start stressing because it's coming but he who brought forth day one day two day three don't you think he's got day four five and six taken care of too he's got the rest of your life taken care of he's got your future in his hands can we rest in that Lord give me the grace to walk and run the race with patience um not frustrating the the grace of God as Paul says in Galatians chapter 3 I will not I do not frustrate the gospel do not want to frustrate I forget how he says there that there but you make Grace the grace of God frustrating you he started you in Grace and now you want to finish it in works yeah that's right now I want to work this I'm going to get this done I'm going to make this happen he started You by his grace it is by his grace that he will perform Every Blessing every promise in your life Lord teach me how to wait give me the patience Lord to walk in this discipline of believing in you and trusting in you and never let my testimony be negative but always positive with a praise on my lips you take these songs of the world it's Blues it's the country it's a somebody's dog died somebody's wife left them and all the blues and all the but that's not praise and worship praise and worship is all positive it's the scripture I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul will make her boast in the Lord The Humble will hear thereof and they'll be glad oh taste and see come and magnify the Lord with me taste and see that the Lord is good that's the Praises that's the word of the Lord that's what the song service is all about did any of y'all miss that that was your opportunity to get your get your praise on was the worship service wasn't coming to see what color tide the brother had on is it a fast s or slow song that was your praise break right there and he's so good to us he's so merciful to us he's got it all under control as the brother saying and so here is where Eve made her great great mistake and brother brandom is typing it with the church so in the spoken word is the Original Seed he brings this it's prophetic it's very uh um relative for our day as he brings it to us I mean think about because we have received a messenger and a prophet that's Vindicated and has showed to us the word for our day then we know what's supposed to happen today we kind of know what to look for we're we're not a know- it all we don't know every exact thing but we know we're not looking for a Revival when we know there's judgment coming for example you know we're not looking for a messenger to come when that's already happen and we know we're not looking for some word to be opened up like a a corner to be turned which so many people you know God's doing a new thing well what you mean by new or God's going to turn a corner that's what we used to do but this what we're doing now you got to watch these people that want to turn a corner without any quotations want to turn a corner without a prophet yes sir want to turn a corner without the scriptures Vindicated and this is how we know how to stand brother will is because it's in the word of the Lord and the word comes to the prophet then he becomes an extension of that word that's right it's very very nice it's very sobering it's very beautiful and when you catch it you'll be resting you won't be running around I'm missing this I'm missing that got to push and make this happen got to man I got to make myself see this you ain't G to see nothing that God don't want to show you everything he showed you was by his grace and then we just receive it and say thank you Lord show me more in your time you will I guarantee you every one of us is doing something today that in probably five years from the day we'll look back and say you know I was wrong there absolutely yes sir but it's amazing how we want to indict the elders that went on before they should have did this should have did that should have did this keep on living as my mom would say you keep living and when your time to leave here I car you somebody can rise and say he should have did this he should have did that should have did that but you know there is nothing that I can see uh in the word that I I mean I think I'm doing everything right I sure hope so don't you yes I mean if I'm doing something wrong and I know it I'm just wrong but if I'm doing what I believe is right and I think I'm doing it right with all my heart and then five years down the road I found out I was wrong guess what I was wrong don't we show that Grace for the elders then that's right do you think they were doing what they did here in this city or in the state with the message or or whatever they've done that they were doing it to be wrong see we want Grace for oursel but we want to leave Grace for them but if you'll keep living you're going to want somebody to have some Grace for you too amen so what do you do you wait on the Lord he doesn't make you feel uncomfortable when he reveals something to you it's like a puzzle piece clicking in your heart you know it's the will of God for you what you feel uncomfortable about is the people around you they are the one who make you feel uncomfortable but the Lord is not going to cause you to do something that is going to make you feel he's not going to make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable he he's trying to bring you his rest and when he reveals that to you it does bring rest but then now to communicate that to others to take a stand when others can't see it to take a stand when your friends are around you don't see it that's where the rub really comes from The Outsiders the Lord doesn't the Lord brings you his word and he says take my yoke upon me take my yoke and it is easy my burdens are easy my burdens are light what's the scripture say take my yoke upon thee and learn of me for my yoke is easy and my burdens are light and when the Lord gives you these convictions down in your spirit down in your heart you need to just go with that this is the message this is what he said and when I'm listening to it I'm all good brother will brother George I'm doing great listening to wow amen great and then you get in groups and groups and groups some of them quotes make you feel uncomfortable it's not the quote it's the people who don't believe it or vice versa however you want to say it so here the prophet of God says this here talking about Eve and it's a it's a touchy spot here for all of us and a bit of a warning to you okay it says paragraph 52 the bride today is a byproduct she calls herself the bride but what she is she's made up of material of organization not of the word so much word in it to make it kind of a byproduct to make it hypocritical Eve believed most of the word but she doubted one part of it this is in the spoken word yeah today she can't even get Acts or Matthew 28:19 straight with acts 238 see it confuse it confuses her that's just one little place of hundreds of others now the Bride of Adam was a type of the second Adam's bride now Adam's bride Adam's bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the Earth it was an oncoming thing a promise she was not his wife as yet because he had never lived with her the bride of Christ is not his wife wife yet the wedding supper is to take place get it notice oh this is Rich she got in her hurry and what did she do she crossed her seed she mingled it with the serpent seed and when she did she WR what did she bring forth she brought a child of death a child that she perverted every child after that and when the Church of Jesus Christ was perverted in the time time of Rome after her virgin birth and was given to Christ at Pentecost what did she do she crossed herself with Roman Dogma the Protestant church has done the very same thing she can't wait drop down to paragraph 59 that's what Christ has found couldn't wait that's what the matter with the people today they can't wait for the real Holy Spirit to take the church in position they've got to manufacture something work up something initial evidence speaking in tongues to get more members in the church all this kind of Tommy Rod instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people she can't wait now don't you want to wait for the real manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God don't you want to wait for the real baptism of the Holy Ghost in its fullness to be manifested in your life in your heart I mean what if everyone else is getting and they're getting it and that one's getting it you can't make yourself get anything but you can you can wait on the Lord without being anxious and continue to believe his word is true Lord you brought me this far you'll take me to The Next Step you're the one who brought me here just a beautiful Revelation that uh talking with brother McGraw when he he made that statement to me he's like he says you know your family the Lord is the one who brought him here and I'm like yeah that's true I didn't bring any of my family here and now I'm going to stress out and lose sleep over my family getting saved no I need to take God's word what he said about my that my family is his responsibility he brought them here he spoke to me he can speak to them I believe he is speaking to them I claim them like I claim my own salvation that's the way you talk about your family your family is not your responsibility God's the one that brought it you're not a Creator you didn't bring anybody here so why should we worry why should we stress over the promises that God has given to us it was an oncoming promise God had promised that to multiply and replenish the Earth and they had to put something into it to make it happen I don't want to be that way Lord help me to take a stand on your word to find where that word is to respect it with all of my heart and to diligently believe and wait for those promises to be manifested in my life I believe that with all my heart I believe if the word is preached it will produce the signs wonders and miracles it will produce a Revival it will produce the manifestations that the word said it would bring these signs shall follow them that believe not vice versa we believe the word we take a stand on the word and then he brings the Vindication of the stand that we take Lord help us as we bring our prayers to him tonight
