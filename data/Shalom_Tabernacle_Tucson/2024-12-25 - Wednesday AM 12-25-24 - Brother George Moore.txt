strange previous year in her life and a lot of criticism and and a lot of unknowns on what the future has and that's the same way it is with us today we a lot of unknowns about what's in the future but we know who holds the future amen and and uh just as they were singing that song I was thinking it's not often we see somebody signing but my brother Jeffrey um is um sang a song with my sister Jill at my dad's memorial service some of you may have been there and it was um couldn't help but think of that and hearing the song Mary Did You Know and what he came for and it's because he still lives that we can face tomorrow and we have hope to see all those that have gone on before us and so it's more of an Easter song than a Christmas song but wanted to just sing that as we turn the service over to brother George this morning it's because Because He [Applause] Lives I Can Face Tomorrow yes because he lives all fear is gone all my fear is gone oh you thankful for that this morning

Merry Christmas to you so good to be in the house of the Lord this morning I uh it's uh it's Christmas time but it's uh brother brandom said a day of worship and so we have this opportunity to come together to Worship the Lord this morning in spirit and truth so so happy to have our visitors with us this morning and and uh so happy to have her pastor back with us this morning let's give the Lord a hand for that he he's been back in the States for minutes now and is uh in the house of the Lord so God bless him for his sacrifice and and uh he might be tired in his body but I'm trusting he's refreshed in his spirit and and uh we're just looking forward to hearing the testimonies from that while we're all standing turning your Bibles this morning for a scripture reading Isaiah the 9th chapter and then we'll read out of Matthew the first chapter just for a little Christmas message this morning and Isaiah the 9th chapter and the sixth verse we'll begin reading for unto us Matthew the first chapter and the 18th verse we'll begin Reading MA e e and let's just bow our heads now Heavenly Father we're so grateful this morning to be assembled together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're thankful today Lord that you are God With Us and Lord we just ask you that you would bless the further part of this service we thank you for this Fellowship this assembly Lord we thank you for everything you've done for us Lord everything you're doing now and everything that you're going to do Lord we appre appreciate every bit of it Lord and we just commit ourselves into your hands for this next few minutes Lord I pray that you would watch over me bind my lips before I'd speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a church said amen God bless you may be seated and uh the title of the message this morning is the greatest Christmas gift ever given and I want to just take a a few minutes this morning to uh I'm doing a very anti- message uh thing this morning and I'm going to take up maybe not anti- message but anti- message Believers some of them and I'm going to take up for Christmas a little bit uh uh it seems like there's a lot made about Christmas in the message and some people have different ideas on it and everyone seems to have a different Doctrine on it and I'm not sure exactly why uh uh you know some very prominent churches in the message this past week just uh preached some pretty hard messages against the uh people observing Christmas and so forth and and then they cancelled their Wednesday night service or their Wednesday service so if you're against U uh you know another prominent Minister that I was listening to said Jesus never pointed us to his birth he pointed us to his death and while I certainly agree with with that in in theory there's two of the four gospels that talk extensively about the birth of Christ and there's multiple multiple quotes that talk about the birth of Christ and we know that Jesus was the word and so uh I think it's pretty well documented brother brandham clearly tells us that Christ wasn't born on December the 25th uh but brother brandham makes mention that he doesn't believe that the the Lord cares what day we observe it he he just is just as long as we do it we should observe it every day really and you know uh I guess my point in saying all this brothers and sisters is I really don't care what anybody believes it's just when it gets to the point of when you have a certain Doctrine or a certain belief and you feel like anybody else that doesn't believe the same way you do is going to miss the Rapture or they're not going to be a good Christian or something like that then I have a problem with it Saints you believe what you believe you got to stand on your convictions but when your convictions uh uh are or or putting somebody else down or putting somebody else out of the Kingdom then I have a little problem with it can you say Amen this morning but I believe if we just casually search the message we'll find many instances where brother brandham and brother Neville receive Christmas gifts from the church every year and and uh the church giv Christmas gifts to the children the Sunday school children he said we got a little something for you before you leave back there for Christmas and we find instances in the message where the church was having Christmas plays uh with with the Sunday school age kids and so forth and we find instances of brother brandom many times wishing people a Merry Christmas and so uh that was a little Doctrine going around initially was don't don't say Merry Christmas brother Bram said say Christ be with you and and brother brandham did say that and then he right after that he said Merry Christmas so uh so uh however you want to do it brothers and sisters it doesn't matter to me but what does matter is we don't push the other man out for what we believe and and we find many instances in the stories of brother brandom talking about uh stockings uh in his in his home when he was when he was a child stocking stuff with oranges and striped candy and how they looked forward to it as a kid and and he talked about sister hope was across the river shopping for the kitties some Christmas gifts when the flood came and that's why they were separated cuz she was on the other side of the of the river there shopping for Christmas gifts so we find all of this brother brandom said I don't suppose that he cares what day we set aside Because the actual day is lost but it is in commemoration of his birthday amen and so there in in an in essence lies the the reason that we observe it amen and so um brother brandom clearly tells us that this should be a day of worship amen but it seems like too many times as people we want to bind heavy burdens Grievious to be born and lay them on men's shoulders and sometimes it just seems like we're trying to make oursel odd which brother brandom said we're not supposed to do but this should be one of the happiest times of the year can you say Amen to that we should be thankful that this time of year that God sent us a savior that he sent us a son that he that he sent us Emmanuel and we should be rejoicing and happy because that we're free people today because he sent us that free gift amen but it also is one of the most stressful times of the year and and you find that many people are dealing this time of year with family issues or they're dealing with money issues and and many times people today are dealing with broken homes and broken families and you're trying to get them all back together for a Christmas time celebration as it were we're dealing with tight schedules and tight budgets and and it's just really tough anxiety and depression are at their absolute Peak during the holiday seasons and anxiety brothers and sisters if you look into it is is kind of a new age issue I I don't remember my dad when I was a kid ever checking in with me about my anxiety levels but it's a pressure that's on the age and a pressure that's on the people and it caused it's caused when you look at the medical definition of it it's really caused it's rooted in unrealistic expectations and the world is full of unrealistic expectations and it's caused a lot of times when we look at something externally or someone externally for our happiness instead of looking internally Saints amen nobody else can provide your happiness for you no thing can provide happiness for you no new item can provide happiness for you no new job can provide happiness for you it's got to come from inside can you say Amen today and we got to look internally for happiness because it is a choice that we have to make come on somebody this morning many of the expectations that we fight today aren't set up by the word of God they're set up by the society that we live in and these unrealistic expectations uh cause this anxiety if we got unrealistic expectations for what a good life is if your expectations for a good life is a new house or a new car or a new job or some money in the bank then you're going to be anxious because that's not where happiness comes from can you say Amen this morning Saints we're here we might as well have church is that right amen it's not coming from external things unrealistic expectations see life has got to have a purpose you got to have a reason who are you helping what are you doing and if your life isn't about helping somebody else or doing something for somebody else Saints then you got no real purpose and it and it leads to anxiety it leads to depression it's not a job it's not a house it's not a car it's a purpose amen amen un unrealistic expectations for what a good marriage is supposed to be unrealistic expectations for what your life should be turning out like unrealistic expectations for your husband sometime sisters if you was waiting on charlon Hon to walk through the door and you got the Grape Ape it walks in you're going to be disappointed there ain't nobody that can live up to Hollywood expectations of what a husband should be or what a wife should be or what marriage should be that's fairy tale preaching Saints amen but if that Grape Ape gets up every day and goes to work for you you ought to thank the Lord for it oh my come on somebody today amen unrealistic expectations for the marriage unrealistic expectations for a husband or for a wife unrealistic if a Hollywood wife is what you looking for brothers You're Going to starve to death if a hwood wife is what you're looking for you're going to live in a pig pin amen I'd rather have my house man taken care of I'd rather have something hot to eat unrealistic expectations for what marriage is what what a husband is what a wife is what I I'd rather have a woman that'll take care of my children that'll raise them to love the Lord than to have some kind of Hollywood expectation of what a marriage should be or what a wife should be or or what a husband should be I want somebody that lives by the word not what the world says unrealistic expectation it causes anxiety unrealistic expectations for life in general when you say oh I got it all figured out brother George and I know what the next 10 years of my life is going to look like you're sitting there lying to yourself amen or you might think you got it figur it out until sickness comes along or or or job issues come along or some marital issue comes along and then it derails the whole thing and it causes anxiety causes depression because you thought you had it worked out oh my yeah nobody can look back over the last 5 10 15 years of your life and say oh I had this figured out I knew how this was going to work out no we're in the hands of God today Saints we're in God's hands it's his will that we're living amen I don't know what tomorrow holds brother John but I know he holds tomorrow for me amen unrealistic expectations causing our priorities to get out of line even with our children sometimes we got unrealistic expectations maybe sometimes with their schooling we want them to be a certain level of smartness we want them to get a certain kind of education and and you know so oh well they're behind they're behind in their English or they're behind in their math or who said they're behind Saints what does it matter if they learn it when they're eight or nine or 10 when they're 20 it ain't going to matter when they learned it as long as they learned it but we set unrealistic expectations and it makes us anxious oh what am I going to do we're behind in math H I used to when I was in Hot Springs some of them would graduate their kids at 12 or 13 14 15 years old why what are they going to do graduated high school then watch they're 15 years old they can't get a job you don't need to turn them loose in college at 14 so what are we in a hurry about Saints what's the hurry what's the pressure where's it from well it's from unrealistic expectations oh oh they need to get a degree well I've fired a bunch of people that had degrees because degrees don't make you a good person they don't make you a good worker is that right Saints amen they they don't you you can be successful with or without a degree amen there's a whole lot of people that's learned trades and and and they've made millions of dollars working a trade there's a whole lot of people that's made a lot of money with a degree but Saints it it it applies to the person not the degree amen it doesn't matter what kind of degree you got if you're lazy and you can't show up for work is that right brother will how many of your Cowboys got degrees brother will don't help none does it amen I'm not against that by the way but it it's about your work ethic and your and your responsibility level and and how how much of a benefit you are to the people of the company that you're working for amen but we got to we feel we got this pressure that we got to do this certain thing because we got to be successful what's the definition of success anyhow the definition of success is the accomplishment of an aim or a purpose so first off if you want to be successful you got to have a purpose you got to have an aim amen and that's the definition of success so if your purpose is to be a Godly Christian wife and you're doing it then you're successful if your purpose is to lead your family as a Godly husband and you're doing it then you're successful today Saints don't let the the world dictate what successful is come on somebody today amen amen some of these things that we make a a priority they're not a qualification for making a Rapture I'd rather my kids be dumb as a fence post and love the Lord amen but I come this morning to say we need to remove ourself from the expectations of the world and and look to the expectations of the word see the world don't dictate brother Chuck what happens in our house the world doesn't dictate what happens with our children or what happens with our family or what happens in our church the world don't dictate the world doesn't get to dictate what we do as a family the world doesn't get to dictate how good my marriage is the world doesn't get to dictate how how how I should live my life I'm not living it by the world I'm living it by the word somebody amen the world don't tell me how to raise my kids amen that's that's the Lord's job the Lord dictates how I raise my children not the not the world the the the the world the world don't dictate how I School my children that's that's the word that dictates that amen my kids don't even dictate how I raise my kids them two older kids they look at me all the time like a hypocrite about Eden they said oh you wouldn't have never let us do that Dad well you know what I like her better but thanks we don't need Psychology today we don't need Psychology we don't need a psychiatrist lat see in church Edge brother Brown said there is a textbook on psychology one we all need and it's the Bible amen he said it is written by God and contains God's psychology and you don't need any doctor to explain it to you receive you the Holy Spirit and let him do the explaining he wrote the book and he can tell you what's in it and what it means amen oh I'm so happy for that today unrealistic expectation causing depression stress anxiety during the holidays the world sets an expectation of what a perfect Christmas looks like amen what a perfect meal tastes like and and you got a perfect meal that you got to fix and you're all stressed out about fixing the perfect meal and then the ham don't turn out right and you're anxious and depressed about it the expectation of what a perfect gift is people don't care what kind of gift you get them but we got all stressed out worried about what kind of gift to get somebody we're all anxious about it and if we don't get the gift we want then we're all upset or if we give somebody a gift we don't think they liked it well enough then we're all upset the perfect expectation of a perfect family worried about people getting along let me tell you something Saints you can put a whole group of Christians in a room and they ain't all going to get along so ain't no way your family's going to all get along but if you got an expectation of a perfect family and a perfect Christmas and a perfect everybody getting along you can't put a bunch of people that don't like each other in the room and expect them all to get along but if we that's where our expectations are then it's going to lead to anxiety it's going to lead to depression amen come on somebody today but remove ourselves today Saints from the expectations of Christmas and let's look to the reasons for Christmas remove ourself from the expectation and look for the reason brother Brown say sir we would see Jesus he said let me make this clear I do not believe that Jesus would care what day you worshiped his birthday on if it's a 25th 26th or whether it's in April May June July whatever it might be just so you Worship You worship him on any day but here's what it is they've taken the sacredness from Christmas to make it not a Christmas but a worship day but a celebration see and we we don't he said you hear people say we're going to celebrate Christmas that's wrong we should never celebrate Christmas Christmas is a day of worship not celebration we celebrate Lincoln's birthday we celebrate Washington's birthday and if you was down in the Deep South and would celebrate Lee's birthday or Jackson Amen to that now the birth the birthday is a celebration but the birthday of Christ I believe should be a day of consecration worship instead of tonight of people at church on their knees praying and thanking God for the real Christmas gift amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord on Christmas Day Saints amen Christmas is a day of worship but instead of being a day of worship we let out church service he said people at church on their knees thanking God for the real Christmas gift amen see when the wise men came they presented to Jesus gifts and so in commemoration of that we present gifts today brother Brown said the great shineing light he said what did the gold represent he was a king he was a he wasn't uh to be made King he was born born King he wasn't God's he was God's Eternal King he was a king so they offered gold and they offered frankincense that's a perfume very costly the best that could be gotten what did frankincense mean the perfume he was a sweet smelling savior unto God for he went about Healing The Sick and doing good gold because he was King frankincense because he was a sweet smelling savior to God his life so pleased him that God breathed in his breathed in his Holiness and Beauty for it was his own Holiness reflected in him oh if we could be a sweet smelling savior if God's holiness could be reflected in US is that your desire this Christmas Day Saints God's holiness reflected in us till we go about doing good as Jesus of Nazareth till it would be a sweet smelling savior unto the Lord but we fuss we argue we stew we doubt that's the reason it's become a stench in the nostrils of God our lives were in and out of old places we should not be we say things we ought not say come on somebody today we do things we ought not do we fuss and take sides with the world and deny Christ in the general in the great crucial moments that's the reason we can't be a sweet smelling savior but he was these Magi gave frankincense he said now they gave him myrr also and anybody knows that myrr is a very costly but bitter herb myrr what did myrr represent his great Supreme sacrifice his crushed out Young Life at Calvary where the sins of the world ground him into bits gold because a king frankincense of his sweet loving life and M because of his sacrifice for Sinners that he died he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed Saints the greatest gift that could be given was gave on that first Christmas morning the greatest gift that could be given was given when God sent his son it was God's wrapped gift unto you and me today it wasn't just the birth it was the life it wasn't just the birth it was the death it wasn't just the birth it was the resurrection it wasn't just the birth it was the Ascension it wasn't just the birth it was the Holy Ghost that he shed for you oh he was wrapped in swalling cloth he was born in a stable he was like king of glory but he didn't have his own bed he owned it all but he didn't have a bed amen he owned it all but he didn't have a room to stay in in the end he owned it all but he didn't have a grave that he could be buried in he owned it all the greatest gift that could ever be given was hung between two M factors the greatest gift that was ever given had to borrow a tomb the greatest gift that was ever given came under a bad name as a carpenter son as an illegitimate child the greatest gift that was ever given was poured out on Calvary the greatest gift that was ever given oh my was given in that upper room that day oh my when they waited on the promise from on high amen when that Holy Ghost come on them saints made them stag around like drunk people oh we need some more stagging around like drunk people today amen amen the greatest gift that could ever be given was given in Jesus Christ amen Isaiah 531 who ha believed our reports to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed we shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root on dry ground have no form or come to us and we shall see him and there's no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows AC acquainted with grief and I'm talking about the Lord Of Glory here Saints a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we hid as it were faces from and we despised him we esteemed him not surely he'd borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him strick and smitten to God Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed oh god oh we like sheep have gone astray we turned everyone in his own and the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all every one of us sa it was laid on Jesus Christ he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he brought as a lamb to the slaughter and a sheep before the shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken are you grateful today Saints for the greatest Christmas gift that was ever given when you gather together today with your families and when you when you

word formed body that theophany we had entered into it he said but this body is subject to the word Oh my he said the difference between him Jesus Christ and you oh my as a son he said he was at the beginning the word and a morphal body but he said you and I we bypassed that and we came down here to Earth to be temp Ed he said Jesus was imorphia in the form of God and he said he came and lived in the form of MDC he said but then later on we didn't hear about MDC no more because he said mzc was done away with it he came in Jesus Christ and he said you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet yet but that day coming saints that body's waiting on you now is that what the message says and he says you come like Adam like me you became an attribute to the flesh to be tempted he says but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle dissolved we have one already waiting oh my and a morphal body is waiting on you Saints

in the beginning aren't you glad you was a thought in the beginning amen he said but in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down in flesh and be tempted by sin amen he says and if you stand oh say let me tell you this you can't do nothing but stand amen you you're a part of God today amen you can't do nothing but stand because of your creator made you to

thing have you recognized what Eagles food is today Saints have you you recognized where the Eagles are gathered have you recognized what the carcass is today and he says if you've been he said you

a big serpent or a big dragon and he's got his hand in your side clawing you up he said you got two choices he said you can cut the hand off or you can knock him in the head and it'll take care of the hand and he said Jesus Christ knocked him in the head at Calvary and he said sickness came as a result of sin and when Jesus atoned for sin he atoned for sickness also he said and it says our worry our trouble our fears and all those things are attributes from sin then when Jesus died at Calvary he settled the Quin sin question for even before the father because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our kinsman redeemer Merry Christmas church Jesus Christ knocked him in the head today Jesus Christ knocked Satan in the head Jesus Christ atoned for our sin today Jesus Christ atoned

and I'm so happy to be with you Saints uh today um the Lord is so good to us it's good to be in the house of the Lord I um happy to see you all make it out to the house of the Lord on a Christmas morning and we enjoy that word this morning didn't we amen just beautiful I have one scripture I want wanted to read to you and then we'll uh pray and we'll close here but it's in Philippians chapter 3 you turn there quickly I believe that's what it is in verse number eight verse 7even but what things were gained to me those I count it lost for Christ yes doubtless and I count all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dunk that I may win Christ and be f found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death amen and we know that um to know him is life and Paul said that I may know him and when and when we know who he is it brings to us this great revelation of what Christmas is I was raised in a home where we had a Christmas tree every year when I gave my heart to the Lord the little church I was a Holiness Church um and and then coming into the message our pastor he he didn't believe in Christmas trees although his head Deacon had the biggest tree in the church every year brother s do it preach those quotes on paganism there's quotes in there you know Jeremiah talks about it brother bam calls it paganism so I I was a no tree guy even as a Believer no tree no tree no tree and my wife was raised with no tree but then after we got married you know she wanted a tree and uh I'm still a no tree guy uh she's a no tree person so guess what we got in our house Tre happy wife somebody wanted to clap over there happy wife happy life they say and um but when you know him it doesn't matter whether you got a tree or not I know some Believers they'll leave a a church over just a communion cup whether you have the little ones or One Singular cup and there's many things you can find and you'll see that brother brandom lived a balanced life and he did both and so he gave us the truth of Christmas and with the Christmas tree and all the lights and tensils but yet he enjoyed the season and I I love how brother George brought that today and so we're just I'm so good to be back in the house of the Lord good back good to be back to see you folks see you Saints had a wonderful time in Tanzania and I preached eight Services there in those days and in there um I was told my wife I was going to tease and she kind of got on me about it so I said I wouldn't but I guess I will um in their program they had it set for the preaching service we had two days just for pastors an morning service and an evening service that song specials songs prayer request specials and then the time the portion for preaching how much time do you think they allowed for the preacher to preach three hours thank you three hours for the preacher to preach and they feel short if you don't take that and so but I never took it and then in the evening session was a two-hour slot and then we repeated that and then one day we had three services one brother couldn't preach so they plugged me in there and I preached eight services and the Lord really blessed us in a tremendous way so my voice is gone a little bit and I trust it to come back to me and I certainly uh enjoyed the the the fellowship I was just blessed being in those services the old the young the middle AG they all take notes throughout the whole service they're feeding on every word you read a quote they're kid they're catching that quote and they're going to write it down and go home and read that again and just to see that and there's so many things you think you're coming from a first world country to teach them but they have so many things that they can teach us and I learned a a whole lot just from being amongst them in the midst of them and so we certainly thank the Lord and I think that's what missionary work does it puts you uh um to see how other people are serving the lord but when the when I preach the word and the Holy Ghost came in the meeting they act just like you act and the Holy Spirit over there it's the same Holy Spirit over here and the quotes in the Bible over there are the same here and so we thank God that the same God over there is the same God here and that's what joins us together didn't know their language that keep they preach Swahili and um there's a lot of cultural thing differences there but when we start preaching this word and getting into this message there's an atmosphere that unites us all and so I'm so glad to be back with you Merry Christmas I think this is the first time I've seen Aaliyah or karesa since I've been back Levi picked me up and I saw Sharon of course and so happy to be back here with you so Merry Christmas to you all and God bless you richly and we certainly enjoy all the song specials and we trust the Lord will bless you very very richly this this season and he'll bless you amen so with that said let's stand to our feet and um um I think some did someone else have a song No there today that was it so we appreciate that and so let's go to the Lord in prayer and thank him for his goodness and mercy to us Heavenly Father we thank you for bringing us together once again we thank you Lord that we know that Christmas is a time of worship Easter worship it's the gospel message you died you bled and died you were buried but then you rose again with all power in your hands and we have the Holy Spirit tonight in our in our today in our lives because of what you did at the cross and Lord you're worthy of all the praise and for the rest of my life I rededicate it back to you Lord I give you my heart I give you my life Lord that I may know know him and the fellowship of his sufferings and the power of the Cross Lord that counting all things as lost to gain that knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ we thank you Father may you go with each one be with them in their homes today and Lord we say God bless may you bless them and it's a Merry Christmas Lord the worship we give you the praise and we ask your blessings upon each one as we prepare to leave here and you go with go with this we pray remember the saints that would like to be here today but they couldn't they're sick and feeble in their bodies oh God the prayer request that we heard Lord the different ones that need a touch in their bodies Our dear sister mcti where ever she may be sister Deborah Lord call upon her her name present her Lord and ask you to bless her and Shan father help them Lord the little sarano girl that's going through this Health crisis touch her in her Faith Lord give her the Faith Lord to accept the healing that you've already paid for her and Lord just for each one we thank you father for bringing us into your presence once again Lord we want to grow in your grace and mercy grow in Revelations Lord mightily Lord that our expectations will come from the word and not from the world all the stress and [Music] anxiety because we didn't get what we expected or we deserved but Lord when we look into the word we thank you for all that you've given us and that's where our expectations come from the word of God we expect to be in a rapture we expect to have a body change we expect to be filled with the Holy Ghost Lord one more time is our prayer we thank you ask these blessings in Jesus name we pray amen i' L i' love for you to shake hands with your neighbor and tell them how much you love them and say God bless you as we sing this song thank you Jesus thank you tell them God bless you brother George praise the Lord [Music] amen God bless you would like to say a word that's yes that I I thank you every day I thank you Lord Jesus Christ for the grace that you have given us oh I can't repay but from my heart [Music] oh thank you all my heart I thank youus Lord Jesus have given us though I can't repay for from my heart like to say that I thank you one more time thank you [Music] Jesus brother Ben come forward for the grace giv us though I I can't [Music] repay like to say that I Amen brother Ben wanted to greet the Saints he had something to say I bless him amen God bless you all I just kind of wanted to share a little thing that's in my heart come come on real strong this morning um brother brandom said that Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the [Music] new Jehovah of the oldest Jesus of the new as brother was mentioned morphe he changed his form to because brother brandom said what kind of God would be a god that would send his son it's like me sending my son to die for somebody that's not even right you know what he did he he came himself he came himself that makes it a very special to me yes yes yes that it was the almighty God yes yes IM morphe changed himself into a son cuz he's he's Eternal he couldn't come he's an eternal spirit he had to become flesh you had to come in a sunship but Jesus Christ was Almighty Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the you when that came to my heart that made it so much more special to me I I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart yes sir and I just that was just in my heart that cuz sometimes we think that God is up there and Jesus with a son and like it was the almighty he came himself to to Die For Us in Redemption he there was a law in the in the Old Testament where it had to be a kins folk it had to be one of us so almighty God is a spirit he had to become flesh so he he created a body to come and die and pay the price for us and our sins put them there our sins did but then his when he shed that blood he forgave us of our sins that's a paradox yeah there I remember when I heard the life story one time where brother Brandon was he had just lost his wife and uh his his baby and he was crushed he he tried to Comm commit suicide twice and I remember he said he he was a a linean he said that there was a line like 2,000 volts he and he said uh he said he looked on the hill he saw a cross he said my sins put him there he tried to grab that that Lon and he found himself on the ground but what a love he had for for Christ said he said my sins put him there when he's thinking about that when has just left his wife and his and his daughter I remember a brother then that lost his his his son and he was he was like a very spiritual and after he lost his son he he he left he said how can how can he not resurrect my son and it was just the opposite the prophet was wasn't like that and it's just I just wanted to share that from my heart just so we can know that who Jesus Christ really is he is almighty God just thank you very much thank you praise brother thank you amen let's give the Lord a hand of Praise yes that's the gospel message right there amen so with that go knowing what Jesus did for you God became a man to die for our sins because he loves you amen so God bless you you're dismissed in the name of the Lord amen though I can't repay [Music] heart every day I thank you Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] can't repay from my heart like to say that I that I thank you all my life I thank you Jesus [Music] giving us can't rep say that I thank you thank you Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] jus [Music] okay
