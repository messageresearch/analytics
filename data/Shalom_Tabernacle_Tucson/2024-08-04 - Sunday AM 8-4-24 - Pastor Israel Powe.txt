to your word Lord and draw closer to you establish every heart and Grace father let us grow Lord in you and we'll thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ amen we're going to be reading from Revelation chapter 6 verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great Earth earthquake and lo there was a great earthquake and the and the sun became black as sath cloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every Bond Man and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand sing only believe only be only be all things are possible only believe only be only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother brandham now all inside or outside that believes and has never made your your public uh confession that you're finished with sin and you you want the mercies of God and you've accepted them in Jesus Christ the fool he'll be ready to baptize anybody who wants to be baptized today or tomorrow right now or whenever it may be do you enjoy the six seal you see where it's opened at now have you believed it in said who has believed our report and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed believe the report then the arm of the Lord is revealed the arm the word of God is revealed the Lord willing now tomorrow morning I'll try my best to answer those questions I'll spend probably the rest of the night and or most of it in prayer over them I'm getting about from 1 to 3 hours a night I never got to bed last night till going on 1 and at 3:00 I was in study see I'm going to have to answer for this that's right we're too close for anything any foolishness or any presuming or halfway believe I've got to see it first and then when I see it it's got to be in the word too and so far by the grace of God they perfectly I took it from all the way through you know that it's it's Blended right together it's got to be thus sayeth the Lord because it's not only as it say it from I me knowing it myself but the word of the Lord is thus sayth the Lord and here is the word taking what he has given to me and blending it together and showing you so you know yourself it's thus sayith the Lord see here's the word says so and then the Revelation that he gives me which is contrary to what any of us has ever thought well contrary to what I thought because I never went into it like that but now we find it slides right together and what is it it's thus sayeth the Lord amen it's been a place open up holding there to this hour and then the Lord comes and pushes it right in like that so you see there it is it's it's the Lord oh I love him I love him with all my heart I remember you we couldn't get to the altar several held their hands up now see it's an individual affair with you it's whatever you want to do see the hour is so close to hand you ought to be pressing as hard as you could not had to be pulled full things just pressing trying to get in Lord don't let me out don't leave me out Lord the doors are closing if I can just get in see God will close the door one day he did in the day of Noah and the beat on the door is that right now remember the Bible said that in the e the fruits of the spirit what proves what it is the fruits of the tree proves what kind of a tree it is not the bark the fruit now notice it now I believe I got it yeah we're getting it I I I better not say this because is it might cause a confusion when I said the day the Rapture H would come I uh now if you say you you'll take it all right watch watch all right that's up to you when the sleeping virgin see that thought she was prayed up to come back the bribe was done gone amen amen it went and she didn't know it like a thief in the night then they begin to bang on the door and what happened what taken place they were cast into the tribulation period the Bible said there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth is that right when is going to be brother sister I don't know but me it may be just me here now see this this is this is my thought see I I I believe it's so close um each day I I want I'm just trying to walk as softly as I can and I when in know one something happened today and I seen something come up I I just I couldn't get my breath anymore see there he was standing there that light standing right there and here it was ano of Truth amen amen although God I couldn't say that I I can't say that I can't I just walked out of the room went out walked up and down I thought my what can I do and I I have to go fishing or something or boy you you I can't tell you see so we have a good time don't we praise the Lorden we're in a we're in a a tremendous time amen see for my heart is overflowed with happiness and joy but when I think of this world and the thousands that I know that's lost black shadow then your heart just bleeds what can you do what can you you just feel the Holy Spirit crying out in your heart like it must have been in our Lord when he looked over Jerusalem his own people said Jerusalem Jerusalem how off would I have hovered you as a hen would are Brew but you would not just feel the holy spirit said how often I would have geted you but you would not we're we're right here at something friends Whatever It Is God knows nobody nobody knows when it's going to happen that's a secret nobody knows when it's going to happen but Jesus told us when you see these things all these things is what what it went comparing with the six seal to what he said in Matthew 24 I remember what he said when you see these things come to begin to come to pass then the times at the door watch the very next verse the 30 the 30 and 31st verses is one on down 32nd 33 verses he said and he shall send forth his angels to the four corners of the Heavens to the Four Winds together his elected amen is that right so now learn now remember he stopped right there he never went ahead at that Sixth Seal he never said anything about the seventh he said the first 2 third fourth fifth and sixth but he stopped there never mentioned about anything but watch the next thing he said now learn a parable then he starts on Parable he said these things will be he's answering them three questions what will be the these signs and what will be the sign of your coming what will be the sign of the end of the world and the sixth one there was the end of the world and the sounding of the seventh angel raised up the hands and swore by him that lives forever the time shall be no more their Earth is giving birth to a new one it's over here we are right you're at the door oh I tremble what must I do Lord what what else can I do see and then just think of seeing that place and those precious people I stood there looking at myself and I thought oh God what they came this this I I ought to push him I to just reach out the audience and got him and push you can't do that you and no man can come except my father draws but here's one consolation we have all the father has given me will come but the rest of at those organizations depending on them like that see and he deceived all that lived upon dwelt upon the Earth whose names were not written in that Lamb's Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world so see it's a sad thing the only thing you can do is just just just just stay right with the word watch this whatever he says do and then do that see whatever says do do that you look out there and think oh my they do this oh it's just you don't realize what a stream now I want to say I Sports P off lot of people say brother Brandon with the ministry of that type I have to watch because people just take them tapes just try to pick them to pieces you know so when uh they said brother BR wish we had a Ministry you don't know what you're saying yeah honest you don't know what goes with it brothers and sisters and the responsibility when you got people hangs to what you say remember if you tell them wrong God will require their blood at your hands and you think of that it's a terrific thing so be lovely love Jesus with all your heart just F be simple don't never try to try to figure out anything just be simple before God because more you try to figure out the farther you get away from him see just simply believe him say now well when will he come if he comes today all right if he comes 20 years years from now still all right I'm going to go just the way I'm going now following him Lord if you can use me anywhere Here I Am Lord if it's 100 years from today if my great great great great grandchildren still live to see it coming let Lord I don't know when it's going to be but let me just walk right today just with you see I I won't cause I I Rise that day just as seems I took a little nap somewhere coming down to that glorious Palace shter that kingdom of God there where all the old will be young Hallelujah where the white robes are already the man and women has changed in the beauty the very art of a of a a handsome man a a lovely woman standing there and all the beauty and statue of a young woman and a young man standing there and never can get old never can be sinful never can be anything of jealousy or hatred or anything oh my I think a tapes is off now I just got about three four minutes I want to talk to you is that all right yeah amen amen now this is just personal because tomorrow I that's going to be so tremendous I think I just better say it now see I go stand uh this is just for us now I was just um you know uh I got a wife that I love and that's me and I I would not even a maritor because my love for my first wife and yet as much as I cared for her I I wouldn't have married her if it hadn't been God told me to do it and you know the story of it how she went to pray and how I did and he told me exactly what to do and go Mar at that time to do it she's a lovely woman and she's praying for me tonight and so now it's 8:00 at home she's probably praying now now notice one day she said to me she said Bill she said I'm just want to ask you a question about heaven I said all right mey what is it she said you you know I love you I said yep right after this happened up here she said you know that hope loved you too I said yeah and she said now she said I don't think I would be jealous she said but hope was and she said now when we get to heaven and you said you seen her there I said she was there I've seen her I've seen her twice there she's there she's waiting for me to come so is a so is Sharon I've seen her just the same I'm looking at you I seen her there and I said she said well now when we get over there said which ones go to be your wife I said both of you there won't be any yet both of you be she said I can't understand it and I said now honey sit down let me explain something to you I said now I know you love me and you know how I love you and respects and honor now for instance what if I dress up went downtown and some little prostitute real pretty come throw her arms around me and say oh brother brandom I sure love you start putting her arms around me hugging me what' you think she said I don't think I'd like that very well and uh I said um I want to ask you something do you who do you love the best if had to be a showdown me or the Lord Jesus asked his family talking and she said the Lord Jesus said yes bill as much as I love you but before I would give him up I'd give you up I said thank you honey I'm glad to hear you say that now I said now what if that same little woman would come up to Jesus and throw her arms around him and say Jesus I love you what would you think about that she said I'd enjoy that see it changes from felio to AG goo think it's a high love see and there's no such thing as husband and wife is as a raiseed children it's all gone the the female and male sex the glands are all they're all the same there see there's none of it no more see there's no sex glands at all not at all you're just just think of yourself without a sex gland the reason they were put in US is to repopulate the Earth you see but there there won't be any there there won't be neither male nor female gland God no but the statue of the art of God will be there that's exactly right but we'll be truly genuine no no felio at all all agapo see therefore a wife would be no more and just some lovely something it's it's yours and she you belong to each other there's no such thing as h no no not even see the fio part's not even there at all see there can't be anything like a jealousy ain't nothing to be jealous about there ain't no such a thing there you never know such a thing is that see and just the lovely uh young man and young women to live and then after she said I see it now Bill I said yes I want tell you a little thing happened this was a dream I was asleep and I've never told this publicly before I told it to a couple of people but never publicly before as I know it I I dreamed about a month after that that I was standing one day and

of y'all but so we'll see who said no okay oh yeah that's what I'm talking about yeah it's not too much for me either of course it's it's easier to preach meetings than it is to run them in my opinion

take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book and our text is coming out of Ephesians chapter 6 verse number 17 it says take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and that's the title The Sword of the spirit amen God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so glad to see the shers here this morning they're faithful Believers and they're here from Phoenix and um my good friend the brother there and his friend they've been around many many times and I haven't seen them for quite some time it's so good to hear him he called me yesterday so it's good to see them amen God bless you now we see the scriptures that we read here are admonishing us not to add or to take away from the word of the lord we read many scriptures for you last week about the um the words of the Lord being written down as a memorial and I'll just read through a few of those scriptures and just to set the foundation and put our minds on the same direction how God is the author of the word and he commanded that it be written down it was his intentions for it to be recorded it was never the intentions for it to go in one ear and out the other now if God can give us a memory so we can retain his words that's beautiful that's great amen some people have that retention ability but a lot of us can't retain it all in fact I know all of us we can't retain it all but we can get get something all right and hopefully you know more today than what you did when you started and this is the this is the beautiful thing it starts in Sunday school I believe or at home with Mom and Dad teaching you to memorize scripture St John 3:16 how many know that scripture do you even need to read your Bible it's been written in the table of your heart that's where it should be be its final resting place anyways for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and it's written there there's the gospel message it's in the table of your heart now and the tables of your mind and in Exodus chapter 17 the Lord is moving from Moses to Joshua and it says in verse 13 and Joshua disc confited amalec and his people with the edge of The Sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in the book and rehearse it in the years of Joshua for I will utterly put out from remembrance amalik from the under the heavens so the Lord is telling Moses to write it down for a book of Memorial and after it's written down go reread read it to Joshua Joshua needs to hear it and if you can get Joshua a copy get him a copy too um Exodus 341 and the Lord said unto Moses heue thee two tables of stone like unto the first and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first table which you broke breest and the Lord said unto Moses Exodus 34:27 says write thou these words for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel Deuteronomy 1718 and 20 goes in detail about how a king should take the words of the Lord the law of Moses and rehearse those I think it's good for a king I think it's good for a pastor I think it's good for a mom or dad I think it's good for every everybody to take the word of the Lord and rehearse and reread and re internalize and redigested upon his throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law and a book out of that which is before the priest the Levites and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may love learn to fear the lord his God you see the purpose now it's not just so you can win a a a scripture memorization contest it's not so that you can argue but that you can fear the word of the Lord Thy word Lord have I hid in my heart that I don't sin against you that's the purpose of it to take that word and let Let It Be inscribed in your spirit down in your heart the scriptures in Jeremiah 36 1-4 says and it came to pass the fourth year of jeaken the son of Josiah king of Judah that this word came unto Jeremiah from the Lord saying take thee a rooll of a book and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations from the day I spake unto thee from the days of Josiah even unto this day it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin and so this is the purpose that we read it in fact no service is complete without reading the word that's the reason why we come is to hear the words of the Lord something a crumb one scripture half of a scripture a whole chapter whatever something that the Lord spoke to me today from his word now many of us know who's here and who's not here many of us know what time it is and what time time I should be done many of us know a lot of things but when we leave from here I trust that we got something written in our heart from the word of God it's sad many pulpits today you coming to church and you're getting the politics of the day you're getting the news of the day you're getting the pastor's personal feelings of the day but I want to get the word of the Lord and that's what my ears and our ears should be in tune to hear I guarantee you if you come I I love brother Chris's testimony as he talked that he was a Catholic and I've been to a Catholic mass a number of them here recently actually and you know I have all the little things that they do and the little things and they they Crossing themselves and doing all this but when that priest or whoever it is some sometimes it's a woman up at the mic whoever it is that's reading the word of the Lord man and I stand to attention my spirit is like oh yes I'm eating now something's good going to happen now because it's the word of the Lord and I think if we came to church with that attitude we would be less disappointed I will disappoint you brother sister will disappoint you our skills and talents will disappoint you but if you came here and they read the word you should be full you should have said amen that's enough to dance on right there just hearing the word the word of the Lord is being preaching somebody take off running set on fire like well we ain't even singing We Don't Need No music to dance I tell you what the reason why we dance is written right here amen the word of the Lord elevated in your life elevated in our services elevated in our expectations and you won't be so mad it'll put a smile on your face just from the reading of the word now can I close now huh can I keep going young man said I keep going so he don't have no kids he ain't married and he said keep going but the word of the Lord that's why we came here Saints amen don't leave here upset with your mouth stuck out talking about what they didn't do or what didn't happen did they read the word did you say Amen thank you then it should be complete because this is the highlight of the service this is the Highlight this is the highlight of Our Lives is God's word and God wanted it to be recorded and written down Deuteronomy 30 vers number 10 says if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to keep his Commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from the neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou sh say who shall go for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should as say who shall go over for the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou May how did it get in your heart before it can get in your mouth it had to get in your heart how did it get in your heart somebody had to read that to you somebody had to speak that to you somebody had to bring the word of the Lord to you and you catch it and then you place it in your heart there's the blessing right there the work can be flying all around you the work could be laying on your shelves the work could be in your phone or tablet but if if it ain't in your heart we missed it it's a strikeout it's a it's a terrible Miss if it ain't in your heart Romans 2:11 says there's no respect of persons with God for as many have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law and as many as have Sinn in the law shall be judged by the law for not the hearers of the law are just before God but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law what written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or excusing one another you know you don't have to have your Bible out in front of you knowing that something is right or wrong if somebody read something out of the Bible to you it's written in your heart and in your conscience so then when you go to do something that word pops up that's what we want anyways want that word to come to the Forefront of whatever you're about to do or say any act you're going to engage into you want the word of the Lord whatever format however it came into your heart you want that to come up and remember that now the beauty of this word is when you keep it in its completeness it's beautiful it's powerful when we don't take nothing from it it's holds its Integrity when we just say it in its rawest form the unedited version and this is um what we want we we want to be have our integrity that uh we want to be unimpaired we wanted to be honest everything that we say and do and that's what that's the way we want the word you know the the word of the Lord had to be recorded from people who had the Integrity to keep the text the text and don't add to it based upon how it's going to affect you or your family or your friends I need you to record my word and I might be recording you might have to record something that's to your own detriment but if you have the Integrity of the word the Integrity in your ministry the Integrity as a Christian you're not going to twist none of the scriptures none of the quotes or anything you'll just say it let the text keep its integrity and if you can't handle it that way then leave it alone amen amen you're not in you don't have integrity if you don't let the text speak The Way It Was Written that's right the the text in itself has its own original Integrity it came the way it did there's some areas that look a little rough a little tough the vernacular doesn't work in all uh you know ages and times doesn't speak well in this group and that group but you still got to say what it said amen now in keeping the Integrity of the text it might mean you lose your job you might lose some friends you might lose a lot of things but you will gain favor with the Lord if you stay with the original text the unedited version the one that we must Embrace and so with this this thought I like to approach the new versions of the Bible that we have today many of them have lost this Integrity I think there's 16 scriptures that are not in many of the new versions of the Bible the King James version has a certain amount and then the new versions have taken out part of some of those versions be some of those verses because they're not valid it that's right for for whatever their mind whatever it is they they come up with and so um the prophet of God takes the King James version and that's what he use not criticizing the other versions they have their part their Noble works and and that you can refer to them that's great that's nice but if I'm going to point a class or a group of people or a young man coming up I just say stick with the Bible that the prophet used stick with the Bible that that Pillar of Fire came down over amen now the other versions are great the vernacular is smoother it's easier reading it's you know it's you know they they they they made it they have all kind of versions of the Bible but be careful because Satan probably has a version too and it probably will be coming out and he started coming out with more and more I'm going to take two scriptures that are not in your King James Version Bible Acts 8:37 1 John 57-8 now this one in Acts chapter 8: 37 is a seemingly I brought this on Thursday night to the Saints there and some of the Saints there in on Thursday night in Phoenix and it goes so much deeper than this you know you have some guys some gentlemen out there that are called the King James only people and they they call any other Bible a work of the devil some of them do that's that wasn't the attitude of the prophet he you know he he included that the ls of Bible and all the other new work Bibles they have their place but look at verses 8 verses 37 and chapter 8th chapter of Acts and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God that verse is not in many of the newer translations you won't find it here's the one that really gets me it's 1 John 5:7 it's debatable it's been used in debates on the godhead and the Oneness of the godhead they've the trinitarian Ians are very well happy that this verse isn't in some of the newer Bibles and here's why let me read it in the King James vergins 1 John 5: 7-8 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one now here's a version here I think this is the NIV says for there are three that Testify the spirit the water and the blood and the three are in agreement and that's it amen that that's all of it so if you're raised in a church under this version of the Bible and have never read the King James version which the prophet explained the Father the word in the spirit then you can see the discrepancy there and and here here here's here's where it's a big deal you say brother Israel that's just one scripture that's where it starts you're not holding the Integrity of the text if you don't keep it the way it originally was so if I can take away one scripture today and then the next Generation take away two or three scriptures then what we going to to have in a few years so this is why maintaining the protection that God put in writing the word down first recording it yes writing it down rehearsing it now he's going to protect it by saying don't add or take away from it he caps both ends of it don't add to it don't take nothing away from it that keeps that keeps the power of the that keeps the power of the word intact that's the way we want it in its original form amen somebody and so this adding or takeway is is just simply a no no so let's go even further in that thought the adding or taking away is is even adding an interpretation that God never gave so you're not just adding words I'm going to add a new verse but if you add an interpretation to the verse to the word that God never gave you're in violation of adding or taking away this is very very important Saints yes it is because Satan like a roaring lion seeking how he can take away or add something because when he does that he makes the word say something that it does not say now brother vanam deals with some of this in the message recognizing your day in this message he talked about splicing tapes two places here recognizing your day in this message paragraph number 29 let me see if that's what I want yes notice again the Seven Seals which I had no idea it was that here the Tabernacle he spoke it and sent me to Tucson Arizona telling you all what happened what would happen and there is men sitting present today who has who was there to see it happen just exactly the way it was told here would happen seven angels would come then the newspaper packed that and the magazines Across the Nation mysterious circle of light in the form of a pyramid just like I drawed it here and showed you raised up from where those angels were standing and went 30 mil high and was 27 miles across or either 27 miles high and 30 mil across I forget which it was and was seen through the states just above tcon Arizona right where it happened same time see the Bible God is is not just this is just not someone trying to press something to you but to reveal to you the very spiritual application of this hour and then the next message that opened up the Seven Seals which undone all the hidden mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and so forth which the world so rudely attacks nowadays attacks it and says it's wrong this that here the other day in AR Ona splicing tapes to try to make me say things that I didn't say just remember the vision about the Arizona proposition the Bible said it was far better for you that you had a rock at your neck and another thing that whosoever let him be preacher or what he will will take one word away from it add one word to it people putting their own interpretation upon the word as it's been given trying to make it say something that I did not say and not my it's and not my word it's his word who shall add to or take away you know this splicing of tapes you can do that in the text you can do that in preaching you can do that in arguing knowing full well there's more context on the subject but for you to get a point across you only want to highlight one part of it that's not being that's not holding the Integrity I can't have any respect for a man or a woman that would do that take bits and pieces of a vision bits and pieces of a message and try to make it say something that it does not say just because I can't explain it all I have to twist it and turn it to make it more palatable for you but God gave it to us the way he gave it to us can't we be honest enough just to say what he said huh is that right you know I've had this let me pull over here just a minute I've had this question asked me so many times y'all excuse me for this so but I have to say it I had this question asked me so many times concerning the church said brother Israel do you believe the return Ministry people have asked me that checking out checking out the uh you know our my Ministry or what I believe you know they don't want to know how I got saved they don't want to know what kind of Christian I am they just want to know that one little part because if you believe that one little part I'm GNA put you in a box I'm going to judge you I'm going to deal with you I mean there's so many more things that we could talk about let's talk about fishing let's talk about something else but you want to talk about that one little part and why so I always say uh I don't know what you're talking about in that language a return Ministry I don't have any quotes for that but now if you're talking about Visions brother will oh yes I believe all of those I believe all of the Visions that's not a problem at all no man no no no there's no man there's no group of people going to make me feel ashamed for believing any of the Visions you got to be careful how the devil would twist that on you right following some doctrine of people and what other brothers did with the word and how they mishandled it and how they got out on the Forefront they said we the people that believe this and the people that that's just lazy laziness if you want to know what somebody believes sit down and talk to them in the word and find find out what they believe out of God's word and these banners and titles that we call people to judge one another by find out what the brother believes in the word does he believe every word then he's one of your brothers amen so brother vandom is dealing with this splicing of the tapes in paragraph 220 he says this in light of this hour that we're now living the light of the day that we're now living in precious and beloved ones who come from different states across the country let us now me with you on this altar let us take inventory how is the spirit of God in our hearts today remember it's the spirit uncondemned uncontaminated any church doctrine everything has gone completely amen you would be Daron to try to add to that or take from it for if you do try to put the interpretation on it yourself your part is taken from The Book of Life are you trying to say something that the spirit hasn't said are you trying to make it sound like it said something or you just take it exactly what it said and leave it like that are you splicing cutting taping doing things that's not not right have you say well I just don't feel like I should do this or maybe I know my church don't believe it that's just one man's word about it that one man is God the Bible here says you should not cut your hair the Bible said it shall come to pass women wear garments like a man and how they would be an Abomination to God how the Holy Spirit spoke through it this humble unworthy vessel that just happened to be standing present in the age that that great king said here is my suprer my word here's my scepter rather take my scepter and go forth and bring the message so this keeping the Integrity of the word keeping the Integrity of the quote that is what our heart's desire is this is where when you come into a conversation you don't have a message I don't have a message so I can't lose cuz I don't have nothing in the fight I'm just standing behind what already was said you know the Bible and standing with the word of God is not fighting in the word is find out if you you're right and they're wrong on the word you can't be wrong if you're just staying with what the word says it's not your word it's God's word and he's the one who brings it to pass now this keeping this text together and keeping uh embracing that and holding that version of the word that God give this is how we want to approach every every other quote every scripture every Vision every book of the Bible this is how we approach it amen and so and and and and we just you know get our feelings out of it and just take what God said about it in his word now the prophet of God deals with this oneman message and I have to say that you know I I think many people get this confused with that the Onan message terminology bothers some people because they believe that you're saying it's one man to be saved or it's just one man that's in the body of Christ or the body of Christ it's a one man message because it's a prophet that brought the word but there's many men and women that follow it that are true believers many Elders pastors teachers uh people that follow the word women brothers sisters they're we're all included in that and it and this this the two highlights from the word is with Moses and Elijah this Moses had um the daans the koras that rose up against his authority in the word and these were brothers in the message of the day and they rose up against Moses and they said that Moses thought that he was the only one that had these gifts in his life Moses you're the only Holy One among us but you know who didn't have a problem with that was Joshua you know Caleb didn't have a problem with that they didn't have a problem with Moses's position in the word and they won't have a problem with it today because it wasn't about Moses being better than anyone this is what God made him in order to bring forth the Commandments and so him bringing forth the Commandments and God using them the way he did and highlighting and elevating his ministry the way he did you know why would I have a problem with that except I had the spirit of Dayan and Kora upon me this brother Ram deals with this in the message why it had to be Shepherds he says paragraph 112 now the word of God does not come to a theologian he's the one who messes it up that's right there's no such a thing as ever saying you saying well this guy's a theologian that just puts him further away from the were than anything I know of see the word of the Lord God the unchanging God never does change anywhere in the Bible the word of God always did come to prophets not to theologians or doctors to prophets and they always every time was refused and rejected now what's wrong with a theologian a theologian studies theology a biologist studies biology ology there's nothing wrong with a biologist and a theologian is a studier of the word they take the Theology and they break the words down biblically scripturally and they bring a better understanding of the history or the root of the word and they can study so much that they can get a doctor's degree and be able to explain it so well but the word of the Lord doesn't come to a theologian the word of the Lord comes to a prophet so the theologians today told us that the King James virgin Bible is old and out of date we need a new one but that's the Bible that the prophet used so what Bible do I want to use where do I want to stand with the Theology of the day or the prophetic inspiration of the day God calls the prophet and he uses the prophet to bring forth this word of the Lord amen amen Prophet God continues and who do you say this is 1964 the question comes up in the wilderness see now I want you to watch my brethren now remember these people enjoy them blessings they enjoy the preaching of this Prophet this anointed one they believed him they followed him but there rose up in the wilderness one by by the name of Dayan one by the name of Kora and they said this has got to be a oneman affair Moses thinks he's the only one God's called that one man message they didn't want it no they didn't want it and God never did deal but with one person at a time it's always a oneman message when did you ever when did he ever deal with the people outside of just one person it's an individual it ain't a group you're responsible to God each one of you you say oh I believe it just what you do you just entertain it you entertain a thought so brother brandom is bringing out this dayon and Kora how they had a problem with the one man message and God has used one man all the way through the Bible all the way through amen and then even in this last day a Onan message on the tape still a oneman Ministry for this day and many have a problem with that but some of us don't the True Believers don't have a problem with that and what's the what's the end goal then I can see almost where some of these brothers feel like they're the eighth messenger or they're taking brother Bon's place that's more scriptural I guess than this group idea that the five-fold ministry is trying to uh propagate that brother brandham is gone now he preached the word and now we have the spoken word we who which one of you have the spoken word God doesn't deal with groups of men like that but when it comes to the word of the lord The Authority the direction that the Church of the Living God is to follow that's a oneman Ministry now we all have our ministry that God calls us to each Minister has his ministry that God calls him to a wife her Ministry at home pastors evangelists whoever it may be they have their we have a Ministry yes but our ministry isn't that everybody here are tapes but there is a Ministry where every everybody has to hear their Tes it's a on man Ministry and you'll see that attitude flexing up more and more as we see the days approaching but my um my instruction to you my my job today is to remind you not to add or take away from anything that the prophet said or the Bible you know this this principle of not adding or taking away isn't just with the Bible it's with the message don't add or take away from it so some brother you'll send me a quote here's the explanation of the tent Reverend so and so Pastor so and so preached a beautiful message explaining the tent if you can't explain it by sending me a tape of the Prophet H what is that too much Saints I'm I'm just dumb like that I'm that dumb Caleb I'm picky eater picky eater I got to know where my food is coming from that's not my mom's cooking mom's quicking cooking ain't no question I'mma eat that mom cook it I'mma eat it now sister so and so brother so and so like who cooked that do they even know what a cornbread is can't just eat anybody's cornbread I can I only got so much space to get full it's got to be the right stuff huh this is spiritually speaking you know the explanation of the third pool if it ain't from the message or I've got to twist it and turn it and make it say something that it did not say I need to keep the Integrity of the vision and the way we do that we start by just saying what the playing what the prophet said about it start there that's your Baseline start right there many young people have an explanation of the great vision of the third pool they have explanation and they can't even see where brother random said it their explanation came through their Pastor or the Ministries today so we go online to look and see what this means or what that means why don't you pick up the prophet and let him explain and let him you know open it up the way he gave it was a progression the way he introduced it you just don't pick out highlights the part you want that makes it sound okay they can take this but they can't take that they can take this tell me everything he said bring it up from the 50s all the way up like how he brought it and then bring it all the way up amen there's nothing to hide am there's nothing that I'm trying to you know maintain I want to be right all the time I can't be but the word is right all the time so they had a problem with this one man message and I am warned to warn you stay with that original word of the Lord amen and that original word was given to a prophet can I move forward just a little bit so we don't add to we don't take away it's been written down we hold the complete Integrity of it and from beginning to end the the this comfortable places like marriage and divorce huh is that an easy tape is that for everybody yes or no it's for everybody in the bride but it's not for everybody in the world you know that that marriage and divorce tape it's like man brother Randon why you say it like that like wow man let me um H how can I do this let me see how can I do this let me think tap on my head see if I can think faster how should I do how should I approach the marriage and divorce this sister is talking about coming to the word she wants to know about these things eternal life and salvation wants to know about the message okay give her all the message but don't give her marriage and divorce because marriage and divorce might confuse her she's already confused yes sir that's the problem everybody is confused they need the light in its purest form to take off the rubber gloves and the games that people play about the truth of the original sin this is why we got the problems we have today because nobody told us the truth but a prophet came in his humility in the Integrity of staying with the vision he preached it when nobody else would he stood with it when nobody thought it was popular but look at his ministry today a huge portion of Heaven awaits you it's the harder way but it's my way hallah it's not easy to keep your integrity you got to say it when you don't want to say it say it when it hurts say it when it hurts your friends even your own children and we'll find out today in an age like this aren't you so glad he did aren't you glad that he kept it clean I'm so glad there's my confidence in the message he can't be Bal he can't be twisted he can't be you know manipulated he's going to say what God put in his mouth to say hallelujah amen write the vision make it plain so when the people read it they got something to run with they got something to talk about something to preach about amen praise His name so we hold that we keep that now there are some messages a number of them that are prophetic that brother randam preached as I wind down here he talks and I read one of them for you I think last week in that message the indictment how he says that a message like that couldn't have been preached 50 years ago and then he says it couldn't have been preached even 10 years ago from 1963 he says but today it can be preached what the indictment where they have turned their back on God any he put a thus sayith the Lord on this country he said that this nation can not in will not repent you know when I hear that and I really Embrace that then I stop fighting with these people out here it's not worth it you fighting with them and what they trying to do to our country look what they doing you know we need to take our country back uh-uh you need to go back to God that's the only that's taking the country back no no no it's going to the fire huh it's over I'm not I'm I'm not uh you know I'm not ignoring things that are wrong in this makes me mad too it inflames me too but at the end of the day it's like what I'm getting upset about what am I arguing with people I don't know about what am I all fired up about yes sir when that fire should be turned towards the word and he gives this message the indictment and he says it as a true 100% American who love this country and he said that this country will not and cannot repent it was a disgrace what they did to the word of the Lord they took this prophet in they took him to court try to take his money through the taxes and so forth probably help more Americans than many other Americans but they wanted to come after him said the spirit of the nation the spirit of all nations are ruled by Satan yeah that's not you know we can be you know we you know I'm I'm an American I'm a proud American and you're not more of American than I am I'm not more of you I'm just one that's it and the sentiments that I have have moved and shifted from what's going on in the neighborhood to what's going on in God's word and in my life that's what I want to be fired up about because that's what's going in the Rapture is the word that has been made Flesh on the tables of my heart huh yes you look at it long enough good enough you'll be mad too but stay with the word and you'll have something to preach about and stand for so this message the indictment was a timing message brother Bam put the timetable on there he put the timetable in 19 56 on this country but then in he says this attitude you couldn't see it um 10 years ago or 50 years ago and then he brings another message entitled the token and this message the token was another one of those timing messages he said that he was out in the woods and the Lord spoke to him and told him to they've gone up so far now bring this token message to them what was the message of the token it was Israel were enslaves for hundreds and hundreds of years and and then finally there there there came a deliverer and the deliverer was a prophet Moses and then finally there's a message of the Passover of the blood being applied now we know you're all Jews we know you you been circumcised we know that you have you know you you you're a part of the Great economy of the Hebrew but but this is another level here we're going into an exodus and so now I'm going to require a token from every household even if you're the lineage of Levi or Reuben or Gad or whatever lineage if you don't come under the token you'll be left out and that's what this message the token was and brother Brandon brings it out in um I'm going to take paragraph 74 9399 and paragraph 37 137 in that message and just bring it up to you okay the prophet of God says this here showing the timetable and bringing it through and there's a benefit to it you know in this token he talks about the Assurance how when you have it applied in your life then there's no worries all the pressure is taken away and he says this here paragraph number 74 and the message the token said this is the evening time of the age that we live in this is the evening time for the church this is the evening time for me me this is the evening time of my message I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in the evening time of the gospel and we just come through justification so forth but this is the time that the token has to be applied I told you last Sunday I had something I want to talk to you about this is it the time that when you just can't play with it it's got to be done if it's ever going to be done it's got to be done now because we can see that the Wrath is about ready to pass through the land and everything from under the token will perish the blood has identifies you so brother bam continues on what a solemn portion of of word there now that doesn't stay solemn that doesn't stay interesting if you don't read it and you can just forget about it you say he didn't say it but for those of us who can pick it up and read it it does something to us I say either that means something or it don't mean nothing he's just talking to them back there or maybe brother Bam could have been wrong maybe or does it really mean what he said it meant I think we all have to be honest and start with what did it say and then from there you give me what your version of it is you tell me what it means we have to do that with every scripture everything that God brings to us brother brandom continues on in the paragraph number 93 and he says this here it's been the lamb all the way through it was the lamb in Luther's time it was the lamb in Wesley's time but now is the token time that each house house must be covered by the token each house of God must be covered by the token all that's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is the body of Jesus Christ and by one Spirit we're all baptized into this token and become part of it that God said when I see the token displayed I'll pass over you what an hour that we're now living oh brother he says paragraph 99 the hour of that token to be displayed is at hand we can see it we know that we're near the end now we brought all kind of messages up to show signs and wonders and now here we come back for what the church has got to do the token has got to be displayed when I see the blood I will pass over you nothing else would work it must be the blood now the holy ghost is our token from God Amen he goes a little bit further and he says this paragraph 137 how many love the Lord today amen paragraph 137 he says this here when I see the token I'll pass over you it's God's requirement of the hour the evening time message is to apply the token Satan has throw all kinds of counterfeits of shaking hands evidence everything like that forget it the hour has arrived that the token itself not some counterfeit make belie substitutionary anything the hour is here when the token himself is identifying himself right Among Us and proving that what he is the same Jesus yesterday today and forever he's right with the word amen amen I like what he says in paragraph 147 says now the spirit is the token you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when the blood was shed the token was sent down on the day of Pentecost like a Russian Mighty win that was the theme of every Apostle yes that was have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is that still our theme is that still the theme of every Apostle sir absolutely all through your Bible that was the theme have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe now brother brand says a wonderful thing in this message many of them but in paragraph 203 he says this let's move forward just to save a little bit time let's take paragraph 338 okay all right Saints the prophet of God says the token is the sign that the purch has been made and been accepted now you can't get the token from the railroad uh Fair until you pay the price and the only way you're going to pay the price is pay it that's right what believe it accept it now here's right right right here here here it is right here full obedience to part of the word am I reading that right you say brother I believe the word do you believe the whole word like all of it see the whole point in keeping the word from not adding or taken away from it is so that a True Believer can come up to it in its purest form and accept it exactly that way and when you get to that point and you can accept it exactly that way then you're entitled to the Token full obedience to the whole word of God would entitle you to the Token full obedience not the part of it as far as your denomination goes but all of it full obedience to the word which is Christ brings you into Christ it entitles you amen amen it's just like a baby being born it's entitled to live its life that's an entitlement the the title deed to a property you get the title deed that means you own that property a little baby being born here in at least in this country he has he's he's entitled to to to keep his life to stay alive even the parents can't take his life mom and dad say we want to take his life you can't take that child's life it's protected that's part of the entitlement for it being born it's a little human being even mom and dad might change their mind and says no no but you know now that is born even he doesn't know how to feed himself or care for himself if you fail to keep it alive you're responsible these are the the rights to this little baby just being born in this country it's entitled to the right to keep its life even if he because doesn't know his name it can't talk it can't feed it can't walk doesn't know how to protect itself don't know where the environment needs to be in somebody is its caraker and needs to make sure that baby stays alive is that right what about in the Christian church huh who's the caretaker to make sure the babies get born in the church there's an entitlement that the word every generation has its own opportunity to say Amen to God's word and when I take this out and I take that part out and then it it takes it loses Integrity some Churches you know they'll it's cold former dry dead no spirit in it at all and then them little babies raised up in that church nobody sing nobody say praise the Lord oddly nobody's called to the ministry everybody sitting there on Le and then they go to Camp somewhere and Believers in the word they see somebody running and getting filled with the Holy Ghost and they like what kind of where is this from two different worlds because somebody didn't hold the Integrity if if if if you're sitting on a Pew and you're listening to a tape and there's a big difference between the tape Ministry and the church you're worshiping in somebody didn't keep the Integrity of the pull pit the word of God tells our sisters how to dress and then I look to the congregation if you ain't dressing that way somebody didn't keep the Integrity of what the word said it's easier not to say nothing it's easier on my personal feelings it's easier us on us humanly but standing before God if he says don't add or diminish art amen praise the lord it's a matter of our integrity to the text amen so we see it in the word and the word becomes our example and our absolute then when we have kept the whole word of God it entitles us to the token and what is the token it's the Life of Christ we present it in our prayers we claim our family with it it will take us in the Rapture the same power amen but you have to believe it all and even the part you don't understand you have to believe it and accept it all you know this message the token brother random talking about it the next service which he preached desperation so he preached this on the Sunday morning I'm closing now music musicians can come please he preached this on the Sunday morning the token and then Sunday night he preached the message desperations and he says this now you people in the tapes in there paragraph n this morning the message this morning was to me the Highlight message of my entire Ministry this morning see a highlight message of my entire Ministry someday I'll tell you how it come about and I know that everything has worked for mon months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place that was the capping off time of it see now I'm sure or hope that you got what the token meant the token is a sign that the blood has been applied the price that's been asked required of God Jesus Paid the price by shedding his own blood he did that he the he did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit when the blood is applied to you the holy spirit is a token that your price is paid God has received you and that's the token remember that is the token now there's many people they don't know what the token is see and you have to make it like nobody knows it see so that all of them will get it now if you get that message the token right at the end there brother bam says many of you actually most of you have already received it he says that and you listen to that message the token is like man do I got anything am I even saved today but he has to preach it that way and the word of the Lord comes that way because you want to be very very sure on these things of eternal life you don't want I mean there's no wasted time at the altar and there's no wasted Prayer by saying Lord is it I am I the hypocrite am I wrong in my spirit what's wrong with that I I think that that's the attitude of many True Believers is they're always on the edge that they're not measuring up and they're constantly looking for God to show show them more grace and more of their word but we know that is it is by his grace that we can be or do anything that we're doing the very thought that I my heart wants to be like him that is the grace of God the very conviction that maybe I'm not measuring up that is a blessing because a lot of people just don't care they really don't and if you have that conviction that little Edge on you that you know maybe I'm not maybe I'm not just right maybe I'm not maybe I you know that that's a good thing because you just want to be for sure and there's nothing wrong with being sure but it's by his grace that we are saved it's his grace that put these Desires in our heart is by his grace you read the book of Galatians it take you about 30 minutes or so chapter 1 through six you could take your time and read it all those verses how Paul is taking you from The Works of the law to the grace of God what you going to circumcise yourself and now you think you're going to find you know you can't find peace with God but by the works of the law that's why his grace came to you it's by his grace that we are saved and it's the grace of God that will lead you to repentance it's the grace of God that'll put you on your knees and say Lord let this Vision open up to me even greater this third pool the ministry of the last day this great token Ministry this message Let It Come to Me Lord let it let me just empty out my he brother bam said it in the Sunday school this morning how many heard that that drive that you want to you know you should just Lord more of you amen there's nothing wrong with that from the preachers all the way to the newcomers the altar is open for for every believer prophets included and there's many people in their pride and arrogancy as a Christian they can't even make a move to an altar because their pride won't let them because you know I'm the Big B I'm the pastor I can't be at the altar that's the one that should be at the altar is your pastor and you right next to him and the altar is in your heart that's right in your pew Lord is it I Lord am I keeping the Integrity of your word or am I making it fit the way I want it to fit some of you sisters and some of you Brothers alike making the word fit for 2024 because you know just more comfortable that's too harsh this is a different way you know just keep the Integrity of the text what did he say what did the Bible say what did the word say and then say Lord help me amen and it's not looking around to others and how they apply it and how they handle the word it's none of that it's like M the prophet he said Micah 450 of them prophesied say what they said and you'll be in good graces of the king he says I will only say he's out there all by himself no Fellowship no friends nobody's even included him in all the the parties and the Banquets and the prayer breakfasts and whatever else is going on in the great denomination's by himself but somebody was with him and when it came to get a true honest report who did they go get somebody that's not going to manipulate the word or the quotes somebody that only say what God put in his mouth let that be me let that be you amen I will only say what God put in my mouth he said well will leave amen there's your funding we won't support you we won't like you no more like you wasn't supporting me anyways God is the one that's supporting his church amen amen God richly bless us all that I'll keep the Integrity I'll understand it's a oneman message and then I can have rights to the Token God bless you let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning morning thank you for each and every heart that's gathered here today Lord settle it in our hearts and in our minds the things that you have brought to us at this day as we see the end time approaching we see the day and time that we
