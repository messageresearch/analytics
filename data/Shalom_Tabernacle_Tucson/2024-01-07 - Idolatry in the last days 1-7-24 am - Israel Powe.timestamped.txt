[0:03] name
[0:04] amen Revelation 6 verse1 and 2 and I saw
[0:08] when the lamb open one of the seals and
[0:11] I heard as it were the noise of Thunder
[0:15] one of the force beasts saying come and
[0:17] see and I saw and behold a white horse
[0:20] and he that sat upon him had a bow and a
[0:24] crown and a crown was given unto him and
[0:27] he went forth conquering and to conquer
[0:30] amen so as we prepare to go there let's
[0:33] sing only
[0:37] believe
[0:39] only
[0:42] believe
[0:44] only
[0:47] believe all things are
[0:52] possible
[0:54] only
[0:55] [Music]
[0:57] believe only
[1:02] believe
[1:04] only
[1:07] believe all things are
[1:12] possible oh let's lift our hand and say
[1:15] Lord I
[1:17] believe
[1:19] Lord I
[1:22] believe
[1:24] Lord I
[1:27] believe all things things are
[1:32] possible Lord I
[1:37] believe
[1:39] Lord I
[1:42] believe
[1:44] Lord I
[1:47] believe all things are
[1:53] possible Lord I believe God bless you
[1:58] may be seated brother brandom
[2:02] and and the Jews will make a covenant
[2:05] with one another the Bible said they
[2:08] would with the holy people and I notice
[2:11] they'll make it because why this nation
[2:14] is going to be busted and the rest of
[2:16] the world it's on the gold standard is
[2:17] busted you know that if we're living off
[2:21] of taxes do bills for 40 years from now
[2:25] where are we at there's only one thing
[2:27] can happen that's to call in the
[2:29] currency and pay off the bonds and we
[2:31] can't do it Wall Street owns them and
[2:34] wall Street's controlled by the
[2:36] Jews the rest of it's in the Vatican and
[2:39] the Jews has got the rest of it in Wall
[2:41] Street with the Commerce of the
[2:43] world we can't call it in and if they
[2:47] could do it you think these whiskey guys
[2:49] and and all these tobacco people which
[2:51] billions times billions of dollars a
[2:54] year and write off all their income tax
[2:57] for old vulgar pictures and things like
[3:00] that go out in Arizona there and buy
[3:02] millions of acres of land of thousands
[3:05] and dig down big Wells at $50,000 and
[3:07] pay it off with income tax and they put
[3:10] you in jail if you don't pay
[3:12] yours but they ride it off and throw up
[3:15] wells and send Bull noers in and what do
[3:18] they do they put housing projects in
[3:21] there and the next term around with
[3:23] their money they made they got to make
[3:24] an investment and put houses projects in
[3:27] there and sell them for millions of
[3:28] dollars you think them guys is going to
[3:31] compromise to change the
[3:35] currency like this fellow down here and
[3:39] um what's his name Castro did he done
[3:43] the only smart thing he ever did do then
[3:46] when he destroyed the bomb PID them off
[3:48] and Destroy notice but we can't do that
[3:52] these guys won't that the rich meres of
[3:54] the earth hold it amen and there's only
[3:56] one thing to
[3:58] do but the Catholic church can pay it
[4:00] off she's the only one's got the money
[4:04] and she can do it and she will do it and
[4:07] in doing this to get it she'll
[4:09] compromise with the Jews and make a
[4:10] covenant that's right and when she makes
[4:13] this Covenant with the Jews now remember
[4:15] I'm taking this from the scripture am
[4:18] all now when she does this and makes
[4:20] this Covenant we notice in Daniel 8:23
[4:25] and
[4:26] 25 he will cause craft to prosper and
[4:31] crab is
[4:33] manufactur in his hand and he makes his
[4:37] Covenant with the Jews in the midst of
[4:39] this three and a half years he breaks
[4:41] his Covenant as soon as he gets the
[4:43] thing wrapped up and gets the money of
[4:45] the Jews tied
[4:46] up and when he does that oh my oh my
[4:52] he's called the
[4:54] Antichrist until the end of the church
[4:58] age for he he is the he and his children
[5:02] are
[5:03] against Christ and the
[5:07] word this man's called the Antichrist
[5:10] now he's going to hold of
[5:11] money and that's where I think he'll
[5:13] come in just a minute I say this and we
[5:15] go back to it a minute he's called the
[5:19] Antichrist and will be called the
[5:21] Antichrist in the sight of God until the
[5:24] end
[5:25] time now but then you'll be called
[5:29] something
[5:30] else now when he gets the money all
[5:34] under control then he'll break this
[5:37] Covenant with the Jews as Daniel here
[5:38] said he would do it in the midst of the
[5:41] last half of the 70 weeks of Daniel and
[5:45] then brother what will he do he'll have
[5:49] all of the world trade in the Commerce
[5:53] packed with the world because he'll hold
[5:56] the wealth of the world completely and
[6:00] during that time them two prophets arise
[6:03] on the scene and call that
[6:06] 144,000 then what will take place then
[6:10] the mark of the beast of Revelations 13
[6:12] will set in because he holds all the
[6:14] Commerce trade and everything in the
[6:16] world and what will take place then the
[6:19] mark of the beast will come in that no
[6:21] man can buy or sell except him that has
[6:23] the mark of the beast thank God the
[6:25] church will be enjoying a great three
[6:27] and a half
[6:28] years you don't have to go through that
[6:31] I not it at the end time at the end of
[6:35] the church ages
[6:37] now he is called he and his children are
[6:40] called the Antichrist calls anything
[6:43] that's against Christ is Antichrist and
[6:47] anything that's against the word is
[6:49] against Christ because Christ is the
[6:52] word he Antichrist then in Revelations
[6:56] 1279 when Satan is cast out the accuser
[7:01] you'll put that down because want you
[7:02] read we haven't got time now it's course
[7:05] 15 but in the revelations 12 7
[7:10] and9
[7:12] Satan the spirit the devil which is up
[7:17] there now accuser of our Brethren all
[7:22] right the church is taken
[7:25] up and Satan is cast out when the church
[7:30] goes up Satan comes
[7:33] down then Satan incarnates himself in
[7:38] the Antichrist and is called the
[7:42] beast then Revelations 13 He sets the
[7:45] mark down amen see when he that lth only
[7:51] now Christianity is left on the earth
[7:52] and is Purity is because him that led it
[7:55] remember back here in Thessalonians
[7:58] setting up the temple of God God call
[7:59] himself God forgiving sins on Earth and
[8:02] that'll go on and iniquity shall abound
[8:04] and all CA won't be known yet until it's
[8:06] time to be revealed his called and then
[8:09] the church will be caught away and when
[8:11] it's caught away then he changes himself
[8:13] from an antichrist now oh my the church
[8:16] the great church now he becomes the
[8:22] Beast I wish I could make people see
[8:25] that I remember the Antichrist and the
[8:29] is the same self
[8:32] Spirit there's a
[8:34] trinity yes sir it's three stages of the
[8:38] same devil power remember
[8:43] Nicolia see it had to be incarnate
[8:47] before it could be
[8:48] crowned see now watch this three stages
[8:52] first stage is called Antichrist second
[8:55] stage is called the false prophet third
[8:58] stage
[8:59] he's called the
[9:01] beast notice nickia the Antichrist
[9:05] teaching has started in the days of Paul
[9:08] against God's
[9:10] word
[9:12] Antichrist then he's called again the
[9:15] false prophet which when the teaching
[9:19] become a
[9:20] man he was a prophet to the teaching of
[9:24] the hierarchy of the the hierarchy of
[9:27] the Catholic Church the Pope was the
[9:30] prophet to the false word and that made
[9:32] him a false
[9:33] prophet the third stage is the Beast a
[9:38] man that's crowned in the last days with
[9:42] every Power that Pagan Rome ever had
[9:44] because the seven headed beast dragon
[9:47] was cast out of heaven and come
[9:49] incarnate in the false
[9:53] prophet there it is he had seven crowns
[9:56] and he was cast out and thrown into the
[9:58] Earth and received all
[10:01] right what are we saying who is this
[10:04] Rider this horse rider you know what it
[10:06] is it's Satan's
[10:10] Superman I went the other night two
[10:12] brothers sitting in this church now
[10:14] brother Norman back there and I believe
[10:16] brother Fred was over to hear a man
[10:19] teach on the
[10:20] Antichrist a wellknown man one of the
[10:24] best Assemblies of God is God and His
[10:26] interpretation of antichrist was that
[10:28] they're going take a bidam of some sort
[10:31] out of a of a man and transfer this life
[10:35] out of a man into a great image it's
[10:37] going to stick step a city block at a
[10:40] time and that's could you imagine a man
[10:44] filled with the Holy Ghost under such
[10:46] illusion as that claim to
[10:48] be when here is the Bible says who the
[10:51] Antichrist is it's not a it's a
[10:57] man notice
[11:00] this writer is nothing but Satan's
[11:03] Superman an incarnate
[11:06] Devil he's an educated
[11:10] genius I hope you got your ears
[11:13] open is trying one of his children out
[11:15] not long go on a television cast to see
[11:17] if it wasn't smarter than next man to
[11:19] run for presidency but however he's got
[11:22] a lot of wisdom so Satan he tries to
[11:25] sell it he sold it to Eve he sold it to
[11:27] us we've been wanting a Superman we got
[11:32] it all right the whole world's Wan a
[11:34] Superman they're going to get it just
[11:36] wait till the church goes up and Satan's
[11:38] cast out he'll incarnate that's right
[11:41] they want somebody who can really do the
[11:42] job he'll do it educated this is a Satan
[11:47] Superman with education with wisdom with
[11:51] church Theology of his own word of his
[11:54] own making and he rides his white
[11:56] denominational horse to deceive the
[11:58] people yeah and he will conquer every
[12:02] religion of the world because they've
[12:04] all gone into the confederation of of
[12:07] the of churches and the world
[12:10] Confederation of churches and they
[12:12] already got their buildings building
[12:13] everything setting right in line there
[12:15] ain't one thing left every denomination
[12:18] stuck right into it a Federation of
[12:20] churches and what's back in it Rome and
[12:23] the popes now crying we're all one let's
[12:25] come together and walk together and
[12:27] these people even some of you Full
[12:29] Gospel people deny have to deny your
[12:33] Evangelical teaching to take such a step
[12:35] as
[12:36] that what have you done so blind to that
[12:39] denominational thing you've rejected
[12:42] truth and truth is set before him and
[12:43] they they walked away from it and left
[12:46] it and now they've been given over to a
[12:50] strong delusion to believe a lie and be
[12:52] damned with it it's exactly what it is
[12:55] and the Antichrist takes it all and the
[12:58] Bible said that he deceived all a amen
[13:04] all upon the face of the Earth whose
[13:06] names were not written under those
[13:08] Shields from the
[13:10] [Applause]
[13:15] found now if the Bible said he did it he
[13:17] did
[13:19] it they say well I BL there you
[13:23] are that's just exactly it's the same
[13:26] prostitutes uh Institution it's the same
[13:30] system that started in the beginning
[13:31] which is Antichrist
[13:34] throughout I'll hear from it but that's
[13:37] it's a truth I
[13:39] expect now notice he'll conquer and
[13:43] almost has in his grip right now while
[13:46] he's still Antichrist before he becomes
[13:48] Beast you talk about cruel punishment

[13:57] through there will be weeping and
[14:00] wailing and nashing of teeth for the
[14:03] dragon

[14:09] make war with the remant of the woman's
[14:12] seed that was left upon the Earth after
[14:15] the bride had been selected and took
[14:18] out and the dragon made war with the rib
[14:21] that didn't want to come in but hunted
[14:23] down and the real Church would go
[14:25] through that if it was possible but you

[17:45] together see while this great thing is
[17:49] going out there this great system
[17:51] winding in these organizations in a
[17:53] union so they can pull themselves
[17:55] together and stand against communism and
[17:57] not knowing of God raised up communism
[17:59] to
[18:00] conquer sure what what what made
[18:04] communism rise in Russia because of the
[18:07] impurity of the Roman Church and the
[18:10] rest of iten they took all the money
[18:12] there was in Russia and starve the
[18:13] people to death and give them nothing
[18:16] instead and live just like the rest of
[18:17] the
[18:18] world I was down in Mexico not long ago

[18:31] even support its own
[18:34] South France Italy and all them Mexico
[18:38] wherever you go they're not
[18:39] self-supporting why the church took
[18:42] everything to have that's the reason

[18:45] out what's what taken
[18:48] place I know this myself I stand down
[18:51] there and you think that golden jubilee
[18:53] was on you hear the bells ringing and

[20:10] some grease candle to burn on a million
[20:12] dollar gold order for his sin

[1:13:46] very familiar scripture in 2 Timothy
[1:13:49] chapter
[1:13:50] 3
[1:13:52] and I believe I have
[1:13:56] another scripture in
[1:13:58] Exodus
[1:14:06] 7 second Timothy chapter
[1:14:12] 3 verse number one this know also that
[1:14:17] in the last days perilous time shall
[1:14:20] come for men shall be lovers of their
[1:14:23] own selves Covetous boasters proud
[1:14:27] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[1:14:30] unthankful Unholy without natural
[1:14:34] affection Tru Breakers false accusers
[1:14:38] incontinent Fierce despisers of those
[1:14:41] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[1:14:46] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[1:14:49] God having a form of godliness but
[1:14:52] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:14:56] away for this is the sort are they which
[1:14:59] creep into houses and Lead captive silly
[1:15:02] women Laden with sins LED away with
[1:15:07] diverse lusts ever learning never able
[1:15:10] to come to the knowledge of the truth
[1:15:13] now as Janice and jambus withstood Moses
[1:15:17] so do these resist the truth men of
[1:15:21] corrupt Minds Repro great concerning the
[1:15:25] faith but they shall proceed no further
[1:15:29] for their Folly shall be made manifest
[1:15:31] unto all men as theirs also was but thou
[1:15:37] H has fully known my Doctrine manner of
[1:15:41] life purpose Faith longsuffering charity
[1:15:47] patience persecutions a afflictions
[1:15:50] which came unto me at Antioch and Ikon
[1:15:53] and lisra what persecutions I endured
[1:15:56] but out of them all the
[1:16:00] Lord delivered me amen I can stand with
[1:16:04] Paul on that one he's delivered me out
[1:16:07] of some mighty tight
[1:16:09] places oh my he's delivered me out of
[1:16:13] all of them amen and take one more
[1:16:16] scripture in Exodus chapter
[1:16:21] 7 verse number
[1:16:26] 10 and Moses and Aaron went unto pharaoh
[1:16:31] and they did so as the Lord had
[1:16:33] commanded right and Aaron cast down his
[1:16:36] Rod before pharaoh and before his
[1:16:39] servants and it became a
[1:16:42] serpent then Pharaoh also called the
[1:16:45] wise men and the
[1:16:47] sorcerers Now The Magicians of Egypt
[1:16:50] they also did in like manner with their
[1:16:54] enchantments for they cast down every
[1:16:56] man his rod and they became serpents but
[1:17:00] Aaron's Rod swallowed up their rods and
[1:17:03] he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he
[1:17:06] hearkened not unto them as the Lord had
[1:17:09] say Amen take a little title this
[1:17:12] morning idolatry in the last days
[1:17:16] idolatry in the last days and um just
[1:17:20] dealing with this last day uh issue that
[1:17:24] we are all dealing with these perilous
[1:17:28] times so let us pray Lord we ask your
[1:17:31] blessing on your word you bless your
[1:17:33] people we pray in Jesus name amen God
[1:17:36] bless you you may be seated now in
[1:17:39] speaking on the last days the first
[1:17:42] prophet to actually see the Gentile
[1:17:46] kingdoms from the beginning to the end
[1:17:48] was the Prophet Daniel and brother
[1:17:51] random brings it out and
[1:17:53] and um I think we'll read a little bit
[1:17:56] there in Daniel chapter 2 if you'll just
[1:18:00] turn there
[1:18:01] quickly but this
[1:18:05] um here at the church we were sharing
[1:18:08] with the church here this dream that
[1:18:10] brother Billy Paul had of the
[1:18:14] uh where his dad came into the church
[1:18:19] and he had fire in his eyes and we read
[1:18:22] that to you when we played it for you
[1:18:24] how many remember that what message was
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:27] in can you
[1:18:29] remember can somebody help
[1:18:33] meas no not Blasphemous names what what
[1:18:37] what message was
[1:18:38] it there's a man that turn on oh you
[1:18:42] guys know it now there's a man that can
[1:18:45] turn on the light and it it was a dream
[1:18:48] that shook brother Billy Paul up and
[1:18:51] brother brandom says that's exactly
[1:18:54] scriptural because in this dream brother
[1:18:57] uh brandom says before between now and
[1:19:00] daylight the Lord will come and he saw
[1:19:03] this great Stone cut
[1:19:05] out without hands and it smote a great
[1:19:08] image well let's take Daniel chapter 2
[1:19:11] just for a moment and just to get a
[1:19:14] little bit of what this King saw and so
[1:19:18] verse remember I can't take it all this
[1:19:21] morning but I'll take some of it
[1:19:24] in verse 31 thou oh King sawest and
[1:19:29] behold a great image this great image
[1:19:33] whose brightness was excellent stood
[1:19:36] before thee and the form thereof was
[1:19:38] terrible this image head was of fine
[1:19:42] gold his breast and his arms of silver
[1:19:46] his belly and his thighs of brass his
[1:19:49] legs of iron his feet part iron and part
[1:19:53] clay thou sawest till that a stone was
[1:19:56] cut out without hands which smote the
[1:19:59] image upon his feet that were all that
[1:20:02] were of iron and clay and break them to
[1:20:05] Pieces then was the iron the clay the
[1:20:08] brass the silver and the gold broke into
[1:20:11] pieces together and became like the
[1:20:13] chaff of The Summer's threshing floor
[1:20:16] and the wind carried them away that no
[1:20:19] place was found for them and the stone
[1:20:22] that SM the image became a great
[1:20:26] mountain and filled the whole earth now
[1:20:30] brother bam tells us that that stone was
[1:20:33] Christ and he smites this image and this
[1:20:36] image the head of gold the breast of
[1:20:40] silver the thighs of brass and then the
[1:20:44] legs of iron and the feet iron and Clay
[1:20:49] mixture the prophet tells us and many
[1:20:51] historians and many many many Protestant
[1:20:54] Bible readers know that these were the
[1:20:57] Gentile kingdoms this is what Daniel saw
[1:21:00] he saw uh an interpretation actually of
[1:21:03] what King Nebuchadnezzar saw this King
[1:21:06] ungodly King you could call him whatever
[1:21:09] but he saw he sees this dream he needs
[1:21:11] an
[1:21:12] interpretation Daniel brings the
[1:21:14] interpretation of what this is and
[1:21:17] Daniel actually
[1:21:18] sees uh uh this great Kingdom of the
[1:21:23] Gentiles which this is our time he sees
[1:21:26] the beginning and the ending of the
[1:21:29] Gentile
[1:21:30] dispensation now we know brothers and
[1:21:33] sisters what time it is don't we we know
[1:21:37] that we're not looking for a great
[1:21:39] Revival to come and get a bride ready
[1:21:42] for to hear the message of Malachi 4
[1:21:46] we're not waiting for Elijah to come we
[1:21:49] already know that he has come like the
[1:21:52] disciples they didn't even know that
[1:21:53] John had already come and Jesus said
[1:21:55] he's already come and they did what was
[1:21:58] said they would do to him so they missed
[1:22:00] the timing a little bit that's not us
[1:22:02] today we know what time it is we know
[1:22:06] that Israel is a very important piece in
[1:22:08] God's time that God tells time with them
[1:22:12] we know that there is coming a
[1:22:16] persecution last Wednesday night we
[1:22:18] played in the message here the uh uh uh
[1:22:22] um Church order in
[1:22:25] 63 and in there he put in there he said
[1:22:28] it right in there he says now remember
[1:22:30] they're going to close the doors of this
[1:22:32] church one
[1:22:33] day I don't know what that's going to
[1:22:35] look like all I know is that the church
[1:22:39] doors have been open all I know is that
[1:22:42] when I want to go to church I can go
[1:22:44] freely we don't know what it looks like
[1:22:47] I can tell you this it's not going to be
[1:22:50] easy time no sir and I don't think a
[1:22:52] halfway prayer life is going to get you
[1:22:54] ready for that time and I don't think we
[1:22:57] should wait I wouldn't gamble with my
[1:23:00] soul to wait to see things happen to
[1:23:03] wait somebody you know who we think is
[1:23:05] going to be president and who is this
[1:23:07] and who wait for this to happen and then
[1:23:10] start trying to get ready I I don't
[1:23:12] think that's why the prophet came I
[1:23:15] think the prophet came so that you can
[1:23:17] hear what he had to say so that you can
[1:23:20] get yourself ready now let let me say
[1:23:23] this in every Church in whatever Church
[1:23:26] you're born in or you ever come in to
[1:23:28] the message that church has a culture
[1:23:32] and that church has a way that they do
[1:23:34] things they have their emphasis and the
[1:23:36] things that they don't emphasize they
[1:23:39] might be loud and Rowdy or they might be
[1:23:41] quiet and
[1:23:42] still that's it with all of us we all
[1:23:46] come in under some kind of way or the
[1:23:48] other and you know what I think there's
[1:23:50] a little Grace for us if if we were born
[1:23:53] in the church that didn't emphasize
[1:23:55] certain things that are hidden in the
[1:23:57] word and I think that God will wink upon
[1:24:00] you if you are in an assembly or are
[1:24:04] accustomed to an assembly that didn't
[1:24:07] really cherish the message like they
[1:24:09] should but it's so beautiful that he's
[1:24:12] made it
[1:24:14] available where you and I can hear the
[1:24:17] message for
[1:24:18] ourselves and then when you hear it for
[1:24:20] yourself then there's no excuses it's
[1:24:24] not the pastor's fault it's not the
[1:24:26] piano player's fault it's not the
[1:24:28] organist's fault it's not the false
[1:24:30] teacher fault God sent you
[1:24:35] Elijah and when you take it personal it
[1:24:39] will bless you
[1:24:41] personal amen amen so so he gives Every
[1:24:47] Man a chance to say Amen to the
[1:24:50] word amen
[1:24:53] I don't have to pick up somebody else's
[1:24:56] message book that's already been
[1:24:58] underlined for me and here I already
[1:25:02] highlighted for you say Amen where I
[1:25:05] said no no no no he gives me a chance to
[1:25:10] hear it for myself I thank God for it
[1:25:13] Saints I thank God for
[1:25:17] it cuz
[1:25:20] now I don't have to ask
[1:25:23] anybody permission on how to
[1:25:26] worship or permission on when to say
[1:25:30] Amen or permission on which quote is
[1:25:33] valid or not I I'm not asking nobody
[1:25:37] permission God sent me a
[1:25:41] message Glory Hallelujah and it's my
[1:25:46] message and I handled it like it's
[1:25:49] mine very personally amen and you can
[1:25:53] handle it that way
[1:25:55] too praise the
[1:25:58] Lord so God gives each of us an
[1:26:02] opportunity to say Amen to the word he
[1:26:04] says that in the spoken word is the
[1:26:06] Original Seed each generation gets a
[1:26:09] chance at the word he says that so we
[1:26:13] see in this last
[1:26:15] day that there would
[1:26:17] be
[1:26:19] this um the the these kingdoms that be
[1:26:22] beginning and the ending of them and
[1:26:25] what brother brandom said about them and
[1:26:26] the things that would happen and we see
[1:26:28] a lot of things develop
[1:26:30] here around the message so to say and
[1:26:34] the groups and the different influences
[1:26:36] that have pulled in certain
[1:26:39] directions there people are doing things
[1:26:41] that we' have never seen before pastors
[1:26:44] have never seen this before people in
[1:26:46] church have never seen people uh behave
[1:26:49] the way they behaved before I went to
[1:26:51] bury my good friend brother Al Albert
[1:26:53] stole there in Jasper Texas fine Brother
[1:26:57] how many you know him amen he's on the
[1:26:59] harmony of the desert singing I want a
[1:27:02] Godly attitude he wrote that song I want
[1:27:06] to walk like the Lord talk like the Lord
[1:27:08] live like the Lord I want a Godly
[1:27:10] attitude in everything that I do you
[1:27:13] need to go hear that
[1:27:14] one and as I went back there was it was
[1:27:18] sad because we had to uh say goodbye to
[1:27:21] our brother I'm glad because his
[1:27:23] suffering is over here on this Earth but
[1:27:25] there is a condition there where you I
[1:27:28] was sad because there were so many
[1:27:30] Believers there in this little town
[1:27:32] little city of Jasper that are not going
[1:27:35] to church
[1:27:37] anywhere and for what reason and the
[1:27:40] reasons why is probably a long list
[1:27:42] reason as to why used to be a thriving
[1:27:46] church and Ministry there it's not there
[1:27:49] anymore lots of Believers there and none
[1:27:52] of them gathered together to um honor
[1:27:57] the Lord as to coming together to to
[1:28:00] Fellowship in the church as it
[1:28:02] were now that might be agreeable or
[1:28:05] disagreeable it might be you might be
[1:28:07] able to understand it or not but that's
[1:28:09] what it is and so you see these uh
[1:28:13] things and conditions that you know
[1:28:15] that's something I've never seen before
[1:28:18] like that I couldn't understand why a
[1:28:21] condition to be that way but there's
[1:28:23] there's a background to it but in this
[1:28:27] Vision that uh Nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:30] sees and that Daniel interprets brother
[1:28:33] random now shares with us that those
[1:28:37] were the Gentile Kingdoms in the
[1:28:40] future now in Revelations chapter 17
[1:28:44] you'll see John sees this great Beast
[1:28:47] brother ROM talked about it in the a
[1:28:49] first seal this morning Sunday School he
[1:28:52] sees this
[1:28:53] beast and Daniel sees the same beast but
[1:28:57] when Daniel sees it it's four separate
[1:28:59] beasts it's a a bear a leopard a
[1:29:03] terrible strong Beast a lion and the
[1:29:05] teeth the Beast that had teeth and so
[1:29:08] forth they were separated and and and
[1:29:12] but when John sees them they're all put
[1:29:14] together and they're just one Beast
[1:29:16] brother brandom tells us that but here
[1:29:18] in the message one think you're of
[1:29:20] Christ here brother brandom tells us
[1:29:24] 1954 paragraph 29 he says Daniel that
[1:29:28] great prophet who saw the
[1:29:30] beginning of or the same time he saw it
[1:29:34] down through to the end through an image
[1:29:37] surely he saw Jesus in there somewhere
[1:29:40] if he saw the beginning with the head of
[1:29:42] gold King Nebuchadnezzar and the Gentile
[1:29:46] Kingdom he saw the mees and Persians and
[1:29:49] the brass and so forth out into the
[1:29:51] Roman ROM Empire unto his coming what
[1:29:55] think ye of Christ and brother mam
[1:29:57] continues in the message seven Church
[1:29:59] ages and he says this
[1:30:04] 1954 in
[1:30:07] paragraph 50 he says we'll get it in a
[1:30:10] few moments showing how the Old
[1:30:12] Testament typed up in the seven Church
[1:30:14] ages seven ages set or seven churches
[1:30:18] set here in Asia which the Bible plainly
[1:30:21] teaches which was a shadow or type of
[1:30:24] the seven Church ages that was coming
[1:30:26] and by God's help with the Bible can
[1:30:28] prove that every Church age landed just
[1:30:31] exactly where it said it would just
[1:30:34] exactly where the Bible said it would
[1:30:37] and we're at the end of the last Church
[1:30:40] age I can go back in the Old Testament
[1:30:44] pick up Daniel's dream and show you the
[1:30:46] vision of the Gentile Kingdom how that
[1:30:49] he saw an image standing with the head
[1:30:51] head of gold breast of silver thighs of
[1:30:55] brass feet and legs of iron and clay and
[1:30:59] show how every one of those kingdoms
[1:31:02] have succeeded one another just exactly
[1:31:05] the way the Bible said and look the head
[1:31:08] of gold Babylon me in Persia Greek the
[1:31:13] Roman Empire and the Roman Empire broke
[1:31:16] up into 10 kingdoms eastern and western
[1:31:19] Rome and so forth and in there there was
[1:31:22] iron and clay and they wouldn't mix
[1:31:25] together Protestant and
[1:31:28] Catholicism under the same Gentile
[1:31:32] domination and he said that even they
[1:31:34] would even try to break one another's
[1:31:36] power they would intermar with one
[1:31:38] another just exactly what they're
[1:31:41] doing
[1:31:43] today and that the kingdom in the days
[1:31:46] of those kings the god of Heaven cut a
[1:31:48] stone out of the mountain without
[1:31:50] hands that's Stone this image in the
[1:31:53] feet and broke all the Gentile kingdoms
[1:31:56] down and the kingdom of Christ ruled and
[1:31:59] rained and growed and covered the earth
[1:32:03] and the Sea and the sky the Gentile
[1:32:06] kingdoms faded away like trash like the
[1:32:10] husk of a thrashing floor in the
[1:32:12] summertime what a picture that we're
[1:32:15] living in that's true and today you see
[1:32:18] Catholic and Protestant marrying among
[1:32:21] one another trying to break the power
[1:32:24] down raise your children have to promise
[1:32:26] him to raise them this way or that way
[1:32:28] we'll get into that after a bit so here
[1:32:30] brother bam is now showing us what that
[1:32:34] mountain was in Daniel chapter 2 can you
[1:32:37] say Amen it was Christ right just read
[1:32:41] it for you Rose up it smoted this image
[1:32:44] and the image are the Gentile kingdoms
[1:32:47] now many of the secular teachers and
[1:32:50] preachers and many many Bible historians
[1:32:53] and people that uh that are maybe not in
[1:32:56] the message they know and they use this
[1:33:00] prophecy of Daniel as proof of the
[1:33:03] Bible's validity because when Daniel
[1:33:06] gives this prophecy and Nebuchadnezzar
[1:33:09] sees this dream written and showing the
[1:33:12] kingdoms that would come into power the
[1:33:14] history proves it out
[1:33:16] exactly it happened just that way those
[1:33:20] those four kingdoms
[1:33:22] it's beautiful so the Propet is now
[1:33:24] showing us who that Christ was what that
[1:33:27] stone was and how it smote that image
[1:33:32] shows us the beginning and the ending of
[1:33:35] an age now we know that we're in the
[1:33:38] last day we're in the end time with the
[1:33:40] very closing time of this world's
[1:33:44] history we know that the gospel next
[1:33:47] goes to the
[1:33:49] Jews They will receive it
[1:33:52] they will accept it and God will do
[1:33:55] Mighty Works amongst them but just
[1:33:57] before that happens there's a little
[1:34:00] there's a catching away that comes
[1:34:03] there's a revelation that strikes the
[1:34:07] gentile people that he calls out a
[1:34:09] gentile Bride for now when you can
[1:34:12] identify what time of the day it is or
[1:34:16] what day of the week it is and then you
[1:34:18] can see where you are in the scriptures
[1:34:21] it does something to your heart it makes
[1:34:24] it the main thing it highlights it's
[1:34:27] above everything every other plan you
[1:34:30] know we all have plans as human beings
[1:34:32] and aspirations and dreams some of them
[1:34:36] we'll realize and some of them we won't
[1:34:39] but there's one thing I don't want to
[1:34:40] miss and there's one thing I don't want
[1:34:42] to be ready for that I want to be ready
[1:34:44] for and that's this great catching away
[1:34:49] and that's this great revelation of the
[1:34:51] last day Church the last day bride just
[1:34:55] before he goes back to the
[1:34:58] Jews amen amen so these are wonderful
[1:35:02] things for us to preach on to teach on
[1:35:05] shows us that we're not going to be
[1:35:07] here much too
[1:35:10] longer look at your neighbor and say
[1:35:13] neighbor we're getting out of here look
[1:35:16] at them good all of y'all didn't say it
[1:35:18] now we're getting out of here
[1:35:22] it won't be very
[1:35:24] long you know if that make you mad stay
[1:35:27] mad all but for for me I'm I'm ready to
[1:35:32] go I mean I don't want to stay here an
[1:35:34] extra week to get caught up on what to
[1:35:37] see what happened no I'm ready to go as
[1:35:40] the Lord would call us and this is part
[1:35:42] of why we have gathered here this
[1:35:46] morning I sure hope so I sure hope we
[1:35:49] didn't just gather so we can see who
[1:35:51] came who didn't I sure hope that we're
[1:35:54] Gathering to be ready for the coming of
[1:35:56] the Lord and a great catch in way here
[1:35:59] brother brandom says this here in this
[1:36:04] message the mark of the beast I'll take
[1:36:06] several out of this one 1954 paragraph
[1:36:10] 153 the prophet of God says this here
[1:36:12] now we're going to come down notice a
[1:36:15] little further let me get this to you
[1:36:18] maybe I can have time got 30 minutes
[1:36:20] watch close let's go back every reader
[1:36:24] just in your mind for a minute for a
[1:36:25] mental picture every Orthodox believer
[1:36:28] here knows that the Gentile Reign began
[1:36:32] with King Nebuchadnezzar is that right
[1:36:35] every Orthodox believer knows that and
[1:36:38] King Nebuchadnezzar had a vision and
[1:36:41] Daniel gave the interpretation is that
[1:36:43] right amen it was a head of gold which
[1:36:45] is which was the Babylonian the second
[1:36:48] was the me and Persians the next was the
[1:36:50] Grecian Empire then the Roman Empire and
[1:36:55] at the end of the Roman Empire Jesus
[1:36:58] Christ was the rock that was hewed out
[1:37:01] of the mountain without hands that
[1:37:04] rolled in and broke down the images is
[1:37:07] that right covered the Earth anyone
[1:37:10] knows that any believer knows that and
[1:37:13] how that in the last days when they
[1:37:16] broke up in these many different
[1:37:17] kingdoms and so forth to the toes there
[1:37:20] was iron and clay and it means the
[1:37:23] prophet said as much as thou did see
[1:37:25] Iron and Clay won't mix together neither
[1:37:27] will these cleave one to another but
[1:37:30] they'll mingle them seeds in other words
[1:37:33] they'll marry into them trying to raise
[1:37:35] their children and break uh for the
[1:37:38] powers like that you know that's truth
[1:37:41] paragraph 163 notice when King
[1:37:43] Nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back
[1:37:45] Yonder when the Gentile age was issued
[1:37:47] in let's watch how it come
[1:37:50] in
[1:37:51] and the way it come in you'll find out
[1:37:55] it goes out the same
[1:37:58] way we know that there is a beginning of
[1:38:01] time of Grace for the Gentiles and an
[1:38:05] ending of time is that right now watch
[1:38:09] King Nebuchadnezzar Daniel sent down
[1:38:11] there a smart Prophet with all the rest
[1:38:14] of the Jews had kind of humbled down and
[1:38:16] was bowing to the Romans to the
[1:38:18] Babylonians but there was three four men
[1:38:21] three Shadrach mesach abedo and Daniel
[1:38:25] who purpos in their heart they serve God
[1:38:28] and then when they throwed Shadrach and
[1:38:30] Daniel and and Daniel had become a great
[1:38:33] man before King Nebuchadnezzar and belar
[1:38:36] and so forth when he become a great man
[1:38:38] now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made an
[1:38:41] image of gold and set it up in the field
[1:38:45] and said that everybody would have to
[1:38:46] bow to that image did you ever notice
[1:38:50] the innocent sense of it who that image
[1:38:53] was made
[1:38:54] of it was
[1:38:57] Daniel the image of a man and didn't he
[1:39:00] say the spirits of the Gods
[1:39:03] Heathen as they are today got three or
[1:39:05] four of them spirits of the Gods lived
[1:39:08] in him and they made an image to Daniel
[1:39:11] and he said and all that won't make all
[1:39:14] that won't make bow to that image will
[1:39:17] be throwed in the fiery furnace you
[1:39:19] notice Daniel's off the seen at that
[1:39:22] time get what I mean and every who would
[1:39:26] not bow to that image should be cut to
[1:39:29] pieces and throw it into the lion's den
[1:39:32] or burn in the fiery furnace of
[1:39:34] something of punishment that's the way
[1:39:36] the Gentile dispensation begin with the
[1:39:39] Pagan form of religious worship with the
[1:39:42] persecution to make them bow to it and
[1:39:45] the Bible predicts it'll end the same
[1:39:48] way a holy man
[1:39:51] Jesus Christ an image to him to worship
[1:39:55] it and so forth you remember Fox book of
[1:39:58] Martyrs that hold crucifix before them
[1:40:01] and put an ox on each arm like that and
[1:40:04] if you wouldn't renounce renounce
[1:40:06] protestantism and become a Catholic and
[1:40:08] kiss the crucifix they start one Ox one
[1:40:12] way and one the other way and then pull
[1:40:14] them
[1:40:15] apart they burned them to the stakes
[1:40:18] they' done everything I've been to the
[1:40:21] old catacombs I know what I'm speaking
[1:40:23] of and see that that's right and there
[1:40:26] they lay and notice how they went
[1:40:28] through the days of martyrdom before
[1:40:31] Martin Luther I want you to think about
[1:40:34] that these were our brothers and our
[1:40:37] sisters that these things happen
[1:40:39] too and if we were to if we were to
[1:40:42] switch places just for a moment and move
[1:40:45] you back a hundred years or so what kind
[1:40:48] of position would you take I mean I I
[1:40:52] know that we can't do that because we
[1:40:55] have things so easy but I do believe
[1:40:58] there is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:41:01] and it's a true Revelation for the day
[1:41:03] you live in that should keep you on your
[1:41:08] knees and keep the fire burning bright I
[1:41:13] mean I've never seen so many lazy
[1:41:16] Christians I've never seen so many
[1:41:18] people that want credit for coming to
[1:41:21] church it's like I made all three
[1:41:23] services and it's like and
[1:41:26] what um you needed to be at all we need
[1:41:29] to add a
[1:41:31] service and then I see the faces frown
[1:41:33] like I got a schedule I'm busy I'm doing
[1:41:36] this what if we had service every five
[1:41:38] every every five you know five nights of
[1:41:40] the
[1:41:41] week yeah don't get no amens on that cuz
[1:41:44] we busy we got things to do but guess
[1:41:48] where we
[1:41:49] going we're going to heaven we're going
[1:41:53] to a place that will never grow old our
[1:41:56] purpose in being here was to reflect the
[1:41:59] place over there not to rep reflect our
[1:42:02] own uh you know things that we have here
[1:42:04] you got so many weak Christians lazy
[1:42:07] weak can't handle a prayer meeting can't
[1:42:11] handle uh uh a uh you know the service
[1:42:14] is too

[1:42:57] house of the Lord or in the presence of
[1:42:59] the
[1:43:00] Lord and I know with the Leo Dean age
[1:43:03] I'm in the minority what I'm saying
[1:43:05] right now I know that because it's the
[1:43:08] spirit of leod deia but when you listen
[1:43:12] to the dream of what brother Billy Paul
[1:43:14] had and that was just a dream and the
[1:43:18] urgency of that there's going to come a
[1:43:20] time time when the door actually
[1:43:22] closes and I can see the age people out
[1:43:26] there they don't know what time it is
[1:43:27] they're looking for another great
[1:43:29] Revival to happen they don't know what's
[1:43:32] going on we know the door is closing and
[1:43:35] yet we still are like sleeping in Zion
[1:43:39] we can't break through we can't break
[1:43:42] through the the prayer meeting is too
[1:43:44] early or it's too late and you know make

[1:43:52] us I mean I'm sorry I'm sorry and then
[1:43:57] the poor preachers have to
[1:43:59] apologize because they preach a little
[1:44:01] too long about something that's trying
[1:44:03] to help your soul something that's
[1:44:06] trying to break your daughter your son
[1:44:08] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:10] something that's trying to get you ready
[1:44:12] for the Rapture and we got to
[1:44:15] apologize to the American church that
[1:44:19] can't pray for an hour can't pray for
[1:44:22] one hour God have mercy amen you know
[1:44:27] what that's on you that's on me I'm so
[1:44:32] glad you're not my example but God gave
[1:44:35] me an
[1:44:36] example God help me to follow the
[1:44:40] example you left before us
[1:44:43] am
[1:44:45] amen God help us Lord wake me up I read
[1:44:50] a quote there in Phoenix where brother R
[1:44:53] said this is the most glorious age that
[1:44:55] ever hit the earth yes and he called out
[1:44:57] the prophet he said if Daniel Moses and
[1:45:01] Elijah could come here today amen they
[1:45:04] would be running up and down the streets
[1:45:06] proclaiming the gospel and they would
[1:45:09] lock him up and put him in prison amen
[1:45:12] because they would realize the day that
[1:45:14] we're living in
[1:45:18] amen excuse me yes sir amen I want you
[1:45:23] to like me I want you to smile I want
[1:45:25] you to be happy this kind of preaching
[1:45:27] don't garnish that but it's still the
[1:45:30] truth amen Lord if I got to praise you
[1:45:32] by
[1:45:33] myself I'm not coming to church and let
[1:45:35] the song leader Teach Me How To Worship
[1:45:39] I'm not coming to church to see who else
[1:45:41] can praise you I'm coming to Worship You
[1:45:45] Lord king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:45:49] doesn't matter who's here who's
[1:45:51] not I'm here to worship you in spirit
[1:45:53] and in truth Lord help me Hallelujah
[1:45:57] help me
[1:45:59] Lord cuz everybody else leave don't mean
[1:46:01] it's time for me to leave just because
[1:46:04] they close the service don't mean the
[1:46:06] service is
[1:46:07] over God is speaking to your heart amen
[1:46:11] if it's to get right with God then you
[1:46:13] need to get right with God
[1:46:16] Amen thank excuse me Saints all right
[1:46:21] right but we know we're at the end this
[1:46:24] Gentile
[1:46:25] dispensation coming to a
[1:46:27] close the beginning and ending of the
[1:46:29] Gentile Gentile
[1:46:31] dispensation now brother brandom is now
[1:46:35] showing us that that
[1:46:38] image was the image of
[1:46:41] Daniel these prophets these
[1:46:45] Believers were forced to worship the
[1:46:48] image of Daniel I have like seven or
[1:46:51] eight quotations just on that alone well
[1:46:54] brother brandom tells us that what it
[1:46:58] was wasn't some Theory some preacher
[1:47:00] someone else brother brandham tells us
[1:47:03] that those Believers were put to the
[1:47:06] test they were
[1:47:08] squeezed to worship this image and the
[1:47:12] image of was a god a real true prophet
[1:47:16] and that reality
[1:47:18] exists and we know that there there's
[1:47:20] doctrines and there's issues that people
[1:47:23] always want to force you to do something
[1:47:27] and and I I can't even see it you know
[1:47:29] quite clear in the scripture where Jesus
[1:47:31] even does that he where he comes and he
[1:47:35] forces you to bow down and recognize who
[1:47:38] he is but it's rather a revelation of
[1:47:41] who he is and through a revelation We
[1:47:44] Worship the Lord hallelujah so in other
[1:47:46] words me reading a couple of quotes on
[1:47:49] worship and you feeling guilty and then
[1:47:52] you raise your hand that's not what we
[1:47:54] looking for that's not what it's about
[1:47:57] it's not about me guilty you into
[1:47:59] anything I'm going to make you feel
[1:48:00] guilty then you'll come to the altar no
[1:48:02] what you need is God to give you a
[1:48:04] revelation and when he gives you a
[1:48:07] revelation it don't matter who says what
[1:48:11] you'll do what he reveals to you to do
[1:48:14] that's right
[1:48:15] amen yes sir you rais your hand because
[1:48:18] of a revelation you say Amen because it
[1:48:22] comes from the inside you worship God
[1:48:25] because that's what he is to
[1:48:28] you
[1:48:31] amen praise the
[1:48:33] Lord but that image of the the last day
[1:48:39] forcing people forcing people to see
[1:48:42] this forcing people to catch this and if
[1:48:46] you don't see it you ain't bride no more
[1:48:49] you was bride when we agreed but now we
[1:48:53] disagree you ain't bride no
[1:48:55] more Oh They'll mess you up if you
[1:48:57] follow them that's right they have you
[1:48:59] all messed up I'm so glad there ain't no
[1:49:02] man can tell me whether I'm bride or not
[1:49:05] there ain't no man can tell me what I'm
[1:49:07] seeing or not there's only
[1:49:10] one and he's the
[1:49:13] eyeopener he's the light
[1:49:16] Giver he reveals himself and when he
[1:49:20] reveals himself he does a very good job
[1:49:23] yes he does of showing you what he's
[1:49:26] talking about yes he does
[1:49:29] Amen praise His
[1:49:32] name
[1:49:34] amen glory to
[1:49:36] God but we see this great Temptation
[1:49:38] that happens in the end time we've had
[1:49:41] these Temptations through the
[1:49:44] years the pressures that come around the
[1:49:48] word but we see the G how age is closing
[1:49:52] now let's go a little bit further the
[1:49:55] prophet of God says this in that same
[1:49:57] message beginning and ending of the
[1:50:00] Gentile
[1:50:02] dispensation uh paragraph 25
[1:50:06] Elijah I mean not Elijah but Daniel
[1:50:09] fora he saw a prophet he saw the coming
[1:50:12] of the Lord he saw the end time come he
[1:50:16] saw the Gentiles start and if you notice
[1:50:19] the Gentiles started off with a idol
[1:50:21] worship they was worshiping a great Idol
[1:50:24] setting out in the
[1:50:25] field an idol of a man I believe Daniel
[1:50:29] himself cuz King Nebuchadnezzar called
[1:50:31] him basar which was his
[1:50:34] God excuse me he started worshiping the
[1:50:37] image of a righteous holy man and Daniel
[1:50:40] refused to do it so did the Hebrew
[1:50:43] children Shadrach mesach and abedo
[1:50:47] that's the way it was issued in and it
[1:50:49] was condemned
[1:50:50] the head of gold was issued in by image
[1:50:54] worship forced to it it ended up in the
[1:50:58] Supernatural handwriting of a
[1:51:00] supernatural language that only the
[1:51:02] supernatural understanding could
[1:51:04] understand it amen that's the way the
[1:51:06] Gentile Kingdom issued in and it'll go
[1:51:09] out the same way that's right by
[1:51:12] Supernatural Works Supernatural
[1:51:15] interpretation you know what I'm talking
[1:51:17] about the working of the supernatural oh
[1:51:20] how marvelous aren't you happy tonight
[1:51:23] you believe in the
[1:51:25] Supernatural yes sir now then often
[1:51:28] these Vision he showed him just where
[1:51:30] the nations would be standing he showed
[1:51:33] them how that there would so many years
[1:51:35] depend on the Jews he said that the
[1:51:37] Messiah shall come he'll Pro prophesy in
[1:51:40] the 70th week which is three and a half
[1:51:42] years in the midst of it he'll cut be
[1:51:44] cut off which is seven which is seven
[1:51:47] years 70 weeks is is determined for thy
[1:51:51] people 7 years appro approximately to
[1:51:54] the
[1:51:54] Jews and he said and Messiah the prince
[1:51:59] shall come and prophesy in the midst of
[1:52:01] the seven weeks seven
[1:52:03] days will he be cut off in the
[1:52:06] Abomination and make a desolation will
[1:52:08] stand in its place and they'll tread
[1:52:10] Down the Walls of Jerusalem Gentiles for
[1:52:13] a time time and dividing the
[1:52:17] time now when the Messiah come Jesus he
[1:52:20] preached exactly 3 and 1/2 years it was
[1:52:23] cut off for a sacrifice the daily
[1:52:25] obligation was taken away and the and
[1:52:28] desolate the Abomination that make a
[1:52:30] desolation the mosque of Omar was was
[1:52:33] stood today in the place of the Holy
[1:52:35] Temple the mosque of Omar stands exactly
[1:52:37] where the temple stood and he said that
[1:52:39] they would tread Down the Walls of
[1:52:41] Jerusalem over Jerusalem until the
[1:52:45] Gentile dispensation be finished but at
[1:52:49] the end of the Gentiles there would
[1:52:51] still be three and A2 Years yet to the
[1:52:54] Jews now notice one of the most striking
[1:52:59] things of prophetic history I don't
[1:53:03] claim to know the prophecy of the Bible
[1:53:05] but this is like reading a
[1:53:08] newspaper more plain and what we read
[1:53:10] here we know is the truth notice 2,000
[1:53:14] years 2500 years of Jews has been
[1:53:17] scattered to every nation under heaven
[1:53:20] and as God hardened Pharaoh's heart
[1:53:23] bringing them back he hardened Hitler's
[1:53:25] heart mellen's heart and so forth till
[1:53:29] he drove them back to
[1:53:32] Palestine coming back they had made them
[1:53:34] a nation again and on May the 6 1947 the
[1:53:38] Jewish flag was raised over Israel for
[1:53:41] the first time for 2500 years isn't that
[1:53:44] nice how the Lord would Harden their
[1:53:46] heart so that they can get back where
[1:53:49] they need to go Harden not more friends
[1:53:54] less friends so that you God can perform
[1:53:58] his will in your life you said well
[1:54:01] brother I need more friends so I can be
[1:54:03] more like God no you need maybe maybe
[1:54:05] you need less friends I need to take I
[1:54:08] need a break no maybe you need some
[1:54:11] pressure you I need somebody to love me
[1:54:13] no maybe you need a rumor spread about
[1:54:15] you maybe you need something to tie you
[1:54:19] up to where you can't go nowhere but
[1:54:21] your knees because when it's too easy we
[1:54:24] don't pray we don't pray when the checks
[1:54:27] are cleared and money's in the account
[1:54:30] we don't pray when all the vehicles are
[1:54:32] working properly we don't pray like we
[1:54:34] should when everybody loves us but when
[1:54:37] those things break down and the Lord
[1:54:40] allows the breakdown and this is the
[1:54:44] time that we are living in I want you to
[1:54:46] think of this
[1:54:48] Saints we'll never get 2023 back again
[1:54:53] it's only
[1:54:54] 2024 and you'll never get the back years
[1:54:57] back again but you have
[1:55:00] today now is the time and there's be a
[1:55:04] great deception to come that all would
[1:55:07] be deceived and if it wasn't for the
[1:55:10] very elect if you wasn't elected you
[1:55:13] would be
[1:55:14] deceived that's a tremendous deception
[1:55:17] but God is the one that allows it
[1:55:21] and so this this kind of moves us into
[1:55:25] let me move a little bit further so
[1:55:26] brother random continues on he's talking
[1:55:28] about how their hearts were
[1:55:31] hardened these people's hearts were
[1:55:34] hardened and then paragraph 30 says the
[1:55:37] Fig Tree putting forth his Bud Not only
[1:55:39] that but the other
[1:55:42] trees are putting forth its
[1:55:45] Bud the Communist is putting forth buds
[1:55:49] the Antichrist is putting forth Buds and
[1:55:52] the Church of God is putting forth buds
[1:55:56] she's blooming out into her power again
[1:56:00] the Palmer worm eat part of it the
[1:56:02] cankerworm eat part of it the hookworm
[1:56:04] eat part of it the caterpillar eat part
[1:56:07] of it God said it'll live again amen
[1:56:10] she's putting forth buds now the trees
[1:56:13] are putting forth buds Daniel foresaw it
[1:56:18] and rejo
[1:56:21] now are you putting forth
[1:56:24] buds amen are you is God doing something
[1:56:28] in your
[1:56:29] life is God working the works of his
[1:56:32] word in your life for
[1:56:35] today you know this message should mean
[1:56:38] more to us today than it ever
[1:56:41] has amen we're in the greatest deception
[1:56:43] that there ever was we're living in it
[1:56:47] that's right right now we see iten
[1:56:49] happening we see the images of false
[1:56:54] worship and people are calling whatever
[1:56:57] they want to call they're doing anything
[1:56:59] they want to do in the name of the
[1:57:02] Lord you know uh Satan brother Brandon
[1:57:06] makes a statement Satan can't
[1:57:07] impersonate any gift that's right I was
[1:57:10] raised in a Pentecostal church I never
[1:57:12] could understand that I couldn't
[1:57:15] understand that I thought that if a man
[1:57:17] would be gifted and maybe prophesy and
[1:57:20] it come to pass that that would have to
[1:57:22] be God and so therefore everything
[1:57:25] they're saying is true but there's a
[1:57:28] tremendous message brother Brandon
[1:57:30] brings anointed ones at the end time and
[1:57:33] he opens up and shows us some of these
[1:57:37] things that we want to get into here
[1:57:38] this morning how you know here is Moses
[1:57:44] now following the leading of the Lord
[1:57:47] something he had never experienced in
[1:57:49] his life to go down and let my people
[1:57:53] go I can't talk Lord we said we're going
[1:57:55] to fix that Aaron will be the prophet
[1:57:58] you will be like God now go let my
[1:58:01] people go you don't have no Spears you
[1:58:04] don't have no army army you know all
[1:58:07] their secrets and you know that's a
[1:58:08] tremendous Nation this is not Pharaoh's
[1:58:11] not to Fly by Night go and let him go so
[1:58:15] gets the courage after coming into the
[1:58:17] pillar of fire and he's one man
[1:58:20] Invasion I wonder he never did this
[1:58:23] before I wonder if you put yourself in
[1:58:25] his
[1:58:26] shoes I mean the courage of Moses to get
[1:58:30] an audience with
[1:58:32] pharaoh and look at it says God said let
[1:58:36] my people
[1:58:37] go what what are you talking about man
[1:58:40] this is our whole economical base it's
[1:58:44] based on the
[1:58:45] slaves and you going to be one pretty
[1:58:48] quick you don't get out of my office let
[1:58:52] God's people go who's God who's his
[1:58:55] people I'm
[1:58:56] Pharaoh all right you don't want to let
[1:58:58] him go we got a sign for you oh a sign
[1:59:01] let's see stick on the ground he puts a
[1:59:04] stick on the
[1:59:05] ground and his Rod turns into a serpent
[1:59:08] a miracle wow it didn't move Pharaoh one
[1:59:12] bit Pharaoh called Janice and jamas
[1:59:16] that's right and when he calls Janice
[1:59:18] and jam
[1:59:20] they do the same
[1:59:22] thing now this wasn't you know got to
[1:59:24] face the fact that the signs wonders and
[1:59:28] miracles exist outside of the message
[1:59:31] did you know that all right y'all need
[1:59:34] to travel a little bit you think all the
[1:59:36] blessings is here you going to a
[1:59:38] Pentecostal church I'm not saying going
[1:59:41] to one but as an example if you happen
[1:59:43] to go into one and you start hearing
[1:59:45] them people praise the Lord and worship
[1:59:48] there's an anointing that comes down
[1:59:50] there's a blessing that comes down it
[1:59:53] actually feels good and many times they
[1:59:57] know how to do it
[2:00:01] better y'all want to finish it for
[2:00:04] me better than some of us I say it like
[2:00:07] that many
[2:00:09] times and you don't know that if you
[2:00:12] haven't experienced it I come out of it
[2:00:14] these people fast and pray and there's
[2:00:17] an anointing that comes
[2:00:19] and God actually honors their faith I've
[2:00:23] seen them get healed I've heard of
[2:00:26] testimonies of them being delivered off
[2:00:28] of drugs and God blessing them and God
[2:00:31] anointing them and it'll blow your mind
[2:00:33] if you don't understand that God allows
[2:00:36] it
[2:00:38] am here is a tremendous Miracle taking
[2:00:41] place I'm going wind down just now
[2:00:43] here's a tremendous Miracle taking place
[2:00:46] and you would think like well if God
[2:00:48] sent me me and if God sent the message
[2:00:52] all of the people that are out there
[2:00:54] coming against it that they would just
[2:00:57] explode that Holy Fire would just burn
[2:01:01] them up you know you go online and you
[2:01:04] try to witness to someone about William
[2:01:05] brandham you got to be careful now
[2:01:07] because the first heading up there is
[2:01:10] false preacher false prophets
[2:01:14] yeah lying on the
[2:01:17] prophet I mean straight up lies too amen
[2:01:22] I was listening to One of brother Billy
[2:01:23] Paul's testimony I think it was in ' 86
[2:01:25] or ' 87 he was telling of a testimony of
[2:01:29] this gentleman that had took for his
[2:01:32] thesis on who William brandham was he
[2:01:35] says in his class there back East I
[2:01:38] forget what school brother Billy gives a
[2:01:40] testimony and he says that the professor
[2:01:42] gets up and says that William brandham
[2:01:45] was shot and killed in the platform
[2:01:47] because he prophesied a false vision
[2:01:50] that's an egregious lie we know that but
[2:01:52] this guy sitting in the classroom he
[2:01:54] said he didn't know but he he rose up he
[2:01:56] said that's a lie and so he told the
[2:01:59] professor that he would do his thesis on
[2:02:01] that but you you think of an egregious
[2:02:04] lie like that you say well somebody that
[2:02:06] would tell a lie like that God would
[2:02:08] just put him to the
[2:02:10] stop but God allows
[2:02:13] it and there's a reason why he allows
[2:02:17] it and brother vom deals with it in the
[2:02:19] anointed ones at the end time and when
[2:02:22] you get this Revelation then you let
[2:02:24] everybody do whatever they
[2:02:26] doing because you can't make a circle
[2:02:29] into a square you can't make a square
[2:02:32] into a triangle he's either a Believer
[2:02:35] or he's not a Believer and it's not
[2:02:37] about explaining the word of God to them
[2:02:40] you either see it or you don't see it
[2:02:43] and if it wasn't for the election we
[2:02:46] would all be de
[2:02:49] seed can you put that together if God
[2:02:53] didn't elect you you would be lost this
[2:02:56] morning you would be
[2:02:59] deceived Jesus said so it would be so
[2:03:03] great the
[2:03:04] deception Glory that if it wasn't for
[2:03:08] election we'd all be
[2:03:11] deceived but I'm so glad he knew me he
[2:03:16] saw me and he put my name in the book of
[2:03:20] life so let's deal with this just for a
[2:03:23] moment in the anointed ones at the end
[2:03:27] time notice paragraph
[2:03:30] 148 they did the same Miracles but they
[2:03:33] notice they didn't do it till after the
[2:03:36] original word went
[2:03:38] forth that's the way Satan done in the
[2:03:40] Garden of Eden that's the way he done
[2:03:42] all the time who prophesied first Moses
[2:03:47] who come on the scene first Moses or
[2:03:49] balum Moses who come on the scene first
[2:03:52] Jeremiah or
[2:03:53] haniah you see what I mean notice they
[2:03:58] copied carnal
[2:04:00] impersonators sincere thinking they were
[2:04:03] doing God a service as David did last
[2:04:06] week but carnal
[2:04:09] impersonation I'm just waiting a minute
[2:04:13] I want you to think about those place
[2:04:14] these places if you don't say it surely
[2:04:17] the holy spirit will reveal it
[2:04:19] especially to the elected see Pharaoh's
[2:04:23] denomination we have man that can do the
[2:04:26] same thing and they did it see why did
[2:04:30] Pharaoh do this why did God permit
[2:04:35] it why would God send a true anointed
[2:04:38] Prophet down there to perform a sign
[2:04:41] before Pharaoh then let a denominational
[2:04:44] copy come around and copy it before the
[2:04:48] people
[2:04:49] good question right why would he let an
[2:04:52] imp an impersonator rise up to do it and
[2:04:55] do the same thing exactly the genuine
[2:04:58] spirit of God done see the scripture
[2:05:03] must be fulfilled
[2:05:05] exactly notice he did this so that he
[2:05:08] would Harden the heart of pharaoh and
[2:05:12] the Egyptians to prove that Moses wasn't
[2:05:16] the only one that had the word
[2:05:19] oh my that's tremendous to me so he
[2:05:23] allows them to display this gift to come
[2:05:28] under the anointing allow them to
[2:05:32] succeed in their lie telling allow them
[2:05:35] to lie online in the name of the Prophet
[2:05:39] allow them to retell the story of
[2:05:42] brother bradam story and they're
[2:05:44] succeeding and we try to hide it but God
[2:05:46] allows it why so that they're Hearts
[2:05:49] will get hard and they'll have a valid
[2:05:52] reason to disbelieve
[2:05:54] it but to us all right good to
[2:06:00] us it causes us to believe more
[2:06:04] actually why did God let this thing
[2:06:06] happen in the last
[2:06:08] days the so the same thing as a lying
[2:06:12] spirit said to zedekiah how are we going
[2:06:14] to get Ahab out there to make these
[2:06:17] things come to pass you know
[2:06:21] just you getting ready isn't all of it
[2:06:25] in the coming of the Lord there's the
[2:06:27] iniquity of the
[2:06:28] amorites that cup has to be
[2:06:31] filled the iniquity and the sin has to
[2:06:34] get to the place where judgment can be
[2:06:37] poured out they work both together let's
[2:06:39] take a scripture here and we will close
[2:06:42] after this first Kings chapter
[2:06:44] 22 all
[2:06:47] right
[2:06:51] First
[2:06:52] Kings
[2:06:54] 22 verse
[2:07:01] 18 oh what a mighty God we
[2:07:14] serve and the king of Israel said unto
[2:07:16] Jehoshaphat did not I tell thee that
[2:07:19] that he would prophesy no good
[2:07:21] concerning me but evil amen and he says
[2:07:24] Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord
[2:07:27] I Saw the Lord sitting on his throne and
[2:07:30] all of the hosts of Heaven standing by
[2:07:32] him on his right hand and on his left
[2:07:34] and the Lord said this is what the Lord
[2:07:36] is asking who shall persuade
[2:07:40] Ahab that they may that that he may go
[2:07:44] up and fall at Routh Gilead and one said
[2:07:47] this manner another said of that matter
[2:07:49] and there came forth a spirit and stood
[2:07:52] before the Lord and said I will persuade
[2:07:54] him and the Lord said unto him wherewith
[2:07:57] and he said I will go forth and I will
[2:08:00] be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of
[2:08:04] his prophets and he says Thou shalt
[2:08:07] persuade him and Prevail also go forth
[2:08:11] and do so so the Lord gives the
[2:08:17] permission
[2:08:19] for the lie to
[2:08:24] continue and then a church will split
[2:08:27] because of it and we all
[2:08:29] heartbroken a fake friend finally leaves
[2:08:33] you and you all
[2:08:36] heartbroken a false a false Ministry you
[2:08:40] thought it was true finally exposed and
[2:08:43] you all heartbreaking I'm so sad who
[2:08:45] allowed
[2:08:47] it
[2:08:51] we we might have to dance by

[2:08:55] when we get the victory you might have
[2:08:57] to dance but I I want the victory I
[2:08:59] don't care who's with me I want the
[2:09:01] Victory and everybody that's supposed to

[2:09:08] word
[2:09:10] amen it's a beautiful thought it's a
[2:09:12] powerful thought it's a sobering
[2:09:16] thought that God allows the Janice and
[2:09:20] the
[2:09:20] jambers he allows the lying Spirit he
[2:09:24] allows the false prophets he allows the
[2:09:27] false doctrines to permeate through to
[2:09:31] test the True Believer but I'm so glad
[2:09:33] there's a Shadrack there's a meak and
[2:09:37] there's an abendigo
[2:09:39] somewhere there somewhere they might be
[2:09:42] in this assembly they might be in
[2:09:44] another assembly they might be in South

[2:09:48] somewhere somewhere amen that got his
[2:09:50] Revelation together amen and no matter

[2:11:04] pressure to
[2:11:06] squeeze and
[2:11:09] remember only the elected will be saved
[2:11:12] let's take one scripture in Matthew
[2:11:14] 24 before we go Matthew chapter
[2:11:20] 24 verse number
[2:11:26] four now as I said this has to be your
[2:11:29] Bible right amen it's not like our Bible
