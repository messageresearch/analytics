[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning welcome everyone can we all stand we'll we'll open up in prayer we're going to be listening to a 20 a portion for the adult Sunday school of a u message Divine love Sovereign Grace and uh I'll get to uh for those streaming the paragraph that we'll be starting from is number 11 and we'll be going right through uh paragraph number 29 such a blessing to see everybody but let's go to him in prayer Heavenly Father we we're thankful this morning Lord that we can come and honor you father help us father this day to glorify your name father Lord just to lift you up father for all you have done for us Lord for all you are to us help us oh God to love you more Lord to have the faith that pleases you father Lord to just be the people that you want us to be Lord we pray your blessing upon every Sunday school class for the young people Lord Lord that your word would follow them all the days of their life we know it will not return boy Lord we're thankful for the things we've heard this weekend all the ministers Lord all the the preaching father Lord it has just helped us so much Lord we pray today Lord that thy Divine hand would be upon everyone that would speak the musicians everyone that would Lord sing the worship father let thy presence come Lord in a mighty way Lord a stimulation of Revelation father that we can serve you Lord and please you father like we should Lord just dedicate this time now to you in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it sing only believe only only be all things are possible only believe only believe only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brenan in the book of Exodus the 14th chapter and we want to read just a line uh two and then for a little text and my subject tonight is uh maybe a little strange and it's um I want to speak on the subject of divine love and Sovereign Grace and when Divine love has been projected and come to its end its destination Sovereign Grace will then take over and in the book of Exodus Moses and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord that's for a text or scripture reading rather now we're faced in a day that when is prophesied to us that Brotherly Love would become a strange thing among people and it's to my humble belief that that is the greatest of all the gifts that there is is in God's Bible if the Lord Jesus should stand on the platform tonight and uh look me in the face and say I'm going to give you your choice you can be a great person of a great Minister I'll give you a gift of preaching the gospel or I'll give you the gift of teaching the word or I'll give you the gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a prophet or or any of the fine Gifts of Faith any of the gifts that's in the Bible I'll give them everyone to you but then I will withhold love from you or either I'll give you love and withhold the gift from you I say Lord take all the gifts and let me have the love for no matter how many gifts we got they will never do us any good except the love of God is is the motive behind the gift we must have love and as I see this great day appearing that we're now living in were the selfishness and indifference amongst people human beings tribes of the earth it Grieves my heart and I would think of it in a different way if he hadn't have already said that this day would be here where they would be against each other and the things that take place and love would would be a strange thing in these days now did you realize that you being a person as you are that you're not altogether flesh you're spirit and flesh not only that but Jesus said that the Bible said that we are in a miniature way Gods the Jesus said that we are he said if that was prophets and so forth of the Old Testament that Jesus were was referring to said it is written your law that you're God and if he call them Gods who the word of God come to then why not himself being the Son of God when he makes himself equal with God now we are in an amateur way we are creators then I want to just talk to you from my heart now before the service because one a preach that upsets me these two different anointings one of them is for vision and the other is for the word and then if you go on to the word real hard and go to preaching then it the service you can't hold the vision so well it's two different gifts and if you're building your congregation on one and then turn it to another then it's you know what I mean so then but being that we're small and crowd yet we want to place it as much around the word as possible and then have a little healing service because of so many sick now did you ever see some someone that you just love to be around sure you have there's people that you meet and associate with that you just love to be around there's an air about them that you just love to associate with them and then there's fine people that you know of it's very fine people and yet there's just something about them that you just don't feel at home around them somehow you just you don't want to hurt their feelings they're your friends you love them but there's just a difference between them and this other person well what it is we create that atmosphere around us and now I'm a conservationist and of Wildlife and so forth and dealt with wild my mother is a half Char Indian and I I just love the wild Soul so I study God my first study of God was soon nature watching what he did in nature how he watches and what he does and there's one of the greatest hindrance that there is in the church today and right here at Edmonton and ever not Evon I didn't mean to say that I mean Prince Albert and um and among other peoples everywhere is fear but love perfect love castes out fear so you the reason you're you're fearful is because the right Temperance of love has never entered yet when there's real love all fear passes away right when you really love the Lord now I'm not condemning you I'm only trying to bring something to light that you could look at because after all if there's a these sick people sitting around and Sinners and so forth and the differences what makes it all I can't believe that God's pleased with it so there must be something remedy and if we can find that remedy we ought to use it so the thing it is it's a lack of love no matter how many prophecies we have how many great preachers how much theology we know how greater church that we belong to if love doesn't temper that together it's a non effect right and even in 1 Corinthians 13 Paul said go I speak the tongue of men and angels become as a sound Andra te symbol go I have prophet Y and knowledge and understand all the mysteries of God and have faith to move mountains and have not love I am become nothing so we people are more or less going after gifts instead of The Giver see we must come back to the place where you're wonderful people but you must come back first and the key that unlocks the door to everyone we've left the key and rush for the door so when you get there you find out the door don't open because you haven't got the key oh I've often said this that in my world travels I found two different classes of people one of them is the fundamental the group that I come out as Baptist positionally they know where they are that's right but they haven't got much Faith with it and then the other is Pentecostal they got a lot of faith but don't know who they are it's just like a man's got money to Bank you don't know how to write a check the other man hasn't got no money in bank yet he can write a check if you could get the two together you have it now what the church is Laing is divine love I don't mean affectionate love for one another I mean the agapa Love The Godly love and have it so richly in your heart until you just love the Lord and everything you just take his word for it you don't mistrust him my wife is setting present when we were married I took her to be my wife and promis to live faithful to her until death separated her and she promised separated us and she promised the same to me now it isn't a law when I leave and go overseas or somewhere be away a long time I don't have to go say now Mrs Brandon I'm going to lay down the law to you while I am gone I don't want you flirting with any other husband and I don't want you doing so and so I don't say that now she doesn't come to me and say Mr brand then I'll tell you you must not ft with any other wives and you mustn't do this or that we don't think that we just love each other when I get ready to go we kneel in the room and take hold of each other's hands and raise the other hand to God and say thank you Father for being so kind to us and for helping us and now we must separate because you said if you won't forsake wife children and all and cl after me you're not worthy to be my disciple and now father no matter what I would do I'm still not worthy to be your disciple but this is such a little thing that we can do but we're willing to do this little thing that for love that we have for you and we know you have for us when we get through praying I kiss her goodbye and say goodbye sweetheart she you say goodbye I'll be praying for you Billy that's says it no Thou shalt not and thou shalt nothing about it now when I'm out into the field and when I'm out there and yet I would know and I she don't have to worry about me I don't worry about her as long as I love her the way I do she'll never have to worry and as long as she loves me I'll never have to worry so we got confidence in each other as husband and wife that we love one another and that just settles it we don't we just go on the regular routine of life now even if I know that I could do something bad and get by with it and go tell her confess my sin and go tell her I've done wrong yet I wouldn't do it if she'd forgive me and say that's all right Billy I know it was a case of of this that and you've explained it to me I'll forgive you we just forget it I I still wouldn't do it because I love her too much to do that I I love her I would hurt her yet she'd forgive me I know it would scar her heart if I did something was wrong and if I think that was aial love of human love towards my wife how much more ought I to my savior no matter what would be this that I want to please him I want to love him and I want him to be able to say that's my servant I can tell him to go here and he'll do it and I want to say that's my Lord if he sends me here I'll go and that's what love is it's it's something that binds us with God and that takes all the fear now somebody come say Mrs brandom is not true to you I wouldn't believe it you couldn't make me believe it no sir for I have confidence in love I would say oh you reckon she is why will have to get my children no and I wouldn't believe it in the first place because I love her and as long as I love her that way I've got that confidence in her as a woman and no matter what you say the days of the medical tast God don't do this and God don't do that you just might as well save your breath I love him and I believe him and I takeen at his word so that settles it that's all God said so and if you can get to a place where you Lov him it'll cast out the fear that you have that he won't keep his word that's really true now Israel in our text tonight had come into a spot where God by his grace through his word had promised Father Abraham that his seed would sojourn in a Strange Land and among the strange people for 400 years they would be aliens but God then at the end of 400 years would bring them out when the time of the promise Drew nine as the pictures are text tonight there came a time that God's promise was not at hand and God will always keep his promise no matter how ridiculous it seems God keeps his promise do you believe that always keeps his promise and sometimes the most ridiculous way he does it now Moses had failed with all of his military training to deliver people he was trained up under Pharaoh under his mother's Bible teaching and he was to be a deliverer he trained up to take Pharaoh's place to be the great military leader of the powerful Nation who had all the world beat down and one day he thought it's time for me to go I got my ba my DD so I'll just walk out and take things over over and he slew an Egyptian and found out that he was out of the will of God and was a stranger to the land for 40 years but one day back on the back side of the desert after 40 years passed and he was an 80y old man long whiskers and white hair hanging down from the ball spot on his head perhaps walking along there with a chain in his hand God met him in a burning bush because God keeps his tongue you see it yes God keeps his every Thom and God had brought Moses in the world to do the job and God was determined that Moses was going to carry out his PL so he gave him a different kind of schooling and I'm afraid tonight friend as I say it with respect and with reverence I'm afraid that we are giving the church the wrong kind of scoo We Are given him a schooling from the dead letter and not from an experimentalist standpoint of the new verse to meet the true and living resurrected Lord Jesus Christ who's just the same tonight as he was in the days gone by Moses in the light of that burning bush as you all know as Christian that Moses meeting the angel of the Lord in the burning bush he was better equipped in five minutes of talk with God face to face and he was the 40 years of training under a Theology and I say tonight with all respect here it is you might as well button up because it's coming look a man is better equipped to preach the gospel and to stand before the audience with 5 minutes experience before almighty God and all the seminaries could hack out in a 100 Years of an experience right they something happens and sometimes it's ridiculous look at Moses scared running out of Egypt as hard as he could Out On The Backs side of desert looking behind him who is coming is Pharaoh going to catch him on the back side of the desert he went married this colored girl and had two children now in pray to go back to Egypt but in the presence of God and seen God's glory and God's glory was Divine Healing healed his hand with Leprosy and performed a miracle two different gifts he had and he performed this miracle and then let's take a look at Moses look how ridiculous it seems now this is for some of you people that believe that God don't do things ridiculous sometimes in your mind see the wisdom of the world is foolishness in the sight of God right that's right no matter how much wisdom you got you're still foolish in the sight of God and God's wisdom sometimes seems to be foolish to the human mind that's our contrary they are one to another look at Moses talk about something seem ridiculous now Moses run 40 years before as a Young Man trained to this very start with all the Egyptian Army behind him and everything else run from the presence of pharaoh and here he is 80 years old with a stick in his hand look at him going down the next morning had his wife sitting on a mule with a child on each hip leaving a little old donkey the wind blowing on a sck and here he goes down the way to Egypt where you going Moses going down to Egypt to take over what going to do what I'm going down to Egypt to take over the greatest military nation in the world with the millions of armed man and chariots and the best of was in the world would be like going into Russia or some country like that today singlehanded going down to take over 80 years old wish is Bor to one side Le the you with a life with a child on CHP joging along the road where going down to egyp to take over but the beautiful thing he did it because God said so that settles it no matter how ridiculous it looks to you if God said so that settles it that's all no matter if it seems strange you say that they act strange they look strange they're peculiar sometimes God's people aren't peculiar he said they were he seems and they act peculiar to the carnal mind but one time come into the presence of that same Angel of the burning blood and you'll act the same way you you'll have a peculiar Lookout on things you say I ought to have seen that before I ought to know it but it's got to be a con converted mind now here we are at our text tonight how God wants to project to you his Divine s Grace now they' come out here's the Israelites they had listened to Moses reverently they had handed they had took the sacrificial uh lamb and had slain it Puck the blood on the PO open over the L of the door and on the door poost a sign of the cross as the death angel did not come to their home they had separated themselves from all of their possessions you know the trouble of it is we don't want to separate ourselves we don't like to do that but God wants us to separate we want mixers God won separate operator and you have to come out sometime and stand alone if you ever walk with God and so here's Moses now he's brought the children out they followed him and they're coming out and instead of going down to the land of the Philistines God thought if the people said if surely if they see War their hearts will faint and they'll learn back so he led them through the way of the Wilderness I'm so glad that God takes us through the Wilderness Journey there he can get us alone get out alone with God and this Wilderness experience isn't it strange how God leads us into great tribulations and trials look how those Israelites were laying look at the Waters of Mya and how that the Wilderness of sin and all the different places how the path of God leads some through the wat some through the floods some through deep TRS but all through the blood [Music] sh [Music] o [Music] oh

God oh praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God praise God well you can be seated but what an honor to be with you and I really have to thank our brother Israel for inviting us in with my wife and brother Luke and sister Stephanie and really brother luk brother Lucas the ministry started to minister church and what a blessing to have him and S sister Stephanie here with us so I don't know if those Brothers can get the a little bit of water appreciate it and uh what a time we've been having just a jubilee I think my UHA the Lord I kind feel so happy that I was able to come and sit and listen and to hear Brother hadn't heard him for a long time brother um brother Ted bedle and what a message I his style of ministering really was just different and I just enjoyed it and I think I brother Paul what you brought was really special to all of us you know I remember uh the reason it really touched my heart so much is that this year is the first year that we translated the message Christianity versus idolatry and as we were translating it my mind was I was touched by some of the statements and I think brother Paul I was studing Israel brother Israel after of course I call him Israel because he's my son-in-law and you know we just love each other so much and we got so much Inc coming him and I and I really certainly duly thank the Lord because not because he's my son-in-law but I really believe he has a true revelation of this message and like I was mentioning uh brother Paul I was you know we working on that message in Christianity versus idolatry and says my this is just so outstanding because you know brother bandam explains what idolatry and stuff and see what Paul taking that and bringing it out and I I was talking to brother Israel here and telling him I said that took a lot of study and prayer that they be able to put that message together I think brother Paul must have spent a lot of time trying to put all of that together and to see you know what it means to all of us and you know as we see each other and we love each other we see Christ reflected in each other you know we kind of look over our little faults and you know you get with a brother you see all the little faults fs and you know the shortcomings and things you know we don't we look over that and we try to see what the Lord Jesus Christ is trying to accomplish in our lives and you know this morning I got up uh I was up at about 5:30 and was praying and I went back my spirit I went back into the service last night and I was praying to the Lord and saying father you know I do believe with all my heart that you wanted me to speak that to the church because you know brother Brandon mentions it and not to go back on it and I know I kept your little along and you know my wife Liz she's a good judge of of that you know sometimes she tell me she says FY but some of there she told me she says you know what she says last night was a little different she says the people were really enjoying it she says even even if you went a little long she said that was good that was needed and uh sometimes you know it's good to have a little encouragement you know we're human beings and to see the people say you you know what I mean you know brother LTI sitting here I love him so much and all the few and it's good to have a little encouragement sometimes but Billy part used to call it the pattern the flesh that's how he would describe it and sometimes you know he would talk a little bit about it and you know to have a little encouragement I had a few emails came in text messages of people back out of town that sent messages in saying that they listening in last night and what it meant to them to hear it and I I I thought about it and you know I've always wondered even for my own self if I talk not to you but even to my own self and you know I looked and I saw a little bit what brother Brandon mentioned I'm not going to go back into that message again we're going to hit something different and that's why I'm trying by the grace of God if he could help me to condense it and what what was it is this statement brother brandom made kind of It kind of It kind of continued in my mind you know where he says no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world and I see a lack in the people and part of the reason is that this word revelation I do believe has been so misunderstood and because people is thinking well is it an understanding I have is it some kind of a you know a kind of a idea that somebody has because this is what we hear true and wrong all the time I have a revelation and stuff and then last night we went deep into it to show that you cannot have a revelation of something that God did not say it's not like a prophecy or something there's prophecies and stuff it has to be what God has brought so we read the quotes where brother bam says only one messenger for each age receives what God has to say to that age that is a pattern that runs from Genesis to Revelation all through the scriptures and then he says that he speaks to God speaking of the messenger in this age to the church is both true and false and then the message is broadcast to all as we read it last night and he says though it is broadcast to all he said it is received in a certain way and last night we went deep into that to show the way that the Believers receive it God has a pattern of how he does things and um we went deep into that I'm just rehearsing and repeating it to you whereas we have a lot of Brother s God revealed this to them and all these things will fade away and not be a part of Eternity it it be all in one brother have a revelation that will be it's like a a fruit that fell on the ground from the trees when you were in the air and it just rusts on the ground and people don't realize what does Prof us we got a little idea in our minds and we want to push it as the word of God and I mean I hate to say this but it's things that we have seen things we've heard TR he hears and we've seen the fruits of all of this and we don't want to be critical when we talk about these things so we want to look at the positive ends and of course you know we went deep into it and see that God has a manner a way that he gives us the Revelation and we went a little deep into it to show that first he brings it through that messenger that messenger caps all that God has for the age and the challenge to us is not to deviate like what God told Joshua he said stay exactly don't deviate to the left don't deviate to the right so therefore it is not us it's not us trying to put our little you know two pieces into it our little ideas all little things into it the challenge to all of us as Believers is to stay with that and as we stay with it we open our hearts and we accept the Revelation just the way that God has given it to us we went deep into that last night and showed that we're here and even if you know we accept it like brother bam tell us he said even when Jesus stood there with the disciples he preached for six hours and prophecy being fulfilled he shared with them all the scriptures he says but all of that went over their heads you know you could sit there and hear it even if the Lord Jesus Christ himself is here speaking directly to you showing you all the scriptures but you see that's the first phase of it that's how he does it that's what's the first phase is to show you the Revelation by the scripture the promised word for your day the things that God has promised to you what he's going to give to you he does that and then the next step is you open your heart and you accept it and when you open your heart and you accept it brother brandom describes that in a very specific way he says then he gets into you he gets into you when you accept his word but still that's not enough you see because he cannot reveal himself until he gets into you how he gets into you is when you accept his word then you have invited him in then you begin to scry for Revelation more than anything else in the world then he gives you the Revelation because this because as the Bible says no man knowth the father save the Son and whosoever the son reveal it to him so people have taken these things too lightly there is no way for us to know God outside of a revelation see and then the Holy Ghost comes down and he reveals to you that which is already revealed it's not a new revelation it is a revelation of that which is already revealed and last night we we read those quotes we went deep into it and we saw that this is where we are right now and when that Revelation comes of course there's so much in it that we won't have time love is a revelation faith is a revelation the Rapture is a revelation the new birth is a revelation and all of that now let us what we're going to do is this we're going to change direction slightly from that and my subject this morning is the new creation of God uh this is a subject I've dealt with in three parts back home because of its importance um before coming out here and I want to try to share it with you and uh we want to we want to entitle it the the New Creation in us the creation of God in us and therefore we'll go a little deep into it of course there's no way to separate the word of God there's no way you could separate the word from the word and everything just ties up together because it's the word of God and it's a part of God so there's no way that we could separate it it all comes together and how grateful and honored we are for it and as I stand here before you all I feel it's all yeah thank you I appreciate that as we stand here this morning I feel a little bit like I say honored to be invited to be among you and trust the Lord that this will be a great blessing to all of you amen of course last night you were a little bit quiet on me and the church back home does me the same things sometimes and uh and sometimes I'm in congregations and they do the same thing with me and H and then brother Luke kind of said to me a few words to encourage me him and sister Stephanie and they were saying they well the people were really listening because sometimes you know you say amen and then you might miss something so of course you know so he said the people he said sometimes you know we listening he says and we we we want to get into it we want to see it see and then in our hearts as we leave the meeting we cry out to God we pray we ask the Lord to help us because if ever there is a time that the church should be crying out for Revelation it's now that's why the bride will be waiting for the revelation of the Rapture the Rapture is a revelation it's not if I would stand here and explain all the steps of the Rapture to you and you don't have the Revelation what is going to profit to you and that Revelation is Faith you see so anyway let's get out of that message last night let's get into this one and trust the Lord that it will be a blessing so at this time I know we be praying for you brother brother Bill and trust in the Lord we'll be expecting it we'll be coming tonight with a big bowl under our expectations that the Lord will just bless us and use our brother to his honor and to his glory amen let us all stand at this time as we go before him in prayer oh Lord God Of Heaven as we bow our heads before you we've heard the specialist Lord and what a blessing to hear the little children singing and to hear the without singing and to our brother Lord I don't know his name and stood here and Lord and he's sanging what a blessing what a gift you've given him to sing and you're in songs and how we great how we grateful we are for it but Lord as we come into this portion of the SC of the word oh God heaven let it not be me that I'll Stand Here Lord glorify any man or anything of this type Lord you know that's not our motives it's not our objectives lord it's not what we want to achieve or we want Lord is to please you it's the Cry of our hearts and this morning we're going to approach a very another very vital subject and that you brought through the scriptures you want us to know these things you wanted to reveal it to us Lord and I I just pray Lord that it will be a jubilee for this little church that at the end of the meeting Lord we can all say that we've had a Revival together sir oh god of Heaven Let It Be and a pastor here brother Israel oh God bless him the pastors around Lord may you bless them and we certainly thank you Lord and pray that you continue to bless brother Paul Lord his ministry see his dear wi sister hly here with us and the ministry Lord knowing that each Minister goes through that gets sem many experience that Calvary it's hard the better Cup oh lord it's just so hard but we know that after all it brings the the fruits it brings something under the scene it makes us what we should be oh God we just honor you you you're God you know what to do Lord you know how to lead you know how to take a a brother or sister this year in the meeting Lord and heartbroken and heartaches and trials and different things and mold it into your own image and Glory as we look to you in Jesus name amen now I'm going to uh this subject like I mentioned we start subjects and I think brother Paul made a statement I kind of liked when he said that he doesn't want to finish his message because the real truth of it is you could never finish a sermon you know it's so hard if it's really the Holy Spirit there's no way to be able to finish it up amen it just goes on and on and on and on and on and therefore H this message on the new creation there's so much in it that I think um we will start a little bit on it and I'm sure that there's material here to go on for just months and months and months in it but I I got many many several scriptures but we will take First Kings chap 19 verse 9-13 of First Kings First Kings chapter 19 verse 913 and he came thither under a cave he's talking about Elijah now and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and said unto him what doest thou here Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek to take my life and they seek my life to take it away and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice do you know where that SM still Small Voice was huh do you know where it was brother bam says it's spoken Elijah's heart it was not a voice out there and he said that still Small Voice speaks in your heart Elijah heard the voice in his heart amen amen wonderful isn't he that's what I want I want the voice in my heart some want the voice only on the tape I don't blame them if that's how they feel but I want that voice in my heart let him speak in my heart sir let it come from the tape in my heart sir oh are we all feel that way don't we am all right God bless you all let's continue here and it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the end of in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what do is th here Elijah oh when he speaks in our hearts for a blessing all right now we're going to take another scripture here of Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 13-4 and he shall seek me and find me when he shall search for me with all of your heart and I will be found if you sayith the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places wherewith I have driven you sayth the Lord and I will bring you again into the place whence I cause you to be carried away captive and I want to take a scripture going back again in the Old Testament in the Psalms which is Psalm 14 from verse 2 to 3 Psalm 14 verse 2 to3 and the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that do it good know not one Lord your word is so precious to us uh we see such value in every single word that come from your mouth Lord and we know that the challenge to us in this evil age is to stay with every word which you say and not be deviated under the for any consideration By Any Man any whatever comes Lord just help us father that we love our brothers we love our sisters we love everyone but help us father to to be what you want us to be to live by every word that come out of your mouth Lord and not to deviate from this message but to stay with everything you've said as we thank you in Jesus name amen you can be seated God bless you all now um what a blessing amen and we are grateful to him for everything that he has given to us amen all right now brother Brandon here to start with because we going I'm going to start straight to get to the to the get to the point as soon as as quick as I can in the five in the five identifications of the Church of the Living God brother brandham says here somebody said I sought God I sought God that's contrary to the Bible it's God seeking you not you seeking God God went up and down the Garden of Eden crying Adam where thou not Adam crying God where thou it was God crying Adam where thou now this song is a little bit contradictory to the way that we think because to many people that think well you know no no no brother Ferguson I seek God listen close now as we get into this okay because we don't want to just pull one quote and go off with it we want to see everything come together you see there's the reconciliation of the word with the word which we won't have time to go into this this morning brother bam continues message called Resurrection he says you say well bless God I tell you I got to seeking God no you never you never did seek God man never did seek God there's no such a thing as man seeking God did you know that God seek man that's right you said is that scriptural yes sir Jesus said no man could come to me except my father draws him first your whole nature is alt together against God and it has to take the Holy Spirit to first put that desire in there for you to linger after God is that right now we will be dealing a little bit with that as we go further okay all right so it takes the Holy Ghost now let's go a little further into this that no man seeks God of course we could take the scriptures if you want and read some more of the scriptures on this which of course not only in the Psalms but also Paul mentioned this in Romans chapter 3: 10-13 Paul mentioned as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understand it there is none that seeketh after God we go a little further they all gone out of the way they together become unprofitable there is none that they at good know not one their truth is an open sepulture with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of ASP is under the lips now we may not have an idea for ourselves like that but the real truth of it is in our nature is human beings we do not have the nature to seek after God no so look at this look at this church here this this morning we've got the meeting look at the multitudes of people on the outside what are they do you think they want to seek God not at all it's not in man to do that but let's just go a little further so we can go a little deeper into this so you could see what we are saying now brother brandham here in the Hebrews here's what he mentioned uh praise the Lord ain't he good to rest y here it is this is important he said if you love him not a duty that I can't do this and I can't do that you love him too much to do it because he has chose you you never chose him he chose you you said I sought the Lord I sought the Lord no man seeks God it's God seeking him now listen to this you might be seeking a favor of him there's a difference between seeking a favor from God and seeking God you might be seeking a favor of God but God has to change your nature before you can even seek after him because you're a sinner you a pig that's right so it's not you it's what God has done for you it's God CH God has to change that nature in you for you to seek after him now we're going to go a little deep into that in a little bit but just before we do I want to share with you that there are things that comes from the Lord that is not the Lord and people run after these things that come from the Lord but it's not the Lord now we got an example here in the scriptures that we just read in First Kings where we see here Elijah was there and the Bible says if we going to go back and read it again in um 1 Kings chapter 19 and verse 11 and and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord Of course that voice was speaking in Elijah's heart we've got quotes upon quotes on that I'm not going to go into that area we're going to we're going to skip that and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind went the rock the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind now here is a great Mighty Wind that came it rent the mountains it did all but it didn't attract the attention of Elijah brother bam said because Elijah knew that that wind came from the Lord but the wind was not the Lord so here is something coming from the Lord but it is not the Lord the Lord is not in it now here is where the believer has to be able to see the difference between God and the things that come from God favors that come from God blessings that come from God now we're going to go a little deep into that to show you the difference because it would help you in your walk with God there are times you approach God which is not wrong it is not script it's not unscriptural you ask God certain things but what you're asking God for are favors or things coming from the Lord You're not asking God for God you see there's a difference when you come to seek God and when you seek that which is coming from God amen amen you see the difference now we'll go a little deep into it so that you will see these these things coming from the Lord are not unscriptural sinful things they are scriptural things but they are not God exactly okay now let's go a little further we're just going to read Isa and then we'll go into that but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake imagine that a big wind coming into the church Oh Brother people would said boy that's the Lord the big wind oh we was in the church and a wind came and then an earthquake boy a big earthquake everything is shaking everything seems to be shaken when that earthquake hit and people get after that oh brother we had a big earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake so they run after to the wind they run after the earthquake and then a fire oh ATT tracks a lot of people with fires an attractive thing a building burning over the street there you see people standing look at it this is fire boy we had a big fire brother it swep the whole church that's wonderful but we have to ask one question was the Lord in the fire well brother Ferguson come on in scripture yes it came from the Lord yes the fire came from the Lord but the Lord was not in the fire now is to show you that there are things that you and I could come we could seek and we said this is God no that's not God that's something coming from the Lord I'm going to share with you one of those things quickly okay are you ready before we go further because I'm praying pray for me this morning because I I I want to try to hurry okay okay of course I don't think it's necessary for me to go back on all the scriptures because Paul dealt with this in 1 Corinthians 13 which we would look at in a little bit but brother showed us where the Pentecostals made their mistake because they ran after the gifts instead of The Giver they were not able to see the difference between the gifts and the giver but it's not just the Pentecostals that had this problem that's just one of the examples it's just one and of course I I'll go back to First Corinthians in a little bit because First Corinthians goes with this you see because this is the same thing that Paul is showing trying to show the difference between the favors of God and God now on this I need to share a scripture with you that you will see that what brother brandham is saying is exactly with the scriptures Paul deals with this problem in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 21 okay now we're showing you first the negative side and then we're going to move into the positive side to see what God does for us in order because God has to do something for you and something for me in order for us to seek God because Jesus that said seek and he shall find so if he said seek and he shall find God expects you and I to seek but in order for you and I to seek God has to do something for us so it's not really you seeking or I seeking it is really what God has done for us so God has to do something for you you and yourself forget it you wouldn't seek God you will seek the favors of God you will seek the blessings of God he will seek that which come from God but not God now we'll deal with this as we go a little deeper Paul now speaking of this in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 21 the same thing what brother bam is saying he says for all seek their own not the things which are Jesus Christ so something that I want myself I want God to bless me I want this I want to speak in tongues I I want to give to preach I want a prophesy I want this I want that all these things are wonderful they're scriptural but they're not that's not the Lord okay so we could repeat that but then of course we all see that part of it but there's another part of it I want to share with you so it's not just the Pentecostal that went off on that there's another part okay are you ready and I want to share it with you now this might sound very very strange but it is true uh brother Ram speaking in the message now how can I overcome he says here I going to read a little further up he said it never showed him in the church until it come to loud this year and when he got to L this year he said he had excuse me when he got to laud year he had been put out of his church trying to get back in then brother bam goes on he said see justification never put him in as wonderful as justification is you could come to church and said Lord I've sinned against you I've done wrong Lord I shouldn't do these things please forgive me for it and you have a wonderful experience of forgiveness and God justify you it doesn't mean that God is in you that's correct you seeking something from the Lord I'm not hearing any amens here and then sanctification just cleanse the placei for him it doesn't mean he has come in it you now the church has put all the emphasis on sanctification and and what we call having a good spirit and you see people today they believe that if I'm stifi and I have a good spirit that's all it takes to be a Christian listen brother sister you're taking something from the Lord but that is not the Lord now if we look at the example in Esau and Jacob amen amen was a gentleman brother B says today the churches will choose Esau instead of Jacob what what was the difference Jacob was a cook the man was a deceiver look at the list of things that you can have against Jacob you could said here this guy did this he he cheated his father-in-law he did this he did that he even deceived his own father look at all the the man look what he was but God looked long from heaven and understand what did he say of Jacob he said Jacob I love you what did God see in Jacob that he loved because in Jacob there was a desire for God for God the birth light which was the Holy Ghost which was God he had that desire for God and that's what God saw in Jacob Hallelujah now we're going to go a little deep into that so you can see the favor so you see here's the brother he's put all the emphasis in being a good person that he could be a loving sweet person and he comes to the church and he prays for it and God gives it to him and it's not anything contrary to the word we want those kind of people in the church we don't want to we don't think in our mind to have Jacobs we want nice loving sweet people in the church people that have good spirit brother said that is laia they want to be good they want to have good things in them that's the spirit ofia it's not contrary to the word it's something coming from the Lord but that is not God this song is a little surprising because we put all the emphasis on that and we believe it and God forbid that I would ever say anything against it or any preacher will say anything against it how could you speak against the fire that came from the Lord you can't speak against the fire but the Bible is clear the Lord was not in it amen all right now let's go on so if we see the difference between the favors of God and God himself you see uh many of them run after the favor seeking the favors of God and the things coming from the Lord but it's not God to seek God God has to do something for you so let's go a little bit further now to see God doing something for us okay so brother bam is clear on that he said God has to change your nature in order for you to seek out to him so it's not just you and I making the decision in our hearts I'm going to give my heart to the Lord I'm going to I'm going to serve the Lord I'm going to this that decision is is get me right now I we're not against it but multitudes multitudes have made those decisions on belam where are they today some of them painted faces jel they cut their head they live like the devil but it doesn't mean that they didn't make a decision they made the decisions but what we have we come to the place right now where we understand it's more than that and we have to point the people in the direction where it's not their decision but is God what God is doing for them God has to come on the scene and do something for you and do something for me so all what we are doing is in vain until God steps in amen and when he steps in his brother his word it's a going to be anything show you to this message it's going to be word by word by word exactly now let me go a little further uh brother Brandon mentions here as we go a little further into this uh first I'm going to read for you just a couple of quotes quick on this okay now as long as there's something down in our hearts how many believes in Divine Healing all right then sure look as sure as there is a call down in here a desire to be healed of God by Divine Healing there's got to be a fountain open somewhere see before that creation could be in there that creation to make you desire that there has to be a Creator to create that creation is that right is that right well there's got to be a God then somewhere that's putting that desire in your heart the desire that and if he has put that desire there then there's got to be something out there to Def to fulfill that desire that you got okay now we'll go a little further on that in the message the queen of Shea because I want you to see here they see because the emphasis must shift from you to God as long as the emphasis is on you you're going to get nowhere the emphasis must shift from us to God it's not my desire it's what God has given me so then God give me the desire and God does it for me you all understand and he gives me that desire to seek after him now let's go further in the message the Queen of Sheba here brother mam says as long as human beings search and hunger and thirst calling for the power of God there's God got to be a power of God somewhere to respond to it before there could be a creation there has to be cre to be a Creator in their creating that creation and when a man longs to see God there's got to be a god somewhere that created that desire in him if the deeps quing to the Deep there's got to be a deep respond to that because the Deep had to be there first to create that call now when God create that desire in you oh brother let me read to show you how important that desire is that's a part of it's not just an act of a decision it is a work of creation God has created it in you very good amen all right it's a work of creation so it's not just you God come down you want to serve the Lord you want to do that which is right that's good I mean who who in their right mind W want to do that which is good you got people in the Catholics that the woman brother said the woman that becomes a nun she doesn't become a nun because she want to be a bad woman her motive is to be a good woman it's true he said Pharaoh Pharaoh was a kind-hearted man yeah Judas was not the kind of character you think he was Judas had such a good good attitude about him until the the disciples had so much confidence in him until they made him the treasurer it was not Jesus that made him the treasurer it was the disciples that made Judas the treasurer and he says no one knew he was the Judas no one knew it even the disciples asked Jesus who is this man that's going to betray you so you see church it's more than that you see it church it's going to be more than that now we're not here this morning looking around for the Jud the Judas is among us we don't have that kind of an attitude let's be like the disciples they trusted everything they trusted this man and made him the treasurer he had the bag and he was a thief the Bible called him a thief yes sir but not just a thief like Jud like like Jacob Jacob was a a crook but in his heart there was a cry for God Judas didn't have no cry for God in him [Laughter] this is what makes the difference church it's a huge difference when there's a cry in your heart for Revelation there's a cry in your heart for God oh brother it's a big difference between you having a cry for God and you having a cry for the favors and the goodness of God all right now we need to continue on now brother brandom as he goes into this I I think now we can move a little further on because I think now you begin to see the difference between God because God is the word when you begin to seek God you seek the word you want to live by the word you want the word of God in you father I don't want anything else but you I want you but to really have that desire in you God has to create it now here's what brother manam says putting the emphasis a little bit on the desire okay oh this is so nice I feel still good do you feel good about it all right now here this is something here that really is encourage me and I think it will encourage you all too sometimes we need a little bit of encouragement from the message don't we all right so let's see in in the Masterpiece message here's what brother bam says he says on the interview a few moments ago I was speaking to a person in the room that's present now and said but brother brandham I have so many things that I know that's wrong and a Godly little woman but man even said later on she was a Spirit-filled woman I said but but look sister you don't look at yourself praise the Lord and I know that I've heard brother Israel speak many time and he's really I've heard him once he was up out our church and he put a lot of emphasis on this on the fact of not looking at yourself not looking at you know your nature not looking at your faults not looking at you but rather looking at what he has done for you and he says here but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus see he made a way now that desire is so important in you because the Bible says blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin and Better B I'm going on to express it he says he will not impute sin to you because you have no desire to do it so you are blessed you see he takes that worthy desire out of you puts his desire in you but then there is something else I want to share with you on desire just to touch this and I'm when I this this these quotes are quotes that you know you read it like there's something just like like an inspiration just seemed to pull you into it and then I says Lord I was in the back looking at it and reading and I no Lord I want to pull back from that inspiration trying to pull me here and go into this inspiration here for the message this morning but brother Bill this is nice here's what he says now you all hear it when he speak about the token message and what he said about it and I'm not going to spend much time Lord help me because I got to get into my message quick now under token message here's what he mentioned um o well just excuse me one second here I want to be sure I got this all taken care of because I could take a little bit more time on this excuse me you love him with all your heart don't you ain't he good to us all right yeah I think I got it written on here well if I don't that's all right I'll find it brother Brandon when he spoke about the token here's what he says in desperation he says now I'm sure or hope that you got what the token meant see the token is the sign that the blood has been applied that the price that's been asked required of God Jesus pray that price by shedding his own blood he did that then from his life came the Holy Spirit and when the blood is applied to you the holy spirit is a token that your price is paid God has received you of course last night we spoke a little bit about that when you accept the Revelation you accept it by faith the word comes in you then God accepts your faith and when God accepts your faith he reacts to that so you see the action of God to your faith the fact that you believe every every word of the message you've avoided all the Temptations to go into these speculations and all these explanations that are not coming from the prophet not from the Bible you've resisted all those Temptations and these reasonings and this and this and the other and you stayed with that word and then God accept your faith and when God accepts your faith the Holy Spirit God himself reacts to that then you see the action of God as God react to your faith of course we will not go into that this morning it's putting me into that it's pulling me constantly but I have to pull away from that now he says here God has received you and that's the token remember that's the that's the token and then we're going to go a little further down here to what um uh we're going to go a little further down here yes uh this one here in desperation then the life that was in Christ is the Holy Ghost not the third person but the same person in the form of the Holy Spirit coming upon you as a token that your life and your fair is paid you have been accepted this is one of the greatest things we can think of our life to know that I have accepted Jesus Christ is wonderful and this is what the denominations put the emphasis on and many preachers put the emphasis on the emphasis is not when you accept the Lord Jesus my brother sister the emphasis is when the Lord Jesus accepts you am he has accepted me amen I am I am now a part of his bride am I brother don't tell me I'm not the purpose I'm forget the name of my friend you now brother brother Jal see brother say you can accept him that's good but wait until he accepts you when he accept accepts you he accepts your faith then he gives you the Revelation and the only how he can accept you is not the flesh he accepts it's that word in you when you believe the entire word you accept the Revelation exactly what God has said and that's not enough you wait for him to accept you now we try to get away from that now brother B continues he says uh he said your affir is paid youve been accepted until that token comes you not permitted on the highway you're not permitted on the bus line you're not pered to go in until you can present the token and that token is your fair and now it shows that the blood has been shed and been applied to you the price is been applied to you and you have the token thus the blood is applied to you and you've been accepted you accepted oh my oh what a blessing God in his love and mercy has accepted me I've accepted you oh oh brother could we liftt our hands this morning and just glorify him for that just that Revelation to know that all right now now now now now this is the sweet part here Bo we getting our hands in the Honey Bucket aren't we we beginning to feel good don't you feel good all right that's what happened to you you got a stimulation because you got a revelation amen and then you can't help yourself you be you you act abnormally when you get that stimulation people don't understand how you act but that's normal that's what the prophet says now we go on now now just not the certain evidence see not the certain evidence you see you say what brother bam I feel it in my mind you see why why would I know then brother bam answers that question how or why would you know he answers that question look what you were and what you are that's how you know but how are you looking at what you were and how you are amen it's not CLA your face change right or your hair change like brother Bill and I and I see brother Paul and you know brother Israel your hair hasn't changed yet you better thank the Lord but brother Paul I remember when it was all black I remember the first time my wife said to me Fergie is the first gray hair and I said leave it alone that's all right I don't have to tell her that long because one came then another then another then another then almost the whole thing is turned white so brother bam says here look what you were and what you are that is how you know see what you was before this token was applied what you what what are you after it's applied what was your desires before and what is your desires after you see it your desire is not the same amen amen amen amen it changed your desire and that change of your desire the prophet of God says he has to create that in you now as we look into that let's go a step further now now we're getting into our message all right are you ready he quotes Revelation chapter 3 course Revelation chapter 3 and verse just one minute here verse 13 and 14 but he that had on there let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches and unto the angel of the Church of bans write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Amen now that's is how you really to you and I in this day you see we could approach God in many different ways we approach him as a savior we approach him as a Healer correct amen amen amen amen but then here we approaching him as the beginning of the Creator as a Creator he who creates to do what we approach him as a savior for him to save us we approach him as a redeemer for him to take us away from sin to redeem us bring us back we approach him as a Healer for him to heal us now this morning we're going to approach him as a creator that he God will do a work of Creation in US listen church if you're in this meeting today and you can say with all your heart Lord God of heaven I'm here this morning I've approached you as a Healer because I was sick I approached you as a deliverer because I was in sin and needed things to be delivered from my life now this morning I'm going to approach you as a creator that you God will do a creation in me like you did in maryen praise His name name name this is this is his Revelation this is this is a part of his end time Revelation to you and I in the day and time that we are living right now let's go a little deeper into it butam now the prophet to whom the word of the Lord comes the Elijah that's the Revelation that God has given me it's not a personal revelation it is that which is written Quicken to me the Bible says Elijah shall first come and restore all things when that Revelation comes in me it doesn't change it Remains the Same God doesn't change the Revelation when he gives it to you he quickens it amen it's the same Revelation Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things amen then I can't see nobody else amen I don't care who he is yes sir people might see others but not me I don't blame them I don't blame them if they want to see others and they feel happy with that that's between them and the Lord but this is the Revelation it is written it is revealed thus it is written thus it is no no difference no change I don't have a revelation different to what is written what is written is revealed so what is revealed and what is what is revealed in me and what is written is the same thing what is revealed to you and what is written is the same thing there's no difference now we continue now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stand there revealing who he who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church Church oh brother praise the Lord praise God somebody says the church what the church means this this this this this I'm not here to go along with all these explanations and people trying to get wrong stuff he said it has to do with the church and me settled I'm brother George all right this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church that's right that's why I told you this morning let us approach him as a Creator we have approached him as a redeemer we have approached him as a Healer let us approach him this morning as a Creator that's the way he's revealing himself to us in this day amen could you say Amen or that all right now the Heavenly bridegroom created his bride his own bride you see what he redeemed the bride he created her too as the spirit of God he came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body amen it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to human om supplied by Mary that would have been sinful mankind producing about that's where the Catholic Church went off and many of the Protestant churches went off they put Mary in it and made it a mother of God which is nothing else but idolatry as our brother preach amen amen it's wrong and unscriptural right amen that would have that would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would not have that would not have produced The Last adom of him it was said L low a body has thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided that body you see the emphasis must all always be on God Amen not on you and I amen some people love to hear about themselves that's what the whole world is about the promotion of man man's ideas man's achievements man's problems tell me brother Ferguson I want to know about my problems my problems my problems my problems and my nature and I've made this mistake and that's how I I am and I want to know how I am well listen Church we're not psychologists we're here to preach Christ we want to tell what Christ what Christ has done for you we rejoice in what he has done for you we're not rejoicing in what you are we are rejoicing in what he has done for you and then you become you what you become is what he make of you amen he has come this morning to do what to create it's not us it's him doing the work Hallelujah me are you ready are you ready to forget about yourself listen you will not enter into the Revelation if you keep just yourself and the devil love to make you think about yourself you know little brother think about yourself but what do you want to achieve in life what do you want to be my little brother you know it's all about you you know when you were 5 years old this happened to you and when you were 10 years old this happened to you and it's you and you and you and you and you but when he come to the Revelation it's no longer you it's not me it's Christ it's the word I forgot about myself I di to myself the me is yesterday the now is Jesus [Music] Christ oh brother we have come for without revelation we are here now by the grace of God amen amen no turning back now this is the day of man this is the time where the works of man is glorified but in the bride he is glorified it's the glorification of Jesus Christ it is the revelation of him in the bride it is not the revelation of the flesh or the nature or the life of the Bride it is the natur the revelation of the life of Jesus Christ in you it's what he is doing for you come on brother do you see it if you see it forget about yourself now come oh God help us [Music] we get into that we W get into the rest of our message I might end up keeping you too long and then to sit out long mind to preaching now Lord I'll try to hurry okay let's go on here low body H has thou father prepared me God not Mary provided that body amen Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a god manise he was the son of God he was of the new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race who was the first there were those saying is brother brandham church I love brother brandham but the first of that race was not brother brandham now this might this this might step on some people's toes but sometimes we can't help it we people's stes that's right where they get hurt what can we do and I've seen people leave meeting sometimes bitter and hurt and stay that way for years what can you do got to tell them the truth so so we go back here he was of the new creation he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race there it is Colossians 1: 18 and he is the head of the body the church who was the beginning the first first oneor from the dead that in all things he might have the the preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is in you yes sir he is a new sir what is he a new creation who created him did he create himself Satan is no Creator no sir man cannot create amen but is clear on that yes sir amen the church cannot create amen we approaching him as what he is the only creator amen and we approaching him could you raise your hand and give him praise could you glorify him for that all right now let's go on things are all he says here therefore he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things have become new yes amen now let me say this to you when you when you read the Bible like this you aside all the little Coral thoughts and all what the devil trying to BR to your mind and you confess that all things has become new to you that's right amen we say it together all things have become new amen amise there you can see that though man was of the old order of creation right now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus under good works Ephesians 4:24 and that he put on the new man which after God has created in righteous and true Holiness this new creation is not the old creation made over so it's not it's not the old man in a new suit it's the new man in an old suit an old garment God oh brother praise His name this is exactly what it says it is creation amen it is not another creation this excuse me it is another it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh that is how he dealt with Isaac he shows Abraham and of Abraham you God little Isaac line but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation he has proposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator creating himself a create creating himself a part of his creation this is the true revelation of God brother we come right back to the Revelation this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose amen this purpose took took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see themselves still in the midst of the church as the author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation praise the Lord praise the Lord do you see it if you see it raise your hand listen this is not just a gathering of people coming out of different denominations and different groups just to gather here well you could have that anywhere if you see this is just a little gathering like that you've missed the point amen we have come to what we have come to meet the god of creation we're a part of it now listen he's still creating he hasn't stop creating yeah amen he's a Creator he stop don't put listen listen my brother don't put no no full stuff there God created period no no no no no no no no no yes that's good don't step in that come on now wake up all

crucifixion where you [Laughter] died anything that is dead is dead and put away you could spend a lot of time on those things but hurry so then think of it you are then not yourself you are a new creature amen or the Greek there means a new creation you have been recreated again praise the Lord the power of God comes upon you and you become created a new creation which brings the whole physical being spiritually being and everything in subjection to the word of God not no other way how can you say that you're a Christian and disobey his word in one thing and brother brandom goes on okay now I would have loved but I may probably pull back from this when he comes and he begin to create a you I want to read for you something that he mentions here on because see what we have what we doing right now is we moving away from the or creation and as we meet the Creator we are stepping now into the new creation and the Bible is specific about it to make us see the distinction between the old and the new the old things have have let's say that again have passed away behold All Things become new so we entering now into the new creation and what we have in us what God has given us now is a part of that new creation now let's go a little further we're going to see it as we go forward now in our meeting this morning just before we close now brother BR mention mentions it and

build me then that when I see anything going wrong let me go back to the foundation and start again we go back to the foundation what is the foundation Lord God Of Heaven created me we approach him knowing that he is a what a what God is a he has created what in me the the team of the message he has created in me I am a part of the new creation you're not boasting you're only saying what he said if he say you are a part of the new creation you confess what he has said look let me let me read this let me read this one for you this is nice you're talking about Mary here he says and when the angel met Mary that morning and the road to the well and told her she was going to have a baby knowing no man it put her into action she went quickly telling everybody that she was going to have a baby knowing no man she didn't care what it meant to what the people say she had actually met an angel of God and it put her into action she was conscious that the Holy Spirit was upon her that the Holy Spirit was upon her creating in her life oh brother she saw God is a Creator Oh Brother Joseph couldn't furnish that Mary couldn't furnish that amen she was conscious it was Holy Ghost was upon her he says oh if we could only realize that that the Holy Ghost is upon us creating in us a Fai oh God help help us trying to present himself in so many different ways and gifts to create a faith for the rapturing for the rap for a rapturing church could you realize that he's upon you this morning trying to create all right let's go on we can go a lot further there's a part of this message I may have to stop now as he create that in you something happens in you he's created in you and you could said Lord I'm I've been born again you're part of the new now you're a part of the new creation here's what he says this is nice I'm going to share it with you are you ready are you ready are you ready some people didn't say nothing I don't know if they're ready to hear it are you ready to hear it amen oh that's song's good all right now St you of a perfect man you know the answ is all in this message sometimes we seek answers in reasoning doesn't work we seek answers from brothers and sisters doesn't work but explain to me what's happening with you yeah but then the word tells me what it is here what the word says first you must be born again amen and then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you wared then you'll argue against it if you're just riously inclined and you got a little human knowledge that you should do right you'll never be able to agree upon the word of God you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces Faith yes amen amen you see why they arguing anyone agree with the word that's it how they born again look let's leave that alone let's move on now I want to say this to you quickly before we finish listen to this and I'm I'm going to open open this subject up just a little bit but we're not going to go deep into it this morning I have to finish because take me too too much time so I w't go deep into it total Deliverance now when God is doing that work in you it's a perfect work yes God doesn't do halfway work amen let me let me read it for you total difference just like you if you're a Christian God Don't Make Any halfway Christians it's like a it's like we ask the question we ask the question to the church sometimes when is the work of God Perfect When God starts or when he finishes silence my brother says all the way true who says when he finishes who says when he starts who says [Laughter] nothing all right what is the answer God starts in Perfection and he finishes in Perfection yes he does that's what the prophet tell us that's correct God cannot God cannot work in imperfection exactly everything God does is perfect everything man does is imperfect man cannot produce Perfection God Alone is the one to do it all right going into that that's another subject but here he says here God Don't Make Any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians God Don't Make halfway preachers amen but the preacher could be halfway that's correct brother Paul brother Bill brother George Israel we don't want to be halfway preachers but then what is a halfway preacher you know I ask myself that because brother Jo I don't want to be halfway preacher and I don't want to be Halfway Christian I ask myself what is a halfway preacher every Everybody might have their little ideas but let's get to the message but the preacher could be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way it is their own ways got mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that what make them way they are God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on either side today that that has become a lovely word in politics you have to be able to compromise he is a wonderful politician who knows knows how to compromise and this is coming to the church and instead of saying compromise they say you know our pastor is a man of understanding he lets us do whatever we want you know all we have to do is to be sweet and nice and just tell him and he would let us know he knows how to fiddle Fiddle in order to make the fiddle with everybody in order to make
