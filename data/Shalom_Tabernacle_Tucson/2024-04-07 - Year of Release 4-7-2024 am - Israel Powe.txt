========================================

Jo of stimulation of new wi that's and that's what it was on Pentecost when the word was Vindicated now look now Jesus told them Luke 24:49 behold I send a promise of my father upon you but you go up to Jerusalem and wait until what was the promise of the father Joel 2:28 while we find out he's going to pour out the spirit in Isaiah 28:19 how there be stammer lips and other tongues and all these things they went up there and as we went through it maybe one said I believe we waited long enough let's just accepted by faith as good Baptist Doctrine but it didn't work with them brothers so then the first thing you know it had to become a reality and they waited on their Ministry for the word to be Vindicated right and when you come to seek the Holy Spirit you do the same amen yes you can't accept it by faith you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Spirit by faith but then let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he's accepted your faith you see and see Abraham believed God it was a beauty to him for righteousness but God gave him the sign of circumcision as a confirmation he had accepted his faith so that's the same thing we must do we must wait on the Holy Spirit till it's done something not necessarily because we spoke in tongue not because we dancer we got emotional we shouted until we were changed until something actually happened I don't care what form it come seen Wizards speaking tongues and dancing the spirit sure lay a pencil down it right in unknown tongues and somebody interpret it right and tell the truth that's right look this exactly what happened and it was just exactly that way see them throw dust on their head and cut themselves in knives and covered all with the blood of a wied beast or something and and sure see and caught on the devil so you see that don't speaking in tongues doesn't do it though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity if profit me nothing see though I could do it see so those things doesn't mean that you have the Holy Spirit but when he the person the The Immortal Spirit of Christ becomes your personal Savior and changes you and throws your views right straight into Calvary into this word something's happening sir something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know it when it happen and the new wine when it brings Revelation then it it's revealed and that's way was at Pentecost they know that that there's supposed to be a spirit poured out upon them and they waited till this happened and when the Vindication of the Revelation took place then stimulation was on them they sure did they steamed up too they right out into the streets where they was afraid and had the doors shut and they were out in the streets where they hadd been afraid of a group of people are preaching the gospel to them that's right see something had happened because the TRU Word of Promise was Vindicated now let's stop here if that brought such positive to them man that they they nearly every one of them seal their testimony with their blood no matter what come along as long as they live they never got over it it stayed there because it was the True Word of Promise Vindicated the Revelation become a Vindicated and they died sealing your testimony with their own blood now look at the promise of the last days and here we sit Vindicated right before the the present coming of the Holy Spirit and the works that he was supposed to do and we find it right Among Us oh we should oh my how can we er something takes place I tell you friend when the real true sincere predestinated believer when that light strikes upon that seed something burst forth to a new life that little woman that the whale one those scholar priest had said well that's the Devil he's a fortune teller he's he's just telling those people it's fortune and he's he's a devil but when that little woman with that predestinated seed now you think that's not right but Jesus said no way can come except my father draw me and all the father has given me will come and he and the Antichrist the last days is going to be able that Antichrist spirit that we're studying in denominationalism and proven denominationalism is Antichrist amen amen now Beyond any man can walk with me like that he it is something wrong yes still believe that the denominational system is an antichrist when it's absolutely proof from history from everything there is plum through God's Bible and everything else it's Antichrist and Rome is ahead of it and the daughter churches follow right along and both of them are cast into hell right so we see this thing Antichrist the spirit of it and the day that we're living in and why it should bring joy unspeakable and full of Glory that little little woman as soon as that struck her my the seed BL first now remember the Bible says that in the last day that this Antichrist would deceive the whole world am there will only be a before the foundation of the world and when that true Vindication of the revealed truth of God's word strikes that heart St doing IIs the beginning and everything the same thing with human being a chist when all moved away can't found about what irus said I irus long way to he said when that last of the body has come beond was really stimula I think anyone let a moment let's think about got stimulated what he in spirit heet he was AET and he was in the spirit and he seen the resurrection if you like to read Psalm 8 he said glad our rest in because running over in 2 Samuel you got your pencils out 2 Samuel 6:14 they've been a dry spell they took the ark the enemy had come in and got the Ark of the Lord and they took down and set up before Dagon and Dagon fell on his face and tuck in another city and plags broke out that's the hottest thing they ever had on their hands down there and they couldn't get rid of it because it's out of its place now when they put it on the ox cart and start it back and when David saw the ark coming you know what he did he he got so full his cup got running over the stimulation when he seen the word being revealed back into Israel again he d in the spirit all around around around around around yeah his cup got to running over you see why he saw the word returning I think that would make anybody get a little stimulated when to see after all these years and then the True Word by the promise that it would be being brought forth and Vindicated what a time what a time now let's read I I get all talking I won't get to this and I have you all here till 10:30 I let you out early last night so I ought to keep you a good long time no I was just teasing you see we just want just as the Lord will lead now and when he had opened the fource seal I heard the voice of the force Beast say come see now when the lamb had opened the fourth seal let's sto there now the fourth now who opened it the lamb was anybody else worthy no one else could do it no the lamb opened the fourth seal and um the fourth Beast a living creature Like an Eagle said to John come see what the fourth mystery of the uh Plan of Redemption has been hid in this book because the lamb is opening it in other words that's what he was saying there's a fourth mystery here I've oan symbol now John I don't know whether you understood or not but he wrote down what he saw but it was a mystery so he wrote what he saw the lamb was breaking the seals and God still wasn't going to reveal it it was left for the last days am now we had symbols and we pred at it and done very good sometimes see but we know it's moved right on but now in the last days we can look back and see where it has been and that is supposed to be done that at the end of the church age just before the Rapture amen how anyone can get the church going through the tribulation I don't know but what it got to go through the tribulation for when has got hasn't got a sin I mean I don't mean the church the church will go through the tribulation but I'm talking about the bride the bride oh it has got a sin against it at all it's done been bleached out there's not even a uh not even a smell of it nothing left they're perfect before God so what's the to purify them but the others do the church does go through the tribulation but not the bride now now we just took it in all kind of symbols now like uh the the church Noah the car over type went on out into sin see now they did go over but Enoch went first that was the type of the saints that would go in the and before the tribulation period now we find out this lamb open the seal now the first Beast we find if you notice the first Beast we find was the oh the first Beast was alive the living creature found that in the book of the of the church ages and then the second beast I believe was the the face of an ox or a calf and the third Beast was the face of a man but the fourth Beast was a face of an eagle now that's exactly the way we got him routining just exactly like that and that's exactly the way they're even placed in the book here and that is a great teacher at one time in Florida teaching saying that that the the book of Acts was just merely a a scaff work for the U for the church the church was found in the four gospels and we find Vice from that that it's the four gospels that guards the book of Acts it's from those four gospels that the book of Acts is written the acts of the holy spirit in the apostles and we find over the book that them guards are sitting there watching east north west and south remember how we draw it out here how beautifully and perfectly everything hit just to its spot now I want you to notice said come and see John I want you to notice again before this now this here is the last of the writers to reveal the working of the Antichrist tomorrow night strikes the souls under the altar the next night the judgments next night the going away of this of the End of the Age end of time of all things when she's taken up therefore right in that seven seal there pours out vows and everything else are poured out what they are I don't know notice but now on this year we find that this fell here is an eagle this man that or this living creature that's U poured for here now or in other words there's four different ages of it there was an age of the line and uh we find out this being the fourth Ag and he said come and see the fourth mystery of the book of redemption that's been hidden in this book come see and John went to see and he saw a Pale Horse and again the same rer upon this Pale Horse now he has a name called Death now notice none of the other Rider none of the other horses or no time that this rider ever wrote they didn't have that man had no name but now he is called death it's not mentioned he's revealed now what he is is death well how we could Linger on that for a sermon and make it real plain but anything that's anti that's against the real has to be death because there's only two subjects that's life and death and that proves that the holy spiritual revelation of this and this day is exactly the truth the anti he's death because the word as we'll see later here is life amen and this man is called death now it was um not mentioned of the other times of this writer but since now it is mentioned that he's called death but uh under the revelation of the line I watch I I want to read this post so I be sure R down play stand here under not under the revelation of the lines age or of the first age the early age this wasn't revealed the next age was the age of the ox which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as what was now the manlike Beast of wisdom representing the reformers Luther and Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the eagle age the last age the prophetic age were there is to rise prophetic utterance see through whom the secrets always comes now there's where we just we go to a l on that a little while tonight so that you'll thoroughly understand now most times you realize these I'm just not speaking of this group here these tapes go everywhere and I must make it clear because somebody just get one tape and then if you don't get the rest of them they're all hung up see God has promised this see for this day for the last ending up of all these different things that's gone on and being mixed up we are we've had Elijah's garments we've had Elijah's robes oh there's been people it's John Alexander Dow is buried up there wrapped in a a robe he said he was Elijah and we've had all kinds of things like that what is it anyhow it's only to take away a truth that is going to be presented amen amen they had false Christ before Jesus time see they always do that it's Satan running out of Counter to upset the minds and the faith of the people before the thing actually happens that's all didn't Gia say the same thing to the Jews that day said wasn't there a man raised up professed to be this and they tuck 400 out in the wilderness they perished and so forth said every branch that my heavenly father hasn't planted Jesus that'll be rooted upia said let them alone if they if it be not

he's there in the back he's um he's turned as the Lord has turned his life around here the last year or so and um he's had his challenges but the Lord has brought him from a very Mighty long way and uh I've known Angel for for many years years he he's worked for me and uh he's moved he's left the state he's come back he's always seemed to stay in contact with me and here a couple years ago he he had come back into the City and we would talk and um the Lord used Victory Outreach that Ministry to help him to get back on track and they have their phases that they bring you through and and the Lord really touched him and blessed him and uh we've never I never really talked to him about water baptism but here a couple of weeks ago I thought I wonder if Angel knows the correct way to be baptized and so I just mentioned it to him a little bit and he was interested and so I took him to brother osorio's Barber barber shop there on the south and brother Isaac Osorio took the Spanish Bible and uh compared the scriptures with him and he saw that he needed to be back baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so we're so happy to to hear those news and we just pray that the Lord will bless so we're going to do that this morning and uh so Angel you know at the barber shop he you know you know he was almost ready to do it right there and brother osoro said we can do it now well he said he wanted his mother and some of his family to be here so we'll wait until Sunday and then this morning things shifted in the family wasn't ready and this and that so angel said no I want to get it down I'm not going to wait for these people to figure out what they want to do so I appreciate that so we'll baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ stand up angel and let the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise for amen God bless him so we look forward to do that amen so this morning we want to go into the word and also I didn't mention I thought I had presented um Joseph and Sarah they're getting married coming up here um I probably shouldn't know when that's going to be yes I know I'm I'm just messing and so um we thank the Lord for for them and so we yes give them a hand Lord bless them and uh we'll pray that the Lord would just uh bless their wedding day and all those things that come with it the planning and so forth amen so let's take our Bibles and turn into the scripture in Leviticus chapter 25 and in Revelations chapter 5 Leviticus chapter 25 Old Testament scripture we will be observing the Lord's supper tonight and foot washing um our dear brother bonso will be minister tonight so you pray for him Leviticus chapter 25 this morning's message is will be titled year of release the year of release and the Lord spake unto Moses in Mount siani saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give you then shall the land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years Thou shalt sow thy th sow thy field six years Thou shalt prune thy Vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof but in the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt neither swow thy field nor prune thy Vineyard that which growth of its own accord of thy Harvest Thou shalt not reap neither gather The Grapes of thine Vine undress for it is a year of rest unto the the land and the Sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee for thy servant for thy maid for thy hired servant for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee for thy cattle for the beasts that are in the land shall all the increase thereof be meat and thou shal number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven time seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40 n then shall thou cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall Hollow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family amen Revelations chapter 5 verses number one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and 420 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reain on the earth how many can say praise the Lord for his word let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for the words of Life as we have read out of the book of life we pray father that you would bless these efforts and words that will be spoken this morning to your people people Lord let us only speak that which you have for us to say and to hear bless each Heart Lord The Young Ones the older ones the new ones and the mature believer just each one may they receive their portion from you is our prayer we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated amen amen amen a re a year of release the year year of release we read about this year of release it's also mentioned in Deuteronomy chapter 15 and Exodus chapter 21 speaking of the abond servant or when the Hebrews would come into the land and they have their own Brethren that would borrow money or need to borrow because they have fallen into debt and so they would hire them or they would become servants to their own Brethren but it wasn't the intention that for them to always stay a servant so there was a year of release and this year of release was every seven years and then s years times seven years it would be a jubilee year a land a year for rest to the land to the animals all creditors would be um all debtors would be released from their debt and the Lord says that even even if no matter what they owed if a one let's say brother owed another brother in the seven year of release or in this Jubilee year of release he's to let him go for free he's to um Wipe Out the debt and he's to not send them him away empty-handed even he's to uh bestow him with Bountiful gifts as he releases him and the Lord says to do this and do it happily and freely because I will bless you and what's this intention the intention is that that we don't want none of our brothers living under this pressure of being in debt all the time under bondage so he offers the year of release it's a natural law that was established by God to the Hebrews remember they came out of Egypt and they were in bondage for 400 years plus and they were uh slaves for years and years and their whole bodies were slaves they were um in bondage to the Egyptians and so the Lord Lord now in their release they're being set free from in from Egypt through an exodus the Lord is now establishing these laws in Israel so they don't become like their former abusers as as you could see that happens many times many times people they're under debt and they're in stress and they have problems and then soon as they get released from that they go out and they start uh making other they become a Taskmaster themselves so the Lord was trying to or not trying to the Lord was establishing these laws so that these folks these people our Brethren would not live under this bondage of debt if he owed something you had to pay it but then there was a year of release that the Lord released you now in the book of redemption that we read from the book The Bible was the book of redemption and we've been sharing that with you the last few Services before Easter on the things that Adam lost and brother Adam says that the book was the book of redemption and that this strong Angel cried out with the loud voice who is worthy to take this book and John wept and why did he weep he wept because there was no man in heaven or Earth and all the worthy men that have gone on before no one was worthy to take this book and to loose the seals well what's so important about this book well this book had the um Freedom rights for Humanity and so if this book can be released and put back into the hands of the original man then we can all go free but if there's no one worthy if there is no one that can fit the laws to even read the book let alone open it and begin to release it out he couldn't even look at the book no man was found worthy so John wept and then the voice that strong angel said weep not John for the lion has prevailed the lamb has come forth and he's worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof and when John saw that and the 24 elders and all of the hosts that heard that they begin to sing a new song and they fell down and begin to worship the lamb because he was worthy yes I wonder this morning as we've been preaching on the Wednesday nights on our gifts and how we give I wonder this morning if you gave an offering of praise to the Lord this morning morning I wondered if it was a duty for you to sing those songs of Zion or if it came from a willing Heart of Thanksgiving and coming to offer the fruits of your lips through the altar of God praise and thanksgiving for all that you've done it it can become a chore it be it can feel like a duty but when you get past all the requirements and you get past of making sure we're all in key and you get past we make sure the song is up on there and we got the song right when you get past all of that what everybody's wearing who's singing and who's not singing when you get past all of that and you can see him who saved you then you can worship then you can give him praise and offer Sacrifice from your lips to God in worship and praise and that's what they did they saw the book restored back to men and they begin to praise and offer sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving and they sang a new song didn't they and so we know that this book of redemption is is the key to everything that Adam lost now we won't go deep into it but I'll read one or two quotes that I didn't read on what Adam lost in the message who is god brother brandom says this it's a very hard listening to listen to because the recording on it is not that good but if you get a chance to hear that message who is God right in the beginning brother Brandon begins to uh go back he said a a billion years before creation and then he said go back another billion after after that billion and then he's talking about that time frame there and he says this here in paragraph number 13 now let's look who God is just a little bit I'm feeling for something tonight I've asked God something and I believe he's going to Grant it to me I believe it with all my heart now you being in prayer I can't speak until he speaks let me stop here for a minute do you ever ask God for anything and then you're waiting for him to give it to you have you done that this morning you can ask God to show you something this morning that you've never seen before it's a little key it's a little portion that'll help you for tomorrow you can ask God for that and he'll give it to you some of us need that some some of us let's say all of us need something from the Lord and that comes by asking him well the Lord knows what I need no you have to ask him Lord I'm having a difficulty with this is there something in this morning's message that will take that away is there something and then go to looking for it you ask him and then go to looking for your amen spot amen all right Saints and so he says I can't speak in a till speak let's just take back and find out just a minute who God is let's look back at the beginning of time this is a little picture I want to draw so you can get some conception of who this being is in our midst tonight that's moving among us if you can only realize who that is healing would be secondarily or a minor thing to you if you can just see who he is now let's take back a hundred billion years ago and then take back a 100 billion years before that and just keep on going back here not long ago I was in California at the observatory they had a glass there and they could see 120 million years of light space let's drop down a little bit but let's think of before there ever was anything there was God he was in the beginning let's see him and picture him out there in space that's Jehovah we're speaking of and watch how the Trinity of God comes to man just for a moment and there that great space where no one can fathom in their mind beyond that that space eternity that's Jehovah God out there and we're taught in the beginning that the logos or the Son of God went out of God now I do not believe in Eternal sunship that's even radical to even mention such a thing Eternal sunship how he had an eternal sunship way it's even Eternal how could it be a son he had to have a beginning see so we he first was god Jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father that was was that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of god let's notice this now I have to make this before going back into just a little picture drama here for you a moment in order to get one point to you what is in our midst tonight and in there now see this is just like a child playing before the door it was the Son of God the logos and I can see him out there and he spake and said let there be light there was nothing but there was something happened and an Adam turned there and begin to whirl around this way the sun begin to come into existence because he said let there be there's the authority where did he make it from I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was light I can see a peace fly off of that it's a meteor after a few million years or hundred billions of years if you call it it's circled way out I see him standing there watching it it falls down here he stops it after it falls a few million years lets it hang over there in orbit here goes another one flying off the sun it goes over here and hangs down stops it there what's he doing riding his first first Bible notice notice the human beings once look towards the heavens and he puts all the stars in the heavens the Zodiac starting off with the Virgin ending up with Leo the Lion first coming of Christ Second Coming came by the Virgin come again as the lion of the tribe of Judah there he puts the first Bible oh my amen oh back in those days of the ancient days they looked at those things today we got his Bible wrote here but he wrote it in the heavens that man would look up and realize that Jehovah the Creator lived above and then I can see him he looked I can see him speak to this world hanging there as a icicle whatever it was way away and he moved over here I can see This little light go out now we got two now the father and out of the father came the light the son and I can see the light moving over here and pull the O Earth over near the sun to dry it off and he begin to raised the water up separating the land Earth from the water and so forth then he began to create he made the fishes of the sea the vegetable life he put the cattles on the hill it all looked good to him then he said let us make man in our own image after our likeness is that right all right so he made a man God was Spirit he had to be a spirit Man Made In His Image he put him here on the earth to lead the animal life and so forth like the Holy Spirit should be leading the church today that was man then when he put him there's no man to till the soil so he put him in five sense is there there's where scientists they're fearful mixed up he might have give them a hand like a monkey foot like a bear put whatever he wanted to but he put his spirit in him and made him a soul there's the difference we're not coming from an animal life no sir we're not any senses of animal life God made us that's right then however brother B drops to paragraph number 20 and then we're going to make this second man the first man you can't see him God the second man was a Halo now he takes a third man and makes him like a little white cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then and after this man sin he marred the soul uh Blackness Darkness come into him and then God came down and lived in man suffered with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes in man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him and brings him back into perfect Fellowship a part of God now we by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sin we become Sons and Daughters of God who is God the one that stood there and roll the Stars off of his hands Rose worlds out of his hands and made things which do not appear deity deity himself lives in man the Creator made heavens and earth lives in mankind the Bible says we are Sons and Daughters of God so here you know brother banam is saying that these are all men the first man you couldn't see him called God the second man you can see him little white Halo the third man was the spirit that was leading the animal kingdom but they're all three men as he calls them and uh that's beautiful when you read that because it takes you back further than just your Earthly Journey here and the Bible is the one that reveals to you far beyond just your Earthly journey journey uh uh um your Earthly Journey here Adam was uh before he was a man like you could see in flesh here he was a spirit being and he was in the image of God and in that image he had all authority and God had given him that and not only was he in the image of God and God was in was ma had made him in his own likeness he gave this man the same Authority that he had God's Authority he gives it to man over all of creation now this is what Adam lost this is what he forfeited and this is what needs to be redeemed back to the believer in this day in this hour we uh we find out what our rights were through the word of God the word of God shows us what our Origins are what our beginnings are now what I just read to you was a Vindicated Prophet going back a billion plus another 100 billion years before uh creation started and science all they can go back is look into the history of Bones and calculate rocks and matter and they they do what they do and they come up with their creation uh theories and but the really the only one that knows what happened was God himself and he reveals that and so as a man comes to Christ his origin his understanding of who he is will only be made known as he develops a relationship with the book here The Book of Life is the revelation of the book of your life it opens up the origin of you it doesn't just reveal it's nice to know that Daniel who he was and Moses and who he was and all of the great prophets and who they were but you have to know who you are and the word of God reveals that to us doesn't it and we know that this Satan tries to pervert that original word uh to the believer this is what he does he first tries to get you to move ahead of God and to do something prematurely and then he also wants you to stay in the back and fail to move forward once he reveals his will to you there is a danger in not moving forward there is a time element there you see when the Jubilee year sounded that was specific everybody knew it this is the seventh year and the way they would it would be identified is by the priests coming through and blowing the horns the silver horns the trumpets and these trumpets were were blown at length and they denoted a specific happening a specific time this was the year of release this was time you know after seven years or let's say even 49 years you can quickly and very easily get used to uh living your living condition seven years is a bit of time if you think of it you know and and one of the laws in that is if this man was taken in and he was married then the year of release he can go out with his wife but if this man came in single and his master provides a wife to him and then he has children with that wife at the year of release he can go out but his family would have to stay and so it was a decision that he would have to make as to whether you got to watch who you marryed now as to as to whether you going to stay with the master with your family you can you say arguably year one he's married year two he has one two three you can have six kids in this seven-year period and now the trumpet is blowing and young man you have to make a decision are you going to go free or are you going to stay with your family well I kind of need another year to think about it no that was last year thinking about it was last year today is the day that a decision has to be made and we all know that as Believers there's times that we meet these cross rolls in our life that we have to make a decision when you hear his voice Harden not your heart today is the day of salvation you say brother Israel when do I make a move on the Revelation you make a move when it's revealed to you when the Revelation comes that's time that means it's let's go and what's the Revelation the Revelation is the sounding of the trumpet it's called the year of release the Year of Jubilee so there is a danger zone and waiting too long and there was a danger zone and moving too quickly let's take this moving too quickly just for a moment I think we spoke on it a couple of Sunday evenings um talking about Eve getting ahead of God she couldn't wait brother vam says it here in the message spoken word is the Original Seed he says this here in paragraph number 52 or 178 I apologize it's always a little different in our system in the back there says they could not hold it for that past the 50th day cuz that was the day of Jubilee when everything went back to its original beginning the power of God was taken back to his original the 50th day the Year of Jubilee when all things went back now there will come another Year of Jubilee and and and we've had it just about this time if you notice Pentecost has been falling in America for about 50 years somewhere on that time just about 50 years ago Pentecost Begin to Fall now what's happening the church is receiving the seven seal Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals and not one tenth of them can receive it my but when you begin to see the Year of Jubilee where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we've already secured in Christ we already had have the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism we have all of these great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in these Seven Seals and prove to you that them was seals that they were sealed from the eyes of the people of God being my helper I'll prove to you that they could not that that by the Bible then sure if the Bible said so you'll believe it that they could not see nothing but Father Son and Holy Ghost until this time they could not see that there was no eternal hell until this time they could not see that there was an eternal security uh I mean for the real believer of course there's been a mock of of it all the way around an uncertain sound they give that's the reason uh the people they say why look at the Presbyterians so forth they smoke and drink so I'm sorry that was in the message Revelations chap 5 part two but brother Bram is saying there that this Jubilee year the sounding and the revelation of the word couldn't come until this particular time and so what time is that that's the time that we're in now that's the preaching forth of the message the the the revelation of the seven sealed book well this is the book that was sealed with Seven Seals it was sealed by Mysteries it was sealed some like we stood some we didn't but when the days of the voice of the seventh angel shall begin to sound the mysteries of this book should be revealed the seventh Angel's Ministry is to reveal the Mysteries that surround the book that's how we know how to baptize Angel today it's because the Mysteries have been revealed we know what hell is like we even know what it looks like beyond the curtain of time because the seven sealed Ministry has brought that to us now Eve she she couldn't wait she had to move forward in um making the word do something that she believed would be the right order Satan told her do this it's time do it like this and she listened to it you'll be wise um you you you know the Lord knows that you'll be like a god you have a great anointing come over you and she should have just waited because it was going to happen and there was a great mystery coming forward but she could she couldn't wait Satan got in there and got her to move ahead of God and that's what people do many times they'll come to the Lord and they know they should receive the Holy Ghost and so they'll make themselves like speak in tongues or do something and it's not even genuine and you don't have to manufacture anything the Lord will do it the one who called you he'll do it if he wants you to do whatever you got to do he'll let you know that amen but the enemy always trying to push someone I've had it as as a young Minister I didn't know what it was then but as a young Minister you're tempted to see deeper things because you hear others preaching deeper things so you get up and you want to jump and preach something deeper and it really do that's not even you you're not even living there preach where you're living preach what God showed you it there nothing to be ashamed about that you don't know the Thunders you don't know them and so that temptation is there as a Ministry is there I'm telling you as a as a as you know as a personal witness that temptation is there to get on subjects and preach on things that God hasn't thoroughly settled it in your heart yet you don't have to say Amen there something that you don't understand God's not forcing you to to see something that he didn't show you how crazy is that how is God going to force you to see something that he has to show you if he shows you he don't have to force you can I get a witness but then when he shows you you don't have to wait for everybody else to say Amen either amen you run with it don't you I'm out of here I'm going to the ark hey wait brother wait wait you want think about it time no I ain't thinking about nothing talking about nothing I'm getting in the ark cuz it's about to rain when that Revelation strikes if you're a giraffe you're going to get in Noah's Ark when it strikes all the other ones out there eating this other one doing this over there but you're going to move when the Revelation strikes you and you don't have to make that happen so moving forward going ahead head of God is a danger now there is also a danger in waiting behind you know when the Jubilee year trumpet begin to blow into sound you know it's interesting that the Lord made it so it's kind of drastic it's kind of you know it's really critical it was a hard um like time or decision it's like okay you're in bondage for seven years all right six years this is the seventh year now is your opportunity to be set free okay I understand that be set free okay so so if I leave now I'm free I don't owe nothing you don't owe nothing you start over it's a complete reset okay let me think about that okay all right internalize that if I leave now I'll be free completely free I don't owe anything no strings attached you don't owe anything in fact your Master will give you a little something to to get you going okay what happens if I don't go well if you don't go you will bring you to the all altar to the to the post of the priest of of of the Tabernacle and we'll take this sharp all a tool and we're going to bore that through your ear your master has to do it in front of the priest bore it through your ear and from that day on you you really like it here if you really like it here this is your only opportunity you will never hear the sound of the trumpet again or you'll hear it but it'll never be like this time so it's a it's a real it's a decision time it's like if I don't do it if I don't do it I get to stay and boss has kind of been good to me and I got kids and I'm and I got comfortable I got used to it he we understand each other okay if you want to live like that this is what you got to do go to the priest bring all the witnesses and will bore you in your ear and you'll never go free right that's pretty strong what I believe the Lord is establishing here that every man was made to be free you made that way it's inherit it's inside of you to be God made men men make slaves and some people give up their freedom because they feel protection under some master or under some organization or denomination know some Pastor some ministers they link up with people because there's a protection in knowing that I got some boys that can can support my Revelation but can I am I willing to stand out there when nobody else can see what you see there's a freedom that comes with that but it's also a price too now you got to go to work you got to save your money you got to watch the weather you're not asking the boss what we doing today we're going to ask you what we doing today your boss will tell you what to eat now you got to tell you what to eat big difference isn't it it's amazing how people they got it all figured out until they're the boss mhm yes they know all how they would do it how they would run it until it's in their charge we was uh talking about oh I don't want to get sidetracked but let me let me be I'm at home right we we had this Union Gospel Mission there in Sacramento Brother Gary Silva started it and we would go once a year or or we did that for a year and so what did we do the way it was set up that these these folks at the mission couldn't eat until after they heard the preaching so and these different groups would come and they liked us and they let us put the prophets books out there and people would come and take it and so you come and you'd be preaching to this crowd brother John that doesn't look like this here it's a very different crowd and people with their arms folded some of them upset some trying to sleep some waiting for you to say let's all close so they can get something to eat the kitchen is right next door by the way you can hear whatever you smell whatever they're cooking and I you the preachers up here preaching and they like okay get to the point man and there is no amen crows there is no so but that you know that was really good for me brother bons really developed me to you know to stop looking at people in the eyes and when they roll their eyes at you so when you do it today it hurts a little bit but I'm like man it's been a lot worse for me so most of y'all do real good all right but this was a this was a tough crowd and so there was a brother in the church too there was one brother is an EV an evangelist and many of you know him so I won't go too far some of you know him real strong evangelist uh gentleman he came through the city Fireball of the preacher they took him and put him up into that platform brother Joe and it shocked him he couldn't preach it numbed him because when you're always preaching to folks who are friendly and nice and Christian that's kind of easy to do not easy no don't let me discredit it's not easy but it's easier then the house these big grown healthy men looking at you crosseyed a a and worldly people look like they can just come up and get you people look like they just got out of somewhere or on their way to somewhere and it shocked him I forgot all about that Gary reminded me of that we laughed and then there was another young brother in the church that really felt like he had a call to preach he was kind of a deacon and they put him up there and and this scared him straight he got up and try to preach to these people and after that no more he never tried it again like he just ran from it and so it's something how those little experiences will will show and and develop you um as to why was I talking about that well that's just my own taste yeah who knows the Lord knows but you see this this this this year of release there was a time window there and once that that that time window was granted to you or given to you then yes you can go free it's very strong it's very drastic it's very hard and what I was saying was it it looks easier than perhaps you realize it looks easy to get up and preach or to lead or to be a boss or be in charge or something but then when that responsibility is placed to you you have to you know for for many of us and I've understood this over the last two years in particular many of us can't understand why certain people will live under a false Doctrine for many many years and you say you know here the brother brandham says it right there why won't they make a move well it takes a lot of courage to leave from what you were doing for for so many years we're on this side of it takes a lot of courage to interrupt a a a a meal plan that is always going to be there a schedule a boss carrying over you and now you got to you got to go make it work yourself now now you know in that case you can always got somebody to blame but when but when you've been set free and you still ain't getting it together you can't blame nobody now so it's so easy when you you need to this is what empathy is you need to change roles sometime that's good switch seats just for a moment and see if you can handle the pressure huh yes and so this was a challenge if the Lord put it in there and he made it a challenge like if you don't get this right then not in the next seven years you'll get another opportunity no this is for life if you want to stay here you're going to stay here for the rest of your life but but if you want to be free you can be free for the rest of your life isn't that beautiful it really takes courage to serve the Lord it really takes courage to see something that God will show you from his word and then you go act upon it because you have people your friends and people around you that are going to see your new behavior and you got to be able to explain yourself and so this year of release was the year that it came so in this Jubilee brother brandom explains it very well many places throughout the message and we'll take this one here in the message the second seal paragraph number 214 in the Old Testament when a man had been sold to slavery there come a year of Jubilee every 50 years 49th year and then the Year of Jubilee and when the slave heard this and he wanted to go free there isn't nothing can keep him from going free he can throw down his hoe and say so long go back home the trumpet sounded that's right but if he didn't want to go and he was satisfied with the slave master then he was taken into the temple and they take an all you know what an all is is they press his ear and put a hole in his ear and it's a Mark that he can never go back is that right he has to serve this master for all times I don't care how many more times the Jubilee sounds whatever happens he absolutely has sold out his birth rights of being free and when a man turns down the gospel truth Satan marks him where at his ear he deafens him so he can't hear the truth no more and he's finished he stays with the group that he's with if he won't hear the truth there's a lot of people in church today that have this Mark on them there's a lot of people following around claiming they're in the word or in the message and they have this Mark on them how you know they got the mark on them cuz when you show them the word it means absolutely nothing to them they can't hear nothing else no matter what you tell them no matter what you show them they're not going to change and if the word of God won't change them then then then they're deaf spiritually very sad position to find yourself in I think a True Believer should always be humble enough to say you know what I don't know it all right and there might be something I'm missing on this truth Lord if there's something in here that you have for me your word will declare it and if the word produces the quotations then you need to change right I believe that's a true Ministry I think that's a True Believer we seen it in the prophets life in the prophets of the Bible that when truth or greater light comes to them they walk with that truth amen because we know that to be deaf spiritually is um you can't grow you can't go any further with God if you can't hear him speak and if you stop where he has uh was trying to take you to then you're you're just stuck a lot of Christians are stuck right here they know some scriptures they know some quotes but they're not going on any further paragraph 223 he says don't take Satan's unbelieving Mark he'll put it on you tonight if he can do it he'll poke you up against the wall and you walk out and say I don't know about that look at what he says paragraph 224 many message people don't do this you go home and study it and then be sincere and then what well what we need to pray for I'm predestinated if you're predestinated you're predestinated to pray I'm predestinated what do I need to study for if God's going to show show it to me he okay so he he goes painstakingly goes through all the effort to give you this Bible here but you're not supposed to read it what about the seven seal book huh he reveals that to us but we're not supposed to read it and this attitude you've seen it amongst people because they know that there there are quotes where it talks about you know don't take your own thought just live a simple Christian Life and then but the Bible says to study to show yourself approved you're not we're not in a race here to see who who learn more than the next person you're here to learn more from him personally and if there's anything in our life that we can learn more personally from him he'll give that to you that's available to all of us amen so brother randam says take it home you go home and study it then be sincere and pray cuz everything is too too perfectly scriptural at this very hour this sacred hour in time it's done been for years prove come right up to it and this is the hour this is the time and now don't let him poke that in your ear his unbelieving Mark cuz we he was an unbeliever to begin with he was he doubted it all right oh don't let him take that scripture with his wisdom and twist it and pervert it with his own wisdom into reasoning Powers you just be humble and say God said so that's all there is to it amen all right here what the prophet of God says it paragraph 291 in the message 10 virgins and 144,000 amen how many love the Lord this morning amen now there come a time that was called every seventh year that was six years on the seventh Year Bible students ministers and things setting around here knows this to be true it was called the seventh year was called the Jubilee year everything rested there's no crops planted on the seventh year the land rested everything they just gleaned see everything rested on the seventh year and on the seventh year there was a priest that sounded a trumpet and if a man had been a slave I don't care what his debts was he was free now that's a type of the Gospel trumpet you might have served the devil all these years in Chains with drinking smoking gambling sin dirty things no matter what you've done but when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it's a sign that you can go free you can go faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God now you've heard the Full Gospel you don't have to stay bound any longer how many can receive that this morning Faith cometh by hearing yes sir hearing what hearing the news hearing what the past was hear what everybody else is saying Faith cometh by hearing and hear in comes by the word of God when you hear the gospel trumpet sound it tells you you can go free it tells you that you're a Believer it tells you what your name is it actually gives you instructions and in the instructions there's correction and with the correction there's protection that's 2 Timothy 3: 6 16 that the word of God was given so that the man can be fully furnished he'll be corrected instructions that he can be uh foolproof basically that's what the word of God is it's instructions and in those instructions there is correction let's take that word correction just for a moment it's correct don't you want to be right so you get corrected so you can walk on a correct path and that that is is the road that we are walking on this gospel truth is the correct road that's what it is it's the correct road and it is corrective that same word comes from there correct and this is what will correct your life is the word of God it is instructions and in those instructions are Corrections like daily Corrections Pride doesn't want to be corrected you think you know the answer but you don't know the answer yet you think you Haven it figured out but who does have it we don't have it figured out this is why we stay in the word because the word instructs us and in those instructions are Corrections and then when we're instructed right and we're corrected right then we will be protected right that's right your protection ain't you uh developing a way to to sense danger your protection ain't you protecting yourself your protection is the word of God that protects a Ministry that protects a family that protects a covenant that protects any man or woman that's on the correct way is when they stay with the word amen let's take that scripture just for a moment what did I call Second Timothy 3 how many young people will in here this morning let me see your hands all the young people now some of you thank you brother Chris I like that Chris raised his hand see that's on you if you want to be old that's on you I am a young person now how many young people here this morning oh y some some of y'all still want to be old go on age is just a number second Timothy chapter 3 verse number 16 says this all scripture can we read that as a class all together read it forcefully all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness why why that the man of God may be what perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works that's what the word of God does for a Believer it corrects you it instructs you it reproves you that you can be perfect and thoroughly furnac in righteousness now Satan knows this so he's got to discredit the word in your midst the word of your day and what he does he tells you to wait put it off don't do it now you know I'm looking at this some of the reports on this Eclipse that's supposed to happen tomorrow and it's a real deal the science can see it they nailed the time when it's supposed to happen it's not a joke I don't think I think it's quite quite serious you remember the blood moons a few years ago remember in brother R's Ministry he talked about the blackouts there was times there was blackouts the entire nation going on and he he would equate those to spiritual things happening you know droughts and diseases and famines those are all signs that Jesus said in Matthew 24 he said there will be signs in the heaven pestilence famines Wars rumors of Wars the love of many with wax cold how more hateful can we get publicly they're so hateful there's mean people out there they'll shoot you for no reason they'll shoot you over a traffic infraction just hateful the Bible said it would be that way so we as Believers you know it's a real happening they you look at this um this Eclipse that's supposed to take place you know the the last one was was s years ago 2017 and this one's going to cross his axis right on the point there brother Joel Jensen sent me a nice article on it it was very good and sister Margie oampo sent something and the internet is full of stuff and and then they you know they they want to predict that's a Temptation he's coming he's coming it's going and then it's like why do people want to predict want to be the first one to say whatever why why can't we predict what he already predicted to get ready for the coming of the Lord that's the prediction that Jesus is coming and you might not even see tomorrow talking about tomorrow you might not even make it tomorrow your coming of the Lord might be tonight so we're not getting ready we live ready we live in a ready State of Mind because the word of God corrects us to live ready that we can be perfect and entire Lord wanting nothing amen this is this is the time the hour that we live in so the word of God opens up to us these things I'm going to take 10 more minutes okay and this that's good brother Sean said take 30 minutes when a young man man tells you that then I must be well no it's not me all right thank you brother Sean I'll take a few more minutes anyways in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled 1948 what a 1965 paragraph 48 what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how it's How how it's far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the gospel trumpet sound out you are free but if you turn your back upon the message and refuse to hear it notice you were bored in the ear with the awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment you'll never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a slave to the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year how many would want to say this morning Lord open my ears to hear the word of the Lord why don't you to say that with me Lord open my ears to hear the word of the Lord the word of the Lord that's all I'm here to hear I like to hear singing I like to see you folks but I'm really just here to hear the word of the Lord CU When I hear the gospel trumpet sound the gospel word sound the Bible voice sound the sound of his voice speak that's a sign that I can go free it's a sign that I am now living in the Jubilee I'm a product of the Jubilee all of us are there some folks wanted to run and continue on with their slave master they wanted two more years in the world I'll get right one of these days or one of these days but some of us heard the gospel son the trumpet sound in our life and we went out free gone free and we thank God for it it's a choice it's a time to choose brother bam tells us this year in this message here you see it's paragraph number 37 you have also a choice this is choosing another bride I believe when you choose this church you can choose whether in this church whether you'll choose a church that will guide you to your Eternal destination you can choose a church that has a certain Creed that you might think that Creed is just what you want or the other church has their Creed and then there is the word of God you have a choice of you have to make the choice there's an un rooten law Among Us of choosing I believe it was Elijah one time upon Mount Caramel after the showdown in a great hour of the crisis that we're just about to come to right now and perhaps it may be to you or I tonight that we make this Choice like Mount carel experience the Mount Carmel experience frankly I think it's gone on worldwide now but there will soon be a time where that you'll have to make a choice and you men here your denominational churches just believe this that the hour is right on you when you're going to make a choice you're either going to go into the World Council of or World Council or you're not going to be a denomination anymore you're going to have to do that and that choice is coming soon and it's a dangerous thing to wait till that last hour too because you might take on something that you could never shake out of you know there is a time when you can be warned then if you step across that line of warning then you're already marked on the other side branded remember when the Jubilee year come and the priest roll with his trumpet sounding that every slave could go free but if they refused to accept their freedom then he had to be taken to the temple to a post and an all bore him through the ear then he served his master always it was put on his ear as a type of hearing Faith cometh by hearing he heard that trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it and many time men and women hear the gospel truth they see it Vindicated and proven truth but yet they don't want to hear it there's some other reason there's some other choosing but they have then then to face up to the truth and facts therefore their ears can be closed to the gospel they'll never hear it again my advice to you when God speaks to your heart you act right then Elijah gave them a choice which they should choose ye this day whom ye shall serve God if God be God serve him but if B be God served him so we have this there's a time there where you can wait too long you Satan can push you to move forward ahead of time and there's a time you can wait too long but the hour of your deliverance God always reveals that to you through his word and we're glad for that tonight this morning we're glad for that in this evening time yes this is the time that God has laid out for us Hebrews chap 4: 7 let's read that quickly today if you hear my voice maybe sister can pull it up for me Hebrews chapter 4 again he limited a certain day saying skip up one more let me see what verse six says seeing therefore it remain that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached enter not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long time as it is said today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest they would have not afterwards have spoken of another day so today is the day that we react to the word when do you react to the word you react to the word when you hear it and I'm not talking about hearing my voice in the background in the service or hearing the preacher or hearing the prophet's word in the background or hearing the Bible but when you hear it when it's being revealed to you that's the time that God is speaking to you and that's a time that you can go free from whatever has been binding you up remember this Jubilee release was all about this man getting his property back it was about him receiving his authority and some Sons and Daughters of God this book of redemption the seven sealed book of redemption that was preached and given to us was all about us receiving our inheritance that we now are Sons and Daughters of God and whatever we say whatever we ask in his name we can have it we we call on him for restoration of our families we call on him for healing of our bodies or whatever the situation is in the church but you know it's really coming back to our inheritance as a son or daughter of God what was that inheritance Adam had the power over creation and you have the power over your little life in the way you can create so let me ask you Adam and Mrs Eve that's sitting here this morning that have this opportunity to take God at his word the the situation that you're in God has giv given you the power he's equipped you with the creative power to change those circumstances and it starts with the right attitude it starts with never being negative always positive it starts with saying what the word says about you and about your situation it's not about how you feel it's not about others tried it and failed it's not about you know all the negative things markers that are around you it's all about you are a son or daughter of of God and God has giv you the power to create over that circumstance and that starts with your attitude and that atmosphere that you're living in you can call on God to believe for the things that are not as though they are that is what faith is and Faith cometh by what by hearing and hearing by the word of God and so the word word of God tells us that you know he he would he would he would give us the desires of our heart if we would Delight oursel in him he would give us the desires of our heart and what is your greatest desire today you know many times as you mature your greatest desire won't be something you know tangible or natural out there something carnal it's going to be something like seeing some of your family members come back to the lord it's going to be something like some kind of Redemptive restoration of your property your family belongs to you and so we believe that you have that power everybody can't can't walk the message like you everybody couldn't be Joseph there was one Joseph but Joseph's life saved his family's life and actually not only his family he saved all of Egypt he saved everybody so he had to go through that that test or that trial and he made it through and look at the Bountiful fruit that came out of his life it totally Liv outlived him his life that he lived that's what Christianity is is living for others and what about Moses and what about Ruth in the book of redemption Ruth lived her life and after she's dead and gone uh God was looking for a king he finds a king out of the house of Jesse the youngest one who was that it was David that was Ruth's great grandson or her her relative down the road you see that it was in the Commonwealth same thing with Rahab Rahab saved her house same thing with the with the Italian and Acts chapter 10 saved his house and all the workers and those around him because he had come in Channel and come in line and things are are made right and sometimes we want to see everybody do what we're doing everybody come in the same time we're coming in we're not all required to do the same thing God might just call one out of a family brother mam says it like this that many people don't know that the judgments are being withheld on this country because of Holy Ghost filled people now they're not called to live that you are everybody can't be an Abraham true everybody can't be a Levi you know Levi was blessed and born you know from the cradle up he was born in the Commonwealth he got credit for paying tithes while he was in the loins it wasn't even named yet but he got credit for paying TI he said well everybody can't be an a a Levi but but you can be an Abraham though and Abraham's the one who started that going and from Abraham's life it blessed the life of others and this big this year of jubilees was about a man that was bound that come into recognition of what was being sounded and that his inheritance can be given to him and he can have his entire family is that you is that me absolutely that's who this is that's this great book of redemption this um seventh seal the revelation of the seals in Revelations 5 this book was closed Revelations chapter 10 there the mighty Angel comes down down and the book is now open weep not John the book has now been loosed and now we know the revelation of what those seals were there were names there was a mystery behind the book there had to be a message come and there were people that will follow that message and that people is you and I amen that's the standard we live under that's where God has called us to and we thank God for it we heard the Jubilee priest sound we heard that trumpet sound and that's why we take the stand that we take amen God bless you richly let us pray Lord we thank you for your word this morning we thank you for the precious hearts that are gathered Lord we thank you that you're still sounding that trumpet oh God and may those that it sounded to may they hear the gospel trumpet Lord we don't know who they are we don't
