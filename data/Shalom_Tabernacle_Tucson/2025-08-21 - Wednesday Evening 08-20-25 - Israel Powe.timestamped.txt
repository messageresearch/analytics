[7:45] Reach out
[7:47] and touch the Lord
[7:51] as he
[7:53] goes by.
[7:56] Reach out
[7:59] and touch the Lord
[8:02] as he passes
[8:05] by.
[8:07] You will find
[8:10] he's not too busy
[8:14] to hear your
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[8:19] He is passing
[8:22] by this moment
[8:26] to supply.
[8:30] Reach out and touch the Lord
[8:36] as he
[8:38] goes by.
[8:42] God bless you everyone. Good evening and
[8:44] welcome out to the house of the Lord.
[8:46] It's good to see everyone. Especially
[8:48] good to see, brother Art. Like to ask if
[8:50] you could come open the service up with
[8:51] a word of prayer.
[8:57] [Music]
[8:59] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Gracious Lord
[9:02] Jesus, Father, I just want to say thank
[9:03] you Lord for allowing us Lord to be in
[9:06] this house or to worship you. Father,
[9:09] our prophet taught us we don't know what
[9:11] the day holds but we know who holds the
[9:13] day. And father, may we treat this
[9:16] service, Lord God, just Lord Jesus, as
[9:19] you were standing here present and our
[9:20] prophet taught us to
[9:23] take and picture you as though you were
[9:25] sitting before us. Father, we don't want
[9:27] to take it lightly. Father, we want you
[9:29] to come down and be Lord in our hearts.
[9:31] Father, we ask, Lord Jesus, that you'd
[9:33] forgive us of our sins and our
[9:34] shortcomings, even Lord, as we forgive
[9:37] those that trespass against us. Father,
[9:39] that your Holy Spirit would come down
[9:40] and have its perfect will, his way.
[9:43] Father, that you would speak to our
[9:44] hearts and help us to receive, Lord,
[9:46] what we have need of. Ask you bless the
[9:48] Trevor's songs, these musicians, Father,
[9:50] any specials that would be sung, the
[9:52] ministry that would come forth. We ask
[9:55] for a blessing, Father, in Jesus
[9:56] Christ's name, for thy glory. Amen.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:02] Let's go to the key of G.
[10:04] [Music]
[10:06] You have heard of little Moses in the
[10:10] bull rush.
[10:12] You have heard of fearless David and his
[10:15] sling.
[10:18] You have heard the story told of
[10:21] dreaming Joseph
[10:24] and of Jonah and the whale you often
[10:28] sing.
[10:30] There are many many others through the
[10:34] Bible.
[10:37] I should like to meet them all. I do
[10:40] declare
[10:43] by and by the Lord will surely let us
[10:47] meet them
[10:49] at the meeting
[10:52] in the air.
[10:55] Oh, there is going to be a meeting in
[11:01] the air in the sweet sweet by and by.
[11:09] I am going to meet you, meet you over
[11:14] there in that home beyond the sky.
[11:22] My singing you will hear. Never heard my
[11:26] mortal ear will be glorious I doare.
[11:35] And God's own son will be the leading
[11:40] one at that meeting.
[11:44] If you may be seated.
[11:47] Many things will there be missing at
[11:51] that meeting.
[11:54] For the mourers's bench will have no
[11:57] place at all.
[12:00] There will never be a sermon preached to
[12:05] sinners.
[12:07] For the sinner had refused to heed the
[12:11] call.
[12:14] There will be no mourning over wayward
[12:18] love.
[12:20] There will be no lonely nights of
[12:23] pleading prayer.
[12:27] All our burdens and our anguish will be
[12:31] lifted
[12:33] at that meeting.
[12:36] in the air with all your heart. There is
[12:41] going to be a meeting in the air in the
[12:47] sweet sweet by and by.
[12:53] I am
[12:56] [Music]
[12:57] reaching all
[13:00] the
[13:02] beyond.
[13:07] sing
[13:20] and God's own son will be the leading
[13:25] one at that meeting
[13:29] in. God's own son.
[13:32] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[13:38] leading one at the leading
[13:42] in the air.
[13:48] Let's go to the key of B flat.
[13:52] When pains of death seized on my soul,
[13:58] unto the Lord I cried.
[14:03] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[14:10] would not be denied.
[14:15] No, I would not be denied.
[14:21] I would not be denied
[14:27] till Jesus
[14:29] came and made me whole. I would not deny
[14:40] as Jacob in the days of hope. I wrestle
[14:48] with the Lord
[14:52] and instant with courage
[14:58] I stood upon
[15:01] his word.
[15:04] I would not be denied.
[15:10] I would not be denied
[15:16] till Jesus
[15:18] came and made me whole. I would not be
[15:25] denied.
[15:28] Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and
[15:35] would not hear my prayer.
[15:41] Praise the Lord. The work is done in
[15:47] Christ the Lord. Amen.
[15:53] I would not be alive.
[15:59] Oh, I would not be denied
[16:05] till Jesus
[16:07] came and made me whole. I would not be
[16:14] denied.
[16:17] Oh, I would not be denied.
[16:24] I would not be denied
[16:30] till Jesus
[16:32] came and made me whole. I would not be.
[16:41] [Applause]
[16:46] Let's go to back to the key of B flat.
[16:51] Years I spent in vanity
[16:54] and pride,
[16:56] caring not my Lord was crucified,
[17:02] knowing not it was for me. He died on
[17:08] Calary.
[17:09] [Music]
[17:14] Mercy there was great and grace was
[17:19] free.
[17:21] Hearten there was multiplied to me.
[17:27] There my burden soul found liberty
[17:32] at calary.
[17:39] By God's word, at last my sin I learned.
[17:45] Then I trembled at the law I spurned.
[17:51] Till my guilty soul in boring turn to
[17:57] calary.
[17:59] [Music]
[18:03] Mercy there was grace and grace was
[18:08] real.
[18:10] Pardon there was multiplied
[18:13] to me.
[18:16] There my burden over
[18:22] at Calary.
[18:27] [Music]
[18:28] And now I've given to Jesus everything.
[18:33] [Music]
[18:35] Now I gladly own him as my king.
[18:41] Now my raptured soul can only sing of
[18:47] calary.
[18:54] Mercy there was great and grace was free
[19:01] and there was multiplied to me.
[19:06] There my burden soul fell liberty
[19:12] at Calary.
[19:18] And oh the love that true salvation
[19:23] plan.
[19:25] Oh the grace that brought it down to
[19:29] man.
[19:31] Oh the mighty gold that God did
[19:37] at Cal.
[19:43] [Music]
[19:44] Mercy there was great and grace was free
[19:51] and there was multiplied
[19:54] to me and there my burden sold
[20:02] at Calary.
[20:06] [Music]
[20:09] [Applause]
[20:12] [Music]
[20:15] Well, greater is he that is in me.
[20:20] Greater is he that is in me.
[20:25] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[20:30] is in the world.
[20:33] Well, Satan's like a roar in line
[20:38] roing to and fro
[20:42] [Music]
[20:43] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[20:49] tells us so.
[20:52] And many souls have made his pray to
[20:57] fall in some weak hour.
[21:01] But God has promised us to make his
[21:06] overcoming
[21:08] power.
[21:11] Greater is he that is in me.
[21:16] Greater is he that is in me.
[21:20] Greater is he that is in me
[21:24] than he that is in the world.
[21:29] And on the day of Pentecost,
[21:34] a maring mighty wind,
[21:39] it blew into the upper room and baptiz
[21:45] all of them
[21:49] with the power gater than
[21:54] any earthly foe.
[21:59] I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going
[22:03] to let the whole world know.
[22:08] Greater is he that is in me.
[22:13] Greater is he that is in me.
[22:18] Greater is he that is in me
[22:23] than he that one more time.
[22:27] Lord, greater is he that is in me.
[22:33] Greater is he that is in me.
[22:37] Greater is he that is in me
[22:42] than he that is in the world.
[22:49] Let's all stand as we change the order
[22:50] of the service. We'll go to the key of
[22:53] uh E flat.
[22:58] If you're walking through the valleys
[23:03] and there are shadows all around,
[23:09] oh do not fear
[23:12] for he will guide you. He will keep you
[23:17] safe and sound.
[23:20] For he has promised
[23:23] to never leave you
[23:26] nor forsake you.
[23:29] And his word is true. God is good
[23:35] all the time.
[23:38] He put a song of praise in this heart of
[23:43] mine. God is good
[23:47] all the time.
[23:50] Through the darkest night, his light
[23:54] will shine. God is good.
[23:59] God is good
[24:02] all the time.
[24:04] [Music]
[24:05] We were sinners,
[24:08] so unworthy.
[24:11] Still for us, he chose to die.
[24:17] Fill us with this.
[24:20] Holy Spirit,
[24:23] how we can stand and testify.
[24:27] [Music]
[24:29] God is loving
[24:32] everlasting
[24:35] and his mercies
[24:38] they will never end. God is good
[24:44] all the time.
[24:47] He put a song of praise in his heart of
[24:52] mine. God is good
[24:56] all the time.
[24:59] Through the darkest night, his light
[25:04] will shine. God is good.
[25:08] He's so good. Let's take that first
[25:11] verse.
[25:14] Well, if you're walking
[25:17] through the valley
[25:20] and there are shadows
[25:23] all around,
[25:27] do not fear
[25:29] for he will guide you.
[25:33] He will keep you safe and sound
[25:38] cuz he has promised
[25:41] to never leave you
[25:45] nor forsake you
[25:48] and his word is true. God is good
[25:54] all the time.
[25:57] We put a song of praise in this heart of
[26:02] night. God is good
[26:05] [Music]
[26:06] all the time.
[26:09] Through the darkest night, his light
[26:14] will shine. God is good.
[26:18] He's so good
[26:21] all the time.
[26:24] God is good
[26:27] all the time.
[26:30] [Music]
[26:40] All the time
[26:43] [Music]
[26:47] [Applause]
[26:48] [Music]
[26:53] is so good all the time.
[26:58] [Applause]
[27:03] It's good to be in the house of glory
[27:05] with you all tonight. We
[27:07] &gt;&gt; made it back from Columbia, my wife and
[27:09] I, sister to share, and we thank the
[27:11] Lord for bringing us back home safely
[27:15] &gt;&gt; to you all. Amen.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[27:20] Heavenly Father,
[27:22] we ask your blessings on this service
[27:23] tonight, Lord, as the worship has gone
[27:26] forth. Lord, we come to this portion of
[27:29] ministry and of your word. Bless every
[27:32] heart. We pray. We love you, Lord. I
[27:34] pray you touch me in my body. Rebuke the
[27:38] enemy that tries to stop us. Lord, we
[27:41] move forward in Jesus name. Claim the
[27:44] victory tonight. Lord, we thank you for
[27:46] all the precious hearts that have
[27:48] gathered here. Lord, may they receive
[27:50] from you, something very special,
[27:53] something very meaningful, something
[27:55] that will impact them, Lord, in their
[27:57] Christian journey. Our prayer in Jesus
[28:00] name we pray. Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, baby. Yes.
[28:06] Praise the Lord. We'll take our
[28:09] scriptures as we get right into the
[28:12] word. We'll take a scripture over in 1
[28:16] Samuel chapter 18.
[28:32] Before we bring these prayer requests to
[28:35] to the Lord,
[28:38] I' like to welcome each of you.
[28:46] In verse one, and it came to pass, when
[28:49] he had made an end of speaking unto
[28:51] Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was met
[28:54] with the soul of David, and Jonathan
[28:57] loved him as his own soul. And Saul took
[29:01] him that day and would and would let him
[29:05] go no more home to his father's house.
[29:09] Then Jonathan and David made a covenant
[29:12] because he loved him as his own soul.
[29:16] And Jonathan stripped himself of the
[29:18] robe that was upon him and gave it to
[29:21] David and his garments even to his sword
[29:25] and to his bow and to his girdle. And
[29:28] David
[29:30] Saul sent him and behaved himself
[29:33] wisely.
[29:34] And Saul set him over the men of war.
[29:38] And he was accepted in the sight of all
[29:40] the people and also in the sight of
[29:44] Saul's servants.
[29:46] It came to pass as they came when David
[29:48] was returned from the slaughter of the
[29:51] Philistine that the women came out of
[29:54] all the cities of Israel singing and
[29:57] dancing to meet King Saul with tabarites
[30:01] with joy with instruments of music. And
[30:04] the women answered one to another as
[30:07] they played and said, "Saul had slain
[30:10] his thousands and David his tens
[30:13] thousands."
[30:15] And Saul was very wroth and at the same
[30:18] displeased him. And he said, "They have
[30:21] ascribed unto David 10,000, and to me
[30:24] they have ascribed but thousands."
[30:28] What can he have more but the kingdom?
[30:32] And Saul, I David, from that day and
[30:37] forward.
[30:38] Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask
[30:41] you bless your word. Bless your people.
[30:44] We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[30:47] you. You can be seated.
[30:51] We have been talking on this authority
[30:55] and of the sons and daughters of God and
[30:57] also
[30:59] uh being faithful in a few things. He'll
[31:01] make us ruler over many things. And we
[31:04] know that ruler the rulership that he's
[31:07] talking about is that next place is the
[31:10] millennium. Amen.
[31:12] We've been talking about that and
[31:14] thanking the Lord for it. It's been
[31:16] encouraging our faith and just what to
[31:19] look forward to. Amen.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; And uh very simple. And we see this in
[31:27] these principles of training for
[31:30] reigning
[31:31] in the life of of little King David and
[31:35] how he grew in popularity
[31:37] and this great anointing that came upon
[31:40] him.
[31:42] Now
[31:44] this is
[31:46] what we as the saints of God are going
[31:49] through today. We can take this Old
[31:51] Testament example of King David
[31:55] as he went from just a nobody
[31:58] uh fathering his uh or watching over his
[32:02] father's sheep until he became a great
[32:05] man
[32:07] and the Lord moved him up in in his
[32:12] status really made him a popular young
[32:15] man. I want you to take a scripture that
[32:19] first chapter going over in 1st Samuel
[32:21] chapter 17
[32:24] just right at the last end of it there
[32:30] verse number 56
[32:37] and the king said inquire thou whose son
[32:40] the strippling is. And as David returned
[32:44] from the slaughter of the Philistine,
[32:46] Abner took him and brought him before
[32:48] Saul with the head of the Philistine in
[32:51] his hand in his hand. And Saul said to
[32:54] him, "Who son art thou? Thou, young
[32:59] man." And David answered, I am the son
[33:02] of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
[33:06] So he was just a nobody. Is that right?
[33:09] They didn't know who he was, but here he
[33:12] is now
[33:14] coming in the presence of the king. I
[33:16] can imagine there's a lot of young men
[33:19] that would love the opportunity
[33:22] to meet their national leader, the
[33:24] opportunity to meet the king. But the
[33:27] Lord brings little David into the
[33:30] presence of the king because of these
[33:33] little lower level responsibilities.
[33:38] I'm just going to take a little bit of
[33:39] time tonight and just share that with
[33:42] you. So good to be back home with you.
[33:44] Did I say hi?
[33:47] Hello, saints. God bless you.
[33:50] But here he is just like an
[33:52] insignificant position. He's carrying
[33:55] over his father's sheep.
[33:59] these sheep. Maybe he has a name for
[34:00] them, maybe he doesn't, but they're
[34:04] definitely
[34:05] um not something that of any great
[34:08] status. He's just a nobody. He's out
[34:11] there watching over his father's sheep.
[34:14] And we'd call this maybe just a lower
[34:17] level of responsibility,
[34:20] his father's sheep. And then once he
[34:22] would prove that faithful for a period
[34:25] of time, we don't know how much time
[34:27] David was in this role as a shepherd boy
[34:31] watching over these sheep out in the
[34:34] pastures there singing by himself in the
[34:39] presence of the Lord. No doubt his gifts
[34:42] to write music and to write psalms were
[34:45] already in him. They didn't come in him
[34:48] after he was anointed. Those gifts that
[34:51] are in you are born in you. You have
[34:52] them in you right now. And the
[34:55] scriptures really don't give us a period
[34:56] of time. But he gradually moved from
[34:59] being a shepherd of his father's sheep
[35:01] to becoming the king's shepherd over his
[35:05] own sheep. And so these animals
[35:08] represented people.
[35:11] Surely if he would have put his life on
[35:12] the line for an animal then no doubt he
[35:16] would have put his life on the line for
[35:18] people.
[35:19] And and the Lord looks at that this way.
[35:23] And we brought that out in many parables
[35:25] that our attitude towards where he has
[35:29] you in life.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; And and we got to know that where you
[35:33] are in life right now, he has you there.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; If your life is in his hand, he put you
[35:39] exactly where you are tonight. And he
[35:42] put you there and he's watching you. My
[35:44] brother, my sister, little one, older
[35:47] one, minister, non-minister, whoever you
[35:49] are, he is watching you and he gave you
[35:53] life. He gave you the opportunity to
[35:57] express those gifts and qualities in
[36:01] that he gave you for for just a small
[36:03] period of time. We don't know what
[36:05] tomorrow holds.
[36:07] But we see in 1st Samuel 17 that the
[36:10] king asked about him, who is this young
[36:13] man? Who's who's his mother? Who's his
[36:16] father? And this came about because
[36:20] remember he had been anointed.
[36:23] And the anointing came upon him. And now
[36:26] he moved from the lion and the bear to
[36:30] Goliath. The Lord uses him to take the
[36:34] life of a great warrior.
[36:37] And so these battles seem to move up in
[36:42] popularity.
[36:43] Um the lion and the bear that's kind of
[36:46] his testimony, his word against
[36:47] everybody else's. But this one with with
[36:50] the with the giant, this one with
[36:53] Goliath was in the presence of all of
[36:55] Israel.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; This one with the giant was the stage
[36:59] had been set. He didn't plan it. He was
[37:02] just going to go and do as his dad told
[37:06] him to go see how the battle goes and
[37:07] encourage your brothers. And while
[37:10] there, this challenge rises up. And
[37:14] David maybe doesn't know he has this
[37:16] ability to take the giant down, but it's
[37:20] already in him.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And the Lord allowed this stage to be
[37:24] set. Now remember, all of Israel had the
[37:26] opportunity. I think it was 40 days and
[37:29] 40 nights that this boast went out.
[37:34] Give me a man. That's what he asked for.
[37:36] I want a man
[37:38] and we'll settle the battle. And here's
[37:41] David laying in the household of Israel.
[37:46] You know, I was thinking of this great
[37:48] quarterback, uh, Tom Brady, one of the
[37:51] greatest ones. I talk sports a lot, you
[37:54] know, because I that's I come up in
[37:56] that. Many of you know sports. How many
[37:58] of you know Tom Brady is? I don't know
[38:01] if I if you can hear me properly or not
[38:03] cuz I can't. My ears are plugged. So you
[38:06] all pray for me.
[38:08] So but that I can still hear your amen
[38:10] or not.
[38:12] They ain't that plugged.
[38:14] But this Tom Brady was a second string
[38:17] quarterback I think out of Michigan.
[38:19] He's on the um New England Patriots.
[38:23] There's a starting quarterback before
[38:24] him. Forget his name. At any rate, this
[38:29] quarterback gets hurt and they take Tom
[38:32] Brady and give him the opportunity to
[38:34] play. And when they give him this
[38:36] opportunity, whoa, they didn't know that
[38:39] they had the greatest quarterback of all
[38:41] time on their roster.
[38:44] because in the practice and I I relate
[38:47] to that story well because that's how I
[38:50] was discovered on our football team
[38:53] wasn't an injury. We were just getting
[38:57] the snot beaten out of us on this game.
[39:00] Sorry, I didn't mean to say it like
[39:01] that, but you all understand.
[39:03] We're getting beat so bad, brother Joe,
[39:06] out of town and and it was at the
[39:09] towards the end of the game. And so they
[39:12] started putting in the second strings
[39:13] and third string teams in and they put
[39:16] me in, they gave me the ball and I
[39:19] really did well. And so from that time
[39:21] on, I became the starting uh starting
[39:25] position or whatever just in that little
[39:27] school there. And I I knew that feeling
[39:29] because I always knew I can play. I
[39:32] always knew I was good. My close friends
[39:33] knew I was good, but the coaches didn't
[39:35] know how good I was. And it took this
[39:38] opportunity to take place. And the same
[39:40] thing is this was with with Tom Brady.
[39:42] He, you know, this it was a loss. It
[39:45] looks like they lost their their main
[39:47] guy, the guy that all of the scouts said
[39:50] was the better player. He's the best.
[39:53] But when they put Mr. Brady in, he
[39:56] proved himself to be, like I say, the
[39:58] greatest, arguably greatest quarterback
[40:00] of all time. That wasn't the his coach's
[40:04] choice.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; The professionals that should have saw
[40:07] that gift and talent missed it.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; But because they had no other choice,
[40:12] brother John, they put him in. And now
[40:15] you can't argue with his talent.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; And so here is David now. when the Lord
[40:22] wanted to anoint someone from his
[40:24] family,
[40:25] the prophet, the mom and dad, and nobody
[40:30] knew who David was,
[40:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:32] &gt;&gt; I mean, he's just a shepherd boy. In
[40:34] fact, he was asking for Jesse's sons,
[40:38] and he was the last one to bring to come
[40:40] in. They they never saw David as being
[40:42] the king of Israel.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; They didn't know he had it in him.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; This little boy can knock a giant out.
[40:49] Yeah, it's in him.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And you don't know what's in you either.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Until you come in contact with God
[40:57] &gt;&gt; and the word of the Lord ignites your
[40:59] faith that you can do all things through
[41:03] Christ. That let let me say this. Don't
[41:05] let anybody put a limit on God for your
[41:10] life. If it's in the Bible, if it's in
[41:12] the message, then go get it.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; It's 100% for you. Don't wait for
[41:18] somebody else to encourage you. Don't
[41:20] wait for somebody else to say amen with
[41:22] you. You go get it for yourself.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; And that's a personal coming of of age.
[41:28] That's a personal something that has to
[41:30] happen to you. I'm thanking the Lord. It
[41:32] is beginning to happen to me
[41:34] &gt;&gt; and I'm picking up the Bible for myself
[41:37] and trusting God to help me. And so
[41:40] here's David. Now,
[41:42] he's not well known.
[41:45] It says that um in in Samuel 18 that
[41:50] David was accepted in the sight of all
[41:53] of Israel and also in the sight of
[41:56] Saul's servants.
[41:58] The scriptures go even further to say
[41:59] that and Samuel there that all of Israel
[42:04] and Judah loved David
[42:07] because a and there was a reason why and
[42:10] the reason was the scripture tells us
[42:13] plainly if you take 1st Samuel 17 18 and
[42:17] 19 the Bible says because he went out
[42:23] before them and came in. So here's a
[42:26] here's a man actually fighting for
[42:31] for your safety.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; And so don't tell me you love me or
[42:36] care. Just show it.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; And you know this is better shown than
[42:42] told.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; And they saw David come in and come out
[42:47] as a warrior putting his life on the
[42:50] line. And the people began to love him.
[42:53] The Bible says all Israel, all Judah,
[42:57] even Saul's men love David.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Not only that, Saul's son, Jonathan,
[43:06] we read the scripture, falls in love
[43:08] with him.
[43:10] And we can only say this is the favor
[43:12] that the Lord gives you when he anoints
[43:15] you. There is a favor that comes with
[43:18] the anointing. The Lord will open doors
[43:21] for you because of the anointing of God
[43:24] that's over your life. Don't think it's
[43:26] your skill set. And you might have
[43:29] skills and don't think it's because of
[43:30] you have this and that or the other. The
[43:33] Lord is with his people.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; He opens the doors
[43:38] &gt;&gt; that no man can open.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; You know, they might they might try to
[43:42] close the door in your face, but if God
[43:45] opens a door for you, it's going to be
[43:47] open. And you can't you can't say you
[43:50] can't give anybody the praise or credit
[43:52] for that. Believe real believers know
[43:54] this
[43:55] &gt;&gt; that everything they have right now is
[43:58] nothing but the goodness of the Lord.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; This is why we praise him.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; We praise him because he gives us what
[44:07] we do not deserve.
[44:09] He gives us blessings upon blessings
[44:13] upon blessings.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; That we do not deserve.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; If he gave us what we deserved,
[44:22] &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be here tonight.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't be here tonight. Wouldn't
[44:26] have nothing.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; We'd be out here on the street
[44:28] somewhere.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Without destitute, no home, no
[44:32] nothing, no friend, nothing.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the believer knows this. Amen.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; That everything we have, little, much,
[44:42] whatever, mediocre, it all comes from
[44:44] the Lord.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; And the Lord opens this up by anointing
[44:50] King David. this anointing as I studied
[44:54] it a little bit more it's just a just
[44:58] taking a small portion in the scripture
[44:59] there it's like the it's like a lowlevel
[45:03] anointing that is given first and then
[45:07] the Lord sees how you responds to those
[45:09] responsibilities
[45:11] and then he blesses you with more.
[45:13] Brother Bham taught us that he favors us
[45:17] and then he brings more as depending on
[45:21] our attitude for what he's given to us.
[45:24] If the Lord has given us a message with
[45:26] the visions and all of the deep things
[45:29] that are in them and we don't care that
[45:32] they're there, then why would God want
[45:34] to show us more?
[45:37] &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? You're not even
[45:38] taking what he gave you. And so I think
[45:42] part of that is our attitude is that
[45:44] Lord just continue to reveal yourself to
[45:47] me. Um I've heard people say, "Oh, we're
[45:50] just listening to a tape."
[45:53] I mean that's that's a shameful. It's
[45:55] like we're just read I read that
[45:57] scripture already.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; As if reading it, the more reading you
[46:02] read it, it has less power in it.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; I'd argue the other. I'd say the more
[46:07] you read it, the more power is in it.
[46:10] I think the more you listen to the
[46:11] tapes, the more anointing possibly that
[46:14] you can receive from that tape.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil fool you. Don't let
[46:21] people shame you because you listen to a
[46:23] tape in your church
[46:26] &gt;&gt; or you're listening to a tape for your
[46:27] devotion time. I say this, if you don't
[46:31] have a tape devotion time, I would
[46:33] question
[46:35] the spiritual growth, seeing that in the
[46:38] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[46:42] &gt;&gt; and that the ministry of Elijah was sent
[46:45] to turn your heart
[46:47] &gt;&gt; back to the original faith. Is that
[46:49] right?
[46:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And so this anointing,
[46:55] we've already read that that these
[46:57] low-level responsibilities and then he
[47:00] favors us with more of the the
[47:02] anointing. All Israel and Judah favored
[47:05] David. Even Saul's men favored David.
[47:09] His daughter, one of his daughters loved
[47:11] David. And then his own son loved David,
[47:14] which actually
[47:17] caused his life to be spared. 1st Samuel
[47:21] 19:2
[47:23] it says Jonathan Saul's son delighted
[47:26] much in David and Jonathan told David
[47:28] saying Saul my father seeketh to kill
[47:32] thee now therefore I pray thee take heed
[47:35] to thyself until the morning and abide
[47:39] in the secret place and hide thyself. So
[47:42] the Lord gives this favor with David.
[47:46] He's a poor shepherd boy. And the king's
[47:50] son, probably the most popular son in
[47:53] the kingdom, falls in love with the poor
[47:56] boy. And this poor boy now, he gives him
[48:01] his sword, gives him his armor, gives
[48:05] him his girdle, begins to give this to
[48:08] him because he loved him.
[48:11] Um, how many's ever had a friend like
[48:13] that? Yeah,
[48:14] &gt;&gt; guys or girls have friends like that. Do
[48:16] you want to give? And this love was
[48:20] granted to King David through the most
[48:23] important boy there was probably in
[48:25] Israel.
[48:27] Later he was able to save uh David's
[48:31] life because of it. Now this um
[48:37] faithful over a few things, he'll make
[48:40] you ruler over many.
[48:43] Um, just looking at this temptation that
[48:46] brother Brandon brings out to us that
[48:48] money, women, and popularity are the
[48:50] things that a man needs to be careful of
[48:54] to watch out for, not just ministry, but
[48:57] any man.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; When God begins to bless a man or woman,
[49:03] &gt;&gt; begins to bless them, then the enemy
[49:06] comes in. And what a stage was set for
[49:09] David. Now, he was a nobody to where all
[49:13] of Israel knows who he is.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; He kills the most popular foe or enemy.
[49:20] He's now very popular. Saul loves him.
[49:24] All the men love him. All of Israel love
[49:26] him. And then these women begin to sing
[49:29] this song about him.
[49:32] And so the anointing doesn't always and
[49:35] doesn't only give you favor, but the
[49:38] anointing creates enemies, too.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; How many know that's true?
[49:44] &gt;&gt; When the Lord begins to bless you, just
[49:47] remember, everybody ain't happy when
[49:51] you're getting blessed.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; I've seen this so many times. You'll see
[49:56] people go forward and God begin to bless
[49:59] them on their career and their job or
[50:01] maybe bless them with the family, bless
[50:04] them in their finances, bless them with
[50:08] a little gift or something. Maybe it's
[50:10] in speaking or singing or a little
[50:13] position. And then instead of others
[50:16] with that same gift or same, you know,
[50:19] area of ministry,
[50:23] they'll begin to compare themselves with
[50:25] this other
[50:27] these others that are being blessed. And
[50:29] that's a temptation that we all have to
[50:31] be careful of. I see ministers do it. I
[50:34] see gifted people who can sing, they do
[50:37] it.
[50:38] I've seen we thank the Lord for our
[50:40] people here, but I've seen where
[50:43] preachers can't say amen to nobody
[50:48] &gt;&gt; but themselves.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; They're only excited when they have the
[50:52] mic in their hand.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You watch them in the service, they're
[50:56] just disconnected. They can't hardly say
[50:58] amen. I see worship leaders who do this,
[51:00] too.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; They're very noble and quiet in their
[51:03] praise and worship. And then they get up
[51:05] here, they want everybody to be excited
[51:06] with them.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; And I just feel like if you're um
[51:12] like if I'm a song leader, all the other
[51:14] song leaders should have my back.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Don't let me drown up here by myself.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; I'm just slowly sinking, sinking,
[51:24] sinking, seeking. I can't get a pray.
[51:26] Nobody. That's when the other worship
[51:28] leaders should help
[51:30] &gt;&gt; keep me from drowning
[51:32] &gt;&gt; because you know what it feels like.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Huh? What about other musicians?
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; What about other musicians?
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; They should be worshiping with one
[51:44] another.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And you see this, you see this? And this
[51:47] is a temptation that we all have. You
[51:50] know, can I can I be happy if you're
[51:54] blessed in the service?
[51:56] Is that going to bother me?
[51:59] &gt;&gt; If the Lord gives you something before I
[52:01] get a scoop,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; huh?
[52:07] &gt;&gt; We're all human beings here.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Those spirits that Satan likes to anoint
[52:12] people with. You know, Satan was the
[52:15] most gifted and the most talent that he
[52:17] had. He was a writer and it still wasn't
[52:20] enough
[52:20] &gt;&gt; because he wasn't right. Come on,
[52:22] brother.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; And when you're not right, you'll be mad
[52:25] at people that have less than you.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Jealous of people that have far less
[52:30] than you.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; And so, this is where you don't want to
[52:34] fall in this trap of, you know, being
[52:38] lifted up. As soon as God begins to
[52:40] bless a man, then he thinks he is the
[52:44] only one that has that gift or that
[52:47] talent. I love what brother Brandham
[52:49] says right here in the message
[52:56] influence
[52:59] unconditional covenant sorry 1954 he
[53:01] says and then the next thing is
[53:03] popularity
[53:05] usually when God blesses a man gives him
[53:08] a little ministry he begins to think
[53:10] he's above everybody else
[53:13] &gt;&gt; and that's just the time he's on his
[53:15] road out Yes,
[53:17] &gt;&gt; that's right. See that you never you're
[53:20] no more. No matter what God has made
[53:24] you. And if he's give you a ministry
[53:26] that's so big or whatever it is,
[53:29] remember we're only men. It's God that's
[53:33] all that does it. And we must keep that
[53:37] kind of an attitude and love the people.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; I like that. Amen. And the message
[53:44] influence 1963, brother Brandham says
[53:47] this here.
[53:49] The king got along fine until he found
[53:52] out that all the nations was fearing
[53:54] him. He become largely populated. His
[53:58] kingdom got built up. He got lifted up
[54:00] in his heart with pride. You see? You
[54:03] see, we're just I'm just a big man now.
[54:05] And that's the way out. The way up is
[54:09] down. How do you know which way is up or
[54:12] down? Cuz if the world stand in space,
[54:14] how do you know which is up or down? So
[54:17] always he that humbles himself, God will
[54:21] exalt. He that exalts himself, God will
[54:24] bring to a base. He'll bring him down.
[54:29] Always keep humble and be little
[54:34] in what?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Your own sight.
[54:39] No matter what God does for you, just
[54:42] see how much more humbler you can be all
[54:47] the time. More God blesses you, just
[54:49] keep getting more humble all the time.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; He can continue to bless. But when you
[54:55] get to the place you think, I got it.
[54:57] You haven't got it. You're on your road
[54:59] out. That's right.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; See, you lose your influence. You lose
[55:05] the strength of your testimony.
[55:08] Amen.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Banner continues in 1963
[55:13] influence and he says this here in
[55:15] November. But if God blesses you, you
[55:18] stay in the category that God has called
[55:21] you in. If it's a housewife, remain a
[55:24] housewife.
[55:26] Excuse me. If it's in a business, remain
[55:28] in that business, reflecting God.
[55:30] Whatever God has called you to, let it
[55:33] be that because he wants you to be a
[55:35] real housewife to reflect your influence
[55:38] upon another person that would want to
[55:42] be a good housewife. If you're a good
[55:44] businessman,
[55:45] let your life so be that it will reflect
[55:48] Jesus Christ in your business with
[55:50] honesty and integrity and with things
[55:54] that really mean something because
[55:57] somebody is watching your life. You're
[56:01] influencing somebody. God has to have a
[56:05] real housewife.
[56:09] Amen. So now
[56:12] this is what we see that soon as God
[56:14] begins to bless a man and I started to
[56:17] think on that and meditate on that a
[56:19] little bit more. Look at what the
[56:21] message search
[56:24] has done
[56:27] or the ability to have the entire tape
[56:31] library.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Look at what it's done across the board.
[56:37] Has it caused more saints to be in the
[56:39] house of God more? Or have we seen more
[56:43] people stay at home and and and leave
[56:47] church
[56:50] and you know and they leave church with
[56:51] a quotation in their hand. Several of
[56:55] them
[56:56] they can explain their behavior.
[56:59] There's no church. The church can have
[57:02] 15, 20, 30 churches in the city and none
[57:07] of them are good enough.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; I can't find any church that agrees
[57:14] exactly with me, so I'll start my own.
[57:19] That's what Sister Kay would say.
[57:22] Sister Kay would say, "I'm going to
[57:23] start my own church if I have to."
[57:28] And that's literally we see that taking
[57:30] place. And you would think, wow, more of
[57:32] the message, more research, more
[57:35] information that ought to create more
[57:38] love. But it seems like, and I it's not
[57:40] everywhere. It's not everywhere, but we
[57:42] have seen more arguing and fussing,
[57:46] separation.
[57:48] We've slicing it even thinner on why we
[57:51] can't get together. And it's just, it's
[57:55] like the Lord blessed us with that
[57:57] ability to search out all the word.
[58:00] And it really hasn't reflected in a lot
[58:02] of our a lot of the lives that we see.
[58:05] Like I say, that's not all. That's not
[58:08] all. But we see too much of it. You
[58:11] would think that more of the tapes would
[58:14] create more love.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Or more obedience to the word. We don't
[58:22] see that, do we?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; We're seeing more.
[58:26] I mean, it's just another thing coming
[58:28] out next. what's next?
[58:30] And so this temptation that King David
[58:34] had to face. So first look at what he
[58:37] had to go through. His outer temptations
[58:41] were his father-in-law.
[58:44] And this is a tough one. Here's King
[58:47] David now having to behave himself
[58:51] wisely
[58:52] against the Lord's anointed.
[58:56] What do you do when your enemy is the
[58:59] Lord's anointed one?
[59:02] How do you behave yourself with someone
[59:05] that can throw a stone at you, but you
[59:07] can't throw one back?
[59:10] They don't have the discipline to
[59:12] believe everything in the in the word,
[59:14] but you do.
[59:16] And so, you can't never jump down on
[59:18] somebody else's level. God holds you
[59:20] accountable to what he showed you.
[59:24] They might have started it. They might
[59:26] not play by the rules. But you got to
[59:27] play by the rules
[59:29] &gt;&gt; all the time.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And this is more a test now of what's
[59:37] inside of David. So this is this is a
[59:41] higher level of the war, not outside,
[59:45] but the inside wars, the wars that work
[59:48] within us. the power to control you,
[59:54] your attitude,
[59:57] your own spirit.
[59:59] And if we can't control that, then why
[1:00:02] would the Lord
[1:00:04] need us in a city to rule and reign
[1:00:09] quote unquote over the heathens if we
[1:00:12] can't even rule and reign
[1:00:15] in this little small space of time
[1:00:21] and we'll lose it on our job. We'll lose
[1:00:24] it in our home. We'll lose it in working
[1:00:28] with one. And then it becomes common
[1:00:30] behavior and then it becomes accepted
[1:00:32] like
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; the message gives us the okay to behave
[1:00:36] like this. No,
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; no, no, no. At some point somebody's got
[1:00:40] to change.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; And the word is not going to.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; So the somebody is you.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; And this authority, this this power,
[1:00:52] it's not power. It's really the
[1:00:53] authority as brother Vanda taught us. is
[1:00:55] not power, but he gives us authority.
[1:00:58] And that little policeman, he has the
[1:01:01] authority because of his position that
[1:01:03] God gave him
[1:01:05] to go out here and arrest a man or make
[1:01:08] you slow down or make you obey the law.
[1:01:11] He's just a regular guy. Just has
[1:01:14] nothing to do with his physical
[1:01:15] strength, but it has to do with his
[1:01:17] position as as a um a member of the
[1:01:20] police force. We are sons and daughters
[1:01:23] of God. And he's given us authority over
[1:01:27] demons, devils, and all things that are
[1:01:30] evil.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; So the things that are evil can't rule
[1:01:35] and reign over us.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; We're to rule and reign over them.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; And God has given us that power
[1:01:44] and daughters of God.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:01:50] I believe we got to come up higher. I
[1:01:52] believe that this has to be expressed
[1:01:56] in a way that maybe we've never seen
[1:01:58] before.
[1:02:00] I believe that
[1:02:02] that
[1:02:04] the stage is being set
[1:02:07] for us to move forward in this behavior
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; to come with this anointing on us.
[1:02:15] We want the Holy Spirit, don't we? Yes.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it make you feel good when the
[1:02:19] Holy Spirit comes down?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Well, that Holy Spirit might cause
[1:02:23] somebody to lie on you
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; or to come against you. This is
[1:02:28] scripture. That's what happened with
[1:02:29] Jesus. Happened in brother Brandham's
[1:02:31] ministry in his life. We see it
[1:02:34] happening in the life of King David. So,
[1:02:37] he goes up to this great position. Now,
[1:02:39] he's the man of the hour. He's the most
[1:02:41] popular. He's King David. He slew uh the
[1:02:45] giant. took his head off. He got his
[1:02:48] sword.
[1:02:50] Now he's moved up. Now he's a king. He
[1:02:54] he he he first gets a position over
[1:02:58] um the army.
[1:03:00] Saul made him captain over a thousand.
[1:03:03] So look at that. He went from
[1:03:06] taking care of these few little sheep.
[1:03:08] He was anointed. God watched him,
[1:03:10] blessed him. Kills the lion and the
[1:03:13] bear. kills Goliath and now he's captain
[1:03:18] over a thousand people. That's in 1st
[1:03:22] Samuel chapter 18 verses 1 through
[1:03:26] three.
[1:03:27] Yes.
[1:03:30] So he raises up in his position.
[1:03:35] Do you want to stay where you are? Do
[1:03:36] you want to go further in the Lord?
[1:03:40] Want the Lord to take you higher and
[1:03:41] deeper? Here what the prophet says in
[1:03:44] the adoption number two.
[1:03:48] Yeah, I remember writing that to my son.
[1:03:50] Yeah, I remember writing that. Oh, when
[1:03:52] he say when he saw that, he just
[1:03:54] screamed and jumped up and down
[1:03:56] hollering, hallelujah, Lord, take all
[1:03:59] the world out of me. Make me like that.
[1:04:02] Yes, sir. And all those things that he
[1:04:05] done. And the father said, I'm happy for
[1:04:08] that son. That's a fine son. All right.
[1:04:12] Keep an eye on him for a few years and
[1:04:16] see how see how he comes on and how he
[1:04:20] progresses
[1:04:22] after a while. The years pass by. How he
[1:04:26] getting along,
[1:04:30] excuse me, or a few years.
[1:04:34] I can behave for a few services, Lord,
[1:04:37] but a few years.
[1:04:40] When you going to vindicate me? When you
[1:04:42] going to make all my enemies go broke?
[1:04:46] When you going to make their tires go
[1:04:48] flat?
[1:04:50] When you going to vindicate that I'm
[1:04:52] right and they are wrong.
[1:04:55] He says, "Watch him for a few years.
[1:04:58] See if he really has this in him. If
[1:05:00] this character is in him." Really, the
[1:05:03] one you have to rule and reign over is
[1:05:06] you. That's right.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Is your own spirit.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; You know what your weaknesses are more
[1:05:13] than anybody.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints?
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Huh? That means I can write out a list
[1:05:18] what I see in you and you be like,
[1:05:21] "Please, you missed most of it.
[1:05:24] You can come and tell me, brother, this
[1:05:26] this." I'm like, "Man, you just got part
[1:05:28] of the list. I'm much worse than that.
[1:05:33] I know my weaknesses." And the Lord
[1:05:36] knows that you know your weakness is
[1:05:38] called your conscience. You know unless
[1:05:40] you're going to lie to yourself, you
[1:05:42] know what your weaknesses are.
[1:05:45] Excuse me. And you know when you have
[1:05:47] overcome and you're growing
[1:05:50] and I thank the Lord that he has
[1:05:54] growth for the believer
[1:05:57] that you can actually be growing like
[1:06:00] tonight
[1:06:02] like right now
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; like in this prayer meeting
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; like Lord Jesus
[1:06:09] cause some growth to happen in my life
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; that's never happened before. Shoot out
[1:06:16] something in me. A little flower, a
[1:06:18] little bud, a little growth in me
[1:06:22] tonight, Lord.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; That's what our prayer should be.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; That's really focusing on ourselves
[1:06:28] right here. What brother Bham says in
[1:06:30] blasphemous names. I'm going to read
[1:06:32] these last two quotes here. 1962
[1:06:37] in November. And the prophet of God says
[1:06:39] here, paragraph 166. Now, in the Old
[1:06:41] Testament, when that son was adopted or
[1:06:44] placed into the family, his name was
[1:06:46] just as good on the check as his daddy's
[1:06:48] was. They didn't they had a ring in them
[1:06:52] days, a sign, a signate. Brother Banner
[1:06:55] makes a spitting sound and hits the pull
[1:06:57] pit, spit on it, and place it. There was
[1:07:00] a signet. He wore his daddy's ring, his
[1:07:05] signant. And that was just as good as
[1:07:07] his daddy's. Now when Jesus had been
[1:07:10] obedient, Jesus to God, God placed him
[1:07:14] positionally, this is him. Now when the
[1:07:18] member is born by the Holy Ghost into
[1:07:21] the family of God and has proven to have
[1:07:25] these virtues in him that God can see
[1:07:30] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:07:33] brotherly kindness, godliness in him,
[1:07:36] then God seals him or places him. And
[1:07:40] there that's when you see the sons and
[1:07:43] daughters of God.
[1:07:46] Amen.
[1:07:47] Look at paragraph 175. Same message
[1:07:52] says, "But when these things are
[1:07:53] operating in you by God, then you're
[1:07:57] sealed. Then there's no put on about
[1:08:01] it."
[1:08:02] So that's what we want. We want these
[1:08:04] things operating in us.
[1:08:07] Not just today, not just when you get
[1:08:09] called out.
[1:08:11] Not when you just make a big,
[1:08:14] you know, big mistake. We can all see
[1:08:16] it. I make a big mistake and then have
[1:08:19] to come back and make things right.
[1:08:23] But we want growth. And I believe that
[1:08:25] growth is taking place.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Do you?
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; You put the planet in the right
[1:08:30] atmosphere,
[1:08:32] give it the water, give it the sunlight,
[1:08:35] it's going to grow.
[1:08:37] And I believe it is growing.
[1:08:39] I believe you have to believe that what
[1:08:41] you're doing, God is in control of all
[1:08:44] of it.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; You don't know the strength that's in
[1:08:47] you. You don't know when you're going to
[1:08:49] have to face a David, but we sure hope
[1:08:51] you got an experience with the lion and
[1:08:53] the bear somewhere.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Has the Lord did anything for you?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; He has.
[1:09:01] That same God that did that for you, he
[1:09:04] can do more for you,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; even greater battles than you've ever
[1:09:09] faced.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; And um I don't want to I don't want the
[1:09:13] next battle if I'm not ready for it.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; But then I do want the anointing because
[1:09:18] it makes me feel good.
[1:09:21] And I want the anointing because I know
[1:09:22] that's what I need. But I don't, you
[1:09:25] know, but the challenge to deal with
[1:09:26] those wars that lying within me. God
[1:09:30] have mercy upon me.
[1:09:33] Here what the prophet of God says here
[1:09:35] talking about this great gift. Now this
[1:09:37] is way back in the 40s in the beginning
[1:09:39] of his ministry and the Lord is showing
[1:09:42] him putting him on the field of service
[1:09:45] and this is what he says here.
[1:09:49] It's in 1948 paragraph 48. So now shall
[1:09:52] we bow our heads now for prayer? Father,
[1:09:55] realizing that I'd be afraid to step
[1:09:58] into this realm now without you would
[1:10:01] hold my hand. Now, my mind is going back
[1:10:04] to around two years ago when in the room
[1:10:08] that night, the angel of the Lord came
[1:10:10] walking in there and said, "You are been
[1:10:14] born in this world to take a gift of
[1:10:17] divine healing to the people. Many will
[1:10:20] not believe you, yet many will. If
[1:10:25] you'll be sincere and will get the
[1:10:27] people to believe you, not even cancer
[1:10:30] shall stand before your prayer.
[1:10:33] So there's some people not going to many
[1:10:35] people won't believe you. The angel told
[1:10:37] him that many people won't believe you,
[1:10:39] but many will.
[1:10:41] So what should he focus on? Getting the
[1:10:45] people to believe him. You don't focus
[1:10:48] on those that don't believe. You focus
[1:10:50] on those that will believe and nothing
[1:10:52] would stand before your prayer. Not even
[1:10:54] cancer.
[1:10:56] And God revealing himself to his people.
[1:10:58] He says this in 1950.
[1:11:00] He said as a prophet Moses was given two
[1:11:02] signs so will you be given two signs.
[1:11:05] Said first will be that you'll be able
[1:11:08] to detect diseases by your hand taking
[1:11:11] the patient by the right hand in your
[1:11:14] left. And if you'll be sincere when you
[1:11:16] pray and get them to believe you and be
[1:11:19] sincere when you pray, nothing shall
[1:11:22] stand before your prayer, not even
[1:11:24] cancer. See, he spoke cancer. That's the
[1:11:28] only disease he said. And he says, then
[1:11:31] if you'll be sincere with that, it will
[1:11:34] come to pass that you'll you will tell
[1:11:36] them the secrets of their heart. Said
[1:11:39] them will be the two signs. And he said,
[1:11:43] "And I said, I will go." He said, "I'll
[1:11:46] be with you."
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] So the Lord showed him
[1:11:53] about getting the people to believe. Not
[1:11:55] all will, but many will. And if you can
[1:11:59] get them to believe you, believe what?
[1:12:01] Believe that the angel of the Lord came
[1:12:03] to you and gave you this commission. Say
[1:12:06] it. Because that's what the truth of it
[1:12:08] was. Say it. No matter how ridiculous it
[1:12:11] sounds, tell them. And a lot of people
[1:12:13] are not going to believe that. Even to
[1:12:15] today, they won't believe it. But how
[1:12:17] many here believe it?
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I believed it.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Could I please talk for a minute? Just
[1:12:23] because the Lord is really bothering me
[1:12:25] right now.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Could I share a testimony?
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; You have a testimony?
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, please.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; If you don't mind. It's just God's been
[1:12:36] bothering me the whole this whole time
[1:12:38] that I got to share it.
[1:12:41] My name is Ta and I'm here
[1:12:48] tonight and I'm definitely here for a
[1:12:50] reason. Um, this message was definitely
[1:12:54] for me.
[1:12:56] I have been growing a lot the last two
[1:13:00] months with my walk with God and um he's
[1:13:05] been showing me my gifts at work and
[1:13:10] I'm
[1:13:12] walking
[1:13:17] the distance my kids and their husband
[1:13:21] and their husband are becoming um
[1:13:25] the more happier
[1:13:27] I am, um, the more proud I am of myself,
[1:13:32] um, they're becoming more distant.
[1:13:35] They're not, they're not, it's just the
[1:13:38] enemy is definitely using my kids
[1:13:41] against me.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Um, and everything that um, everything
[1:13:47] he's coming full force towards me, but I
[1:13:50] keep going and keep going and keep
[1:13:51] going.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Sunday I was supposed to be
[1:13:55] here with Jonathan. And
[1:13:58] God knows that my heart is my animals. I
[1:14:02] have three dogs and two cats and I just
[1:14:05] love my animals and they've been through
[1:14:07] a lot with me. And um I thought I was
[1:14:11] going to have to put one of my dogs down
[1:14:13] on Sunday. And I was all ready to come
[1:14:16] here to church with Jonathan and
[1:14:18] everything. And
[1:14:21] my de my dog was like almost not
[1:14:24] breathing. So I just I just rebuked the
[1:14:27] devil. I kept praying. And I'm like,
[1:14:29] "Okay, I understand the enemy doesn't
[1:14:31] want me to go to church. My kids didn't
[1:14:33] want me to go to church because they
[1:14:35] even at their church, they were like
[1:14:38] they did they were like they we invited
[1:14:41] them here and they're like, "No, I'm not
[1:14:42] coming." So it was like I everything was
[1:14:44] against me on Sunday.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And um so I stayed. I just loved I I
[1:14:49] read I prayed the Bible. I watched
[1:14:52] Elevation Church with my dog and held
[1:14:54] them and Jonathan said he prayed. It's
[1:14:57] like a it was a miracle
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; straight from God. He's 100% didn't have
[1:15:03] to go and spend any money on vet bills
[1:15:05] or nothing.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And then tonight I was going to come
[1:15:10] here. I woke up this morning and my
[1:15:14] sciatic nerve hurt so bad I couldn't
[1:15:16] walk. I couldn't walk until 4:00 today.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; I I could barely walk.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I was crawling and crying in pain today.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; And I was going to go to urgent care and
[1:15:30] then with my insurance, they wanted a
[1:15:32] co-ayment, so I couldn't afford to do
[1:15:34] that today. I have to go back to work
[1:15:36] tomorrow because it was my day off. I'm
[1:15:38] like, God, you you healed my dog because
[1:15:41] I love him so much. I'm growing in you.
[1:15:44] I'm doing everything and being obedient.
[1:15:46] just tell me. And and he just reminded
[1:15:49] me. He just reminded me to put the armor
[1:15:52] on, the full armor, walk. No weapon
[1:15:55] formed against me will prosper. And just
[1:15:58] keep going and keep going. And until
[1:16:00] 4:00 today, I seriously could barely
[1:16:03] walk.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And he goes, "Do you want to continue to
[1:16:06] grow?" And I said, "Yes, no matter what,
[1:16:08] I will be obedient and continue to
[1:16:10] grow." And I'm here today walking. So
[1:16:13] this message
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; and this is my church.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; He also brought me to this church.
[1:16:19] Praise God. I was looking for a church.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; This is the church he sent me to. So
[1:16:24] this message and everything is a
[1:16:26] confirmation tonight. So I just want
[1:16:27] everyone to know.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Bless you.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Let's give her a hand.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the Lord knows how
[1:16:39] to make the service interesting. Some of
[1:16:41] y'all woke up quickly. So, God bless
[1:16:44] you. Thank you for that. And I was just
[1:16:47] wrapping up on the message here.
[1:16:51] And you know, Brother Brandham had to
[1:16:55] tell the truth about the angel of the
[1:16:57] Lord coming to him. And he told that and
[1:17:00] if you can get the people to believe
[1:17:02] you, be sincere, then these greater
[1:17:05] gifts would be accompanied in your life,
[1:17:07] in your ministry. And we see that and
[1:17:09] that will happen with each of you here
[1:17:11] tonight as well. If you're faithful over
[1:17:14] the little bit that the Lord has given
[1:17:15] you, he will open up so much more for
[1:17:18] you. Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. Thank you. If
[1:17:24] the musicians come, we have a few prayer
[1:17:27] requests here. I think I actually
[1:17:30] brought them out tonight.

[1:22:06] traveling for two weeks.
[1:22:09] The Lord will be with him and watch over
[1:22:11] him. Amen. Is there any other prayer
[1:22:13] requests that we missed tonight?
[1:22:17] We can make that known and we'll keep

[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; I've had I remember the Lord open the
[1:22:34] doors for me to get a job
[1:22:37] and I remember it just so many times. It
[1:22:40] just you can't see it and he just makes
[1:22:43] a way and it just brings a contract your
[1:22:47] way. I've seen him do that so many
[1:22:49] times.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I Sometimes you have so much work as a
[1:22:53] contractor. We have leads and leads and
[1:22:55] then sometimes you just don't have
[1:22:56] anything and the bills are due and every
[1:23:00] time the Lord has always come through
[1:23:02] for me. I've seen him do that over the
[1:23:05] years until I got to the place where my
[1:23:08] faith I know he provides. That's all
[1:23:11] there is to it. He's going to provide.
[1:23:13] And so I can say that for you, Sister
[1:23:14] Heather. The Lord will provide. He's
[1:23:16] already got the job laid out for you.
[1:23:19] Amen. Thank the Lord for that testimony
[1:23:22] from Sister Taylor. Lord, pray the Lord
[1:23:24] will bless her. I fill her with the Holy
[1:23:26] Spirit
[1:23:28] each of us to have another outpouring of
[1:23:30] the Holy Ghost in our lives. Amen. God
[1:23:34] bless you so much. Amen. So, we take
[1:23:38] those requests for a few moments. You
[1:23:40] can pray at your seat. You can come

[1:23:44] you.
