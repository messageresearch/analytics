[3:02] Shepherds to let the Holy Spirit you say
[3:05] well can't the priest be a Shepherd what

[3:36] Christ amen that's
[3:39] right where do we get those things it's
[3:42] a nicadan begin with and formed up into
[3:45] Catholicism now you say well I'm sure

[4:09] ain't if you haven't got the Holy Ghost
[4:12] brother I don't care how many churches
[4:14] you belong to you're
[4:17] lost if you are not born again in the
[4:20] spirit of God by the baptism of the Holy
[4:23] Spirit you're
[4:25] lost because you haven't got eternal
[4:28] life and eternal life is the only thing
[4:30] that God will raise up because it's the
[4:33] only life it's left if a grain of corn
[4:37] as I quoted year at the agriculture hour
[4:40] how many rememb his old brother Spurgeon
[4:42] the Methodist preacher up in Henryville
[4:44] a wonderful old character we were
[4:47] setting at the ice cream fountain at red
[4:49] furnishes one day eating ice cream and
[4:52] we were talking about a meeting that I
[4:54] had up there and the agriculture hour
[4:57] was on and red had the the little
[4:59] speaker turned on and of the of His
[5:02] Radio sitting out there and somewhere
[5:05] they were speaking of course the
[5:07] messages coming from Louisville but the
[5:09] 4 Club had had got a machine that could
[5:12] turn out a grain of corn that they could
[5:15] put the calcium and petroleums and
[5:17] everything into the corn and make it
[5:19] look just exactly like it was made from
[5:22] uh the 4 head it science had perfected
[5:25] it that the corn look so real that you
[5:27] could take a handful out of the sack
[5:28] grow in the field handful out sack
[5:31] machine it turned out and this over here
[5:33] at the machine turn would make the same
[5:35] kind of corn flakes cornbread and
[5:37] actually you could take them down to the
[5:39] laboratory and cut them apart the grains
[5:41] and you couldn't tell one from the other
[5:43] had the same amount of petroleum sound
[5:46] same amount of calcium and and moisture
[5:49] everything that went in one grain it was
[5:51] in the other he said the only definite
[5:54] way to know that which was grow in the
[5:56] field and which was made by the machine
[5:59] big bury both handfuls and they both
[6:02] rotted and the one that was made by
[6:04] Machine would not come up again amen but
[6:07] the one that God
[6:09] growed lived
[6:11] again why because it was not gerti am
[6:17] and you might look like a Christian act
[6:19] like a Christian and do every good deed
[6:21] that you could do and live faithful to
[6:23] your church but unless you are geraedts
[6:29] amen the life of God eternal life coming
[6:32] in you not by confession but by a gift
[6:36] of the Holy Ghost how do you get it the
[6:40] doctor said on the day of Pentecost it
[6:42] wrote the prescription repent and be
[6:45] baptized every one of you in the name of
[6:48] Jesus Christ and you shall receive the
[6:50] gift of the Holy
[6:51] Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost which
[6:54] is eternal life that's the only thing
[6:56] that God will raise up it's the only
[6:58] thing he's got life he can raise up
[7:00] up that's the only thing it can go hope
[7:03] that's clear God grant that it's clear
[7:07] now uh the nians then had the formal
[7:11] sign and they married to the Pagan
[7:14] Church bringing in Pagan altars making
[7:18] Christian altars brought in a pagan God
[7:21] and made it speak and talk in this form
[7:23] of a bishop set up there rob it up and
[7:26] make it look like a god see it's not
[7:30] what's on the outside it's what's on the
[7:32] inside them two grains of corn look the
[7:34] same it wasn't what was on the outside
[7:36] it's what was on the inside the inside
[7:39] the light well it was made there and
[7:42] that was the birthplace of early
[7:44] Catholic Church was the mother of all
[7:46] church
[7:48] denominations now you say well uh
[7:50] brother Brandon then as long as I am
[7:52] Catholic not just one minute let's stop
[7:55] here just a second by the
[7:57] way and let's us turn turn now to
[8:00] Revelation 17th chapter just a
[8:03] minute just turn right straight to it
[8:07] now this is a revelation of what Jesus
[8:10] Christ to his
[8:12] churches as I read listen close and
[8:16] there came one of the Seven Angels which
[8:18] had the seven vials and talked with me
[8:20] saying come here and I will show Thee
[8:23] the Judgment of the great that set
[8:25] up on many Waters now so that I can have
[8:30] a witness how many knows that a woman in
[8:34] the Bible every time that's given an
[8:37] assemble means the
[8:40] church all right how many knows that the
[8:43] great right here in the same
[8:45] chapter is the city that's set on Seven
[8:48] Hills amen all right and now how many
[8:52] knows that the Bible said the waters
[8:55] here she set up on many Waters not a
[8:59] water but
[9:00] Waters and Waters means the people I get
[9:04] the 15th chapter you can see there 15th
[9:06] verse and he said unto me the waters
[9:08] which thou sawest where the hor sth are
[9:10] people multitudes Nations and towns see
[9:13] now this woman was an apostate wasn't
[9:18] she now this is teaching so you must put
[9:21] your conscience behind you now see what
[9:24] is uh that foul woman called is a
[9:28] woman that's untrue to her marriage vow
[9:33] now the church the Catholic Church
[9:35] claims to be the bride and the wife of
[9:38] Christ even the nuns cut off their hair
[9:40] and have no affections they're all
[9:41] affections to Christ is that right sure
[9:44] anybody I come from a Catholic
[9:46] background see I got their facts of our
[9:49] faith and their books and your
[9:50] Protestants and the Baptists and
[9:52] whatever you believe they in my study so
[9:54] I studyed so if anybody says anything
[9:56] whoop I can back you right up to your
[9:57] own say so the hour has come for this to
[10:00] go
[10:02] out now first thing God had to move
[10:05] across the nation showing signs wonders
[10:08] and miracles that the people would know
[10:10] God's sheep knows his
[10:12] [Applause]

[10:16] first you go out without being KNN then
[10:18] you just what do you do you do more harm
[10:20] than ever let it let God take care of
[10:22] that I'll show Thee the Judgment of the
[10:25] great now if she was that then she
[10:28] was a woman professing to be something
[10:31] that she was committing adultery is that
[10:33] right well then if it was a church she
[10:35] was committing adultery against God is
[10:38] that right then adultery be fornications
[10:41] spiritual fornications she's teaching
[10:44] something to the people that it's not
[10:46] God's word amen is that right right
[10:49] she's teaching something that isn't true
[10:51] amen that's the nians amen see it coming
[10:54] here going about putting popes and
[10:57] Priests and taking the Holy Spirit out
[10:59] days of Miracles is passing the Bible

[11:02] forever the Bible said repent be

[11:47] tapes so he carried me away in the
[11:49] spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw I

[13:17] me speaking back here what the first
[13:18] alar was of the nickel see woman being
[13:21] the church having a golden cup in her
[13:26] hand remember the gold overl alter cup
[13:30] she was giving to people full of the
[13:33] abomination of the filthiness of her
[13:36] fornication that's what she's giving the
[13:38] people they were swallowing it sure
[13:41] drunk on it just drunk all that bunch of
[13:45] Irish and French and so forth cut your
[13:47] throat if you say one thing against that
[13:50] church and upon H her forehead was a
[13:54] name written mystery Babylon now where
[13:58] did Babylon mooved
[13:59] from from Babylon up into
[14:04] pergamus and become Satan shifting his
[14:08] seat oh I wish we could go through all
[14:10] Revelations so he could see it Babylon
[14:14] the great the mother of
[14:17] harlots a mother of harlots and
[14:22] Abominations of the
[14:26] earth what was she a mother of har that
[14:30] was his sons was he
[14:33] Church yes sir said isn't a church
[14:36] called in the Bible Babylon see in their
[14:40] own book all right now if she was a
[14:45] prostitute a and she was a mother
[14:48] of harlots she had to have
[14:50] daughters and if they were daughters
[14:52] they were girls they were
[14:55] churches now where did the Protestant
[14:57] Church come from
[15:01] is that right what's the difference
[15:04] between a a and a
[15:06] harlot the same
[15:08] name Martin Luther came out to switch
[15:12] out to give the true church a chance
[15:15] Wesley on into Pentecost and every one
[15:18] of them went right back to that nickel
[15:20] idea amen amen of organizing with
[15:24] General overseers and everything else
[15:27] and went right back with the same
[15:29] baptism that they were baptized with
[15:32] same Farm same ceremonies even many them
[15:35] with catechisms and hail not Hail Marys
[15:38] but U what's this it's about the same
[15:40] thing that Apostles
[15:42] Creed show me the Apostles Creed in the
[15:44] Bible
[15:46] brother if they had a Creed it's acts
[15:50] 238 amen that's what they commanded
[15:52] everybody to do or did you ever hear
[15:55] Apostle make a Creed say I believe in
[15:56] the Holy Roman Catholic Church
[15:59] lead in the communion of saints when the
[16:02] Peter the one that had the key said
[16:04] there's no other mediator between God
[16:06] and man but Christ
[16:09] Jesus but look at the Protestant
[16:11] churches what did they do they couldn't
[16:13] be satisfied each one of them had come
[16:15] out come out with a Pentecostal blessing
[16:18] it's exactly right even Martin Luther
[16:21] spoke in
[16:22] tongues it's exactly
[16:25] right excuse the S saying God these
[16:28] horrible words I'm muttering I don't
[16:29] know what I'm
[16:32] saying sure he believed in it certainly
[16:36] he did now down through the age they've
[16:39] had had the spirit but they always pull
[16:42] away and make organizations they have
[16:44] them first Founders are
[16:47] gone if You' left the Lutheran Church go
[16:49] on and not organized it it' been
[16:51] Pentecostal what is the Pentecostal
[16:53] church I mean the real Pentecostal not
[16:56] the denomination now it's just as uh pot
[16:59] and KD again see but they've done the
[17:02] same
[17:03] thing and I put them right back at the
[17:05] nickel adans just like they did at the
[17:07] beginning how many sees that say
[17:09] amen I just sort I have your word that
[17:12] you see a mother of
[17:16] prostitutes if they're prostitutes how
[17:19] did they become
[17:20] prostitutes by committing fornications
[17:23] amen against the word of God if the word
[17:26] of God said repent be baptized in the
[17:28] name of Jesus Christ and every person in
[17:30] there was baptized in jesus' name and
[17:33] then you take Father Son and Holy Ghost
[17:35] that's prostitution amen amen that right
[17:39] amen and if the Bible of baptizing is by
[17:42] immersing baptizo from the Greek word
[17:45] then how do you get sprinkling and porn
[17:48] amen where does that coming at if you
[17:51] substitute shaking hands or taking a
[17:52] wafer on your lip and swalling or
[17:54] something other like that for the Holy
[17:56] Ghost and the Holy Ghost came from
[17:58] heaven like a russan might he went and
[17:59] filled the people and made him speak in
[18:00] tongues and shout and act like a drunk
[18:02] person and you subtitute shaking hands
[18:05] or put your letter in a church or
[18:06] something like that how are you ever
[18:09] going to get out of the way of
[18:10] committing spiritual fornications
[18:13] amen I just ask yourself that shake your
[18:16] minds down open up your heart and be
[18:19] honest Brethren we're at the end of the
[18:22] road these meetings are just not set
[18:25] here in vain they were ordered of God
[18:27] Amen I believe it is ch you believe me
[18:29] to be his servant I said in the name of
[18:31] Jesus that God placed upon my heart to
[18:35] come here I don't get one penny for
[18:37] doing
[18:39] it I could be out praying for the sick
[18:41] somewhere or something like that or I
[18:44] could be out under uh going fishing and
[18:46] drawing my money just the same I get a
[18:48] salary from the
[18:49] church but God placed it up on my heart
[18:52] I couldn't get away from it just kept
[18:53] crying to me at it and I'm doing all I
[18:56] can I'm here in the name of the Lord
[18:58] everything I know how to do yes don't
[19:01] let it pass you
[19:03] amen now Protestant do you see what I
[19:07] mean by the Catholic and Protestant
[19:09] church just one is just the same as the
[19:12] other it's exactly right now means
[19:17] wedded pergamus means wedded now let's
[19:21] take he said thou has them among you
[19:25] that has the doctrine of balum let's
[19:28] just just take that have we got time
[19:31] I'll hurry just quick as I can or would
[19:33] you rather just wait and see if we can
[19:35] come back in the morning how many just
[19:38] wor to go ahead just a little while
[19:39] longer all right I know it's hot in here
[19:43] if you're sitting still and hot what do
[19:44] you think up here you see but oh my
[19:46] we're trying to get away from that place
[19:48] that is hot that's what it is
[19:52] eternal now of course when they set up a
[19:54] church like that what happened I listen
[19:57] closely my
[19:59] children what
[20:01] happened well of course that took the
[20:04] Holy Ghost right out of the church no
[20:06] wonder another Bishops raised the dead
[20:08] or done the
[20:09] Miracles and them talking about some of
[20:12] these Saints being in their Church they
[20:14] protested the
[20:16] things but they claim them look at Jon
[20:19] of Arc that young
[20:22] girl I ask you Catholic people are you
[20:25] Protestants any of you Jonah Ark and her
[20:28] D wasn't nothing in France there but the
[20:29] Catholic church that smothered the
[20:31] Saints down but God moved upon that girl
[20:34] and she had the Holy Ghost and what did
[20:37] she do she could foretell things the
[20:39] Lord would give her visions and foretell
[20:41] it she prayed for the sick she prayed
[20:45] for a little dead baby and he come back
[20:47] to life again that's Pentecostal amen
[20:50] see and what did the Catholic Church due
[20:52] to her because she protested the
[20:54] Catholic
[20:55] Church they called her a trial and burn
[20:58] her to the stake as a
[21:01] witch and now you say sa
[21:04] jonar 200 years later about when the
[21:07] church found out what they had done as
[21:08] she was a saint oh of course they done
[21:11] repentance part they dug up those
[21:13] priest's body who sanctioned her death
[21:15] and fow him in the
[21:17] river you think that'll ever wash the
[21:20] blood off its hands the Bible said the
[21:23] the blood of every Marty was found in
[21:26] it that's what the angel of the Lord
[21:28] said said was found in Babylon every
[21:31] murder or martyr and all the Saints of
[21:34] Christ that was ever Marty was found
[21:36] right in here from the nickel age on
[21:38] through every Marty think of that thank
[21:41] you brother
[21:43] now thank of that now just a little
[21:47] further

[1:09:44] amen God bless you
[1:09:47] amen so we like to go to the word this
[1:09:49] morning God bless
[1:09:52] you thank you for those songs
[1:09:56] Amen in the New Testament
[1:10:00] scriptures the book right before the
[1:10:03] Book of Revelations the little big book
[1:10:07] called The Book of
[1:10:09] Jude just one
[1:10:11] chapter we have been talking about the
[1:10:15] Great
[1:10:17] Purge and
[1:10:19] um really speaking of Joshua and Caleb
[1:10:23] and the real theme
[1:10:25] of these series of meetings I've been in
[1:10:29] for the last few months was the
[1:10:32] inspiration comes from that prophecy
[1:10:35] that brother bandam gives about Joshua
[1:10:37] and Caleb he said let us stand like them
[1:10:42] so what is he telling us he you know the
[1:10:44] scriptures are written to highlight the
[1:10:48] believer now we talk about the evil
[1:10:50] that's out there because it's
[1:10:51] appropriate to talk about it the word
[1:10:54] tells us to to point those things out
[1:10:57] but it's really all about you know
[1:11:00] Calvary isn't that someone died and
[1:11:03] suffered but why did he die and suffer
[1:11:06] he died and suffered because he loved
[1:11:09] you it was his
[1:11:12] love the great love of God it wasn't
[1:11:15] because he felt sorry for you and he
[1:11:18] just you know felt like doing something
[1:11:20] good for he actually loves you and he's
[1:11:23] concerned about you and when you can
[1:11:26] think about the love of God you be like
[1:11:28] Lord you did that for
[1:11:29] me yes for
[1:11:32] you then then all of this begins to make
[1:11:35] sense then he's not he's not trying to
[1:11:39] catch me and trying to beat me over the
[1:11:41] head and just correct me out he loves me
[1:11:45] that's why he's all in my business
[1:11:48] that's why he's on top of me that's why
[1:11:50] my conscience won't let me do certain
[1:11:53] things because he loves me
[1:11:56] how many thank God for his love this
[1:12:01] morning and the the whole purpose of
[1:12:04] this Joshua and Caleb to highlight let
[1:12:07] me close this door real quick to
[1:12:09] highlight it is
[1:12:13] to really bring out the True Believer
[1:12:17] and how there is no there is no other
[1:12:21] set of human beings like Christians
[1:12:25] people who believe God when they get in
[1:12:27] contact with their maker there's nothing
[1:12:30] greater nothing more tenacious nothing
[1:12:34] more powerful you cannot stop a Believer
[1:12:38] when a Believer has been in contact with
[1:12:41] their
[1:12:43] God you know their home can be parted
[1:12:46] their spouse can leave and families can
[1:12:49] leave but a Believer like
[1:12:51] job job is going to stay with the word
[1:12:55] Hallelujah nothing more tenacious
[1:12:57] nothing more beautiful nothing more is
[1:13:00] drought
[1:13:02] resistant it's tolerant to all kind of
[1:13:05] environments is a True Believer amen and
[1:13:09] that's what the scriptures are
[1:13:10] highlighting that's the purpose of the
[1:13:13] word for us today now Jude takes a
[1:13:17] little bit of time in Jude chapter
[1:13:21] there's only one chapter there and I
[1:13:24] want to read for you starting with
[1:13:28] verse number
[1:13:31] five he
[1:13:34] says I will therefore put you in
[1:13:38] remembrance though you once knew this
[1:13:41] how that the Lord having saved the
[1:13:43] people out of the land of Egypt
[1:13:46] afterwards destroyed them that believe
[1:13:50] not and the angels which kept not their
[1:13:53] first estate but left their own habit
[1:13:55] ation he hath reserved in Everlasting
[1:13:57] chains under Darkness unto the Judgment
[1:14:01] of the great day remember he's reminding
[1:14:05] you even as Sodom and gomorah and the
[1:14:08] cities about them in like manner giving
[1:14:11] themselves over to fornication and going
[1:14:13] after strange flesh are set forth for an
[1:14:17] example suffering the vengence of
[1:14:21] Eternal
[1:14:22] fire likewise also these filthy dreamers
[1:14:27] defile the flesh despise dominion and
[1:14:29] speak evil of dignities Yet Michael the
[1:14:33] Archangel when contending with the devil
[1:14:35] he disputed about the body of Moses
[1:14:38] there not bring a against him a reling
[1:14:40] accusation but said the Lord rebuke
[1:14:43] these but these speak evil of those
[1:14:47] things which they know not but what they
[1:14:50] know naturally as brute B beasts what
[1:14:53] they can prove on the internet whatever
[1:14:56] in those things they corrupt themselves
[1:14:59] woe unto them for they have gone in the
[1:15:02] way of C so he's calling names now and
[1:15:06] it ran greedily after the ER of balum
[1:15:09] for reward and perished in the gangsing
[1:15:13] of Kora these are spots in your feasts
[1:15:16] of Charity when they Feast with you
[1:15:19] feeding themselves without fear clouds
[1:15:23] they are without water water carried
[1:15:25] about of winds trees whose fruit
[1:15:27] withered without fruit twice dead
[1:15:30] plucked up by the roots and it continues
[1:15:33] on
[1:15:34] Raging
[1:15:36] um waves of the sea and these are and he
[1:15:40] he talks about Enoch but look at verse
[1:15:42] 20 says but ye
[1:15:45] beloved building up yourselves on your
[1:15:49] Most Holy
[1:15:50] Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep
[1:15:56] yourselves in the love of God Amen
[1:15:59] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[1:16:03] Christ unto eternal life now isn't that
[1:16:07] nice what a message to you
[1:16:11] beloved amen let us pray Lord Jesus ask
[1:16:15] your blessings on your word this morning
[1:16:19] as you bless every heart that's gathered
[1:16:21] bless the brethren in Mesa this morning
[1:16:24] the stream and those ones that cannot be
[1:16:28] here Lord my dear wife and Levi that are
[1:16:31] traveling remember them and each one
[1:16:35] Lord that's associated with the church
[1:16:37] here may you bless them and help us we
[1:16:41] pray from the youngest one to the oldest
[1:16:44] one today speak to our hearts we ask in
[1:16:47] Jesus name amen God bless you you may be
[1:16:51] seated brother L's nephew is here with
[1:16:54] us for the first time this is Thomas
[1:16:57] he's been with us before and and he's
[1:17:00] brother L's nephew so we welcome him to
[1:17:03] the house of the Lord
[1:17:07] amen and everyone else is welcome as
[1:17:10] well amen so but you beloved it's it's
[1:17:14] beautiful how Jude turns this to you
[1:17:18] belov it he's pointing out all of these
[1:17:22] that did not believe now Jude doesn't
[1:17:25] interesting thing the Lord will help me
[1:17:27] we'll move right forward and and just
[1:17:30] get right to this message and um and
[1:17:34] we'll just stop when we stop okay but
[1:17:38] Judas is um pointing out he he reminds
[1:17:43] them and and as what what he does he
[1:17:45] putting them in remembrance and he
[1:17:48] brings the example with Israel coming
[1:17:51] out of Egypt then he goes beyond the
[1:17:54] curtain were the
[1:17:56] Angels they kept not their first estate
[1:18:00] that's another example so it's Israel in
[1:18:02] Egypt the angels that didn't keep their
[1:18:04] first estate then he brings in Sodom and
[1:18:07] gomorah as an example all the cities
[1:18:10] about them they gave over to all these
[1:18:13] crazy things and then he deals with the
[1:18:17] filthy dreamers and those that are now
[1:18:21] he's speaking of the apostasy so this
[1:18:24] great Purge that we were talking about
[1:18:26] as we talked about Joshua and Caleb and
[1:18:29] how to stand like them or to stand with
[1:18:33] them you got to stand like something you
[1:18:35] got to stand with something and we are
[1:18:38] believers today and we stand with the
[1:18:42] word that's what we are we we're we're
[1:18:46] not contractors we're not Farmers we're
[1:18:48] not this that or the other we're not
[1:18:50] Americans we're not this citizen or that
[1:18:52] one we are believers
[1:18:55] and it's true we are Americans We Are
[1:18:57] Farmers we are contractors but that's
[1:19:00] just secondarily really who you are in
[1:19:04] God is a
[1:19:05] Believer and God has given us an example
[1:19:09] on how to walk and how to live and the
[1:19:11] day that we live in and Jude is bringing
[1:19:15] this out he's highlighting how the
[1:19:17] Angels didn't keep their first estate
[1:19:20] how the Lord delivered Israel and then
[1:19:23] destroyed them afterwards and then Sodom
[1:19:27] and gomorah and then he brings in these
[1:19:32] um ones these filthy
[1:19:35] dreamers as the Apostle Peter and the
[1:19:38] Apostle Paul gives warning of the great
[1:19:41] apostasy to come we spoke about that
[1:19:45] last Sunday the falling away the Sunday
[1:19:49] before that we spoke about gilgal and
[1:19:51] how we needed another circumcision in
[1:19:54] that journey and how men and women we
[1:19:57] can neglect that and it's part of you
[1:20:00] know the Lord reminds us of those things
[1:20:03] and then and under this Great Purge as
[1:20:06] well the first one that we spoke about
[1:20:08] was Jesus making statements that he did
[1:20:12] not explain so that he can knock off all
[1:20:16] the
[1:20:18] parasites that's what that's what the
[1:20:20] prophet called them and so he made
[1:20:22] statements to shake them off and we're
[1:20:24] calling this the Great Purge because
[1:20:27] every believer needs that the tree needs
[1:20:29] it the plant needs it you need it a
[1:20:32] church needs it the people need a
[1:20:35] cleaning of the Dead things in your life
[1:20:39] things get old things get crusty you
[1:20:41] need to renew that you need to you know
[1:20:45] cut things away you need to shave things
[1:20:48] off so you can get lighter and be more
[1:20:52] efficient in your service to the Lord
[1:20:54] and this is why we call it the Great
[1:20:56] Purge and you know this is probably why
[1:21:01] Joshua was so successful it's because of
[1:21:06] the Great Purge that happened now he was
[1:21:10] successful for many reasons and one of
[1:21:14] those reasons is found in Joshua 1
[1:21:17] and8 we spoke about um the prophecy for
[1:21:21] the believer and then how the true
[1:21:23] believers they stand with the word and
[1:21:26] doing so we see the success of Joshua is
[1:21:30] not only because of Joshua 1 and8 that
[1:21:34] the Lord told him to meditate on these
[1:21:36] things day and night and to keep the
[1:21:39] word in your mouth and to observe to do
[1:21:42] them amen then you'll be successful and
[1:21:46] so that's his success came from staying
[1:21:49] with the word day and night keeping the
[1:21:51] word in his mouth meditating on it and
[1:21:55] also the Lord cleaned house for him it
[1:21:59] was a 40-year cleansing it was 40 Years
[1:22:03] of cleaning house took them 40 Years of
[1:22:08] cutting off this one cutting off that
[1:22:10] one so let's look at this time of
[1:22:13] wandering we know that kades barnea was
[1:22:16] a pivotal time for them K kades Baria
[1:22:20] revealed to us who Joshua and Caleb was
[1:22:25] it highlighted them these two brothers
[1:22:28] stood up against not 500 not a th they
[1:22:33] stood up against the entire
[1:22:36] congregation and and and without any
[1:22:39] without any Supernatural vind
[1:22:41] Vindication that the Lord was going to
[1:22:43] bring them out they was willing to go
[1:22:45] For Broke they were willing to give
[1:22:48] their lives and that's what a true
[1:22:50] Revelation does it causes you to take a
[1:22:54] stand without checking out the
[1:22:56] repercussions not checking out if how
[1:22:59] popular it is you said it because it was
[1:23:02] the right thing to say you stood because
[1:23:05] it was the right thing to do you made
[1:23:08] that Proclamation because somebody
[1:23:12] pushed you to take the stand that you
[1:23:15] took and then the Lord May vindicate it
[1:23:18] or you might you might you might have to
[1:23:20] go we don't know you know by faith they
[1:23:23] escaped the edge of the sword and by
[1:23:26] faith they also embrace the sword by
[1:23:30] faith so we see Caleb and Joshua are now
[1:23:34] highlighted they're brought out at kades
[1:23:37] Baria and at kades Baria testing time
[1:23:41] for all of Israel everybody was tested
[1:23:44] those that went those that didn't go
[1:23:47] you're sitting at home in your little
[1:23:49] tent like the other Hebrews and the
[1:23:52] brothers are coming back telling you
[1:23:54] this is what the Lord said this is what
[1:23:56] we saw and you're just a nobody you're
[1:23:59] sitting out there you didn't go you have
[1:24:02] to take the words from these brothers
[1:24:05] and these are main brothers that you
[1:24:07] have to listen to them and you're
[1:24:08] listening very intently what is this
[1:24:10] brother saying what is this brother
[1:24:12] saying and out of the whole group of
[1:24:15] them 10 of them made the same
[1:24:18] Proclamation and there there's two of
[1:24:20] these other
[1:24:22] crazies these two of these others that
[1:24:24] look
[1:24:25] odd that made a proclamation and you're
[1:24:28] a little brother man and you're a little
[1:24:30] sister whoever and you get to hear these
[1:24:33] brothers preach and then you got to make
[1:24:35] a decision
[1:24:38] too think about that they had to make a
[1:24:42] decision it was a Cades barer for
[1:24:45] everybody and we see the stand that was
[1:24:48] made we see the stand that they took and
[1:24:52] now the Lord begins to bless them
[1:24:56] but after the Lord got upset he
[1:24:59] proclaimed to them that you will not
[1:25:03] taste you would not see the land I'm
[1:25:06] going to uh cause you to die off in the
[1:25:10] wilderness for each day you were there
[1:25:13] I'm going to add a year to it so it's 40
[1:25:16] Years of
[1:25:17] wandering because of your unbelief and
[1:25:19] your children will bear your
[1:25:22] iniquity you going to go go around and
[1:25:25] doing your thing whatever you do and I
[1:25:28] am done with you they were
[1:25:31] blessed but
[1:25:34] lost they had the blessing of the Lord
[1:25:37] upon them still but God was done with
[1:25:39] them you know what interesting as you
[1:25:42] take the scripture that the Lord just
[1:25:44] moves right on in numbers 14 is kades
[1:25:47] Baria they make um uh uh um they make
[1:25:51] their Pro they make their stand numbers
[1:25:55] 14:33 and he told them they'll Wonder
[1:25:58] for 40 years and then numbers 15 the
[1:26:00] Lord just goes on with normal
[1:26:02] conversation and telling them how to do
[1:26:05] their sacrifices and
[1:26:07] offerings very interesting study take
[1:26:10] some time and go read it it's like the
[1:26:12] Lord's anger was kindled I'm done with
[1:26:14] you 40 years you're going to go into the
[1:26:16] Wilderness okay now next when you give
[1:26:20] your offering your shiv offering and
[1:26:22] your he offering and your burn offering
[1:26:25] and your drink offering and your
[1:26:28] offerings with fire he begins to explain
[1:26:30] in detail to them all about the
[1:26:32] offerings it didn't stop him one bit he
[1:26:35] moved right on with what he needed to
[1:26:38] tell them and Numbers chapter 17 we see
[1:26:42] the rod of Aaron budding and
[1:26:46] blossoming that the Lord even chose
[1:26:49] Aaron out of all people He commands
[1:26:52] Moses to gather all the rods of the of
[1:26:56] the children the the leaders and the rod
[1:26:59] that I choose I'll do a miraculous sign
[1:27:03] so they put that rod in the sanctuary in
[1:27:05] in the presence of the pillar of fire
[1:27:08] and in 24 hours that Rod of
[1:27:11] Aaron
[1:27:13] bued it brought forth blossoms and a
[1:27:17] bushel of almonds
[1:27:20] overnight and the rod had the member's
[1:27:23] name on the Rod so we knew this was
[1:27:25] Aaron's Rod showing that that God is
[1:27:27] going to choose Aaron through that
[1:27:29] lineage I'm I'm choosing Aaron and he
[1:27:32] made it very clear amen amen now he had
[1:27:35] already declared you're goingon to be
[1:27:37] here for 40 years I brought you to the
[1:27:40] land the Wilderness was necessary but
[1:27:43] this Cades Baria is extra time because
[1:27:46] you disbelieve me and Aaron he chooses
[1:27:50] Numbers chapter 18 he's setting aside
[1:27:54] Aaron's sons Numbers Chapter 19 he's
[1:27:58] introducing the red heer and all of the
[1:28:00] types with that Numbers Chapter 20 our
[1:28:05] dear sister Miriam
[1:28:07] dies we lose one of our great
[1:28:11] matriarchs in the household of faith
[1:28:14] she's got to go it's part of the Great
[1:28:17] Purge not everybody's going to make it
[1:28:20] over there miam has to go Numbers
[1:28:23] chapter 20 Aaron has to go before he
[1:28:26] goes the Lord tells him Moses grab Aaron
[1:28:30] bring him before the congregation strip
[1:28:32] him of all of his Priestly garments he's
[1:28:35] got to go by the way of the
[1:28:37] Grave he's very
[1:28:40] serious so Aaron has to has to go
[1:28:44] Numbers Chapter 20 as well this is where
[1:28:47] we see Moses speaking to the Rock how
[1:28:51] many was here on Wednesday night how
[1:28:54] many you remember that message speak to
[1:28:55] the rock that came out of this is Israel
[1:28:59] while they're wandering now this is
[1:29:02] after Cades barnea this is their 40-year
[1:29:05] period of wondering and the Lord is
[1:29:08] still dealing with them and blessing
[1:29:11] them speak to the Rock Numbers chapter
[1:29:14] 20 verse 24 Aaron will die he won't see
[1:29:19] the land because of what he did at the
[1:29:22] Waters of miraba Numbers chapter 21 they
[1:29:26] there's a king a Canaanite King King Aid
[1:29:30] comes up against Israel now remember
[1:29:33] Israel messed up they they they they
[1:29:35] they went to Cades barer and they said
[1:29:37] we can't do it and the Lord was angry
[1:29:39] with him he says I'm done with you 40
[1:29:42] years I'll leave you alone and here
[1:29:44] there is a here they are a king comes up
[1:29:47] against them and Israel the Bible says
[1:29:50] they vowed a vow Lord if you deliver
[1:29:54] deliver him in into our
[1:29:56] hand we will destroy all of his cities
[1:30:00] and the Bible says the Lord hearken to
[1:30:03] them very interesting I want you to take
[1:30:07] note of
[1:30:08] that the Lord hearkened unto them and
[1:30:13] delivered them they were
[1:30:16] blessed but they were
[1:30:19] lost Numbers chapter 21 veres 5 and
[1:30:24] six the people speak against God and
[1:30:29] Moses familiar familiar they've done it
[1:30:32] before they'll keep doing it he just
[1:30:34] delivered the king of the Canaanites
[1:30:37] into their hands a few verses later
[1:30:39] they're speaking against Moses and God
[1:30:41] again tell me what does this look like
[1:30:45] this is how people are this is how
[1:30:48] church members are just like this they
[1:30:51] can't stay steady but you need to build
[1:30:54] yourself up on your Most Holy
[1:30:58] Faith not some carnal Faith but your
[1:31:00] Most Holy Faith you're a Believer my
[1:31:06] sister brother you're a
[1:31:10] Believer God called you to the highest
[1:31:14] calling we can't walk around here all
[1:31:18] discouraged all the time we can't walk
[1:31:21] around complaining all the time always
[1:31:24] upset always offended you're a
[1:31:27] Believer you're not a chicken you're an
[1:31:31] eagle flap your wings come out of it
[1:31:35] snap out of it you're a
[1:31:39] Believer amen by the grace of
[1:31:47] God you know what Calvary means you know
[1:31:51] the price that was paid you experienced
[1:31:53] it how many you know what I'm talking
[1:31:56] about you you're going to come out of it
[1:31:59] how do I know you going to come out I
[1:32:00] know you're going to come out of it
[1:32:02] because you're a
[1:32:03] Believer
[1:32:05] yes
[1:32:06] yes can I get a positive testimony here
[1:32:09] this
[1:32:10] morning uh what I'm going through I'm
[1:32:12] coming out of it God's going to bring me
[1:32:15] out of this I can't stay like this God
[1:32:19] is going to raise me out of this because
[1:32:23] I am a
[1:32:25] Believer
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:31] amen we have our bad days we have our
[1:32:33] discouraged moments We Fall Down but
[1:32:36] guess what we get back up again and we
[1:32:39] get back up again and we get back up
[1:32:42] again we keep getting up keep getting up
[1:32:47] keep getting up cuz I'm a
[1:32:50] Believer praise the
[1:32:52] Lord amen
[1:32:58] so he blessed
[1:33:00] them delivered them and then they spoke
[1:33:03] against him when he spoke against God he
[1:33:06] tells them to raise up a brass
[1:33:10] serpent this brass serpent now many
[1:33:13] people died and the Lord gives Divine
[1:33:20] Healing as part of their blessing
[1:33:24] if you look you live you talk about
[1:33:27] God's
[1:33:28] grace these are people who denied him on
[1:33:31] every level criticize him on every level
[1:33:35] and as soon as he gets sick he calls on
[1:33:39] God and God still heals him heals
[1:33:45] her what a mighty God we
[1:33:49] serve yes it's not by works it can't be
[1:33:51] by your works there is no works that you
[1:33:54] can work to get good enough but it is by
[1:33:58] his grace by his
[1:34:01] grace and his
[1:34:03] Mercy that he is shown to
[1:34:06] me amen and so the brass serpent we see
[1:34:09] that as St John chapter 3 as Moses
[1:34:13] lifted up the brass serpent so must the
[1:34:16] son of man be lifted up all these types
[1:34:19] through the scriptures that are being
[1:34:20] brought out while they are wandering
[1:34:24] another king comes against
[1:34:27] them in numbers 21 and the Lord delivers
[1:34:30] the amorites and gives them the victory
[1:34:33] over all these cities then in Numbers 22
[1:34:37] we see this famous Prophet balam brother
[1:34:41] brandom said he had a true anointing one
[1:34:44] place he said he had a genuine anointing
[1:34:47] in another place he said he had the same
[1:34:50] anointing that Moses had upon on him
[1:34:54] this is balum he was gifted but his gift
[1:34:57] had a price tag on it and the influence
[1:35:01] of other men now remember balum made the
[1:35:04] right decision in the beginning but deep
[1:35:07] in his heart the prophet said he didn't
[1:35:09] really like those people anyways and the
[1:35:12] Lord knew in his heart he didn't like
[1:35:14] them so he tested them and just gave him
[1:35:16] another opportunity you said no but what
[1:35:19] if I give you a position you said no but
[1:35:21] what if we change you said no but and
[1:35:23] instead of staying with the original he
[1:35:25] got playing around and
[1:35:29] found the permissive will of God instead
[1:35:33] of the perfect will it's under this
[1:35:35] great understanding I'm not sure how
[1:35:38] many churches have this truth that the
[1:35:42] prophet brought out to us he said that
[1:35:45] that this is God's Will and man's will
[1:35:48] he's talking about the perfect will and
[1:35:50] the permissive will and how we can walk
[1:35:53] in his permissive will and God will
[1:35:56] permit you to do things but it's still
[1:35:59] not his perfect will how many of us are
[1:36:03] interested in his perfect
[1:36:06] will that's what we want his perfect
[1:36:10] will but it's a beautiful teaching
[1:36:12] lesson on how his permissive will can
[1:36:16] slide around and work around his perfect
[1:36:18] will my mother was a woman Pastor she
[1:36:22] did a good job as a raising us and she
[1:36:24] did a good job she was okay with
[1:36:27] preaching I guess and but she had a
[1:36:30] beautiful way of prayer she would come
[1:36:33] sing when she prays and sometimes when
[1:36:35] I'm really praying by myself I pray like
[1:36:38] my mama prays I can't get away from it
[1:36:41] okay and she was anointed and God used
[1:36:44] her and God blessed her and I will never
[1:36:46] take that away from my mother I believe
[1:36:49] I'll see her again but it was under the
[1:36:51] permissive will God perfect will is that
[1:36:55] I suffer not a woman to teach her Ur
[1:36:57] authority over a man that's a perfect
[1:37:00] will Amy simple
[1:37:02] mcferson wonderful women preacher
[1:37:05] wonderful gifting calling there in
[1:37:07] California tremendous Ministry helped
[1:37:10] hundreds and thousands of people her
[1:37:13] Ministry brought healing to many people
[1:37:16] but it was the permissive will how could
[1:37:18] this be because these these Dynamics
[1:37:21] work and because of the message it
[1:37:23] brings us these truths that even though
[1:37:26] a man is gifted or talented even though
[1:37:29] miracles signs and wonders will follow
[1:37:31] him you still have to get the okay from
[1:37:35] the word what did God's word say about
[1:37:38] it now that's a beautiful discipline
[1:37:40] that we all exercise because we're in
[1:37:42] the message but how many Pentecostal how
[1:37:45] many churches out there follow people
[1:37:47] just because they're gifted or
[1:37:50] talented but we know you got do more
[1:37:53] than have a gift you got to do more than
[1:37:57] heal the sick or have a talent you got
[1:37:59] to do more than just preach you got to
[1:38:01] live the life and then what did the word
[1:38:04] say about whatever you're trying to do
[1:38:08] amen
[1:38:09] someone so these are the wanderings of
[1:38:11] Israel so kades
[1:38:14] Baria they get thrown back 40 years into
[1:38:17] the
[1:38:18] Wilderness
[1:38:21] and balam appears
[1:38:25] now this blessed but being
[1:38:30] lost is how the prophet puts it here in
[1:38:34] this message can I read for
[1:38:37] you here what he
[1:38:40] says
[1:38:42] in the message turning
[1:38:45] northward paragraph number 33 just above
[1:38:49] paragraph number 33 they stayed on the
[1:38:51] mountain 40 years we stayed in our
[1:38:53] denominations 40 years fussing this way
[1:38:56] and that way you ever think what them
[1:38:58] people done out there for 40 years well
[1:39:01] sure God was with them he's been with us
[1:39:05] they've been out there 40 years and they
[1:39:07] raised children God prospered them had
[1:39:12] good crops they done a lot of good out
[1:39:14] there God blessed them and healed their
[1:39:17] sickness there wasn't a feeble one among
[1:39:19] them when they come out of the
[1:39:21] Wilderness but he let them stay right
[1:39:23] there till that old bunch of Fighters
[1:39:25] all died out that's just exactly what
[1:39:29] he's done today set us right down join
[1:39:31] the assemblies join the Church of God
[1:39:33] join this join that join join join oh
[1:39:36] until we sit here and raise children and
[1:39:40] bought Cadillacs and prospered in
[1:39:43] business and everything
[1:39:45] else you got any Cadillacs out
[1:39:49] there I like a good Cadillac they're
[1:39:52] nice but at the end of the 40 years it's
[1:39:54] up brother there's a new generation been
[1:39:57] raised up that's right there was a
[1:39:59] Joshua raised up one day he absolutely
[1:40:03] believed God's word every bit of the
[1:40:06] promise not only to take care of you and
[1:40:09] bless your business and so forth but
[1:40:11] there's more of it than that God's done
[1:40:16] the same thing today amen look at what
[1:40:20] he says in church choosing law for Grace
[1:40:24] hope we're not leaving these quotes out
[1:40:26] to the Pentecostals back there hope we
[1:40:28] look down right here did you ever think
[1:40:31] what they done oh God blessed them
[1:40:34] didn't he he said he did he they raised
[1:40:37] good crops they had good families they
[1:40:40] stayed there they were blessed and
[1:40:42] prospered why some of the Pentecostals
[1:40:44] are boys some of them why worth millions
[1:40:47] of dollars a lot of them sure God has
[1:40:52] prospered
[1:40:54] us I want you to think about this for a
[1:40:58] minute have you ever
[1:41:01] seen a Mormon
[1:41:04] church in a strip
[1:41:08] mall or like on the corner in the hood
[1:41:13] somewhere barely can pay their rent
[1:41:16] Windows broken out have you ever seen a
[1:41:19] Jehovah Witness
[1:41:20] church in the hood like that like you
[1:41:23] know like a storefront they don't make
[1:41:25] them do they no and and and it's almost
[1:41:30] it's almost like us in the message too
[1:41:33] how many storefront message churches do
[1:41:36] we know about in the
[1:41:39] US very few we used to be one so I can
[1:41:44] talk about
[1:41:47] them don't remember where y all remember
[1:41:50] where you came from now people hanging
[1:41:53] on the Windows stealing our air
[1:41:55] conditioning breaking into our
[1:41:57] cars need a flashlight at
[1:42:01] night but God has blessed the message
[1:42:05] people most of the message people after
[1:42:08] a generation or two you should have a
[1:42:10] few families like in this city if it
[1:42:13] started with 20 after 20 years there
[1:42:15] should be more than 20 families here
[1:42:17] wouldn't you say just by marriage and
[1:42:20] you know marriage and having kids it's
[1:42:22] going to grow and these are good people
[1:42:24] they pay their tithes they pay their
[1:42:26] bills they go to work they and they're
[1:42:28] blessed and they have the finest cars
[1:42:31] very few of us have to walk to
[1:42:36] church and if we
[1:42:38] did I would get a Tex say I ain't going
[1:42:40] to make it this
[1:42:42] week because my car is in the
[1:42:45] shop go catch the bus the bus what do
[1:42:49] you mean the
[1:42:50] bus the bus is for them
[1:42:53] y'all don't look at me like that I know
[1:42:55] who I'm talking to
[1:42:57] yes but the Lord has prospered us hasn't
[1:43:03] he what y'all gonna eat
[1:43:06] today let me think is chicken or steak
[1:43:09] shrimp or what what am we going to eat
[1:43:11] today oh I feel like well let see what I
[1:43:13] feel like you know many people don't
[1:43:16] have the option of what I feel like eat
[1:43:18] it's like you got to go eat what is
[1:43:20] available to eat
[1:43:23] and it used to be many of us have come
[1:43:26] through that many of our fathers or
[1:43:29] grandfathers come through
[1:43:32] that where going out to eat was a
[1:43:36] privilege huh but God has blessed
[1:43:40] us and we've been blessed
[1:43:43] financially we've been blessed
[1:43:47] physically we have we have health care
[1:43:52] we have access to clean drinking
[1:43:56] water we have air conditioning and
[1:43:58] electricity like 24 hours a day many
[1:44:02] parts of the of the world they have
[1:44:05] electricity for certain windows so many
[1:44:07] hours in the day how many know that's
[1:44:09] true oh my yes God has blessed us and
[1:44:14] prospered us and sometimes these
[1:44:18] blessings can blind us to the reality A
[1:44:22] a am I
[1:44:23] am I
[1:44:25] circumcised am I in the promised land am
[1:44:29] I actually getting the inheritance that
[1:44:31] God has for me and so these questions
[1:44:35] arise because of his love towards you
[1:44:38] the prophet of God continues in God's
[1:44:40] power to
[1:44:41] transform he says this paragraph
[1:44:45] number8 there's a line you can cross you
[1:44:47] know that now ministers both here and
[1:44:50] out in the telephone land where this
[1:44:52] broadcast is coming across Across the
[1:44:53] Nation do you realize that when you see
[1:44:56] it in the scriptures you won't do it God
[1:44:59] won't always oh you go on be blessed so
[1:45:04] was everyone of Israel they live right
[1:45:06] in the wilderness raised children crops
[1:45:10] and blessed in everything but every one
[1:45:14] of them eternally separated from God
[1:45:17] Jesus said so oh yes God will bless you
[1:45:21] right on but you're gone
[1:45:24] certainly that's what the Bible says now
[1:45:27] that's what he said notice you can cross
[1:45:30] a separating
[1:45:32] [Music]
[1:45:34] line let's go a little bit further here
[1:45:38] now so Jude is picking
[1:45:42] this he's picking up these brothers Kora
[1:45:48] Cain and
[1:45:51] Dayan and he is
[1:45:55] highlighting what they did and so going
[1:45:58] back to cor just for a moment what did
[1:46:01] Kora do Kora rose up in
[1:46:09] Numbers
[1:46:13] Chapter let me get the scripture here
[1:46:15] for
[1:46:20] you it's right after numbers 14 there
[1:46:27] I would ask you to find it for me
[1:46:29] but who said
[1:46:32] it numbers 33 let's try that
[1:46:36] sis Numbers Chapter 14 that sounds right
[1:46:41] thank you
[1:46:49] sis yes
[1:46:56] let's see here number 16 num numbers 14
[1:47:00] is bringing in Kora but here number 16
[1:47:02] is what I was looking for thank you now
[1:47:05] Kora the son of isar the son of Kath the
[1:47:08] son of Levi and Dayan and abam the sons
[1:47:13] of elab and an the son of pth Sons of
[1:47:17] Ruben took men
[1:47:23] and they rose up before Moses with
[1:47:25] certain of the children of Israel
[1:47:28] 250 princes of the
[1:47:32] assembly famous in the congregation men
[1:47:36] of
[1:47:37] renown and they gathered themselves
[1:47:40] together against Moses and against Aaron
[1:47:43] and said unto them you take too much
[1:47:46] upon you seeing all the congregation Are
[1:47:51] Holy everyone of them and the Lord is
[1:47:54] among them wherefore then lift ye up
[1:47:59] yourselves above the congregation of the
[1:48:02] Lord now who is speaking here this is
[1:48:06] Kora Kora is the son of kohath he's a
[1:48:12] kohathite which also Moses is too
[1:48:15] interestingly enough Moses Aaron Miriam
[1:48:19] and Kora come out of the same lineage
[1:48:22] under
[1:48:23] Levi one of Levi's son under the
[1:48:27] coites and so this is Moses's first
[1:48:31] cousin he rises up against um Moses he
[1:48:35] grabs a group of Brethren with him and
[1:48:39] they were renowned men these are men
[1:48:42] amongst men and spoke against Moses and
[1:48:46] this is what they said to Moses they
[1:48:48] didn't have a problem with the pillar of
[1:48:51] fire they didn't have a problem with the
[1:48:54] signs wonders and miracles they didn't
[1:48:57] have a problem with the Vindication and
[1:48:59] the anointing that followed Moses's
[1:49:03] Ministry they had a problem with
[1:49:09] Moses and the problem that they had was
[1:49:13] that he's taking too much upon
[1:49:17] himself like you're the only you're the
[1:49:20] only important one Among Us
[1:49:23] I mean you put your pants on the same
[1:49:25] way we
[1:49:27] do you're just a brother just like
[1:49:29] anybody
[1:49:30] else why are you taking so much upon
[1:49:35] yourselves this is what this is this is
[1:49:38] what the problem that they had with
[1:49:40] Moses this arose up in Israel and the
[1:49:45] influence is coming great now remember
[1:49:47] they're under the wandering stage they
[1:49:49] 40 years of this we're going to be here
[1:49:51] for a minute for 40 years and here cor
[1:49:55] Rises up not not King Canaanites not the
[1:49:59] king from any other Nation it was my
[1:50:03] first
[1:50:04] cousin he rose up famous in the
[1:50:08] congregation and he tells Moses you put
[1:50:11] too much on
[1:50:12] yourself now if you know me and if
[1:50:16] you've been around a little bit you know
[1:50:17] how I you know I jab a little bit okay
[1:50:20] and I kind of tease a little bit all
[1:50:22] right
[1:50:23] it's either that or maybe I would lose
[1:50:25] my mind I don't know but I I'm you all
[1:50:29] know my you know I'm it's in the right
[1:50:31] spirit I sure hope so I trust you
[1:50:33] receive it that way amen and every now
[1:50:36] and then like last week I'll drop out
[1:50:39] there about the visions that people have
[1:50:41] a problem with you know I talk about the
[1:50:44] tent vision and I I bring up you know
[1:50:47] the white horse rider whatever it is the
[1:50:49] the third pool that people you see seems
[1:50:52] to have a an issue with and I do that on
[1:50:55] purpose not because I'm trying to lean
[1:50:57] one way or the other but what it is
[1:50:59] what's interesting to me is that people
[1:51:03] have a
[1:51:04] problem with statements that the prophet
[1:51:08] made and this is where this is what this
[1:51:12] is what I you know I kind of I I I I
[1:51:15] mess around a little bit it seems like I
[1:51:17] don't mean no harm but it's it's a valid
[1:51:20] it's a valid PR
[1:51:23] I mean I'm only mentioning a quote of
[1:51:26] the Prophet I'm not saying it's going to
[1:51:28] be this way or that way but to see the
[1:51:31] contortions on people in their Spirit
[1:51:33] when you bring up something that they're
[1:51:36] they're so dead set that you believe
[1:51:38] this or they believe that and they they
[1:51:40] won't even come around what the word
[1:51:43] said about it and be in agreement with
[1:51:46] that and so the reason is it's really
[1:51:50] it's really not whether he said a white
[1:51:54] horse or a blue horse it really don't
[1:51:56] matter what matters is what did he
[1:51:59] say that's the point that I try to get
[1:52:02] across is it in the Bible if it's in the
[1:52:06] Bible I am a believer in all of the
[1:52:11] Bible I'm not ashamed of any of it so
[1:52:15] there's no scripture I want to take out
[1:52:17] or no chapter I don't want to talk about
[1:52:19] it's all there The Good The Bad the
[1:52:22] stuff against me the stuff for me is
[1:52:25] it's in the Bible I'm with
[1:52:30] it and that's my attitude towards the
[1:52:32] message
[1:52:34] too and and these brothers here Kora
[1:52:40] specifically was not only a first cousin
[1:52:44] to Moses not only were they from the
[1:52:46] lineage of Levi remember Abraham Isaac
[1:52:51] Jacob Levi and Levi was given credit for
[1:52:54] paying tithes in the loin of his great
[1:52:56] great grandfather and under the same
[1:52:59] lineage was
[1:53:01] Kora was
[1:53:03] Moses was
[1:53:05] Aaron was Miriam as well they're under
[1:53:09] the same
[1:53:12] lineage what
[1:53:15] else the kohathites the gites and the
[1:53:21] muries were All Sons of Levi under the
[1:53:26] levitical order these were his sons and
[1:53:29] the Lord called them and separated them
[1:53:32] and made Levi his
[1:53:37] firstborn is that right Saints yes we
[1:53:40] brought it before you before it's in the
[1:53:41] scripture Levi shall be my first born
[1:53:44] and then so he gives them all specific
[1:53:48] duties the coites they were to to um
[1:53:54] they were to um to Camp their tent on
[1:53:58] the South Side I believe me get it here
[1:54:01] for
[1:54:02] you they were camped on the south the
[1:54:06] gersam and his family were camped in the
[1:54:08] west mirria Miri and his family were
[1:54:12] camped in the north his sons were camped
[1:54:15] in the north on the four sides of the
[1:54:17] Tabernacle and on the east side was
[1:54:20] Moses and Aaron that's the way they were
[1:54:23] structured and camped and each of these
[1:54:26] sons of
[1:54:28] Levi were given the duties and the
[1:54:32] instructions to
[1:54:34] handle
[1:54:36] the Tabernacle how we're going to move
[1:54:39] it because they had a lot of moving the
[1:54:41] tents the poles the the rods it wasn't
[1:54:45] just anybody get up and move it hey
[1:54:47] y'all let's get out of here can you help
[1:54:49] me today no it it was specific people
[1:54:52] that were given the order of moving this
[1:54:55] Tabernacle some of the stuff can be
[1:54:57] moved with the ox
[1:54:59] cart go God told Moses set up an oxcart
[1:55:03] the tents and all the poles and
[1:55:05] everything that's how these brothers are
[1:55:07] going to move this over here and these
[1:55:08] other ones are in charge of the curtains
[1:55:11] and the things that hang but but the
[1:55:14] coites are in charge of the most holy
[1:55:19] things they were in charge of the table
[1:55:22] of
[1:55:23] showbread the Ark of the Covenant the
[1:55:27] lampstands and everything that was in
[1:55:30] the mo the closest to where the
[1:55:33] anointing would come down in the holiest
[1:55:36] of holies these brothers were in charge
[1:55:38] of
[1:55:39] that this is their
[1:55:42] position and they couldn't move and go
[1:55:44] help the other Levites do their duties
[1:55:48] they all had their specific duties it
[1:55:50] was death if they did so read the
[1:55:52] scripture there in numbers he brings it
[1:55:54] out beautifully let me give you a few
[1:55:56] scriptures here numbers um chapter 4
[1:56:01] veres
[1:56:03] 4-4 details
[1:56:06] this Numbers chapter
[1:56:09] 10 vers 21 I want you to read that and
[1:56:13] really internalize what it
[1:56:15] means 1 Chronicles chapter 9 for those
[1:56:19] of you that take notes go back and read
[1:56:22] this and how this order was established
[1:56:25] and God is a god of
[1:56:27] order yes he is absolutely the message
[1:56:31] came in a order the message came in a
[1:56:35] pools series of them first pool second
[1:56:39] pool third pool the the our our life is
[1:56:43] written out in ages and stages every
[1:56:46] seven years and then when you're 14 and
[1:56:50] then when you're 21 your life is written
[1:56:52] like that in stages and God built the
[1:56:54] universe in stages there's an order to
[1:56:57] it creation was built in stages there's
[1:57:00] an order to it and in the Tabernacle
[1:57:03] when Moses built this Tabernacle it was
[1:57:06] after the pattern that he saw In
[1:57:11] Heaven There is an order to it now tell
[1:57:14] me does God have a hand over your life
[1:57:18] if God has a hand over your life then
[1:57:21] there is a order to your
[1:57:25] life and somebody's in control of your
[1:57:28] life somebody is ordering your steps the
[1:57:32] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:57:36] by the
[1:57:37] Lord every step every place every test
[1:57:41] every trial every
[1:57:44] setback every
[1:57:46] discouragement is
[1:57:51] ordered can I get a witness here this
[1:57:53] morning
[1:57:55] yes so we see
[1:57:59] this number seven also brings in the
[1:58:03] mirites they had the four carts for The
[1:58:07] Oxen and you can see why David in doing
[1:58:10] God's service how maybe he he thought we
[1:58:13] can just get anybody to bring the ark so
[1:58:15] they went and got the ark and they threw
[1:58:17] it on a new cart well they it's okay to
[1:58:20] move other instruments on on a cart but
[1:58:23] this right here is the most holy thing
[1:58:28] and this has to be
[1:58:31] specifically carried on the
[1:58:35] shoulders of
[1:58:38] Brothers can I get a scripture there
[1:58:41] let's take Numbers Chapter
[1:58:45] 4 quickly
[1:58:56] I think that's what I
[1:59:16] want verses number one the Lord spake
[1:59:18] unto Moses Aaron saying take of the sum
[1:59:21] of the sons of coath from among the sons
[1:59:23] of Levi after their families by the
[1:59:27] house of their fathers 30 years old and
[1:59:31] upward even up to 50 years old enter
[1:59:33] into the ho host to do the work in the
[1:59:36] Tabernacle of the congregation this
[1:59:38] shall be the service of the sons of Kath
[1:59:41] in the Tabernacle of the congregation
[1:59:43] about the most holy
[1:59:48] things and so we see this is is bringing
[1:59:53] um this these are the most holy
[1:59:58] things look at number seven
[2:00:13] quickly verse six and Moses took the
[2:00:16] wagons and the oxin and gave them unto
[2:00:18] the Levites two wagons and four oxen he
[2:00:21] gave them to the sons of gersam
[2:00:23] according to their service four wagons
[2:00:25] eight ox and he gave Unto the Sons of
[2:00:29] myi marari I think I'm saying that right
[2:00:32] marari according unto their service
[2:00:35] under the hand of ithamar the son of
[2:00:38] Aaron the priest but Unto the Sons of
[2:00:41] Kath he gave none because the service of
[2:00:45] the sanctuary belonging unto them was
[2:00:49] that they should bear upon their
[2:00:53] shoulders we need some men we don't need
[2:00:56] a cart we don't need an oxen we need a
[2:01:00] shoulder we need your
[2:01:03] shoulder to bear this and you'll know
[2:01:06] you're carrying something and this is
[2:01:09] not just in any time or any day you just
[2:01:11] feel like it no you got to move you got
[2:01:14] to go get your shoulder ready so I you
[2:01:17] know I stayed up late last night I I
[2:01:19] don't know if I'm going to make it what
[2:01:21] what if the the sun said it didn't know
[2:01:23] if it was going to make
[2:01:25] it but the sun was put in direct order
[2:01:28] by his great Creator the Su win and he
[2:01:32] set in order perfectly at his post of
[2:01:35] Duty when at all
[2:01:39] times what about a s o n of
[2:01:43] God is he in order at some time or maybe
[2:01:46] time or halftime or part-time no it's at
[2:01:49] all time
[2:01:52] the Bible says you always be ready to
[2:01:54] give an answer you're a Believer you
[2:01:56] know even when you don't feel like it
[2:01:59] did you know you're still a Believer
[2:02:00] even when you're down on the
[2:02:02] ground that you're not less a Believer
[2:02:05] or more of a Believer you're just a
[2:02:07] believer but you're going to get up
[2:02:09] again aren't you because you're a
[2:02:11] Believer it's not a part-time
[2:02:15] position you're a believer
[2:02:21] and these are the
[2:02:24] sons of Levi so they had a
[2:02:29] tremendous uh calling there were the
[2:02:34] anointing was with them Lord had the
[2:02:36] Lord had placed them through their birth
[2:02:40] through their calling in life who they
[2:02:42] were and they were uh these are the ones
[2:02:46] that's giving Moses this
[2:02:49] problem he rose up against against them
[2:02:53] and told him do you take it all upon
[2:02:59] yourself aren't the whole congregation
[2:03:04] holy do those Spirits die are they still
[2:03:07] here
[2:03:07] today oh yeah they're still
[2:03:11] here Brothers we came to your church you
[2:03:14] mentioned brother brandham 10 times and
[2:03:16] you mentioned Jesus eight
[2:03:19] times did you say Amen
[2:03:24] anytime that would be my question to
[2:03:27] you did you take any notes
[2:03:31] down you know if you come in the right
[2:03:34] spirit in the right
[2:03:35] attitude you will receive whatever
[2:03:39] you're expecting I I like something
[2:03:42] brother globber said on Sunday night he
[2:03:44] said the prophet
[2:03:47] introduce this spiritual principle that
[2:03:51] you get what you expect I like
[2:03:54] that it's a spiritual principle that you
[2:03:57] actually get what you
[2:04:06] expect I love it I took that down I had
[2:04:09] to text I said I like that one yes it's
[2:04:12] a principle that he introduced to us you
[2:04:15] always get what you expect so let's deal
[2:04:19] with this Dayan and cor just for a
[2:04:21] moment moment the prophet picks it up
[2:04:25] and in the message why it had to be
[2:04:27] Shepherds he makes this statement
[2:04:30] here God bless you so
[2:04:33] much paragraph 153 now is they complain
[2:04:36] about God's provided way was the reason
[2:04:39] they
[2:04:40] died now closely don't miss these last
[2:04:43] few remarks they complain what made them
[2:04:46] die in the wilderness they complained
[2:04:49] about God's provided way by a Onan
[2:04:53] message a prophet a leadership of one
[2:04:58] man tell me when God ever use a group to
[2:05:01] lead you won't find it in the Bible one
[2:05:04] man the word came to Moses cor we all
[2:05:09] know that he got himself together and
[2:05:11] complained about God not being just to
[2:05:13] do a thing like that to make one man
[2:05:16] with the message he says we're all holy
[2:05:19] why can't we have a denomination why
[2:05:22] can't we have set up this and do this
[2:05:24] and do that God told Moses separate
[2:05:27] yourself from him I had enough of it and
[2:05:30] remember Jews speaks the same thing in
[2:05:32] the last days they perish in the gain
[2:05:36] saying of Kora look that word gain
[2:05:39] saying up and that word gain saying it
[2:05:42] it's used a couple of times in the Bible
[2:05:46] it is used as the
[2:05:49] contradiction it's also the same word as
[2:05:52] opposition and I believe it's in it's
[2:05:54] also used as Strife a couple of times
[2:05:58] but the main use for it was
[2:06:01] Rebellion many of the new translations
[2:06:03] translate that gain saying as
[2:06:07] Rebellion they rebelled against Moses he
[2:06:11] says God said separate yourself from
[2:06:14] from him I've had enough of it remember
[2:06:16] Jude speaks the same thing in the last
[2:06:19] days they perished in the game saying of
[2:06:22] Kora we also know what happened to Kora
[2:06:26] and the rest that question God's word
[2:06:29] and God's wisdom of that
[2:06:33] Onan leadership every one of them
[2:06:36] perished now we will notice God and the
[2:06:39] shepherd Prophet showing his future
[2:06:42] plans in the next sign voice now watch
[2:06:45] we see it there now let's watch it in
[2:06:47] the next
[2:06:49] sign notice he was sent to his brethren
[2:06:52] in slavery under bondage with the
[2:06:55] message of Deliverance with a god-given
[2:06:58] sign to prove his claims Israel went for
[2:07:02] his message they believed it every one
[2:07:05] of them but in the evening time they
[2:07:08] went for his miracles but in the evening
[2:07:11] time when they he gave his message it
[2:07:15] was
[2:07:16] different all that did not believe that
[2:07:19] message died that's that's right what
[2:07:22] was the message the message was of the
[2:07:24] coming Judgment at the evening at the
[2:07:26] evening time God went out through the
[2:07:28] camp of Israel to find if the people
[2:07:30] have believed a Shepherd prophet's
[2:07:33] message and all had not believed it
[2:07:38] perished oh my how many can say praise
[2:07:40] the Lord prophet of God continues in the
[2:07:43] message who do you say this is paragraph
[2:07:47] 128
[2:07:52] oh
[2:07:53] my how many love the Lord
[2:07:55] today
[2:07:57] yes now the question come up in the
[2:07:59] wilderness here's where it brings see
[2:08:02] now I want you to watch my brethren now
[2:08:05] remember these people enjoyed them
[2:08:07] blessings they enjoyed the preaching of
[2:08:10] this Prophet this anointed one they
[2:08:12] believed him they followed him but there
[2:08:15] rose up in the wilderness one by the
[2:08:18] name of Dayan one by the name of Cor and
[2:08:22] they said this has got to be a Onan
[2:08:25] Affair Moses thinks he's the only one
[2:08:29] God's called that one man message they
[2:08:33] didn't want it no they didn't want it
[2:08:36] and God never did deal but with one
[2:08:38] person at a time it's always a Onan
[2:08:43] message can I say that again it's
[2:08:46] always
[2:08:48] always a one man not one man
[2:08:52] plus not one man and everybody
[2:08:55] else it's one
[2:08:58] man and those are the tapes that we
[2:09:02] promote these are the people that I this
[2:09:04] is who I'm going to quote from I'm not
[2:09:08] ashamed of it Saints and you shouldn't
[2:09:10] be ashamed of it either but there is a
[2:09:13] spirit that has a problem with
[2:09:15] it and that problem has grown over the
[2:09:19] years
[2:09:21] I've just been in for a little while 30
[2:09:24] years or so I've seen things develop
[2:09:26] I've seen things grow and see directions
[2:09:29] that people
[2:09:31] take and look at the direction of the
[2:09:33] churches today just take your mind back
[2:09:36] 20 years or go back a little bit we did
[2:09:39] it a little bit for you last week
[2:09:41] talking about the first few brothers
[2:09:43] that fell away in the great apostasy and
[2:09:46] how others started to fall away and here
[2:09:49] we are the this this great a uh uh um
[2:09:53] situation arising where these ones that
[2:09:55] are now following you know they have a
[2:09:59] problem with the one man
[2:10:01] message now the pillar of fire the gifts
[2:10:05] the anointings the third pool Mana
[2:10:08] Mysteries revealed they preach that they
[2:10:10] quote it but the one man message they'll
[2:10:15] tell you you're trying to lift up a
[2:10:19] man it's too much brother brandom not
[2:10:22] enough
[2:10:24] Jesus that sounds good Jesus is our Lord
[2:10:29] and savior but who did Jesus send to us
[2:10:32] in this
[2:10:34] day he sent us a
[2:10:37] message and daythan and Kora had a
