Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Good to be together again. Amen. Such a wonderful service we had this morning and just it's so nice coming in and just feeling the presence of the Lord in the building and we know he's here again tonight. We have that promise where two or three are gathered together. He's in our midst. So we just want to welcome him and and I just want to give my all this morning. Do my part to create an atmosphere. How many will join me and say I'll I'll do my part this evening. Amen. Let's stand if we could and we could sing that of course to start the service tonight. Amen. We are standing on holy ground.

As I come into your presence, past the gates of praise, into your sanctuary, till we're standing face to face. I look upon your countenance. I see the fullness of your face. I can only bow down and say that you are awesome in this place. Mighty God, you are awesome in this place of a father. You are worthy of my praise. To you our lives we raise.

Lord, just uh set our thoughts of the day aside, Lord God, and just concentrate on you, Father. Worship you in spirit and in truth as the word of God says. Lord, we just want to humble ourselves, Lord. Just come before you, Lord, and magnify your name, Lord. Hear your precious word of life. Ask you to anoint that word to our hearts, Lord, and our lives to your service. Father, we just love you and thank you so much for your amazing grace to us, Lord. Even giving us the desire to be here, Father. We just are so grateful, Lord Jesus. It's contrary to the things of the world, Lord. We don't want to identify with the world in any way, Father. We just just raise you up, Lord God. As you bless your children who have gathered together tonight, may you just come down, Lord God, and speak to each one, Lord. you know our needs before we ask them. Father, we just place them in your hands and just ask for your will to be done here. Grant it, Lord, we ask. And we ask these things in Jesus name, giving you thanks. Amen. But as he passes by, you will find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He's passing by this moment. your knees to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as he sing it one more time as you're seated tonight. Yes. Reach out and touch the Lord as he passes by. You will find he's not too busy to hear your heart's cry. He's passing by this moment, your needs to supply. Reach out and touch the Lord as he goes by. Amen. You can be seated. What a wonderful thought that is. You know, he's he's never too busy to hear your cry. I can look at myself and know that there's times when people have come to talk to me about something and you just maybe it's not a good time and you just you cut them short. They can tell that you don't have time for him at the moment, but he never is that way. And that's that's the example I want to I want to pattern. And regardless of what we're going through, he's there for us. He wants to hear about it. And he's paid the price for whatever we have need of, he's every need, he'll supply. Just so thankful for that. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. I've had many tears and sorrows. I've had questions for tomorrow. There have been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials only come to make me strong. &gt;&gt; So I can say through it all. Yes. Through it all, I have learned to trust in Jesus. Oh, I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, oh, through it all, I have learned to depend upon his word. Now, I've been to lots of places and I've seen a lot of faces, there have been times I felt so alone. All but in those lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know that I was his all. Oh, he made me know that through it all. Yes. Through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. Oh, I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, yes, through it all, I have learned to depend upon his word. Lord, how many can say they thank him for the mountains and the valleys tonight? Thank him for the mountains tonight. Thank him for the valleys. Thank him for the storm he's brought me through. Oh, for if I never had a problem, I'd never known that he could solve them. I'd never know what faith in God could do. So through it all, through it all, I have learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it all, through it all, I have learned to depend upon his word. Yes, I have learned to depend upon his word. Amen. Amen. Jesus loves me. This I know for the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak but he is strong. Yes Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh, the Bible tells me so. Let's sing that first verse one more time. Jesus loves me. Oh Jesus loves me. This I know for the Bible tells me so. Little ones to him belong. They are weak, but he is strong. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. Oh yes, Jesus loves me. The Bible tells me so. My boat of life sails on a troubled sea. whenever there's a wind in my s. &gt;&gt; But I have a friend &gt;&gt; who watches over me &gt;&gt; when that breeze turns into a g. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storms. He'll make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. &gt;&gt; Sometimes I soar like an eagle to the sky. Among the peace my soul can be found. An unexpected storm may drive me from the highs. It may bring me low, but it'll never bring me down. I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. &gt;&gt; He can calm the storms. He'll make the sun to shine again. I know the master of the wind. Stand as we sing it one more time. Oh, I know the master of the wind. I know the maker of the rain. He can calm the storm, make the sun to shine again.

Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. You may be seated. I I want to talk slowly because you might not hear what I'm saying uh according to yeah my accent. Thank you musicians. Thank you. God bless you. Um so much singing. I love it so much the way you've been singing here and I'm really enjoying it. Thank you John. Thank you church. Thank you pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you've heard before that they say people in Africa sing so much you sing better than them. I'm so glad to be here and uh I bring greetings from back home. I spoke to my wife. Times are different. While it's morning here, it's evening with them. They are 9 hours ahead of us. So, well, she sends her greetings, &gt;&gt; brother Karma. The brother that is narcissist to me when I'm not there, he takes the services. is so he really wants to be here himself. I I am so glad that I could be here. Um where I come from in South Africa, I am 1,000 kilometers from Cape Town. I'm 800 kilometers from Johannesburg, 400 kilometers from Debon and uh 600 from Debon and 400 km from Port Elizabeth. Those are big cities. Just showing you that I'm in the middle of nowhere in the Eastern Cape. Um I was shocked to hear that brother Bates, he was just asking where you from brother and I tell him that I'm from South Africa. From where in South Africa? I said Queenstown. Queenstown is uh 50 kilometers away from me. That's a little town that is very near to us. There's a most little one where I come from Lady Fry. And out of that one, 14 kilometers out in the in the rural area. So I tell him, I'm from Queenstown. At least you will know Queenstown. He says, "Yes, yes, I know Queenstown. I know Lady Fra. I know Benu." And I thought, "What?" Only to find out they were there years back as a worldwide missionary outreach and he didn't know they were in my church. And that's the person that can tell you better of where I come from. He says they tried to to take a shortcut to go to my place and the shortcut ended up being a long cut rocks and things and then they got there but we had beautiful services. I was their interpreter and he didn't know that that was my place and I was so glad and I sent some pictures back home. Oh, they were so glad to see the pictures. Um yes and again I saw brother John Martin Ellen Martin this morning he was here at church he also went to that place and that now shows that many of you are still going to go there I met brother Israel two years ago I thought it was three it's two years ago when I came through with brother Roger Collins and then we met at Roger Collins and then I came here one evening and uh Wednesday evening and brother Israel said to me brother have you going to preach tonight and I thought I'm not preaching when you were still in the old building. &gt;&gt; Yes. So I am glad to see you all and I want to really congratulate you for this new building. God bless you. I sent uh the links back to my people back home so that they can see all the services that took place. I had promised brother Israel that uh I will be here for the dedication of this uh this uh church and the anniversary that you had. But yeah, as the time came by then I thought now I'm not making it because I didn't have any money. And I looked and I thought, "No, no ways. I must push." You know, I always push. I gonna push and be there. Anyway, then I checked my account. I had about 1,000 US, which was exactly my my ticket to come over. And I took that. I sent to my sister-in-law. I said, "Book a book a book a flight for me. I'm going." And I like to do things like that. That's why I'm here now. And I've seen brother Israel in South Africa, I think two times. I don't know, two two times maybe. I think he was once on his own and the next time he was with sister Sharon. So, uh, okay, I just want to talk about those things before I get to the reading of the scripture. Um, this church is really beautiful. Eh, it's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can just thank the Lord for it. Um, and I love you so much. I I I have a place in my heart for the believers in Phoenix. When I was there, not everyone was there. When I went with pastor to to Phoenix, not everyone was there, but I really love those people. Each time we we talked on the phone, I would ask him, you know, how about Phoenix? How are they doing? How are they doing? Then then I saw some of them here during the last weekend. I was uh so thankful. I don't know why, you know, my heart just moves like this when I think about them. And uh yes, now maybe about the testimonies and that I can just drop a testimony as I I move on. One thing good about the testimonies is that you you tell a testimony and I I don't don't get tired of telling a testimony and uh because you are telling the truth each time you tell it is the same as you told it before. So it's such a blessing. Maybe I shouldn't go back to the way you know I came in. It will take some time but uh the one that I've been telling now in the places that I've been is about my wife's grandmother her name was Katrude and uh we came in the message of course I'm from Assembly of God with my wife we got baptized I don't want to go into it brother it's going to take time and then Now the Lord helped me you know I I was in Johannesburg then I had to go back home to my closer people and spread the message over there and uh by God's grace I had that opportunity of translating the message &gt;&gt; into closer then it helped me a lot I was telling one brother that I I couldn't type because you had to type out what you you are translating then I couldn't not type. We had the old typewriters and I would go like this when I'm typing and it took a long time and then I decided later that I'll get somebody to do the typing for me. The little money that I was being paid then I had to cut it in half because I want the message to go out and pay this sister that was doing she was not a sister in the message then and that's how she came in when she was doing the typing. I'd let her do the typing and then share the message and let her do the typing and that's how she came in and uh so it really helped me to to get the message out there. Um I want to remember a few things. Then my wife's grandmother that is the mother to her father saw a a spoken word book that she carried when she went to visit her and on the cover page it was a photo of brother Brennham when brother Benam was still younger and then my wife tells me grandma said oh that's exactly him that's William Brennham I saw this man in 1951 when I was still a young lady working in in in in what you call in East London and uh she says it's him exactly he spoke and uh a lady by the name of Ununice had a big hump on her back and and she says brother Brennham he says William Brennham William Brennham spoke and that hump vanished like that Not only that, she says she had a long what on one of her fingers and then it says each time she was cutting bread, she was so careful that she mustn't cut the what from the finger. And then the day that she saw that miracle when she woke up the next day, look, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; didn't even know which finger it was. &gt;&gt; There's not no one. It vanished. But the most important thing that I I thank the Lord for is that you know the Lord has got his ways. &gt;&gt; He brought me in and I went around and I brought in her granddaughter. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My wife after that her two brothers. &gt;&gt; I brought them in. After that, the baby sister of theirs also in &gt;&gt; uh last Easter, we baptized my mother-in-law &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm so thankful about that. He know the Lord didn't lead her to go and see brother Brennham for nothing. &gt;&gt; And the Lord knew we were coming. There's many, many more um testimonies, &gt;&gt; but I I'm so glad that I could see you here. When I first landed here in 2023, I don't know what happened. I was listening to some music, you know. I think I remember the song that I was playing when we landed into Tusan. Yeah. These are the days of Elijah. I was listening to that song and we're landing here and it's like I'm so full of joy like I'm landing into Israel. It was like I'm learning into the holy land. I don't know. I don't know. Somebody told me later that brother Brennan actually says something about Tusan being Jerusalem and that type of a thing. I don't know. I will know later. But then brothers and sisters um I'm really very glad to be here. I want to perhaps as I I carry on with the little message that I'm going to share with you tonight, I will get into touch into some of the testimonies. God willing. I want us to go to the scriptures and read. Friday morning, I woke up at the hotel where I was with a song in my heart. &gt;&gt; A song that I didn't know. I don't know now even. But the song was going like the shepherds, the shepherds, the shepherds. And I woke up and I sang the song. You know, it's a new song. &gt;&gt; But little later in the day, I forgot how the the the the the rhythm goes, the the the tune, but it was a loosey. Then I was singing all the shepherds, the shepherds, the shepherds. So I thought, let me hear about these shepherds. Let us read then from our scriptures. I want us to turn to the second book of Kings chapter 8 and we read verse 9. Could we all stand for the reading of the word please second book of Kings chapter 8 and uh I'll read it shouldn't be kings No, no, it's not. It's the second book of Samuel. Why did I write Kings? I'm also depending on the scriptures that will pop up there. Second book of King of Samuel rather Samuel chapter 8. You know it happens many times that you you get a scripture you you write it only to find out you've written a wrong one. Even now it's not this scripture. Um, okay. I will get it. Saints, please bear with me. Let me look at the 1st Samuel. Let me check. 1st Samuel 8:9 failing which will go back to the book of Kings because I want to read this scripture I can do without it because I've get I've got many other scriptures now it's not first Samuel it's not 8 n of 2 Samuel let me see Oh, is the chapter that I didn't write? So, these are only verses. How will I know now? But anyway, let us turn to first Peter chapter 2 verse 25. Let's leave that one alone. First Peter 2:25. Amen. It's the correct one. That one. Now, let us pray. Lord God, we thank you so much, Lord, that we can stand here to open your word. We learned from our prophet Lord that any man that's got two hands can push back the pages of the Bible. But it takes you Lord the great Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; to come and reveal Lord and open up Lord what is contained in this scripture Lord as we read. It's a little thought in my heart, Lord, and I know it's from you when I heard that song about the shepherds, oh Lord, but Lord, may you come and talk to us, Lord, through your word as we read it. Heal the sick, Lord. Encourage, Lord, those that are weak, oh Lord God, and may we take courage, Lord, and get that closer walk with you. We pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. that scripture that I wanted to to to read there, the prophet was talking to David and saying, "Go and tell David that I took him from following the sheep out there." So that's the scripture I wanted to read, but let's read this one. For you were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Now when I had this little thought about the shepherds, I went and I listened to the message why it had to be shepherds that brother Brennham is preaching and I listened to the message through and I came back and listened to it again and I thought I must share that with you people. Amen. And uh brother Brennham the very first verse or paragraph that I saw of that message he was speaking and saying that I might not preach to you again. I am greeting you. It was about Christmas time. Amen. Maybe we we we we we can check the this message is 641221. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh he he carries on now to talk about uh the shepherd. And he says, "A shepherd is somebody that stays close to his sheep." &gt;&gt; He says he stays so close to his sheep until he smells like a sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he even laughs like a sheep. &gt;&gt; He he laughs like a sheep. He says so close. And in some areas you find out that uh where they have a sheep fold where they keep the sheep. We do keep the sheep out there. So some shepherds won't even go inside a house. They will sleep at the entrance of that sheepfold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To look after the sheep. &gt;&gt; All right. So now carries on and on and on and on to say why did God choose shepherds to hear the good news of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. Why did it had to be shepherds? And uh brother sister I encourage you to go. I know you know this message but you can read it again and again. By the way, I wanted to wish you a good Thanksgiving day coming Thursday. Is it on Thursday? &gt;&gt; God bless you with your families wherever you will be. I will be in Jeffersonville, God willing. Now, brothers and sisters, Proam talks about this shepherd. The shepherd cares for the sheep so much that he even doesn't worry about his own life. The scripture I was reading about David, the Lord was saying to him, he was following the sheep, tending the sheep, going after the sheep. That was his job. And brother Brennham says most of the prophets, they were shepherds. There were those lowly men uneducated that were were attending shepherdship all over. He says almost all of them. But now I want to come to where now the Lord himself presents himself as a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we we can go to the book of John chapter 10. I took it I took after pastor uh pastor Paul he read so many scriptures so I'm also reading many scriptures this morning if we go to this book of uh John chapter 10 chapter 10 and verse 7 then Jesus said then said Jesus unto them again verily Verily I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. &gt;&gt; All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers. But the sheep did not hear them. &gt;&gt; I am the door. By me if any man enter in, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. The thief cometh not, but for to steal and to kill and to destroy. I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly. I am the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the title I wanted to give my message that let us follow the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you are lambs here, I don't see any goat. &gt;&gt; When I look around, I just see lambs all over. Do you know when we were at school, we were taught like a taught English like a a baby sheep is a lamb. A baby goat, they said he's a kid. And one day I heard brother Brennham speaking in one of his messages. He says you you're my kids in the gospel. And he said and he corrects himself. He says but you're not a kids. A kid is a goat. So he says no you are not you're not kids. You're my little lambs in the Lord. Now when I look at you I see only sheep. I see lambs of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I see Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. beautiful people. I see people that need to be fed of the Lord. People that need to be tendered by the Lord himself. I see people that are looking for a shepherd. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a a shepherd in this life, you will just perish. Let me put it that way. &gt;&gt; You should have a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Lord Jesus Christ says, "I'm a good shepherd." &gt;&gt; And now I will read on. He says, "Why do I say I am a good shepherd? The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is in hiring and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleth. and the wolf catcheth them and scatter the sheep. Now, now why I say we must follow this good shepherd is because there's other shepherds that are not shepherds. Because the Lord says here, this supposed to be a shepherd. He looks he doesn't look over the sheep. All he's looking at is when the wolf is coming so that he will not attack the wolf. He will run and leave the sheep alone &gt;&gt; and the wolf comes around and scatters the sheep all all over. Now we must follow the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Now the good shepherd. Amen. Maybe we we can read from this message. &gt;&gt; Before I go there, brother Brennan says one of the messages that he preached before this one in 1964, he says he preached one in Phoenix and one in Tusan. Yeah. The other one was why little Bethlehem. Still talking about the sheep and the shepherd. And he says there the Lord had to be born in a stable for he is a sh he's a sheep. He had to in what why little Bethlehem that's where he says he breaks down that word Bethlehem in Hebrew. In Hebrew it says bite which means house. Lem means bread. I know a little Hebrew. So that was the house of the bread. &gt;&gt; That place is called the house of the bread of God. Amen. Because Rabam says you can also al also push in l in between lam is bread. B his house. So he had to come as the bread of God. He had to be born not in any other place. Had to be born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. now on and on and then he says the next one he preached I think it was here in Tusan he says we have seen his star &gt;&gt; in the east &gt;&gt; and we have come to to worship him &gt;&gt; that was Christmas time I didn't know Christmas was so close until we got to some of the restaurants here and when you get there they play Mary's boy child in all Christmas is just around the corner. But how happy are we? Because we know Christmas better than they know Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because our Lord came as a little lamb and he was never born at Christmas time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Prom says he came as a lamb. He was born not in December but he was born in April &gt;&gt; when little lambs are born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's okay. It's okay to remember that he was ever he he was born. It's okay to remember that. But for us, as the pastor said this morning, it's it's we were given to know the mysteries. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you take that as an advantage that you know when exactly he was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now here are the shepherds. We can go and read in the book of Luke chapter 2 and verse 8. I will hurry in the book of Luke chapter 2 verse 8. And they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night. I don't know if you came across where brother Brennham says he's disputing that he was born in December in winter. Your winter and uh Palestine's winter in December. Back home is summer now. It's not winter. It's very hot in December. Our summer holidays are in December, November, December, January. That is summer. But Rem says, "Now, how could you find any any shepherds out there in the cold tending their sheep there when the snow is so snow all over?" He says, "It's impossible. It was not in winter when he was born in December." Brother, sister, &gt;&gt; I had pastor asking you what star is that when all are having birthdays and I looked at brother Brennham's birthday. Braam's birthday was in &gt;&gt; April and I look you know you see the way it goes according to you know the Lord Jesus was born at the same time he also was born at the same time I don't want to go into that because the Lord Jesus was born in a stable and brother Brennham was born in a cabin in that shack in that little thing exactly like the Lord was born I don't want to go into Because brother Brennham when he grew up as a little tiny little boy he saw visions. The Lord Jesus when he was a little boy he spoke to the Pharisees and those people about the scriptures the things of the Lord. When he grew up he was loved by God that is Jesus but hated about the the by by the the the the Jews. Brother was loved by the Lord but hated by the people around him. I remember in the life story he says one day he was coming back from school carrying the books for one little lady there and a little girl and these boys were jealous of him. How can he do that? They came and they hit brother Brennham like that they hit him. What does he think he is? In fact, brother Brennham says he they didn't even approve the fact that he was white. Yes. because of the background of the grandmother that was Indian &gt;&gt; and it went with him all the time that what does he think he is? Who does he think is carrying book for this beautiful girl? What? And they hit him. They hit him. So he says he ran to to to to his father's house and he came with a shotgun &gt;&gt; determined to shoot them. &gt;&gt; He says going to shoot them. He says we got him. We got him. They walking. The grass is so tall and they walk. We got him. We got him. He says, "I got there and with my father's shotgun, I said, "Which one of you wants to die first &gt;&gt; so that he doesn't see the others when they die?" &gt;&gt; And he tried to shoot and the gun wouldn't go off. He tried to shoot and says, "I was the type of a person that when I was angry, I would just laugh." And he says but the Lord wouldn't allow him to be a killer &gt;&gt; otherwise there wouldn't have been those prayer for the sick that the great ministry of his &gt;&gt; the Lord he keep him like that you want to know where when he grew up seeing those visions he went through I didn't know I was going to go there he went through very hard times until he lost his wife, &gt;&gt; he lost his daughter &gt;&gt; and he was in such a desperate situation and he says the devil says to him when the Lord couldn't did not heal his wife and the devil says to him you pray for others now it's your own family your wife and your your your daughter he doesn't heal them and prophet says you I'm sorry church I won't be reading the the quotes all the time but I know what what I'm saying if you search and some of you remember already how it's like that I I and he says the devil says to him what do we make of it now he can't answer your own prayer he says I said then if he doesn't I will the Lord has given &gt;&gt; the Lord God has taken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His name be praised. He didn't take what the devil was giving him until this one day. I want to come to this one. Do you know it was not easy for our Lord was never easy for our Lord. &gt;&gt; He would be preaching and they would be throwing stones on him. He would be healing the sick and they would they would take him him to court for that for healing the sick. It same with brother Brennan everywhere where not everybody clap their hands they wanted to know how do you do that with what authority how do you do it I'm sorry if you look at the the videos those old videos of brotherham sitting with all the ministers up front there and then when he's praying for the sick or discerning the thoughts and you you see some other brothers looking as if they're going to see how is he doing how does he do this thing, what where's the trick? Where's everything? But it was not so easy for it was not easy for brother Brennham until this one day. He says he was at work when he was working for public services. And he says he's climbing onto this one pole. He's climbing. He says, "I was singing on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross." He says, "I happened to turn and I saw on the shadow there. I saw my hands on that pole like that." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Lord, it was my sins that you put you up there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what, brother, sister? It's not easy to leave your church and come and sit here. It's because the Lord has predestinated you to hear this message. &gt;&gt; It's because you are a seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A predestinated seed. You have to come, you leave all those things. You come here. It's not very easy. And I look there, my brother, my sister, it took pains &gt;&gt; for brother Brennham to bring this message. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I was &gt;&gt; Yes, I thought I would bring those testimonies here. I was out of Cape Town in a place called Kaledon where a brother came. He had a picture in his hand, a photo of brother Brennham. Brother Brennan was in the Cape Town drill hall with back in 1951. And this brother brought this picture from the farm. He says there's an old lady there that's been keeping this photo for a long time. And you can you can see brother Brennham is under the power of the Holy Ghost. They take him out of of the hall there. And he's been keeping that one. And I took that I I sent it to Jeffersonville. And uh this brother says the old lady went on to say that day she was there. That day there was a a news reporter that was there taking pictures and that. But when he saw brother Brennan in that condition in the under the power of the Holy Ghost, this man just thought, I'm going to touch him &gt;&gt; and see how it feels. &gt;&gt; Guess how it felt. And he says he went, this man went and he touched brother Brennham. &gt;&gt; And he tells them it was like an electric shock. &gt;&gt; It was like touching live power. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the man was not a believer. They say the next day he had his tie on. He was sitting in church. He was one of us. You know now it was not so easy. And then brotherham says it was my sins that put you up there. &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; On that cross. &gt;&gt; You know what I thought? I said again Lord &gt;&gt; it was my sins. that put you up there &gt;&gt; in that prophet of yours &gt;&gt; for me this time so that I could see this message. Listen here. I'm not making brother Pam anything. I'm taking I'm just comparing. And I will never worship the prophet of God. &gt;&gt; But the Christ in him I will worship. &gt;&gt; The Christ in me. I will worship. &gt;&gt; The Christ in you. I will worship. &gt;&gt; But he unfolded this thing to us. If he didn't, you wouldn't be sitting here. &gt;&gt; If he didn't bear all the rep brooch. If he didn't take it to him to say even if I'm the only one &gt;&gt; I will stand for this message then you know what my brother my sister then it brings me to this code that I want to read this one now yes I'm not going according to my notes now amen you know you you may put this one up this I wanted to get so much and I thought Lord it's 65410 654 and uh Oh no. How I wish We we we we could I was so glad I didn't even write I didn't I didn't even write the title. No, but but can we get it up there? No, it's 65 0410 and I want paragraph 178. Okay, I just I'll wait for you, sister, if you can get it. Yes, it's this one. 650410. Sister. Okay. Okay. No, it's not. It is. Oh, God. Why? How can the enemy be such a thief? &gt;&gt; How can the enemy be such a thief? I was writing this this afternoon, sister. I'm sorry. It's not that one. But brother Brennham in this one says, "I can see my end yonder at 56 years old." If you get it that you get that one, sister, you may put it up. The thief is stealing it from me now. Was it that one? Oh, yeah. Oh, but okay. Let's go back there, sister. Because I I want to bring something here that is why Oh, was it this one? 178. Oh, remember we are flesh of his flesh. Is it where is it? We are flesh of his flesh. Bone or his bone if we are his bride. Death won't bother quickening power at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you very much. It's it though. the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see him &gt;&gt; glory to God &gt;&gt; and he says what I I don't know what I say what a hope for an old man like me knowing I see my end time right out here yonder soon at 56 years old I don't know the other quotes where he says this but this is eight months if I count correctly from the time that he passed on. You know, you you young people that are here, you are so fortunate like our dear brother Angel here that stood here and was prayed for. &gt;&gt; You you you you are so fortunate that the message get hold of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before the world gets hold of you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when the pastor was talking about the internet, you go in the internet, you you you just type William Brennham, all you hear is bad things. All you hear is he's a false prophet. The first thing that you hear, false prophet, this this this and they are saying, "Brother, sister, even some of those that were believing it now are starting to go astray." I can't imagine when you can grow in the message and be here listen to such preaching of the word listen to all these days and at the end you you you you come against that message that very I don't know how how it's possible &gt;&gt; now that's what you get why don't they see that one where brother Brennham would see his death coming and say I am going when I'm 56 &gt;&gt; soon. Is that what he says? &gt;&gt; Why am I getting it wrong? &gt;&gt; But when but when they say he's a false prophet, what about that one? &gt;&gt; That one only. If you you you you look in the internet that they will tell you a sister so and so prophesied about his death and brother so and so prophesied those denominational people coming back. But what about that one? &gt;&gt; It was not easy. &gt;&gt; It was not easy for him. So now if you you were following me until I it was my first time to to see a man worldwide that is like brother Brennham that would all of his sermon the titles are just the word of God. all the titles to an extent that you would say you you you you would say that Jesus had his uh own messages like the mount the sermon on the mount like other messages that he had there until when the Lord was about to leave he had his very last message you know the message of the Lord Jesus Christ the last one that he Jesus communion. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Communion. &gt;&gt; In a Jewish place, synagogue. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you come to brother, what is the last one that he preached? &gt;&gt; Am I wrong? &gt;&gt; Communion in a Jewish synagogue here in the Old Testament. I'm not I'm not making brother anything than what God has made him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To come by God's grace and open up those mysteries that the pastor was talking about &gt;&gt; to me and you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was Christ in him that was doing that. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, you know when the Lord left the Lord Jesus Christ, I will not leave you alone. I will ask the father to give you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right? And brother, the Lord when he left, he didn't leave us alone. He left the word with us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He left this word, the Bible. Amen. He left this this Bible with us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother, you must take this inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You must treasure this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our prophet said read your Bible &gt;&gt; and pray every day. &gt;&gt; This is not just a book. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is God in a word form. &gt;&gt; Amen. You must take that. And the Lord left that that those pages. He left this word for us. We we treasure it so much. &gt;&gt; You know what happened when brother Brennham left? &gt;&gt; What did he leave us with? &gt;&gt; Amen. spoken word books. &gt;&gt; We use we used to have such a stack of books but we're privileged these days. You don't carry so much you know in your little gadget everything is there &gt;&gt; all the 1,200 and something messages of in that little gadget. But I'm sorry to confess on our behalf on all of us. We are so lazy. &gt;&gt; We are so because we we won't listen to the full message. Just take a code here, a code there, a code there. Sometimes you misconstrue it. You take this one where it doesn't belong. And instead of listening to the whole whole message, we have it there. He left us the spoken word. Not only the spoken word, he left us a voice this time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each time I read the messages, brother Brennham doesn't say, "Go and check in the book." He says, "Play back the tape." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And hear what I said. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even with even with indictment. &gt;&gt; Oh, that message I I translated that message when he talks to the denominational ministers and he says he will beg them. He says now don't switch off the tape now. &gt;&gt; Listen on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He carries on that. He left that voice. That voice. And the Lord left the voice this time. The voice. You want me to read a go about the voice? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you with me, you can read this one in the in the church age book. I think it's in page 157 of of the church age. Page 157 of the church age. It says uh this is the third paragraph. In every age, we have exactly the same pattern. That is why the light comes through some God-given messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a certain area, &gt;&gt; the light comes in a certain area to some God-given messenger. I know the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then from that messenger, there spreads the light &gt;&gt; through the ministry of others &gt;&gt; who have been faithfully taught. &gt;&gt; I think I had brother David Magguire here quoting that. He he said I never seen brother Brennham says many of us here didn't see him &gt;&gt; but he says but if you meet people that ever met &gt;&gt; brother Brennham there's difference in those people &gt;&gt; he says and that's that's what I noticed also you know I was I didn't know that I loved brother Perry green so much until he left to be with the Lord &gt;&gt; because you you can see in those people who any brother any brother any sister when brother Billy Paul came not because he's a son of brother Brennham because he had seen brother Brennham he had seen the angel let me put that one on as well you know when I first saw him in I thought what a difference this brother if he greets you come my Brother, come on. Brother, you're sorry. If he greets you, he doesn't say it like we do. God bless you. God bless you, sir. God bless you, sir. And he holds like that. So much love. Sit down, my brother. So, thank you, brother. So, so so much love. And you, you see a difference in this person. You know when he stands up to talk and say brother sister when I sing that song standing on the promises I don't want to be sitting in the premises and and you see him shaking that head and you think this man has been with him. You can tell he's been with him. Doesn't the scripture say like that? But then brother sister let's carry on with this message. those that are faithfully taught. But of course, all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only &gt;&gt; what the messenger has spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Should I say it? I love you people here. &gt;&gt; I love you &gt;&gt; for for listening to to to brother Brenham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listening to that voice all the time. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, my brother was asking me when you listen to these days brother do you listen to English only or do you listen to a translator? It's my own voice on there from those but brother let me tell you how much I enjoy it with my own voice because when I was doing it I was just doing it for fun. I was not doing it for money. I tell you my brother, &gt;&gt; look at what I I'm not here to good about myself, but I'm just thinking taking the little wages, &gt;&gt; sharing it enough in order for the message to go to the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. to an extent that when people are listening to the message back home, I think Proam says the battle rages on or something of that sort and God give me a a a way of saying it in. You hear brothers that are English speaking that can speak English when they pray we hear them saying Lord your prophet said and I think to myself it was God that gave me that &gt;&gt; otherwise they wouldn't stick with it they would you know brother Brennan will say things I love this prophet so much excuse me because brother Brennham will will say things there which I are so fitting like you will say you can't be inside the pawn shop and outside the pawn shop at the same time. &gt;&gt; And you'll say a river does not run up and down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he will say a lot of other things. You can't be half a sheep and half a goat. &gt;&gt; No. and and he you know he puts all those things he brings and the the sayings the idioms that he uses &gt;&gt; they fit our languages out there. I I was I was telling the the brothers this where he say can't call cattle greasy &gt;&gt; and in our language directly the way he puts it a podcast called okay or black now I'm I'm reading on Paul wanted the people to say only what he said. That is 1 Corinthians 14:37. If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. What came the word of God out from you, or came it unto you only? They add here or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure. So we are not those people that take here and add there. We want to keep the message pure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As it was from the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. now and soon the me the message is no longer pure and uh the revival dies down once the message is not pure. The revival dies down. &gt;&gt; How careful we must be to hear one voice. &gt;&gt; He left us that voice. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. to hear that one voice. Not many voices. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; For the spirit has but one voice, &gt;&gt; which is the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Paul Paul warned them to say what he said, even as Peter did. Likewise, he warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given been given by revelation or how important it is to hear the voice of God &gt;&gt; by one way of his messenger and then say what has been given them to say to the churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have Now the is a shepherd that is a true shepherd. There is a shepherd that is not a true shepherd. When David would follow the sheep like like we do back home, you know the sheep are right in front of you and you turn them, you follow them. But now the Lord Jesus when he came, he he didn't follow the sheep. He walked before the sheep &gt;&gt; and sheep follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know there is a tribe back home the sutu tribe they are so good in tending the sheep. They train the sheep so much that they will walk and the sheep will follow. If you ever go to our country you'll see those suit people. They walk it will be green this side green this side. The sheep would maybe try to graze there, but they train them so much. They walk before the and the sheep follow the scripture and the sheep follow. We we we follow. We must follow the good shepherd. Brother, sister, that other shepherd that is not a a a real shepherd is a hiling that other shepherd. That one he wants money. Say I already said it. He wants money. He wants fame. He wants this. He wants that. But a real shepherd, &gt;&gt; the Lord said he lays his life for the sheep. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; he he he walks before there. There are so many shepherds today. You know, people might think that they don't need a shepherd. But brother, sister, if you go out of this church, go around the corner, you will find a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you are you are a sheep. Amen. There will be a shepherd. But it depends whether that is a good shepherd or a hire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know Balam. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Balam was called by Bailac. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To go and cast the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Why did he call him? Because Bailo he he knew all the the mechanics. He knew the administration type of part of it. He will tell you when the church starts, when we must go out, how how long as songs must be sung that before before you know the pastor comes. He'll know all those things. He'll know how to put the money in the bank, how to take it out of the bank. That's Bailo. But Bailo was lacking that spirit. So he thought he'll go and hire another man. A man that can shout like I do perhaps a man that can can kind of stir everything up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That baby like brother John can sing until you know we all get in the spirit. Amen. He'll try and get but he is a hirling. &gt;&gt; He's not a real shepherd. &gt;&gt; That is why we must follow the the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; And that shepherd my dear brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that shepherd, my dear brother, will take us from here into eternity. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that shepherd is Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That shepherd. Amen. I in this message uh why it had to be shepherds. I went paragraph 19. We'll read a few. My time is almost up. We read a few. Oh, it's gone already. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 19. And uh how it is. So then he was the bread of life as we taught last week in Phoenix or week before last as being the bread of life. He could come. He could come. No place else but the house of bread that is Be Bethlehem. And that was the why. Now here Jesus is born in Bethlehem. And in Bethlehem there was a synagogue. Great religious leaders lived in Bethlehem. David, great King Shepherd was born in Bethlehem. His father Jesse was born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; His grandfather Oette was born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; All the way back he come from Bethlehem. But I want to come now where where this good shepherd paragraph 25 we stay in this message. Let's jump to 25. 25. Notice angels coming and angels coming and giving their message to men of such low estate. Yes, &gt;&gt; when there were men there much more earthly thought of qualified than these poor illiterate shepherds. &gt;&gt; But he decided to come to the shepherds. The shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody. He didn't need to know nothing but just about the sheep. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he didn't need to know mathematics. He didn't need to know how to split an atom. He didn't need to no scholarship. He just had to know his ship. That's all he needed to know. And God the great wisdom and the great founder of and resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that person rather as that and bypass all the well-trained scholars that's trained to know that it speaks one thing that they were trained in the wrong field &gt;&gt; passing up all the important of the land. There were important people, great teachers, kaiapas, the high priest, many of the great men, all Israel's mighty learned, all the denominations and all the boasting theologians. God bypassed every one of them. Now, God's wisdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, now let let me uh stop with those quotes. and uh talk to us the lambs that we must at all times follow the good shepherd &gt;&gt; and the good shepherd is the Lord Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh I noticed and I thought it cost you a lot of money to build this building and to have the services over that weekend. But brother, sister, you know what? If you do something for the Lord, the Lord will do better things for you. &gt;&gt; Big things than you you ever think of. There was a time back home when we had when we started out there. We had Easter services at my place. We didn't have a a place for church. We'd keep it in my home and we'd go to international people to rent their church buildings and I took I'll say it it's not out there back home now all the money I had and I put it in the work of the Lord. So, we had good a good time, a good time, a good time. And then after the services, no money for groceries, nothing. We had to take out some stuff from my uh mud hut. It's a for it was a for building. Anyway, we took out things and we put them in the in the shack at the back. And then now we busy taking those things back to the house. Now we have no money. We taking those but we're not complaining. We feel so good from the services. And guess what? Here is an envelope amongst the books there. I don't know where it came from. &gt;&gt; And when I opened the envelope has got money. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; About 600 new notes. They all knew. I don't know when I put that in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord has just provided for me. And then brother, you know, one time a brother gave me some blocks to build a house because I didn't have a house. So a brother that was a businessman gave me, brother, you build yourself a house. And I decided, no ways. I'm not going to build no house. I'm going to take those blocks and give them to the church. So we start a church building. &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; brother. And we we build it up to this height, if not higher than that, with those bricks. And the builder that we hired to go and do this thing, he says, "Uncle," because he was a nephew of mine. He says, "Uncle, why don't you build yourself a house? It would be good if this was your house." I said, "No, you don't know what you're talking about." I started by building brother, sister. &gt;&gt; When you follow the good shepherd, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; Somebody said in a church, you become an asset. Yes. &gt;&gt; And not a liability. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Am I looking at your face? Look me in the eye now. Who's a liability here? But the Lord help us so much that we don't become liabilities, we become assets in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You do your thing. You open the door. Hallelujah. Another one sings up here. Another one accept, you know, welcomes all the guests. Another one do do this thing. You support your deacons. You support your pastor. Hallelujah. I was so glad I missed him this morning's prayer. Yesterday's morning prayer, brother. I'm so sorry I missed it and I'm so glad you're doing that. I I'm taking such a lot from you and I'm going to do it back home. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to before I go then my my time is already over. I'm looking there. Uh I'm taking only five minutes perhaps now. I'm dropping this testimony as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had a visitation. I was doing open air service downtown Johannesburg. And while I'm preaching there, you know, I'm preaching and preaching and carrying on While I thought I was doing so good now, here is a man that's lifted up his hand said, "May I ask a question?" And people were listening and he wants to disturb me now. But I listen to the Holy Ghost, he kind of said, "Give him a chance to ask a question." Those that are used to preaching open air meetings, you don't do that. &gt;&gt; So I I gave him because God said, "I must give him." He says, "When is the kingdom of God coming now?" And I said, "Sir, that is in the future. But if you accept the word of God that I'm preaching now, you are a candidate of that kingdom. It's coming." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Don't tell me that. You don't know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about when Jesus is going to reign as a king yet." I said, "Yes, it's in the future." But then he says, "Where's the scripture for that?" Did I have a scripture? And he had drawn such a multitude to come and see now that a minister, a preacher is going to be defeated by this whatever you can call him. So there were so many people. He says, "Where is the scripture? Brother, sister, out of nowhere there stood a man from the crowd, darkish, shortish man. He says, "Here it is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he quotes, you'll know where the scripture is. He says, "The kingdom of God is not coming with observation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is within you. And then he sat down. &gt;&gt; I just said, "There you are." &gt;&gt; Then I carry on my preaching. And this guy says to me, "You don't know what I'm talking about." He says, "I'm a Bible scholar. You can't tell me anything." Brother, did I give him? And I said, "Do you know what Jesus said to the Bible scholars of his day?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You generation of vipers." &gt;&gt; And he was so mad. Now he comes, he wants to hit me. And when he did that, it was like I was feeling something hot on my shoulders. And I said, "Sir, you did not get me." I didn't say you are a generation of vipers. I said Jesus said to those of his day, &gt;&gt; "You are a gen." And he says that Bible's a liar. The very man that was a Bible scholar and he says that Bible is a liar. And now the young people that were came there they they they were on him and saying what do you think we must believe now? You you saying and I don't know where a lot of people came. They were say they were cheering and amening as I was carrying on. But brother this is what I want to to to to to highlight here. After that I thought let me go and pray. I felt like going and praying. Then I went to to to a place where we pray. A wife to that man that tried to disturb me. I was in tears. And the one brother was saying he says please forgive me. Ask the Lord to forgive me. Now then I went and I prayed. You know that visitation I will never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That man that read the scripture, I don't know where he came from. I don't know where he went. All I remember is that after that I never walked on that place again. It was on a park. We would be walking through Johannesburg running, you know, rushing for a train at the station. When I get to that place, I get so much fear. I walk around. I don't look for a long time. And brother, I tell you, I'm not imitating brother. Something took place that day and it was a visitation. I I don't know. I don't know. I don't know where that man came from. I don't know where he went. How could he just get the scripture like that to to say and brother sister but from that day on &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; no matter what time of the day where I would be rushing for a train when I got to that spot just about to cross that park some get so much fear then I walk around I walk around. Now what I wanted to encourage the church here is just take this one more code is the last one. I hope I will get a correct one. Very last one in question and answers on the seals 63324M. It will be question number 174. I don't know if you have that one sister. Question and answers on this 630324M and Question number 174. All right. Yes. Should evangelists continue on the field in this hour. Of course. What they mean? Sinal by all means don't change anything. If Jesus is coming in the morning, preach today like if it was going to be 10 years from today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But live like it's going to be at this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't don't get scribbled up now. That's what I'm trying to warn you about. See, just don't be odd peculiar. Don't change nothing. But if you're doing something wrong or doing evil, repent. &gt;&gt; See, come back to God. continue on your evangelistic services service just as you always did. Now, if you're building a house, put it on up. If you're building this in this building, put it all up. Put it on up. And then he says, "Um, oh, amen. I'd rather be putting my money in something like that &gt;&gt; than be found with it in my pocket." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, with that one, I want to encourage you to to to carry on with the work of the Lord. And uh this for for for for for the two minutes that I'm left with, let us follow the good shepherd. Yes, Father. &gt;&gt; That good shepherd will will feed us of his word. &gt;&gt; That good shepherd, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit will never mislead you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. Some people I remember that that one quote that the pastor put up here during those services or was after that that weekend he put up a code here and I've been reading it where brother Brennan talks about that man that came and asked for a a sandwich and Rabanam says okay come on come on up says come on in fixing something to eat instead of g giving me a sandwich and he sat down and he ateam says the man was he didn't like to even call him a bum but the man was a bum and he says while he was eating I thought I must ask him some some some question seeing that he's a traveler he says I said, "Where do you come from?" And the man said, "Nowhere nowhere." And thought, I'll ask him another question and say, "But where are you going?" And the man said, "No way." And takes from that and says, "Some people just do that. They come to church and and just join church. They have no purpose in life. You know my brother, my sister, he says a person should have a purpose in life. &gt;&gt; You should know that you you you want you need to have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because the Lord when he left us here, he left us with a voice. But not only the voice he left with with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that you must not get lost on the road. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He's the one that died for us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's the true shepherd &gt;&gt; that laid out down the life for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now we cannot come to church just just to you. There was a song that used to be sung by the Okay, whoever is let me let me let me let me But the church goes like this. While we warming the seats, while we're warming the seats in the church where we go, do we take time to pray for the one who opens God's holy book to be given a word to say? We can blame ourselves when the church is called start moving for Jesus. We we we cannot be like a person that comes from nowhere goes to nowhere. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we we must we we we we are in a season now that people are just moving around. Back home where I come from, they change churches like I don't know what. Today they in pastor Israel, tomorrow they in my church, the day after tomorrow they another church. And this person doesn't even know what he's doing because you brother sister you should put your shoulder to the wheel. Help the church where you going. Brother Brennan says you you you in your in the church where you going. You must be a blessing. You must be a blessing. Amen. You you you must pray for the people. Oh brother, sister, let us bow our heads before we we we pray. I'm sorry I took so long. I didn't want to go into all the testimonies, but brother, sister, I had that little radio ministry that I was doing out there. People, my brother, my sister were getting healed there because I had decided that I will follow the good shepherd. I will do what the Lord puts in my heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I first came on there, brother, sister, I was paying 10,000 rand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Every month for just one hour, every Sunday evening, brother, sister, you don't know how much it thrilled my heart to know that on the day that I started the radio ministry, it was brother Brennham's 100th birthday. And I thought to myself, I'm giving brother Brennan such a present. I'm playing his voice for my people to hear &gt;&gt; Lord &gt;&gt; in this area all over here. And I didn't care how much I paid there. I'm doing something for the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's up to you, brother, sister. If you don't have the Holy Ghost, why don't you ask the Lord for the Holy Ghost? Why don't you pray so that the great shepherd &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; may lead you through. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam until he left he would say if you are not baptized be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. I don't know why you should be just sitting and not coming to him, not saying I need that shepherd, Lord. &gt;&gt; I need to follow the good shepherd, not the one that is going to run away when he sees the wolf. Somebody said, "This man is not even looking after the sheep. He's looking which side the wolf will come so that he may run." But let that not be you today. How many brothers and sisters say tonight Lord, be my good shepherd. &gt;&gt; I know you are the good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; you laid your life down for me. &gt;&gt; And now you are here as the Holy Ghost to come and lead me. Why don't they stumble over that one goat? 8 months before he left this world, this earth, he knew that my end is near soon ya when I'm 56 years old. Why don't they see that? And they will come and say, "Brother Brenham was wrong here, brother was wrong there." They come with all lies. But you brother, sister, the good shepherd is here for you. &gt;&gt; Who says Lord I promise I want to follow the good shepherd. Thank you Lord. God bless you my dear sister. God bless you my brother. God bless you young man. God bless you. God bless you my dear sister. I I thought we would be closing our eyes and praying within us, Lord, that the good shepherd is here. That good shepherd will lead us. He knows our needs even before we we say them out. I want to thank you for your love offering. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me here. But even if I didn't have anything, but I'm so thankful that I could see you and I promise you that we will meet over there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Each time we sing this song back home when the roll is called Aonda. I wish I could let people overseas listen to it. It's a promise to us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From us to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Saying when the ro is called, I'll be there. Oh, brother Brennham, in the preview of the bride, he says he saw different nationalities. He could tell if this was African, if this was Japanese, if this was Chinese, all nationalities were there. And he says, I looked as they were marching there that bride in the preview of the bride until I saw two or three getting out of step. I can imagine brother Brennan not even realizing he he was in a vision and say get in line, get back in line. &gt;&gt; Maybe it was me that he saw but I know he saw me. I know he saw you. I know he saw all of us that are part of this bride in that preview of the bride. May God bless you. Make sure that you have that good shepherd. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord God, I want to pray Lord before this church. Lord, I want to thank you for the pastor Lord that gave me a chance Lord to stand here. Lord, maybe I should have just stood and give given testimonies. Lord, there is this language barrier. But Lord God, I'm praying by all means, Lord, that the few things, Lord, that I could have said, Lord, I took a took me a long time. But Lord God, here's my sister over there, the young brother, that brother at the back, and that sister on my left, Lord God. And many that lifted up their hands, oh dear Jesus, I know, Lord, they don't lift up their hands. That's because they want me to see them. They want you to see them, Lord. &gt;&gt; I pray for them, Lord. I pray for myself. I pray for the pastor. I pray for this church here Lord Jesus. May you Lord encourage them. Give them I see that Lord that they are in the right direction Lord. Following your word Lord following what the prophet of the age said following Lord what those mysteries were open to us. Oh Lord God we thank you so much tonight Lord. May you bless them Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Why? With our heads still bowed, I want to ask who is going to be praying for me when I leave here. &gt;&gt; I would like to see that promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As you lift up your hand as I give to over to my pastor, will you be praying for me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you. I remember once Beum said to me, "Each time you think of me, just pray for me." &gt;&gt; And I'm doing that. &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, church. Over to you, pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, I enjoy that. Very good. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. If the uh the deacons will come as we prepare to take this offering for our brother, let's sing that song.

Let us pray as we bless this offering. Dear Lord Jesus, as we have the opportunity to give to the kingdom of God. Lord, I pray that you would bless the gift and the giver. May you multiply it and may it be used for the purpose of the furtherance of the gospel, the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, we thank you that we have something to give. We thank you Lord that you have provided and everything actually belongs to you already. You own the cattle on the thousand hills. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; it's already yours. But Lord, you give us little things, little livingings, little meager things to live by. And Father, our stewardship is to be a good steward. And Lord, the things that you've given to us, we want to give it back to you. Lord, this is an opportunity, Lord, as you place it upon our heart to give to the missionary work. And I've tried to do that, Lord. I don't know exactly the best way, but to support the ministries that I know that are true. Give the saints the opportunity to be a part of that. And Lord, we thank you for these precious, precious saints here. the lambs, the sheep of God. They're wonderful people. They're family members. They're our friends, Lord. They're brothers and sisters that we'll spend eternity with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, our thoughts towards them are only good, Lord. We thank you for them. We thank you for each other, Lord. I so appreciate their prayers. I pray for them. They pray for me, Lord. And I appreciate the love you place in our heart towards each other. Oh God, may you bless them. Bless the work of our hands. Bless where we're going. Bless what we're building, what we're working on. Bless us, Lord, on the complex things in our life. Lord, that we would come through those victorious. Lord, as we heard the word tonight, Lord, Father, I just ask you, let it settle in our hearts and our minds, let the truth of it unlock in our spirit that we can walk in the truth of following the good shepherd. You are the good shepherd, Lord. We follow you closely. ask you'll bless this offering and as we prepare to leave from this place, may you bless us as we go and be with us this uh what they call the Thanksgiving season. But Lord, we're just so thankful for you. All that you've done for us. Bless us we pray. Bless this offering and those that give. In Jesus' name we ask. Amen. Amen. Amen.
