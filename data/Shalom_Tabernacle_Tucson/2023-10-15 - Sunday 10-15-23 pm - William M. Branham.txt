friends I'm very grateful to be here tonight again just let you a while ago I think got out around 4:00 and then I had to we went out to see some more friends and got back 5 minutes after 7 just had to come back down so I'm kind of Happ to hunt a text yet brother NE but now there is a request that just was called in from someone in Chattanooga Tennessee uh loved one that was in a wck three weeks ago and lying unconscious still and requests prayer here from the church and yes you sure can brother yes I just almost forgot I made a promise to make an announcement tonight we were we were speaking of Mel chesd who he was and we nothing like got through with it but maybe the next time coming in we can pick up from there still in the book of Hebrews but tonight we turn over to the Book of Daniel and you with your Bibles turn to Daniel 12 and we're going to read a little from there and talk maybe on some of God's word out of the Book of Daniel now Daniel was one of the was the prophet that was carried from Jerusalem down into Babylon and the carrying away of Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar he was a young fellow when he went out into Babylon there was uh not um many of them that had still holding out the grand old faith I Daniel because his he had purposed that in his heart when he went down into Babylon that he was going to remain a Believer and he wasn't going to file himself with the king's meats and so forth now the very thing in Daniel was the prophet to the Gentiles Daniel saw all the Gentile age rise and fall he was the first one to be we called the Gentile prophet he wasn't a gentile himself but he saw the Gentile dispensation from start to finish in the head of gold and ending up in the feet of iron and clay and while down in there purposing in his heart that he wouldn't defile himself with the king's meats and with the king's Affair and another group of Brethren named Shadrach mishak and abedo was down there with them which was not prophets but believers and they also purposed in their heart and then when those four Believers come together I'll imagine quite oftenly they had prayer meetings together just like we do we get together because we have things in common you know there's an old slogan that says birds of a feather flock together and that's an old proverb rather and that's a pretty good thing too birds of a feather flock together aren't you happy for that birds of a feather flocked together not long ago I was sitting in a meeting where there was a man discussing something and he said well it's talking about the souls that went to prison was in prison that Jesus went and preach to after his death and this man that was speaking said well what do you think about him and a colored brother raised up he said well that's just what the Bible said he went and preached the souls that were in prison so what do you think it was said it was Souls that didn't repent and the longsuffering in the days of Noah while the ark was being prepared just like the Bible said he said no said that's this church preaching to those Pentecostal people that's in these denominations and everything bring them out of prison he said n look here brother he said Pentecost wasn't even mentioned there he said that he just said that he went and preached to the souls that were in prison so I said amen that's right and the minister looked around at me and said birds of a feather flock together I said that's right Brothers of like Precious faith believing just what the scripture says is the truth amen Daniel had three of those companions that were with him you know it's good when you're away from home to find somebody that's with you amen somebody that will stand by you a real good friend oh my in foreign lands when you find someone who wants to be your buddy and loves you and stands by you that's worth so much especially a stranger and these Brethren were taken away from their city and their city was burned and all their vessels and the holy things of God have been taken down into Babylon and was put into the Treasure House of King Nebuchadnezzar who had car not a great grand Gentile King now if if God has permitted that for their City to be burned their church burned and taking them down into the city it was because that they had got away from God but he still had a believer that he could put his hands on and say this is my servant God has always had a witness somewhere amen he never leaves himself without a witness no matter got down some sometimes to just one but he's always had somebody that he could put his hands on and say this is my servant and he'll do as I tell him now we like that noticing then that when these Brethren were down there they were put to a test very beautiful example of what a True Believer comes to when he really accepts the Lord Jesus as his savior he's always pucked to a test amen Satan still in the testing business and it only comes about to help you it's for your good amen every son that cometh to God must be tried chasen scorched and other words give a little thres straighten it up and if God gives us some chastisement and we can't stand it then we become illegitimate children and not the children of God now a man that's really got his face set towards heaven no matter what takes place here on Earth he still got his face set towards heaven his friends May forsake Him his family may forsake Him his Pastor May forsake Him but there's one that won't forsake Him that's God and when your mind is made up I like that Daniel had burned all the bridges behind him he wasn't planning on going back anymore amen he wasn't watching his back Trail he was looking forsaking those things which are in the past he pressed on to the mark of the high my calling that's what we should be doing that's what the church should be doing and as I noticed then God permitted Satan to give him the test and all they tested him by the fire they tested him also by the lons then and in every instant God brought them out more than Victorious many are the testings of the righteous but God deliver him out of them all amen how Mar marous that is how we appreciate that trials tribulations tests all working for the good amen after a while God can see then and he can put his trust in you and then he'll do great things for you now we find out then that Daniel became an instrument in the hand of God while he was away from his own people out of his own City away from his own church in a Strange Land God using now you can be away from whatever you may be you can be away from all your loved ones or you can be away from your church but you can still be an instrument in the hands of God God can use you for our testimony or for anything that he wishes to use you for beautiful examples the Bible's just so chug full of those things everywhere you turn don't you love to read the word oh I just read it sometime and week here a few days ago I was reading in the room there and I just had to sit down and cry like a baby I got up walked around my chair put my hand on my chair looked down at my Bible again I just broke I went around the chair again looked back at again I thought oh God in there is eternal life every man or woman that'll dare to put their trust in it and believe eternal life and he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me yes search the scripture the word of God is a lamp unto our feet that we we should be guided then it's the light that follows the pathway that leads us from Victory onto Victory now before you can have a victory there has to be a battle and if there's no battles there's no victories so we are to be thankful for the battles and the trying it's God giv us the opportunity to have victories am oh my don't that make it a little bit better now see the battle come along somebody saying something bad about you sickness come on to you maybe God give you those light afflictions that he might heal you and show his favor to you let you see what he means by he loves you amen the old Shepherd story that was told there in jerus Jerusalem in the Holy lands of the sheep but was packing a a sheep and he said what you packing it for say it's got a broken leg said how to do that fall over cliff said no I broke its leg he said well you're a cruel Shepherd to break that sheep's leg said no I loved it and said it was going astray and I couldn't make it mind me so I broke its leg so I could give it some extra tension so that it would love me and follow me sometime God has to let us break down just a little bit in health to give us a little extra tension to get us up on his lap to woo us up in his bosom when the doctor said nothing can be done then he take us into his bosom say see I love you I'm going to let you get well oh doesn't that just make life a little better amen oh he's so great he's a marvelous Shepherd isn't he no wonder David said the Lord is my shepher I shall not want how he leads us for the side The Still Waters and restores your soul and runs our cups over and and anoints us in the presence of the enemy did you ever get anointed in the presence of your enemy just to testify to your cup just borrowed over you know just how marvelous it is to be anointed in the presence of your enemy now notice then God took King Nebuchadnezzar and made him a tool in his hand and when King Nebuchadnezzar died after he had the grass grew out he haired like lion like eagles feathers and his fingernails like the claws of the eagle and so forth and God had to let him know who was the real king after his death Belta seure his grandson s succeeded him and then he was more wicked than King Nebuchadnezzar and one night there they had a great big party they call all all their their magistrates and all the officers in for our great big jamere and while they were having this jambourine and they were went and called out and took the vessels the holy vessels of God just to make fun of God and drank wine to their gods a toast out of the vessels of the Lord now a man is permitted to tra so far but there's a separating line between life and death you must never cross that see you can go on with your little foolishness for a while but you better know where the line is did the Lord ever check you on anything he does all of us pull the check ring it's far enough now then you better watch what you're doing from that on if you're stepping across towards that line and that night when God pulled P the check Greens on him and he wouldn't listen goes on down and brings out the vessels of the Lord begin to drink W wine and them toast to their gods then there came a hand down out of heaven and wrote on the wall teeny teeny te praia means th weit in the boun and found wanting no one could interpret it it was unknown tongues and there was a man there had the gift of interpretation Daniel so he comes down and interprets and tells the king what would happen and there God destroyed that Nation amen Babylon while Daniel being there he saw great visions and wrot concerning them for this great consolation that we have today knowing and setting in order the end of the Gentile Kingdom amen notice how perfect just get it post now he's seen first the image standing in the field when he interpret the dream of the king he was a spiritual man he dreamed dreams saw Visions interpret dreams God was with him and everyone knew that too and when he saw the vision the head of gold and the breast here of silver and the thighs of brass and the feet of iron notice each kingdom got a little harder King Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom was a head of gold he interpreted told him just exactly how those kingdoms would succeed each other unto the end then notice from gold is the softest silver is next then brass is next then iron is next harder harder colder farther away notice then in the midst of all that Daniel beheld the image until a storm will shoot out of the mountain that was cut out without hands it rolled into the image and broke it and made it like wheat on the summer fles thrashing floor and the Winds Drive away and the stone grew into a great Mountain that covered all the earth and the sea that was the coming of the Lord Jesus which is now at hand amen amen goes on when he was down by the river one day he fell into a trance and saw a vision many of those was with him they didn't see the vision for it was given only to Daniel you see it someone can stand right next to you and see things that you can't see to save your life right someone said I don't believe that I never seen nothing because it wasn't for you to see it then it went with Paul when Paul was struck off of his horse and had to fall onto the dirt and water as it was on the dirt none of them heard that voice or seen that Vision Paul saw it none of them saw the star of the cross the every Observatory but the wise man many things that way God has designated for certain peoples to see and others cannot see amen oh I love that when God in his infant wisdom has predestinated or for ordained for certain things to happen it can happen to the person sitting right next to you and you'll know nothing about it amen amen look at dolphin when Elijah was down at dolphin and there was all surrounded there by the by the aliens that come in the Syrian Army looking for Elijah the prophet for when it begin to find out every time the syrians that come over to Israel to make war why the Israelites have be laning Ambush for and so the king of Syria called him up said now wait a minute who is for us and who's for Israel said somebody in my group is a spy that's going to tell Israel just where we're coming in at for they're always there waiting for us and one man had a little spiritual Al about him he said he my father but it's a Prophet Elijah amen for he knows in his bedroom what you're going to make your move next amen amen oh when Atomic Powers begin to shake I'm so happy that the word of God has tell us where to go to flee to the Rock Christ Jesus every man that is safe and secured nothing can harm you no Tommy bombs no Cobalts nothing else can touch the preserved of God safe secure anchored what a marvelous hope amen that we have in Christ Jesus notice there was a man with him his servant spiritual boy walked and poured water on the hands of the Prophet a great position he had but when he seen the the Syrian Army All Around dolphin had all backed up he said my father look out there what a great number while we're surrounded now that's the natural whenever things seems to go wrong partner fer actually saying this and that and the doctor says you can't get well and so forth that's just the natural thing you think oh my this is end but Elijah said there's more with us than there is with them amen now you can imagine how that Prophet or that gesel the servant he looked over at him he said well I don't see nobody he said God open this boy's eyes and as soon as God did something here it is yet when God opened his spiritual sight amen all around that Prophet stood Chariots of Fire and angels of fire amen why he seen why the church the fire outnumbered that Syrian Army by the thousands the mountains was on fire angels of fire horses of fire Chariots of Fire and the Bible said the angels of God encamp without those who fear just the same tonight I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strap across your eyes and say look standing around this Tabernacle tonight you be a me here the rest of your life sure yes sir sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes but you can feel the impulse of it something near a six sense that denotes something is near watching this morning opening up the deaf ears making the PO old cripples walk around here like there was nothing wrong with them what is it it's the incense I mean the sense the six sense it's conscious the spirit that something is there have faith in God now they didn't he didn't see that first but Elijah probably didn't see it but he asked for the boy's eyes to see it but Elijah was conscious that they were there amen Thomas one time said let me put my hands in his side Jesus said now you see and believe how much greater is their reward who has never yet seen and yet believe amen that's us tonight whosoever will believe without seen and notice then Elijah walked out there to where this circumstance was and he said to them first he went out there and the Bible said he smoked them blind blind and walked right out to him everyone had perfect eyes thought as far as I know but the scripture said they were blind amen amen a little fellow a few nights ago said to me you be a man of God smite me blind I said you're already blind amen already blind notice and he walked out there to where this great circumstance was this great thing was and he said do you look for Elijah said yes said come on follow me I'll take you right to him Elijah said it to them what was they blind about they were blind to the fact that that was the prophet of God they were blind to and he led them right straight down in the Ambush again said come on I'll show you Elijah and it was Elijah taking them down there and when they looked around and found that they surrounded around the king said my father must I smite them he said would you take a prisoner to Smite him said give him something to eat and send him back to their country that's the way to settle Wars isn't that right sirling oh my if we had only ad that principle today de feed your enemy do good to those that do evil to you amen Holy Name there now the blindness now Elijah I mean not Elijah now but Daniel Daniel fora he was a prophet he saw the coming of the Lord he saw the end time come he saw the Gentiles start and if you notice the G started off with a uh idol worship they is worshiping a great Idol setting out in the field an idol of a man I believe Daniel himself because King Nebuchadnezzar had called him beler which was his God and he started worshiping an image of a righteous holy man and Daniel refused to do it solded the the Hebrew children the Shadrach mishak and abedo that's the way it was issued in and it was condemned that head of gold was issued in by image worship forced to it and ended up in a supernatural hand writing a supernatural language that only Supernatural understanding could understand it amen that's the way the Gentile Kingdom issued in and out the same way by Supernatural Works Supernatural interpretation amen you know what I'm talking about the working of the supernatural oh how marvelous aren't you happy tonight you believe in the Supernatural yes now then all to these Visions he showed him just where the nations would be standing he showed how that there were so many years depended yet on the Jews he said the Messiah shall come he'll prophesy in the 70 of weeks which is three and A2 years in the midst of it he'll be cut off which is seven years 70 weeks is determined for thy people seven years of Prophecy to the Jews he said in Messiah the prince shall come and prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks seven days will he be cut off in the Abomination make a desolation to stand in his place and they'll tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem Gentiles for a time time and dividing of time now when Messiah come Jesus he preached exactly three and a half years and was cut off for a sacrifice the daily obligation was taken away and the desolate the Abomination that make of desolation the mosm of om was stood today in the place of the Holy Temple amen the mou of Omar stands at exactly where the temple stood and he said that they would tread Down the Walls of Jerusalem over Jerusalem until the Gentile dispensation be finished but at the end of the Gentiles there would still be three and a half years yet to the Jews now notice one of the most striking things of prophetic history I don't claim to know the prophecy of the Bible but this is like reading a newspaper more plain and what we read here we know is the truth notice 2,00 2500 years the Jews has been scattered to ever Nation Under Heaven as God hardened Pharaoh's heart bringing him back he hardened Hitler's heart muscan heart and so forth till he drove them back to Palestine amen coming back they have made him a nation again and on May the 6th 1947 the Jewish flag was raised over Israel for the first time for 2500 years the oldest flag in the world was raised for the first time in 2500 years and he said in the last days he' raise up an ins sign over Jerusalem sure that the time is at hand and notice here not long ago I seen a prophetic reel played from over there and they're bringing in those Jews by the thousands by airplanes you SE it in the paper and so forth look and life magazines been pant thousands of Jews returning and they asked them said what are you returning for old crippled people packing them on their backs their L young ones were said are you coming back to the Homeland to die said no we're coming back to see the Messiah amen amen Jesus said when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its bugs amen and all the other trees amen putting forth their bugs know that time is not spring is not summer so when you see these things come to pass lift up your head your redemption's drawing n tonight as this world is honey owned by communism oh I was talking to a man a while ago on the one of the best authorities I believe it I know of and when he spoke things concerning this nation and communism it would shake you to your knees right H it's honeycomb there's nothing solid no more not even in her own country Harley there's only one solid thing all no will stand that's the rock Jesus Christ we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved and in this day when everything else is falling we have a Sol Foundation the Lord Jesus Christ come into it friends it's a shelter in a time of storm what a marvelous things he's seen all this coming to pass we see the Jews now the Bible said that Jerusalem and it would Blossom as the rose and how they have irrigated that land and they also the prophet spoke and said that day that water will come from the north there was no water there then no springs there then but in the last few years there's a gusher come up and water in the valleys and they're irrigating as one of the greatest agricultural spots for its size in the world Amen praise the Lord and all these great chemicals right in the Dead Sea there's enough chemicals found in the bottom of it all the wealth of the world couldn't buy amen of chemicals uranium and everything else right in the bottom of the Dead Sea which now belongs to Israel fig tree putting for this bug not only that but the other trees are putting forth its bugs amen the Communist is putting forth bugs the Antichrist is putting forth bud and the Church of God is putting forth bud Hallelujah she's blooming out into her power again the polymer worm eat part of it the canker worm eat part of it the hookworm eat part of it the caterpillar eat part of it but God said it'll live again she's putting forth buds now the trees are putting forth bugs Daniel fora it and rejoiced now at this time he said and at that time the 12th chapter and at that time shall Michael hand up the great Prince that standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such was never since there was a nation even to that time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book oh my aren't you glad your name is on his book amen what he Daniel over here saw him come to the Ancient of Days whose hair was as white as wool and they opened up the books and they were judged every man out of the books the great white Throne judgment now Daniel is given this assurance at the end of the Gentile dispensation read the when you go home in thear read the 11th chapter you can see how the King of the North is coming down which is nothing else but Russia coming down to press against it like a whirlwind and the great battle of army geddon will be fought right there near the Gates of Jerusalem notice oh I love this and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that's been found written in the book the Lamb's Book of Life Michael the great Prince shall stand up for what our people amen all right and many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake when when these times take place and some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contentment just ass sure there's an everlasting life there's an everlasting departures amen it determines on how you treat Jesus Christ in your life amen if you love him and born again he got his Spirit you got everlasting life if you don't you have not everlasting life if your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life you have Immortal Life if it's not written there you'll not be recognized what is it all those prophecies are fulfilled everything right down to this time the head of go has passed away as Daniel said it would the Babylonian Kingdom succeeding that he said would be the Ms and persas they succeeded the Babylonian kingom and they fell away to who the grecians Alexander the Great and they fell away to what the Romans and the Romans broke up to all the world eastern and western Rome the two leges and he said Iron and Clay was on the toes the 10 toes the 10 kingdoms and he said they wer mixing at inary among one another romanism and protestantism and in that day when this thing exists then the stone was shoot out of the mountain without hands and rolled in it broke the thing to pieces and it took the place of the image so my brethren we're having troubles tonight Wars rumors of wars earthquakes and diverse places perplex of time distress between nations I I've just come back from overseas and I haven't seen a nation but what's trembling in their shoes they don't know what's going to take place next but aren't we thankful tonight that we do know what's going to take place next the Lord Jesus Christ shall come the second time and Glory every to written in the Lamb's Book of Life shall rise with their loved ones to meet the Lord oh what a marvelous thing that's the reason we say our hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood with righteousness All Around My Soul gives away he's our hope and stain and at that time Michael should stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and Michael fought together or fought against each other rather and now and at that time he said as many was found written in the book what was delivered and those who have done righteous watch this and they that and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the further and as the and they that turn away man your righteousness as the Stars forever I look at that sometime I think Brethren I go out of morning I love to get up early don't you like to rise early I remember when brother and I were in the mountains real early in the morning around 4:00 we'd rise up look hanging back there and there was the Morning Star it gets real dark just before the break of day we see the darkness Gathering now what is it it's light pressing against the darkness one has to give away all the creepy things that's been running through the night when that sun comes up they take the shelter when the light shines night and dark night and light cannot exist in the same building it's either dark or it's light and light is so much more powerful in darkness so is Christ so much more powerful in all the enemies of the world Amen now we're taught by scientists as the light begins to come it condenses the darkness and the Darkness gathers all its host together to fight against the light but the light prevails and comes on Amen and the Bible said in the last days that Satan go back like a roar lion he's gathered today all of his enemies all of his friends our enemies and congregating them together heaping up under a big head the mark of the beast Amen in the ecclesiastical Realms the confederation of churches all uniting and making thems a great Arc organization as same as Catholicism and the world Empires are uniting themselves together and forming up a big head over there in the political rims called communism and the light of God is pressing on what's Happening the same time to make it that Christian Church the Church of the Living God is being anointed Power is

congregating his forces Confederation churches trying to stop it amen saying they're nothing but a bunch of noise boxes there's nothing to them it's all fanaticism there's no such a thing as working in the Supernatural at the same time the head of the American Medical Association writes a piece in the paper he said no man's got right to come into a sick room to minister to the people don't believe in almighty God and accept him as his help the Christian Harold interviewing doctors last month gave write ups that I couldn't write myself if I was trying to brag on him what is it in the midst of everything God will cause his enemies to testify to his glory yes sir Hallelujah Glory the doctor said we can only administer a but God is the Healer I said them great men just finding out

this Earth and take them home in the Rapture it may be too late it may be too late for many at that day Michael shall stand for the people oh he ain't standing for the Nations he standing for the people amen and many those that sleep in the dust of the earth some shall rise to Everlasting shame and contentment but those that be wise and turn many to righteous shall shine as the Stars forever and ever hallelujah hallelujah our why should I care they're building a palace me over there come over to see me someday what is it I walked down and looked at that great morning star as she begins to
