very source of our life and without you lord we can't do nothing father I pray that as we approach your word may you minister to every heart in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray Let each one receive their portion in Jesus name amen so God bless you we like to go right into the word we had a little cond order and doctrine that we have been taking and sister Norma I she asked about communion a little bit and I was going to bring that anyways in um in that order of things um and so in First Corinthians 11 we like to go for our scripture reading and this is a subject that I have spoken on many times here at the church typically on a communion service and what it does is it just brings the importance of what it is into a greater light so in 1 Corinthians 11 we like to turn there quickly I want to thank you all for your prayers as I as you all heard the passing of my brother Jay on Sunday evening the Lord called him home and you know I was just getting ready for service I was in set right down right there to hear the tape and just got through worshiping which just so relaxed and just a good atmosphere listening to the prophet and I got that text in those news and his time of death was death was 457 right before our service started and um I thought well that's what I want to be doing when the Lord calls me home I want to be in church somewhere getting ready to hear somebody preach or maybe I'm about to preach myself and and just call me on home Lord and that's the way you know life happens that way and so that's the way the Lord called him home and I I was I thank the Lord that um he has given us a peace during these times amen so God bless you thank you so much for your prayers I can feel those prayers and for me I I process things if I keep moving forward then I just get things done and that's how I go so you say brother is well take a break if I take a break you might not like me so let me keep doing doing what I do that's what works for me all right so pray for me thank you so much in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse says number one says Be You followers of me even as I also am of Christ now I Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as I delivered them to you may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated so we took conduct order and Doctrine and under order Sister Jesse L so good to have you back man we would have put you to work for sure but uh brother Zach jumped right in did a wonderful job tonight and we appreciate that brother Zach amen amen so that's the way it goes in Ministry just instant in season and out the season so the order um conduct order and Doctrine order under ordinances we would just take it like that that um we talked about The Gatekeepers and the officers and like even on our board they are called officers of the board and the Army and the military have these titles and headings for leaders and Leadership but under the order and ordinances uh one of the things that has been established into the to the church is this communion service and um not just the communion the foot washing and brother random ties in water baptism now this what we do today is the we're looking back at the shadow which was in Exodus chapter 12 when the Lord was delivering Israel um from the great Exodus there he had them to kill a lamb at midnight and all the remains of the Lamb were not to remain for the next day and that's a a type of what we do as we burn that which remains in the communion service and the importance of it is that every believer um should take this order and this communion service brother the random calls at the sweetest one of the sweetest services in the Christian church and you know it's interesting how many have over the ages or over time and we've seen it in churches that that Wednesday night service and the communion service sometimes many times are the the least attended service and um part of that could be just the fear or just the the condemnation associated with it some people feel like they're not worthy enough to take the communion and um definitely Jesus gives us the or the or the Apostle Paul says that let a man examine himself before doing that because he that eateth and drinketh eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself but we do understand that the early Christian Church partook of the Lord's suff every time they met and so if you're not worthy enough this Sunday you're probably not gonna be worthy enough next Sunday either because you're not looking at it right that's right because we'll never be worthy enough let's just settle that none of us are even worthy to open the book or even look at it but he made a way for us to be worthy that we can take it with confidence not looking at ourselves but we're looking at the sacrifice that was paid for our sins and so in first number 23 in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 have your Bibles we can read that it says for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me can you all help me read this let's all take verse 26 all the way through not too fast but just but loud and but not too fast let's all read together like good fivey olds can do all right or 10 year olds at least alog together verse 26 for I this bread drink cup wherefor of [Music] and himself judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together to condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come and that's what we're talking about order what I'd like to see uh brother George and brother Joe and all the saints of the most high god what I would love to see is a communion service crowd look like a Sunday morning crowd that would be beautiful that your Wednesday night your Sunday night service would look just like a Sunday morning service and this communion service has a type and their strengths that are woven into it and so we'll take a few quotes on this what the prophet of God says about the apostles that when they came together every time paragraph number 53 in the message questions and answers he says the apostles who was the preachers they continually steadfast in their doctrine of breaking of bread communion and in Fellowship and in prayer then if that cuts out communion from the Apostle it also cuts out prayer from the apostles see now let's just read on see that was a doctrine of the Apostles of the early church that every time they came together they taken communion every time now I know you Christian people who got the Christian church the calite church as we know it as because there's two of them one is the Church of Christ the other one the calite church you say we take it every Sunday morning we got the scriptures on it you have better scriptures on it than the brandham Tabernacle does the brandham Tabernacle takes it once a month but the scripture is that as of as you come together that's right every time and so that was the early Christian church and he's applauding the camelite church that they take it every service every time they meet they would take it together and I don't want this to be well if a church isn't taking it every 30 days then they're wrong uh the brandom Tabernacle did it once a month that's the pattern that we follow we take it once a month uh as the Lord would provide for us there I know some Churches take it once a year I think it's Jehovah Witnesses have a memorial service once a year that nobody partakes of it because it's only for the 144,000 so they'll take that those elements they'll pass it all the way through their whole crowd it could be 200 could be a thousand or their great memorial service and no one will partake of it because that's only for the 144,000 and if you happen to be visiting with them and you partake of it they'll probably roll their eyes at you because oh no that's just for the 144,000 when I first heard that the the man at the paint store that was my rep he to he's Jehovah Witness and he told me that and I said have you in your lifetime ever seen anybody part take of it and he's been a Jehovah Witness most of his life he said he saw one or two partake of the Lord's supper and I said have you ever heard of somebody partaking and they backslid in the Jehovah wi he says yeah I says well they kind of got that wrong didn't they I thought it was only 144,000 so in years from now there's no original 144,000 left on the earth so it's just a memorial service and nobody partakes of it um but but it was every time that the Christ the early Christian Church partook of it and um brother bam continues in the message desperations and he says this in paragraph 193 so he's praying for the elements and he says this sanctify the wine for its intended purpose May whoever drinks this wine tonight and takes of this bread have strength for the journey that lays ahead granted Lord may they be healthy and strong and filled with your spirit till Jesus come I believe that communion is one of the most solemn sacred sweetest worships there is in the church service there was two things left us three things to do that's orders and ordinances so many people try to say we got the original nail we got a piece of the Cross but there was three things left Lord's Supper baptism feet washing was the three orders that was left to the church so now brother banam is highlighting the sweetness of a communion service what does that really mean what is the antitype as we're partaking of the element the the bread and the wine um what is it looking back to well it's looking back to Exodus chap 12 when they're getting ready to leave on a tremendous journey and this journey would require Grace and strength to live and go through the Wilderness and so the Lord prepares them now I I'm certain that the Hebrews partaking of the lamb and the the indication of somebody would die if it's not done properly I'm sure they didn't understand all the types and shadows of it I'm sure they didn't understand that their clothes would never wear down and their strength would never Abate them I'm sure they there's many of them didn't understand it but they were just following the message that God gave Moses and later as the journey continued on we see the blessing of why this stayed with them it started at that memory that memorial service it started at this entrance in uh to this journey so brother Adam uses that in his prayer many times in the communion service journey journey journeying Grace Grace for the journey and many times he includes Lord may they be healthy and strong may they be strong and and and it it requires strength to serve the Lord it requires an unknown strength it's not just mind power it's not just knowing what's right but it takes a strength to serve the Lord the scripture tells us to be strong in the Lord and the power of His might where does strength come from strength comes from the Lord and he lays out simple things for us to do we talked about it Sunday morning about reading your Bible and praying every there's a strength taking place spiritually as you read the word of God It's Supernatural it's above our ideas or our thought process you can't figure it out just do it because he said to do it and God will bless you yes sir and look at the old saints that did it you look at the old saints that are still around and you'll see that they typically have a beautiful Church attendance and more more likely than not they're very faithful at the communion service I've watched that and you look around and you see that you see the kind of the families that are struggling they're here and there they're kind of in and out that kind of goes right along with have you been washing the Saints feet have you been taking the Lord's supper and then yet you they have all these issues and problems with this family and that one and that Doctrine and this issue and that and work issues and they won't even they're not doing the simple things that he commanded us to do and it starts right there paragraph 36 in the message living dying buried Rising coming prophet of God says this here I'm sorry let's let's not take that let's take let's take this one here in the message communion the last uh message here 1965 here in two paragraph number 76 he says this here this stuck out to me when he when I first heard him say this he says when we take this it shows to the church that I believe every word of God I believe that he is the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I believe every word that he says is the truth and I believe by it to the best of my knowledge God being my judge therefore before my brothers before my sisters I do not swear I do not curse I do not do these things because I love the Lord and the Lord knows it and bears me record therefore before you I take the parcel of his body to know that I'm not condemned with the world so there you are then it's a blessing and remember I can give many testimonies on this where I took and explained it in the sick room and seen them healed remember when Israel taking this type the type of this they Journey 40 years in the wilderness and their clothes never even wore out they come out without one feeble one one among them with two million people as a type of this well what would the anti-type do if the body of the sacrificial animal did that for them what would the body of Jesus Christ Emmanuel do for us let's just be reverent when we come let us be just as reverent as we know how to come so this communion it shows to the church that I believe every word when you partake of the bread it shows that I believe every word and this is the goal of the believer remember I was sharing with you one of the outside emotions outward actions of someone's spirituality is there con an uh uh attendance to the house of God when the doors are open they're there well communion would kind of go into that spirituality of a person as well just knowing a person like if I came into the city for the first time and normally it's not a weekday it's usually weekend special meetings and you see a church you don't really get the temperature of the church but if I was to ask the pastor who in here actually takes communion and that would be enough for me to know how spiritual they are how serious they are because it's easy to set back I won't say it's easy but it's it's I've seen people set back and miss the communion service service seemingly they miss it on purpose because it's been announced we know it's going to be there and I I have to say our church here we seem like there's a great attendance on Sunday night wouldn't you all say that I'm really pleased I think it's beautiful I've been to many churches and that communion service it it thins out the crowd many times or Wednesday night but you know it's an outward it's an outward um indication what what would you say if one of the brothers on the board that's serving you didn't take communion wouldn't that be a question mark it's not that he ain't saved it's not a Salvation issue but it does put a question in his spirituality is he handling the word with the seriousness that it's been given to us so these are outward indications not to go around judging folks but I am looking at you and you're looking at me too that's right and if I ran in here late every service or I'm out there chatting it up with everybody in the parking lot then I run up here and try to scramble and get my notes together and then the service ain't right then y'all looking at me right I wouldn't have confidence in that right and so what about any other office what about any other believer all right so brother random says in the message contest I'm G try to keep this very very short paragraph number seven he says Lord Jesus Oh the battle will be over someday and there will be no more sick to be prayed for and there'll be no more Sinners to repent but father while this day is what it is let us work work while we have light to work in for the hour cometh with no man can work now just for a few moments Lord I feel bad if I didn't close off this year without saying a few more words he continues on help me father I pray that was in the contest I'm sorry I hope I got that right help me father I pray that I might say something that would plant courage in the heart of thy people that we could leave here tonight after taking the communion and realize that in the communion there is strength see the weak Christians and then you become more weak when you don't take it that the communion realize that in the communion there is strength Israel took the communion first down in Egypt walked 40 years without their shoes wearing out their clothes getting threadbear and out of two milon people there wasn't a feeble one among them when they come out of the Wilderness Lord let us remember that tonight as we approach this great hour in Jesus name we pray amen paragraph 59 in the message contest he says this thank you Father now sanctify the wine for its intended use and may every person that partakes of this Sacrament tonight receive spiritual and physical strength for the journey that lays ahead where we ask it in Jesus name Amen Let Us bow our heads now while we bless this wine our heavenly father when I think as I hold this wine here that represents the blood of Jesus how that through that flowing blood my sins are gone they are put in the sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no more with this Blood a dying boy one day laid Yonder in the hospital and you saved me oh God how I thank thee Lord and then give me the charge by the Holy Spirit to lead the people to Calvary and show them the way home thank you Father now sanctify this wine for its attended use May every person that partakes of this sacrite Sacrament tonight receive spiritual and physical strength for the journey that lays ahead that's a powerful prayer how many need spiritual strength but how many can use some physical strength too so many people are just tired just The Daily Grind is tiring and you just need strength Lord give me strength that I can be where you want me to be and that strength is in that communion service I want us to look at it that way like going to the gym and working out is going to help you physically but spiritually taking the communion this is going to help you physically and spiritually all right paragraph 73 in the message ordination brother branam says this do you know that communion has Divine Healing in it yes when the Israelites and the type took the communion and March 40 years and when they come out of the Wilderness there wasn't a feeble one among them two and a half million people there is power of healing in the communion so why wouldn't we want to receive that how many's ever been healed in the communion service see the hands see that and now when it's taught and you read these quotations doesn't that help your faith when you take it now it really shows you what's taking place it's not just you know form every month but there's there's strength in it and you're showing to the entire church that I believe every word it's a testimony to the rest of the Believers that are watching that are gathered around it is part of our service paragraph 135 in G in the message communion 1962 most holy God whose servants we are in the name of Jesus Christ sanctify this bread for its intended use to to make us as we receive it remember that our Lord was crucified and his body precious and holy as it was was mingled with stripes and thorns and nails for us that through his Riven body came forth the spirit that gives us eternal life may we lord as we eat this have journeying Grace as Israel did 40 years in the wilderness not a feeble one among them Father God grant this as we pray you sanctify this bread kosher bread for its intended use in Jesus name amen the cup of the New Testament the blood I think of that song ever since by faith I saw that stream thy flowing wound Supply redeeming love has been my theme and shall be till I die when I see this Blood grapes the blood of grapes I know it represents the blood that came forth from the Lord Jesus body May every May ever who receives this have eternal life may sickness depart out of their bodies May weariness and feebleness oppression May the devil in every form leave them that they might have great strength and health and eternal life to let their life light shine before for this wicked and adulterous generation we live in to the glory of God Amen so when it's presented as optional that's how people will take it as optional but when it's presented that this is an ordinance that God has laid out for a church that any man that's coming to Christ as he grows spiritually he's going to find himself partaking of the Lord's Supper it's part of the experience as I certainly appreciate the burden brother will has for the folks on the reservation and you know you you see the little group coming together around the word and then you know you you'll know there's growth not when the numbers come but what but when the Believers start to ask for another service when the prayer meeting there's people that actually show up for that now everybody's not going to show up for a prayer meeting but when you make it Ava ailable there's somebody that's looking forward to that and and as a young man being raised up in the churches and the different churches I've been through in my life the prayer meeting was a Lifeline for me I needed one during the week to come in I loved it I I appreciated it and I know there's many Believers that do not all people will not all people see the importance of it but but when you make it available two or three that's all you need that's right that's it we can have church and God will bless us period he said it in his word this is not a guest this is not a hope so he said I'll be there and he's he's going to bless that and if it's in his will others will catch on and they will come too and then you move forward and then you want to see those believers get to the place where they can take the Lord's Supper in communion and the foot washing and you want to see those Believers receive the Holy Ghost amen and so you know like you you star in a church you don't have deacons you don't have officers you don't have a lot of things so you start somewhere I think the greatest thing you start with is the word of God you stay with that word you preach that word and then let the Lord bless that and then prayer meeting you can never pray tooo much offer that prayer meeting during the week whatever however and God will bless it and that's what we like to see for every believer in every little group amen because we know what's going on we know that physical and spiritual strength is taking place when I do this I want to be 90 years old if the Lord help me and be able to take the Lord's Supper amen that would be beautiful don't you think yes we have a few in our midst that we we serve it to over 90 sister wheeler sister what's the other sister's name your grandmother great grandmother sister Lucille these these folks that are interested in that and I thank the Lord for it so paragraph 190 I think brother uh brother Al Peterson took it with us when he was in his 90s he would still come to the house of the Lord said that's me right there praise the Lord if the Lord helped me I want to be a old guy in the house of the Lord don't you if the Lord carries amen paragraph 190 in this message the comforter brother random says this now we're coming to the communion table to take those Parcels that was left us in order this do until he returns well thank for these things father and we pray that in jesus' name that if there be a feeble person among us tonight that comes to this communion table Lord I can just see that shaking old mother of mine walking up the owl there the last time she was in here to take that communion how her little old trembling hand shook over that plate I stood here and watched her with tears dropping in my heart but there she lays tonight facing Calvary oh God how thankful I am you said he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I'll raise him up again at the last day amen now so we see the importance of the communion amen we see that there's strength in there so let's just take a few quotations I think I have a little more time on on this tering and brother Ram talks about Terry the scripture talks about wherefore you come together Terry one for another 1 Corinthians 11:33 and the prophet of God says this let's see if I got it right now it said I don't think I gave you this one sis but I'm sure you can find it this is in communion 1963 July the 7th now it said when you come together Terry one for the other and that really would be like this Terry one with the other Terry means to wait wait on each other and let's do that now I'll pray for you if you know anything that you've done wrong say God forgive me if you know anything that you've done wrong say God forgive me I didn't mean that and if you'll help me from this night on I won't do it again I mean it Lord I won't do it again if you'll just forgive me and upon my confession I believe you have forgiv me I go to take the body of Christ filling in my heart that you forgive me for all my sin I pray then I pray then for your secret sin you pray for mine that may be something we don't know about that we won't come together condemned with the world we don't want the world in here this little spot up people that God has give us to worship with here we want to keep ourselves clean from selfishness keep our thing our sin Our Lives clean from all things of the world that we be not spotted with that we want to be ready for the Rapture so let us pray now silently for one another just you pray for me as I pray for you then there's silence for 31 seconds followed by Brother Bram praying so this brings this t carrying into it's not just me it's us you're praying for me and I'm praying for you maybe you did something you can't see maybe I did something Lord forgive her forgive him help them Lord help her help us we're all praying that's tering with one another it's not selfish it's a family affair it's a church body Affair that we t one for another and I love his prayer in there is Lord there's a promise Lord I won't do it again forgive me for my wrongs from this day forward I won't do it again how many's ever have to pray that prayer every human being that's a Christian has had to ask God to forgive them and so this is where we carry one for another brother random gives a number of examples for that now let's take a scripture on the foot washing just for a moment as we prepare to to close but in St John chapter 13 it's quite clear that many of the organizations and denominations just flat out don't wash feet anymore but it was actually one of the requirements for a church to take a widow in is did she wash the Saints feet was she a part of that service is that part of her do she have that humility and that care and that giving but in verse number two it says and supper being ended the devil having now put in the heart of Judas the scariot Simon his son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he rised from supper he laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself now there's this you know uh let me stop here just for a moment so here's the order that we do we partake of the elements The Bread and Wine and then we go into the foot washing and I've heard it among some of the brothers that it really should be the other way around we should wash feet first and then partake of the elements because of the time slau or the way things were but you know the prophet didn't bring it that way so why we why would we want to change that and so it's like okay whatever order you decide to do it in I like to follow the way the prophet did it and the way the scriptures have it laid out here but he rised from supper he laid aside His Garment and he took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin he began to wash the disciples feet and to Wi them with the towel wherewith he was guard GED then cometh he the Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus answered him and said it's okay Peter you don't have to wash my feet you don't you took the communion it's not that important you know your feet are probably clean anyways what's the big deal uh that's not what Jesus said what he saying it's pretty strong what Jesus tells him what does Jesus tell him Jesus said if I wash thee not thou has has no part with me it seems humble for Peter to say Lord I don't want you to wash my feet it seems humble but real humility is following the word word yes sir because you're humbling yourself to the word first now it might look honorable it might look humble but if the word gives you a commandment that's what you're supposed to do see I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to take communion you know that's only for you know g no nobody is worthy well if the word tells you to take it then you should humble yourself to what the word says it's not about your feelings of how you feel whether you're worthy or not is what does the word say and ultimately we humble ourselves to the word amen and that's the beauty of it is that Jesus laid this example for us and so he continues and Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is wash needeth not safe to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him verse 13 know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have wash your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet why for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord so if the Lord do it it so can't the servant do it too I've given you an example so the churches that don't do it what can they do with this scripture they have to say it doesn't mean that today well if this doesn't mean that then what other scriptures don't mean that either like John 3:16 if you know these things happy are ye if you do then see the happiness now yes sir you see the oppression and the depression and all the stress you see how that relieves in a communion service you see where the strength is you see where the obedience is Happy are ye if you do them now brother an makes this statement here in the message ordination I think brother Joe had this in one of the pamphlets and it just really struck me even more a couple of months ago in paragraph 89 in the message ordination 1962 I think I read some other quotes out of the same message actually I think that I think that is one of the most beautiful verses I have given you an examp example that you should do as I have done unto you we should do to each other in commemoration this it's been a practice of the Church of this group of people Gatherings ever since we began and before this Tabernacle was ever built when we were yet in a cottage prayer meetings we practiced feet washing our sisters go to the room in the back our Brethren go to the room in the right and we observe feet washing strangers if you're with us tonight we're only happy to have you Fellowship in this ordinances of God I might explain as I said a few moments ago the thing that God left for us to do water baptism one article communion and remember that's only two God is perfected in three feet washing is the third see and remember that years later even in the Bible some people try to say it's not necessary certainly I don't mean to say that people's feet need washing that isn't it maybe theirs didn't did not either but it was an act of humility it's an act of doing just as essential as water baptism because he said here that I have given you an example that you should do to each other as I have done to you and we find out that a widow could not be brought in among the people unless she had large strangers and had washed the feet of the Saints showing ourselves humble that if anything that we want to be is humble because that's the secret to power is through humility and you're always happy when you come out of these things of doing them it's a blessed order of Fellowship that we observe here at the church so you see the power in the humility the power and the strength of taking the bread and the cup and the wine you see the strength the happiness the the oppression the the the feebleness said let there not be one feeble one Among Us these are one of the orders that are Bible Church a true believing Church a true believing Believers as brother Brandon said as essential as water baptism he equates foot washing to water baptism did we all just read that read it one more time that isn't it maybe theirs didn't either paragraph 91 some people try to say it's not necessary certainly I don't mean to say that people's feet need washing that isn't it maybe theirs did not either but it was an act of humility it's it's an act of doing just as essential as water baptism because he said here that I've given you an example that you should do to each other as I have done to you how can you be proud after you got through washing somebody's feet I mean the big wig washing somebody's feet it's an act of humility it's not about their feet are clean or not it was the act of humility and what comes with humility power exactly when you can humble yourself to the word and do what the word says to do that's where power lies not how loud you shout how good you can preach run up the floor dress the best this and that remember the quotes remember the scriptures I'll argue anybody but can't take communion can't wash the Saint's feet as essential as water baptism and so with those important details being being brought out when we come to the table of the Lord our faith now is increased and I had the Lord touch me as I shared with the church that time when we went on that that sub Sunset trip that hike and I came back and we took the communion that night and all the pains just left my body and I was thinking about that Lord I need strength and I was a partaking of it because I went through these quotes and I was claiming that Lord I'm coming to another communion service I need strength physical strength I need spiritual strength a need is heavy on me it's weary it's hard you know every time you get a phone call you don't know brother isra can I talk to you about something he's like uh is this a praise or I'm gonna be crying after this what kind of phone call is I'm serious now what kind of phone call is this brother is can I talk to you for a minute like uh oh am I in trouble or somebody got something they want to praise the Lord about you just don't know so you liveing this jaded but I'm so glad that he give you the strength to answer all the text yes yes how may I help you praise the Lord amen amen y'all know what I'm talking about yes but it takes strength to serve the Lord and I want to be faithful and taking these elements as long as the Lord gives me strength to do it and there's a journey in Grace in there amen so God bless you richly those are one of the orders and the ordinances that's left to to the church God bless you I apologize I had my notes in another deal and it looked like it got almost got erased but I had it backed up on my phone so
