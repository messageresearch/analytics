[31:37] all of the teams put together for making
[31:39] sure that everything went smoothly um me

[31:47] but it worked out just great amen so if
[31:50] you have a chance to thank her and
[31:53] sister uh Barbara and sister um
[31:57] Elisa sister Alisa opened her home at
[32:00] the end of the services to some of the
[32:03] visiting pastors there we certainly
[32:05] appreciate that
[32:07] amen so thank you brother Chris he said
[32:11] amen and I'm sure you all thank them
[32:14] good to see you brother will I know you
[32:16] have a birthday coming up but this this
[32:19] message here really struck my heart I
[32:20] was listening to it yesterday and I want
[32:23] to turn into it paragraph number
[32:29] 191 if the sister can get it there I'm
[32:33] going to move this my care over yellow
[32:35] one
[32:45] here and
[32:50] uh brother brandom I don't generally
[32:54] read a quote from the message we're
[32:55] listening to sometimes I'll read
[32:57] afterwards but this really stood out to
[32:59] me from this message as I was listening
[33:03] to it and I'll tell you why
[33:08] um message respects paragraph 191 just
[33:12] to show you how easy we
[33:15] could speak things that we shouldn't
[33:18] speak I was in The Minister's meeting
[33:21] earlier this year or or just a few
[33:23] months ago actually and um one of the
[33:27] brothers had these were pastors that we
[33:30] were speaking together and one of the
[33:32] brothers had brought
[33:34] up brother Coleman if you all know
[33:37] brother Joseph Coleman he um started a a
[33:42] movement with it's called the seven
[33:45] Thunders and they're still in a group of
[33:47] Brethren that follow what he teaches and
[33:50] they they look to him as what they call
[33:52] a chief a chief Apostle and he was an
[33:55] apostle he established churches and so
[33:58] forth and whether we agree or disagree
[34:00] with him that's another another thing
[34:04] but his name came
[34:06] up and the brother
[34:09] said cuz he knew brother Coleman he says
[34:12] well what brother Coleman is preaching
[34:14] is nothing but a bunch of emotions and I
[34:17] was just sitting there and I I kind of
[34:20] semi agreed with it I didn't agree with
[34:22] it I just kind of heard what he had to
[34:25] say and I but I want you to listen to
[34:27] this quote or hear the or read this
[34:29] quote and we'll hear it just now brother
[34:31] B says when we receive the Holy Ghost is
[34:35] not shaking hands with the pastor
[34:38] receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving
[34:41] Christ into you because he is God's
[34:43] messenger of the day the Holy Ghost is
[34:46] God's messenger and we must respect him
[34:49] when he comes don't say he he he look at
[34:53] that woman shouting there and crying
[34:55] crying tears running down her cheeks
[34:58] look at that man there shaking his hands
[35:00] and trembling and crying you know what
[35:03] that is that's a bunch of worked up
[35:05] emotion you're blaspheming the Holy
[35:08] Ghost You' got to respect that and so it
[35:11] just happen so easily just in common
[35:14] conversation and like I say I was with
[35:16] pastors and the brother specifically
[35:18] said that he said that's just a bunch of
[35:20] worked up emotion and you just got to be
[35:23] careful with that I mean you might not
[35:25] agree with the brothers or pastors or
[35:28] whoever but don't you say stuff against
[35:31] people shaking or rolling or whatever
[35:34] they're doing and they call it the Holy
[35:35] Ghost just leave it alone serve the Lord
[35:38] with all of your heart because you don't
[35:40] want to be guilty you don't know the
[35:42] Holy Spirit Works in all of those groups
[35:45] all of them yes Jehovah Witnesses
[35:48] Baptist he works amongst all of them
[35:51] because he's got a bride that he's
[35:53] calling out and we don't know who those
[35:55] people are so this this message just
[35:57] really struck me like whoa I need to be
[36:00] more respectful towards everyone my wife
[36:03] my children the ministry the groups I
[36:06] agree with and the ones I disagree with
[36:08] okay amen so let's stand to our feet and
[36:10] we'll go right into this message
[36:12] paragraph number
[36:13] 44 through
[36:17] 26 brother Bram will be reading from the
[36:19] scripture Psalms 105 and Ecclesiastes
[36:23] chapter 12 if you want to have your
[36:26] Bible ready let's sing only

[38:03] long tonight maybe 30 minutes or 40 upon
[38:07] a little subject here that I would like
[38:10] to first read a scripture found in the
[38:13] book of Psalms Psalms
[38:16] 105 and reading down to the 15th verse
[38:21] inclusive while I read this Psalm I want
[38:24] you to listen real close to the reading
[38:26] of the word because God's word will
[38:29] never
[38:30] fail oh give thanks unto the Lord call
[38:35] upon his name make known his deeds among
[38:38] the people I just think of that give
[38:42] thanks unto the Lord call upon his name
[38:45] make known his deeds among the
[38:48] People Sing unto him sing Psalms unto
[38:53] him talk ye of his wondrous work
[38:58] glory in His holy name let the hearts of
[39:02] them that Rejoice that seek the Lord
[39:06] seek the Lord and his strength seek his
[39:10] faith everm more remember His Marvelous
[39:13] works that he has done his wonders and
[39:16] his Judgment of his mouth oh ye Seed of
[39:21] Abraham his servant ye children of Jacob
[39:25] his chosen
[39:27] he is the Lord Our God his judgments are
[39:30] in all the
[39:32] Earth he has remembered his Covenant
[39:35] forever the word which he commanded to a
[39:38] thousand
[39:40] Generations which Covenant he made with
[39:43] Abraham and his oath unto Isaac and
[39:46] confirm the same unto Jacob for a law
[39:49] and to Israel for an Everlasting
[39:52] Covenant
[39:54] saying unto thee will I give give the
[39:56] land of Canaan the lot of your
[40:01] inheritance when they that
[40:05] when when they were but a few men in
[40:08] number yay very few and strangers in it
[40:13] when they went forth from one nation to
[40:17] another and from one Kingdom to another
[40:20] he suffered no man to do them wrong
[40:24] Hallelujah yay he prove Kings for their
[40:28] sake saying touch not my anointed and do
[40:32] my prophets no harm
[40:36] Hallelujah I want to take a a subject
[40:39] from there of
[40:44] respects reading here David crying out
[40:47] to the
[40:48] Lord
[40:50] respects is what we owe to
[40:53] God and that's one thing that I would
[40:56] like like to uh drill this to the heart
[40:59] of every person here tonight that in all
[41:04] things that we see going on we must give
[41:06] respect to
[41:08] it we must respect
[41:11] it and David said that when there were
[41:15] very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham
[41:18] Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very
[41:22] few men that he rebuked Nations and
[41:25] kings KS for them God rebuked the
[41:28] Nations and Kings saying touch not my
[41:31] anointed and do my prophets no
[41:33] harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th
[41:36] chapter and the 13th verse it's written
[41:39] like this see let us Shar the conclusion
[41:42] of the whole matter fear God and keep
[41:45] his Commandments for this is the full
[41:47] duty of man the conclusion of the whole
[41:50] matter is to fear
[41:52] God and when you cannot have respect un
[41:56] until you have fear you've got to have
[41:59] fear of God Solomon said also in the
[42:02] Proverbs that the fear of God is the
[42:06] beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God
[42:10] is the beginning of wisdom now that
[42:13] don't mean that you're afraid of him but
[42:15] that means that you're giving him
[42:17] respects and
[42:18] reverence and when you respect God you
[42:22] fear God you fear that you might
[42:24] displease him in some way
[42:26] you fear L you would do something wrong
[42:29] you wouldn't want to I fear my mother I
[42:33] fear my my wife I fear my church I fear
[42:37] all of God's servants unless I should
[42:39] put a stumming box somewhere in their
[42:41] way I I fear the people I fear the
[42:44] people of the city unless I should do
[42:47] something wrong that would cause them to
[42:49] think that I wasn't a Christian see
[42:52] you've got before you can have respect
[42:55] you've got to have fear here and God
[42:58] demands it he demands
[43:01] respect God does he demands it and fear
[43:05] brings it and we know that fear brings
[43:09] respects now you take for instance a man
[43:12] he's a farmer or maybe he's a a shop
[43:15] worker and uh nobody pays any attention
[43:17] to him but let him get a job on the
[43:19] police force and come down the street as
[43:23] a a policeman with his badge and uniform
[43:25] on or maybe someone wouldn't speak to
[43:28] him the day before hello there John how
[43:30] are you see why is it it's kind of an
[43:32] awe our fear our
[43:35] respect because of it maybe he gets
[43:37] elected to be the mayor of the city or
[43:40] maybe who would President Kennedy
[43:42] tonight be if he wasn't President
[43:44] Kennedy what if he was just a same man
[43:47] he is but yet he was a worker worked at
[43:49] col Gates down here for uh $40 a week
[43:52] see he'd come through the city here and
[43:54] nobody would pay much attention to him
[43:56] on his own Associates but being he's a
[43:57] president of the United States he
[43:59] deserves a respect you see and that and
[44:02] because that God is
[44:04] God he deserves a respect that's right
[44:08] Hallelujah and he we've got to respect
[44:11] him and give a fear to him and that
[44:12] brings respect God has demanded that for
[44:15] himself and for all his
[44:18] servants God demands respect for his
[44:21] servants he uh his servants how we know
[44:24] that they're his servants because he
[44:26] vindicates these servants by his word he
[44:30] takes these servants and makes them
[44:33] Servants of God and proves that they are
[44:35] servants by making his word work through
[44:38] them servants then as you respect that
[44:40] servant you respect God so when I
[44:43] respect you and you respect me and we
[44:45] respect each other then we're respecting
[44:48] God did not Jesus say in so much as you
[44:50] have done at the least of these my
[44:52] little ones you have done it unto me and
[44:54] it would be better for you that a
[44:56] millstone was hanged at your neck and
[44:58] you were drowned in the depths of sea
[44:59] than to offend one of them where I say
[45:02] you behold their FA Angels always
[45:04] beholds my father's face which is in
[45:06] heaven now we know that they are that we
[45:10] being children of God that we are a part
[45:13] of God and God demands this respect then
[45:18] God shows who his children are he he
[45:21] shows it by wonders and signs and that
[45:24] it's being done now now we're going to
[45:26] start now and call into question some of
[45:29] these
[45:30] people now if I was going to say for one
[45:33] to start with I think of of let's take
[45:36] Noah for a moment now Noah had a
[45:39] revelation from God yet it was contrary
[45:42] to anything that science would prove to
[45:44] be true but yet he had spoke to God and
[45:48] God had spoke to him and he went about
[45:51] preparing an ark where the scoffers and
[45:54] mockers as the Bible says said that they
[45:56] would be in the last days like it was in
[45:58] them days that those
[46:00] scoffers scoffed at Noah while they
[46:03] thought that he was out of his head
[46:05] because he was building an ark so but
[46:09] God brought judgment upon them
[46:13] scoffers because they would not listen
[46:15] to the messenger of God and come into
[46:20] that Ark under his preaching then God
[46:23] sent his Divine judgments on the Earth
[46:26] first he made a preparation for all who
[46:28] would receive it to escape it and then
[46:31] if they did not Escape it there's only
[46:33] one thing left if they won't take God's
[46:36] preparation of Escape then there's only
[46:38] one thing left that's Divine judgment
[46:40] amen you can only do two things it lays
[46:43] either Mercy or judgment you have to
[46:46] accept one of the other that's where we
[46:48] stand tonight we either take God's mercy
[46:51] or we stand his judgment there's just no
[46:53] way of getting around it God always
[46:56] makes a way of Escape for those who
[46:58] desire to
[46:59] escape then he's got what's left over
[47:02] has to stand the Judgment not because
[47:03] that God wants them to but because they
[47:06] have chosen that way themselves see they
[47:09] make their own choice that's where we
[47:11] stand tonight friends the same thing we
[47:13] can either take God's way of Escape or
[47:16] we can stand his judgments either one we
[47:17] want to do aren't you happy tonight that
[47:21] you have tucked the way of Escape amen
[47:24] because all that refus
[47:26] the way of Escape will have to come
[47:28] under judgment then there is another man
[47:31] I'd like to speak
[47:32] of that was a great Mighty Prophet by
[47:36] the name of Moses the People Israel
[47:39] should have understood according to the
[47:41] scripture that God was going to deliver
[47:44] them and was going to bring them out of
[47:47] Egypt but as soon as God got his man
[47:51] ready and sent him down into Egypt they
[47:54] had no respect for him
[47:57] they turned him out and said will you
[47:59] slay us as you did the Egyptian which
[48:01] caused them to stay in bondage uh extra
[48:05] 40 years they stayed in bondage because
[48:09] they refus to respect the deliverer that
[48:13] come to deliver
[48:14] them that put them back in bondage
[48:17] again not because God wanted to stay the
[48:20] time was exactly right but they stayed
[48:23] 40 years over because they refuse to
[48:26] accept God's provided way of
[48:29] Escape how I believe that that's what's
[48:32] the matter tonight same thing see that
[48:36] they refused the way out and God was
[48:39] determined and had told Abraham and them
[48:42] in his Covenant as we read David singing
[48:44] of it tonight he had promised them that
[48:47] he was going to do a certain thing so
[48:48] God's going to keep his
[48:50] promise he was going to bring him out
[48:53] anyhow but perhaps nearly another
[48:55] generation died off the old generation
[48:57] laughed at Moses and so forth and would
[49:00] not accept the message that generation
[49:02] 40 years died off and Moses come into
[49:04] another
[49:06] generation see what I mean if they don't
[49:09] accept it then God will let that
[49:11] generation die out and he'll bring in
[49:13] another generation to do it amen so they
[49:16] had refused it and then we find out this
[49:19] next Generation to come up when Moses
[49:22] went down there to vindicate himself you
[49:25] know Moses was scared to go down again
[49:27] Moses is 80 years old now and he had
[49:30] been gone 40 years and when he talked to
[49:33] God at the burning bush he said who will
[49:35] I tell them that sent me God had no name
[49:39] he said who will I tell them that sent
[49:41] me so I say the god of your fathers
[49:44] appear to me they'll say who is the god
[49:46] of our fathers well what do I tell him
[49:48] he said you tell them that I am that I
[49:52] am you tell them that I am that I am all
[49:56] that and he said what is that in your
[49:57] hand Moses he said it's thick and he
[49:59] threw it down and turned into a serpent
[50:01] and put his hand in his bosom and turned
[50:03] to leers and went back and healed he
[50:05] said go down and take these signs and
[50:08] perform them before the people and it'll
[50:10] be an a
[50:11] Vindication they'll know by these signs
[50:14] that I sent you for deliverance amen oh
[50:18] brother Hallelujah God always does that
[50:22] God always gives Supernatural signs amen
[50:25] see and now when he came down and called
[50:28] the people and done his signs before
[50:31] them all Israel believe every one of
[50:34] them and they went right straight to the
[50:36] Palace the for deliverance and then the
[50:39] Pharaoh decided he would not give him
[50:41] deliverance and God turned judgment
[50:44] loose on pharaoh and we know what
[50:47] happened in Egypt strange after they had
[50:50] seen all those signs happen and then
[50:52] they come to the Red Sea and found out
[50:55] that the very God that performed all
[50:57] those signs here at the Red Sea doubted
[51:00] God the very first thing that he was
[51:02] able to make a way of
[51:04] Escape now there's where we make our
[51:07] mistakes when a little sickness strikes
[51:09] us when a little disaster a little
[51:11] trouble strike somewhere in a way then
[51:14] we go to Falling Away a young convert
[51:16] somebody will make fun of and say well
[51:17] you ain't nothing but a Holy Roller well
[51:20] I hate to be called a holy Ro you see
[51:22] see there you are you get that doubt
[51:24] that's the time to stand there amen
[51:27] that's the time to respect the messenger
[51:30] that's the time to to give glory to God
[51:34] hallelujah and Moses said I've done
[51:37] these already 10 Miracles before you
[51:40] God's G you 10 Miracles and then you're
[51:42] afraid of the see certainly how much
[51:46] more would it take for you to believe
[51:48] Hallelujah he walked back and stuck his
[51:51] rod and held it before the Sea and the
[51:52] storms came down and blow across the
[51:55] other other side and they went across
[51:56] and as soon as they got over there
[51:58] immediately be to complain they had no
[52:01] bread just same thing then God Ran bread
[52:04] out of heavens for then they complained
[52:07] they had no water and just one complain
[52:10] after another and I noticed you say well
[52:13] maybe they were the unconverted type
[52:16] well maybe they were there was a mix
[52:18] multitude went with them truth but I
[52:20] want to bring another thing into your uh
[52:22] into your remembrance if God sent the
[52:26] messenger and Vindicated by the signs
[52:28] that he was a messenger sent from God
[52:31] then it's up to them to obey this
[52:33] messenger amen exactly they must obey
[52:37] the messenger all right and have
[52:40] respects to that messenger look at
[52:42] Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by
[52:44] his side amen yes sir whatever Moses in
[52:48] they was in it too whether mes right or
[52:50] wrong they stay right with him anyhow
[52:52] see because they know that was God's
[52:55] message messenger and there one day we
[52:57] find out that even Mariam a
[53:01] prophet and Aaron the high priest made
[53:05] fun of moses'
[53:07] wife because she was an Ethiopian and
[53:11] thought was there enough women of our
[53:12] own group to marry instead of going down
[53:15] there and marrying that woman that
[53:17] wasn't Moses choice that was God's
[53:19] choice for Moses
[53:21] amen and when they made fun of it that
[53:25] anged God in such a
[53:27] way until he struck maram the prophecies
[53:30] full of leprosy Moses own sister what
[53:34] about that her a
[53:38] Propet but what was she doing she was
[53:41] making fun in irreverence to God's
[53:44] messenger amen the messenger of the
[53:47] Covenant of that day and she was
[53:50] irreverent and also Aaron the high
[53:53] priest the very mouth he of Moses yeah
[53:57] right he was with her and Aaron then
[54:01] when he saw his sister struck with
[54:03] Leprosy he went in and told Moses would
[54:06] you let your own sister die and Moses
[54:09] went into the Tabernacle and fell before
[54:10] the Lord and begin to weep call out for
[54:14] God Mercy for his sister and the spirit
[54:18] of the Lord came down and said call
[54:20] Aaron and maram to stand here before me
[54:24] oh my
[54:25] Hallelujah God demands
[54:29] respect God sends his message you listen
[54:32] to it you reverence it don't care if
[54:35] they call it a bunch of holy rulers or
[54:37] whatever they call it let the world do
[54:38] what they want to but you give
[54:40] respects
[54:42] amen so there stood Mariam God said call
[54:45] Mariam and call mooses call Aaron here
[54:48] your brother and sister to stand before
[54:50] me and when they come in before God God
[54:53] said don't you fear God
[54:57] said that to the high priest and to
[54:59] maram the
[55:01] prophet said if there be any A man among
[55:04] you spiritual or prophets I the Lord
[55:06] will make myself known to him I'll speak
[55:09] to him in Visions reveal myself and
[55:11] dreams to him and so forth if he's
[55:13] spiritual or private but said my servant
[55:15] Moses I speak lip to ear with
[55:18] him amen said don't you fear God in
[55:22] other words you talk about Moses you're
[55:23] talking about me
[55:25] if you can't respect Moses you don't
[55:27] respect me said Haven I proved among you
[55:30] that he's my servant Hallelujah and you
[55:33] have no reverence for him at all what
[55:35] that would be a lesson for the people of
[55:37] this day oh
[55:39] amen no
[55:42] respect no
[55:44] har now he said because you didn't do
[55:48] that that's the reason you got leprosy
[55:50] that's the reason these things is went
[55:52] said because you ought to know that this
[55:54] is my servant you do know it amen So
[55:57] when you say something against him
[55:59] you're saying it against me amen so
[56:02] Moses prayed for her life to be spared
[56:05] and God did spare her life she didn't
[56:07] live very long afterwards she died but
[56:10] she did get cleansed of her lepers and
[56:12] is out of the camp for seven days you
[56:13] know for for having for a purification
[56:16] get herself uh cleaned again from her
[56:19] leprosy God healed but what he was
[56:23] trying to get to them is this you've got
[56:25] to respect what I do amen and if that
[56:30] was the attitude of God in that day and
[56:32] God can't
[56:33] change God wants us to respect what he's
[56:37] doing yes he demands
[56:41] itah said you either respect that or
[56:44] something else is going to
[56:46] happen amen a man told me the other day
[56:50] he said I poor man sweeps up over here
[56:54] here in the market for a living he's had
[56:57] a breakdown in very bad shape he's

[1:06:38] doing did look bad children suffering
[1:06:41] people suffering cattle
[1:06:43] dying sheep dying no water
[1:06:47] nowhere the nights was hot and sulty the
[1:06:50] sun was as brightest brass in the skies
[1:06:53] to the daytime for 3 years and 6
[1:06:56] months Elijah s up on the mountain said
[1:06:59] not even do a fall will I call
[1:07:02] from oh how they hated him and when he
[1:07:05] they had found him he said you're the
[1:07:07] one that's troubling Israel are you old
[1:07:10] Elijah looked back in his face said nay
[1:07:11] not me but you're the one that's
[1:07:13] troubling Israel that's right see even
[1:07:16] Ahab didn't have respect for him you
[1:07:19] know what Elijah told Ahab said because
[1:07:21] you shed the innocent blood of nebot so
[1:07:24] the dogs will lick your blood too in the
[1:07:26] street and they did amen because they
[1:07:31] disrespected God's
[1:07:32] messenger exactly right they
[1:07:35] disrespected it
[1:07:37] now Mariam disrespected it Aaron
[1:07:41] disrespected it no matter who you are
[1:07:43] Christian are not Christian you've got
[1:07:46] to still bring respect to God and
[1:07:48] respect what he's doing or suffer the
[1:07:51] consequence it's either receive it or
[1:07:54] going into judgment either one you want
[1:07:56] to how I can stand with testimony for
[1:07:59] hour after hour of what I've seen in my
[1:08:01] lifetime what I've seen in the other
[1:08:03] countries and other parts of the Nations
[1:08:05] and so forth the things that's taking
[1:08:07] place but to Omit that just so that
[1:08:09] you'll get the the idea of what I'm
[1:08:11] trying to say to you you must respect it
[1:08:15] I've seen young people sit in the
[1:08:16] meeting and snigger and life in a
[1:08:18] meeting and less some 24 hours be
[1:08:21] crushed into the streets oh
[1:08:24] I've seen young people sat in a meeting
[1:08:26] in one year when I was in a place and
[1:08:28] next maybe within 6 months go back to
[1:08:30] the same place and practically every one
[1:08:32] of them was gone or landay stricken
[1:08:34] somewhere with diseases and
[1:08:36] things that's right you have to respect
[1:08:39] it I remember a certain young girl one
[1:08:41] night Tennessee and I was going out the
[1:08:44] door preaching in a big Baptist Church I
[1:08:46] was going out the door I felt led that
[1:08:49] night to call her to come to Christ well
[1:08:51] she laughed in my face when I called her
[1:08:53] to come come to Christ she had to be one
[1:08:54] of the deacons daughters and stand at
[1:08:56] the door that night she waited for me
[1:08:58] and I come out she said I want you to
[1:09:00] know something right now don't you never
[1:09:02] embarrass me like that again I said God
[1:09:05] was calling you she said nonsense I'm
[1:09:08] young so I got plenty of time for that
[1:09:11] said my Daddy's got enough religion for
[1:09:13] all of us at home I said not enough for
[1:09:16] you sister everyone has to have their
[1:09:18] own religion she said if I want anybody
[1:09:20] to talk to me about that I'll get
[1:09:21] somebody that's got some sense not
[1:09:23] somebody like you I said go say what you
[1:09:25] wish you you don't bother me but someday
[1:09:28] you'll regret it not long after that
[1:09:30] passed through the same city here she
[1:09:32] come down the street with her unders
[1:09:33] skirts hanging down slopping with a
[1:09:35] cigarette in her hand and offered me a
[1:09:37] drink of
[1:09:38] whiskey same thing here's her testimony
[1:09:41] she said you remember the night you
[1:09:42] called that said that was the truth she
[1:09:45] said the spirit of God was testifying to
[1:09:47] me that night trying to get me to come
[1:09:49] and said since then I could see my
[1:09:51] mother's Soul frying hell like a pancake
[1:09:53] and laugh at it that's what happened see
[1:09:56] you've got to respect God all you got to
[1:09:59] do it brother that's all Jezebel
[1:10:01] disrespected it and remember another
[1:10:04] time there's some ear River children
[1:10:06] they had been raised up in a home Elijah
[1:10:08] after his days of course the people
[1:10:10] hated him because he call that famine in
[1:10:12] the
[1:10:13] Land There were some people that taught
[1:10:15] their children that Elijah a man like
[1:10:18] that been translated taken into heaven
[1:10:20] he got killed somewhere and they just
[1:10:21] bearded him and hit him they didn't
[1:10:24] believe it so Elisha took his place now
[1:10:28] he was a messenger the day now after
[1:10:30] Elijah had been taken up so he passed
[1:10:33] down to a certain city and the children
[1:10:35] Little Children of that City run out
[1:10:37] making fun of him said say you old
[1:10:39] ballhead why didn't you go up like
[1:10:41] Elijah did see they didn't believe
[1:10:43] Elijah went
[1:10:45] up there it is it wasn't a disrespecting
[1:10:50] the man it was disrespecting his message
[1:10:52] he was the successor to Elijah to Elijah
[1:10:56] he had the anointing the spirit of
[1:10:57] Elijah was up on him he went up there
[1:11:00] and done the very same things that
[1:11:01] Elijah did all right hallelujah amen
[1:11:05] Jesus said he that bre on me the works
[1:11:07] that I do shall he do also
[1:11:09] amlu these signs shall follow
[1:11:13] them they disrespected it and they
[1:11:16] disrespected Elijah because he believed
[1:11:18] in elishah because the spirit was upon
[1:11:21] him and he turned around and smoked the
[1:11:23] jarden with his man and opened up the
[1:11:25] jarden went up and done the same kind of
[1:11:28] Miracles that Elijah did and even all
[1:11:30] the preachers up at the school the
[1:11:32] prophet said the spirit of Elijah rest
[1:11:34] is up on
[1:11:35] Elijah Hallelujah no abroad in the
[1:11:38] country and the people are bet the L
[1:11:41] look that bunch of Holy Rollers fanatic
[1:11:44] saying that man went to heaven without
[1:11:46] dying horses come down we didn't see any
[1:11:48] certainly they didn't certainly not they
[1:11:51] didn't we didn't see any horses we
[1:11:53] didn't you hear any chariots anywhere
[1:11:55] nonsense the old fell died and they
[1:11:57] buried him and then they trying to make
[1:11:58] a lot of uh too over just like they say
[1:12:01] today the same thing like they said
[1:12:03] about Jesus they said while they come
[1:12:05] and stole his body at night time they
[1:12:06] even paid soldiers to testify that but
[1:12:09] he raised from the dead and Elijah was
[1:12:12] tuck up in a chair of fire with horses
[1:12:14] of fire this young Prophet walking along
[1:12:17] there going down through the city and he
[1:12:19] lost his hair as a young man he was
[1:12:21] going down so these little children run
[1:12:22] behind him said hey hey why didn't you
[1:12:24] goow up with Elijah said you old
[1:12:26] Baldhead you see and they were given
[1:12:31] disrespect and what did Elijah do he
[1:12:33] turned in the power of the spirit and
[1:12:35] cursed those children what happened two
[1:12:38] sheep bears come from the woods and kill
[1:12:40] 42 of
[1:12:41] them right disrespects irreverence you
[1:12:46] can't do that you've got to respect God
[1:12:49] if they had have kids and said now if
[1:12:51] their father and mother said now look
[1:12:52] children they say that Elijah was taken
[1:12:54] up now we don't know about that but
[1:12:56] anyhow I I I don't know whether it's so
[1:12:58] or not but I tell you the best thing to
[1:13:01] do is just don't say nothing about it
[1:13:02] just go ahead when he passes we hear
[1:13:04] he's coming down through the city today
[1:13:05] go to have a street meeting up there if
[1:13:07] he does if you children on the road to
[1:13:08] school today me you say how do you do
[1:13:11] Reverend how do you do sir or something
[1:13:13] like that speak to him but instead of
[1:13:15] that no doubt they've been told at home
[1:13:17] oh I heard Papa and Mama set at the
[1:13:18] table and laugh and one other saying
[1:13:20] what do you know they said that old holy
[1:13:22] Rover was taking up you ever believe
[1:13:24] anything like that and they say this a
[1:13:26] little baldheaded fell this is
[1:13:27] baldheaded is a pumpkin up there ain't
[1:13:29] over about 35 years old and here he's
[1:13:31] coming down through there day you go to
[1:13:32] whole street you expect us to believe
[1:13:34] such nonsense as that why isn't nothing
[1:13:36] but a little just a a mockery that's all
[1:13:39] it is because he won't come to our
[1:13:41] churches he's just like Elijah was he
[1:13:43] won't come to our churches we he'll
[1:13:45] probably some kind of a witchcraft whoo
[1:13:47] hopes that he's got like Elijah they
[1:13:49] didn't believe him so the little
[1:13:51] children was taught that at home yes if
[1:13:54] they've been taught reverence and
[1:13:57] respect that have walked out there
[1:13:59] before that prophet of God and ask for
[1:14:02] prayer for
[1:14:03] themselves but they had been taught to
[1:14:06] snigger and laugh and to make fun about
[1:14:08] like the children of today more too many
[1:14:11] of them today would make fun at a street
[1:14:13] meeting they would make fun at the
[1:14:15] preaching of the
[1:14:16] Gospel so Elijah cursed them in the name
[1:14:19] of the Lord not because of the children
[1:14:22] but because of the irreverent parents
[1:14:23] that have brought the children up that
[1:14:25] way to disrespect God two sheep bears
[1:14:29] come out and kill 42 of them now it's
[1:14:31] irreverence God demands
[1:14:34] respect when they disrespected his
[1:14:37] Prophet they disrespected him no matter
[1:14:40] how much they didn't believe they ought
[1:14:41] kept their mouth shut stay away from it
[1:14:43] but no they had to put in their nickels
[1:14:45] worth they had to say something that
[1:14:46] they ought not have said and what
[1:14:48] happened to him let's take some people
[1:14:50] who did respect it let's take the
[1:14:52] shunamite woman to the same Prophet
[1:14:54] Elijah she was actually not an Israelite
[1:14:57] she was some
[1:14:59] shuna but she believed in God and she
[1:15:02] seen this man pass through the town
[1:15:03] heard him speak she's seen the signs
[1:15:05] that he done it's told in history I
[1:15:07] don't know where it's true or not that
[1:15:08] one day a bunch of wild dogs was trying
[1:15:11] to catch a little girl now this isn't
[1:15:13] scripture it's just a story that I read
[1:15:15] and said this shunamite woman was
[1:15:17] standing on the corner and she saw that
[1:15:19] these dogs was going to kill this little
[1:15:21] girl and this holy man was passing
[1:15:22] through town and he raised up his staff
[1:15:24] to God and cried out for Mercy for them
[1:15:26] little children like that and the dogs
[1:15:28] turned and went away from
[1:15:30] them was it was store not sounds like it
[1:15:32] could be I don't know but anyhow this
[1:15:34] woman said when the Bible when she
[1:15:37] perceived that this was a holy
[1:15:40] man she perceived something had happened
[1:15:44] she seen what he was and perceived that
[1:15:46] he was a holy man from God and instead
[1:15:49] of disrespecting him like Jezebel did
[1:15:52] she respected him she said to her
[1:15:56] husband we are well able to do this I
[1:15:58] pray thee let's build him a little house
[1:16:00] out here somewhere let's give him a
[1:16:02] little place far he's weary I watch him
[1:16:05] he's getting old and I noticed his gray
[1:16:07] hair is hung down in his beard his
[1:16:09] little old staff his little skinny arms
[1:16:12] as he walked along the little flabby
[1:16:14] arms like that and here he come walking
[1:16:16] along packing a little Cru of oil on his
[1:16:18] side with a piece of sheep skin wrapped
[1:16:20] around him and the hot sun is by looks
[1:16:23] scared and red and uh I pray thee let's
[1:16:27] make him a little station to stop here
[1:16:29] let's get the contractor and come out
[1:16:31] here and build him a little place and
[1:16:33] put him up because I perceive that his
[1:16:35] Spirit by his Spirit he's a holy man
[1:16:38] he's a
[1:16:40] man what a difference now her husband
[1:16:44] agreed she he said darling I have no
[1:16:47] that man too I've listened at him I've
[1:16:49] watched him I've seen his works I know
[1:16:51] he's the holy man of God so we'll just
[1:16:53] do that so they called the contractor
[1:16:55] and build him a nice little place and
[1:16:56] put him a little bed there to rest so he
[1:16:57] can lay down and rest fixed him a place
[1:17:00] to wash his feet and got some water and
[1:17:01] things and fixed it in there and when
[1:17:03] the prophet came by of course i' blessed
[1:17:05] his soul to see that something had been
[1:17:07] done for him he said to G said go call
[1:17:09] her and asked her what could I do for
[1:17:11] her could I speak to the king to the
[1:17:13] chief chap he she said I dwell among my
[1:17:16] people and there's nothing I have eat of
[1:17:18] but Gesa said she has no children and
[1:17:21] her husband is well in age he's old they
[1:17:24] have no children and I imagine Elijah
[1:17:26] laying on this little bed that she had
[1:17:28] blessed him by making had his feet all
[1:17:30] washed and his beards all washed out and
[1:17:32] thing laying there no doubt but what he
[1:17:34] seen the vision of the Lord because they
[1:17:36] always did that so said go call her and
[1:17:39] tell her to stand here before me oh
[1:17:42] Hallelujah go call her because she has
[1:17:45] she's respected God go tell her to come
[1:17:48] here when she stood in the door he said
[1:17:50] thus sayith the Lord about this time
[1:17:52] next year year you'll bear a
[1:17:55] baby and about that time next year she
[1:17:58] had the baby then Satan when he got to
[1:18:00] be about 12 years old his father had him
[1:18:02] out in the field one day and Satan said
[1:18:04] I'll get rid of that child so he just
[1:18:06] give him a sun stroke and he died in his
[1:18:08] mother's arms did that discourage her no
[1:18:10] sir she said sad mu and go forward don't
[1:18:13] stop go up to Mount Carmel to the
[1:18:15] mountain because he just passed through
[1:18:16] here of the
[1:18:19] day there you are that's respect that's
[1:18:22] respect face and her husband said you're
[1:18:24] going to the man of God said it's
[1:18:27] neither new moon or Sabbath he won't be
[1:18:28] up there and she said all will be well
[1:18:30] just saddle them you and let me go on
[1:18:33] and so away they went and they got up
[1:18:35] into the mountain and when oh Elijah
[1:18:37] looked out of the cave and he' come out
[1:18:38] there and looked at he said this looks
[1:18:40] like that shunamite woman coming said
[1:18:42] she must be grieved he said go meet her
[1:18:45] and when he said she's grieved in her
[1:18:46] heart and God's never told me nothing
[1:18:48] about it see God don't have to tell you
[1:18:50] everything see so he don't even tell his
[1:18:52] prophet profs everything he just he just
[1:18:55] does what he wants to do he's
[1:18:57] God now Elijah said God what if Elijah
[1:19:00] said this why didn't you tell me why
[1:19:02] she's coming why did you tell me all
[1:19:04] about it you never seen a thing but he
[1:19:06] was all right with Elijah whatever it
[1:19:08] was and what if she have come up and
[1:19:09] said she' say you said you was a servant
[1:19:12] of God you hypocrite I do believe you
[1:19:14] ain't nothing but a Holy Roller it'll
[1:19:16] never happen see God tries us sometimes
[1:19:19] see what we'll do so instead of that she
[1:19:22] run right up to his feet and worship
[1:19:24] like she was to God and she said and she
[1:19:27] revealed to him what was the matter and
[1:19:29] Elijah said take my staff and go lay it
[1:19:31] on the child and when he did the woman
[1:19:34] said as the Lord God liveth in your soul
[1:19:36] never
[1:19:37] die hallah thou servant of God I'll not
[1:19:42] leave you I'm going to stay here to God
[1:19:44] sends the vision amen oh I just stayed
[1:19:47] there a little while longer gted up his
[1:19:49] loins and Tuck his staff and here he
[1:19:50] went he went into the room where that
[1:19:52] baby was was laying a dead baby walked
[1:19:54] up and down the floor like that a few
[1:19:56] times because of a reverent woman a
[1:19:58] woman that respect him a man that
[1:20:00] respected him leave him to be a man of
[1:20:02] God he walked back and forth up and down
[1:20:04] the floor until God answered amen then
[1:20:08] he laid himself up on the baby in his s
[1:20:09] seven times and picked it up and give it
[1:20:11] to the mother walked on out back up to
[1:20:13] the cave went because she respected the
[1:20:16] man of God
[1:20:20] Amen what about Martha was always
[1:20:23] thinking about fixing Jesus a good
[1:20:25] dinner Mary wanted to hear the word of
[1:20:27] God so she just sat around listening at
[1:20:29] him she didn't care where the Piller
[1:20:30] cases was changed or where the the
[1:20:33] curtains was dusted or where they had
[1:20:34] anything to eat or not she just wanted
[1:20:36] to hear what Jesus would go to say but
[1:20:38] Martha always wanted to cook him a good
[1:20:39] dinner and be sure that the chair was
[1:20:41] made soft and it was set just right and
[1:20:44] everything was cleaned up like that but
[1:20:46] she wanted to do something for Jesus in
[1:20:48] her way Mary wanted to do it in her way
[1:20:51] but one day when Lazareth come many
[1:20:53] people talk against Martha said she
[1:20:55] ought been more interested Oh no just a
[1:20:58] moment see there come a time for Martha
[1:21:00] to show hers and then when Jesus when
[1:21:03] Lazarus died her brother she sent for
[1:21:05] him to come pray for him he did not come
[1:21:08] he ignored the call he went on somewhere
[1:21:10] else she sent again and still ignored
[1:21:12] the call but when finally he comes seen
[1:21:15] like now that she could have walked out
[1:21:17] to him and said why didn't you
[1:21:20] come why didn't you come when I called
[1:21:23] you my brother was laying there sick
[1:21:25] we've left our church we left our
[1:21:27] organization we done everything to
[1:21:29] follow your message because we did
[1:21:31] believe that you were a man of God but
[1:21:33] how could a man of God and we two orphan
[1:21:36] three orphan children here three orphan
[1:21:38] people and our livelihood was making
[1:21:41] tapestries for that Temple we was
[1:21:43] members there our mother and fathers was
[1:21:45] members there but because that you hop
[1:21:47] just into a thing that believe in this
[1:21:49] what you're trying to teach saying that
[1:21:51] you're a son of God our Prophet sent
[1:21:53] from God and these things how can we
[1:21:55] ever believe you a man that wouldn't
[1:21:57] even listen to me when I call for you
[1:21:59] when I was in need and had need of you
[1:22:01] you ignored my message and went on and I
[1:22:03] sent again and you still ignored it why
[1:22:06] did you do a thing like that if she'd
[1:22:08] have done that the story would have been
[1:22:10] different tonight oh amen what did she
[1:22:12] do she run right streight to where he
[1:22:15] was fell down at his feet and said Lord
[1:22:19] if thou would have been here my brother
[1:22:20] would not have died
[1:22:23] oh there you are what was she doing she
[1:22:25] was respecting she was in the presence
[1:22:27] of God and she respected she called him
[1:22:30] her Lord Lord if thou would have been
[1:22:33] here now that I sent for you that was
[1:22:34] all forgotten now you're here see if you
[1:22:37] would have been here my brother would
[1:22:38] have G out have died he said thy brother
[1:22:40] shall rise again oh she said yes Lord I
[1:22:43] know he'll raise again in the last day
[1:22:45] and um and he said uh she he said but I
[1:22:49] am the resurrection and life he that
[1:22:51] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:22:53] shall he live whosoever liveth and
[1:22:55] believeth in me shall never die I
[1:22:58] believe Lord that thou art the Son of
[1:22:59] God that was to come into the world and
[1:23:02] even now
[1:23:05] Lord even now not Lord you are to done
[1:23:09] this you are to done that but even now
[1:23:11] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:23:17] you what if we could say that to someone
[1:23:19] tonight oh my brother
[1:23:23] I believe that what you ask God God
[1:23:25] gives it to you the same results would
[1:23:28] come but no matter how much he was see
[1:23:30] if he was and we know he was a Son of
[1:23:33] God if she had disrespected it it would
[1:23:35] never
[1:23:36] work that was from her heart she said
[1:23:40] even now whatever you asked God God will
[1:23:43] give it to
[1:23:44] you that's it that's it from her heart
[1:23:48] she believed it if you had took a
[1:23:50] hunting trip or a fishing trip that
[1:23:52] would have been no difference to her no
[1:23:54] if Elijah had went on a hunting trip or
[1:23:56] went somewhere it made no difference to
[1:23:58] it to the shunamite woman she still
[1:24:00] believed to be a man of God sure no
[1:24:03] matter what he did he was still the man
[1:24:05] of God to her because she had seen God
[1:24:07] moving in his life and to Mara no matter
[1:24:09] what taking place she' seen what God did
[1:24:12] for him she said even now Lord whatever
[1:24:14] you ask God God will give it to
[1:24:16] you there you are he said th brother
[1:24:19] shall rise again and so he said where
[1:24:22] have you been
[1:24:23] and they went down to the grave and he
[1:24:24] called Lazarus from the grave age of
[1:24:26] being dead for 4 days why because
[1:24:30] Lazarus
[1:24:32] sister respected what he
[1:24:35] was if you can't respect the man respect
[1:24:39] the office he holds in God that's
[1:24:42] exactly right see respect him if a
[1:24:44] minister comes up your pastor always
[1:24:48] respecting I've heard congregations talk
[1:24:50] about their pastor how just talk about
[1:24:53] him running down ridiculing how's that
[1:24:55] Pastor ever going to do anything for you
[1:24:57] he can't do it you you don't you don't
[1:25:00] read I don't say this church but I mean
[1:25:02] churches I have seen that if you you've
[1:25:05] got to love your pastor you've got to
[1:25:07] know that he's a human being but yet God
[1:25:10] has made him his
[1:25:12] Pastor the Holy Ghost has made him
[1:25:15] overseer then you've got to respect him
[1:25:17] in that manner and no matter what the
[1:25:19] pastor's done if you respect him in your
[1:25:21] heart as servant God will respect you
[1:25:24] for doing it amen he that he that
[1:25:28] receiveth me receiveth him that sent me
[1:25:31] Jesus said he that don't receive me
[1:25:34] can't receive him see they said God was
[1:25:37] your father said your father's the
[1:25:39] devil so you see you've got to respect
[1:25:42] it and believe it believe that he is yes
[1:25:45] Martha believ it that's one little thing
[1:25:47] I hit on this morning that's serop woman
[1:25:49] that time when she come up look how she
[1:25:52] was turned down bitterly there he was a
[1:25:55] Jew she was a
[1:25:57] gentile and she run up to him she didn't
[1:25:59] know how to approach him but she had a
[1:26:02] need and she know that he was that Son
[1:26:04] of God she believed that she if if God
[1:26:08] would answer his prayer for others he'
[1:26:10] answer prayer for
[1:26:11] her and she know what he said was a word
[1:26:14] of God if it's a word of God for the
[1:26:15] Jews is a word of God for the Gentiles
[1:26:17] too whatever he said and Jesus give her
[1:26:21] a trial
[1:26:22] she said Lord have mercy now watch no he
[1:26:26] said thou son of David because she'd
[1:26:28] heard the Jews saying thou son of David
[1:26:30] now he wasn't son of David to her see he
[1:26:33] said thou son of David that would have
[1:26:35] been the way a Jew would approached him
[1:26:37] because she'd heard the rest of she
[1:26:38] tried to come like David because she's
[1:26:40] trying to find respect she was trying to
[1:26:42] show her respect and she wasn't just
[1:26:43] making out Jesus would know if it was no
[1:26:46] he didn't know that so as she come up
[1:26:48] she said thou son of David have mercy
[1:26:50] upon my daughter because she's very next
[1:26:52] with the
[1:26:53] devil he turned and looked at her and
[1:26:55] said it's not meat for me to take the
[1:26:57] children's bread and cast it to the
[1:27:00] dogs wasn't that one that was one not
[1:27:03] only turned her down on her request but
[1:27:05] called her a
[1:27:07] dog right and a dog's one of the lowest
[1:27:10] names the Bible has you know so he said
[1:27:12] uh not meatly take your children's bread
[1:27:14] and cast it to the
[1:27:16] dogs she said that's truth Lord Lord
[1:27:19] then she got it he was no son of gave it
[1:27:22] to her but he was Lord said true Lord
[1:27:26] that's right but the children eats the
[1:27:28] scraps under the I mean the the dogs eat
[1:27:31] the scraps under the master's
[1:27:33] table that got it that was it that was a
[1:27:37] respect Jesus turned to her said great
[1:27:40] is your
[1:27:41] faith now go home you're going to find
[1:27:44] your daughter just as you have believed
[1:27:46] that's it why it was her
[1:27:48] approach what if she turned around and
[1:27:51] said he turned around that it's not meat
[1:27:52] for me to take in other words it's not
[1:27:55] proper say a Catholic come up and say oh
[1:27:59] brother random uh I know God hears your
[1:28:01] prayers for these people here would you
[1:28:03] pray for me I'd say well it's not right
[1:28:05] for me to take these children's time up
[1:28:07] here I'm here to pray for these
[1:28:09] Pentecostals not for you bunch of
[1:28:12] Catholics see what would she had said oh
[1:28:15] man I'm actually you stomped out of here
[1:28:17] like everything see but she turned and
[1:28:20] she said that's true Lord
[1:28:22] that's true Lord but we're we're willing
[1:28:25] to the dogs are willing to eat the
[1:28:26] scraps under the master's table see that
[1:28:29] caught him right quick he turned and
[1:28:30] said great is your faith and then we
[1:28:33] find another case see it was her
[1:28:36] approach her
[1:28:38] respects she was respecting God as she
[1:28:42] respected him so we find one time there
[1:28:45] was a Roman and he was a great man and
[1:28:48] he loved the Jews and he had a servant
[1:28:49] that was sick himself he didn't feel
[1:28:52] worthy to go ask Jesus see you always
[1:28:54] want to feel a lot little than what you
[1:28:56] are don't never be big in your own sight
[1:28:59] see now if you're big let somebody else
[1:29:03] say about you see but now when you uh
[1:29:06] this woman or this man rather he said he
[1:29:08] was a Roman Centurion and he had a sick
[1:29:11] servant so he sent to get this sick
[1:29:13] servant healed and Jesus said I'll come
[1:29:15] heal so on his Ro the Romans SE coming I
[1:29:18] man said oh my here comes that Holy One
[1:29:22] here comes that Holy One well I'm a old
[1:29:25] count Gentile I'm I I'm a Roman Cent I'm
[1:29:28] a general or an officer I I I really not
[1:29:32] a Jew I have no right for that holy man
[1:29:34] to come see the
[1:29:36] respects see I don't have right to have
[1:29:38] that Holy servant of God come to my
[1:29:40] house so he would come to the door and
[1:29:42] he called and said Lord I'm not worthy
[1:29:45] that you'd come under my roof probably
[1:29:47] had a palace of a home a centurion said
[1:29:50] I'm not worthy that you'd come under my
[1:29:52] roof and I I didn't think myself worthy
[1:29:54] to even come to you so I sent some of
[1:29:56] your your own blessed people to Jews but
[1:29:59] I have a servant here it's very sick and
[1:30:01] he said I'm a man under Authority said I
[1:30:04] say to this Soldier you go and he goes I
[1:30:06] say to this one you come and he comes
[1:30:08] what did he say there I know that you
[1:30:10] have all
[1:30:11] power you can say that this disease go
[1:30:14] and it goes and you can say that this
[1:30:15] would come and they would come see you
[1:30:18] recognize as he had authority over these
[1:30:20] soldiers so Jesus had authority over all
[1:30:22] sickness and diseases only thing you
[1:30:25] have to do Lord is just speak the
[1:30:28] word
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] hallelujah just speak the word my
[1:30:35] servant aah Jesus stop turn around to
[1:30:39] them Jews said I haven't found Faith
[1:30:41] like that over in
[1:30:43] Israel he said it's all right with your
[1:30:46] Ser why because he respected it he
[1:30:51] expected Jesus Christ who was the the
[1:30:55] the god of Heaven
[1:30:58] now I guess it's getting
[1:31:02] late I just want to say one more thing
[1:31:04] is this all those great respects and so
[1:31:08] forth but today somehow it's
[1:31:12] different God can do something today and
[1:31:14] people like
[1:31:15] that I believe that we' have been
[1:31:18] different today about 40 years ago when
[1:31:21] the Holy Ghost was first begin to fall
[1:31:22] but what the people do locked up the
[1:31:24] preachers called them Holy Rollers went
[1:31:27] out on the wouldn't even feed them in
[1:31:29] the cities and everything like that they
[1:31:30] broke corn on the railroad tracks to
[1:31:32] live by what do they do they had another
[1:31:34] 40 years the church has suffering went
[1:31:39] through everything two Wars in that much
[1:31:41] time see skilled all thousands of them
[1:31:44] when she probably done been gone
[1:31:46] home now what would taken place when God
[1:31:50] begin to pour out the Holy Ghost upon
[1:31:51] the the church in the last days what
[1:31:53] would have happened 25 years ago when he
[1:31:56] began to send down his signs and wonders
[1:31:57] and miracles what would have taken place
[1:32:00] if the people all rallied over what did
[1:32:02] they do they said it's hoodoo it's
[1:32:04] hypnotism he's a midal telepathist he's
[1:32:07] this that or the other what if all the
[1:32:09] nation would have went together and said
[1:32:10] blessed be the name of the Lord what if
[1:32:13] the methodists and Baptists and
[1:32:14] Presbyterians and all with a dra hands
[1:32:16] other and said thank God here's what
[1:32:18] we've look for am the Holy Ghost is
[1:32:21] being poured out why here's man who sees
[1:32:24] Visions here's prophets Among Us here's
[1:32:27] here's all these great gifts here's
[1:32:28] speakers with tongues here's Divine
[1:32:30] healers here's everything's been poured
[1:32:32] out upon us thanks be to God it come
[1:32:35] through a humble little Bunch called
[1:32:36] Pentecostals let's all go back to the
[1:32:38] Bible again let's go back break up our
[1:32:41] organizations and all be one brother the
[1:32:43] great churches all together would have
[1:32:45] come together what would have happened
[1:32:47] brother there wouldn't be been had need
[1:32:48] of a hospital in the land today that's
[1:32:51] right
[1:32:52] no there had been such powerful great
[1:32:54] gifts and Wonders working amongst the
[1:32:56] people there had been such a respect of
[1:32:58] perhaps a church had done been gone home
[1:33:00] in the Millennium had been on but no
[1:33:03] they disrespected it they called him
[1:33:04] Holy Rollers the newspapers waited to
[1:33:07] say every slandering dirty thing they
[1:33:08] couldn't whatever dirty slang to it they
[1:33:10] could do it and things like that in
[1:33:12] churches he hard and laughed at it and
[1:33:14] made fun of them and turned them away
[1:33:16] and tried to keep them out of the cities
[1:33:17] and everything else of
[1:33:20] disrespect now
[1:33:22] I could say a lot about that but it's
[1:33:24] getting late let me come to the brandom
[1:33:25] Tabernacle
[1:33:27] please now God's beginning to pour out
[1:33:29] gifts upon us we see it now what is the
[1:33:34] gift of God today is the holy
[1:33:37] spirit it's the Holy Ghost that's in us
[1:33:40] we've got to respect
[1:33:42] that we've got to respect it on every
[1:33:45] person that comes upon we've got to
[1:33:48] reive to God's Divine gifts when he
[1:33:50] sends those gift is no matter how real
[1:33:52] they are it'll never help us until we
[1:33:55] get to a place that we can respect
[1:33:57] it somebody can give a prophecy if you
[1:34:01] don't believe in that prophecy it'll
[1:34:03] never do you any good amen you've got to
[1:34:06] have reverence and you've got to respect
[1:34:08] it you've got to believe that it comes
[1:34:10] from God believe until it's proved wrong
[1:34:14] then when it's proved wrong then you
[1:34:15] have a right to disbelieve it then don't
[1:34:17] associate with it no more but as long as
[1:34:19] it been provve out to be the truth then
[1:34:22] believe
[1:34:23] it like Old Samuel said that day when he
[1:34:26] wanted a king he said I want to ask you
[1:34:29] one thing have I ever taken any of your
[1:34:31] money from you have I ever asked you for
[1:34:34] a living or have I ever told you
[1:34:37] anything in the name of the Lord but
[1:34:38] what come to
[1:34:39] pass he said you don't need no King and
[1:34:43] your king will do you no good and he
[1:34:45] told him he brought him the question
[1:34:47] said have I ever told you anything is
[1:34:49] thus sayith the Lord of what happened
[1:34:52] now then the people disrespected Samuel
[1:34:55] oh we know Samuel that's right you we
[1:34:57] can't say that you never told us
[1:34:58] anything what was right but but still we
[1:35:00] want to do it this way see you mustn't
[1:35:03] do that you must do it God's
[1:35:06] way when we receive the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:08] not shaking hands with a
[1:35:10] pastor receiving the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:12] receiving Christ into you because he is
[1:35:15] God's messenger of the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:18] God's messenger and we must respect
[1:35:21] when he comes on say look at that woman
[1:35:24] shouting there and crying tears running
[1:35:26] down her cheeks look at that man there
[1:35:27] shaking his hands and trembling and
[1:35:29] crying you know what that is that's a
[1:35:31] bunch of worked up emotion you're a
[1:35:32] blaspheming the Holy
[1:35:35] Ghost you got to respect
[1:35:38] that remember here some time ago I was
[1:35:42] an argon about been about 12 years ago
[1:35:44] and two little Catholic Reporter girls
[1:35:46] come down not because they were catholic
[1:35:48] nothing no more that cuz I've had just
[1:35:50] as many Protestants more Protestants and
[1:35:52] half Catholics to make fun of me and um
[1:35:54] and and so these girls come down to give
[1:35:57] a report so as soon as they got in there
[1:35:59] I caught the spirit soon as he come in
[1:36:02] and I said all right I like criticism
[1:36:04] you get off your sleeve now and this
[1:36:06] girl pulled out a cigarette and started
[1:36:08] my I said just don't like that while

[1:36:43] feet she said what do you mean to tell
[1:36:46] me that that kind of a people they say
[1:36:48] will live your on Earth and be in heaven
[1:36:51] she said I wouldn't want to be in heaven
[1:36:53] with such people that I said you don't
[1:36:54] have to worry very much as long as you
[1:36:55] think that way you won't be there anyhow
[1:36:57] see I said you won't have any worry
[1:36:59] about

[1:38:02] Christians I said sure they're
[1:38:04] Christians I said they're Christians

[1:38:13] she had to say about it I said I'd like
[1:38:15] to tell you something she said well I
[1:38:17] wouldn't want to associate myself with a
[1:38:19] bunch like that I said I don't think to
[1:38:21] much danger I said if you ever associate
[1:38:23] yourself like that I said because if you
[1:38:26] ever associated with God or with any of
[1:38:28] the Saints you'd associate like that she
[1:38:31] said the Bible Saints I said yes I said
[1:38:33] you're Blessed Virgin Mary you call her
[1:38:35] who is your goddess I said before God
[1:38:38] would ever let her come to Heaven she
[1:38:40] had to go up to the day of Pentecost and
[1:38:42] receive the Holy Ghost and staggered
[1:38:44] under the power of God like a drunk
[1:38:46] woman she said that is aive I said hold
[1:38:49] your pce just a minute I turned over
[1:38:52] here to the Bel I said look here turned
[1:38:53] over I said here it is right here in the
[1:38:56] book she turned her head I said you
[1:38:57] haven't even got the ocity to read God's
[1:39:00] word I said sure see disrespectable I
[1:39:04] said now you can take your pack of
[1:39:05] cigarettes off the table there go when
[1:39:07] you're ready but I said I want you to
[1:39:09] know one thing you write whatever you
[1:39:11] want to but remember the last words I
[1:39:14] say in the name of the Lord you'll
[1:39:16] remember it before you die she never
[1:39:18] wrote nothing that's right she just let
[1:39:20] it go
[1:39:21] what is it
[1:39:23] disrespects trying to make
[1:39:25] fun doing something they don't know what
[1:39:28] they're
[1:39:29] doing right but here in the Tabernacle
[1:39:32] we want you all to know these things
[1:39:34] here when God begins to pour out the
[1:39:36] Holy Spirit upon
[1:39:38] people sometimes I know I've seen people
[1:39:41] get in the flesh when they were when
[1:39:43] they were under the anointing of the
[1:39:44] spirit I've seen them go to extremes
[1:39:46] with things but didn't you say nothing
[1:39:48] about it you respect it bow your
[1:39:52] head you might not understand it neither
[1:39:54] would I but I want to respect it anyhow
[1:39:58] now we must have respects to God and
[1:40:01] when God pours out the Holy Spirit I
[1:40:03] just say thank you Heavenly Father you
[1:40:06] have doing something for that poor
[1:40:08] precious soul that wants to come to your
[1:40:10] home like I do somay and I see man like
[1:40:13] here one time a brother that's in the
[1:40:15] ministry said that I talked about him
[1:40:18] and we went and got all the tapes and
[1:40:20] sent to him as brother a Allen and he
[1:40:23] said that I made fun of him talking
[1:40:25] about blood coming out of your hand and
[1:40:27] and calling that the initial evidence
[1:40:29] the Holy Ghost and and of his blood and
[1:40:31] a coming out of his hands and forehead
[1:40:33] and things he said that was uh was that
[1:40:35] I made fun of that and told him that it
[1:40:37] was of the devil I sat back I wrote him
[1:40:40] a letter I said brother Allan he wrote a
[1:40:42] piece and you you read it dear brother
[1:40:44] Brandon see and so then put off tracks
[1:40:47] all across the country instead of come
[1:40:48] and see me about it he did that but I
[1:40:51] here what I said I said I'll take all
[1:40:52] six nights at Phoenix and send you my
[1:40:55] tapes and show you which Leo and them
[1:40:57] did and sent the tapes them I said only
[1:40:59] one time your name was called the people
[1:41:02] put up on my desk and said brother
[1:41:04] Brandon brother Allan had just been in
[1:41:06] the town and told us that the initial
[1:41:08] evidence of the Holy Ghost was bleeding
[1:41:09] in the hands and bleeding in the face
[1:41:11] and or running out of your hands that
[1:41:13] was initial evidence I said I disagree
[1:41:16] with brother Allan upon that being
[1:41:18] initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:20] because it was were in the Bible were
[1:41:21] they ever bled up their hands and and
[1:41:23] oil come out of their face and hands for
[1:41:25] prove they had the Holy Ghost that's
[1:41:27] said the Holy Ghost was a power of God
[1:41:29] in their lives and Jesus said these
[1:41:31] signs shall follow them that believe see
[1:41:34] my name they shall cast out devils and
[1:41:35] so forth but I said here's one thing I
[1:41:37] would say about brother Allen he's a
[1:41:39] great man of God and if I could preach
[1:41:42] as good as brother Allan could I'd never
[1:41:44] have a healing service as I just preach
[1:41:45] the gospel then see after you done put
[1:41:48] that paper out and everything that I did
[1:41:50] that just on what somebody else said but
[1:41:52] even I disagreed with the brother upon
[1:41:54] his theory I certainly wouldn't want to
[1:41:56] blaspheme the brother then standing
[1:41:58] right there up here in um Minnesota that
[1:42:02] night in Minneapolis Minnesota and there
[1:42:05] was in that Great cathedal temple with
[1:42:08] Garden Peterson and this guy that wrote
[1:42:11] that book against a Allen and said
[1:42:13] everything about him that could be said
[1:42:14] and said he even had the ocity to write
[1:42:17] that book of biting Devils about that
[1:42:19] woman showed Prince on my hands where a
[1:42:21] devil bitter and things like that now I
[1:42:24] I certainly I don't know whether that
[1:42:26] could be true or not because the Devil
[1:42:28] is a spirit you see but this woman claim
[1:42:30] the big hairy devil come and bit her all
[1:42:31] over the hands and all over the face and
[1:42:33] everything like that and he said AA
[1:42:35] Allen wrote that book and the man that
[1:42:38] wrote the book wrote a nice article
[1:42:40] about me and here he was sitting right
[1:42:42] there in the meeting that night when
[1:42:44] brother Peter them come told me there he
[1:42:45] said and was bragging on me and down in
[1:42:47] AA Allen I thought here's a time I can
[1:42:49] take up for brother Al
[1:42:52] so I walked out there and I said I was
[1:42:54] reading here the article in the paper
[1:42:55] today and this certain man that's in the
[1:42:58] city and I and knowing he sitting right
[1:42:59] out there I said he said here that U AA
[1:43:03] Allen and all the criticism I said
[1:43:04] although I appreciate the man saying the
[1:43:06] compliment about me that he did I said
[1:43:09] that I wasn't out for money and things
[1:43:10] like that and held the cleanest meetings
[1:43:13] of any of them and so forth the nice
[1:43:14] things he said I said I appreciate that
[1:43:17] but if that man that wrote this article
[1:43:20] you're in the paper never checked his
[1:43:22] notes any closer than to say a a Allen
[1:43:25] wrote this Bon of devils AA Allen never
[1:43:28] wrote that book I know the man that
[1:43:30] wrote it I said he never wrote the book
[1:43:32] at all and if the man never checked up
[1:43:35] on his article any closer than that I
[1:43:38] doubt that the rest that he's ever said
[1:43:40] about brother Allan is the
[1:43:42] truth take it up for brother Allan and I
[1:43:45] said besides if brother Allan would be
[1:43:47] wrong I'd rather be found at the
[1:43:49] Judgment bar taking my stand with
[1:43:51] brother Allan in the wrong when he's
[1:43:52] trying to win souls to Christ than to be
[1:43:55] criticizing what the man's trying to do
[1:43:58] amen right yes sir every who calls on
[1:44:01] the name of Jesus Christ I'm with him
[1:44:03] whether he's Protestant Catholic or
[1:44:05] whatever he is I I might disagree with
[1:44:07] him upon theology but I want to respect
[1:44:10] him as a servant of Christ and is my
[1:44:12] brother see no matter what he does we've
[1:44:14] got to give respect to the Holy Spirit
[1:44:17] exactly right yes sir and when we get to
[1:44:20] doing that then God will going to pour
[1:44:22] His blessings Among Us just us little
[1:44:24] group right here about 50 or 60 or maybe
[1:44:27] 75 people sitting in here tonight if we
[1:44:29] would just all together bind ourselves
[1:44:32] together and give Godly respects to God
[1:44:35] and to the Holy Spirit what he's doing
[1:44:37] in this day and respect every gift and
[1:44:39] every office that he's saying into our
[1:44:41] midst God will just continue to pour out
[1:44:43] his Spirit upon us and we'll grow in
[1:44:45] numbers and multiplies don't you believe
[1:44:47] that sure we've got to have respect unto
[1:44:51] God let us bow our head just a moment
[1:44:53] for
[1:44:55] prayer before we go to prayer I'd like
[1:44:58] to know if there's anybody in here would
[1:45:00] like to say brother brandom I want you
[1:45:03] to pray for me that I'll have great
[1:45:05] respects for God that I'll always be
[1:45:07] able to keep my mouth shut against God's
[1:45:10] things no matter what they are and may
[1:45:13] God place in my heart to respect every
[1:45:15] Divine gift he sends into the church

[1:48:11] suffer for the name of Jesus Christ
[1:48:13] father God We join ourselves with them
[1:48:15] Disciples of that day and say happy are
[1:48:18] we I stand ton night like St Paul of old

[1:48:28] fathers and when a gria said Paul too
[1:48:31] much learning has made thee mad he said
[1:48:33] I am not mad O gria then he finally got
[1:48:36] into a place she said thou almost
[1:48:37] persuadest me to be a Christian he said
[1:48:40] I would that you were a thy even without
[1:48:42] these chains of bom oh God what love
[1:48:47] that Paul had he said he would become a
[1:48:49] curse that is people might be saved oh
[1:48:52] Father God give us love for one another
