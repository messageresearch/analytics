[2:12] be you may be seated brother
[2:18] Brena we see today that our Protestants
[2:21] when we get down in here just went right
[2:23] minut just like Billy Grim said Sunday
[2:26] the people's been in wrong so much so
[2:27] they think they're all right while
[2:29] they're wrong
[2:30] that's right it's the truth I'm glad
[2:34] that on course the no Billy Graham
[2:36] received the Holy Ghost under George
[2:37] jeffes over there but some of these days
[2:39] he'll come out of that God's using him
[2:42] right there now because he can shake
[2:43] that Kingdom and nobody else car could
[2:45] get into but you can see he's preaching
[2:48] that the something behind that because
[2:49] some these your shaking hand Baptist yes
[2:52] sir am now I Know Thy works not patience
[2:57] how that thou cannot uh
[3:01] let's see now I got the I Know Thy works
[3:04] and thy labor and thy patience how th
[3:07] cannot bear them which are evil and thou
[3:11] has tried them which say that they are
[3:14] Apostles and are not and has found them
[3:18] Liars you found them to be Liars how'
[3:21] they know that they wasn't coping with
[3:23] the word now if a man says if this Bible
[3:26] says in Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ the
[3:28] same yesterday and pray man said oh the
[3:31] days of Miracles just passed then that
[3:33] man's a
[3:34] liar if the Bible said repent and be
[3:37] baptized everyone in the name of Jesus
[3:39] Christ for the remission of your sins
[3:41] and every place in the Bible says the
[3:42] same thing and everybody was ever
[3:44] baptized in a in a Bible time was
[3:46] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[3:47] he commissions them to be baptized
[3:49] sprinkled or something else like that
[3:50] that man is a
[3:52] liar found out a false
[3:55] prophet I hope I ain't hurting feelings
[3:57] but brother you you can't baby this is
[4:00] take the gloves off
[4:02] and now show me something different show
[4:06] me where one person ever baptized any
[4:07] other way than in the name of Jesus
[4:10] outside of the Catholic church so if
[4:11] you're baptized that way you're not in
[4:13] the Christian church you're in the
[4:14] Catholic Church they baptized their own
[4:17] Sunday visitor their catechism said the
[4:19] question will any Protestants be saved
[4:21] said many of them because they have our
[4:23] baptism and many things like that so
[4:25] they claim about the Bible and the Bible
[4:26] say baptize the name of Jesus Christ and
[4:28] we take it from there and put it father
[4:29] son Holy Ghost and they knock down to it
[4:32] right
[4:34] serving not a not it's not a it's not a
[4:36] Christian baptism it's a Catholic
[4:38] baptism you hear me other night have you
[4:40] ever been baptized in Christian baptism

[5:04] fainted for my name did you know what
[5:06] they had patience labored for
[5:10] what his
[5:12] name see that name holding in that
[5:14] church I watch it when we get down
[5:16] through the week how that Fades out and
[5:17] goes into another name see has had
[5:21] patience labored and so forth and for my
[5:24] name's sake he they labored for his name
[5:27] to keep the name of Jesus Christ above
[5:30] any church above anything else let it be
[5:32] first and whatever the Bible said
[5:35] whatever you do in word are
[5:38] indeed do it all in the name of Jesus
[5:44] Christ is that right whatever you do in
[5:48] word are in deed if you marry marry a
[5:51] person if you can't if they're all
[5:53] scrupled up in their marriage don't
[5:54] marry them at all amen if you can't
[5:57] freely say I pronounce you husband and
[5:59] wife in the in the name of Jesus Christ
[6:00] let them go all right you want to
[6:02] baptize them baptize them in Jesus name
[6:05] amen if you have to do something that
[6:07] you can't do in jesus' name let it alone
[6:09] somebody said take a little drink you
[6:11] can't do that in jesus' name so let it
[6:13] alone somebody said play a little card
[6:15] you can't do that in jesus' name so let
[6:17] it alone amen a little dirty smutty joke
[6:19] at your Bridge party you can't tell that
[6:22] in jesus' name so let it alone see you
[6:24] can't wear shorts in Jesus name so let
[6:26] it alone
[6:28] [Applause]
[6:29] I could go on but we you know what I'm
[6:31] talking about all right he can't do that
[6:35] what you can't do in his name leave it
[6:36] alone because he said whatever you do in
[6:38] word and deed do it all in the name of
[6:40] Jesus Christ all right now now we're
[6:43] going to that's the he commanded them
[6:46] for that now I'm going to talk about the
[6:50] complaint now in the fourth chapter a
[6:53] fourth verse rather nevertheless I have
[6:56] somewhat against thee because thou has
[6:59] left God first
[7:01] [Applause]
[7:04] love oh I have something against you
[7:08] you've been patient you've held up for
[7:10] my name wouldn't that be just a good
[7:12] thing of this Tabernacle
[7:14] today yes you've been all right you've
[7:18] had a lot of patience and for a long
[7:19] time but the thing of it is you've held
[7:22] up for my name I appreciate all right I
[7:24] I command you for that it's all right
[7:26] now see that you tried them who say
[7:28] they're Apostles and so go forth and
[7:30] sound their Liars they don't cope with
[7:31] the word I I appreciate all that but
[7:34] there's something I got against you and
[7:37] that is that you've left your first love
[7:40] you left that love that you once had for
[7:42] them good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[7:44] need and you'll begin to kind of slide
[7:47] backwards into that farm will come in
[7:49] with a father and nonsense see all this
[7:56] your society and someone has to come out
[7:58] with the Big R you know to sang in the

[8:03] over their hair and everything and lot
[8:05] of makeup around their face they sing
[8:08] like I don't know why you're not long

[17:40] nicolan sitting in the study today up
[17:43] there I wrote something here on that I
[17:45] want you to listen closely now in a
[17:47] couple Pages
[17:50] here the sixth
[17:52] verse praises and agreed that God and
[17:56] the church agreed upon one thing
[17:59] that they hated the Deeds of the
[18:02] nickan the True Vine the True Vine the
[18:06] true church that was in this Ephesian
[18:08] church I remember each church has its
[18:10] formals and each church has its
[18:12] spirituals that's the twins it's borned
[18:14] in every Revival and lives in every
[18:16] church this started right in this age
[18:19] and ends up in this age and finally the
[18:21] fals took it over in the SAA age and
[18:26] Luther pulled it back out again and
[18:29] swinging right back in
[18:31] again can you see that formal
[18:34] religion there's no difference between
[18:36] that Catholicism it's all the same thing
[18:39] ever organizations butchered right into
[18:41] it God never did organize these church
[18:45] that's exactly what they're trying to do
[18:46] here and you watch the see now that
[18:48] isn't right just show you how cursed an
[18:50] organization

[19:02] Deeds of the nians which I also hate the
[19:05] True Vine hated the formal Deeds of the
[19:09] nickan so did
[19:11] God what was deeds in the Ephesian
[19:15] Church in the Church of Ephesians became
[19:18] a
[19:19] Doctrine in the pgus

[1:10:31] chapter
[1:10:32] 14 is where we want to take our
[1:10:35] scripture
[1:10:36] reading this
[1:10:39] morning yes this is
[1:10:43] it then the children of Judah came unto
[1:10:46] Joshua and
[1:10:48] gilgal KB the son of jeffa the kenite
[1:10:52] said unto him thou knowest the thing
[1:10:55] that the Lord said unto Moses the man of
[1:10:58] God concerning me and thee in Kadesh
[1:11:02] Baria 40 years old was I when
[1:11:06] I when Moses the servant of the Lord
[1:11:09] sent me from Kadesh Baria to Espy out
[1:11:12] the land and I brought him word again as
[1:11:15] it was in my heart nevertheless my
[1:11:19] brethren that went up with me made the
[1:11:23] heart of the people melt mhm but I
[1:11:27] wholly follow the Lord my God and Moses
[1:11:31] swear on that day saying surely the land
[1:11:35] wherein thy feet have trotten shall be
[1:11:38] thy inheritance and thy children's
[1:11:41] forever because thou H has wholly
[1:11:43] followed the Lord my God and now be
[1:11:48] behold the Lord have kept me alive isn't
[1:11:52] that nice amen the Lord kept me alive as
[1:11:57] he said these 40 and5 years even since
[1:12:00] the Lord spake this word unto Moses
[1:12:03] while the children of Israel wandered in
[1:12:05] the wilderness and now lo I am this day
[1:12:08] four score and5 years old as yet I am as
[1:12:13] strong this day as I was in the day that
[1:12:17] Moses sent me as my strength was then
[1:12:21] even so is my strength now for War both
[1:12:26] to go out and to come in now therefore
[1:12:30] give me this mountain where of the Lord
[1:12:33] spake in that day for thou heardest in
[1:12:36] that day how the anakins were there and
[1:12:39] the cities were great and Fen if so be
[1:12:42] the Lord will be with me then I shall be
[1:12:44] able to drive them out say it with me as
[1:12:49] the Lord so who is Caleb quoting here
[1:12:53] he's quoting the Lord am the Lord said
[1:12:57] these things about me and he's coming to
[1:13:01] Joshua for his inheritance amen amen we
[1:13:04] will take a a title this morning stand
[1:13:08] like Joshua stand like Caleb with Joshua
[1:13:13] stand like Caleb with Joshua let us pray
[1:13:17] again Lord Jesus bless your word bless
[1:13:20] the reading of the word this time of the
[1:13:23] service Lord bless us Lord a clear
[1:13:27] thought and place it into the hearts of
[1:13:30] your people the good things that they
[1:13:33] need that they can get favor from you
[1:13:37] which is Faith Lord Faith cometh by
[1:13:39] hearing and as we believe you Lord then
[1:13:42] you have favor upon that and Lord we
[1:13:45] want to be favorable in your sight amen
[1:13:48] we might not be the most gifted or
[1:13:49] talented but but Lord we want your favor
[1:13:52] amen that above everything and we know
[1:13:55] when we have faith it pleases you amen
[1:13:58] so help us not to be critic or upset but
[1:14:01] help us to have faith that we can be
[1:14:04] pleasing to you in Jesus name we pray
[1:14:08] amen God bless you you may be seated
[1:14:10] stand like Caleb with Joshua amen of
[1:14:15] course we're bringing this title out of
[1:14:18] the portion of the message pick up your
[1:14:20] pen brother brandham had brought to us
[1:14:24] the message of spoken word is the
[1:14:25] Original Seed 5H hour sermon that he's
[1:14:28] bringing and then as he is closing up
[1:14:33] you know the Lord is closing up his
[1:14:35] ministry here on the earth um in
[1:14:38] December of of 65 he's called off of the
[1:14:43] scene really that's when the accident
[1:14:45] happened and so forth but those latter
[1:14:49] years he was able to finish his book The
[1:14:52] Seven Church age book The you know the
[1:14:55] church a book the um the exposition of
[1:14:59] the church A's book and I talked to a
[1:15:01] minister who was around been around for
[1:15:05] many many years and one of the early
[1:15:07] ministerial meetings that was
[1:15:10] had um was around this subject on Whose
[1:15:13] book is it the church H book whose book
[1:15:17] is it and some had said that it was Lee
[1:15:19] B's book and some had said this and that
[1:15:21] and I heard that as a young Minister
[1:15:23] coming in and it always kind of I've
[1:15:26] kind of put the church age book as a
[1:15:28] second class book or secondary book
[1:15:32] until I began to read what brother
[1:15:34] brandom said about his book and he was
[1:15:37] alive when it was issued out even I
[1:15:41] believe there's a a a a one of the
[1:15:44] precious Saints here has a a copy that
[1:15:46] brother Ram autographed so if he was
[1:15:49] against the book I don't think he' put
[1:15:50] his name on it that's right uh no and so
[1:15:54] now I had
[1:15:55] the Lord had to help me to go pick that
[1:15:57] book back up and uh embrace it as part
[1:16:01] of the message and so in the church age
[1:16:04] book brother randam takes that same pick
[1:16:07] up your PIN portion uh that was given to
[1:16:11] him and he includes that in this
[1:16:15] exposition of the seven Church Ages
[1:16:17] which was not given when he actually
[1:16:19] preached the series and there's a number
[1:16:21] of things like that that he brings in
[1:16:23] the church AG book that is not in the
[1:16:26] series so um so I embrace it I thank the
[1:16:29] Lord for it and this is where I'm
[1:16:31] getting that
[1:16:33] from and I'll read a quote here on this
[1:16:37] pick up your pen the prophet of God says
[1:16:40] this
[1:16:41] here I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[1:16:44] today now let us stand like Joshua and
[1:16:48] Caleb our promised land is coming in
[1:16:51] sight even as theirs did now Joshua
[1:16:55] means Jehovah Savior and he represents
[1:16:59] the end time leader that will come to
[1:17:01] the church even as Paul came as the
[1:17:04] original leader Caleb represents those
[1:17:09] that stayed true with
[1:17:12] Joshua so there's two things we want to
[1:17:15] look at here there is standing like
[1:17:19] someone and then standing with something
[1:17:21] or someone standing like an individual
[1:17:25] and then standing with an individual and
[1:17:28] that's the commission for the Caleb
[1:17:30] group stand like Caleb stand with Joshua
[1:17:39] now this
[1:17:40] Joshua is as brother Brandon brings the
[1:17:43] type of it and I'll read it for you it
[1:17:46] isn't just the type of the um of the
[1:17:52] last day leader he typed ypes it in
[1:17:55] other ways too he types it as the Holy
[1:17:59] Spirit as our Joshua he also types it as
[1:18:02] the true Ministry or true true
[1:18:05] Minister but we know that this uh uh
[1:18:09] this uh portion of the word that he says
[1:18:13] to stand like Caleb stand with Joshua
[1:18:17] he's referring to this last day
[1:18:19] messenger the last day leader and let me
[1:18:22] let me um just share with you you this
[1:18:26] this timing element that has to be
[1:18:28] involved so as a Believer when we read
[1:18:30] this as a Believer when I read this and
[1:18:34] we hear this uh proclamation in the pick
[1:18:38] up your pen then you know it should
[1:18:41] interest us to find out who this
[1:18:43] character Caleb is and go through the
[1:18:45] word of the Lord and read his life again
[1:18:47] and see who he is and see what he had to
[1:18:50] stand against you know I I I make the
[1:18:52] statement all the time we should
[1:18:54] internalizes of quoting what I'm meaning
[1:18:57] is let's let's uh take on the person of
[1:19:00] Caleb or you know role play as if you
[1:19:04] were Caleb and would you take the same
[1:19:06] stand he would have wasn't wasn't very
[1:19:09] easy to do he was a very rare individual
[1:19:12] when you look at the grand scheme of all
[1:19:14] the people that came out out of the
[1:19:17] millions you only got two people that's
[1:19:19] ready to cross over are you serious are
[1:19:22] you kidding me are these people that
[1:19:25] never saw a miracle are these people
[1:19:27] never seen the pillar of fire are these
[1:19:30] people don't have a witness and you and
[1:19:32] you are coming up to the very border of
[1:19:35] gaining it all and and you can't get
[1:19:38] your act together you still got a
[1:19:41] problem huh yes that's in your Bible
[1:19:45] That's people greater than you and
[1:19:48] I these were 12 men chosen out of each
[1:19:53] tribe these are aren't halfway Believers
[1:19:56] these aren't second class you know
[1:19:59] people that only come on
[1:20:01] Sundays we all going to let me preach
[1:20:03] this
[1:20:04] morning these are people that take the
[1:20:06] communion right wash the Saints feet
[1:20:09] that come to the service these are men
[1:20:13] amongst men that were chosen to go spy
[1:20:17] out the land and in spying out the land
[1:20:21] we don't see that there's two groups of
[1:20:24] people
[1:20:25] in this one group that's going over we
[1:20:28] don't see that we don't see that coming
[1:20:31] back you know we all sat and listened to
[1:20:34] the same tape together we all say saw
[1:20:38] the same fruits in the land we all saw
[1:20:40] the same thing you was right with me
[1:20:43] when I saw the fruit of the land so how
[1:20:46] is it we come back with a different
[1:20:49] report something is wrong my mind can't
[1:20:53] process that we we heard the same quotes
[1:20:56] we were in the same
[1:20:59] service and then we come back with a
[1:21:01] different report put that together for
[1:21:04] me how did that happen and this had to
[1:21:07] be working in Caleb's mind to think of
[1:21:11] this but now the prophet of
[1:21:14] God by the Holy Spirit warns us of this
[1:21:18] day that should happen of this time
[1:21:23] element that would causes
[1:21:25] separation now as we speak of this the
[1:21:30] timing uh elements and so forth brother
[1:21:33] brandom says this is this the sign of
[1:21:35] the ins sir 1962 this is what he says in
[1:21:40] paragraph number 66 it says this here we
[1:21:44] all know that we are living in a
[1:21:46] glorious time for the church but a
[1:21:49] horrible time for the
[1:21:52] unbeliever and we're living in one of
[1:21:54] the most dangerous times of all yes sir
[1:21:59] all that ever
[1:22:02] was since the world
[1:22:05] began no Prophet no Apostle never in no
[1:22:11] time ever lived in such a time as we
[1:22:14] live now this is the
[1:22:19] end does that help you to see what's
[1:22:21] going
[1:22:22] on none of the prophets lived in a time
[1:22:25] like this before all right look at what
[1:22:28] he says in Satan's Eden
[1:22:31] similar about this he says this
[1:22:36] here I tell you what this is ain't the
[1:22:38] time to to start playing games with this
[1:22:40] message and playing games and getting
[1:22:42] offended about people this you better we
[1:22:45] better get our act together on who we
[1:22:47] are we better take it
[1:22:49] seriously I don't have time to lose out
[1:22:52] because somebody don't like me
[1:22:55] please I have enough time to believe
[1:22:57] God's word though and I want to be
[1:22:59] faithful to do that all the way to the
[1:23:02] end brother random says this in Satan's
[1:23:04] eating paragraph 64 said there is the
[1:23:07] God of this world that I preached to you
[1:23:09] about last Sunday here he is today in
[1:23:12] deceit that treacherous hour that
[1:23:17] tremendous time that we're living it's
[1:23:20] the most glorious time of all the ages
[1:23:22] because we are facing the Great
[1:23:24] Millennium again we're facing the Eden
[1:23:27] again but right at this age all the
[1:23:31] deceit and every tactic that he's ever
[1:23:35] used and been able to deceive with he's
[1:23:38] gathered it all together and reinforce
[1:23:42] himself and come down like God and has
[1:23:45] put himself in place of God religious
[1:23:48] and can quote the scriptures and can
[1:23:50] tell you the scriptures just as Satan
[1:23:53] did to Eve in the Garden of Eden but
[1:23:57] leave one spot of it is all he has to do
[1:24:01] is make that Gap where the poison
[1:24:05] doctrine of the devil can pour through
[1:24:07] like the thinking man's filter we was
[1:24:09] talking about the other night now he
[1:24:12] said he would exalt himself above the
[1:24:14] most high he would Ascend the clouds and
[1:24:17] stars and he would sit there like God
[1:24:19] and be above the most high he has
[1:24:23] succeeded and carrying out his threats
[1:24:27] so Satan made this threat and he has
[1:24:29] succeeded in it it's in Thessalonians he
[1:24:32] made the threat I will I will do all of
[1:24:35] those things he has certainly had a
[1:24:37] marvelous success in carrying out his
[1:24:40] threats by the people letting him
[1:24:43] explain away in every age the value of
[1:24:47] God's promise word to that age that's
[1:24:50] exactly how he's done it in every age he
[1:24:53] explains it
[1:24:55] away in the days of Noah he explained
[1:24:58] that it was impossible for it to rain
[1:25:00] from Heaven There is no rain up there
[1:25:03] his great scientific gospel he preached
[1:25:05] in the Garden of Eden he could shoot the
[1:25:08] instruments to the moon and prove
[1:25:09] there's no moisture up there but God
[1:25:12] said there would come a rain but Satan
[1:25:16] succeeded and poisoned the mind of the
[1:25:19] People by scientific research or
[1:25:22] Internet research or going online
[1:25:25] research or proving it themselves or
[1:25:27] trying to find a fault or a flaw in
[1:25:30] their research that it could not be done
[1:25:33] but it was done God said it would be
[1:25:36] done and it was done he did now in the
[1:25:39] days of Jesus he did the same thing he
[1:25:42] poisoned their minds again amen by
[1:25:46] deceit misinterpreting the word so and
[1:25:51] brother randam continues on so we see
[1:25:53] there's a PO poisoning in the
[1:25:55] mind the way people
[1:25:58] think he has succeeded in poisoning that
[1:26:02] now if we go back to the pickup your pen
[1:26:05] brother brandham makes this a statement
[1:26:09] here talking
[1:26:11] about
[1:26:13] um well he goes on I I won't get it all
[1:26:16] but he did he did talk about there would
[1:26:18] be a great a number of people that would
[1:26:21] begin to fall away there' be a great
[1:26:24] number I want you to go get that pick up
[1:26:26] your pen that the Holy Spirit told
[1:26:28] Brother bandam there'd be a number of
[1:26:30] people that would walk away but he says
[1:26:32] he continues on and in that same Little
[1:26:35] Portion if you're listening to it on the
[1:26:37] tape is about 22 minutes or 24 minutes
[1:26:39] of pick up your pen in the um uh spoken
[1:26:43] words The Original Seed and if you take
[1:26:45] the church age book he reads pretty much
[1:26:48] he there's a few things that are cleaned
[1:26:50] up but it's the same message of pick up
[1:26:53] your pen and it's to the people and this
[1:26:55] is one other thing that he says here and
[1:26:57] he says I believe according to
[1:27:00] Revelations
[1:27:02] 13:16 that the bride will have to stop
[1:27:05] preaching for the Beast is demanding the
[1:27:09] mark in the hand or forehead if
[1:27:12] permission to preach be
[1:27:15] granted denominations will take the Mark
[1:27:18] or be forced to quit
[1:27:21] preaching she so what spirit is trying
[1:27:24] to stop anybody from
[1:27:28] preaching call it what you want to the
[1:27:31] spirit wants to stop the preaching of
[1:27:34] the
[1:27:35] word and the bride will be forced I
[1:27:40] believe according to Revelations 13:16
[1:27:43] that the bride would have to stop
[1:27:45] preaching for the Beast is demanding the
[1:27:48] mark in the hand or forehead if
[1:27:50] permission to preach be granted
[1:27:52] denominations will take the Mark or be
[1:27:54] forced to quit preaching then the lamb
[1:27:57] will come for his bride and judge the
[1:28:00] great
[1:28:02] Harlot amen
[1:28:04] so we see it's a treacherous time it's a
[1:28:09] tremendous hour the minds of people are
[1:28:12] being
[1:28:14] poisoned and we have been given a
[1:28:18] command to stand like Joshua and Caleb
[1:28:22] stand like
[1:28:25] Caleb stand with Joshua so who is Joshua
[1:28:31] Joshua in in type as I read did I read
[1:28:35] it for you let me read it for you he's a
[1:28:36] type of the last day uh uh Ministry he
[1:28:41] also a type of the holy spirit this is
[1:28:43] in the adoption number four so we can
[1:28:47] bring the full type of who Joshua is
[1:28:50] paragraph 114 brother brandham says
[1:28:52] Moses being a type of Christ led the
[1:28:54] children of Israel up to the promised
[1:28:56] land then Moses did not take the
[1:28:59] children in the promised land Joshua
[1:29:01] took the people in and divided the land
[1:29:04] Jesus Paid the price LED them up to the
[1:29:06] Holy Spirit God sent the Holy Spirit
[1:29:09] down and he positionally put the church
[1:29:12] in order each man filling him with the
[1:29:16] presence of his being you see what I
[1:29:18] mean all in Christ Jesus how God
[1:29:21] predestinated this to the calling of
[1:29:23] this gospel amen he says it again in the
[1:29:27] message blind bartmus the prophet of God
[1:29:30] speaking he
[1:29:34] says paragraph 163 and he sat there he
[1:29:37] began to think yes and I remember the
[1:29:40] great warrior Joshua how my mother used
[1:29:42] to say honey just across there just as
[1:29:45] just at the Ford right down there below
[1:29:47] the city Joshua the Great Mighty Warrior
[1:29:50] took Moses's place a type of the Holy
[1:29:54] Spirit now taking see Moses didn't bring
[1:29:58] the children into the promised land he
[1:30:00] was the lawgiver but he didn't bring the
[1:30:03] children into the promised land Joshua
[1:30:06] took them over see and the Holy Spirit
[1:30:10] is the one that's taking them over now
[1:30:14] Christ made the way and the plans as was
[1:30:18] The Giver of the law and so forth but
[1:30:20] the Holy Spirit takes the church to the
[1:30:23] promised land and the Rapture taking it
[1:30:26] up the Holy Spirit In The Rapture amen
[1:30:30] so who is Joshua Joshua is the holy
[1:30:33] spirit right come on somebody he tells
[1:30:38] us also in the message as I was with
[1:30:41] Moses this is what he says about who
[1:30:44] Joshua is all right he
[1:30:47] says paragraph 37 now Joshua the new
[1:30:51] Warrior only two left now that ever left
[1:30:55] the promised land that was Joshua and
[1:30:57] Caleb Joshua the new Commander to lead
[1:31:00] an army to step into the place where a
[1:31:03] great man like Moses stood it was no
[1:31:06] little task and I think of a minister
[1:31:09] today that's called of God to step into
[1:31:12] the tracks where Jesus stood what a
[1:31:16] command what a commission but each
[1:31:20] that's called of God is commissioned to
[1:31:23] stand and in that same
[1:31:26] place I'll be with you even in you to
[1:31:29] the end of the way each minister is
[1:31:32] called to stand where he did the works
[1:31:36] that I do shall you do also each
[1:31:38] minister is ordained of God is commanded
[1:31:42] to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ
[1:31:46] and perform the duties that Jesus
[1:31:48] performed that's quite a
[1:31:51] command and how it must have felt when
[1:31:54] Joshua was standing there that morning
[1:31:56] talking to God I'll not fail thee as I
[1:32:00] was with Moses so I'll be with you no ma
[1:32:02] no man shall stand before you all the
[1:32:04] days of your life I'll destroy and
[1:32:07] devour I'll make the way clear only be
[1:32:10] strong and very courageous be not
[1:32:14] dismayed that's worry don't be afraid
[1:32:17] I'm with you I'll see you through what a
[1:32:20] commission to be given to this new man
[1:32:24] called Joshua how many needs to be
[1:32:26] encouraged like that that's right don't
[1:32:28] be dismayed I'll be with you it is a
[1:32:33] great command to stand where Jesus stood
[1:32:36] who can do it who is worthy who is able
[1:32:40] no man but he said I'll be with
[1:32:43] you and I will stand with
[1:32:46] you and the works that I do you will do
[1:32:50] also who said that and who did he say
[1:32:53] say it too
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:58] amen it's a tall order it's a tremendous
[1:33:01] task it's a a life it's not something
[1:33:04] you can do on the side it's a life focus
[1:33:09] it requires your all of your attention
[1:33:12] at all times to walk in the tracks of
[1:33:16] our Lord Jesus to Walk as Joshua
[1:33:21] walk walked amen and so we see that
[1:33:25] those are some of the types the type of
[1:33:27] the Holy Spirit a minister can look at
[1:33:30] that and take those types and apply to
[1:33:32] his own life and his own Ministry but we
[1:33:35] see that in the pickup your pen it is a
[1:33:38] type of the last day
[1:33:42] Ministry Joshua is a type of the last
[1:33:45] day leader how many believe that right
[1:33:48] if we believe those other ones got to
[1:33:50] believe this one too that's right so
[1:33:51] he's the last day leader which leader
[1:33:54] are we talking about we're talking about
[1:33:56] the three main scriptures that identify
[1:33:59] him that's uh uh Malachi 4 Luke 17:30
[1:34:04] Revelations
[1:34:05] 10:7 as we have shared with you many
[1:34:07] times that you can't replace those with
[1:34:09] the group of people this is the ministry
[1:34:13] of Elijah the ministry of the son of man
[1:34:16] the ministry of the seventh angel let us
[1:34:21] stand with all three of those
[1:34:25] and of the three the one that seems to
[1:34:27] be the most complicated one as we
[1:34:29] brought last Sunday night is this
[1:34:32] ministry of the son of
[1:34:35] man and being um impersonated Again by a
[1:34:41] son of man so the Elijah Ministry not I
[1:34:45] mean takes a lot to receive that but
[1:34:48] Elijah spoke of
[1:34:50] restoration uh bringing uh the orders
[1:34:52] back and God used that his Justice and
[1:34:56] then the seventh angel bringing out
[1:34:58] those Mysteries that's beautiful thing
[1:35:00] and a lot of people can Embrace that but
[1:35:03] this you know the the the the Elijah
[1:35:06] Ministry is one out of
[1:35:09] five men of the O of the whole Plan of
[1:35:13] Redemption of God dealing with human
[1:35:15] beings sir one man out of five it's not
[1:35:18] a large group of people to compare
[1:35:21] yourself with and against it was Elijah
[1:35:23] Elisha John the Baptist brother brandham
[1:35:26] and then the Elijah to come in
[1:35:28] Revelations 11 very small group you got
[1:35:31] five
[1:35:32] men representing to the entire I like
[1:35:36] all of all of human
[1:35:40] history one out of five and then you
[1:35:43] take the seventh angel It's one out of
[1:35:46] seven seven men that ever hit the globe
[1:35:51] as it pertains to Redemption and the
[1:35:53] planet of redemption we got seven men
[1:35:56] that God
[1:35:58] chose
[1:36:03] huh and then with the son of man how
[1:36:05] many of those do we
[1:36:08] have brother rand's Ministry was the
[1:36:11] only one that we have ever
[1:36:14] seen to manifest the son of man to a
[1:36:19] people that was reserved for this
[1:36:22] day so he came to the Samaritan he came
[1:36:26] to the Jew as the son of man but he
[1:36:28] never came to the Gentile till our day
[1:36:33] but yet he made mistakes and yet this is
[1:36:35] not it's flawed word and yet we can
[1:36:37] criticize it that's on you yes sir all
[1:36:41] right you ain't never seen a Ministry
[1:36:43] like this there is no other example of a
[1:36:47] son of man representing the son of man
[1:36:51] like this ministry show me one that's
[1:36:55] right all right of course Paul was a son
[1:36:58] of man Jeremiah was a son of man but
[1:37:01] none of them had to represent the sign
[1:37:04] of the Messiah to a generation of people
[1:37:06] to a race of people you see the
[1:37:09] exclusivity of it you see why there's a
[1:37:11] challenge
[1:37:13] there you see where the conflict can
[1:37:15] arise yes and so we share with you these
[1:37:19] scriptures in Revelations chapter 19
[1:37:24] verse number
[1:37:26] 10 where
[1:37:36] this office even confused
[1:37:40] John and who was
[1:37:43] John some guy off the
[1:37:46] streets who was
[1:37:48] John John bowed down to worship this
[1:37:52] angel yes it's like John what you doing
[1:37:55] man what are you doing John what you
[1:37:59] doing don't you know Jesus
[1:38:02] is and John got confused Revelations 19
[1:38:06] was turned there quickly twice he
[1:38:10] did can I take my time this
[1:38:13] morning Revelations
[1:38:19] 19 so in verse number 10 and I fell at
[1:38:23] feet to worship him and he said unto me
[1:38:26] see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[1:38:29] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[1:38:32] the testimony of Jesus worship God for
[1:38:35] the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:38:39] pro prophecy so John bows down to
[1:38:42] worship the Angel that's showing him
[1:38:44] these things and the angel prevented him
[1:38:48] now in chapter 20 he does it again
[1:38:53] but the scriptures opened up even more
[1:38:55] to us on who this Angel was what verse
[1:38:59] do I want
[1:39:02] Saints
[1:39:05] huh we want 22 yes that's what we want
[1:39:09] what did I call
[1:39:10] 21
[1:39:14] 20 what scripture do I
[1:39:18] want are you
[1:39:21] sure yes 22 you got your Bible out or
[1:39:24] you waiting for it to come on the screen
[1:39:28] here you don't got your own Bible I
[1:39:31] don't need to bring a Bible to my church
[1:39:32] they just we're just as lazy as we can
[1:39:34] be I don't have to find I don't even
[1:39:36] know where job is I don't know where
[1:39:38] habca is but they am in the back they
[1:39:39] know how to get it they put it up there
[1:39:41] on the screen for me you better get your
[1:39:44] own Bible
[1:39:46] Saints amen I was telling the Saints in
[1:39:49] Mesa on Thursday and traveling on that
[1:39:52] plane 6 hours in a 9-h hour flight and
[1:39:55] those long flights I first thing I do in
[1:39:58] traveling I take that one of the first
[1:40:00] things I do I take my Bible it out I put
[1:40:02] it right on that table right
[1:40:04] there and that just sets the tone for
[1:40:07] everything else people set next to me
[1:40:09] they know what I'm about people walking
[1:40:11] up and down like leave brother man
[1:40:14] alone yeah if I'm reading an iPad I
[1:40:16] could be doing whatever but this right
[1:40:18] here speaks for itself it commands a
[1:40:21] presence and then other of like Faith
[1:40:24] they'll be talking to you they'll say oh
[1:40:25] I love that Bible that's a great book
[1:40:28] and then it opens up Fellowship amen
[1:40:31] there's no book like this
[1:40:33] one Revelations 22 and verse number 8
[1:40:38] and I John saw these things and heard
[1:40:41] them when I heard them and seen I fell
[1:40:45] down to worship before the feet of the
[1:40:47] Angel which show me these
[1:40:49] things then Sith he unto me see thou do
[1:40:52] it not for I am thy fellow servant and
[1:40:55] of thy Brethren the what Propet prophets
[1:41:00] and of them which keep the Saints of
[1:41:03] this book
[1:41:05] worship
[1:41:07] God very nice amen Lord so they asked
[1:41:12] brother bradam that
[1:41:15] question in the
[1:41:18] message 1964 questions and answers
[1:41:22] paragraph number
[1:41:27] 59 if you just take Revelations 19 it
[1:41:30] shows you that it
[1:41:33] was a fellow servant an angel but
[1:41:37] Revelations 228 shows that it was
[1:41:40] actually a prophet and he ask brother
[1:41:43] Brandon this question question 382 dear
[1:41:45] brother
[1:41:46] brandham would Jesus not accept worship
[1:41:48] and Revelation by John when he fa to why
[1:41:51] would not Jesus receive Worship in
[1:41:54] Revelation by John when he allowed
[1:41:57] worship before him why wouldn't Jesus
[1:42:00] receive worship when John wanted to
[1:42:04] worship him my dear brother or sister
[1:42:06] whoever it is it was not Jesus that
[1:42:09] would not receive Worship in Revelations
[1:42:12] 228 you'll read it was the prophet Angel
[1:42:17] who would not receive worship when John
[1:42:19] fell down to worship the angel that it
[1:42:21] showed him these things he said see that
[1:42:25] you do it not for I am of thy fellow
[1:42:27] Brethren I am one of the prophets see I
[1:42:30] am thy fellow brother thy fellow
[1:42:33] servants one of the prophets give
[1:42:36] worship to God it wasn't Jesus didn't
[1:42:39] accept it it was the prophet that
[1:42:42] wouldn't accept
[1:42:44] it now you can go through and crack your
[1:42:47] head to find out which prophet he's
[1:42:48] talking about but I believe I know who
[1:42:51] it is right all right and we see that is
[1:42:55] absolutely one of those elements that
[1:42:57] follow the ministry of brother brandham
[1:43:00] it's part of it that's right it's part
[1:43:03] of it so just because that's part of it
[1:43:05] that doesn't me mean I need to shy away
[1:43:07] from everything that he said see I have
[1:43:11] to
[1:43:11] stand like Caleb and then I have to
[1:43:16] stand
[1:43:17] with Joshua and all of the scriptures
[1:43:21] that pertain to
[1:43:23] Joshua Elijah Revelations 10 um Luke
[1:43:27] 17:30 everything that applies to Joshua
[1:43:31] all the scriptures I have to stand with
[1:43:35] that and that sometimes is the only
[1:43:38] witness that I will
[1:43:40] have it's nice to have a witness with
[1:43:44] you Jesus sent out the disciples to by
[1:43:48] two and Proverbs tell us a two cord uhh
[1:43:53] uh two are better than one if one Falls
[1:43:56] one can help the other and your work is
[1:43:59] more satisfied or gratified when you
[1:44:02] have two and even three can even be
[1:44:05] greater than just one but sometimes you
[1:44:08] can't even find a witness to stand with
[1:44:12] you but the word is always a
[1:44:16] witness so when you stand you're not
[1:44:18] standing by yourself or standing by
[1:44:20] Theory you're standing with with
[1:44:23] something and what are you standing with
[1:44:25] we're standing with the word of the Lord
[1:44:29] and that's the only witness that's the
[1:44:30] only support that we need sometimes
[1:44:33] that's the only support that we have and
[1:44:36] this many times will shrink your
[1:44:39] friendship crowd it shrinks the
[1:44:42] numbers but then it'll expand in numbers
[1:44:46] with another crowd of people that
[1:44:48] believe like you amen but you're not
[1:44:52] looking for the crowd you're looking for
[1:44:54] the right stand you're looking for the
[1:44:57] position you're supposed to take and
[1:45:00] that position will always be in the word
[1:45:02] of the Lord Caleb was standing with the
[1:45:06] word of the
[1:45:10] Lord and it just so happened Joshua was
[1:45:14] twoo Moses was
[1:45:16] twoo and so let us stand like Caleb you
[1:45:20] know it it to me a another great miracle
[1:45:25] is that scripture that we read there in
[1:45:28] in Joshua 14 where Caleb says the Lord
[1:45:33] kept me
[1:45:34] alive I mean like of all of the men my
[1:45:38] age that is walking through and saw what
[1:45:41] we saw 40 years later I'm still got the
[1:45:45] strength that I had when I was 20 or
[1:45:49] when I was 40 I got this I'm 80 years
[1:45:51] old I still got the same to me that's
[1:45:53] the
[1:45:54] miracle find me a friendship 40 years
[1:45:57] old find me somebody that will be with

[1:46:45] in the
[1:46:47] Lord promis me and I remember his
[1:46:51] promises
[1:46:53] yeah let's stand like
[1:46:55] that what kind of church member are you
[1:46:58] anyways huh you know Caleb had some
[1:47:01] friends he had his he he had his
[1:47:04] associates and the Bible names these
[1:47:07] fellows yes they're
[1:47:10] named each tribe had a leader that was
[1:47:13] chosen to go and spy out the land and
[1:47:17] bring back a
[1:47:20] report who didn't know how powerful k
[1:47:23] was until this time
[1:47:26] arised until this treacherous
[1:47:30] hour it's a tremendous hour of
[1:47:34] unbelief but we starting to see who we
[1:47:37] can say high five to and shake hands
[1:47:40] with we're starting to find out real
[1:47:42] quick Which pull pits we're
[1:47:46] welcomeing which assemblies I can feel
[1:47:49] comfortable in who I can walk with with
[1:47:52] finding out more and more aren't
[1:47:55] we because that crowd it kind of shrinks
[1:48:00] down you know I remember as I said we we
[1:48:04] we I I played football most of my life
[1:48:07] my teenage years in high school I was
[1:48:09] pretty good but the team I was on was
[1:48:11] very
[1:48:15] sorry and we were sorry and I knew it
[1:48:18] but we had some good players on there
[1:48:21] and we would go play these other school
[1:48:24] they looked sharp they looked nice they
[1:48:28] had the support I mean all of their
[1:48:31] equipment matched our helmets didn't
[1:48:32] even match our equipment looked like was
[1:48:35] this
[1:48:36] donated like what was the budget at when
[1:48:39] we was going to put this together and
[1:48:41] it's like we just scrap whatever we go
[1:48:43] out there and play play our heart out
[1:48:45] had a great time but when we saw a team
[1:48:47] that was really wellb built where their
[1:48:49] socks and the wrist bands all matched
[1:48:53] and the headbands and all the little
[1:48:54] towel it all matched we be like we
[1:48:56] couldn't say it out loud but we be like
[1:48:58] we going to get it
[1:49:01] today they look
[1:49:04] nice we can't say it out loud because we
[1:49:06] got we about to battle these guys but
[1:49:08] you go back and you look at the support
[1:49:11] and so you look at in the military
[1:49:13] military they have these levels of of of
[1:49:17] of of Warriors and everybody in the
[1:49:19] military is not the
[1:49:21] same just like Israel they're not all
[1:49:24] the
[1:49:25] same and you take you take the military
[1:49:28] you take the budget that they would take
[1:49:30] for maybe 10,000 men and now they take
[1:49:33] that same budget and put it towards 500
[1:49:36] men you have more money per man what
[1:49:40] kind of a man you think you're going to
[1:49:43] build he'll be highly skilled highly
[1:49:47] intelligent all the tools that he needs

[1:54:52] we're Overcomers don't worry about it
[1:54:54] God's got your back he's got you taken
[1:54:57] care of it's already done he already

[1:55:10] Holy Ghost has said already to inspire
[1:55:15] me to Quicken
[1:55:18] me in its omnipotent speaking
[1:55:22] but the men that went up with him said
[1:55:24] we be not able to go up against the
[1:55:27] people for they are stronger than we and
[1:55:29] they brought up an evil
[1:55:32] report you
[1:55:34] know this doesn't
[1:55:37] change this evil
[1:55:39] report is still being brought up
[1:55:43] today now here what the prophet of God
[1:55:46] says here in the message spiritual food
[1:55:49] in due
[1:55:50] season all right
[1:55:53] here what the prophet
[1:56:00] says when Jesus was on Earth paragraph
[1:56:04] 58 when Jesus was on Earth he had as
[1:56:07] much
[1:56:08] unbelief to contend with that we have
[1:56:12] today and maybe more but it didn't stop
[1:56:15] him he went right on performing and
[1:56:18] carrying out his duty and God confirming
[1:56:21] everything think he done he said I'm not
[1:56:24] by myself my father and I are one he
[1:56:29] dwells in me drop down to paragraph
[1:56:33] number 126 he says this here we notice
[1:56:35] here
[1:56:36] again if the word is in us and has come
[1:56:39] to us as it did Elijah in that day it'll
[1:56:43] do the same thing that he did he would
[1:56:47] feed on the secret things of God which
[1:56:51] is hid from the the world oh again it
[1:56:55] makes the message and the messenger as
[1:57:00] one spiritual food is
[1:57:03] ready and it's in season now and each
[1:57:07] one of you can have this food amen if
[1:57:11] you wish it if you are willing to steal
[1:57:14] away from all the unbelief of this hour
[1:57:17] if you're ready to come into Christ come
[1:57:20] into His
[1:57:23] promise so we see there's a this is a
[1:57:26] tremendous hour of
[1:57:29] unbelief if you listen to enough people
[1:57:31] talk they're going to influence you one
[1:57:34] way or the
[1:57:35] other and you need to steal those voices
[1:57:38] in your hearing unplug them disconnect
[1:57:42] them unsubscribe them get rid of them
[1:57:45] move them out of your hearing space
[1:57:49] because we have enough to hear that is
[1:57:53] positive we have what we need to hear to
[1:57:57] get ready for the Rapture and the
[1:57:59] unbelief in the this hour is so
[1:58:04] great Lord help
[1:58:06] us
[1:58:08] stand like
[1:58:10] Caleb
[1:58:12] stand with Joshua who is Joshua Joshua
[1:58:16] is the word who is Joshua Malachi 4 who
[1:58:20] is Joshua Luke 17:30 revealed who is
[1:58:24] Joshua Revelations 10:7 Revelations 18
[1:58:28] Genesis 24 elizer all of it Glory all of
[1:58:35] it take one more here 1965 I've heard
[1:58:38] but now I see the prophet of God says
[1:58:40] this here paragraph 110 he said I'll
[1:58:42] give them a sign an everlasting sign a
[1:58:46] virgin shall conceive an everlasting
[1:58:48] sign now we find that in those hours of
[1:58:52] real stress that's usually when the
[1:58:56] spirit of God moves in he let the Hebrew
[1:59:00] children walk right into the fiery
[1:59:02] furnace before he ever moved a hand but
[1:59:07] when he moved he
[1:59:10] moves so it's an unbelievable hour of
[1:59:14] stress brother bam called it a
[1:59:16] tremendous hour a hour that Satan has
[1:59:19] threatened and he's carried out his
[1:59:21] threat threat he's poisoned the minds of
[1:59:24] the people and all the the deceit and
[1:59:28] every tactic that he ever use has been
[1:59:30] poured out in this age but we have been
[1:59:33] given a command to stand like someone
[1:59:36] and then stand with someone who are you
[1:59:40] standing with today who are you standing
[1:59:43] like

[1:59:59] conviction

[2:00:04] weep for the burden of the word to be
[2:00:07] manifested in his life a man that can be
[2:00:11] honest and say I don't have what I
[2:00:13] should have so Lord please help me don't
[2:00:17] let me move on until this gets fixed in
[2:00:20] my life I want to be an honest man

[2:00:31] himself open up the Deep the depth of
[2:00:34] his heart to us it's been recorded what

[2:03:55] here paragraph 14 in the message hear ye
[2:03:58] him he says now when a man is
[2:04:02] inspired and he reads the inspired
[2:04:05] word the two
[2:04:08] Inspirations together gives a
[2:04:11] result no matter how well you study the
[2:04:14] word it will never do you no good to
[2:04:16] you're inspired
[2:04:18] yourself it takes your inspiration the
[2:04:22] words already inspired so what we need
[2:04:25] today is an inspiration over us God
[2:04:30] sweeping down with a new
[2:04:34] inspiration breathing over us his power
[2:04:37] and his love in himself that it might
[2:04:39] Inspire us to Quicken us to his word

[2:04:59] way and then Jesus his word says 150
[2:05:02] votes going this way then another 150
[2:05:05] votes going the other way when those two
[2:05:08] meet it's 150 votes going the same
[2:05:14] direction the word that we have received
[2:05:17] is a powerful word
[2:05:19] Saints it it it it's not in every it's

[2:06:11] this Joshua and
[2:06:14] Caleb paragraph number 17 in the message
[2:06:18] stand still he says this here it's a
[2:06:22] nervous age what it is that's right then
[2:06:25] I give this solemn warning to the church
[2:06:27] stand still God always commands to stand
[2:06:32] still before he does anything if the
[2:06:34] churches in this neurotic age every
[2:06:38] church is appr procel liting and pulling
[2:06:41] and fussing and stewing it's a neurotic
[2:06:44] age but stand still now that's the
[2:06:48] message
[2:06:58] this Caleb here the people had just come
[2:07:00] back the spies from over in the promised
[2:07:02] land that was kades barnea they had been
[2:07:05] brought through many trials and had seen
[2:07:07] the hand of God very beautiful picture
[2:07:10] of the Full Gospel Church and many of
[2:07:13] them had become
[2:07:14] discouraged discouraged and upset
[2:07:17] because so many different isms and
[2:07:20] things has happen in the
[2:07:23] church but that don't take away the real
[2:07:26] thing God's calling his church to Halt
[2:07:30] stand still don't be jumping and running
[2:07:34] not knowing what you're doing come back
[2:07:36] to the word come back to Christ Caleb
[2:07:40] there was 10 spies that come back and
[2:07:42] said oh it's impossible for us to do it
[2:07:45] why I said there great places Are Walled
[2:07:47] and there are giants in the land we
[2:07:50] nearly look like grasshoppers to the
[2:07:52] side of them oh we are a failure we
[2:07:56] can't do it and of course 10 against two
[2:08:00] they were
[2:08:01] outnumbered but Joshua and Caleb took
[2:08:03] their stand and said we are more than
[2:08:06] able to do it but before Caleb or Joshua
[2:08:09] could speak Caleb had to steal the
[2:08:12] people first get them quiet stand still
[2:08:17] don't be running here and running there
[2:08:19] and jumping at this and jumping at that
[2:08:21] now what made Caleb so sure of it when
[2:08:25] the opposition was so great it's
[2:08:28] according to what you're looking at
[2:08:31] Caleb was looking at the promise of God
[2:08:35] the other 10 was looking at
[2:08:37] circumstances if you go to look in at
[2:08:39] circumstance or to look what's around
[2:08:41] you you're sure to fail but you must
[2:08:45] never look at what's around
[2:08:50] you how many say praise the Lord to that
[2:08:53] think of that think of that Saints be
[2:08:56] encouraged don't be discouraged be
[2:08:59] encourage look at what the word of God
[2:09:02] has said about
[2:09:03] you not only is this ministry today one
[2:09:08] of seven and then one of five and then
[2:09:10] one of only the Lord Jesus himself but
[2:09:14] you yourself are one of a million out of
[2:09:16] a
[2:09:17] million the True Believer that has taken
[2:09:20] a stand is a very small
[2:09:24] number and that's how God made it that
[2:09:28] way True Believers have to be
[2:09:32] able to follow the conviction of the
[2:09:36] Lord and that might
[2:09:39] change the Dynamics of your
[2:09:41] friends and the way people view you you
[2:09:44] might lose a job opportunity you might
[2:09:47] lose you know a lot of social things but
[2:09:51] but but you're living by a conviction
[2:09:53] and so that crowd of friends might
[2:09:55] shrink I've seen it happen over the
[2:09:57] years but it's amazing how you lose
[2:10:00] friends because you took a stand on the
[2:10:02] word and then there's another opening of
[2:10:05] friends that you didn't even know
[2:10:06] existed a whole another world exists
[2:10:10] outside of the unbelief of the hour
[2:10:13] remember brother bram's Ministry was
[2:10:15] rejected totally rejected they had them
[2:10:17] lots of people loved them then his crowd
[2:10:19] shrunk down and nobody wanted nobody but
[2:10:22] then a prophecy came said a huge portion
[2:10:24] of Heaven awaits you he didn't have a
[2:10:27] much down here but a huge portion of
[2:10:30] Heaven awaits
[2:10:31] you
[2:10:33] man what about
[2:10:37] that you take a position on God's word
[2:10:40] by conviction you have it in your heart
[2:10:43] not quoting other people but it's in
[2:10:45] your heart it's in the word of the Lord
[2:10:48] it might cost you some friends
[2:10:51] might cost you a little bit but the big
[2:10:54] picture of the Lord will give you
[2:10:56] everything you think you lost all right
[2:10:59] and so much more how many lived long
[2:11:03] enough to know what I'm talking about
[2:11:05] how many's been in the word long enough
[2:11:06] to know what I'm talking about that
[2:11:07] that's true yes yes yes yes you can't be
[2:11:12] serving the lord yes yes take this last
[2:11:17] one here all right and if there ever was
[2:11:20] an hour this is in the message God keeps
[2:11:23] his word musicians come please thank you
[2:11:27] paragraph 37 now they sent out 10 spies
[2:11:30] and they cross
[2:11:34] over come back with the report when they
[2:11:37] come back all but two said it's
[2:11:41] impossible paragraph 37 and God keeps
[2:11:43] his word
[2:11:46] 1957 they cross over they come back with
[2:11:48] a report all but two said it's
[2:11:51] impossible for us to take the land we
[2:11:53] just can't do it said our oppositions
[2:11:56] too great their walls are high we look
[2:11:58] like grasshoppers up beside them they
[2:12:01] are Men of War and they're well trained
[2:12:04] and we have no way of doing it but there
[2:12:06] was two one Joshua and one Caleb who
[2:12:11] stood and quieted the
[2:12:13] people and if there ever was an hour oh
[2:12:17] listen to this if there ever was an hour
[2:12:20] that the Church of the Living God needs
[2:12:22] of Joshua and Caleb it's now that we can
[2:12:27] quiet the people before the holy spirit
[2:12:31] all of our little frantics and
[2:12:33] denominations and running this and this
[2:12:35] has got it that has got it stand still a
[2:12:38] minute God has got it that's the idea
[2:12:42] the Bible is the answer to every problem
[2:12:45] that ever come up God has got the answer
[2:12:48] you sit still now
[2:12:51] of course these ministers who said that
[2:12:53] we cannot do this it's impossible for us
[2:12:56] to do this there were 10 against two so
[2:12:59] it was hard and they looked at what they
[2:13:02] could see that's the way it is today
[2:13:04] depends on what you're looking at if
[2:13:07] you're looking at the opposition we
[2:13:09] can't do it we can't do it but I'm not
[2:13:11] looking at the opposition I'm looking to
[2:13:14] what God Said God said it could be done
[2:13:18] and it will be done if you're just
[2:13:20] looking what not farther than the end of
[2:13:22] your nose as the expression is it'll
[2:13:25] never be
[2:13:27] done but I'm looking at the word of the
[2:13:30] Lord looking at what God Said Caleb had
[2:13:34] another Spirit on him the Bible says
[2:13:36] that Caleb had another spirit with him
[2:13:39] is what the scripture says so he wasn't
[2:13:41] standing by himself was he but it
[2:13:44] appears like you do have to be willing
[2:13:46] to stand by yourself but God always has
[2:13:49] a witness and sometimes the only witness
[2:13:53] you can find to agree with you is the
[2:13:56] word itself you and the
[2:13:59] word but it's so nice to have Brethren
[2:14:02] friends Saints of the most high God that
[2:14:06] you can connect with and share the word
[2:14:09] of the Lord with and then when I'm weak
[2:14:12] that friend can help strengthen me and
[2:14:14] then when he's weak I can help
[2:14:16] strengthen him the military does such a
[2:14:19] fine job of that they s them out too in
[2:14:21] those Seals training and the special ops
[2:14:24] they train them you know in groups you
[2:14:27] learn how to lean and depend on one
[2:14:30] another you got to have a friend and God
[2:14:33] has a friend for you and it's found in
[2:14:35] the word how many friends do you need
[2:14:39] well just
[2:14:40] one just one Jesus is that friend and
[2:14:44] he'll bring others into your into your
[2:14:47] world into your circle that you have
[2:14:50] made the decision to follow so God bless
[2:14:53] you be like Caleb stand with Joshua
[2:14:57] let's let us pray amen God bless each of
[2:15:00] you this morning pray the Lord Jesus
[2:15:04] bless you
[2:15:07] richly if you like to be included in
[2:15:10] this prayer to commit your heart to this
[2:15:13] Caleb character why don't you raise your
[2:15:16] hand and yes Lord Jesus that you want to
[2:15:19] be like Caleb and then
[2:15:21] you want to stand with something we're
[2:15:25] all standing with
[2:15:27] something we want to stand with Joshua
[2:15:30] and all of the scriptures pertaining to
[2:15:34] who Joshua is oh God you see those hands
[2:15:38] that are raised True Believers Lord
[2:15:41] Desiring this in their life as the word
[2:15:44] was preach Lord and the word of the Lord
[2:15:47] is true we have no word of our own your
[2:15:50] word is true and father we align oursel
[2:15:54] with that and those hands that are
[2:15:56] raised those hearts may you bless them
[2:16:00] may you hear the
[2:16:02] prayer oh God that they would begin to
[2:16:06] pick up this Caleb
[2:16:09] anointing go through the scriptures and
[2:16:13] find that he didn't have a support of a
[2:16:16] lot of of his peers he didn't have a lot
[2:16:19] of people that was doing what he was
[2:16:22] doing but the spirit was with
[2:16:26] him and we're still talking about him
[2:16:28] today
[2:16:30] Lord and all the other 10 their names
[2:16:33] have been written and we don't even know
[2:16:35] who they are they've disappeared in our
[2:16:39] memories they've Fallen aside but Caleb
[2:16:43] and Joshua we remember them cuz you kept
[2:16:46] them alive to fulfill your promise and
[2:16:50] here in the last day a humble little man
[2:16:53] was studying the word and you inspired
[2:16:56] him by the Holy Spirit to pick up his
[2:16:58] pen and he began to write down precious
[2:17:01] things that I have
[2:17:03] recorded in my own personal study and
[2:17:07] Lord I read those things and we have
[2:17:09] read those things the Holy Spirit told
[2:17:13] him to write it
[2:17:16] down said to stand like Joshua stand
[2:17:19] like Caleb
[2:17:21] oh God I pray you help us to put our
[2:17:24] life in role to role play who Caleb was
[2:17:29] and that will do that starting from
[2:17:32] today oh God to make it more meaningful
