[32:42] will uh be preparing to bring that for
[32:45] us we have a special friend and guest
[32:47] with us today that's brother
[32:50] Jonathan wbe I believe I said that right
[32:53] I believe he's from originally from
[32:57] tanzan or Zambia Zambia and he is one of
[33:02] the Believers from the Tucson Tabernacle
[33:04] fellowships there and he came to our
[33:06] meetings and was in a part of I think
[33:10] the Sunday night service I had the
[33:12] chance of fellowshipping with him a
[33:14] little bit and he's texted me since then
[33:16] he's a singer and a worshipper of the
[33:20] Lord and he's been wanting to come and
[33:23] share some of those gifts with us here
[33:26] and he picked tonight and he said he
[33:29] would like to come and sing and so we're
[33:31] going to have him come and sing and is
[33:34] he welcome to sing can he sing for the
[33:38] amen so come come brother Jonathan he
[33:42] wanted to sing with me but I I can't
[33:43] sing with you tonight because I we got
[33:45] to practice first so but we're so happy
[33:49] to have you with us God bless you richly
[33:52] I'm sure the musicians can probably pick
[33:54] up what you want to do God bless you
[34:00] amen I greet you in the name of the Lord
[34:02] Jesus Christ I'm so happy that he
[34:06] doesn't know my other side so I'll keep
[34:10] it that way but uh greetings from the
[34:15] pastor uh Pastor Dan says uh greet the
[34:18] church
[34:19] and um I'm brother Jonathan MBE uh from
[34:24] Zambia originally but I've been uh
[34:28] sojourning in your country since
[34:31] February and uh ton Tabernacle was my
[34:35] first church to be or this was my first
[34:40] time to be in the USA okay and then uh
[34:46] through Pastor
[34:48] Dan uh he took me to Phoenix I saw the
[34:52] brothers there then again he took me to
[34:54] Pastor CB's Church so the brothers there
[34:58] and um since I come I think I've
[35:02] ministered three times there then I told
[35:05] the Pastor said look I think let me step
[35:08] aside and help the brothers in the
[35:11] singing and
[35:12] then um I was the one leading songs that
[35:16] day of the youth meeting I saw brother
[35:20] Levi then the pastor says the father to
[35:24] that man is that one there
[35:28] and then uh my eyes went straight to
[35:31] that man and you
[35:34] know brother Brenham says um it is
[35:38] better to give a little Rose to the
[35:42] brother when he's alive then to bring a
[35:46] lot of talks and many of those talks are
[35:48] hypocritical talks because why do you
[35:50] want to say so many things when the man
[35:53] is gone so um
[35:58] I came to the faith in
[36:03] 1989 and
[36:06] then I was
[36:09] um posted from our
[36:12] country I went into diplomatic service
[36:15] in the neighboring country
[36:18] Botswana and um
[36:21] 2005 I was ordained as a
[36:24] minister I had the leral group there the
[36:27] lord gave me a church and then
[36:30] 2007 I was ordained as a
[36:32] pastor and
[36:35] uh the change of government in my
[36:38] country I was led off so everybody that
[36:43] came into foreign Services through that
[36:45] president who was out of power so all
[36:49] the people that went on that ticket were
[36:52] chased away and then
[36:55] uh while is trying to see how best I can
[36:59] live in the country a brother a minister
[37:03] from another city
[37:05] followed me into that City and then he
[37:09] said
[37:11] um you cannot be a pastor here you have
[37:15] to go back to your country because
[37:17] brother mam says a foreigner cannot be a
[37:20] pastor in another country
[37:22] so well the church was
[37:25] broken and
[37:27] um when he heard that I'm no longer with
[37:31] Zambia High commission then um he
[37:34] reported me to the immigration to the
[37:37] state uh intelligence I was arrested I
[37:40] was interrogated and then
[37:44] uh yeah the things were very bad so I
[37:48] was given seven days to leave the
[37:50] country so what do I do to the people
[37:54] Lord so some people went to the world
[37:56] World some remained some were H so when
[38:00] I ran into South Africa apparently the
[38:03] man that ordained me as a pastor his
[38:06] name was
[38:07] Israel so now you can understand why I'm
[38:10] in this
[38:12] church
[38:14] so uh I left and then
[38:17] later uh the Lord told me to go back to
[38:20] that man because I had
[38:22] bitterness and then the Lord told me go
[38:25] back because Ile with him and when you
[38:28] concile with him shake my hand my
[38:30] brother you are not the one
[38:32] okay so um then that thing left me and
[38:38] then I pleaded with him for the sake of
[38:41] the
[38:43] source can we reconcile brother for the
[38:47] sake of the source so I spoke to those
[38:50] who remained some refused to be with him
[38:54] some accepted and then um so so I gave
[38:57] those Brothers there well I'm speaking
[39:00] this because we have reconciled and then

[1:02:00] our Bibles to Matthew the 25th chapter
[1:02:04] and glad to be back in the States uh uh
[1:02:08] had a nice week last week in Canada uh
[1:02:11] had
[1:02:13] about uh eight Services there last week
[1:02:16] and so uh immediately after the meetings
[1:02:20] here after the special meetings the uh
[1:02:23] the devil come on us and and gave us all
[1:02:26] a a a head cold and and uh congestion
[1:02:30] and all that was messing with our voice
[1:02:33] and you know as a minister if I broke my
[1:02:35] leg you could prop me up here on the
[1:02:37] pulpit and I could still get a message
[1:02:39] out but if you don't have a
[1:02:41] voice uh it's kind of a kind of a big
[1:02:43] thing so and you'll notice with
[1:02:46] ministers that's always where the devil
[1:02:47] tries to attack is somewhere in your
[1:02:49] your respiratory your voice and so forth
[1:02:51] and so uh we got all the way up to that
[1:02:54] happened come on me on
[1:02:56] Tuesday uh before I left for Canada on
[1:02:59] Friday well Saturday uh we had uh the
[1:03:03] service Saturday night and I was really
[1:03:06] really bad and uh I text Brother Israel
[1:03:09] and ask for prayer and and uh and
[1:03:14] um the the congestion and all that was
[1:03:18] with me until I stepped into the pulpit
[1:03:21] and then as soon as I stepped into the
[1:03:23] pulpit it was gone on and I preached all
[1:03:26] eight services without any issue nothing
[1:03:28] in my voice everything was fine it was
[1:03:30] my voice was just as strong at the end
[1:03:32] of the eight Services as it was when we
[1:03:35] started and so that's just the hand of
[1:03:37] almighty God Amen and so we're so happy
[1:03:40] to be back I uh bring you greetings from
[1:03:43] all the churches there and they all
[1:03:44] asked me to greet you and and I told
[1:03:46] Brother Chuck at every one of them I
[1:03:49] don't even just I just say all of them
[1:03:50] said greet brother Chuck and Sister
[1:03:52] Barbara for them and and I don't even
[1:03:54] remember all the people but uh Matthew
[1:03:57] the 25th chapter tonight and uh we'll
[1:03:59] get right into the word and we'll read
[1:04:02] uh the first 13 verses for a scripture
[1:04:05] reading this was a little thought that
[1:04:07] the Lord put on my heart this
[1:04:09] morning and uh it just so happened I
[1:04:11] believe this was a scripture that was
[1:04:13] read at the prayer meeting yesterday
[1:04:14] morning is that I believe was Matthew
[1:04:16] the 25th chapter so Matthew 25 then
[1:04:20] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[1:04:21] unto 10 virgins who took their lamps and
[1:04:23] went forth to meet the bridegroom and
[1:04:26] five of them were wise and five were
[1:04:29] foolish and they that were foolish took
[1:04:31] their lamps and took no oil with them
[1:04:34] but the wise took oil in their vessels
[1:04:37] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[1:04:40] carried they all slumbered and
[1:04:42] slept and at midnight there was a cry
[1:04:45] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[1:04:47] out to meet him then all those virgins
[1:04:49] arose and trimmed their
[1:04:51] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:04:54] give us of your oil for our lamps are
[1:04:57] gone out but the wise answered saying
[1:05:00] not so lest there not be enough for us
[1:05:03] and
[1:05:04] you but go ye rather to them that sell
[1:05:08] and buy for yourselves and while they
[1:05:10] went to buy the bridegroom came and they
[1:05:14] uh that were ready went in with him to
[1:05:17] the marriage and the door was shut and
[1:05:20] afterwards came also the other virgin
[1:05:22] saying Lord Lord open to us
[1:05:24] but he answered and said verily I say
[1:05:26] unto you I know you not watch therefore
[1:05:29] for you know neither the day nor the
[1:05:32] hour when the son of man cometh and may
[1:05:36] the Lord add His blessings to the
[1:05:37] reading's word let's just bow our heads

[1:06:28] the Lord Jesus Christ and the bride said
[1:06:32] amen you may be seated and I want to
[1:06:35] touch on lamp trimming time tonight just
[1:06:37] for a quick text before the communion
[1:06:40] and uh uh the Lord began to deal with me
[1:06:42] when I woke up this morning about being
[1:06:44] more sincere pastor and you know the
[1:06:47] message that you and I have today Saints
[1:06:50] was brought with the greatest of
[1:06:53] sincerity it wasn't brought just
[1:06:56] haphazardly it wasn't brought just any
[1:06:59] way but it was brought under great
[1:07:01] sincerity and this wasn't a message
[1:07:03] today of a man but this was a message
[1:07:06] from God can you say Amen to that
[1:07:08] tonight and and and we find that brother
[1:07:11] brandham said in the angel of the Lord
[1:07:12] he said while I was sitting in the room
[1:07:15] since a boy I had a calling on me and I
[1:07:18] was sitting in the room hitting right on
[1:07:20] the floor and a supernatural being come
[1:07:23] walking into the room and an angel said
[1:07:27] he was sent from the presence of God he
[1:07:30] said if you get the people to believe
[1:07:32] you would be sincere when you pray
[1:07:36] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:07:39] not even can now now now to me brothers
[1:07:41] and sisters I'll take this as the word
[1:07:43] of the Lord and it says then uh you
[1:07:47] would ask me does everybody get well
[1:07:50] brother brandom he says everybody that
[1:07:52] truly believes
[1:07:54] gets well and he said thousands have
[1:07:57] been healed if you'll be sincere when
[1:08:00] you pray so so as brother Israel's
[1:08:03] talked about at length the the the angel
[1:08:06] commissioned brother Brandon to get the
[1:08:07] people to believe him and he said if
[1:08:10] you'll be sincere when you pray nothing
[1:08:12] will stand before your prayer is that
[1:08:14] what the angel said and so brother
[1:08:16] Brandon's commission had hinged upon him
[1:08:19] being sincere when he prayed is that
[1:08:21] right so he had to be sincere when he
[1:08:24] prayed but he goes on to say not just
[1:08:26] sincere when he prayed but me and you
[1:08:28] have to be sincere when we hear the word
[1:08:31] of the Lord is that right and he said if
[1:08:33] you'll be sincere and but he said uh you
[1:08:37] you uh when you pray he said not only
[1:08:40] did you had to be sincere but it had to
[1:08:42] be absolute sincerity and it has to be
[1:08:45] received with absolute sincerity can you
[1:08:48] say Amen tonight now in my commission he
[1:08:51] says and we've read this quote many
[1:08:53] times he he said I'm just your brother
[1:08:56] but by the grace of God when the angel
[1:08:58] of the Lord moves down it becomes then a
[1:09:01] voice of God to you he said maybe I
[1:09:04] offended you by saying that forgive me I
[1:09:06] felt that might have been resented but I
[1:09:08] am God's voice to you see it I oh God he
[1:09:13] said I say that again that time was
[1:09:15] under inspiration you see he said now he
[1:09:19] said I felt bad about it the first time
[1:09:21] but it repeated it now see I can say
[1:09:24] nothing in myself but what he shows me I
[1:09:27] say it he says you believe it and Watch
[1:09:31] What Happens so brother brandom said if
[1:09:33] you'll believe what I'm telling you
[1:09:35] Watch What Happens amen and I've found
[1:09:38] in my life saints that if you can
[1:09:40] believe this word it brings it to pass
[1:09:42] amen there's no promise in this book
[1:09:44] there's no promise in this word that
[1:09:46] believing it won't bring to pass amen
[1:09:49] amen now he says believe he said if you
[1:09:52] can believe it Watch What Happens
[1:09:53] believe what believe that William
[1:09:55] brandom is God's voice to
[1:09:58] you is that right I am God's voice to
[1:10:01] you he said brother brandham said I am
[1:10:04] God's voice to you and he says you
[1:10:06] believe that and watch what happens now
[1:10:10] is that right or wrong Saints believe it
[1:10:12] he said believe it you believe it and
[1:10:14] Watch What Happens believe what that the
[1:10:15] seventh angel will have the power of
[1:10:18] infallibility in this last day believe
[1:10:20] what that that Jesus by the spirit in
[1:10:23] every age addresses himself to only one
[1:10:27] person relative to the word for that
[1:10:29] age is that right Saints is that what
[1:10:32] the church age book says believe what
[1:10:34] that there's only one messenger for each
[1:10:37] age that receives what the spirit has to
[1:10:39] say to the churches so you can't be led
[1:10:42] by the spirit without receiving what
[1:10:44] that messenger said to the churches is
[1:10:47] that right Lord now he said believe what
[1:10:50] whether One messenger is the messenger
[1:10:52] to the true
[1:10:54] church he speaks for God by Revelation
[1:10:58] to the churches both true and false now
[1:11:00] you know I'm quoting this out the church
[1:11:02] age book but he speaks to You and I by
[1:11:06] Revelation through the messenger is that
[1:11:09] right amen amen and he said then the
[1:11:12] message is broadcast to all but though
[1:11:15] the message is broadcast to all it's
[1:11:18] only received by a certain qualified
[1:11:20] group in a certain way and he said each
[1:11:23] and individual has the ability to hear
[1:11:26] and receive what the messenger has
[1:11:28] already spoken aren't you glad to be the
[1:11:31] kind of person that can hear and receive
[1:11:33] what the messenger has spoken for our
[1:11:36] day that's the
[1:11:38] program amen that's God's plan that's
[1:11:41] God's purpose and so we have to believe
[1:11:43] this and we have to be sincere when we
[1:11:46] hear this message it's not just a
[1:11:48] message of a man it's not just a message
[1:11:51] of a good preacher I like good preaching
[1:11:53] I I like to hear it I like good
[1:11:55] testimonies but this is different Saints
[1:11:58] this is the message from almighty God
[1:12:00] Amen and we have to be that sincere when
[1:12:03] we hear the messag amen amen now brother
[1:12:07] brandom said I didn't put the quote in
[1:12:08] there but Christ is the mystery he said
[1:12:11] it's not just sitting and listening to
[1:12:13] the word amen he said but it's he that
[1:12:15] heareth my words he he that receives it
[1:12:19] amen now that's something he said
[1:12:21] there's something inside you that tells
[1:12:23] tells you that it's
[1:12:26] right something inside you that tells
[1:12:30] you it's right see there was a point in
[1:12:33] time in your life where you didn't know
[1:12:34] the message but but when the message
[1:12:36] crossed your path at some point
[1:12:38] something inside you told you that it
[1:12:41] was right amen that's God's program
[1:12:45] there something in you that recognized
[1:12:48] the message of the hour that the was
[1:12:50] wasn't just the words of a man but it
[1:12:51] was the words of Almighty God
[1:12:56] tonight that's the ability to hear and
[1:12:59] recognize what the messenger has said so
[1:13:02] we're so grateful tonight to hear and
[1:13:05] recognize there's something inside of
[1:13:07] you so it's not just if you believe the
[1:13:09] message you got it it's it's not just oh
[1:13:11] you hear the tape and you got it it's
[1:13:13] hearing and receiving what the messenger
[1:13:16] has already
[1:13:18] said it's hearing recognizing and acting
[1:13:22] on the word
[1:13:23] right see hearing it's one thing but
[1:13:26] recognizing it's something else and in
[1:13:28] acting upon what you recognize is
[1:13:30] something else is that right Saints so
[1:13:34] that's where we're standing tonight now
[1:13:35] notice brother brandham was charged to
[1:13:37] be sincere when he prayed and that
[1:13:40] nothing would stand before his prayer is
[1:13:42] that what the commission was then then
[1:13:44] the second pull came along and he was
[1:13:46] charged that if you'll be more sincere
[1:13:49] it'll come to pass that you'll know the
[1:13:51] secrets of men's hearts Hearts is that
[1:13:54] right and then the third pull as it come
[1:13:56] to pass he had to be more sincere still
[1:14:00] yet see all of these things hinged on
[1:14:03] his sincerity and if the prophet of God
[1:14:06] hinged upon being sincere then what
[1:14:08] about you're and I walk with the Lord
[1:14:09] tonight it hinges upon our ability to
[1:14:13] maintain sincerity and to grow our
[1:14:16] sincerity over
[1:14:18] time
[1:14:19] amen now keep in mind the vision of the
[1:14:22] serpent brother brand said he was coming
[1:14:24] down to the Jordan and he said on the
[1:14:27] other side of the Jordan he said there's
[1:14:29] where all the promises laid and he said
[1:14:31] he was lifted up and he was sitting on a
[1:14:33] highway and everybody was scared they
[1:14:36] were all afraid and he said a voice came
[1:14:38] and said there's such danger in these
[1:14:40] days there's a great hideous thing
[1:14:43] that's death when it strikes you and he
[1:14:44] said he heard something in the weeds and
[1:14:46] he looked and it was a Mamba is that
[1:14:48] right and he said the voice said you
[1:14:51] have been given power to find him the
[1:14:54] worst or
[1:14:59] any that's what that's what the prophet
[1:15:01] said the voice told him that and he says
[1:15:04] well what must I do he said there's just
[1:15:07] one thing that you must do you must be
[1:15:10] more
[1:15:12] sincere all right so so when the vision
[1:15:16] came and he came out of that Vision he
[1:15:18] ran and he opened up his Bible before he
[1:15:20] had to carry the kids to school and he
[1:15:22] said his Bible on 1 Corinthians 5:8 and
[1:15:25] and you can pull that up the seventh and
[1:15:27] eth verse says this purge out therefore
[1:15:30] the old
[1:15:32] leaven now somebody some preacher
[1:15:34] preached on leevan this morning didn't
[1:15:37] they does anybody wake this
[1:15:39] morning all right can I get an amen
[1:15:43] tonight Pastor you still got that dollar
[1:15:46] maybe we could pay him a dollar to get
[1:15:48] an amen up here Purge out the old leaven
[1:15:51] that you may be on new lump it said as
[1:15:55] you are unleavened for even Christ Our
[1:15:58] Passover is sacrificed for us therefore
[1:16:01] let us keep the feast not with old
[1:16:04] leaven neither with the leaven of malice
[1:16:06] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[1:16:08] bread of sincerity and
[1:16:11] Truth amen there's that word again
[1:16:15] sincerity and so in Paradox he says I
[1:16:17] took this Bible and just opened it up
[1:16:20] like that and my thumb was laying on 1
[1:16:22] Corinthians the 5th chapter e8th verse
[1:16:24] when something uh reads something like
[1:16:26] this when you come I was planning on
[1:16:28] taking a fast to the Lord I told him I'd
[1:16:31] go out and fast and said when you come
[1:16:33] to this Feast which a fast in the body
[1:16:37] is a feast with the Lord he says we know
[1:16:40] that so when you come to this Feast
[1:16:43] don't come with the old leaven or the
[1:16:44] leaven of malice and so forth but come
[1:16:47] with the unliving bread of sincerity and
[1:16:49] Truth just exactly what he had told me
[1:16:52] in the vision come
[1:16:53] God is my solemn judge come with the
[1:16:56] unliving bread of sincerity and truth
[1:16:59] that is the
[1:17:01] word now I want you to notice the
[1:17:03] elements that's involved in this
[1:17:05] sincerity that brother Brandon was
[1:17:06] talking about it was he said I was in
[1:17:08] prayer and I was going into a fast and
[1:17:11] he said I let go of malice and come to
[1:17:15] the word that's that's some work on our
[1:17:17] part isn't it amen prayer and fasting
[1:17:20] and letting go and coming into coming
[1:17:23] out of and going into that's work
[1:17:26] brothers and sisters now it's important
[1:17:28] to note that we're not talking that like
[1:17:30] the people are not sincere today I'm
[1:17:32] sincere you're sincere but what we're
[1:17:35] saying is that there are there's more
[1:17:38] that we can attain amen it's not that
[1:17:40] we're not sincere now but we need to
[1:17:42] strive to become more sincere Amen
[1:17:46] brother brandom wasn't not sincere on
[1:17:48] the first pool but he had to become more
[1:17:51] sincere on the second pool he had to
[1:17:53] come more sincere on the third pool amen
[1:17:56] so it's not that we're just that we're
[1:17:58] just uh uh loose living right now but
[1:18:01] it's a it's a it's a it's a process that
[1:18:05] we want to go through to bring ourself
[1:18:07] into greater and greater sincerity for
[1:18:09] the Lord now the word sincere does not
[1:18:13] mean pompous or
[1:18:17] grumpy or arrogant or any of those
[1:18:20] things but the word sincere means free
[1:18:23] from pretense now the word pretense
[1:18:25] means an attempt to make something
[1:18:28] that's not the case appear true to make
[1:18:32] something that's not the case appear
[1:18:34] true it's it's like telling mostly the
[1:18:37] truth but spinning it just a little bit
[1:18:39] so that it looks
[1:18:41] better all right now we see that plenty
[1:18:44] in the world today and we see it plenty
[1:18:47] handled with the word today but Saints
[1:18:49] we don't want a pretense we want the
[1:18:52] pure word of God today now he says uh it
[1:18:57] means to uh or dece proceeding from
[1:19:00] genuine feelings we want to be sincere
[1:19:02] we want to have it uh uh proceed from
[1:19:04] genuine feelings it means heartfelt it
[1:19:07] means wholehearted it means deep from
[1:19:09] the heart of a person it means saying
[1:19:12] what they genuinely feel or believe not
[1:19:14] dishonest or hypocritical but free from
[1:19:17] dissimulation which means hypocrisy now
[1:19:20] the Bible also tells us to let our love
[1:19:22] be without dissimulation but to let our
[1:19:25] love be without hypocrisy to be a real
[1:19:28] feeling of love and real genuine not not
[1:19:30] I love you cuz I I'm supposed to say
[1:19:32] that because I'm a Christian but I
[1:19:33] really love you I really have a feeling
[1:19:36] of love for you amen now there was many
[1:19:40] that said they love brother brandom and
[1:19:42] didn't is that right and we don't want
[1:19:44] we want to genuinely and if you don't
[1:19:47] have genuine love you want to stay at
[1:19:49] the altar until you do have genuine love
[1:19:52] amen that's true amen so it's time to
[1:19:55] get sincere it's lamp trimming time
[1:19:57] Saints now the first seal we heard this
[1:20:00] morning uh brother Brown said Jesus said
[1:20:02] as it was in the days of Noah now you
[1:20:04] talk to him about it see wherein eight
[1:20:06] Souls were saved by water so shall it be
[1:20:09] in the coming of the son of man and if
[1:20:11] there was 800 that went in the Rapture
[1:20:14] tonight you would never hear a word
[1:20:16] about it tomorrow or the next day or no
[1:20:19] other time they'd be gone and you'd be
[1:20:21] knowing nothing about it it just be the
[1:20:24] same thing what am I trying to say I'm
[1:20:26] not trying to scare you worry you I want
[1:20:29] you to be on your toes he
[1:20:31] said be ready watching every minute quit
[1:20:36] your nonsense just get down to business
[1:20:39] with God because it's later than you
[1:20:42] think is that what the prophet said this
[1:20:43] morning now it's time Saints to be
[1:20:46] sincere it's time to trim our lamps it's
[1:20:49] time to be sincere when we pray it's
[1:20:52] time to be sincere when we come to
[1:20:54] church it's time to be sincere when
[1:20:56] we're praying for one another it's time
[1:20:58] to be sincere when we worship it's time
[1:21:01] to be sincere at our work and it's time
[1:21:03] to be sincere at our school and it's
[1:21:06] time to be us sincere when someone
[1:21:08] ministers the word and it's time to be
[1:21:10] sincere when we come to the table of the
[1:21:12] Lord and it's time to be sincere when we
[1:21:14] hear the message of the hour and it's
[1:21:16] time to be sincere when we play the tape
[1:21:19] and it's time to be
[1:21:21] sincere Saints amen amen it's lamp
[1:21:24] trimming time it's time to make sure
[1:21:26] that the oil is filled in the lamp but
[1:21:29] after you get the oil filled in a lamp
[1:21:31] you then have to trim the wick back and
[1:21:34] and you have to trim the wick back to
[1:21:35] make sure there's no smoke or smut
[1:21:37] that's that's fogging up the glass is
[1:21:39] that right amen so you can have the Holy
[1:21:42] Ghost and still have things in your life
[1:21:45] that we need to be corrected on we need
[1:21:47] to we need to move up a little higher
[1:21:49] with amen we there's still things about
[1:21:52] all of us that we can improve I I want
[1:21:54] to be a better man tomorrow than I am
[1:21:56] today I want to be
[1:21:58] better amen I don't want to remain the
[1:22:01] same I don't want to get stagnant I want
[1:22:02] to keep moving
[1:22:04] forward is that your prayer today amen
[1:22:07] it's time for some self
[1:22:09] examination amen now the Bible said if
[1:22:12] your heart condemns you let me just read
[1:22:14] it for you 1 John the 3 chapter 18th
[1:22:16] verse my little children let us not love
[1:22:19] in
[1:22:20] word neither in tongue
[1:22:24] but
[1:22:24] indeed and in
[1:22:26] truth sincerely love is that right
[1:22:30] Saints and hereby we know that we are of
[1:22:33] the truth and shall assure our hearts
[1:22:35] before him for if our hearts condemn us
[1:22:38] not God is greater than our heart uh if
[1:22:42] our heart if our heart condemns us
[1:22:44] rather God is greater than our heart and
[1:22:47] knoweth all things beloved if our heart
[1:22:49] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:22:52] toward God so condemnation is not a bad
[1:22:57] thing as long as we're acting upon that
[1:23:01] condemnation amen it means that the
[1:23:04] Lord's dealing with
[1:23:06] us it means that God's still working on
[1:23:08] us oh God it means there's still things
[1:23:11] about us that we can get better at it
[1:23:14] means that there's still things in our
[1:23:15] life that's not measuring up but but God
[1:23:18] is not done with
[1:23:20] usen amen
[1:23:23] and it's time to be sincere about
[1:23:25] trimming our lamps first seal paragraph
[1:23:27] 102 he said and when a sleeping virgin
[1:23:29] come they rubbed her eyes and and said
[1:23:32] suppose I ought to have some of that oil
[1:23:35] too so you'd better maybe you'd better
[1:23:38] have some and the real true bride
[1:23:40] standing there say we got just enough
[1:23:42] for ourselves see you see the difference
[1:23:44] in the
[1:23:46] sincerity the the the foolish Rose and
[1:23:49] said well I guess we better go get some
[1:23:51] of that oil but the the bride said I
[1:23:53] only got enough for me the bride was
[1:23:55] concerned about having oil in her lamp
[1:23:58] is that right and he said we just go
[1:24:01] through enough to get in ourself we
[1:24:04] can't get you nothing if you want some
[1:24:06] you go pray up oh yes and while she was
[1:24:10] gone the bridegroom come and in went the
[1:24:13] bride and then come to remit there the
[1:24:15] ones that were absolutely virtuous the
[1:24:18] church they were absolutely virtuous was
[1:24:21] left outside Di and he said there'll be
[1:24:24] weeping wailing and nashing of teeth see
[1:24:26] that's now that's the elected and that's
[1:24:28] the elect and when the the sound come
[1:24:30] the bridegroom cometh then every one of

[1:29:47] it's the revelation of the Supreme deity
[1:29:50] of Jesus Christ
[1:29:52] what did he say to his church back there
[1:29:55] back in this age he said I am he that
[1:29:58] was which is and shall come I'm the
[1:30:01] first and the last I'm the
[1:30:04] almighty he said it three different
[1:30:06] times made himself de to his first
[1:30:09] church here before he went into the last
[1:30:12] Church age he said I sit before
[1:30:15] you and open
[1:30:18] door and he said if you want to see the
[1:30:21] Revelation here it
[1:30:22] is where he would build his
[1:30:26] church he said and the only way that he
[1:30:30] could take his church is back to the
[1:30:33] revelation of who of what he is see

[1:31:19] knocking trying to get back in
[1:31:22] and brother Brown said it was one of the
[1:31:23] most pitiful sites in all the scripture
[1:31:26] Jesus on the outside of his church
[1:31:28] trying to get back in now the door
[1:31:31] handle was on the inside now they're not
[1:31:34] going to open that door to Jesus in this
[1:31:37] age so Jesus sent a message since they
[1:31:41] won't open the door to let him in he
[1:31:43] sent a message that cried come
[1:31:46] out if they won't let him in he will

[1:40:55] and whatever I would do let me be more
[1:40:58] sincere thank you brother George for
[1:41:00] that we certainly thank the Lord we'd
[1:41:02] like to go right into the word here for
[1:41:04] a moment in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 if
[1:41:07] we' like to ask you to
[1:41:09] stand to verse
[1:41:15] 23 we want to remember that youth
[1:41:18] meeting on Friday there that's coming up
[1:41:22] at Amazing Grace
[1:41:23] Temple
[1:41:25] um brother axis is one of the speakers
[1:41:29] and our own Levi he'll be um having a
[1:41:33] part of exhortation there in that
[1:41:35] meeting pray for that the theme of it is
[1:41:39] Rally around the spirit for a soldout
[1:41:42] life and this is Brother Caleb duron's
[1:41:45] church he had this burden and he wanted
[1:41:48] to highlight the young men
[1:41:51] that have that are sold out to the word
[1:41:54] and and we' like to encourage that amen
[1:41:58] amen 1 Corinthians 11: 23 for I have
[1:42:03] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:42:05] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:42:08] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:42:09] he took bread when he had given thanks
[1:42:14] he break it and said take eat this is my
[1:42:17] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:42:20] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:42:23] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:42:26] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:42:29] my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:42:32] drink it in remembrance of me for often
[1:42:35] as you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:42:39] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:42:40] come yes wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:42:43] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:42:45] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[1:42:48] body and blood of the Lord but but let a
[1:42:51] man examine himself so let him eat of
[1:42:53] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:42:57] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:42:59] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:43:02] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:43:06] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:43:10] and many sleep brother banam says that's
[1:43:13] the premature death many die prematurely
[1:43:17] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:43:19] should not be judged
[1:43:21] but when we are judged we are chasen of
[1:43:24] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:43:27] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:43:30] when you come together to eat Terry one
[1:43:32] for another Terry means to
[1:43:35] wait and if any man hunger let him eat
[1:43:39] at home that you come not together unto
[1:43:42] condemnation the rest will I set in
[1:43:44] order when I come you know wouldn't you
[1:43:47] rather be chastened than to be condemned
[1:43:51] yes and so he chastens us with his word
[1:43:56] and the sword of his word that we won't
[1:43:58] be condemned with the world so we're
[1:44:00] going to wait on the Lord just for a
[1:44:02] moment we'll pray as the scripture says
[1:44:06] let a man examine himself let a man trim
[1:44:09] his lamp let him trim it and see where
[1:44:13] those areas are in his life and in
[1:44:15] silent prayer you pray for me I'll pray
[1:44:18] for you pray for the one next to you in
[1:44:21] front of you and behind you that the
[1:44:24] Lord will help them and forgive them if
[1:44:29] they've done any sins done any wrong
[1:44:32] pray for them as brother bam taught us
[1:44:35] the Terry means to wait for one another
[1:44:38] and so we'll do that at silent prayer
[1:44:40] for a
