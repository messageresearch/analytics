========================================

[Music] Morning everyone. Could we all stand? Open in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be here this morning. Lord, we're thankful for our salvation and all that you've done for us. And Father, helping us grow in grace. Lord Jesus, we I can't imagine what you went through for us. You are obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Thank you for your suffering, Lord. We thank you that we can reap those benefits today. Father, be with us now in this Sunday school with the children in their class and all those that are on the way. We'll give you all the praise and the glory. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. We're going to be listening to the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. I'll start at paragraph 40 and end after 72. Can we sing Only Believe? Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe all things are possible. Only believe. If we can remain standing for the reading of the God's holy word. In honor of that, brother Brandham is going to start with reading a scripture in second Peter chapter 3 and Revelation chapter 21. Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; second Peter 3. This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure minds by the way of remembrance, that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior, knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust. and saying, "Where is the promise of his coming?" If that don't meet this infidel woman, and since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water. Whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished. But the heavens and the earth, which now are by the same word, are kept in store, reserve unto fire against the day of judgment, and the predition of ungodly man. But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. Now the Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some man counts slackness, but is longsuffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all might come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens and the earth with a great noise shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth also, and the works that are therein shall burn up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness, looking for the hastening until the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless, we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that we look for such things, be diligent that you may not be found may be found of him in peace without spot, without blemish, and accounting that the long suffering of the Lord is salvation, even as our beloved Paul, according to the wisdom given unto him, has written unto you, as also So all his epistles, speaking in them of the things which are sometimes hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrestle rest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing you know these things before, beware lest ye also being led away with error of the wicked, fall from your steadfastness. But grow in grace in the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen. Now in the the revelation of Christ in the 21st chapter, I read these words. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away, and there were no more sea. And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adored for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with man, and he shall dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. And there shall be no more death, neither sorrowing nor crying, neither should there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away." And he that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." He said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful." And he said unto me, "It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. And I will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountains of the water uh of life freely. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son. Let us pray again. Lord Jesus with such a promise and such stern talk as Jesus himself and the apostle has given us concerning the hour we are approaching. Give us, oh Lord, thy direction &gt;&gt; that we might know how to approach it in the right way because it's coming. We know the scriptures must be fulfilled and so shall it be. Now, Lord, we ask your mercy again upon us all as we study thy word. Be with us and unfold it to us, Lord. For we asked it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Be seated. Now, I wonder if there could be a way that perhaps maybe they could turn the lights from the main auditorium off and just leave them on the platform here, which would probably be better, and take some of the current. We uh about burn up a transformer the other night and if the uh uh custodian will do that for us we appreciate turn the bottom lights the main auditorium lights off and then I think you'll have plenty of room to see the right now the subject again to announce it that we are approaching the the subject of the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. Now, as it's been I'm just going to have to do this. It's just too hot up here. As as we are I know my wife don't like me to do that, but that take my coat off. It's just too hot up here. See, you got air out there. It's just cut off in a little pin there. Now in the um in the future or in the past rather we have studied the seven seals the seven churches brother veil and those are working upon those now faithfully to get them in book form and seeing all these mysterious things that we have seen come to pass then I think after understanding that in the hour that we're living in and the position there's no one that would want to sit down real sensibly and examine what has been spoken of and what is promised to happen and what has happened. But what could say that those things are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Exactly what God said he would do. He did it just exactly to the letter. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I think in this that not knowing what time that the Lord Jesus might appear, uh, I thought it would be good, it seemed pleasing to the Holy Spirit that we speak on this and and maybe come back to it again two or three times because I won't have quite ample time to get all this out as where you hit a a subject that might be a little stumbling to someone. You can't carry it all the way out to make it plain. Then you come back again to catch the next subject. And then later on in the if the Lord willing, we come into the 12 seals not pardon me the 12th chapter of Revelations which lays between the coming of the Lord and the ending of the trumpets and so forth. We'll try to bring that back to show who's Satan and what he did, where he come from, what's his purpose, and how that his great beauty that was given caused his fall, his deceit causes the fall beauty. Then how that the impossibility for any man that wants to look at it, right? That's serpent seed. &gt;&gt; I'd make a challenge to that to anybody see that would want to look at it with with absolutely common understanding. a child can see it thing. Now, we'll get to that later. Now, we understand here that these two scriptures, the reason I read second Peter, the third chapter, and compared it with Revelations 21, um they uh both here are speaking uh uh the same subject, but John never never wrote it out like Peter did. See, we understand that this great home of the bride is to be here on earth. And now if you read just like 21 chap 21st chapter of revelations, the apostle here said or the prophet said that I saw a new heaven and a new earth. Sounds like there comes a annihilation. Now way I always find my messages is by prayer. I'll be sitting in prayer and something reveals to me and I'll wait on a few minutes and see if it's right. Then I feel it closer and then sometimes I keep waiting till it breaks into a vision. But when it begins to come and I'm satisfied it comes from God then I go to the scripture. See that is called to be the confirmation of every spiritual thing that's done because the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ. It is his body. And now in that maybe I find a place in the scripture that doesn't sound just right. I wonder I go back again to prayer. It comes again. Then I then I begin to to examine my scripture. Now our Bible is wrote in English. In English words change all the time. For instance, like St. John 14 said, "In my father's house is many mansions." A mansion in a house. Well, then you what to do with that? Then run it back to the u to the uh original and see what James meant or go back to the Hebrew or to the Greek from the first translation. And in there it says, "In my father's kingdom is many palaces." Well, then you come back to the time that the translators translated for King James, the kingdom was called in English a house. And uh the king was the father over his delegates. There's the reason they translate in my father's house is many mentions. See, and then you get those words and you have to hunt them up. Then you see from that inspiration this pull pit this morning I say not one time has it ever been nothing but straight the scripture &gt;&gt; that's how serpent seed and all these other things come but and it's really if a fellow would just read and say in my father's house many mentions if you didn't stop to study praying you'd be all confused see but just keep praying God always makes it right if it comes from God now John explains means the change and the come how it comes about. He doesn't explain it rather but Peter does. John said, "I saw new heavens and new earth. First heavens and first earth has passed away. There was no more sea. I John saw the holy city coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adored for her husband." But we turn back to second Peter now to find out Peter explains how this process will come about. Now if you look at what John said it sound like for the first heavens and first earth was passed away annihilated see and that sounds very strange. So that's what struck me and I begin to look for the word pass away. And now but it's clear that both of these apostles and prophet were talking of the same thing. And now also in the book of Isaiah now that you want to put these scriptures down in Isaiah 65:17 Isaiah speaking of the millennium that thousand years of rest for the for the people of God. Isaiah spoke of it and he said I there was a uh all the former things that passed away and how they'll build houses inhabit them if we had time. Maybe we just take time. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and read this just a minute. Isaiah 65. And let's just read for a few minutes here. And here it is right for us now to begin. Isaiah 65:17. And behold, I create new heavens and a new earth. Now, Isaiah the prophet was one of the prophets that wrote exactly the entire Bible in his prophecy. He starts out with the creation in the middle of his book about the 40th chapter comes around John the Baptist the New Testament and winds up here in his book in the revelations in the millennium. There's 66 books in the Bible and the 66 chapters in Isaiah. He wrote a complete commentary. Now we find out you're now getting the 65th chapter. One more chapter and he speaks of the millennium. Notice it. How beautiful. Behold, I create new heaven and new earth. And the former thing shall not be re remembered or come into mind. It's the pass away. But believe be ye glad and rejoice even in that which I've created. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoice and her people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people. and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her for nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thin infinite days in an old man that is not fulfill his days. For a child shall die 100 years old, and a sinner being a 100 years old shall be accused. Then shall and they shall build houses and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards and shall eat the fruit of them. And they shall not build and another inhabit. That is your farm. Your son fall heir to it or some of your heirs. They shall not plant and another eat there. They do their own planting and remain there. They got life eternal. For as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and my law my elect shall long enjoy the works of their hands. They shall not labor in vain or bring forth for trouble. For they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord and their offsprings with them. Now I want to share where I'm going to get to while and it shall come to pass that before they call, I will answer. And while they're yet speaking, I'll hear and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together. And the lion shall eat straw like a bulldock. Thus shall be the serpent's beat, and they shall not hurt or destroy, and all my holy mountain, sayeth the Lord. What a promise &gt;&gt; of these prophets and great sages, teachers of the Bible way back in ancient days seeing this glorious day come. By these passages, one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this earth will be destroyed. I make a new heaven and a new earth. think that the heavens will be gone and the earth will be gone completely annihilated. But a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit, we can see the truth of this. And that's what we're going into. It is only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's up on the earth that will be destroyed. Now we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere is above. What does it do? It uh then these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated. &gt;&gt; It has to be done that way because we are going to live right here. Amen. &gt;&gt; We prove that by the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right here's where we live. &gt;&gt; Now notice thistles, germs, all of sicknesses and things will be completely uh taken away. All this its existence that's in the earth now, man-made systems, politics, sin, all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with in all the heavens above us. and your is contaminated with evil spirit. Are we going to go deep and long in this? See, all this exists in the heavens or atmospheres and the earth which is now this earth holds those things. &gt;&gt; But it wasn't made for that purpose. Sin caused it to be like that. &gt;&gt; It was made by God the creator. But all and all of our bodies that we live in now was put on the earth when God created it &gt;&gt; because you're out of the dust of the earth. &gt;&gt; It was all laid out here. When God himself created, you were in his thinking &gt;&gt; and in him the great eternal was the thought which is his attribute. &gt;&gt; And now sin caused all this to happen. And God through this age is gathering up his material. Satan is still here. That's the reason all these things happen. He's still here. And all of his evil forces are still here. Notice that's why the earth now is so filthy. That's why the scum and ridiculous things that goes on, bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of filthiness goes on is because that Satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere. &gt;&gt; I say the atma. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Both the heavens and earth now is contaminated with devils &gt;&gt; that can accuse us before God. Jesus is there to intercede for us. &gt;&gt; See, while the accusers keep pointing a finger, they did this, they did this, they did this, but the blood still covers. &gt;&gt; He came to redeem that elected that he foresaw. That's why it's so filthy today. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Glory. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Heal. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah.

And we don't recognize all those things, but we just acknowledge you this morning and thankfulness. Thank you for bringing Brother Israel, Sister Sharon back from Colombia and the great work that's being done. We appreciate him so much, Lord, and this work that he's doing here and his burden for the lost. Oh, God. We just thank you for him. And for the brother that's here uh with us this morning visiting, we pray that you'd anoint him with the word of God. We we know you said you'd walk the aisles where we would meet together. You would be there, Lord, if we just do it in your name. So we call in the precious name of our Lord and Savior this morning, Lord, that you'd do that. We do we can do that humbly but also boldly, Lord, because it's not our thought or something we've made up, but it's in your very word that you you said you would minister, Lord, to us. And so we're thankful for that. God, we praise you in advance. Just may our hearts, our ears be open to hear, Lord, at this time, something as the very close of the age comes nigh. Lord, may we get ready for your soon coming. Lord, we give you all glory, honor, and praise and thankfulness, Lord, as we collect tithes and offerings. Not that you need it, Lord.

Doesn't that feel better? &gt;&gt; Good to see you, brother Vidales. God bless each of you. And I'm happy to be back from Colombia, my wife, and and and I we went there. We were there for seven days or so and had a wonderful time. Um really honored ministry, Brother Fabio Bernal. he would be considered um like the elder or father to that nation Colombia in in regards to the message. The Lord called him and he's been pastoring there for 50 years. Big huge huge ministry. Amen. Give the Lord a hand of praise. Amen. Yes. Give honor where honor is due. and um we were invited to be a part I've met him many years ago. He was a representative for the voice of God there in Colombia for some time. And um this last time I was at brother Caleb Pettis's church, he was there with his wife and he felt it on his heart to invite us to come. And so um I went there along with brother Mark Castillo and brother Caleb Pettis and Tommy Pettis Jr. They had a wonderful time and they really it was quite a um just give you a brief report. Are the Sunday school kids inside? They're here. So, I brought back some candy for the Sunday school kids. All right. So, that's important. Get that out there. It's in a little brown bag. I'm not going to give it to you. I'm going to give it to whoever's in. Brother Joe will take it from there and give it to whoever. And their candy is a little different. So, um just it's free, so no complaints. And um but we had a wonderful time. It was very well organized. It was over 4,000 believers. Uh they came to this great convention. His church is a huge massive building. If the Lord pro permits, we'll bring some pictures for you. but they will um take over a hotel for the international guest and then there's several hotels that they'll negotiate months and months in advance for the the the guests from the country of Colombia. coming from all over and then other countries like Peru, Ecuador, Panama, um even uh I think from the of course from the US and other places. I saw brother Dan Daniel Martin there. Um big big really well done. I learned so much. I was so blessed to be a part of it. and they will send these great buses to charter you from the uh hotel to the church grounds. And that bus leaves at 7:00 in the morning and there's eight or 10 of those huge massive buses. Well, comfort um the traffic there. Colombia doesn't have any freeways. The traffic is horrible and the the meetings are like from here to Cassag Grand. So that could be one hour or two and a half hours. Just depends on the traffic. And so they had it structured. The breakfast was included. It's really early at 6:00 a.m. And so and it leaves at 7 and I'm not driving. So we had to be there if we want to be on time. It's different. If I was driving, we would be late. But but the bus is on time and beautiful nice breakfast laid out. And then you get on that bus and they drive you to this um to the tabernacle there of Columbia and they have you seated and the deacons all in order and the music was just really tremendous just beautiful. They have a 45 minute speaker in the morning and then they have two speakers each morning. So, Friday morning, 45 minutes with an interpreter, a few songs, and then a next speaker for 45 minutes, and then they break for about a three-hour lunch. and that uh on the grounds there, there's a a restaurant that's built there on the grounds. And then vendors from all over the country would be selling their national foods and street foods and hamburgers and sweets and whatever, soups, whatever you wanted. And then the the different meats and it was just really well done. You didn't have to leave. Um and then that was about 3 hours. Then you come back for the evening service, 45 minute preacher uh with an interpreter and then another 45 minute speaker. I spoke on a Friday and the Lord blessed the all of the services were very nice. Um, but with that schedule will tear tire you out a bit and we were going going going and on our way back I got a little symptoms of a cold or something and then I was fine traveling and when I got here I spoke here on Wednesday I struggled through it and then it seemed like it just got worse Thursday, Friday and uh but the Lord pulled me out of it pulling me out of it and so I'm so glad to be here with you &gt;&gt; and it's Amen. Praise the Lord. And um we have always have beautiful help, beautiful help in the ministry and I was so confident in having our brother Jonathan Davis minister for us while I was gone. &gt;&gt; I was really blessed. Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; Just one of us, one of our people. Now, I don't believe in proceliting, but if I did, I shouldn't even tease that way, but he's just one of us. He's an assistant pastor up there, and we love Brother Ike and the saints up there, and I streamed those services. And and we put John, Brother Jonathan, to work when he came. And so, Thursday night, he spoke down in in Mesa. I'm I'm going to sit down in just a moment. I'm introduce our speaker. He spoke in Mesa, did a wonderful job, and then he spoke here Sunday, and he thought he was going to leave Sunday night off. So, I pulled on him. I said, "Come on, Brother John. You come this far. We want to squeeze everything out of you." And so, he said, "Let me see what I can do with I with my ticket." And he he he changed his ticket around. I'm so glad he did. I appreciate ministers. They're here to serve. And he just has that heart of doing what he can to help. and serve. I can sit and listen to him preach because of his life and the way he gives and serves. Amen. And I appreciate Brother Jonathan Davis and all of the saints and the elders, brother Joe, that were here to keep um the doors open and a place for the saints to come and worship the Lord. And um and so we we made it back. And as we look forward to our meetings in November, I have a a theme that I thought would be appropriate. The power to be sons of God. That's the theme. The power to be sons of God. And those meetings will start in November the 13th. That Thursday seems like this last year we just added something for the youth. That Thursday will be a youth service at the Robson's. The Lord willing. This is all tentative. We're still putting it together. And then Friday service, Friday night service, a Saturday morning service, a Saturday evening service, one service Sunday morning, and then Sunday evening, if the Lord permit, we'll just have a worship or a singing service. That's the plan. Um, food will be provided at at whatever appropriate services more announcements will come. I just wanted to lay that out there to you so you can begin to pray for those meetings. Amen. &gt;&gt; And um um the power to be sons of God. And now I was so sad that we were gone during the the the homegoing service for Mother Wheeler. Waver Wheeler has gone on to get her reward and we uh appreciate her. And I was looking in the um uh the bulletin here. Her birthday was August the 20th &gt;&gt; and her memorial service was on the 15th, I believe. So she had her birthday over there. And um a land where she'll never grow old again. And so we um just appreciate her. Um, I would, uh, go and serve her communion. In her later years, we would go there on Sunday afternoon, her and Sister Jackie. They would want to know, are we having communion? And they would let me know if it was if if if they were if she was strong enough to have it. But it was always her desire to take the Lord's supper when the saints took it. And so we did that many, many times for her. She would um weep. I would sing one hymn, maybe Amazing Grace, just me, her, my mother, and Jackie Wheeler and bless the wine and serve that in her little den there. And she would perk up and just just be blessed to follow the word of the Lord. And she'd say, "I don't know why I'm still here, Brother Bo." She'd always say that with her little sweet self. And I said, "You're really an encouragement, Mother Wheeler. If you can pray for somebody, pray for me. Pray for us." And uh so she's gone on to get her reward. We much respects to her and the family. I know many of them are traveling, Sister Carlina and them. But um we appreciate Mother Wheeler. So, I wanted to take some time to because I couldn't do it on at her service there, but I did that this morning. How many knew Mother Wheeler? Waver Wheeler. Uh, yes. Beautiful, lovely 90. How old was she, Brother Caleb? &gt;&gt; 908. So, Praise the Lord. Will you be taking communion when you're 98? &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'm going to last either, but if I do last that long, I like to believe somebody would serve it to me. Amen. And so, as we prepare for the service tonight, like I said, beautiful, help, lovely friends in the ministry. And so, Sister Amanda, she um I call her Sister Amanda. She's um Sister Sheila. How is she related to you? She's your niece. She's your niece. And she was the home care giver for your grandmother, which is sister Sister Lucille. What was her last name? &gt;&gt; Sister Lucille McCoy. How many of you know her? She went home to get her reward this year and she would stream the services she was on. And if it wasn't on, she would want to know why. Sister Amanda, it's her home care. I don't think she's ever been to our service. But when we went to do her her services and I think I served her communion once, too. She's always very warm. But she made this little plaque here. And Amanda Clark from the McCoy family. And it says, "Shalom tabernacle, wings of a dove. Pastor Israel Poe." And um that really blessed me. So I thank the Lord for that. And so I want to tell her thank you and tell her she can continue to stream. I hope she's streaming right now. Thank you, sister Amanda, wherever you may be. Uh I call that friends to the ministry. Friends to the ministry. And we're always looking for friends to the ministry. We got the other side covered. We want more friends. Amen. So, thank you, Sister Amanda, for that and uh little little tokens that help encourage us along the way. And so, God bless each of you. Now, this morning, we have a dear friend, Brother Joseph Alu. Yes. And Alfame, I thought Joseph was his first name, but he was with Stand up, Brother Joseph, just for a moment. Just stand. Okay. All right. How many remember him? Sorry. Have be seated. Thank you. How many remember him? &gt;&gt; You remember him? He spoke for us in 2017. Very short service. He did our Sunday school, our adult Sunday school. And then we whipped him out of there and brother Peterson Al Peterson took him up to um his son-in-law's place there. brother brother Mark Stroke Corp's place and then he went and spoke for him and he didn't know brother Peterson had crossed over to get his reward. So I was trying to remember because I knew he was with us but not for the Sunday service and we and I try to spread the brothers out when they come and try to make them feel welcome. You don't know what it's like going to a foreign country and then oh it's just so nice when people open their arms to you. And so I try to return that when brothers come and brother Joseph he he uh over the years we've stayed in contact with WhatsApp WhatsApp or however you say it. And he's he was back here I guess once before he couldn't come but he was back with us. This is a perfect time because when I was in Colombia um returning back, he was able to go to the services there in Mesa and to some of our friends in the Phoenix area, brother Armando and uh Jericho Tabernacle. And so we appreciate that. Those are brothers that I call on and other visiting pastors come. I know we're all busy, but when they come here from another country, they really appreciate coming to see where the prophet went. And he was so appreciative to even stand at brother Carpenter's church. He said, "I I don't even know if I can even preach here." Brother Brandon preached here. It's just a reverence and a respect. And so these are our brothers. &gt;&gt; I'm very busy, but I could stop my schedule. I could try to and help accommodate some of our brothers when they come. And so, um, he's here with us today and it gives me a chance to relax and hear some good preaching as well and get my strength back, the Lord willing. And then Pastor Brother Armando will be with us this evening. He's going to pick him up and bring him back. And so, I took a little bit of time, but I'm so glad to be home and just wanted to welcome each of you. Amen. To the house of the Lord. So let's stand to our feet. Uh brother Joseph is a pastor there in Nigeria. Is it Legos? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Delta. &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; in the Delta. And it's an English-speaking country, but they're phrasing might you you'll catch them what he's saying. It's And I know the Lord will bless you richly. And as he prepares to come, let's sing the old hymn of the church, Amazing Grace. I [Music] was was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but I see through men he dare curse to [Music] stare. I have already become. [Music] His grace has brought me safe and his grace will lead. It'll lead me home. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Oh Lord, you're worthy to be praised. Oh God, we praise you with all of our heart, all of our life, all of our strength. Lord, we give you the praise. You're worthy. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. [Music] Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we pray one more time? Almighty God, we are your children, a chosen generation. Dear father, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, predestinated to the service of the almighty God &gt;&gt; in this age wherein we live. And father, you give us a prophet with a message divine from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord God, not a dead message. Father, you vindicated it beyond doubt. Now the mouth of critics were shot because of the innumerable vindication and proof and father of light is around that article that we are gathered again this morning and we trust in you father. Lord we are not sufficient in ourselves. We only trust in you. Bless redeemer father and on today we hand over this meeting I'm just a vessel of clay set it aside and minister life unto your children I pray Lord for the pastor the wife the deacons the officers of this assembly and every member until they commit to them again and Lord you keep smiling upon them father you know their needs and their desires prayers. I pray you bring it to pass. Maybe some of them are sick in their bodies. May you touch it and bring it to healing. Touch the soul also, dear God. There be anything in our midst that is contrary to your will. We pray for mercy and pardon that you forgive us in the name of Jesus Christ. Unto thee Lord we hand over this meeting in Christ Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you. Be seated for a while. We welcome us again to the church in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. I say God bless you. &gt;&gt; Please give me some volume so that they will hear me. Hallelujah. All right. So I'm brother Olufame Joseph. is my first name while Joseph is my last name. what we call surname you know back home and um I pastor a church in Nigeria Salem Tabernacle that's the name of the church I pastor and I think this year makes me exactly 30 years as a pastor of that church though people say I look younger than my age and yesterday happened to be my birthday &gt;&gt; I was 54 years yesterday. Amen. God bless you. And I want to appreciate brother Israel. I don't know whether he's hearing me. I got to know him that uh year 2017 and it's been so warm and kind and um especially this my visit and um I appreciate him so well and um you know humility must go with a ministry right kindness must go with a ministry and um I see him as someone that consider others and put others uh in front and I pray that God will bless him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was to come to Phoenix to see me on Thursday I think and I told him he should not bother that I was good. I was in the hand of good people. He just returned from Colombia and to be uh to stress himself again to come down maybe a little bit difficult but I'm grateful to God that we happen to meet again at this side of eternity &gt;&gt; and uh he was in Liberia was it this year? this year, right? &gt;&gt; He visited Liberia and um he happened to preach with my younger brother &gt;&gt; in the convention and that seems to further seal our bonds tighter and stronger than ever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My younger brother preaches also. I don't know why. And uh one of my children also preaches this message. &gt;&gt; So we are grateful to God. We had a father that was very prayerful. My father was very very prayerful though he was not exactly of the message but he got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ before you know he passed and I believe I'll see him one of these days. &gt;&gt; So and I believe and trust that you love your pastor. &gt;&gt; You love your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is this amen so resounding? Is yes resound. You love your pastor. &gt;&gt; If you don't love him, we take him to Africa. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, God bless you. I appreciate the man of God. It takes a lot to watch over your soul. It takes a lot to watch over your welfare. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is America. But the message of the hour is God's program. Right? &gt;&gt; You right. &gt;&gt; And that is what God has ordained to lead you to lead me. &gt;&gt; I was saying somewhere was it on Friday in a church. I said God is so particular about how we live that you look at it in the Old Testament with the children of Israel in the wilderness. Even how they were to use the bathroom, God instructed them about it. As insignificant as that, &gt;&gt; God told them how to behave &gt;&gt; when they went to the bathroom in the You understand what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Our hygiene, you know, minute insignificant things about our life, &gt;&gt; God is interested. &gt;&gt; Even your animals, your pets, &gt;&gt; your chicken, your hen, brotherham say God is interested and he love to make us happy. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So you love the man of God. Thanks be to God that you have this church. That was not where I met you in 2017. And I know in America is mostly mortgage, mortgage, mortgage. So don't leave it to your pastor. That is where you come to worship God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's also your house is the house of God where we meet to worship him. Where you get your spiritual bread. So don't leave it to the pastor. Don't leave it to the trustees. You do the best you can also to make sure that the mortgage is paid &gt;&gt; so that the government or the bank will not come and send you out of this place because you default in meeting with your financial obligations and God almighty will bless you abundantly. Amen. So God bless you. God bless the pastor's wife also and the family the deacons the trustees and every member of this assembly god richly bless you greetings from my family my wife send greetings and the church of the living God a friend of mine is also in he's preaching in uh Maryland this morning brother Gideon is his name greetings from him so God bless you uh time is actually gone and um 45 minutes remaining to speak and I have a sermon that could take up to three hours. So I trust the Lord to really condense it for us. Shall we stand on our feet for the reading of the scriptures? God bless you. Let's go to the book of um Genesis chapter 15. Genesis chapter 15. Genesis 15 verse 5 first. Genesis 15:E5. We pray again. Dear Jesus, help us as we go through the scriptures. Be the speaker, be the hearer, and be the doer of the word. May the word prosper in our midst this morning, this day. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Genesis 15:5 says, "And he brought him forth abroad and said, look now toward heaven until the stars either be able to number them." And he said unto him, "So shall thy seat be seated." We still read another scripture. You can have your seat. Thank you. You see God comparing the seed of Abraham with the stars of heaven. Hallelujah. Now let's go to Matthew chapter uh 2. Matthew chapter 2. Matthew the 2 chapter from verse 9 to 111. Matthew 2 9-11. The Bible also says when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till you see it's still talking about star. Hallelujah. Abraham said compared to star here the wise men saw a star &gt;&gt; and they follow that you know to where the infant Jesus was. Praise the Lord. So star has a lot to do with us. Amen. Now we have a lot to do with stars and um right so till it came and stood over where the young child was. They saw this star two years earlier. Praise the Lord. About the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ. So by the time they could get to where Jesus was, he was already an infant, a young child. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said they they they bowed down and they worshiped him. And the Bible called them wise men. It shows that that infant child was a great man. &gt;&gt; He was an important somebody. &gt;&gt; You see these were not novice. These were not plebbeians, right? These were learned men. The Bible say wise men. &gt;&gt; And when they got to, you know, about a two year old boy, they bow and they worship him. &gt;&gt; He showed that something was about that child. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, and um uh the young child will marry his mother and fell and worshiped him. And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincense and marr. And being one of God in a dream that they should uh not return to Herod, they departed into their country, into their own country another way. God bless you. Isaiah chapter 21 verse 11. Isaiah 21:11. The Bible also says Isaiah 21 verse 11. It also says the boarding or duma he called unto me. He called to me sir. Watchman word of the night. Watchman word of the night. The watchman said the morning cometh and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire ye return. Come. May the Lord bless the reading of his word in Christ Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. So we just want to remind us about this little thought. We of course this is America and you have access to those information before us maybe in Africa. February 28 this year something spectacular took place. Right? There was a planetary alignment on earth that science announced. News medias announced it was predicted before it took place. I heard it before it happened and eventually it happened. So seven planet aligned with the earth which has a significance to us &gt;&gt; the bride of the lord Jesus Christ. So that is what I want to talk on this morning by the grace of god. No I don't need this yet. Maybe if you type the title that's all you should project the significance to the planetary alignment of February 28, &gt;&gt; 2025 there was a planetary alignment. Now we just as much as you can brother Brham said we are living in a time when the handwriting is written on time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the handwriting is written in disguise. It's written over the face of the earth. It's written in every newspaper. The handwriting was on the wall for a nation. But today the handwriting is on the wall for time. &gt;&gt; And writing is in disguise. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now brother Brandham said God wrote three Bibles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The first one was the zodiac. And if it's a Bible, God can still refer to it &gt;&gt; and speak to us from there as much as he also speaks to us from this. &gt;&gt; But whatever he's telling us through the planetary bodies, which is the first Bible, must tally with this. &gt;&gt; There must be no contradiction. I hope you are hearing me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Pastor, if you feel they don't hear, just raise your hand. I'm sorry for giving you the assignment so that I will repeat myself again. Praise the Lord. We speak English, but you know somehow. So God wrote three Bibles. The first was the zodiac. The second was the pyramid in Egypt. And the third is this one on paper. Brother said, "What happened?" He said, you know, at the creation, Moses wrote the book of Genesis and Moses started from Genesis 1:1, but brother Ron started before Genesis 1:1. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we the logos came out of God &gt;&gt; and he said let there be &gt;&gt; and there was the prophecy as he said as he said let there be the prophecy an atom came forth &gt;&gt; right and he said it blaz a well a well a well wh i r l a well he said then god stopped it and he said a star flew off of that. He said, "What was God doing?" And he said the stars, he said he caused it, he allowed to fall for millions of years and then he said God stopped it. He said another clicker flew off of the sun. Hallelujah. He allowed to draw for millions of years and then he stopped it. The prophet said, "What was God doing?" He said he was writing his first Bible which is his zodiac. And the first sign in the zodiac is Virgo. And he came through the virgin birth in his first coming. The last sign in the zodiac is Leo the lion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he's coming the second time as a lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Is that not the scriptures? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So the first Bible, the first sign is a Virgo. The last one is Leo. Complete Bible. And the prover said every age is shown in the zodiac including this one which is the cross fishes of the cancer's age which is loudia church age. &gt;&gt; Praise the lord. So those are the three bibles that go wrote and it can still refer to any of them to speak to us. Job they read the zodiac. That was the Bible that Job and his generation read. &gt;&gt; Enoch was the pyramid of Egypt. That was their Bible. But today thanks be to God we have this. Hallelujah. And it's easily accessible. &gt;&gt; Before you can read the stars, I think you must have some talent of some sort. &gt;&gt; Before you can see the stars, maybe the angle of inclination is this way or the tilt this way. It means something &gt;&gt; to astrologers, &gt;&gt; to a prophet. But to lay men like us, what do we make out of it? Nothing. But we are grateful to God for a prophet &gt;&gt; with a deep prophetic insight &gt;&gt; into the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And is here in your city that seven angels came from eternity right &gt;&gt; in Christ the covenant angel not in his corporal body to fulfill the scriptures revelation chapter 10. So now as to fudge ahead we uh brother also taught us that God first of all shows his major events in the heavens before he declared them on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And friends we are so important the brand of Christ so important but sometime we don't even realize it. &gt;&gt; We see ourselves as commoners. If guy is not taking I think I can calm down. If guy is not taking church he will value your citizenship as an American better than being a child of God. If is not taking you will be more conscious of you being an American citizen than you being a son of the living God. &gt;&gt; You sang a song here if I got it well. I'm glad to be part of his family. &gt;&gt; Me become a revelation to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if it becomes a revelation, you being an American citizen will be so secondary to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because God will destroy America. &gt;&gt; God will destroy Africa. Australia will be this entire world will be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's coming a kingdom &gt;&gt; that can never be destroyed. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So we are so important that before certain event takes place about the bride heavenly bodies has to declare it. &gt;&gt; Now I just have to quote this just show God show his major event in the heavens before he declared them on the earth. And um of course you know brother Brandon preached the seven church ages in Jeffersonville. And while he was teaching on this last church age, the Ludician church age, remember the pillar of fire came and drew the condition of the edges at the back of the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; The exact way he drew it on the board, &gt;&gt; right? And in 1964, shortly before the pope of Rome made his way to Israel. Remember the heavenly body, God used the moon is part of the zodiac. He's part of the planetary body. God used the moon to declare the state of the church. Six ages the I mean scientists the pictures could pick it but the seventh age was total darkness &gt;&gt; and camera is not used to darkness so it's not it showed nothing but something was there because church age has rejected the word &gt;&gt; and the crowd they rejected according to revelation 3:14 is the message of the hour &gt;&gt; it's not what Jesus in the air or in heaven what ladia rejected what they push out of the church is this message, &gt;&gt; not something else. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so we Yeah, that happened. Of course, you know the rainbow, I mean the ring-shaped cloud, how God after the angels left the prophet, then they were returning, he drew it. He showed those things in the sky. Give me the first code. 6 64830mm. Hallelujah. 6430 0830mm. Now I think I will quote it because of our time. Brother Bronham said in this see if they could feature it on the screen 94 96 brotherham says that in CO that you are born under a certain star. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; in a certain month. Mine is August yours may be January. It means something brother. Heaven is in charge of the earth. Nothing just happened for happiness sake. Heaven is in charge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now if there's no influence from any other power, you leave this pit here, you come back after 100 years, you miss it, you meet it exactly the way you left it. But if you leave this pit after 20 years, you are not coming back to meet it the way it is today. He showed us an influence from somewhere because he will tear down. &gt;&gt; If there's no influence from somewhere, you will have remained the exact way is made. So heaven is in charge of the earth. I'm waiting for the quote. So you were born under a certain star in a certain month under certain something that has something to do with you. This is it. And this person that's in you which is your birth. You are John Doe for example. You say you were born in a certain month and you were born under a certain star. You were born under a certain thing and that has something to do what to do with you. Certainly does. Praise the Lord. I know papa used to say that uh brother Ron said the father told him that he could not plant potatoes in the dark of the moon. That is when the moon is absent. He told him Billy you cannot plant them potatoes this time because the moon is absent and brother will tell the father he said daddy I'm pling planting it in the earth I'm not planting it in the moon. And Charles Broner will tell him he said go ahead smart alec you have some bombs on your head it's there if you read it but I have to quot it so that you can go faster right and brother says it says you know in the absence of the moon if you take a board b a r d if you take a board and use it to cover the grass in the absence of the moon he said the grass will die. He said but when the moon he said but in the presence of the moon when the moon is on you use the same board to cover the same grass or to cover a grass brother said the grass could be there for one week and it will not die. So heaven governs the earth. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And you know moon is what controls the tide. &gt;&gt; Moon controls the tide. No. And it was only the earthly system that fell. The heavenly system did not fall. Everything is still intact. The way God fixed them in there from the day of their creation. Hallelujah. All right. And he spoke on more things on that. But let's just leave that. So don't forget that you were born under a certain star. I was born under a certain star that has to do with my life. It influences you. That is all of us here. We don't behave alike. &gt;&gt; Some are gentle, some are calm, some are quiet, some are not quiet. Right? &gt;&gt; Some are introvert, some are extrovert. And yet they are Christians filled with the Holy Spirit. Some are very very sequential. They finish with one before they go to two. They deal with two before they go to three. But some don't care. And yet they are Christians filled with the Holy Spirit. Something is responsible for that. There's an influence from the celestial world that controls us here on earth. He compare Abraham seed to stars. And brother Abraham says, "Do you realize that you represent a star in heaven and every star in heaven represent you?" Did you know God told Abraham that his seed will be like the stars of heaven? Hallelujah. Now when Christ Jesus was born, how many stars aligned? Three stars came into constellation and the prophet said these stars are the stars of Ham, Shem and Jaffet people, the Jews, the Gentiles and the Samaritans. You see these stars represent all the races of the peoples of the earth, right? And they came together to signify the birth of that boy. I'm sorry. In quotes, to signify the birth of baby Jesus. And brother Brham said said when those stars came in constellation, he said they made an announcement of the birth of an infant Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The astronomical heaven came together. The astronomical heaven came together at the birth of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Who wrote what's his first Bible? Is it not the zodiac? &gt;&gt; Who placed the stars in their place? Is it not God? &gt;&gt; Now the uh how will I put it now? Those pointed luminous lights in our evening skies are not the only thing that are known and color. I mean that are known as stars. You hear me? We have stars in the evening, right? We pointed you know edges and stuff. That's what we call star. But I'm telling us that is not only those ones that are called star. Moon is a star. The sun is a star. Pluto is a star. Mars is a star. Mercury is a star. All those things are stars. Praise the name of the Lord. So all those things are stars. Now when Jesus was born, three stars came together. God moved this one, moved this one, moved that one from their orbit, and they met &gt;&gt; and they were wise men, astrologers to complete their academic astronomy in Babylon. Brothers, actually they were Jews. They were in Babylon to complete their uh their studies on uh astronomy. They saw the stars, the way he moved. Come on, church. The way the stars came together, the angular inclination, the facial appearance, the densiness. They say something is about this. They were able to read it. Then they went back. Hallelujah. That was they could look at the zodiac. Then they came back to this. &gt;&gt; Come on. And they refer back to the prophecy of Baham. Yes, &gt;&gt; there shall rise a star &gt;&gt; out of Jacob. &gt;&gt; Then they knew that baby Jesus must be born in Bethlehem. And they started following the star, following the star, following the star. And when they got to the gate of Jerusalem, the g the star disappeared because brother Abraham said it was their time to scatter the light. And they truly moved Jerusalem with their with their message. Where is he that is born king of the Jews? &gt;&gt; And Herod heard it. You know what Herod said? Let's leave that. He will take our time. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Three stars came in alignment when Jesus was born. Showing that that gift was for the entire peoples of the earth, &gt;&gt; not for the Jews alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And may I say this, you have access to this information. America is the land of the message. As I often say, Israel is a land of the Bible, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Muki can never till through eternity, we still be talking about Tusa. That's where seven angels came from eternity, right? &gt;&gt; We cried the covenant angel rainbow over his head. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; As I was coming into to I mean Tin, we say Tukin, but you pronounce it as Tin, right? I said what a privilege. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To come into this city. You may not it may not mean anything to you but it mean a thousand to me. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Heavenly guest God Almighty Jes. He came down to give him the revelation of this great book &gt;&gt; and it became a new book. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; The first time I came into Arizona I said no wonder God chose this place to make a servant. is a desert play but it has its own unique beauty &gt;&gt; and appearance. The topography is marvelous. Is only God that can sculpt that. &gt;&gt; So now also church I want to say this don't forget that brother was born under the same zodiac sign &gt;&gt; that Jesus was born. &gt;&gt; Who identify Jesus? Who identify Jesus star? Astronomers who identify brother Bernham stars astronomers, &gt;&gt; stargazers, &gt;&gt; of course you know it. It was in the great hands. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that heavy set woman &gt;&gt; an astronomer, a stargazer &gt;&gt; that could read the planetary body &gt;&gt; and it could she knows what it means. &gt;&gt; The sun can be like this. The moon can be like this. And the woman could know. &gt;&gt; Astronomers star gazers they are talented to do that. He said this is what it means. This is the implication. &gt;&gt; Disaster is about to happen. Blessing is in the offing. &gt;&gt; So it was an astronomer that told him, he said, "You were born under a certain sign." &gt;&gt; He said, "I can tell." Of course, you know the story. The prophet did not want to attend to the woman. &gt;&gt; He said, "You were born under a certain sign." &gt;&gt; Yes. He said, "Do you know that I can tell you the very date you were born?" Brother Van say you can't. He say I can. And he say you were born in April 6, &gt;&gt; 1909 at 5:00 in the morning. Come on brother. &gt;&gt; How was she able to identify that? &gt;&gt; Because they said brother had an oral &gt;&gt; the color of his anointing. &gt;&gt; So they saw that he said tell you say Lord the day he was born she said I can't do that. because he was born under a certain story. Brother Brham and Jesus Christ were born under the same zodiac sign because the ministry of brother Brandham was the ministry of Jesus Christ reincarnated and the ministry was not only for the Americans for the entire world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know the attitude of brother &gt;&gt; he was homely with the whites. He was very homely with the blacks. &gt;&gt; Very homely with the Indians. very homely with the red Chinese, very homely with the brown, very homely with all the races of the people of the earth. Because the gift was for all the peoples of the earth, &gt;&gt; for the Jew, for the Samaritans, and for the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; That is what the same stars that constellated when Jesus was born also came together when brother Brham was born. &gt;&gt; Though some worship him, well, he's permitted. But brother Brham is not God. is a servant of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now church. So they were born under the same zodiac. Now let's go to end time seat sign. Yeah. The end time seat sign program 154. Let's be fast. End time seat sign. Program 154. We see what it says. Okay. Now brother said don't fail to get this. I think we have 20 more minutes. Don't fail to get this. Where is it? Just a moment. Yeah. Now look paragraph 154 first. Let's go to 155. I don't know the one again. Now just one thing here. Listen before we close. You said don't fail to find this now. Before the first coming of Jesus, the astron astronomers of India. I think I've quoted this. Let's go to 59. Paragraph 59 of this book. Amen. I said amen. &gt;&gt; If I say amen, you say amen. &gt;&gt; If I say hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen is a heavenly word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah is a heavenly word. &gt;&gt; Those are the words in heaven that God released to us. &gt;&gt; That's why amen is amen in any language under the sun. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah is hallelujah. No interpretation. Abraham said they are heavenly words. &gt;&gt; Amen and hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now, Brother Brham says we see a roar in the papers. We see a roar in the papers across the television out across the nation. I will quote this also because of our time. Brother said Indian astronomers they predicted in uh first or second week of February in 1962 the five stars will come in alignment. I want to say this if I pin myself to reading it we take our time. Are we in church? Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother say Indian astronomers they predicted that five stars how many stars came in alignment when Jesus was born? Thank you. Three. So when in 1962 brother say in the end astronomers is in this book and also come on our reader they predicted that five stars will come in alignment in 1962 and it was February in the month of February. Why February? I think seven angels came from eternity in February. February 28th right here. Thank you brother. Though some are saying brother Brana was not there he was here. He was there. America will say garbage. &gt;&gt; If brother Brana was not there who would have been there who was qualified to receive the Lord of glory from eternity &gt;&gt; though in his angelic body not in his corporal body. &gt;&gt; What are we talking about? If brother was not connected with the ringshaped cloud, we are wasting our time here. There's no redemption for the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; We don't need to mind that is permitted. The truth came from America. Arrow also has to come from America because when Jesus plant the planted the wheat, the enemy came right beside it to plant not in another field, the same field. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Soon now five stars came in alignment. The uh Indian astronomer predicted that in in the first part of February 1962 that five stars will come in alignment. May God just help us &gt;&gt; right? And brother say American newspapers you know your country they make fun of it. He said American newspapers made fun of it. He said and they also said that the world will burst the earth will burst like a watermelon. Brother say he did not believe that the world will bust like watermelon. He said but it is wrong to make fun of it. He said because to him it has spiritual significance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He say it has spiritual significance. Let's go to the communion. Let's go to the other one. Hallelujah. Let's go to the communion. I'm jumping now, but that's okay. Let's go to communion. That is 62. Where is it now? Hallelujah. 62. The communion I wrote there. I just bring it out. I can't get it now. So that I will uh list that out before we go. I gave there's a communion there. 62031 something. Yeah. Paragraph 74. Now in paragraph 74 of that book, let's see what the prophet said in there. We've quoted all this. God Almighty helping us. Okay. Paragraph 74 of 6204 communion. I will have to read this now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anywhere we reach when the time get we just leave it. Now paragraph uh 74 it says we see that the astronomers are predicting sometimes in the early part or the first part of the month beginning uh beginning on the second or the 5th or somewhere along this month that was February. Hallelujah. 6204 this is your dating pattern. This is America dating pattern. The 02 there mean February. Is it February or February? &gt;&gt; All right. The second month of the year. &gt;&gt; That's when they predicted that this will take place. And we had a similar thing again this same year, February. Why February? No. The Indian astronomer predicts that the world will blow to to pieces and the American newspapers make fun of it. I do not believe the world is going to blow to pieces. But I do say it is wrong to make fun of you because something is fixing to happen. What did the prophet say? Something is fixing to happen. Hallelujah. Now some of one of these days something similar to that when the five planets Mars, Jupiter and Venus. He mentioned three and so forth. But thank God he put and so forth. They never have did it. Brother Vanam said they never have come together. Five. They never have did it. Oh, they claim maybe 25,000 years ago, but who was back there to know it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I predict, brother Ram say, I predict that this has a spiritual application. &gt;&gt; Astronomers had a prediction. Brother Ram pick it up. He say has a spiritual application. I believe it the coming in of the issue of God that the great revelations of the word of of the word will be open during this time. &gt;&gt; Remember the claim it was three stars came into their orbit when Jesus was born &gt;&gt; and the very following year allelujah angels came from eternity and the seven seals were opened. &gt;&gt; The word of the living God was open to the bride and that is what it takes to bring the bride of Christ to perfection. Creeds and dogmas will not do it. &gt;&gt; Our senses will not do it. Hallelujah. And church of the living God, we have to walk by this message. &gt;&gt; He your pastor pass an instruction to you is not dictating over you. He's giving you something that will give you life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You hear what I said? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I said if your pastor gives you an instruction, I'm using the word instruction. I'm not missing word because the pastoral office authorizes him to do that. And if you're a believer, you carry it out. Brother said, "Listen to your pastor." Lord, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. I don't know the paragraph. Maybe 70 to 80. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. 84. He said, "Listen to your pastor." Right? He said he will lead you through because God has given him the instinct &gt;&gt; to lead you through. &gt;&gt; And as a sheep, you can't lead yourself. It takes the shepherd to do that. &gt;&gt; Is an authority, is an office, is an inspiration, is an understanding. The pastoral office is an understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you the sheep cannot come in there. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; How many people governs America? Is it not President Donald Trump? How many president do you have? I'm asking us a question answer so that be fast. Church, &gt;&gt; we have only one president, right? &gt;&gt; He's the one that has a rule. &gt;&gt; We read in Nigeria, executive order, executive order, executive order. Go and challenge it. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. And this one is more important than the presidential office. &gt;&gt; Is to walk on the faith of the children of God. Is to walk on their welfare. Is to work on their health. Walk on their marriage. Walk on their family. &gt;&gt; Listen to your pastor. &gt;&gt; If you want to make heaven, &gt;&gt; can I tell you something else, brother? Say listen to your pastor. the one that preaches the word to you so that you can be born again filled with the Holy Spirit and also be healed. &gt;&gt; It's a quote. So now while we forge ahead, give us the quotes. Thank you very much. He says he believe it has a spiritual application. The five stars coming together in alignment in 1962 February. He say believe he has a spiritual application that he believe is the coming in of the issue of God that the great revelation of the word of the Lord will be given. Hallelujah. And God oh mercy goodness. He said now remember it was five planets. Three say three is a number of perfection. &gt;&gt; God has his numerals. &gt;&gt; God has his numbers. &gt;&gt; We have one to 100 to 1 million. But God don't bother himself about our numbers. He just pick the one he want and then he throw the rest to us. One you know is unity. Two is weakness. Three is our perfection complete. Yeah. Perfection. Four is our God. Five is what? Grace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Three Christ Jesus was born. Five. What was to happen? You know why we continue? And um you said but this is this is five. Three is a number of perfection. Five is a number of grace. G S U S F A so forth number of grace. God ever send his power to the church. It to be by his grace. &gt;&gt; I was so grateful when he sang Amazing Grace before I came to the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 42. Let's go to Isaiah chapter 40. Brother Brham says, "If God ever send his power to the church, it will be by grace. If God ever heal you, it will be by grace. If God ever save you, it will be by grace. If God ever bless you, it will be by grace. He give us a prophet is by grace. They say heaven for us is by grace. Not because we deserve it. &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 40. Isaiah 40 is by grace. The Bible says here in Isaiah 40, it say comfort comfort my people. Right? Isaiah 40 verse1. That was what Isaiah, God was telling uh Israel to Isaiah, he said, "Comforty, comforty, my people." Amen. He's not on the screen. He said, "Tell her that her warfare is over." &gt;&gt; He's on the screen now. All right. But I can't see. No. Isaiah 40. Yeah, you are living. Yeah, I want Isaiah 40. The prophet quoted it. That's why I want to read it because the prophet said if we get anything good from God is because of grace. Who is worthy of heaven here? Come on church. Who is worthy of heaven? Who is worthy of brother Abraham? Who is worthy of the message of the hour? I meant it on Thursday. I say how will I enter here and preach the message where the prophet of the Lord stepped into. And I learned when he's entering a congregation, you know that brother Brandham was entering the presence of God was so the presence of God was so overwhelming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So who deserve that? Who deserves heaven? We don't even deserve good food. I said we don't deserve good food. We deserve to die and go to hell &gt;&gt; and suffer here on earth with excruciating pains. is the grace of God that makes us healthy and to be alive. Is the grace of God that give us good clothes to wear. Is the grace of God that gives us a church that gives us a pastor that gives us church members that gives us people that believe this message. &gt;&gt; It' be more frustrating if it's only pastor Israel and the wife that are here clapping their hand. But now it's more wonderful. We have 1 2 3 4 5 XYZ. So the worship is sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. &gt;&gt; Is the grace of God that brought people together to believe this message. The hardest thing to believe on earth is the message. &gt;&gt; So you have to you have to believe it by predestination. &gt;&gt; Apart from that you can't. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now he said comfort comfort my people said God said your God. speak it comfortably to Jerusalem and crown to her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she had received of the Lord's hand double for her sin as at this time brotherham say Israel was in idolatry as at this time that this scripture this prophecy was given Israel was worshiping idol she was in idolatry but God chose not to see it God turned a blind eye to what Israel was doing and he chose to pass a message of comfort. &gt;&gt; He said comforty comfort my people. If we have anything good is because of the love of God is because of the amazing grace. We do not deserve it to begin with. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love to keep malice. We love to backbite. We love to do those wrong things. Right? And those that does those things are not children of God. But the mercies of the Lord even sometime as believers. God help us. &gt;&gt; And one of the most horrible thing you can do is to speak bad about your past. He didn't send me to say that. That's one of the most horrible thing you can do. He come to me. I want to say it. If you feel he offend you, go to him. Right? &gt;&gt; Go to him. He said, "Brother Paul, I'm so sorry. Don't be offended. I you did this. You did this, you did this. I don't like you hurt my feeling. &gt;&gt; That's the message. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. Matthew chapter 18. &gt;&gt; Anybody hot to go to him, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Don't keep it. &gt;&gt; You will not make the church to be healthy. You are you are begrudging your pastor, begrudging the wife and you are coming to listen to him preach &gt;&gt; and the wife will play the keyboard. How would that benefit you? It's not in my note, but it's in my mind to say it can benefit you for nothing. Hallelujah. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Our time is just flying off. Oh, mercy goodness. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now we leave this. Brother Ron says, let's continue with that our our quote. He said, now so in my it may mean something. He say I predict that there'll be there will be a ch there will be a change. I don't know be what it will be but I believe it's fixing to happen. We are on it right now. Brother Brandham said the five stars that aligned right was intro. He said it was an introduction. He say it was for the birth of an infant church. Are you there? &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Time now is against us now. Time is against Let's go to 159. Let's go to 159 of the end times seat sai program 159 of the end time seat sai and um this is what came to my mind to say here and if I pick something else it could mean something else sometimes to disobey God and um now 159 of the new what happened we see a in the paper across the television across the nations where five stars where five stars I think we can read it together now where five stars just uh did what? &gt;&gt; Fell in line with the world. &gt;&gt; Five is grace. Now how will I explain? There's no board. I will have drawn a little something. You know that here the planets revolute around the sun, &gt;&gt; right? In their orbit. They say we have nine planets. Here is the sun. The earth is somewhere, right? And the Pluto boom round and Mercury round all of them they go around in a circular format. Is that not then all of a sudden? Amen. How will I explain this? All of a sudden as they were going Mars reached this point in a straight line with the earth. Jupiter reached the same point. Mercury reached the same point. Uh Saturn reached the same point at the same time. They were on a straight line, right? So God make the astronomic bodies to be on a straight line with the earth to make an announcement that my church, my bride is been born. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Okay, this is it." He said, "We see a ro." He said, "A number of grace." He said, "Where five stars, John fell in line with the world." What is five? A number of grace. And brother say every time those stars come, what did he say? Then something happens on earth. &gt;&gt; And in February 25 28 those stars came again, brother say every time those stars come, he say something happens on the earth. What taking place? Five star fell in. What was it? A introducing what? Since then, you said just look what happened. Germany almost washed up the map. Go off sister. He said over 70,000 about 70,000 houses were destroyed in England in 1962 because God was talking to us through the first Bible. He allowed five planets to come in alignment with the earth telling us that I am introducing the birth of my infant bride. My bride is beginning in her infancy. And the very following year here in your country, seven angels came from eternity with Christ the covenant angel to give him the revelation of the seven seals. Right? The very word that will bring the bride to perfection. &gt;&gt; Are you there? And brother said right then he said the the bride of he said the bride of Christ has come under the power of the word of the living God. Now, a baby that was born in 1962 is still an infant tonight. I'm asking us a question. A baby that was born in 1962 is still a baby in 2025. Come on. I want to hear all of us. &gt;&gt; Right. So now, oh God have mercy upon us. Time is a bad enemy. Amen. So the brain he said an introducing of what he said my said this England the other day like to wash up. Let's go to 161 161 which says this. He says what happened an infant church. Hallelujah. A bride I hope I'm not shouting please. &gt;&gt; A bright infancy that the power of God has be to fall on her. She's taking form a bride for this bridegroom. That three star meant the perfection of the heavenly father of the trinity becoming one on earth among us. God offices becoming one office. He said what happened now? It the church of the living God coming together under the word of God and the astronomic heaven is announcing her approach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, in our wedding ceremony, when the groom is coming, no much noise. When the groom is coming, in our wedding ceremonies, when the groom is coming, no much noise, &gt;&gt; nobody seems to pay attention. But brother, once the bride is ready to come in, but we all guitar be playing, keyboard will be playing, everything will be playing, the whole thing, I mean the whole situation will get desperate. &gt;&gt; Everybody will be looking, everybody will be looking. Where is the bride? Who is the bride? &gt;&gt; And the train will be entering one by one. So church, almighty God is showcasing the bride. &gt;&gt; And he allow five stars to align with the earth. In 1962, brother say an introduction of what? He say it's an introduction of the infant bride. That was the birth of the bride church &gt;&gt; in 1962. And she had is it 53 or 63 years? is 62 down here. You mathematics you help us. How many years? 1962 from 2025. Is that not 63 years? That should be 63 years. That is to say the brother of Christ has had the privilege and the opportunity to come to church, sing the songs of Zion, hear the preacher preach, we pray. Hallelujah. We do everything we can do. time meeting convention, pumping in the scripture, pumping in the word of God to make sure that we come to maturity. &gt;&gt; And I can tell you tonight that the bride of Christ has come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Three stars announced the birth of an infant Christ. Five stars announce the birth of an infant church. 97 stars. The work is complete. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Because seven means completion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm sorry, pastor. A few more minute. Give give us the picture. I I will close you here.

He mentioned Mars, Jupiter, Venus. &gt;&gt; Those were the stars. The astronomer said we come in line with the earth. Right? And the prophet said to him, it has a spiritual significance. &gt;&gt; Right? He said is a coming in of the issue of God that God is to bring the great revelation of the Bible. And he says an introduction the God was using the astronomic heaven to announce the bride approach to announce the birth of the bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As the astronomic heaven announced the birth of Christ.

The bride is ready. The rapture is at the corner. Get ready, church. Don't just come to church and believe the message. You must put the message in practice. Amen. &gt;&gt; If there's anything in your life, get it right. &gt;&gt; If there's anything between your husband and your wife, settle it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm closing, pastor. If there's anything between you and your husband, what did I say? &gt;&gt; Settle it. You know, you die and you go to hell. Let's make our wrongs right. Heaven is for righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ronham said when he went to the sixth dimension heaven, he said sublime doesn't touch it. Perfection doesn't touch it. He said it takes perfect laugh &gt;&gt; to get there. There must be no hatred in your heart. Even if he disagree with you, you must love him. You must love her. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He said this was visible. He said this alignment was visible just after sunset with Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter observable to the naked eye. These are things you don't see often. &gt;&gt; You see maybe once in two or three generations, but they came so close that the naked eye could see them. Now you say Uranus and Neptune require the use of binoculars or a telescope and Saturn was more challenging to spot due to it maybe closer to the sun. Do you see that such a seven planet alignment is a rare occurrence with the next similar event not expected until 2040? We at the end time church. I'm so sorry we had to cut and butcher because of time. Shall we pray? Amazing grace, how sweet th like me. I once was lost but now I am found. The pastor now was blind. But now I see it was grace taught my heart to fear and grace fears relieve. How precious did. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believe. Every head bowed, every eye closed. If you're here this morning and you need uh prayer, a special prayer, our brother traveled from from Africa to be with us, brother Joseph, come and you desire prayer from our dear brother. I'm going to open up that opportunity for you to come forward to have hands laid upon you and we'll make that available to you. If you want to spend time in prayer at the altar and at your seat, I'm going to make that available to you. That's more important than anything else you have on your schedule is to really really take heed to the word that that you heard. So many signs, wonders that were brought to us and then right at the end if there's anything in your heart or in your life that's not right, you need to make that right. You need to get that straight before God. And so if you desire prayer, you can come forward, you can sit in your seat, but if you desire prayer, why don't you just make your way up to the front here?
