[Music] Amen. Good morning everyone. Can we all stand? We'll open up in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're thankful to be here this morning. Lord, we just want to bless and honor your name this day for all you have done for us, Father. Lord, for all you will do for us. God, you've given us an understanding, Lord, by your Holy Spirit, Lord, for the promises in the in the Bible, Lord, for this day. You've opened our eyes, Father. We're thankful for that. We're thankful that it it's light in the evening time. Father, as we listen to a small portion of this tape, we pray, Lord, that you just anointed to our ears. Help us to hear and to see what you'd have us this morning in the adult Sunday school class. Bless the children also, Lord, in their class and everything that would be said and done this day in this place. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. We'll be um listening to the future home, continuing with that of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. This will be about 20 minutes. We'll start at paragraph 484 and end at 4 521 rather. Can we sing only believe? Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. You may be seated. Brother Brennan. [Music] &gt;&gt; See, and when Moses returns back in Elijah for Revelations 11, there will still be prophets. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And over &gt;&gt; in the last city where the lamb is the light, I'll know you, brother McKenna. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll know you, my people. &gt;&gt; My jewels in the crown. When they come from the east and the west to the city when 1,500 miles square she will be sitting there &gt;&gt; in the city built for square. &gt;&gt; When he's sitting there in the holy mount where God sets upon the mount and Jesus on the throne and the golden trumpet sounds when Joseph leaves to walk down through the paradise and the children of God fall upon their knees and worship him knowing they were redeemed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Some times I grow homesick for heaven and the glory there shall behold. What a joy that will be when my savior I see in that beautiful city of gold. I'm bound for that beautiful city the Lord has prepared. Isaiah said in Isaiah 9:6, "And of his peace and of his increase there shall be no." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The government shall be upon his shoulders. His name will be called counselor, prince of peace, the mighty God, the everlasting father. And the government shall be upon his shoulders, and of his increase, of his peace there is no &gt;&gt; even the animals is there. Oh my. The bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame and the lion shall lay down by the lamb and the beast from the wild will be led by a child. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to be changed. &gt;&gt; I'll be changed for this creature that I am &gt;&gt; when that day come. from going to that city. I'm bound to that beautiful city. I feel the redeeming power in my whole heart. Now, if this isn't sold out, throw my life away. I've taught others deceitful things. But when I look down and see that the promise he made of this day and see it vindicated and look at this, 1500 mile square congregation said, "You're an elect. It's been called from denominations and races and creeds and things. gathered together. As I see the word vindicating itself, I know beyond one shadow of doubt, &gt;&gt; the jewels of my crown will outshine everything in the world at that day. There will come a time, people, we're not gathering here for in vain. We're only waiting for that time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is very very late but Jesus is still very very near &gt;&gt; and his glory is wonderful. His name shall be called counselor. That city can you see it? &gt;&gt; There's where the bride and the groom will settle and never again. Now, if you think it's wonderful when we drive hundreds of miles to set your and feet on his word, which this is only a shadow, what will it be when we live in the city with him? &gt;&gt; When I live next door neighbor to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when we eat of those trees and we will walk in those streets, when we walk up those streets of gold to the fountain, &gt;&gt; drink from the fountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Walk into the paradises of God with angels hovering the earth singing the anthems. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a day that will be. &gt;&gt; It's worth all. &gt;&gt; The road seems rugged. Sometimes it gets hard, &gt;&gt; but oh, it'll be so little when I see him. &gt;&gt; So little. What were the bad names and things that they've said? What will that be when I see him in that beautiful, beautiful city of God? Let's bow our head. I'm bound for that beautiful city my Lord has prepared for his own where all the redeemed of all ages sang glory around the white throne. Sometimes I go home sick for heaven and it glories I there shall behold. What a joy that will be when my savior I see in that beautiful city of gold on the island of Patmas John so [Music] Dear Jesus, this hope, my hope's built on nothing less. Lord, let the mother of my heart, that city, the great king, God, don't let one here perish, please. May we examine our lives again today, Lord, waiting for the coming of the Lord where all them redeemed. How yonder in that great coliseum in Rome where them Christians has eat up the lines. Shall the dust break forth someday? There will be no graveyards on the hillside of glory. No door knobs will hold a funeral wreath. No tear will spot upon it. No, no. No heat up sod, no storms will strike it. It'll all be glorious there. Help us, Lord. If there's one here that's called to this wedding supper of the lamb, this thousand years of millennium reign, and to then enter into the city after the honeymoon is over. The millennium is merely the honeymoon. Then she the bride takes his bridegroom takes his bride home. It's hers her bridegroom his bride. Oh, he's gone to prepare a house since she's become engaged. May we be true to him who is the word for he is the word. Regardless of how others try to sass us, keep us away from it. Lord, draw me nearer. For some times I grow home sing forever and it's glor shall behold. What a joy that will be when my Savior I see in that beautiful city of gold, the future home of the groom and bride. He's coming back to the wedding supper. It's going to be three and a half days. They return again in the millennium on her honeymoon. And then he's going to bring the city into view like the bridegroom taking the bride to her surprise. How the little bride stands there in awe as she looks at her future home. And by faith today, Lord, we see it yonder. It'll be right here on this earth. You promise it. Your church will be completely redeemed one of these days and then your world will be redeemed. The rest of the particles, but first you have redeemed your people, their bodies that's made up of the world. Help us, God. If there's one here who isn't just exactly sure of that, Lord, may they receive it just now. I know it's been long and hot, but people, we won't always be standing here. I won't always be your pastor. Let's make it sure. Is there a way, brother Brandham? Yes. Become a part of the word. A part of the word of today. Can't be a part of the word of Moses day. That part's done made up. That was the feet. We're at the head now. This is Christ. Not the arms time back in Luther. No, this is the head time. Christ the head stone comes to the body. If you're not, just feel exactly right about it. Wherever you can, will you raise up your hand just so I can see you? Let everybody else keep your hands down. God bless you. Say, remember me in prayer, Brother Brandham. I want to be there so bad. I I don't want to miss it, brother. I I'm checking. I'm doing everything I can to pray for me now, will you? God bless you. While you're thinking of it now, just pray. Say, "God, it's in your own heart." See, if you feel something tug tingling at your heart, that's what it is. It's that attribute trying to declare itself. I am bound for that beautiful city my Lord has prepared for his own where all the redeemed of all ages will sing glory around the white throne. Sometimes I grow homesick for heaven and the glories are there shall be. Oh, [Music] what a joy that will be. When my Savior I see in that beautiful city of gold, heavenly father, take us now, Lord, let the great shepherd, the great redeeming shepherd, the great shepherd who left glory knowing that some of the attributes was lost on some great valleys of sin or the wolves and the the animals would soon devour that little sheep. But he left the golden quarters came down into the earth and has made one of us so he could declare the love of God to us. There he found them. Some of them in denominations, some of them in the house of ill fame, some of them on the streets blind, some of them in the hedges and highways. But he redeemed everyone that the father had ordained him to redeem. And he commissioned us that we would live this part of the word for our ages. And we see the great reformation of Luther in that age and of Wesley and the Pentecostal. Now we're looking for the headstone of the city. Oh God, we know the age and the promise that we are given for this day. How that this is to be restored again. The evening light shall ripen the fruit of it. And it shall come to pass that there will be a day that cannot be day or night can be called, but in the evening time it shall be light. That same glorious son of God manifested himself in human flesh up here on the earth, making the promise live itself exactly, blinded to the eyes of the Pharisees and Sadducees and Herodians and so forth. And today it repeats again. The word being manifest just like it was. The word knowing the secret of the heart just exactly the way it was as the scripture said which cannot be broken. Help us God to realize it. Help these now who raise their hands. May they buckle up a little tighter. Shod themselves with the gospel of peace. Put on the full armor of God. Pull the helmet down. Take the shield of faith. march forward from the day on. Granted, Lord, just a little while we'll be summoned. Then the rapture will come. Just a little bitty group like Enoch will be taken up. Then the remnant of the woman's seed that keep the commandments of God, Jews, have the testimony of Jesus Christ, Gentiles will be hunted down like dogs and shall give their life for their testimony. Then one great morning the break of the millennium for the the honeymoon will start and then the rest of the dead live not for the end of the thousand years. Then at the end of the thousand years there was a judgment showing that Hamoth in the ark and Ham is still there in the remnant. Ones that heard it and rejected it will have to be judged. Now grant it, Lord, that we'll not be considered among them, but will be in the call to the wedding supper. For we do recognize Jesus among us today. We're going in with him, out of the world into him. Let us walk forth in that city. Come out with him. Getting old Lord, I ain't got many more sermons to preach. I'm certainly trusting you. I'm looking for that city like my father Abraham did. Is something in me tells it's coming. &gt;&gt; I'm trying everywhere, Lord, to spread the light. Call them. Let not one of these, Lord. How beautifully a while ago you revealed that to me from the circumference of about 1500 miles, just one here and there, are set together today. They're gathered into one little spot. waiting for that city to appear. We profess that we're pilgrims and strangers. We're outcasts. The heathen the world laughs and makes fun. The religious denominations ridicue. But we are not moved by such things. Make us part of the word, Lord. Unmovable. It shall come to pass in the last days. May it be us, Lord. May we be a considerate among them. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; Let's raise our hands like this. I'm bound for that beautiful city. My Lord has prepared for his own where all the redeemed of all ages will sing glories [Music] are there shall be. Oh, what a joy that will be when my Savior I see [Applause] [Music] in that beautiful city of gold. &gt;&gt; Now, if we're to dwell in that city together, just shake hands with somebody. Say, "God bless you, pilgrim. Where are you from? Louisiana, Georgia, Mississippi? I'm a pilgrim, too. I'm looking for that city. [Music] and his glories are there shall behold. What a joy that will be. Oh, and might I say here I see in that city of all the bear will be j and w will be t and the li shall lay down following. [Music] Oh yeah. And the be will be led by a child and I'll be changed. Changed from this creature that I am. Oh. Oh. There will be peace. in the valley for me. &gt;&gt; Oh, there will be peace in the valley for me. There, no more sad, no more tr I'll see. And there will be peace in the valley. [Music] &gt;&gt; Our invisible king this morning will be made manifest. &gt;&gt; I won't look up on Bill D at 90 years old. &gt;&gt; You won't look up on me at 50. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But I'll be changed that day. &gt;&gt; And by the beast from the wild will be led my child. But I'll be changed. Changed from this creature that I won't you be glad. &gt;&gt; Three hairs will be gone the stoop shoulders. But beauty immortal will stand in its likeness. The sun thou shine. [Music] Wonderful for me. Oh Lord, I pray there will be no sadness, no more sorrow, no more trouble. I see. And there will be peace in the valley. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're here for.

Our precious sister Lori that was raised from the dead and still a little bit to go. We've been holding her up. So just love each one. for our Sunday school this morning. We have 12 children in Sunday school, 10 Bibles, $15 in the offering. As we approach the Lord in prayer this morning, we've got some we'd like to mention. Brother Jonathan isn't feeling well, but he's well enough to be in church. So, so good to see you, my brother, here on the front row. Brother Jim Alexander is in the hospital, the deacon at Lmark, and that's kind of serious this morning. So, we want to hold up brother Jim Alexander and the battle he's been fighting for his health needs. Our sister Abigail Boyd is not feeling well this morning. Want to hold her up. And certainly the Wartz family. We don't have to remember brother Bobby anymore. He's in a much better condition, a better place. But we certainly want to hold up sister Jennifer, brother Michael, sister Barb, the family, brother Chuck and his uh travels headed there to Minnesota. So let's hold them up. If you got a desire on your heart, let's go to the prayer answering God, the awesome deliver powerful savior that we worship this morning. Dear God, so thankful to be in church many places we could be, but Lord, with the precious saints, and you said you'd meet with us, Lord, a most important guest of honor. We just lift up your name, Lord, and these praises that we have, the the language we we don't have the complete language of the words, but this from our heart, we pray that be a sacrifice, Lord, acceptable and pleasing in your sight. We'll bring tithes and honor tithes and offerings, Lord, in honor of your name, knowing that you own all things, Lord, but we're thankful to bring a portion, Lord, to to just help further the kingdom. We're so grateful for each one. And we know we're going to hear from heaven this morning, Lord. You said just two or three it would take to gather in your name and you'd walk the aisles, Lord. You'd speak to each heart and each life. And so, we claim that this morning through our precious brother Israel, Lord, anoint his lips and our ears to hear something from heaven. We know we're going to go out either a better or the same or a little bit worse. And so we choose this morning to go out a better person as you would speak to each heart and each life, each need. Oh God, some we're missing this morning. Some are needing comfort, encouragement, and we pray that you'd be there with Sister Barb, Brother Michael Wartz, Sister Jennifer, and the family. Lord, just bring them through, Lord, as only you can. May they know our thoughts and prayers and just we would do anything we could possibly do Lord as we put the shoulder to the will and this late hour Lord knowing your coming is very soon.

That's our 10th anniversary and dedicating of this building that will be right here. We were going to have to split the location with the Assemblies of God for Saturday, but that didn't work. So, we were all going to be all the services will be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you and good to see you, Sister Lori, and each of you. So, let's stand to our feet. We'll go right to the word of the Lord this morning. St. John chapter 4, Mark chapter 4, and Revelation chapter 1. Let's bypass Mark chapter 4 for now. Let's just go to St. John chapter 4 if we could. Versus number 21. And Jesus said unto her,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father. Ye worship, you know not what. We know what we worship. For salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, &gt;&gt; when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such &gt;&gt; to worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll take this scripture over in Revelations chapter 2. Revelation chapter 1, sorry verse one, the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we'll take um those two scriptures and the title of our message this morning is the hour has come. The hour has come. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, I ask for you to help me today and help your people to receive from you. And Lord, we do what we can to present to you our little efforts, our little time of study. But Lord, it takes you, the great uh revealer of truth. Come down &gt;&gt; and minister to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Give us what we have need of. Lord, &gt;&gt; help us to see what you want us to see and to hear what you want us to hear. It's in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. The hour has come now. Jesus in the book of Revelation uses that term twice. In Revelations 22 or three times, he says it again in Revelations 22. These sayings are faithful and true. Verse 6 and 7. And the Lord God of the holy prophet sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which which must shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book. Then in verse 10, he says, "He said unto me, seal up, seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand." You know, he uses this term, this terminology, and the hearer or the reader that hears it for the first time believe that it's going to happen right now. &gt;&gt; You know, the Lord allows that understanding to remain, too. And he does this with so much truth. So much of his word he allows to be revealed in his season. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness? &gt;&gt; He has seasons. He has times that are appointed. &gt;&gt; You can't make God rush. You can't make God do anything. &gt;&gt; And when when he wants to show you, he'll show you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; I took a little message here, I think on Wednesday and the other night there in Phoenix on the the baptism of John. Jesus asked those Pharisees. He said, "The baptism of John, was it from heaven or was it from men?" And they were afraid to answer because all the people knew that John was the prophet. The scripture says the publicans came to be baptized of him. The soldiers asked him, "What what what must we do?" The people, the Bible says, "All of Judea came out to hear John." And Jesus asked the question, "The baptism of John, was it of men or was it of heaven?" Obviously, we know it was of heaven, &gt;&gt; right? And many people got baptized. But knowing God knowing that that baptism would be changed, &gt;&gt; Acts 19 Paul runs into these believers that were caught under John's ministry and he begins to talk to them about the Holy Ghost and we don't even know that there even be a Holy Ghost. And Paul asked this question, how was you baptized? &gt;&gt; If baptism doesn't make a difference, then you have to take that scripture out. It does make a difference how you're baptized. And here the Lord put all this emphasis and all of this great tremendous revelation in the ministry of John the Baptist. Isaiah spoke of him. Malachi spoke of him. He lands on the banks of Jordan looking like a wild man. &gt;&gt; Brother Bannam says he probably didn't take a bath for a week or weeks. He described him as his hair sticking straight up. He's dressed in some camel skin, eating locust and honey. &gt;&gt; Why the Bible give us these details? &gt;&gt; Show you what kind of man this was. He shows up, jumps into the water, screaming to the people to repent, &gt;&gt; calling on them to to lay down their traditions and their sins and repent and get baptized. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord put all this industry uh uh energy into this ministry knowing that it would change nor that it would turn. &gt;&gt; He does that. He allows for the seasons. He's the one who instituted the seasons. &gt;&gt; You can't plant and reap at the same time. &gt;&gt; There's a planting time. There's a growing time. There's a maturing time. Then there's a reaping time. What time are we in? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the question. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? &gt;&gt; And all this history, all this time for nothing. &gt;&gt; Or is something about to take place? &gt;&gt; You know, I'm so glad. I'm so glad. I'm so glad that we know the day that we live in &gt;&gt; and we know that the hour that we're living in. We're not looking for no great revival to sweep all the churches and everybody get together in a happy kumbaya and then this nation turns around and repents and gets back to the old fashioned. It's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; We are looking for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We are looking for a body change. &gt;&gt; We are looking for &gt;&gt; the maturing &gt;&gt; of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; That's the time we're in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this is the language that the Lord uses. Look at this. What the prophet of God says in the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960 paragraph 113. He says, "What time is at hand? The time these things take place when this revelation of Jesus Christ is completed in each church age." Now the reason he wrote it like this if he would have said well now they was looking for him to if he had if it had been revealed if he would have if it would have been revealed to John that he was going to come as soon as those churches they there was finished that's the way John thought it but it was but if it was them churches as soon as they is finished. They come. If he knew, if it had been revealed to him there is going to be seven long church ages, several thousand years, several hundred years, then there wouldn't be no reason of waiting. They just live their church age out. Therefore, God spoke it and it wasn't revealed to them. It wasn't revealed to Martin Luther. things that John Wesley knew about the scripture. It wasn't revealed to the Baptist what the Pentecostal knows about the scripture because it's in a different age. It's a different time and God reveals his things just in the season. &gt;&gt; So, he's got a season to reveal these things. &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible you have today is not the same Bible you had 10 years ago. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you change. The word don't change, &gt;&gt; but when you read it, it changes you. It has a different effect upon you. &gt;&gt; A teenager reading the scripture than a man that has children reading the scripture. &gt;&gt; Same boy, same name, but he's matured now. And you pick up that word, it's going to have a different effect upon you. &gt;&gt; There's a season and time for it. &gt;&gt; And some things you won't understand until you have children. You got all the answers before you have any. &gt;&gt; You know all about it before you got a wife or a husband. &gt;&gt; But you don't. There's some things you just don't know. And we can't tell you. And there's no book that can show you. You got to get married. &gt;&gt; You got to have them babies and then come talk to me &gt;&gt; about family matters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. things are revealed in their time. God has seasons. &gt;&gt; He has times that he unfolds things. And here he knew John was thinking. He knew the church was believing. The time is at hand. The time is at hand. The time I'm coming quickly. I'm coming. If he would have told them there's thousands of years, six more ages. There's a dark age and there's ages yet to come. Hundreds of years need to develop. If he would have told them that, &gt;&gt; it probably would have discouraged them. &gt;&gt; They probably wouldn't make it on a Wednesday night prayer meeting. &gt;&gt; Come on and help me preach. &gt;&gt; They probably wouldn't make all the services if they knew. But we know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we make all the services. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. The time is at hand. These truths have to be revealed. You know, the Lord in the Old Testament, there was a order to getting to the holy place. There's the outer court, the inner court, and the holiest of holies. Remember in first kings chapter 17 we were talking about Elijah and how the threat of Jezebel came upon him and he had to run for his life and then he called for the famine. And we know the story that the Lord told him to go to this brook and I will feed thee there. &gt;&gt; Not here over there. It was a It was a special place. It was a place where he was supposed to eat this food. And we know that the food in our day has been hidden from the world. But for the believer, it's spiritual food in due season. &gt;&gt; It's hidden mana. &gt;&gt; Whether you believe it or not, this is why you are alive today. It's because of the food that you're eating. &gt;&gt; It's not because we're better. It's not because we know more than the rest just out of the earthly knowledge, but it's because of the revelation that God has given to us. &gt;&gt; He has revealed himself to us, &gt;&gt; and that's why we do the way we do. &gt;&gt; We go in the way that we go. So he had Elijah travel this distance to um to get the food that he had prepared for him. Are you willing to travel? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to wait? Are you willing to go deep in prayer &gt;&gt; to get into the spirit of revelation? &gt;&gt; Your Bible reads differently &gt;&gt; when you accompany it with a prayer life. The church service, the worship meeting is different &gt;&gt; when you accompany it with prayer. &gt;&gt; Your experience today is different if you come with your heart prayed up. &gt;&gt; It's the same word. Yes. It's the same message. Yes. But when you get to the place where you're supposed to be and then you hear the same word, &gt;&gt; it has an effect upon you. There's a place to eat the word. &gt;&gt; There's an atmosphere that we're supposed to eat the word. &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't saying amen. But it's all right. &gt;&gt; There's a right place to eat this. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; How many of us eat our meals on the go? Like I said, &gt;&gt; in your truck eating dinner, driving through traffic. You'll enjoy that meal if you pull over with the family somewhere. and eat it properly. &gt;&gt; And the way we eat the food of God, there's an atmosphere. There's a place. There's a special place that he designed. The outer court, the inner court, and then the holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be this morning. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to partake this morning is in the holies of holies. So, there's an order to reaching that place. It's a distance that we travel. &gt;&gt; There's a season that God allows for things to be revealed and to be uncovered. As we know, the messenger tells us there's this Revelation chapter 1 and and verse number three says, "Blessed is he that readeth and hear the word of this prophecy and keep those things for the time is at hand." This is the language of the Holy Spirit speaking to John. This kept the expectations up, kept it very high for him, knowing not knowing what the future would hold for him. Not knowing that there would be hours and ages and lives that would have to be sacrificed and given. This is John. John and the early apostles knew if they would have known that there was these long ages to come, they wouldn't have really that anticipation &gt;&gt; to wait for. &gt;&gt; What if he told you everything &gt;&gt; all in one sitting? &gt;&gt; Well, you wouldn't come back for more. &gt;&gt; He does that for us, too. He doesn't reveal everything to you at the time you want it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I need a wife right now. Lord, I need a husband right now. I know some of y'all ain't saying that, but somebody does say that. &gt;&gt; I need a husband. I need a wife. And you think this is the time that you need that, but don't you want God's timing? &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; He knows the right time. &gt;&gt; He knows the right season. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So is the seed of the word of God planted in our heart. &gt;&gt; The word of God has been planted in our heart. We hear it for the first time sometimes and you got to hear it again though. &gt;&gt; And then that word has to mature &gt;&gt; and it has to begin to grow &gt;&gt; and it has to become believable to you. &gt;&gt; It gets to where you hear it and you hear it again and then you you can almost repeat it and then you memorize it. &gt;&gt; What is the word? It's taking effect upon you. Let it do its job. It's not a onetime hearing &gt;&gt; or a one-time event. He is trying to fulfill his word in you. &gt;&gt; You know, these scriptures and the unfolding of the scriptures help us to realize that there's ages, seasons, and times for things to take place. God does it that way. He allows us to continue on sometimes maybe in a little ignorance and he doesn't show us all that we need to know just yet. &gt;&gt; But in his time he's going to reveal it to you. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Every seed, every predestinated seed has a season. &gt;&gt; And every season has its manifestation to be expressed. And it's God's great unfolding. He's unfolding it in your life, in my life. Ecclesiastics says it. The book of Ecclesiastes says it very well. There is a time and a season for everything under the sun. &gt;&gt; It's a time that we gather and it's a time that we scatter. It's a time that we live, a time to die, a time to build, a time to tear down. There's a time to to refrain from speaking. Stop talking so much. And there's a time to do some listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a season for it. There is a time that you need to speak up. &gt;&gt; And make it known what side you're on. &gt;&gt; You've got to declare that. &gt;&gt; You got to say, "I'm on the Lord's side." You've got to declare I am healed by his stripes. You've got to declare that he is my savior. &gt;&gt; That he is the one who who brought me through. He is my redeemer. &gt;&gt; That's what the song service is all about. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's not the melody. It's not rhyming. It's declaring &gt;&gt; the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Making that word become your word. The Lord is my shepherd. &gt;&gt; I shall not want. &gt;&gt; The Lord makes me to lie down in green pastures. &gt;&gt; You got to declare that &gt;&gt; time to speak, a time to refrain from speaking. &gt;&gt; You know, the entire church is built upon spiritual revelation. &gt;&gt; This is why Satan hates it so much. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's not built on education or knowledge, which that's part of it. It's not built on your ability to read, which that's part of it, too. It's not built on just the outward portion of coming to church or looking at others that are worshiping the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's built upon something much deeper than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I can tell you how to dress and you might ask the other brothers what we do and what we don't do. And that's all on the on your on your hearing. And that's part of it. That's part of the teaching. That's the outside part of it. We could talk to you those things. But when these things become a revelation to you, when you begin to see that it's Jesus Christ speaking to you, then it goes beyond the brother in the pull pit &gt;&gt; or the strong leader or it goes beyond the Sunday school teacher &gt;&gt; or the visiting pastor. When it's a revelation, a relationship between you and the Lord Jesus Christ becomes very intimate, very personal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord allows for these times of growth and growing. What we want to see, what we like to see is some growth in our revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're deeper than what we used to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is what the word does. &gt;&gt; This is expressed in 1 Samuel when David went through his test and trials. I have the quote here. I won't take time to get it, but he, Brother Brandham, brings an order to David's trials. And he said the first order was the bear and then the lion. You read the scripture there, David puts them both together. He says the lion and the bear. The prophet brings it out. He said, "I wish I had time to break those animals down for you." And he said, "The bear is was a big animal and David overcame that animal. It was a trial to him and he had a victory. It's a big victory. Big grizzly bear. And then when he come to the lion, the lion was much bigger than the bear. And he overcame that lion. First he started with the bear. Then he overcame the lion. And then a greater challenge, a greater victory. And then his greatest victory and his greatest challenge as a young boy, a non-commissioned soldier. No other army recognized him. Dad and brothers didn't know who he was. &gt;&gt; But the Lord &gt;&gt; knew who he was. when he's writing those psalms, the Lord is my shepherd. Those aren't just words, my brother. That's inspiration. &gt;&gt; The book of Acts calls David a prophet. He got in the spirit of prophecy out there in the wilderness looking after a few dozen sheep. The Lord looking at him, watching him. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He's riding under inspiration. And here he was, the bear, the lion, and then Goliath. His biggest challenge yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he allows this revelation to grow for us. So, but there's a danger. When we don't move forward in the revelation, then the light that we have received turns into darkness. &gt;&gt; It goes the opposite way. So what happens to a truth when you reject it or you ignore it? What happens to the truth that spoken to all the multitudes of people? When they turned away from Jesus in St. John chapter 6, remember those words he was speaking? They said, "This is a hard saying," and they walked away. Do you think they just went and lived an ordinary life? the rich young ruler. What do you think happened to him after he came in contact with the Lord Jesus and the opportunity for him to come and follow him? Sell all you have and follow me and he rejected that. What church is he going to go to after that? What priest? What kind of worship service is he going to try to be a part of? &gt;&gt; So what happens to truth to a believer? When you receive truth, he gives you more truth. It doesn't stay the same. It grows. &gt;&gt; Your revelation grows. &gt;&gt; And what happens to truth when it's rejected? It turns to darkness. And my friend, sad to say, I'm seeing that happen even today. Even in many of the assemblies that we've been friends with and been familiar with, ministries, pastors, 40-year, 50-year ministries are turning away from the light of this age. &gt;&gt; And they've boldly declared that they are now free now. The sisters, they'll leave and they're free. They've walked away from the truth. And what little bitty truth that they had now turns to darkness. You know what I'm seeing more now? They just don't walk away quietly. &gt;&gt; They walk away and they come back fighting against it now. &gt;&gt; The thing that they once upheld the thing that once delivered them, &gt;&gt; they studied for years and used it in their camp meetings to help others. prayer lines, laid hands on the sick, baptized people in the name of the Lord Jesus to help bring them along. And now they've turned from the holy commandment, and now the truth that they once had is now turned to darkness. Jesus talks about this in Mark chapter 4. We'll turn there quickly. This is the part of the service where you will probably stop saying amen. &gt;&gt; But it will be the word though. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Spirit, let it say amen through you. Okay? You know I'm teasing. I know all the believers, we all believers in here, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 4 verse 22. It's a parable of our Lord Jesus. He's giving us here. And let me turn there. Mark chapter 4 verse 21. Look at what he says. And he said unto them, "Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick? For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested." Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither was anything kept secret, but that it should come abroad. &gt;&gt; If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. &gt;&gt; Isn't that nice? &gt;&gt; Ears to hear, let him hear. Now let's take what the prophet says here a couple of places here in um the unveiling of God. He makes this statement here paragraph 22. my subject this morning. I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I hope and trust that you have had a spiritual understanding &gt;&gt; of what that God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out. See, it's a thing. Sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down. &gt;&gt; It might bring some to go out, some to leave, some to ponder over. But that's done. Say it with me. &gt;&gt; Purposely. It must be done that way. Say, "Lord, just tell me. Lord, just tell me plainly. Just tell me plainly." No, he doesn't do it that way. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He reserved things. He saith things in a certain way. &gt;&gt; See, you're not gonna get in here without a prayer life. &gt;&gt; You're not gonna get a revelation without a struggle. &gt;&gt; There's some things that you hear for the first time and I tell you what, you can't say amen &gt;&gt; cuz it's too hard. &gt;&gt; It's a ch something I never heard before. Like, whoa, whoa, whoa. I remember when I came to the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His brother gave me a bag of tapes. I was working in a hospital there in Sacramento, California. Brother Fred Faso gave me a bag of tapes and I was listening to those tapes and I was just eating it up one after. Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Glenn, I was just it was all good. And I was sitting in my car had a little cutless and I was had a tape player in there and brother Brandham started getting on women preachers and my mama's a preacher and I was saying, "Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And when he said that, oh, I had to stop that. I stopped the tape and I started thinking like, Israel, what are you getting into? You're just swallowing this thing all the way up like this. You don't even know. You don't even know what these people fully believe. And so I I took the I took the tape out. I got out of my car. I I went into my little apartment. I put it t the tape back in the tape recorder. I rewinded it and I played it and guess what it said? &gt;&gt; The exact same thing. &gt;&gt; But this time when it said it, I had pondered it a little bit. The grace of God was in my room &gt;&gt; and I said, "Yes, &gt;&gt; that's the truth." &gt;&gt; And then the next time I said, "Yes, even louder." And then now I can preach it &gt;&gt; as a conviction &gt;&gt; from down in my soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you can't say amen the first time all the time. It's the first time you're hearing it. &gt;&gt; But if you stay with it, &gt;&gt; give the light a chance to drop &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit by his love and tender love and mercy &gt;&gt; will accompany you as you read the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. as you hear the message and he allows it to be done that way. There's a struggle some of the things we hear. &gt;&gt; There's some things I still have on the shelf to be honest with you. You want to know what they are? No. You put stuff on your shelf, I got stuff on mine. &gt;&gt; But I know that all of this message is true. &gt;&gt; But I'm still wrestling through some things. I'm still challenged by some things. And that's where prayer and a relationship with the author of the book comes in. &gt;&gt; In his love and tender mercy and in his time, in his season, he will reveal it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; He instituted seasons. He's the one who instituted seasons. Is that right? Now, he can he can speed them up. He can slow them down like with the fig tree. He's sped up. Remember that? And the and the the the olive branch in the holiest of holy. They took that branch of Moses and Aaron's rod and put it in the holiest of holies. And in 24 hours, it blossomed and brought forth almonds. He sped up the process, but there's still a process. And he's the one that's in control of the season. He instituted seasons. Every service can't be a happy happy happy service. &gt;&gt; Now, it's joyful all the way through, &gt;&gt; but some services tears have to come out of your eyes. &gt;&gt; Some services you got to be on your knees. &gt;&gt; Some tapes will press you. Some will lift you. But it's all of God's word. &gt;&gt; And he's got a time and season. Families go through these times. Goes through these seasons. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Then it might be that some would say, "You mean God would purposely do a thing like that?" He certainly did. He does. Yet. He said, "Except you eat of the flesh of the son of God or the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you." What kind of statement do you think that a medical doctor or nurse or any fine intellectual person would think of a statement like that? You know how we do, don't we? We like to sanitize the gospel a little bit. &gt;&gt; Like, you know, Lord, you know, say it, but don't say it like that, Lord. Don't say it with my I've got some friends coming to church. Don't No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jesus said it, knew they were struggling with it, and he said it anyway &gt;&gt; on purpose. &gt;&gt; There's places like that in the word for all of us. &gt;&gt; Every the newcomer has to deal with it. I have to deal with it. You know, the newcomer comes to church, it's always those crazy saints that want to get a hold of them and bring them the craziness first and all the the, you know, the real crazy stuff. And you just you just want say, "No, don't let sister get a hold of her. Keep her away from brother cuz they crazy." But God allows that. God allows &gt;&gt; someone to pin you up in the corner &gt;&gt; and start dropping things on you. &gt;&gt; And then you got to go develop a prayer life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to fall down on your knees. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, what does this mean? What is going on in my life? Please reveal it to me." &gt;&gt; He's got a season for it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe he's interested in us knowing exactly what we need to know when we need to know it. &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness, somebody? &gt;&gt; Or is God running late? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Is God not on time? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on. Yes, &gt;&gt; he's got it all under control. &gt;&gt; I think the brother said that this morning. &gt;&gt; Give me that reassurance. &gt;&gt; Placed it down in my soul. &gt;&gt; That God's got it all under control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he allows for that to take place that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here what the prophet of God says about this light turning into darkness and the power of God. 1955 he says this here the same Holy Ghost in power that resurrected Jesus Christ that's in the building tonight blinds the eyes of the modern day preacher and his church and that's the things thing that's blinded them has give light hallelujah since the resurrection of Jesus in the day of Pentecost God will do it can you expl explain it. But if you don't accept light, it'll become darkness to you. You'll criticize it, call it a holy roller, or you might as well have a millstone hanged at your neck and drowned to the depths of the sea. You blasphe the Holy Ghost, there's not forgiveness. Prophet God continues in questions and answers, 1954, and he says this here. It's talking about water water baptism. Paragraph 258. So now you say, "Brother Vandom, I was baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I don't doubt your word. I have no reason at all to doubt your word. I believe it. I believe God gave them the Holy Ghost up there before they was baptized at all. But when Peter told them what to do, they went and done it." That's right. Now you know what to do. That's right. And if you refuse to walk in light when light is brought forth, you turn to darkness. Right. Amen. All right. Excuse me. I don't want to excuse me for hollering. So be it. To God's word. No, sir. I'll holler. Amen. Again. That's right. Yes, sir. Why baptize in the name of Jesus Christ, Brother Brandham? Why do you do that instead of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? Because the Bible teaches that that clear. Why do you wash feet, brother Bannon? Because the Bible teaches that. I believe in the full gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A amen. &gt;&gt; We see that happen with Cain, don't we? &gt;&gt; He had an hour and time in his life where he actually had a relationship with the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was given the opportunity to worship, &gt;&gt; to build his altar, to do all what he felt in his heart by his understanding how to approach God. And he did that &gt;&gt; and the Lord shook his head at it and says, "No, that's not the way I'm going to receive. Do what your brother did." You know, and Cain, if he would have just humbled himself &gt;&gt; and corrected his error, he would have been moving on with the Lord. &gt;&gt; And that's like a a lot of us today. &gt;&gt; If we'll just humble ourselves and go on with the word that God has given us, he'll continue to bless you. But if you ex uh uh uh make excuses for truth or deny it or try to explain it away, then what can the Lord do more for you? He's tried to open up that channel to give you more. You're at the outer court. He's trying to bring you to the holy place. You're at the inner court. He's trying to bring you to the holiest of holies. He's trying to bring you through those stages, through those phases so that he can give you more light. And the light that he's been given to us in this day, in this generation, it's a beautiful light. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful light. &gt;&gt; And though many may turn away from it, we are growing deeper in it. &gt;&gt; They thought we was crazy five years ago. They going to really know how crazy we are today. &gt;&gt; And in 10 more years, if I continue in this level of craziness, oh God, help me. I want to lose my mind &gt;&gt; for the things of the word &gt;&gt; and deny the things of the world &gt;&gt; and right on in to the coming of the Lord in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Crazy till my body is changed. crazy until I'm raptured up out of here. &gt;&gt; This is the trajectory that the believer is on. &gt;&gt; We're not holding back. We're going deeper. &gt;&gt; We're not refraining from it. We're going deeper into it. &gt;&gt; They have removed the candlestick. They've removed the light out of the assemblies. &gt;&gt; They don't want to mention where they got the truth from. They want to mention that Jesus did it. and they don't want to say the name of the prophet that God used in this generation. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you right now, I'm not ashamed of it. &gt;&gt; This message saved my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message, the revelation of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; is the reason I'm alive today. &gt;&gt; And I know that and I recognize that to be the truth. He that has an ear, let him hear. Now the prophet continues and says this here that God he allowed it to be done that way. He makes statements and he allows those statements to be made um uh purposely. Now he continues in the inve 295 it says this. think the mysteries of God made known to us in this day by the same heavenly messenger that was made known to them in them days. Notice the same pillar of fire that sent Moses. The same pillar of fire that was on Moses that wrote the Bible. The same pillar of fire that Paul met on his road down to Damascus and Paul wrote the New Testament. Remember Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? They only wrote what they seen. But Paul had the revelation. &gt;&gt; He pulled it out. He had he had met the pillar of fire himself. Think uh the same paragraph 299. And think of it, the same pillar of fire that come upon those men that wrote the Bible. It's the same pillar of fire here today interpreting the Bible. Amen. how we thank him for that. &gt;&gt; It's not a different pillar of fire. It's the same pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same pillar of fire that wrote the Bible told Moses to take off his shoes. The same pillar of fire we have a picture of today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Washington DC. It's there too in their hall there. You go there, you get a little tag and they'll show you right where that picture is. You go and see that this is authenticated. Now the world in its education has made it null and void. &gt;&gt; The world in its education has be to disprove the messenger. What do they do it by? Intellectuals. &gt;&gt; They do it by proof or evidence. They do it by fake news. They do it by going on the internet or going historically and finding and finding and finding finding. Well, let me tell you something, saints. The um the um the historical records of any account didn't save me. &gt;&gt; It was a supernatural something that took place &gt;&gt; that saved me. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, when the Lord got a hold of my heart and my soul, I didn't have to go pick up and and research to make sure that it was vindicated, authenticated. &gt;&gt; No, God got a hold of me &gt;&gt; and he revealed to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, revelation is more than just an education. &gt;&gt; Revelation is more than just information. Revelation is um the the Greek word apocalypse. It means to be uncovered or to be revealed. Something has been revealed or uncovered. &gt;&gt; It is it is the um to make known through divine inspiration to make something secret or hidden publicly. It's a mystery. It's a the mystery of a religious truth that one can know by revelation and cannot fully understand. It's like I know who my mother is and my daddy is. I can't I don't have to write an essay on it. I don't need to prove it to nobody else. &gt;&gt; I know who my mom and dad is. It's a it's it goes beyond just education or arguing or take taking some place online to to show who is right or wrong. We're not trying to prove who's right or wrong in an argument. It's the revelation of Jesus Christ that a young person, an old person, a person that could read, a person that cannot read, God gives it to them by his grace and his mercy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't work for you. didn't pay for it. You didn't jump loud enough. You didn't jump high enough. You can't run fast enough. There's no money that can buy it. There is nothing you can do &gt;&gt; to let his but his grace comes to you. &gt;&gt; And when his grace comes to you, he reveals &gt;&gt; himself to you. &gt;&gt; So this is what has taken place. Now what God does is this. He declares, "He that has an ear, let him hear." In Mark 4:22, verse 24 says, "Take heed what ye hear." Now, let's go back there just for a moment. Mark 4:22 24. Then he said unto them, "Take heed what you hear. With what measure ye meet, it shall be measured to you, and unto you that here shall what?" &gt;&gt; Come on. That here shall &gt;&gt; more be given. For he that hath to him shall be given. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he that hath not from him shall be what? &gt;&gt; This is what we see taking place today. This is what's taking place. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I'm seeing this. I never placed it before in the scripture, but here just recently I begin to see this looking up the removing of a candlestick. And when the messenger, faithful messenger is taken off the scene, there's a lot of things come up. People personal testimonies proving this, proving that. when he was here, no man stood before him. &gt;&gt; But you know, but when you remove a candlestick, you remove a faithful leader, you remove an elder from a home, you remove the truth teller, you remove the standardbearer, you remove that original business owner, &gt;&gt; and then it starts everybody start doing their own thing. Like the book of Judges, all of Israel served the Lord and all the elders that were with Joshua served the Lord until Joshua left. &gt;&gt; And when the elders left, what the people do? This pattern, we see it happen over and over again. It happens in groups. It happens in small groups. It happens in individuals. You as an individual, if you take the light of this ministry out of your personal devotion time, you will see a effect of it on you spiritually because God sent to you a voice to keep you fed up during this great time of darkness and the great time of a famine. We are in a famine. Not only a famine, we're in a time of gross darkness. &gt;&gt; It is darkness upon the people. &gt;&gt; And if you come up under that anointing of darkness, you'll get under it and you'll start questioning and you'll start, you know, reasoning and you'll start disbelieving. But when you stay in the food, you stay in the place &gt;&gt; where God told you to stay, &gt;&gt; he'll provide food for you. This is what's taking place. &gt;&gt; The time is at hand. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. When you receive truth, you get more truth. So, everybody comes with something. Every human being comes here with something. &gt;&gt; They start off with their conscience. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They have they know the difference between right and wrong. Is that right? &gt;&gt; They do. Yes. Jesus says it right here. He says, "And for he that hath to him shall be given, and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath." So, let's turn into Romans here quickly. And let me see if I can just deal with this just really quick because this is a growing uh revelation of people that call themselves atheists or agnostics. That's what they say. &gt;&gt; But we know the Bible tells us differently. Right. &gt;&gt; They really do believe because their conscience bears witness of it. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; All right. Let me see if I can get it here for you. How many has it there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans chapter one. &gt;&gt; Two people have it. &gt;&gt; Three people, four or five. &gt;&gt; Can everybody say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, most of you said amen. We can be a little rough here in Tucson. Need the Holy Spirit. We need some more rain. &gt;&gt; Oh my God bless you. Romans chapter 1. I want to take this scripture for you here. And I'm going to close right with this one. All right. And it says verse 16, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ, for is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God." &gt;&gt; What is it? revealed from faith to faith as it is written, the just shall live by faith. For it is written, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who do what? &gt;&gt; Hold the truth. &gt;&gt; Who hold the truth. That word hold there, it's um I forget the Greek word. I could find it for you quickly, but it means to suppress. &gt;&gt; So they suppress the truth. And look what the scripture says. Hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them. For God hath what? &gt;&gt; He showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being understood by the things that are made even as eternal power in Godhead. So that they are what are they? &gt;&gt; Without excuse. &gt;&gt; They're without excuse. &gt;&gt; They're without excuse. God has revealed it to them. He's made it known to them, but they suppress the truth and they try to act like they don't believe the truth. Remember when Jesus made his triumphal entry and those saints and begin to praise him and call son of David or blessed is he the most high God. They told him, why don't you make these people be quiet? What did Jesus said? If they hold their peace, &gt;&gt; what'd he say? &gt;&gt; Somebody help me please. Yes. &gt;&gt; If they hold their peace, &gt;&gt; you don't have to say amen. &gt;&gt; The rocks will say amen. &gt;&gt; The rocks will cry out. &gt;&gt; If all the churches in this city stop preaching this word, &gt;&gt; Sabino Canyon is still preaching it. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Sunset Mountain is still preaching it. &gt;&gt; You go up in the trails up in there, some of them trees are still alive. They'll they'll cry out &gt;&gt; that a mighty prophet came in this day. &gt;&gt; The rocks would immediately cry out and these people, they suppress the truth. They walk away. They turn away. You got to step over Calvary to find yourself in hell. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have to step over the love of God to turn around and say that God doesn't care or love me. &gt;&gt; You have to step over his goodness, his mercy. &gt;&gt; The sunrise, &gt;&gt; preaches that there is a God. The mountains are crying out that there is a God. The rainbow, all of nature, the solar system, &gt;&gt; the way your body works is crying out &gt;&gt; that there is a God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The preacher don't even have to preach. You don't even have to go to church. But just take a a walk in nature. Remember the gentleman that planted that apple tree 40 years ago. Remember, he was an atheist. &gt;&gt; He didn't know that that apple tree was going to preach to him. &gt;&gt; He didn't know he was going to get saved, not even at a church. Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't know that a prophet was going to bring a ministry and actually preach the gospel to him because his time had come. &gt;&gt; 75 years old. 40year-old apple tree &gt;&gt; laying there thinking about I'm an atheist but God in his grace and his mercy &gt;&gt; sent a man with squirrel blood all over him &gt;&gt; driving through the neighborhood wondering go shoot somebody's squirrel on somebody's property and brother Woods brings him to this atheist quote unquote and got to talking to him a preacher You're so low down banks, you got to carry a preacher with you. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother M said, "I better get out now. Come out, start talking to him." Says, "You you guys are are barking up the wrong tree. All you guys do is go after the people's money." And brother B says, "You know, well, you have your opinion. You have your opinion." &gt;&gt; He says, "Can I have one of these apples?" Says, "Sure." He says, "What do you change the subject for?" He said, "I just want you know these this apple, you know, you know who these apples that are falling, the life that's in the tree." Explain that to me how that work. Oh, that's just nature. Yes, that's nature. I agree. That's nature. It's just nature. Yes, I agree. That's nature. But who controls nature? &gt;&gt; And the old man begin to think, start to think. Revelation is near him. &gt;&gt; It's near. &gt;&gt; He ain't getting it yet, but he's near. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he starts to talk to him in love and mercy and explain to him. He says, "Before I come back, I want you to think about what intelligence is controlling nature." Then I will tell you how I knew who that woman was that received her healing from cancer. Your neighbor right around the corner here. &gt;&gt; Knew you. Yes. Knew me. Brother B says, "And right there, I led that man to Christ with an apple tree." &gt;&gt; Not chapter and voice, not quote. Another quote here, look at this. No, an apple tree. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because all of nature will testify. &gt;&gt; The rocks will cry out. &gt;&gt; The rocks are still crying out. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet of God lays that in there so beautifully. How much time I got? I got eight more minutes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, Brother Bam is dealing with uh another atheist man. And he was dealing with this man or or his former pastor, Dr. Rory Davis was dealing with this atheist about the scripture. They shall drink any deadly thing. It won't harm them. And if I can find this here quickly, sis, I want to Oh my Who said that? Oh, that's brother interpreting. Paragraph number 34 in the message, God in his word, 1957. Here what the prophet of God says here. If we can play a part of it, that would be nice. Can we load it real quick, sis? I don't know how clear this is. It just really touched me. Let's see. Yeah. Paragraph 34. I'll tell you when to stop. 1957, God is in his word. Thank you. Just one more little thought on my mind comes this an infidel not several years 60 75 years ago passed to the nation and he was making converts to infidelism and he was so smart the preachers was afraid to attack him. But one day while he'd been taking a Europe trip, he broke down and come back. He went up into the mountains to take a rest. And one day while walking out, he looked at the rocks and he said, "Oh rocks, are you there according to the book of science? Are you there according to the word of God?" And he got so under conviction that he knelt down there in the path and gave his life to God. The Bible said if they hold their peace, the rocks will immediately cry out. Something's going to teach people about God. I've watched birds and animals and can see God in his universe. We could hold that for two hours. God in his the poison. He said he couldn't take it anymore. He wouldn't let this infidel stand against God's word. And so he shook him. He took the poison. He drank every drop of it. And it was a great miracle, a great time in this man's life. And so this infidel, as you heard the quote there, he goes out into the wilderness now. And then the rocks begin to testify to him. And the rocks begin to cry out to him. You know, God has an appointed time for your struggle, for your temptation. He's got an appointed time. There is an expiration date &gt;&gt; to even this very day that we're living in. &gt;&gt; October will soon be over &gt;&gt; and then we'll go into November. And whatever you're going through right now, whatever trouble, whatever blessing, it's got a time that it has to shift, change, get deeper, grows greater, or it comes to an end. So we don't be weary in what we are doing today. &gt;&gt; And we don't hold in discouragement because things are going so bad for us. &gt;&gt; We have our hard times. Yes. We have these hard trials. Yes. But they come to an end. And that is a revelation. The believer knows that. So we hold steady, the hour will come where God will give you the victory &gt;&gt; over all of your enemies. &gt;&gt; If you take Psalms 27, I was reading that this morning and it's like I said, it's one of my favorite. We read it here many times. I memorized it as a young Christian. Lord is my light, my salvation. Whom shall I fear? Lord is the strength of my life. Whom shall I be afraid when the wicked? And I started quoting that this morning and I started to include my entire family. And if you'll just plurize that scripture, it is profound. &gt;&gt; When the wicked come against me or my family or my ministry, &gt;&gt; then the Lord will take me up. &gt;&gt; Go through there and plurize that. It'll have a nice profound um effect upon you because you and your house shall be saved. Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; The hour has come and even right now is revelation he's given to us is growing greater and greater. God bless you. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, thank you for your word today. Thank you for the hearts that are gathered here. May the great Holy Spirit give to each one what they have need of. Lord, I know that some are struggling with whatever test, whatever bear or lion or Goliath, whatever temptation they're going through. Father, I pray that you'll give them grace and truth to overcome, knowing that it will be a great victory for them. And as they receive the word, that you'll give them more word. And we know, Lord, that you have revealed yourself to all mankind. Even the one on the streets that say they don't believe, you have revealed yourself to them. And oh God, that time comes for us to be a witness to them. I pray let it come is our prayer. The hour has come that these things must be fulfilled. My hour has come. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we thank you for all your blessings. We ask you, Father, in Jesus name we pray. Amen. I can do all things through Christ. I can do all things through Christ. Through Christ that set me free. I can do I can do all things through Christ. I can do all things through Christ. [Music] I can do all things. All things, all things will rise through Christ. [Music] Brother John, I can do all through Christ. I can do all things through Christ. I can do all things through Christ. Through Christ that strengthens me. Sing that again. I can do all things through Christ. [Music] I can do all things through Christ. I can do all things through Christ. Through Christ that strengthens me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. just a moment ago when brother Israel was talking about when you be in the valley, there's an end to the valley. There's an end when we're on the mountaintop as well. But just that thought came to my mind. He's the lily of the valley. He couldn't be the lily of the valley unless we were there to enjoy him in the valley. We don't see that lily of the valley up on the top of the mountain. And just maybe we can sing that. I found a friend in Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's everything to me. &gt;&gt; Let's stand as we just tell him that. &gt;&gt; I have found a friend in Jesus. He's everything to me. He's the barest of the thousand to my soul. He is the lily of the valley. I see all I need to cleanse and make me fully. In sorrow he's my comfort. In trouble he's my strength. He tells me every care on him to roll. Hallelujah. He's the li of the valley, bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. He all my griefs has taken and all my sorrow. in temptation. He's my strong and mighty God. Oh, for him forsaken and all my idol storms from my heart. And now he keeps me by his bound. Oh all the world forsake me and Satan can't be stormed. Through Jesus, I shall safely reach the goal. &gt;&gt; He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. And he will never never leave me nor yet forsake me here. Shall I live by faith and to his blessed will? A wall of fire about me. I've got nothing out to fear. With this man, my hungry soul shall fear. And it's sweeping up to glory. We'll see his blessed face. Where rivers come, light shall ever roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fair of 10,000. I want to sing that last verse one more time. He'll never leave me. He'll never never leave me. Nor yet forsake me here. While I live by faith and to his blessed will. Oh fire about me. I'm nothing to fear. With his man he my hungry soul shall fill. And then sweeping up to glory. will see his blessed face where rivers of delight shall ever roll. Hallelujah. He's the lily of the valley, the bright and morning star. He's the fairest of 10,000 to my soul. [Music] Amen. Let's go to the key of D. Sister Sharon. Another psalm. Psalm 34. Magnify the Lord with me. I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from every fear. Those who look on him are radar. They'll never be ashamed. They'll never be ashamed.

Let us go over watching us, Lord, in the road. Thank you for everything can give and help us come back in the appointment time this afternoon. Give us a rest at home and come fresh again &gt;&gt; to the house of the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Maybe just shake hands with those around you before you go.

I still remember. I still remember [Music] the day you saved me. &gt;&gt; The day I heard you call out my name. &gt;&gt; You said you love me. You never leave me home and I'll never be the same. [Music] We still remember. Yes, I still remember. I still remember the works of your hand. [Music] Oh, I will smile [Music] and give you praise for great is my faithfulness. Just one more time.

Can we say it's been good to be in the house of the Lord today? &gt;&gt; Amen. Key of F as you go. in a manger long ago. I know it's really so. A babe was born to save men from their sin. John saw him on the shore, the lamb forever more. Oh, Christ the crucified of Calvary. Oh, how I love that man from Galilee. For he's done so very much for me. Oh, he's forgiven all my sin. Place the Holy Ghost with him. Oh, I love I love that man from Galilee. Oh, the publican went to pray in the temple there one day. He cried, "Oh Lord, be merciful to me." He was forgiven of every sin and a deep peace placed within. He said, "Come and see this man from Galilee. Oh, how I love that man from Galilee. For he's done so very much for me.
