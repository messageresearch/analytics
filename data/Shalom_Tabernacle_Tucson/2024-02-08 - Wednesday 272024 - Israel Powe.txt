said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord and so God bless each of you richly we'll have you seated just for a moment we have two pastors here with us tonight and they're here with us for the first time Pastor uh Louise um stand up brother who's Pastor Louise is that LS there's no Pastor there was brother Lewis okay but the pastor is Pastor um my brother who called me earlier today and um he he here from massachus from church from the open door right amen God bless you Stan and that was his group that thank for us come on come on up here and greet the people yeah come on that's right and we want him to greet you we thank them for coming and if they come that far with that many people you got to sing more than one that's the way I feel about it amen God bless you my brother I met him some years ago I didn't quite remember him until I saw his face and so I'll let let him greet the Saints and you could tell us about your church and and those things amen we'll take this one here I bless you by amen uh God bless you Church amen uh it's good to be here it's always good in the house of the Lord and uh my name is uh brother Edmond rafino we're from uh massachusett and we came down here nine years ago and uh we were participating in Harmon desert and we had a great time and uh we bu a few people back then we were singing and um but a peragon asked me to to have the people sing in his church but I wanted to come to be with my brother here but we end up not being able to to be in his church so I said next time I come down here I'll I'll visit him so so I came down here I said well let me give him a call and to see how's he doing so and I guess he's doing well well you know there was a the first time I came down he was back in 1999 and I was preaching for brother perig back then and um we came back again and uh few years after that to to go see um brother brandham Dan with a few people so I've been coming down here not often but from time to time with the church so they can see around so this time again we came with a few more people so they can see but but I'm there and say a few things so so it's good to fellowship with one another you know and when I enter the door I saw old faces and I saw old friend from Alaska where she's that there she is God bless you so it's good when you enter a place you find out you see people that you know so so it's good to be here it's good to be with uh all of you uh because not now it's very rare to find Believers of this end time message you know especially uh those that waiting for the promise so there are those that waiting for the promise and there are those that manifesting the promise so so now those the promises of the prop of God that what he says in the book with AI you know everybody can talk about the promise okay you can say nice word about the promise that can say even better what but what says now the Bible already said if it was possible they will even they even will get the elect they even will get the elect they even will deceive the elect so the only way they will not deceive the elect you have to be able to become the word you have to become the word now because you have to produce what brother Bram says because AI can make you look like the word it can even make you talk like the word but if you don't really manifest produce the word you are fake okay because you can make you like you look like you look good you look like you have one wife you look like you know everything looks fine you have long hair you look like you got everything what like look like you a perfect believer but really you're a fake oh because this is the hour where what said the third pool supposed to be what spoken word or the opening of the word supposed to be all kind of stuff but one thing he said about the third pool he said that's the same thing he was at sudom and gomor he said that's what what Noah was doing by their testimonies so the question is still the same you Believers because he says something at the end of the Bible the same thing in the Book of Genesis the spirit and the bride say the same thing so the question Still Standing today if you're a Believer what is your Vindication okay what is the spirit of God says make you a Believer what is the evidence that God says that will make you a Believer not what the pastor says what what's what the people says what is God says that will make you a believer in the same thing when you get arrested it what he says what is the evidence the C has on you that will make you that will convict you they have to have an evidence that will make you that will convict you to be a Christian and that evidence is the Holy Spirit and what is the evidence that will make you a Believer people waiting for the pastor to say oh you're a Believer will make you somebody said you're a Believer but the evidence is to to produce the word of God if you not manifested this message of the hour you are fake that's right if you're not producing what bam says you have to produce it amen you have to bring it in evidence amen not we have to see it in the papers now all of us we need to see the message amen when I see you I need to you become a living aist because the message pretty soon going to be nothing we have to become the message ourself you have to become a living message so we have to walk the message because our life has to become the message and this is where we at right now and that's why we are singing the messag because there's going to be things that going to turn the message upside down we don't know what's going to happen and this is a Time Believers this is this is the time Believers when we see somebody now we have to see the message in them when we look us seven the mirror we have to see the message when I look myself in the mirror I have to see the message and that's why we're here I come down to see you because I want to see me and you you have to see you and me because we are all together to Spirit and the bride say the same thing Paul said Brethren I beseech you we have to speak the same thing if we not speaking the same thing there's a problem because the spirit and the bride say the same thing we have to have the same testimony we canot have one stret here saying one one thing another church here saying another thing we must say the same thing and what is our testimony Noah has the same testimony same Abraham has the same testimony all the Believers have the same testimony we have to have the same testimony why we are waiting to get outy here you say how we going to get out of here because the Rapture is a revelation we have to have the same Revelation to get out of here we have to have a body change before we have that flesh change we have to have a mind change we have to speak the same thing so this is the hour we cannot play game no more we've been waiting for this time for a long time there are people that's went before us they've been waiting for that time they've been waiting for AI to come they've been waiting for for those PE for this thing that's going on right now they've been waiting for it they've been talking about it they've been I preached about this thing 20 years ago now he's here and that's why I'm so excited to be here to see hey all my people that we've been talking about it all those preachers they've been talking about it hey this is the time we must be excited why we getting out of here I I know every preachers that been preaching this message they're excited because it's time for us to get out here the evidence is here I don't want to hold you long you know when you give a preacher your M you know how it is but I have to go God bless you and thank you very much but let people say God bless you thank you amen praise the Lord you give the preacher a mic all right they preach praise the Lord so we appreciate that and we thank the Lord for them and them being with us here tonight and we trust that the Lord will bless them in their Journey here to Jerusalem once again that the Lord will bless them and strengthen them how long are you all here brother well we came here last night we're going to be here on Tuesday until Tuesday okay good maybe we'll get to see you again the Lord willing to see how the Lord works that out uh this evening we like to greet each of you in the precious name of our Lord and savior sister uh MAA yes and her husband and full quiver and so good to have them and see them and the Lord bless them richly welcome them to the house of the Lord and each of you we like to go right to the word we've been on our Wednesday night is a prayer meeting and we've been just taking a few moments on the cood and we've been on the conduct portion conduct order and Doctrine we've just been dealing with the conduct and this is our third time third service on that just 30 40 minutes or so and then we'll take some prayer requests I've been thanking the lord for it and I've been enjoying myself going into it I trust the Saints have been feeding on the word as well in the scriptures um um um in Hebrews chapter 2 we'll stand and read there Hebrews 2 and Ephesians chapter 1 Hebrews chapter 2 veres 1 1 3 therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip for if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedient received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord it was confirmed unto us by them that heard him amen Ephesians chapter 1 the Apostle Paul placing the Ephesian Church Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word tonight the portion that you have allotted for us Lord help us to just uh consume what you have for us tonight speak to our hearts to every heart that's gathered here Lord let the young ones receive the old ones receive the newcomer the Old Timer each one receive their portion is our prayer in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated amen we took on that first uh order conduct order and Doctrine we was talking about the conduct we talked about the beginnings in Luke chapter 14 Jesus brings that to the believer that he that can't hate his father mother brother-in-law wife children Brethren sisters wife husband whoever whatever and their own life they're not worthy to serve him and so we know that our life is not our own and we don't love our own life we uh live this life for Christ when we come to him we deny ourselves and we're now enlisting into an army and that's the army of the Lord the greatest army now you might think you're here for one purpose or the other as far as why God brought you here uh but to a Believer it's revealed to us why we are here we are to be about our father's business and this is why he institutes the church and he calls us out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light so that we can Proclaim his light he's the light of the world and we become that light of the world world and so that's a tremendous calling and in that calling we are commanded in the scriptures to gather together in his name and not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together even as we see the end time approaching and last time we were here we took uh and we'll continue in that just a little bit about our post of Duty how brother Brandon brings that out as a Believer how the believer has a post of Duty a place that is depending on them and why that is and why God set it up and how he set it up now brother brandom says this in the message the way of a true prophet and again I'll just back up a little bit the reason why we're bringing this this is the ABCs it seems like it's the Simplicity it's the beginning but um if you ever let those things slip like Hebrews said that's right you'll be guilty of being negligent and you know we are not trying to make halfway church members uh the members of any church should be pillars should be able to handle the word responsibly know where they stand on God's word and be able to um defend it even to Proclaim it and live the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that's not just for preachers coming to the house of the Lord isn't just the preachers I'm called to be here the ministers are called to be here but the Believers that are called to that local assembly they're supposed to be there too and Jesus said that when you gather in my name there I will be in your midst what a wonderful promise so we gather with the promise in mind that Jesus said he would be here in our midst I'm going to read from the message the way of a true prophet and the prophet says this here paragraph 26 and he was in the campaign and some meetings and he's talking about the late service that they were having he says but you go you got to go to Sunday school in the morning now now you must be sure to do that and remember I've always said it's absolutely a sin to send your children to Sunday school don't never do that that's wrong take them always see always go with them he and so now that's in the morning so now if you have if you have had to miss work to hear to be with us and pray with us and so forth you have to miss work that's all right just go ahead and miss work but don't you miss church did he say that what' he say don't you miss church I won't make you l late enough to miss church but if you do have to miss work once in a while that won't hurt we switch that around didn't we now cuz work that's just your daily bread and you the Lord promised to provide that so but this you must really be sure to come to church you see so it's brother bandom telling us to quit our jobs and just join a church and go to church every day it's not what he's saying he's bringing in the balance you know this age has taken all of the days of the week it's taken every hour that it can and there's jobs that are available 24 hours a day Sunday through Sunday somebody's hiring and for believers we call our Sunday our holy day that's the Lord's day that we have set aside to Worship the Lord and it's a very important day it's a day we just set aside and prepare for on the Saturday we shouldn't be preparing to go to church on Sunday that should have started Saturday and that would release a lot of the arguing that takes place on Sunday ain't nobody saying amen but it's the truth um you know that Sunday morning belongs to God now you can slip in and try to go to the grocery store in between the services and go pick up this and do a little bit of shopping because something's on sale but I don't think that's right I think we need to go back to what the prophet told us and what the Bible gave us what the Old Testament Sabbath was and how that crossed over to our new testament Sunday the Resurrection Day the world has made it less important the church world has done the same and if you're not careful that spirit will get upon you too so now brother Brandon brings us that you can miss work a little bit if you have to but don't miss church continues on the the message the Seal of Christ paragraph 38 he says this here I became the chief presor next year and maybe I'll be a district man or something that's all the preacher about cares about anymore come on preacher we're going to take it with them that's right oh my pulling feathers in the hat and so forth when we ought to be on our knees crying for the sins and the Abomination and the disgrace that's done in the city we seem to be so unconcerned about the Lost amen amen that's right you know that's truth unconcerned about the loss just so our church makes it so we have the greatest congregation Sunday all stay home Sunday night and look at the television today I was in one of the biggest churches in the city one of the members said we have 3,000 people here on Sunday morning Sunday night we don't have half of it they all come to church to do their religion and go back home look at the television take a little ride out in the country why it's a disgrace it shows there's something lacking in the heart you know many of the churches I'm not criticizing them I'm not talking against it but many of the churches have totally done away with their Sunday evening service and they haven't even added another one during the week and guess what if I cancel a Sunday night service guess what you going to do you'll fill it with something else to do and let's cancel it for a year and then and we can go on a country ride and have the family time and after service enjoy our family enjoy ourselves and do that for about a year and and then I feel it on my heart to bring back Sunday night who's going to give me a hard time most everybody will because you can feel that time in with anything whether it's Sunday night Friday night Sunday morning that's not the point the point is if the if the church is gathering together and you can be there and you decide not to be there not that you couldn't be there but you decided not to be there the scripture says you're forsaking the assembling cuz others are there so you say well brother Israel what if you cancel church we didn't have church anyways you know we missed tonight maybe we're missing out no you're not forsaking that's you're forsaking the assembly so when the assembly is called together to worship Believers that work just like everybody else work people that have children in families just like you have and the responsib abilities and the cares of life and then you take your that that that that um the the uh the the uh the weight of the day and the tiredness and the the aches in the body and I could catch up on some sleep I really should get some extra sleep but you know the doors have been open at the house of the Lord Brother brandom says if the love of God is in your heart it will dve drive you to the church when those doors are open so there's a question to our love then where is our desire in our love if I was going to play a series of movies Here gospel movies or church movies more people would come out to church for that because it's an entertainment and church I mean it's just church again right the song leader somebody's going to preach the brother's going to preach I'm going to get up and use a the bathroom a couple times same brother who falls asleep will fall asleep and it we'll get out about the same time every time well if that's your expectation that's exactly what you're going to get that's it but in the Bible when God called The Tabernacle together it was very serious there was a order and a structure to it behind the curtain was the shakina glory and not just anybody could go in there it was a purpose it had an anointing and God called that assembly together I wouldn't forsake that so brother random continues on in this message a greater than Solomon is here paragraph number 201 he says this here paragraph 203 God said a woman that will wear a garment pertains to a man is an Abomination to God and you man that can't stop gawking and looking at women wom immorally dress the idols of the day you man that hasn't got enough real Grace in your heart to make your wife and kids quit doing such things as that the love of God isn't Anchored In Your Heart don't be called a Son of God you're still in Sodom a man that can't take over his own house God ordained him to do and you deacons that's married two or three times and you man that run out on your wives and try to hold your profession you women that cross the other way you people that hide behind the cloak of the church your denomination won't have nothing to do with the next fellow let him be a Christian or not if he don't belong to your crew you'll have nothing to do with him shame on you may God display real tonight to you may you come to him sweetly now and say Lord forgive me my sins from this night h H forth I'll serve you you that love television programs you that'll stay home to see some immoral movie star like we love sus or what some of the other stuff that they have stay home on Wednesday night to watch television instead of coming to the prayer room the love of God is gone from your heart you do that you still hold your membership the love of God would drive you from that and drive you to your Church to your brother and sister to come together sit in Heavenly places and listen at your pastor preach and the Revival or the camp is ending now if that still remains in your heart let us pray together now that God will remove it prophet of God continues you can say Amen to the word in 1964 the message identification he says this here paragraph 194 now if everyone would just keep your seat and be real reverent just a moment please so you see and contact him you're right on something here and something moves it throws you out it's a very hard thing it looks like that if one woman at SAR had done one time Jesus didn't repeat it over and over but the American people has got to be entertained you know that's just the nature of us we'd rather stay home home and watch television more entertainment that there than there is in the church see see that's Entertainment that's what we want it's got into the church God don't entertain you he just brings you his word praise the Lord so we see this love for entertainment in the church that Christmas and the Easter programs are a big Hollywood production in the denominational world they brought that into the church and now the way they're they have these different kinds of singing that they do and it's like rap music but they put gospel hymns to it and they put that in the church now but I'm so glad that we have a standard and they have people that's going to hold to that standard they have the entertainment in the church to keep the young people but what you keeping or you get them to stay you get them to come but who is there are they being filled with the Holy Ghost is there a change taking place can they handle the correction of the word and that's really a sign of a True Believer is can they handle when the word brings a correction to them and I'll say this here to you Saints God bless each of you that one of the single greatest now it's not the only but one of the single greatest you all think about this and tell me if you agree or not one of the single greatest outward indicators that God is dealing with a man or a woman is directly connected to their attendance in church now you think about that you see a newcomer come on and they get baptized and then you see them constantly in the word at every time the doors are open they're available they're there you have to say God is doing something with them and dealing with them this is why when you're when you're trying to establish someone to be on the board they can't be somebody that's here and there they got to be be here first show the stability of just simple Church attendance you can't even keep a decent job if you can't show up properly right uh like most of the time like even more than most of the time and and then when you do show up you shouldn't be looking to get credit because that was part of the job description and when when you come to the house of the Lord why do we think it's only the pastors are supposed to be here every day like the pastor is never tired he's never wanting just to stay home and sleep in tonight he just loves is coming every Wednesday night the fish are biting and we know they biting on the lake at Springtime and we could take that day off and go fishing and we just you know but you know there's a sacrifice there and when the when the the doors are open that's where the Believers we have agreed to come and gather in his name there and when We Gather in his name he promised to be there that's right it is this Daily Grind that where our training is many times exposed you can see the faithfulness of an individual just based just take the attendance marker just take that right there I'm not talking about someone that can't be there I'm talking about somebody that can be there and choose not to be there that shows that's a spiritual you say brother Israel coming to church doesn't save you I agree it doesn't save you you're saved by the blood of Jesus Christ there's people in the hospital that get saved there's people in prisons that get saved they can't come to church that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about salvation we're talking about your spiritual commitment and your faithfulness it's determined and this age has spoke against us coming to the house of the Lord and even coming to the house of the Lord in a decent halfway decent attire and the people come to church like a unmade bed like a bedroom that need to be swept and cleaned up where are you going what do you think that and you look at you look at the society they go out in Walmart that go shopping in house clothes and then you look at that into the church because they want everybody to feel welcome but I'm so glad we got a standard at coming this day and a witness that comeing this day that showed us and people that care you know you know what the what the what what B blows the excuse away is that you'll say someone will say something like well I have kids but but people that got kids when they show up they just blow that argument up it's like I got more than one kid I got two I got three who got five kids who's got nine kids and where you at you in church them kids you should be more responsible than that you should have them kids at home they got to go to school tomorrow why you going to have them in church because they might get saved they might hear something they need for their soul down the journey in life what is more important than hearing the word of the Lord somebody tell me somebody show me so what God does he raises up a standard by presenting a testimony right before you and I'm glad he does it that way he does so there is something with the sin of omission you omit to do the simp simple things that slip away from us the importance of coming together the sacrifice that's involved with getting dressed after you worked all day God sees it all and the people in the neighborhood see it all and your family sees it all and the church body needs you to be here because we come together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus all right so let's go a little bit further just for a moment all right I'll take a few quotations here and then move right on now our life is not our own we were bought with a price you say me time my own personal time well brother and sister we were actually purchased with the precious ious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir when you join the Army it's till death I mean you really have to be willing to give your life for what you believe if it's really a conversion you'll give your life for it it's not just to join some group or some number you've joined the greatest group you could ever as God birs you into the family of God he's the chief Captain there's dangers seen and unseen there's perils there's swords there's lies there's darts of the enemy the enemy has the Target on your back and now all of hell is after you but hold on good soldier he that called you is able to keep you when others are falling apart backsliding losing their faith going on you'll still be standing in the name of Jesus Christ because God is there to help you he's the one who called you and he will bring you all the way through amen here what the scripture says here we'll take a scripture or two M Luke 142 there were great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and Brethren and sisters yay in his own life also he cannot be my disciple and who soever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intending to build a tower sth not down first and count the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it less happily after he have laid the foundation is not able to finish it and all that behold it began to mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish that's a problem with a lot of Believers today they can't finish verse 31 or what king going to war against another king sth not down first and consulted whether he be able with 10,000 to meet him that cometh against him with 20,000 or else while the other is yet a greater way off he sendeth of ambassage and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not what all that he has he cannot be my disciple so you belong to somebody you're called to a person you're not called to a group although there is a group but you're called to a person and we are his disciples he called us into his army and he's given us the equipment to fight until he calls us home no breaks no taking days off no part-time Christian part-time off part-time on it's every day a Christian it's a fight all the way I don't know a believer that ain't in a fight I don't know a marriage that isn't in a fight I don't know a church that isn't in a fight I don't know a young person that isn't in a fight but Jesus our captain already won the battle for us and all we have to do is stand and stand with him with the word or else while he is other a great way off he sended an ambassador and desireth conditions of Peace So likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple salt is good but the salt is lost his savior wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor fit for the dun Hill but Men cast it out he that hath ears let him hear here so if it's salt it should be salty and if you're a Believer you should count up the cost you should count up the cost that it cost to follow Jesus Colossians 3 1-5 if you then be risen with Christ seek those things which are where above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on on things above not on things of the Earth for you are dead and your life is here with Christ in God when Christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory how many know that Christ is our life mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil and coitous which is idolatry 1 Corinthians 6:1 19- 20 the Bible says this what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods is you're not your own actually your time doesn't belong to you your life doesn't belong to you it all belongs to God we're to we're here to serve him you know we've turned that around we misappropriated that we feel like we we we have our own our our my me time and my and minds and what belongs to me and but for a Believer we're Lambs he say my rights I have a right to do this but as a lamb you give those rights up your time belongs to him you say well I'm going to go over here I'm going to do this but what if God wants you to go over here and pray for somebody what if at the end of the service there's a soul that needs prayer at the altar but you got plans for lunch well whose time clock are you on anyways whose business are you about anyways your little calendar that you have all this stuff you going to do you going to do this and do that and do this your time really your whole life is in God's hands you got only so many heartbeats left here my brother the time clock is switched over and the grain of sand is winding up for all of us and we will give an account for the time and what we spent with our time you know where your heart is that's where your Treasures are and you spend your time where your heart is and when God calls you and he reveals himself to you and this becomes a reality to you then you'll lay everything else aside and you'll pick up your cross and follow Jesus which is the word thank God for it amen amen this type of preaching really should be preached on the Sunday morning somebody told me because that's you know the crowd feels up brother ROM I read the quote for you 3,000 on Sunday morning Sunday evening half of them gone it's I mean all over where I've traveled the Wednesday night crowd is typically a small of crowd we've been blessed that a good portion of the Saints make it here on Wednesday as they do Sunday morning is that right Saints sometimes but just about but generally speaking that Sunday morning oh we can't miss that we can't miss that we got to be there Sunday morning Sunday evening is like I don't know we got something better we can do but your life is not your own all right now there's a couple quotes I want to read here and it's going to put a smile on everybody's face all right I'm going say that by faith some of y'all look well don't let me say that all right I'm going to keep my testimony positive up here but but here's what brother bradam says about staying home from church there's a couple of places where he talks about it he says I watch many times the wolf after the deer it can catch the little deer out to itself that's the that's the one they work on there's a lesson if you can catch a deer away from the herd that's what the devil wants to do so to you young ladies he wants you to go out with the boy that's not a Christian to you young young man he wants you to go out with some little pained Jezebel that's not a Christian that's where he wants to break you up that's where he wants he wants to Sock his teeth into you and this little deer would get out to itself away from the herd that's the one the wolf works on you two old man or woman when you separate yourself from Believers people say I can stay at home be just as good as a Christian as I can at church Church you can't the Bible said not forsake or assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the time coming if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are right and fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to to the table I'll just I'll never never eat I just I ain't going to do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one another more now than we ever did need each other is now when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on D Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real Christian then we've got Fellowship protection people love you and pray for you that's the success of my meetings is because real godly people pray for me that's it in the message in tement 1957 paragraph 54 the prophet of God says this here how can you say you can stay home and be just as good as Christian as you would be at church you can't do it read the word the Holy Spirit feeds on the word the Bible is God's spiritual diet for his church and the Holy Spirit is the one who brings it to you and places it in the heart and with Thanksgiving you water it and every Divine promise will produce just exactly what God said it would do it's got to it's his word and his life Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother bam opens up here a little bit more 1963 paragraph 83 says don't never Clan or talk or make yourself clannish we are one I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away cuz you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay right there even the little tip of my finger I want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another now you've got tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on discipline in the church this is what we're getting into in these messages here the next week or so how we behave oursel in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way way then I tell you it's time you got to pray cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us much more as we see the day that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and love one another this will all men know you are my disciples when you have L one for the other isn't it amazing how this great challenge in the last couple of years has been on this Gathering Together how they want the church doors closed and this issue and that issue keeping Believers from gathering together when there's a direct command for us not to forsake that I mean that's the orders from the Army captain yes sir you can't listen to another private you can't listen to another follower God never called you to follow a follower God called you and us to follow the leader and the leader is the word and our orders come from him so when we want to ask permission from someone we get it from the word but you know what if I want to stay home if somebody's got something that they can you know twist the word around and give a reason why you know what I'm going to jump on that bandwagon cuz I want to stay home anyways but that still doesn't uh that still doesn't take away the word what the word of God has told us specifically as we see the day approaching not to forsake the assembling of yourselves together now here brother manam says this here and we're in the last days the Bible exhorted us that much more as we see that day approaching in the message the position of the believer he says this here now this is our scripture that we read in Ephesians and brother Rand is going to bring that in and I love the way he brings this in in Ephesians chapter 1 that we read that we're in Heavenly places and he says this here paragraph 43 he's addressing this to those now that have come into Christ Jesus by the Holy Spirit Grace saluting them now Grace be unto you peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ giving them the blessings of God grace be unto you and peace from God the Father the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now the fellow said I can be a Christian and stay home just as well no you can't no you've got to meet together with the rest of the body he has blessed us together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen amen praise the Lord that's the word of the Lord to us prophet of God takes one two more places here in the message blessing prophet in the second-handed robe and he says this here 1956 he says Mercy think of that constantly to a ball game to amusement on Wednesday night and sometimes on Sunday night yes stay home to listen to the television and the radio of old short Jabs and jokes that they pull from Hollywood your soul is rolling on that kind of stuff when you ought to have your Bible out somewhere laying out before God on your knees praying for the sins of the country that's right and I'm guilty with you look at the prophet I have made my mind up by the help and grace of God if our God will give me strength to do it I'm determined to press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus Till Death Shall Set Me Free God be my helper to do so help me is my prayer seeing the works and seeing the things that I've seen you have seen and lagging behind and become a spiritual anemia does it seem like the Saints are so tired and they're so heavy and just sluggish and the Slumber and the church service just becomes so long to them and it being begins to be heavy for many Believers but you know what you need to ask God to give you strength give you strength to make it to the house of the Lord to praise him and worship him go get a workout set get a little gym in your back backyard and work out so you can get some strength to serve the Lord better I'm not talking about so you can look in the mirror better I'm talking about so you could serve the Lord go walk and ask the Lord to give you strength Eat Right do something better so what so you can serve the Lord they'll tell you every kind of reason why you should eat right and be healthy and all that's good but what good is to do that you do all that and you staying at home anyways turn that back on over to the Lord yes sir Lord give me strength man young men tired can't make it to church I work two shifts and I'm so tired and then like I work three sh I work the second ship I'm so tired man stop yes sir you're a young man wait till you get some kids and then talk about you tired where the young Brothers at where's the young men at ain't nobody saying amen they strong they they run through do whatever go hiking out there they run in front of everybody take backpacks and they can run they got all the strength and injury where they at when it comes to serving the lord I've called the Young because they are strong and God has called us to this great and glorious word this glorious message Lord give me strength to serve you you know does it get long yes it get long does it get tiring yes it gets tiring but he wants your tired praise you ain't nothing like a Wednesday night praise Sunday morning anybody can do a Sunday morning but I want somebody to come out here on Wednesday night that works all day long that's a praise I want to see that hand go up I want to see that one say amen yeah the church houses are full on Sunday where they at on Sunday night where they at on Wednesday night where they at at the prayer meeting all of a sudden everybody's got to get their rest their beauty sleep and get all their rest that they need rest for what you rest at your funeral that's where you you catch up on your sleep we rest on the other side but here God called me to work until he calls me home God give me the strength to keep building the wall keep building the foundation keep preaching the gospel until Jesus calls us home yes sir give me strength Lord that's right give me strength strengthen my hands strengthen my Ministry strengthen my mind strengthen my very life Lord glory amen amen amen can I read one more yes sir good the message second-handed robe close with this one here many times when there's a blessing laying right ahead the devil tries everything he can to discourage us we go through trials and testings but Elijah being spiritual minded also he knew that he had a purpose and he wasn't going to leave him he said as the Lord liveth and his soul liveth I'm not going to leave you I like that that determination oh my we take a little thing from God and get all discouraged in an hour but not Elisha he looked forward to the time he know that it was a close at hand so he went to another place and he said Terry here I pray thee for the Lord calling me somewhere else you just stay back here but there's no staying back with Elisha he had the revelation of what God was going to do so if somebody says just stay home tonight and look at the television it's too bad to go out don't you worry if you know the Lord Jesus is coming oh you're going to church regardless of what the weather looks like or anything else you're going to stay right there for we're expecting something to happen at any time know the church attendance should go up I guarantee you if our air conditioning went out in the summertime how many Saints ain't coming it's too hot it's too hot brother Paul you can't expect us to go to the church we the AC ain't working it's hot out here in the desert I'm going stay at home and stay cooled off who are you working for the temperature's got to be just right before I can praise the Lord yeah it's got to be just right if it's too hot you know it's cold out there we don't have no heater it's too cold it's it's raining let me see is it raining yeah it's about to rain I don't think I can make it that's how some people are looking for a reason to stay home but a True Believer is looking for a reason to come to church we looking for an opening where the church doors open who's having church tonight y'all having Church yes I'm going to be there yes the True Believer is looking for a praise break looking for a time together with the Saints looking for the Sho glory to come down in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus where the blessings flow the anointings flow the revelations flow that's why we come that's why we're gathered he sends that to us it's a sign of what's in our heart The Daily Grind is our training ground we meet together to receive these instructions from Heaven it's a great outward sign that God is really dealing with an individual is their Church Church attendance we know that's true it's not salvation please don't get that wrong but it does show that the spirituality of the individual is how they make it to the house of the Lord when they can Ephesians 1:3 tells us that he blessed us in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is our post of Duty We Gather in his name we love not our own life because he purchased us with the price and our life is not our own meaning my time is not even minees it belongs to the Lord how many can say Amen to that God bless you pray the Lord will bless you richly so let's bow our heads and musicians come Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight thank you for the opportunity to share the full counsel that's been revealed to us the Simplicity of it Lord oh God we thank you that we can Paul brought it to the Ephesian Believers these same simp simple things that he brought to them orders of conduct oh God I just pray that you would help us to receive that as the prophet said I'm guilty myself or oh Lord I pray that you'll take away the Slumber take away the laziness and the tiredness some of them saints was 80 years old serving you in the early church never missed a service witnessed on the street corners didn't have heaters in their Church buildings were persecuted and shot at were talked against were poor people people had very little to eat but they made it to the house of the Lord and here we are with the greatest message that's ever hit the earth Lord the pastors of the old time prayed more than we pray the mothers of the old time they pray for their children more than we prayed as your Prophet said oh God I pray oh Lord that we would awake out of our sleep amen amen and then you re encourage our hearts to get back on the battlefield and realize who called us to this great calling and that every time our heart beats it's closer and closer to our exit from here we have so many days to serve you Lord and we're strong and healthy those that can run let us
