appreciate uh some of sister um the Caleb and Sister Jesse Lynn's family is here with us and so we welcome them also we pray the Lord will bless them richly amen I had a little place in the scripture I like to read in Hebrews chapter 5 I we'll just take um a few moments on that little message no uh no mortar between us in Hebrews chapter 5 the Apostle Paul in verse number 11 take a scripture reading there we've been in the Statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names and those messages and we trust that the Lord will bless us even further here tonight of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered see in year dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is UN skillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen take one more scripture in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and that is talking on the body of Christ gets into the gifts there chapter 13 chapter 14 and chapter 15 1 Corinthians chapter 12 let's see what verse we wanted to take in verse number we'll take number 18 but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it ha pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncommonly parts have more abundant cess for our cly Parts have no need but God ha tempered the body together having giv more abundant honor to that part which lackthe no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same Care One for another amen we thank God for the reading of his word you may be seated God bless you I wanted to just touch a little bit before we go to our prayer meeting in the stature of a perfect man and on this word Schism in the body that word Schism means a split or a gap that there be no division there be no Gap there'll be no split in the body and we were sharing with the church on Sunday that as we become one with the word one with Christ that there is no mortar in between those great stones that make up the pyramid brother bam tells us that the Great Pyramid which we believe was built by Enoch those tons and tons of great massive Stones were placed together without a mortar joint a razor blade can't even get between there he said and that's how God builds things he takes the leaks out he seals it and it's a finished work and that's what we're we're achieving we're trying to achieve that in our life but in the Statue of a perfect man uh brother vandom says this here and I read it for you I think last time but paragraph number 4:12 is at the end of the message towards the end he said see it's true don't let it Escape you hold on to it children hold on to that remember build upon your faith virtue knowledge patience now here I think I had a piece of paper here if I haven't dropped it somewhere when I was preaching right here it is thank you brother thank you very much if you want to look on it and see there's something here that you might be able maybe it's a little better pattern than it is there that you might be able to copy uh C copy uh this off I'll just tack it up here and you can sure look at it and type it off here here's what he says and I want you to take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it okay don't just study it compare it but act upon it when you do take it sincerely to yourself don't say well I enjoy listening at it I did too but to listen at it and then receiving it is different see is different see so brother Ram goes on and he tells us not to just study it but to study it and compare it and then as we compare it we act upon it and let me ask you a question the people that heard this for the first time in the Tabernacle when he preached it them studying it then and US studying it today do we have more resources today than they did yes sir we absolutely did did he we can take these two messages and put them side by side uh statue of a perfect man and blasphemist names and compare them back and forth flip one page to the next page the people that heard this study it um the requirement for their study I would say be a little bit different than our requirement today we have been given the message the word in a very comprehensive way that we can study it is that right no other age no other people that followed the message was ever this close to the coming of the Lord amen no other people had the technology that we have today and the access to the message like any other so I if if we were to say you know back then well I studied it brother bandam I just got a few scriptures and I couldn't afford that tape when it first came out it took a month or so for me to get it and then maybe you know I was building up my library then finally I got blasphemia names and then I finally understood what you were saying and I mean it's years of catching up just right there so for them to study it and compare it he still admonished him to do it what about you and I I don't think the message was there just for us to hear it and not study it to study it and not compare it because that's exactly the opposite what he told us to do he said to study it and compare it and then act upon it of course he's just talking to the preachers right he's just talking to the Sanctified folks right the ones that was born in it right no he's talking to everybody who's listening to it yes sir now if you're not studying it that's on you if you're not comparing it that's a you problem if you're not acting upon it you can't say God didn't tell you because he did tell us and he given us the resources to do it by that's we know that this age that we're living in we're coming up through um the justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so let's go into spiritual food in due season in paragraph number 66 brother bam makes this statement here we find out that when a man comes sent from God ordained of God with the true thus sayeth the Lord the message and the messenger are one and the same because he he is sent to represent thus sayith the Lord word by word so he and his message is the same a denominational man under denominational opes he in the church is one a theologian under theology May by some denomination he and his message are one Church of Theology of Theologian is correctly then when a man comes with thus sayith the Lord he in the message is one can you say praise the Lord praise the Lord let's drop down to paragraph number 70 to number 91 paragraph 91 now he says it again the same message now we find out that Elijah could say that because the message of the hour and the word of God the messenger the message the message and the Word was exactly the same thing the prophet the word the message messenger message and message was the same Jesus said if I do not the works written of me then don't believe me that's good any man in his message is one that's why today that they do not believe in doing the works of God because they do not accept the message of God they don't believe the message but those who believe God's hour that we're living in these things are hidden food yes sir just think God has so hid it that they look right at it don't see it the same way Elijah blinded the Syrian Army the same way that God blinds the unbeliever from the true Genuine Food of the child the believer but the random Contin in paragraph number 1 uh 26 the same message we notice here again if the word is in us and has come to us as it did Elijah in that day it'll do the same thing that he did he would feed on the secret things of God which is hid from the world oh again it makes the message and the messenger as one the spiritual food is ready it's in the the season now and each one of you can have this food if you wish it amen if you are willing to steal away from all of the unbelief of this hour if you are ready to come into Christ and come into his promise and remember his promise in Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 St John 14:12 and how many more scriptures telling us Joel 22 238 and all that he would do 228 rather that he would do in these last days and how that the prophet said it would be like light in the last days and how it would work what it would do all the scriptures pointing to this last days and that is Christ if you can hide away in that now in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and the mercy of God if you're sick there is healing there praise the Lord now that's that's that's very clear brother random says it all throughout that message that the message and the messenger are the same there's an element today that wants to separate that they want to separate the message from the messenger because we don't want to find ourselves following a man and we don't want you find ourselves you know we got to follow the message elzer came now put him to the side and follow Isaac you hear that said all the time but you can't separate the message and the messenger you can't separate him preaching in the pulpit and when he's out hunting in Colorado or in the great state of Arizona there's a whole bunch of great great tremendous nuggets you have to erase if you take out all the hunting trips it wasn't just him preaching behind a pull pit his very life that he lived the way God expressed and used the vessel for our day make him the message and the messenger the same one and the same amen we'll get into something here in just a moment the message leadership brother brandom says this in paragraph number 56 uh paragraph number 57 I'll take that your teacher can give you an education she can teach you you have to learn it your mother can teach you to walk you have to learn to walk your father can teach you how to be a businessman or what you have to learn that but only Jesus can give you eternal life see your priest your leader and so forth can teach you your religion you can learn the message that we are trying to teach but still that won't give you eternal life you've got to accept the person Jesus Christ you understand that all of you got to accept the person Jesus Christ to have eternal life amen but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us till we don't know what to do then when that time comes so the teacher but you have to learn your mom can teach you but you have to learn and you can try to learn the message and you can read a quote or read the scriptures but until the scriptures become one to you the Holy Spirit has to teach that to you and this is the the hour that we're living in it's bringing us up to a place now I want to take that I'm going to deal with that scripture in Hebrews 5 and I'll get back to this that we read and and brother brandom is talking about in Hebrews chapter 5 number six and he says this about the scripture that we read you know I know some people are maybe uh shy when it comes to teaching you think of sitting behind behind a desk you think of hours and hours of study but you know uh the Bible says to study the word of God David said that he hid the word into his heart so he wouldn't sin against God he read the word he he he he he fed on the word so he can become one with that word here's what brother vam says about that scripture in Hebrews chapter 5 paragraph 40 nine we're going to start on this our regular study I read the rest for a moment the 11th verse of whom we have many things to say hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing for when the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk instead of strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe that's Hebrews 5:13 he's reading and I hope that the holy spirit is taking that right down in the bottom of you now for he that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a baby you give a baby strong meat you kill it that's the reason so many people say ah I don't believe that and walk away still babies they just can't understand they can't grasp that truth it kills them Great Mighty things the church should know today but you couldn't teach it they they stumble over it they don't know what to do with it Paul speaking to the Hebrew group yet Scholars he is speaking to now Scholars well learned find out in a few moments very scholarly but the Deep spiritual mystery the church is still blinded to it he said when you ought to be teaching others you're still a babe oh I know there's many rise up and go out and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher when you get that idea you're just wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church if he was going to be the teacher see they there are first apostles office teachers evangelist pastors the holy spirit sets teachers in the church so he could teach through that teacher and if it isn't according to the word God doesn't confirm it then it isn't the right kind of teaching it must compare with the entire Bible and be just alive today as it was then there's the real thing made manifest and so this teacher that wants to teach us the great the church should know the the they they can't grasp it the Great Mighty things the church should know today but you couldn't teach it but you know as we hear this word and we have access to the message and we see where the Prophet is actually giving us instruction to study the word and I believe that's for the youngest one to the oldest one and we don't all feed the same way but God is the one who does the teaching he is our Shepherd he's the one who's doing the leading and when you go to him you open up your word and you go to him it is his responsibility to open the word to you you can't make yourself see anything you you can't give anybody a revelation but he who opens the eyes he's able to give that understanding to the word that's needed did you know that the real problem of the age in Revelations chapter 3 was the big problem for the age was that they had it need of nothing they um they uh thought they were Rich they thought they had all but the counsel was I I counsel thee to buy gold that you'll be rich and I counsel thee to purchase garments that you won't be naked and then I C thee to anoint your eyes with what Isa so you can see and there's a blindness in this age it's very loose it's a very loose attitude it's it's in the organizations and in the denominations we kind of laugh at Catholic people some of us do that they don't know their Bible but they know Church they know what time mass is they know how to pray to Mary they know the rosary but they don't know their Bible and then you laugh at the Jehovah witnesses that they have a twisted Bible and then you know the type of version that they have and then we talk about the other groups remember there's only one holy book and that's the Holy Bible and we think of all those groups that are ignorant scripturally but think of it what about us today all right what does that lazy uh attitude get upon us today not to search it brother Brandon will tell us as we're listening to the tape you'll say now go home and take these scriptures and them and many of us act like he ain't even say it or he's talking to them on the tape no he's talking to you he's talking to me so when it's to study it and to compare it and to act upon it the holy spirit is the teacher that will accompany you when you're reading his word you don't have to be afraid of the seven seal you don't have to be afraid of any of the tapes any of the Mysteries it's God's word word you're his child Lord give me what I have need of it's his job to open up the word and it's our job to ask him amen yes sir it's a very loose attitude in study as it comes as it pertains to study you know the preacher get up or the prophet takes uh two hour sermon three- hour sermon with all the notes and all the comparison and we'll listen to that and not won't make one mental note one scriptural note no pen and paper no notes at all no study at all and I just think and I believe that we're going to be held accountable you know and I can see if you didn't have the tapes and you can say well I don't have the tapes when I came in the message it was $5,000 to buy the entire message that's what it cost and I had my own little library that I was building I didn't never get my own but then God by his grace and his Mercy we all got it now and here we have this command for us to study it what do you think God's not going to hold us accountable to that word when the equipment was there for us to have so let's go a little bit further so it's the unbelief of the hour and the last day word is bringing us up to this great Capstone let's take this message have not I sent thee brother bandam says this in 1962 why didn't that they never put a cap on the stone I've been there at that at the pyramid why didn't they put a cap on it because it was rejected that was the Cornerstone where all the other Stones was fit together it it was speaking of the church age look way down here at the Lutheran age way back in the majority back there just to confess Christ was my just means to be a Christian justification Along come Wesley sanctification a little narrower sanctification then Al come the Pentecost baptism of the Holy Ghost what is it shaping up justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now what's he doing that's got to be honed out so perfect that church brought into such a place that the stone that's coming to fit on top of it see what I mean that pictures the church and through it all is the church now that's just makes a parable I'm talking about don't try to go into it then the next Bible the real Bible is this this is our word just them signs and things had back there but notice how perfect that stone it was rejected they never did put it on why and if you go there them Stones up in uh up in that pyramid that weighs tons and tons that is so closely fit together you can't put a razor blade and no mortar it it's so perfectly honed together then if that had to be like that that to make each age fit together then what's it going to be when the coming don't don't you see the church shaping up Luther justification Wesley sanctification then come the Holy Ghost and now Church getting honed and fixed then without a spot or a wrinkle so him that had no spot or wrinkle can come down and connect it together for the resurrection for the Church of the Living God to take its flight into Glory see yes now we're living in in that day John was looking for that to come he said I'll know him he's out there I don't know where he he's standing out there maybe some Bishop walked up and and so brother Adam continues on he takes Blasphemous names in 1962 paragraph number 72 and he says this here so we see that we are in no spot no wrinkle that's our requirement not even a blemish our age is the age of perfection Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as our father and your father in Heaven is perfect that's an age requirement that's not for them back there that's for us here today and it's a very serious requirement and God's not going to wink at nothing because he's given us the tools to reach the stature of a perfect man he's been good to us hasn't he we know when we listen to the message we got a clear clean word our food is not contaminated we know that it's not a question at all but you know and God's been good to us and we don't realize how good it's been until we get something that's contaminated maybe but here brother vom he takes this have not I sent thee in Phoenix 1962 paragraph I'm sorry Blasphemous name sorry paragraph 72 Enoch completed in his day or back in that day the Pyramid of course we haven't got time to background and and show you how that that pyramid come up through the chambers and so forth it speaks right to the end time now I read this for you Sunday they're in the king's chamber now by the measurements but the headstone never was put on the pyramid and that sets perfect architecturally or masonry until even the little thin razor blade they don't know how they ever built it don't understand it could ever a razor blade slice along the sides where the mortar should be and there's no mortar in it it's just perfected put together so that's what it is when Christ and the church become one there's no mortar between there's nothing between just God and the person God Christ and the person now but the headstone you'' never found it and and and brother Adam continues on and this paragraph 75 he says notice the American dollar bill on the American dollar bill on one side the left side is the American seal and eagle with the Spears in his hand and on the second side this is called the Seal of the United States but on the next side is the pyramid and above it a great eye and under here it says the Great Seal why would it be the Great Seal in this nation even above the Seal of our nation see no matter what you ever do God makes it speak just the same see he makes the Sinners speak of it he makes the nation speak of it everything has to speak of him whether you want to believe it or not it's right there now notice there's a eye in that the eye of God and because that the cap didn't come off the head seal because it was rejected which was the Son of God the Cornerstone of the building the head seal of the pyramid all this now and brother brandom continues on so our money testifies it's on the dollar bill the founding fathers Founders the the designers of it they have the eagle and they have the pyramid and then they have the C happen they put an eye up there and it looks like oh that's a nice design that's kind of neat it's sharp beautiful they didn't know they working in the hands of God why because it showed that the the Capstone wasn't put on there why because it was rejected now it it's getting it's being rejected again today yes can I go a little bit further and now the Christ that they're rejecting not not the Hoffman head of Christ picture is this Christ this is the one they're rejecting this one right here yeah so they put him out of the church in Revelations chapter 3 and he's on the outside trying to get back into the church and that is repeated again in the rejection of the great headstone which is this message here what the prophet of God says here and why I'm against organized religion yes and you'll see why the church is try to cool away from brother brandom and his message they want to preach it they want to teach it but they want to leave the man part out of it but they are men themselves preaching yes sir can I go a little bit further here paragraph number 73 and why I'm against organized religion but what n Nicodemus had to learn to what many people today of the denomination of this day has to learn what Nicodemus ought to have know is what the people today ought to have know of these denomination he was more than a prophet he come to him to find to tell him which way to life and Jesus himself was life he that hath the son of has life so he didn't he must have come to try to learn to teach him mustn't come to try to learn a teach him he must come to accept the person that's what it is tonight the Chief Cornerstone is rejected again what is the Chief Cornerstone it's the word of course Christ is the word so here brother bam is telling us this is November of 62 this is the message after statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names and then why I'm against organized religion it's right in that same line so he's talking about The Headstone that was rejected and he said that it was rejected again so it's not just the rejection on the day of Pentecost they're rejecting The Headstone Ministry the message of the hour and they want us to feel ashamed to preach about it or talk about it we don't have nothing to be ashamed of this is what God showed us and revealed to us it it's your message message but it's got to be my message it's got to be personalized to me the prophet that coming this day it's my Prophet you can have him too but he's mine and I handle him like he is mine I believe him like he is mine and I hold on to his word like he is mine and the next man can do whatever he wants to do but when it's revealed to you that it's the word for the day you handle it as such am amen so we see that the rejection happens in this age again this message turn on the light oh let's take conferences just for a moment I have 10 more minutes or so the message conferences says this here paragraph number 255 God being infinite he cannot say well I was mistaken 2,000 years ago God is eternal he never did begin he never will end and the only way you can ever be like him is be part of him on the day of Pentecost that great Pillar of Fire that followed Israel or Israel had followed it through the Wilderness see the great Pillar of Fire was God the angel of the Covenant Jesus Christ Moses esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the treasures in Egypt so he forsook Egypt and followed Christ notice on the day of Pentecost what did God do he taken that big Pillar of Fire and divided it that was himself tongues of fire fork tongues clothing tongues come down Fork it tongues set upon each one and oh when we ought to oh when we ought to be ashamed to let our organization divide us when God divided himself Among Us that we might be one amen this will all men know that you're my disciples do you hear that brother and sister God divided himself we are never divided one another because we're parts of God just let this fire come to this fire and after a while you'll find out it'll move that it's come through Luther Wesley Pentecost find out the pyramid will be capped one of these days you know it never was capped the pyramid on the back of your dollar the Great Seal it says and we America here is the American seal on this side but why did it say the Great Seal the one that Enoch made not pyramid doctrines now cuz I don't believe in that kind of stuff but they never did cap the pyramid why the Capstone was rejected but it will come again someday praise the Lord I hope it's coming to me I hope I get a visitation from the Capstone I hope the Lord Jesus Christ comes down in a greater measure to me because we represent that pyramid don't we Capstone was rejected but it will come again someday praise the Lord and see in that pyramid I've been there it's hon so close so even you can run a razor blade there's no mortar between it it's just perfectly set together like the same Stone and when that church gets honed into a perfect image of Jesus Christ he will come resurrect all the saints when he comes and take them with him the Church of the Living God will be caught up amen turn on the light 1964 he says this here in paragraph number 99 oh of loose Luther and Wesley and all of them can see that that yesterday's stuff can only be used as it goes through a process when the Holy Ghost reveals the light from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now the last hour of the coming of Christ is got in it the profile not of the queen but of the king of Heaven that represents himself as the church has has become closer into the minority like the Ministry has to be the same kind of ministry that he had what did he say there the church has to have the same Ministry that he had no flaws in him right he was anointed right he did the father's will right we got to have that same Ministry amen do we have an example for it yes we do like the ministry has to be the same kind of ministry that he had those who died in Luther's age down at the bottom of the pyramid like not a pyramid teaching but just for an example that pyramid is so perfect if any of you has been there you can't run a razor blade hardly they had no mortar in it and as far as we know the architect of it was so great now they lost The Headstone they don't know where it's at now when The Headstone returns it'll be just like the rest of it it will blend in with the stone that's left left open if you should put the headstone on it it have to be that way and when Jesus returns he'll find a church that's washed without spot or wrinkle it'll be the same Ministry he had it'll bring back The Headstone now praise the Lord that's a mighty statement there that when Jesus returns he's returning to a church that's not halfway ready a church that's not arguing with one another over some scripture over some you know little offense of a carnal matter some little thing that happened a year or two ago or something somebody looked at me sideways and somebody just off you did it the wrong way somebody out somebody and we just conflict after conflict after conf is that the church he coming back for was that the example that was set for us stop looking at church members and look at the headstone look at the sheep that was way before us like I said Sunday morning it's not about looking at other church members it's about me in my prayer closet looking at the word face to face and coming into that image you know um we might lose some things we might not have all things friends and and and things like that relations and we we might have to you know go the the extra mile and we might have to pay a better a bigger price but is it worth it to make Heaven your home I mean look come on there is no group of people that has ever been in our position no group of people ever been this close to the coming of the Lord no group of people saw the laws Chang overnight the churches change overnight and if the denominations are my example and we're using that for our example then God have mercy you should have stayed in that all right God never sent an organization or denomination to be our example how to lead worship how we should run our church and how we should build and how we should that denomination has never been our example but God sent us an example and that was his word amen it's high time it's lamp trimming time sir it's no mortar time it's no Schism no division in the body it's no leaven Among Us that's the hour that we're living in it's a very sober hour yes it it's a very serious hour and if you hear the word of the like I hear the word I don't know the the the prophet's message makes me want to go pray fall down on my knees and call out to God for more of this word that's been represented to us you know he's coming back for a church without spot without a blemish without a wrinkle can I finish this message and the message turn on the light here the prophet of God says here in paragraph 103 like my hand here in a shadow it's a shadow only it's darker as my hand becomes more it's negative here positive here as a negative and positive it gets denser darker darker darker and finally it claps together and negative and positive become one that's when church and Christ unites together as a bride with the same spirit that was in him will be upon her when the church comes from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost into the last days and honing her down now for the coming of the Lord oh don't be the rough part on it Pentecostal brother shine up with the word believe every bit of it don't get out into these isms and things who he talking to isms and things we have isms today oh yeah we have things yes can I tell you what some things are no it's Wednesday night I ain't going to mess with you isms and things somebody said get into it yeah we send these little messages back and forth you we don't have we don't have time to be arguing with nobody think about it you got time to argue with somebody about what we barely got enough time to pray right and to study it and to compare it and then act upon it it's not about studying it so you can preach it studying it so you can argue it study it so you can study it so you can act upon it because he's coming back for a church without spot blemish or wrinkle our requirement is different than their requirement they without us cannot be made perfect do you see what I mean it's Christ now taking the rags of yesterday the Lutheran the Methodist Presbyterian and so forth he's putting it through a process what kind of a process a process of the Holy Spirit what they had plus making it till he is pressing his own image when the church and Christ become one in Union God granted I trust you see it if you do see it reminds me of a story of great Welsh Revival was on some great men here in the nation throughout thought they would go over and see the Welsh Revival what would be taking place and as they went over to find out they see what building it was held in when they got to the whales they went around begin to ask about where the building was they seen a happy little officer standing on the corner with his little Tommy hat on was swinging his Club around around like that and so these men walked up to him and said sir could you tell me what building the Welsh Revival is held in he said yes sir I'm it I'm it why he was shedding forth the joy and the light of the Welsh Revival within him so ought the Church of Pentecost today asking who is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever his life of his gospel ought to be shining forth with the word of this age revealing Jesus Christ to the nation just like he was then he was so filled with the Welsh Revival till he was the Welsh Revival we ought to be so filled with Christ till we reflect him in the power of His word that's lotted to us this day Brethren don't be stooped in the things of the world sir don't these cares that take you away stay with the gospel watch every word don't go back to what some father said let's go right now what Jesus said was to take place in this day yes sir we're supposed to be the light of this age manifesting the gospel Luther was his light Wesley was his light Pentecost was his light but we're farther up the road now we're coming into the bride called out elected so remember this is the seventh Church age the lady oan Church age according to Revelations 3 they reject Christ of every Church age that was mentioned in the Bible the leot was the worst of all of them it turned him out rejected him put him on the outside do you see the Moon black out brother bam continues on so we have to become one with the word amen and when Christ returns s he'll be coming from back to a church that had no spot no blemish no wrinkle he'll be coming back to a church that is Jesus Christ repeated again let me take this last quote and God hiding himself in Simplicity and brother random says this my last quote here many people say if I were to live back there no you would have took the same attitude because today in the very same thing being reproduced again today only in another form they stumble over it today just like they did then no doubt in them days they had plenty of preachers but Noah was inspired of God and Noah could look out and see what was fixing to happen and know that an adulterous and Wicked generation like that that God would not let stand so what can we do today but see the same thing a modern Sodom and gomorah see Wicked adulterous people so Polished in scholarship that they stumble over the Simplicity of God's manifestation of his being his word showing his word there's not a person in the world that can say that Rosella that can say that we don't see with th the very word of God made manifest the very promise of the last days the very evening lights that was to shine we are privileged people amen thank the lord we know that it's later than we think and um this comes to my mind start thinking of our dear brother Billy Paul he had a dream one time I didn't give you this to you sis but let's see if I can find it here real quick where he was um and it shook him up and he went to his dad and he talked to him about it and he said that uh I was in my other other phone but he said that he had uh Fire coming out of his eyes how many remember that and um knowing them in the back they probably find it faster than me but there's a man that can turn on the light paragraph 138 and this just really just shook me how brother Adam dropped this dream in there on there how quickly things just and just really the the impression of the hour he says my son Billy Paul he talks in his sleep but he doesn't have dreams very often he had one the other night that shook him up said he dreamed he was in a church and I hadn't come in yet said when I come in fire was flying out of the eyes and I said the time is here it's over and everybody begin screaming I can't my children and even my wife said I can't get Sarah to ask the blessing at the table and so forth I said he said I got to go get Lois and the baby I said Lois can't come now now the baby is too young to know Billy the hour is here we must go I said it's midnight now before daylight Jesus will be here if it isn't then I'm a false witness of Christ and somebody spoke up and said no man knows the minute or the hour I never said minute or hour I said sometime between now and daylight and I said let's go I said but we're at the time let's go we got in the car and started we started up the mountain and when we did it was looked like the light was coming in the skies but dark upon the Earth he said I pulled off the side of the road held up my hands over like this fire still flying from the eyes and he said I said Lord I have did this at your command I have did this just because that you told me to do it this way I have did these things according to what you've told me and I motioned to a big Granite Mountain and a light without hands cut a stone out of the mountain weighing hundreds of tons and here it come I said turn your heads don't look it'll all be over just in a few minutes said then a great holy hush come everywhere as the stone come towards the place it may be later than we think there see that's exactly script RT see the stone without hands cut out of the mountain and so one of these days it's going to be that way when you're going to scream for something I said to them you've already had that time God has constantly warned you time after time yeah I said it's even if it's my own kid or whoever it is the hour is here I can only say what he's told me to say and it'll be there and it was then all of a sudden brother random claps his hand here we come the Storm come out of the mountain without hands Daniel saw that you know back many years ago Billy know nothing about that but it was a dream sent to him from the Lord you know what sobering about that is that it's then you want to get ready or let me pray now let me get consecrated he said you've already had that time the hour is now and so brothers and sisters that's you know this is my this is my vision this is my calling this is my destination is to be one with the word amen I want to shed everything off of me I don't care I'm wrong you want to argue with me okay I'm wrong you're right I don't care that's whoever is Right whoever is wrong I don't care I want to be right with the Lord I want to make the Rapture I wanted this great headstone and this ministry to seal out all the weaknesses all the leaven all of the mortar all of the insincerity and all of the looseness and I want my lamp trimmed and I believe God has given us yes he said to study he gave us something to study didn't he tremendous lifetime not home work but life work for the rest of your life God bless you trust the Lord will bless you and strengthen our hearts with those few words the musicians will come we like to take our prayer requests this young man that was shot he was a preacher preaching there in in in the Phoenix area brother Hans I believe his name is and he's in critical condition still I believe not sure if they made any arrest or not but you know we say well he wasn't in the message you think the shooter cared what message he was in he was preaching like I'm doing right now oh but how many know God has a provided place for us he's got our our steps are appointed and ordered and we want to be found doing his will amen you know if
