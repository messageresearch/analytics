[38:14] having Brother Menow freezing to speak
[38:16] for us on Wednesday night, the Lord
[38:17] willing. And um so before we go to the
[38:22] table of the Lord, let's go to the word
[38:24] of the Lord and stand turn with me in 1
[38:27] Corinthians chapter 14. So good to have
[38:30] the Robson's back
[38:32] &gt;&gt; and with us
[38:34] and uh
[38:36] we really didn't notice that they were
[38:38] gone, did we? Yes. They take up a lot of
[38:41] space. So praise the Lord. And good to
[38:43] have Dylan and his dear wife. Seems so
[38:46] well. Brother Dylan just has a real gift
[38:48] there and we appreciate him. Amen. So in
[38:52] 1 Corinthians 14 from this morning, I
[38:55] asked the church to read that chapter
[38:59] when you get a chance. I'll say that
[39:01] again tonight. And I think it's very
[39:05] very uh beneficial for all of us just to
[39:08] remind us again. And what 1 Corinthians
[39:12] 14 does, it makes you want to read
[39:14] chapter 13 and chapter 12 as well. And
[39:19] uh but I'll take the first verse. It
[39:20] says, "Follow after charity
[39:23] and desire spiritual gifts,
[39:27] but rather that ye may prophesy.
[39:31] For he that speaketh in an unknown
[39:32] tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto
[39:35] God. For no man understandeth him, how
[39:38] be it in the spirit he speaketh
[39:41] mysteries. But he that prophesyth
[39:44] speaketh unto men to edification
[39:47] and exhortation
[39:49] and comfort.
[39:52] Amen. And so uh this morning's message,
[39:54] a notable way to recognize a divine
[39:56] gift. I'll keep that title for tonight.
[39:59] Just uh we're just speaking on the
[40:00] gifts. I used that title because brother
[40:03] Vanom had a sermon titled that that he
[40:05] did not that I don't have a recording of
[40:08] him preaching and I thought that would
[40:10] be a notable uh title a notable way to
[40:14] recognize a divine gift. And so may God
[40:17] add a blessing to the reading of his
[40:18] word. You may be seated
[40:21] uh for a few moments. Those of us that
[40:23] have been raised in the word of our day
[40:28] and the message of our day have been
[40:32] blessed that we are not ignorant
[40:36] concerning spiritual gifts.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; The Apostle Paul very clearly says, "I
[40:44] would that you not be ignorant
[40:48] concerning spiritual gifts." And that
[40:51] word ignorant is I would that you would
[40:55] not be unaware or that you that you um
[41:01] the word ignorant means not to know not
[41:04] to understand what spiritual gifts are.
[41:07] And so we shared a few things a few
[41:09] highlights from the message that we all
[41:11] know is that um a gift is something that
[41:16] you surrender to. There's gifts that God
[41:20] places in your life and that's for
[41:22] edification.
[41:24] That's for his use and for his purpose.
[41:27] There are gifts that you receive that
[41:29] you're supposed to consume. They are for
[41:31] you. The gift of the Holy Ghost. God's
[41:34] grace is a gift. Salvation is a gift.
[41:37] And all those things are for your
[41:39] consumption. I gave the example of
[41:42] sharing a snicker bar with a friend. You
[41:44] know, I give you a gift that's meant for
[41:46] you to eat it right now. But then
[41:48] there's things that God gives us. It is
[41:51] not meant for our consumption.
[41:54] It's meant for others.
[41:57] And that's those gifts that you are born
[41:59] with in the body of Christ.
[42:02] They're contained in the nine spiritual
[42:04] gifts there in first Corinthians.
[42:08] And also uh more than the nine spiritual
[42:11] gifts are the Ephesians 5 gifts.
[42:15] There's gifts and talents of playing
[42:18] music or writing music, art, poetry,
[42:23] uh dreams and a host of things that are
[42:26] for edification.
[42:29] If you take 1 Corinthians chapter 14,
[42:31] that word edification is used seven
[42:34] times to edify. Uh edification, it's
[42:39] used edifying.
[42:42] edified edifyth
[42:45] and it's to get the point across to us
[42:49] that the purpose of any gift is for the
[42:53] edification
[42:55] and that word edify
[42:58] and to be edified
[43:01] it's a Greek word see if I can get it
[43:03] for you here not that you would need it
[43:05] but just to give it to you
[43:08] for
[43:11] And it literally means to build a
[43:13] building. It means building a building.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; And you break that you break that down.
[43:20] And so many times we say things to
[43:22] people because they need to be said. We
[43:26] say they need to hear this. I need to
[43:30] say this because I see it. But is it
[43:32] edifying?
[43:34] &gt;&gt; I'd ask you, is it building a house? It
[43:36] literally means to build a house. And
[43:39] the Apostle Paul uses it also in Romans
[43:43] and in Corinthians.
[43:46] And so, um, as we look to these gifts
[43:49] and what they are and what they mean to
[43:52] the body of Christ, it's God that sends
[43:55] those gifts. And they're good.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with the gifts of
[44:02] God.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Every one of them.
[44:06] He sends them. Some people don't want
[44:09] them. Some people ignore them. But a
[44:13] true believer wants everything that God
[44:16] sends.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; They all have their place, don't they?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; They all are sent by God.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; So anybody like if you go into a
[44:27] Pentecostal church or any group and you
[44:29] hear that gift of speaking in tongues,
[44:32] you shouldn't feel sideways about it.
[44:35] There shouldn't be a bad feeling about
[44:37] it.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; God sent the gift of speaking in
[44:41] tongues.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; No matter what the Pentecostals did or
[44:43] anybody else did, it's in your Bible.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says to covet them means
[44:52] to desire them.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And it actually says to covet earnestly
[44:57] earnestly
[44:59] the spiritual gifts. So the attitude of
[45:02] pushing them off or leaving them alone
[45:04] or not interested in them, that is not
[45:07] the attitude of the Bible. And you'll
[45:09] never find a more gifted message than
[45:12] this message of Malachi 4.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Full of the gifts from the beginning to
[45:17] the end. Gifts, signs, wonders,
[45:20] miracles, gifts, signs, wonders from the
[45:25] beginning to the end. Right. Amen.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; If there ever was a people that should
[45:30] be desirous of these gifts, it ought to
[45:34] be the last day people.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Remember, justification under Wesley was
[45:41] restored to the church. Amen.
[45:43] Sanctification under I'm sorry,
[45:46] justification under Luther was restored
[45:48] to the church. Justification under
[45:51] Wesley, sorry.
[45:54] Justification, help me out, under
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Luther was restored to the church.
[46:01] Sanctification under
[46:04] &gt;&gt; was restored to the church. And was the
[46:06] gifts restored to the church?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, but we don't want to mess with
[46:10] those.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; No, they were restored
[46:13] &gt;&gt; at Isusa. The gifts were poured out
[46:16] again.
[46:18] And God doesn't take his gifts back.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Now, can they be misused?
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Can they be mishandled?
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Can they be misunderstood?
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. In fact,
[46:32] most gifts and all through your Bible,
[46:35] the gifts that God sends to his people,
[46:39] most of the time, the people miss it.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Most of they miss Moses. They miss John.
[46:48] They miss Peter, Paul. They miss Jesus.
[46:52] All of these great and tremendous gifts,
[46:55] they miss it most of the time. And many
[46:58] people miss their gift. You know why
[47:00] they miss it? Because it's not coming in
[47:03] the package that they feel it should
[47:05] come in.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Elijah was Jezebel's pastor. Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Whether she recognized it or not,
[47:15] &gt;&gt; that was still the pastor of the age.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And that entire age will give an account
[47:21] to his ministry.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Whether you go to his church or not,
[47:25] whether you agree with him or not,
[47:26] whether you support him or not, that is
[47:28] still God's pastor for the age.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Can I get a witness?
[47:34] &gt;&gt; So these gifts many times are are are
[47:38] not recognized. Sometimes we don't
[47:40] recognize the gift in our own life. And
[47:44] I think that each of us should be
[47:48] interested in moving forward with God.
[47:51] It would be God moving forward in
[47:54] manifesting whatever gift you have in
[47:56] your life for his glory.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want you to see how
[48:02] a great gift that has come in our
[48:04] generation was missed and brother Badam
[48:08] himself didn't recognize it and um this
[48:13] stargazer
[48:15] a magi type of woman had met him in his
[48:19] early years before his conversion and
[48:21] brother Adams says this in the message
[48:23] early spiritual experiences 1952
[48:28] and he says is this? And I says, she
[48:31] said, "Well, I work in the White House."
[48:34] And she said, "Right as you go into the
[48:36] steps of the White House, there's an
[48:38] astronomer calendar.
[48:41] There's a sailor standing behind you.
[48:43] Ask him if the moon doesn't control the
[48:45] tides." I said, "I got sensey enough to
[48:47] know that. See?" And she said, "Well,
[48:50] that's right." And said, "Your birth has
[48:52] something." Said, "Perhaps I will tell
[48:54] you just exactly when you was born.
[48:57] Would you believe me?" I said, "You
[48:59] can't do it in the first place." See?
[49:01] She said, "Oh, yes I can." I said,
[49:03] "Let's hear you." I said, "You was born
[49:05] on April the 6th at 5:00 in the morning,
[49:09] 1909."
[49:12] I said, "That's right." I said, "Tell
[49:14] this sailor when he was born." She said,
[49:16] "I couldn't do it." Well, I says, "Why
[49:18] can't you tell him if if you could tell
[49:21] me?" She said, "Because you were born
[49:23] under a sign.
[49:25] I don't know what that was to appear.
[49:28] She said, "Has ministers never talked to
[49:30] you?"
[49:31] &gt;&gt; I said, "I have nothing to do with
[49:33] preacher."
[49:35] &gt;&gt; I said, "I don't have nothing at all to
[49:36] do with them at all. I'd always run from
[49:39] it, you know, thinking of that speaking
[49:42] to me. And I know that was the same
[49:44] thing my mama told me them things was of
[49:46] the devil." And I stayed away from them.
[49:50] And I said, "No, sir. I have nothing to
[49:51] do with it." She says, 'Well, nobody
[49:54] ever nobody ever told you that.' He
[49:56] said, 'Isn't it strange that the
[49:58] preachers wouldn't know that?'
[50:01] I said, 'I don't fool around where
[50:03] they're at.
[50:04] I thank you very much. She says, "Well,
[50:07] look, you were born under a sign. I want
[50:11] to tell you this as a gift." And she
[50:13] said, "If you would only could recognize
[50:16] it." I said, "Yes, ma'am." I said,
[50:18] "Maybe I will be Daniel Boone." I like
[50:21] to hunt. I was born in Kentucky. She
[50:23] said, she said, and and said like that,
[50:27] she says, "No." She called me. She says,
[50:29] "No, that ain't what I'm talking about.
[50:31] Maybe I'd be a businessman. I got a
[50:33] grammar school education." She said,
[50:34] "That's not what I'm talking about. I
[50:37] don't know what you'd be, but I know
[50:39] that according to astronomy that on that
[50:43] time, she tried to tell me of the cycles
[50:45] and in commemoration of the son of God
[50:49] when three stars came together. She said
[50:52] three wise men, the magi followed three
[50:56] different stars. They didn't know when
[50:58] they when they were coming. And when
[51:01] they gathered together and met each
[51:03] other at Bethlehem gate following three
[51:06] different stars, they formed the one
[51:08] morning star that hung over the Christ.
[51:11] And she said one was from the lineage of
[51:13] Ham, Sham, and Jeff, the three sons of
[51:16] Noah. Those three stars went together
[51:18] and made the one star that hung over
[51:20] Christ. It says, "Then when they
[51:23] separated, they never went to their
[51:25] orbits. They never been sent. And now
[51:29] all the stargazers in the country never
[51:31] seen such as that. And they never
[51:33] noticed it. It was just supernaturally
[51:36] given. And on talking like that with all
[51:38] of her stuff, well, I couldn't
[51:40] understand what she was talking about.
[51:41] She said, "In commemoration
[51:45] of that greatest gift that God ever gave
[51:48] the earth, he sends back something
[51:52] lesser in commemoration of that time.
[51:58] Now, brother Banham says it again in how
[52:01] the angel came to me in his commission
[52:04] 1955. He says this here in paragraph
[52:07] 186. And I won't be long. We're going to
[52:09] come to the table just now.
[52:12] And she said, "Now these three wise men
[52:15] came and when they three stars, they
[52:18] come from different directions. They met
[52:20] at Bethlehem and they said they found
[52:23] out and consulted."
[52:26] One was from the lineage of Ham, Sham
[52:28] and Jeff, the three sons of Noah. Then
[52:31] they come and worshiped the Lord Jesus
[52:33] Christ and said when they departed said
[52:35] they brought gifts and put to him and
[52:38] said Jesus Christ said in his ministry
[52:40] that when this gospel has been preached
[52:42] to all the world Ham Sham and Jeff's
[52:45] people then he would come again. She
[52:48] says now those planets heavenly planets
[52:50] as they move around they separated.
[52:52] They'd never been on the earth since
[52:54] known, but said every so many hundred
[52:57] years they crossed their cycles like
[52:59] this. If there happens to be an
[53:02] astronomer here, you might know what she
[53:04] was talking about. I don't. So when she
[53:07] was they crossed like that and said in
[53:10] commemoration of the greatest gift that
[53:14] was ever given to mankind when God gave
[53:17] his son when these planets crossed
[53:20] themselves again why said he sends
[53:24] another gift to the earth and says you
[53:28] were born on the crossing of that time
[53:31] and said that's the reason I knew it.
[53:35] Now, where is that written in the
[53:38] scripture?
[53:41] Where is that found to be truth or not?
[53:46] But here's the prophet of God relaying
[53:49] what a non-minister told him before his
[53:54] conversion
[53:55] that those gifts that that great gift
[53:58] was already in his life if he could only
[54:02] recognize it. Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; And later on he would come under that
[54:07] and recognize that great gift. And we
[54:10] thank God for that great gift that was
[54:12] sent. But when God sends a great gift
[54:14] like this, do most of the people catch
[54:17] it or not? Do most of the people uh
[54:21] receive it? No, they don't. In fact,
[54:24] they miss it. Most of the time, they
[54:28] miss God's gift. They'll miss him in the
[54:32] in the neighborhood. They'll miss him in
[54:34] the family. They'll miss it in the
[54:36] church. They'll miss it in the word of
[54:38] the Lord. God's great gift being
[54:42] manifested. And many of the people won't
[54:46] take advantage of it. In fact, they'll
[54:49] let intellectualism
[54:51] rule and lead and guide them. They'll
[54:55] argue. They'll fuss. They'll prove it
[54:58] through words, through um through um the
[55:02] letter of the law, but um will fail to
[55:07] really let those gifts be manifested
[55:11] among them. Now,
[55:14] it is true that these gifts can be very
[55:18] controversial
[55:19] and they can cause confusion,
[55:22] but God is the one who sends them. And
[55:26] when God sends us a gift, we want to
[55:30] receive what God has given to us.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[55:35] &gt;&gt; And we each one have a purpose in our
[55:39] own life that we should be accountable
[55:41] to.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; And our purpose is not after the service
[55:46] to hit brother or sister up to say
[55:49] something to tear them down.
[55:52] Neither is the testimony service used to
[55:54] testify to tear somebody down.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Neither is the sermon or a preacher or
[56:01] pastor or any gift to take a sermon to
[56:04] beat anybody down. But the sermon, the
[56:07] song, the gift, the words of
[56:09] encouragement, the lunch, the words, the
[56:12] talk should be building,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; building up, edification
[56:19] that it could be edifying.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And this is what the Apostle Paul says,
[56:25] I'd rather speak five words that you can
[56:28] understand, it would edify you than a
[56:30] thousand words in an unknown tongue.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:36] Let us be edifying. Wouldn't you say?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gives the example of a
[56:42] knife
[56:43] and a gift can be used or misused.
[56:48] You can use the knife for the right
[56:50] purpose or it can be misused.
[56:53] And not every hand should have the knife
[56:56] in their hand. A little child,
[57:00] one who doesn't know how to use it
[57:02] shouldn't hold that or use that because
[57:05] it can cause great damage.
[57:08] Can cause more problems than anything.
[57:12] Now there's a question that in questions
[57:15] and answers in law having a shadow in
[57:18] 1954
[57:20] that the prophet of God deals with and I
[57:23] want to read the question and it's a
[57:26] very long quotation so I won't read it
[57:28] all. I'll just get some highlights of it
[57:31] and then I want to play the um
[57:35] um four minutes 3 minutes or so of a
[57:39] section in there about um this question.
[57:44] Is that okay? Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the message questions and
[57:49] answers law having a shadow 1954.
[57:53] Starting right at paragraph right around
[57:56] 51. He says, "Now there's another
[57:57] question. Last night you spoke of your
[58:01] belief in the gift of the spirit. You
[58:04] mentioned that you yourself had spoken
[58:07] in tongues. Do you believe that the
[58:10] program including sermon should yield to
[58:13] the spirit when it is trying to bring
[58:15] forth a message in tongues? I'll read
[58:18] that again. You spoke of your belief in
[58:21] the gift of the spirit. You mentioned
[58:23] that you yourself had spoken in tongues.
[58:26] Do you believe that the pro that the
[58:29] program including sermon should yield to
[58:33] the spirit when it is trying to bring
[58:35] forth a message in tongues? Now I was
[58:40] raised in the Pentecostal church and the
[58:42] way I was raised was when these gifts
[58:45] would take place that if someone is here
[58:48] preaching the word and someone would
[58:51] rattle off in an unknown tongues that
[58:55] whatever was coming forth in the tongues
[58:57] was fresh.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And so that should supersede
[59:04] what's being said up here. And it's uh
[59:08] it seems like okay I can see that but
[59:12] and even brother Vanom talks about it
[59:14] how he had to sit a woman down that was
[59:16] trying to manifest a gift while he was
[59:19] ministering here
[59:21] &gt;&gt; and after the service they got after
[59:23] him. Brother Brandham you grieve the
[59:25] spirit. So, how can preaching the word
[59:28] grieve the spirit when it's the spirit
[59:30] that wrote the word that I should be up
[59:32] here by the spirit preaching?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; And if there's another spirit out there
[59:36] under the gift working, shouldn't we be
[59:39] working together?
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Or do you have your own little spirit
[59:43] and I got my own little spirit?
[59:46] &gt;&gt; And when I come to church, I'm going to
[59:47] do my own little thing and brother over
[59:50] there doing his own little thing. And
[59:52] everybody's doing their own little
[59:53] thing. Or is there one Holy Spirit?
[59:57] &gt;&gt; And the one Holy Spirit is trying to do
[1:00:01] NOT MY THING, NOT YOUR THING, BUT HIS
[1:00:05] THING.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY SPIRIT IS TRYING TO DO
[1:00:09] SOMETHING.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right or wrong?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And so this question kind of deals with
[1:00:17] that. I can see in the question there
[1:00:20] that should including the sermon should
[1:00:23] yield to the spirit like if there's a
[1:00:26] spirit speaking says should you yield to
[1:00:28] the spirit of the tongue even if you're
[1:00:31] in your sermon so brother Vanam is
[1:00:33] dealing with this paragraph 51 now I
[1:00:36] answered that to an extent last night
[1:00:39] now I will finish it this morning now
[1:00:41] speaking in tongues is a gift of God but
[1:00:44] it's subject to what's on the floor at
[1:00:47] the first place. Now, there Christians,
[1:00:50] there's where you make your mistake.
[1:00:52] Now, do I don't know. Someone told me
[1:00:54] that Monday night or Tuesday night when
[1:00:56] I was preaching that somebody spoke in
[1:00:58] tongues while I was preaching. It's a
[1:01:01] good thing I didn't hear it or I'd have
[1:01:04] stopped and called you out right there
[1:01:07] because you was out of order. The Holy
[1:01:10] Spirit, if I'm anointed of God, speaking
[1:01:12] by the Holy Spirit, he's speaking here.
[1:01:15] You don't speak over here and over here
[1:01:17] and over here a confusion. The Bible
[1:01:20] says that Christian see
[1:01:23] we must get those things down in our
[1:01:25] heart. Everything has to come in its
[1:01:28] season. Speaking in tonesues is is is it
[1:01:32] speaking in tonesues is give away to a
[1:01:35] place for speaking in tongues. See then
[1:01:37] if someone speaks in tonesues
[1:01:40] now I ain't saying the person was wrong.
[1:01:43] I don't say the person was
[1:01:44] demonpossessed.
[1:01:46] I believe the person was sincere. I
[1:01:48] believe I believe the p the person that
[1:01:51] if they could speak with tongues,
[1:01:52] they're blessed of God. But the person
[1:01:54] is just like brother Neville standing
[1:01:56] here trying to sing a song. Maybe he's
[1:01:58] gifted to sing a song and he's here
[1:02:00] singing a song and me standing here
[1:02:02] trying to preach right in his face and
[1:02:04] him singing a song. Well, that's out of
[1:02:07] order. If the Holy Spirit is in the
[1:02:10] singing, let the singing go on. See, and
[1:02:14] then if he's standing here started
[1:02:16] preaching and he raises up then and
[1:02:18] starts to sing a song while I'm
[1:02:20] preaching, that's out of order. The Holy
[1:02:23] Spirit is not an author of confusion.
[1:02:26] See? So that's right. So get that
[1:02:29] church. You're lovely people, but you're
[1:02:31] all in era. Now, if you got a gift, my
[1:02:34] look how he said that. You're lovely
[1:02:36] people, but you're all in error. I mean,
[1:02:39] he must be home. He must be talking to
[1:02:41] people that love him. Children, daddy's
[1:02:44] getting on us. You're lovely people, but
[1:02:46] you're all in error.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if you got a gift, use the gift
[1:02:52] where the gift belongs. If you got a
[1:02:55] pick and shovel, I certainly wouldn't
[1:02:57] try to hold my tomatoes with it. No.
[1:03:00] See, I'd use the pick and shovel when
[1:03:02] I'm digging or digging a ditch. I
[1:03:05] wouldn't try to drive my automobile
[1:03:07] through the cornfield. See, I use the
[1:03:09] automobile to travel back and forth. I
[1:03:12] use my plow in the cornfield. So, I
[1:03:16] ain't got nothing against the plow. I
[1:03:18] haven't got nothing against the
[1:03:19] automobile. They both are instruments to
[1:03:22] be used here for the betterment of
[1:03:24] mankind. I haven't got nothing against
[1:03:26] speaking in tongues. Haven't got nothing
[1:03:28] against preaching, against singing,
[1:03:31] against interpretation of tongues,
[1:03:33] against gifts of healing, but it's all
[1:03:36] to be used in its place. Amen. Now,
[1:03:42] Brother Bam is going to deal from
[1:03:44] paragraph 65 to 70.
[1:03:48] My little friends in the back there, if
[1:03:49] you can play that for us. It's just a
[1:03:52] few moments. It's in the same message
[1:03:54] and it kind of brings it all the way
[1:03:56] down. It's a very that long question
[1:03:57] comes down very long and it's good if
[1:04:00] you can go back and hear it again.
[1:04:07] There's where the Pentecostal church
[1:04:10] gets tied up many times, many of them
[1:04:12] are in order. That's what's caused
[1:04:14] trouble in the brand tabernacle. See,
[1:04:16] it's because you people with your gift
[1:04:19] don't know how to use it. And that's the
[1:04:21] reason you need Bible teaching to know
[1:04:23] how to use that gift to get the best out
[1:04:25] of it for the kingdom of God's sake.
[1:04:28] Speaking in tongues, I wish every one of
[1:04:30] you spoke with tongues. I wish the
[1:04:32] interpretation of tongues are with every
[1:04:34] one of you. But you couldn't do at the
[1:04:35] same time. You've got to yield to the
[1:04:38] order of the spirit. When the spirit has
[1:04:41] anointed a brother here preaching, he's
[1:04:42] saying you're preaching the gospel like
[1:04:44] that. Then let your gift yield to that
[1:04:46] spirit. Because it's just like I said
[1:04:48] last night I now a lot of people didn't
[1:04:51] like speaking in tongues. They said to
[1:04:54] the devil and you good Nazarene people
[1:04:57] your own church that's where it
[1:04:59] backslid.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Exactly. When the light of speaking in
[1:05:02] tones and the gift of the spirit come
[1:05:04] you deny that a person in a Nazarene
[1:05:06] church. You know how they feel. If you
[1:05:08] speak in tongues you're a devil.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; I'm a little woman today that was just
[1:05:13] revealed to me last night. a little
[1:05:15] woman in New Orle that's real real bad.
[1:05:18] And since the anointing's inside of me,
[1:05:20] she come to my house and the Holy Spirit
[1:05:21] told her exactly what was wrong. Told
[1:05:24] her all about some horrible sinful
[1:05:26] things she did and pronounced her
[1:05:28] healing. And the woman went away and got
[1:05:29] with a bunch of Methodist Nazarene
[1:05:31] preachers that believes that anybody
[1:05:33] speaks with tongues is God is a devil.
[1:05:35] And the woman believes that and she's
[1:05:37] blaspheming and she'll never get over it
[1:05:40] until she comes and receives the Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost.
[1:05:43] You can't mistreat God.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you're doing. If one
[1:05:48] word against that will steal you out of
[1:05:49] the kingdom of God forever.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Now, if you believe me to be his
[1:05:53] servant, if you think God is with me and
[1:05:55] helping me, and if my words then
[1:05:57] according to the Bible, then you correct
[1:05:59] me. But if they are according to the
[1:06:01] Bible, you believe me to be his servant,
[1:06:02] you better take heed and listen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; That's true. So then here, my hands is
[1:06:08] used for a certain purpose, but I've got
[1:06:10] to go to that. That's why he's there to
[1:06:11] use them. There's no need of my hands
[1:06:13] fighting at that now when my feet try
[1:06:15] and take me over there. Just like a man
[1:06:17] preaching. He's preaching on his time
[1:06:20] for speaking in tones misses hand or
[1:06:22] speaking in tones wants to get to it.
[1:06:24] See, but don't fall out there. Wait till
[1:06:26] my feet get me over there. Then I can
[1:06:28] reach over and get see when a man
[1:06:31] speaking or preaching up here at the
[1:06:33] platform or a message going forth. If
[1:06:35] the man is of God, he's anointed of the
[1:06:37] spirit to preach the word. And that's
[1:06:39] the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit's
[1:06:41] moving that. That's just your gift there
[1:06:43] trying to get you started. But the Holy
[1:06:45] Spirit's coming through the word. And
[1:06:47] the Holy Spirit will always The Holy
[1:06:49] Spirit feeds on the word of God.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Right? And it'll recognize the word and
[1:06:56] be reverent. And then when the time
[1:06:57] comes when the Holy Spirit's left the
[1:06:59] platform, off the minister, come down in
[1:07:01] there, then you're an order. Then
[1:07:03] somebody give up maybe as speaking in
[1:07:06] tongues. Then you're going to give
[1:07:07] interpretation to it. Then watch it. It
[1:07:10] won't be quoting scripture. It won't be
[1:07:12] saying something God don't use for
[1:07:13] repetition. See,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; it'll stand up say, "Thus sayaith the
[1:07:17] Lord, Mr. Brother so and so claim you're
[1:07:20] sick. What done it was before yesterday?
[1:07:22] Sometime you done a certain thing got
[1:07:24] out of the will of God on that. Thus
[1:07:26] sayaith the Lord." Now that
[1:07:29] interpretation, that's where the the
[1:07:31] Holy Spirit only speak to edify the
[1:07:33] church. If you speak with Thomas
[1:07:35] correctly interpretation, don't do it in
[1:07:37] the church. Do it at home. That's what
[1:07:38] the Bible says. Then, and if it if
[1:07:41] that's true, then the spirit of God's
[1:07:43] upon you. May you speak already moved
[1:07:46] from this section of this city.
[1:07:48] Tomorrow, there's coming a style that'll
[1:07:49] sweep all this section out. Now, before
[1:07:52] that can be remember, speaking in
[1:07:54] tongues is not too accurate.
[1:07:57] Paul said, "Let it be first judged by
[1:07:59] two or three witnesses."
[1:08:01] That two or three was divine judgment
[1:08:05] judges. One man with the Holy Spirit
[1:08:08] level pound and docking. Said I believe
[1:08:11] God was in that. The next rings up say
[1:08:14] God was in that. Got one more. One more
[1:08:17] rings up said God was in that. Then you
[1:08:19] let what part of the church is in this
[1:08:20] section? Flee as hard as you can. Get
[1:08:23] out of there. If tomorrow the song comes
[1:08:25] through and blows it up, know God is
[1:08:27] with you. But if it doesn't do it, you
[1:08:30] better be careful. You got the wrong
[1:08:31] spirit among you.
[1:08:34] you better get back up the altar and get
[1:08:35] this thing prayed out all the church
[1:08:37] together and that little person spoke in
[1:08:38] tongues ought to come around the altar
[1:08:40] and say Lord somebody help me I don't
[1:08:42] want to do anointed with that that's
[1:08:43] wrong see so help me get the thing also
[1:08:46] I mean let me get right with you see
[1:08:49] what I mean
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; so be careful church you understand if
[1:08:53] you do say and
[1:09:01] Um,
[1:09:04] wasn't that nice?
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; You know what uh would take place in the
[1:09:09] Pentecostal church many times and some
[1:09:11] of these people with gifts, they'll
[1:09:14] they'll pronounce that the Lord said or
[1:09:17] God is going to do something and then if
[1:09:19] it doesn't happen, they'll say, "Well,
[1:09:23] you broke it because you didn't believe
[1:09:24] it."
[1:09:26] Or they'll make some excuse why it
[1:09:28] didn't happen. But that's that's not
[1:09:30] what we've been taught.
[1:09:33] Uh the prophet taught us that if that
[1:09:36] doesn't come to pass and you spoke in
[1:09:38] the name of the Lord, then the spirit
[1:09:41] that caused you to speak in the name of
[1:09:43] the Lord was the wrong spirit.
[1:09:46] And you need to get that spirit,
[1:09:48] whatever that is, off of you.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thank God for this message. I'm
[1:09:53] great. Thank God for the clarity of it
[1:09:56] because then we can't just go around
[1:09:59] saying the Lord said something that he
[1:10:01] didn't say.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And to be just like me standing up here
[1:10:04] saying that the word says this, this,
[1:10:07] this, and the word didn't say that.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; This is a good reason why I read the
[1:10:12] quotations from the messenger. So you'll
[1:10:15] know that what I'm getting, I'm reading
[1:10:17] it from the prophet.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? All right. Or from the Bible. And
[1:10:22] if I have my own little thing, I have my
[1:10:24] own little thing. We all have our own
[1:10:26] little opinion. But to say and speak in
[1:10:29] the name of the Lord, you got to be
[1:10:30] careful with that.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a true gift of
[1:10:35] the Holy Spirit. Now these gifts, we
[1:10:37] want them to mature in our lives
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; so that they are edifying.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; The gift of gossip is not edifying.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; It is a gift though. And some people are
[1:10:50] very well- gifted and they know how to
[1:10:53] do it very well. I mean they surrender
[1:10:56] to it very nicely and it just flows.
[1:11:01] But that is not edifying.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's not building up. That's tearing
[1:11:05] something down. And if we would be
[1:11:08] honest, many of us have used that and
[1:11:12] have gossip, spoke things that we're not
[1:11:14] sure, presumed, and said things about
[1:11:16] people that are really don't need to be
[1:11:18] said.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:11:22] correction is actually building up. When
[1:11:25] you're being corrected by the word,
[1:11:26] that's to build you and and shape you
[1:11:28] and make you and mold you. And so that
[1:11:31] word edifying is the key word that I
[1:11:34] want uh uh us to really hold on to. It's
[1:11:39] uh to build a house, a building. You
[1:11:42] know, Jesus uses that same word edifyth,
[1:11:46] edifying, edification, edified in 1
[1:11:49] Corinthians 14. And he uses it in
[1:11:52] Matthew 24:1. I want you to turn there
[1:11:55] quickly. And also Mark 13 1-2.
[1:12:00] I won't turn to it. I'll let them get it
[1:12:01] up on the screen if they can get it for
[1:12:04] you. Matthew 24 verse 1. And Jesus went
[1:12:08] out departed from the temple as the
[1:12:11] disciples came to him to show him the
[1:12:14] buildings of the temple. That word
[1:12:18] buildings is the same word and 1
[1:12:21] Corinthians 14 edifying.
[1:12:25] It means to build up the buildings. was
[1:12:28] being built. Something's not being torn
[1:12:31] down. It's something being built up. And
[1:12:33] it's used consistently through that
[1:12:34] chapter. 1 Corinthians chapter 14.
[1:12:38] Also in Mark 13:es 1-2.
[1:12:48] I'll lie on my Bible in the back there.
[1:12:51] And as Jesus went out of the temple, one
[1:12:54] of his disciples said unto him, "Master,
[1:12:56] see what manner of stones and what
[1:12:58] buildings are here." And Jesus answering
[1:13:01] said unto him, "Seeest thou these great
[1:13:04] buildings."
[1:13:05] That same word, I'll finish it. There
[1:13:08] shall not be one left stone upon another
[1:13:10] that shall not be thrown down. That same
[1:13:13] word is a word used to edify.
[1:13:17] And that is what really our gift should
[1:13:22] be edifying.
[1:13:25] It's not something we use
[1:13:29] to manipulate a situation.
[1:13:34] The gift isn't used for you to get upset
[1:13:37] and take and go home with it
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; because things aren't going my way.
[1:13:42] Everybody knows I'm the star quarterback
[1:13:46] and I should be starting. But tell me
[1:13:49] why bozo is starting in my place. My
[1:13:54] mama and big mama and all them told me I
[1:13:57] was better than bozo,
[1:13:59] right? And I got all the support of all
[1:14:01] my family. Bozo shouldn't be in there. I
[1:14:04] should be in there. And you know in
[1:14:06] practice time, the coaches look at
[1:14:08] everything and guess who's starting this
[1:14:10] Sunday? Bozo,
[1:14:14] I know I'm the gifted one. I know I'm
[1:14:17] the talented one. So, what I'm gonna do,
[1:14:21] I quit.
[1:14:24] And I'm going to take my talent
[1:14:25] someplace else. Uh-huh.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; This attitude, you see this all the
[1:14:30] time. And when you and when you take a
[1:14:33] gift that God has given you and you
[1:14:36] treat it that way, you are abusing it
[1:14:38] because it is not your gift. It was
[1:14:42] given to you, yes, but it was for the
[1:14:45] use and edification of the body. So if
[1:14:48] the body needs you
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; at the very last
[1:14:56] to clean up all the scraps in the
[1:14:58] parking lot
[1:15:00] and that is the the gift we want to use
[1:15:03] for you. No, I'm above that
[1:15:06] cleaning up the parking lot. That's for
[1:15:10] those ones down there, not for me. You
[1:15:14] see, that's the wrong attitude. I think
[1:15:16] when you have a gift and you know it's
[1:15:18] not yours for you, it's for the edifying
[1:15:22] of what? The body of Christ.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; So you show up looking how you can
[1:15:29] edify. Where can I build up? Where can I
[1:15:32] help? Where can I join? Where can I put
[1:15:34] my shoulder to the wheel? Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was sharing this
[1:15:40] with a fine brother just the other day.
[1:15:42] I remember I just started preaching a
[1:15:45] little bit and I was invited to go to a
[1:15:46] city and in the city this pastor had
[1:15:49] several nights of meetings. Well, I was
[1:15:52] scheduled to preach at least two maybe
[1:15:54] three services and I got my little Bible
[1:15:56] and my quotes and my notes and my little
[1:15:59] anointing and my little gift all ready
[1:16:02] to preach. And then lo and behold, a
[1:16:05] visiting evangelist more gifted than I
[1:16:09] shows up. And man, I wasn't happy to see
[1:16:12] this brother. I knew him. I loved him. I
[1:16:16] pretend like I was happy to see him, but
[1:16:18] I was not happy to see him.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Cuz he's taking some of my
[1:16:23] time. Taking my preaching time. But not
[1:16:26] thinking that it is not your preaching
[1:16:29] time.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; These are not your meetings.
[1:16:32] This is not your YOU ACTUALLY YOU DON'T
[1:16:34] HAVE A CHURCH.
[1:16:36] YOU HAVE NOTHING BUT WHAT I GAVE you to
[1:16:39] edify
[1:16:42] somebody, ANYBODY, AT ANY TIME I CHOOSE
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; to use you.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; So the brother came in and and he
[1:16:56] preached, did a great job. He did such a
[1:16:59] great job I had to say amen.
[1:17:03] I really did. I just say, "Amen, man." I
[1:17:05] said, "Boy, I can preach now."
[1:17:09] And I went in and went went through the
[1:17:11] meetings and the Lord showed me a good
[1:17:12] lesson there. And at the end of the
[1:17:14] meeting, the brother looked over me. He
[1:17:16] said, "Brother Israel, I just jumped in
[1:17:18] here. I'm sorry. Here's the little
[1:17:20] offering that they gave me. I didn't
[1:17:22] come for that. And I know you drew drove
[1:17:25] further here. Take this little
[1:17:27] offering." And I, you know, I learned a
[1:17:30] great lesson through that lesson.
[1:17:33] You see, the Lord showed me some time
[1:17:37] after that
[1:17:40] that in when it comes to special
[1:17:42] meetings, I don't have to be a speaker
[1:17:46] in order to influence that meeting.
[1:17:51] I don't have to be on the first night,
[1:17:53] second night, third night, or any night
[1:17:55] at all. If God wants me to be an
[1:17:58] edification,
[1:18:00] he can use me
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; in the parking lot.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what we want anyway?
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; We want to be edifying to the body of
[1:18:12] Christ.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; God help us. So, we can misuse this gift
[1:18:19] and we can miss it many times. I
[1:18:22] mentioned a quote to you all. I asked
[1:18:23] Levi to find it for me. he couldn't find
[1:18:25] it.
[1:18:27] the dad found it
[1:18:29] and it's in the message um
[1:18:33] where brother Anna was talking about he
[1:18:35] took this gift and he was challenging
[1:18:39] it's paragraph 13 in the message and I'm
[1:18:43] going close with this quote the angel in
[1:18:45] in his convention 1950
[1:18:49] he says this Here.
[1:19:35] and Jesus in this case neither that the
[1:19:39] works of God might be known. Now you
[1:19:43] have to know those things. That's why on
[1:19:45] each case I examine it real closely. I
[1:19:49] know right where I'm standing. And if I
[1:19:51] ask once and it doesn't leave, then I'll
[1:19:54] check closely.
[1:19:57] Then if I don't see nothing, I'll leave
[1:20:00] it alone till God shows me what to do.
[1:20:03] Have to watch that thing because there
[1:20:05] might be something put on that person.
[1:20:08] God intended to be there to bring them
[1:20:11] to a certain thing. You come right back
[1:20:14] around and take that thing off what God
[1:20:16] put on. Look where you stand before God.
[1:20:20] And if God's endued you with something
[1:20:22] to do something, you have to watch.
[1:20:25] Therefore, brothers, their divine gift.
[1:20:28] I have said this, many of my managers
[1:20:30] and things know this true. When I first
[1:20:33] started, I was so elated with it till I
[1:20:36] would go into a city and call a meeting.
[1:20:38] might say, "You go to the city and bring
[1:20:40] me. Let the ministers or somebody bring
[1:20:43] me somebody that they know is crippled
[1:20:46] or afflicted. Let me have that person
[1:20:49] and I'll assure you that person will be
[1:20:51] healed for I'm through." And I made
[1:20:54] challenges like that. I went into
[1:20:57] Phoenix one time. I made a challenge and
[1:20:59] they brought a little crippled Mexican
[1:21:01] girl. Oh, she was horribly. An hour and
[1:21:05] 45 minutes I had that child on the
[1:21:08] platform. Just held it. Stayed right
[1:21:11] with it. Pled to let that God would let
[1:21:14] the baby loose. Come loose. The baby
[1:21:17] come loose. Went around, walked down off
[1:21:20] the platform there, walked down and come
[1:21:22] back again. And I remember at Vanelia,
[1:21:25] Illinois where I seen the great, one of
[1:21:28] the greatest I've ever seen a meeting. I
[1:21:30] said the same thing. I said, "You go get
[1:21:33] a person and bring them to me." They
[1:21:35] did. A boy brought born blind about 15
[1:21:38] years old. I stayed right with the boy,
[1:21:41] stayed right there until that boy
[1:21:43] received his sight. And after I did
[1:21:46] that, taking the time where hundreds
[1:21:49] were setting to be prayed for, but put
[1:21:52] all the time on that one boy.
[1:21:55] After I heard him screaming, he come
[1:21:57] back. He was wandering through the
[1:21:58] crowd. He come back. He said, "I told my
[1:22:00] mother I wanted to see what the man
[1:22:02] looked like that opened my eyes." I
[1:22:04] said, "I hope you see him someday, the
[1:22:06] Lord Jesus Christ." So he took a hold of
[1:22:09] my tie. He said, "Mother,"
[1:22:12] I had on a striped tie. He said, "Is
[1:22:13] that the colored things there? Is that
[1:22:16] what you call stripes?" All of them
[1:22:18] crying. He says, "Now, what color would
[1:22:20] you call that suit?" That's why what
[1:22:23] they call lights. Born blind, never seen
[1:22:25] in his life. A lot of people fainting
[1:22:28] everywhere. went to the hotel that
[1:22:30] night. My brother Donnie, my little son
[1:22:32] Billy, they went into the hotel. It was
[1:22:35] about 2 o'clock in the morning. I was
[1:22:37] laying down sleeping. I just went to
[1:22:39] sleep, which I don't sleep very much at
[1:22:41] night. Always in prayer. Nighttime when
[1:22:44] all demon power shut down towards
[1:22:46] morning when they're not roaming. That's
[1:22:48] the time the Holy Spirit moves in and
[1:22:50] talks to me. Go early. Go early if you
[1:22:54] want to pray.
[1:22:56] So like 5:00 Saturday morning. How about
[1:22:59] that?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Go early. If you want to pray, rise up
[1:23:03] early. Most of the workers is gone.
[1:23:06] Demons, demons, and places are closing
[1:23:09] up. That causes strange things. You know
[1:23:11] what I mean by that? Notice I was laying
[1:23:13] there as I woke waking up all at once.
[1:23:16] And I looked and I thought,
[1:23:19] "Oh my,
[1:23:25] wait a minute. The window's back there.
[1:23:26] That's the side of the wall." I looked
[1:23:28] again. It was a white cloud milling like
[1:23:30] this. Said, "Oh, I see. It was the angel
[1:23:32] of the Lord coming in the room." Many
[1:23:35] times demons has followed me in the
[1:23:37] room. I felt their flesh rubbing me and
[1:23:41] bells and things went haunt at me half
[1:23:44] the night nearly. Then I get out of the
[1:23:46] bed and knelt down and note it was a
[1:23:49] spirit. But I had to find out just what
[1:23:51] it was first. I kept waiting and I felt
[1:23:53] it come around the bed. It come you
[1:23:56] could feel it. I say I'm talking to you
[1:23:59] from my heart. I don't feel it now.
[1:24:02] Sometimes I feel it. So, brother Vanam
[1:24:04] continues on and he says this here,
[1:24:06] paragraph 21.
[1:24:09] Now, when I looked and seen that, I got
[1:24:11] down on the floor and started praying.
[1:24:13] And as it got closer, I knew it was the
[1:24:16] angel of God. And I can feel what it
[1:24:19] was. And I said, "What does the Lord
[1:24:21] want me to do?" Never said a thing. Just
[1:24:23] a long time was standing right near the
[1:24:26] foot of the bed. And I was kneeling like
[1:24:27] this. And I said, "Oh, heavenly father,
[1:24:30] what have you sent your angel to your
[1:24:31] servant for?" And I said, "Your servant
[1:24:34] is listening." And I waited. And I knew
[1:24:37] it was still there, but I didn't know
[1:24:39] why. I waited, I guess, five minutes
[1:24:42] passed. I felt it moving closer to me.
[1:24:45] And when it did, I just heard that voice
[1:24:47] sound like way back. I could not
[1:24:49] impersonate that voice if I had to, but
[1:24:52] I heard it just as plain and audible as
[1:24:55] my voice is to you said, "You're
[1:24:58] confining too much of that. You're
[1:25:01] you're confining too much of that gift
[1:25:04] of healing to perform miracles. It will
[1:25:08] come to pass that people will not
[1:25:10] believe you unless there's a miracle
[1:25:13] performed." I said, "I shall never do
[1:25:16] that again. So help me. God went out of
[1:25:19] the room. Amen.
[1:25:21] And so what does that tell us? That the
[1:25:25] emphasis isn't on the gifts. The
[1:25:28] emphasis is on the word.
[1:25:32] And they lean on the gift. Show me a
[1:25:35] vision. Give me a mystery. Reveal it to
[1:25:37] me. Lean on the gift. Lean on the gift.
[1:25:38] Lean on the gift. And the gifts should
[1:25:41] be pointing all of us to the word.
[1:25:45] That's what the presence of the Lord
[1:25:46] does. Now, gifts are minor. I'll read
[1:25:49] one last quote and then
[1:25:52] I'll
[1:25:53] close. Works as faith expressed 1965.
[1:25:59] Prophet of God says this here,
[1:26:03] paragraph 99. Well, that's the same
[1:26:04] thing with preaching divine healing or
[1:26:06] anything else. As you go along, you
[1:26:08] begin to learn. If you don't learn,
[1:26:11] there's something wrong. You see, you've
[1:26:14] got to learn, you've got to learn how to
[1:26:16] accept God and what it really means. We
[1:26:18] allow it sometimes and say, "Well, this
[1:26:20] guy didn't have enough faith. This guy
[1:26:22] didn't do this, that." There's a reason
[1:26:24] there for that. There's a reason.
[1:26:26] Sometimes it's unconfessed sin. You
[1:26:29] could pour a gallon of oil on a person
[1:26:31] and scream till you got horse. It would
[1:26:33] never move that devil. No sir. You've
[1:26:35] got to confess that that's what
[1:26:37] discernment does. Go make that right.
[1:26:39] Bring that out. But it's so slow doing
[1:26:42] that scene and the rest of them get
[1:26:44] impatient and they say, "Ah, I never got
[1:26:46] prayed for." Well, we want to find a way
[1:26:49] now that what takes place that real
[1:26:52] basic of divine healing. Now, a gift,
[1:26:56] just like I said last night, a gift is a
[1:26:59] wonderful, a gift is wonderful, but you
[1:27:02] can't base your eternal destination on
[1:27:05] gifts. You can't major on a minor. And a
[1:27:09] gift is a minor. And Satan can
[1:27:13] impersonate any gift of God that God's
[1:27:17] got. He can make something just exactly
[1:27:20] like it. See, exactly. Therefore, we got
[1:27:24] to watch.
[1:27:26] So, God bless you richly. We thank God
[1:27:29] for his word.
[1:27:31] 1 Peter 4:101
[1:27:33] says, "As every man hath received the
[1:27:37] gift, even so minister the same one to
[1:27:43] another, as good stewards of the
[1:27:46] manifold grace of God. If any man speak,
[1:27:48] let him speak as the oracles of God. If
[1:27:51] any man minister, let him do it as uh
[1:27:54] the ability which God giveth, that God
[1:27:58] in all things may be what?
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Glorified through Jesus Christ. To him
[1:28:07] be praise, dominion forever and ever.
[1:28:13] Amen.
[1:28:14] I wonder if some of our great sermons
[1:28:17] that we preach and the anointing comes
[1:28:20] on us so well, us preachers, and we have
[1:28:23] such a great service. I wonder how much
[1:28:26] glory is going to the man and how much
[1:28:30] is really going to the Lord Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ. I wonder when our songs come
[1:28:35] forth and we sing those and the
[1:28:38] anointing comes down. I wonder if we're
[1:28:40] feeling that glory or if that glory
[1:28:43] going to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:45] Everything that we do should be the
[1:28:47] edification of the body of Christ. Amen.
[1:28:51] God bless you saints. God bless you
[1:28:54] richly. Amen. So we will
[1:28:59] turn our heart and our attention to the
[1:29:02] table of the Lord.
[1:29:05] And if you would be kind to uh take your
[1:29:08] Bibles and turn with me in 1 Corinthians
[1:29:11] chapter 11
[1:29:44] Scripture tells us
[1:29:56] and verse 23. You have that?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] says,"For I have received of the Lord
[1:30:04] that which also I delivered unto you,
[1:30:07] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:30:09] which he was betrayed, took bread." And
[1:30:12] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[1:30:14] and said, "Take, eat. This is my body
[1:30:17] which is broken for you. This do in
[1:30:20] remembrance of me." After the same
[1:30:22] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:30:24] sucked, saying, "This cup is the new
[1:30:27] testament in my blood. This do ye as
[1:30:30] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[1:30:33] me. For as often as you eat this bread
[1:30:35] and drink this cup, you do show the
[1:30:37] Lord's death till he come. Wherefore
[1:30:40] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:30:42] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:30:45] guilty of the body and blood of the
[1:30:47] Lord. But let a man examine himself, and
[1:30:50] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:30:52] of that cup. For he that eateth and
[1:30:55] drinkketh unworthily eateth and
[1:30:58] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[1:31:00] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[1:31:03] cause many are weak and sickly among
[1:31:04] you, and many sleep. For if we would
[1:31:09] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:31:12] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:31:15] chasened of the Lord that we should not
[1:31:18] be condemned with the world. Wherefore,
[1:31:20] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:31:22] eat, tear one for the for another, and
[1:31:26] if any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[1:31:28] that you come not together unto
[1:31:30] condemnation. And the rest will I set in
[1:31:33] order when I come. There was two prayer
[1:31:37] requests that I meant to mention to you.
[1:31:42] Um
[1:31:43] Doug Wilson, he sent in a request for
[1:31:47] some lady friend of his, Anna and Stacy
[1:31:51] Haney. They both have COVID. And then
[1:31:54] also Julie Carpenter, she called some
[1:31:57] time ago, sent me an email rather, that
[1:32:00] they're testing her for cancer. That's
[1:32:04] one of brother Carpenters's
[1:32:06] nieces. And so will we remember them in
[1:32:10] prayer, but then let's in silent prayer
[1:32:12] pray for you. I'll pray for you, you
[1:32:14] pray for me, and let's pray for one
[1:32:17] another.
[1:32:54] Amen. Heavenly Father, in my hands I
[1:32:58] hold the bread that was made for this
[1:32:59] service, Lord. It's unleavened
[1:33:03] and it's a type of your word, Lord. is
[1:33:06] top of your body that was broken for us.
[1:33:10] Lord, we know it is not your body. It
[1:33:12] represents your body, but we bless it
[1:33:15] for this service. And may each one
[1:33:17] partake that partakes of it, may they
[1:33:20] receive the blessings that comes with
[1:33:22] being in full obedience to your word is
[1:33:25] my prayer in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:33:34] Heavenly Father, in my hands I hold
[1:33:38] the cup, the new testament of your
[1:33:40] blood, Lord.
[1:33:42] It is the blood of the grapes that was
[1:33:45] shed for this service, Lord, for this
[1:33:49] purpose. Lord, may each one that partake
[1:33:52] of it, Lord, may they receive the
[1:33:55] healing,
[1:33:57] oh God, and the overcoming power that
[1:33:59] comes as we know that healing is in the
[1:34:02] cup tonight.
[1:34:04] We know that it represents,
[1:34:07] oh God, the oil and wine, the Holy
[1:34:10] Spirit, the revelation,
[1:34:13] all those things, Lord, that this
[1:34:16] natural
[1:34:17] wine types spiritually.
[1:34:20] Oh father, bless it for this service.
[1:34:23] Bless each one that partakes. In Jesus
[1:34:26] name we pray. Amen. Bless you. You may
[1:34:29] be seated. You can follow the directions
[1:34:32] of the ushers.
[1:36:05] Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] Heat. Heat.
[1:42:23] Hallelujah.
[1:46:24] Happy.
[1:48:34] the bread that remains for we burnt with
[1:48:36] fire before the rising of the sun. Let
[1:48:39] us all stand and take our Bibles.
[1:48:48] St. John chapter 13.
[1:48:53] Verse
[1:48:58] number two.
[1:49:03] Supper being ended.
[1:49:08] The devil how me now put into the heart
[1:49:10] of Judas the Scariot Simon's son to
[1:49:12] betray him. Jesus knowing that the
[1:49:15] father had given all things into his
[1:49:17] hands that he was come from God and he
[1:49:19] went to God. He riseth from supper, laid
[1:49:23] aside his garments, and took a towel and
[1:49:25] girded himself. After that, he pth water
[1:49:28] into a basin, and begin to wash the
[1:49:31] disciples feet, to wipe them with the
[1:49:33] towel wherewith he was girded. Then
[1:49:35] cometh he to Simon Peter. Peter saith
[1:49:38] unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet?
[1:49:42] Jesus answered and said unto him, What I
[1:49:44] do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:49:47] know hereafter. Peter said unto him,
[1:49:50] "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[1:49:53] answered him, "If I wash thee not the
[1:49:56] house, no part with me." Simon Peter
[1:49:59] saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only,
[1:50:03] but also my hands and my head. And Jesus
[1:50:06] said to him, he that is washed needeth
[1:50:08] not saved to wash his feet, but is clean
[1:50:12] every wit. And you're clean, but not
[1:50:14] all. For he knew who should betray him.
[1:50:18] Therefore said he, ye are not all clean.
[1:50:22] So after he had washed their feet, and
[1:50:24] had taken his garment, and was set down
[1:50:26] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:50:29] I have done to you. You call me Master
[1:50:33] and Lord, and you say, "Well, for so I
[1:50:36] am." If I then, your Lord and Master,
[1:50:38] have washed your feet, you also ought to
[1:50:41] wash one another's feet. For I have
[1:50:44] given you an example that you should do
[1:50:46] as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I
[1:50:50] say unto you, the servant is not greater
[1:50:52] than his Lord, neither he that is sent
[1:50:54] greater than he that sent him. If you
[1:50:57] know these things, happy are ye if you
[1:51:00] do them. Amen. And we're so happy to do
[1:51:03] them tonight.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; We're happy to wash one another's feet.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. We thank God for his goodness to
[1:51:11] us. And let's sing a little bit of that.
[1:51:15] Thank God I'm free, free, free from all
[1:51:18] sin.
[1:51:20] For a long time I traveled
[1:51:24] down the long, lonely road.
[1:51:29] My heart was so heavy. Then I sank.
[1:51:35] Oh.
[1:51:37] Then I heard about Jesus.
[1:51:42] What a wonderful hour.
[1:51:47] I'm so glad
[1:51:50] he could bring me out his saving power.
[1:51:56] Oh, thank God I am bring
