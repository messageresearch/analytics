[36:47] specials very very nice always good to
[36:50] hear that singing we'd like to go into
[36:53] the word just for a few moments and um
[36:56] ask you to stand turn your Bibles into
[37:00] St Mark chapter
[37:07] 7 talk about this approach just a little
[37:20] bit in verse number 24
[37:28] and from then he rose and went into the
[37:31] borders with Tyrie and sidon and entered
[37:34] into a home and would have no man know
[37:37] it but he could not be hid for a certain
[37:40] woman whose daughter had an unclean
[37:43] Spirit heard of him and came and fell at
[37:46] his feet the woman was a Greek sosian by
[37:51] nation and she besought him that he
[37:53] would cast forth the devil out of her
[37:56] daughter
[37:58] but Jesus said unto her let the children
[38:01] first be filled for it is not me to take
[38:04] the children's bread and to cast it unto
[38:07] the
[38:08] dogs and she said she answered and said
[38:11] unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the
[38:16] table eat of the children's
[38:18] crumbs and he said unto her for this
[38:22] saying go thy
[38:24] way the devil is gone out of thy
[38:27] daughter and when she was come to her
[38:30] house she found the devil gone out and
[38:33] her daughter laid upon the bed amen amen
[38:37] we'll take one more scripture in Romans
[38:39] chapter 8
[39:00] I think verse 30 is what I want but
[39:02] let's take verse
[39:05] 28 and we know that all things work
[39:08] together for good to them that love God
[39:12] to them who are the called according to
[39:15] his purpose for whom we did for
[39:19] know he also did predestinate to be
[39:22] conformed to the image of his son that
[39:25] he might be the first born among many
[39:28] Brethren moreover whom he did
[39:31] predestinate them he also called whom he
[39:34] called then he also Justified whom he
[39:38] justified them he also glorified what
[39:42] shall we then say to these things if God
[39:47] be for us who can be against us isn't
[39:50] that nice amen may God add a blessing to
[39:53] the reading of his word it always
[39:55] encourages us when we read seated amen
[39:58] you may be seated we're going talk about
[40:00] approach just a little bit as this
[40:02] morning talking how the blood speaks and
[40:05] here this little woman had a
[40:09] daughter and she had a devil an evil or
[40:15] an unclean Spirit as the Bible calls it
[40:18] and this unclean
[40:19] Spirit um no doubt did what unclean
[40:24] things
[40:25] do it causes troubles it causes problems
[40:29] the evil spirit is not um it's not
[40:34] something any of us desire or want but
[40:36] we have to fight through them and we've
[40:38] had all of us have had evil spirits and
[40:42] that's why we need to be born again by
[40:45] the Holy Spirit to take that evil spirit
[40:48] out of us and it's a shame that many
[40:51] people don't realize or recognize that
[40:53] they need to be born again they think
[40:56] because they didn't do any wrong they
[40:58] didn't commit any crimes that we call
[41:02] Big sins or great sins that um that
[41:06] they're okay I'm not bothering anyone I
[41:08] didn't hurt anyone I'm not stealing I
[41:11] didn't physically hurt
[41:13] anyone but every man needs to be born
[41:16] again and when you can look in the word
[41:19] and you can see God as your healer and
[41:22] you can see him as a deliverer you can
[41:24] see him through the Old Testament and
[41:26] the Great Signs
[41:27] wonders and miracles you'll see all
[41:29] those things in there and if you'll keep
[41:31] looking you you'll see yourself in there
[41:35] and when you see yourself you'll see
[41:37] your
[41:38] sin and you'll see how black your sin is
[41:41] and that's what the word of the Lord
[41:42] turns the light on on how dark your sin
[41:46] is and then when you can see that you're
[41:48] a sinner and then you can see Calvary
[41:51] that somebody saved you then it's all
[41:54] over then but you got to see that that
[41:58] and you have to recognize God is not
[42:00] going to repent for you or me repentance
[42:03] is something that you have to do and um
[42:06] we'll see as we grow closer to the Lord
[42:09] that that repentance it develops even
[42:12] greater and greater the sins get heavier
[42:16] and heavier and you could get by with
[42:20] doing things and no one in the church no
[42:23] one in the entire world would ever know
[42:26] that you were even guilty but God would
[42:29] know it and then your conscience would
[42:33] know it and then you'd have to make that
[42:35] right amen and so this woman had a
[42:39] tremendous problem and she brought this
[42:42] brought this problem to the right person
[42:45] and the right person we know is the Lord
[42:48] Jesus Christ brought him brought her she
[42:52] comes into the presence of the Lord
[42:54] Jesus and She lays out her reest Quest
[42:58] and calls on him
[43:01] Lord um she first calls him son of David
[43:06] have mercy on
[43:08] me she was a Greek she was of a
[43:12] different Nation they had some strict
[43:14] laws and boundaries there that they
[43:17] didn't they didn't cross up the Jews or
[43:19] the Hebrews were very strict on who they
[43:22] ate with who they were seen with what
[43:25] house they would go into and here this
[43:27] woman is a Greek um an unclean Nation by
[43:34] title when God Called Moses and the
[43:37] children of Israel out of Egypt he told
[43:39] him not to be partaker with the the evil
[43:42] Nations and all their unbelief and
[43:44] things that they did and here she is an
[43:47] outsider she is not one of the end group
[43:52] looks like she wasn't even
[43:55] invited but she presses her way to get
[43:57] to the right person and the right person
[44:01] is the Lord Jesus and you know when you
[44:04] get into his presence he just might
[44:07] throw a test your way he loves to test
[44:11] he he loves to test test faith and we
[44:15] would think that you know a woman like
[44:18] this or a visitor coming and outset her
[44:20] we would make everything comfortable for
[44:23] her and for this Outsider so there was
[44:26] no nobody would say anything to offend
[44:29] her so she couldn't turn away and put a
[44:32] bad name upon the group that wasn't the
[44:34] case at all she comes in the presence of
[44:37] the right man the right group where the
[44:40] healing was taking place she heard about
[44:42] it and she got a utter rebuke now I
[44:47] don't know how many church members the
[44:50] ones that I've come across and even
[44:52] myself even myself look at yourself and
[44:55] say even myself how many church members
[44:58] can deal with what this little woman
[45:01] dealt with we are so touchy and fickle
[45:05] that can't nobody even look at us wrong
[45:08] before we leave out of a place offended
[45:11] and people that you know love you too
[45:15] let alone strangers coming into a place
[45:18] looking for some
[45:20] help uh to for her not it's not for me
[45:24] it's for my daughter she got a devil I
[45:26] heard heard others were getting touched
[45:28] and healed can I get a can I get a slice
[45:31] of that can I get a touch of that can I
[45:33] get a piece of that and he called her
[45:36] and her people a
[45:42] dog that had to hurt wasn't expecting
[45:45] that not from the Lord Jesus not from
[45:49] the master the Healer he calls her and
[45:53] her people a dog put yourself in her
[45:56] shoes some of us are looking for
[45:57] somebody to do something to us so that
[46:00] we can have a reason to walk around with
[46:02] an attitude but she's not playing Church
[46:05] she's not playing games she just wants
[46:09] results I I if you gonna call me a dog
[46:12] and my daughter get healed call me a dog
[46:14] that's fine I want my daughter to be
[46:16] healed that's what I'm here for and I'm
[46:19] here to hear the word of the Lord I'm
[46:22] not here it be nice to make more friends
[46:23] but I might not make more friends but if
[46:26] I don't make make more friends and
[46:27] people don't like me but I can still
[46:29] hear the word of the Lord thank you Lord
[46:32] Jesus I want to hear his
[46:35] word so this is the approach that got
[46:39] her that moved her into a next level of
[46:44] rare people rare Believers rare comers
[46:49] and she now is getting Jesus's attention
[46:52] you know everybody most people could
[46:54] have walked away but not her
[46:57] she stays right with it and she makes a
[47:00] statement Jesus drops a statement then
[47:02] she makes a statement what do she say
[47:06] she didn't argue with him didn't
[47:08] disagree with him didn't try to prove
[47:11] her Point really really we're not that
[47:13] dirty we're kind of clean Lord she
[47:15] didn't come like that or none and she
[47:16] said what she
[47:18] say you got me Lord that's
[47:21] true but even the dogs you created them
[47:25] too
[47:27] they got to eat
[47:29] too even the dogs eat from the master's
[47:32] table can I get a crumb
[47:35] Lord and these words caught Jesus and he
[47:41] said for this say he didn't pray for her
[47:44] he didn't go see her daughter he just
[47:46] said for this saying that devil has left
[47:51] your daughter brother banam goes further
[47:54] and tells us so say right things say say
[47:57] good things as we said this morning
[47:59] speak better things because your words
[48:02] really mean something and there are
[48:05] confession let's take a few messages
[48:07] here brother Ram talks about the
[48:09] approach to any Divine
[48:13] gift and paragraph number 81 just above
[48:16] it a little bit paragraph 80 says right
[48:18] out of the city I can hear some of them
[48:21] saying now look where are you going now
[48:23] she pushed on by them old critics went
[48:27] right on out Jesus hadn't gotten town
[48:30] yet and she got to where he
[48:32] was this is talking about Mary and
[48:35] Martha now watch look like she would
[48:37] have had a right to abraid him look like
[48:40] she'd had a right to scold him and say
[48:43] why didn't you come Oh I thought you
[48:45] could heal if she would the miracle
[48:48] would have have never taken place it's
[48:52] your approach to a Divine gift what br
[48:56] brings the results it's the way you come
[49:00] to it isn't that right the way you
[49:03] approach
[49:05] anything she come in the right approach
[49:07] she came out she fell down on her knees
[49:10] she said Lord did didn't this regard his
[49:13] T title Lord if thou would have been
[49:16] here my brother had not died oh my that
[49:20] touched him she knew if she could get
[49:23] right into his heart she'd get what she
[49:25] wanted said Lord if if thou would have
[49:27] been here my brother would not have died
[49:30] but even now Lord whatever you ask God
[49:33] God will do it I like that even now Lord
[49:37] he's dead he's been buried four days
[49:39] Undertakers Tak have taken him out there
[49:42] and in bombed his body put him away he's
[49:45] been dead four days and he's just
[49:47] mortifying in the earth there but even
[49:50] now whatever you ask God God will do it
[49:54] so let's look at that just a moment and
[49:56] St John chapter
[49:58] 11 the
[49:59] gospel the ministry of the Lord Jesus is
[50:02] here St John
[50:06] 11 saw how he dealt dealt with this
[50:09] woman and her daughter and these are two
[50:11] of his friends Mary and
[50:14] Martha verse number five verse number
[50:18] four and uh St John 11 when Jesus heard
[50:23] that he uh when Jesus had heard that he
[50:27] said this sickness is not unto death but
[50:30] for the glory of God that the Son of God
[50:33] might be glorified thereby now Jesus
[50:35] loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus
[50:39] and when he had heard therefore that he
[50:40] was sick he Abode two days still in the
[50:43] same place where he was then after that
[50:47] saith he to his disciples let us go in
[50:51] Judea again his disciples say unto him
[50:54] Master the Jews of late sought to Stone
[50:57] thee there and goest thou thither again
[50:59] Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in
[51:02] the day if any man walk in the day he
[51:04] stumbleth not because he seeth the light
[51:07] of this world but if a man walk in the
[51:09] night he stumbleth because there is no
[51:12] light in
[51:14] him these things said he and after that
[51:17] he said unto them our friend Lazareth
[51:20] sleepeth but I go that I might awake him
[51:23] out of his sleep his disciples said Lord
[51:27] if he sleep he doeth well so they didn't
[51:30] understand and so here he is he waits a
[51:32] few days uh Lazarus is now dead and
[51:36] verse number
[51:39] 23 verse number 19 will
[51:43] say many of the Jews came to Martha and
[51:47] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[51:48] brother then Martha as soon as she heard
[51:51] that Jesus was coming went and met him
[51:54] but Mary sat still in their house then
[51:57] said Marthur unto jesuslord if thou had
[52:00] been here my brother had not died but I
[52:04] know that even now whatsoever thou will
[52:07] ask of God God will give it thee now I
[52:11] want you to think about where this this
[52:14] little sister her brother is dead now
[52:16] it's been four days that that they
[52:19] already uh buried him and bombed him
[52:22] they've already had the memorial and
[52:24] everything and Jesus finally shows up
[52:27] and look at her attitude her attitude
[52:30] was Lord if you'd have been here when my
[52:34] brother was sick when we was calling for
[52:36] you when there was still a hope a chance
[52:40] if you'd have been here my brother would
[52:41] not have died that's a beautiful
[52:44] compliment that's a lot of Faith Lord if
[52:46] you was here this none of this craziness
[52:49] would have happened but he's dead now
[52:51] but even now Lord whatever you say God
[52:56] will do it now this moves God these kind
[52:59] of words these little exercises of faith
[53:04] when the bad news has come and things
[53:07] undesirable has come your way and it
[53:09] looks like the finality of whatever
[53:12] you're trying to accomplish look like
[53:14] it's over with there's no hope it uh
[53:18] it's too late I I can't see it happening
[53:22] that's still you still got a hope sis
[53:24] you still got a hope my brother to to
[53:27] speak the right thing to keep the right
[53:30] right attitude all at all times just
[53:32] keep the right attitude because the
[53:34] right attitude is how we approach any
[53:37] Divine gift with the right attitude will
[53:40] determine the results that you get from
[53:42] it and this is a hopeless case one is
[53:46] this woman is outside of the race of the
[53:49] Hebrews of the Jews and here is a woman
[53:53] whose brother is dead for 4 days now but
[53:56] but see they their approach was correct
[53:58] because their attitude was right and the
[54:01] reason why you walk upon on people the
[54:02] way you do is because your attitude
[54:04] isn't right and if your attitude is
[54:06] right then your approach will be
[54:09] right your attitude is the way you think
[54:12] is what's going on up here is what's
[54:14] going on in your heart that's your
[54:16] attitude you drive with it you ride with
[54:18] it and then finally you come in contact
[54:20] with the situation then we see what your
[54:23] attitude is by your approach approach
[54:27] and the approach that these two women
[54:30] had or these two cases had just
[54:33] beautiful lovely so we'll continue here
[54:36] in the message uh the ministry of Christ
[54:39] paragraph 61 brother bam says
[54:45] this speaking of this about Martha again
[54:48] Mary and
[54:50] Martha she just pressed right on through
[54:53] never paid any attention she got out to
[54:55] where Jesus was now naturally she had a
[54:58] right to up braid
[55:00] him look like why didn't you come to my
[55:03] brother listen close why didn't you come
[55:06] when we called
[55:08] you we know you saw my text message why
[55:12] didn't you answer it when I sent
[55:15] it let me get back to the quote here why
[55:18] didn't you come when I when we called
[55:20] you now we left the church we left
[55:23] everything we left our priests we went
[55:25] against his will we we kept we kept you
[55:28] in our home we paid you out of our money
[55:31] we fed you with our food we give you
[55:33] clothes and when my brother was sick we
[55:36] sinned for you and you turned your back
[55:39] on us and went away every bit of that
[55:42] would have been truth but brother let me
[55:45] tell you something now it's your
[55:47] attitude towards any Divine gift your
[55:51] approach to that attitude determines
[55:54] what you're going to get out of of it
[55:57] you just come to God in the wrong way
[56:00] Jesus just come walking into the city
[56:02] but she didn't do that she ran out to
[56:04] him she fell down at his feet she says
[56:07] Lord that's what he was Lord if thou
[56:10] would have been here my brother would
[56:12] not have
[56:12] died amen and the message continuing for
[56:16] the
[56:18] faith paragraph three the prophet says
[56:21] this I just want to read a couple of
[56:22] these he is the same Lord Jesus you
[56:26] notice in his ministry he only raised
[56:28] three from the dead in his ministry here
[56:31] on Earth he raised jeras his daughter
[56:33] the woman son that was buried Lazarus 3
[56:36] is a confirmation he could have done
[56:38] more if the father would have showed him
[56:40] now let us be reverent as and let us
[56:43] take the right attitude towards the Lord
[56:46] Jesus for be it assured that your
[56:49] attitude towards any any Divine gift
[56:54] will determine what what results you get
[56:58] from it
[57:01] amen
[57:04] now amen so God bless you
[57:08] richly let's take this last one this is
[57:12] with this woman that had this daughter
[57:15] with the
[57:16] devil in the message persever in
[57:19] 1964 paragraph
[57:22] 111 the prophet of God says she said
[57:25] truth Lord but the dogs can eat the
[57:27] crumbs that's under the children's table
[57:30] that's got it that got it she was not a
[57:33] hot house plant she was not a hybrid
[57:37] Bunch so-called Believers that we have
[57:40] the crop of today she had genuine Faith
[57:45] she admitted he was right but she wasn't
[57:48] after even all the bread that the
[57:51] children can eat she just searching for
[57:54] crumbs we either get the yes or we don't
[57:57] have any at all we'll walk away from it
[58:00] and then say we got faith they don't
[58:02] treat me right I'll walk out that's no
[58:05] faith that's not faith faith is there
[58:09] what am I trying to say to you friends
[58:11] we're going to have a prayer line here
[58:13] one of these nights and I want to see
[58:15] not one stretcher one wheelchair one
[58:18] crutch or nothing but what's laying here
[58:21] on the floor and them walking on out see
[58:24] unless you come with the right kind of
[58:26] of approach you're not going to get
[58:29] anything that's right you're just
[58:31] walking right through somebody slapping
[58:34] a hand on you and going on out that's no
[58:36] good you've got to know what you're come
[58:39] he that cometh to God Must Believe now
[58:42] watch remember she had never seen a
[58:45] miracle she was a Greek she was a
[58:47] gentile she had never seen a miracle yet
[58:50] she had faith that there was such a
[58:51] thing year after year day after day we
[58:54] see Miracles and just can't hold on an
[58:57] hour or two she was like the Rahab
[59:01] Harlot Rahab the Harlot Rahab didn't
[59:04] want the Gentile woman she didn't want
[59:06] to see how Joshua wore his clothes or
[59:09] see how Joshua I have heard and I
[59:12] believe that's all she heard and she
[59:15] believed Jesus said for this saying she
[59:19] had the right approach to the gift of
[59:22] God remember she was the first Gentile
[59:24] that a Miracles ever performed on
[59:27] because of her faith faith admits the
[59:31] word is Right humbles itself same as it
[59:35] does today
[59:38] amen so we know that Faith admits that
[59:43] the word is right and then there is our
[59:46] approach to that Divine gift any Divine
[59:50] gift now here's a few quotes I had put
[59:53] together I've had them for some time
[59:55] several months
[59:56] and I've never printed them out I had
[59:58] them together I think I've quoted it
[1:00:01] maybe once or twice but here's a series
[1:00:04] of quotes where brother bandam is in a
[1:00:06] prayer line or dealing with the gift of
[1:00:09] God in his life and he catches people
[1:00:12] off guard and and pronounces their
[1:00:15] healing and then tells them that they
[1:00:18] had more faith than they perhaps
[1:00:21] realized and how many of us have more
[1:00:25] faith then we realize our minds we might
[1:00:28] say things that we shouldn't say but if
[1:00:30] you're Bel a Believer then you have
[1:00:34] faith you have to have faith if you're a
[1:00:37] Believer can I get one witness how many
[1:00:41] Believers here tonight if you are a
[1:00:44] Believer you have faith don't let the
[1:00:48] devil or anything contrary tell you
[1:00:50] anything different I am a Christian I
[1:00:53] have faith I have faith in the God that
[1:00:56] I serve and my faith is the power that
[1:01:00] pleases the Lord without faith it's
[1:01:02] impossible to please him so as a
[1:01:04] Believer I have the faith and sometimes
[1:01:06] it's laying there sometimes it seems
[1:01:08] quiet sometimes we don't see it like we
[1:01:10] want but it's there and brother random
[1:01:12] brings it out in this message here Jesus
[1:01:16] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:01:17] forever 1962 he says if God will tell me
[1:01:21] what your
[1:01:23] need move up just a little bit he says
[1:01:25] now see see the way you get to a gift
[1:01:29] it's your it's your approach to it one
[1:01:33] time when Jesus was talking to the
[1:01:35] people a woman touched His Garment she
[1:01:37] felt virtue but a w a Roman soldier put
[1:01:40] a rag on his head and hit him on the
[1:01:42] head and said if you can see Visions or
[1:01:45] prophesy tell me who hit you he didn't
[1:01:48] feel no virtue it's your approach if God
[1:01:52] will tell me what your need is uh being
[1:01:56] that you're in contact with the spirit
[1:01:58] of God now will you believe then that
[1:02:01] pury will leave you that's right isn't
[1:02:05] it you got more faith than really you
[1:02:08] thought you had now you're really now
[1:02:13] you're really know that something's
[1:02:15] anointing you now when I said that that
[1:02:18] just boosted your faith wasn't that
[1:02:20] right now you look at me as God's
[1:02:22] Prophet you're not from this city you're
[1:02:24] not from around here here you come from
[1:02:26] a big place it's Detroit amen sorry sis
[1:02:31] that's paragraph 101 in the message
[1:02:33] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:36] and forever he says if God would tell me
[1:02:39] what your need is being that you're in
[1:02:41] contact with the spirit of God now will
[1:02:43] you believe then the plur will leave you
[1:02:48] that's right isn't it you got more faith
[1:02:51] than really you thought you had amen all
[1:02:55] right all right we'll take the next one
[1:02:57] he says here in the message Jesus Christ
[1:02:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:03:06] 1962 this is paragraph 107 this man

[1:06:56] out of the line and healed with heart
[1:06:58] trouble that's thus sayeth the Lord
[1:07:01] here's another thing I see you are a
[1:07:04] woman preacher that's right now if
[1:07:07] you'll believe God and won't doubt in
[1:07:09] your heart you'll go on with your

[1:07:29] on with her
[1:07:32] message praise the Lord all
[1:07:35] right we didn't get it on the screen so
[1:07:37] y'all couldn't say Amen we'll get it
[1:07:38] next time then you'll say
[1:07:42] Amen paragraph
[1:07:44] 115 the prophet of God says
[1:07:47] this this is my last quote on this part
[1:07:52] okay he says how many's been in the me
[1:07:55] reads raise your hand see that done
[1:07:57] raise your hands everywhere certainly it
[1:08:00] will it's perfect it's
[1:08:03] God sometimes people have more faith
[1:08:07] than they think they have you try to
[1:08:10] make yourself have faith don't do that
[1:08:13] just humble yourself a man sitting right
[1:08:16] there the light's still around him right
[1:08:18] there it surprised him he had that much
[1:08:23] Faith that's right but he had
[1:08:26] it and it just isn't that right sir if
[1:08:30] that's right raise up your hand the man
[1:08:32] that's healed right down here that's
[1:08:35] right so there it goes again it's just
[1:08:38] living that simple Christian life isn't
[1:08:41] that it it's not trying to make yourself
[1:08:44] do anything you just take God at his
[1:08:46] word simply his word says it and then
[1:08:49] you quote that and you repeat that and
[1:08:51] then you go on and don't try to worry
[1:08:54] about the details or making something
[1:08:57] happen he's already taking care of it
[1:08:59] for you and so um this scripture that we
[1:09:04] read in Romans chapter 8 he that
[1:09:06] justified is also now
[1:09:09] glorified um brother brandom makes the
[1:09:13] statement about the Rapture uh brother
[1:09:16] Bates had read it last week and it just
[1:09:19] really blessed me and I want to read it
[1:09:22] again for you tonight because I think it
[1:09:25] connects with you having faith in you
[1:09:29] now and that everything you have need of
[1:09:32] is in you
[1:09:33] when how many are saved when now how
[1:09:38] many are healed when you're now healed
[1:09:41] and it's already done now and he's
[1:09:45] already got it taken care of we have to
[1:09:48] go through the motions but as Believers
[1:09:51] we say as the scripture says it's all
[1:09:54] ready done it's nigh it's already it's
[1:09:58] yay and amen in God it's a settled thing
[1:10:00] in heaven his word is and we get that
[1:10:03] settled in our mind and our heart that's
[1:10:05] the way we'll speak and he says this in
[1:10:07] the message show us the father this is
[1:10:10] my last quote and God bless you
[1:10:13] amen paragraph 83 God in his word you
[1:10:17] believe God is in his word every seed of
[1:10:21] God every word of God is a seed
[1:10:25] you believe that now it's just like a
[1:10:28] seed you planted if it's wheat it'll
[1:10:31] come up wheat every word of God is every
[1:10:34] Divine promise of God will come to pass
[1:10:38] exactly if you'll put it in the right
[1:10:40] kind of a ground and let it grow do you
[1:10:43] believe that place it there say Lord by
[1:10:47] his stripes I was healed I am healed I
[1:10:50] accept it Lord I'll never say nothing
[1:10:53] else
[1:10:55] I tell you brother that spits the dust
[1:10:58] in the devil's face right there for it's
[1:11:01] thus sayeth the Lord I'll stay right
[1:11:04] there live or die I'll stay right there
[1:11:09] that's my convictions that's my stand
[1:11:12] that's where on Christ the solid rock
[1:11:14] I'll stand all other grounds is sinking
[1:11:17] sand stay right with it yes indeed it'll
[1:11:21] produce just what it said just like a
[1:11:24] little here a lot of you people around
[1:11:26] here have a lot of I notice out here
[1:11:28] fruit orchards where you raise a lot of
[1:11:30] apples you take a little apple tree when
[1:11:33] it's just about that big just a little
[1:11:35] bitty Sprout did you know every bushel
[1:11:38] of apples every Apple every Blossom
[1:11:41] every leaf that'll ever be on that tree
[1:11:44] is on it right then did you know that
[1:11:47] you know you might gather 200 bushes of
[1:11:50] apples off that tree and every one of
[1:11:53] them is in that little tree
[1:11:55] when it's that big if it isn't where
[1:11:59] does it come from tell me who put them
[1:12:02] on there it's in the tree when it begins
[1:12:07] and that's just the way what do we have
[1:12:09] to do with the tree you take the tree
[1:12:11] you plant it in the ground and then you
[1:12:13] have to water it and as you water it it
[1:12:16] doesn't do nothing but drink drink drink
[1:12:18] it has to drink more than its portion
[1:12:22] and more it drinks the bigger it swells
[1:12:25] up it just pushes out limbs then it
[1:12:29] pushes out leaves then it pushes out
[1:12:31] blossoms then it pushes out apples is
[1:12:34] that right and that's the way a
[1:12:37] Christian is we are planted together in
[1:12:40] Christ Jesus who is the inexhaustible
[1:12:43] Fountain of Life we're planted in Christ
[1:12:46] and we just drink and drink and drink
[1:12:49] and push out and everything we have need
[1:12:51] of for the Earthly Journey divine
[1:12:55] healing the power of God all these other
[1:12:59] things is in every individual in here
[1:13:03] that's received the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:06] Ghost for you're planted in Christ

[1:13:32] that he has called he justified those
