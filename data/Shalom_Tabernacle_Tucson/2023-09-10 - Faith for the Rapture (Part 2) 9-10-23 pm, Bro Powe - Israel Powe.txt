don't have a plan B this is it for me I I have nothing else outside of the word of the Lord Jesus I've put everything I got into this amen I believe you did the same thing amen amen so we just certainly honor the Lord we want to get right into the word before we go to the table of the lord we like to greet each of you and the precious name of our Lord and savior the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the reason that we're here tonight we come under expectation for what he has for us amen and we don't want to leave here disappointed and I don't believe the Lord wants us to leave here disappointed either he has something for each and every one of us I believe that hey man I'd like you to take your Bibles and turn into Ephesians chapter 5. we'll finish up a little bit from the faith for the rapture rapturing Faith was the requirement for the age in Ephesians chapter 5. and you have that you can say Amen verse number 21 23 for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husband and every in everything amen because Christ is the head we know that amen we'll take one more scripture second Corinthians chapter 2 verse number eight wherefore I beseech you that you would confirm your love towards him for to this end also did I write that I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom ye forgive anything I forgive also for for I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices that man we'll take one more scripture and second Thessalonians that we read this warning I want to just love the Lord chapter 4 first Thessalonians chapter four always get that mixed up first Thessalonians chapter four and verse 13. but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep and Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not hinder shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout we know what that shout is don't we with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight bless us Lord help us father to get into your word and receive from you the portion that you have for us Lord let the young ones and the older ones each one receive their portion for this message tonight we commit ourselves to you abind us from speaking anything that's contrary to you forgive us of our sins Lord as we stand here in your presence in the presence of these people forgive us of our shortcomings our weaknesses and frailties and look upon the need of our heart and give us exactly what we have need of as our prayer we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated we spoke this morning faith for the Rapture we'll continue with that therefore to keep bothering me up here faith for the rapture and brother banham calls it rapturing faith and I'm just gonna just to add to that wrap the Rapture is at hand the Rapture is at hand that's what's before us is the rapture I might miss a lot of things we don't want to miss that and we can spend our time in a lot of things and we actually get so upset and so moved out of our place over things and people that are not eternal we get upset at things that are just temporal be mad for weeks you can't remember what really made you mad but you hold on to it preach pastor hold on to it and then you try to find out why was I mad at you again it was something but but life is too short to be mad at things that ain't even eternal when we get on the other side ain't gonna be no mad folks over there and we're going to be we ain't gonna be proud for I saw this before you saw this or I was more anointed than you were and I pre I was gifted more gifted and none of that would be over there so let's Let It Go let's Let It Go now Lord help me get that off of me now get it off I'm trying to get into a rapture I want my focus my view for the coming of the Lord and that is what is what is at hand it's the Rapture that is at hand brother random takes this message insists I'm just going to be in one message here tonight just for a few moments and it's Christ The Mystery of God revealed the end of that message I read it for you this morning her brother Branham strikes the clock at two o'clock after preaching for nearly four hours four hours of a sermon he looks at the clock he said if you're spiritual you watch spiritual things you think God would be in something like that oh certainly he designs things that way he sets things up sometimes we don't catch it sometimes we can't see it but he's still there and once he's once he shows it to you you can't help but see it I uh what went to this customer's house the other day and um you know and this person needed their house painted and the first thing they told me is like you know I really don't need my house painted I just need this little part over here painted and I'm thinking to myself that's like me going into the dentist office and trying to tell the dentist what I don't need uh he's gonna tell me they're my teeth but he knows about my teeth and so I I asked the lady I said who told you that you didn't get your house painted well I just I'm sure of it I said okay well if I show you some things uh it's not me doing anything I'm just going to show you and once I show you then you can't unsee it okay fair oh I'm sure I'm sure I said man do you see that spot up there you see that boy oh that's the only size no keep looking look at the next one look at the next one I said that whole side of your house needs it whether you hire me or not does it matter now you know there's a need there and like many of us she's tried to resist it like I can't see what's going on with her house well it's not that bad it's not that what told you it's not that bad is that your feelings talking is this your pocketbook you want to deal that's what's talking but the reality is this is once once I show it to you you'll see it and then it's on you now and this is what the word of the Lord does for us as we come into His presence you pick up the scripture the same scripture your whole life it's sitting there you live in that house and you never saw that that line wasn't straight you've been in this house for 30 years you never saw the crack up there you never saw that scene popping but I'm gonna show it to you and once you see it you can act like you don't see it you don't have to call me no more but every time you walk in that room you're gonna know that crack is up there and this is what the Lord does for us in his word we can act like we don't see it we can act like it's not there but he reveals himself to us and it's the greatest thing that the Lord can do for us is when he reveals himself amen how many witnesses I got tonight aren't you so glad somebody told you somebody showed you somebody opened your eyes aren't you so glad you saw you wasn't what you thought you was you thought you was this and that but somebody showed you you needed to be saved you needed the Holy Ghost you needed to get right with God that is a beautiful thing that's a beautiful thing a man or woman can see their error and change their ways and this is where God is now revealing himself to his church and to his people and to remove the ignorance of Satan's devices now Satan is extremely upset when we get a revelation of who he is that disarms him he can't play the okie doke on us he can't play the games the bait and switch try to make it our fault when he's the liar he's the devil he can't play those games when you when once it's opened up on who really is the liar here who's the guilty party here and who was saved and on their way to heaven now once that's opened up to you it'll change your praise it'll change your worship it'll change your service to him so the prophet of God takes this message here and in paragraph 537 he makes this statement here just a few pages I'll get into this so it's as many many messages within a message this one message Christ The Mystery of God revealed so he identifies that the second pool that closed the third pool is at hand now look at what he says here in paragraph 5 35 we'll go up there just for a moment all right and in the last days has come down in like manner Vindicated himself in the same sign same Wonder same Pillar of Fire same gospel same word same manifestations his body will do the works that he promised like in Mark 16 and so forth his body was not held in the grave but was recognized with him in the resurrection do you get it then the body of his believing children will not be held in the grave when he comes but will be recognized with him because he died for the purpose to resurrect his bride the body and does that make you happy oh my he came for that purpose huh because it is his body because it's the word it's so completely yielded from denomination and things to him and he is the word and it's recognized with him because now we have the first fruit of our Resurrection to know that we have passed from Death unto light become prisoners of his God proven to us by his personal headship that he's the same yesterday today and forever by doing the same things through the church that he did then he and me and I in him and you know and so forth that's right his body was not held in the grave recognized with him in the resurrection same as he is now now catch this here listen which means this his word which he is has begin to rise the word that that down through the age of Luther Wesley has begun to raise up to its power there it began to move then moved a little more now it's coming to identification see watch now to the life in the body now to the life in the body is a Vindication of the Rapture is at hand when you see the headship and the body becoming one and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship when you see the headship and brother so and so come in one with the word when you see the headship and sister so and so coming one with the word when you see the headship and the body becoming one with the word the fullness of the measure of his manifestation shows that the body is about ready to be received to the headship so as we begin to get more In His Image more like the word we read more like the tapes we listen to shows us that the Rapture is at hand it's an identification we're becoming more and more not like the world not like the other churches we're becoming more and more like the word and that's an identification that the headship is coming the Rapture is at hand now we believe that amen this is where we are so the Rapture is at hand we can see the identification of the body now brother Adam goes down in paragraph number 541 notice what caused it Lucifer is doing now as he did at the first time just as the kingdom of the Gentiles was brought in with King Nebuchadnezzar Vindicated the Gentile Race by a prophet who can interpret unknown tongues visions and dreams comes down through the Gentiles without anything uh just medo and Persians and iron and so forth and then defeat it goes out the same way again the Gentile Kingdom notice Luther in the last days is doing as he did at the first we read this this morning what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom greater Splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had you got it now if you miss it just hold up your hand I'll say it again see Lucifer at the beginning his purpose in heart was to achieve a brighter and greater thing in heaven than Christ had is that right by seemingly a more cultured and More Beautiful more Splendor than the kingdom of Christ brother Adam continues on in paragraph 5 46. he says and now they got so much Splendor they don't know what to do but to unite it with the Catholic Church see Lucifer again building a bigger Kingdom to push out people that don't believe in denominations and even take their Church buildings make storerooms and the pastors of such has no rights at all and a man that is a godsend man would never stay in the denomination after he after hearing this or seeing it if he's got enough to go out and look at it certainly I don't say that critically say that truthfully to see that revealed notice in the last day so what are the last days we are in the last days we we know that so the prophet is pointing us like all prophets do point us to a time a future of what to look forward to he's showing us in the last days what's going to take place the Apostle Paul did the same thing he warned us that in the last days this would take place that will take place we'll see all these things taking place so you pick up your prophetic glasses and you begin to see that you're living in the last days you can identify what is going on here because the prophecy of the word revealed it to you notice in the last days Lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid Church a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word by intellectual man instead of a born-again man building an intellectual Kingdom that will outshine Christ's little bitty flock see what it is that did that Fallen Angels the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept out their first estate like the Angels did has fell into organizations like Lucifer's main hold at Nyasia and what have they done organize a great economical Association of ministers to make an image unto the Beast as the Bible said and building a Christian economy that'll close the door source of this church and others like it see Lucifer at work so we see Lucifer's work is to close the doors of the true church that's his job it's the last day prophecy it's part of the squeeze it's part of knowing how to stand it's part of knowing what to look for he says when that squeeze comes then you'll know watch what I'm about to tell you watch the third pull then that's a time frame that's a that's a that's an event that takes place that's the squeeze that squeeze you socially they'll squeeze you on your job they'll squeeze you in your family function they'll squeeze you you can't hardly say what you believe without being criticized as being unsensitive or not complying or being hateful they've got all these labels for people who simply just believe the Bible somebody's got to be right somebody's got to be wrong don't you want to be right but it's been switched haven't it the things that are wrong are now called right and the things that are right are called wrong and when you stand up and say what is right they take it personal you're you're hateful you're you're not you're not um you're being um um what do they call you're not correct you're not politically correct you're you're discriminating against me I've been discriminated against my whole life I'm born in a family of 11. of course I didn't get my way discrimination since I was a little boy growing up oh I can wear it if I need to it's discriminating they just they hating on me they hating on me because I'm five foot eight I'm actually five nine they're hating on me whatever you see we're getting these little clicks and these little reasons why people don't like us they don't like you because they don't like you how about that do you really want everybody to like you huh you can't follow him and everybody like you you can't have one of those if everybody likes you you can't follow the pillar of fire if everybody like if you show can't go in the Rapture if everybody likes you it ain't about everybody liking you it ain't about everybody recognizing you but it is about you following what God called you to be and this hour this age this ecumenical move that's rising up we can see it you know it looks unthreatening in many cases especially in the United States we have all rights we all have rights they say and the people that are right don't have no rights the people that are wrong have more rights than other people have rights but this is what Lucifer has set this up he he he did this in the last days and he used fallen angels to do it now listen what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals and brother Branham goes on to say see Lucifer at work I'm trying to bring you the three-fold Revelation a mystery of God so what was that threefold Revelation that God wanted to reveal himself to people and then God wanted to have the preeminence or to have the first place in those same people and he calls them his bride and then he wanted to restore those people back to the original Adam man what Adam lost in the garden huh that's what we're going to now this is God's motive and objective for saving you his motive for saving you was not just so he can show you a miracle signs wonders Miracles Loaves and Fishes his purpose for saving you was not just to get you off the streets not just so you couldn't go you would you know be a decent citizen but his purpose for saving you was to restore you back to what Adam lost in the garden I'll be thankful for that think of it he's trying to get us God is trying to get us to this threefold purpose let me move on here just for a moment I got 10 or 15 more minutes and he says this year organizations from man of God who went forth to establish truths in the earth before that truth King go along and uh uh proclamate and get onto the real revelation of Christ Fallen Angels come in and took it over and made a denomination out of it that's the reason the revelation of the seventh seal mystery had to be unfolded now do you see it what they left off if Luther would have went on uh it had been here if Wesley would have went on it had been Pentecostal if Pentecost would have went what would they have done president continues on he says this here paragraph 560. notice what's the denomination trying to do exalt itself like Lucifer remember we talked about Pride this morning they so-called they so-called themselves the church the bride which they are in Revelation 17 as we spoke of the false bride above Christ's Little Flock the bride Lucifer thinks and exalts himself above the humble word of God's truth by the knowledge of the Revelation has placed himself by Seminary education and theology until they have got themselves up and if you don't belong in their group then you are outwashed like Lucifer did in the beginning saying to the people just exactly what Lucifer said to Eve surely God will receive us so you see the denomination wants to Lord over God's word in your life you just gotta watch that spirit it's so slime it wants to exalt itself against the word of the Lord the word for your day the word for your hour the enemy will come in and try to water down the word for your day and Elevate something they got on the Internet or some scientific explanation or the reason why that ain't gonna happen or the reason why that's a mistake or the reason this is where the Prophet misses this is why you know we need an explanation for all these things this is Satan's job to elevate his explanation over God's word and God's word is designed there's some places in his word that you cannot explain there's some times and places in his word we have enough Mountaintop evidence to know that this event is going to happen is going to occur but we don't have enough evidence to say exactly how it's gonna happen so as a Believer we take everything that the word gives us the mountaintops of evidence but we can't explain exactly all the details this is why we have to wait patience one of the virtues but the enemy wants to come in and make you Lord over that word and make something or produce something or Elevate itself above they've even you know let's take for example me reading out of this little book here this little green book that might be offensive to some people that followed the message even you're reading these quotes your brother random said or brother random said or the the quotations from the message why do we do that well there was a vision that came to him to store up what huh was that was that a vision from the Lord do you believe those visions and he said the storm fool why why so they can put it on the shelf so the preachers Don't Preach from it so they don't present it to the people start the food why why is it on tape it's on tape so you can hear it and you can listen to it and you can eat it and you become one with it and as you become one with it you can see the Rapture is at hand as you become one with the word the Rapture is at hand now that might need explanation for some but some people I don't need to explain that to anyone it's the truth I was just going through those Vision I was like my goodness record these sermons store them up for the time will come they'll need them the Angel The Voice told the prophet he said was a little building it looked like the Tabernacle looked like that building in Klondike Arizona that little ranch building out there and he said it looked like that building it got closer it was actually the Tabernacle and he said store up food much food much taste because brother Israel needs something to preach on and every god-given preacher would need something to preach about it talk about see I'm not following somebody's testimony I'm not following somebody's memory of what they thought maybe happened but I heard the voice myself and say what the vicious say amen and there's a blessing that comes with it I've said a lot of things in my life don't make no sense but I'm quoting out of this Bible pure pure knowledge according out of this message pure come from God Amen say what the tape says save the division says so you see that Satan's design to break your fellowship with the word of the Lord can I take 15 more minutes I ain't been going that long come on now help me that Satan's design is to break your fellowship to give you an objection a object of purpose in life that's not quite aligned with God's purpose for your life do you know that God's got a purpose for your life God needs you God Wants You God's got something for you to do and that's an individual calling that he makes to the individual it's the most precious Union it's the most precious relationship is that relationship between you and the Lord Jesus Christ it reveals that to you He makes himself known to you doesn't he Satan's job is to break that Union oh mine and the prophet continues here and says that's what the denomination's done they've tried to exalt in paragraph 563 let me take this here for you I had one or two spots I want to get to and we'll go to the table of the Lord God have mercy that men and women will not think I'm saying this to exalt something or some personal revelation I'm only telling you the truth can't you see what they're doing I speak it loud and harsh but you got to drive a nail till it clenches if it's going to do any good now saying to the people surely you mean to tell me that our great Catholic Church that stood all this time our methodists look at our forefathers but they broke the word of the Lord and Eve was God was one of his she was a byproduct of Adam and because she doubted one word of God God's word it did it and here is Lucifer at his job again today and remember the answer Christ is not communism the Antichrist is so close like the real thing till it'll just see the very elective if it was possible Jesus said Matthew 24 the elected if it was possible Lucifer again Lucifer again is breaking God's Unity in Man by his limiting the word of God to his reasoning don't let nobody limit this word to you if you see it in God's word God says you're healed run with it Sis go run with that brother take it if God you see something in God's word and he says by your stripes you're healed I don't care what the disease is run with it I prefer to run with that in the room with somebody's negative testimony because we have evidence that God is the Healer amen Lucifer again is breaking God's Unity limiting the word of God to his reasoning what he thinks is right and what he thinks he breaks the word of God and the same thing he did in the days of Jesus and Jesus said to you by your tradition has made the word of God of none effect and the denominations by the organizations intellectual reasons has made God's word of no effect upon the people that's right they just can't see it then they say where is the god of the Bible he's right here he's the Bible what he is notice now Lucifer comes in the cunningness and breaks the unity of God to man just like he did in Eden by great Temptations of Promise of self-power and exaltations or you might become a bishop you if you just stay with us you might come a district presbyter in the brother Branham continues on so look at Satan down Prophet is stripping them down as we call it piece by piece I'm covering him it's like you're looking at a picture and you can't see the snake in the picture and then you move this detail you move that shadow and then you move that rock and you move that tree and he starts saying is that a tail is that that look like scales what is that this is what the word of the Lord does it starts moving the darkness and you can reveal to you where the enemy is in your life not not the enemy and your brother's law I'm talking about the enemy in your life where the problem really is where your enemy really is talk about these people don't like me this your greatest enemy is you you the problem man you're the problem sis I get too many amens I'm the problem now can you say Amen you don't you in the mirror you the one that's the problem this is the hard head this is the stiff neck this is the ungrateful one this is the one that can't see this is the lazy one this is one that can't pray can't give God thanks for what he's done for you look in the mirror that's the problem and let God open that up to you and when the problem with you get solved all the other problems get solved when you get right everybody else gets right when your vision is clear you know how to place people at the end stop trying to make people like you and be your friends and understand you you the problem when you get a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ those co-workers you'll love them you'll love them without them you wouldn't have a prayer life you can't walk around with a smile on your face all your life we got some Sorrows for you we got to develop a prayer life for you so we got to get somebody in your life that hates you that bothers you that annoys you and they might be living with you y'all said I can keep going closing them but when you get you right then all the other problems find their place amen so he's uncovering this this being Satan is tactics of the last name it was a mystery that was healed hid for the foundation of the world and now he's being revealed to a select few and that select few is his bride because God's trying to bring them back to what Adam was paragraph 572 notice Lucifer comes in cunning me like he did then and by Temptations false promise of power out apart from the word of God he did the same thing at niac Rome he's doing the same thing today at the World Council the ELCA miracle churches paragraph 578 brother random continues on with this uncovering notice we see the Promise being fulfilled Christ the true headship coming in his bride doing the same works that he did at the beginning making ready and fulfilling his word as he did in first John 14 12. he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also then the head and the body are becoming one in works and in sign and in life can you say that with me and works in sign and in life are you becoming one with the word in your life in your works you see me reading the scripture to you exposing you and exposing me me reading the quote to you exposing you and exposing me does not change our behavior until a power of the word now comes upon us to make us live what we heard I can't take this quote and stick it in and say grow like the rest of my Buzzard feathers Blended in you know fluff it out blend it in no no no no no no no no it's you got to be born again and then these quotes in this truth and the scriptures have to be birthed in you otherwise you're going to be struggling to try to make yourself live the message or live the rules and the regulations but you got to have a life to live that so he's trying to bring us in that we become one in works and in sign and in life Vindicated by God himself through his promised word for the last days he promised us in the last days now if you're spiritual you'll catch it then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand so the Rapture is at hand the marriage supper is at hand now if I never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued in the great Millennium and taking up of the church and destroying the wicked in the world under the Sixth Seal to be purified by volcanic to take all the corruption and sin of the world to mold her out again to bring forth a bright New Millennium let me go on all right that's a beautiful thought that one day all of the evil thoughts and evil spirits there's a holy fire going to purify all of that amen how many's ever thought of evil thought oh yes that came from somewhere but in that other land it won't be there no more amen all right now brother random brings us to the head and I'll prepare to close all right paragraph 583 notice being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's questions amen Glory we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and has paid the price and racism raises up the head the body the devil can't stand it that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they are doing now the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is his wickedness his scheme has been uncovered by the Risen resurrected Christ in the headship over his body Glory now this is a beautiful thing that this that the the the wicked one Satan the devil has been uncovered his scheme has been unmasked we can now see what his intentions are what his motives are we can see that he knows how to quote the scriptures and the Bible we can see that he can pose himself as a minister or a religious person we see that he can take all of these forms right and he's howling mad and this is why he's raising up this ecumenical counsel this these forces and these powers to try to stop the preaching from going on to close the doors of the church in one form or the other doesn't want the holy ghost moving in the assemblies doesn't want a preacher preaching the message so that Spirit Rises up and it used scriptures and quotes to try to say that it's wrong now to preach the gospel and it's wrong to go and do these things that the Bible said we should do even to the gifts of the Spirit the least of the gifts is speaking in tongues could you imagine how many message churches were would go cross-eyed somebody started speaking in tongues in their Message Church huh it's all through their Bible it's the least of the gifts it's on the tapes it's on the tapes in the Branham Tabernacle he referenced it he authenticated it and yet today 2023 you let somebody speak in tongues in all of the message churches you're gonna have some problems uh-huh from message people and these gifts because it's Satan that's howling mad because we have his answer and the answer that we have for him is that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and now I have found my purpose in life I thought I wanted to be this I thought I wanted to play football I thought I wanted to be some lawyer or be whatever you thought you wanted to be but now I found my purpose in life my purpose in life was to become one with the word and as I get myself in line to be one with the words and I know that the Rapture is at hand isn't that beautiful so we know Satan can't take advantage of us now say you know if you don't believe that if you believe this we'll pay you more money if you don't preach on that you ain't talking to a believer believe we don't have time for that a believer loves other believers but if if him by himself he knows he knows that's what a True Believer does a Believer loves other believer loves Fellowship I love their brothers I love being able to call share a quote love all of that but if I had to stand alone and if I have to cross up and leave a break Fellowship a True Believer will do that why because the scheme has been uncovered our headship is the word and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't you thank God for that are you coming in line with the word that's where the Rapture is you know brother Brown I'm talking about speeding oh somebody said clothes hey do you feel that tightened up help me felt that got that heavy foot because the Lord knows I need to be on time the Lord didn't know that I should have woke up earlier Pace myself better and get on the freeway and no police around so I can speed right is that how it works if I see the police then I'll behave right that's how we operate yeah all right thank you but that's not what the words those laws are put there and it's just as simple as obeying what the word of the Lord has told us to do and even just those simple things like that Prophet talk to us about coming to church on time praying uh preparing for the service talked about if there's an ought between one another to go make it right now but we like to hold it and season it and hold it and then wear it why be offended I like that feeling of being offended because they offended me I want to feel that for a minute wait wait bro they want to make it right no I don't want to make it right yeah I want to feel this this whole fence how many you know what I'm talking about yes and but you can make that right and the prophet tells us that we shouldn't go we shouldn't uh let the sun go down upon our Wrath we shouldn't hold grudges with one another we should make those things right say brother Israel open up one of them seals break open the seal this might be one of the seals that needs to break on you that you know stop being so hateful and mean and love and forgive and learn how to be you know uh uh more like more like Christ in just these simple matters and we step over the top of those in just as simple as that as we start to recognize that we're getting ourselves in line with the word and as we get in line with the word we're actually getting in line with the Rapture can you think of it like that as you line up with the word you're lining up with the rapture because you coming one with the word shows that you're coming in line for the Rapture God bless you how many do you want to make the rapture how many want to make it you believe that by God's grace you will make it I tell you what if it wasn't for his grace we couldn't be here tonight but he made a way for us to be here he sure did and lining up with the word is lining up with the Rapture and the Rapture is at hand so lining up with the word is your next step can you receive that my brother my sister what's your next step tonight just take this with you tonight your next step my young man my young sister older saying whoever you may be your next step is just to line up with the word and the Lord Reveals His word to you you line and step with that and you're lining up for the Rapture God bless you God bless you amen the musicians will come we'll have the brothers come forward and bring the elements out for the Lord's Supper as they play Softly there's that song I was thinking of standing somewhere in the shadows you can find Jesus I can't I don't know the song all the way but that's been in my mind I could play that softly let's bow our heads forward of Prayer [Music] how many of you here tonight how many of you here tonight I know we do it often but it's so needful how many of you here tonight would like to use one more opportunity of your life at this moment of your life to to raise your hand to this the Lord I want to line up with your word I every believer every man and woman that I know Old-Timers newcomers that's what they really want that's their great desire is Lord I want to line up with your word because as I'm lighting up with your word I'm lining up with the rapture oh my think of it that's the headship those hands that are raised God put something in you to raise your hand brother sister God put something in you maybe there was a time in your life you wouldn't even raise your hand to something like that but you did tonight oh my how beautiful let's pray Lord Jesus thank you for those hands that will raise my hand raised to that Lord I want to line up with your words like in my life in my works and all that I would do I want I want that word to line up on the job in my finances in dealing with my children or my parents in working with my neighbors in the neighborhood my attitude towards the Sinner Man or sinner woman my perspective against those that disagree with me I disagree with them my attitude against those that have offended me and I got a little hard feeling for him Lord I want to line up with your word in my works in my life and what I'm doing in my life I want to light up with the word I don't want to just hear the word I just don't want to say man I don't want to feel guilty about the word but I want to actually line up with the word and I just feel sorry not just feel guilty I want to line up with the word of the Lord and I'll line up with the rapture granted oh God it's our prayer as we prepare our hearts to come to this table this feast tonight Lord prepare our hearts to be tender and honest before you to be honest Lord and confess to you all of our wrongs the secret sins the unknown sins the hidden sins the open sins Lord we try to make excuses for it we wanna got so used to living with the cracks on our home we'll make excuses that it needs repair and a professional will come and tell you need a repair and we'll make an excuse against it because we've lived there for so long but oh God help us not to be like that help us to be honest I'm both sincere humility is humbling ourselves to your word oh God take away the pride in my life and my heart is my prayer restore the joy of thy salvation God hear and answer each of these requests these hands that were raised in Jesus name we pray father amen can we sing a little bit of that [Music] standing somewhere in the shadows you'll find Jesus mmm [Music] oh

an appropriate song Amen First Corinthians 11 oh my will turn there in our Bibles we'll stand for the reading of God's word a bit of announcement let's keep in mind the in prayer the meetings coming in November that's our yearly meetings really praying for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit something to draw us closer to the headstone also the men's meeting that's coming up for the the prayer breakfast just for demand and just keep that in prayer as well and to pray one for the other First Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doing a remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this two years off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup if you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup pardon me eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup or he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep as many are dead that's what that means or they die prematurely brother random says for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world how many want to be chastened of the Lord so that you won't be condemned because the world is going to be condemned I'd rather be chasing right now than to be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren come together to eat Terry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home you come not together unto condemnation the rest of Allah said in order when I come I was reading some of these scriptures and quotes on communion to the Saints in Phoenix on Wednesday night with brother Roland McGraw's church that why that's why I wasn't here on Wednesday just to help them out and the little group there and certainly appreciate brother George filling in for the service and brother Joe always available to play the tape or preach and do whatever is necessary don't you thank God for that I sure do I could tell you to be gone and you just have the full confidence that they gonna handle it the way you would and I certainly appreciate that brother George thank you God bless you brother Joel appreciate you very much and um we was reading some of these quotes and one of the quotes that I read that whether Brandon says that when you eat the bread it shows to the church that you believe every word and then there was another one that says Lord Brothers praying to the Lord let everyone who partakes of this May um the the um weariness from their body departs May the weakness depart may they receive physical and spiritual strength in partaking of a simple little a simple little service like this Bread and Wine Jesus said to do it is beautiful it really is and we don't take it for granted we thank God that we have a revelation to do it we do it at night time because that's when it was instituted at night the uh Jesus had the last supper with his disciples it was the type of Israel coming out of Egypt it was an ordinance that they were partake and the Death Angel was to pass through the land and um after partaking of that last supper in Israel that ordinance they went 40 years their clothes didn't wear out the Bible says there wasn't one feeble one amongst them look up that word feeble let's see what it means there wasn't one feeble one among them and they walked through that journey and they got and God blessed them and helped them and he brought them through and that great um that great uh uh last supper with our lord Jesus it kind of leads like looks like he just did that but then Paul picks it up and he said I received of the Lord and then he sets it in order and then he brings in if you partake of it unworthily you'll be guilty of the body so he brings the seriousness of partaking he brings the correction how some were coming and eating and it was a casual affair he said this is not coming together to eat food this is to remember the Lord's Supper Terry won for another and do this in remembrance of me so that you won't be condemned with the world and when you come to Take and Eat of this bread and drink others he says examine yourself so when we pray for one another we examine ourselves we pray for one another I'll pray for you pray for me you pray for the one behind you next to you and in front of you that's what that tarian one for another that's what that means so we'll do that in silent prayer we'll just pray silently pray for our my secret sin I'll pray for yours we pray for one another amen thank you Lord heavenly father I hold in my hand the bread that was made for the service Lord It's the type of your body that was broken the type of the word oh God obey each one that partake receive the blessings of being obedient to the word we know that there's Divine Healing in it the strength for the journey blessed we pray in Jesus name amen Heavenly Father are holding my hands the cup of the New Testament of your blood Lord may you bless it for this service Lord those that partake of it as they have examined themselves Lord may they receive the blessing that comes with it be healthy and strong and even happy oh God is my prayer in Jesus name amen God bless you may be she's a very hard worker and I thank God for her and my children I thank God for children that the Lord has given me they're the the best kids that any father could have Levi are they laughing Aaliyah and Karissa I don't think Teresa must be at home pray for her amen and Saint John um we have to stand for the reading of the word chapter 13. supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded in committee to Simon Peter and said unto him Lord Peter said unto him Lord the thou does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said what I do thou knowest not now but thou shall know Hereafter Peter said unto him thou shall never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needed not to save wash his feet but it's clean every wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment it was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet isn't that amazing how the Lord humbled himself to wash another man's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happier ye if you do them and man it's hard to have pride in your life and heart while you're washing another man's feet and that's part of Jesus said to do it he did it and he left an example for us to do amen so the sisters will go out we'll sing a song before he goes before we go out king of my life I Crown thee now thine shall the glory be lest I forget the thorn crown brow lead me to Calvary king of my life I Crown thee now thine shall the Glory Be [Music] blessed I forget thy long Crown Brown lead me to Calvary unless I forget less I forget guessing [Music] bless I forget thine Agony [Music] lest I forget thy love for me lead me to cow Glory Fill Me Lord with desire Fill Me O Lord with thy desire foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
