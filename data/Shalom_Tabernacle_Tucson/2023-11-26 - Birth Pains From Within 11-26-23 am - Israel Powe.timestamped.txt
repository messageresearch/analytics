[3:58] brother random
[4:01] now we find the Lamb with the book now
[4:05] and now in the sixth chapter we
[4:08] read and I saw when the lamb opened one
[4:12] of the seals and I heard as it were the
[4:15] noise of a
[4:17] thunder and one of the four beasts
[4:21] saying come and see and I saw him Behold
[4:24] a white horse and he is set on him had a
[4:28] bow and a Crown was given unto him and
[4:32] he went forth conquering and to
[4:35] conquer that's the first seal the one
[4:38] we're going to try by the grace of God
[4:41] to explain it tonight by the very best I
[4:45] realize that a man trying to explain
[4:49] that is walking on Dangerous Grounds if
[4:51] you don't know what you're
[4:53] doing so if it comes to me by Revelation
[4:57] I tell you so if I just have to take it
[5:00] to my own mind I I'll tell you that
[5:02] before I talk about it but I'm just as
[5:05] positive as I'm standing here tonight
[5:09] that come aresh to me today from the
[5:12] almighty I'm not prone to uh just saying
[5:16] things like that when it comes to this
[5:18] part of the
[5:20] scripture
[5:23] God I'm I hope you're know what I'm
[5:25] talking about now you know you can't say
[5:29] things if something's supposed to be
[5:31] laying over here uh before it happens
[5:34] you you can't say it there something
[5:35] lays it over there see but are you
[5:38] reading are you listening to something
[5:43] now the seven seal r book is now being
[5:49] released by The Lamb we approach that
[5:52] place tonight God help us as the seals
[5:55] are broken and released the mysteries of
[5:59] the book are
[6:01] revealed now you see this is a sealed
[6:07] book now we believe that do we
[6:10] not we believe it it is a sealed book
[6:14] now we never know this
[6:17] before but it
[6:19] is it's sealed with Seven
[6:23] Seals that is on the back of the book
[6:27] the book is sealed with Seven Seals
[6:30] if we talked about this kind of book it
[6:32] would be like putting a strap across it
[6:34] seven straps but it isn't this kind of a
[6:37] book it's a scroll and then when the
[6:40] scroll is Unwound that's one that laying
[6:43] right in the scroll is number two and
[6:45] right here says what it is but it's a
[6:48] mystery but yet we have pred in it but
[6:53] remember the book is sealed and the book
[6:57] is the book of mystery of
[7:00] Revelation it is the
[7:03] revelation of Jesus
[7:05] Christ see a book of
[7:09] Revelation and now you know down through
[7:12] the age man has probed and tried to get
[7:15] into that we all had and yet one time I
[7:19] remember if if Mr Bohanan had to be
[7:23] present or or some of his people I I
[7:26] don't mean it by any insult Mr bannah is
[7:30] a bosm friend and is a superintendent of
[7:33] the public service and I was working
[7:34] there I first got saved I was telling
[7:37] about reading on the Book of Revelations
[7:38] he said I tried to read that thing he
[7:41] said and Mr Bohanan was a fine man and
[7:45] he uh he was a member of the church and
[7:49] and I don't know what all he belonged to
[7:51] but he said I think that John must have
[7:54] had a red pepper supper that night and
[7:59] when went to the bed on a full stomach I
[8:02] said to him although it could have cost
[8:04] my John I said aren't you ashamed to say
[8:06] that I was just a boy but I said aren't
[8:09] you ashamed to say that about the word
[8:11] of
[8:12] God yet just a kid no more than early
[8:17] maybe 21 22 years old and works scarce
[8:20] the depression on but yet there was a
[8:22] fear in there when I slanted here any
[8:25] slant towards God's word it's truth all
[8:29] truth so it was not even a dream or a
[8:34] nightmare it wasn't John eat he was on
[8:37] the aisle of patmas because he tried to
[8:40] put the word of God into a book form and
[8:43] was exiled there by the Roman government
[8:45] and was on the island on the day of the
[8:48] Lord and he heard behind him a voice of
[8:52] many Waters and turned to look and he
[8:53] saw seven golden candlesticks there
[8:56] stood the Son of God in between them now
[9:00] then the book is a revelation so a
[9:04] revelation is something that's made
[9:06] known of something something that's been
[9:09] revealed and now notice so you won't
[9:13] forget it it is closed up until the
[9:19] latter
[9:22] time the whole mystery of it is closed
[9:26] up until the latter times we find that
[9:29] in the scripture here now the mystery of
[9:32] the book are revealed when the seals are
[9:36] broken and when the seals completely are
[9:40] broken the time of redemption is over
[9:43] because the lamb left the intercession
[9:45] boat to walk out to take his claim he
[9:48] was a mediator between that but when the
[9:51] real Revelation happens on the seals as
[9:55] they begin to break the lamb is coming
[9:58] forth from from the
[10:00] sanctuary according to the word we read
[10:02] it last night it come from the out of
[10:06] the midst and tucked the book oh he's no
[10:09] more mediator because even they call him
[10:12] a
[10:13] line and that's the that's a
[10:16] king and he's not a mediator then
[10:19] although the actors of these seals begin
[10:23] at the first church age I
[10:27] remember so you you we'll get the
[10:30] background of it thoroughly if we can or
[10:32] as thoroughly as possible the actors
[10:35] I'll place it like that
[10:37] because um an actor is the man who
[10:41] changes Mass see and in this act tonight
[10:47] we're going to see that is Satan
[10:49] changing his
[10:50] MK and all actors Christ acting the part
[10:56] that he did when he become from a Spirit
[10:59] to man he only put on an actor's garment
[11:04] human flesh and came down in the form of
[11:08] a man in order to be a kinsman
[11:12] redeemer now now see it's only an
[11:16] actor's form that's reason they are all
[11:18] in Parables and and the way they are
[11:20] here like beast and animals so forth
[11:23] it's in an act and these actors began in
[11:27] the first church age because that was
[11:30] Christ revealing himself to the seven
[11:35] Church
[11:37] ages are you understanding all right see
[11:40] Christ revealing himself to the seven
[11:44] Church
[11:45] ages then through these Church ages
[11:49] there's a great mess up comes along then
[11:53] at the end of the church age the seventh
[11:57] Angels message message is to pick up
[12:00] these lost Mysteries and to give it to
[12:03] the church amen now we'll notice that
[12:08] but uh not then revealed in their true
[12:12] State now in the Bible times the
[12:16] Mysteries were there and they seen these
[12:19] things happen the way John saw it here
[12:22] now he said there is a white horse rider
[12:26] but what the mystery of it is there's a
[12:28] mystery that goes with that riter now
[12:31] what it was they didn't know but it's to
[12:33] be revealed but it is to be revealed
[12:36] after the lamb leaves the father's
[12:39] Throne of his intercessory as kinsman
[12:43] redeemer I'm going to drop a little
[12:45] something in here uh if anybody gets
[12:48] these tapes uh any man can speak
[12:51] whatever he wants to he has a right to
[12:54] for anything of his condition but if you
[12:57] don't if a minister doesn't want this
[13:00] amongst his people then tell him not to
[13:01] take it but I I this is amongst the
[13:05] people that I have been sent to speak to
[13:09] therefore I must reveal what is truth
[13:12] see now the lamb in the time of
[13:17] intercessory back here he knew that
[13:20] there were names in there that was put
[13:24] in there from the foundation of the
[13:27] world and as long long as them names had
[13:30] never been manifested on Earth as yet he
[13:33] had to stay there as
[13:35] intercessor you get it perfectly
[13:39] predestination see all right he had to
[13:42] stay there because he came to die for
[13:47] those that God had ordained to eternal
[13:52] life see by his for knowledge he saw him
[13:55] not by his own will his will was that
[13:58] none should perish but by his for
[14:01] knowledge he knew who would and who
[14:02] would not therefore as long as there was
[14:05] one name had never yet been cled
[14:08] declared in Earth Christ had to stay
[14:10] there as an intercessor to take care of
[14:13] that name but as soon as that final
[14:17] name had been splashed in that porox or
[14:21] bleach D his intercessory days was over
[14:25] let him that's filthy be filthy still
[14:28] let him it's holy he's holy still see
[14:31] and he leaves the sanctuary and then it
[14:33] becomes a judgment
[14:35] seat who unto those outside of Christ
[14:38] thing amen now notice but it's to be
[14:43] revealed when the lamb leaves his
[14:46] intercessory place from the father now
[14:48] that's Revelation 5 now he takes the
[14:52] book of seals the book of seals or a
[14:56] book seal with seals breaks them and
[15:01] shows
[15:02] them look at the end of the age at the
[15:06] essor over the church ages is done
[15:09] finished up you come in the first age
[15:13] Ephesian age reveal sent a messenger
[15:17] notice what happens as we go along
[15:19] here's the plan of it the first thing
[15:22] happens there is a uh an announcement in
[15:27] the heavens first what happens a seal is
[15:32] open what is that a mystery is unfolded
[15:36] see and when a mystery unfolds then a
[15:39] trumpet sounds it declares a
[15:42] war a flag fall and a church age open
[15:48] see what is the war part the angel of
[15:52] the church catches the mystery of God
[15:55] not fully yet revealed but when he does
[15:58] he catches this mystery of God and then
[16:02] he goes forth to the people at the
[16:05] mystery's been given to him Goes Forth
[16:07] to the people what does he do out there
[16:11] he begins to Proclaim that message and
[16:14] what does it start a war a spiritual war
[16:19] and then God takes his messenger with
[16:22] the elect of that age and lays them away
[16:24] asleep and then he drops a plague upon
[16:27] them who rejected it a temporary
[16:31] judgment and then after that is over
[16:35] then it goes on the denominate and bring
[16:37] in denominations and start off that
[16:39] man's work like of Wesley and all the
[16:43] rest of them and then it gets all in the
[16:46] scrapple again and then another mystery
[16:49] comes forth then what happens another
[16:52] messenger arrives on Earth for a church
[16:54] age see then when he arrives he the the
[16:57] trumpet sounds he declares war see and
[17:01] then what happens finally then he's
[17:04] caught away and then when he's laid away
[17:07] then plag Falls destroys them spiritual
[17:11] death hits the church and she's gone
[17:13] that group then it goes on to another
[17:16] one oh it's a great plan until it comes
[17:19] to that last
[17:21] angel now he has no certain
[17:24] mystery but he gathers up all that's
[17:27] been lost in them other
[17:29] ages all the truths that wasn't truly
[17:32] revealed yet see as the Revelation come
[17:35] then he reveals those things in his day
[17:38] if you want to read it there it is
[17:40] Revelations 10 1 to one4 you'll get it
[17:44] all right see takes the book and of
[17:48] seals and breaks them and shows the
[17:52] seventh angel for this alone the
[17:56] mysteries of God is the ministry of the
[18:00] seventh
[18:01] angel now we just come through the
[18:03] church ages with even history improved
[18:05] that it is the the Angel's message of
[18:10] the seventh Church all right Reveals All
[18:14] the Mysteries that's been in the past
[18:19] all the things in the past Revelations
[18:21] 10:
[18:22] 1-7 that's the be I remember in the days
[18:25] of the seventh angel It's sounding forth
[18:29] blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is
[18:33] to finish all the mysteries of
[18:37] God just like here come forth in the
[18:40] early church ages we'll get it at a
[18:42] while of Doctrine then it become a
[18:45] saying first then a Doctrine and then
[18:48] become a statute then become a church
[18:51] and Through the Dark Ages and out of the
[18:53] Dark Ages come the First Reformation
[18:56] Luther and he brought with all kinds of
[18:59] mysterious things that happened during
[19:01] that church age all back in there then
[19:04] but he never finished it up then Along
[19:07] come Wesley with
[19:08] sanctification got some more of it still
[19:10] never finished it left Loose Ends
[19:12] everywhere such a sprankling instead of
[19:15] baptism and Luther T father son Holy
[19:17] Ghost instead of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:20] all these different things that along
[19:22] come the Pentecostal age with the
[19:24] baptism of the Holy Spirit and they
[19:27] cabbage down on that now there cannot be
[19:30] no more ages that's all of it that's the
[19:34] Philadelphia the lady o see a age but
[19:37] then the we found in the studying of the
[19:40] scripture that the messenger to the age
[19:43] come right at the end of the age every
[19:46] time Paul come at the End of the Age we
[19:49] find out at irenius come to the End of
[19:52] the Age Martin End of the Age Luther the
[19:55] end of the Catholic age and Mark Wesley
[19:57] at the end of the the Lutheran age and
[19:59] Pentecost at the End of the Age of
[20:02] sanctification to the baptism of the
[20:03] Holy Ghost and at the end of the
[20:06] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[20:08] receive according to the word as God
[20:11] helped me tonight to show you through
[20:12] here that we are to see receive a
[20:17] messenger that will take all those loose
[20:19] ends out there and reveal the whole
[20:22] Secret Of God for the Ling of the church
[20:26] and then there's coming forth seven
[20:27] Myster ious Thunders that's not even
[20:29] written at
[20:30] all right and I believe that through
[20:33] those seven Thunders will be reveal in
[20:36] the last days in order to get the bride
[20:39] together for Rapture and Faith because
[20:41] what we got right now we we wouldn't be
[20:43] able to do it there's something we've
[20:46] got to step farther we we can't have
[20:48] enough faith for Divine Healing Harley
[20:50] we've got to have enough Faith to be
[20:52] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[20:55] of this
[20:56] Earth and we'll find find that after a
[20:58] while the Lord's willing to find where
[21:00] it's written then all the judgments of
[21:05] these evil doers I see down to the ages
[21:09] of these seals has been breaken until
[21:12] now the last seal is
[21:16] broken and now as they uh as they have
[21:19] been watching in on these seals and just
[21:23] pursu presuming what they were doing now
[21:26] at the End of the Age of the church ages
[21:30] all these evil doers uh take place and
[21:34] head up in the
[21:36] tribulation all of these evildoers of
[21:40] the Seven Seals that's been working
[21:42] mysterious in the church and we'll find
[21:45] out in a minute it even worked in the
[21:48] name of a
[21:51] church they call themselves The
[21:54] Church you just see if that isn't right
[21:58] no wonder I've been so against
[22:00] denomination not knowing
[22:02] why see they end up now it starts back
[22:06] here in a mile Farm is keeps getting
[22:08] worse and worse on down until and people
[22:12] go right into it then oh yes this is
[22:14] just fine but in the last days these
[22:17] things are made
[22:19] known and they finally go so bad until
[22:23] they go come into the tribulation period
[22:26] and how can a man say that the bride of
[22:31] Christ goes into the tribulation I can't
[22:33] understand
[22:34] it she's tuck away from the
[22:37] tribulation if if the church has been
[22:40] judged and they have judged themselves
[22:43] and have accepted the blood how can God
[22:47] judge a man that's perfectly totally
[22:53] sinless you say there's no such a person
[22:56] ever born again believer True Believer
[22:59] is perfectly absolutely sinless before
[23:04] God he's not trusting in his words and
[23:08] the blood of Jesus that his confession
[23:10] is dropped
[23:12] into the Bible says so see he that that
[23:18] is born of God does not commit sin or he
[23:23] cannot
[23:25] s how can you make a man sinner when the
[23:29] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is
[23:31] between him and God that would scatter
[23:34] sin there be nothing left of it see how
[23:38] can that pure blood of Christ ever let a
[23:42] sin pass there he
[23:56] cannot

[1:10:03] the labor pains or the birth pains and
[1:10:06] he gives that illustration that while
[1:10:09] she's pregnant and have those pains and
[1:10:12] those labor pains you can now determine
[1:10:16] how far along she is um there's a weight
[1:10:19] gain there's different changes going on
[1:10:22] in her body
[1:10:24] um they're not all comfortable and even
[1:10:27] when the time of the birth takes place
[1:10:30] there's extreme sorrow uh many many
[1:10:33] women don't make it through the birth uh
[1:10:36] there's many that die over the years
[1:10:39] we've gotten better at doing that but
[1:10:41] it's always a very very delicate um it's
[1:10:46] a delicate procedure there we we do it
[1:10:48] all the time we see it display all the
[1:10:51] time we're all here because we
[1:10:53] experienced it uh we were born but it's
[1:10:57] still a very delicate time it the the
[1:11:02] the woman is is compromised the baby is
[1:11:05] compromised and these lives is not a
[1:11:08] guarantee that this will come forth in a
[1:11:13] success there's many cases of
[1:11:16] stillborns or the B the mother dying and
[1:11:19] the child living or the child dying and
[1:11:22] the mother living or both
[1:11:26] dying we see this with with Rachel when
[1:11:30] she had birthed her first son Joseph and
[1:11:35] it was this great desire for her to have
[1:11:38] children but she was Barren we read the
[1:11:42] scripture there that we just read there
[1:11:44] in Genesis Chapter 30 that her sister
[1:11:47] Leah had children and when she saw that
[1:11:51] she could have no children Rachel that
[1:11:54] she envied her
[1:11:56] sister now this Envy is the same word
[1:12:00] used when Joseph's brothers envied him
[1:12:05] it was Envy it's used in a number of
[1:12:08] places in the scripture is also it's
[1:12:11] it's used the same as
[1:12:14] jealousy um but um this this Envy the
[1:12:20] the the the the the inhabitants of the
[1:12:25] land that were sewing with Isaac in
[1:12:27] Genesis chapter 26 you'll see that those
[1:12:31] people begin to Envy Isaac because the
[1:12:34] Lord was blessing him not so much I mean
[1:12:38] we can all have stuff but when you have
[1:12:40] plants or people or things that animals
[1:12:44] things that are alive that are
[1:12:46] increasing I mean even if it's a pig and
[1:12:50] you have little piglets you want to see
[1:12:53] those pigs grow if they're healthy they
[1:12:55] will grow and they grow by the birth and
[1:12:59] this is how the Lord actually grew
[1:13:02] Israel he grew a nation through two
[1:13:04] mothers through the birth and this this
[1:13:09] birth Jesus is now giving his disciples
[1:13:12] this example that while there is great
[1:13:15] sorrow there's great stress and uh but
[1:13:19] your sorrow is going to be turned into
[1:13:22] Joy after after this birth takes place
[1:13:26] to where you you won't even she doesn't
[1:13:29] even remember the mother doesn't even
[1:13:30] remember the pains so much to where this
[1:13:35] you know they might say I'll never do
[1:13:37] that again but then you look at them 5
[1:13:39] years down the road they got four or
[1:13:40] five
[1:13:41] kids and so say what you want to is what
[1:13:45] you doing is what we look at and because
[1:13:49] you don't remember the pain you don't
[1:13:50] remember all of the those delicate times
[1:13:53] because the joy is so
[1:13:56] great The Joy the prize is so great that
[1:14:01] it's worth going through the
[1:14:04] pain and if you a Christian today you're
[1:14:07] going to go through the pain you're
[1:14:08] going to go through the test Jesus did
[1:14:11] all of his disciples did but let's go
[1:14:15] back in the Old Testament just for a
[1:14:16] little bit and deal with Rachel just for
[1:14:18] a moment and her sister Leah if we take
[1:14:22] Genesis chapter
[1:14:25] 29 in verse
[1:14:30] number
[1:14:32] 18 this is the conflict we talked about
[1:14:35] last Sunday that it's it's almost like
[1:14:38] God started it or God allowed it Genesis
[1:14:42] 29:8 and Jacob loved Rachel and said I
[1:14:45] will serve the seven years for Rachel
[1:14:47] thy younger daughter and laan said it is
[1:14:50] better that I give her to thee that I
[1:14:52] should give give her to another man
[1:14:54] abide with me and Jacob served seven
[1:14:57] years for Rachel they seemed unto him
[1:15:00] but a few days for the love he had to
[1:15:02] her and Jacob said unto laan give me my
[1:15:05] wife for my days are fulfilled that I
[1:15:07] may go in unto her and laan gathered
[1:15:11] together all the men of the place and
[1:15:13] made a feast and it came to pass in the
[1:15:15] evening that he took Leah his daughter
[1:15:18] and brought her to him and he went in
[1:15:21] unto her and laan gave unto his daughter
[1:15:24] Leah zipa his maid for handmade it came
[1:15:27] to pass that in the morning behold It
[1:15:30] was
[1:15:31] Leah and he said to laan what is this
[1:15:34] that thou H has done unto me did not I
[1:15:36] serve thee with for Rachel wherefore
[1:15:40] hast thou beged me laben said it must
[1:15:43] not be so done in our country to give
[1:15:45] the younger before the firstborn you see
[1:15:49] that firstborn position again right
[1:15:52] there this is where the conflict starts
[1:15:55] is because Jacob wants to marry the
[1:15:58] younger sister and agreed to marry her
[1:16:02] but she was not the firstborn so Leah
[1:16:05] actually had that position and God
[1:16:08] respected this and look at verse number
[1:16:12] 30 one and when the Lord saw that Leah
[1:16:15] was hated he opened her W womb but
[1:16:19] Rachel was Barren so who's in control of
[1:16:22] that
[1:16:24] who who caus one to have children and
[1:16:26] the other one to not have children who's
[1:16:29] in control of that the Bible says that
[1:16:31] God saw
[1:16:32] Leah and he opened her womb and gave her
[1:16:36] children because he saw that she was
[1:16:39] hated and she conceived again and bear
[1:16:42] her son and said because the Lord had
[1:16:44] heard that I was hated he have therefore
[1:16:47] given me this son and she called his
[1:16:49] name Simeon let's take verse 32 just for
[1:16:51] a moment
[1:16:53] Leah conceived and bear son and she
[1:16:55] called his name Ruben for she said
[1:16:58] surely the Lord have looked upon my
[1:17:00] Affliction now therefore my husband will
[1:17:04] what this is what she's looking for will
[1:17:08] love me she conceived again and bear a
[1:17:11] son and said because the Lord hath heard
[1:17:13] that I was hated he hath therefore given
[1:17:17] me this son who was hating
[1:17:21] her yeah husband wasn't loving her so
[1:17:25] the opposite of that is hate and Lord
[1:17:28] you saw that I'm being hated in this
[1:17:31] contract so you give me another son I'm
[1:17:33] going to name him like that too she
[1:17:35] called his name Simeon verse 34 and she
[1:17:37] conceived again and bear a son and said
[1:17:40] now this time will my husband be joined
[1:17:43] unto me because I have borne in him
[1:17:47] three sons therefore was his name called
[1:17:50] Levi notice that the mention of her
[1:17:53] husband or uh being joined to him the
[1:17:58] Love is All intertwined into the naming
[1:18:01] of these boys it's a conflict it's
[1:18:05] stressful no you took my husband no you
[1:18:07] took my
[1:18:09] husband now I was it was just agreement
[1:18:11] well you know our in the rules of our
[1:18:14] land and this conflict ensues God allows
[1:18:18] the conflict to ensue and she's having
[1:18:21] these children now my husband will love
[1:18:24] me now my husband will join with me oh
[1:18:27] because the Lord saw that I was hated
[1:18:29] now now constantly this is the burden
[1:18:33] this is the
[1:18:34] cry finally she gets to Judah and this
[1:18:38] is the first time she that she actually
[1:18:40] acknowledges the
[1:18:43] Lord and she conceived again and bear a
[1:18:45] son and she says
[1:18:47] now will I praise the
[1:18:51] Lord there therefore she called his name
[1:18:55] Judah and left baring now Judah is a
[1:18:58] very popular tribe if you follow that's
[1:19:01] the tribe that our lord Jesus comes
[1:19:03] through that's where the scepter is it's
[1:19:06] laying in that tribe and it looks like
[1:19:09] Jacob has done wrong and he probably is
[1:19:12] done wrong but God allowed it and all of
[1:19:18] these boys being born through Leah born
[1:19:22] through Rachel born through their hands
[1:19:24] Maids what's God doing he's building a
[1:19:28] nation he's building a
[1:19:31] people and the way brother random uh
[1:19:34] brings it to us it's so nice I've read
[1:19:36] it multiple times and I'll read it again
[1:19:39] for you this morning he said those labor
[1:19:42] pains that the Hebrew mothers were in
[1:19:45] the the conflict that they were in the
[1:19:49] stress that they were under caused this
[1:19:53] building of the house it wasn't all
[1:19:55] smiles it wasn't we all getting along
[1:19:58] together there's you know there's little
[1:20:01] little conflict little Envy little
[1:20:03] strife and God allows this and this is
[1:20:07] what happens when a woman is being ready
[1:20:11] to deliver a child they begin to time
[1:20:14] those birth pains brother vom takes the
[1:20:17] scripture St John 16 and as we read
[1:20:20] there and he preaches the message birth
[1:20:23] pains and remember that in this great uh
[1:20:28] Ministry that we're in today uh we're
[1:20:31] called to the
[1:20:32] adoption we're not called just to be
[1:20:34] church members we're called to this
[1:20:38] glorious adoption you say well what is
[1:20:40] the adoption it's mentioned a number of
[1:20:43] times in the scriptures Romans chapter 8
[1:20:46] Romans chapter 9 Galatians chapter 4
[1:20:51] Ephesians chap 1
[1:20:54] says having predestinated us unto the
[1:20:58] adoption of
[1:20:59] children by Jesus Christ so we know that
[1:21:04] our our our final inheritance for the
[1:21:08] believer as it pertains to our Earthly
[1:21:12] journey is an adoption and that adoption
[1:21:17] is actually the Redemption of our
[1:21:20] bodies our bodies are going to be
[1:21:23] redeemed praise the Lord now there is an
[1:21:26] adoption and that adoption Saints is for
[1:21:30] the
[1:21:31] believer now now whether we hear about
[1:21:34] it or whether we keep that as a goal or
[1:21:37] whether we read the quotes on it or the
[1:21:39] scriptures on it it's still a reality
[1:21:42] and that adoption is for believers
[1:21:46] that's our final you know Jesus was
[1:21:49] adopted on Mount
[1:21:51] Transfiguration hear ye him remember he
[1:21:55] had his Earthly Ministry just a regular
[1:21:57] preacher maybe just a man in the
[1:21:59] neighborhood that had gifts signs and
[1:22:01] wonders but we find out he's just not
[1:22:04] like any other preacher and then he
[1:22:06] prophesies thing that come to pass like
[1:22:08] any other Prophet then we find out he's
[1:22:10] not like any other Prophet then he makes
[1:22:14] claims that nobody else made he said you
[1:22:18] destroy this Temple I'll pick it back up
[1:22:21] again in three days days except you
[1:22:24] believe that I am he you will die in
[1:22:27] your
[1:22:29] sins I am my father are one who can make
[1:22:33] those claims nobody talk like that when
[1:22:36] you see me you see the father who can
[1:22:39] make those claims can nobody talk like
[1:22:41] that but Jesus and he had his ministry
[1:22:45] and his his work in his ministry grew up
[1:22:48] to the place where he had a great
[1:22:50] following lots of love lots of
[1:22:53] cheerfulness but then he started to
[1:22:55] bring the
[1:22:57] word and the word now starts to separate
[1:23:01] because there's a birth taking place let
[1:23:05] me take a few quotes here for you in the
[1:23:07] message
[1:23:08] adoption and this is the adoption number
[1:23:11] one paragraph number 48 I read it for
[1:23:13] you before I read it
[1:23:16] again so Ephesus here sets us like
[1:23:19] Joshua positionally you notice Joshua as
[1:23:23] after crossing over the land and taking
[1:23:25] the land then he divided the land
[1:23:28] Ephraim here manancis here this one here
[1:23:31] Gad here Benjamin here he divided the
[1:23:34] lands speaking about Joshua and notice
[1:23:37] oh this just burns our hearts each one
[1:23:41] of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to
[1:23:43] those children she spoke the very place
[1:23:47] in her labor pains where they would be
[1:23:50] positioned in the Promised Land oh it's
[1:23:53] great it's a great study if we only go
[1:23:56] into the details which would take hours
[1:23:58] and after hours someday when I get our
[1:24:01] church I'd like to come and take a solid
[1:24:03] month or two just stay right with it
[1:24:06] watch when each of those mothers when
[1:24:08] she called out Ephraim when she was in
[1:24:10] labor positionally placed him where his
[1:24:13] feet was setting in oil just exactly
[1:24:15] everyone of them wherever they were at
[1:24:18] and Joshua not knowing this but by
[1:24:21] inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after
[1:24:24] being in the promised land give each man
[1:24:28] his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[1:24:31] promised through the birth back there
[1:24:35] how that God has set some in the church
[1:24:38] who said it in the
[1:24:40] church talk to him about
[1:24:44] it God has set some in the church
[1:24:47] through the labor
[1:24:49] pains oh they get tremendous some times
[1:24:53] when the church is groaning under the
[1:24:56] persecution of the outside world
[1:24:58] Believing on the Lord Jesus that the
[1:25:01] promise of the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:25:03] real to us as it was to Pentecost how
[1:25:05] they groan and cry under labor pains but
[1:25:10] when they are born and positionally Born
[1:25:14] Into the kingdom of God then the Holy
[1:25:17] Ghost has set in the church some
[1:25:19] Apostles some prophets some teachers
[1:25:21] some pastors some evangelist then he
[1:25:23] gives in there speaking with tongues
[1:25:26] interpretation of tongues knowledge
[1:25:28] wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of
[1:25:31] Miracles now and brother man said this
[1:25:34] is my purpose of doing this the church
[1:25:36] is always trying to take somebody else's
[1:25:40] corner so now these gifts that brother
[1:25:43] Ram is talking about that God plac into
[1:25:46] the church they're always going to have
[1:25:49] conflict surrounding them there's always
[1:25:52] going to be misunderstanding around it
[1:25:55] there's always going to be those that
[1:25:57] want it those that don't want it and
[1:26:00] those that don't even
[1:26:01] care but God has placed this in his
[1:26:06] church he designed it he ordered it he
[1:26:10] put he puts the gifts in there and as we
[1:26:12] heard on Sunday night he expects us to
[1:26:16] respect them we don't understand them we
[1:26:19] don't even always agree with them but we
[1:26:22] respect
[1:26:24] them and with the conflict that surround
[1:26:29] the gifts all the time it's always been
[1:26:32] that way there's a group that wants to
[1:26:34] pull this way another one that says it's
[1:26:37] it's too messy it's not clean enough
[1:26:39] it's there's too much you know you got
[1:26:42] false spirits that get in there true you
[1:26:45] got people that don't have a gift and
[1:26:47] they say they do that's true that's
[1:26:49] everywhere you go you have people that
[1:26:51] are oper operating and say they're
[1:26:53] called and they're not really called
[1:26:55] that's true you have people that make a
[1:26:58] bad name for Christianity they get on
[1:27:01] the TV there and they represent
[1:27:03] Christianity and do things that's
[1:27:05] horrible and then and then it it causes
[1:27:08] others to stumble that's true but you
[1:27:11] still got to read what the Bible said
[1:27:14] the Bible said that God set some in the
[1:27:17] church and if God put them in there God
[1:27:21] is the one that taking care of his
[1:27:23] church it's not your church it's not my
[1:27:26] church it's God's church can I get a
[1:27:29] witness sir but through the labor pains
[1:27:33] through the Pains of
[1:27:36] criticism through the Pains of your life
[1:27:40] trying to draw closer to him you'll be
[1:27:43] criticized there's pains there's sorrow
[1:27:46] but through that there's a church being
[1:27:49] born there's a people there's a gift
[1:27:52] being developed you know it it's you
[1:27:56] know we we want we want to see the gift
[1:27:59] already
[1:28:01] perfected we want a 40y old preacher
[1:28:04] just to come out and no make no
[1:28:06] mistakes but you got little you got
[1:28:09] little junior junior preachers coming up
[1:28:12] right where where are they supposed to
[1:28:14] exercise their gift is there any Grace
[1:28:18] for
[1:28:19] them oh we we I can't sit listen to him
[1:28:22] because I know more than him my
[1:28:25] goodness is that how you raise your
[1:28:28] children is that how you build a young
[1:28:30] man in your home is that how you treat
[1:28:33] somebody how to ride a bicycle or let
[1:28:36] alone um handle any kind of
[1:28:40] responsibility I mean are they going to
[1:28:42] be Flawless without
[1:28:44] mistake so it creates this
[1:28:47] fear that nobody wants to even
[1:28:51] try
[1:28:52] to exercise even an inkling of a gift
[1:28:56] that their Heavenly Father might be
[1:28:58] leading
[1:28:59] them to go forward under this gift but
[1:29:03] if I make a mistake then I got a false
[1:29:05] anointing on me so I'll just sit back in
[1:29:08] my Pew and do nothing like everybody
[1:29:11] else is doing nothing but I'm so glad
[1:29:14] that the Holy Ghost knows how to call a
[1:29:18] man and God doesn't call Men by us other
[1:29:22] men he calls Men by
[1:29:25] himself he knows where you live he knows
[1:29:29] how to get a hold of you he knows how to
[1:29:32] minister to you and speak to you where
[1:29:35] you know it's him and he'll put a fire
[1:29:39] in your
[1:29:40] bones and you say it's like fire shut up
[1:29:43] in my bones I can't keep quiet I got to
[1:29:46] tell somebody the Milkman I got to tell
[1:29:48] somebody the grocery store I got to tell
[1:29:50] somebody that's that's what God
[1:29:53] does now
[1:29:55] man they want to do the choosing and the
[1:29:59] picking but I'm so glad that God does
[1:30:02] this and so it's through these birth
[1:30:05] pains that we see um that God
[1:30:09] allows this Dynamic of this house to be
[1:30:14] built now in the adoption I want to talk
[1:30:18] on that just for a
[1:30:20] moment this is should be a goal for
[1:30:25] every
[1:30:28] believer it's part
[1:30:30] of what the statue of a perfect man was
[1:30:33] all
[1:30:34] about you remember the the message we
[1:30:37] were uh ask you all to listen to the
[1:30:39] Statue of a perfect man and blasphemous
[1:30:41] names how many remember
[1:30:44] that couple of you
[1:30:47] remember statue of a perfect man it's
[1:30:50] really a message of about the history of
[1:30:53] the church it's a message about the ages
[1:30:56] of the church it's a message about you
[1:31:00] the
[1:31:00] believer and this is the building up in
[1:31:04] these virtues in second Peter chapter 1
[1:31:07] that Peter says that that you be not
[1:31:12] Barren or
[1:31:14] unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord
[1:31:18] that you'll be fruitful that your your
[1:31:21] life will not be Barren as it pertains
[1:31:24] to the things of the Lord now in the
[1:31:28] adoption just want to touch on that just
[1:31:30] a little
[1:31:34] bit of course we know there's a ceremony
[1:31:37] that takes
[1:31:39] place
[1:31:41] and the the son is born into a family
[1:31:46] and that family Paul talks about it in
[1:31:48] the scriptures I gave you four or five
[1:31:50] different places Galatians r Roman and
[1:31:52] Ephesians talks about that that how a
[1:31:55] son is Born Into the family but he's
[1:31:58] placed under tutors and under the
[1:32:00] tutorship he's growing he's always a son
[1:32:04] because of the birth he was born in that
[1:32:06] family then he gets to a place where he
[1:32:09] now takes on more responsibility he's a
[1:32:12] son but now he's a mature
[1:32:15] son and the prophet of God deals with
[1:32:18] this in a couple of messages I just want
[1:32:20] to touch those to bring our mind to what
[1:32:23] our goals should be and what we should
[1:32:25] be looking forward to in the message
[1:32:27] everlasting life and how to receive it
[1:32:30] the prophet of God says this here
[1:32:32] paragraph number 110 and now when the
[1:32:35] Pentecostal church and these people in
[1:32:37] the last days here has begun to find the
[1:32:41] new birth being born again they thought
[1:32:44] that settled it no sir your ups and
[1:32:48] downs ins and outs and things like that
[1:32:52] God can't place you as a son but when
[1:32:56] you stay in the Kingdom stay in the
[1:32:59] gospel stay night one of these days or
[1:33:03] stay right one of these days God will
[1:33:05] call you out and set you aside adopt you
[1:33:09] as his son before the people and give
[1:33:12] you something that will shake the
[1:33:14] nations with it see what I mean it's the
[1:33:17] adoption into the
[1:33:20] family
[1:33:22] prophet of God continues in the message
[1:33:24] the position of a Believer paragraph
[1:33:27] number 50 he says this here now into his
[1:33:30] church you that's positionally he seated
[1:33:33] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus be
[1:33:36] humble Brethren someday the holy spirit
[1:33:39] will speak to you call you out to one
[1:33:42] side somewhere in a little cabin on the
[1:33:45] hillside or in the washroom somewhere
[1:33:49] and there will anoint you you for a
[1:33:52] certain service or a certain thing to do
[1:33:57] it won't be the laying hands of the
[1:33:58] prors or Elders it'll be the laying
[1:34:01] hands of God Almighty himself to put a
[1:34:05] new ministry in you and a new robe on
[1:34:09] you and set you out as an example all
[1:34:13] the demons out of Torment will never
[1:34:15] upset you God grant my brethren that
[1:34:18] will each one receive this
[1:34:22] blessing amen can the church say amen
[1:34:25] amen Prophet continues in the message
[1:34:29] the position of a Believer he continues
[1:34:31] on in paragraph
[1:34:34] number
[1:34:36] 20
[1:34:40] 4 now this epistle the letter to the
[1:34:42] Ephesians was written to Believers not
[1:34:45] to the outside world this is Believers
[1:34:49] that's why I thought this afternoon
[1:34:51] first I test and see if there's groups
[1:34:55] of
[1:34:56] unbelievers and sinners then I couldn't
[1:34:59] speak on this here but now seeing that
[1:35:01] it is for the Believers and the
[1:35:04] Believers are present I thought it would
[1:35:06] be good if we let the believer see where
[1:35:09] he is now try hard Christians to
[1:35:14] understand that this day that the
[1:35:16] message has been placing the believer in
[1:35:20] position of
[1:35:23] place if every believer in here was in
[1:35:26] their place well I'm so thankful that
[1:35:28] we're their whole rows of wheelchairs
[1:35:31] set there's only about two or three left
[1:35:33] in here if every believer knew their
[1:35:36] place lady on aot the man with the
[1:35:38] crutches along there there would not be
[1:35:41] a feeble person in this building in the
[1:35:43] next 20 minutes that's right if every
[1:35:46] man could simply find his place his or
[1:35:50] her place in Christ Jesus what a
[1:35:53] difference it would make now I know
[1:35:56] people filled your mind rolling fast now
[1:36:00] uh brother bam continues on paragraph 29
[1:36:02] now the Holy Ghost will heal every
[1:36:04] person in here if your work according to
[1:36:07] the plan and will uh the plan and will
[1:36:11] of the Holy scriptures there's not
[1:36:13] enough there there's enough Christians
[1:36:17] in this city today enough Christians in
[1:36:20] this building today to close the heavens
[1:36:23] over Phoenix did you know that but you
[1:36:27] got to work according to the will of the
[1:36:31] spirit now that's what we're trying to
[1:36:33] do today is to place the believer in his
[1:36:36] right position so he can see where he's
[1:36:39] at how you going to do just running away
[1:36:43] you're just beating the air you get what
[1:36:45] I mean so the prophet is telling us that
[1:36:48] if the believer each believer can find
[1:36:50] their position
[1:36:52] then there wouldn't be a feeble one
[1:36:54] among us we would know where we stand
[1:36:57] the the presence of the Lord would would
[1:37:00] be there if we can find our place and
[1:37:05] what places us the word of God places us
[1:37:09] the message of the hour places us it
[1:37:12] shows us where to stand and how we ought
[1:37:15] to stand the prophet of God
[1:37:18] continues in the message
[1:37:25] hear ye
[1:37:27] him paragraph 112 he says this
[1:37:31] here now you love the Lord this morning
[1:37:35] said let's drop back time's about gone
[1:37:37] but I want to get something to you Peter
[1:37:39] got all excited the supernatural had
[1:37:41] been done there stood Moses and Elijah
[1:37:44] both been dead for years here they were
[1:37:47] standing alive standing there with Jesus
[1:37:50] Witnesses two of the mightiest prophets
[1:37:53] That Ever Walked the Earth standing by
[1:37:55] the side to watch God adopt his son and
[1:37:59] give him all the powers in the heavens
[1:38:01] and the Earth give in unto his hands so
[1:38:04] he's talking about Matthew chapter 17
[1:38:06] where the Lord was transfigured before
[1:38:09] Peter James and John and there stood
[1:38:11] Moses and Elijah on Mount
[1:38:13] Transfiguration this is a scripture he's
[1:38:15] referring to two of the mightiest
[1:38:17] prophets standing by each side of him he
[1:38:20] says
[1:38:24] give him all the powers in the heavens
[1:38:25] and earth give unto his hands and he
[1:38:27] will do for you the same if you'll stand
[1:38:32] after you receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:38:35] make yourself a Christian and act like a
[1:38:37] Christian should if you put your face in
[1:38:41] God's word and your eyes towards heaven
[1:38:44] and let your pants legs be bagged at the
[1:38:47] knees be reverent before God there'll be
[1:38:51] someday that God will take you over to a
[1:38:54] side over to a side one where and give
[1:38:58] to you a power and a gift that the whole
[1:39:02] world will know he's been with you
[1:39:05] that's placing a son to his position
[1:39:09] hallelujah oh I feel religious right now
[1:39:12] yes he'll do it he promised it he's the
[1:39:16] unfailing god well the church has missed
[1:39:19] it just saying well I spoke with tongues
[1:39:22] I got it now you just got started sure
[1:39:26] that's the reason today we find people
[1:39:27] so against the supernatural against the
[1:39:30] things of God is because they've been
[1:39:33] disobedient if they had lived up in that
[1:39:36] realm where they should be they
[1:39:38] recognize those
[1:39:41] things so here the prophet is absolutely
[1:39:45] absolutely placing this adoption in our
[1:39:49] hands today amen
[1:39:51] now are you adopted and
[1:39:53] placed that's a good question for each
[1:39:56] of you or do you know of anyone that has
[1:40:00] been in this
[1:40:03] age I've often this is my own personal
[1:40:06] opinion I've always I've often referred
[1:40:08] to our dear brother Billy Paul I
[1:40:10] believed he was adopted in placed I do
[1:40:14] that's my personal opinion I saw the
[1:40:16] life he Liv I saw the ministry he had
[1:40:19] and God used him
[1:40:22] has a tremendous
[1:40:25] witness is that right Saints when he
[1:40:29] told the stories he brought you to where
[1:40:32] the story took place you can feel he's
[1:40:35] telling the truth that was absolutely
[1:40:38] the placing of God I believe that I
[1:40:40] believe that now do we know of other
[1:40:43] believers that have been adopted in the
[1:40:45] scriptures do we find this terminology
[1:40:48] now well not so much we don't see that
[1:40:50] terminology so much but brother bam here
[1:40:53] gives us this example of Jesus being
[1:40:55] adopted and placed on Mount
[1:40:59] Transfiguration when the voice Cried Out
[1:41:02] hear ye him and from there he had a
[1:41:07] short quick work from there to
[1:41:10] Calvary now he always manifest the the
[1:41:14] the signs and wonders and miracles but
[1:41:16] his ministry got to the place where it's
[1:41:18] now being crowned and capped to its full
[1:41:24] maturity now for our age and this is not
[1:41:28] my opinion this is a fact I believe
[1:41:31] maybe it's still my
[1:41:33] opinion I believe this Bible is true
[1:41:35] that's my opinion but I believe it's a
[1:41:37] fact too but I believe that brother
[1:41:40] brandham was adopted in place and I read
[1:41:43] some quotations for you here in just a
[1:41:46] moment but you know this this new birth
[1:41:50] and then this sealing of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:52] and being sealed for um for for the
[1:41:58] great body change that's going to take
[1:42:00] place that's what we're headed to as a
[1:42:02] body change to with the Redemption of
[1:42:04] our bodies the oldness of our bodies
[1:42:08] will vanish away we'll receive a healing
[1:42:11] like never
[1:42:13] before and you talk about a new birth
[1:42:15] you're talking about moving from one
[1:42:18] stage to the next as vam tells us we're
[1:42:22] birthed into each of those virtues
[1:42:25] there's a birth here a birth here a
[1:42:26] birth here first you're born into the
[1:42:29] family by the Holy Ghost that's the new
[1:42:32] birth you're a Christian but now you
[1:42:35] have to walk
[1:42:36] circumspectly and you have to add to
[1:42:38] your faith virtue and add to your virtue
[1:42:42] knowledge and Temperance and all of
[1:42:44] those godliness and patience and
[1:42:48] brotherly kindness and then be capped
[1:42:51] with the love of God and then be ready
[1:42:54] for the
[1:42:56] Rapture this is a this is a this is a
[1:42:59] work that we we're all in this work
[1:43:02] we're all you know looking in the mirror
[1:43:05] of our of the word of God to find out
[1:43:08] where we are in this pyramid where where
[1:43:11] am I at
[1:43:13] Lord is there another birth another
[1:43:16] baptism for
[1:43:18] me brother bam says and here himm 1960
[1:43:22] says paragraph 38 placing of a son take
[1:43:25] him out in a certain place have a
[1:43:28] ceremony before the Angels Place him
[1:43:31] positionally positionally what he is in
[1:43:33] the body of Christ then that person has
[1:43:37] the
[1:43:39] authority let me say this if you count
[1:43:42] me a fanatic from this night on that
[1:43:45] very same thing that I'm speaking of
[1:43:48] will be
[1:43:49] done there will be a power put into the
[1:43:53] church and now it's coming in that the
[1:43:56] Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people
[1:43:59] till they'll speak the word and it'll
[1:44:02] create itself right there we haven't
[1:44:06] seen Powers likes coming into the church
[1:44:09] now I know it for a fact say to this
[1:44:13] mountain be moved now are you looking
[1:44:16] for that
[1:44:18] power uh-huh
[1:44:21] he continues on in the message here hym
[1:44:23] 1960 in
[1:44:25] July paragraph number 64 what God wants
[1:44:29] to do with this church tonight wants to
[1:44:31] do with the individual is find
[1:44:35] somebody finding the holy spirit is
[1:44:38] searching to find
[1:44:40] men he can take him out to a certain
[1:44:43] place speak to that person anoint them
[1:44:46] and give them something
[1:44:49] special great powers and gifts to work
[1:44:52] his will and to do his will but how can
[1:44:56] he do it when he's constantly has to
[1:44:57] come up and say oh it's terrible they
[1:45:00] just they just run after this they run
[1:45:02] after error they won't go to church they
[1:45:05] they look what a condition the church is
[1:45:07] in so if God can't do it to the body he
[1:45:12] will pick out individuals and do it
[1:45:17] God's able of these stones to rise
[1:45:19] children unto AB
[1:45:21] Abraham so it's no longer waiting for
[1:45:24] the group to get
[1:45:25] ready he will pick individuals
[1:45:29] out and
[1:45:31] perform this adoption ceremony upon
[1:45:36] them now that's what we're looking for
[1:45:40] that's what we long for this is this is
[1:45:44] not just being born again we thank God
[1:45:47] for the new birth and born again we
[1:45:49] thank God for receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:45:51] but it's baptism upon baptism upon
[1:45:54] baptism of that same holy ghost that
[1:45:58] caps the believer and seals him and
[1:46:02] places him yes sir don't you thank the
[1:46:05] Lord for
[1:46:07] that now
[1:46:10] this this adoption is spoken
[1:46:13] of and as brother Brandon brings that
[1:46:15] message statue of a perfect man he
[1:46:17] brings that were birth into this we're
[1:46:20] birth into this we're birth into this
[1:46:23] and what is a birth a birth is a
[1:46:28] changing you're leaving one world to go
[1:46:31] into
[1:46:32] another that the ninth month that that
[1:46:36] child has been forming in the womb and
[1:46:39] then now it's going to be birthed
[1:46:42] into a a outside world that he knows
[1:46:46] nothing
[1:46:47] about it's a timing Port if it is timing
[1:46:51] it's the health of that child and of the
[1:46:54] mother it's nature taking its
[1:46:58] course there's going to be sorrow
[1:47:00] there's going to be pain but when the
[1:47:04] birth takes place we'll all be happy and
[1:47:08] joy will fill all of those that are a
[1:47:11] part of it after it takes
[1:47:15] place this birth these birth pains these
[1:47:19] are these are uh uh what God allows this
[1:47:25] just as he did with Jacob and Esau take
[1:47:27] one scripture in Genesis 25 we turn
[1:47:30] there
[1:47:41] quickly so we see how the Lord built the
[1:47:44] house of Israel with Rachel
[1:47:48] Leah billah and handmaids and so
[1:47:52] forth they were built up that way
[1:47:55] believe Joseph
[1:47:57] had a wife from Pharaoh he had Ephraim
[1:48:01] and manasse and that those tribes were
[1:48:03] built up from this birth and Genesis CH
[1:48:07] 25 and verse number
[1:48:10] 19 says this
[1:48:14] here these are the generation of Isaac
[1:48:17] Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac and
[1:48:19] Isaac was 40 years old when he took
[1:48:21] Rebecca to wife the daughter of bethu
[1:48:25] the Syrian of Pam Aram sister to laan
[1:48:29] the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord
[1:48:32] for his wife because she was Barren and
[1:48:35] the Lord was intreated of him and
[1:48:38] Rebecca his wife
[1:48:40] conceived and the children struggled
[1:48:43] within her and she said if it be so why
[1:48:46] am I thus and she went to inquire of the
[1:48:49] Lord and the Lord said unto her two
[1:48:52] nations are in thy womb two manner of
[1:48:54] people shall be separated from thy vows
[1:48:58] and the one people shall be stronger
[1:49:00] than the other people and the Elder
[1:49:03] Shall Serve the
[1:49:06] younger so
[1:49:08] first this
[1:49:11] barrenness is one of the curses that
[1:49:15] many times many times is a
[1:49:17] curse that God will put on
[1:49:21] a woman that she can't have
[1:49:23] children cuz he's correcting her the
[1:49:26] case with David's wife Michel when she
[1:49:29] cursed him and spoke against him
[1:49:33] dancing and doing what he did the Lord
[1:49:36] caused this barrenness to to strike her
[1:49:40] but in Exodus
[1:49:42] 34 um Exodus 23 rather one of the
[1:49:46] blessings for the children of Israel was
[1:49:49] that they would not be Barren
[1:49:51] Deuteronomy
[1:49:52] 7:14 says that there will be no Barren
[1:49:56] men or women among you and so it was
[1:50:01] part of the blessing of the Lord was to
[1:50:05] cause fruitfulness not just in the land
[1:50:10] with the trees that you're growing not
[1:50:12] just in the animal herds that you're
[1:50:14] raising but amongst you and your wife
[1:50:19] and your son's wife wife and your
[1:50:20] daughter's husband and the family
[1:50:23] structure there is a blessing in this
[1:50:27] birth actually we're going to build our
[1:50:31] family through the
[1:50:33] birth and this is that's in the natural
[1:50:36] Israel in the spiritual side God builds
[1:50:40] the church through the
[1:50:43] birth it's the new
[1:50:46] birth
[1:50:47] and the growth of any Church the real
[1:50:51] growth of a church I'm not talking about
[1:50:53] numbers of people but I'm talking about
[1:50:56] the births that take place in that
[1:51:00] church that that is dependent upon that
[1:51:04] growth is dependent upon births taking
[1:51:08] place in the
[1:51:10] church you see a church that doesn't
[1:51:12] grow it's Barren it's hit a dead end
[1:51:17] it's
[1:51:18] stagnant it's because the people in
[1:51:20] there at hit a dead end they're
[1:51:23] stagnant and it's not about old people
[1:51:26] or young people it's about not producing
[1:51:30] fruit and when you stop growing that's a
[1:51:35] problem when you stop bearing fruit then
[1:51:38] that's a problem and the answer to this
[1:51:41] is to have these virtues in you that you
[1:51:44] will not be Barren or unfruitful and
[1:51:47] these virtues come into you
[1:51:50] Birth by birth by birth by birth and
[1:51:54] it's sad that many Christians come to
[1:51:57] church they reach a plateau in their
[1:52:00] Revelation they reach a stagnant in
[1:52:03] their service to God they used to
[1:52:06] witness but they don't do that anymore
[1:52:09] they used to study but they study that
[1:52:11] subject already they used to be
[1:52:15] enthused with the word enthused with the
[1:52:19] message but but now it's become how long
[1:52:22] we going to be there or what can we be
[1:52:24] entertained by is the pastor funny
[1:52:27] enough or do we have cookies and coffee
[1:52:30] at the end of the service what can they
[1:52:32] give us for entertainment is there a
[1:52:35] basketball team that I can join what can
[1:52:38] I do what can I it's like it's become a
[1:52:40] lodge or some kind of game that we play
[1:52:43] when really the church is born it grows
[1:52:47] through the birth and if there is no
[1:52:50] birth then you need to be like Isaac and
[1:52:53] entreat the
[1:52:55] Lord for my wife Rebecca she can't have
[1:52:59] no children Lord what's going on here he
[1:53:02] entreated the Lord and the Lord heard
[1:53:05] him and opened up her womb heard Rachel
[1:53:09] open up her womb he'll hear
[1:53:12] you and birth into you a life something
[1:53:17] different than where you are now
[1:53:20] you've hit a dead end you had a coldest
[1:53:23] sack and you've parked there and you're
[1:53:26] okay you're familiar everything is safe
[1:53:29] everything is comfortable you know the
[1:53:31] neighbors they know you but maybe God
[1:53:33] wants you out of that neighborhood go
[1:53:36] down a street you never been down before
[1:53:38] talk to somebody you wouldn't think of
[1:53:40] talking to before and let some
[1:53:42] excitement handle your
[1:53:45] life you say well if that happens I'll
[1:53:47] lose control exactly
[1:53:50] you need to lose
[1:53:53] control that mother giving birth to that
[1:53:56] baby it's all about the
[1:53:59] birth a lot going on
[1:54:02] there and this birth needs to take place
[1:54:05] in the individual's life now these two
[1:54:09] boys are represented here in the Old
[1:54:12] Testament Esau and Jacob they come from
[1:54:14] the same mother same father but they're
[1:54:18] actually struggling in the womb before
[1:54:21] we get to Genesis 2 finish up Genesis 25
[1:54:25] let's run over to Romans chapter9
[1:54:29] quickly and let's see what the Bible
[1:54:31] says about them Romans 9 and verse
[1:54:34] number
[1:54:48] 11
[1:54:50] and the Bible says for the
[1:54:52] children being not yet born neither
[1:54:56] having done any good or evil that the
[1:54:59] purpose of God according to election
[1:55:03] might stand not of works but of him that
[1:55:05] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[1:55:08] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[1:55:12] Jacob have I love but Esau have I
[1:55:16] hated now look at that there
[1:55:20] it was God's purpose he did it on
[1:55:23] purpose it is his purpose to allow this
[1:55:26] to take place just like with Leah and
[1:55:28] Rachel it's God's purpose he purposed
[1:55:32] that Joseph would be gifted and he knew
[1:55:37] that Joseph's gifts would be the problem
[1:55:40] his brothers would have with him is that
[1:55:45] right let me take one quote for you in
[1:55:47] the Statue of a perfect man here quickly
[1:55:49] while I'm on on that
[1:55:52] point paragraph number
[1:55:56] 79 statue of a perfect man look at
[1:55:59] Joseph born a spiritual boy among a
[1:56:03] bunch of Brethren they were all good men
[1:56:07] all of them Patriarchs but when Joseph
[1:56:10] come he was different he could see
[1:56:13] Visions interpret dreams he was hated of
[1:56:17] his Brethren because of that
[1:56:20] because of the very work that God had
[1:56:22] put him on Earth to
[1:56:24] do his brothers hated him for it see and
[1:56:29] it was all pointing to Christ and look
[1:56:32] he was sold for almost 30 pieces of
[1:56:34] silver by his Brethren thrown into a
[1:56:36] ditch to be dead by his Brethren was
[1:56:39] took up from that ditch went and sat on
[1:56:41] the right hand of pharaoh and no man
[1:56:43] could come to pharaoh who controlled the
[1:56:45] world of that day no one could come to
[1:56:47] Pharaoh only through through Joseph so
[1:56:51] that was Joseph's purpose his whole
[1:56:54] purpose in life was to
[1:56:57] preserve and extend the life of his
[1:56:59] Brethren so what does God do God gives
[1:57:02] him a gift gives him a calling gives him
[1:57:05] a revelation gives him birth gives him
[1:57:08] fertility blesses him anoints him and
[1:57:11] with any gift any calling you're going
[1:57:13] to have those that Envy you the young
[1:57:17] people call them haters
[1:57:20] you going to have the haters now because
[1:57:24] of the
[1:57:25] gift and it was God who gave it to him
[1:57:29] because he gave it to him because that
[1:57:30] was his
[1:57:31] purpose and we see that repeat again
[1:57:36] even today look at even with with with
[1:57:40] Joseph he he goes down as a slave
[1:57:43] remember he enters Egypt probably less
[1:57:46] valuable just a slave like any other
[1:57:48] slave but let let him keep living now
[1:57:51] let those dreams begin to happen and we
[1:57:54] see his value begin to raise even though
[1:57:57] he's a slave he's in potterer house he
[1:57:59] don't own nothing he's just a slave but
[1:58:03] God is with him and God is anointing him
[1:58:06] and as God is blessing him and anointing
[1:58:09] him you don't need everybody to like you
[1:58:11] you don't even need to be free you don't
[1:58:14] need a background of this and the
[1:58:16] history of that all you need is the
[1:58:18] favor of the Lord and he was in Piper's
[1:58:22] house a slave and God is raising him up
[1:58:24] raising him up raising him up and then
[1:58:27] the men saw the anointing on him and
[1:58:30] they recognize him others see the
[1:58:32] anointing they recognize him and here
[1:58:35] Satan pulls him down throws him back
[1:58:37] into prison again here he's in prison
[1:58:40] now and he's in prison just being who he
[1:58:43] is still gifted still anointed and God
[1:58:46] starts to work with him in prison work
[1:58:49] says it's not what you know it's who you
[1:58:52] know that's exactly the truth if you
[1:58:54] know him and he knows you that's all you
[1:58:57] need to know that's all the blessing you
[1:59:00] need in your
[1:59:01] life in prison okay we'll make you in
[1:59:04] charge of these prisoners yeah we know
[1:59:06] you're innocent we all innocent too wink
[1:59:08] wink raising them up raising them up two
[1:59:12] men have a dream tells a dream remember
[1:59:15] me the dream comes to pass they forget
[1:59:17] about him two years pass tell
[1:59:19] if anybody could be bitter it could be
[1:59:22] Joseph he did nothing wrong he's serving
[1:59:25] time in a foreign land no birthday
[1:59:29] parties no family members no family
[1:59:33] visits hasn't seen his daddy for years
[1:59:37] but yet he kept his Integrity kept his
[1:59:40] testimony kept his name before God
[1:59:43] spotless I won't do that because it's
[1:59:47] God that I'm serving what God what kind
[1:59:49] of God you serving you got God in your
[1:59:52] life look where you at you in prison
[1:59:54] like the rest of us we're bums and
[1:59:57] you're a bum with us but no no no I'm
[2:00:00] gifted I'm anointed I feel his presence
[2:00:04] in my life and I'm going to be what God
[2:00:06] called me to be and God rais him up
[2:00:09] raise him up and then
[2:00:11] finally his day comes calls him out of
[2:00:14] the prison interprets the dream
[2:00:18] overnight
[2:00:19] the shift the wealth of Joseph shifted
[2:00:23] overnight and look at the wealth how God
[2:00:26] Did It He blesses Joseph and by blessing
[2:00:30] Joseph He blesses Egypt and Egypt
[2:00:33] increases in wealth increases in wealth
[2:00:37] increases in dries up all the other
[2:00:40] lands and No Other Nation like Egypt and
[2:00:42] Joseph's right on the top of all of
[2:00:44] it saves his daddy his mother another
[2:00:48] Pharaoh comes that doesn't know Joseph
[2:00:51] and they go after the Jews and so now
[2:00:54] the persecution starts and it's wealthy
[2:00:58] great economy very valuable lots of
[2:01:02] money all the wealth because Joseph
[2:01:04] interpreted a
[2:01:07] dream but now God's going to shift all
[2:01:09] that wealth back to the Jews Now isn't
[2:01:11] he what does he do he raises up a Moses
[2:01:15] amongst them and all that wealth is now
[2:01:18] transferred in him now look at same
[2:01:20] thing happened with Jacob notice Jacob
[2:01:22] when he comes to laan he's after his
[2:01:26] family he's running from Esau he's a
[2:01:29] slave in his own land you'd say can't go
[2:01:32] back home Esau wants to kill him he
[2:01:34] shows up nothing broke know a few
[2:01:37] servants a few this and that but he is
[2:01:40] blessed now he got this Daddy's blessing
[2:01:43] upon him he's still got that name issue
[2:01:46] he's a deceiver now but he's blessed and
[2:01:48] his heart is right and that's what God
[2:01:51] was looking at God was looking at his
[2:01:54] heart he took that birth right and there
[2:01:57] that birth begin to make him a new man
[2:02:00] here he is working working working and
[2:02:03] as Jacob is blessed his father-in-law
[2:02:06] and all of his house is blessed all the
[2:02:09] cattle being begin to grow and Leon and
[2:02:12] Rachel and he has Joseph he says I got
[2:02:14] to get out of here he leaves out of
[2:02:16] there and hear the persecution begins to
[2:02:19] start with him and we see this in the
[2:02:22] life and the ministry of our Lord Jesus
[2:02:25] remember he came along illegitimate
[2:02:28] birth bad name on him but he was
[2:02:30] anointed though and that anointing led
[2:02:32] him and he grew in the power of the
[2:02:34] spirit the people packed out to hear him
[2:02:36] preach he laid hands on the sick they
[2:02:39] recovered he raised the dead and his
[2:02:41] ministry grew and grew until they turned
[2:02:44] on him and that happens to any gift or
[2:02:49] any anointing they will turn because
[2:02:53] there's two Spirits working in the realm
[2:02:56] of the church realm we see it happen in
[2:02:59] the life and Ministry of brother
[2:03:00] brandham same thing first pool right
[2:03:04] look at his birth you know dad was a
[2:03:07] this and that in his family background
[2:03:09] drunkers and Bootleggers but God chose
[2:03:11] him out of that and then Rose him up
[2:03:13] didn't know who he was after a while we
[2:03:15] find out who he is he's raised up come
[2:03:18] preach for for us come for us raise them
[2:03:20] up power of the spirit gifts like we've
[2:03:23] never seen before who can replace it
[2:03:26] today they can't they're still looking
[2:03:28] for a reason or somebody to take his
[2:03:30] place a a benie hen or another Reverend
[2:03:33] so and so TD Jake or another gifted
[2:03:36] whoever and whatever and they fall like
[2:03:38] you know you know their Folly is made
[2:03:41] known but here clean
[2:03:43] life raised in the power of the spirit
[2:03:46] everybody wanted to have him until he
[2:03:48] started to bring the word and now that
[2:03:52] rub and that edge and that fight begins
[2:03:55] and why is that this happens because
[2:03:59] those two boys are represented in good
[2:04:04] and in evil and that is what's what's in
[2:04:09] the church today I'm going to close with
[2:04:12] this right here and this is very this is
[2:04:14] a reality of what we're fighting against
[2:04:17] you know it's always you see some kind
[2:04:20] of blessing or some kind of growth you
[2:04:22] see your heart trying to do what's right
[2:04:25] and you'll make an effort for God before
[2:04:27] God and you try to go forward and do
[2:04:29] what's right and it's like the enemy
[2:04:31] comes after you it's like it was better
[2:04:35] for you not to even try it
[2:04:37] seems it gets more tense full more
[2:04:41] stressful he preach on the Holy Ghost it
[2:04:44] looks like it gets harder to preach on
[2:04:46] it and people clam up even even more and
[2:04:49] you play the tape and you listen to the
[2:04:51] tape but the pressures of the world are
[2:04:53] still there what's taking
[2:04:56] place well we hope it's a
[2:04:59] birth that's taking place for your
[2:05:02] sorrow will be turned into
[2:05:06] Joy you take a stand for what's right
[2:05:09] don't matter what happens in your life
[2:05:11] you take a stand for what is right and
[2:05:15] the joy is on its
[2:05:17] way amen
[2:05:19] amen so the prophet of God says it like
[2:05:21] this I take 15 minutes okay it's only
[2:05:25] 11:45 for those of you that need to
[2:05:28] know I just said it so cuz we both know
[2:05:31] I know what time it is I know you know
[2:05:33] what time it is but you don't know if I
[2:05:35] know what time it is I know what time it
[2:05:37] is and it's not that
[2:05:40] late can I get a
[2:05:42] witness
[2:05:44] amen here what the prophet of God says
[2:05:47] here in this message hearing and
[2:05:50] recognizing and acting upon the word
[2:05:52] paragraph number nine now we are fully
[2:05:57] acquainted we people who search the
[2:06:00] scriptures day and night and read our
[2:06:02] papers and hear the news commentators
[2:06:05] that this world is now standing in the
[2:06:09] grip of two great spiritual
[2:06:13] forces and they are both religious
[2:06:16] forces and I believe that these great
[2:06:19] forces are soon coming to a head and
[2:06:23] both of these great forces was
[2:06:26] represented in these two sons of
[2:06:29] Isaac how that God in his infinite
[2:06:32] wisdom has foreshadowed all things to us
[2:06:36] that we might by these things know of a
[2:06:40] certain what lays before us made it so
[2:06:43] plain that God in his word and the
[2:06:45] nature and this universe is so perfectly
[2:06:48] arranged together that even The Sinner
[2:06:50] can see something is fixing to take
[2:06:53] place God Is So arranged it no one is
[2:06:57] without excuse now we see in these two
[2:07:00] sons that when they before they were
[2:07:02] even born they were at war with one
[2:07:06] another even though their virgin mother
[2:07:09] for she was a virgin the beautiful
[2:07:11] Rebecca that married the righteous seed
[2:07:13] of God's promise Isaac that they were
[2:07:17] too consecrated
[2:07:19] spirit filled Believers of God on God
[2:07:23] for ordained to the very marriage that
[2:07:25] they were United together by God fornew
[2:07:28] it and how could such a thing come
[2:07:31] through one mother by one father one a
[2:07:36] very evil person the other another one
[2:07:38] very good person how did that good
[2:07:40] person look to be evil and the evil look
[2:07:44] to be the
[2:07:46] good we would know today as the law of
[2:07:50] contrast that where there is good there
[2:07:53] is evil where there is right there is
[2:07:56] wrong and we will never no matter what
[2:07:58] our environment may be ever be able to
[2:08:02] shake ourselves from the presence of
[2:08:09] either because Paul said when I would do
[2:08:12] good then evil is present The Sinner
[2:08:14] will never be able to shake away from
[2:08:17] the Christian the Christian from The
[2:08:19] Sinner there will be a witness there of
[2:08:23] right and a testimony of wrong always
[2:08:26] and you make your choice you have to
[2:08:29] take one side or the other amen can you
[2:08:33] say praise the Lord
[2:08:37] Amen brother bam goes on in that message
[2:08:39] and he says that they the spirit one was
[2:08:42] uh the spirit of that one birth is still
[2:08:45] represented in the world today it's
[2:08:47] coming to to ahead paragraph 20 now the
[2:08:50] spiritual believer and the carnal man
[2:08:53] the carnal believer no one can say that
[2:08:56] they wasn't both religious they were
[2:08:58] they didn't say that one served an idol
[2:09:00] the other one God they were both
[2:09:03] Servants of God now pay close attention
[2:09:05] to the scriptures now on this subject
[2:09:08] because I sure it'll help you see not
[2:09:11] everyone that sayth Lord Lord will enter
[2:09:13] in but the one that doeth the will of My
[2:09:16] Father which is in heaven now you know
[2:09:18] notice Jacob had one thing he wanted
[2:09:21] because according to the word the
[2:09:23] blessings and the good thing laid in the
[2:09:26] birthright and Jacob was his only object
[2:09:30] that was his only objective the only
[2:09:32] thing he had in his mind was get that
[2:09:36] Birthright Esau despised it the one that
[2:09:40] actually had it despised it and he was a
[2:09:43] he was
[2:09:44] a oh excuse me
[2:09:56] Esau despised it the one that actually
[2:09:58] had it despised it or he was ashamed of
[2:10:00] it but Jo Jacob wanted it regardless of
[2:10:03] how he got it he wanted it that's the
[2:10:06] way with the spiritual believer today he
[2:10:10] doesn't care how much you laugh at him
[2:10:13] how much fun you make how ridiculous he
[2:10:16] has to act to the carnal mind
[2:10:18] his only objective is the birthright he
[2:10:23] wants to get to God cuz it's born in him
[2:10:27] he can't help
[2:10:29] it is that where you
[2:10:32] are is that where you stand as a
[2:10:35] Believer how many of you could backslide
[2:10:38] if you wanted to how many can just up
[2:10:41] and leave you can't if you're a True
[2:10:43] Believer you just can't this is this is
[2:10:45] what you are this is who you are
[2:10:48] and all all the believer is concerned
[2:10:51] with is that
[2:10:54] Birthright more than anything else the
[2:10:58] birth the birth right the next birth the
[2:11:02] next birth you know the scripture says
[2:11:05] add to your faith virtue and to your
[2:11:09] virtue knowledge and Temperance and it's
[2:11:12] like it almost looks like we're adding
[2:11:15] something from the outside on top of
[2:11:18] what we already have but that's not the
[2:11:20] way the prophet brings it he says that
[2:11:23] those things are actually born in you so
[2:11:27] they birth from
[2:11:29] within and that's where it's taking
[2:11:31] place it's like you are having a son and
[2:11:36] you're having another son and you're
[2:11:38] having another son and you're having a
[2:11:41] daughter and another son and you're
[2:11:42] building up this stature of a perfect
[2:11:46] man it's birth into this birth into this
[2:11:52] birth into this and the True Believer is
[2:11:56] really only concerned about that
[2:11:59] Birthright that's his great
[2:12:02] desire now
[2:12:04] this birth and this power of evil and
[2:12:09] good we see it displayed in these two
[2:12:14] boys and we see it
[2:12:17] now say I take my last set of quotes out
[2:12:19] of the message birth pains and brother
[2:12:21] brandham is bringing this birth pains
[2:12:24] and how that these birth pains they uh
[2:12:29] the natural types to
[2:12:31] spiritual then he brings in the distress
[2:12:33] and the sorrow and then there's why
[2:12:36] there's so many still births
[2:12:38] today then he says after your birth you
[2:12:41] never go backward spiritually you always
[2:12:45] go forward in your growth as
[2:12:48] believer and he talks about the world
[2:12:53] has gone through these birth planes
[2:12:56] through the world
[2:12:58] wars that's that's what a birth pain is
[2:13:02] it's the entire world going through the
[2:13:05] issues and problems that it has and it's
[2:13:09] actually The
[2:13:11] Messengers that God sends a prophet to
[2:13:15] bring the birth pains because what does
[2:13:18] the prophet say a prophet says you've
[2:13:21] been moving like this but now it's time
[2:13:24] to move into another dimension another
[2:13:27] level so you're building a wall but now
[2:13:31] we have to turn a corner cuz we're
[2:13:33] actually building a house or building a
[2:13:36] building and God is building a house
[2:13:38] he's building a building and he uses a
[2:13:42] prophet to turn those Corners he sends a
[2:13:46] prophet at the junction of time time to
[2:13:49] bring us to a new phase of Christianity
[2:13:53] or a new phase of our walk with the Lord
[2:13:56] and it's birth after birth after
[2:14:00] birth and those birth pains are coming
[2:14:04] from
[2:14:05] within and those struggles come from
[2:14:08] within I'll just read a couple quotes
[2:14:10] here and we'll close in the birth pains
[2:14:12] paragraph 42 I want to speak this
[2:14:14] afternoon upon the subject that I
[2:14:16] announc birth pains now that sounds very
[2:14:20] bad but it's in the Bible I believe
[2:14:22] Jesus here was speaking he said you'll
[2:14:25] have sorrow but your sorrow will be
[2:14:27] turned to Joy speaking to his disciples
[2:14:30] here knowing that the birth of
[2:14:33] Christianity was coming into existence
[2:14:37] now the old has to die in order that the
[2:14:39] new is born to have anything gives birth
[2:14:43] has to have Pains of distress and they
[2:14:46] certainly was going to go through the
[2:14:47] pain of distress and anguish to get from
[2:14:51] the law unto Grace normal natural birth
[2:14:56] types the spiritual birth all things of
[2:14:59] the natural is types of the spiritual we
[2:15:01] find out we look out here on the ground
[2:15:04] we see a tree in the earth growing it's
[2:15:06] struggling for life that goes to show
[2:15:08] that there's a tree somewhere that
[2:15:10] doesn't die because it's crying out for
[2:15:14] something paragraph 55 he says this here
[2:15:18] I think a
[2:15:19] baby is
[2:15:21] born just by still birth with no sound
[2:15:25] no emotion that's a dead baby that's
[2:15:29] what's the matter with the church today
[2:15:31] the system we got too many stillborn
[2:15:34] children that's right they need a gospel
[2:15:36] spanking you see so to wake them up to
[2:15:40] bring them to themselves so that God can
[2:15:43] breathe the breath of life into them now
[2:15:46] we find that that's so true it's crude
[2:15:48] theology but it's true anyhow so notice
[2:15:51] in the seed's birth the old seed must
[2:15:54] die before the new one can be born so
[2:15:57] therefore death is hard and anytime so
[2:16:02] it's painful it's distressful birth is
[2:16:05] the same because you're bringing the
[2:16:07] life into the world and it's it's
[2:16:12] painful Jesus said his words was a seed
[2:16:15] that a sar went forth to se now we're
[2:16:17] all acquainted with that I want to teach
[2:16:20] this like Sunday school lessons because
[2:16:21] it is a Sunday notice then this word
[2:16:24] being a seed but remember the seed is
[2:16:27] only bringing forth new life when it
[2:16:30] dies and that's the reason it was so
[2:16:34] hard for them Pharisees to understand
[2:16:36] our Lord Jesus Christ because they were
[2:16:39] under the law and the law was the word
[2:16:42] of God In seed
[2:16:44] form but when the word was made flesh
[2:16:48] and become not law but Grace now Grace
[2:16:51] and law cannot exist at the same time so
[2:16:54] we see the Pharisees couldn't accept
[2:16:57] Jesus because two different Ministries
[2:17:00] are taking place they're leaving that
[2:17:03] and being birthed into something else
[2:17:06] and this happens to the believer over
[2:17:09] and over again if this is not happening
[2:17:12] to the believer then there's a problem
[2:17:15] there if we're satisfied in our elves
[2:17:18] there's a problem in there you're
[2:17:19] satisfied in your your ministry and the
[2:17:22] calling of God in your life you're
[2:17:24] satisfied with no
[2:17:26] growth and you don't know whether you're
[2:17:29] adopted or placed or not and then it's
[2:17:31] like do you even care to know would you
[2:17:34] like to know how it works are you
[2:17:36] interested to know how it works the
[2:17:38] technicality of it yes you want to know
[2:17:42] that's why it was preached so you could
[2:17:45] know it it's like well
[2:17:48] you know I can't figure it out so I'll
[2:17:50] just leave it alone well what you listen
[2:17:52] why you got your Bible why are you
[2:17:54] eating food do you know every ingredient
[2:17:57] in that ham sandwich or what you ate for
[2:18:00] Thanksgiving you don't know every
[2:18:02] ingredient but you're a human being and
[2:18:04] you have to eat and when you eat it
[2:18:07] becomes one with you and you grow and
[2:18:09] you mature and that's the same thing
[2:18:11] with the word natural types of spiritual
[2:18:14] little children can't explain all what
[2:18:15] they're eating but they must eat need a
[2:18:18] healthy diet in order to grow and we
[2:18:21] should be
[2:18:23] growing we should be growing
[2:18:26] spiritually our maturity for the gifts
[2:18:30] our maturity for his word our desire for
[2:18:34] the lost our desire to see the Holy
[2:18:38] Ghost have its way our desire to see a
[2:18:42] baby
[2:18:43] born don't you want to see that in your
[2:18:46] church
[2:18:49] or you just want another member to join
[2:18:52] you don't care about it's not about
[2:18:54] another member joining we want to see a
[2:18:56] child
[2:18:58] born by a new birth and that child might
[2:19:03] be
[2:19:04] me might be you another birth another
[2:19:09] birth is that right
[2:19:12] Saints that should be our desire our
[2:19:14] great desire two more quotes is that
[2:19:16] okay 77 in birth pains that's the same
[2:19:21] thing in the New Birth we never go back
[2:19:24] but we go forward when we're born again
[2:19:28] and that's why I think today we have so
[2:19:30] many not so many rather genuine new
[2:19:33] births is because the seed is maybe will
[2:19:36] sympathize with the word or the person
[2:19:39] but they don't want to rot away from the
[2:19:41] old system that they were in they don't
[2:19:43] want to come out they want to stay in
[2:19:46] the old system and claim the new birth
[2:19:48] or the message of the age we found that
[2:19:51] under Luther Wesley Pentecostals and all
[2:19:54] the other ages they still try to hold on
[2:19:56] to their old system and claim this but
[2:19:59] the old system age must die rot in order
[2:20:04] bring forth the new
[2:20:06] one they still want to clean notice they
[2:20:10] know the old system is there but they
[2:20:11] just don't want to rot out of it now rot
[2:20:15] is when it's really done away
[2:20:17] with when a claim is made that they are
[2:20:21] newborn but a claim is only a begotten
[2:20:24] sign rotten brings forth the new birth
[2:20:30] amen paragraph
[2:20:33] 86 we are told by God's prophets that we
[2:20:37] are to have a new Earth a new Heaven and
[2:20:40] a new Earth if you want the scripture on
[2:20:42] that Revelations 21 can quote it for you
[2:20:45] John said I saw a new Heaven and a new
[2:20:47] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[2:20:50] Earth was passed away it was gone now
[2:20:53] we're here to have a new Earth the old
[2:20:56] Earth and the new Earth cannot exist at
[2:20:59] the same time or the new world and the
[2:21:01] old world cannot exist at the same time
[2:21:04] there can't be two World orders together
[2:21:07] at the same time now in order to get the
[2:21:09] new Earth the old one has to die now the
[2:21:12] old one has to die then it's giving
[2:21:14] birth pains for a new one
[2:21:18] now then if the doctor went to examine a
[2:21:21] patient that was in labor now the one
[2:21:23] things that the doctors would do which
[2:21:25] I'm taking in I'm talking in the
[2:21:27] presence of two or three I know good
[2:21:29] medical doctors Christian doctors I
[2:21:31] would ask you this one of the first
[2:21:32] thing the doctor does after he's been
[2:21:35] watching the patient is to time the
[2:21:37] pains the birth pains he times the pains
[2:21:41] how close they are together how much
[2:21:44] more terrific each one gets one is more
[2:21:46] hard harder to have than the other one
[2:21:49] next one still harder closer together
[2:21:52] that's the way he diagnoses the case by
[2:21:55] the birth pains well if the world has to
[2:21:58] give away to the birth of a new
[2:22:01] world let's just examine some of the
[2:22:04] birth pains we're having on the earth
[2:22:06] and then we'll see about what day and
[2:22:08] just about how far she's the in her
[2:22:12] labor has the world experienced any
[2:22:14] birth
[2:22:15] pains has our world even our laws our
[2:22:19] politics have they experienced birth
[2:22:21] pain pains look at church as we know it
[2:22:23] today have they experienced a pain has
[2:22:26] there been sorrow associated with what
[2:22:29] we knew to be Bible truths now it's just
[2:22:31] a big it's argument it's a argument
[2:22:35] constant pains and birth pains but God
[2:22:37] sends a
[2:22:38] messenger and those pains are sent on
[2:22:42] purpose I apologize I can't finish this
[2:22:45] message this morning
[2:22:47] but this great message of adoption is
[2:22:50] for the
[2:22:52] believer but God
[2:22:54] actually gives us an
[2:22:56] example of one that goes before us and
[2:22:59] that is adopted it's called the first
[2:23:04] fruits and many times we'll hear a
[2:23:07] teaching on the adoption and we're going
[2:23:09] up in the Statue of a perfect man and
[2:23:11] there's a power going to come and then
[2:23:13] they they they leave out the messenger's
[2:23:18] place in that power
[2:23:20] coming and the first the second and the
[2:23:24] third pool were absolutely the ministry
[2:23:27] of the prophet and in this message is
[2:23:29] the rising of the sun he brings it out
[2:23:32] that there must be a mature son that is
[2:23:37] placed out before us it's the sheath of
[2:23:40] it's the
[2:23:43] example do you have an example to
[2:23:46] compare your Christianity too I'm
[2:23:49] talking about your message Church
[2:23:51] Christianity what is your rule your
[2:23:54] standard what are you measuring it
[2:23:58] by so as a gospel preacher or teacher or
[2:24:02] Pastor or Christian or Sunday school
[2:24:05] teacher anybody that handles the word
[2:24:08] those challenges remain are you adopted
[2:24:12] and placed if not where are you at on
[2:24:14] the stature of a perfect man do you even
[2:24:17] care or does it even
[2:24:19] matter is there a birth laying in the in
[2:24:23] your
[2:24:24] future is there a birth for you do you
[2:24:28] desire that what church is going to give
[2:24:30] it to you do you have to move cross town
[2:24:33] to get it you have to leave overseas to
[2:24:36] get it or does God place that in you
[2:24:40] through the word that he's given to you
[2:24:41] in this
[2:24:42] day and this is the birth this is the
[2:24:45] pain and sorrowful this is that anguish
[2:24:48] that we should experience like I Isaac
[2:24:51] when he looked at his wife and she
[2:24:53] couldn't have no
[2:24:55] children and we're supposed to have
[2:24:58] children so he entreated the
[2:25:01] Lord for this change that take place in
[2:25:04] his wife and we have to entreat the Lord
[2:25:07] for that change to take place in us I
[2:25:10] believe that with all my
[2:25:12] heart birth pains from within Lord
[2:25:15] willing we can finish just another
[2:25:18] time because there is an example that
[2:25:21] has come in our day and and it's sad
[2:25:25] that that many the Ministries are trying
[2:25:29] to you know what I have to read this
[2:25:31] last quote okay let me read this last
[2:25:33] one in the birth pains I didn't get it
[2:25:36] but brother bam says this is all right
[2:25:39] who needs some water can you wait
[2:25:42] getting water right now thank you you're
[2:25:44] getting
[2:25:45] water yes let me read this for you okay
[2:25:49] two minutes I I cut this off short
[2:25:51] because I'm feeling a little nervous but
[2:25:53] I want to read this for you
[2:25:54] here all right this is in the birth
[2:25:57] pains he's bringing this in Phoenix to a
[2:26:00] group
[2:26:01] there and I I can't leave this paragraph
[2:26:09] 165 each of the messengers of their age
[2:26:12] Rock back to the word the message of
[2:26:15] their age the message
[2:26:17] of according to the Bible I got coming a
[2:26:20] book out on the commentary the first
[2:26:21] four chapters of Revelation read it soon
[2:26:24] as we get it on press and it proves we a
[2:26:27] Shadow of Doubt what Luther's message
[2:26:29] was justification sanctification is the
[2:26:32] next process is the natural birth then
[2:26:34] come the Pentecostal was exactly now
[2:26:36] notice each age Rock the church and give
[2:26:40] it birth pains but what did it they do
[2:26:43] after the birth Pains come instead of
[2:26:45] going on with the word that got a bunch
[2:26:47] of men together just like the first one
[2:26:50] did exactly right and after the rocking
[2:26:54] of the apostles then we find her going
[2:26:57] off again then we find out Along come
[2:27:00] many of the others agabus and many of
[2:27:02] the Great reformers back in the
[2:27:03] beginning each AE each age had
[2:27:06] done
[2:27:09] and and we find out long come each age
[2:27:12] had done as you study the pre n Council
[2:27:15] the Nan fathers and all back you find it
[2:27:18] all there each age was rocked every time
[2:27:21] a messenger come forth with thus sayith
[2:27:23] the Lord now she's in the worst stage
[2:27:27] that according to the scripture that
[2:27:29] she's ever been we are in the leodan
[2:27:33] church age a rich but blinding Church
[2:27:36] age that don't know it there wasn't
[2:27:38] nowhere in the Bible that Christ was
[2:27:40] ever put out of the church but the
[2:27:42] leodan age she's in the worst age she's
[2:27:45] the rottenest she'll ever was said I
[2:27:47] said as a queen have need of nothing and
[2:27:50] don't know that you're naked miserable
[2:27:53] blind pure and poor and don't know it
[2:27:55] yes said I counsel thee to come by Isa
[2:27:59] from me that I might open your eyes now
[2:28:02] notice quickly paragraph 170 now she's
[2:28:05] in that stage beyond the shadow of a
[2:28:08] doubt we're in the lady oan Church age
[2:28:11] now her messenger is Promised in Malachi
[2:28:15] the 4th chapter he's promised to do it
[2:28:18] and the message is to bring back the
[2:28:20] word bring the people back to the word
[2:28:26] birth is to be she's to be delivered of
[2:28:29] a new birth from According to Malachi 4
[2:28:32] four in the church world today today
[2:28:36] there is two systems working this is
[2:28:39] what I wanted to get to right here
[2:28:41] listen real close now I want to see if
[2:28:45] you're going to say Amen on this this
[2:28:47] there's two systems working in the
[2:28:49] church world today I'm going to get this
[2:28:51] off my shoulder then I have it over with
[2:28:55] we all know that that's the word of God
[2:28:58] and the denominational system there is
[2:29:01] the two systems at work just as they was
[2:29:04] with Jacob and Esau one after the spirit
[2:29:07] the other one after the flesh what is it
[2:29:10] Esau and Jacob was fighting in the womb
[2:29:12] of the mother even to the time they were
[2:29:15] born and so is the
[2:29:17] denominational and the word fighting one
[2:29:21] against the other they have been since
[2:29:24] Luther's first brought the First
[2:29:26] Reformation I hope that's simple enough
[2:29:29] that you
[2:29:30] can understand
[2:29:32] it that's what we're working against
[2:29:35] that's going to be in any any meeting
[2:29:38] any gathered ministers meeting church
[2:29:40] meeting group meeting you're working
[2:29:43] against two system there's
[2:29:44] denominational system
[2:29:47] it's a spirit that wants to get on
[2:29:49] me it wants to get on you and then there
[2:29:52] is the word of
[2:29:55] God that's what's working what does the
[2:29:58] denominational system says was the
[2:30:00] denominational system is like this let's
[2:30:02] clean up this our church services they
[2:30:04] come here we want to be able to make
[2:30:06] sure we leave out of here by 12 we get
[2:30:08] in by 10: we get out of here by 12 on

[2:31:34] that's so and so's daughter that's the
