became his blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and aisle were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the

possible only be thir seal is found in Revelation 65 and six and when he had opened the third seal I I beheld the third Beast say come and see and I beheld in law a black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four Beast saying a measure penny a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and wine famine see exactly the same seal same thing Jesus said all right for seal pestilence and death notice Matthew um 24 we'll read the the eighth verse uh seventh and eth I believe it

Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines pestilence earthquakes and diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrow now the fource seal as we read it over here was um uh the four

down wrong just a minute seven and eight let's see Matthew 24 7 and 8 now let's see we get that that's the third opening is it Matthew 247 and 8 I'm sorry now that opens up the rain or the famine opens up the famine all right now the U pestilence and death yes sir now we're going to it seven and eight now that would be the fourth seal let's see where we get the fourth seal and when he opened the four for seal yes a pale horse rider death see and and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and he uh Pale Horse and his name that set on him was called death and Hell Followed him and power was given into him over the four parts of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the earth now see that that was death now the fifth seal Matthew uh 24913 let's see if I got this right now again see and then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you there you are and ye shall be hated of all Nations for my name's sake and when and then many shall betray uh many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another and many false prophets shall rise and deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved now we're on the fifth seal now and that was last night see they were deliver you up betray one another and so forth now watch here on the Sixth Seal 69 to 11 let's get that Revelation 69 to 11 and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them what were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they H and they cried with a loud voice saying how long Lord holy true does thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now you see under the fifth seal we find we find here marinum and under the 249 over here we to 13 we find also that it was Marty they shall deliver you up and kill you and so forth see the same seal being open now in The Sixth Seal is one we're coming to now Matthew 2429 and 30 24 let's get 29 uh and uh and 30 here we are now now we're going to get also Revelation 6 12- 17 that's exactly what we just read now listen to this now what Jesus said in Matthew 29 uh 2429 and 30 immediately after the tribulation of those days what on this tribulation this amateur tribulation they've went through here see the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall be all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory Now read over here in Revelations now the The Sixth Seal the one we're on right now and behold when he had opened the Sixth Seal and and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth see of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven uh fell unto the Earth even as a fig tree cast her untimely figs when she is shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heavens departed as a scroll as it is rolled together and every mountain and every island moved out of their place and the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich man and the chief captains and the Mighty Man and ever Bond man every free man hid themselves in the dens of the rocks of the mountain and said unto the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sets upon the throne and from the ra Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come who shall be able to stand it's perfectly turn right back or see what Jesus said you're not Matthew 24:29 listen that's to this ikan case is so forth um immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened the moon shall not uh shall not give her light stars shall fall from Heaven the powers of Heaven shall be shaken now watch and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and they shall see and they and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with great power and glory and send forth these angels and so forth and with the sound of a trumpet and Shall Gather them together as the Four Winds strove together see just exactly comparing what Jesus said in Matthew 24 and what the Revelator here opened up in the six seal is just exactly and Jesus was speaking of the tribulation period see first he asked when these things would be when the temple be taken away he answered that next thing he asked when there would have come time there come the Marty Ag and when this would do when the an Christ rise and when the Antichrist would take away the temple Daniel how we could go back and pick up Daniel there when he said that this Prince that would come you readers know that and what should he do he would take away the daily sacrifice and what all would take place during the times that Jesus even speaking of your underline said when you see the Abomination that make a desolation spoken by the Prophet Daniel standing in the Holy place what is that the mosque of Homer stood in the place of the temple when they burned it down said let them that's in the mountains uh let them that's on the housetop don't come down to take things out of the house for him it's in the field return back for there will be a time of trouble you see and all these things would take place moved them on down now and vindicating it back to this opening of the six seal now I want you to notice Jesus uh about tomorrow night on this Jesus Jesus omitted the teaching of the seven seal it's not here watch she goes right on with Parables now after that and John omitted the Seven Seals the seven last the seven seal that's going to be a great thing it's not even written omitted the seventh seal both of them did and the Revelator when God just said was John said it's just silence in heaven Jesus never said a word about it notice now back to the 12th verse notice no beast that's the 12th verse starting off on our seal see it open um no Beast like living creatures is represented here either like was on the fifth seal why this happened the other side of the Gospel age in the tribulation period this six seal is the Tribulation period that's what takes place the bride has gone see there's no living creature nothing there to say it it's just now God is not dealing with the church no more it's been gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receive the message of the Kingdom by the two prophets of Revelations 11 remember Israel is a nation amen God's servant nation and when when when Israel is brought in it'll be a a national Affair Israel the kingdom age is where David the son of David sits on the throne that's the reason that woman cried thou son of David and David is the son of David God swore by him the David that he had raised up his son that would take his throne and be a Everlasting Throne see it have no end Solon giv in a type in the temple and Jesus just told him here that's there won't be a rock left on one of them but he's trying to tell him here what's he's coming back when are you coming back these things will take place before I come back and here they are now we're at the time of the tribulation remember when the kingdom is set up on the earth uh this may be a little shocking and if there's a question you you still ask me uh if you want to put the question up as it called just hit it if you didn't if you don't already know it in the time of the Millennium it's Israel that's a nation the 12 tribes is a nation but the bride is in the palace amen she's the queen now she's married and all of the Earth shall come in to this city Jerusalem and shall bring the glory of it in there and the Gates will not be shut by by by night because it won't be any night see the gates will always be open and the kings of the earth Revelations 22 bring their honor and Glory into this city Hallelujah but the bride is in there with the lamb oh my you can see that in there not the bride isn't going to be out your laboring in The Vineyards noer she's the bride she's the queen to the king it's the others that labor out there the nation not the bride amen all right notice these Messengers now these messengers of the revelations 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the king kingdom is at hand the kingdom of Heavens to be set up the time last three and one half years of Daniel's 70th week promised to the Jews his people remember now that to prove that that this is Daniel's last part of the 70th week I got a question on that for tomorrow see now 70 weeks was promised which was seven years and in the midst of the seven weeks the Messiah was to be cut off to be made a sacrifice he would prophesy three and one half years then he'd be cut off for a sacrifice for the people and there is still a determination that three and a half years is still determined for Israel then when Messiah was cut off the Jew was blinded so he couldn't see that was Messiah and then when Messiah was cut off then the gospel and Grace Age come to the Gentile and they come down and God pull one from here and there and here and there and put them away Under The Messengers and here and there and here and there put them away Under The Messengers and he sent forth the first messenger and he preached the trumpet sounded we pick it up after a while and then the trumpet was declaring war trumpet always denotes War the messenger the angel come on Earth the messenger of the hour like Luthers like any of the messengers that we talked of what does he do he arise and a seal opens reveal a trumpet sounds war declared and away they go and then the messenger dies he seals away this group they're put in and a plague falls upon those who rejected it see then it goes on then they organize get another organization we just come through it then here they come out with another Power see another Power another age of the church another Ministry and when he does that long comes God with his ministry when the Antichrist comes with his see anti is against they run side by side I want you to notice a little something just about the time that that Cain come on Earth Abel came on Earth I want you to notice just about the time that that Christ came on Earth Judas came on Earth about the time that Christ went off of Earth Judas went off the Earth just just about the time that the the Holy Spirit fell the Antichrist Spirit fell just about the time the Holy Ghost is revealing himself here in the last days the Antichrist is showing his colors kind of through his politics and things and just about time the Antichrist moves himself fully on the stream on the scene God moves himself fully on just run this right together and they're both side by side Cain and abelen The Crow and the dove on the ark Judas and Jesus just on down you can take it just here was Moab and Israel both of them Moab was not a heathen Nation no so they offered the same sacrifice that Israel was offering they prayed to the same God exactly Moab was C was one of Lot's daughters uh that uh slept with their father and had a child and that child was called Moab and from him sprang the Moab race the country of Moab and when they seen Israel their redeemed brother come they were fundamentalists they were a big denomination Israel had no denomination he just dwelt in tents and wherever he could goise Lord hallelujah but Moab had the dignitaries Kings and so forth and they had balum up there a a false prophet and they had all this then they come down there to curse their little brother that was on the road to the promised land going to his promise and he went and asked them can I pass you your land if my cows drink water I'll pay for it if they look up grass we'll pay for it he said no you're not holding no Revival like that around here right you're not holding anything like that around here and then what what he done he come right back in the Jezebel farm and come down through a that false prophet and caused the children of God to a and married Mite women into uh into Israel and caused adultery and he did the same thing in that same age on the journey on the road to the promised land we're on what did he do the false prophet come right around and married and called into the Protestant church and called denominations just exactly what they did back there but little old Israel moved right on the scene she railed in the wilderness for a long time and all them old Fighters had to die but she went right on into the promised land yes watch them all an arm just before the cross the jard I like that now we're getting down to that age right now here now notice now we find out that the time last I said three and one a half years of Daniel's 70 weeks let me explain that a little closer now because I see somebody here that's always watch that now I want to try to make myself clear a teacher notice when the 70 weeks come in when Daniel seen the vision of the time coming and the ending up of the Jews but he said there was determined 70 weeks that's seven years in the midst of it while the Messiah would be here or and would be cut off for a sacrifice now that's exactly what taking place then God dealt with the Gentiles till took out of people for his name as soon as the Gentile church is taken out he taken up the church and when he did the sleeping virgin the church itself the bride went up and the church itself was put into outer Darkness where there's weeping and wailing and ashing of teeth and the same time the tribulation falls upon that people and while the tribulation is falling in there comes these two prophets of Revelations 11 to preach the gospel to them and they preach a thousand 103 score days see well that's exactly with 30 days in a month like the real calendar has is exactly three and 1 half years that's Daniel's 70th part last part of the 70th week see God has a deal with Israel in here no sir [Music] h [Music] s [Music] in [Music] let's go on talking about this

we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning amen and how many of you are happy to be here amen all right well God bless you we're happy that you're here um some faces we know some we don't know it's who's here for the very first time is anyone here for the first time well God bless each of you amen amen so welcome to the house of the Lord Lord um we have a scripture in Acts chapter 1 we'd like to read together thank you musicians and I think this portion in the word will be really nice if we would read it all together Acts chapter one I believe is where my scripture is this morning and when you have that you can say Amen we've been preaching or on the subject on how to receive more power and last week we were in ananas and Surf and the week before that Elijah and Elisha and then on the Wednesday night we spoke on um seek you first the kingdom of God and some of those things in that order and we trust that this message here the direction we go this morning and be a blessing to you Acts chapter 1 and verse number four and I'll read it and then I'll have you all read after so acts chap 1 vers 4 through 9 let's all read it together as a class let's read it Al together and being assembled SE and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea all Judea and in samarra and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen let's take one more scripture found in Matthew chapter 24 and verses number 34 and 35 and the Bible says Jesus speaking verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen today's message the title this morning is God keeps his word very simple title but we're in that subject of you shall uh how to receive more power may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated God bless each of you and so this uh subject of how to receive more power is very uh it's a subject that we can go on and on and on with and um we know with the message that we spoke last week that the prophet of God was looking for a coming church he was looking for it a coming church that had the same signs and wonders as displayed in Acts where ananas and sa these two Believers that came and approached the gift of God the wrong way and in doing so uh they both suffered with a a massive heart attack and they died instantly first the wife she came with the story and then three hours later the husband came with the story sorry husband first and then the wife three hours later comes with the same story and Peter asks the question and then declares to her and them why has Satan filled your heart that you would lie to the Holy Ghost and brother random takes that example as many of us do it's one of those it's a glaring example that we always remember like how brother randam titled one of his guns Blondie how many remember that he didn't say it many places in the message I think it's only one place where he titles that but it's a remarkable thought to name your gun a blonde and your wife is a brunette he said because he spent so much more time with that but it's just one of those points in this ananas and saf Believers being death fallowing falling on them as the Christian Church their now in this new message the movement of the message and the Lord is working with them the work is growing and growing and these two decide to do what others are doing but they're wasn't real honest with it I really don't think that the Lord was concerned about how much money they gave or didn't give I think the issue was that they lied to the Holy Ghost and they had a tremendous discernment problem because they thought they were just lying to men but really they were lying to God and God held them responsible for that and when that Death Stroke struck that couple and they buried them right away it caused great fear to fall upon all of the church and then people now begin to take things serious and as I think of this coming church that brother brandham was looking forward to he desired to see it he wanted to see that and we shared those quotes with you last week maybe uh sis in the back there if you could take that one the last one in the message communion and we're going to have communion tonight that I kind of labored on that that that quote um and and let's read it read it again brother brandom says the trouble today of us today what I think I'm saying us me and the church that the Lord God has let me speak to in these last hours that we believe we're in the closing time we believe that God has give us a message it's been ordained of God it's been proven of God it's been showed of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with purity of heart and mind and soul you know the hour will soon arise when right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananas and saf remember see that hour is arriving see and now you just remember that see that God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now we can receive received the message as saying and brother Adam continues on and so he and it continues on very well too it's very nice to go forward but he says that we see that hour is arriving it's arriving and let's be real honest if there was a church and this was that church or your church that you Fellowship in was operating in the power of God like that um we'd have a a different I think we'd have a different song service I think our altar call would be different I think everything about our praise and worship would Advance not that we not serving the lord now I'm not saying that but I'm saying that it would increase even more when you knew that death can strike the insincere heart funny little feelings bad thoughts that we let go unchecked saying things and doing things about people in the back door the back way that we slight people and do things that's contrary we know it's contrary and just let it go on and if if this judgment struck our assembly one or two times I think it will revolutionize our uh Church attendance our worship the altar time our praise our worship my preaching everything would change would would Advance don't would you say so and I can say in my in my thinking and looking back over my life as a Christian I can say say I thank God that I didn't go to a church like that cuz I might have got struck dead I wasn't ready but I W to be I want to live a life that I can that I can be in his presence with the utmost sincerity and I'm not hiding or faking or trying some kind of foolishness and brother Ron was looking for this church he said that hour will arise and so I believe that if we take one example in our approach this little woman in Mark chapter 7 as we turn there quickly the little syap phenician woman brother mam uses her many times to talk about her approach she's found also in Matthew chapter 15 how many of you are familiar with the text this little woman was a mother mother that was coming for prayer for her daughter and she comes to the right place okay she has a need and she comes to the right place and she presents the need to the right person and look at how she's treated in Mark chapter 7 in verse let's take it here starting from verse number 24 I think and from then he arose and went into the borders of Tyra and sidon and entered into a house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet so he wasn't inviting people to come he was trying to hide and she heard about it and she came Uninvited the woman was a Greek ass syri Phan by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed I mean Jesus just calls her a dog but worse than that her daughter had a devil so which would you rather be called a devil or a dog her daughter had a devil so I can be called a dog to get this devil devil off of my daughter this not about the daughter now this is about me standing for my daughter she can't stand for herself and brother random talks about the approach how this woman was perseverant she couldn't be offended it's like it's gonna take more than that to get me to leave this church you going to have to do more than that Jesus to get me to give up and throw my hands in the air and say I quit I ain't coming back unlike block whatever they do today to to say that we are done here but this woman she had a perseverance about her and she came to Jesus with the right approach brother brandom deals with this a bit in the message believest thou this in paragraph number 80 number 81 right in there now watch I look look like she had a right to up braid him looked like she had a right to scold him ter talking about Mary Mary and Martha they say why didn't you come Oh I thought you could heal if she if she would the miracle would have never taken place so he's talking about Mary and Martha her brother Lazarus is dead they called for him he delayed his coming then he finally comes but he's late and she came still with the right approach and brother vom says it's your approach to Divine gift what brings the results it's the way you come to it isn't that right the way you approach anything she come in the right approach she came out came out she fell down on her knees she said Lord don't disregard his title Lord if thou would have been here my brother would have not died and my that touched him she knew if she could get right into his heart she'd get what she wanted said Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but even now Lord whatever you ask God God will do it I like that even now Lord he's dead been buried four days Undertakers taking him out there and involving his body put him away he's been dead four days he's just mortifying in the earth there but even now now whatever you ask God God will do it I love this perseverance of Mary and Martha I love how they come to the right one the Lord Jesus who was a friend to Lazarus and I love how even it looks like all hope is gone they still maintain the right attitude and it's easy to be offended in such a time as this everyone seems to be offended I'm offended you're offended we're offended so much that we're even offended when nobody's offending us we're offended when we think we're being offended where're they're thinking about they talking about us and nobody's even thinking about you they're thinking about there being offended themselves like you offended me no you offended me and we F we both feel like we offended one another and nobody's offended nobody but it's just that time that age that we live in that everybody seems to be offended but this approach is what I want to talk about or deal with just a little bit our approach to the gift of God the way ananas and Safara approached Peter and the church it was the wrong approach the way many times we approach the message is the wrong approach we approach the Bible with the wrong approach approach we approach the gifts of the Spirit the signs the Wonders the Miracles maybe not with the right approach but I want you to know that God keeps his word and his word is where we develop the right kind of approach so in other words I can't look at other people how they choose to approach I got to look into the word and the word will determine to me or inspire ire me on how to approach his word amen approach to a Divine gift so let's let's stop on that just a minute I kind of got ahead of myself I want to take this message it's a quote where brother bam is talking about his new ministry and we know the ministries of the Prophet the first pool second pull and the third pool we we're aware of that amen can I get a witness we're aware that he had these pools that were a part or associated with his ministry and in my new ministry the message my new ministry brother random is talking about this and this is what he says here paragraph 2117 so he he's talking about you know how the Lord called him first to be an evangelist to go in the field with the Divine gift a gift of Divine Healing to all the way all the nations all the world in paragraph 2117 he says now I'm sure you all could see what it is it's a coming of a greater deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit how to get into it I don't know only thing I know it takes God to put you into it so you just live a sweet and humble and close to God as you can don't doubt him just believe that everything is working just to the good for you and everything will work around all right so here he's talking about his new ministry he knows a coming Ministry a coming gift up ahead we see him looking for this new ministry and now he he knows and he classifies it as a greater anointing a deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit and then he says how to get into it how to get into this deeper anointing this greater anointing and then he says live a sweet and humble and as close to God as you can I like that I really do I like that it puts it back on us in Simplicity the prophet of God continues on talking about this approach how we approach a gift the ministry of Christ 1953 and paragraph number 61 she just PR pressed right on through never paid attention she got out to where Jesus was now naturally she had a right to abraid him look like to say why didn't you come to my brother listen close why didn't you come when we called you now we left the church we left everything we left our priest we went against we went against his will we kept you in our home we paid you our money we fed you with our food we give you clothes and when my brother was sick we sent for you and you turned your back on us and went away every bit of that would have been the truth but brother let me tell you something now it's your attitude towards any Divine gift Let the church say any Divine gift any Divine gift your approach to that attitude determines what you're going to get out of it you just come to God in the wrong way Jesus just come walking into the city but she didn't do that she ran out to him she fell down at his feet she says Lord that's what he was Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died brother bam continues in the message Continue for the faith and he says this here still talking about our approach he says now let us be reverent and let us take the right attitude towards the Lord Jesus for be it assured that your attitude towards any Divine gift will determine what results you get from it the woman that touched His Garment she felt virtue but the man who put a rag over his face and eyes and said I understand that you're a prophet and shuck him on the head and said tell us who hit you and we'll believe you he felt no virtue it was his approach he went to Jesus it's the way you come that what what that's what it will happen just the attitude you take towards it amen Lord give me the right attitude towards any Divine gift continues in the message 1 for Life paragraph 8 two just down a little bit it says that's the reason Mary got something in Martha when she said my if you'd have been here my brother would not have di but even now if you ask God God will give it to you he said I'm the resurrection and the life he that believeth he that heareth my words he that heareth my words has everlasting life said I am the resurrection and life the way he said it he that was dead yet yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die said believest thou this she said yes Lord I believe that you're the Son of God that was sent into the world see her reverence to approach that gift of God he said thy brother shall rise again there you are it's your approach brother brandom continues on in the message believest thou this paragraph number 114 oh Little Martha come running out and she looked like she had a way to have something against him why didn't you come to my brother look what you've done for you look what we've done for you and you let us down well if she'd have said that the story never would have finished the way it did no sir it's the way you approach a Divine gift of God if God sends a gift you've got to approach it right if you're ever expected to get anything from it you've got to approach it right and Martha knew that she probably read about the shunamite woman and her baby and if that shunamite woman knew that God was in Elijah how much more was he in Jesus sure so she went up with the right at with the right approach she run up and fell down at his feet I like that fell down at his feet and said Lord that's his right TI Idol that's what he was he was her Lord Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died oh my I can just imagine seeing his great heart as he looked at that beautiful woman the tears running down her cheeks and said Lord if you would have been here my brother would not have died watch what he what she said but even now Lord though he's dead though the skin worms is crawling through his body even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you oh that's the secret you might say I've seen through every hospital the doctor says I'm going to die but even now Lord I'm crippled up with arthritis I can't move but even now Lord you see that's an attitude those aren't just words that's an that's an atmosphere that you can walk in no no matter what circumstance you're going through no matter how bad it is or what you going whatever has happened or what's about to happen even now Lord that's the right attitude that's the right approach when you pick up your Bible when you come to praise and to worship it's the right approach it's the right atmosphere it's the right attitude even now Lord you can change this circumstance brother says oh that's the secret this approach now this woman in Mark chapter 7 brother bam deals with her on this quote as it pertains to the approach paragraph 111 she said truth Lord but the dogs can eat the crumbs that's under the children's table that's got it that got it she was was not a hot house plant well how do we know she wasn't a hot house you got to call her a dog first we don't know we solid we strong we Believers we don't know what kind of believer you are let me call you or your daughter a dog from the pull pit publicly let me do that how many of y'all can take it huh yes and this is what proves who she was Jesus had to call her this this example had to live itself out and here she is now we're going to find out what kind of woman she is that's got it she was not a hot house plant she was not a highbrid bunch so called Believers that we have the crop of today she had a genuine Faith she admitted he was right but she wasn't after even all the bread that the children could eat she was just searching for crumbs you see a crumb is the right attitude no I deserve a loaf I deserve more bread I deserve a full plate that's the wrong attitude the right attitude is just a crumb just a crumb I'll be a dog whatever don't shake my hand don't give me the worst seed in the house don't even matter the right attitude is I just want a crumb from the master's table Lord help me with my attitude she had genuine Faith she admitted he was right she wasn't after all the bread that the children could eat she just searching for crumbs we either get the best or we don't have any at all we'll walk away from it and then say we got faith they don't treat me right I'll walk out that's not that's no faith that's not faith faith is there what I'm trying to say to you friends we're going to have a prayer line here one of these nights and I want to see not one stretcher one wheelchair one crutch or nothing but laying here on the floor and then walking on out see unless you come with the right kind of approach you're not going to get anything that's right you're just walking right through and somebody SLA cling a hand on you and going on out that's no good you got to know what you what you're come he that cometh to God Must Believe watch remember she had never seen a miracle she was a Greek she was a gentile she had never seen a miracle yet she had faith that there was such a thing and year after year and day after day we see Miracles and just can't hold on an hour or two she was like Rahab the Harlot Rahab didn't that Gentile woman she didn't want to see how Joshua wore his clothes or C Joshua she said I've heard and I believe that's all she heard and she had believed Jesus said for this saying she had the right approach to the gift of God remember she was the first Gentile that a miracle was ever performed on because of her faith faith admit M the word is Right humbles itself same as it does today now your faith will admit that the word of God Is Right what is the word of God the word of God is the words of the prophets all of them the words of the prophets you'll admit that that's right and when you hear it you'll just comply with the word that is right now brother Bram as I was going through this message in a couple of the prayer lines brother branon would call someone out under the discernment and then he would tell the person you had more faith than you thought you had it kind of would shock them that he would call them out and so I looked a little bit further and he actually says it many many times where a person had more faith than they actually thought that they had we see this with Moses and this is what a good coach will bring out of his uh his team or a good teacher brings this out of its students its abilities it's always up a little bit higher then perhaps you realize you think you can't sing that those notes they're too high or you you think you can't you know accomplish that but the word of God and a good uh teacher of the word will always stretch you out further and bring out those talents and Gifts out of you that perhaps you don't think you have remember when the Lord came to Moses he told him you're going to be the one to deliver Israel he says he come up with all these excuses no I can't speak I can't talk and they won't believe me and a criminal I'm just running and so forth and all and the Lord finally got upset with him with all the excuses and somehow we make excuses but you really have more faith than perhaps you realize and sometimes as we said the last Services we put too much pressure on ourselves to make something happen when it's God is the one that makes anything happen but our job is to be sincere and to be humble and to walk before him in the Simplicity of a Christian Life he'll take care of the rest of it and sometimes we we want to be the one in control of everything but God's the one that's in control any gifts any signs any wonders they're in the word of God and we should be able to see those in the word of God and then uh believe for those and don't back up on them don't make excuses because we don't see them and don't use other churches or other people or even your past as an example this is the example does the word of God say it is it on the tapes is it in the message then that becomes your example you always want your faith to look up to the word and not find this you know Common attitude or atmosphere that we see Prevail at many many times you see it and then when somebody does have faith everybody starts well we don't do that here no more yeah they used to do that we don't you find some old grump spiritual Grump no they're not enthused they're not excited they just read it already yeah I heard that quote already read it again read it again and say Amen again you know the Grump like yeah we heard that you already stretched that re you already said that so come on to the next one you didn't say Amen to the first one yes it's Eternal it's the word of God and it needs a childlike Faith people that are foolish enough to believe it seems that it says exactly and it means exactly what it says people that actually believe that it's the impossible that can happen even if we never seen it before does God still raise the dead well when's the last time you seen him do it that don't got nothing to do with it he still raises the dead he heals the sick he's the Healer of our bodies in any disease whether we've seen it happen years uh uh was it years ago or never seen it happen at all if it's in God's word we believe it amen and brother brandom is talking in this message God keeps his word in 1957 he says if if God will tell me what your need is being that you're in contact with the spirit of God now will you believe then the plur Z will leave you that's right isn't it you got more faith than really you thought you had now you really know that something's anointing you now when I said that that just boosted your Faith wasn't that right now you look at me as God's Prophet you're not from this city you're not from around here you come from a big place is Detroit that's right Elizabeth is your name your last name's Marshall brother bam continues on and the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yeah right behind brother sofman there has a trouble with his legs if you believe with all your heart sir you got more more faith than you thought you had raise up your hands all right it's over if you believe it amen let's say praise the Lord wasn't that strange her coming right back so I mean it just over and over and over just little places through the prayer line and in the message Faith 56 and the message faith and 58 he says he says do you believe that lady sitting right there yes you have more faith than you thought you had see faith is a subconscious Thing lady faith is not a mental act see it's something you subconsciously do it people try to look to their intellects for Faith When Faith doesn't lay in here reasons lay here Faith lays in the soul now the trouble with your foot and leg you believe that Jesus Christ will make you well you do you accept it so brother bam is here telling us that faith is not a mental act not something I'm going to think more and I'm going to have more faith it's down in your soul you already have it it's in you now it's there and you just believe God be a Christian that he made you a Believer you're not trying to be a believer you are a Believer and you got the faith in you right now if you're a believer to receive any healing any blessing anything that God's word declares you got the faith in you now to receive that amen and brother Ram brings that out again in the message Faith 1958 says what about the lady sitting right here on the end of the row right back behind the gentleman Fanning the baby you had more faith than you thought you had you believe that hernia will will be healed you do wave your hand to God if you think it's it'll be healed have a prayer card you don't you don't need any do you believe brother random continues on same thing in the message the eagle stirs its nest and just reading these to show you it's all through the message where this great gift is now dealing with people and the people trying to muster of Faith thinking they don't have faith and the prophet is telling them you have more faith than perhaps you even realize you can overcome my brother my sister yes you can you say I can't get over this and I can't let that go yes you can't but your faith can because faith is the Overcomer it's by our faith and without it actually faith is the most valuable thing you got more valuable than what you drove here in more valuable what's in your bank account your faith is it's faith that we please God with it's with faith that we will make the Rapture it's by faith that we believe that we are believers and Christians is by faith that we will receive another touch Another Blessing another anointing is by your faith and that faith is unlimited if you can just believe it amen Lord increase my faith touch my faith one more time now I like this one here because this deals with something in the approach and it deals with something with our attitude many time towards people who maybe are not in the word like us this is in the message 1962 in the message why paragraph 74 brother manam is dealing in the prayer lives little woman s here with that trouble with their breasts if she'll believe God Will Make Her well you believe it lady you do you don't have a prayer card you don't need one if you'll believe it that swelling will go down and you'll be normal and well will you believe it all right here set a woman sitting here with her head down praying the woman's going to die if God don't help her she's not from here you have more faith than you thought you had you're from down around Santa Ana you got cancer sitting in the wheel you've been operated on for it do you have a prayer card you don't you don't need one you got cancer it's come back God will heal you listen someone brought you here tonight that was here last night and had enough Faith to be called out of the line and healed with heart trouble that's thus say the Lord here's another thing I see you're a woman preacher that's right now if you'll believe God and won't doubt in your heart you go on with your message you just believe if I was in your place I believe I would get up out of that chair and walk out of this building and take God you're going to die said in there so I'd come from that chair and go believe in God and go be well you know what I like about this this quote here here's a woman preacher and he's showing the same respect to this gift like any any other patient never rebukes them and we know what the word says about it and we know that if we can sit down and maybe talk to her we might be able to show her in the scripture but this wasn't that time this is what she needed healing and rather brandom says that she could that if she'll believe it God and don't doubt in her heart she'll be able to go on with your message a woman preacher go on with your message you see this this gift and see our approach to other people even when the way we witness we shall receive more power after the Holy Ghost will come upon us so that we can be Witnesses this what the Holy Ghost is for so it's to be a witness but how can you witness to people if you don't approach them right you don't even know what they're into you don't know what politics they're into you don't know what their struggle is into and you're not even concerned and then think that that they're supposed to hear what you have to say I think I think our approach is not just our approach towards the word it's our approach towards the message towards the gifts towards Humanity towards life itself our approach towards the time that God gave us what if we approach our time knowing that we just have a few more days left here what if we what if we approach that with the attitude you know the Apostle Paul they their their their lives were centered around the message of their day and then everything else they did was on the side and it's like we flipped that we we have our career is our whole life and everything is balled around that what we have what we achieve and this and that and then we kind of serve the Lord on the side but I believe that the coming church and that that New Testament Church that's all they had was the word and that's what they lived and they pushed it they preached it and they lived it and God Vindicated that word in their lives I believe I believe that's what we're coming back to I believe that the church that brother banam is talking about that coming church is a sold out church it's a church that spends more time in the word than it does with internet entertainment preaching to myself preaching to myself right now spend more time in this message more times in the Bible than is spending on some Earthly you know Amusement all these time time wasters and things that we just get caught into oh God help us is my prayer in the message the Queen of Sheba let me close this off here all right in the message the Queen of Sheba brother random says this in paragraph 115 how many's been in the meeting raise your hand now and see that done raise your hands everywhere certainly it will it's perfect it's God some sometimes times I want you to catch this quote here sometimes people have more faith than they think they have you try to make yourself have faith don't do that just humble yourself a man setting right in there that's light still around him here right there didn't it it surprised him he had that much Faith that's right is that right so here brother bam is telling us that sometimes some people have more faith than perhaps they realize is that you today is that you today are you sitting there in that Pew with more faith than you thought you had it's there you have more faith than perhaps you realize and then when we make these things known to you then you say okay now let what can I do to make this happen and he says don't do that just be humble be who you are you have to be brother Israel I don't have to be brother who or sister who you could be what God Made You and humble yourself you know that coming gift that brother Brandon was looking forward to he says how can I move into that and then the Lord comes to him later and shows him this dream of the serpent that was going to bite the great Mamba it's in the message Paradox and then that and in that message the Paradox in that dream he he saw that serpent that God had given him power to bind it and then to loose it again how many remember the dream it's in the message to Paradox now if you're a note taker in your mind or physically taking notes take some of these messages and go hear them it's in the message Paradox I want you to get the full experience of what he's talking about in that quote it's in paradx 1961 December 10th 1961 it's a spiritual dream it's a very intense dream he said that he he said he knew it was a vision paragraph 59 and then when I come into the vision again it seemed that I was lifting up and I was sitting on a highway a narrow Highway with some brother I never knew who the brother was I looked around now I'm sure I know this is a vision the Lord God is here and it seemed like everybody was afraid I said what's everybody so afraid of and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you now let me let me let me stop here just a moment are we in worse times World speaking than we have ever been how many would agree with that has the sin and the crime increased is it going to get better no matter who you vote for right let's be clear is it going to get better you know they just dropped the gas prices what a coincidence it's the voting season they dropped the the gas prices might get better for a season but sin out here on the streets it's not gonna get no better it's actually getting worse it's actually terrible and dangerous times if we ever were a time in history a gospel preacher or anybody that handles or studies the word would have to say if you're teaching or preaching to an audience if you're going to lead a group of people or encour enourage anyone you have to bring the intensity of how dangerous the times are in this day it will be irresponsible for us to get up here and talk about the popcorn and the candy and the balloons and the clowns and the rainbows and that's the Christian experience no my brother something's trying to kill you something's trying to bring you down my sister AB absolutely that's the hour that we're living in and in this Vision the voice tells them there are such danger in these days I can say that too great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and I heard the weed smashing down and I looked here come A huge monster snake crawling through the weeds I thought now knowing this is a vision then I shall see what this animal or this Beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a Mamba and the snake of course represents sin death see in there we have in this country the rattlesnake the copperhead the cotton mouth moccasin many of those snakes that if you're in bad Health one would bite you you it would perhaps kill you but you didn't get Aid of some sort right away then we go on Africa India we find a cobra the black cobra and he goes through the different snakes paragraph 63 then comes the Mamba he's death he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the tops of the weeds he propels itself with the back of his tail whoosh and he's gone hits you in the face usually stands up high and Strikes hard and when he hits you you just got a few breaths till you're finished it don't only paralyze get into the bloodstream gets nerves everything you just die just in a few seconds them native boys and track boys you can say Mamba and they'll butt their heads together scream cuz it's death just in a few seconds see when one hits you and here he was on the highway and I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got right close he would run up fast and then he would get slower slower and just quiver and stop and something would hold him off he couldn't bite me he would turn around the other side try to approach from this side he would get back and get start and swish right towards me got slower slower slower and then to a stop then he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me now paragraph 65 let me stop here for a minute how many know these spiritual things how you know this isn't just like a story time how you know this is a reality of Vindicated Prophet is dropping down a tremendous dream of the times that you and I Liv in and showing how this Death Strike how it operates this is not something you go to sleep on this is something that you pick up and you bring it in your prayer closet and drop down on your knees and say Lord help me to be more sincere and live a Godly Christian humble simple life amen it's that simple is that simple brother will it's catching the vision or the or the message hearing it and then acting upon it that God keeps his word it's just that simple it's not a it's not me trying to figure it out or break it down or identify this it's just simply I heard what he said I heard it I can't live the same I can't preach the same I can't give my Christian walk the same it's got to be an effect of what I just heard God help us because we know that God keeps his word amen let me finish this quote okay turn looked at my friend he went away after my friend and I see my friend just jumping way in the air over him and trying and the thing was striking him and I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death paragraph 66 just then the serpent turned to me when I said that looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any and I said well God what must I do see there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my uninc and let me have sincerity when I raised my hands to him again there's a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something I look at the serpent then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him he curled up and made that sign like a s capital S made backwards and signed means buy this one or anything below him cuz he was the worst blue smoke fell fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to depth around his head when he made this backwards s that s sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free and I went over mashed on it I've got to find out about it about this because it's a vision I hid it one thing and it turned like that look like a handle on a glass handle on a picture just made a solid Crystal and I said think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything it left it all the elements turned to Glass just then a voice came again it says you can unbind him also so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you when I did something come to life again wiggling I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again he choked himself right back again turned to a crystal and then when he did that the voice said now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then it left me and I was standing in the room that would be the message to all of us here this morning uh to be more sincere we've heard it before yes we heard it before but but let's say this let's say that whatever level of Christianity you're living on right now whatever power of God that God has delivered you and lifted you up you're not a unbeliever or a make believer you're a True Believer but whatever you are now let God double that anointing so that what you are now you are what you are now plus that's what I'm talking that's what I'm praying for another Touch of his anointing over what he's already given me this is not taken away he's already blessed you to be a Christian you have faith more than perhaps you realize but can he increase your sincerity can he anoint you in the spirit can he raise you up that next notch or that next level let me say this God keeps his word God keeps his word and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were gathered in one place one mind in one Accord then suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and they all it filled all the house where they were sitting and tongues of fire rested upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke in tongues and Jesus said you shall receive power after after the Holy Ghost has come upon you can I get to one final point is that okay brother Joe all right brother Joe said it's okay one final point and I won't get to all of it brother brandom introduces in the message it's a Easter message the mechanics and the Dynamics and he introduces this to the Believers showing that Believers many times so I want you to take that message Paradox and go hear it for yourself catch that whole dream catch it get the inspiration of it under it let it touch you and anoint you and you get the seriousness of what that Vision or that dream was to brother brandham and then this message here he's he he deals with how Believers we put so much stress on the mechanics and then not enough on the Dynamics and this is and this is the point he brings out brother will that I didn't never caught before until going through it again he says I think it's in paragraph number 209 somewhere in there he says they had the mechanics but they were still cowards on the day of Pentecost they had the mechanics because they had the word they had Jesus they had the promise they were in the message they had the mechanics but they were still cowards but when the Dynamics Came Upon on their mechanics then they weren't cowards no more they were Fearless they were Fearless they went forward with the boldness of a lion and the ox and the wisdom of a man and then like a flying eagle those Powers just got greater a lion a ox a man and other flying like eagles another level a greater anointing your Christianity plus your level of anointing plus where you are let God increase that plus and take the cowardness out I'll read one quote here and notice they were cowards notice but they had the mechanics see but they were all standing back in there saying oh I'm afraid of them now I'm afraid to go out make a claim cuz oh all of them great big Bishops and things out there oh I'm afraid to them priests and things I'm afraid to make the claim afraid I say I believe on him or I just can't do it you see but all of the sudden the Dynamics came yes and what did it do it not only filled their spirit inside but it quickened their mechanics you know this you know highlighting this message under the mechanics is one thing but when the Dynamics come it highlights it even more it don't change the message it don't change the words of it it just changes me as I'm reading it and that's what I'm talking about this morning that's what our desire is that's what I believe that remember Saints the next move for the church is the changing of our bodies and then we go into the Rapture is that right Saints the next move isn't a prophet to come on the scene to get everybody ready nope already did that Prophet already came that's this message that we're here what's the next move for the church what's the next great move series of camp meetings tent meetings what is what's the next move the next move for the believer is a body change a quickening where that quickening power comes over and it your mortal body will become immortal and then Earth can't hold you here no more then you go into the Wrath you don't go into a Rapture without a body change the next move is a body change that's the quickening power where I'm really healed back a young man again all the pain gone everything that the church has preached and talked about led up to comes to this climax right here a body changed the dead and Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye they will be caught up together to meet him in the air we talk about a Rapture a lot we don't talk about this body change enough that's the next move it's a body change and the body change is a real deal it's not like you sitting there listening to the tape the anointing is on the tape and you can't say amen and you'll see it that's not what I'm talking about the body change is you are changed this Mortal puts on immortality had so much more to bring out of there but we're going to wrap that message up right there God help us to take a stand on his word that God keeps his word that's the right approach keeping the right attitude knowing that he does that staying with it not trying to make something happen be a humble simple Christian Life s sincerity means without pretense without pretending got to be more sincere the The Voice told the prophet you got to be more sincere to do this this is the next greater anointing got to be more sincere got to live closer to God got to lay aside every weight God to draw closer to him that is our desire and our prayer God bless you let's pray musicians come please Heavenly Father we thank you for your word this morning we thank you Lord that you keep your word and your word is true and that our inspiration comes from your word not from a group of people not even from our past the way we mishandled things even our approach was carnal many times but now Lord oh God make me more sincere make me more humble and sober towards these things is my prayer father we just commit each one in your hand hands right now bless us we pray send your anointing Upon Us Lord shower Us One More Time Lord let those that have faith let that Faith be operated in them many of them have faith and they don't realize they have faith they don't realize they really got more faith then then perhaps they they realize it it's there and you want to use them and and it's already you've already given them permission to go forward from your word and it's just our D our mechanics makes us cowards Lord but Lord send the Dynamics one more time Upon Our mechanics and touch us in a place in our life where you never touched us before or in a greater way like you've never used us before Lord I'm willing I'm available that's what I desire Lord to be uh an increase upon my heart my
