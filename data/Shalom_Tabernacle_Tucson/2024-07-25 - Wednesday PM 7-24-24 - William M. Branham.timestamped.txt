[28:58] I have three places in the Bible that I
[29:01] would like to read and first one of them
[29:05] if you'd like to mark it down and if you
[29:06] got a pencil I want to refer this
[29:08] morning to several uh a
[29:11] texts that I would uh or several
[29:14] scriptures rather that I would like to
[29:16] refer to the first will be 1 Peter
[29:20] 58:10 Ephesians
[29:22] 61017 and Daniel
[29:26] 12114 now and reading taking our time
[29:30] and everybody practically seated so a
[29:34] few standing yet in the back and on the
[29:36] side but we are going to try to get
[29:40] through as quick as possible and let you
[29:42] out then we're going to pray for the
[29:44] sick we got a little lady laying here
[29:47] this morning it's very sick I understand
[29:50] that she was very sick yesterday and I
[29:55] I just wanted her to hear this morning
[29:58] first before I prayed for her and I know
[30:02] the conditions of the little lady and
[30:05] she's very
[30:07] sick but we got a very great heavenly
[30:10] father who has more than conquered all
[30:16] sickness and
[30:18] I got a A little I asked Mrs Woods if
[30:22] she would read it but she she's a little
[30:25] reluctant of of doing so an article
[30:29] where a medical
[30:31] doctor was certainly surprised when he
[30:34] was a critic on Divine Healing and
[30:38] wouldn't even let anybody talk about in
[30:40] his office and his nurse
[30:43] also so it happened to be he got a
[30:46] patient that was a cancer case the big
[30:50] cancer he wanted nothing to do with that
[30:52] so he sent her over to another clinic
[30:55] they wanted nothing to do with it over
[30:56] there so they sent her back
[30:58] so they all it is on the breast and in a
[31:02] terrible condition and all
[31:04] this uh skin had been eaten off and the
[31:07] cancer went out into the breast into the
[31:09] ribs I guess you understand what I mean
[31:11] you got our little doctor friend from
[31:13] Norway sitting with us this morning
[31:16] and he got all of his material ready for
[31:19] he said you know she wanted him to
[31:21] operate and remove the breast and it was
[31:23] a very bloody job and and he got all his
[31:26] packs and everything the nurse got got
[31:28] the lady ready and brought her into the
[31:30] operating room and then she went back to
[31:32] get the instruments to that would have
[31:35] to be used by the doctor and his
[31:36] assistant to take the breast off and so
[31:39] they had the pals and things laying over
[31:42] and so they started when he started to
[31:45] turn around her husband won't know if he
[31:48] could set in the end of the room and
[31:49] pray he was a Holiness preacher and he
[31:52] sat there by side of the foot of the bed
[31:56] and praying
[31:58] of course the doctor wasn't too well
[32:00] satisfied with that you know him being
[32:02] in there but as long as he wouldn't look
[32:04] it wouldn't hurt him I guess it was all
[32:06] right wouldn't F wouldn't faint so while
[32:09] it's sitting praying they come a
[32:11] fluttering in the
[32:14] room and the doctor turns to go to with
[32:17] his instrument to start to remove the
[32:18] breast he moved pack after pack it
[32:21] wasn't even a scar on the
[32:26] bre not even a
[32:29] scar he said does it does it move and he
[32:33] started and the nurse gave her testimony
[32:36] both of them went out and has become
[32:41] Pentecostal filled with the Holy
[32:43] Ghost serving the lord not even a scar
[32:47] the doctor Holbrook testified himself
[32:50] said one minute before there there was a
[32:53] the woman laying there and the nurse and
[32:55] a great big Cancer all pushed out on her
[32:57] breast and one minute later there wasn't
[32:59] even a scar where it been
[33:03] moved that's one of our fine medical
[33:05] doctors here in America he said he was
[33:08] convinced right then and yet he was a
[33:11] deacon in a church see see the people
[33:15] just think church is something you just
[33:16] go to and it's um oh you go there to
[33:19] learn to be good or something like that
[33:21] that isn't it
[33:23] friend no God is God Amen he's just as
[33:27] great today as he was ever was and he
[33:30] always will be the same and he's a we
[33:34] just love him now we want to read now
[33:37] from first Peter the 5th chapter the 8th
[33:40] and 10th verse to start
[33:42] with be sober diligent because your
[33:48] adversary the devil a roaring line
[33:51] walketh about seeking whom he may
[33:55] devour whom resists steadfastly in
[34:00] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[34:04] are accomplished in your brethren that
[34:07] are in the world but the God of all
[34:11] Grace who has called us unto his eternal
[34:14] glory by Jesus Christ after that you
[34:18] have suffered a while make you perfect
[34:22] established strength and settle you how
[34:26] God be praised
[34:29] now in the book of
[34:32] Ephesians we'd like to turn here to the
[34:34] book of Ephesians the 6th chapter and
[34:38] would like to read the 10th to the 17th
[34:40] verse I have marked
[34:44] out finally my brethren be strong in the
[34:48] Lord and in the power of His
[34:53] might put on the whole armor of God that
[34:57] you may be able to stand against the Ws
[35:00] of the
[35:01] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[35:05] and blood but against
[35:08] principalities against Powers against
[35:12] the rulers of the darkness of the world
[35:16] of this world against spiritual
[35:19] wickedness in high
[35:21] places wherefore take unto yourself the
[35:23] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[35:26] to stand
[35:28] in the evil day having done
[35:31] all to stand stand therefore having your
[35:36] loins G about with truth having on the
[35:40] breastplate of righteousness and your
[35:43] feet shot with the preparation of the
[35:45] gospel of peace Above All Things The
[35:49] Shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be
[35:52] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[35:56] the wicked and take the helmet of
[35:59] salvation and the sword of the
[36:03] spirit which is the word of
[36:07] God Amen now over in the Book of
[36:14] Daniel I would like to read some
[36:16] more
[36:18] now Daniel the 12th chapter I want to
[36:22] begin at the first and read quite a a
[36:26] lengthy part of this 14
[36:30] verses and at that time
[36:34] Michael stand up a great Prince which
[36:37] standeth for the children of thy
[36:40] people and there shall be time of
[36:44] trouble such as never was since there
[36:47] was a nation even into that same time
[36:51] and at that time thy people shall be
[36:54] delivered everyone that shall be found
[36:57] written in the
[36:59] book and many of them that sleep in the
[37:02] dust of the Earth shall awake and some
[37:05] to everlasting life some to shame and
[37:09] everlasting
[37:10] contentment and they that be wise shall
[37:13] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[37:16] and they that turn away turn away many
[37:19] to righteousness as the Stars forever
[37:22] and ever but thou oh Daniel shut up the
[37:28] shut up the book even to the time of the
[37:32] end many shall run to and fro and
[37:34] knowledge shall be increased and I
[37:37] Daniel looked and
[37:39] behold there stood other two one on this
[37:42] side of the bank of the river and one on
[37:44] the that side of the bank of the river
[37:48] and one said to the man clothed in linen
[37:50] which was upon the waters of the river
[37:53] how long shall it be to the end of these
[37:56] word wonders
[37:58] and I heard the man clothed in linen
[38:00] which was upon the waters of the river
[38:02] when he held up his right hand and his
[38:06] left hand unto heaven and swear by him
[38:09] that live
[38:11] forever that it shall be for a time time
[38:14] and a half and when he has accomplished
[38:16] the scatter the power of the Holy people
[38:19] these things shall be finished I believe
[38:23] I'll stop right there
[38:28] I want to take a text if it would be
[38:30] called a text out of
[38:33] there from that to draw this
[38:36] conclusion of the greatest battle ever
[38:41] fought that's what I want to use for a
[38:45] text
[38:47] now how I come to get a hold to this for
[38:51] a text for this
[38:53] morning we have just come back couple
[38:57] couple of the trustees here at the
[38:58] church and myself was out in
[39:02] Arizona and we went out really to have a
[39:06] meeting at
[39:07] Phoenix with brother
[39:09] sherid at his
[39:12] Tabernacle but uh when I found out that
[39:15] a a brother was in town having services
[39:19] in a tent then I felt a little reluctant
[39:23] about holding a meeting I thought maybe
[39:27] I would have it on the Sunday
[39:29] afternoon so that no one would be
[39:32] bothered in their churches but find out
[39:35] that he had Sunday afternoon Services
[39:38] also and I was uh a little bit worried
[39:42] about having a
[39:43] service and so we Brethren instead of
[39:47] going um uh on through the day as we
[39:51] were out hunting we went into the city
[39:56] on and got
[39:58] ready and went to the brother Allen's
[40:02] Services brother AA Allen was having
[40:05] services so we went to the services and
[40:09] brother Allan preached a mighty sermon
[40:13] we had a a time a good time listening to
[40:17] brother Allan hearing the the singers
[40:20] and so forth how they sang and shouted
[40:22] and had a great
[40:25] service then we sing seen all along the
[40:29] road the hand of the
[40:32] Lord wherever we went the Lord Jesus
[40:36] would meet with
[40:37] us and there's something about being out
[40:41] to yourself out in the
[40:44] deserts there's something about it that
[40:48] if you're ever alone that way there's
[40:50] something that draws
[40:52] you that's I guess is one reason I like
[40:55] those outway places you get away from
[40:58] the power of the
[41:00] enemy so much as we have here a devil is
[41:04] almost harmless unless he can have
[41:07] something to work
[41:08] in he's got remember those Devils that
[41:11] were cast out of Legion they had want to
[41:15] do more mischievousness so they wanted
[41:17] to go in the Hogs so Devils must have
[41:21] something to work in somebody to work
[41:25] through and that's the way God does too
[41:28] he has to have us he's depending on us
[41:32] to work through
[41:33] us and many came while we were on the
[41:36] trip with
[41:38] dreams and the Lord Jesus never fail but
[41:42] give the interpretation correctly and
[41:45] just be that just exactly that
[41:48] way and then he was good to us to lead
[41:51] us to the game and tell us where it was
[41:53] at and you know just to be around like
[41:55] that it's just wonderful sat around a
[41:58] night by the campfire away from
[42:00] everybody for miles and miles and miles
[42:02] and watched the uh the flickering
[42:05] campfire around the rocky rims and all
[42:08] it was
[42:10] tremendous one brother there who had
[42:12] been having trouble with a his
[42:15] wife that had years ago she raised her
[42:19] head in a meeting where that I was
[42:22] having
[42:23] service and I'd asked them to keep their
[42:25] head down
[42:28] uh had an evil spirit that wouldn't
[42:29] leave a a woman on the
[42:32] platform and the lady uh just uh
[42:36] irreverent raise your head anyhow and
[42:38] the spirit left the woman on the
[42:41] platform and went to
[42:43] her and this is around 14
[42:47] years and the lady has been in serious
[42:51] condition so much even Mally till she
[42:57] just does things that's not even
[43:01] right for instance left her own husband
[43:03] went married another man while she's
[43:05] living with her husband claim she didn't
[43:07] know she done it and um so the
[43:10] um they tried to examine her for this
[43:13] what don't you call that when
[43:16] you
[43:18] Amnesia my ever what that name is I
[43:21] guess that's right doctor um but it
[43:24] wasn't that it was a spirit
[43:27] it and her and the lady was a fine
[43:31] friend of mine but from that night on
[43:34] she deliberately hated me of course you
[43:37] could see why it was but then when her
[43:40] husband came and we knelt in the room to
[43:43] pray then the Holy Spirit came
[43:47] down that was
[43:49] it then he appeared to her husband that
[43:52] night in a dream he came back with a
[43:55] dream he thought it was jokey come to
[43:57] find out it was the very answer to his
[44:00] wife's
[44:01] healing how that the Holy Spirit did
[44:04] deal on down into Tucson with brother
[44:07] nman and them and there the Lord begin
[44:09] to work again with great powerful things
[44:12] and revealing things one night what drew
[44:16] me to this conclusion here I was
[44:20] standing with brother wood and brother
[44:23] sthan and we were about 10:00 at night
[44:27] and I was looking up towards the
[44:29] sky and a great awe came over
[44:32] me and I said just look all that great
[44:38] heavenly
[44:40] host and I said everything is perfectly
[44:44] in Harmony and brother wood said looking
[44:48] at two little stars so close together
[44:50] that may look like a light I said but
[44:53] you know brother wood according to
[44:55] science in that Dipper the Little Dipper
[44:58] the Big Dipper those Stars don't look
[45:01] over about 2 Ines apart and they're
[45:04] farther away from each other than we are
[45:07] from them and if they would start to
[45:09] this earth it would take at thousands of
[45:11] miles an hour it would take hundreds and
[45:13] hundreds of years from the reach the
[45:15] Earth and I said in all this great
[45:19] vast system here and yet they tell us
[45:22] that they look through glasses can
[45:25] see 20 million years of
[45:31] Life Time way out in there and they
[45:35] still Moons and stars and and yet God
[45:39] made every one of them
[45:42] amen and he sits in the midst of them
[45:46] and I said somewhere in there I had
[45:48] pointed out to me one time in an
[45:50] observatory the
[45:52] Zodiac beginning with the uh virgin
[45:56] coming over through the cancer age and
[45:59] on down until the last was the line Leo
[46:02] the line the first coming of Christ for
[46:05] the Virgin the second coming by the lion
[46:09] of the tribe of
[46:10] Judah and I said I've tried my best to
[46:14] see that zodiac and I can't see it but
[46:17] yet it's
[46:19] there those who are
[46:22] trained know it's there job saw it man
[46:26] used to look at it it was a Bible at one
[46:30] day but in that whole great mass of
[46:33] millions of billions of of light
[46:37] years God sits in the midst of all of it
[46:41] amen and he looks
[46:43] down Paul is in there my mother is in
[46:47] there somewhere looking
[46:51] down and I thought of the
[46:54] order of that heavenly
[46:57] host not one of them's out of
[47:00] place everyone keeps its time
[47:05] perfectly God's Great
[47:08] Army a thought of the
[47:11] soldiers how that if that Moon would
[47:14] happen to get out of order the Earth
[47:16] would be covered again with water just
[47:18] in a few minutes the Earth would be just
[47:21] like it was when God decided to use it
[47:24] for to have us year on it it was without
[47:27] farm and void and darkness and water was
[47:30] up on the breath of the earth if that
[47:33] Moon would ever move it would do the
[47:35] same thing again when the moon rocks a
[47:38] little bit away from the earth the tides
[47:40] come up when it goes down just follows
[47:43] the tithes it's God's Great
[47:47] Army when I thought about the that being
[47:51] God's Great Army
[47:53] there now we went to bed and then I
[47:56] begin to think
[47:57] let not one of those get out of their
[48:00] place they all set in
[48:03] place and if there's a moving anywhere
[48:06] of them it's for a cause and will affect
[48:09] this Earth we just see the results of it
[48:12] now from some of them moving into their
[48:16] other spots it's effective it affects
[48:19] everything I thought then if that great
[48:24] Heavenly Host like that had has to keep
[48:27] its place to make everything in order
[48:30] what about the disorder of the Earthly
[48:34] host how when one gets out of order how
[48:39] it throws the whole thing out of cater
[48:42] the whole program of God is upset when
[48:46] one member gets out of order we should
[48:50] continually to strive to keep the order
[48:53] of the spirit amen
[48:57] and I would to God this
[49:01] morning that we would bring this to a
[49:04] real healing
[49:06] service that we could keep this part
[49:11] group that we have gathered under the
[49:12] roof this morning in such a Harmony that
[49:16] the Holy Spirit would place every member
[49:19] of the body to Che this morning in such
[49:22] Harmony Till There be such a spontaneous
[49:25] healing of soul and
[49:29] body if we just hold our
[49:33] positions now as I said at the beginning
[49:36] this lady who had the cancer that Dr
[49:39] Holbrook take was going to take off now
[49:43] the god that caused the flutter noise to
[49:47] come into that
[49:48] clinic and Tuck that cancer without even
[49:52] leaving a
[49:54] scar don't you know that same God
[49:59] here
[50:03] am and the only thing that he is waiting
[50:07] for is for his his army to get to
[50:14] position like the
[50:17] stars get the
[50:20] position now do you know we've had Wars
[50:24] after wars and rumors of Wars and if the
[50:28] Earth stands we'll have plenty more
[50:30] Wars but do you realize that there is
[50:35] really only two powers in all the
[50:40] universe of all of our differences
[50:42] between nations and differences between
[50:45] each other and everything it all mounts
[50:48] up to two
[50:50] Powers there's only two powers and
[50:53] there's only two kingdoms
[50:56] two powers and two kingdoms all the rest
[51:00] of little minor things are connected
[51:02] with either one of those powers and
[51:05] those Powers is God's power and Satan's
[51:09] power amen that's what the every war
[51:14] every disorder everything that comes
[51:16] along it's either controlled by God's
[51:18] power or Satan's power because that's
[51:21] the only two Powers there
[51:23] is and that is the power of life and the
[51:28] power of
[51:29] death now that's the only two powers and
[51:33] Satan can only his power he's got is a
[51:37] perverted power of God it isn't no real
[51:41] power it's a
[51:43] perversion of God's power everything
[51:46] that Satan has death is only a perverted
[51:48] life a lie is only the truth
[51:51] MLD
[51:53] see adultery is a Act misused a
[51:57] righteous act misused see everything
[52:01] that Satan's got is something that was
[52:05] perverted but it's a
[52:07] power and we are today sitting here and
[52:13] one or the other power is going to
[52:15] control
[52:17] us so let's cast out the evil
[52:21] one let's take our position like the
[52:24] stars of the heavens
[52:27] as the Bible speaks wandering
[52:30] Stars over the book of Jude Hing out
[52:34] their own
[52:36] shame and we don't want to be wondering
[52:39] Stars wonder if this is right wonder if
[52:42] that's right wonder if it will happen
[52:45] wonder if how it could be don't wonder
[52:48] stay like those stars of the heaven as a
[52:50] real soldier at his post of
[52:53] Duty stand there believing
[52:57] life and death now an
[53:01] army when really an army a nation makes
[53:05] ready to go against another
[53:07] Nation it should first sit down and
[53:10] figure what's right and
[53:12] wrong and whether they're able to go
[53:15] against the next Nation or Not Jesus
[53:17] taught
[53:19] that and um if people would do that if
[53:24] the nations would have would sit down
[53:25] and stop and think those things both
[53:28] sides we would have the more
[53:31] war now we find out if a man doesn't do
[53:35] that if the military heads of the nation
[53:39] doesn't sit down first and figure and
[53:42] see that they're right and their motives
[53:44] and objectives right and if they have
[53:47] enough strength and power to overcome
[53:50] the next Army then they're sure to
[53:52] lose that's where general kustard made
[53:55] his fatal
[53:57] mistake General custard as I understand
[54:00] had orders from the government not to go
[54:03] into the land out the
[54:06] Su because it was a religious time for
[54:09] them it was a time of
[54:12] worship they were having a feast but
[54:15] kustard got
[54:17] drunk and he thought that he would just
[54:20] do it anyhow he would cross whether it
[54:23] was arter or not
[54:25] arter and then they actually shot some
[54:28] innocent man shot at him I think they
[54:31] hit some of them it was scouts out
[54:33] hunting for food to feed their their
[54:36] people while they were in
[54:38] worship and custard Crossing seen them
[54:41] and thought they were uh after their
[54:44] side and so they shot into these
[54:47] Scouts and these Scouts escaped got back
[54:52] what did they do they armed themselves
[54:56] and here they come and that was the end
[54:59] of General
[55:00] custard because he didn't sit down and
[55:03] think
[55:05] first you had no business
[55:10] there you had no right to be
[55:13] there You' push the Indians from the
[55:16] East Coast all the way across the West
[55:18] anyhow and they had a
[55:21] treaty but he broke the
[55:24] treaty and when he broke the treaty that
[55:26] he lost the
[55:30] battle and so a army first in
[55:36] getting ready for a battle first has got
[55:40] to be a select some
[55:42] soldiers they've got to be dressed for
[55:46] fighting they've got to be trained for
[55:50] fighting and I
[55:52] believe that the greatest battle that
[55:56] was was ever
[55:57] fought is
[55:59] now ready to go in
[56:04] action I believe that
[56:06] God has been selecting his
[56:10] soldiers I believe he's been dressing
[56:12] them training them and the Battlefront
[56:17] is now set getting ready to
[56:21] start this great first battle that was
[56:24] ever fought began in heaven
[56:28] when Michael and his angels fought
[56:30] against Lucifer and his angels it first
[56:34] started the first battle was in heaven
[56:37] so sin did not originate on Earth it
[56:40] originated in heaven and then it was
[56:44] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[56:47] Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[56:50] beings then the battle from Angels
[56:53] become human battles
[56:57] and Satan come to destroy God's creation
[57:01] what God had created to be for himself
[57:03] he had Satan come to destroy this that's
[57:07] what his purpose was was to destroy
[57:10] it then the battle begin here on Earth
[57:13] and begin in us and it's been raging
[57:15] ever since now before any battle can be
[57:20] put in a ray they first have to choose a
[57:24] meeting ground
[57:26] are a place where the battle is to be
[57:29] fought a selected place in the first
[57:32] world war it was so place in old man's
[57:35] land and places where they fought and uh
[57:38] they've got to be a place selected like
[57:40] when Israel went to war with the
[57:43] Philistines there was a a a hill on each
[57:46] side where they gathered and that's
[57:49] where GLA come out and call to the
[57:52] armies of Israel that's where David met
[57:54] him in the valley when he passed over
[57:56] the little creek that run between the
[57:58] two hills he picked up the Rocks there
[58:00] has to be a place
[58:03] selected and in this there's a a mutual
[58:06] ground no man's land and they fight here
[58:10] at this place they just don't one fight
[58:12] over here and one down here and one run
[58:14] over here there's a Battlefront where
[58:16] they meet and test their
[58:19] powers where each Army tests its
[58:22] strength against the other Army a mutual
[58:26] meeting place now don't get miss
[58:30] this when this great battle started on
[58:34] Earth there had to be a mutual meeting
[58:39] place there had to be a place
[58:42] selected for the battle to begin and for
[58:45] the battle to
[58:48] rage and that battle grounds begin in
[58:53] the human
[58:54] mind the that's where the battle
[58:59] starts the human mind was chosen for the
[59:02] place of the battle where it was
[59:06] begin and that is because that decisions
[59:10] are made from the mind the
[59:15] head now they never started it from some
[59:19] um organization they never started from
[59:21] some uh mechanical Affair the Great SS
[59:26] never started there therefore that
[59:28] organization can never never do the work
[59:32] of
[59:34] God because the Battlegrounds where
[59:37] you've got to meet your enemy is in the
[59:40] mind you've got to make your
[59:44] choice it meets you I want this little
[59:48] girl here that's very sick to be sure to
[59:50] listen now to this real
[59:52] closely decisions are made in the mind
[59:57] the head that's where Satan meet you and
[1:00:01] the decisions are because they God made
[1:00:04] a man that way now I have if you looking
[1:00:08] on my Note here a little map draw out I
[1:00:12] had it here not long ago on used on the
[1:00:15] board the human being is made up just
[1:00:19] like a grain of
[1:00:20] wheat it's a
[1:00:22] seed and the human being is a seed
[1:00:26] physically you're the seed of your
[1:00:29] father and
[1:00:30] mother and the life come from the Father
[1:00:34] the pup come from the mother so the two
[1:00:37] together the egg and the the blood comes
[1:00:40] together and in the blood cell is life
[1:00:43] and in there it begins develop making
[1:00:45] the the
[1:00:46] child now any seed has a shell on the
[1:00:50] outside the inside is Pulp and inside of
[1:00:54] the pulp is the germ of
[1:00:56] life well that's the way we're made we
[1:00:59] are Body Soul and Spirit the outside the
[1:01:04] body the shell the inside of that the
[1:01:08] conscience and so forth is the soul and
[1:01:12] the inside the soul is the spirit and
[1:01:15] the spirit governs all the other now if
[1:01:18] you'll sit down when you get home and
[1:01:20] draw three little rings you'll find out
[1:01:22] that the outside body has five senses
[1:01:25] it's contacted by and that is see taste
[1:01:29] feel smell hear that's the five senses
[1:01:32] that control the human body inside of
[1:01:35] the body is a soul and that soul is
[1:01:38] controlled by
[1:01:40] imaginations conscience memory reasons
[1:01:44] and affections that's the thing that
[1:01:46] controls the soul but the spirit is only
[1:01:50] has one
[1:01:52] sense the
[1:01:54] spirit oh oh let's get it the spirit has
[1:02:00] one sense and that sense is either
[1:02:03] dominates it is Faith or
[1:02:07] doubt that's exactly and there's only
[1:02:10] one Avenue to it that's free moral
[1:02:12] agency you can accept doubt or you can
[1:02:15] accept Faith either one you want to work
[1:02:18] on therefore Satan begin at the
[1:02:22] principal part that cause the spirit
[1:02:26] of man to doubt God's
[1:02:29] word god begin the principal part to lay
[1:02:32] his word in that Spirit there you are
[1:02:36] that's what does it if this church right
[1:02:39] now could be put together and knitted
[1:02:43] together with such that every person
[1:02:44] would be in one Accord with not one
[1:02:47] Shadow of Doubt anywhere there would not
[1:02:50] be a feeble person in our midst in
[1:02:52] another five
[1:02:54] minutes there would not be nobody here
[1:02:57] Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would
[1:02:58] receive it if you could just get that
[1:03:03] certain thing fixed now there's where
[1:03:07] the battle begins right in your mind
[1:03:11] whether you will now remember it's not
[1:03:12] Christian Science Now mind over matter
[1:03:15] that has the mind accepts the life which
[1:03:19] is the word of God and there brings the
[1:03:22] life just your thought doesn't do it but
[1:03:25] the word of God brought in the channel
[1:03:28] of your
[1:03:29] thought see it's not the thought as
[1:03:31] Christian Science make it mind over
[1:03:33] matter no that isn't it but your mind
[1:03:36] accepts it and grasp it what is your
[1:03:38] mind controlled by your spirit and your
[1:03:41] spirit catches the word of God and
[1:03:44] that's the thing that's got life in it
[1:03:46] it brings life into you oh
[1:03:51] brother when that takes place when life
[1:03:55] comes down that channel into you the
[1:03:59] word of God is manifested in
[1:04:02] you if you abide me and my words abide
[1:04:05] in you then ask what you will and it'll
[1:04:08] be done for you then what does that do
[1:04:11] from the middle of the heart which is
[1:04:13] the soul from There Goes Forth feeding
[1:04:17] every channel the trouble of it is we're
[1:04:19] standing in here with a lot of Doubt
[1:04:21] trying to accept what's out there you've
[1:04:24] got to stop that and come down that
[1:04:26] Channel with the true word of God and
[1:04:29] then it goes out itself
[1:04:31] automatically it's what's on the inside
[1:04:34] that's the thing it counts as the
[1:04:37] inside Satan's approach is from the
[1:04:41] inside now you say I don't steal I don't
[1:04:44] drink I don't do these things that has
[1:04:46] nothing to do with it see it's the
[1:04:49] inside no matter how good you are how
[1:04:52] moral you are how truthful you are those
[1:04:55] things are respected but Jesus said
[1:04:58] accept a man be born again see there's
[1:05:01] got to be something happened
[1:05:03] inside if you don't that's artificial
[1:05:06] put on for down in your heart you desire
[1:05:09] to do it anyhow
[1:05:11] amen it can't be artificial it's got to
[1:05:14] be real and there's one only one Avenue
[1:05:17] that can come down and that's by the way
[1:05:19] of free moral agency come into the Soul
[1:05:23] by your thoughts as a man thinketh in
[1:05:27] his heart so is he amen if you say to
[1:05:30] this mountain move and don't doubt in
[1:05:33] your
[1:05:34] heart but believe that what you have
[1:05:36] said will come to pass you can have what
[1:05:39] you
[1:05:40] said you get it there you are see
[1:05:43] there's the Battleground if you could
[1:05:45] only get that started
[1:05:47] first we're so anxious to see things
[1:05:51] done we're so anxious to do something
[1:05:54] for God this little lady is no anxious
[1:05:57] no doubt anxious to live she wants to be
[1:06:00] well others are here wants to be well
[1:06:04] and when we hear about uh that case like
[1:06:07] the doctor the resurrection of the Dead
[1:06:11] the Great Mighty things that our God has
[1:06:13] did then we're anxious and the thing of
[1:06:15] it is we try to reach through these
[1:06:19] senses to grab a hold of something here
[1:06:21] like
[1:06:23] conscience so many people lots of times
[1:06:26] has misconstrued the word and I've been
[1:06:28] misunderstood by this by making alter
[1:06:32] calls I said I wasn't much on an alter
[1:06:35] call not meaning that you shouldn't make
[1:06:37] an alter call but somebody get somebody
[1:06:39] the arms and oh brother John you know
[1:06:41] what me and you have been neighbors all
[1:06:43] this time come up here at the altar get
[1:06:44] down what's he doing wish I had a
[1:06:46] Blackboard here I can show you what he's
[1:06:48] doing he's trying to work through his
[1:06:50] soul on
[1:06:52] affections that don't worken that's not
[1:06:56] the
[1:06:57] Avenue certainly it isn't maybe he's
[1:07:01] working in a memory through the sense of
[1:07:04] his soul old brother John you had a
[1:07:06] wonderful mother she died a long time
[1:07:08] ago a memory see you can't do that it's
[1:07:12] got to come down the line of free moral
[1:07:15] agency you yourself let the word of God
[1:07:19] you don't come because your mother was a
[1:07:20] good woman you don't come because you're
[1:07:22] a good neighbor you come because that
[1:07:25] God calls you to come and you accept him
[1:07:27] on the basis of his
[1:07:30] word that word's what means
[1:07:33] everything that
[1:07:35] word if you can get everything out of
[1:07:38] the way all conscience all senses and
[1:07:43] just let the word come in that word will
[1:07:46] produce just exactly here see what it's
[1:07:50] covered over with you say well now uh
[1:07:53] you say well these conscious and senses
[1:07:55] and so forth don't have anything to do
[1:07:56] with the brother BR certainly it
[1:07:59] does but if you let the word come in it
[1:08:02] covered over with conscience then it
[1:08:04] can't grow it'll be a deformed word did
[1:08:08] you ever see a good grain of corn plant
[1:08:10] in the ground and let a stick fall over
[1:08:11] it it'll grow
[1:08:13] crooked anybody anything he grows up
[1:08:16] with because something has hindered it
[1:08:19] well that's what's the matter with our
[1:08:20] Pentecostal faith today we've let too
[1:08:23] many things hinder it the faith that
[1:08:26] we've been taught the Holy Spirit that's
[1:08:28] been living in us we've let too many
[1:08:30] things looking at somebody else and the
[1:08:33] devil's always trying to point you to
[1:08:35] somebody's failure but he tries to keep
[1:08:37] you away from the real testimony that's
[1:08:40] genuine he'll point you to a hypocrite
[1:08:43] sometime who went out impersonating
[1:08:45] something he didn't do it because he was
[1:08:49] impersonating but if it come from the
[1:08:51] true source of the word of God heavens
[1:08:53] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:08:55] cannot pass away it's got to stay there
[1:08:58] you see it says it must be accepted in
[1:09:01] the mind then it's believed with the
[1:09:03] heart then the word of God becomes a
[1:09:06] reality then every senses of soul and
[1:09:10] body is just scoured out with the Holy
[1:09:12] Spirit am then your sense of God your
[1:09:16] conscience of
[1:09:18] God everything that's Godly flows
[1:09:21] through
[1:09:22] you there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:09:26] there's nothing can rise up there's
[1:09:27] nothing can come up in the memory and
[1:09:29] say well I remember Miss Jones tried to
[1:09:31] trust God Miss so and so miss do tried
[1:09:33] to trust God for healing one time and
[1:09:35] she failed see but if that channel has
[1:09:39] been cleared
[1:09:40] out and been purged and been filled on
[1:09:44] the inside with the holy spirit that
[1:09:46] don't even come in memory don't matter
[1:09:48] about Miss J and what she did you and
[1:09:51] God together nobody else but you two how
[1:09:54] you are
[1:09:56] there's your
[1:09:57] battle kill him at the
[1:09:59] beginning stop him dead in his trap amen
[1:10:03] it ain't how long you make the war
[1:10:05] linger just stop it right
[1:10:08] now if you'll come and you'll keep them
[1:10:11] memories and conscience and everything
[1:10:13] thinking about well I might fail it
[1:10:15] might not be right don't you do that at
[1:10:17] all you throw aide everything and open
[1:10:20] up a channel and say God your word is
[1:10:22] eternally
[1:10:24] true amen
[1:10:25] as for me if the whole church fails if
[1:10:29] the whole world fails yet I can't fail
[1:10:33] because I'm taking your word there's the
[1:10:35] battle that's the
[1:10:37] thing why would almighty God remove a
[1:10:40] cancer from a woman's breast without a
[1:10:44] scar and let a child L die no sir a
[1:10:49] little girl come here not long ago from
[1:10:51] the high school her mother called me up
[1:10:54] said brother random
[1:10:56] my girl's got hjis disease that's cancer
[1:11:00] at forms and lumps and the doctors took
[1:11:03] a piece from a break on her throat sent
[1:11:05] it away and it's perfectly hodin disease
[1:11:08] so he said the next one breaks may break
[1:11:10] over a heart when it does she's gone
[1:11:13] said she hasn't got a away they breaking
[1:11:15] she's got anywhere about three months to
[1:11:18] live the mother said what shall I do
[1:11:21] send her back to school said let her go
[1:11:23] because she'll go probably suddenly and
[1:11:25] said just let her go and live an noral
[1:11:26] life as she can don't tell her nothing
[1:11:28] about it so the lady said to me what
[1:11:31] must I do I said bring her up and put
[1:11:32] her in the prayer
[1:11:34] on I said you come with her I've had a
[1:11:38] little funny
[1:11:39] feeling and when the little girl come by
[1:11:42] that morning with blue looking lips from
[1:11:44] makeup and school has them and and the
[1:11:48] little thing come by I didn't know who
[1:11:50] she be go called me on the phone I tuck
[1:11:52] a ho over her hand I said good morning
[1:11:54] sister there she was
[1:11:55] that was her just in a few moments
[1:11:58] looked down to her mother and seen both
[1:12:00] of them without god without Christ I
[1:12:02] said how can you expect healing on these
[1:12:05] grounds will you accept Jesus Christ as
[1:12:07] your personal savior I said will you
[1:12:09] come to this pool here and be baptized
[1:12:11] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:12:12] remission of your sins they said we will
[1:12:15] do
[1:12:16] that oh you know what
[1:12:20] happen the woman may be sitting here
[1:12:23] this morning many of you know the case
[1:12:26] brother Mike Ean one of the trustees
[1:12:27] here what the case that's been about
[1:12:30] four or five years ago the little girl
[1:12:33] was tuck back to the doctor not even one
[1:12:36] trace of haj's disease was found in
[1:12:39] her what was the matter you had to open
[1:12:42] the Channel first you've got to get the
[1:12:46] soldier the Holy Spirit placed at the
[1:12:49] Battlefront that takes God's word he is
[1:12:52] the word and he stands there and there's
[1:12:54] nothing going to stop but then there's
[1:12:56] nothing every one of the other channels
[1:12:58] is cleared out it's like an old barter
[1:13:00] with the flu stopped up you put a fire
[1:13:02] in little blow your thing up that's what
[1:13:05] a matter so many blowed up Christians is
[1:13:08] because that they don't clean the
[1:13:10] channels out they don't go down to the
[1:13:12] inside Lord Merc you've got to clean it
[1:13:16] conscience memory pops laying aside
[1:13:20] everything and coming from the inside
[1:13:22] out with that unadulterated word of God
[1:13:25] that it's a truth no matter if 10,000
[1:13:28] died on this side today trusting 10,000
[1:13:31] died on that side tomorrow trusting that
[1:13:33] has nothing to do with me am I'm the
[1:13:36] individual I'm the one that's trusting
[1:13:38] I'm the one that believes
[1:13:40] it and we see back under if we want to
[1:13:43] open up our channels and if we can and
[1:13:45] see we find this and and that and this
[1:13:47] and that and thousands of them
[1:13:49] testifying but the devil will try to
[1:13:50] come right back see if he can get in
[1:13:52] there at all he's got your army routed
[1:13:55] right then if you've got your senses see
[1:13:58] taste feel smell and hear they're all
[1:14:00] right but don't trust them unless they
[1:14:02] agree with the
[1:14:03] word they're all right but if they
[1:14:05] disagree with the word don't you listen
[1:14:06] to them now imaginations conscience
[1:14:10] memories reasons and affections they're
[1:14:12] all right if they agree with the word
[1:14:15] but if your affection doesn't agree with
[1:14:16] the word get rid of it you blow a flu
[1:14:19] right quick if your reason disagrees
[1:14:22] with the word get away from it that's
[1:14:24] right the if your memory if your
[1:14:27] imaginations if your conscience anything
[1:14:31] disagrees with that what's on the inside
[1:14:33] get rid of
[1:14:34] it what you got then you got a solar
[1:14:38] system
[1:14:40] Hallelujah God set the stars in order
[1:14:43] and said hang there God call you and
[1:14:45] stay there nothing's going to move them
[1:14:48] when God can get a man in his hands till
[1:14:51] he can get senses conscience
[1:14:55] everything cleaned out until it stands
[1:14:58] with God behind it in the spirit there's
[1:15:01] not a devil in the world can poke it
[1:15:02] down in there Hallelujah right he come
[1:15:06] around and say you don't feel any better
[1:15:07] your conscience is even gone to that the
[1:15:11] flu so clear it shouts
[1:15:14] Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle
[1:15:16] glory to God it sounds
[1:15:19] out just is clean and clear for the word
[1:15:22] of God to work through the power of God
[1:15:25] see that's the main thing there's your
[1:15:27] Battleground your Battleground is back
[1:15:29] here at the
[1:15:31] beginning back here in the soul back in
[1:15:35] your mind that opens the the mind is the
[1:15:39] gate to the soul the gate to the spirit
[1:15:41] rather your mind opens up and accepts
[1:15:44] the spirit or it rejects the spirit you
[1:15:47] can have little Consciousness little
[1:15:49] feelings and little Sensations all these
[1:15:51] things that has nothing to do with it
[1:15:53] that's just little Sensations and things
[1:15:55] but when it comes to reality your mind
[1:15:57] opens it up amen your mind either
[1:16:00] accepts it or rejects
[1:16:03] it that's it
[1:16:05] friends God let none of them miss it see
[1:16:09] it's your
[1:16:11] mind that opens up the door or closes
[1:16:14] the door and listens to your conscience
[1:16:17] listens to your memory listens to your
[1:16:20] affections but when your mind closes
[1:16:24] itself self to these things and let God
[1:16:27] the spirit of his word come in it blows
[1:16:30] the rest of the stuff
[1:16:33] out every doubt is gone every fear is
[1:16:37] gone every sensation of Doubt is gone
[1:16:41] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:16:43] standing there but the word of God and
[1:16:45] Satan cannot battle against that no sir
[1:16:49] he cannot battle against it now we know
[1:16:53] that's truth the these battles has raed
[1:16:56] since the day of the Garden of
[1:16:58] Eden the battle in the human mind Satan
[1:17:02] started it what did he do when he met
[1:17:05] Eve he didn't deny God's word but he
[1:17:08] whitewashed it he stopped up some little
[1:17:11] channels here
[1:17:13] somewhere he said but surely God Genesis
[1:17:16] 3:1 he surely God all these things that
[1:17:19] he he he promised he know the word was
[1:17:21] right but he know he couldn't just come
[1:17:23] right out and blast it out
[1:17:25] uh blurry like that but he he he
[1:17:28] sugarcoated it like Mama used to get us
[1:17:31] to take medicine and she try to put
[1:17:33] orange juice and Castor o might just
[1:17:36] rather take the castor oil without the
[1:17:37] orange juice anything that's
[1:17:39] hypocritical see she we used to have to
[1:17:42] get up at night time and she'd give us
[1:17:44] Co oil for cro and she'd put Co oil and
[1:17:47] put sugar on it see kind of hypocritical
[1:17:50] but just burn your tonsils out nearly
[1:17:52] going down at the sugar L well that's
[1:17:54] the way it is is friend Satan tries to
[1:17:57] to be hypocritical about it he tries to
[1:17:59] show you something better a easier way a
[1:18:02] more sensible plan but there is no more
[1:18:05] sensible plan in that God laid down at
[1:18:07] the beginning of his
[1:18:09] word hold that word get a grip on it let
[1:18:12] it get a grip on you and stay there with
[1:18:15] it that's the that's the thing the
[1:18:17] battle rage when Eve opened up her mind
[1:18:22] to listen to her reasoning
[1:18:26] that's the flu it come in that's a the
[1:18:28] chainel that run down her
[1:18:31] reasoning she in her soul she reasoned
[1:18:35] her eyes was sight she saw the serpent
[1:18:37] is beautiful handsome far better than
[1:18:41] her own husband he the most subst of all
[1:18:44] the beasts of the field and he was
[1:18:46] probably a fairer man than her husband
[1:18:48] he looked like a great masculine Beast
[1:18:50] standing there how great he was and he
[1:18:53] was trying to tell her what a great
[1:18:54] thing it was and first thing she did she
[1:18:58] opened up her
[1:19:01] mind and when she did human reasonings
[1:19:04] call
[1:19:06] it why wouldn't that be a thrill that's
[1:19:09] the thing he does to a woman
[1:19:11] today some woman with a lovely little
[1:19:14] husband find some great big masculate
[1:19:17] man this man will try to open up the
[1:19:19] reasons remember that's
[1:19:22] Satan that's the devil or vice versity
[1:19:26] man to woman woman to man either way
[1:19:29] what does he do work in that reasoning
[1:19:32] power that conscience or something he
[1:19:35] begins to move through but give God's
[1:19:37] word the first place amen a man can't
[1:19:41] even come to God he can't
[1:19:44] sin Hallelujah there it is this coming
[1:19:49] fresh a man cannot sin until first he
[1:19:54] cast the God's
[1:19:57] word you can't even sin Hallelujah
[1:20:00] that's
[1:20:01] disbelief on first he gets rid of the
[1:20:04] word of God the presence of God he
[1:20:07] cannot
[1:20:08] sin Eve cannot sin until she laid aside
[1:20:12] God's word opening up her channel of
[1:20:14] reasons to her
[1:20:16] soulen and begin to reason why certainly
[1:20:19] my husband's never told me these things
[1:20:22] but uh I believe that you he told me I
[1:20:24] should do this but you know you make it
[1:20:26] so real it's so
[1:20:28] plain I I believe it would be wonderful
[1:20:31] because you're making this so plain to
[1:20:33] me see there was the first
[1:20:36] battle and through that battle has
[1:20:39] caused every other one every Bloodshed
[1:20:41] that ever come was caused right there at
[1:20:44] Eden she disbelieved God's word and if
[1:20:48] one little iot of God's word was
[1:20:50] disbelief caused all this trouble how
[1:20:52] are we going to get back disbelieving
[1:20:54] the word
[1:20:55] word you can't do
[1:20:58] it got to shut off all these other
[1:21:01] things conscience memories and say
[1:21:03] reasonings and all these other casting
[1:21:05] down reasonings we don't reason about it
[1:21:08] all nothing at all we just accept the
[1:21:10] word upon on the basis God said so it
[1:21:12] sets a stream between you and God every
[1:21:16] channel comes open between you and God
[1:21:18] then there's the battle the very first
[1:21:22] front line
[1:21:24] let's not use a 22
[1:21:26] rifle let's get a an atomic bomb let's
[1:21:30] do the job right let's get God's atomic
[1:21:34] bomb why is it brother brandom f a r t
[1:21:37] in his word that's God's atomic bomb G
[1:21:41] sickness and Devils right and
[1:21:43] left it it annihilates
[1:21:46] them discriminates oh it's it just
[1:21:50] destroys it
[1:21:52] disintegrates everything that's unod
[1:21:55] when that bomb of Faith drops in there
[1:21:57] with the word of God behind it it blows
[1:21:59] every devil every sickness every
[1:22:02] disease you say is that right brother BR
[1:22:04] why does it on some and not on others
[1:22:07] it's because of the
[1:22:09] channel you can look out and see it but
[1:22:12] you got to have it in here looking this
[1:22:13] way not out there looking in you got to
[1:22:16] be in looking out amen you can't come
[1:22:19] through reason you can't come through
[1:22:21] these other things you've got to come
[1:22:22] right down God's channel of it right
[1:22:25] into the soul and how do you do it
[1:22:27] watch's the last Channel it'll Reas
[1:22:29] right on down you say senses oh I I can
[1:22:32] feel it yeah there it is oh I I might
[1:22:35] smell it or so forth these things are
[1:22:36] there yeah next thing you Reas him well
[1:22:39] it looks like he ought to know what he's
[1:22:40] talking about the doctor says I can't
[1:22:42] get well that ought to be see right
[1:22:44] there you you're
[1:22:46] Rob that's the devil standing there
[1:22:49] that's the devil poking these things
[1:22:51] into you don't you believe it
[1:22:55] Hallelujah God's word said above all
[1:22:58] things I wouldn't you prosper and
[1:23:01] Hell how can you be a real Soldier out
[1:23:04] there I want you to prosper in Hell
[1:23:07] there it is right there those channels
[1:23:09] you just get them open up don't this
[1:23:11] bypass him then if Satan can get through
[1:23:13] there get by these conscience and all
[1:23:15] these other things then he gets right
[1:23:17] down here at the end of the soul in the
[1:23:20] mind now if he can just get you you'll
[1:23:22] never you'll never look at one of them
[1:23:24] on till first you have to let him in
[1:23:27] here you have to let him in then when he
[1:23:30] gets in he's got control then what does
[1:23:32] he do he begins to use the conscience he
[1:23:35] begins to use this begin to use this
[1:23:37] Outlet what is it see taste feel smell
[1:23:40] hear it imaginations conscience memory
[1:23:44] reasons affections he begin to use all
[1:23:46] those different little channels as long
[1:23:48] as he can get in above this one here
[1:23:51] he's got to come in your mind first and
[1:23:53] you have to accept
[1:23:55] it it can listen it can batter against
[1:23:58] you but it can't get to you until you
[1:24:01] accept it amen help us when Satan walked
[1:24:04] up to even and said you know the fruit's
[1:24:06] pleasant she stopped for a moment oh
[1:24:09] that's when she made a
[1:24:11] mistake when she stopped for a moment
[1:24:15] don't stop for
[1:24:16] nothing you got the message Jesus Lives
[1:24:21] God's A
[1:24:22] Healer that's the message don't stopped
[1:24:24] for nothing no reasonings no nothing
[1:24:27] else but she stopped for a moment that's
[1:24:30] when Satan walked right into that mind
[1:24:32] said well it sounds
[1:24:34] reasonable don't do that just take what
[1:24:36] God Said Abraham what if he stop for
[1:24:39] reasoning when I told him he was going
[1:24:40] to have a baby but Sarah and she was 65
[1:24:43] and him 75 and when he was 100 and she
[1:24:46] was uh and she was 90 he still he he he
[1:24:50] confessed that God's word was true and
[1:24:53] he called those things which were not as
[1:24:54] though they
[1:24:55] were see he even a Hope Was there any
[1:25:00] hope he didn't even use hope well you
[1:25:02] say I hope I can get all right I hope
[1:25:05] I'll be well I hope I get the Holy Ghost
[1:25:08] I hope I'm a Christian I hope I do this
[1:25:11] you don't want
[1:25:12] that Abraham never even looked at that
[1:25:17] am I against hope he still believe God's
[1:25:21] word faith is beyond hope
[1:25:25] faith comes from back here in the inside
[1:25:27] faith comes from here how does it get in
[1:25:30] through this mind this this door the
[1:25:33] Battlefront standing there now when you
[1:25:36] get the battle set in Ray now the
[1:25:39] devil's setting right to every heart
[1:25:41] this morning he's setting this little
[1:25:42] girl's heart he's setting at your hearts
[1:25:44] he's sitting all around there he's
[1:25:46] saiding oh I seen a try before I've
[1:25:48] heard that before cast him
[1:25:51] out it's all cast him out amen
[1:25:54] what does the Bible say here our text
[1:25:56] casting him out that's right casting him
[1:25:58] out we've been trained I think what's
[1:26:01] the matter with us preachers I wonder
[1:26:02] what kind of training we've had help us
[1:26:05] God's training for this great battle
[1:26:07] help us Jesus Matthew 24 said there and
[1:26:10] also Daniel 12 said there be a time of
[1:26:12] trouble such as never like on the earth
[1:26:14] before and we're living in that time
[1:26:17] when culture and education and things
[1:26:19] have smothered over the word of God and
[1:26:21] got into reasonings and so forth the
[1:26:24] Battle Is Now who stand
[1:26:28] Hallelujah the battle's ready to go in
[1:26:31] she's R now look what a great opposition
[1:26:33] we got who will be like David said you
[1:26:36] stand and let that uncircumcised
[1:26:37] Philistine defile the armies
[1:26:39] of fight amen God wants man and women
[1:26:44] this morning you can raise up and say I
[1:26:46] take the Lord at his
[1:26:48] word no matter what F this and that and
[1:26:51] what that and did that has nothing to do
[1:26:52] with
[1:26:54] you SS and so forth if you're afraid of
[1:26:57] him get back where you
[1:26:58] belong but God's arm is moving forward
[1:27:02] amen man of
[1:27:04] veiler man of of of Faith man of power
[1:27:10] man of understanding they don't have to
[1:27:12] be smart they don't have to be educated
[1:27:14] they have to be
[1:27:15] channels God takes those little channels
[1:27:18] she stopped for a moment to reason
[1:27:20] saying well now let's see well just like
[1:27:23] what if this little lady this morning no
[1:27:25] doubt that the doctors told her she's
[1:27:27] just about the end of the road there's
[1:27:28] nothing can be done well now that's that
[1:27:31] doctor I don't condemn him that man is a
[1:27:34] scientific man he sees that the disease
[1:27:36] has conquered the child's
[1:27:39] body it's beyond anything he has got a
[1:27:42] medicine that will stop
[1:27:44] it so that cancer conquered that
[1:27:49] woman sure D to conquer that
[1:27:53] baby our chief
[1:27:55] Captain Hallelujah of this great Army
[1:27:58] hallu he is a Resurrection
[1:28:01] Life
[1:28:03] Hallelujah nothing can conquer him
[1:28:07] Hallelujah the brains of the army lays
[1:28:10] in its
[1:28:12] captains the intelligence ROM all and
[1:28:16] Germany was the brains of Germany not
[1:28:18] Hitler
[1:28:20] Romo that's right Eisenhower
[1:28:24] military man Patton those men who were
[1:28:27] at the front it depend on which way they
[1:28:29] gave the order you follow your captain
[1:28:33] if he's a right kind of a general if
[1:28:35] he's a right kind of he's a fourstar
[1:28:36] general if he's proved if he's been
[1:28:39] proven to be
[1:28:41] right though it may seem wrong to you go
[1:28:43] out to the front do as he told you
[1:28:49] Hallelujah we got a fstar general St
[1:28:52] Jesus
[1:28:55] placing five stars on a f a i t h he's
[1:28:59] never lost a battle Hallelujah he
[1:29:01] conquered death hell in the
[1:29:03] grave get the devil out of the
[1:29:07] way he's the great Chief
[1:29:09] Captain so the devil isn't even the
[1:29:12] picture the greatest battle has ever
[1:29:14] raged is sitting right ready now
[1:29:17] certainly it
[1:29:19] is oh Hallelujah when I think
[1:29:28] we can clap to
[1:29:31] that and all God's people say amen we'll
[1:29:35] do some singing after the prayer for
[1:29:37] time sake but I'd like to just bring a
[1:29:40] few quot quotes that I caught there
[1:29:42] during this tape early on brother
[1:29:45] Brenham said we should continually to
[1:29:48] strive to keep the order of the
[1:29:51] spirit just after that he said the only
[1:29:53] thing that he's waiting W for is his
[1:29:55] army to get their position he was
[1:29:57] talking about the stars get their
[1:29:58] position like the stars get the position
[1:30:02] shortly after that he said that word
[1:30:03] means everything he said it must be
[1:30:06] accepted in the mind then it's believed
[1:30:08] with the heart then the word of God
[1:30:09] comes a reality then every senses of
[1:30:11] soul body is scoured out with the Holy
[1:30:14] Spirit then your sense of God conscious
[1:30:16] of God everything that's Godly flows
[1:30:18] through you there's not a doubt anywhere
[1:30:20] there's nothing that can rise up
[1:30:24] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:30:26] standing there but the word of God and
[1:30:28] Satan cannot battle against
[1:30:31] that so sometimes I know we think maybe
[1:30:35] it's brothers or sisters or boss at work
[1:30:36] or these things that these battle places
[1:30:39] that we're fighting but maybe one of our
[1:30:40] children can help us uh Timmy Christina
[1:30:43] where is the greatest battle fought did
[1:30:45] you catch that
[1:30:48] tonight right here the devil is fighting
[1:30:51] you right here and if you can accept
[1:30:53] that word and let him manifest in your
[1:30:55] life then we will conquer amen so it's
[1:30:58] just real good to be with you tonight um
[1:31:02] we miss our pastor of course we
[1:31:04] appreciate him and we want to lift him
[1:31:05] up in prayer tonight sister Sharon
[1:31:07] together we also want to appreciate our
[1:31:09] precious brother George brother John and
[1:31:12] the Saints for covering while we're up
[1:31:14] in the cooler climate this weekend love
[1:31:16] you and appreciate you and and missed
[1:31:19] you this weekend so we thank you we want
[1:31:21] to remember the the prayer request
[1:31:23] before before we do that just a short
[1:31:26] testimony my son's good at giving you
[1:31:28] the 10-minute story and turning it into
[1:31:30] an hour but it is a a testimony that I'm
[1:31:33] thankful I have all my children tonight
[1:31:34] because I could be doing a funeral this
[1:31:36] weekend my son works for a subcontractor
[1:31:39] to Duke Energy they were they they even
[1:31:41] do aerial uh cleanup trees and things
[1:31:45] with saws that hang from helicopters all
[1:31:47] that Dylan just slings a chainsaw and
[1:31:51] sometimes people don't like them in the
[1:31:52] backyards or whatever cleaning around
[1:31:54] the power lines I don't know all the
[1:31:55] Gory details but uh gentleman had talked
[1:31:59] to them went into the house end up he uh
[1:32:01] took his brother's life and came out and
[1:32:03] started shooting at this crew three of
[1:32:05] my son's co-workers were hit there was
[1:32:07] bullets we whizzing around him but
[1:32:10] everybody's going to do okay and so we
[1:32:13] just thank the Lord for watching over
[1:32:14] him things could be much different and
[1:32:18] so I do want to remember this fella
[1:32:21] Lucas if I was there I probably would
[1:32:24] wanted to take things into my own hands
[1:32:26] and put them down but the Lord saw fit
[1:32:29] that everybody except for this man's
[1:32:31] brother is still with us and so I want
[1:32:34] to hold up
[1:32:36] Lucas um you know the scripture came to
[1:32:39] mind the L say the prodigal son he said
[1:32:44] he came to himself and maybe this man he
[1:32:47] needs to come to himself come to the
[1:32:49] Lord I don't know if there's an
[1:32:51] opportunity there but we're going to
[1:32:54] just apply Faith tonight for this man
[1:32:56] these three gentlemen that are in the
[1:32:58] hospital they're serious but they're
[1:33:00] expected to live and of course
[1:33:03] interviews and things my son is going
[1:33:05] through and and I don't know what the
[1:33:06] future holds it doesn't matter he's
[1:33:07] alive we serve a living God if he wasn't
[1:33:10] alive doesn't matter we serve a living
[1:33:12] God and so we hold up um these gentlemen
[1:33:17] in North Carolina that we're cleaning up
[1:33:19] around the uh you know cutting trees
[1:33:21] down and things around the power lines
[1:33:23] and so we hold them up Lucas and I'm
[1:33:26] just thankful to the Lord tonight these
[1:33:28] three co-workers my son and the mental
[1:33:30] The Great Battle those things we just
[1:33:32] thank the Lord for apply the word
[1:33:34] tonight so happy to to be with you and
