be only believe all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brandon now the second Church age was called The Church age of Samia and it taken place the Samia age was issued in at the same time the Ephesian age went out the Ephesian age was from ad55 to ad 170 the Suna Age come in at 170 and goes to 312 this church is the persecuted Church the one that wears the Martyr Crown is a church of tribulation and God's promise to it to the elected Church in it was to give it a Crown of Life each church had a star that was held in God's hand which represented the messenger to that church age the best that I could think was a messenger at the Ephesian Church age because the Bible does not say who they are was Paul because he established the Ephesian church and was the minister of that church Church age that brought the light to the church which St John taking it up from there and then polart and on down AP polart rather on down now the Samia age I believe with all the that I have been able to find was ireneus and now I want to give you the reason why that I chose arenus instead of poar now most all clergymen wants to think and Bible teachers that that angel was polart apart was a disciple of St John that is true and apart sealed he was a marter they stabbed him out of the heart and killed him now but he was a great man a notable man a Godly Man sweet no doubt one of the greatest Christians we've ever had and there was nothing you could say against his life the reason that I chose arenus because I believe that arenus was more closer to the scripture than polart was because apart lean kindly towards the Roman idea of setting up an organization and and arenius was firmly against it he absolutely denounced it and then as we all know the great issue was coming at the nine Council one of the great issues was whether God was three or God was one and arenius Tu theide that God was God now it just one I might read from the aning fathers volume one page 412 just a little quotation if you want to put that down volume one of the n i Nan fathers and on page 12 and it's uh if you want the volume it's the last part of volume three you can might read the whole thing is several uh chapters of it or several um sentences now I'll begin to read right the last about the last 20 30 verses of it I won't read it all but just part of it all the other Expressions likewise being being out the title of one and the same being see he's trying to say what they called him father son Holy Ghost and he said that's titles not names titles of the one being that's exactly what we teach yet today as for the example and then in parenthesis in English the Lord of power the Lord father of all God Almighty most high Creator the maker and such like these are not the names and titles of succession of different beings but of one and the same amen by the name of which the one God father is he he who all these things Grant to all of EX existence the boom of all existence arenus says that all these titles are summed up into one name under one God and there are only titles of what he was he was the rose of Sharon that's what he was that's a title he was the Morning Star he was Alpha he was Omega that's titles of what he was he was father he was son he was Holy Ghost but there's one God one God and his name is one and that's one reason that I thought arenius was correct in his in his diagnosis this year or interpretation of the scripture another thing but I'd like to read you it's found in the book um how did it happen and this is by the historians and um how did it happen but RC Hazelton the history of the early churches and here on page 180 the spiritual gifts in iren's time ad 177 to 202 now reason I'm quoting this it's going on tape you see and and it'll be taken off on books it was in iris's time that the most of the Apostolic Church of France had all the gifts of the Holy Ghost that was from him teaching arus church members at lines that's lines French spoke with tongues it was not uncommon to see someone dead brought back back to life healing was healing was an everyday occurrence in all the Evangelist Evangelical churches everywhere at our Aras know how to teach Miracles were frequent in fact those churches were never without a miraculous manifestation of God's presence either by vision supension of the elements of nature in a miracle to remind the Evangelical Christians of that day there was his beloved disciples but from the histories of the past we cannot glean a single instance of raising the dead in the first Roman Church that's people that don't not interested in either side they're just telling the truth it's historians that's why I think arenus because you see he had the same faith that Paul and the disciples had handed down that's why I have believe that he was the angel of the Church of uh saman because he was he had the same scriptural teachings and the same scriptural teachings upon the basis of God's word will produce the same thing every time if you will just simply take God's formula and Carri it out to the letter no matter what the churches say just follow it just the way it says it'll produce the same thing and that's what arenius did now I think that polyart was a fine man understand but I say that he leaned too much to organize the church and like the nickol adans was doing they were organizing the church and and bringing a Brotherhood together which seems all right intellectually but you see the spirit is so far ahead of the intellectual so that you can't even think right to to the spirit my high thoughts are higher than your thoughts sayith God my ways are higher than your ways so there's only one way to do that just follow him by the blue print that's right now we might think if you was going from here if I was going uh to Chicago tonight oh I might out here get me a compass and say now let's see Chicago set right this way all right I'll take right off I wouldn't get out of Jefferson there see I got to get me a road map and it's it's a lay way lined out that I can go to Chicago in 6 or 7 hours of travel by automobile but I can't just cut anyway the airplane just can't cut anyway he's got a a airline or certain height and things that he has to fly a certain degrees that he has to stay in there's a way made and God has a way God has a way for his church for his people and he never did intend it to be controlled by popes Cardinals Archbishop or general overseers the holy spirit is the tutor of the Church of the Living God the raising and all the Holiness don't go to a cardinal or a priest to make him a holy man in the church anything the Ley is just as right much right to the Holy Spirit as any preacher Pastor Deacon trustee whatever more Ley and the reason they call it nickol Lans as we had last night nickol we broke the word down took it from the Greek and n i c KO o me nickel which means to conquer or to overthrow what nko nickel Le Ley to conquer the Ley and overthrow it by giving them an order of man clergymen that would teach them and would uh they would get their own conclusions together that's how the N Council was held because many got together and fixed step uh an order in the Ning Council we ain't going to talk too much on it because that's Thursday nights in the Ning Council but there's where the Roman Catholic Church was formed out of a group of people that were converts of Saint Paul and irenius and St uh Martin and on down they were converted Christians to the from paganism over to Christianity but wanted to pull the church back into a an Old Testament form of ministry like having high priest and and Apostolic successions like one Pope to another Pope another Pope if we could go on down through this Bible you'd find out that that's just exactly the truth and how God condemned the thing from the very beginning and last night's Church they said I hate it and so did the church am God never intended the church to be run by man amen God runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spirit amen he's got five ministerial offices in his church first of them is Apostles are missionaries missionary is the highest calling there is Apostle the word missionary means one Saint Apostle means one Saint why they ever chose to be called a missionary I don't know but they are Apostles all apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors now that's the elected offices of God to his church then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing working of Miracles speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each local body and every person in the church has an individual Ministry and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ amen and never I remember this that here is I'll draw these lines tonight the first church Ephesus Samia Heros thara Sardis Philadelphia lady OA now remember as this goes on this church had the fullness of the spirit but at the end of the church age we find that it was being pressed out the next Church age pressed a little more little more though this one there was just a little teeny Speck you have a few things he said oh when we get to that th Church age now after that come God raised up a German by the name of Martin Luther that swung the church back again it started out a little more he preached justification Along come Martin Luther preach justification Along come John Wesley and preach sanctification then in this church age here they come right straight back again to the baptism of the Holy Ghost again with the same signs and wonders coming right down here's where it went out through 1500 years of Dark Ages and there where the darkest the longest church period we had in the church ages then here's where it starts coming out justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the Bible says that in the end of this age that this little minority here will be squeezed down because the same church of Pentecost will start doing the same thing they started back here niol adans oh God let me keep my mouth shut like get to that see well I can see that see until you can see here and I'll show you that the messenger to this church age will hate denominations amen the spirit will raise up in the children it's always been and now we got to now if you notice this how it was great there when I finally smothered it all the way out then it starts back Luther pulled it back justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and then right at the end time he Smothers it right down until this is almost completely gone out you're just a little teeny bit there that's when he screams that if he don't cut the work short for the elected sake there will be no flesh saved see there you are right at the end time now bear that in mind now we're going to start on this uh Samia Church Age first I want to break it down here on some paper that I that I have now the second Church age being Samia and I believe you'll all agree with me or hope you do or halfway anyhow that irenius was the star to that church age he was God's messenger because he swept the country in the France G down in there and he established churches and every one them established up on the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues ra the dead Healing The Sick stopping the rains and Performing Miracles daily they know that the Living God lived among the people that was a man of God Amen because Jesus said no man can do the the people said no man can do these works except God be with him it was Nicodemus that told Jesus that now a city of Commerce a Trading Outlet to Lydia and to the West the third largest city in Asia a great Harbor City noted for wealth temples buildings schools medicine and signs Jews lived at at Samaria and they evangelized the Samaritan people pollart was the first Bishop of Samaria polart and other Faithful Servants established the Deep faith of God in the believing Samaritans early church fathers give exhalation of the truth to Samaran the church age of Samaria the name of the church was Sam Samia rather that means uh bitterness mura It's associated with dead because they were dying A persecuted church God called and persecuted God looked upon their persecutions and gave great to Bear he looked upon his tribulations and gave them victory over death looked upon their poverty and give them riches in him the Church of Samia passed through the fiery furnace of tribulations but was a sweet smelling savior unto him that's that Remnant now not the whole saman church just a Remnant I'm speaking of the great 10 days of tribulation means 10 years all the bloodiest persecution I don't know where I can spell his name or pronounce it or not this was the emperor at that time I believe was the bloodiest one of all of them since Nero in ' 67 d i o c l e t i n during the year of 303 to 312 ad God exhorts Samia to be faithful unto death as he was and I will give you a Crown of Life As the father has given me God promised the Overcomer and tribulations the victory over the second death fear not them which can kill the body but he that can destroy the soul kill the soul it the Samar was to endure to the end fear not man and a crown of life will be given you the persecution of Christianity in the ages are typed in the church ages of samarra are very important we want to get to it just in a little bit Lord willing now if some of you missed some of these why if I write them a little too fast for the rest of the class and we we are you can certainly get them

take a prayer any day amen over a sandwich or over a high five I'll take a prayer any day so pray for us pray for us pray for us so God bless you we like to go right into the word it's in the Old Testament we've been in uh dealing with this great character Joshua and Caleb and we like to stand and we're going to go to Joshua chapter 3 so good to see brother Kurt brother Kurt my phone just died right on us and then I couldn't get it charged and then I got busy and so I apologize I know you you I know you figured that out and so thank the Lord amen Joshua chapter 3 there's so many types and shadows in the Book of Joshua because it uh reflects where we are today and uh one of the definitions of a type and a shadow is are the events people or circumstances that happen in the natural that represent something spiritual so that's a type that that's a shadow and it's common characteristics or common themes that are played over and over again and then you could see that as a type and the shadow if you stand in the sunlight your body casts a shadow and it's you casting that shadow if you can follow the shadow follow the type you can find what's causing the shadow to exist so the Old Testament is full of these full your Bible is full full of types and shadows in Joshua the Book of Joshua is a tremendous type and Shadow of the day that you and I live in today so let's take Joshua chap 3: 1 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from Shum and came to Jordan and he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for you have not passed this way his th to four and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant pass over before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this day will will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses so I will be with thee what a promise amen let us pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on your word this portion of the word we read this morning bless uh the furtherance of this service I pray you'll help us to say only what you want us to say and to hear only what we need to hear in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated as you're being seated take one more scripture in the same book Joshua chapter number 24 this is at the end of his life and Ministry Joshua is now coming to the end of his day here and um he's going to give his final address to the people and um and let's read the testimony of Joshua here yes excuse me just a moment J 24 and 31 and I like this scripture um let me just get it right here and take verse 29 and it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of nun the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old and they buried him in the border of his inheritance and timna the Sarah which is in the Mount Ephraim on the north side of the hill of gash and Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders that overl Jos Yeshua and which had known all the works of the Lord that he had done for Israel and so you know this is really a testimony of the leadership of Joshua how the elders that uh worked with him that served with him you could see his influence over their life and that's what you call a legacy that's when your life outlives when you leave from here your testimony still leaves on it leaves an imprint on other people it's an example it's a guide It's you know something that people can refer to to draw how will you handle things how would you have dealt with that and this city has had a number of those that have come our way one of the great ones in my own eyes was was brother McHugh brother Doug McHugh many times I have thought in myself how would I and there's his brother right there bless you how would I how would brother Doug do with this what was his thoughts be I think that of brother Dalton brother green and many brother Carpenter and many of the elders that I knew personally and how would they have handled how would they have stood but yet you still have to like I was listening to a tape where brother Wesco preached here uh some time ago he he used an old Southern Southern expression he says every tub has to sit on its own bottom and uh yeah you can laugh at that that was it was a little humor but every tub has to sit on its own bottom and every individual has to take their own stand and um we have examples that the word of the Lord gives us and uh we go and we look at the types and shadows and it's a beautiful thing when you can recognize your day or your time amen or your season is this my time is this my season and when you can recognize that as we brought to you the other day on those five must that it must be God's time it must must be God's season it must come through a prophet that Prophet must be a Vindicated prophet and those five musts are some of the disciplines that we we must operate in as a Believer so when we're catching types and shadows then we always want to know where does that type start where does it end because the type in Shadow is just that it's a pattern of things that have gone that has happened before and then now you can use that for an example for you now the prophet of God makes the statement and I've read it for you many times in the church age book and then also and the spoken word is the original seed to let us stand like Joshua and Caleb so he pulls these two characters out of the Bible out of history and tells us that it's going to have a spiritual background to it he says that in this message and and we've mentioned it many many times and I don't want it to get old to you but because it becomes a pattern to us now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb 808 he says now watch close this is going to have a spiritual background let us stand like Joshua and Caleb as we see the promised land coming in sight it's nearing the time to be given Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and represents the promised end time leader to take the church over Caleb represents the True Believer who stayed with Joshua so this is our position this is one of the positions that we must take as we see there is a spiritual background to the stand that we have to take amen and that God gives us uh these positions that we have to find that we have to take and and and then when we can see that we can identify the age and time that we're living in I'm know I know where I'm looking what I'm looking for I know what's going on because I watched the type in the shadows now brother br makes this statement in the message stand stand still 1957 and he says this here paragraph 17 it's a nervous age what is it then I give this solemn warning to the church stand still God always commands to stand still before he does anything the church is is in a neurotic stage every church is prelighting and pulling and fussing and stewing it's a neurotic age but stand still now that's the message notice Caleb here the people had just come back the spies from over in the promised land there was that Cades Barney and they had been brought through many trials and had seen the hand of God a very beautiful picture of the Full Gospel Church and many of them had been discouraged discouraged and upset because so many different isms and things has happened in the church but that don't take away the real thing God's calling his church to Halt stand still don't be jumping and running not knowing what you're doing come back to the word back to Christ we see this nervous age this neura is anany can't stay settled can't stay put constantly have to be entertained it's even in our advertisements even in the commercials everything is so quick it so fast it doesn't stop it's always trying to sell you get you to move get you to buy get you to move get you to run after something and it's part of the neurotics of the age you know there's nothing going on so I should be entertained every moment of the day why don't you go out and just meditate on the Lord one time why don't you get quiet before the Lord why don't you stop talking so much as I'm looking in the mirror as I say that stop talking so much and do more listening than talking you know receiving instructions instead of always telling people what they ought to do and what they should have did and this one did it right and that one didn't get it right why don't you stand still because the age is so neurotic it's so neurotic that if you take time to and the holy spirit gives you enough gunon to move up to the altar or go down on your knees in prayer soon as you get down on your knees tell me why that Spirit wants you to get up and run and get up and go and hurry God and push God to to move on you like immediately it doesn't work that way Saints you can complain about your food not coming too fast enough you can complain about everything else not moving too fast enough but you're not going to make God move any faster than he wants to because he can't develop patience in you if he answers you every time and he's there at every moment of every hour that you feel like he should be there stand still see the salvation of the Lord let God develop what his answer is going to be to you we can't stand still long enough we you know we'll we'll you know the a service we have to get up and go get we have to get up and we have to we have to move and God is speaking many times but if the movie is good enough we ain't more going nowhere whatever we're streaming if it's a job we have our time we going to sit there because we're getting paid or whatever it is but when God is speaking and it's time for the Lord stand still Hallelujah relax you're in a hurry this one in a the age is in a hurry but God is not in nobody's hurry amen amen well I got to get this done before I'm 40 before I'm 50 I got to make sure I got to make sure my retirement I got to make sure I got to get this done before I'm 70 I got to make sure I get this done who are you serving who's in control over your life who had it all figured out before you got here and before you knew anything he had it already worked out and he wants you to rest in his arms and depend on him for everything amen it's like the Lord blesses us and then we run off from there Lord I got it from here now I'm going to stress my way all the way through Heaven the stressing ain't on you let God worry about it we're Believers and we don't always have the answer am come on somebody we got to wait on the Lord we got to be of good courage and what the psalm say and he will strengthen thine heart wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord that's what the Bible saying amen so these Caleb and Joshua we went through it last uh last week all of the tests and temptations they had to go through they were just alive it looked like they just made it because all of the tests all of the trials all of the others that ran off and did whatever they were doing and here J Caleb and Joshua remained alive and two were the witnesses to go over and take the promised land amen you know that's not a easy task that's not that wasn't easy for them to go against the en higher multitude you take the children of Israel 2 million people I don't know what the population of Tucson is was a million plus or something like that you take the population of Tucan times two and the groups of people and the different leaders in that group of people and here's Two Little Voices my praise the Lord that's not easy to do my brothers we can all praise the Lord when everybody is praising the Lord but who's got the grace enough to say Lord I'm coming to praise you I don't care who's sitting next to me I don't care what the church is going on I'm going to praise the Lord I'm going to lift him up I'm going to serve him till I die if everybody else leaves I'll still be standing like Joshua and like Caleb to amen yes amen glory to take that population and they stood against it they withstood all the Temptations of the others people that they knew Brothers people that were circumcised like them those that went through it you know they all saw the same thing they all heard the same tapes they heard the same message they looked at Moses just like we looked at Moses but here God kept them alive what a tremendous stand that they took and the Lord is now giving us them as a type and a shadow what's a type what's a shadow it's a recurring theme so for example you you watch any people that's suffering okay it doesn't matter where they're from or what what the race is or what the citizenship is you watch any group of people large group of people that suffer and suffer extremely through history you go back and see there's always the other side of the suffering there's characteristics that go with it and if you can open up your heart and mind you will learn something if you go back in history and you just follow people that have suffered like the children of Israel like our lord Jesus like many others Through the Bible it produces um a type and a shadow you know and I did a quick little look at that at the just the word suffering it's it's through the scriptures and the Lord places it um with not just the suffering in Romans 8 says that the sufferings are not worthy to be compared to the glory so sufferings and Glory are mentioned in the same and the say yes slavery was bad yes persecution is bad yes suffering is bad but what is it producing you see suffering and having lack of or your heart being hurt or you being disappointed as a child of God there's a purpose behind that there's a there's an anointing there's a quality trying to be developed through the suffering you we can't get it until you suffer we can't get it until you are mad and ready to give up we got to get you on an area where you don't know where tomorrow is going to hold you don't even know who your friends are you can't trust nobody nowhere and then God has to get you there to develop a characteristic in you that on the other side you can use it later in your walk with the Lord amen is true suffering Romans 8 2 Corinthians 1 that our Affliction and our and all the things of the sufferings that we go through is connected to our Salvation and consolations Philippians 3 says that I may know him the power of the Resurrection The Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death sufferings that I may know him do you want to know him yes there's sufferings amen associated with knowing him yes it is amen but the end of the fruit is that you will get to know him right Hebrews 2 says he became him for all things by whom all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through what through good times through everybody liking you to your ends being made met all the time till your plans come through the way you want it to no it's through sufferings that you are made perfect let me let me say it like this if you can praise the Lord when everything is going bad don't worry about it you'll praise him through any other time the good times we already got that praise down you going to be here during the good times we already know that you're going to keep the smile on your face and have a nice attitude through the good times we got that we want to talk to you when you're broke when nobody likes you nobody loves you you can't even get nobody to come and visit you when you're sick they don't even call to find out a check on you how you're doing huh yes yes and then during those times it develops and finds out who you are under pressure shows us who you are amen and these are some of the types and the Shadows 1 Peter 1:11 says searching what or what manner of time of the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow praise the Lord so there's Glory that comes after The Suffering 1 Peter 4:13 1 Peter 51 goes even deeper 1 Peter 4:13 says but rejoice in so much as you are partakers of Christ what are you partakers of Christ sufferings if you are what you supposed to do Rejoice look at your neighbor and say rejoice look at them good now and tell them Rejoice you don't have a neighbor to look at is that what that was oh Hallelujah Rejoice we are fellowshipping with his sufferings I can be broke as long as the Lord is with me I can walk by myself if he's with me I can do without any kind of a friend as long as I got him with me I can Rejoice if the Lord is with me how many know what I'm talking about yes the Lord is with me he's at my right hand he said he's got my life in his hands it's already covered praise the Lord bless his wonderful name first Peter 51 the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory am that shall be revealed Amen brother sister whatever you're going through if you're a Believer now whatever you're going through as a Believer is some glory in this amen there's some Glory up the road Rejoice through the tests through the trials and here is Joshua and Caleb holding their position as Believers finding a position finding something to stand upon finding something to be like finding something in the word of God that can keep them through the hour of multiple Temptations glory to God we need it in this hour I need it you need it every believer needs to have something that you're standing on it can't be a Sunday morning service it can't be a group of people it can't be your bank account it can't be your youth or your health there got to be something more than that because your health will leave you your money will leave you your friends will leave you but there's a promise in the word that I shall never leave you I will never forsake you I will always be with you even until the end glory [Music] amen and there is an hour of great test and great Temptation I believe the believer and looking in the word of God he'll have to be able to get to the point where he can say this time is the time that the prophet spoke about that's what I see what's going on that's what's going on the Bible spoke of it the prophets spoke of it so I've been thoroughly warned God help me to keep my Integrity us God through the test through the trial brother sister it only gets better the Lord's got a blessing for you the Lord's got something that will overrun your cup overflow your cup can't nobody bless you the Lord can bless you if you just bless me one more time Lord I can get my praise back if you bless me one more time I get my Ministry back if you can bless me one more time lord I'll do exactly what you called me to do the Lord's got a blessing for you my brother and my sister it's in the word of God yes it is yes it is yes it is this is what Joshua and Caleb that to keep their head above all the criticism of the hour all of the foolishness all of the Temptation one of The Temptations that I've seen I don't have it here in my notes but it's this this temptation to disassociate yourself from the messenger of the day of the hour we've seen that and I've counted Moses is mentioned in the bible over 800 times and in the Book of Joshua he's mentioned 58 times you'll see this name Moses continued to reoccur reapeat why is that because Moses was part of Joshua's commission and so the prophet of God takes this message as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Joshua 3 I can't think of a a more tremendous promise uh uh my my brothers my sister the Lord is telling Joshua as I was with Moses so I will be with thee now what a tremendous commission what a tremendous importance to his calling we see this that they the Lord is now establishing Joshua and we know Joshua is a type of the last day messenger he's also a type of the Holy Spirit and he's also a type of a true Ministry true Minister we use those examples and Jesus is the Supreme example is that right as a minister I got to have an example somebody to stand on and Jesus gives us that example amen and so the prophet of God goes through this in this message as I was with Moses so I will be with thee now that's a tremendous promise and we want to look at it just a little bit is that okay now this Legacy of Joshua Joshua 24:31 the elders serve the Lord even the elders that outlive Joshua all the days of the elders that saw what he was doing am there's a quotation where brother banam is comparing Joshua and Moses and he says that Moses sent 12 Spies to spy out the land but Joshua only sends two to Rahab or to Jericho to spy out the land because the two when you got more people you get more opinions he also says that the officers in the church probably were smart and they gave them a hard time about Crossing Jordan when they crossed Jordan because it was a rainy season and the floods were were the waters were high doesn't make sense let's wait until the springtime let's wait till the water is down or or so forth you you you're coming at the wrong time but the commandment and the leadership of the Lord through Joshua was we're going to cross over in three days and so the leadership of the Lord doesn't always make sense in fact it's always contrary many times to what naturally would make sense he'll he uses he'll cause you to take a stand over something that's completely ridiculous and give you the the the power to give a testimony of something that's completely ridiculous Abraham and Sarah he's 100 she's 75 or 90 or 75 and they're going to have a baby and they don't have any children right now now but now you go and testify that you're going to have a son not through Hagar not through another but through your wife Sarah that you've been married with all these years if God was going to give you a baby he would have did it in the season when you were fertile when you were young in your youth why are you still holding on to that Let It Go but God is a god like that he'll give you a promise he wants to see you hold on to that promise because that promise had to go through the test of unbelief and others around you that will criticize you and see if you're gonna still hold on to his unchanging hand you know everything out there is going to change but this right here is not going to change so if you hold on to the word amen heavens and earth will pass away but the word of the Lord it always will reoccur it'll sneak up on you it'll come back into existence amen it's no book like this Bible it's written hundreds and hundreds of years ago and it's never failed when a man or a woman educated or uneducated will stand on God's word it'll defy science defy the doctor's report defy uh history defy everything if you can find a promise in God's Worden amen amen amen yes because his word is true and we stand with his word so as I was with Moses prise the Lord I'll be with you Joshua this day shall I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel that they may know that as I was with Moses I'm G to be with you too now interesting what the prophet of God says here let's get into it just for a little bit so let's look at Moses just a little bit as the prophet takes in paragraph number 23 excuse me we got it there as I was with Moses paragraph number 23 but one day God heard the Cry of his people amen God remember that he had Covenant with those people not only that but he also remembered he had a servant who had called and had Chosen and he had a covenant with that servant and God will never change his Covenant or change his desire or change anything God will always keep his promises although Moses had failed him and had done that which was wrong yet God kept his Covenant when God calls a man to do something he must do it just got to do it someone asked me sometime ago sh shall we seek our gifts for our ministry some Methodist Brethren who just received the Holy Ghost I I said no don't do that when you do then God can't use you I said the only thing to do is just go ahead being a Christian if God has called you he'll place you just exactly where you belong usually those who seek and try to get things if God would give them something they be more or less be a stuffed shirt usually the man that God calls is the man that's trying to run from him if anything Moses Paul different ones trying to get away from the call but we find here that God in spite of all the failure that Moses had done he still had his hand on him Lord and he called him to go do a service called him to a commission and what a consolation that must have been to Joshua when he heard God say as I was with Moses so will I be with you praise the Lord although if I'm trying and I fail God won't leave me praise the Lord I never have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything amen I'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try amen amen one time it was at the Ballard and Ballard FL Flower Company a Hired Man hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of his pencil and Mr Balor said to him says why haven't you got a an eraser he said I don't make mistakes you know there's people that think like that true that's right there are PE there are Christians ministers human beings that think they don't make no mistakes how many of you here have ever made one mistake see something wrong see so every hand somebody should have just stood up but a few people don't want to raise a hand I want make a mistake I want to witness that everybody makes mistakes huh yes you made a mistake not raising your hand so if you never had made a mistake before you just made one I don't make mistakes he says he says then I can't use you because if you make mistakes if you don't make mistakes you won't do nothing that's true God don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he holds you responsible for your willful sin he that sins willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called and God is in his heart he'll Rise Again amen all of us make mistakes all of us say things that we shouldn't say we do things that we shouldn't do we're wrong we're wrong so many times but I'm so glad the Lord doesn't hold it against us he looks at our heart he looks at what our desire is and he judges us accordingly here what the prophet says yes amen paragraph 31 I like that for any good soldier if he's apt to get wounded or hurt but if he's a if he's a still a soldier and got a purpose and something to fight for he'll rise and try again any good soldier of the Cross will do the same thing and to Joshua the new commander of the army after Moses had passed on seeing that God stayed with him in his mistakes he held his commission up prise the Lord no matter what Moses done it was Moses's office that God respected he was prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than any Prophet they had when his own sister laughed at him for marrying an Ethiopian girl he called them together he says don't you fear God said if there be among you one who is spiritual or a prophet I will speak to him in visions and make myself known to him in dreams but it's not so with Moses I speak lip to ear with him don't you fear God see that's not a good thing to trap upon God's people you hurt him when you do so God had commissioned Moses his failures meant nothing God knowed his heart and God knows your heart my brother my sister I'm so glad if nobody else knows my heart he does he knows your heart sister he knows your heart brother amen young man he knows your heart and if in your heart you really want to serve him you really want to do what's right you really want to be pleasing to him God knows that and so we serve him that way many Christians feel so guilty and they're always guilty living under guilt all the time but go back and look at your motives and your objectives you come back you make a mistake you have a little weakness in your life or trouble in your life and you'll make a mistake you'll slip you get caught up and the issues and the problems come and then there's that old devil to come whisper in your ear that about your your faults and your failures and your mistakes he'll whisper those mistakes to you so bad you wouldn't even want to come to church you won't even want to say Amen or praise the Lord or nothing because of all of your mistakes and your faults and your failures but God looks at your heart I'm so glad he looks at the man's heart because he knows men in and out through and through and if in your heart you want to serve him he'll make a way for you to serve him yes he does he give you the grace to serve him he does he knows the heart of man sometimes the words of man can deceive many but God looks at the heart and God judges man upon the heart but the prophet says that he knew what was in Moses's heart didn't matter what he did because he knew what was in his heart Lord glory to his name Glory oh my so we see this was Joshua's example in this example now he has the Assurance to know as that God is going to be with him like he was with Moses now the prophet of God also tells us that Joshua um didn't make the mistakes that Moses made and that um he actually um was he he he did better than than what Moses did he actually succeeded in the great purpose of Abraham's Vision that we read last week that I am going to raise up a people that your seed will be in bondage for 400 years and then after the 400 years I will uh deliver them with the mighty hand how many remember that that was spoken to Abraham Abram he said I'm going to bless you I'm going to bless your seed after you and years and years and years and years later your seed will multiply and they'll go down into a land and they will be afflicted by another nation and they will treat them horribly and Cru and then I'm going to deliver them with the mighty hand and then here the Great Commission is to get out of Egypt and then go over into the promised land this was the position for Joshua and Caleb so it wasn't just that God delivered them and kept them alive from all of The Temptations of the Brethren of the 10 uh temptations that they had to overcome in years of being able to resist the temptation and then going through the 40 extra years of running around in the wilderness until they died off the men of War died off and they had all of this Commission Now it wasn't just that they just survived they're just alive now they're going to go in and possess the land this was the position of the holy spirit this is the position of the last day messenger this is the position of any Minister that loves you is to get you to cross over into the promises of the most high God God made promises for us we're not just here to play Church we're not just here to Fu the pews but we want the promises the blessings the anointing the Holy Ghost is our promise I want a holy ghost Revival down in my soul I want the Holy Ghost In My Worship in my singing in my preaching the Holy Ghost is our promise amen hallelujah we're not just surviving we're not just alive but we're praising him worshiping him moving in the spirit casting out Devils Hallelujah laying hands on the sick unsaved people getting saved demons cast off of people these signs shall follow them that believe the works that I do shall you do also even Greater Works hallah is true is that right Saints yes that's right amen Greater Works amen the Greater Works ain't building buildings the Greater Works ain't building schools thank God for him the Greater Works ain't getting a new place thank the Lord for it the Greater Works is the Holy Ghost getting a hold of every believer and manifesting himself in their life amen how many wants more of God Amen how many wants the promises of God manifested in your life amen amen if that means the key the song leader is out of key so be it did the Holy Ghost come down amen this one was late and this one fell asleep did the Holy Spirit bless you did you move into the promises of God what did you get out of the service amen amen and then the question is what did you put in amen they sit back with their hands closed like make me Praise Him bless me if you got one no no no no no the the the the psalmist David said I Will Bless The Lord talking about the lord to bless me now how many come to bless the Lord I Will Bless The Lord At when time at all times and his Praises his Praises shall continually be in my mouth Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus yes feel like I'm Pentecostal this morning I will bless the Lord in the morning I will bless the Lord all the days of I Will Bless The Lord at all times and his praises shall continually be in my mouth glory amen glory to God so they crossed over they accomplished something didn't they Hallelujah they moved by the spirit they took Jericho the commission was in Jericho Hallelujah March around yes sir this city six days hallelujah just do it six times why we got to do it six why not five why not three it's always somebody true look would you want God to talk to you and Joshua he told Joshua six times you know what's interesting people will have no path No Escape Route no answer and then when the answer is delivered to them they'll take it and then they'll begin to critique the one that gave the answer like to start looking back at God like why are we doing it this way well why are you even here because he called you six times around the other churches ain't doing that Pastor over there a do that why they walk why we walking around six time and I can't say nothing don't say nothing if you got something to say stay home in the six days all right on the seventh day we want you to shout but we going to tell you when the show this is Joshua's instructions tell me what that look like tell me what that looks like from Jericho spot they're looking at him like what they doing what they doing they walking around day one they go back ain't nothing going on what's going on day two they go all these all of Israel marching around they watching them watching that's day two man what's going on day three is like oh here we go again day four man let's have a party day five man this the same old thing they ain't got nothing going on day six uhoh wait a minute the plans changed day six on the seventh day March around the seven times and then when I say shout shout blow the trumpets and let out a shout and when they blew out a trumpet and they let out a shout the walls came down all the walls came down at the instruction of Joshua which was the Holy Ghost exactly let the Lord lead you my brother my sister the Lord Jesus Christ let him lead you he will identify himself to you personally it's got to make sense to you God's not trying to pull nothing over on you don't take my word for it or somebody some other fast talker's word for it get down on your knees and let the Lord reveal to you and when he reveals it I tell you it's the most beautiful thing when the Lord opens your eyes to a truth he gives you something to stand on and you don't have to ask nobody nobody permission you stand on God's word because God said so that's why I preach it cuz God said so that's why he's a Healer cuz he said he was a Healer that's why he'll save my family cuz he said he was Hallelujah glory amen God said so yes imagine Noah taking a position like that nobody else took that position that it's going to rain building an ark how many seen the ark enclosure there in cinnati or Ohio tremendous work he built it it was his message it was his life he didn't have no friends that say yep that's how you do it he stayed with the word God gave him the blueprint he stayed with that word he worked with that word until God begin to Vindicated years later we see that Noah was right everybody else was wrong because Noah was standing on God's word what was his word it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain that's my sermon it's going to rain get your house in order get your light it's going to rain get into the ark it's going to [Music] [Applause] rain Hallelujah but he stayed with it didn't he all the science bless the Lord all the unbelievers come out to see what Noah's doing EXA we never saw that before what you tring nobody else preaching that way everybody else taking the pictures down we should take ours down too can I slide that in there let me slide that in everybody else is doing this so we show me the scripture where everybody else I'm supposed to follow what chapter what verse it's everybody else everybody else is going to do exactly what God's word said they going to do believer make believer and unbeliever they're all recorded and the True Believer stays with God's word hallelujah amen glory hallelujah it's ridiculous sometimes it seems lonely huh huh but he told Joshua don't let the book leave out of your mouth stay with that original commission what was the original commission the words of Moses you got to quote him you got to bring him to the people Moses said this in the law Moses said that in the law Moses said this Moses said that prise the Lord the prophet said I'm going to get to it yes Hallelujah 58 times in the Book of Joshua we Moses is gone why Joshua still talking about Moses because those are the instructions stay with that word am if Joshua failed to do that his ministry would fail Joshua a type of the Holy Spirit a type of the last day ministry right last day believer you sisters can take Joshua as your example you don't have to be a preacher or a pastor take Joshua as your example don't turn to the right or to the left stay right with that word and there is your success amen amen you know God honored Moses's office huh can I get to that just for a little bit I'm going to close this now God honored Moses's office paragraph number 32 he says this here Glory name no matter what Moses done paragraph 33 it was Moses's office that God respected he was a prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than prophets that he had so let me ask you this what is your office today do you know your office your office my office our office is the office of a Believer amen we're not explainers we're not make Believers we are True Believers and that's our position so what does a Believer do Believers have promises and God respects the office of his elect touch not my anointed wherever the anointing is that's where God is remember Paul pers Saul persecuting the church the Lord told him he says you're hard for you to kick against the Pricks he says who am I persecuting you're persecuting me that's me you're persecuting who is he persecuting people like you and I Believers that is your office that God's respect God doesn't respect your emotions your upset Ness your worry and all God respects you as a Believer you believe God's word you get God's attention he loves it yes he does when you put him to the test he loves it when you claim every promise when there is no evidence that it's getting any better he loves when you testify before the blessing come and you testify anyway that all is well everything is taken care of I'm already healed it's taken care of he loves it yes he does am am anybody can testify after it's done but Believers testify what the word says about the situation amen amen amen hallelujah God bless you one last little portion I want to get here this is on the commission of Joshua this is the this is the importance of his commission paragraph 37 now Joshua the new Warrior only two left now that ever left the promised land that was Joshua and Caleb now Joshua the new Commander to lead an army to step into the place where great man like Moses stood it was no little task and think of a minister today that's called of God to step into the tracks where Jesus stood what a command what a commission but each that's called of God is commissioned to stand in the same in that same place I'll be with you even in you to the end of the way each minister is called to stand where he did so so so we ain't calling up other people to find out where we supposed to stand no my position in my stand is in God's word same for you stand in the tracks each minister is the ordained of God it's commanded to stand in the tracks of Jesus Christ and perform the duties that Jesus performed that's quite a command is it yes it is you can't do this on the side this is your life now we have to do the impossible is that right yes we have to call on God right we we have to believe he's going to do it we have to believe it's already done uhhuh you got to demand of God you have to call on him amen yes let's take this here in uh the second-handed robe then give it to you but it's 1956 a second-handed robe paragraph 113 and and my brother don't you be afraid to ask God anything we got to get this up here because we're G to read it together in a minute and my brother paragraph don't be afraid to ask God anything you must demand God or ask God for anything that he has promised for if I am introducing in a God that's omnipotent and all powerful and if I be a servant of God I must do the work works of God and if I do the works of God I must demand of God to bring these things to pass because he's demanding of me to produce the impossible I have to ask him I have to call upon him and stand there and say God you promised it so do you every person God you promised it you promised it Lord you promised [Music] it to do the impossible I've got to have God give it to meu so that I can complete the task getting all these people to cross over into their Ministry and place them in their position was Joshua's tremendous task he had that task to do and he did a very fine job didn't he Joshua was no joke there's a lot of people playing around playing church but not Joshua there probably a lot of foolishness you couldn't run by him either huh and the elders that serve with him what a legacy praise the Lord what a Ministry and we see the type we see the Shadow and here is the day we're supposed to live it that's the shadow what's it reflected upon right 2102 East Broadway right on your Pew take that shadow of the Old Testament and it's pointing right at you brother sister don't try to pass it off on nobody else it's talking God's demanding of you to get the task done to get the job done Joseph got the job done didn't he Abraham got the job done Daniel got the job done job got the job done the Old Testament Saints they got it done what about uslu what about us are you getting it done Lord say yes I'm getting it done by his grace My Confession that was the shadow what the shadow reflect ref in on it's not just Bible stories in Sunday school it's reflecting on you you have to demand God to get the impossible done in your life there's nothing too hard for God Joshua commanded the son to stand still didn't he yes he called on God well Moses never did that no one else no Joshua did it called the son to stand still I'm in the battle I need more time stand still I'm doing something for the Lord and this is all in my way stand still that's what he did Joshua the believer huh yes he'll do it for you too he'll get you to get the impossible done God bless you so much thank the Lord for his goodness to usj as we just highlight a little bit of the life of Joshua for you and I to find our position and stand as a Believer right we find that place don't we it's so nice to know our season and our time and we have to be able to say I believe we can say this is that day that the prophet spoke about remember the day of Pentecost the spokesman Peter said this is that that Joel talked about so what did he do there was something taking place today and he went back and picked up the prophecy of Joel that's what you and I do today yes the prophet talked about it no so we can talk think about it in 1965 or 1963 or the ad or BC it's so where does it reflect today yes this is what the prophet talked about that's why I'm standing the where I'm standing the prophet told me to the shadows and the types don't fail brother random says you watch the Shadows you watch the types they don't fail there's always been crazy folks in our midst it's always been unbelievers always been people getting persecuted there always the wrong suffering or the right suffering for the wrong that's always been there they treat you right they're unfair to you they lied on you they to on you they stole from you it's all through the Bible it's happened and it will continue to happen what kind of position are you going to take as a Believer though Joseph kept his Integrity through all that he went through they lied on him they accused him of things that was horrible they sold him into slavery because he had dreams they did all this and he stayed with it he stayed with it he stayed with it and it looked like he probably wanted to give up no doubt he wanted to give up but he didn't give up did he and God was looking at him all the time and God said I'mma turn it around and when God turns it around he turns very well he knows how to turn the situation very well and those that were hating him and those that were criticizing him are now looking to him for salvation if Joseph fails everybody else fails but because Joseph kept his Faith he was able to save his daddy his family his Brethren Lord Egypt Pharaoh everybody was blessed because of this one man if you get your position right everybody in your job will be grateful everyone in your family everything around you your neighborhood the birds flying over your house will be blessed because the blessing of the Lord is upon you you walk outside the blessing is there it's always go get the the bless the Lord said I'll never leave you or forsake you how many thank the Lord for that amen you're Believers this morning you're a Believer he's going to work it out for you God bless you let us pray Lord Jesus thank you for your word today thank you for
