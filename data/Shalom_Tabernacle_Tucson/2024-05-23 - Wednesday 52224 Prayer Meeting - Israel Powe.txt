as the song says may you grant that uh we pray pray in Jesus name amen well God bless each of you Saints it's so good to be in the house of the Lord with you tonight we're gonna go right into the word of the Lord in um conduct order and Doctrine we're on the doctrine part two um they will not endure sound Doctrine it's the title of the message uh tonight 2 Timothy chapter 4 this is where we want to take our scriptures amen looking forward to um or I'm thanking the lord for the services we had this past weekend it's just a refreshing of the Holy Spirit and we need that don't we more of it thank God for it last week Wednesday we spoke on the importance of sound Doctrine and that there's a a a true doctrine that is important for each believer to to be a part of and it's not just words but that Doctrine has to become a revelation to the believer also but in the scripture here in second Timothy CH 4 verse one I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching HS and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned to fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work in of evangelists make full proof of thy Ministry for I am now ready to be offered in the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but to but unto all them also that love his appearing amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be SE seated what a declaration not only to me but also to them that love his appearing now this Doctrine we know as we shared with you last time it is the receiving or the revealing of something it's something that is received there are instructions it's learning it's teaching it's Insight the Greek word for it in the Hebrew is uh leak and that's basically what that means a learning a teaching and we find that in the Old Testament that this Doctrine was um spoken of throughout the Bible you know for many of us today ministers and and groups of people like if we go to preach for one another like message churches we call it um or a ministers meeting we kind of know not to what we call get into Doctrine just preach on the lovely things the wonderful things that we all agree upon and so um but there are some uh there are what we call the doctrines of the word of the Lord and at the end of the day what I have in just in my own heart I've looked at the doctrines the ones that are out there that people say is so important and I say it's so important different doctrines at the end of the day what is it producing so if if your Doctrine in water baptism is correct then that's going to translate right over to your Doctrine or revelation of who Jesus is the deity of Christ because when you find out that the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit is the same person when you go into the water or you read Matthew 28:19 the understanding of it is that those three are one and so they're not three separate people and these you know there's several places in the word where if your teaching is right should directly affect your conduct the way you do and behave and at the end of the day uh brother brandom gives us example many times in the message he says some believe that he's coming on a white cloud some believe that he's coming on a white horse um and they'll argue and fuss and actually separate over it but the real big picture is we all believe that he's coming how he's coming what methods he uses all of that is debatable and at the end of the day can't we just surround ourselves that he's coming right and and so we have found a way to create reasons to disagree with one another it's part of our DNA it seems I want to fight with you and I'm G to find a reason to fight with you and and it it I made the comment about the angel of the Lord teaching brother brandom this message and that comment I read it here many times and I want to go and I want to read those statements just for a moment and this brings the importance to us of why we quote him and why we believe that this message is true now in the message um go Be not Afraid 1960 and these are very very very powerful quotes and it's just really when you think of it it really helps you to know where you stand or it should 1960 56 now now I reg you all as my friends and my brothers and sisters I expect to spend eternity with in glory and if you disagree with me on my teaching that's perfectly all right but I believe if you'll search your Bible right good you'll find out it's on the mark Cuz first first the angel of the Lord come to me and taught it to me then he showed me in the Bible where to find it I've got to find the first man that came down can can down it and that's been years it's the truth yes sir some great theologians I've talked to when it's finally come to a showdown say we know it's right but our church would put us out if we accepted that all right if you think more of your church than you do of Christ that's up to you but for me I stand on the word beautiful quote brother bam continues in paragraph number three in the message the Messiah and he's talking about when he was teaching on the church ages the church age uh message series The Church Ages were before the seals were preached and some people they want to show a difference in his teachings before the seals and after the seals and they can go that route if they if they decide to and if you're going to go that route then put put everything he said before the seals away including your Bible all right because the Bible was written before he preached the seals okay right paragraph number three in the message the Messiah says and while I was speaking on that and turn then to pray for the sick the angel of the Lord came right down before them all went right over and stood in the corner there and 300 or more people stood and looked at it for 15 minutes screaming crying praising God all of them look the first time it ever come like that before our church just come right in and move right over there and stood there I said can you see it everybody began screaming and falling there it was the big Amber light of the pillar of fire just as perfectly round standing there then it be to shade itself and shaded every one of those Church ages just exactly the way I taught them in that Pillar of Fire God knows that's the truth here before his Bible so here brother randam is teaching on the church ages he shows The Seven Ages Shades them out and then the Holy Spirit comes in the pillar of fire visibly amongst the congregation and shades itself exactly the way he taught it so who's following who all right paragraph 178 and the godhead explained I'm reading these quotes Saints because you either got to believe what he said or what somebody else said that's and if you're going to believe what he said this is what he said he said the angel of the Lord taught him showed it to him in the Bible now either that you believe that or you don't if you don't believe it then fine but if you say you believe this message that's where it comes from and then if you're speaking against the teaching then really who are you speaking against paragraph 178 and the godhead explained the prophet of God says this here paragraph 181 but the only way that I can have faith in God is to know that the Bible is right and believe it's right and stay right with it though I don't understand it I move it anyhow but when these contradictions come up then I go before God to find out and the same angel that meets me in the meeting at night is the same one who taught me this see now see if this how this is is now trying to do God of service 1965 paragraph number 74 he says this here I'm not disregarding my Presbyterian Brethren there and some of you Baptist Brethren on the way you have security I'm not saying this to be different but you didn't have it just right see that's right see but I had it wrong too but when an angel stands from heaven and tells you and here it is right in the scriptures that's true see that's right see he always speaks exactly with the scripture amen how many know you've had it wrong too but when an angel comes and shows you in the scripture then you know how to change don't you change your ideas so this do Doctrine and there's many I just want to deal maybe with the principles of how we handle Doctrine and the importance of it that there are uh truths all throughout the Bible there's little bitty truths on how to do things and maybe the order of things and then there's some great and tremendous truths that Satan has come in and tried to twist it to to overthrow the faith of some and there are doctrines and there's truths throughout the Bible that are not what I would call Salvation issues your salvation isn't dependent upon it one of those examples brother bam gives is he says that if a Catholic man or Presbyterian man is depending on Jesus Christ for salvation he said he is saved huh that's what he said if he's depending upon his church he's lost because salvation comes through Jesus Christ and our understanding of who Jesus Christ is should always be growing our Doctrine and our understanding should always be growing and we know there's some false Doctrine but there's a true Doctrine too so let's let's take a few minutes and deal with this Doctrine on the serpent seed now this is in 1954 he's dealing with his own people in his own congregation and questions and answers number one and he says this in paragraph 124 he says now where I think that came from now here's a little of my own Doctrine now it's just church folks see I think that Cain was the son of Satan I know you disagree with that my own church does but till God shows me different I believe the same thing see he was the son of Satan cuz I couldn't place that ungodly murderous Spirit coming out of God no sir he had to be after his daddy and his daddy was here when Satan got upon the serpent so he goes on uh yeah I'll continue the serpent was not a reptile the curse made him a reptile he was just like a man he walked upright and he was with this woman out there and she committed this adultery and brought forth her first son which was Cain the nature of his daddy I believe that big beast was up like a man he walked upright and that's where these great Giants come from yeah that's exactly now that's my own thought and I could be wrong that's my thought see but they were great men so here look at the attitude of brother Brandon even the people his own people didn't agree with all of his Doctrine but he had to stay true to what the Lord showed him and and this is this is a beautiful place uh for me to just say this right here uh you can't make God show you anything and furthermore you can't make God show somebody else something that's individual that's a personal experience when it happens it's beautiful when it happens to you and you just move on with the Lord in humility when he opens your eyes or something but by the same token you can't you can't pretend like you see something when you don't really see it that's not being genuine that's not allowing for God to deal with you you're taking somebody else's word for you're taking the group Revelation on but it's so much nicer when you wrestle it out for yourself and those back desert experiences in your prayer closet on your knees trying to Grapple with the deep subject and you can't understand what everybody's talking about but if you're sincere and you lay before God God is the one is in charge of all of that it's not you arguing with me or me arguing with you and I'm winning argument it ain't about that it's about God coming down and revealing to you the individual what your how you're supposed to handle the word and when you do that you don't have to wait for men's Applause when God shows you a truth you get up you preach it you stay with it and it's a revelation now it might cause a little friction it might cause a little misunderstanding but it's true to you amen and that's what we want all the doctrine to be brother Israel are there places in the word that you don't quite understand many and those questionable places I never bring them to the pull pit here there's no value in it to the people that I'm preaching to I have so much that I can bring to you that uh we need to eat on that we're talking about the other part of the Lamb let's with this with the part that we're chewing on right now for the rest of our life maybe and say what about this and what about that what about this and we can't even get the love part right amen and so there's places I see some things said and I try to put that together in my own mind I'm just it's on the Shelf to be honest with you just being honest but then the things that I am preaching I'm trusting by God's grace those are the things that I see with all of my heart I remember one time it was years ago maybe 22 years ago a brother came to me and he asked me why I didn't preach on the seven Thunders why I'm not preaching these things because he heard a few tapes of some group and he was affiliated with a group and he asked he said brother you've been preaching these years I heard you preach why aren't you preaching these things and I thought well when am I supposed to preach them he's like well you should be preaching I I thought I was supposed to preach what was on my heart all right like what's real to me and come to find out that this brother is trying to get me to go that way go that way and then three years later he's not even in that church no more that's right he's not even preaching the seven Thunders no more so you see if you go around following people they haven't found their destination God have mercy you start following so me and my wife went to this um little musical Thing the other day the other night there was invited to this this kid this child this young man was playing this little piece so we went to it and after they had concessions in a another little area so we got up we wasn't going to go there we just got up I knew where we were going so we got in front of the crown and we took off walking very confidently and then this group of young people were following following us and then I turned around cuz I forgot some I turned around and this group was following us they say well aren't you going to the reception I was like no oh we thought that's where we going that's why we just followed you and that's what some people do they follow people that look like they know where they going you don't even know where they going it's amazing I saw that study one time if a man in a crowd they take a group of people just have them sitting there randomly if one guy gets up and starts heading in the direction looks like he knows where he's going people will just follow without asking and that's the nature of people but we thank the Lord that we got somebody to follow and it starts on our knees I don't have to pretend to say Amen to something when I can really say Amen to something that God is revealing to me and this Doctrine is a part of that brother random says in condemnation by representation paragraph number 19 you know if we all go this morning get fingerprints there's none of us here have thumbs look alike they claim there's no two noses alike I guess you're all glad it don't look like mine but there's no two people exactly alike so two things so remember we'll all admit and agree that we love the Lord Jesus upon on those if a Roman Catholic if he's depending on the Catholic Church which is their fundamental Doctrine but if he believes that the Catholic church is going to save him he's lost but if he's got faith in Jesus Christ God's son and depending on him for salvation he's saved if a Methodist or a Pentecostal or a Baptist if they're depending on their church or organization to save them they lost but if they're depending on Jesus Christ and accepted him because it's your own personal faith in Christ Jesus that saves us whether you're Baptist Pentecostal Lutheran Catholic Jew or what more it's your personal faith in Jesus Christ how many can say praise the Lord to that so that's the big picture right there that's the main um thing that we try to bring people to a faith in the Lord Jesus Christ this is his word believe it and you are saved believe him you'll be saved now how far are you going to go what he wants to reveal to you well just stay humble believe it with all your heart and God will lead you in his own time amen now this scripture in second Timothy chapter 4 that we read it's a prophetic scripture and it pertains to us Believers as of i as I've said in some of my notetaking if we were to rewrite a version of the Bible as it pertains to this message we would have to write in the footnotes under sec Timothy chapter 4 the great vision that came to brother brandham when he dedicated his first Tabernacle if that was the case if there was going to be they have the NIV the ESV The New American Standard Version of the Bible Living Word all these different interpretations and biblical notes but as a Believer um there are several places in the scripture Genesis 24 would be another one that we would put who that El was a type of for this day in second Timothy chapter 4 was a scripture that the voice of the Lord or the angel of the Lord spoke to brother brandham when he was dedicating and laying the Cornerstone in his church now before I get to that let me take this message a court trial 1964 paragraph number one you see it's paragraph number one just dropped down just a little bit I see you many of you perhaps take the tapes and so forth which my Ministry in that way goes around around the world everywhere many times you hear me say those denominations and kind of condemn denominations it isn't I'm condemning the people I'm condemning the system see not the denomination the people in there oh no my people formerly were catholic I'm Irish descent they're Catholic and I know there's some fine Catholic people some of them are my own people they're fine they're fine Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran every denomination's fine people but them systems that got us that keep us separated that's the thing I'm against We Are One in heart we must be that way then our systems see draw a doctrinal line and that in the first church if the first church ever started the first church any church would say we believe this and in their Doctrine with the comma instead of a period there'd never be nothing but one church that's all see we believe this plus as much as God will let us know otherwise but when we say we believe this and this is it and that is all then we die right there you see because God is eternal and he's growing on so you see the attitude towards our Doctrine and what we hold so dear and so important is we believe this Plus whatever God will show us there's a childlike quality to that there's a set and listen wait and listen quality to that it's a it's a it's a ever um growing understanding that God is constantly giving the believer we see this progression even in brother Brandon's life and that's should be our attitude ude in particular with the visions and the things surrounding the coming of the lord we have the first second and third pool which most church or the church denomination out there don't know anything we're talking about when we refer to that but but we do we know what it is we know what it what it's referring to and um there's a lot of visions and quotations that are out there that simply uh we don't have the answer to all of it we just don't and and many have taken one position and said this is it and they've stayed with that and they've died on the hill with that so to speak they've drawn the lines I know many of them have made that the word test of whether or not someone's in the bride or not is their own Doctrine but you don't see the consistent teaching of that subject in brother Bran's Ministry that way you'll see those comments that he made but you don't see him teaching it or handling it that way throughout his ministry and so this is something that uh that I believe the Lord wants us the attitude that we should have is that I believe this plus whatever the Lord is going to show me or show us um one of the um one of the doctrines that started was and brother bam says it and I'll I'll deal with just this one because it's something that comes up it seems like even in our church and around is this brother brandom being the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ now he deals with it in a couple of places Revelations chap 5 number one and then the everpresent water from the rock I don't want to take uh too much time on this but I just want to touch on this one because he actually tells us where and how this particular Doctrine got started I I'll just say this in the message Revelations chapter 5 number one he says remember if you ever believe me if you ever believe me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an error it's falsely thus saith the Lord it is wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother sorry sis I didn't give you that but let's pick that up real quick because I think I need to bring that and then I'll bring this next one it's in the message Revelations chapter 5 number one and we'll take brother we'll take paragraph number 41 those of you are interested that's the reference you can go and hear it and you really should hear it and rehear it and reread it yourself you'll see where some of these things come from paragraph 41 in Revelations chapter 5 number one I said Well it can't hurt very much longer now because I I believe the brother realizes the Brethren that what would happen I said it's mortally wounded so it'll die and I asked many of my members of my church here in this Tabernacle with brother Neville and a n that's come approaching me with that same question brothers sisters haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you have not I tried to be your brother now whatever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's a spirit but I hope that today that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so I can return back to the ministry until then I'll ask you each one pray for me I don't know what I'll do my place is up for sale I just can't stand it I stay around I'll go completely Stark mad and I ask you to pray for me and remember if you ever believe me if you ever believe me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an error it's falsely thus sayith the lord it's wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother so here brother random is dealing with the group of brothers that saw his ministry so great so tremendous that they started to make him him something that the Lord did not make him they started to and you see that that spirit is still out there some baptized in his name and they did the same thing with John they did the same thing with many of the misplaced who this great anointed one is they'll misplace it and they um and brother randam had to deal with it he's trying to deal with this church and he he heard it once he heard it twice and then he thought he dealt with it the Lord show shows them a dream of blasting the head of this Serpent and or or or mortally wounding it and he thought that was it was over and then he goes on and he says this in the message everpresent water from the rock rock this is the one I did give you in paragraph 33 and he says this here I do not desire to have any more discernment see now here's what happened I've tried and I know I've done things that's wrong but I have tried to live close enough to God all the time to God that's how these Visions would happen how they would take place even people would lose things and call me up ask me to go pray to the Lord to ask where it was at like Jesse lost him mules and the boys went down to find the prophet and he told them where the mules had done return home so forth like that that is perfectly all right but it gets so much of it so many people just not in the locality like this it's worldwide see so it just gets keeps me so tore up and then keeping you right on the edge all the time till it got to a place and that's what caused the Brethren to get the doctrine started that I was the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ so what got it start started what God had started are we here tonight yes what God had started was the visions and the way the Lord would Ed him he lived so close to God and the Brethren seeing this and this what got this Doctrine started that I was the incarnated Lord Jesus Christ and we know that would just tear the ministry all the pieces and bring a reproach upon Christ and everything see so that's the reason I had to give them a great shake to stop it right at once to let them know that that was not of God that was of the devil see and they're good people and it showed those people are born again of the spirit of God because when they seen Truth by the scripture they returned to God exactly see immediately so that showed it was Satan trying to do something with the people they were all Godly Christian people so the prophet of God is there correcting a doctrine that started with people it didn't start with him it started with people we call this the doctrine of men or the ideas of men and there's a doctrine that started and in our church that all the brothers had to wear long sleeve shirts and then some of them started one that no facial hair I'm talking about in organization denomination and then some started it's all kind of little doctrines no wedding rings no jewelry at at all at all those are teachings in churches there all kind of doctr little man-made doctrines the women sit on one side of the church men on the other side of the church there's churches that teach that as a Doctrine churches that teaches the W the covering from a woman's hair yeah don't cut her here but her covering is a veil or a hat so every time she prayed she'd have to put a hat or a covering on there's a teaching that taught brother McHugh was in that the communion was spiritual communion didn't literally have to take it and so these are I mean it's just the world is full of it but see the the doctrine is what separates us from all the other groups this is what makes makes us who we are so this prophecy how many love the Lord tonight are we there are we together this Doctrine is what the Bible says they will not endure sound Doctrine speaking of a coming day that the the the the doctrine would people would Heap up to themselves their own teachers having engineers the people would not endure sound Doctrine that's the prophecy and so brother brandom continues in this message here and says this here in taking sides with Jesus paragraph number 6 64 I believe that the Lord has used me in little special things to help maybe lay a foundation for a prophet that will come but a prophet doesn't operate the way I operate now you know that a prophet isn't an evangelist and an evangelist isn't a prophet a pastor isn't an evangelist and an evangelist isn't a pastor but God has said in the church first apostles then prophets then teachers then pastors and and so forth God set them in the church and God gave them an office but the morning when I laid the Cornerstone because now if you're spiritual you'll get it because of the Cry of the people if you could break that out and take that book and read it it said do the work of an evangelist didn't call me to be an evangelist but said do the work of an evangelist for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but shall Heap to themselves teach together teachers having itching ears and shall turn from the truth to Fable see quoted that scripture and told me where to find it said it three times and I got the Bible and turned to where he told me and there it was and then you know about the two buckets of the Pentecostal Oneness and the Pentecostal assemblies I never crossed them I planted their own trees right where they was because I think they're both wrong but out of it I was at the cross at the Harvest God respects anybody who is Sincere Peter said that he perceived that God was no respect of persons All Nations calling when on that house of Cornus when they receiv received the Holy Ghost like they did at the beginning see God is no respect of persons we see a person deeply ins sincere he can be sincerely wrong but if he is sincerely God will lead him to the light somewhere he'll come to it because God is obligated to do that how many thank God for that the sincerity being sincerely and and you really deeply sincerely God is obligated to lead him to the life so let's take this scripture one more time another quote second Timothy chapter 4 again and this quote here in spiritual food and and and sorry in the message ashame 1965 I just have two more okay 227 let us not be ashamed when we stand before people Wicked indifferent people religious whatever it is as Paul told Timothy let us be instant and season out of season reprove and rebuke with all longsuffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall Heap for themselves together teachers having itching ears and will be turned from the truth to fables God we're living in that day you've let me live long enough to see that happen as that lays right here in the Cornerstone of this Tabernacle today of 33 years ago so here he is 1965 reading the scripture that was a prophecy to him personally to his ministry and now he is 33 years later he actually sees this come to pass remember it was not signs wonders and miracles was wasn't the problem they had with brother brandom it was not the problem they had with Jesus the problem that they had with Jesus was his words he's making himself God except you eat my flesh and drink my blood it was his words the problem they had with brother brandom was not that he filled up their churches not his signs wonders and miracles not was his honesty his Integrity the life that he lived that wasn't a problem they had the problem they had was his Doctrine and this was a for warning to him now he tells us in um um the present state of my Ministry I'm not going to quote it but he says it in there that for 33 years or 20 something years 28 years or something he never read the second half of that scripture it was it was later on that he read the second half of that prophecy in that scripture to go do the work of an evangelist go reprove and rebuke with all longsuffering for the time will come that they will not endure sound Doctrine here he is 1965 July in the message of shamed he says God you let me live long enough to see that day come now remember he had doors open for him at the beginning of his ministry they wanted him they loved him they flew him all over they wanted him brother Brandon's Ministry in in their Tabernacle and their churches the problem they had was when he started to bring the doctrine the word now in the message spiritual food and do season brother brandham says this here I think this is my last quote but he says now paragraph 140 1 now I haven't had a prayer line of this type for a long long time how many remembers my commission when we built the Tabernacle here said do the work in of evangelist didn't say I was an evangelist says do the work of an evangelist see for the hour will come when that's to be changed that hour is arriving all right now in this you can't mix two or three different Ministries together pastor and evangelize the same time you can't be a prophet and maybe a pastor at the same time see because you have different Works different Ministry but the lord gave me what I should do in my message but then he said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the hour will arrive when they will not endure sound Doctrine if that hasn't come now every church denomination has turned me down they wouldn't endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust they'll bring their own teachers in and they'll be turned into fables and they will do great things of exploits like Janice and jambers that withstood Moses but their Folly will be made manifest see see all right impersonations so here brother vam Nails it that all of the denominations turned him down what did they turn down they turn down the do the doctrine the doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ for this day remember the gestra restored signs wonders and miracles restored all of those things were restored the leaves the fellowship was restored and also the doctrine was restored that was restored and that was the that's the critical piece and this is the part that they won't endure they can endure but we know that this doctrine that we believe come and was ministered to The Prophet by an Angel so that's that's the position that we take and you know you can you can you can lighten up on one point or maybe get too hard on another point no matter how you bring it or preach it somebody's going to say Amen to you and some of some people are not going to agree with you that's just the way it goes so at the end of the day you got to be true to the word that God has revealed to you amen God reveals that word to you and that word has to be an absolute to you then you stand on it it becomes the doctrine of the word the doctrine of the Lord and this Doctrine is the lifeline that's what protects us from um um that's what protects the lifeline is the Bark on the tree amen it's that bark on the tree that protects that Lifeline now I've seen this as I said there are some things that are not what I call Salvation issues and they're not important not that they're not important but they're not a Salvation issue as it pertains to God sending a Prophet this glorious message is true um whether or not someone wants to hang the pictures up at their church that to me that's not a Salvation issue that's a personal choice communion twice a year or once a month those are not salvation issues to me um you every church is you know Sovereign they do the things the way they want to do but there are some doctrines that are detrimental that actually overthrow the faith of some and this is where the scripture is talking about let's see if we can take it here real quickly I think it's in second Timothy chapter or 1 Timothy Chapter 2 quickly see if we can find it real quick 1 Timothy chapter 4 veres 1 and two read this for you last time it's that scripture I want to take this one but there's one maybe you can get it for me brother George it says overthrow the faith of some yeah grab that one for me in 1 Timothy chapter 4 and verses 1 and two it's directly speaking of the last days and the latter times it says now the spirit speaks speaketh expressedly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and what doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with the hot iron two let me see if 218 yeah all right let me get the Bible here let's stay with that one 1 Timothy chapter 4 and then I'll get second Timothy Chapter 2 quickly all right all right yeah so I'm in 1 Timothy chapter 4 verse 1- 2 and verse 6 it says if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things what things you're doing what Timothy if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou sh be a what good minister of Jesus Christ that's who we're trying to serve nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine where unto thou Hast attained but refuse profane and wild old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness for bodily exercise profit is little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come this is a faithful saying and worthy of all exception for therefore we both labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the Living God who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe these things command and teach verse 12 let no man despise thy use but be thou an example of Believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity yes till I come give attendance to reading to exhortation to what to Doctrine give attendance to this and he's telling this young man don't let no one despise your youth sometimes they'll despise that and tell you I've been in it for 40 years and I've been doing this for many years and I never saw that and I don't see it that way don't let nobody despise your youth if God gave you the word that's what you're supposed to be standing upon that's what you follow this becomes your standard you you've been brought up you've been taught up you heard pastors quote it you heard ministers quote it in special meetings even your own friends and people that that you follow that you love that but then you got to pick it up yourself and then you internalize what is being said here and then God gives you a revelation of it then then you go preach it without asking people permission if you can say it this way or not because it's a personal revelation to you thank God for it any man can pick up this word this young man here that one back there this one over here little bitty coming up can pick up this word and God will give them a revelation of the word where it's not them me patting them on the back and encouraging it's God himself self and he tells Timothy don't let nobody despise your youth you only been you only being a pastor for so long they ain't got nothing to do with it God gives you a revelation you hold on to that because the time will come they'll call you on the phone they'll send you an email they'll meet you for lunch doctrine that is not sound and what you going to stand on that's right the time will come and that time is here and their doctrines of devils the one translation I forget how I put this demons teaching doctrines think of that these are people that were with the faith and they've turned from the truth and now they got a seducing Spirit trying to catch and overthrow the faith of some let's take that one there and we'll close where was that at brother George second second Timothy 28 amen let's take this he's giving Timothy further admonishment starting in verse number one I thought I had it here yes I have second Timothy 3 2 Timothy 4 2 Timothy verse one thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus this is what I'm telling every young man here you know you young Brothers here you sisters you young people who are you are whoever you are newcomer Oldtimer this is what we this is what we're telling you here that that this word is sent to you as an individual it is sent to the age yes it's sent to the group yes but God sent Elijah to you yes personally how are you going to handle him he's in your home how you supposed to entertain this Prophet he's in your lap brother young man and brother all you brothers and sisters how are you supposed to entertain that it can't just be through what you get on Sunday morning can't be that ain't enough you you'll encounter demonic forces that even surround themselves around this word I've come in contact with them for years you have to demonic forces and then you have Believers they're True Believers but they're they're they're immature they're True Believers and they don't have a good stand on the word yet they're growing I'm not talking about I'm talking about a devil that attaches itself to this word for the purpose of causing some to stumble and fall this is where Doctrine protects the lifeline and you think it's love love love love founded around the word of God it's the love for the truth yes that's above everything else and I like this instruction here that Paul's giving Timothy strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may pleas him who hath chosen him to be a soldier if a man also strive for masteries yet he is not Crown except he strive lawfully the husbandman that waiteth must be first partakers of the fruits consider what I say and the Lord give thee understanding in all things remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel when I suffer trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory verse 11 it's a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we believe believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself of these things of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no Prophet but to the subverting of the hearers study to show thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed right ly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase un more ungodliness that's what we're seeing today and their word will eat as doth the canker of whom is hus and fitus who concerning the truth have aired saying the resurrection is passed already and overthrow the faith of some nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity verse 23 but foolish unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strives the servant of the Lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient and meek instructing those that oppose themselves if God preventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will now if you do a quick search we won't do it now of this henus and phius he Paul had to he had some strong words for them he condemned them let's see oh since I quoted let's see if we can find it here quickly all right I don't have my search here but somebody look this H is up 1 Corinthians 1 Timothy 1 120 okay let's see if we can find this gentleman 1 Timothy 1 what there is no one oh I'm in 220 yeah so there's 120 look at verse 20 verse 18 this charge I commend unto thee son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest War good Warfare holding faith and good conscience which some having put away concerning Faith have made shipwreck of whom is hus and Alexander whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme so you know these are hard words huh but it's true that's part of it we read some for you last week in Romans in first John second John that you don't partake with these men there's doctrine of devils they're evil they're seducers they try to turn turn you away from the truth from the word of God they're there they're around us they they're they intermingle they're trying to T they try to take you away from the truth of the word of God and that's and that's what um um you know that's the other point I'd like to bring as I brought it earlier you know what does the doctrine what's the end result leading you to you know the doctrine whatever we believe what does it really leading you to if you got a full understanding of the order of the Resurrection what is that for that's so you can have faith in the things that are to come and you know you have an absolute or full understanding on what came down in this generation that's so that you can have confidence in the words that are spoken and and at the end of the day what is the doctrine leading you to what is the what is the the difference that it's making in your your life somebody say well brother Israel this is what's going to happen first before the Thunders burst open there's going to be this great move take place and then the brothers are going to come forth and then brother brandom will come forth and maybe not and then this is going to happen and at the end of the day what difference does it make if you ain't believing the word and getting these things in you it don't really make a difference the order of the Resurrection it's just a arguing point and there's not going to be a section I don't think a section in heaven to say you know this brother had it right all along and all of y'all was wrong or he saw it first and this it's no place for that this you know the doctrine is to protect the lifeline yes protect what you believe that's what this word is for it's to protect the lifeline and it's been prophesied that they will not endure sound Doctrine I believe all those lovely things in the word and um and I try to preach them as much as I can as the Lord leads us but at the end of the day my message or my Ministry or my little thing I'm typically basically summing it up I'm trying to preach to get everybody to believe that this message is true that's what I'm pointing people to at the end it up sum it up put it on my gravestone wherever you call it that's what my Ministry is to say that this message is the truth here's what he said said have confidence in it it's not part of it ain't right and some of you got to correct brother brandom over here no no no that's not this ministry here so God bless you time will come they'll not endure sound doctor there was a portion of the tape there maybe we'll get it to you next time it's in the message present truth um present state of my Ministry and brother brandham is explaining that Dr how many minutes is that did we have that ready I'm curious how many minutes was it I'm sorry paron 20 paragraphs okay we we'll pick it up next time but it's he explains that whole vision and I read part of it already those two he said he took a a bite out of this fruit I think it was a peach in the other was a plum they were both sweet and very good there were two different groups but he didn't cross them up that was his ministry to the Pentecostal two factions of the Pentecostal church but that they would not endure sound Doctrine and that he saw it with his own eyes and that's what we're seeing today so God richly bless you trust the Lord will be with you as we thank the Lord so if the musicians will come oh my we have some prayer requests I think I maybe left them on my desk in there see we get that for brother GE I
