[40:43] that out that way and the team in the
[40:46] back the ministry in the back oh my God

[41:00] cream or something and we certainly
[41:02] appreciate them amen so in this message
[41:06] um the
[41:07] Masterpiece now in 1964 brother brandom
[41:11] is receives this Vision he was in
[41:14] Jeffersonville if I remember outside of
[41:16] a mall and he goes into this uh trance
[41:21] and he begins to see
[41:24] um um the Lord begin to show him this
[41:27] I took the history of it one time before
[41:30] and I don't have all those details with
[41:31] you before but here in this message in
[41:35] paragraph
[41:37] 184 he says here he says standing out
[41:41] there I guess sister da and them after I
[41:43] shook hands with Bill standing there and
[41:45] all went around the corner a whole bunch
[41:48] of people a minister pressed his way in
[41:51] caller turned around he said why is it
[41:55] that you're always balling the people
[41:57] out he said then people believe you to
[42:00] be a servant of God and be gentle and
[42:03] sweet to them and everything and said
[42:05] every time I hear you get up you're
[42:07] balling women out about having short
[42:10] hair about wearing shorts and wearing
[42:12] makeup and all this other stuff and
[42:15] balling the people out and tell them how
[42:18] cold and formal and indifferent they are
[42:22] so why do you do that said them people
[42:25] love you how can you you being a loving
[42:28] Son of God do a thing like that I
[42:32] thought Lord let me answer this smart
[42:34] man see you just let me answer him
[42:37] somewhere that'll hang him on his own
[42:40] rope I said well I said sir did you ever
[42:43] read the great producer of music called
[42:45] the great composer called be toin he
[42:48] said oh sure I read a bet toen I said he
[42:52] probably tore up waste baskets fulls of
[42:55] scrap paper but give the world
[42:59] masterpieces he never opened his mouth
[43:02] and said another word I said when he was
[43:04] sitting in his study under the
[43:06] inspiration he would write something
[43:08] down he'd go into his study and pray it
[43:12] wasn't right he scrap it up and throw it
[43:14] in the waste basket but when he got
[43:16] through in all inspiration the world had
[43:20] a
[43:22] masterpiece and then brother random goes
[43:24] into to this vision of uh uh this
[43:28] masterpiece and then I'll just highlight
[43:29] one part I normally don't highlight uh
[43:33] message that we're going to listen to I
[43:35] like you to do that on your own and so
[43:38] but um for this Vision I'll do that in
[43:42] paragraph
[43:44] 190 so here he is a scene a vision or a
[43:49] preview as we read for you this morning
[43:52] what a preview is it's a look into the
[43:54] future it's a a glance to a description
[43:59] of something that will happen to the
[44:01] Future brother brandham says this here
[44:03] now I'm an American but this made me
[44:06] sick I'm not eloquent enough to in a
[44:09] mixed audience to say what was taking
[44:11] place and you'll have to read between
[44:13] the lines but when them women were
[44:15] coming the leader of
[44:18] them was a
[44:22] witch she had a great long nose and a
[44:24] great big mouth and all of them was
[44:26] dressed
[44:27] with some kind of lower clothes down
[44:29] here but the top just had a strap that
[44:33] just a little about half inch strap that
[44:35] moved up and went around them like this
[44:38] and each woman had something on an order
[44:41] many of you years ago used to remember
[44:44] when we used to cut that paper you know
[44:46] newspaper make an old fly bush how many
[44:49] remembers it you know I think they use
[44:51] it in
[44:52] [Music]
[44:53] carnivals and hanging down like that
[44:55] French paper lace paper paper they had
[44:58] something holding below them like this
[45:00] holding below them all this part was
[45:03] exposed and each one had hair cut up
[45:06] real short and Frizzy looking things all
[45:10] over it like that real short cut hair
[45:14] and full of makeup absolutely nothing
[45:17] but look like street
[45:20] prostitutes and they were walking with
[45:22] this paper in the
[45:23] vulgarity now the paper was what was
[45:26] holding in front of them but when they
[45:29] pass the review stand in the back of
[45:32] them and to see the way they were going
[45:34] on and their foremost and their back
[45:35] part and how they were acting I said is
[45:38] that the
[45:40] church and there she went and they were
[45:42] singing These here twist and roll songs
[45:46] you know orever what you call going down
[45:49] singing that and going by I said is that
[45:53] the church and I was standing there and
[45:56] then my heart I was crying and this
[45:59] witch to my
[46:00] notion there nothing else in the world
[46:02] she's that World Council of churches
[46:05] leading them right straight down the
[46:07] road where she was going they went off
[46:09] to the left and disappeared in chaos
[46:12] still beating this music and making real
[46:15] funny sounds and shaking their bodies
[46:18] one side and then the other side and
[46:20] then like that carrying on like that
[46:25] walking and so I wanted to read read
[46:27] that part because this is what the uh
[46:29] so-called Church of the last days this
[46:32] is what they were doing he talked about
[46:34] their hair being cut he talked about
[46:37] them being full of makeup and he talked
[46:39] about the rock and roll music uh in the
[46:42] church and so let that be a warning to
[46:45] all of us if you are a church these
[46:48] Tendencies would want to influence you
[46:51] if you are a sister these are the
[46:53] tendencies that would want to influence
[46:54] you makeup cutting your hair and then
[46:58] this ungodly Unholy music now this is a
[47:03] vision that the prophet saw and uh it's
[47:07] a warning to us and so I'm going to let
[47:10] him tell the vision I got one more part
[47:12] I want to read for you here and that was
[47:15] in paragraph number
[47:17] 95 then I have to watch her she'll get
[47:20] out of step with that word if I don't
[47:21] watch she was passing by she gets by
[47:25] maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see
[47:28] when I'm finished or whatever it is what
[47:32] they was getting back trying their best
[47:34] and was getting back just get in line
[47:38] cuz they was looking out somewhere else
[47:41] watching about that church that just
[47:44] went out into chaos but the the front
[47:48] ones never the back ones just two or
[47:52] three of them was kind of stepped out of
[47:55] out a little bit to the right hand side
[47:58] and looked like was trying to get back
[48:01] in line as they went by they was just
[48:04] pass me oh as far as here to the wall
[48:07] past me and standing there then I just
[48:10] seen it all move out and leave so here
[48:12] brother bam is talking about that first
[48:14] one no never he says it was the ones in
[48:17] the back in this Vision the last day
[48:21] ones that he had to watch and so I
[48:24] encourage the church to maybe hear that
[48:26] message um um of course these messages
[48:30] have it contained but the um the message
[48:33] marriage and divorce so one of the
[48:35] sisters asked for a book um after the
[48:39] service and I I was looking for a book
[48:41] so I called Arie Peterson he's so
[48:43] faithful and he said uh and I've done
[48:46] this many times can you give me a copy
[48:48] of this whatever message and he'll grab
[48:50] it off of their shelf and give it to me
[48:53] and he said if we ever get rid of our
[48:55] library would you want I said oh yes
[48:57] give it all to
[48:58] me so I still like a book you know and
[49:01] the sister asked for that book cuz you
[49:04] you know there's no popups or you know
[49:08] ads advertisements when you're reading
[49:10] the book you might get that on your
[49:11] phone but not when you're reading the
[49:12] book so I have two or three extra ones
[49:15] for those of you that want that message
[49:18] marriage and divorce in the book format
[49:20] but I like to play this I have the
[49:22] Saints back there play this portion of
[49:25] the this is the vision it's just a few
[49:28] moments here in the message Masterpiece

[52:31] I did there was somebody with me I
[52:34] didn't see the person it was just the
[52:36] voice and I I looked and as I I looked
[52:41] this way he said the bride will come in
[52:44] view for a
[52:46] preview and I looked coming to me and I
[52:51] seen the
[52:53] most the most prettiest bunch of clean

[53:32] about it I just have to tell you but
[53:35] when this bride she was looking right at
[53:38] uh the one was talking to me and I
[53:39] standing together her eyes she was a
[53:42] cleanest sweetest looking people I ever
[53:44] seen in my life look like it could have
[53:46] been a dozen or more just I don't know
[53:47] how many was a breast but there just a
[53:49] group of and she passed by sweetly with

[54:07] they come up each one look like got
[54:10] worse I never seen such a filthy bunch
[54:13] in my life and when he said next I heard
[54:16] a noise and said next said Here Comes
[54:19] the American
[54:21] group now I am an
[54:23] American but this this made me sick I am
[54:28] not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed
[54:32] audience to say what was taking place uh
[54:36] uh uh and you'll have to read between
[54:38] the
[54:39] lines but when the women were coming the
[54:42] leader of them was a
[54:44] witch she had a great long nose and a
[54:47] great big mouth and all of them was
[54:49] dressed with some kind of low clothes
[54:51] down here but the top just had a strap
[54:54] that just a little about a/ inch strap
[54:56] that moved up and went around them like
[54:58] this and each woman had something on the
[55:01] order many of you years ago used to
[55:03] remember when we used to cut that paper
[55:06] you know newspaper and make an old fly
[55:07] bush how many remembers you know well I
[55:09] think you use in carnivals you know
[55:11] hanging down like a fringe paper lace
[55:13] paper they had something holding below
[55:15] them like this holding below them all
[55:19] this part was exposed and each one had
[55:22] hair cut up real short and Fry looking
[55:25] things all over it like that real
[55:26] shortcut hair and full of
[55:29] makeup absolutely nothing but look like
[55:32] street
[55:33] prostitutes and they were walking with
[55:35] this paper and the
[55:38] vulgarity now the paper was what was
[55:40] holding in front of them but when they
[55:43] passed the review stand in the back of
[55:45] them and to see the way they were going
[55:49] on in their foremost in their back part
[55:53] and how they were acting I said is that
[55:55] the church
[55:57] church and there she went and they were
[56:00] singing this year twisting Roll songs
[56:02] you know what you call going down saying
[56:04] going by I said is that the
[56:07] church and I was standing there and in
[56:10] my heart I was crying and this
[56:13] witch to my notion it's nothing else in
[56:17] the world but she's the she's that World
[56:19] Council of church is leading him right
[56:21] straight down the road where she was
[56:24] going they went off to the land
[56:27] and disappeared in
[56:30] chaos still beating this music and
[56:33] making real funny sounds and shaking
[56:36] their bodies one side and then the other
[56:38] side and then like that like that
[56:41] walking and I just started to bow my
[56:43] head and he said wait the bride must
[56:46] come
[56:47] again and I look and here they come
[56:49] again and they pass by sweet looking
[56:52] little ladies that's all looking right
[56:54] at me say pass by I noed each one was
[56:57] dressed different and one in the back
[56:59] had kind of long hair hanging down and
[57:01] had it rolled around like this might
[57:03] have been German or something like
[57:05] that and I watch him and then as he
[57:07] started leaving two or three of them in
[57:10] the back car get out of step and I was
[57:11] going to holler at him and they trying
[57:13] to get back and step again and I seen
[57:15] him just the vision just fade out and
[57:17] change from me now here is the
[57:21] interpretation
[57:24] thereof the reason I remember I had just
[57:27] got through writing I hadn't finished I
[57:30] hadn't wrote these notes yet but in
[57:33] preaching this morning I caught what it
[57:35] was right in my
[57:37] sermon did you notice the church only
[57:40] came in view now that's the truth
[57:42] friends the heavenly father who writes
[57:44] the word knows that I tell the
[57:48] truth I don't I just say the truth and
[57:51] not knowing it till just a few minutes
[57:53] ago looked like or just recently see did
[57:56] you notice the Bride come in view
[58:00] twice the first seed the second seed
[58:04] both of them exactly the same one and
[58:06] the reason they were dri dressed in
[58:08] different parts she'll come from All
[58:11] Nations it'll make up the
[58:13] bride each one had long hair and no
[58:16] makeup and real pretty girls and they
[58:18] were watching me that represented the
[58:20] bride coming out of all Nations see each
[58:23] one represented a nation as they March
[58:25] perfectly in line with the word see then
[58:28] I have to watch her she'll get out of
[58:30] Step of that word if I don't watch when
[58:31] she's passing by if she gets by maybe
[58:34] it'll be my time when I'm over see when
[58:36] I'm finished or whatever it is what they
[58:38] was getting back trying their best
[58:40] getting back this getting line is
[58:42] looking out somewhere else watching
[58:44] about that church and just went out of
[58:45] into chaos but two the front ones never
[58:49] the back ones just two or three of them
[58:51] was kind of stepped out a little bit to
[58:53] the right hand side and looked like was
[58:54] trying to get back in line as went by as
[58:57] this passed me all Forest here at the
[58:58] wall passed me I was standing there and
[59:00] then I just see all move out and leave
[59:02] but you notice the church only came into
[59:06] to view once each Nation the church but
[59:09] the Bride come in twice see see what it
[59:12] was now not knowing it but look at it
[59:14] with my message this morning not knowing
[59:16] that see the seed fell in the
[59:19] ground at NAA that was the original seed
[59:24] and she's come through the process of
[59:26] denominations which only comes in
[59:28] existence once but the bride returns
[59:30] back again in the last days I will
[59:33] restore see the Masterpiece is brought
[59:36] up that's reason she was in view
[59:38] reviewed the second time she was
[59:40] reviewed the first time and she was
[59:42] reviewed the second time and she's
[59:43] perfectly the second time like she was
[59:45] the first
[59:47] time oh
[59:49] God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life
[59:53] get in the green right quick
[59:59] MH all others never appeared no more
[1:00:01] they went out never to come back again
[1:00:03] but the bride came back because she was
[1:00:06] Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture
[1:00:10] has made him a
[1:00:13] masterpiece for it is a piece of his
[1:00:17] first masterpiece like he made in the
[1:00:18] Garden of Eden took a piece from and
[1:00:21] made another piece and that was marred
[1:00:23] and fell now he's been all this time
[1:00:25] building up again and he brought forth
[1:00:28] this masterpiece and was
[1:00:30] smitten and ordered that part that was
[1:00:33] smitten was in order to bring back again
[1:00:36] that Masterpiece again so the
[1:00:38] Masterpiece in the Son of God the
[1:00:40] Masterpiece in the bride and it's a
[1:00:42] piece of him which must be the
[1:00:44] fulfilling of the word the word has been
[1:00:48] fulfilled and we're ready for the coming
[1:00:50] of the Lord oh Church of the Living

[1:01:01] true I know that it sounds like it it's
[1:01:04] such a greater thing as that would be
[1:01:05] would be so spread out over the Nations

[1:01:25] resurrection but the stalk must be
[1:01:27] burned the rest of it the husk and all
[1:01:30] must be destroyed and it will be don't

[1:02:31] we'll take a little time and so um what
[1:02:35] we'll do is um we won't hold you back
[1:02:39] but there is a message on
[1:02:42] communion that
[1:02:45] um well maybe we'll just read the
[1:02:48] scripture on communion and go to the
[1:02:50] table of the Lord all right so let's um
[1:02:54] let's do that let's take our
[1:02:58] scriptures and
[1:03:00] uh of course there's I can play the tape
[1:03:03] I can play several tapes I can play but
[1:03:06] let's take what we just heard and let
[1:03:08] that settle in our hearts and receive
[1:03:10] that tonight amen I just feel to do that
[1:03:14] God bless you
[1:03:15] richly
[1:03:17] Amen in 1 Corinthians 11 if You' stand
[1:03:20] with me
[1:03:26] actually
[1:03:41] there's verse
[1:03:45] 23 let's go up a little bit further we
[1:03:48] normally start at verse 23
[1:03:50] we'll take verse 17 now in this that I
[1:03:54] declare unto you you I praise you not
[1:03:57] that you come together not for the
[1:03:59] better but for the worse for first of
[1:04:02] all when you come together in the church
[1:04:04] I hear that there be divisions among you
[1:04:07] and I partly believe
[1:04:09] it for there must be also heres among
[1:04:12] you that they which are approved may be
[1:04:15] made manifest among you when you come
[1:04:19] together therefore into one place this
[1:04:22] is not to eat the Lord's Supper for in
[1:04:24] eating everyone one took it before other
[1:04:27] his own supper one is hungry the other
[1:04:30] one is
[1:04:31] drunken what have you not houses to eat
[1:04:34] and drink in or despise ye the Church of
[1:04:37] God and shame them that have not what
[1:04:41] shall I say to you shall I Praise You In
[1:04:43] This I praise you not for I've received
[1:04:47] of the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:04:49] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:04:51] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:04:53] bread when he had given thanks he break
[1:04:56] it and said take eat this is my body
[1:05:00] which is broken for you this do in
[1:05:03] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:05:06] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:05:08] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:05:11] my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:05:14] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:05:18] often as you drink this for often as you
[1:05:20] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:05:23] show the Lord's death till he comes
[1:05:26] wherefore whosoever should eat this
[1:05:29] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:05:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:05:34] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:05:36] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:05:39] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:05:42] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:05:44] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:05:47] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:05:50] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:05:53] and many sleep for if we we would judge
[1:05:56] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:05:59] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:06:02] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:06:05] with the
[1:06:06] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:06:08] come together to eat Terry one for
[1:06:11] another If any man hunger let him eat at
[1:06:14] home that you come not together unto
[1:06:17] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:06:19] order when I come so we'll have silent
[1:06:23] prayer please pray for me
[1:06:26] I pray for you I'll pray for you and
[1:06:29] let's pray for one another just in
[1:06:31] silent prayer before we take these
[1:06:33] elements
