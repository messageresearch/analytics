[25:24] to remember
[25:26] the morning petitions of uh, sister Lori
[25:29] is having that procedure done that God
[25:31] would give her peace in her heart and
[25:34] knowing that everything's going to be
[25:35] okay. He's brought her this far. So,
[25:38] let's pray for her. Also, I want to pray
[25:41] for
[25:42] a brother that called me this morning
[25:44] and and I I know he's going through some
[25:48] deep issues. His name is David Ramanet.
[25:52] Let's pray that God would do something
[25:54] supernatural for him to
[25:57] Let's go. Let's go to prayer.
[26:00] Lord Jesus, thank you Lord for allowing
[26:03] us to be here. Lord God, I pray for your
[26:06] people, Lord. I pray for sister sisters
[26:09] are having the procedure, Lord, that you
[26:12] be with her. Give her peace in her heart
[26:14] that everything's going to be all right,
[26:16] Lord. I pray for this brother David
[26:19] Ramanette, Lord God.
[26:21] I pray that you would do something for
[26:23] him. Supernatural, Lord. Something that
[26:26] will completely turn him around, Lord
[26:29] God. I know you did it for me, so I know
[26:32] you could do it for him, Lord God.
[26:35] Pray, Lord. Thank you, Lord. I love you,

[26:41] message that you brought was
[26:44] Lord, we I don't want to miss your
[26:46] visitation, Lord God.
[26:49] It reminds me of the prophet saying that
[26:51] we're always praising God for what he
[26:53] did in the past, always praising him for
[26:56] the future, but we're ignoring what he's
[26:59] doing right now. In other words, we're
[27:02] missing his visitation.
[27:05] Oh Lord, I don't want to miss your
[27:07] visitation.
[27:09] Please help us, Lord God. I pray that
[27:13] I love you with all my heart. Oh God,
[27:16] I can't even hardly believe that you
[27:18] would call somebody like me, Lord God.
[27:21] I'm so thankful, Lord God. I don't have
[27:24] the vocabulary, Lord, to to give you the
[27:28] honor and glory to thank you, Lord. I
[27:30] just love you with all my heart. What an
[27:33] exciting time we're living in, Lord God.
[27:36] Very exciting to me, Lord. I just love
[27:38] you. I want to worship you. I give give
[27:40] you honor and glory, Lord.

[27:46] me to be born in this day. Lord, thank
[27:48] you Lord. I pray that you would bless
[27:51] the minister tonight. Just bringing the
[27:53] word Lord with you anoint them Lord God.
[27:57] Bring that the Holy Spirit Lord and we
[28:00] help us not to miss your visitation
[28:03] tonight Lord God. We don't want to miss
[28:06] your visitation Lord. Oh God, we know
[28:09] you come every service, Lord, and we
[28:11] don't want to miss it, Lord. Help us to
[28:14] have a an open heart, Lord, cuz you said
[28:17] a broken, a contrite spirit, I'll never
[28:20] reject. That's a prescription for your
[28:23] to approach to you. So help us, oh God.
[28:27] You don't want an arrogant spirit, a
[28:29] prideful spirit. You'll never you'll
[28:31] never come to something like that. A
[28:33] broken and a contrite spirit you'll
[28:35] never reject. Thank you, Father. We love
[28:38] you. We appreciate you, Lord. Commit
[28:40] this service into your hands for your
[28:43] honor and for your glory. In the name of
[28:45] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

[33:42] across
[33:44] that river
[33:50] to where my faith
[33:58] will end
[34:01] inside.

[34:14] four days
[34:16] to labor and then we're going to go

[37:09] There is a land
[37:18] and it's not
[37:21] a million
[37:23] miles away

[38:54] million miles away, Brother John.

[39:02] miles away.
[39:07] Or on some far off
[39:10] distant
[39:12] strain.
[39:15] I'll speed up and they'll slow down
[39:22] the very
[39:25] land.
[39:28] God bless you.
[39:37] Standard,
[39:46] gentle
[39:48] shepher,
[39:53] come and
[39:57] us
[40:00] Lord, we need
[40:03] you to help us find our way.
[40:13] Gentle

[40:24] us.
[40:27] for we need
[40:31] your strength from day to today.
[40:37] Oh, there's no other
[40:40] and there's no other
[40:46] that we can turn
[40:50] to.
[40:54] Who can help us
[40:58] face another
[41:02] day?
[41:07] Gentle
[41:08] shepher
[41:13] come and lead
[41:16] us
[41:20] for we need
[41:23] you to help us find our way. There's no
[41:29] other there's no other.
[41:33] There's no other
[41:39] we can turn
[41:43] to.
[41:46] Who can help
[41:49] us
[41:51] face
[41:52] another
[41:54] day?
[41:59] angel sh
[42:12] for we need
[42:15] you to help us.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[42:23] We welcome you to the house of the Lord
[42:25] tonight. And so glad to have the gentle
[42:28] shepherd
[42:30] leading us. Amen.
[42:32] And uh he'll always lead us to the right
[42:34] place. Amen.
[42:37] And uh he'll lead us in his word. We
[42:40] have a good friend of ours, brother
[42:43] uh William Lingar, Brother Bill we call
[42:46] him, and he's a friend of mine for many
[42:48] years. and he's here in the Phoenix area
[42:53] and so he has made his way to be with us
[42:56] tonight and so we look forward to what
[42:58] the Lord has for us.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Um just to go uh to encourage your
[43:06] hearts in prayer as I mentioned this
[43:09] morning the vision that I would like to
[43:11] see moving forward with the church to to
[43:13] keep those to you to keep those in
[43:16] prayer. We greet the saints in Mesa and
[43:19] we talked about the Sunday school, the
[43:21] music ministry, the recording ministry,
[43:25] that's all the sound video stream, all
[43:27] of those things, the missionary uh
[43:30] ministry, and the Spanish language, the
[43:33] Spanish people, and just that what that
[43:36] entails. And so, um, for the Sunday
[43:39] school, as we've done it before, we
[43:42] always play the tape of the prophet and
[43:46] typically a series and that's we call
[43:49] that our adult Sunday school and we like
[43:52] to focus on what the prophet is teaching
[43:56] us during that time and internalize that
[43:59] 15 or 20 minute segment so it can be a
[44:02] blessing to you
[44:03] &gt;&gt; and so at the end of those series we
[44:06] will come and teach uh that Sunday
[44:09] school lesson to bring those things
[44:10] together and so we'd like you to if you
[44:15] have questions during that time you get
[44:17] those notes, put those together and um
[44:21] bring those questions and so we can try
[44:23] to help the body of Christ with that.
[44:25] Amen.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; The music ministry um all the musicians,
[44:29] song leaders, worship leaders, it is a
[44:32] ministry as serious as any other
[44:35] ministry that God would have. So me
[44:38] preaching or uh the brothers song
[44:41] leading um they're equal in the
[44:46] importance and the part that they have
[44:48] to play into a service. And so we want
[44:50] you to be in prayer. Look forward to
[44:52] that and the recording uh ministry, the
[44:55] streams, the videos and all of that. And
[44:59] our saints should be praying for those
[45:00] that are doing that. It's a sacrifice to
[45:03] work back there. I know it is because
[45:06] they can't really just relax and just go
[45:10] on screen saver mode. They have to be
[45:13] alert at all times watching the sound
[45:15] and what's going on, the lighting,
[45:17] whatever. And so it takes prayer. It
[45:20] takes the Holy Spirit. And since that is
[45:22] a part of our churches today, it's part
[45:25] of the ministry to help us serve the
[45:27] people of God better.
[45:29] Amen. They're not back there twiddling
[45:31] their thumbs. So they're back there in
[45:34] prayer, not passing notes, not on their
[45:36] phones, not streaming, just it's a
[45:38] ministry. Amen.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Just like any other ministry, we want to
[45:42] move and look into that. The missionary
[45:45] uh ministry, witnessing to the lost and
[45:51] tracks, creating, making those tracks,
[45:53] going some kind of way outside of the
[45:56] walls of the church to be a witness. And
[45:59] that includes the little ministry we
[46:00] have in the Mesa area with Phoenix and
[46:03] the brothers there that do their work
[46:05] there. And I want to read this quotation
[46:07] for you. In 1956,
[46:11] 42256, paragraph number 20,
[46:15] the prophet of God says this, and I know
[46:19] you're right there. Every missionary is
[46:23] always right. Go into all the world and
[46:26] preach the gospel to every creature.
[46:28] That's general orders. So you're always
[46:32] right.
[46:34] And then the prophet says here in the
[46:36] word became flesh in the India trip
[46:38] report 1954
[46:41] paragraph 20. And a minister gets in the
[46:45] same way when you're especially an
[46:48] apostle or well an apostle is a
[46:51] missionary. The word mission, aposto
[46:55] means one cent. And why the missionary
[46:57] wants to be called
[47:00] a missionary instead of an aposto
[47:04] order of it is is apostle. So then he
[47:08] sent out he's not exact he he's not
[47:12] exactly has to be a minister. Apostle
[47:16] don't have to be a minister. He just has
[47:19] to be one that sent. God sent him to do
[47:23] certain things.
[47:25] How we can say praise the Lord for that.
[47:27] Amen.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; The message here ye him he says this in
[47:31] 1956 and this is kind of just talking
[47:34] about the mi the music ministry the
[47:37] recording ministry the sound and and so
[47:40] forth. And um lastly
[47:45] we were talking about the Spanish going
[47:47] to the Spanish or that language here.
[47:50] Yehem 1956 he says this paragraph 16 now
[47:54] in this state many times Jesus never
[47:57] gathers with people just to be gathering
[48:00] Christ never did anything loosely and I
[48:04] think that's the trouble with the church
[48:05] today who take too many of the things of
[48:09] God loosely and I perceive that this is
[48:12] a Pentecostal gathering and listen
[48:14] you're my brothers and sisters but the
[48:17] Pentecostal people are too loosely with
[48:20] the gifts that's in the church and
[48:23] that's the reason God can't respect
[48:25] them. So you just let them go any old
[48:28] way. They should be governed and put in
[48:32] order.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; And that's our attitude. We want that's
[48:35] the spirit of God, the Holy Spirit in
[48:38] our hearts is to whatever we do, we do
[48:41] the best that we can as unto the Lord.
[48:44] Amen. So God bless you. Pray for those I
[48:46] didn't know there were five things. I
[48:48] counted them out. It just turned out to
[48:49] be five things. And if it was four
[48:53] things, I probably would have made it
[48:54] five or seven or something like that.
[48:58] But Sunday school, music ministry,
[49:01] recording ministry, missionary ministry,
[49:04] the Spanish language, and with the
[49:06] Sunday school, it's the adult Sunday
[49:08] school, but there's the smaller classes
[49:10] too for teaching and teachers and some
[49:14] of the young men and brothers.
[49:18] Um well, we want you to pray about those
[49:21] gifts that God maybe would have in your
[49:23] life in any of these areas. All right.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; God bless you. So, as we uh stand to our
[49:30] feet and invite brother uh Bill to come,
[49:33] we'll sing the song Amazing Grace.
[49:42] Oh, how sweet
[49:48] that
[49:54] like me.
[49:59] I
[50:02] was lost,
[50:04] but now
[50:08] I'm found.
[50:11] smile.
[50:17] See,
[50:21] was his grace
[50:24] that taught
[50:27] my heart
[50:29] to fear
[50:32] and grace.
[50:35] My fears
[50:38] relieve.
[50:43] How gracious
[50:47] did
[50:49] that grace
[50:52] appear
[50:55] the hour
[50:57] I first
[51:00] believe.
[51:05] Praise God. Can you say praise God?
[51:09] Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[51:14] Praise God.
[51:16] Praise God.
[51:19] Praise God.
[51:22] Praise God.
[51:27] Well, praise God. Thank you, Lord.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Praise God.
[51:36] Praise God.
[51:39] Praise God.
[51:41] Praise God.
[51:44] Praise God.
[51:49] Praise God for saving us.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God for filling us with the Holy
[51:55] Spirit. Praise God for healing our
[51:58] prayers for the sick. Praise God for
[52:01] healing our prayers for our loved ones.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Whatever this situation is, he promised
[52:06] he would be a present help
[52:09] &gt;&gt; in the time of need.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And we praise him for all of these
[52:12] things.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And we're so grateful that he found us
[52:17] &gt;&gt; and brought us back to the fold. So, I'm
[52:20] thankful to be here tonight. It's always
[52:23] a privilege to be with brother Israel,
[52:25] my friend, and to see what God has done
[52:29] in his life.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh a changed life is a miracle,
[52:36] isn't it?
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's that's a that's a true a true
[52:40] miracle. And so we pray tonight we'll
[52:43] say something that will encourage you
[52:46] and help uh your pastor in the work that
[52:50] he's doing to feed the flock and help
[52:52] you move forward in Jesus Christ.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; So 1st Samuel 16 chapter 13 or verse 13
[52:59] and 14. I want to start there and then
[53:02] I'm going to leave it and we'll come
[53:03] back to it
[53:08] and
[53:11] 1st Samuel 16 verse 13 and 14. And I got
[53:16] my timer on. All right.
[53:19] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[53:23] anointed him. That was David in the
[53:26] midst of his brethren,
[53:28] and the spirit of the Lord came upon
[53:31] David
[53:32] &gt;&gt; from that day forward.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; So Samuel rose up and went to Rama.
[53:38] But the spirit of the Lord departed from
[53:40] Saul,
[53:42] and an evil spirit from the Lord
[53:45] troubled him.
[53:48] Heavenly Father, as we come tonight and
[53:51] as our brother read about the sacredness
[53:54] of just the gifts, whatever we do,
[53:57] Heavenly Father, may we do it with all
[53:59] of our heart. May we discern the body of
[54:01] the Lord of Jesus Christ. Whether it's a
[54:04] little finger or whatever part it is,
[54:07] it's all a part of Jesus Christ's body
[54:10] to to work together that he might
[54:13] accomplish his purpose in that church.
[54:17] And so to that we dedicate this service
[54:19] tonight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[54:26] David is portraying perfectly
[54:29] Christ our shepherd.
[54:33] And how appropriate that last song was
[54:35] that our brother read sung the gentle
[54:38] shepherd. It fits exactly with my sermon
[54:41] tonight. Christ our shepherd. And we
[54:43] like we like those little things that he
[54:45] does for us, right? To let us know we've
[54:47] got the mind of the Lord and we're on
[54:50] the right path. That's right.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; And so we find here that David, he was
[54:58] the good shepherd because he put his
[55:01] life on the line for his father's sheep.
[55:06] And as the good shepherd here, Samuel
[55:10] the prophet who was the voice of God to
[55:12] that age,
[55:15] he anointed David the good shepherd
[55:19] with the horn of oil to become the chief
[55:23] shepherd, the king of Israel.
[55:28] And for David to become the chief
[55:32] shepherd, the king of Israel meant he
[55:34] was going to sit in the throne.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; He was going to wear the crown of glory.
[55:40] And so it's a type. He was going to
[55:42] exercise the supreme authority of his
[55:46] kingly position.
[55:52] And we know it's a type of this day
[55:54] where brother Brandham said we don't
[55:56] pray for it but command it.
[56:01] And so to command it that's the highest
[56:05] manifestation of God's authority and his
[56:08] power is the spoken creative word.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And we know that everything started by
[56:15] that, right? and all things were made by
[56:18] that and for him.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; And so listen to what the prophet of our
[56:25] age, God's vindicated voice said about
[56:29] David's anointing. And this is a quote
[56:32] from the great warrior David.
[56:47] Okay. Make sure I get this right. Yeah.
[56:50] All right.
[56:52] Well, I didn't put it I didn't put it
[56:54] there. So, let me go over here
[56:58] and
[57:09] It's so perfect that I don't want to
[57:14] quote it from memory. It's an
[57:16] outstanding
[57:21] quote.
[57:31] Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; It's on me
[57:48] now. I have to quote it from memory
[57:51] and then you can go to that tape. this
[57:54] great warrior David. He said David was
[57:58] anointed for his kingly position right
[58:02] then.
[58:04] David was placed as king
[58:08] right then.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And then he ti and then he quotes the
[58:13] scripture as well. All that he forneew
[58:15] he called. All that he called he's
[58:17] justified or anointed and glorified.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so very significant statement
[58:26] anointed for his kingly position right
[58:30] then.
[58:33] And uh
[58:36] yet at the same time, King Saul is
[58:39] anointed of an evil spirit
[58:42] and it was permitted by God.
[58:47] And that evil spirit which was permitted
[58:50] by God because God let it come upon it.
[58:53] The spirit of God departed him and it
[58:55] came upon Saul. It was permitted by God.
[58:58] And what was it doing? It was resisting
[59:01] David's kingly commission.
[59:06] And it was opposing
[59:08] his fulfillment of what God anointed
[59:11] for. He was going to kill him to try to
[59:14] stop the fulfillment of it.
[59:18] Oh, there it is. Huh? Thank you so much.
[59:21] There it is. He and he says, "You are
[59:24] positionally placed in Christ Jesus as
[59:27] kings and priests." Is that right? The
[59:29] moment you receive the Holy Spirit, God
[59:32] places you in the kingdom and an heir.
[59:35] What a beautiful picture. There you are.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:40] And so, but there's a riddle here.
[59:44] And the riddle is though David was
[59:47] anointed for his kingly position right
[59:50] then,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; it was 15 years before he had his
[59:54] coronation ceremony.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Very significant. It was 15 years
[1:00:04] before he had his coronation ceremony.
[1:00:08] before he actually took the throne, wore
[1:00:11] the king, and exercised the power not to
[1:00:16] pray for it, but to command it. Because
[1:00:20] the king doesn't have to ask anybody.
[1:00:23] He's the supreme authority of the
[1:00:25] supreme power in the land. And that's
[1:00:27] what his throne and his crown and his
[1:00:30] scepter and what the king's sword
[1:00:32] enforces.
[1:00:36] And so, we'll hold that riddle right
[1:00:37] there. and God help us to come back to
[1:00:39] it. Now for my for for to take my
[1:00:42] subject Psalms 23:1 which we're very
[1:00:45] familiar with.
[1:00:48] But you know when the Holy Spirit gets
[1:00:50] in the word, he brings out things that
[1:00:54] we never thought of.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So Psalms 23:1 says, "The Lord is my
[1:01:00] shepherd.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; I shall not want."
[1:01:06] And my subject tonight is Christ our
[1:01:09] shepherd,
[1:01:10] the power to become the sons of God.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; When brother Israel reminded me of his
[1:01:22] anniversary services, he kind of told
[1:01:24] me, "You should have known that." You
[1:01:26] remember he reminded me of his
[1:01:29] anniversary services and the
[1:01:31] dedicational which was coming up
[1:01:35] and then later he sent me the
[1:01:37] announcement and I saw your theme was
[1:01:39] the power to become sons of God.
[1:01:44] And so just that right there kind of
[1:01:46] inspired me to consider what that power
[1:01:50] was and how that power comes.
[1:01:56] How is it manifested to us? Because if
[1:01:59] if you're if you have the right purpose
[1:02:02] in life, your purpose in life is to be a
[1:02:05] son and daughter of God.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you may have a different
[1:02:08] position on the way to that purpose, but
[1:02:12] if you're a son and daughter of God, you
[1:02:14] have the same purpose in life.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Okay? And so, um, then Sunday morning,
[1:02:23] if you'll recall, he read some
[1:02:26] outstanding quotes
[1:02:29] on the power to become the sons of God.
[1:02:34] And I believe that one of them I'm going
[1:02:37] to read you now. It ties into our
[1:02:40] subject. And I believe it's absolutely
[1:02:42] critical for our spiritual understanding
[1:02:46] to see what and how that we are alive
[1:02:50] and remain will come to the
[1:02:53] manifestation of the sons of God in this
[1:02:56] age. We need to understand it. Okay? And
[1:03:00] that's why God has placed in the church
[1:03:03] the ministerial gifts.
[1:03:06] Watch. So that you be no more children
[1:03:09] and toss to and fro with what? Winds of
[1:03:13] doctrine.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; So we're we're here to be taught right
[1:03:17] like Timothy was of Paul, right? So that
[1:03:22] we can help you
[1:03:26] in these things.
[1:03:30] And so let me read this quote on on from
[1:03:34] adoption
[1:03:36] and this one I know I have.
[1:03:42] He says but in the fullness of time God
[1:03:45] sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb
[1:03:49] slain from the foundation of the world.
[1:03:52] His blood was shed that I might go to my
[1:03:54] inheritance
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; to be what? What inherits the sunship to
[1:04:01] be a son of God? Okay. Now, this word
[1:04:04] the sunship, it's only in this message
[1:04:07] of adoption that I find that he uses
[1:04:10] this term sunship.
[1:04:12] And so, we need to see how he
[1:04:17] explains it to us so that we can apply
[1:04:19] it the way he explained it to us.
[1:04:23] And now, this may just choke you to
[1:04:26] death.
[1:04:27] But did you know that men that are sons
[1:04:30] of God are amateur gods?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; How many ever know that? How many know
[1:04:34] that Jesus said so? The Bible said, "Did
[1:04:38] you're not did not your law say itself
[1:04:40] that you are gods?" And if you call them
[1:04:42] gods, which God said in Genesis 2 that
[1:04:45] they were gods, because they were had
[1:04:48] full domain over the dominion of the
[1:04:51] world.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now today we don't have it
[1:04:58] but this message and ministry is to take
[1:05:02] us back to that. And no matter how much
[1:05:06] time goes by and how much a promise of
[1:05:09] God lingers, those who have that promise
[1:05:13] and anointed for that promise, they're
[1:05:15] going to wait for its fulfillment.
[1:05:21] So he says here he gave him dominion
[1:05:24] over all things and he lost his godship.
[1:05:28] He lost his sunship
[1:05:32] his domain and Satan took it over. So
[1:05:35] now Satan is the prince of the power of
[1:05:37] the air, right? And he controls the
[1:05:40] earth and he brings destruction.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; So we're waiting for the fullness of
[1:05:45] time. Now that's a key word. When the
[1:05:48] pyramid gets up to the
[1:05:51] up to the top, would this be the pyramid
[1:05:56] up to the top?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And and that's another thing. You see,
[1:06:01] you have to connect what the scripture
[1:06:05] said and what the prophet is revealing
[1:06:07] with what's happening.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then the message takes on a new
[1:06:13] dimension and a new uh realm of of
[1:06:17] stimulation
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; from the message.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; It's that quickening power
[1:06:26] that brings joy to my soul, Lord, that
[1:06:29] you would let me see this.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; So, we're waiting for the fullness time
[1:06:35] when the pyramid gets up to the top.
[1:06:38] There's the key.
[1:06:40] It has to be up to the top. It couldn't
[1:06:44] be in the dark ages. It wasn't in
[1:06:47] Luther's age. It wasn't in Pentecostal's
[1:06:50] age. It wasn't in me in in the last p.
[1:06:53] But it was at the top of the pyramid,
[1:06:56] which is why brother Brandham moved to
[1:06:59] Tucson to fulfill the vision and go into
[1:07:02] the wilderness to be anointed.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:07] with the king's sword for a kingly
[1:07:12] ministry.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So
[1:07:20] there's nothing to choke about.
[1:07:23] It's just a matter to say, "Lord, thank
[1:07:26] you. Help me to understand, Lord, what
[1:07:30] you're doing in this age."
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Because how much of the water do you
[1:07:35] want? The water is the type of the
[1:07:36] spirit. Do you want it up to your ankles
[1:07:38] or would you like it to your knees or
[1:07:40] would you like it to your waist or would
[1:07:43] you like it to be just the fullness of
[1:07:45] the spirit of God?
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's the power of your redemption.
[1:07:50] Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; When the pyramid gets up to the top,
[1:08:00] when the full sons of God will be
[1:08:02] manifested, when the power of God will
[1:08:04] walk out, hallelujah, and take every
[1:08:06] power that Satan's got away from him.
[1:08:08] Yes, sir. It belongs to him. Well, you
[1:08:12] say, brother Lingard, that he was
[1:08:14] anointed there in 1963, and we still
[1:08:17] haven't come to that. I know there was a
[1:08:19] gap from the time David was anointed for
[1:08:22] his kingly position before the
[1:08:24] coronation took place.
[1:08:28] So let me just stop right there for for
[1:08:31] time. Okay. And so
[1:08:35] um
[1:08:37] though it lingered, God has vindicated
[1:08:40] it by his prophet shepherd to this age.
[1:08:45] And you might say, "Brother William,
[1:08:47] prophet shepherd to our last age." Yes.
[1:08:51] Allow me to call your attention to what
[1:08:53] he said about that.
[1:08:56] And these are these are all puzzles
[1:08:59] pieces that you put together and allows
[1:09:03] the bride of Christ to see what the
[1:09:05] foolish virgin can't see.
[1:09:09] Why? The oil,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. So we can get beyond our
[1:09:16] human understanding
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; and we can see that he's a supernatural
[1:09:20] God. There's nothing impossible for him.
[1:09:24] Once he vindicates his promise, the
[1:09:26] bride of Jesus Christ is going to
[1:09:28] contend for it, going to wait for it,
[1:09:30] and going to believe for it and going to
[1:09:33] receive it.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And so here's what he said in the church
[1:09:41] age. It is not enough that he has
[1:09:44] associated himself with the whole church
[1:09:48] which we saw when he was seen standing
[1:09:50] among the seven golden lampstands. Nor
[1:09:53] it is enough that we even see the
[1:09:55] five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4
[1:09:58] apostle, prophets, teachers, evangelist,
[1:10:00] pastors. For in each age the church goes
[1:10:03] astray. And it's not just the ley but
[1:10:07] the clergy group. Shepherds are wrong as
[1:10:10] well as sheep.
[1:10:13] Then God brings himself on the scene
[1:10:18] as the chief shepherd in the ministry of
[1:10:21] these seven men
[1:10:24] to lead his people back to the truth and
[1:10:28] the abundant power of the truth. So the
[1:10:31] Holy Spirit which has revealed the
[1:10:34] entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation,
[1:10:37] he's quickening that truth to you to
[1:10:40] turn it into power and deliverance in
[1:10:43] your life or through you for the life of
[1:10:46] others.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And and and so I I I rejoice of this
[1:10:53] because look at the last church age.
[1:10:58] ALL WE ALL LIKE SHEEP HAD GONE ASTRAY.
[1:11:01] We couldn't even get water baptism
[1:11:04] right. They had a name that they liveth
[1:11:06] but were dead.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the evidence of the
[1:11:09] Holy Ghost, right?
[1:11:11] Let alone eternal hell or the original
[1:11:15] sin. All those things that HELP ME. WHY
[1:11:18] DO I die when I first came to Christ?
[1:11:21] Why do I die? Because I'm was born
[1:11:23] hybrid. I was born sexual. I knew none
[1:11:25] of that.
[1:11:29] So that's power
[1:11:38] to lead his people back to the truth,
[1:11:39] the abundant power of that truth. God is
[1:11:41] in his people, all of his people. For
[1:11:44] any man that has not the spirit of
[1:11:46] Christ, he's none of his, and he is the
[1:11:48] word. That would be the word recognized
[1:11:51] in the people. See? So God rich in
[1:11:54] mercy, if we were all like sheep, we
[1:11:56] gone astray and we couldn't find our way
[1:12:00] back to the apostolic times, we couldn't
[1:12:03] do it. But what is man that God is
[1:12:06] mindful of him? The shepherd David said,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; "And what is the son of man that he
[1:12:12] visited him on the Jordan River?
[1:12:15] What is man? We were like sheep going
[1:12:17] astray. We were helpless. We had
[1:12:20] separated ourselves from glory. But God
[1:12:23] knew we needed a shepherd.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And that shepherd
[1:12:30] came to call his sheep. How does he call
[1:12:33] you? My sheep hear my voice.
[1:12:43] So we see that Christ, our shepherd, is
[1:12:48] manifesting
[1:12:49] that relationship with us through the
[1:12:52] seven messengers.
[1:12:55] And the church didn't know that because
[1:12:56] it's been hidden in the book of
[1:12:58] Revelations.
[1:13:00] And the book of Revelations wasn't open
[1:13:02] until the end time. It took a prophetic
[1:13:05] It's a prophetic book. It was an eagle
[1:13:08] that gave it to John. And so it takes an
[1:13:10] eagle to reveal it when it's time.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, and then every church age was
[1:13:18] the same. He that has an ear, let him
[1:13:21] hear what the spirit says to the church
[1:13:23] by way of the messenger.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; It's God's gift of grace to us.
[1:13:37] And so let's go into it now. Christ our
[1:13:39] shepherd, I shall not want. And that's
[1:13:43] what inspired me when I read that. I
[1:13:45] shall not want. And I thought, why
[1:13:47] should I not want? Because he supplies
[1:13:49] everything I need by Christ our
[1:13:52] shepherd.
[1:13:56] everything that I need to come to the
[1:13:59] sunship of Christ, to come back to an
[1:14:03] amateur God, to come back to that
[1:14:05] position, not just pray for it, but to
[1:14:08] command it. That's where Adam was in the
[1:14:11] beginning. He had supreme control of the
[1:14:14] earth.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And so, how can you have supreme control
[1:14:18] of the earth until God gets supreme
[1:14:20] control of you?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. There's the power.
[1:14:26] Okay.
[1:14:28] And so
[1:14:31] an amateur god and that's typed by David
[1:14:35] anointed for his kingly position. The
[1:14:37] supreme authority to command it. A king
[1:14:41] doesn't have to have. We have presidents
[1:14:42] here. But you go into Europe and where
[1:14:44] you had all of those dynasties and
[1:14:46] monarchs after monarchs. It's all about
[1:14:49] the throne and the king. And you'll see
[1:14:52] the king on his horse and with the
[1:14:53] sword. Why? Because the sword, he
[1:14:56] basically uh enforced the law of his
[1:14:59] kingdom.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:03] And so it's more real there.
[1:15:07] So Christ my shepherd, who is he?
[1:15:12] The Bible said God is my shepherd. God
[1:15:16] is an immortal spirit. God had no
[1:15:19] beginning. God had no end.
[1:15:22] God didn't have to die, but he had a
[1:15:25] plan. He had a purpose. So Christ, our
[1:15:29] shepherd, is the pillar of fire.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; He's the pillar of fire. And that's what
[1:15:39] the Bible said. When Saul of Tarsus was
[1:15:42] struck down by the pillar of fire, he
[1:15:45] knew that light was Elohim. But he
[1:15:48] didn't know that Elohim had visited the
[1:15:52] son of man on the river because we
[1:15:55] needed a shepherd
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; and he was made flesh
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; as the son of man. What for? To lay down
[1:16:07] his life for the sheep to manifest the
[1:16:11] pillar of fire as Christ our shepherd.
[1:16:15] It had to become flesh.
[1:16:20] So listen,
[1:16:23] I was thinking this.
[1:16:25] Saul knew his Bible
[1:16:28] better than almost anybody in that age.
[1:16:33] Is that correct? He knew it. He knew
[1:16:36] what Moses taught. He knew it inside and
[1:16:39] out.
[1:16:40] But he didn't know the author.
[1:16:44] He didn't know the author
[1:16:47] because when that pillar of fire became
[1:16:49] flesh, the one who wrote the Bible by
[1:16:51] the prophet and gave him all the types
[1:16:54] and shadows of Moses the prophet
[1:16:56] shepherd in that they still Paul didn't
[1:16:58] know him. So you can know your Bible
[1:17:01] perfectly. Here's the Bible.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; But without the pillar of fire on the
[1:17:11] scene,
[1:17:14] to quicken it to you
[1:17:18] and to reveal it to you like he did to
[1:17:21] Saul. Then he said, "Who are you? I am
[1:17:25] Christ.
[1:17:27] I'm Jesus."
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Brandham tells us over
[1:17:37] and over
[1:17:39] their mistake. They could not take the
[1:17:41] scriptures that they were preaching and
[1:17:44] believing and match them to the
[1:17:46] experience that Jesus Christ was giving
[1:17:48] them. Why? Because it's repeating again.
[1:17:52] All of these things like sunset mountain
[1:17:55] and and the picture of the pillar of
[1:17:57] fire and the picture of the seven licks
[1:17:59] of fire. All of these things are
[1:18:02] scripturally based and God has given
[1:18:05] them to you
[1:18:07] not only as a vindication but to raise
[1:18:10] your faith in his shepherd's voice.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; And so then I was thinking, you know,
[1:18:18] back in if I was living in the days of
[1:18:20] Israel, you know, they they read all the
[1:18:22] time a pillar of fire by night, a cloud
[1:18:24] by day, but not all of them saw the
[1:18:26] pillar of fire. Not all of them saw the
[1:18:29] cloud by day. most did not.
[1:18:32] And then in the New Testament, Paul saw
[1:18:34] it as a light. And so
[1:18:39] I'm a let's say I'm I'm a sinner. I
[1:18:41] haven't accepted Christ yet. I'm
[1:18:43] believing I'm believing God is real. But
[1:18:47] there's always that question a little
[1:18:49] bit. Is God really real?
[1:18:52] But here in this age, he scientifically
[1:18:55] came down and had his picture taken so
[1:18:59] that you can see the pillar of fire
[1:19:02] vindicating his prophet shepherd to this
[1:19:05] age.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; To lead you and guide you into all
[1:19:10] truth.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the water baptism
[1:19:15] straight.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; They couldn't get the evidence of the
[1:19:18] Holy Ghost straight. They couldn't get
[1:19:20] the gifts of the spirit straight.
[1:19:24] But God rich in mercy came down through
[1:19:27] his prophet shepherd and with the voice
[1:19:30] of thus saith the Lord
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; vindicated.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; There's no wonder no more. We've
[1:19:37] returned to the bishop and the the
[1:19:41] shepherd of our soul, the Holy Ghost
[1:19:43] that has revealed these things to us and
[1:19:46] it's turning into power in our age
[1:19:49] because it's making us what he wants us
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; to be.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:56] So Moses,
[1:20:00] you know,
[1:20:03] Moses
[1:20:05] said, "The Lord your God will raise up a
[1:20:07] prophet like into me." And they claimed
[1:20:10] to believe Moses. They claimed to
[1:20:12] believe their Bible.
[1:20:17] But yet when he came as son of man, they
[1:20:21] denied him.
[1:20:24] They denied him.
[1:20:26] And when he raised from the dead, he
[1:20:28] rebuked them for not believing all the
[1:20:32] prophets said. And he preached the
[1:20:34] prophets because they were testifying of
[1:20:37] himself.
[1:20:40] And that's why you see the prophet
[1:20:42] shepherd on the scene today, the pillar
[1:20:44] of fire. He's preaching the prophets and
[1:20:47] the scriptures because they're
[1:20:48] testifying of him.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:20:53] forever.
[1:20:58] So
[1:21:00] when you
[1:21:02] distance yourself from the pillar of
[1:21:04] fire in that picture,
[1:21:07] you're removing the landmark. And the
[1:21:10] Bible says, don't remove the landmark.
[1:21:13] Amen. That's what anchors us. That's
[1:21:15] where we know our place, where our
[1:21:18] position, where our property is.
[1:21:22] And we don't want to be dogmatic about
[1:21:23] that statement. We want to have the
[1:21:25] grace of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Okay? So if somebody gets out of step,
[1:21:30] Lord, help us to help him to come back
[1:21:32] in line because we're living in the end
[1:21:35] time when the spirit of apostasy is
[1:21:38] sweeping the world. Why? They're like
[1:21:40] Saul. They only had a knowledge of the
[1:21:43] truth.
[1:21:46] And it's a almost a perfect knowledge of
[1:21:48] the truth. But time and circumstances,
[1:21:52] God proves who is his.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Because the difference then between his
[1:22:00] sheep and those that turn out to be
[1:22:03] sheep in wolves clothing is his sheep
[1:22:07] have the spirit of truth.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; They have the revelation of what he
[1:22:12] said. And upon this rock I'll build my
[1:22:15] church. And though the gates of hell
[1:22:17] come against us, it's the greatest
[1:22:19] battle ever fought day in and day out.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; But it shall not prevail.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Why? I'm under the blood. My sins are
[1:22:30] remitted. It is a fact.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; And I know I'll make mistakes. And I
[1:22:38] know I have to die daily.
[1:22:41] So I know what I got to do because the
[1:22:43] shepherd is leading me. He's guiding me.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:22:51] So, the pillar of fire
[1:22:53] manifested himself
[1:22:56] though Moses knew what his purpose was
[1:22:59] in life. his mother taught him
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; and and and and I'm be and then may you
[1:23:05] know it's a blessing that you've grown
[1:23:07] up under parents in the message but also
[1:23:10] it can be a liability
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS TAUGHT his purpose. He
[1:23:17] knew what he was ordained for but he
[1:23:19] could not fulfill it until he met the
[1:23:22] pillar of fire.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE PILLAR OF FIRE THAT'S THE
[1:23:27] SHEPHERD. RIGHT?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; It's the pillar of fire that's Christ.
[1:23:31] And he comes into his prophet to take
[1:23:33] control of his voice and his being in
[1:23:37] order to express what he is to that age.
[1:23:41] And when he came to Moses, what did he
[1:23:43] express? The token, the blood of the
[1:23:46] lamb, the power to call them out.
[1:23:57] So, so, so here's a key statement.
[1:24:02] If Jesus Christ,
[1:24:06] our shepherd, the son of man,
[1:24:10] if he overcame for us, and he did, he
[1:24:14] said, "It is finished. He conquered
[1:24:17] death, hell, and the grave
[1:24:21] for us.
[1:24:23] Then why do we have to fight the good
[1:24:26] fight of faith for the crown of life,
[1:24:29] for the crown of glory? Why? He said
[1:24:31] it's finished.
[1:24:33] He overcame for us so that he could
[1:24:36] overcome in us.
[1:24:39] And that he overcome in us. And there's
[1:24:42] where the power to become the sons of
[1:24:45] God are. Not just accepting Christ and
[1:24:48] what he did for us,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; but him coming into my life and
[1:24:54] overcoming death in my heart, hell in my
[1:24:57] mind, and the grave in my body.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] So here's the statement. The pillar of
[1:25:21] fire came down in the east on the Jordan
[1:25:24] River
[1:25:27] to anoint Jesus as the son of man's
[1:25:30] shepherd
[1:25:32] to conquer death,
[1:25:34] hell, and the grave for us. And look
[1:25:37] what it look how John identified that
[1:25:39] three-fold purpose. To conquer death by
[1:25:42] the remission of sins. to conquer hell
[1:25:44] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and to
[1:25:48] conquer the grave when he comes the
[1:25:50] second time to separate the shaft from
[1:25:53] the wheat and when the wheat will shine
[1:25:56] like the sun in his glory.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; So he identified it. It was in him, but
[1:26:02] it's been hidden.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; It's been hidden until this age.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And so what I'm trying to say is this.
[1:26:09] The pillar fire came down on the Jordan
[1:26:11] River in the east to anoint him as the
[1:26:14] son of man's shepherd to conquer death
[1:26:17] and hell and the grave for us
[1:26:20] that he might come down the same pillar
[1:26:22] of fire in the west on the Ohio River to
[1:26:27] unfold himself as the son of man
[1:26:31] shepherd by a son of man. Are we all
[1:26:33] together? by a son of man to conquer
[1:26:37] death, hell, and the grave in us.
[1:26:42] In us. That's why we point so much to
[1:26:46] the ministry of the pillar of fire in
[1:26:49] this day here. He conquered death, hell,
[1:26:51] and the grave for us. And now he's
[1:26:54] conquering death, hell, and the grave in
[1:26:56] us. And he does nothing until first Amos
[1:27:00] 3:7 says he shows it by his prophet
[1:27:03] shepherd.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Christ our shepherd I shall not want. He
[1:27:14] the pillar of fire supplies everything
[1:27:16] you need.
[1:27:19] Do we all agree that the pillar of fire
[1:27:21] is our savior?
[1:27:23] Do we all agree it's the pillar of fire
[1:27:25] that this is his work of redemption?
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; The immortal spirit of God is your
[1:27:31] savior
[1:27:34] by his power. And notice I shall not
[1:27:38] want because by his threefold
[1:27:42] manifestation
[1:27:43] of Christ our shepherd, he supplies
[1:27:47] everything we need.
[1:27:49] Three-fold. First, now here we come to
[1:27:52] the core of the message. First, the good
[1:27:56] shepherd.
[1:27:57] Second, the great shepherd. Third, the
[1:28:02] chief shepherd.
[1:28:04] Good shepherd makes a way for the great
[1:28:07] shepherd. And the great shepherd makes a
[1:28:09] way for the chief shepherd. Now, here's
[1:28:13] the scripture on it. John 10:11
[1:28:21] says this,
[1:28:24] "I am the good shepherd. The good
[1:28:27] shepherd layeth his wife down for the
[1:28:29] sheep."
[1:28:31] Who is the good shepherd?
[1:28:34] The I am
[1:28:36] the pillar of fire.
[1:28:39] How is he going to lay down his life for
[1:28:42] his sheep? by coming down on the Jordan
[1:28:45] River and anointing Christ, the son of
[1:28:48] man,
[1:28:49] to bring many sons the glory.
[1:28:56] So the good shepherd
[1:28:58] lays down his life for his sheep
[1:29:02] that their sins might be remitted by
[1:29:05] what? The power of the blood of Jesus
[1:29:07] Christ.
[1:29:09] It all starts with the blood of Jesus
[1:29:12] Christ.
[1:29:16] Then he becomes the great shepherd which
[1:29:19] is in Hebrews chapter 13 and 30. Let me
[1:29:23] read this.
[1:29:36] Now, the God of peace
[1:29:39] that brought again from the dead,
[1:29:42] our Lord Jesus Christ, that great
[1:29:44] shepherd of the sheep
[1:29:47] through the blood of the everlasting
[1:29:49] covenant. So, in order for him to raise
[1:29:53] up, he had to lay his life down.
[1:29:57] And when he laid his life down by the
[1:30:00] power of the blood of Jesus Christ for
[1:30:03] you now, THE HOLY GHOST, praise God, is
[1:30:07] the power to raise up in your life once
[1:30:11] the blood has been applied.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new creature,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; A NEW CREATION. WHAT FOR? TO PROVE by
[1:30:19] the great shepherd that greater is he
[1:30:21] that is in you than your trials,
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; than the persecution of Saul against
[1:30:27] David.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Now, that's power.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's real power.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; That's Holy Ghost power.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want in my life.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Lay down. The good shepherd lays down
[1:30:44] his life. manifest the power of the
[1:30:46] blood so he can raise up as the great
[1:30:48] shepherd, ascend back to the pillar of
[1:30:51] fire and SEND DOWN THE HOLY Ghost
[1:30:58] to become a new creature
[1:31:01] and have power to overcome the Sauls and
[1:31:05] the Philistines and everything that
[1:31:08] comes against you. That power of the
[1:31:10] Holy Ghost according to the promise of
[1:31:13] his word is in you to overcome.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:19] Okay. So the good shepherd makes a way
[1:31:22] for the great shepherd. Can we say amen?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Then the great shepherd is making a way
[1:31:28] for the chief shepherd. And we find that
[1:31:32] in first Peter 5 and4.
[1:31:48] And when the chief shepherd shall
[1:31:50] appear, you shall receive what?
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; A crown of glory that fadeth not away.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. David was anointed for a kingly
[1:32:01] position.
[1:32:02] He was anointed right then as the king,
[1:32:06] the chief shepherd of Israel. But there
[1:32:08] was a gap. There was 15 years before he
[1:32:11] ever came to the throne.
[1:32:14] And when you are born again, you receive
[1:32:18] the spirit of adoption. And it reveals
[1:32:20] your position in Jesus Christ.
[1:32:29] But then
[1:32:31] like David, you have to overcome
[1:32:35] first
[1:32:36] before you can have your coronation
[1:32:39] ceremony when the chief shepherd comes,
[1:32:42] which is the second coming of Jesus
[1:32:44] Christ.
[1:32:46] So now we're seeing where sunship is
[1:32:49] fully placed.
[1:32:53] It's placed under the chief shepherd
[1:32:57] because that's when David took the
[1:32:59] throne. That's when David was crowned.
[1:33:03] That's when David exercise
[1:33:06] the power to command it. His supreme
[1:33:09] authority. Though he was anointed for
[1:33:11] it, there was a reason. And that's what
[1:33:15] we want to see. so that you can be
[1:33:17] encouraged in your Christian life and
[1:33:20] understand why you're going through what
[1:33:22] you're going through
[1:33:24] because it's painful. It's a harder way.
[1:33:28] Amen. To be a good soldier of Jesus
[1:33:31] Christ, you have to endure hardness. And
[1:33:33] you know what that hardness is?
[1:33:36] Evil for the good you do.
[1:33:41] It's exactly what the Bible says.
[1:33:44] Evil for good. That's hard. That takes
[1:33:48] power. That takes the power of the Holy
[1:33:51] Ghost and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:33:55] to die daily to those thoughts of the
[1:33:58] carnal mind and Satan saying, "You want
[1:34:00] to get even and that's not fair and why
[1:34:03] did they do this and why did this happen
[1:34:04] to me and why did that happen to me?"
[1:34:07] God permits it for your perfection.
[1:34:11] And when we get a revelation of that,
[1:34:14] then we understand the harder way is his
[1:34:18] way. And I know it leads to the promise
[1:34:20] of glory. And that's all that matters in
[1:34:23] my life
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; because we don't know when we're going
[1:34:28] to leave here.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; They're dying at all ages. But thank God
[1:34:34] when many of them when they're dying
[1:34:36] they at least have accepted Christ as
[1:34:39] their shepherd.
[1:34:44] So now let's just see it again.
[1:34:46] The three-fold manifestation of Christ
[1:34:49] the shepherd supplies everything you
[1:34:52] need to come to your sunship to the
[1:34:56] crown and the throne of glory.
[1:35:01] The good shepherd is the power of the
[1:35:05] blood. So I'm going to say it again and
[1:35:08] then you say blood. The good shepherd is
[1:35:10] the power of his blood.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; The great shepherd is the power of his
[1:35:15] holy spirit.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And the chief shepherd is the power of
[1:35:21] the spoken creative word. The power to
[1:35:26] command it. the power to overcome the
[1:35:29] grave.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; The blood separates your soul from
[1:35:33] death. The Holy Spirit which takes into
[1:35:37] your heart the mercy seat then separates
[1:35:40] your mind, your spirit from the gates of
[1:35:43] hell that's constantly beating you and
[1:35:45] pounding you with carnal thoughts. Now
[1:35:49] by carnal thought it doesn't necessarily
[1:35:52] mean worldly thought but the wrong
[1:35:54] understanding of the message leaning to
[1:35:56] your own understanding misapplying
[1:35:59] misinterpreting
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of air and that's what
[1:36:05] we have to overcome
[1:36:07] sinful impulses of the flesh my body is
[1:36:10] not redeemed sticky nature
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:36:15] but the greatest threat tar of all is
[1:36:18] the deception of Satan in this age the
[1:36:21] spirit of error becomes 99.99
[1:36:26] right
[1:36:28] one word
[1:36:30] I didn't teach that
[1:36:32] that's not my message that's what the
[1:36:35] prophet shepherd taught us of this age
[1:36:38] so that we would know what we are up
[1:36:41] against
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; and we fight not with a dogmatic spirit
[1:36:47] we fight with the love of God in our
[1:36:49] heart because he that converts a sinner,
[1:36:52] that's an unbeliever, from the air of
[1:36:55] their way hides a multitude of sin. And
[1:36:58] that's the power of God in my life. And
[1:37:00] that's what I want to see Christ doing
[1:37:01] through me is help those people that are
[1:37:04] wrong to be right.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:37:18] The deacon wanted to give me three
[1:37:19] bottles of water. Brother Israel said
[1:37:21] two.
[1:37:24] It's only fair. It's right.
[1:37:28] That's the order.
[1:37:30] We want to respect it. All right.
[1:37:39] So let me now
[1:37:42] be because the symbols of crowns and
[1:37:45] thrones if we lived in Europe you know
[1:37:48] it's more common to the people in Europe
[1:37:51] but here we have presidents okay and so
[1:37:55] crowns and thrones let me read to you
[1:37:57] what brother Brown said about it so you
[1:37:59] can see it pertains to adoption it
[1:38:01] pertains to redeemed human beings
[1:38:06] okay and so the first one is from how
[1:38:09] can I overcome? So the promise of
[1:38:11] wearing a crown of glory, it also fits
[1:38:14] with the promise of Revelations 3:21. To
[1:38:17] him that overcomemeth will sit with me
[1:38:19] in my throne even as I overcame and sat
[1:38:23] with my father in his throne.
[1:38:26] So now let's look to the voice of this
[1:38:28] age to understand what that means from
[1:38:32] how can I overcome. If we suffer for
[1:38:34] Christ and his word, we will reign with
[1:38:38] him. For he is the word.
[1:38:41] Okay, that's not the letter. That's the
[1:38:44] locust.
[1:38:46] That's the immortal spirit.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, for he is the word. Remember, if
[1:38:51] we suffer for him and his word, we will
[1:38:53] reign with him in his word. So there's
[1:38:57] the throne in our heart. Yes,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; we're going to come to a place by his
[1:39:02] blood and the seven stripes of the
[1:39:05] spirit, his faith, his virtue, his
[1:39:07] knowledge, his temperance, his patience,
[1:39:09] his godliness, his brotherly kindness,
[1:39:12] so that he can take his throne in us as
[1:39:15] king of kings and lord of lords.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And that's sunship,
[1:39:21] that's when he has you under his supreme
[1:39:23] control and then he can exercise his
[1:39:26] supreme power through it.
[1:39:29] And we need to understand this because I
[1:39:32] see people around the world trying to
[1:39:34] manifest these things
[1:39:37] and it's the promise for the age. But
[1:39:39] God has a time, a season, and a way to
[1:39:42] do it.
[1:39:45] All right. So, here's another one from
[1:39:48] the Philadelphiaian church age. It is in
[1:39:51] the midst of the time of great trouble
[1:39:52] that Jesus comes. And with his coming
[1:39:56] there is a resurrection.
[1:39:58] Many are to come forth out of the dust
[1:40:00] and rise with those who are alive but
[1:40:02] waiting for his return.
[1:40:04] And these will be given crowns. Why?
[1:40:08] Because they're sons of God. They're
[1:40:10] kings with them. They are reigning with
[1:40:12] him. That is what crown signifies.
[1:40:14] Reigning and ruling with the great King
[1:40:17] Christ himself. That is the promise to
[1:40:20] all those who suffer with him here on
[1:40:22] earth. All those who endured patiently,
[1:40:24] knowing that God, the just judge, would
[1:40:27] reward them. They who gave up all for
[1:40:30] him and committed all to him will sit
[1:40:33] down in his throne and share in his
[1:40:35] glorious kingdom. So what you will be
[1:40:38] placed in Christ so Christ can reign in
[1:40:42] you and through you.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. for he is the king of glory and
[1:40:47] it's him that has you in supreme control
[1:40:50] that's able to bring all things else in
[1:40:53] supreme control
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; and then one last one Philadelphia
[1:40:58] church age
[1:41:01] the bride goes wherever the bridegroom
[1:41:03] is
[1:41:04] she will never be left by him she will
[1:41:08] never leave his side she will share the
[1:41:10] throne with him she will be crowned with
[1:41:13] his glory and honor honor.
[1:41:17] So you see, you're you're you're called
[1:41:19] when the shepherd calls you. He's
[1:41:22] calling you for a glorious purpose. It's
[1:41:25] his glorious purpose in you in your
[1:41:28] life. And when you respond to the call,
[1:41:31] you surrender your life to him through
[1:41:33] the blood of Jesus Christ. So you Satan
[1:41:36] can be taken away controlling your life
[1:41:39] and he can begin
[1:41:42] to take control of your life. Praise the
[1:41:46] Lord.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:56] So if Christ our shepherd conquers
[1:41:58] death, hell, and the grave for us, then
[1:42:01] why do we have to fight the good fight
[1:42:05] of faith to win the crown of his
[1:42:08] glorious life, the glorious liberty of
[1:42:11] the sunship
[1:42:12] when he comes riding in as the chief
[1:42:15] shepherd?
[1:42:18] See why? He has to conquer in us. The
[1:42:22] power of the blood kicks out the old
[1:42:25] man. It takes back control of your
[1:42:27] being.
[1:42:29] And then the Holy Ghost comes into that
[1:42:32] and fights the good fight of faith with
[1:42:35] you by taking the sword that the king
[1:42:38] placed in brother Brandham's hand to cut
[1:42:40] out the word of God for this age. And by
[1:42:43] those promises and that revelation,
[1:42:45] you're able to overcome
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; and you're able to endure hardness.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; The hardness is real. The pain is real,
[1:42:54] is it not?
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's very real.
[1:42:59] Suffering physically, mentally,
[1:43:02] emotionally,
[1:43:04] our loved ones. We all have loved ones
[1:43:06] we've had to fight for. We had all loved
[1:43:08] ones that go astray. We know what that
[1:43:11] means. And the love of God constrains us
[1:43:14] with a faith that works by love to go to
[1:43:17] the throne of the great shepherd. Put
[1:43:19] that need on the throne and claim it and
[1:43:22] believe it.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Be not anxious for nothing,
[1:43:27] but by prayer and your petition
[1:43:31] with thanksgiving,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; make your requests known to God. Lord, I
[1:43:37] thank you. You delivered me here. Lord,
[1:43:39] I thank you. Do you delivered them
[1:43:40] there? Lord, I thank you. I thank you. I
[1:43:43] THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE. And
[1:43:45] now I'm gonna place it there
[1:43:48] and I'm not Now, this is the this is
[1:43:50] what you got to overcome. I'm going to
[1:43:52] place it there
[1:43:54] and I'm not going to be anxious about
[1:43:56] it. So anxious about it. This is real.
[1:44:00] Okay. Um you you you you try to help it.
[1:44:04] You don't realize it, right? We try to
[1:44:06] help it. Well, you know, I prayed this.
[1:44:09] So then you go over here and you're
[1:44:10] doing this and you're going over here
[1:44:12] and doing that. Just let go. But it's
[1:44:15] hard because there's emotions behind it.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; We have love. We have feelings. There's
[1:44:20] emotion behind it.
[1:44:24] But it's powerful.
[1:44:26] If you ever can get an experience like
[1:44:28] that, take it to the Lord and leave it
[1:44:31] there. That's what he wants you to do.
[1:44:34] And now we're not up araiding you. We're
[1:44:37] just encouraging you. There's power in
[1:44:41] that kind of prayer and confidence in
[1:44:44] God
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; in his time, in his season, and in his
[1:44:49] way. He will do it.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; So the power of the good shepherd is his
[1:45:00] blood. The power of the great shepherd
[1:45:02] is his holy spirit. And the power of the
[1:45:05] chief shepherd is the power of the
[1:45:07] king's command, the spoken creative
[1:45:10] word.
[1:45:12] One comes out of the other. Out of the
[1:45:15] blood comes the Holy Ghost. Out of the
[1:45:17] Holy Ghost, when it comes and gets you
[1:45:19] under supreme control. Then is when your
[1:45:22] name on the check is the same as his.
[1:45:24] Then is when we are an amateur God. Then
[1:45:27] is when you have the power to command
[1:45:29] it. But not until then.
[1:45:35] So, we're thankful
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; by Amos 3:7.
[1:45:40] The Lord I'm I'm I'm going to amplify.
[1:45:42] This is the New William amplified
[1:45:44] version.
[1:45:46] The Lord, the pillar of fire, will do
[1:45:48] nothing for you, his sheep,
[1:45:52] except he reveals it first by
[1:45:55] manifestation
[1:45:57] in his prophet shepherd for your age.
[1:46:07] And what did he manifest? The son of
[1:46:08] man.
[1:46:10] Not his perfection, God's perfection.
[1:46:14] And we've seen that by what he did for
[1:46:17] us, what Christ the pillar of fire did
[1:46:19] for us through his prophet, he restored
[1:46:22] the bleeding word that the
[1:46:25] denominational ages had made none of
[1:46:28] effect.
[1:46:30] Where's Acts 2:38? You got a name that
[1:46:32] you're dead and you live.
[1:46:34] Just that simple thing. Acts 2:38.
[1:46:38] He restored it so that we can get under
[1:46:41] the blood by the spirit of his promise.
[1:46:44] And then those
[1:46:46] who applied the blood and received the
[1:46:48] bloody word and that what comes next?
[1:46:50] The token. It released the token. The
[1:46:53] life of Christ to overcome and bring you
[1:46:56] to the stature of a perfect man. If you
[1:46:59] want to know what the token is, look at
[1:47:01] the stature of the perfect man. There's
[1:47:03] the token.
[1:47:04] It's how many spirits are there? There's
[1:47:07] one spirit. But he takes it and he
[1:47:10] builds you and he builds you and he
[1:47:11] builds you
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; until he caps you off. And then when you
[1:47:15] come to the top of the pyramid, that's
[1:47:18] where he manifests the kingly power of
[1:47:22] his supreme authority, the spoken
[1:47:24] creative word. And that's exactly what
[1:47:25] we've seen in this age by Malachi 4.
[1:47:29] And that's why we sing the song, "Can't
[1:47:32] you see why I'm happy?" Now, my my
[1:47:34] pastor back at church at the open door,
[1:47:36] I can quote him in this because he's
[1:47:38] quoted at a similar time. He says out to
[1:47:40] them, and I I'm I'm just a sheep like
[1:47:42] you there, he says, "Now, I know that
[1:47:44] song makes some of you happy." And I'm
[1:47:45] scr unhappy and I'm scratching my head.
[1:47:48] What? You know, can't you see why I'm
[1:47:51] happy? I've accepted the word of the
[1:47:54] Lord by the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; who knew these things and not known him
[1:48:00] but he vindicated him in power.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; The ancient of days came down on Sunset
[1:48:08] Mountain
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; and the Ancient of Days is THE SUPREME
[1:48:12] AUTHORITY OF HIS SUPREME deity and he
[1:48:15] picked up a prophet to bring into
[1:48:17] preview Revelations 3:21. He began to
[1:48:21] sit in his kingly power.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; That's a lot, isn't it? But aren't you
[1:48:29] thankful for it?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; And when did he do it? In the Coronado
[1:48:33] Forest. And Coronado is Spanish for
[1:48:37] what?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; The coronation place, the crowning
[1:48:40] place. He's given us a PREVIEW OF IT. WE
[1:48:44] ARE WITHOUT EXCUSE.
[1:48:48] And as your pastor shepherd, local
[1:48:50] pastor shepherd, I'm here to to try to
[1:48:55] help him to help you
[1:48:58] to see these things. But you have to
[1:49:01] have the desire
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; in your heart to say, "I'm going to go
[1:49:06] look at these things."
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Brother, uh, we come out of the same
[1:49:11] church, Brother Bob Willard. We all came
[1:49:14] out of the same church, all ordained
[1:49:15] under the same ministry.
[1:49:18] But the thing that we three have in
[1:49:20] common is when we were taught something
[1:49:22] or we heard something, we went back to
[1:49:24] the source and we dug in
[1:49:28] and we saw it for ourselves.
[1:49:31] So nobody talked us into it. I didn't
[1:49:34] believe it because this wouldn't believe
[1:49:37] it. I believed it because I had the
[1:49:39] personal experience
[1:49:41] with Christ, my shepherd.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; And that's what we want for you.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; That's what we want for you. All right.
[1:49:48] Let me go let me bring this to a close
[1:49:51] now because I'm at 56 minutes.
[1:49:55] All right. I said we would I said we
[1:49:58] would come back.
[1:50:01] I'm going to come back to David. First,
[1:50:03] Paul Paul was the one that said, "I have
[1:50:07] fought a good fight, Timothy. I've
[1:50:10] finished the course. I've kept the
[1:50:12] faith. Henceforth, there's laid up for
[1:50:15] me a crown of righteousness,
[1:50:18] the crown of righteousness, the crown of
[1:50:20] immortal life, the crown of glory. It's
[1:50:23] all that same immortal person. It's that
[1:50:26] outpouring of the Holy Ghost where he
[1:50:29] fully takes his seat in your heart in a
[1:50:32] coronation ceremony of adoption.
[1:50:36] But you already have the spirit of
[1:50:38] adoption. You already have the
[1:50:40] revelation of what you are.
[1:50:44] The question is he has to overcome in
[1:50:48] you in order to make you worthy for the
[1:50:51] throne. So, so now Paul is telling
[1:50:54] Timothy, second Timothy chapter 2 and
[1:50:57] verse 8, he's telling Timothy how to be
[1:51:01] the good soldier of Jesus Christ. Okay?
[1:51:05] The good soldier of Jesus Christ. Not
[1:51:07] Jesus Christ over here, but Jesus Christ
[1:51:11] in you.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He is the soldier. You've got to get the
[1:51:16] soldier in you. He's the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:19] He's the soldier.
[1:51:21] And so let's reason now and let's see
[1:51:23] how he he does this and I will bring
[1:51:26] this quickly to a close.
[1:51:31] He says remember let's see second
[1:51:34] Timothy 2 and verse 8. Let's read it.
[1:51:38] Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed
[1:51:40] of David was raised from the dead
[1:51:42] according to my gospel. I thought what?
[1:51:46] He was raised from the dead according to
[1:51:47] your gospel? Paul, you weren't even
[1:51:49] sure. You didn't even recognize him back
[1:51:52] then.
[1:51:53] But the revelation
[1:51:56] of full redemption and the New Testament
[1:51:58] covenant, the pillar of fire returned
[1:52:01] and gave it to Paul.
[1:52:03] And now what Paul is going to say,
[1:52:05] Timothy, I told you to endure hardness
[1:52:08] as a good soldier of the cross. Now I'm
[1:52:10] going to use my own life as a testimony.
[1:52:14] And he says here,
[1:52:16] "Wherein I suffer as an evildoer."
[1:52:19] Preaching the resurrection to the Jews.
[1:52:22] And that days, he was suffering as an
[1:52:25] evildoer.
[1:52:27] Heretic
[1:52:29] even into bonds to imprisonment
[1:52:32] in that old, cold, dingy,
[1:52:36] ratinfested
[1:52:37] prison. God put him in there. But then
[1:52:40] God revealed himself greater in that
[1:52:44] suffering.
[1:52:45] He wrote the epistles
[1:52:48] and he says here
[1:52:51] wherein I suffered trouble as what? An
[1:52:54] evildoer unto bonds
[1:52:58] according to but the gospel is not
[1:53:01] bound. The word of God therefore I
[1:53:03] endure all things for the elect's sake.
[1:53:06] So Paul's saying, "I'm not going to
[1:53:07] complain about it.
[1:53:10] I I've been in distress. I've been in
[1:53:12] hunger. I've been in cold. I've been in
[1:53:15] the deep. I've been beat with stripes."
[1:53:18] How could this man do it? The only way
[1:53:20] he could do it would be by the power of
[1:53:22] the Holy Ghost and the revelation of
[1:53:24] what his reward was
[1:53:27] and his love for the church.
[1:53:30] Therefore, I do all things for the
[1:53:32] elect's sake that they may obtain the
[1:53:34] salvation. The word salvation here, if
[1:53:37] you'll run it through the New Testament,
[1:53:38] is full redemption.
[1:53:41] Okay? This is coming into your adoption.
[1:53:44] That they may attain the salvation
[1:53:48] in Christ Jesus with what?
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Eternal glory.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Eternal glory.
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Crown of glory. eternal glory,
[1:53:59] throne of glory. It's just symbols
[1:54:03] of the person of Jesus Christ when he
[1:54:06] comes as the chief shepherd.
[1:54:09] All right, next verses. We're going to
[1:54:12] make it real to you. We're going to
[1:54:13] re-emphasize what we've already told
[1:54:15] you. Notice now, Timothy, this is how
[1:54:19] you become a good soldier of Jesus
[1:54:22] Christ.
[1:54:23] It is a faithful saying, for if we be
[1:54:26] dead with him, we shall also live with
[1:54:31] him. If we suffer, we shall also reign
[1:54:35] with him. If we deny him, he also will
[1:54:39] deny us.
[1:54:41] And so here we find the threefold
[1:54:45] manifestation of Christ our shepherd.
[1:54:49] First, you have to die to live.
[1:54:54] Second, you have to live to suffer.
[1:54:58] Third, why are you suffering? In order
[1:55:01] to reign.
[1:55:05] First, he says
[1:55:08] you have to die to live. Are we
[1:55:10] together?
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Second, then he says when you live, once
[1:55:14] you die to live, then you have to live
[1:55:16] to suffer.
[1:55:19] And then you're suffering for a glorious
[1:55:22] purpose. You're suffering for a crown of
[1:55:24] glory. You're suffering for his eternal
[1:55:27] glor glory that you might reign in his
[1:55:30] kingly power.
[1:55:32] So then why do we have to suffer? We
[1:55:36] have to suffer so that the character is
[1:55:39] molded in us and brings us under his
[1:55:42] supreme control so that we are fit to
[1:55:46] reign in his power.
[1:55:48] For power, kingly power without that
[1:55:52] character cannot reign. And so the
[1:55:55] brother I heard his prayer. What is he
[1:55:57] doing now? He's molding a church.
[1:56:00] Brother Brandham said, "What's holding
[1:56:02] back the coming of the Lord was the
[1:56:04] perfection of the church. She has to be
[1:56:06] perfectly right." How is she perfectly
[1:56:08] right? Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[1:56:11] temperance, godliness, brotherly love,
[1:56:14] and that's power.
[1:56:17] That's power. When God gives you the
[1:56:19] knowledge of what is right and wrong in
[1:56:21] a situation, and you've been waiting a
[1:56:23] long time for the answer, and then you
[1:56:26] go forward and he says, "Hold your
[1:56:27] peace." Temperance,
[1:56:30] right? Temperance. Temperance. God gave
[1:56:33] it to me. Hold your peace. Why?
[1:56:36] Patience.
[1:56:38] Patience. Okay. Then one day you'll be
[1:56:41] walking along. You'll be driving along.
[1:56:43] You'll be in a situation you're not even
[1:56:44] thinking about it. And there it'll
[1:56:46] unfold. The right time, the right place,
[1:56:49] the right person, the right way.
[1:56:52] So, who's controlling this situation?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. And how do you think the
[1:56:57] outcome's going to be?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to be just right. HE
[1:57:01] DOES ALL THINGS JUST RIGHT.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; IT'S not me taking a gift like one of
[1:57:07] the nine. Let me show you what I can do.
[1:57:09] As soon as you see that, you know
[1:57:11] something is wrong.
[1:57:13] Okay? Something is wrong. Okay? We don't
[1:57:18] take our ministral gifts and try to see,
[1:57:20] let me show you what I know. Let me show
[1:57:22] you how I preach. No.
[1:57:25] No, no. Lord God, let us die. Let us get
[1:57:29] out of the way. We want Christ, our
[1:57:31] shepherd, to be glorified in the flock.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, first dying to live. So, how
[1:57:40] are you going to die to live?
[1:57:43] By the good shepherd.
[1:57:46] Praise the Lord. Oh, I love it.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible hooks together perfectly, but
[1:57:50] it takes the anointing of the spirit.
[1:57:52] How are you going to die to live? So
[1:57:55] when he calls you and he brings yourself
[1:57:57] to him, the first thing that has to
[1:57:59] happen is you have to die
[1:58:04] to live.
[1:58:06] And there's only one way you can die and
[1:58:09] that's by faith in the blood of Jesus
[1:58:11] Christ. Okay? Calvary. Lord, I am
[1:58:16] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:58:19] live. But the life I now live, I live by
[1:58:23] the power of the Holy Ghost, the son of
[1:58:25] God. Now that I got the Holy Ghost, and
[1:58:29] by the way, I prayed for two years. I I
[1:58:32] I asked, I knocked. I sought. Okay?
[1:58:36] Because I'm not a Baptist. I did not
[1:58:38] receive the Holy Ghost when I believed
[1:58:40] the message. But the message told me
[1:58:42] exactly what I needed to do to receive
[1:58:45] the Holy Ghost. And one of the greatest
[1:58:48] things you need to receive the Holy
[1:58:50] Ghost is desire.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Jacob had the desire. Nothing meant more
[1:58:59] to Jacob than the birthight.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Though he was a shyster and he did many
[1:59:06] things wrong, but because of that
[1:59:08] desire, what was that desire? That was
[1:59:10] Israel on the inside, the gene of God,
[1:59:13] wanting Jacob to die so Israel could be
[1:59:16] born. And when Israel were born, HE HAD
[1:59:18] POWER WITH ALMIGHTY GOD AND MAN.
[1:59:24] And then what's the next thing Israel
[1:59:25] did? Then is it was Israel that put the
[1:59:28] code of seven colors on Joseph. See,
[1:59:30] then then the Holy Ghost in you, Israel,
[1:59:33] he's going to put the coat of seven
[1:59:35] colors on you so that you can then come
[1:59:38] to the throne, Pharaoh's throne, where
[1:59:41] he said to Joseph, YOU WILL BE OVER ALL
[1:59:45] OF MY HOUSE.
[1:59:48] WELL, I want him over all my house.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; And so, here we are in this age, and
[1:59:54] this is another thing people understand.
[1:59:56] I'm coming quickly to a close. As they
[1:59:59] say, well, we're beyond Pentecost.
[2:00:01] As far as the age goes, we are.
[2:00:04] We are. We're up here in Joseph
[2:00:07] perfection. We've seen it at Sunset
[2:00:10] Mountain, right? We've seen a prophet
[2:00:13] being placed over the entire house of
[2:00:15] God, which it really wasn't Joseph over
[2:00:18] the house of God. It's Christ in this
[2:00:20] prophet trying to bring us into
[2:00:23] subjection to his word.
[2:00:29] And so the point is this. They say,
[2:00:32] "Well, we're up here. We need to speak
[2:00:34] the word and I'm going to speak the word
[2:00:36] and things like that."
[2:00:38] That's the promise for the age.
[2:00:42] But kingly power without the character
[2:00:46] to control your life is demonic.
[2:00:52] And so the point is, how are you going
[2:00:55] to reign? How are you going to suffer to
[2:00:57] reign if you've never lived to suffer?
[2:01:00] And how are you going to live to suffer
[2:01:02] if you've never died to live? There's
[2:01:05] the problem. There's actually the
[2:01:07] greatest battle.
[2:01:09] Die to live.
[2:01:12] Dying is a process. Dying is the baptism
[2:01:16] of the Holy Ghost and fire that comes
[2:01:18] upon that blood and that faith. Lord,
[2:01:21] this is my desire. Take all my all of my
[2:01:24] ambitions, everything that I want in my
[2:01:26] life. This is the most important thing
[2:01:29] to me. And I'm going to cry like a baby,
[2:01:32] Lord, until you give it to me. Not just
[2:01:35] when I'm here at the church, at the
[2:01:36] altar, BUT IN MY HOME, IN MY PRAYER
[2:01:38] CLOSET. I'm going to knock and knock and
[2:01:41] knock until he fills me with the Holy
[2:01:43] Ghost. And that's my testimony.
[2:01:46] That's my testimony. Then you have power
[2:01:51] in you
[2:01:53] to suffer
[2:01:55] the harder way. So people many years,
[2:01:58] 20, 30 years in the message really never
[2:02:00] got beyond a knowledge of the truth. And
[2:02:02] then what happens? The trials are
[2:02:04] getting harder and harder. The world is
[2:02:06] getting stronger and stronger. the power
[2:02:08] of the age and and the deception is all
[2:02:10] moving in and the people say I can't
[2:02:12] take it anymore.
[2:02:15] Are we together?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You know, I felt like I couldn't take it
[2:02:20] anymore.
[2:02:23] But his grace, there's something in me
[2:02:26] that's holding me. There's something in
[2:02:29] me that won't let me quit. I have a
[2:02:32] revelation of my goal. I have a
[2:02:34] revelation of the promise. And I know
[2:02:37] we're in the age where the promise of
[2:02:39] the chief shepherd has been vindicated.
[2:02:41] And I believe it with all my heart and
[2:02:43] I'm living for it. And I die daily.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; And my mistakes mean nothing.
[2:02:52] Because we're humble, right? We admit,
[2:02:55] "Lord, I didn't mean to do that. Lord,
[2:02:57] forgive me. I spoke out of turn." You
[2:03:00] know, I I hate that when I speak out of
[2:03:02] turn.
[2:03:05] I was on the on a hike two days ago and
[2:03:09] it was the third time on this Pinnacle
[2:03:11] Peak hike and it was a lovely day. I
[2:03:13] mean, I was happy. It was a happy trail,
[2:03:17] you know. I was feeling good. I'm out
[2:03:19] here now. I'm away from the winter and
[2:03:21] this man with his son and his wife, they
[2:03:24] were coming up the trail and he was
[2:03:26] about oh 15 yards in front of her, but
[2:03:29] they were kind of going back and forth.
[2:03:31] It didn't seem too serious, but they
[2:03:33] were kind of like, you know, they had
[2:03:35] something they were disagreeing about.
[2:03:37] And so, happy me, I said, "Well, you
[2:03:40] know what? I'm on vacation. Otherwise,
[2:03:42] I'll offer you some counseling."
[2:03:46] And and and
[2:03:48] you know what he said? He says, "Well,
[2:03:50] I'll give you $30 an hour." And you know
[2:03:53] what she said? "Shut your mouth."
[2:03:57] I said, "You're right. That's good
[2:04:00] advice. That's good advice.
[2:04:04] Swift to hear, slow to speak. Amen. All
[2:04:08] right. So, how are you going to reign if
[2:04:10] you haven't suffered? And how are you
[2:04:12] going to suffer if you don't have the
[2:04:14] power of the Holy Ghost? And how are you
[2:04:16] going to live if you haven't died? So,
[2:04:18] it goes back to Pentecost, doesn't it?
[2:04:21] It goes back to the new birth. It goes
[2:04:23] back to dying out. It goes back to Jacob
[2:04:25] grace. It goes back to dying so Israel
[2:04:28] can live in the power of God with God
[2:04:31] and man.
[2:04:35] I had enough power to say that woman's
[2:04:37] right. Though they were disagreeing, she
[2:04:39] was right.
[2:04:41] Just shut my mouth. Don't interfere in
[2:04:44] their business.
[2:04:47] So, it was it was a good lesson for me.
[2:04:50] Absolutely. All right. Let me close.
[2:04:53] So you see though we're up here and
[2:04:56] we've seen a preview of the coronation
[2:04:59] ceremony. We've seen a prophet put the
[2:05:01] sword in his hands has the supreme
[2:05:04] authority of the supreme deity to speak
[2:05:07] in existence.
[2:05:10] But there's requirements
[2:05:13] and the requirements is kingly power
[2:05:17] without the character is not fit to
[2:05:20] rule. It's demonic. Okay. And we could
[2:05:23] give you illustrations of that, but
[2:05:24] we're out of time. Okay. So, you see
[2:05:27] then the three manifestations of the
[2:05:30] shepherd. The good shepherd enables you
[2:05:32] to die to live. The great shepherd
[2:05:35] raises up and enables you to live to
[2:05:38] suffer. He's interceding for you. He's
[2:05:42] there on the throne for you. He's
[2:05:45] holding the church while she's growing
[2:05:48] through the seven church ages to come to
[2:05:50] Revelations 3:21. And where is
[2:05:53] Revelations 3:21? at the top of the
[2:05:56] pyramid
[2:05:59] after he's done the work of the great
[2:06:02] shepherd after he's interceding for his
[2:06:05] church that's been suffering the
[2:06:07] persecution of denominational church the
[2:06:10] persecution of the world and all that
[2:06:12] after he she suffers and he forms her
[2:06:15] into the character then he's ready to
[2:06:18] take his throne
[2:06:22] sunship hip.
[2:06:25] How many can see that?
[2:06:28] Okay.
[2:06:30] So, now we come back to David. And this
[2:06:32] is what I want to close with.
[2:06:35] David the good shepherd.
[2:06:38] And now I'm I'm I'm 13 minutes. I'm
[2:06:40] over. Okay.
[2:06:43] David, here's the point. David the good
[2:06:46] shepherd was anointed to be the chief
[2:06:49] shepherd. And right then he was placed
[2:06:52] as king.
[2:06:54] Yet he did not express
[2:06:59] his kingly authority.
[2:07:03] He became a fugitive. He ran for his
[2:07:06] life. Saul was after him. Saul wanted to
[2:07:10] kill him. Saul didn't want to give up
[2:07:13] the throne. Saul didn't want to give up
[2:07:15] his position. He was jealous of him. and
[2:07:18] he tried to oppose David's kingly
[2:07:21] position, his kingly commission. And God
[2:07:25] permitted it.
[2:07:27] Why did God permit it? Because David
[2:07:30] could not go directly from the good
[2:07:32] shepherd to the chief shepherd. He's a
[2:07:35] type of Jesus Christ. And he had to go
[2:07:38] from the good shepherd to the great
[2:07:40] shepherd to the chief shepherd. And so
[2:07:43] he let Saul persecute him and run him
[2:07:47] and do him evil for the good that David
[2:07:50] did to PROVE THAT THE HOLY GHOST in
[2:07:54] David was greater than the evil spirit
[2:07:58] anointing the church natural and the
[2:08:01] Philistines and all that to persecute
[2:08:03] David.
[2:08:08] And so David, that interval between the
[2:08:12] good and the chief shepherd was the
[2:08:15] great shepherd. And why didn't Jesus
[2:08:17] just go from good shepherd to chief
[2:08:19] shepherd? For the same reason, he had to
[2:08:23] stay on the throne and intercede for us
[2:08:26] while we died daily to oursel while the
[2:08:29] church suffered the denominational
[2:08:31] persecution. put him to death like Saul
[2:08:33] wanted to do David right through the
[2:08:35] seven church ages. But now here we are
[2:08:38] at the end of the seven church ages and
[2:08:40] Revelations 3:21 is coming in view and a
[2:08:44] prophet has been anointed with the
[2:08:47] kingly ministry
[2:08:49] of Christ our shepherd. And we're so
[2:08:52] thankful that we see it. So finally,
[2:08:55] David came to his final test. And in
[2:08:58] your darkest hour, and we've all had our
[2:09:01] darkest hour, right? We've had that that
[2:09:03] time, that moment that something was
[2:09:05] pressing us. We didn't know the way out.
[2:09:08] It looked like, okay, you know what?
[2:09:10] This is looking like defeat. This is
[2:09:12] looking like they got us this time.
[2:09:15] And that's when God moved on the scene.
[2:09:17] Saul and his armies, they had David,
[2:09:21] they had him boxed in in the cave. He
[2:09:23] had nowhere to go. He had nowhere to
[2:09:25] hide. But God moved in on the scene. God
[2:09:29] help you. God help me in that darkest
[2:09:33] hour to hold our faith in the promise.
[2:09:36] David, you're anointed for a position.
[2:09:38] Nothing can stop that promise. Hold your
[2:09:41] faith. Stand there. David didn't know
[2:09:43] how he was going to get out of it. But
[2:09:46] God came on the scene in his way, in his
[2:09:50] time, and he raised up a standard for
[2:09:52] David. And you know what it was? He gave
[2:09:55] Saul and his men a sleeping pill
[2:10:02] symbolically, right?
[2:10:05] Just, you know, no swords, no clash, no
[2:10:07] armor. Just gave them a sleeping pill.
[2:10:11] And they were out cold.
[2:10:13] They were out cold. And they were
[2:10:16] falling asleep. And then and then here
[2:10:18] comes David. And his men said, "The Lord
[2:10:22] has delivered him in your hands, David.
[2:10:24] Here's your opportunity, David. Here's
[2:10:26] your time. He did you evil, evil, evil,
[2:10:28] and all you did was good, good, good.
[2:10:31] Slay him, David. The Lord's delivered in
[2:10:33] your hands."
[2:10:35] And do you believe David was tempted to
[2:10:37] do it? He sure was.
[2:10:40] But then what happened? There was a
[2:10:42] battle inside David. And David knew the
[2:10:46] scripture, touch not my anointed and do
[2:10:49] my prophets no harm.
[2:10:52] And so instead of killing him, he had
[2:10:56] the character that what? Spared his
[2:10:59] life. Spared his life. That's what I
[2:11:02] want to do to my enemies, especially in
[2:11:05] the RELIGIOUS REALM. GOD HELP THEM. They
[2:11:08] don't understand what they're doing.
[2:11:12] And so he took the king's sword, cut a
[2:11:14] piece of the king's garment, and when
[2:11:17] Saul woke up, he waved it to him. He got
[2:11:20] his attention. And when he saw that, and
[2:11:23] he knew, musicians, please come. He knew
[2:11:27] that David had spared his life, he said,
[2:11:30] "Now I know." Can we stand? Now I know
[2:11:35] what
[2:11:36] you'll be king
[2:11:39] because whereas I rewarded evil for
[2:11:42] good, you rewarded good for evil. That's
[2:11:47] the testimony I want. And brothers and
[2:11:50] sister, that's a painful testimony.
[2:11:54] That's the harder way. But that's the
[2:11:56] way that the prophet shepherd has led us
[2:11:59] in this day as our example. the harder
[2:12:02] way leading us into the tremendous
[2:12:05] victory of the love divine.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Do we know that song? Lord, my heart is
[2:12:14] open. Won't you come inside? Fill up all
[2:12:17] my being ever to abide.
[2:12:21] How many can give me a little bouquet
[2:12:23] and say, "You help me if I help me." All
[2:12:26] right. And I it helps me too because
[2:12:30] it's it's a real battle. It's a real
[2:12:33] battle. You got burdens. You got
[2:12:36] burdens. Brother Israel as an
[2:12:38] individual, he's got burdens. But as a
[2:12:40] pastor, he's also bearing your burdens.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; So pray for one another.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pray. Let the faith that works by
[2:12:49] love. Pray for one another. I know a
[2:12:52] thousand% that this man is doing the
[2:12:56] very best he can for you. So are the
[2:12:58] deacons. So is the church. Love one
[2:13:01] another. Pull together. And remember a
[2:13:05] church that has lost their burden for
[2:13:07] soul saving.
[2:13:09] Be soul saving
[2:13:14] is open.
[2:13:17] I need grace
[2:13:20] inside.
[2:13:23] Feel upon my being
[2:13:29] never to abide.
[2:13:34] I've open up the windows.
[2:13:40] I th
[2:13:42] every door.
[2:13:46] Come inside
[2:13:49] your Lord. I need you more and more.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; I like it from your heart. Now again
[2:13:59] my heart is open
[2:14:04] and won't you come
[2:14:11] upon my king
[2:14:16] ever to abide
[2:14:21] I've opened all the windows
[2:14:27] I'
[2:14:30] over.
[2:14:33] Come inside here, Lord. I need you more
[2:14:40] and more and more.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; While you're playing softly,
[2:14:46] Christ our shepherd,
[2:14:48] the power to become the sons of God. His
[2:14:56] blood
[2:14:57] is on the throne. His spirit is ready to
[2:15:01] be poured out. And we've seen the kingly
[2:15:05] power, have we not?
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; So, we know we're living in the age that
[2:15:10] God is going to bring the complete cycle
[2:15:12] of redemption.
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I want to be one of those. You want to
[2:15:19] be one of those? Let's just lift your
[2:15:22] hands. We're not going to do an altar
[2:15:24] call. I want to be one of those. God
[2:15:26] bless you, young children. All of you.
[2:15:29] Say, "Lord, let this faith work by love
[2:15:34] because that's power. That's power."
[2:15:38] God bless you. We're going to sing it
[2:15:39] one more time as our song leader comes.
[2:15:43] God bless you, brother Lord.
[2:15:48] open
[2:15:51] and won't you come into
[2:15:57] fill up all my being
[2:16:04] ever to abide.

[2:16:15] thrown wide every door.
[2:16:20] Come inside,
[2:16:23] Lord. I need you more and more and more.
[2:16:30] One more time. Yes, Lord, my heart is
[2:16:35] open.
[2:16:38] Won't you come inside
[2:16:44] and fill up all my being
[2:16:50] ever to
[2:16:55] I'm
[2:16:57] all the windows
[2:17:02] open wide every door
[2:17:07] Come inside. Dear Lord, I need you more
[2:17:14] and more and more.
[2:17:19] Maybe we can sing that song. Come and
[2:17:20] die.
[2:17:25] Jesus has a tablespread
[2:17:28] where the saints of God are fed. All he
[2:17:32] invites his chosen people come and die.
[2:17:38] With his manner he does speak. He

[2:18:20] obeying Christ's command. For the master

[2:20:00] Well, there are people almost everywhere
[2:20:04] whose hearts are all a flame with the
[2:20:07] fire that fell at Pentecost which
[2:20:10] cleansed and made them clean. Oh, it is
[2:20:13] burning now within my heart. All glory
[2:20:17] to his name. I'm so glad that I can say
[2:20:21] I'm one of them.

[2:20:47] of them.

[2:20:53] be nor of worldly fame, they have all
[2:20:57] received their Pentecost baptiz Jesus
[2:21:01] name. They are telling now both far and
[2:21:05] wide. His power is yet the same. I'm so
[2:21:09] glad that I can say I'm one of them.

[2:21:24] of them.

[2:21:33] Oh, I'm so glad that I can say the last
[2:21:37] verse. They were gathered. Oh, they were
[2:21:40] gathered in the offer room praying in
[2:21:45] his name. They were baptized with the
[2:21:48] Holy Ghost when powerful service came.
[2:21:52] Now what he did cared for them that day,
[2:21:56] he will do for you the same. I'm so glad
[2:21:59] that I can say I'm one of them.

[2:24:33] them. Amen. I really enjoy the word of
[2:24:37] the Lord tonight.
[2:24:39] As brother Bill was talking about two
[2:24:40] years he was seeking for the Holy Ghost.
[2:24:44] How many saints here remember when you
[2:24:46] were uh seeking the Holy Ghost some time
[2:24:50] was waiting, carrying service after
[2:24:53] service? It took me over two years as
[2:24:56] well. I know some people it doesn't take
[2:24:58] that long, but I just was really so
[2:25:01] hungry. I was discouraged
[2:25:04] many times. But one afternoon, it was on
[2:25:07] a Monday, the Holy Spirit came down and
[2:25:09] filled my soul. And I shall never forget
[2:25:12] it. And I want to encourage all of you
[2:25:15] that are seeking the Holy Spirit in your
[2:25:18] life or another filling of the Holy
[2:25:21] Ghost. Don't be discouraged. It's for
[2:25:24] you and he wants to give it to you. It's
[2:25:28] a good gift. It's good. It's precious
[2:25:31] and he wants you to have it. And you
[2:25:33] need that in your life to overcome the
[2:25:36] challenges of this day. And it's for
[2:25:39] you. It's a promise. The good shepherd,
[2:25:41] the great shepherd, the chief shepherd
[2:25:44] wants you to have it. And so we want to
[2:25:47] remember sister Lynette. She's asking
[2:25:50] the Lord to completely heal her. she
[2:25:53] sent that she needs a complete healing
[2:25:55] in her body. So let's bow as we close
[2:25:58] for prayer and close for these needs.
[2:26:00] And if you have a need in your life
[2:26:01] today, you want to be included in this
[2:26:04] prayer for healing, for deliverance, for
[2:26:06] the Holy Ghost. And for those precious
[2:26:10] ones that rededicated your life to the
[2:26:13] Lord today and tonight, oh, may you ever
[2:26:17] continue forward, Father. all these
[2:26:20] hands that are raised and these hearts
[2:26:22] responding to the message they heard
[2:26:25] tonight. Lord, as we pray once again to
[2:26:28] close this meeting, but we present
[2:26:31] Sister Lynette Blevens at your throne of
[2:26:34] mercy and grace, knowing that you're the
[2:26:36] great healer, you're the doctor, Lord,
[2:26:40] and we know that you uh will touch and
[2:26:43] heal our sister. We believe that for her
[2:26:46] and for this surgery, for Sister Lori,
[2:26:50] she's going in. Lord, remember her also
[2:26:53] and the other requests that we have. So
[2:26:56] many, Lord, for these ones that need the
[2:26:59] Holy Ghost in their life. Lord, may they
[2:27:02] not ever sleep or let it go, but they'll
[2:27:05] stay with it like Jacob did. Wrestle all
[2:27:08] night long with the angel until you
[2:27:11] changed his name. He overcame. And Lord,
[2:27:14] may that be the promise and the blessing
[2:27:16] for every heart that's gathered here
[2:27:18] tonight. As we prepare to leave from
[2:27:20] here, may your Holy Spirit go with us.
[2:27:23] The sweet Holy Spirit go with us and be
[2:27:26] with us through the night. We sing these
[2:27:28] praises all through the night. And the
[2:27:31] angels of God around us encamping
[2:27:34] bringing the promises to pass. Lord,
[2:27:37] there be someone here that needs to stay
[2:27:39] even to pray and to meditate on these
[2:27:43] things. Lord, may they do that as we
[2:27:46] commit each one into your hands. Lord,
[2:27:48] as we close the meeting, bless brother
[2:27:50] Bill. Lord, strengthen him. And thank
[2:27:53] you, Lord, for the gift in his life
[2:27:55] tonight and encourage our hearts. Lord,
[2:27:58] we thank you for it. We thank you for
[2:28:01] these saints, Lord. This lovely church,
[2:28:03] the spiritual church. They love you.
[2:28:06] They're solid on the word, Lord. And we
[2:28:08] thank you for them. May they ever grow.
[2:28:11] May we ever grow in your grace and
[2:28:12] mercy.
[2:28:14] We pray in Jesus' name. And we love you.
[2:28:19] Amen. Amen. Your grace and mercy brought
[2:28:23] me through. We'll sing that. Your
[2:28:27] your grace and mercy
[2:28:31] seed
[2:28:34] brought me through.
[2:28:39] And I'm living
[2:28:42] this moment
[2:28:47] because of you.
[2:28:54] And I want to thank
[2:28:59] you
[2:29:01] and praise you too.
[2:29:05] Hallelujah.
