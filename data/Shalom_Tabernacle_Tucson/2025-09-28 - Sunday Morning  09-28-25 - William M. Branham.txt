[Music] [Music] [Music] stand of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be here today. We're thankful for the things that we're about to hear, Lord. Lord, all those that have gathered, we pray a blessing upon each and everyone. Lord, those that are on the way, Father, everything that would be done in this house of worship today, Father, let your hand, mighty hand and anointing, your presence be upon everything. Father, we'll give you all the praise and the glory. We're thankful, Lord, for future home, Lord, that here on earth that you're preparing for us, Lord, and also a place in heaven. So, we're grateful, Lord. And we commit this time to you now in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. We're going to be continuing with the uh future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride. We'll start at paragraph 298 and we'll end after 272 would be about 20 minutes. And of course this is from second Peter the whole chapter and revelation 21. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All things are possible. [Music] Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. You may be seated. Brother Brennan. &gt;&gt; Notice that Jesus said John 14. Now go and prepare a place. Oh, what will it look like? Did you ever think now bride what it will look like? It is prepared and designed by the divine architect. &gt;&gt; What will that city look like? Now, we're going to talk about it for a few minutes. The divine architect has prepared it. Designed it. &gt;&gt; And look, he's designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride. &gt;&gt; What's it going to look like? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able? how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch, just what she'd like. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the divine architect has designed the new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch. No wonder the apostle said, "Eye has not seen, ear is not heard, and neither has ever entered the heart of man." Let's see if we can probe into it just for a moment. &gt;&gt; See what it's going to look like. The divine architect has designed this for his beloved. See, oh what a place it must be when divine nature, a divine architect has a design it for a divine attribute that's been divinely predestinated by a divine God &gt;&gt; who is the author of divine life. &gt;&gt; What will that city look like? Think of it. Remember, it's not heaven. John say, "I saw it coming down out of heaven." &gt;&gt; It's to be on earth. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, not this earth's going to pass away. It's a redeemed earth. God didn't say he's going to raise up a new generation. He's going to redeem the one that's here. &gt;&gt; He ain't going to raise up a new generation. He redeems the one that's already here. &gt;&gt; He ain't going to make no new world. It's this one right here. is just going to burn it off. Cleanse it like he did you. His plans must forever remain. &gt;&gt; Now look, it's going to be remember it's going not to be heaven. It comes down from heaven. It's a dwelling place, a place to dwell in to take up his abode. Like u it was the John on the aisle of Patmasure in Revelation 21. He saw it descending. John saw the city descending from heaven like a dove like he seen here come God down upon his earthly tabernacle Jesus in a descending out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Jesus was baptized went straight way when he met the prophet. The word comes to the prophet and he was the word and the prophet is standing there denying all their denomination everything and when he seen the word the word come right to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet was so shocked he said I have need to be baptized of thee. Why come me? said, "Suffer to be so. For thus it is becoming to us, we know the message, to fulfill all rights. I am the sacrifice that must be washed." &gt;&gt; He suffered him. When he went up out of the water, he said, "I saw heavens open." &gt;&gt; The prophet saw it. &gt;&gt; He saw the heavens open. And here come descending out of heaven a form of a dove and a voice saying, "This is my part of the earth &gt;&gt; that I have redeemed. And from this part of the earth, I will redeem the rest of it. For he is my word made manifest. &gt;&gt; And the whole world I spoke it into existence by my word. Hebrews 11. &gt;&gt; And Satan's held it all this time, but I've come to redeem it. So much of it has made his body, and I'm coming to dwell in it. John said, "I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven &gt;&gt; as a bride adored for her husband. And where did it settle on?" Just exactly like it did on there up on the earth. Jesus was part of that earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon. Is that right? &gt;&gt; And remained up on him forever. &gt;&gt; It never can leave him. It's always that he and God are one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Always has to remain. And so John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending like a comet, a dove coming down out of heaven and settling up on a redeemed entire earth &gt;&gt; to do what? To claim every attribute &gt;&gt; that he made the earth for. &gt;&gt; Every man that was represented in the eternity and every woman is redeemed. She's been scarred and burned by fire. &gt;&gt; Jesus in his fiery temptations in the wilderness for 40 days. After that, notice it was ready for his ministry. Then think of it, the Holy Ghost descending upon earth, &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And that holy blood, &gt;&gt; I watch. I hope I don't go too deep for you. The holy blood that was created by God. The blood, &gt;&gt; the life, &gt;&gt; the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; You see it? &gt;&gt; God made in creation. &gt;&gt; He was spirit. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he's the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; How did it begin? In the wombs of a woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is why the woman is not like how them blind people can't see the serpent seed right here. &gt;&gt; See, Eve was put here on the earth and before Satan ever touched her or anything else, God said to him, "Multiply and replenish the earth." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But Satan comes in here. &gt;&gt; And if that was Adam's son, then were Adam was a direct descent from God. And you only take the nature of your parent. &gt;&gt; And when you're born again, you take the nature of your parent of heaven. &gt;&gt; And your parent of heaven is the attribute of the word &gt;&gt; or the word is the attribute of your parent. And how can you deny it for denomination? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I hope you don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; I know it's from God. Jesus. Here he comes descending. And there was Jesus, the attribute of God. Now the woman, she watch God said because it did this said, "I'll put enmity between your seed and the serpent's seed." Is that right? &gt;&gt; And the woman don't have any seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever think of that? That's right. &gt;&gt; She has a field. &gt;&gt; Not a seed. &gt;&gt; See, the serpent had already placed his seed there. &gt;&gt; Then if the woman doesn't have a seed, she has to remain to have a seed. And see, through the sexual intercourse here had brought from Satan the serpent, which was not a reptile, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; had legs because his legs went off of him. Is the most subtle, the only beast that would would coordinate with the woman. A beast seed won't do it now. Ain't nothing else. They've tried it. Won't work. &gt;&gt; See, the seed life of a male won't go into a female woman. It won't do it. But that was the closest thing. See, they can't find that species between a japanzee and a man. &gt;&gt; See, each one as it's evoluted up from the birds on up to donkeys and so forth up to a japanzee. Then there's a loss. That was a serpent, not a snake. Every form is lost from him because he was cursed. Now, God didn't curse Adam. He might have done the same thing, but he cursed the earth. thorns and thistles. He didn't curse Eve, but said Adam would be her ruler &gt;&gt; from now on. She ain't trying to preach or anything. Adam &gt;&gt; is her ruler &gt;&gt; and all the days of your life and in sorrow and you'll bring her life into the earth. But he said, "I'll put enmity between your seed." Now, she didn't have any seed. She never did have. &gt;&gt; So, she had to receive a seed from some way. &gt;&gt; God gave her a seed, &gt;&gt; not by sexual intercourse, but by creation. And can't you blind people see that's the seed of the serpent? &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; Satan got there before Adam. &gt;&gt; That was the seed. But she received a seed. What was it? God himself. &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; Now look, when Seth was born or Abel, he was a just man from his father. Seaith's the same way. Where' that evil fellow come from? &gt;&gt; Murder, liar. See? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See where it come from? It had to be a seed because he was a seed. Cain was a man. &gt;&gt; Oh, where's that blind people at? &gt;&gt; God of this world is blind. Well, no wonder Jesus said, "No man can see it." See, &gt;&gt; you say, "Why don't they see it?" Jesus said one time to his disciple, "It's given to you to know the kingdom of God, but not to them." That's the reason you come from 1500 mile square. See, it's given to you to know the kingdom. Look fellas, it's going to eat from South Africa and around this late hour when the bride is made up to go into the kingdom. I just don't have enough time. Notice watch now. Now, can you see the serpent seed there? See how it done? It's perfect. &gt;&gt; Now, some of them said like that guy in Tucson the other day trying he may listen to this tape, but if it is, man, I want to tell you something. When he said Eve said, here's where they go to. I've gotten a son from the Lord or a man from the Lord. Well, certainly God has a law. Look, you take a seed and plant it out here in a field where you sweet and you plant briars out there. I don't care. The same sun and the same rain brings that seed to life. &gt;&gt; God has a law &gt;&gt; and that law cannot be broken. I don't care if a if a the honorest woman in the town, the honorest man and unmarried and everything would have an an affair and live together and bring forth a child. That child would have to come by the law of God because you no other way. If you don't, you make Satan a creator then he's a god. &gt;&gt; How blind can you be? &gt;&gt; God's law certainly if you ever got a baby, I don't care if it was Esau, Jacob, whoever it was or any ill famed person if it was Judas that had to come by God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God has a law. The Bible said the sun shines on the just and the unjust. The rain falls on the just. Now Hebrews the 6th chapter and it says that the rain cometh off upon the earth to water and prepare it for what's dressed you know to make living. But thorns and thistles live by the same watermen &gt;&gt; same sunshine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For it's the law of God to ripen every seed to make every seed produce itself. So it had to produce the serpent seed. &gt;&gt; And it never hindered God. It fulfilled his complete plan. It made him a redeemer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Any blind would almost see that unless it's hid the god of the world is hid. It's just as plain as anything you can see. &gt;&gt; There you are. There's your serpent seed. Now notice, but Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God. Now, what does a woman do when the germ comes from the male segment? Now, deny that. The woman has no life in her at all. Amen. &gt;&gt; She only has a little egg, which is a field out here. Like you took a field and disc it all up and and put put a spray on it and sprayed all the germs out of it and nothing not even grass and nothing could grow in it and then you fertilize again, sew some good seed in there. If the enemy comes and sows some other seed, the same law of God will write in both seeds. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, God wasn't intended for that to be. See, but what happened? See the sperm from the male carries the hemoglobin which is the blood. In the blood is the life. &gt;&gt; And if you ever I've watched it in high breeding cattle and things like that, brother Shakar and I taking it through in the doctors and so forth watching high go in a chemist. See, then here comes the sperm from the female which is a bunch of eggs. Here comes the sperm from the male which is a bunch of germs. This hasn't got a bit of germ in it. &gt;&gt; It's only a byproduct of the man. That's how she got here in the first place. Amen. &gt;&gt; And she's only a field. There's a egg that's got the fertile ground for this life. &gt;&gt; And this life moves in and crawls. There's a mystery. How the maybe you say, "Well, the first one meets the rest of them dies." Well, how who determines it? Well, the first one will it be the one in front, the first egg in front, and the first germ? No. No. It might be one egg come back in the back and the middle of the sperm will come up a germ and go meet it. shows that some intelligence determines where it's going to be redheaded, blackheaded, where it's going to be little, big, male, or female. &gt;&gt; Hey, you can't you can't do nothing else about it. It won't work. You can mix them together and everything. It won't make a bit of difference. God determines it. &gt;&gt; After a while, one little germ will crawl into that field egg. What? They have the little tail like on it, twisting around, drops off, and there starts the spine of the baby. &gt;&gt; What is she then? She has no seed. She has a field to receive the seed. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the seed the enemy went forth while the good ser went forth sowing good seed and the enemy come behind him sowing corrupt seed. &gt;&gt; But the rain falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; The son it all has to grow. Jesus said let them grow together. &gt;&gt; At that day they'll be bundled the terriers &gt;&gt; and they're bundling now and big organizations going to the big bundle &gt;&gt; world council churches and what was in is to be burned. But the grains to be take to the gardener where they both live by the same thing, the same water, the same rain. &gt;&gt; A citrus tree that's a it's an orange tree will have to will bring forth on it if it's grafted into it a pomegrant. It'll bring forth a lemon. It'll bring forth a grapefruit. See, but it won't be an orange. But it's living off the same life that the orange tree is producing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Denominations have been injected into the vine because as they claim Christians, they live by it. K. Ephesus was, you know, what he was and yet he even prophesied. &gt;&gt; See, they live by it. Oh, I wish we could have a week and we just study this thing out, make it so clear. You You can't miss seeing it. Now, I'm going to admit some of these things. Now, watch. Look. them hands designed this for his beloved and bride designs and tenderly love for his bride. Remember that the Holy Ghost descended on Jesus which Jesus was a part of the earth. Why? The germ of God, the life of God was designed in the womb of a woman. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Which was the earth. All right. And then the life of God came in. So he was the beginning of the creation of God. See, and then that blood of God that was that by that germ when it was shed at Calvary, dropped back upon the earth. What for? To redeem the earth. &gt;&gt; Now it's been justified. It's been sanctified, called and cleaned. And now it's to receive its baptism of fire and be cleansed for Jesus and his bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are these other parts that's drawn out of this earth, &gt;&gt; the earth. You're a part of the earth, your body. Your soul is part of God, an attribute of God displayed here on earth in a body. The body is to be redeemed. Now the soul's redeemed because it was in sin. So God come down by a process of justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you being part of the earth, it's redeemed by it. You're in the process now. It's growing on. Your body was justified under Noah's baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. And your flesh when it dropped up on there and the earth is to be cleansed by fire, the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, a dwelling place for Christ and his bride, the new Jerusalem. Watch this city earth take up its abode on earth. Now you can plainly see as I said the this change the earth must be changed. You cannot have it like this. The church could not go, the world could not go right on after the millennium without being changed. See, to have such a place in it, it'll have to be changed. Just like uh we must be changed by his holy fire to condition and make a place for him to be contained within us. That is the Holy Ghost. Notice now there'll be plenty of room in the new earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, plenty of room. It'll be renovated. That's true by far. But there'll be no more sea. &gt;&gt; Notice the city is 1,500 miles square. &gt;&gt; Now listen real close while we draw these dimensions. I want to raise the blackboard just a moment. &gt;&gt; Here's a deep revelation from God. None of these other I'll bring the rest of this up the Lord willing. Notice now the earth is we turn over into the book of revelations. You can see how he measured it by the cubits and by the furlongs 2300. So now we find out that the city is measured 1500 miles square. You know how far that would reach? I measured it off this week. It would reach from Maine to Florida. and from the eastern seabboard to 600 miles of path west of the Mississippi. &gt;&gt; In other words, half of the United States just for the city. &gt;&gt; You say there ain't no room. When the sea's gone, there will be cost four fifths of it in water. &gt;&gt; Is that right? The explosion dries up the sea. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Erupts the earth. Oh my. Remember 1,500 miles square. What a city. &gt;&gt; And but remember the sea's gone. And the breadth and the height are the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would make it 1,500 miles this way, 1,500 miles that way, 1500 miles the length by the breadth, by the height. &gt;&gt; 1,500 miles. &gt;&gt; Think of it. Transparent goal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the city had a wall around it. &gt;&gt; Now, now that doesn't necessarily mean by being equal, it said and the walls and the foundation were equal. That doesn't necessarily mean that it's a cube or square. There is another geographical measure that the dimensions are the same. That is a pyramid. Four square l four square and the walls are the same. Let me draw it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, red. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to get into this thing as sure as a world. Notice the dimensions of this angle is exactly the same. All of them length by the by the height. There's another measure, the pyramid that proves it. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

Amazing grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay. Amen. God bless you this morning. We're so glad to have each of you out to the house of the Lord. If you'll stand with me, we want to bless the saints at home, those streaming, those in Phoenix Mesa this morning. God richly bless you. Amen. We'll go to the key of F.

Great you'll be rewarded for your service here. So keep on the firing line. You must fight. Be brave against all evil. Never run for even lag behind. If you would win for God and the ride, just keep on the firing line. The last verse. When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be so glad to keep on the firing line. How we'll praise the Savior for the call we had. Keep on the fire in line. When we see the souls that we have helped to win, leading them to Jesus from the path of sin.

Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Are you walking in the blood of the lamb? Are you walking daily by the savior's side? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Do you rest each moment by the crucified? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Are you washed in the blood, in the snow cleansing blood of the lamb? [Music] Oh, are they white as snow? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Now, when the bridegroom cometh, will your robes be white? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Will your soul be ready for the manion bright? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? The next verse. Pay aside your garments that are stained with sin and be washed in the blood of the lamb. Here's a fountain flowing for the soul. A clean.

Knowing his destiny was the lonely hill of Galatha there to lay down his life for me. If that isn't love, the ocean is dry. There's no stars in the sky. And the sparrow can fly. [Music] If that isn't love, then heaven's a myth. [Music] There's no feeling like this. If that isn't love, [Music] Even in death he remember the thief hanging by his side.

You deserve the gloryy. One last time. Lord, you are worthy of it all. You are worthy of it all. For for you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the gloryy. Amen. When he reached down his hand for me, if we could get the words up to that, please. And feel free feel free to sing it with me. I know we all know it. Sang it here before. But it's a testimony. when he reached down his hand for me as my testimony. Well, once my soul was array from the heavenly way, then was rich and vile as could be. But my savior above, he gave me peace, joy, and love when he raised down his hand for me. I was nearing despair. Oh, and I was near in despair when he came to me there. And he showed me that I could be free. And then he lifted my feet. He gave me gloryy all complete when he reach down his hand for me. Oh, and when he reached down his hand for me, aren't you glad he reached down his hand? He had to reach a way down for me just for me. I was so lost and undone without God or his son. and he reached down his hand for me. And how my heart doth rejoice since I made him my choice. In the tempest [Music] to him I can flee and there to lean on his arm safe secure from my harm when he down his hand for me. Since he gave me peace. Well, since the Lord gave me peace, those heavenly joys never cease. And Lord, I give all my life unto thee. [Music] Guide my feet and hold my head with thee that I may stand for you. Reach down your hand for me. Sing it out to him now. when he reached and when he raised down his hand for me. Oh, he had to reach away down for me. [Music] I was so lost and undone without God or his son when he reached down his head just for me. [Music] Oh, when the Savior reached down for me, he had to reach a way down for me. I was so lost and undone without God or his son when he reached down his hand just for me. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. Where would any of us be without that precious hand reaching down? If you'll stand with me this morning, we'll go ahead and take our prayer request before the Lord. If the brothers would come and pray to you saying it's good to be in church with each one of you this morning for our Sunday Sunday school we had 10 children, nine Bibles and $3 in offerings.

[Music] There's a lighthouse on a hillside that overlooks life seas. When I'm tossed, it sends out a light. that I might see. And the light that shines in darkness now will safely lead me home. If it wasn't for the lighthouse, [Music] my ship would sail no more. And I thank God for the lighthouse. I owe my life to him. Oh Jesus is the lighthouse. [Music] I'm safe from the rocks of sin. He has shown a light around me that I might clearly see. If it wasn't for the lighthouse, tell me where would this ship be? [Music] Everybody that lives around us sits here that high house down. The big ships don't sail this way anymore. There's no use of it standing around. Then my mind goes back to that stormy night where just in time. Oh, I saw the light was the light from that old lighthouse. It stands up there on the hill. And I thank God for the lighthouse. I owe my life to him. King Jesus is the lighthouse. And from the rocks of sin, he has shown his light around me that I might clearly see. If it wasn't for the lighthouse, tell me where would this ship be? And I thank God for the lighthouse. How I owe my life to him. Oh Jesus is the lighthouse. [Music] I'm safe from the rocks of sin. He has shown his light around me. Oh that I might clearly see. If it wasn't for the lighthouse, tell me where would this ship be? Amen. We'll go ahead and change the order of our service this morning. We'll continue to sing that chorus. Brother Joe Galatee, if you'll come. And I thank God for the lighthouse. I owe my life to him. Oh Jesus is the lighthouse. I'm safe from the rocks of sin. He has shown his light around me. [Music] Amen. God bless everyone. Looking forward to brother Israel being here for the evening service at 5. Sends his greetings of course and we pray God bless the his ministry there in Mesa. Today we're going to be listen to listening to Elijah and the meal offering 1960 Madison Square Garden in Phoenix and be about 59 minutes 1 hour and I know it'll be a blessing to everyone. Amen. God bless you all. Oh, isn't that true? Lord, I receive. &gt;&gt; Receive what? Every promise that he made, it's mine. Now before we are seated, let us bow our heads just a moment so that I won't forget to pray over these handkerchiefs here. Our Lord, we are grateful to thee tonight &gt;&gt; for the songs of Zion for the oldfashioned gospel that cleanses our hearts from evil. &gt;&gt; Yes. And for the most gracious promises in the Bible is ours. By faith we receive them. And we know that God is no respect of person. And in the generation that Paul lived in, the people so many were sick, they brought to him handkerchiefs, aprons, that he might uh put them on his body and then taken from his body to the sick and the afflicted. And the scriptures tell us that unclean spirits went out of the people and afflictions left them because of their faith in the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; God Paul has been gone for most 2,000 years into your presence. That generation passed with him, but you're God of every generation. Now the people tonight as believed on thee and we are committing to thee tonight these handkerchiefs and little parcels of goods and believing with all of our heart that you will answer our prayer and they shall be healed. &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord we send it to them for the glory of God in the name of Jesus his son. Amen. You may be seated. And those who put these up may come get them just immediately after this closing of the service. I am so happy. Uh tonight I've been out across the mountain there today as soon as I got through with the interviews that I had to have and went over to pray. And every time I get in this desert sun, it kind of makes me want to come back more. But one thing that I'm happy about tonight, my wife, as much as we have been together and she's seen the great visions of God manifested and come to pass, she was down at the river that day at Jeffersonville when the angel of the Lord made his first appearance that was packed on the Associated Press across the nation. It's been 1933. She was standing there but she heard the voice but didn't see the light or even the newspaper photographers saw the light but she was quite young then and about 12 years old and she never seen the light. She was watching the people. Many were fainting and it just stayed there just about one minute and then went right straight back up into the skies again. And the newspapers put a great article, mystic light appears over over a local Baptist minister while baptizing. Went all the way into Canada, got on the Canada Press. And then about three or four years ago when I was in Phoenix last, I believe it was brother Jack Moore was with me that he kind of my wife is very timid and so he called her to the platform unexpected and she liked to fainted and she come after I'd already gotten on the platform and the anointing was there for a healing service and she said first time she was ever in that presence. They're like that. And night before last, she saw him on the platform for the first time she's ever saw him. When it was here standing at the platform and when I met her outside, she would tears was in her eyes. And she said, "Billy, for the first time in my life, I saw it." She said, "I you was praying for a woman." And said, "I seen it just come right before." And stood there just a few moments, moved around where you was at. And then as soon as you stopped talking, it went away. So I'm happy for that that come before her eyes and that little lady has a lot to go through with and so I'm glad and happy for it. Now tomorrow night is healing service. You know we've been saying this week that healing services would come Friday night. I'll come tomorrow afternoon or or early in the evening about 6:00. So you want to interrupt the rest of the service and Billy, Leo, Jean, and Nam will be here with the prayer cards to give you a prayer card. That's when we bring the people on the platform and pray for them. Uh we are I am I have to carry the American meetings in the way the people has been taught laying on of hands. Now, that's that's scripture, but that's a Jewish tradition that isn't for the Gentiles. But the Gentiles carry it over. The Gentile was, "I'm not worthy that you come under my roof. Just speak the word, my servant live." That's right. But the Jew, come lay your hands upon my daughter and she'll live. See, that was their tradition. It was not for the Gentiles. Night after night and hour after hour through day and night, the Holy Spirit comes revealing or going through the buildings speaking the secrets of the hearts. You see it all the time. That's to let you know the presence of the Lord is here. Now, if you would just accept it, you get healed right then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz all the healing can ever be done for you is already finished. It has been for 1900 years. All the salvation that you'll ever receive has already been paid for. It's yours just to receive it. It's been 1,900 years or more since it was become salvation for you. But now you notice me on the meetings I say, will it make you believe? See, signs and wonders are not for healing or salvation, but it's to let the people realize and understand that the presence of God is here. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he if he how it would be it's more of a miracle. We are simply just now beginning to see miracles. Now when it comes to a person they've been several of them get up off stretchers and wheelchairs and things and go out. That's not exactly a miracle. No. See, even Christian science has that it could be a a a mental condition that you could be change your way of thinking. Now, we don't believe it was because I believe it was faith. But yet, I was at La Salerain's France. I was at Paris and I went down to a place where they had a dead woman laying in there. She's buried. And they rubbed the rock there and people went in there with crippled crutches and laid them down and walked away from rubbing that rock over that dead woman. And she's dead and she can no more intercede that there's only one mediator between God and man, and that's Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Coming out of a Catholic family, I I know that they believe in the people that die that that's their spirits are interceding for them. different ones. Some for politics and some for other things. To me, it's spiritualism. I ain't hurting your feelings. I hope &gt;&gt; but I must be honest. &gt;&gt; See, anything that intercedes with the dead is spiritualism. They asked me that in Mexico. He said, "What about Jesus?" I said, "He's not dead. He raised again. He's alive forever more." See, he isn't dead. He's a living. The rest of them is passed beyond which the scripture says that they that are there cannot come here, and these that are here cannot go there. No man has ever crossed or ever will. So that settles it if the Jesus said so. But we find these things uh operating. So now in each night the Holy Spirit is trying to get to you the presence of his being here, &gt;&gt; not the presence of a man. A man can only humble himself by a gift. He can submit himself into a certain realm of the spirit that can open God to you. But it will never work until you yourself believe it and accept it and then it works. See, if you'd sit there and every one of you, every one of you be disbelieving, don't believe a word of it, it would never work. Jesus, when he went to his own company, his own country, many mighty works he could not do because of their unbelief. And if he could not do it then, he cannot do it now because of unbelief. See, it's your faith. So it takes you and I together with the Holy Spirit to bring these things to pass to let me rejoice to let you rejoice that God is here that keeps his word. But when the Holy Spirit can come into the meeting fulfilling exactly to the scripture what he said would take place in the last days and go out over the audience like he did when he was here and discern the very secrets of the hearts and the thoughts of the intents of the heart and the mind. How could anyone doubt? There's a perfect miracle. More of a miracle than a walking cuz it's impossible for that to happen without spiritual power. &gt;&gt; It has to be a spiritual power to do that. So then you see just exactly what the Bible promised and what they what we believe. It's more of a miracle than shouting. It's more of a miracle than speaking with tongues. Paul said so. Even genuine Holy Spirit gives us speaking in tongues. It's more of a miracle than that. We're on the last miracle. It's predicted that way by the Bible. So tonight, you don't have to wait till tomorrow night to come through the line to be laid hands on. Now, laying hands on you will not do no more than the discerning of the thoughts of the heart. Not as much to me. Then you can just receive it. Hold on to it. It's yours. You believe it with all your heart. But tomorrow night if you the scripture does say go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them that believe all the signs then at last he said if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that's true lay the that will follow the believers all right now we we are believers so that way we have night after night of laying hands on the sick and God has worked great miracles with them we've had great miracles with praying over the handkerchief We've had great miracles with the discerning of the thoughts of the heart. See, all of it together works to God's glory. &gt;&gt; It isn't for man. It isn't for church. It's for God's glory. God's glory. Now, before we open the word now, for the night, oh, we can turn back the pages like this. But God has to open it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the scripture is no private interpretation. But the Holy Spirit that wrote the scripture is the interpretator thereof. So let us bow our heads now while we pray. And how many would like to be remembered in the prayer? Would you just let it be known by your hands lifted? Whatever it is, oh God, look, we all need, don't we? I'm needy, too, friends. I got my hands up. Heavenly Father, humbly and quietly and reverently we come into thy great august presence, knowing before that one thing happens, you are here because you promised to be. You said before you're going away, wherever that two or three are gathered in my name, there I'll be in their midst. And if they shall agree upon any single thing as touching one thing, ask they shall receive. Lord, to bring your promise to this the purchase of thy blood, I ask that every man, woman, or child that raise their hands tonight, you know their heart. May they receive what they're asking for. Granted, Lord, we are a needy people. We're walking in a dark world with a great enemy of yours that we could not combat with him at all if it wasn't for your Holy Spirit. Therefore, we are trusting, believing, and acting in faith that he'll go before us and make the way clear. So many pitfalls along the road set for our weary feet. But we are trying to follow the bloody footprints of him who overcome death, hell, and the grave. Guide us tonight by thy holy spirit, Lord, to the words that should be said. Then guide the words to the heart that is needy of them. Then Lord may at the end of the meeting and we start to our different homes may we be able to say again like those who came from Emmas did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way for we ask it in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen. To you who are keeping down the scriptures, turn with me now to the book of first kings. I wish to read a portion out of the 17th verse, 17th chapter rather. Now I'm going to begin at the 14th verse. Read the 14th, 15th, and 16th verses of the 17th chapter of First Kings. For thus saeth the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cru of all fail until the day the Lord sent rain upon the earth. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah. And she and he and her house did eat many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruc of all fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah. It must have been almost daylight when she was awakened. She turned her weary head on the pillow when she heard a mournful little cry across the room. And she had not been able to sleep. All night she was tossed about because of this great tragedy. The little boy had waken again not being asleep over 20 or 30 minutes. And I can hear his little boy say, "Mama, won't you go out and look in the pantry again and see if there isn't just one little piece of bread? I'm so hungry. I just can't sleep. And as she looked in his little face with the his little sanking cheeks and his little eyes turning yellow, his long hair hanging down from failing to be cut, his little ragged night shirt, the big tears from her eyes spat up on his little face. as she patted him on the cheek and said, "Darling, try to go to sleep and understand." There had been three years. There had been no rain on the earth. She knelt down on the floor. I can see her as she cried out to God. She said, "Oh Lord God, uh Jehovah, thou art the God of our fathers, who has fed thy children and cared for them through the years. And I've tried to live true and upright to thee, and now I am here seeing my little boy crying for something to eat and nothing to give him. For many weeks now, we've been louning ourselves up to a place of one meal every three or four days. And now it's all gone but one little handful of meal and just a spoonful of oil. And I'm trying to hold it off until daylight that we'll not have to die while it is in the night. What have I done? Oh God, I your hands made has lived true. My husband was lost in battle the battle for the Lord. And I've been a widow for several years now. and I've tried to live right and keep your commandments. And if it's my time to go, I don't mind. But my little boy, it just tears my heart to pieces to hear him beg for something to eat with nothing to give me. When she got finished praying, she raised up. He'd gone back to sleep again for a few moments and she had her arms up and the ragged night gown that she was wearing was just about gone. She goes to the window and looks out and it's just about to break day. Oh, it was so hot. The hot winds of judgment was blowing upon a nation that had forgotten God. That was during the reign of Ahab, Israel's most cruel and wicked king. And he married a sinner, Jezebel, which was an idoltor. And a mixed wedding like that never is successful. &gt;&gt; It just can't be. Either the woman will come the man's way or the man will go the woman's way. And she was a very attractive little woman. And Ahab just kind of a lukewarm believer had give in to her ideas and said, "Oh, well, religion is nothing for me. I'm a king." And long had they tore down the altars of God and put up the altars of Balum or Baal rather. And the cry had been so much against the true religion till the ministers under the great strain had given away. Some time ago I made a remark about ministers or something other in this day and a group met me and said brother Brandham our congregations just pulls on to us. That's what causes it. The congregation will walk out if the minister don't please them. And so long had the ministers fell under the impact of the king because sin was permitted. There was no limits. It's a very good picture of today. Because the nation had endorsed these things. The people wanted to be popular. They thought as long as the nation said so, it was all right. That's the way they say today. &gt;&gt; As long as the nation says it's all right to sell beer, then it's all right to drink it. If the nation permits our women to half-dress on the street, the law won't run them in, but it's all right to do it. That might be all right to the nation, but in God's great books, you're responsible and will have to answer before God. But they had fallen, had to give away under the load. And the nation was prospering and they thought that prosperity was a sign that God was with them. That's not altogether the truth. God comes to you. Use an old proverb, God dishonoring proverb that says that God helps those who help themselves. That's dishonorable to God. &gt;&gt; God helps those who cannot help themselves. &gt;&gt; He is a God of those who needs mercy &gt;&gt; and he is a merciful God. God. &gt;&gt; And that proverb that says that he helps those who help themselves. If you can help yourself, you don't need his help. &gt;&gt; But he helps those who cannot help themselves. But the nation had thought as long as they were eating good and were well clothed that everything would be all right. But there was one who still was oldfashioned that believed that there was a God that was oldfashioned. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Believe that there was a God that kept his word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Believed that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was holy and required re complete surrender to his holiness. &gt;&gt; But Jezebel and her modernistic crew hated him. He was their pastor, but they didn't believe it. So, he had to hide for his life. And God had sent him up on the mountain and said, give him a message and said, "Go down and tell that old wicked king, thus saith the Lord, it's not going to rain or even to do a fall until you call for it." give it into Elisha's mouth to call for the rain when it was time for it. But he had the keys of heaven. He could close it or open it. And he said, "I want you to go up out of the wilderness of this into the wilderness rather out of this chaos. Get out from among them. You preach to them and they won't listen to you and they're continually getting worse. Go on up into the wilderness and they're set down by the brook Cherith and I already commanded the ravens to take care of you. Oh, &gt;&gt; if the people walk, God's got crows that can do it. &gt;&gt; John said God's able of these stones to rise children unto Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "If they hold their piece of rocks will immediately cry out, God can do what he wants to." He said, "I've commanded the ravens and they're going to feed you." And they brought him flesh and bread. Someone said one time, "Where did they get it, Brother Brandham?" I said, "I don't know. The only thing I know they brought it." Amen. &gt;&gt; They got it from the same place that Jesus did when he took five fish and or five biscuits and two fish and fed 5 thousands. &gt;&gt; It come from the same creative hand of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; They brought him fish and bread. The crows sat down and handed over to Elisha and he ate it and stooped down and drank from the fountain. God was resting his prophet. Oh, I'm so glad that God has a way of escape. &gt;&gt; And when they thought he was crazy, that old prophet, an old killjoy, always trying to take the joy out of their little happy parties they were having, tell them it was sin. And God him following God's commission went up into the mountains and sat down on the high place, the driest place in the country. But God kept the brook running &gt;&gt; and they were down there knowing their tongue for water. You know, God has a way of answering prayers. This little woman had lived true. &gt;&gt; She had not remarried again. She was staying single to meet her husband in glory. She was an honorable woman. And for weeks the barrel had been going down, down and her continually praying and still looked like there was no hope in sight, nowhere. You know there we can get a lesson from that that if you have prayed and met all the requirements that God requires you to meet and still is silent. He doesn't say anything and yet you've met the requirements. Now what happens then? If you know that you have met his requirements and you've done all that you know to do, then faith doesn't waver. It just sits still and thinks positive. &gt;&gt; Faith takes its everlasting grip around the rock of ages &gt;&gt; and doesn't move. That great fella called faith. I've often said faith's got hair on the chest. When he speaks, everything else shuts up. &gt;&gt; When faith says shut up, then everything stops cuz he's the boss. And she had met every requirement. She'd live clean. She lived decent. She lived honorable. And she had met all of God's requirements. but looked like he was silent. God does that sometime to test you to see what kind of a reaction you'll have. &gt;&gt; Don't forget it. You pass over the platform, you're prayed for and hands laid on you, seems like nothing happens. That doesn't stop faith one bit. &gt;&gt; You have met God's requirements. Now if you have met them now if you're holding back on God you know your heart condemns you and we know if our heart condemns us not then we have &gt;&gt; now but if our heart condemns us there's no need of coming across the platform &gt;&gt; there's no need of asking God for anything because you don't have faith to receive it &gt;&gt; but when you have met every requirement that God requires then faith steps out there and said God is God. I've met the requirements. The scripture says, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. &gt;&gt; They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. Walk and not faint." As the song says, "Teach me Lord." Oh, teach me Lord how to wait. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Get my soul washed in the blood of Calvary. meet every requirement. Burn all the bridges around and say now Lord nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I claim. You promised it Lord. That's the kind of condition the reason people think that I'm an isolationist. But in the room or over on the side of the desert, that's a condition you've got to get into before you walk into this pulpit year. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Satan's always dropping in little imps to try to upset something. And you must be right holding on to the cross, not trusting your own ability, your own thoughts, just leaning on the everlasting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Claiming no intelligence, claiming no mind or your own. You're just opening yourself and let the Holy Spirit speak. &gt;&gt; That's the condition God wants his church in. &gt;&gt; Getting that condition. God tries you. Every son that cometh to God must first be tried, chasened to see if he can stand chastisement. If we walk up and say, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God." That he died for my sins and rose again the third day, he was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, the chast of my pieces upon him, and with his stripes I am healed. When you say that with a confessed all your sins and your iniquities and your abilities and all that you have lay on the altar, then there with nothing in your arm, Satan's going to shoot every dart at you he can. &gt;&gt; But then if you turn aside from that and say, "Well, maybe I didn't get saved. Maybe I didn't get healed." Then turn away from that. The Bible said you are illegitimate children and not the children of God. God test every son of Abraham like he did Abraham for we are Abraham's seed by being dead in Christ. We are Abraham's seed and are hes according to the promise. &gt;&gt; Abraham's seed. That's the spirit that Abraham had. He had the promise given in him. Our father trusted God and took a promise and impossibility and held on to it for 25 years before it was ever manifested. Getting stronger all the time. His seed just like the father. No matter what happens when we're prayed for, it's settled. When we get everything out of the way, met all requirements, get everything out of the way, then ask God, and stand there knowing you're going to receive it. God tested Job like that. When Job asked for mercy, offered a sacrifice for his children, the only thing that that prophet had was a burnt offering, but that was all God required. God doesn't require education and a lot of nonsense. He requires a surrendered heart to his will. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He doesn't ask you to dress in a certain way or or go to certain things or to out of certain colleges or degrees. He asked for a humble contrite broken spirit and a willing heart to receive him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He tried Job and see what kind of a reaction he would find in him. But when he took his sheep and tuck his ox and tuck his camels and tuck his children, I'll see what Job says now. And he said, "The Lord gave and the Lord taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; He found what he had told Satan he had in Job. none like him on the earth. Then the thunders begin to roar, the lightnings begin to flash, the spirit come upon the prophet. And he screamed, "I know my redeemer liveth." &gt;&gt; And at the last days he'll stand on the earth. Though the skin worms destroys this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself, mine eye shall behold and not another. He tested the Hebrew children to see what kind of a reaction they had had. They had confessed among the heathens that there was a living God. There was a Jehovah God and that he was God of heaven and God of earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he held every soul in his hand. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; So God let them be tested. And they had met all the requirements. said prayed up and got everything out of the way and they would not bow down to the king's image and he had the furnace seven times hotter than it ever was. I no doubt that Satan was trying to tell them this is the end of the road. I like the way they thought our God is able to deliver us from that fiery furnace. But nevertheless, if he does not, we'll not break God's commandments. We'll stay true. &gt;&gt; Let our faith ring out through the years to come. &gt;&gt; That we stayed true to the promise of God. &gt;&gt; My God is able to heal me from this or my God's able to take me from this wheelchair. My God's able to do this. But I've accepted him as my healer. I've confessed my sins, my unbelief, and confessed that I believe that he is my healer. Let come, let go what may. If I'm not well today, I will be tomorrow. If I'm not tomorrow, I'll be next year. The Lord gave in the Lord take it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; There it was. And when they walked into the fiery furnace under trial, under a test, they held true to the end. But God was there just in a spare of a moment &gt;&gt; and he delivered them. They know that they were prayed up. Their sins were confessed. They know they met every requirement. And yet he seemed to be silent. He's only silent to test you to see really what you are. What's on the inside of you? See if you really mean from your heart what you're saying with your lips. &gt;&gt; Let that go deep. We can say with our lips, but is our heart saying now when this little woman know that she had met all these requirements and still God was silent. Seemed like he didn't even care for it. He didn't care where she lived or died. But all the time God was working. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; She didn't know about it. But God told Elijah he'd dry up the brook, reached out his hand and stopped the brook from running. And Elijah said, "Lord, why did it stop?" He said, "I've commanded a widow woman to feed you." &gt;&gt; He had already commanded her. She didn't know it. He might have commanded of you a testimony of your healing. You might not know it, but just hang on. When you are sure that you met all the requirements, when you know that you've done everything that you know to do and laid yourself before God, there's only one thing to do is hang on to his promised land. &gt;&gt; Stay there. God promised to answer. He'll do it. You don't know what he's commanded, what angel, or what to do. It may be this night before the healing service starts tomorrow night. God might have seen your condition today. He might have heard your prayer. I felt so sorry for these deaf and dumb people. I want to lay hands on them and pray for them. Started to stop last night, but I said that wouldn't be right to the rest of them. But how do I know that somewhere in a silent God who knows the heart, these people has met their requirement of God and they're ready? There's an angel here tonight to deliver them from all their affliction. &gt;&gt; How do I know God might have commanded their deliverance tonight? &gt;&gt; Whether I prayed for the sick or not, they'll get it because God has required it. &gt;&gt; Be sure of God. Then hold on. &gt;&gt; Meet his requirements. God knows how to do things that's right. Knows how to do it in the right way. Now, it's a very strange thing that God would send his prophet to a widow woman's house. What a place. But she must have been a real virtuous woman or he had never sent his prophet there. Oh, if a person was worthy, would have to be a worthy person to entertain a man like Elijah. You remember it was Zachariah in his house and he had been loyal and true waiting for God to give them a child and the angel Gabriel come to the house. &gt;&gt; It was Virgin Mary who'd live clean and pure and waiting for a promise of God that he sent an angel to. &gt;&gt; Talk about run around with the world and flirt with the world and then expect to see angels and have miracles done. It's out of God's program. Amen. &gt;&gt; You must live right. Clean up the house. Clean up your habits. Clean up the things of the world. Get rid of your cards and your worldly association. Get ready. And then the angel of God can speak and say, "Fear not. It's I." Then things take place. But he the little woman was down praying, not knowing that walking down the mountain. Come the prophet. He'd had a vision. where to go to. God don't lead his people blindly. He tells them where they're going. &gt;&gt; He was looking into the city. Oh, it was terrible. People were starving to death and screaming for water. Hungry people. It's a reflection of immorality. It's a reflection of sin. And this nation's in part. You can't. The balance is even the law of nature. would not let it be when we're wake when we're wasting money with rowdiest living and half of the world starving to death. They're all human beings to which Christ died for. That's the reason the mission fields is on my heart. You have wonderful ministers here in Phoenix and all around over the United States and places churches on every corner. Great man of God healing services. great man like or Robertson, other great man preaching and there's people over yonder dying by the thousands every day that never heard of the name of Jesus. Poor little dirty hungry negroes way down in Africa and over in India, little fellas laying on the street dying don't even know what God means. &gt;&gt; Then we argue about our little differences of religious belief. Oh, it's not just exactly right, I don't think, friends, if it's on your heart to see that. Now, notice this poor little woman after she had looked out the window and saw that it was about to break day. Little did she know what was waiting for her. She was thinking it was death for her and her little boy. So I while she's asleep, let's just look at her for a few minutes. She goes after you, she prays and she strokes his little hair back out of his eyes and said, "Darling little fellow, you look so much like your precious sainted daddy. How he trusted God, how he gave his life for the cause of Israel out on the battlefield. And you look so much like him." And honey, I don't know why the innocent suffer with the guilty, but they do. this nation, Christians will suffer because of unrighteousness and politics. Make the whole nation suffer. Now, I can see her go in and say, "I'll fix the little cake now. I've got just enough for one little cake of of bread left, and when we eat it, then we'll die." So, she goes into the room and takes the meal out of the meal barrel. I can see her just dusting it with that little bony hand as she strikes across the little tag that it was in, beating it out, every bit of dust. And she finally got just enough for one cake, goes over to the little cru and holds it up and drains every bit of the oil out of it. About a spoonful. Now the meal, all those things has a meaning. Meal represented Christ. Christ was the meal offering. When they ground the meal for the wave offering for Christ, which was Christ in the wave offering in the Old Testament, they've ground it with a certain type of burr, that every little piece of meal must be cut just the same because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. You remember when some of the schools up there didn't know the difference between gourds and peas and throwed some wild gourds in a pottage of peas to cook. And they cried out, "There's death in the pot." Elijah got a handful of meal, cast it into the pot, and said, "Eat." What did the meal do? The meal in the pot changed it from death to life. &gt;&gt; From a deathgiving resource to a lifegiving resource. God. &gt;&gt; That's the same thing it is tonight. When there's death in your vessel, Christ thrown into your vessel. Raise you from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Christ makes the difference. &gt;&gt; Coming into the human heart. Oh, he gives a peace that passes understanding and also it gives life eternal. He that believeth on the son has eternal life and shall never perish. Now she got the meal which represented Christ and Christ is the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Christ the meal offering. Then she went and got the oral and the oral represents the spirit. So she put the word and the spirit together and begin to mix it up. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, something has to happen when that takes place. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let it be tonight that the word that I'm preaching falls into your heart. Then let the Holy Spirit get in there and go to mixing that up. Watch what takes place. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you put the word and the spirit together, Jesus said to the woman at the well, "Woman, I tell you the time is coming and now is when God requires worship in the spirit and in the truth and he is the truth." &gt;&gt; The meal, look what she did. She mixed the word and the spirit together. Many people had the spirit without the word. Some has the word without the spirit. But you take put them both correctly in their place. There's a cake on the road. &gt;&gt; There's something in the making. Poor little widow didn't know what she's doing. But God said to Elijah, "I have commanded her." And Elijah's on his road over the cobblestones coming down to see his vision fulfilled somewhere. And here she is standing there tears. She wiping with her old ragged sleeve and saying, "Oh Jehovah God, my faith has never failed and it won't fail." Somehow or another, I don't know how all this is, but we are taught that all things work together for the good. She's mixing this little meal up. She got the little cake all fixed out and patted up. She said, "Now it's time for me to go out and get some wood." She goes back and opens the door and said, "Oh Lord, that poor little hungry belly laying there and I haven't eaten for two or three weeks. I'll give him my piece of cake." That's a mother. A mother's love for her baby. There's nothing like it. Only God's love. &gt;&gt; A mother may forget her sucking bait, but never can I forget you. Your names are engraved on the palms of my hands. How can he forget you? I'll never forsake thee or never leave thee. I'll be with thee always, even to the end of the world. There she looks at her baby. Maybe she slipped back and kissed his little forehead. Whether she fainted and died on the outside, she goes out. It's just beginning to kind of sun begin to rise over the Judeian hills. And she looks at the sun begin to peep up way down the street. She hears cursing and going on. And she goes out in the yard and noticed she picked up two sticks. Not an arm load. Two sticks. What is it? The cross. Now anyone knows any of my Indian friends here know or any hunter the correct way of making a fire to last is cross two sticks two logs light it right in the middle just keep pushing the ends in it'll last all night many time have I laid in the wilderness with two sticks no bigger than that and keep warm all night just enough to keep warm keep it going right in the center of it now what's she going to do light these two sticks and the Word and the spirit is brought to self-sacrifice on the cross, ready for duty, ready for life, putting the word and the spirit. That's her faith in the word of God by the Holy Ghost leading herself to sacrifice anything else to the cross. And when she got the stick under her arm, two of them, and started back, she started back. And there was a voice came from the gate. Lady, just before that, an old maybe baldheaded and gray hanging over his whiskers and his hair hanging down, a little stick in his hand, an old sheep skin or something wrapped around him, walking down the street saying, "Lord, it's a certain little white fence. There'll be a lovely looking young woman. She must have been young. The boy was young out in the yard. You told me that was the widow that was to feed me. Now, where is she at? I'll keep walking. The spirit leads him this way, then turns him. Oh, it's so wonderful. Sons of God are led by the spirit of God. No matter how silly it sounds, they are led. &gt;&gt; She go he goes down one street and up another. Down one street and up another. After a while, the spirit said, "Look to your right." And he looks it around like that just like he does here at the platform night after night. &gt;&gt; Oh, God's still the same. &gt;&gt; Look to your right, to your left. There's someone praying who needs it. And he looked to his right and say, "There's a little white fence. That's just right. I just won't move from here because there's the old tree standing there. There's everything just the way I saw in the vision." The door opens. A little thin woman comes out. Now remember, she's just going to pick up two sticks. She couldn't have picked up three. Takes two to make the cross. She picked up two sticks and put her on her arm. And she started back thinking, I'll have the little cake done when Sunny wakes up. And then I'll feed it to him. I won't eat any myself now. I'll put my little boy in my arms and there will sit and die. And she started into the house. She heard a strange voice across the gate said, "Woman, would you fetch me a little drink of water in a vessel?" And she turned and she thought, "There stands a kind old man at the gate." She looked at him real close and maybe wiped the tears from her eyes. It was quite early yet, you know, God does so strange. She was willing to sacrifice. Water was a scarce thing and hadn't rained for three years and six months. Would you fetch me? Maybe God told him to say that. See what she would do. Trying her reaction. Would you fetch me just a little drink of water in a vessel? And she looked at him. He sounds different. There's something about the old man that I feel sorry for. Any believer in God will share to the very limit with another one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's one thing about Pentecostal people. They'll give the shirt off of their back for the cause. That's right. It's the truth. That's great thing. One of the great things with them. They are the greatest givers in the world because they know that this earthly goods mounts to nothing. They lay their treasures up in heaven because we're going up there some of these days. And so this woman, she said, "I'll just share my water. We're going to die. So I'll sacrifice my drink of water, give it to the kind old gentleman standing there because he looks thirsty and tired." She said, "I will bring it." And she started walking on. And again she heard a voice said, "And in your other hand, would you f me a little marshall of bread?" Oh my. Now, now what? her last hope of the life of her child. The last hope that they had and the bread would be gone, the oral gone, everything would be gone now. But she looked back and she wondered, she said, "I just have a little bit of meal left in a barrel. I've got just enough oil that I've dampened it and I've already dressed it or I've mixed it. I've got the word and the spirit mixed together in there. I've got the cross shirt to lay it up on to make it into a cake to give life. That's when the spirit and the word gets together on the cross. It makes a life loaf for you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I've got it together and I'm going in now to bake it and give my little dying boy in there that's crying all night for something to eat. I' I've got to give it to him. I'm going to sacrifice mine and I I'm going to give it to him and then I'll take him up my arms and we'll both wait for death. He said, "But you make me a little one first." Isn't that strange that a man would ask to widow woman dying for the last bit of meal she had in the house with a dying child? God does things so strange. Said, "Make me a little one first." She studied. You know, the Bible says that we have entertained strangers. We've entertained strangers. They were angels, not knowing what we were doing. Well, she said, "I'll do it." And as she turned, he said, "For Oh, there it was." The greatest consolation that any believer ever listened to. For thus sayaeth the Lord. That's the word she was waiting for. Thus sayaeth the Lord, the barrel will not go empty, neither will the cru go dry until the day that God sends rain on the earth. &gt;&gt; What do we get there? Seek ye first &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God and his righteousness. &gt;&gt; All other things will be added. &gt;&gt; How do I know, brother Brandham? How do I know? Only thing I know, put God first and move on. sacrifice. Mix the oral. Mix the the word and the spirit together and lay yourself upon the cross and say, "Here I am, Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put God first in everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For thus saith the Lord. The cru will not run dry, neither will the barrel go empty until the day that the Lord God sends rain upon the earth. She knowed then that was a prophet of God speaking to her. Oh, how her heart must have jumped. She ran in and made that little cake and brought it to him with the water trembling hands over that old sunken cheeks. She knew that God had come to the rescue &gt;&gt; over a little piece of bread. Oh, you just take that one little promise of God and get everything right and out of the way. Watch what takes place. &gt;&gt; Get that heart, the unbelief away from it. Just take that little belief that you got and lay it on to the cross and say, "This is all I got, Lord. Take it. What's the turn? Thus sayaith the Lord. Oh, he's just the same today as he ever was. &gt;&gt; That's what she was waiting for. Maybe it looks awful dark now. But you know, sometimes we're taught I preached on it the other night. It's always darkest before day. It's at the darkest hour of the night when the morning star shines. It's reflecting the coming of the sun. In Germany, they got a picture. They call it the cloud picture. It's it's a competitive to this great picture of the crucifixion at the at far salon in Los Angeles. The great picture is as wide as this building is a cross. They had to build a building around the picture. Many of you have seen it. But this in Germany is called the angel or the cloud day I believe it's called. And when you get off from a piece from it and look at it, oh, it looks hideous. Looks like angry clouds are mixing around one another like that as the lights reflect on it and look like the clouds are moving as the way the picture is made to reflect the lights makes it look like the cloud an angry storm coming to tear up everything. And then you're told by the guide, walk closer and just keep watching it. And when you get real close to it, it isn't clouds. It's angels wings of eaten together rejoicing. It's a blessing in disguisement. Maybe your sickness tonight. Maybe your sacrifice to come out here was just a blessing in disguisement. The angels of God are here present to join their wings together and rejoice because it's written in the scripture that the angels of heaven rejoice when one sinner repents. &gt;&gt; Think on that. For thus saith the Lord, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. His grace cannot be exhausted, and he's willing to give to you anything your hearts desire. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all stand. Amen. We'll go to the key of F. That last line, he's willing to give you anything your hearts desire. Oh, what a way to finish that quote. Ain't God good to give us so many blessings undeserving. That's why we are. We ought to thank him. Love and praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow. Well, ain't God good to give us so many blessings undeserving? That's what we are. We ought to thank him. Love and praise him more today and a whole lot more tomorrow. Ain't he so good? Ain't God good to give us so many blessings undeserving. [Music] That's why we are. &gt;&gt; Oh, love and praise him a little more today and a whole lot more tomorrow. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weary. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. [Music] Well, teach me Lord to wait down on my knees till you're on good time. You answer my please. Teach me not to rely. Oh, what others do, but to wait in prayer for an answer from you. The last verse. Teach me Lord to wait while hearts are a flame. Help me humble. my cry and call on your name. Keep my faith renewed. Keep my eyes on me. Help me be on this earth what you want me to be. And they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. [Music] They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Oh, teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Amen. God bless you richly so much this uh this morning. We're glad to have each of you with us once again. If uh we'll have service again tonight at 5:00 pm, all are welcome to that. Uh we will let's go ahead and just bow our heads and for a word of prayer. Precious Lord Jesus. Father God, we thank you for the word that came forth this morning. Lord, we know it was anointed, Father. So we pray that you soften our hearts that we can receive it, Lord, and we can grow and Lord, become more like you, Lord, as we just get ready for this great rapture that's coming, Lord, any day now, Lord. We're trusting you, Lord. We can't see how this world could get much worse, Father, without you coming back, Lord. Oh, granted, Jesus. Lord, as we leave here this morning, we pray for your hand of mercy upon each and every one of us, Father, and you'll return us back this afternoon, Lord, to hear more of what you have to say to us. If it be thy will, Father. Lord, we thank you for letting us join together once again, Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord. We can't wait to gather back. And it's in Jesus name that we pray. Amen. You are dismissed this morning. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. They that wait. They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings as an eagle. They shall run and not be weery. They shall walk and not faint. Teach me Lord. Teach me Lord to wait. Let's go to the key of G. You know the verses for through the fire. So, so many times I've questioned circumstances, things I could not understand. [Music] Many times my trials, weakness blurred my vision. My frustration gets so out of here. [Music] Then I am reminded [Music] every second. I've never had to stand one test alone. As I look at all the victories, the spirit rises up in me. Through the fire, my weakness is made strong. He never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered us victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. [Music] Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [Music] No, he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. He never offered us victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. [Music] Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision in the adversary says give [Music] just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. So just hold on. Our Lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again. [Music] 2. [Music] 3. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heat. Heat. [Music] I know. [Music] Hey. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
