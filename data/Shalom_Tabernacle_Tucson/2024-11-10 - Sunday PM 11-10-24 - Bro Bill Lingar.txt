blood and the spirit and the power to make me a part of that new creation and now that life is in me and when it comes to maturity I'm going to turn back to a spoken word SE and God in the church will have the testimony that he's the beginning of the creation of God and he is the ending of the creation of God Amen that's us Christ in us the Alpha and the Omega we're so thankful to be here tonight and to see you all out it's such a privilege thank you brother Israel wherever he is for the invitation to be here and to have the opportunity to minister among the brothers the ministers that are of the caliber that they are I indeed appreciate the honor and I thank you I thank you brother po I thank you for the family and the church and I I want to say I like to be challenged by the word of God that I heard brother Paul and brother Ferguson last night challenge us so that we can be checked up so that we know where we are at all times with the word of God and so I appreciate that when they take me into the word of God like that so I can examine myself in the light of the truth amen and so I'm very very thankful and we always have to be ready for correction not that I'm going to bring correction tonight but God gives grace to the humble God gives grace to the humble and the humble have to die every day because we're in a great battle and Satan is constantly attacking us am as we heard this morning where he ended based upon what we were versus to what we are and so we're very thankful and so tonight I I'm going to speak on the subject of what manner of love is this and it's found in 1 John 3:1 but I'm not going to go there to start with okay and so let's just pray and then I'll let you be seated and we can start in on the message Heavenly Father truly we're amazed it's remarkable how can we get over this knowing what we once were and what you have made us by the gospel of the evening lightl we are privileged Lord to see not just the Perfection of the blood but the Perfection of the life of Jesus Christ in the church through the blood and it's all to your honor and to your glory we're so thankful father and we pray now tonight that you'll Bless the people you'll anchor the faith of Jesus Christ in them that they may know how to walk in the light and prepare for your coming in Jesus name amen you may be seated me set my timer on here okay and so we're going to go to First John 31 where we'll find my main text but not right now and before they go there I would like to quote from three different prophets Daniel Peter and Elijah how many knows who Elijah is amen and the reason is is because if I go straight to First John 3:1 it's going to pull me into an Evangelistic message that's a great Evangelistic uh verse of scripture and and I pray we'll end up there with the help of the Holy Spirit um but I W to I want to quote from these three prophets so that we have a common ground or a common understanding I want to remind us of what the scripture says about a certain subject which is one of the greatest and most important messages brother Bram told us which is the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ okay and so for we know at the second coming we will receive the crown of immortal life and that's to all those that love his appearing how many loves his appearing that's to those that love is appearing now that word appearing and coming is separate but but there's places where appearing used interchangeably and this appearing here is his coming and so you have to love his second coming and my question is how can you love his second coming and not love the truth that reveals his second coming and so when I was in maloi last December about a year ago I asked the congregation how many love the Lord Jesus everybody lifts their hand they love the Lord Jesus and I says yes everybody loves the Lord Jesus until he starts to reveal himself as the truth okay so the Lutheran love the message of justification and the light of justification but when Wesley came with more light and more truth there was Lutheran that didn't love the Methodist message so they didn't love Jesus did they because if they would have loved Jesus they would have loved the light of sanctification and then when the Pentecostal came ausa Street restoration of the gifts the complete New Birth the methodists that led Jesus for sanctification they didn't love him anymore they didn't want to move up into the light of the baptism of the Holy Ghost you follow me and so if we love Jesus as he revealed himself the truth we love that truth we Embrace that truth and we want to walk in the light of the truth and so when it came to the evening light the Pentecostals love the Pentecostal message but when it came to the evening light which is the morning star and he started to introduce adoption that were born children but we have to be child trained we have to be disciplined we have to be corrected we have to grow up unto an adult to become an adoped son and daughter God and so when he begin to bring that Pentecost didn't love that truth they didn't line up with it they rejected it and when they rejected that they rejected the light that would have revealed Christ in them from further than ever befor and so when it came to the evening light or the Morning Star here we are now and there's many people that have moved into the light of the evening light and we love that but what is this light introducing this light is introducing the coming of the son of righteousness this light is introducing the light of the perfect day back to where the bride becomes the spoken word created seed and the beginning of the creation becomes the finish of the creation in The Bride of Jesus Christ so that's that final step and so that step of the Morning Star introducing the son of righteousness that's where we've come out of Egypt we've been called out into the Third Exodus but that's where now we are warned by Paul Paul in the book of Hebrews we shall be made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence or faith steadfast unto the end and so this message you can't come part way the the bride she can't come part way she has to walk in the complete light until she enters the perfect day and once she has Christ in her the Holy Ghost he will reveal that light step by step and step by step our life will reflect the life of Jesus Christ we'll become more and more Christlike until Revelations 1 when he turned to see the bride of Christ which that was Christ in the bride was it not he said I saw one like the son of man he didn't see the son of man he saw one like the son of man and so may we have that Christlike life okay and so now let me um let me go to the first scripture which is Daniel chapter 2 and verse 34 and this is this is the common ground that I want to take a few moments and review it and bring it to our remembrance and may God illuminate it greater than ever before because these scriptures pertain to the second coming and there's nothing greater than to step into the light of the perfect day the son of righteousness which brother brandham tells us it's it's not just the physical healing it's the changing of the creature from Mortal to immortality and Corruption to incorruption and this is the only age that lives to see that promise and that's what I live for that's what I live for so I'm going to read you from uh the first Prophet Daniel and 234 he says Thou sawest till a stone was cut without hands which the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them into pieces So Daniel sees a smiting Stone and then in Daniel 2 and verse 44 he interprets what he saw so we don't have to wonder okay he's going to interpret it for us and he says in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break there's the there's the smiting it shall break in pieces and consume all the kingdoms and it shall stand forever and so right here Daniel is telling us that this stone is a kingdom this stone is a Kingdom and Jesus said if I cast out Devils by the Holy Ghost then the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you and so there was the kingdom of God in the fullness of the Holy Ghost In A Man Called Jesus revealed as the son of man amen amen and and so and so there was the Stone Kingdom in the form of the son of man and at Calvary Israel rejected that stone they smote that rock in order to fulfill the prophecy that the stone that the builders rejected would be made the head of the Gentile bride hallelujah amen and Jesus said this is marvelous in our eyes something marvelous is a great Wonder of all wonders and truly this is a great wonder that the stone came in the power of redeeming love at his first coming to make a way for it to come in perfect love at his second coming amen that's marvelous in our eyes and so Daniel he sees the second coming of The Headstone to the Gentile bride it came first to Israel as the Capstone of redeeming love to die for my blood my cross for his Gentile bride so he could come to her in the second coming as the Capstone of perfect love and so Daniel he sees the Capstone kingdom is that what the stone is it's the Capstone Kingdom of the Holy Ghost in the fullness of its power so Daniel he sees it coming as a smiting Stone and then as we go to Peter we're going to see Peter sees the same thing but he sees it as a love Stone Daniel saw it as a smiting Stone to those who rejected it but D but Peter sees it coming as a stone of Love A Love Stone to the Bride of Jesus Christ and that's in second Peter chapter 1 and verse 10 are you with me we're contrasting what what Daniel saw and what Peter saw and he says here Peter wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he sees the same Stone coming as the Capstone of perfect love to the Bride of Jesus Christ and he says yes I think it meat it's right and he says to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and that's what we're doing is just a few moments to remind you of things though you know them because the Bible says let us give the earnest heed to the things that have been spoken lest we let them slip so he says wherefore I would not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of those things though you know them and be established in the present truth and so Peter says here if you do these things you will never fall and an entrance shall be administered to you into the kingdom of God and so if these things be in you what things the Seven Virtues the seven steps in the Pyramid of a sinful man me made perfect Hallelujah I'm amazed how he loved me I'm amazed how he cared by the Precious Blood of his redeeming love me a sinful man have been made perfect in his sight that's amazing Hallelujah that's an amazing thing and so what this scripture is telling us is that this entrance that's ministered into the stone kingdom is at the top of the pyramid and brother brandom speaks much about that throughout his messages and so seven steps that grow you up to the top and how do you come to the top through the harder way the way of hard trials it's the character test you're being tested you're being opposed to leave the promise but if God has put it in your heart if you've been born of his love you're going to grow in his love and you're going to be capped off in his love and the Seven Virtues is the love of God in your life it's your cross daily dying daily so you can reflect Christ and his love through your his virtue his knowledge his Temperance to the to those who need it yes seven steps until you get to the top to be capped off in perfect love now this is me this is my hope okay this is my hope to be capped off in perfect love what for the tremendous victory in the love divine the tremendous victory in the love divine what makes it tremendous it's the victory of all victories it's the total Deliverance it's the Glorious Liberty of the manifested sons of God Amen there's no more battling old age there's no more battling the mind of what we was we will be completely changed and Satan will be sealed out am and that's what I live for so now let's look at what Elijah said do you have that picture okay I have just one slide okay and I'm and I I relabeled that because I I don't want to confuse you but these two pictures brother brandom spoke about them they're on tape they're absolutely on tape many places on tape but if I had to relabel that picture I would call it Elijah's pyramid message anybody ever hear Brother Bown use the term pyramid message okay so if you haven't I'm just here like Phillip I'm just here to call these things to your attention like brother Ferguson preached you have to have the desire I want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ there's nothing great there's no greater thing in my life to be transformed into the image of the stature of the perfect man than I may be the Bride of Jesus Christ and so let's see what Elijah says about these things there's a man here that can turn on the light he says Luther's Mana was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecost was the restoration of the gifts but this is introducing The Headstone the last day the brid tree which is contrary to all and and yet it's the same light for the matured see the light has gotten greater and greater and the Bride of Jesus Christ is becoming more like him more like him until she'll be like Revelations 1 one like the son of man so mark that in your heart this is introducing the headstone and so what kind of Mana are we feeding on Capstone Mana where did the Seven Seals come out of the Capstone are you with me and so this is Capstone Mana this is Rich food but this is bride food and she loves it and now from dedication 1962 at UDA brother brand went to dedicate a church there at UDA UDA for brother Hoover and he says now we already have the stones the stones that God for ordained see and we've got them all the way from Ephesus to leoda may I have that picture okay so you can see when it comes to the collective body of Jesus Christ we're at the top of the pyramid as far as the ages go but the individual in this age you also have to walk all seven steps in the light by the trial of your faith and that's the harder way that's where you meet the opposition to the promise do you want to turn back because it's painful in the body it's painful in the mind there's all kinds of Mind battles there's all kinds of heartaches you lose a loved one somebody does you wrong and maybe they didn't even mean to all these things is the harder way but it's God's way because he molds the Seven Virtues in your life Hallelujah we've got them all the way from Ephesus to leoda and so do we God's Prophet Elijah with the pyramid message has told us what they are virtue Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness bringing you up to the seventh step so you're ready for the stone Kingdom so he says we're only wait he says we got all the way from Ephesus to Lea we're only waiting for that headstone that the builders rejected waiting for his coming the capping Stone now that that's not me this can't be added to it can't be taken from it doesn't need our interpretations but one thing it does need is the revelation of the holy spirit in our lives and so now you know brother George he picks on us he says I want some amens I want some Hallelujah now he's way in the back back there today he's resting but I appreciate him and I appreciate brother durksen it's an it's an honor to to be here and minister with men of this caliber and so we have the stones we know what they are we're waiting for the coming the Capstone now that was 62 in 6 5 127 leadership the last complete message brother brandham ever preached was leadership how many can say Amen to that that's the last complete message he ever preached and he says this we've turned a corner we're looking towards heaven watching for the coming the cap on the pyramid as we would say his coming back The Church Must Be be resurrected soon and we must get ready okay and so you know here's where I wrestled Within Myself you know do I drop this in here or don't I but I'm going to drop it in here okay we can say but in 1963 at sunset Mountain brother Brandon was lifted up to fulfill the prophecy behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone and so that happened in 1963 can we say amen that's exactly what happened in 1963 he asked he was remember he was in that room locked and he said what Lord what does this mean and there he was in the corner and the book was open to Romans to that very scripture and so the question is brother lingar the stone has already appeared I say Amen but we have to differentiate the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ brother brandham made that distinction so let me give you this illustration What happens if you don't get these separated or rightly divide them for the scripture and the message so here is the appearing brother randam lifted up he was capped off okay and what and what did he do what did he unveil when he came back he broke the Seven Seals and then preached the message of the token and he said no other time could the token come and I'm thinking to myself what we've had the Holy Ghost through seven Church ages but no other time did the Holy Ghost come in the full stature of the Holy Ghost all the way from the feet up to the head and so it appeared appeared so the bride had the revelation of what she's to be and how to prepare and so here's the coming and when the Capstone comes the whole body of Christ is going to unite with it all right so now watch what happens when you mix up the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ this is very serious this is very serious because when you do this you put things in the message you mix up their place on where they go okay this makes me and you vulnerable to iniquity iniquity yes three things he told us we must not do yes sir misinterpret sir mislocate and dislocate and then he also said there's five things you must do and he told us how things have to come through the prophet the messenger of the age in his his time and his season and has to be foretold in the Bible and so when we break any of those things either we fail to do what we're supposed to do or we don't or we do what we're not supposed to do we become workers of iniquity because we break the word of God and so where are we we're in that honed age we're in that Capstone age where the razor's Edge between truth and eror are so close it's very easy to fail to rightly divide the word and it's a warning to me I have shuddered many times as a minister preaching this message one word and there's where we have to rely upon the grace of God and we have to check our desires what's my desire My Desire is not to be somebody my desire is to be a nobody so that I can be somebody in the Lord Jesus Christ so now in the message look for the difference between the appearing of The Headstone and the coming of The Headstone now let's go to the Evangelistic portion so to speak of the message and I I want to go to Psalms 119 and verse 18 and then I'll connect it to First John 31 now we we turnning you say well brother lingar I have a different view of it God bless you I love you if you got a different view of it and you can help me then show me the Brotherly Love put yourself in my place and seek to understand how I see what I see so that we're not fighting over Doctrine but we have the love and the fellowship with one another we're trying to help one another see more clearly like brother uh Paul we saw more clearly idolatry brother Ferguson we saw more clearly Revelation and that we don't and we can accept God's offer of Grace but God has to accept us and when he accept us that's a predestinated gift that genan was already there and when the revelation of he wants you to see for your age when it struck you it changed you amen you may not look like it the woman in the well probably didn't look like it but there's a diagram that brother brandom draws where the priests were over here that looked like the light and they had all the darkness but she was in the darkness and when that light struck her and God gave her the Revelation this is the Messiah this is the Christ Hallelujah that's what God recognized that's the faith that brings his righteousness so Psalms 119 and verse 18 open thou mine eyes that I may behold wondrous things out of the law now these two verses of scripture that we're coming to this one and 1 John 31 the theme of the two scriptures is wondrous things and wondrous things are amazing things they're remarkable things they're things that in the sight of man it causes man to wonder how could that be okay and when we wonder how it could be we can seek to understand but when we seek to understand we don't want to lean to our own understanding if it's God's Wonder we want to pray earnestly and sincerely Lord help me to understand this amen and so here's two wondrous things in the Bible Sarah heard the mystery of God's creative will her change but she questioned it why she leaned to her own understanding but thank God Abraham's Faith stood in the gap for Sarah but Mary when a creative will came to Mary Mary never questioned it did she she asked how these things to be she was asking for the revelation of it and he told her the pillar of fire will overshadow theej amen you say the holy ghost that Pillar of Fire was there and I believe as soon as she said be it unto me according to Thy word that Pro pillar fire came right down over her just like in the meetings brother bandam said the pillar fire went down over them the pillar fire went down over them Hallelujah and so God's wondrous things are amazing because there is a creative power and a creative will behind it and that's what makes it so marvelous he can do things that no one else can do amen and so this word behold it means to to see and this word behold is the connector that connects the theme of the two scriptures so Psalms behold and then when we go over to John we're going to see the same thing it starts with behold what manner of love so it's the connector but let me just finish on Psalms 11918 he says open thou my eyes thou is the Lord amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart that I might behold the creative will of all of the wondrous things that you do from Genesis to revelation espe ly in my age yes behold Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord that's why the song means so much to me and uh was brother George or brother Paul that read that that when we're worshiping what is it that motivates me in worship the re these songs bring Revelation to me I'm that he did that for me I believe that that's why with all of my heart I sing from my heart he inhabits the Praises of his people like that little Spanish couple this morning no great gifts of singing but what was great is it was coming from their heart and it was a true worship amenallah and that's what I want okay so open my heart now now let me say this if God opens your eyes he's given you that Revelation or he's given you the spiritual sight that he reserves for his elected because God is only known by Revelation amen and that Revelation comes to the prophet in order for the church to receive it and so I'm not going to go into this but it's it's a great quote and it's on Look Away to Jesus he says how can you look for pumpkins if you never seen a pumpkin how can you look for a pumpkin if you've never seen a pumpkin you don't know what you're looking for and then it dawned on me he said in that same message the third pool has been Vindicated and you know what to look for so how do I know what to look for unless I have the revelation of what's been Vindicated already before the bride now I know there's a lot of scarecrows around them the term third pool you hardly hear it anymore but in Simplicity it was the new ministry of a prophet and he was given the creative spoken word power amen amen and so I just Dro that in there I won't go any further I believe okay I did he say it and so what am I trying to do I'm trying to help you and it was so simple how do you know to look for a pumpkin when you've never seen a pumpkin and how do you know what your looking for in the third pool when the squeeze comes down if you don't have a revelation God hasn't showed it to you then what'll happen it'll happen like when the king's servant in the siege of Samaria they were so hungry during The Siege they were eating one another's children and the king of Samaria blamed it on Elisha and he was coming for Elisha's head and he sent a servant to him and when the servant was coming Elisha saw the vision and spoke the word of the Lord and said tomorrow at this time there'll be flour and there'll be barley in other words they'll be bread and the King's servant said if God opens the heavens if God opened up the Heavens he said it would not be and Elisha said you'll see it but you won't taste it it how many of us is going to live to see the third pool but won't be partakers of its blessing it's sobering and I wouldn't tell you this if I wanted to be a popular preacher because this subject is not popular and Saints put many scarecrows around it but forget the scarecrows you got the tapes you got the books and if you have the Holy Ghost go digging and feeding on the Capstone Mana that's just like our Prophet huh to illustrate his the great ministry with a pumpkin hallelujah how how many knows what a pumpkin looks like you could find one huh praise the Lord and so now we go to John 1 John chapter 3 the connector is behold and behold means we want to see something is that right it means to see something and when you see it then you can look for it and here he's saying see what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that what me a sinful man born a sinner could be made into the stature of a perfect man amen is there any greater Wonder than that I remember when I was 11 years old and I was walking through these apartments I'm just a boy I don't know God I only saw him on the cross when I was 5 years old in a Ste movie on Easter uh weekend and something touched my heart who is this man what is this and one day 10 11 years old I'm walking along and something says to me the greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone is going to happen to you I did what was it that still Small Voice that seed that was was there waiting for the time when God would find me when the eagle would fly over to me and call me out of the filth of the Barnyard I was a rock and roll pot smok and hippie that's what I was but the love of God reached down he called me he found me and now I'm in the process of being the one of it all Hallelujah there's three key words here behold manner bestowed manner means how something unfolds so the how the love of God unfolds and he says behold to see this this is what you want to see is how the love of God un folds to see this where's brother George he's my Amen Corner he has to bestow it upon you and bestow means to give it as a present give it as a gift Hallelujah he has to bestow upon you and me the spiritual sight to see the great mystery of his love unfolding down to this day and so what made us what made us sinful people perfect in his sight by his blood you believe that that's my focus that's where I want to go out of here that's where the messages has helped me okay what did that it was God's manner of love and so that's the question what manner of love is this and the answer to this question God's manner of love how God unfolds his love divine love the answer to that question is The Wonder of all the wonders of God hallelujah it's the mystery of his will it's the great secret that when the Angels were created he kept something in his bosom he kept the secret in his bosom how that this great person of divine love would unfold himself through redeeming love down to the perfect love in the Church of Jesus [Music] Christ what manner of love is this we're coming to it it's the Wonder of all his wonders it's the great secret of all his Secrets the Capstone coming of perfect love is the seven seal secret it's the great secret of the seven Secrets it's the great message of the seven messages and the seventh angel is the great messenger of all seven hallu I can let him tell you that I heard him say thatu I'm just saying what he said and remind me to come back to that okay because the way he says it is amazing and so what manner of love is this when we find the answer of how God's love unfolds to us it's The Wonder of it all because it makes us in the stature of a perfect man can you put the other picture up and so the Wonder of it all let me give you an example there are seven wonders of the ancient world seven wonders of the ancient world and one of those seven wonders is The Wonder of it all there was the Hanging Gardens in in Babylon there was the uh great lighthouse in Alexandri Egypt a Monumental work there was the great Colossus in roads okay all these great works that's a sample of some of the great wonders but the greatest Wonder of all seven wonders is Enoch's Great Pyramid it's Enoch's Great Pyramid it's a Bible in White Stone you say brother lingar I've never I've looked at the picture I don't see a white stone that's because they stole its casings but originally that was a pyramid of white stone that glistened in the sun amen praise the Lord hallelujah and so you can look it up all right it's a Bible in White Stone a pyramid of white stone that many don't know but in that white Stone there's a hidden message it's a Bible there's a hidden message and brother Branham told us what that message was in his pyramid message and now it's The Wonder of all seven wonders because all the six wonders were built by man all the six wonders were built by man and they've all decayed or have been destroyed by earthquakes that's the works of man because the works of man are to glorify man and to exalt the capabilities of man but the Great Pyramid wasn't built by a man Hallelujah it was built by the holy ghost in the prophet who had the Divine architect and the divine plan and it was built with a mystery not to glorify man but to glorify Jesus Christ The Headstone in man in the church amen God glorify and in you Paul said they glorified God in Me did they worship Paul no they were grateful for the revelation of Jesus Christ which is God in his church that came through through Paul that's what they were grateful for and so we're living in that age of the razor's Edge on the right and on the left but in the middle in the middle is the Revelation that we're not putting brother brandham above Jesus Christ but we see the revelation of Christ in man in the Perfection of the Holy Ghost God's witness of the token which could only come in the evening time yes sir Hallelujah I'm thankful I'm very thankful amen so of the Seven Wonders the Great Pyramid is The Wonder of all and no wonder it's foreshadowing Elijah's message of the pyramid message that foreshadowed it it's it's foreshadowing it and and Enoch was the seventh from Adam Elijah is the seventh from the second Adam Hallelujah and Enoch took the Rapture and Elijah is trying to give us the Revelation that when we come into this image that's the individual that's going in the Rapture so it's a very important Revelation and so now we know Enoch built it it's a Bible of stone it has a symbolizes a hidden message it relates to the Rapture and so on the outside you can see that it has no Capstone you can see that just like you can read the Bible and see Jesus was rejected at his first coming but the mystery of his second coming The Mystery of the Capstone coming is inside the pyramid inside that white stone for when you go in there you see that there are seven steps up to the top of the pyramid and in the seven steps up to the top of the pyramid you come to the prophet's chamber and the prophet's chamber is on the 50th layer of Masonry these are just facts okay the prophet's chamber is on the 50th layer so you go up seven steps you go up the Seven Virtues you come to the top amen of the 50th and so we see then here again that the pyramid message of Elijah is the greatest message of them all every age had a jubilee 50 is the number of Jubilee every age had a jubilee but when we are capped off it's the Jubilee of all jubilees because it's our final Deliverance it's our final release from the Mind battles from the corruption of the flesh it's the release of it all to me it's the tremendous victory in the love divine and so on the out outside you can see the Capstone has none it was rejected at its first coming but the mystery of how it comes the second time is inside the pyramid and the Mystery of how he comes a second time is in the Bible but it took Elijah the prophet the seven seal Messenger to bring out the stature of a perfect man and so we have The Wonder of it all Enoch's pyramid and The Wonder of it all the stature of a perfect man can you say amen amen just so I know you're with me amen it's The Wonder of it all and so now the question I want to come to and this is where I have taken an Evangelistic message is the question is what what manner of love is this in other words how did this love unfold how did this love unfold in order to make us The Offspring of a perfect life that's his children he's perfect they're perfect how did this love unfold so that he could make us perfect in his sight and we find that in Ephesians 1:3 Paul gives us the answer so the question is what manner of love is this how is this love unfolding to give us Perfection okay and he tells us here that God's love unfolds in three different forms and brother brandham repeated over and over God unfolds himself in threes okay three Bibles the Zodiac the Bible of stone and the written word but there's only one Bible there's only one Revelation and all three Bibles have to testify of the first and the second coming and they do and so there's one person of divine love that's almighty God he's eternal life and that eternal life has a personality if you would sum up the personal ity of almighty God it is divine love and so that's what motivates him and so it was his Divine love that within his mind he formulated the counsel after his will how he would Express himself and that's the secret he kept and So Divine love unfolded in three forms and with me this is my terminology the first form was agapo love the second form was redeeming love the third form is perfect love okay so watch what Paul says here blessed be the god stop right there there's where he created the angels and there's where he had the great Secret in his mind blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ so there's the father there is the son who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ so the father and the son blessed us in the Holy Ghost in Heavenly places in Christ amen amen can you say amen amen that's what he did and he said he did this according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love so when he chose us to when he when he decided to express himself as Father and Son and Holy Ghost he did it so that he could bring us before him po blameless spotless in perfect love plug in perfect love right there and then go down to the rest of the Scripture it ties in with adoption it ties in with the mystery of his will and so through Father Son and Holy Ghost we find out that the father what is he agapo love and the son Jesus Christ what was he redeeming love and in the bride what is he perfect love not three persons one person condenscending down to make himself known in his children and in his bride so what's the difference between agapo love and redeeming love what's the difference between redeeming love and perfect love agapo love could not die MDC could not die MDC was and is agapo love he could not die so he had to change his form and take on the form of son son of man so that the Holy Ghost had blood that he could die hallu and that was redeeming love so redeeming love was the perfect life of God in the perfect blood to become the perfect sacrifice Hallelujah so that by the grace of the Cross am through his blood and his life we could come back to the stature of a perfect man in perfect love are you with me AG go of Love could not die The Living Word cannot die but the Living Word was made flesh to become for me how about you the bleeding word The Living Word became the bleeding word and that's why when Paul met him on the road to Damascus he said who are you that Pillar of Fire that Living Word had become Jesus the living bleeding word amen now that Pillar of Fire was the light of the lamb praise the Lord praise the Lord and when that light of the Lamb strikes you what happens it applies the blood to you if you walk in the light as he's in the light then the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse you from all sin that's why we love the light that's why no matter how bright the light gets and the bright of and the light of his second coming there's no brighter light than that but I want it it's my perfection and so he became me that I might become him he The Living Word became me the bleeding word to take my sin upon him to take the curse of the law on him by Grace amen that I might become the living word amen hallelujah become him The Living Word the holy ghost in the fullness of the stature of the perfect [Music] man and my Joshua I don't know about your Joshua I like the way brother George you know he he likes to challenge you and that I'm borrowing some of his ways so you got to forgive me you know my Joshua which brother Ram said was the end time leader yes and you say well brother R also said is a holy ghost so everybody have a holy ghost are they a messenger to the age so I'm just you know just balancing it up my Joshua left his body and went beyond the curtain of time went into the glory land amen and he saw all the saints robed in white and then the voice said to him this is what you preached this is the Holy Ghost this is divine love he The Living Word became me the bleeding word that I might by his blood in his life become him the Living Word and brother random saw the bride oh over there Snow White in the campstone of perfect love now tie that to the prophecy a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee sir okay I'll stop there so we see we see that God's manner of love is aapo love MDC could not die can you say Amen but he had a plan just think of how great his plan is why did he choose to suffer why did he choose the agony why did he choose the pain why did he choose the humiliation so he could express to you and me his redeeming love amen and so that he could be worshiped Through the Ages as God Our Savior by his redeeming love so I don't know who wrote that song but Redemption by Blood it's Love's Greatest Story it's not only Love's greatest story but it's God's greatest mystery it's the love it's the Wonder of all wonders what manner of love is this that made me a sinful man if I say like that perfect what manner of love is that it's a gotho love condenscending the redeeming love in this last days by his seventh angel messenger by a third pool Ministry of perfect love showing me what God ordained me to be be unfolded this Revelation not just in the letter but in the power and demonstration that's why he could say to the Hornets go back into your nest I'm sorry I bothered you and there's a brother Hoover where I go to church and his dad was the brother Hoover that he brother brandham dedicated the house or the the church to in that message that I quoted but his grandmother was brother branham's Nanny and she lived with the brandham family for a little while and brother brandham took her around this is the testimony to me a brother Hoover I never asked them he took her around and he showed her her responsibilities and where they did what in the house this is where we pray this is where we have devotions I want you to have devotions with my children and then he took her out out and took her to the window to the backyard and he said you see that steak there that white Stak he said I don't let my children play there around that white Stak and the reason is I promised those Hornets that I would not disturb them if they would go back into their nest that was the same power that spoke to the bull that was the same power when that couple was making love in the meetings and disturbing the meetings and doing all that vulgarity that stood in the Gap and said I forgive you now what about us how are we going to keep the unity of the spirit that's what those Seven Virtues are friends that's the blood of Christ coming through us that's our cross that is suffering that is painful when somebody does you wrong and you don't deserve it especially when you've tried to help somebody and everybody's been there we've all been there but I'm saying that just to relate to you it's not the easy way it's the harder way that leads to the tremendous victory in the love divine amen and so I'll close with this Redemption by blood is Love's greatest story and it's not only Love's Greatest Story it's God's greatest secret and the way I know that is because what the man with the pyramid message whom God sent to build me into the PowerHouse of God what he told me on tape and I'm referring to Christ is the mystery of God revealed and uh go read this for yourself go meditate on this this is God's great mystery of love expressed that God and man became one Hallelujah [Applause] uhoh God and man became one the whole thing is God and man one Hallelujah now listen to him unfold this God and man was one there and God and man is one hereu what is it being filled with his Spirit him having the prances Hallelujah that was God's achievement that's God's purpose to do that that he might be in Christ and Christ in us and all of us together one hallelujah what is the preeminence Colossians said it's the headship over the body and the headship over the body was never revealed until the evening time message when God laid in Zion in The Bride of Jesus Christ represented by a prophet a son of man can we say Amen a son of man revealing the Perfection of the son of man it's his perfect life it's his perfect blood to make this great Secret The Wonder of all secrets that a filthy sinful man like me could come to the stature of a perfect man he was one there and he's one here one there the son of man man in the East this is who we worship is it not this is the one that bled for me this is redeeming love one there he spirit and blood had to become one spirit and blood became one in a man born perfect amen so he could raise up and live a perfect life without sin yet tempted by sin so that he could be the perfect sacrifice Amen to project the grace of redeeming love the grace of redeeming love his blood sir his life and the creative power in his life Hallelujah so he was one there son of man in the East he's one here a son of man lifted up in the west to manifest the Perfection of the son of man and I'm not going to read the quote but there's a quote on it and I had to pray over it a long time to really by God's grace I believe to see what it is the Perfection of the son of man in Christ that pyramid is the Perfection of the son of man in Christ because that pyramid is Christ that pyramid is the Life of Christ that we sing I want to be like Jesus I want to be more like Jesus what is it to be Christlike amen but if you really want to be Christlike it's the harder way it's the way of self- crucifixion so that what I can express virtue so that what I can have the knowledge in this situation what's right and what's wrong and then when I see what's right and wrong and God has finally showed me what's right and wrong well now I'm going to go I'm going to go deal with it but I got to have Temperance wait a minute wait a minute Temperance you know what it's it's you got to be able to say it in the right place you got to be able to say it at the right time you got to be say it in the right spirit so Temperance I got the knowledge of it I got the temp of it I'll hold my peace I say honey God showed me how to deal with this problem and she says hold your peace and I say how long patience patience amen hallelujah to your knowledge add Temperance to your Temperance add patience how long until until God gives you the time and God gives you the place and God gives you the mental attitude and someday it just comes unconscious L you're at a certain place at a certain time and God moves you like he moves Simeon he moves you and the Holy Ghost moved you that's right and he went to see the Christ but you're going to reflect the Christ so God was one there there to reflect redeeming love can you say amen and God is one here to reflect perfect love the perfect life of Jesus Christ how many wants that how many wants to see that well God promised by Amos 3:7 he would show it to you so when I see this picture I'm not trying to separate the pillar of fire from a man because God died to bring him and himself together and make him one in fact there's three unclean spirits well I won't go there I won't go there so what is this perfect Oneness let him tell us what this perfect Oneness is from Blasphemous names how many want to be perfectly one with the Lord Jesus you do and when I meet you you think I'll be able to feel that love of Jesus you feel think I'll be able to feel that rainbow love that light that cut him when he was cut at Calvary to reflect that Seven Virtues of his love I'm talking to me I'm challenging me there's days I get up I don't feel like going outside the house and I don't want nobody knocking on the door and I ain't going to answer any text but I'll do it anyway I'll do it anyway I just have to pray a little bit read my Bible a little bit amen get rid of the old self and let that life that's in me have the preeminence amen oh Lord amen yes so here is his definition that's my words of per perfect Oneness then Blasphemous names then that was number one number one coming to your mental Faith right here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith then that spiritual Faith only recognizes the word now and number two three then you'll have spiritual you'll have the Holy Spirit and we'll seal all these things into you as the Holy Spirit covers this from your faith up to the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ then you become one then you become one I'm potentially one with him now when I've been engaged to him by the new birth and now I'm putting on the the wedding Garment of the Seven Virtues and I'm getting ready for the bridegroom's coming at the Capstone coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen for the wedding and when the wedding comes I'll not only be one in my soul I'll be one in my spirit I'll be one in my flesh the beginning of the creation of God that started as redeeming love in him will become the finished creation of God in Me A Spoken Word SE of God's perfect love Hallelujah so if you follow this when you become one like that that's when your name on the check becomes as good is his name Hallelujah not until until it's his name on the check but when you come to the top of the pyramid and you're capped off with perfect love and now you're under the preeminence and the full control of the Holy Ghost he gives you the spoken word and you have the authority to use it because you're under his control amen and you there's many symbols of that in the Old Testament when Joseph came to the right hand of pharaoh he was given the king signant ring morai was given the king signant ring why because Joseph had the coat of seven colors Mori had the character of Jesus Christ power without character is satanic so thank God for the cloud ring it's a mystery to the world it's a great cloud ring of mystery but to us it's the preeminence hallelujah it's the king's Authority the king's sword placed in the hand of a prophet for a Ministry amen of perfection my time's up I said I remind myself and I made a statement love is the greatest of all God's wonders the seventh pyramid message is the greatest of all the messages and the seventh angel is the greatest of all The Messengers now here's what he said in the seventh seal and I've looked at this for years and years and years and absolutely had no Revelation I'm not saying I have it now but I'm going to read it to you because this is truly an amazing quote and he's talking about the constellation and did you notice that one angel I said in there was a strange Angel he looked to me more than any of the rest of them you remember that they were in a constellation three on a side and one on the top and the one right next to me here counting from the left to the right would have been the seventh angel he was brighter meant more to me than the rest of them you remember I said he had his chest out like that was flying Eastward you remember like that I said it picked me up Lifted Me Up you remember that here it is the one with the seven seal notice the wording the thing that I wondered all my life the mother seals meant a lot to me of course but oh you don't know what this has meant for one time in my life in another quote he said the other six Angels were ordinary angels but this Angel was in the position of the Capstone I mean in the Keystone this Angel three on a side and one on the top he was in the position of the Archangel the revelation of it I can't give it to you point it out search it friends look into it and here is where the revelation of the Rapture of the Rapture is behold see see this revelation of God's love unfolding down to perfect love see it and how are you going to see it God has to bestow it upon you my last comment God has to bestow it upon you he has to give it to you as a gift of Grace he has to give it to you as a present and it takes two gifts to see it it takes the prophetic gift which is the eye in the Capstone in order for him to open it up and show you by manifestation the great secret of his love standing before you God and man won the stature of a perfect man how many wants to be that I want to be that and and so he has to bestow that upon you and then that becomes the light of the age and then in order for you to get that Revelation he had has to give you the gift of faith he has to give you the predestinated gift of faith and when you have that predestinated gift of faith then God making himself known through his Prophet by the Light of the hour it strikes that seed and you catch the revelation of a son of man manifesting the Perfection of the son of man and what is it it's God's Grace for your Perfection praise the lord it's God's grace may I have the musicians can we sing that song Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord you want to [Music] stand I don't do you have the words for that there it is help started My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you open the eyes make it your prayer Lord that's my prayer Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you high and lifted up shining in what the light of his glory pour out your power and love will sing Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy I want to see make it your prayer let's Worship the [Music] Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you how high and lift it up shining in the light of Glory what pour out your power and love singing Holy Holy Holy to see you did that your prayer did the message touch your hearts I I did the best I could I did the best I could there's times other times preachers know you do better I did the [Music] best but Brethren when I get up in the morning and I don't want to go outside and I don't want anybody to come in and I'm not awake and I start reading my Bible then I start singing songs like this it's a prayer in my heart it's a revelation of what God has pre destinated the bride to in this day she's coming to the Perfection of the son of [Music] man and that word Perfection is misunderstood and I've had to learn the hard [Music] way we're perfect by his blood Hallelujah and his spirit amen his life so his blood purchased your Perfection thank you Lord amen and through his blood of redeeming love before the foundation of the world when he looked through that redeeming love he saw you in perfect love yes or amen he saw you there okay that's what the blood does for you but what the life does for you what the Holy Ghost does for you the Holy Ghost makes you perfect what do I mean the Holy Ghost grows you into the stature of the perfect man the Holy Ghost brings you into maturity the Holy Ghost brings you into the stature of the perfect man the blood purchased it the blood sees it but the Holy Ghost is what manifests it are you with me and so what happens here's how God sees you because in his mind it's a finished work and you're there brother brandom went beyond the curtain of time you're there okay but in your life and in your manifestation whatever how much Holy Ghost you have in you maybe you have enough faith maybe you're avert you maybe you're a knowledge you haven't come to the stature of a perfect man yet but in God's sight you're perfect and so here's what happens there's a gap between how God sees you and what your life is manifesting do you understand there's a gap because in his sight I am perfect in his sight I am blameless and I will stand before him faultless but it has to be manifested by the life of the Holy Ghost most and so the Gap is this he sees us perfect but in manifestation of our life I haven't come to the maturity or the Perfection of a perfect man are you with me now the Gap there is this Satan knows this and Satan is your adversary and so Satan comes in that Gap and he tries to anoint you with fear that's right because he's constantly putting you back to what you were I'm still tormented by things that when I was 16 and 17 years old I have to battle [Music] that and so what am I going to do am I going to listen to his lie or am I going to look to my Advocate who stands in the gap for me amen as the great high priest the Lord Jesus Christ he stands there with his own blood amen and W his life is bringing me to Perfection he's my adversary and so I'm born of the love and now I'm growing in love and Satan is anointing me with fear I'm not going to make it the fear of failure the fear of this and the fear of that and he paralyzes your faith but perfect love casts out all fear and what is perfect love in his sight by his blood I'm forgiven he no longer remembers it he sees me perfect amen now in my sight I have the Revelation that I'm not in the stature of the perfect man but I am coming to the stature of a perfect man so therefore Satan get away from me take the anointing of the word of God that's coming down from your theoy and let it bless you let It cast out all fear Hallelujah prise God and so about a year ago brother Ferguson kind of was toward the end of the service he talked about being forgiven and being justified forgiven you did it Justified you never did it so by the blood I am forgiven and forgotten by all that I ever did Hallelujah then when his life comes into me I'm Justified hallelujah amen I'm being judged by his life and his life never sin in the first place it may not be mature in me but it's sinless with me I can't disbelieve the word I can't amen I can't disbelieve it I may not understand it but in due season with my heart is right God will bring me to it and so tonight if Satan is tormenting you if Satan is anointing you with fear or what everything that fear is one of the worst things that he can put on you because it paralyzes it paralyzes and it opens the door and then he moves in with other things and he's trying to bind you and take away the joy of your salvation and keep you on the defense when God has made us to take the offense in the name of Jesus Christ amen so we are forgiven it's forgotten we're pardoned and we are Justified let's sing this song one more time and whoever comes up can offer the prayer for those in Need You Love the Lord amen here's the big test do you love me am oh as brother Ferguson would say do you love me oh man oh it's a hard one isn't it all right sing it again Open the Eyes of My Heart [Music] Lord [Music] heart I want to see you and Open the Eyes of Our Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you see you [Music] I pour out your power and love holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen let's
