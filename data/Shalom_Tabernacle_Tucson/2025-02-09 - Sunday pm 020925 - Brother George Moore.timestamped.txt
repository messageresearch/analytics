[37:23] John chapter nine it was the man that
[37:26] was born blind from his
[37:29] birth when Jesus came by and spit in the
[37:33] ground made the clay and anointed his
[37:36] eyes with it and he sent him to the pool
[37:38] of salom to to go wash
[37:41] and he never saw Jesus's face when when
[37:44] he was able to see and they asked him
[37:46] who healed you he says all I know is he
[37:49] touched me I was blind but now I can see
[37:52] and I think that's all of our testimony
[37:55] tonight we were blind but now we can see
[37:58] he fashioned These Eyes of clay and just
[38:01] thankful for the chance again to come
[38:03] and be Washed by the Water of the word
[38:05] tonight and amen let's just we sing A
[38:08] Chorus at the end that I know you'll all
[38:10] know and can join in with me

[43:49] the Lord Jesus Christ so happy to be in
[43:52] the house of the Lord with you this
[43:53] evening just before we go to the word of
[43:55] the Lord just another announcement on um
[43:58] the Cedar Hills Church of the cross our
[44:01] good friends the Petes Caleb Pettis and
[44:05] Tommy Jr is the assistant pastor there
[44:09] but they have their youth service
[44:11] starting February the 22nd at 12:00 and
[44:15] that will be posted on the back there
[44:18] you're all welcome to come it's a I
[44:20] think it's a three hour three and a half
[44:22] hour drive maybe I think you lose an
[44:24] hour but they're always they're good
[44:27] friends to the ministry here they always
[44:29] seem to support us whenever we can have
[44:32] them and so they've asked me to come and
[44:34] so pray for us on that meeting if you
[44:38] can't go pray for us amen for those
[44:41] meetings and just before brother George
[44:43] comes we had some pictures just a look
[44:46] back they're really short five minutes
[44:49] starting back from when we started uh
[44:51] here in this building um we were um in a
[44:56] hotel H for a few months June of 2016 is
[45:00] when we started right at the Rada or was
[45:03] the hotel in Suites they gave us one
[45:05] little hotel room there for two nights
[45:08] or Sunday and then a Wednesday night and
[45:11] then they let us take another room there
[45:14] as we
[45:15] could and the hustle and bustle trying
[45:17] to find a place to worship so I
[45:19] contacted the tday school district and
[45:22] um they were very friendly and nice they
[45:25] really look
[45:27] uh forward to having churches occupy
[45:29] their space because it cuts down on the
[45:32] vandalism I was told and so as we were
[45:35] looking for a place they said um the one
[45:38] lady Shelly she said um hey you know
[45:40] there's a building that used to be a
[45:42] church um would you be interested
[45:44] looking at sure so she sends me the
[45:46] address and I pull up here and this was
[45:49] Caleb used to be amazing grace
[45:52] Tabernacle used to worship here and this
[45:54] pull pit was over there they had a
[45:55] curtain and they sound booth was
[45:57] arranged differently so we got a hold of
[46:01] that at a very good price um first year
[46:05] was two was a two-year lease and they
[46:07] raised their rent on us one time still
[46:09] very very low and from that time till
[46:12] now they have not raised the rent
[46:14] they've been very favorable to us and we
[46:17] just was just one of those things we
[46:19] found it's on a beautiful well the
[46:22] neighborhood is not as beautiful as
[46:25] Beauty's in eye of the beholder so it
[46:27] depends on what you're looking at what
[46:29] time of the day you're looking but not
[46:31] far it's right on the open Street there
[46:34] and we the Lord has blessed us here
[46:36] right in this location and that was no
[46:39] wisdom of Our Own It was available we
[46:42] just followed the leading of the Lord
[46:44] and this has served us very well and so
[46:47] we have complaints but I refrain from
[46:50] complaining about this building because
[46:54] when we thought we were going to have to
[46:56] release or go to another place we
[46:58] realized we had a really good deal here
[47:01] right and so the expense for commercial
[47:04] property and so forth was just uh
[47:07] ridiculous but the Lord kept us here
[47:10] safe all these years we had our little
[47:12] incidences of B you know things were
[47:15] taken and stuff like that but um we've
[47:19] had some folks get baptized too and uh
[47:22] that little couple you see here whether
[47:25] um dug
[47:27] he
[47:28] is you know we did an Outreach meeting
[47:30] during covid and he was one of the ones
[47:32] he sat right up under
[47:34] me brother Isaiah Brooks sang and we
[47:37] sang and then he preached and Doug came
[47:40] with his big old cooler drink and he sat
[47:42] right up under just staring and looking
[47:45] and he said I'm going to come to your
[47:46] church I said yeah okay sure and he
[47:49] actually came and he's been coming ever
[47:52] since and he's probably single-handedly
[47:55] brought more visitors to this church
[47:56] Church than any one
[47:58] member oh yes and he's had me go to the
[48:01] hospitals to pray for his mother his
[48:03] friend and this one and that one and and
[48:06] so every time he calls I try to answer
[48:09] him I can't all the time but um and so
[48:14] that's you know that's what it is you
[48:17] the Lord sends you the people that he
[48:18] wants to come into your life and so and
[48:21] he has you uh walk where you're walking
[48:24] and so that's why we've been here and
[48:26] the Lord's bless us with another a place
[48:28] to go to not wisdom of our own but the
[48:32] the um the footsteps of the righteous
[48:34] are ordered of the Lord there's a
[48:36] scripture brother Ernie brother Ernie um
[48:40] there on Thursday night it's a scripture
[48:42] where Paul greets the church greetings
[48:46] holy
[48:47] Brethren and if we would never call each
[48:50] other holy Brethren but that's what the
[48:51] Bible says so look at your neighbor and
[48:54] says greetings holy brethren
[48:59] all right that's the Bible now
[49:03] don't praise the Lord and so just a few
[49:06] moments and then they'll just play this
[49:08] slideshow um or I think it's about five
[49:10] minutes and then we'll uh get into the
[49:12] word amen God bless you
[49:24] [Music]
[49:56] I
[49:59] [Music]

[56:10] know there's quite a few pictures that
[56:12] may be missing and so the that was the
[56:15] last minute put together um and if you
[56:18] have pictures you want to add to that
[56:21] then uh they'll probably do that again
[56:23] let's all stand to our feet and
[56:27] sing the old Hymn of the church Amazing

[58:49] for our scripture reading very very
[58:51] familiar scripture it should be to all
[58:53] of us St John the first
[59:06] chapter you know one thing I found down
[59:08] through life that if the Lord closes a
[59:10] door it's only because he has another
[59:12] door open for you and so we're so
[59:16] grateful for that and and Lord the
[59:18] things that he's done for us uh uh you
[59:21] can't make it up I mean you couldn't
[59:23] scrip it you couldn't have planned it
[59:25] the way he's done it it but the way he
[59:26] does it is perfect St John the first
[59:30] chapter in the beginning was the word
[59:32] and the Word was with God and the Word
[59:34] was God the same was in the beginning
[59:37] with God and all things were made by him
[59:41] and without him was not anything made
[59:44] that was
[59:45] made in him was life and the life was
[59:49] the light of men and the light shineth
[59:52] in the darkness and the Darkness
[59:54] comprehended it not
[59:56] there was a man sent from God whose name
[59:58] was John the same came for a witness to
[1:00:01] Bear witness of the light that all men
[1:00:04] through him might believe he was not
[1:00:07] that light but was sent to Bear witness
[1:00:09] of that
[1:00:11] light that was the True Light which lith
[1:00:14] every man that cometh into the
[1:00:16] world he was not he was in the world and
[1:00:19] the world was made by him and the world
[1:00:21] knew him not he came to his own and his
[1:00:23] own received him not but as many has
[1:00:26] received him to them gave he power to
[1:00:28] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:00:31] believe on his name which were born not
[1:00:35] of blood nor of the will of the flesh
[1:00:37] nor of the will of man but of God shall
[1:00:42] we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're
[1:00:44] so grateful tonight Lord to be assembled
[1:00:46] together with the purchase of your blood
[1:00:49] Lord the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord we
[1:00:52] don't take it for granted the
[1:00:53] opportunity that we have to gather Lord
[1:00:56] we don't know Lord how much longer we
[1:00:58] have on this world but Lord however much
[1:01:01] longer we have we want to spend it in
[1:01:03] service for you we want to spend it Lord
[1:01:06] doing all that we can for the kingdom of
[1:01:08] God and Lord Jesus we don't want to just
[1:01:11] halfway get through life but Lord we
[1:01:13] want to be victorious we want to
[1:01:15] accomplish that what you've have us to
[1:01:17] do we want to do the things you'd have
[1:01:20] us to do Lord and Lord God to to do the
[1:01:23] work that you want us to work father and
[1:01:25] we committed into your hands tonight
[1:01:27] Lord bless your people we pray father
[1:01:29] Lord I ask you to watch over me and bind
[1:01:31] my lips before I'd speak anything
[1:01:33] unpleasing to you and we'll commit it
[1:01:35] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[1:01:42] God bless you the title of the message
[1:01:43] tonight is enlightened by the shikina
[1:01:46] glory you may be seated
[1:01:55] enlightened by the shakina
[1:01:58] glory everybody all right tonight all
[1:02:01] right well praise the Lord so
[1:02:04] Saint this little scripture uh that we
[1:02:07] just read John here he says in him was
[1:02:12] life in Jesus Christ was life and he
[1:02:16] says that the life was the light of men
[1:02:21] and we understand that the life was not
[1:02:24] just the light of good men it's the
[1:02:26] light of all men and we understand that
[1:02:31] sometimes you wonder how you know people
[1:02:33] can live around the message and can be
[1:02:36] doing the things that they're doing well
[1:02:37] it's because the life was the light of
[1:02:40] all men but we find that the light of
[1:02:43] Jesus Christ is actually the life that
[1:02:46] you and I live and the light shines in
[1:02:49] the darkness and the Darkness
[1:02:52] comprehends it not see the world doesn't
[1:02:55] understand what you and I understand and
[1:02:58] so they don't understand the life that
[1:03:00] you and I live they they don't
[1:03:03] understand what it is it doesn't make
[1:03:05] any sense to them saints because it's a
[1:03:07] light that's inside of each and every
[1:03:10] one of us it's the light is the life we
[1:03:13] live can you say Amen to that tonight
[1:03:16] and that he said it was the True Light
[1:03:18] that lith every man that cometh into the
[1:03:20] world and he says but as many as receive
[1:03:24] him to them gave power to become the
[1:03:27] sons of God aren't you thankful to be
[1:03:30] one that has received him tonight that
[1:03:32] he has given power to become the sons of
[1:03:36] God can you say Amen to that tonight
[1:03:38] Saints so I'm glad saints that I I've
[1:03:40] been given the ability to be a Son of
[1:03:43] God it it means everything to me that
[1:03:46] I'm a Son of God tonight I I didn't
[1:03:48] choose this path this path was chosen
[1:03:51] for me and I'm so grateful that he chose
[1:03:54] it for me tonight Saints and in him was
[1:03:58] life and the life was the light the life
[1:04:01] was the light amen so it's not just it's
[1:04:04] not just the word on paper it's not just
[1:04:07] the word in the Bible it's not just the
[1:04:09] word in the message but it's the word in
[1:04:12] you it's the light you live that's the
[1:04:15] light of all men can you say Amen
[1:04:17] tonight it's not the Bible in book form
[1:04:20] it's the Bible in
[1:04:22] you that's the life Saints and the son
[1:04:26] the Su n brings life into the world the
[1:04:29] the sun is what shines down on the earth
[1:04:31] and and the plant life and the animal
[1:04:34] life they they absorb that sun they
[1:04:36] receive that sun and the Sun that they
[1:04:39] receive brings forth life in them now is
[1:04:43] that right amen and the s o n is the
[1:04:47] same way Saints the s o n shines down on
[1:04:51] the seed word that's planted on the
[1:04:53] inside of you and I tonight and when it
[1:04:56] shines on the seed word it brings forth
[1:05:03] life the light is what brings forth that
[1:05:07] life now the word light the Greek word
[1:05:09] means fos it means to shine or to make
[1:05:12] manifest see the life is what manifests
[1:05:15] the light is what manifests the life
[1:05:17] whatever seed good or bad that's in a
[1:05:20] person when the light strikes it it
[1:05:23] manifests it it makes it known
[1:05:26] and you might be able to pretend to be a
[1:05:28] believer you might be able to pretend
[1:05:30] that you love the Lord but sooner or
[1:05:31] later when the light strikes it'll make
[1:05:34] known of what kind of seed is on the
[1:05:37] inside my wife's grandpa said that time
[1:05:40] was a tattletail time will tell on you
[1:05:42] eventually you can act like you're a
[1:05:44] Believer for a little while but you
[1:05:46] can't go
[1:05:49] forever and you can't hide that life and
[1:05:53] the life is what shines out
[1:05:56] against the darkness of the world it's
[1:05:58] such a stark
[1:06:00] contrast between the believer and the
[1:06:02] rest of the world it's a stark contrast
[1:06:05] between the life that you live and the
[1:06:08] life that the world lives it's such a
[1:06:10] stark contrast and and it condemns the
[1:06:14] world when they see it and you can't
[1:06:17] hide it people know what you are you
[1:06:20] don't have to say you're a Christian you
[1:06:22] don't have to say you're a Believer
[1:06:24] brother John people know you're a
[1:06:25] Believer they pick up on things they say
[1:06:28] man he don't he don't swear and he don't
[1:06:31] drink and he what's going on with that
[1:06:32] guy right there I bet he's one of those
[1:06:35] Christian
[1:06:39] types you sisters you're an example to
[1:06:42] the rest of the world when you walk out
[1:06:43] of this church everybody in the world
[1:06:46] sees that you're a Believer it's a
[1:06:49] testimony to what you believe they see
[1:06:51] it they recognize it they recognize the
[1:06:53] light that is the life that is in
[1:06:57] you and people that don't even think
[1:06:59] they believe the way we believe will
[1:07:01] call you for
[1:07:03] prayer is that right they don't agree
[1:07:06] with you but they want you to pray for
[1:07:08] them why because the light is the life
[1:07:11] and it's in
[1:07:13] you and it just matters what kind of
[1:07:15] seed is down on the inside those
[1:07:17] Pharisees were staunch they were they
[1:07:20] were real message believers they they
[1:07:22] obeyed all the law they they kept all
[1:07:24] the Commandments amen but they called
[1:07:27] Jesus a
[1:07:30] devil but a woman that had five
[1:07:34] husbands said Thou Art Christ the son of
[1:07:38] the Living God because the light was
[1:07:40] striking the seed and it don't matter
[1:07:43] where you're at Saints it don't matter
[1:07:44] what condition you're in when the light
[1:07:46] strikes the seed the light is the life
[1:07:49] and it will produce the Life of Christ
[1:07:51] in you I don't know where you was I know
[1:07:54] where I was and I know I was in the mud
[1:07:56] and I know I was in the muck and I know
[1:07:58] my life was trash but the light struck a
[1:08:02] seed on the inside and it brought forth
[1:08:05] life come on somebody tonight it brings
[1:08:07] forth life because there's a seed germ
[1:08:11] laying there ready to
[1:08:14] ripen and when it comes in contact with
[1:08:17] the life it's got to bring forth it
[1:08:20] can't
[1:08:23] stop because the light is the life
[1:08:26] brother Ram said in the message why
[1:08:28] Christ speak he says and that little
[1:08:31] prostitute said why this fell is the
[1:08:34] Messiah and he says the scripture says
[1:08:36] he'll do this see that predestinated
[1:08:39] seed was laying there and a prostitute
[1:08:43] that had five husbands and the one she
[1:08:45] was with now wasn't her husband but
[1:08:48] inside of her was a predestinated seed
[1:08:52] Saints now we had all given up on a
[1:08:55] woman like that but Jesus knew what was
[1:08:58] in
[1:08:59] there and when the light Struck it
[1:09:01] brother BR said it came to life you
[1:09:04] can't keep it down you can't hide life
[1:09:07] he said you can take and pour concrete
[1:09:09] upon a bunch of grass and it'll kill it
[1:09:11] in the winter time but the next spring
[1:09:13] where's the most grass hat right around
[1:09:16] the edge of the concrete CA the gerti
[1:09:18] seed under that stone when the sun
[1:09:20] begins to shine you can't hold
[1:09:23] it he said oh it'll wiggle its way
[1:09:26] around through there and come right out
[1:09:28] to the Hedge and stick its head up and
[1:09:30] say glory to the
[1:09:32] god you can't hide life he said when sun
[1:09:36] strikes bottling life it has to live oh
[1:09:38] God say that's what happened to me when
[1:09:41] the sun struck I had to lay I had to oh
[1:09:44] God I had to
[1:09:49] change when a holy spirit strikes the
[1:09:52] scriptural life that's in a man it
[1:09:54] brings forth its fruit right there he
[1:09:57] said oh God and once the light is inside
[1:10:02] of you you become the
[1:10:06] light once the Life of Christ is inside
[1:10:10] the believer the believer then becomes
[1:10:13] the light see he got no hands with your
[1:10:15] hands he ain't got no voice with yours
[1:10:19] he's using you
[1:10:21] now the
[1:10:23] light become comes the life Matthew
[1:10:28] 514 he says ye are the light of the
[1:10:32] world Jesus said ye that's you you are
[1:10:38] the light of the
[1:10:39] world is that what the Bible said Saints
[1:10:42] you are the light of the world and a
[1:10:45] city that's set on a hill cannot be
[1:10:48] hid he said neither do men light a
[1:10:51] candle and put it under a bushel but on
[1:10:53] a Candlestick and it giveth light unto
[1:10:55] all that are in the house he said let
[1:10:58] your light so shine before men that they
[1:11:01] may see your good works and glorify your
[1:11:05] father which is in heaven so he said let
[1:11:08] your light shine before men not so that
[1:11:11] you can get Glory but so that he can get
[1:11:14] Glory whatever God's give you let it
[1:11:17] shine Saints so that you can glorify him
[1:11:20] not so you can puff yourself up or think
[1:11:23] you're something or think you got an
[1:11:24] ability or think you got a talent it all
[1:11:27] comes from him he's the
[1:11:29] light but you let the light shine so you
[1:11:32] can glorify
[1:11:36] him y'all believe that tonight Saints
[1:11:39] and I want you to notice that the closer
[1:11:42] you get to God the more mistakes or
[1:11:45] faults you find out you
[1:11:49] have let me say it again the closer you
[1:11:52] get to God the more takes you find out
[1:11:56] you got see Saints the light shines on
[1:12:00] the Dark Places you know you can paint a
[1:12:03] wall brother Israel and you can think
[1:12:06] that wall looks good until the light
[1:12:08] hits it and when the light hits it you
[1:12:11] realize all the spots you
[1:12:14] missed you can have a Smooth Wall of
[1:12:17] sheetrock and it can look real good
[1:12:19] until the light hits it and you realize
[1:12:22] all the spots that's not that's not
[1:12:24] right
[1:12:26] amen it's like when you sisters when you
[1:12:27] clean the window you think it looks good
[1:12:31] I clean that window it's nice and clean
[1:12:34] and it looks good until the sunlight
[1:12:37] hits it and then you recognize all the
[1:12:40] places that got missed the floor looks
[1:12:42] real good when you sweep it and you
[1:12:44] think it looks good until the light
[1:12:46] comes in and you realize all the filth
[1:12:49] that's still in the
[1:12:50] floor oh come on somebody tonight
[1:12:56] y'all ain't mad cuz we missing a Super
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] Bowl this my Super Bowl right here
[1:13:04] Saints
[1:13:06] amen all right maybe they'll flash some
[1:13:08] score updates or
[1:13:14] something but it looks good until the
[1:13:17] light hits it the floor looks good the
[1:13:21] windows look good the air looks good you
[1:13:23] ever thought the air was clean your
[1:13:25] breathing and then you watch the
[1:13:26] sunlight come in and you see all the
[1:13:29] stuff floating in the air it's the light
[1:13:33] that draws it out and Saint the closer
[1:13:35] you get to God the more in your life
[1:13:38] you'll see that's not pleasing to him oh
[1:13:41] but that don't be condemned by that
[1:13:42] that's a blessing that God is showing
[1:13:45] you the things where you're lacking and
[1:13:47] the things you need to work on that's
[1:13:48] God dealing with us it's the light that
[1:13:51] does that
[1:13:56] and the more light that shines in your
[1:13:58] life the dirtier things
[1:14:01] look Hebrews the 12 chapter says our God
[1:14:04] is a consuming
[1:14:06] fire consuming brother Bram says and
[1:14:09] knoweth it not he said the higher you
[1:14:13] rise in
[1:14:15] God the more sinful the whole thing
[1:14:19] looks and he says and then sometimes in
[1:14:21] prayer you can imagine when the Holy
[1:14:23] Spirit takes you up into a spear he said
[1:14:26] then the whole thing looks chaos the
[1:14:28] higher We rise in God the more sinful
[1:14:32] this world looks the more sinful Our
[1:14:34] Lives will look the more sinful our
[1:14:36] thoughts will
[1:14:38] be oh come on tonight Saints he says but
[1:14:41] if you ever climb into them Spears one
[1:14:43] time where you can be in the presence of
[1:14:45] God not through emotion but through some
[1:14:47] genuine Holy Spirit lifting up the whole
[1:14:49] thing is wrote ikabod the glory of the
[1:14:52] Lord has departed from the whole
[1:14:54] denomination outfit he said that's right
[1:14:56] there's none of them
[1:14:59] right now I want to preface this by
[1:15:01] saying Saints we do not condemn The
[1:15:03] Sinner we condemn the sin we always got
[1:15:06] to have a heart to see a sinner saved to
[1:15:09] see somebody lost that gets found to see
[1:15:12] somebody that's dying that gets saved
[1:15:15] that's always got to be in our heart we
[1:15:17] don't condemn The Sinner it's the sin
[1:15:20] that's in the world that we can't stand
[1:15:23] but if he saved you he can save
[1:15:30] anybody I don't ever want to get so high
[1:15:33] and lifted up that I can't help somebody
[1:15:35] down to the
[1:15:38] altar but don't let the devil beat you
[1:15:41] up about God's program Saints
[1:15:45] condemnation and repentance is God's
[1:15:48] provided
[1:15:51] way now I I get a little worried when
[1:15:54] people don't have
[1:15:55] condemnation when they live any kind of
[1:15:57] way and there's no condemnation on their
[1:15:59] life but Saints for those of us that the
[1:16:02] Lord is condemning thank you Lord he
[1:16:05] just he's dealing with us Saints he
[1:16:08] doesn't want us to continue down the
[1:16:10] path that we're going condemnation is a
[1:16:12] blessing it gives us an opportunity to
[1:16:15] make it
[1:16:16] right and repentance is God's program
[1:16:20] remember Cain couldn't repent
[1:16:25] so thank God we got the
[1:16:28] opportunity now acts
[1:16:31] 2:37 Peter had got up and preached to
[1:16:33] him and he preached hard and he told him
[1:16:37] that the Christ came and you crucified
[1:16:40] him you took his life you buried him but
[1:16:43] God raised him up and the Bible said
[1:16:46] they were pricked in their hearts and
[1:16:48] that means they they were they were cut
[1:16:50] to the heart they were cut they were
[1:16:54] pricked in the their hearts and they
[1:16:56] said to Peter and the rest of the
[1:16:57] Apostles men and Brethren what shall we
[1:16:59] do and then Peter said unto them
[1:17:02] repent that's God's program repent is
[1:17:06] God's program and we're never above
[1:17:09] repentance we're never so high and
[1:17:11] mighty that we can't
[1:17:14] repent repent and be baptized every one
[1:17:17] of you for the in the name of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:17:21] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:24] now brother br said in Hebrews chapter 7
[1:17:26] part two he said the believer can't
[1:17:29] sin the believer can't sin he said the
[1:17:33] seed of God the blessings of God remains
[1:17:36] on him now you say well brother George
[1:17:37] if a Believer can't sin why do we need
[1:17:39] to repent then well brother BR says God
[1:17:42] can't see nothing but the blood of his
[1:17:44] own son no matter what is in his church
[1:17:48] what it is God don't see it because
[1:17:50] Jesus is making intercessions constantly
[1:17:53] the high priest
[1:17:56] see you might see the sin but God don't
[1:17:58] see it you can see all my faults you can
[1:18:02] see all of my failures but God is
[1:18:04] looking through the blood of Jesus
[1:18:09] Christ amen and he says now if you say
[1:18:13] well that gives me a good chance he said
[1:18:15] then that shows you're not
[1:18:17] right see no believer would want to take
[1:18:20] advantage of that no believer would
[1:18:22] would feel great thinking well I can't
[1:18:24] do nothing wrong I can live any way I
[1:18:25] want to no he said that shows you never
[1:18:27] had it to begin with a real believer is
[1:18:30] thankful and grateful that God provided
[1:18:33] that way for
[1:18:34] him he said you'll appreciate it you'll
[1:18:37] love it if you're a real Christian to a
[1:18:39] place that sin would haunt you till you
[1:18:41] couldn't do it he said amen once purged
[1:18:45] by the blood of Jesus has no more to
[1:18:46] desire to sin he said if you have a
[1:18:48] desire your heart's not right with
[1:18:50] God this a part I love right here he
[1:18:53] says now you
[1:18:55] will do
[1:18:59] wrong you will do wrong but you don't do
[1:19:04] it
[1:19:06] willfully see you're
[1:19:08] trapped and anything that you're trapped
[1:19:11] into or do something that you don't mean
[1:19:14] to do it's not sin yet you'll repent the
[1:19:19] minute you see that you're
[1:19:22] wrong now Saints the devil has a way of
[1:19:25] putting a thought in your mind and
[1:19:27] making you think you had
[1:19:30] it he'll he'll tempt you to do something
[1:19:33] and when you do it he'll blame you for
[1:19:35] doing it but brother Brown said that's
[1:19:37] not you're trapped into that that's not
[1:19:39] sin yet you'll repent the minute you
[1:19:41] done
[1:19:45] wrong oh that's shouting material right
[1:19:47] there
[1:19:50] Saints amen he says you'll turn quickly
[1:19:54] and say I didn't mean I see he said
[1:19:57] you'll say that all through life all
[1:20:00] through life he said you'll say that
[1:20:02] well I what if I've been in the message
[1:20:03] 20 years all through life you'll say it
[1:20:06] what about 40 years in the message all
[1:20:08] through life you'll say
[1:20:10] it if I live another hundred years I'm
[1:20:14] GNA say
[1:20:20] that you'll repent the minute you see
[1:20:22] that you're wrong
[1:20:25] amen he says a man don't want to be and
[1:20:28] that's the reason we're so stupid and so
[1:20:30] in the dark down here on Earth that
[1:20:32] there's a blood atonement for us all the
[1:20:36] time to keep us
[1:20:38] covered see it's a light that's shining
[1:20:42] in the darkness that's calling out to
[1:20:44] sin in our lives and bringing about
[1:20:47] repentance this is God's program brother
[1:20:49] Kim this is God's plan Amen to call out
[1:20:52] the sin to call out the sick to call out
[1:20:54] the the dark places in our life and
[1:20:56] bring us to
[1:21:00] repentance he said now there's your
[1:21:02] legalist idea that says oh you know what
[1:21:05] the woman that woman was Sanctified but
[1:21:07] bless God she done wrong I know she
[1:21:09] blacks slid he said she that's a
[1:21:12] legalist idea to say they done wrong I
[1:21:14] know they backslid he said that's wrong
[1:21:16] she's not backslid she made a mistake if
[1:21:19] she did it willfully then she wasn't
[1:21:21] right to begin with if she didn't mean
[1:21:23] to do it and she walks before the Holy
[1:21:26] Church of God and confesses it and say
[1:21:28] I'm wrong and you forgive me you are
[1:21:30] Duty bound to do
[1:21:38] it so if somebody ask for forgiveness he
[1:21:41] said we are Duty bound to forgive
[1:21:45] them he says if you don't do it in your
[1:21:48] heart then you ought to went to the
[1:21:49] altar
[1:21:52] yourself true there is a real Holiness
[1:21:55] in the church there is genuine Holiness
[1:21:59] the Holiness not of you but of Christ I
[1:22:02] have no Holiness to present to him I'm
[1:22:04] trusting in his oh his grace and I have
[1:22:07] it in my heart and I've unmar it nothing
[1:22:09] I do to deserve it but by the grace he
[1:22:11] called me and invited me to
[1:22:14] come the prophet said I make thousands
[1:22:18] of mistakes each month each year surely
[1:22:20] I do but when I say I'm wrong I say God
[1:22:23] I didn't mean to do it you know my heart
[1:22:25] I didn't mean to do that I was trapped
[1:22:27] into that I don't mean to do it you
[1:22:29] forgive me Lord I done wrong to my
[1:22:31] brother I say brother forgive me I
[1:22:33] didn't mean to do
[1:22:34] that there's a blood sacrifice there's
[1:22:38] the power of the Gospel that Holy Church
[1:22:40] moving on not because something you done
[1:22:42] it's something you had nothing to do
[1:22:44] with there's the atonement is
[1:22:46] said oh Saints we're not holy because of
[1:22:49] our good works we're holy because an
[1:22:51] atonement was made and I'm not sinless
[1:22:54] because of my good works I'm sinless
[1:22:56] because I told him it was
[1:22:57] made because of repentance because of
[1:23:01] making it right because of forgiveness
[1:23:04] because of
[1:23:08] Grace oh we're right tonight by
[1:23:12] Grace by the
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:18] blood oh God there's an atonement laying
[1:23:22] there and when we make a mistake we run
[1:23:27] quickly to make it
[1:23:31] right it's not sin yet it's a
[1:23:35] mistake because of an atonement laying
[1:23:40] there it's a
[1:23:42] life of daily
[1:23:45] repentance you can't just clean the
[1:23:48] house once in 1974
[1:23:55] you got to clean it every day you can't
[1:23:59] just wash the dishes once in
[1:24:02] 92 and think you're good you got to wash
[1:24:06] them dishes every day you can't just
[1:24:10] work in the same set of clothes every
[1:24:12] day and never wash them you say well I
[1:24:15] washed them two months
[1:24:17] ago they'll get dirty again Saints the
[1:24:21] dishes get dirty again the house gets
[1:24:23] dirty again you got to sweep that floor
[1:24:26] every
[1:24:29] dayen and after Paul became a Christian
[1:24:33] after Paul saw the lights he said I Die
[1:24:40] daily so
[1:24:42] repentance is always the program of God
[1:24:46] We're Never Getting Beyond it I don't
[1:24:48] want to get Beyond it I want to be right
[1:24:51] I Want to Be Right better than I want to
[1:24:52] look good
[1:24:56] I'd rather be right than I would be
[1:24:59] proud I'd rather get it right and know
[1:25:02] that my heart's rights than to be worry
[1:25:04] about what everybody thinks about
[1:25:08] me amen too many people are ashamed to
[1:25:11] come to the
[1:25:12] altar ashamed to pour their heart out
[1:25:15] ashamed to make it right they're scared
[1:25:16] of what people think about them there a
[1:25:18] whole lot of preachers need to be at the
[1:25:19] altar but they're scared of what people
[1:25:21] think about them saints repentance is is
[1:25:24] God's program yes
[1:25:28] sir we're never above it we're never too
[1:25:31] proud of it look sa there was a little
[1:25:34] woman that had an issue of blood 12
[1:25:36] years and she couldn't get no better and
[1:25:39] she finally said I got to do something
[1:25:42] different and she said I got to get to
[1:25:45] Jesus I got to get to Jesus and she said
[1:25:48] if I can just touch the Hy that you
[1:25:52] can't stand up tall and touch the H you
[1:25:55] got to get down on your knees you got to
[1:25:57] get down low to Touch the Hem of His
[1:26:02] garments you can't stand up and say oh

[1:26:07] blessed me above everybody else you got
[1:26:10] to get down
[1:26:13] low but she said if I can just
[1:26:15] Touch the Hem of His Garment I'll be
[1:26:19] made whole and when she touched it
[1:26:22] Saints Jesus felt it because she came to
[1:26:26] him with the right attitude with the
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:31] heart is that right
[1:26:33] Saints that was a blind
[1:26:37] man named
[1:26:41] barus and he heard that Jesus was
[1:26:44] passing
[1:26:46] by and he shouted out have mercy on me

[1:27:41] me and if somebody tries to quieten you
[1:27:45] down cry out the more yes oh you don't
[1:27:49] need to go down there what's people
[1:27:51] going to think if you go down there
[1:27:53] what's people going to think
[1:27:54] they're going to think you're a sinner
[1:27:56] well sa we was all
[1:27:59] Sinners ain't none of us good not one
[1:28:03] but by the mercy of Jesus Christ and the
[1:28:07] grace of almighty
[1:28:10] God we can be
[1:28:13] perfect so the
[1:28:16] condemnation is not a sign that you
[1:28:18] aren't a
[1:28:19] Believer but a work of the holy spirit
[1:28:23] in your life life oh come on
[1:28:27] somebody see
[1:28:29] Angels can't Worship the Lord the way he
[1:28:32] wants to be
[1:28:33] worshiped because inside of him was the
[1:28:37] attributes to be a Healer well an angel
[1:28:39] ain't never been
[1:28:42] sick inside of him was the attribute to
[1:28:46] be a savior but an angel never was
[1:28:49] lost inside of him was an attribute to
[1:28:53] be a provider was an attribute to give
[1:28:55] you peace was an you know the SC compel
[1:28:58] Redemptive names was an attribute to
[1:29:00] provide your needs well an angel didn't
[1:29:02] need nothing but we are the only ones
[1:29:05] the redeemed are the only ones that can
[1:29:08] worship God in his attributes that can
[1:29:11] worship God the way he wants to be
[1:29:13] worshiped I'm you're the only one that
[1:29:16] can say thank you Lord for saving me an
[1:29:19] angel can't save
[1:29:20] that you're the only one that can say
[1:29:23] thank you Lord for my healing thank you
[1:29:26] Lord for my Deliverance thank you Lord
[1:29:29] for providing for my needs you're the
[1:29:31] only one can do it it's a song Holy
[1:29:35] Angels can't
[1:29:40] sing Jehovah Gyra he says now you're
[1:29:43] talking about somewhere that you think
[1:29:45] you've done something that you can't get
[1:29:48] back to
[1:29:49] God he says look at Abraham out there
[1:29:53] look what he done
[1:29:54] lying about his wife now Saints if
[1:29:58] you've gone too far you don't have a
[1:30:01] feeling to try to get back to
[1:30:04] God if you have a desire to get closer
[1:30:08] to God then it shows God is still
[1:30:11] dealing with you he said blessed are
[1:30:13] they that do hunger and thirst for
[1:30:16] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:30:18] now when you go past the point of being
[1:30:21] redeemable it's like that little woman
[1:30:22] that said I could watch my mama's soul
[1:30:25] frying hell like a pancake and laugh
[1:30:27] about
[1:30:28] it but as long as God's still dealing
[1:30:31] with you as long as God is still
[1:30:34] condemning you as long as he's still
[1:30:37] working on you as long as he's still
[1:30:39] showing you where you need to step up
[1:30:41] showing you the things where you're
[1:30:42] fallen short you can say thank you Lord
[1:30:45] thank you
[1:30:47] Lord I'm looking for
[1:30:50] Perfection amen
[1:30:54] we all do brother Rick he said he said
[1:30:57] setting up on one side he said talk
[1:31:00] about Abraham said he was backslid and
[1:31:03] he said any Jew that goes out of
[1:31:04] Palestine is backslid and he says amalec
[1:31:08] might have been a good Holiness man for
[1:31:10] all I know but God said I'll not answer
[1:31:13] your prayer but my husband uh that
[1:31:17] husband of hers is my
[1:31:19] Prophet God told Amil you ain't done
[1:31:23] nothing wrong
[1:31:24] but I still won't hear your prayer
[1:31:26] because the seed of God lays inside of
[1:31:31] Abraham that husband of hers he said is
[1:31:34] my prophet and if you don't take him his
[1:31:36] wife back and let him pray for you
[1:31:38] you're as good as a dead man that's what
[1:31:41] it means for you and I that the seed of
[1:31:43] God remains in
[1:31:45] us he said that's God keeping his
[1:31:48] promise to the Seed of Abraham can you
[1:31:50] see healing is yours salvation is your
[1:31:53] yours it's a free gift of God that God
[1:31:57] gave you and called you and chose you
[1:32:01] before the foundation of the world he
[1:32:03] chose you you're his
[1:32:07] air oh aren't you thankful tonight
[1:32:10] Saints he says you say but brother
[1:32:12] brandom I made a mistake last week or
[1:32:15] last month I don't care how many
[1:32:17] mistakes you make we've all sinned and
[1:32:19] come short of the glory if you're a
[1:32:20] child of Abraham you're ready to
[1:32:23] recognize that as Sin and come back to
[1:32:26] God again and God's mercy still hangs to
[1:32:30] you oh so grateful for his
[1:32:35] Mercy see the message can't be done to
[1:32:39] you it's got to live through
[1:32:43] you you can't do the message to
[1:32:46] somebody you can't force them into a box
[1:32:50] and make them live the message and make
[1:32:52] them it's just a book of rules to them
[1:32:55] it can't be done to them it's got to
[1:32:57] live through them when they get the
[1:32:58] light on the inside the light is the
[1:33:01] life and the light will produce the life
[1:33:04] on the inside and then it ain't done to
[1:33:06] them it's living through
[1:33:10] them now if you got children you got to
[1:33:15] be their Holy Ghost until they get it
[1:33:17] yourself is that
[1:33:19] right now we don't preach the Holy Ghost
[1:33:23] like it's a one-time occurrence you
[1:33:26] can't say well praise God the Holy Ghost
[1:33:28] blessed me back in
[1:33:30] 1970 we're talking about baptism after
[1:33:35] baptism we're talking about one light
[1:33:38] after another light after another light
[1:33:40] after another light sa every time we
[1:33:43] come to the house of the Lord we ought
[1:33:44] to be feeling the presence of the Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost in our
[1:33:48] life and the Holy Ghost is what calls
[1:33:51] out the dark places
[1:33:57] now in the Old Testament the Mana fell
[1:33:59] fresh every
[1:34:01] day now that's that's a type of the word
[1:34:04] it's like when the word's Fallen today
[1:34:07] and when it does we get blessed are you
[1:34:10] blessed by the word Saints the word is a
[1:34:13] blessing and when a word is being
[1:34:15] preached it blesses the people like the
[1:34:18] man of Fallen but brother Brown said
[1:34:20] that that they they got that blessing
[1:34:22] but then long about 9 or 10:00 that that
[1:34:25] the Mana was dried
[1:34:26] up and they started getting hungry
[1:34:30] again and Saints you can have a good
[1:34:33] service in the
[1:34:35] morning but but but Along by evening
[1:34:37] time you ought to be getting hungry
[1:34:41] again you can have a good service
[1:34:43] Wednesday but by Sunday you ought to be
[1:34:45] looking for another good service by by
[1:34:48] Sunday night by Wednesday night by
[1:34:49] Sunday Morning by Sunday night we ought
[1:34:52] to be looking for another re
[1:34:54] feeling now is that
[1:34:57] right he said but when that Mana was put
[1:35:00] into the Ark of the Covenant inside the
[1:35:03] holiest of holies it never got old it
[1:35:06] never ran
[1:35:08] out Jehovah Gyra he said so many people
[1:35:11] think today because they have received
[1:35:14] the Holy Ghost that settles
[1:35:19] it when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:21] you're just getting started Saints
[1:35:23] you're just getting ready for service
[1:35:25] but they don't settle it that's not the
[1:35:28] end of it there's more of it there's
[1:35:31] more of God than what we have there's
[1:35:33] more of God than what we know right now
[1:35:35] there's more of God for do you Hunger
[1:35:37] for More Of God faith is a substance of
[1:35:40] things hoped for the evidence of who's
[1:35:43] got a favorite food in
[1:35:46] here all right brother Warren what's
[1:35:48] your favorite food steak oh God me too
[1:35:52] it's man after my own heart right there
[1:35:54] here now if you've ever had a longing
[1:35:59] for a big old fine
[1:36:02] steak the longing that you have is the
[1:36:06] evidence that there is a stake to
[1:36:11] respond let let me say it like this you
[1:36:14] couldn't want a
[1:36:16] stake unless there was a stake somewhere
[1:36:19] to respond for that
[1:36:25] I don't they don't get it brother Israel
[1:36:27] all right all right so let's say fried
[1:36:30] chicken let's say that you got a longing
[1:36:34] for a piece of fried chicken the longing
[1:36:37] that you have for fried chicken is what
[1:36:40] proves that there is a fried chicken
[1:36:44] because you can't want something that
[1:36:46] don't
[1:36:47] exist if there wasn't no Fried Chicken
[1:36:50] then you wouldn't know what she missing
[1:36:51] oh but once you taste it one time you
[1:36:54] say I got to have some more of it and
[1:36:57] faith is the substance of thing hoped
[1:36:59] for and the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:37:03] so if you have a desire in your heart
[1:37:06] tonight for more of God it's the
[1:37:08] evidence that there is a God and He does
[1:37:11] exist and he's a rewarder of those that
[1:37:13] diligently seek Him faith is a substance
[1:37:16] faith is an Evidence the reason I know
[1:37:19] there's more God is because I have a
[1:37:21] desire for more of God it's it's the
[1:37:23] Deep calling to the
[1:37:33] deep I like steak butter and fried
[1:37:35] chicken brother
[1:37:37] War but I like fried chicken
[1:37:41] too he said you just beginning you
[1:37:43] haven't started yet
[1:37:45] hardly he said the people picked up this
[1:37:49] little Mana which was the type of the
[1:37:52] Holy Spirit
[1:37:54] Christ he said they come down and give
[1:37:57] his life for the world and they took
[1:37:59] this and made it into cakes and eat it
[1:38:02] but many time they found out by 9 or
[1:38:04] 10:00 they were getting
[1:38:06] hungry and he said that's the way many
[1:38:09] people think today in a great big
[1:38:12] Revival they come all pepped up you know
[1:38:15] and as soon as the Revival's over down
[1:38:18] they go again have to come back and
[1:38:21] maybe repent again and come back to
[1:38:24] church and take their vows over and some
[1:38:26] of them wants to be re-baptized again or
[1:38:28] something like that some religious
[1:38:30] service to be done to them to try to
[1:38:33] boost them along he said those people
[1:38:36] are never
[1:38:38] happy see we know people like this
[1:38:41] Saints we've seen this over the years
[1:38:43] people that can make it from revival to
[1:38:45] Revival they go from Mountain toop to
[1:38:48] Mountaintop but between the mountain
[1:38:51] tops they're so low they barely make it
[1:38:53] in on two
[1:38:57] wheels and I believe in revivals I
[1:39:00] believe in Holy Ghost services but you
[1:39:03] can't live on the mountain toop you got
[1:39:05] to learn how to make it in the
[1:39:09] valley if you're just relying on the
[1:39:12] mountain top he said those people are
[1:39:14] never
[1:39:15] happy got to make it from camp meeting
[1:39:17] to camp
[1:39:19] meeting he says but the man who goes on
[1:39:22] the inside where this golden Mana part
[1:39:25] of Mana was he it'll never run out it
[1:39:29] never got old it never diminished the
[1:39:32] man who lived there had Victory all the
[1:39:35] time is that what you're looking for
[1:39:36] tonight Saints I don't want to be up and
[1:39:39] down in and out praising the Lord one
[1:39:41] minute and then I can't hardly make it
[1:39:43] to church the next I'm discouraged this
[1:39:45] time I'm encouraged this time then I'm
[1:39:47] discouraged again that's never a way to
[1:39:49] be happy but I'm looking for a s
[1:39:53] solid daily
[1:39:59] life then he talks about the light he
[1:40:01] said watch the different light he said
[1:40:04] the people out in the courts they walked
[1:40:07] by the sunlight and he says the trouble
[1:40:10] with that was he says they walk by the
[1:40:12] Sunlight Moonlight Stars he said that
[1:40:15] light that the solar system give he says
[1:40:17] well in there sometimes they had dark
[1:40:20] days cloudy days rainy days
[1:40:24] and he Likens that to
[1:40:26] justification and he said then he said
[1:40:29] there's a man who lived in the Holy
[1:40:31] place by the altar he said that's
[1:40:33] sanctification he said he said at the
[1:40:36] altar represents sanctification he said
[1:40:40] there they had light they didn't have to
[1:40:42] depend on the sun and the moon and the
[1:40:44] stars they had the seven candlesticks
[1:40:47] that gave them light see there was in
[1:40:49] the church ages then they had the seven
[1:40:51] candlesticks that gave them light he
[1:40:53] said but many times they smoked up and
[1:40:56] went
[1:40:58] out that's why it's not good enough to
[1:41:00] say I know God sent a
[1:41:02] prophet that that's that you're just
[1:41:04] living by the candlesticks and they can
[1:41:06] get smoked up of course God sent a
[1:41:09] prophet but it's not good enough to say
[1:41:13] I I believe the message is true of
[1:41:15] course the message is true but Satan
[1:41:18] knows this message is true he says but
[1:41:21] when they went into the holiest of
[1:41:23] holies those veils Dro behind Aaron once
[1:41:27] a year and they didn't have live by no
[1:41:29] Moonlight Starlight or seven golden
[1:41:32] candlesticks under the interlocking
[1:41:34] wings of the cherubin the shakina glory
[1:41:37] was in there and they lived in that
[1:41:39] light which never did diminish or go
[1:41:43] out they lived by the pot of Mana that
[1:41:48] they could eat at any time they wanted
[1:41:51] to it never got hold old Saints it don't
[1:41:54] matter whether I got church tonight or
[1:41:56] not I can still live by the Mana it
[1:41:59] don't matter if I'm going to be in
[1:42:01] service or not I can still eat of the
[1:42:04] Mana anytime I want I got it on my phone
[1:42:08] I got it in this Bible I got it on
[1:42:12] tape and I'm living by it
[1:42:15] daily come on somebody it don't get old
[1:42:19] we can't wait from church service to
[1:42:21] church service to eat
[1:42:30] and when it's in the shakana glory it
[1:42:33] never gets old to you you don't ever get
[1:42:35] tired of
[1:42:36] it I heard a tape today I want to hear
[1:42:39] another one I've read my Bible today but
[1:42:42] I want to read it again I got a desire
[1:42:44] for more of it because it's in the Shak
[1:42:47] kind of Glory that quickens the words of
[1:42:49] my life
[1:42:53] and then it's not just words of a
[1:42:55] prophet or words on a tape or words in a
[1:42:58] Bible it's the living breathing word
[1:43:00] living in you working through
[1:43:08] you that's the Shak of
[1:43:12] Glory so
[1:43:15] justification
[1:43:17] it's it's not the evidence of the Holy
[1:43:19] Ghost it's a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:24] condemnation it's a work of the Holy
[1:43:27] Ghost
[1:43:29] sanctification it's a work of the Holy
[1:43:31] Ghost now none of them are evidences of
[1:43:34] it healing Deliverance love joy peace
[1:43:38] none of them are evidence of the Holy
[1:43:40] Ghost but they're all works of the Holy
[1:43:42] Ghost now is that right but it takes the
[1:43:46] shakina glory the prophet said to ripen
[1:43:49] this word and that's why people can't
[1:43:52] understand the message because they're
[1:43:54] just reading it off of paper and they
[1:43:57] can't understand the Bible because
[1:43:58] they're trying to read it like a
[1:43:59] dictionary but it takes the shakina
[1:44:02] glory to Quicken this
[1:44:06] word unveiling of God he said the
[1:44:08] shakina glory manifests him it brings
[1:44:12] forth the Word of Promise right out of
[1:44:16] you where's the word come
[1:44:19] from what did he say did it come from
[1:44:22] the Bible
[1:44:23] it come out of
[1:44:25] you you are the
[1:44:28] light that's the reason he had to Veil
[1:44:30] Moses face because in him was the word
[1:44:34] where was the word it was in Moses
[1:44:36] where's the word it's in
[1:44:41] you and he veils himself today in Earth
[1:44:44] and vessels with the
[1:44:46] shikina amen he says and it ripens the
[1:44:49] shoe bread that we Feast on
[1:44:53] it takes the Holy Ghost to ripen the
[1:44:57] shoe bread that we're feasting on and
[1:45:00] that's why some people can listen to the
[1:45:02] tape and can't get nothing out of it
[1:45:04] some people can read the Bible and can't
[1:45:06] get nothing out of it because it takes
[1:45:08] the shakina of Glory to ripen the shoe
[1:45:11] bread and that's what we're missing in
[1:45:13] the message today we got the word in
[1:45:15] head knowledge but we need the shakina
[1:45:18] glory to ripen the word
[1:45:24] he said that shakina Glory over the shoe
[1:45:26] bread kept it from
[1:45:28] spoiling amen once you get to shakina
[1:45:31] Glory it don't matter that the message
[1:45:33] was preached in 63 or 64 or 65 or 57 40
[1:45:40] it it don't matter Saints because it
[1:45:42] don't get bad it don't get wiggle tails
[1:45:44] in it it don't spoil it's still the
[1:45:46] Living Word of
[1:45:48] God outside of the Shan Glory it's just
[1:45:51] a message of the prophet but inside the
[1:45:54] sh kind of Glory it's the words of life
[1:45:56] it's Hebrews
[1:46:00] 138 he talks about sunflower seeds that
[1:46:03] they got out of the Garners in Egypt he
[1:46:06] said in the days of Joseph 4,000 years
[1:46:08] ago he said put them in the Garner they
[1:46:11] planted them and they lived 4,000 year
[1:46:14] old sunflower seeds and they planted
[1:46:17] them and they live why he said they had
[1:46:19] life
[1:46:24] I don't care how long you've been going
[1:46:26] brother Rick when a light Struck it
[1:46:30] brought forth
[1:46:32] life there's a seed land in
[1:46:35] there now you might be 20 years old when
[1:46:37] you give your heart to the Lord might be
[1:46:38] 12 years old when you give your heart to
[1:46:40] the Lord might be 70 years old when you
[1:46:42] give your heart to the Lord it don't
[1:46:43] matter when the light strikes it don't
[1:46:46] matter how long the seed's been laying
[1:46:47] there when the Shak of Glory strikes the
[1:46:50] seed it brings forth life
[1:46:59] he said to break Beyond the Veil to see
[1:47:02] God Is Standing before you see who God
[1:47:05] is standing here before us he said the
[1:47:07] pillar of fire he is veiled in human
[1:47:10] flesh he said but what does the Shak
[1:47:13] glor what it do he said the shoe breed
[1:47:15] seed the word that we're to live on this
[1:47:19] day by these promises the shakana glory
[1:47:23] ripens that shoe bread oh do you believe
[1:47:26] that today it brings it to pass makes it
[1:47:29] bread to the believer that laid in the
[1:47:32] pages of the Bible year after year the
[1:47:36] word for this age see Saints brother
[1:47:39] brandham didn't bring no words that
[1:47:40] wasn't already in the Bible amen he just
