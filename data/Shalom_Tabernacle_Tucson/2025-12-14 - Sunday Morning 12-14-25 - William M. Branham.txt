========================================

Good morning everyone. Can we all stand? We'll open up in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to be here this morning. Lord Jesus, another opportunity, another day, Lord, in your presence. Pray this morning, Lord, that we be seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Lord, that you just bless the things that we're about to hear, Lord. Let them go deep within our heart, Father, that would bring forth the fruit that you desire, Lord. We look forward to that day, Lord, for an entrance into thy kingdom, Lord. And we want to prepare our hearts today that when we shall appear before you, it'll be with joy and confidence and full assurance. Lord Jesus, bless the Sunday school children in their class, Lord. those um things that would be done in this house of worship today, Lord, and the um those that are on the way, Lord, brother Israel, as he would be speaking uh to those in in in Mesa, Father, and we just give you all the praise and the glory for it. [music] In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask. Amen. We're going to be continuing with what was the Holy Ghost given for. We'll start at the paragraph 32 and end after 55. This is going to be about 20 minutes and so we're grateful for that. Let's sing only believe. Only believe. [singing and music] Only [singing] believe. All things are possible. Only [singing and music] believe. Only [singing and music] believe. only believe all things [singing and music] are possible only. [singing] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated. Brother Brandon, &gt;&gt; Christ poured himself into the church. Therefore, now watch, at that day you will know that I am in the Father and you are in me and I am in you. At that day you'll know it. &gt;&gt; For it's the whole thing is one plan of redemption. &gt;&gt; Amen. coming down that God coming back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning. Now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions, gets his church to a place that he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship. Then there'll come a Eden. He'll take his church back to where it left to an Eden again. There where it fell. It That's where it made its first start to fall. That's where it'll be taken right back with ever clean slate of redemption, bringing them straight back to that place again. The church has been in the world for some time and the church really after the reformation of 1500 years of dark ages. Luther was the first reformer to come forth after the round of the apostles. And then when Luther come forth, God tipped up a little bit of the spirit and poured it out upon the church in justification. And then in the days of Wesley, he poured out a little more of himself into sanctification. And as the age has grown on to the end time, God has been filling his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just look around and find out if that's truth or not. &gt;&gt; Look at the Lutheran age. You who read history, look at their revival and what they did. Look how much greater the Wesley revival was. How much more power they had but in the minority. Watch in the days of Pentecost. What a revival they had than. What a great wide sweeping to our Sunday visitor the Catholic paper give confession that the Pentecostals produced 1,500,000 conversions in one year. &gt;&gt; I've done all rested churches together. The Catholic only change claimed a million and their own Sunday visitor. The paper called the Sunday visitor gave statement that the Pentecostals outrun them. And remember, Pentecostal conversions is Holy Ghost filled conversions in the minority to start with on the side of the alley out there with a little guitar and women couldn't even afford a pair of stockings laying out on the railroad tracks and picking up corn and mashing and making bread for their children. Well, what's it come to? &gt;&gt; The most powerful standing church in the world today. Not in the eyes of the world, but in the eyes of God because he proves it with what he's doing for them. &gt;&gt; He's pouring himself into them. &gt;&gt; Pouring it in. &gt;&gt; Notice now what taking place. God pouring himself into them. Now the church has got to a place from Luther Wesley and the revivals on to Pentecost and now into this age that we're coming now by the same Holy Spirit just more of it. Now when them Lutheranss back there got saved they got a potion of the Holy Spirit. When the Methodists got sanctified that was a work of the Holy Spirit. See, it was a part of the Holy Spirit. They without us are not made perfect, says the scripture. See, now God as the light has be to shine in the last days, he is expecting us a great thing from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because where there is much given, there's much required. &gt;&gt; So he's going to require much more of us than he did of the Lutherans of the Methodists. because we walk in a greater life with a greater power with a greater uh a greater witness than they had. Now we have a greater witness of the resurrection. We have things more firmer, more sure than they had. But it's just like I said to a Lutheran college not long ago. They said, "What have we got?" I said, "A man planted a field of corn. The first little blades come up." He said, "Thank the Lord for a crop of corn." Potentially he had it, but he only had it in the early farm by and by it become a stalk and a tossel come out on it, which was Methodist. If you'll watch nature, you'll see God working. &gt;&gt; There's a secret lines there that even goes with my ministry. See that watching nature see how it does what age and what time you see where you're living watch the age now then the Methodists they were tossles they looked back to the Luther and said we got sanctification you haven't got nothing in it by from that pollen from the Methodists come forth a grain of ear corn that was Pentecost there you are justification one stage of it. Sanctification, another stage of it, the Holy Spirit, another stage of it, Pentecost, Luther, Wesley, Pentecost. Now, what does Pentecost I liken it? Because in Pentecost, it brought back not a green leaf, not a tossel, but the corn cannot say to the tossel, I don't have no use of you. Or the tossel can't say to the the leaf, I have no use of you. Because the same life that was in the leaf made the tsel. The same life was in the tossel made the ear. &gt;&gt; And it was the Lutheran church that made the Wesley church. It was the Wesley church that made Pentecost. &gt;&gt; But Pentecost, what is it? It's a restoration of the same kind of a grain that went into the ground at the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. bringing back all the fullness of the power of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, in the last days, oh, it's a great thing to to believe and to look at. Now, in this age that we're now living, this age, it's beyond Pentecost. Pentecost has settled itself into organizations and started thinking whole lot about organizations. We are this and we are that. That's just nature. You just can't help it. It's nature. They'll do that. It's the plan for them to do that. But the church has moved on. It's gone into greater, more powerful. It's a restoration of gifts. And many Pentecostal people does not believe in divine healing, ministry of angels and powers of God. Many Pentecostals calls these visions that I see the devil. Many organizations won't even have nothing to do with it in Pentecost. See, we've moved beyond that. Just as Methodists call Pentecostal crazy for speaking in tongues, just as Lutheran called Methodists crazy for shouting. See, but it's all a coming forth out of the Holy Spirit to the great churches being filled up and chug full. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the great powers of Almighty God until it's got to a place until the very works that Jesus done is manifest itself right in the church. Now, &gt;&gt; we're close, friends. Let me stop here just for a minute to get what God put the Holy Ghost in the church for. Give you another type. So what you'll know back in the Old Testament when a a child a man made himself a home he got his bride. That's the first thing. Then he become a great man like an organization. That was good. The next thing happened there come a birth into that home. That's when the Holy Spirit, see, another spirit came in which was a son. That son, he was not in full charge. Neither was he a heir until he got a certain age. And he had to be proved first. Yes. And then they had the law of adoption. To you ministers, the placing of a son is what I'm speaking of now. Then when he come to a place to where he was adopted, Jesus gave a beautiful illustration of it on Mount Transfiguration. As I said, God will never go outside of his laws to do anything. &gt;&gt; If you got an artisian well on this hill growing water all over the air and on this other hill over here, you've got a crop burning up, you can stand on this hill and holler, "Oh, water, run over here and fill my crop." Oh, water. Get to the my crop. It'll never do it. But if you'll work according to the laws of gravitation, you can water that crop. &gt;&gt; You've got a sick man laying here or a sinner laying here or a man that wants to be right. Can't give up drinking. Can't give up smoking. Can't give up lust and then if you'll just work according to the laws of God, let the Holy Spirit come in there, then he's no more his own. He He will stop that thing because the Holy Spirit takes him over. &gt;&gt; But you've got to work according to the laws of God, the rules of God. Now, in the Old Testament, when this baby was born, they watched it to see how it was behaved behavior. Then the father being a great businessman by this time, maybe in his 40s or 50s, he didn't have time to teach this baby himself. So he got in them days, they didn't have public schools as they have now. So they got what they called a tutor or a razor school teacher. And this school teacher was the best he could find so that he'd be truthful and tell the father the truth about it. And then when this boy got to certain age, say he was mature, if that boy was just a renegade, no good, didn't care for the father's business, all he thought about was flirting and running with the women's or or drinking or gambling or horse racing, that boy would always be a son, but he was never placed in position to have heir to all his father had. But if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business and he proved to be the right child, then they had a ceremony. They took the boy out into the street and put a white robe on him and they set him up on a scaffold so all the city could see. They made a feast and a jubilee. And the father then had the ceremony of adoption. He adopted his own son into his own business and then the son was co-equal with his father. In other words, if it been today, the son's name on the check was just as good as the daddy's. Now, watch what God did when his son was born. He let him go for 30 years testing him, trying him. Then he give him third three years of hard trial. And then at the end of the hard trial when he seen that his son was about the father's business, Mount Transfiguration, book of Luke, he taught Peter, James, and John three witnesses and went up on top of the mountain. And there God performed the laws of adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. He they looked up and they seen Jesus and his clothes shined as white as the lightning &gt;&gt; and as the cloud overshadowed him. &gt;&gt; And a voice come out of the cloud and said, "This is my beloved son. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; I'll sit down now and have no more to say. what he says is law and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the church has come through those schools. She married back a long time ago and become a denomination, an organization. But you notice the birth produced something else. And now it's got to a place to where the Pentecostal church with the new birth has been tested and tried. And now it's coming to a place God doesn't deal with the church as just an organization. He doesn't deal with the church as a a group of people. He deals with the church as an individuals. Each individual in the church and now it's got to a time and it's no secret. We all see it. When a man proves and God loves him, he takes him out somewhere to himself. there in the front of angels. &gt;&gt; He does something for him. He lifts him up there in the presence of God &gt;&gt; and gifts him and fills him and sets him out. &gt;&gt; That's the age that we're living in. Same Holy Spirit that saved the Lutheran, that sanctified the Methodists, that baptized the Pentecostals, is now setting an order. the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave. There will be a resurrection. That's what the Holy Ghost is for. What is the Holy Ghost? Without us, they cannot be made perfect. They lived in one day. Under that, we live in another day. When the enemy comes in like a flood, I'll the spirit of God will raise a standard against it. See, we're in a day now back there that wasn't half as smart as the day they could make an atomic bomb or an automobile. They didn't have science and things as we have now, but and things of mysterious things to try to say man blowed together by some dust and so forth and take some analysis and try to prove it to make infidels out of people. But now when we need it, the spirit of God raises a standard. What is He's pouring in his spirit. Then those who are resting out down in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying. How long Lord? &gt;&gt; How long? &gt;&gt; How much longer &gt;&gt; God's waiting on me and you? &gt;&gt; The church is waiting on me and you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adoption time. And God can pour into us his fullness, his power, his resurrection, that when the church and Christ become so close together, Christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead and we go into the rapture. Now, we're going to say show at that just those who are filled with the Holy Ghost goes in that rapture for the rest of the dead live not for the space of a thousand years. That's right. Just Holy Spiritfilled people was all went in the rapture. Now, God gave the Holy Spirit. I got another scripture here in John 14:12. That's a very familiar scripture with all the people here at tabernacle. Verily, verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, now don't let that word believeth kindly set you back in a nominal church say yes I believe. Sure I believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. The devil believes the same thing. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The Bible said he does. But the scripture says in John that no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You've actually by the scripture, let me stop here just a minute before finish reading. You are not converted until you've received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. You are believing unto the Holy Spirit has spoke to you and you publicly confessed him. The devil has the same thing. I believe him to be the son of God. So does the devil. But you're walking on towards you. when Peter had been called and justified by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. And in John 17:17, Jesus sanctified them through the word for the word was the truth and he was the word. First John says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. He was the word." So he sanctified them. He said, "Father," speaking to the spirit in him, "I sanctify them to the word &gt;&gt; himself by laying his hands upon them. Thy word is the truth, just merely spoken into existence in the womb of a woman. Oh, totally impossible for him to be any other way than this word of God to make him manifest. I sanctify them. He gave them power against unclean spirits. They went out. He put their names in the lamb's book of life. And he sent them out. John uh Matthew 10. And gave them power over unclean spirits, cast out evil spirits, and do works and so forth. And they come back rejoicing. He said, "Even the devils is subject to us." He said, "Don't rejoice because the devils is subject unto you, but rejoice because your name's in the book." And Judas was with them. See how close he can come right on up through justification, move right on into sanctification. But where did he show his light? Where did he show himself before Pentecost? He showed his colors. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. away. Hallelujah. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Hallelujah. Heat. [music] to be happy Hallelujah. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

Lord, that you would walk amongst your people, Lord. We don't believe that's a thing of the past.

[applause and cheering] You can be seated if you'd like. This morning, I mentioned the Kathy's were visiting with us this morning. They've stayed with us the last couple nights. And I had a song request from [music] little Nolan this morning. He came in singing Sunday morning when this life is or I will fly away. He said, "Can we sing that this morning? Can we sing I'll fly away?" So, I may not have gotten quite the words quite right, but some glad morning when this [music] life is over, I'll fly away. Some glad morning when this life [singing] is over, [music] I'll fly away to a home on God's celestial shore. [music] I'll fly away. Oh, I [music and singing] fly away. Oh, glory. I'll fly my way. [music] I won't die. [singing] Hallelujah. By [music] the fly [singing] away. And where the shadows of this life have blown all the way [music and singing] from prison bars has gone [music] on thy way. Oh my [music and singing] way. Oh, glory by way. Oh, [music] I won't have hallelujah by I'll fly away. [music and singing] Oh, and just a few more weary days [music and singing] on my way. to [music] a [singing] land where joy shall never fly away. [music and singing] Oh, fly away. Oh, glory. [singing] [music] Fly away. Oh, I won't die. Hallelujah. [music and singing] by fly [singing] away. [music] Well, you ask me why I'm happy. [music] [singing] Oh, so I'll just tell you why because my [singing and music] sins are gone. And when I meet the scoffers who ask me [music and singing] where they are, I say my sins are gone. [music and singing] Well, they're beneath the blood [music] on the cross of Calvary. As far [singing] as darkness is the dawn [music] in the sea of God's moment that's good enough for me. Praise [music and singing] God. My sins are gone. It was [singing] at the old time altar where God came in my heart. [singing and music] And now my sins are gone. The Lord [singing] took full possession. [music] The devil did the Oh, I'm so glad my sins are gone. They [music] run underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. Just as far [music and singing] removed from the darkness is the dawn in [music and singing] the sea of God's forgetfulness. That's good enough for me. Praise [music and singing] God. My sins are gone. Now when Satan comes to temp [singing] me [music] and tries to make me down, &gt;&gt; I [music and singing] say my sins are gone. You got me into [music] trouble, but Jesus got me out. I'm so glad my sins [music] are gone. There was in the blood [singing] on the cross of Calvary [music] as far removed as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's [music] forgone. [singing] [music] Well, I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy night and day because [music and singing] my sins are gone. My soul is filled with music [music] with all my heart. [singing] Hallelujah. I know my sins are gone. [singing] Well, they're all [music] underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary. As [music] far as darkness is from dawn in the sea of God's forgiveness. That's good [music and singing] enough for me. Praise God. My sins are gone. Oh, [singing] they're underneath the blood. They're all underneath the blood [music] on the cross of Calvary. as far [singing] alone as darkness is [music] from in the sea of God's forgiveness. That's good enough for me. Praise God. [music and singing] Praise God. Praise God. My [music] sins are gone. [applause] Hallelujah. Amen. And if you have that revelation, then you will have a smile on your face this morning. People say, "Why are you so happy? The world's falling around around you. We know what's going on in your life. Why are you smiling? How are you surviving?" It's like, "Because I know who holds tomorrow. I know who has everything under control. I know what he's done in my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, Lord, you've surely been good to me." I think we can all say that this morning. He's given us so much more than we deserve. Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely [music] been good to me. Oh [singing] Lord, Lord, Lord, you surely been [music] good to me. Oh Lord, [singing] you surely been [music] good to me. You have done what this world could not do.

You surely you fil me with the Holy Ghost. You surely, [music] oh Lord. Yes, my Lord. You surely been good to me. Oh Lord, [music and singing] Lord, you surely been good to me. Yes, Lord.

So remember them and their travels home today. He'll be here tonight, planning to be here tonight. So we just miss him and appreciate him and pray for him this morning. For Sunday school, we had 12 children, nine Bibles and three daughters. We sure appreciate our Sunday school teachers and we want to remember them in our prayers too. Sister Elise, Sister Heather helps out. Joseph and Trevor have been helping out the under the older class. So remember them. For announcements, there's choir at three today. So if you have half of the singing voice, I think it's three. I saw a wife's uh wse a little bit. I think it's three, but we'll confirm that. So please if you can participate [music] in that be here for that today we'll be listening to the paradox this morning something that's unbelievable but it's true this morning brother John was singing my sins are gone it's uh the most great the greatest miracle so so thankful that tonight I know there's a temptation I've done it go out I get distracted and um I like to check on the parking lot and different things but let's just focus and be right in you know the word is so [music] precise it didn't say brother Chuck in the days of the seventh Angel, it said in the days of the voice. And that's what we get to hear today. And so it's for you. It's for me. It was timely. It was meant to be today for you. For me. So let's just hear and enter in and enjoy the word of the Lord this morning. God bless you. Let's sing. Only believe. Only believe. Only [music] believe. All things [music] are possible on the day.

Confess it this morning. Jesus is here. Oh [singing and music] Jesus is here. All things are Jesus. Yes, [music and singing] Jesus is here. [music] Jesus is here. All [music and singing] things are possible for Jesus is here. Amen. You can be seated. God's voice. Brother Random. Now, the reason I was gone at this time, I'd had a week of fasting and prayer, which had led me to have a decision. And I got a little switch. You're supposed to be somewhere sensor censor what I didn't want. Oh, here we are. This is it. Uh, what want on tape and what you don't want on tape. So, brethren, if your tape's a little messed up, well, don't you can cut that part out now in there. That way, so many taken when uh brother mercenary and them had the only ones who could take tapes while I'd have them to censor them out there before I let them go out. But, u in this anybody can take them now. You see, anybody that wants to take them can take them. And so, I I have to censor myself from this switch right here. what I don't want to say or let go out over the tapes cuz there's some things I could tell you all here that certainly wouldn't want to get out with the people cuz let them alone the blind leads the blind they all fall in the ditch anyhow you see so just don't offend them like Jesus said don't offend them Pharisees said if they want some if they want some tribute money go down and cast a hook in the sea and get the first fish and take the coin out of his mouth and go pay him so don't don't offend them just let him alone but in all my life since I've been a little boy I've the Lord has always given me visions which we are acquainted with here at the church and I'm sure in the land where these tapes will travel also of visions and with this open Bible before me and before God who I stand I have never noted of one of them failing they've always been perfect and I had a vision a few weeks ago, about three weeks now that this coming Tuesday that drove me to my knees and out into the wilderness to fast and pray. And uh I put on venus cold, heavy insulated uh under clothes so that I to use on hunting trips so I wouldn't freeze up around there in my cave and in the woods. And I went up not someone said, "Well, Brother Brandham, did you go up to seek? You ought to went up to seek a vision from the Lord." I said, "No, you don't go. You don't do it that way. You can't pull nothing out of God." See, that's the reason people keep saying on the interview saying, "Ask the Lord. Just stay with just stay with it." I had a word of the Lord take to brother Neville about prophesying over everyone comes by this altar here. God told him, really call him down about it. See, don't do that. You'll shove him out in the flesh and then you'll have a false prophet. See, see, let him do just as the spirit leads him to do. See, don't don't try to pull nothing out of God because he can't do it. &gt;&gt; He'll only speak like Balum, the Harland prophet said, uh, I can only speak what God puts in my mouth. Otherwise, I can't say it. &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing. I like this system they got now. So, I can find out what just what the Lord would have do. That's very good. But Jesus went to the wilderness to fast after the Holy Ghost had come upon him. &gt;&gt; John bear record see the spirit of God come upon him and he was filled with the power of God God in him and then he went into the wilderness to fast afterwards not before for the Holy Ghost to come on him but he went in and fasted after the Holy Ghost came on him. See? And now in the vision, I might say this. I mentioned it once. I was going to cut it off the tape, but I believe I'll just leave it on. I This is about uh 3:00 in the morning, I suppose. I'd gotten up and I looked were in front of me and I was coming down to the Jordan. Looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine. And I was coming down to the Jordan and seemed like I could hear the song, I'm going down to the Jordan. Someone was saying it. And as I drew near the river, I looked back and seen which way I had come. And I was twothirds of the way there to the Jordan. And uh I looked across Jordan and I said, "Oh, praise God. Just on the other side is where all the promises lay. Every promise lays in the promised land." And then I came to myself. I thought, could I possibly have could it been that I was a dreaming? Uh because it's nighttime. See, a vision is something that you see with your eyes open just like a dream. You're looking right at it and you're you're conscious that you're standing like you're on the platform and you're you're standing here, but yet it look like you're in a dream. You can't explain it. There's no way to do it. See, it's God's works and God's ways are unexplainable. Amen. &gt;&gt; They have to be accepted by faith. &gt;&gt; Then as I uh sit there a little bit the side of this chair, then all of a sudden hear it come back again. Then I knew then it was vision. And then when I come into the vision again, it seemed that I was lifted up and sitting on a a highway, a narrow highway with some brother. I never knew who the brother was. I looked around. I said, "Now I am sure and know this is vision. The Lord God is here." And seemed like everybody was afraid. I said, "What's everybody so afraid of?" And a voice came and said, "There's such danger in these days. There's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you." And I heard the weeds are mashing down and I looked and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds. I thought, "Now, knowing this is vision, then I shall see what this uh this animal or this beast is." and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a mumba. Now a mumba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is. There's nothing as poison as a mumba and the snake of course represents sin and death. And uh there is the the we have in this country the rattlesnake and the copper head and the cotton mouth moccasin. Many of those snakes that if you're in bad health and want to bite you, it would perhaps kill you. But if you didn't get aid of some sort right away and then uh then we go into Africa and India and we find the cobra. There's a black cobra. He's a bad snake. He's a death bite, too. And there's the yellow cobra which is far beyond him. And the yellow cobra uh the patient dies with such a horrible death that dies from suffocation. It it paralyzes the breathing system and they they can't breathe and just open their mouth and gapping trying to and die like that. And that was the type of snake with just one lick from getting Billy Paul when we got the snake in Africa. And then there comes the mamba. He's dead. Just when he he's so fast you can't see him. He goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his tail. Just he's gone. Hits you in the face. Usually stands up high and strikes hard. And when he hits you, you just got a few breaths till you're finished. Turn real. It don't only paralyze to get in the bloodstream. It gets nerves everything. You're just die just in a few seconds. them native boys and track boys you can say mumble and they'll butt their heads together and scream cause it's death just in a few seconds see when one hits you and here he was on the highway I thought well this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got right close to me he'd run up fast and then he'd get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something hold him off he couldn't bite him &gt;&gt; and he'd turn around on the other side and try to approach from this side and he'd get back and get a start and he sw right towards me get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop and I just shake like that and move back. He couldn't strike me. Then he turned and looked at my friend and away he went after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air over him and over him and over him trying and a thing was striking at him. I thought, "Oh, if it ever hits him, it'll be instant death." No wonder everybody's so scared cuz when this thing hits you, it's an instant death. And and he was just striking him like that. I threw my hands up. I said, "Oh, God, have mercy on my brother." I said, "If that serpent ever strikes him, it'll kill him." And just then, the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again. And a voice came from above me and said, "You have been given power, &gt;&gt; the binding, &gt;&gt; the worst or any." &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, God, what must I do?" He said, "There's one thing you must do. You must be more sincere. &gt;&gt; You must be more sincere." I said, "Well, God, forgive me for my uncincerity and let me have sincerity." And when I raised up my hands to him again, there was a great something came over me. Just lifted me up. Seemed like it my whole body was charged with something. And uh I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet. And I said, "Satan, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I bind you." And the serpent, a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like a S, capital S, made backwards, an and an sign. An means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst. Blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backwards s that and sign like a conjunction you see. Choked it to death. And the brother was free and I went over and mashed on it. I said, "Now I've got to find out about this because it's vision." And I hit on the on the thing and it turned like that looked like a handle on a glass handle on a pitcher just made it solid crystal. And I said, "Think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything. It left it all the elements and it's turned to glass." And just then a voice came again and said, "You can unbind him also." So I said, "Then Satan, that [clears throat] I might know, I unbind you." And when he did, he started coming to life again, wiggling. And I said, "I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ." And when he did, the smoke flew out of him again. And he choked himself right back again. It turned to crystal. And then when he did that, that voice said, "Now, you must be more sincere than what you are to do this. Then it left me and I was standing in the room. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A few moments I heard the clock go off and my wife had got getting up. The children, you know how it is. I guess it's your house one. What am I going to wear today? Mama, where are my books and what did I do? You know, you just like any home. You can't hear yourself think hardly for all of them trying to get ready at once. And and so I slipped off into the den room and I got out on my knees and I said, "Lord Jesus, I don't know these things and what must I do?" And the children of me call me, take them to school in a few moments. What must I do? And I looked around and my Bible was laying there and I said, "Lord, if you will forgive me, I do not believe in just opening up the scripture and taking something out of the Bible and saying that, but there is times that when God can comfort you by such a thing, and I said, Lord, in this case of emergency right now before your spirit leaves me and I I don't know what to do, the kids will be an hour yet before they be gone. would you just show me if that was something you're trying to get to me, heavenly father, then let me know. And I took this Bible and just pulled it open like that and my thumb was laying at first Corinthians the 5th chapter the 8th verse. When something reads something like this when you come I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord. I told him I'd go out and fast. said when you come to this feast which a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord. We know that. So when you come to this feast, don't come with the old 11 or the leaven of malice and so forth, but come with the the unele truth. Just exactly what he told me in the vision. Come, God is my solemn judge. come with the unleven bread of sincerity and truth. That is the word. Then I seen what he meant as he years ago when I seen the Bible come down, got it wrote right here. Come down and a hand came from heaven and pointed down to Joshua and read the first nine verses and stopped there. That's Joshua come through the wilderness. But never did he was ready. When he got near Jordan, God call him out. said, "This day I'll begin to magnify you before the people." And then he took the children of Israel across Jordan to the land where give them divided to them the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I went to the woods and prayed and prayed and fasted. And now I went back to that tree where I met where those squirrels was that you've heard in other messages. See where those squirrels was. And standing there along about 3 or 4:00 in the morning, Ed staggered through the brush for what light I could see to get to the tree, coming early because I was led there. Then I met him. &gt;&gt; God help me to ever live true. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read my text now. I have taken for a text this morning. Wrote down here somewhere here. Joshua in the book of Joshua the 10th chapter. To you who are going to read behind me are the 10th chapter and the 12th verse. And I just have one hour and then uh I think I'm not sure, but I believe Billy said he'd give out prayer cards this morning. So there wasn't very many, but just some people want to be prayed for. And uh anybody got prayer cards? Raise up your hand. I That's right. Okay, that's fine. All right. Now, the 12th verse of the 10th chapter of Joshua. And now remember now in the future next Sunday I want to speak on Christianity versus idolatry and then I'll tell you from then about whether the Lord leads on for the Christmas message or not. It seems like I have a message on my heart for the people at Christmas and then I'll tell you from then. Now beginning the reading at the 12th verse of the 10th chapter of Joshua. Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel. And he said, "In the sight of Israel, son, stand thou still upon Gibian, and moon in the valley of Agelon." And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed until the people avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hastened not to go down about a whole day. Listen now. And there was no day like that before or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man. For the Lord fought for Israel, and Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp at Gilgal. May God add his blessings to his word. &gt;&gt; Now I wish if it be the will of the Lord that you carry with me for a few minutes. I want to take a subject strange odd upon reading such a scripture and I want your attention and and prayer during this time. I want to take the subject of one word paradox and first I'd like to explain maybe what a paradox is. In the Webster's dictionary it says that a paradox means something that's incredible but true. That is a paradox. something that's almost completely out of reason couldn't be so but yet it is. That's a paradox. Now I want to rest a few minutes on these words a paradox. Now we have many things that we could refer to as paradox. One thing that I would like to refer to is this world itself is a paradox. Its standing is a paradox. Last night I was talking to my daughter Rebecca that's in high school and I was studying here in the scripture and and was telling her about reading this uh this verse here and she said, "Daddy, Joshua actually stopped the world, didn't he?" I said, "I don't know why he stopped. He stopped the sun. She said he could not stop the sun because the sun doesn't travel. I said the reflection of it travels across the earth and he stopped that. She said, "Well, then God stopped the world." I said, "Then to the agnostic, what happens if the world happens to stop and lose its gravitation? It would shoot through space like a a star and missiles of it be falling for hundred billions of years in space." But the Bible said that the sun stopped and held its place for a whole day. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's unreasonable and incredible, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray. Tell me then, which is the top side of the world, the North Pole or the South Pole? How do you know if you're in space? You say the South Pole's down under us, they think the North Pole's down under them. It's standing in a space and a little circle of air as it's turning some thousand something miles per hour causes 24 25,000 miles around it and it turns around 24 hours. will make it going better than 1,000 miles an hour of traveling around and it never misses striking exactly where it's where it's on the equator where it goes around. It never misses a minute perfectly timed standing in the air. If that isn't a paradox, I don't know what one is. How that it's all the heavenly systems, how they are so timed so perfectly till that in years that's to come 20 and 30 years from now. Science can see the coming of the eclipse of the sun and the moon passing and can tell you to the moment when they will pass and when the eclipse will start. No matter how fine a watch that we have, one of the precision, I've got one here that was given to me in Switzerland as a present when I was there. The value is about $300 in American money that was given to me. There isn't a week. But what it has to be retired all clocks, nothing that man can make is so perfect. It'll in a few years it'll be worn out and gone. As it gets older, it'll get worse all the time. The jewels will wear down. The accuracy of it will leave it. There's nothing that can be ground or fixed out by man or honed out by man that can stay perfect, but this world stays perfect. What controls it? Well, you say, "I don't know what controls it. God holds it in its place. It truly is a paradox. It's you cannot describe how God does it, but he does it. So that's the main thing that he does it. And we know that it's so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's incredible how that you could spin a ball in the air. It will not make one complete revolution in the same place. I was thinking here some time ago when I was in the desert and uh one of these little jumping cactuses that the acids in your blood will draw right to you. One of those fellas jumped on to me and you can't pick it off. You have to take something and rake it off and it's got little burrs on them. And no matter how well you sharpen a needle, a needle will be blunt on the end. The perfect sharpness of a needle will be as perfect as you could get it. It'll be blunt to one of those jumping cactuses. And yet it is a leaf itself rolled down tight. How could it be that nature could roll a leaf tighter and sharper on the point than a fine machine could grind one? And yet thumb down to the end of that point is little fish hook burrs. like that little verse to keep it to hold itself in as it goes. Oh, a paradox, right? To science. It's incredible, but it's true. I would like for someone to explain this. I cannot tell you exactly the miles or how many miles science says that the moon is from the earth. But how could that moon, I would say, standing millions and millions of miles away from the earth and yet controls that tide of the sea? What does it? How can it be done? It's a paradox. But yet we look and see that it's done. &gt;&gt; It happens. The moon controls the tides. When the moon rocks out like this on the earth, the tide goes with it. And God has put the moon over the tides and set the boundaries and they cannot pass that boundary. Where if God draw a line and said, "See, you can come this close, but you cannot take the rest of it &gt;&gt; for I'm putting a guard over you." That moon millions of miles from the earth calls to that sea and it sets its boundaries controls it. Incredible. What is on that moon when just a few miles off the Earth, all gravitation, all air, everything else leaves, goes out into space where there's not even air for millions and millions and multiplied millions of miles. Yet, it controls it. Says you can go so far, but you can't go no farther. where I'm the [screaming] guard of God. I'm the watchdog that sets you here and you cannot pass these boundaries. Explain that. That's a paradox. How that God does that, but yet he does it. It cannot be explained. We got wintertime, snow on the ground, cold grounds freezing, a little seed, and in that little seed is a germ of life. And that little seed will freeze and burst open and the pulp will run out of it and that germ of life will be laying in the dust and a frozen sheet of ice and would kill any life. How's it preserved and then comes again in the springtime? Couldn't explain that, could we? It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; Amen. We take Hebrews the 11th chapter and the third verse. We understand there that the Bible says Paul speaking that the world was framed and put together by the word of God. &gt;&gt; A paradox that a a word could speak and out of that word would would foreign material things. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that things that do appear was made out of things that does not appear. &gt;&gt; Things that we see was a spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; The earth is the word of God. The trees are a word of God. Why would we be afraid to trust one that's given such a word with such power and authority? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would we be afraid to take that word to ourselves and apply it to our own self? Show us where we have fallen in unbelief. It's a word, God's word, a paradox. Truly a paradox. God's word. Also, I would like to show a paradox right quick. And that's when God called Abraham and told him when he was 100 years old and Sarah was 90, 40 years a past the time of menopause for her. and Abraham whose life was as good as dead and Sarah who was [screaming] barren to begin with and her womb as good as dead and yet God said that he'd bring to them a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a paradox. Ask the doctor if a woman a 100 years old could raise a baby, have a baby. It's impossible. It's incredible. But she did it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God said she would do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an incredible thing to think that a man could sit with his back turned to a tent, a stranger with dust on his clothes and tell a woman who is the back of the tent what she was thinking about. &gt;&gt; A paradox. &gt;&gt; Incredible, but yet it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was incredible when Abraham taken Isaac to the top of the mountain, his only begotten son, and took him up to the top of the mountain to offer him up as a sacrifice. And when he got to the top of the mountain and laid Isaac on the wood and was ready to take his life, and when he's coming down with his hand, something caught his hand. And there was a ram hooked by its horns in the wilderness on top of the mountain. A paradox. Where' the ram come from? How could it be a 100 miles from civilization without being killed with lions and and jackals and wild dogs and beasts and things? Where did it come from? How did it get there? And up on top of the mountain where there's no water, why was it there when he picked up the rocks? He called the name Jehovah Gyra. The Lord's provided himself a sacrifice. incredible but yet it's so true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For he is Jehovah &gt;&gt; Jarai. &gt;&gt; Incredible things that are knowledge and science. But yet it is true a great paradox. It was a paradox and will be when Jesus Mark 11:22 or 23 when he said if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said. It's incredible but it's true. It's a paradox. May I stop here to say yonder in that woods set him with the side of that tree that morning. No squirrels in the woods. But when a voice spoke and said, "Say where they'll be there." So help me if I'm die before I finish this message. Pointing my finger to a bare limited walnut tree. said, "He sat right there." And there he was. &gt;&gt; Incredible &gt;&gt; but true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Where will the next be?" I said, "Over in that bunch of clumps of stuff." And I never tuck my finger down till there he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where will the next be out on that snag out over that feeling? There he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's incredible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I asked my wife the other morning. I said, "Honey, have I lost my senses? Am I becoming a mad man? What's the matter with me? Why do I say the things I do? Why do I do the things I do for? What makes me I love people and yet just rip them apart? And I fast and pray to get a rid of it. The more I fast and pray, the worse it comes." &gt;&gt; Incredible. But it's true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. I seen a woman raise her hand just stand back in the building praising the Lord was Hattie right sitting down there when she had two boys of excuse me and seeing this renegade boys of the world that little woman sitting there that day a widow and I said Hattie the Lord God you said the right thing he provided those squirrels he's Jehovah gyra she said that's nothing but the truth of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, she said the right thing. It seems incredible that a human being could speak a word. As brother Booth told you, as dirty and filthy as we are, &gt;&gt; who is he that sets back God beyond the moon and stars and [screaming] all space and time and eternity? as even Boo said it and I read the same thing the other day reading Irenius that even the angels are dirty in his sight. &gt;&gt; Who are we but a woman said the right thing that calls the heart of Jehovah said ask her what she wants and then give it to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Incredible. &gt;&gt; But true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right here now in our sight is visible evidence. &gt;&gt; She asked for her boys souls to be Christians. God gave her her desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Incredible. &gt;&gt; That was more of a miracle than healing a sick person. &gt;&gt; That's changed a man's life. soul, body, and all he is is changes makeup. Incredible, but true. It was a paradox. We see it everywhere. Paradox in Noah's time. When Noah, a man, just an ordinary man, he became a prophet, was a prophet of the Lord, perhaps farming. God told him, "Prepare for a rain to come from heaven." when there was no rain. There never been no rain. There's no way to get rain up there. It had never rained on the earth. There was no seas. There was no waters. But yet God told him to make an ark for the saving of his house. And God brought the rain down. &gt;&gt; It was a paradox. Unscientific, but what? It was a paradox. Anyhow, yes, it was a paradox when the Hebrew children that had decided they had stay with God's word regardless of what happened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that the king built the furnace seven times hotter than it ever had been hit and throw those men in there when the intense heat of the of the furnace killed the man who walked up the gang tank with them to the mouth of the furnace. They died. But yet those men walked in that furnace for perhaps three hours. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. there would be no more even dust of them. [snorts] For the human life that was in them would have perished &gt;&gt; if it made one human life perish but coming close to it. What would it do another human life? &gt;&gt; But they throw them in there &gt;&gt; and let's say three hours. It might have been five. He might have went and had lunch and come back said open up the previous door. There won't even be dust to them fellas left. But when he opened the door, [screaming] there they were. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Unharmed walking around in the fire. Incredible. But true. Why? He said, "How many did you put in?" They said, "We have put three in." He said, "I see four." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what made the paradox. &gt;&gt; And that one looks like the son of the gods. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; He was a son of the gods. He was the son of God. &gt;&gt; They were heathens. Oh, God in his great word. &gt;&gt; There come a time when God's army had got cowardly and was afraid of a man. and it stood on the side of a hill when they let one man that was three times either side stand out on the side of the hill and say now you trust in a real God. You say one of you fellas come out and fight me and we won't we won't have any bloodshed. The enemy of God had backed the church of God &gt;&gt; against the hillside and they were taking it. &gt;&gt; They were afraid. They were cowards. And in the camp come a little bitty fella, little sheep skin wrapped around him, a shepherd's coat, the smallest man in the whole army, and not even a soldier. But it was a paradox. &gt;&gt; When God took [screaming] that one man, &gt;&gt; that one little unconcerned parox, the Bible said he was ready. That one little man put the whole army, the enemy to fight. &gt;&gt; That was a paradox. Looks like God would give that great marching army enough courage to go fight. They were servants of God. Why not go fight the battle of God? That's God's enemy. Take it. Looks like he would have given them courage. But God took one little individual. And remember another paradox. He never took a sword. Saul tried to put his armor on him. Try to put a sword in his hand. The poor little fell couldn't hold it up. And he took a slingshot. a little rubber, a little leather with two pieces of string wrapped on it and he defeated the whole army. How the enemy had put him to rot. &gt;&gt; It was a paradox how that one little boyless &gt;&gt; could put an army to running. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; Sure, God does it. He's just full of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sure he is. That's what he does. That's his way of doing it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It was a paradox. When Egypt had a great army that they had, the whole world was conquered. They had every nation under their hands. And when God decided to destroy that army, [clears throat] destroy that nation, looked like he would have raised up some Amorite army or some uh great army somewhere and would have sent them down there with better equipment or put a consolidation of all the denominations together to go down and to fight together. So he get full cooperation. &gt;&gt; But God used a paradox. &gt;&gt; He took an old man 80 years old and never put a sword in his hand, but a no [screaming] crooked stick &gt;&gt; that suck Egypt in the bottom of the Dead Sea. &gt;&gt; Incredible &gt;&gt; what God can do. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But that's the way he does it. He uses paradox to do it. See, he brings it to a paradox. A crooked stick of a shepherd instead of a marching army to defeat a a nation that rule the world. Oh, the only thing God's waiting on now, I believe, &gt;&gt; Russia don't mean nothing to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wants to get one man. &gt;&gt; You don't have to have big organizations. You don't have to have big denominations. He wants to get one man &gt;&gt; that he can wrap his spirit into him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That'll tell the rest of it. &gt;&gt; There will be another paradox. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; That'll tell he can get someone completely surrendered &gt;&gt; that will do that. &gt;&gt; That's the way God does his work. Amen. &gt;&gt; He uses paradox. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There was a paradox when a great soldier of the of God by the name of Jehoshaphat stood in the gates with a backsliden man by the name of Ahab and said, "Before we go to this battle, is not it a good thing that we consult the Lord?" Now, if that man's heart is hungry to know the will of God, &gt;&gt; there's got to be a will of God somewhere. &gt;&gt; Not always in the multitude of counsel and safety. &gt;&gt; Ahab says, "I've got all my ministers. They're all prophets. I'll call them up here. And you know, if I bring out 400 prophets, we'll find the word of the Lord. Not always. You do. Not always. If it's not with the word, then stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Care there. &gt;&gt; Stay with that word. God can't take that word, man. Now, he brought them all out there and they all prophesied with one accord that the Lord was with them. Go up. But yet, there was something wasn't right. &gt;&gt; Amen. That man of God knowed that wasn't right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Have you got one more? &gt;&gt; Just another one somewhere." &gt;&gt; Or said, "We got one, but I hate him." Said, "Don't let the king say so." God chose one illiterate boy, &gt;&gt; a little renegade to the nation, a despised and rejected one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring his message, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; to the hungryhearted. &gt;&gt; Instead of the all the denominations together speaking with one accord in union, God brought [screaming] one person. &gt;&gt; Amen. a paradox. But the man had the truth &gt;&gt; and it proved to be the truth &gt;&gt; because he's with the word. &gt;&gt; It was a paradox. Exactly. Now you say, "You mean you disagree with all this and that and that? If it's not with the word, I disagree with it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. God's word will never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking with the priest not long ago, he said, "Mr. Bram, you're trying to argue a point from a Bible." Said, "We believe the church." Nothing with that. We believe the church. What the church? said, "God is in his church." I said, "God is in his word and he is a word." &gt;&gt; That's right. The word. That's the reason Micah took the word [screaming] and God used a paradox to put every denomination to shame &gt;&gt; and brought to pass the word of the servant of God. One man despised, rejected, hated &gt;&gt; while hated by his own people. &gt;&gt; Now, he wasn't a communist or he wasn't something else. Let's say he was Pentecostal. And the Pentecostal groups hated him. &gt;&gt; They didn't like him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They had nothing to do with him. But he had the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God made a paradox out of it. &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't he, if all these other fellows are prophets and ministers and so forth, why can't in all this whole big group decide something better than one person? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Seem unreasonable that God would just make one man's word right and the rest of them because that man's word was God's word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the reason God brought the thing to pass because a man was with God's word. Amen. &gt;&gt; The others were prophesying a lie. &gt;&gt; Yes. It was a paradox when God took one little fella's word and made it true because it was his word. God has to stand by his word. &gt;&gt; Not the council's word, but God's word. &gt;&gt; That's who he stands by. He took Micah instead of a well-trained school &gt;&gt; of ministers, renowned men. Nothing against them. They were great men. They were a man who believed in not another god. They believed in the same god Micah believed in &gt;&gt; but they act like they believed in it but wouldn't take his word &gt;&gt; because they wanted to be popular. &gt;&gt; They wanted to find favor with the king and their blindness overlook the true word of God. &gt;&gt; How could God bless what he had cursed? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ladies and men both don't think that I do this to be nasty. &gt;&gt; I do it to be honest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason how can I say that women should have all right, let them cut their hairs off and things like that. Where are their clothes? That ain't got nothing to do with it. God's word says it does. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. She's shameful and disgraceful as long as she does it. And God will never deal with her. &gt;&gt; I don't care how much she speaks in tongues or jumps or shouts. &gt;&gt; She's not got anywhere with God yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Man. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You who can't rule your own house. &gt;&gt; And then try to be preachers and deacons. How long are you fit to be a preacher in a pulpit? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To lead the church of the living God and divide for them their inheritance when you think more of your meal ticket and the offering it comes in than you do the word of God and ashamed to say it before the women. Afraid you won't be popular. &gt;&gt; God have mercy on your sinful soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Speak the word of God in truth. John said the axe is laid at the root of the tree and the axe is a word of God. &gt;&gt; Never trees that don't bring forth the right fruit it down and cast it into the fire. &gt;&gt; God bring us another paradise. &gt;&gt; Why did God take John the Baptist as I was just speaking of instead of his well-trained priest of that day? He took a man that never went to school a day in his life. So we understand that John went into wilderness at the age of nine years old and was alone with God. Few days ago in reading of the Nyian council that's long time after the death of the last apostle St. gone. When those men come up there to that nasty council, some of those old brothers and the rest of them, they come there dressed in sheep skins upon those robed emperors like Constantine and the bishops of Rome. Old sheepkins wrapped around them and lived in the wilderness on herbs. But they were prophets of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The little church, the Greek side went on, the Roman side went back. But it goes to show when you compromise, you can't be a servant of Christ. John, in that day, the church was very orthodoxy. They had the priest, a well-trained man. But God chose a man that had no education at all &gt;&gt; and tuck him out of the wilderness with a piece of sheep skin wrapped around him and his whiskers all burned out, his hair hanging over his neck, no pulpit to preach from, no church to invite, &gt;&gt; but he probably stood in mud half to his knees and preached the kingdom of God is at hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; God chose that man. &gt;&gt; When Jesus said, "Who did you go out to see? A man that can speak at all the schools, a man that's finally arroed and so forth." He said, "There are king's palaces." So, what'd you go to see a prophet? He said, "More than a prophet. &gt;&gt; This is who the prophet spoke of. But come, I send my messenger before my face." &gt;&gt; He was a the angel of the covenant. He was the the great forerunner. But it was a paradox how God got why didn't he come down to that big school up there at Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he come to Kasis the high priest? Why did he not come to some of those great trained men who had been trained from childhood and their fathers have been trained before him and their fathers before them for generation after generation after generation. trained in schooled, fine, high cultured, educated, and then pick an old man out in the wilderness that never had a day schooling in his life. They set him out on the Jordan and said, "This this is him." &gt;&gt; A paradox. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Uncredible, but it was true. God did the virgin birth of our Lord. Incredible. for a woman to bring a child without knowing a man. God did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God did it. See, it's a paradox. Tuck a little old woman down there, a little old girl engaged to some man about 45 years old. She herself is about 16 or 18 and engaged to this man who was a widowerer of four children. and then took this woman and overshadowed her by the Holy Spirit and conceived in her womb the body that tabernacle almighty God &gt;&gt; the paradox how that heaven can't hold him earth is his foottool &gt;&gt; heavens is his throne &gt;&gt; and yet can bring the fullness of that godhead bodily and embodied into a man Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you can measure for hundreds of billions of miles into aons of time and never measure God. &gt;&gt; And yet a little baby laying in a manger contained the fullness of his body and body. &gt;&gt; Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; A paradox. That great God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Who sets back [laughter] to control 100 million sons shining on planets who never began and never ended &gt;&gt; and would embody himself in a manured stable and then we get out and dance and drink and carry on in a celebration. It's not a celebration. It's a worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We celebrate Christmas. How that God did that in order he could die could take the place of a sinner. It was a paradox when a little curlyheaded boy, little stoop shouldered fella, he probably wasn't 5 foot tall and he had seven locks hanging down around his head, a little and he was uh uh on his road down one day to see his girlfriend and a lion roared against him. Anybody ever hear a real lion roar? Uh you probably have these cages and things around here, but I want to tell you they're just now. You already hear a wild one really roar. The rocks will fall off the hill a half a mile away. Pebbles roll down the hill. It just vibrates the ground. show. Where that roar comes from, I don't know. Oh, I seen one one day. He's hanging his head down. A big old yellow man lion roared at a black one because a black man because he picked up a piece of meat. He left it laying there and as if the must say now you leave that alone. I'm going down to get a drink of water and he went down to lap the water. When he come back, this black man had been licking on it. The old papy just stopped, put his head down and he let out a belch and I say that the rocks rolled off the hill. Oh my. He'd shake the city if he roared like that. A roar of the lion. Oh, he's vioious. And that roar run against this little curly-headed shrimp we call him. And something happened. That little shrimp walks over and gets him by the mouth and puts one hand down this way and one that way, not nervously, and just pulls him apart and lays him down there. That's a paradox. &gt;&gt; What caused it? If you'll notice the reading just before it and the conjunction, the spirit of [screaming] the Lord came upon him. &gt;&gt; That's what made the difference. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he slew the line. &gt;&gt; Then one day, some Philistines came after him. He was unarmed. There was a thousand of them. They had long spheres and big shields and uh that's like a door in front of you like that. The shields just think of a great big brass shield all the way in front of you with helmets of brass on big coats of brass and all their shins and everything with brass great big long spears long as them out that pole there maybe 15 20 feet long big brass heads on them like that sharp as a razor. And they found this little curly-headed shrimp coming down from Palestine to visit some girlfriend of his down there. So they said, "There's that little fell. Let's go take him." One man could have tucked him by the end of that spear, just lifted him up, just shook him a little bit, and he fell right down to his hand down to the hilt on the sphere. Well, he's just a little bitty old guy. Some people the artist is trying to draw Samson with with shoulders. He couldn't walk in this tabernacle. Well, that wouldn't be no mystery that a man that size. Samson was just a little bitty old thing. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of the Lord is what was big. &gt;&gt; He takes a dishonor in the scripture to say he was a man that size. God always takes a foolish and ignorant things to like that to do his work with. You see, he takes something as nothing. So this little fellow was standing out there and all at once here come these Philistines and surrounded him to kill him. and he took the jawbone of a mule that was laying there, a wild one of little donkeys, picked up the jawbone of that mule, and the spirit of the Lord came on him. &gt;&gt; And that was a paradox. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How did he beat down with the jawbone of a mule through that half inch thick helmet &gt;&gt; over the top of the head of the jawbone of the mule? &gt;&gt; All right. While the first that old dry jawbone land there, the first lick he would have hit it bursted into a thousand pieces over the top of one of those helmets or those big shields. When a thousand rushed in upon him and he'd beat every one of them to death &gt;&gt; hallelujah paradox. That's when the spirit of God come upon him. Oh, we could only be jawbones &gt;&gt; in the hand of God. There be another paradox. Yes, it was. It was a paradox when Jesus, our Lord, took five biscuits and two little fish and broke them and fed 5,000 &gt;&gt; and taken up baskets full of remainings little parcels that some of they lay four or five fish out this table and four or five loaves of bread and then go over here and lay four or five loaves of bread. Some of them couldn't even eat it all. Just left them laying there. So they picked them up. Baskets full of them. Oh, see how did he do it? It's incredible that a man could take five biscuits and two little fishes and feed 5,000 take up seven baskets full &gt;&gt; left over. It's incredible. But he did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? It was God. &gt;&gt; Yes. is a paradox. It's incredible. But he did it. It was incredible. And never before after on a stormy sea and the waves so high till it was sinking a ship when a man come walking down across those waves. I you see every time the the great big white cap comes around him dispers and falls down towards the bottom. He walks right on. is like he's on a piece of concrete walking up on the sea. &gt;&gt; In time of [screaming] a storm. Let's science figure that one out. &gt;&gt; What held him up there? What kept him on that sea when it's a half a mile deep right in there? one of those great waves many times bigger than this tabernacle splashing while while filled a little boat and water logged it his way inside and out and it was sinking. The mass poles had broke down and the orers was gone and all hopes of being saved was gone. And here come somebody walking on the water. Oh glory &gt;&gt; of paradise. Sure. &gt;&gt; Incredible cannot be explained but he did it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he did it. Come walking on the water. &gt;&gt; It's incredible &gt;&gt; that this same one. &gt;&gt; Oh God, hope &gt;&gt; this drives home. Incredible. A real paradox that this same one, Jesus of Nazareth, would choose a bunch of ignorant fishermen for his church &gt;&gt; instead of the well-trained priests and denominations to that day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How a God that had all wisdom, that could walk on the waters, that could turn water into wine, that could take a five biscuits and feed 5,000 people and take up seven baskets fulls left over. How would that [screaming] same one, the God that sets an eternity honor, that's the so bright sons, hide their face from him? the very pool of wisdom and purity and of understanding and knowledge supreme of the supremes. And he would come to a place where a great organization of churches that all gathered together and trained all their men. and he'd go down and pick up a bunch of dirty, stinking fishermans that couldn't even write their own name and choose that type of man &gt;&gt; to set the church into order for his bride. &gt;&gt; Strange thing, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Looks like at least he took somebody was trained. He's a trainer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one who does it. &gt;&gt; Strange that he had did it instead of taking church man, he took fisher man &gt;&gt; to do it. Very odd. But that's why he does it. &gt;&gt; It's true. Is a real paradox. Amen. Let's stand together. Let's go to the key of F. Counts the stars [singing and music] one and all. He knows how much sand is on the [singing] shore. Sees each sparrow that falls. [singing and music] made the mountain and the seas. [music] He's in control of everything, of all creatures, [music and singing] great and small. He knows my name, every step that I [singing] take, [music] every tear that I make, every [singing and music] tear that I cry. He knows my name. [music] When I'm overwhelmed by the pain, can't see the [music and singing] light of day. I know I'll be just fine. He knows my name. [music] I don't [singing] know what tomorrow [music] will bring. I can't [singing] tell you what's in store. I don't [music] know a lot of things. [singing] I don't have [singing and music] all the answers to the questions of life, but I [singing and music] know in whom I have believe. He knows [singing and music] my name. Every step that I take, every move that [singing and music] I make, every tear that I cry, [singing] he knows [music] my name. When I'm overwhelmed by [singing] the pain and can't see the light [music] of day, I know [singing] I'll be just fine. He knows [music] my name. Let's sing that second verse one more time. Don't know what tomorrow [singing] will [music] bring. I can't tell you what's in store. I don't know a lot [singing] of things. [music] I don't [singing] have all the answers to the questions of [music] life. But I know [singing] in whom I have believe and [music] he knows [singing] my name. Every step that I take, every move [music] that I make, [singing] every tear that I cry, he knows my [singing and music] name when I'm overwhelmed by your pain. Can't see the [music] light of day. I know I'll be just fine. He knows [music and singing] my name. He knows [singing and music] my name. [music] Oh yes, [singing] he knows my name. Light of [singing] the world, you step down into darkness. Oh [singing] my eyes. Let me [music] see. Beauty that [singing and music] makes this heart adore you. Oh [singing and music] my life spent with you. Oh here I [singing and music] am to worship. Here I am to bow [music] down. Here I am to say [singing] that you're my [music] God. You are [singing] all together lovely. [music] All together worthy. All together [singing and music] wonderful to me. [music] King [singing] of hol so highly [music] exalted. Glorious [singing] in heaven above. Holy [music] you came to the earth you ced. full of [singing] singful. [music] [singing] Here I [music] am to worship. Here I am to bow [music and singing] down. Here I am to say that you're my God. You're all together [music and singing] love. All together worthy. All [music and singing] together one church. [singing] [music] Lord, here I [music and singing] am to worship, to bow down. Here I am to say [singing] [music] you're my God. You're all together love. [music] All together [singing] worthy, all [music] together wonderful eternally. [music] Lord, [singing] here I am to worship. [music] Amen. May just give a praise offering this morning. Thank you for [applause and music] sure. Nice to have my sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Scott and Christy Shire, with us this morning. They'll [music] be in Arizona for a bit. Scott, would you mind dismissing us word of prayer this morning? Let's all bow our heads. Yes. Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, Lord, we're just so thankful that we could come here, Lord, and Lord, not just get just a slice of bread, Lord, but the whole loaf, Lord, the true word of God, Lord, that we restored in this [music] day, Lord, that you promised, Lord, Lord, brother, Lord, but it was you speaking [music] to the hearts of the people, Lord, to get themselves ready for your soon coming, Lord. Lord, and we're here, Lord, today, Lord, to make ourselves ready, [music] Lord. We're on your worthy servants, Lord God. But we just plead the blood, Lord, the promises that you gave us, Lord God, that if we repent of our sins, Lord, [music] and turn unto you, Lord, and ask you to fill us with your spirit, Lord, that we could be your vessels, Lord, to [music] over be overcomers in this day, Lord, we could walk, Lord, and be witnesses, Lord, of your truth, Lord, and your light, [music] Lord, and your word is just as true today. And your power is just the same. And your blood is just the same, Lord, to save sinners from their sin, Lord God. and to fill us, Lord, with your spirit, Lord God. [music] Lord, we want to be surrendered vessels to you this day, Lord. We want to thank you, Lord God, for this opportunity, Lord, [music] to say that we love you, Lord, to worship together, Lord, and bring us back safely together, Lord, to worship, Lord, tonight, Lord, and be at our post of duty, Lord God, and just help us, Lord God, just to surrender all to you, Lord God. God, and we want to give you the praise and the honor and the glory for all that you've done for us and tell you again, Lord, that we love you and thank you, Lord, for all that you've done for us. In the precious [music] name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Lord, prepare [singing] me to be a sanctuary, [music] pure and [singing and music] holy, tried and true with [singing] thanksgiving. [music] I'll be a living sanctuary [music and singing] for you. Ask him [singing and music] again. Oh Lord, prepare me to be [music and singing] a sanctuary, pure and holy, [singing] tried and true. [music] With thanksgiving, I'll be [music and singing] a living sanctuary. Just sing it one more time. Joy. [music] Lord, [singing] prepare me [music] to be a sanctuary pure and holy, tried and true, [music] with thanksgiving. I'll be [music and singing] a living sanctuary [music] for you. [music] Amen. You're dismissed. There'll be choir practice. A reminder that 3:00 this afternoon. So, those that are interested in participating in the [music] choir be here at 3. Otherwise, service this evening. Remember the pose in prayer. They'll be traveling [music] back from Mesa. May God bless you and till we meet again. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, [singing and music] pure and holy, [music] tried and true. With thanksgiving [music] I'll [singing] be unliving sanctuary [singing] [music] for you. Oh yes, [singing] Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, [music and singing] pure and holy, tried and true. With [singing and music] thanksgiving, I'll be a living sanctuary for you. And I'm amazed [singing] that you love me. I'm amazed [singing and music] how you care. Through your [singing and music] preious blood I found [singing] pardon and my sins are [music] washed. They're [singing] all washed away. All my sins are washed [music and singing] away. No one knew how [singing] alone I was feeling and the emptiness [singing] that tried so [music] hard to hide. Oh, [singing] I laughed and said my life was [music] fine without you. I was [music and singing] covering up the secret tears. I cried. [music] Then [singing] one day someone told me [music] of your mercy and the [singing] love you shown [music] on a hill called Calary. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; There you [singing] purchased my redemption [music] where you broke [singing] sin's power and set my spirit free. I'm [music] amazed [singing] that you love me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I'm amazed how you [music] care. Your precious blood [singing] on the [music] pardon. And my sins are washed. They are all [singing and music] washed away. All my sins are [music] washed away. Hey la. Oh, all heat. Oh, [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. N. [music] Happy birthday. Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]
