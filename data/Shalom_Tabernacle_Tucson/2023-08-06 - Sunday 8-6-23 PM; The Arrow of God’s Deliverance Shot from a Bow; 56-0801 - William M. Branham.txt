the Lord can't you see why I'm so happy [Music] I've accepted the word of the Lord [Music] without reveal Ed word that was oh okay by the prophet of America and can't you see why I'm happy I've

accepted I have accepted [Music] the revealed word that was born by the prophet of Malachi amen God bless you tonight so good to be with God's people it's a little warm and I think this morning we sure warmed it up really quickly I had service really a real good church service before brother George even got up here we had dancing singing and shouting I know I was crying a few tears back there we all do our worship a little differently maybe and then brother George got two Services worth because he really gave it to us I appreciated it so much it was a real workout I patted them on the back literally and he was soaking wet so appreciate him giving giving it his all and just real good to come back with you again and do it all again so it's a little warm you bear with us it just don't keep up when we ac when we bring the Holy Ghost and Fire I guess and the outsides a little warm so but it's it's all good and we were singing about Malachi 4 there it's real good we of course we know Malachi 4 chapter 4 verse five and six does anybody know Malachi 4 1 behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble the day cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts leave them neither root nor Branch so I I don't know I don't know but it's it's sure burning but we're ready to go home the bride's met herself ready so whatever that means I just want to be ready brother George so God bless you each one we'll be listening to kind of a different title so I'm sure we'll be listening really well to what that means tonight only believe um as we change the order to Arrow of God's Deliverance shot from a bow so real curious about that I've heard it before but not in a while so welcome our visitors brother Steve Sister Rose Daphne's back with us got Mom here with us as well we haven't melted her down yet so that's good so God bless you only believe [Music] oh only be only all things are possible [Music] all things are possible only me foreign amen God bless you you can be seated we're going right straight into it and expect God to give us one of the greatest Services when the brother walks to the platform that the Holy Spirit just sweeps over this building and everything every sick person that's ever the tank will be to go knocked by the car student will be healed now how many loves him with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind amen now be ready and be in prayer now while we reach down off this blessed old Bible over the book of Kings we read this and he said open the window each one and he opens then said Elijah shoot and be shot and he says this is the era of the Lord's delivery may he add His blessings to the reading of the word the era of God's Deliverance of all now you know no matter how mysterious it seems God always keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem to people God keeps his word that's right and if God makes a promise of anything God will keep that drunk you and I make a promise we we break it because we don't need to have to do it but sometimes circumstances causes us to do it but when God being uh infant then he knows all the future from the beginning and he can't he don't make a promise that he he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise sometimes it seems like it's it's ridiculous the way that he would go around about to keep his promise but God always says how strange as the people my thought in the days of Noah when he was building away on an ark to save himself and his household that to be rain come down out of here but God Reigns it just the same and I'll think of Moses how that Moses standing up there on the mount by the side of this Burning Bush he lost all hopes of freedom didn't seem like that the freedom that the people is so gallantly stood for one time was ever going to happen but in the life of God standing for that Burning Bush Everything any changed I think it's the same today that many of us lose the sight of freedom I think here is a little boy sitting before me probably an infantile parallel little orange twisted up I look at a lady here with a white team sitting in front of me uh a probably a blind woman lovely young lady laying here on a little and maybe many of you there have cancer heart troubles and diseases that a storm to kill you but you lose all thoughts of Freedom as soon as the doctor says it's insurance why brother if we'd ever come in the presence of God like Moses did why it was a revolutionary why I was revolutionized when the in the life of that angel of God standing on that mountain that day everything that he wanted for his thought never would have happened come to be a reality and I think of men and women today whatever step into the light are the Holy Spirit under the function of God's spirit and the light of God's word everything that God has promised will illuminate to you and be real again why the reason Moses sailed in the first place here's what was the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush has that's right and what's our failure today is life having what the Holy Spirit has and the Holy Spirit has all good things for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all things are possible and it's not only possible but promise good Jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll do it that's right that's right if you abide me in my words in you yeah that's what you will it'll be given to you see when we step into the light of God's word with the unsure the Holy Spirit to shine the light on Brother The Impossible becomes little things in him God asked us to believe these words he stands the Holy Spirit to energize that word when it falls into it that's right and the Holy Spirit brings the word he energizes that and flesh is the same life of God's blessed Thomas foreign and in our text tonight the very uh outstanding text to me that land that had a great line of Kings since the death of Ahab and Elijah had told him of how he was going to die and what God was going to do because he was wicked and how The Jezebel was going to be fed to the dogs because if she did the evil thing that she had done and remember my brothers and sisters you'll reap watch your soul that's God's law that's God's law of nature your reap watch yourself do not dear people you hear Shreveport let this be a warning to you if you believe me to be God's servant listen the best thing for you to do around live Tabernacle and everywhere else is keep an old-fashioned prayer meeting doors and keep the unity of the spirit keep looking up and watching for their coming of the Lord keep all the Wilderness out of it no matter how bad it hurts circumcised by the holy ghosts I'll begin to see a lot of words [Music] get down no matter how bad it is our lifetime we're not going to talk to you now you better talk to your people that are the same place but I begin to notice there's something different it ain't the same Life Tabernacle I used to come to and I want you to remember tonight you keep that little passion prayer meeting keep the old-fashioned Holy Spirit falling among you keep the world alive just remember just remember that you've got all the best churches out of the world can't you in my life Tabernacle is one of my favorites it breaks my heart to see that in the world leak into you the way you're doing so don't do that no more and let God come back and take over commit yourself to God and get the old-fashioned blessing back again and if you want to get some real good treatment and real good old-fashioned Hospitality come to Louisiana and I tell you don't let the world creep into you don't let the world get into your churches Brothers [Music] is the best thing that I know to do only one way to do it that's prayer prayers thoughtfully Prayer Changes Things now a long line of kings that come down it has the wicked ones have been shot by a boy and killed and Jesse Bauer stood out of the room as she caught the to make love or thank Jason when he drove down and he had the eunuch the door out the window into the streets seeing some of you women begin to wear your makeup and stuff like the rest of the women of the world that didn't kill me and I walked in here the other day and saw that look there's only one woman in the Bible that ever painted her face you don't face your face to meet God you used to be nice and the woman that did that to God better to you though [Music] [Music] [Music] right yeah and the whole Pentecostal War as they do lay down both you do you stay true thank you foreign that's reason so hard to have a meeting of any time is because [Music] sure wrong and you got to get the woman alive before Christ come in he just wants to shape with unbelief and things of the world now look friends down on me come alive Josh [Music] was king during this time and he was a lukewarmed preacher a believer anyway the people wanted to knew that was all right with George Roy taking out a few of the high places and for the Heathen worship for us he'd done a few of these things but yet he depart him out from the sins of his father why is that just any way that people want to go that's the way he wanted to go when they're brought out what time left back to his face it is compromised he told the truth [Music] what will it be there now's the time when we need of it it was a time when the church is waiting for thousands after all these great Miracles and times and wonders that God has sent me across the country doing and yet the church is in the first baptism stayed on 11 years [Music] I'm preaching the Pentecostals [Music] well first come among your groups 10 years ago it looked like a church but the day it goes back the world that's all uh you ask the truth your kind of you're trying to act like the restorer you just take the day as a compromising time that's true you think your steps Red Blocks and your neighbor don't pay his death threat sure yes sir it's a matching time you know that truth that's it amen listen that is true I want my experience let's go real magic things [Music] your name sufferings on this boy who I'm believing this highway lukewarm do you know what the Bible says this day would come the lady is seeing churches he said you see Luke 1 and make God sick in his stomach he said he spew you from his mouth the lady of sins just enough religion to make you sick we're still wrong if I want to do it I'd do it but I will deny that there's a good old faith and baptism amen [Music] of God and today is as cold as zero literally you don't have that little fights and songs you used to think he'll see their faces light up no more and sing and pat their hands and raise their hands to God and praise God pray all nightly on the corn fields and things where it came Church 30 minutes left true that's the truth Luke Luke but the day of Joyce borderline California wins cause Without Rain toasted out never learning able to come to the knowledge of the truth before we talked about by everything don't be talked about what you see on the television why serve Christians today are staying home always tonight to see the television yeah well you know that's the Gateway of all of Hollywood out there why it's nothing else but a bunch of big prostitutions free shakers were then movie stars and you want to act like men what happened to Christ what happens act like Hollywood offerings [Music] we ought to get out until the truck stops amen [Music] try to change the way we're acting get back to God now this Old King he thought he would just go anyway the winds Road cost about everything why you're never stabled you don't know what you do believe and the people today they'd rather stay home and see I Love Lucy or what is that Lucy Lucy something because it is but that's not for Christians Christians more saying love the word of God if you've got something and you see those such nonsenses that you need to repent all your rock and roll and Boogie Woogie where did it come from Africa I just left Africa you witnessed that paint on you know where it comes from That's The Mark of hedonism they paint their face and that's where you got it from Christians watch their babies [Music] that's my college sports your little brother you better be sure somewhere else hey man [Music] [Music] his words [Music] [Music] while your children looking here in less than three months time every teenage kid in the country from five years older 18 known Who David Crockett was thank you well our street sang a daily cracker some kind of fiction story nonsense kill the man when he's three years old how crazy but the kids are left who's in cats and everything else is going to go their side oh God here's their stories everywhere else nonsense and you Christians I was a message of God if the world could let down a lot of nonsense but the kids how much more of the Christians to put on the program of the Lord Jesus Christ coming out along the hundred thousands of kids tonight in America can tell you all about David Crockett don't all worry about Jesus Christ what's the matter that's why these family room sucker in the televisions to the Bible got nothing against the television if it's used for God's program all right it was God's way the first way who made the airwaves and so forth but the devil just took it in perverted it solid for us Hollywood got over anything they get a hold of his Rockies of course it can't come for nothing else are ready to Crime magazines one of those most famous women out on the street of prostitution 50 a night living with men and things all up and down the coast and then run out there and some other four or five husbands and your little girls want to pattern yourself after that when the man out there is supposed to be such movie actress and so forth when they live we're swimming so much to the Natural core survivors changing it they become perverted yourself [Music] [Music] in the world or human needs to live by is the man's height easy amen right then we call ourselves Christians and harmonize our souls such as that no one in the world [Music] or something patterns in our souls during meetings anymore because the world exams all right halfway wishy-washy oh my what a condition and the face of all that now to show you there's a hope this Old King George heard that the prophet was sick and he went on to visit and when he went to Disney he didn't come here Reverend he would come with respect he walked up he had enough of God about him to know that he must visit this Prophet with respect so they walked up and waffled me he said my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof and when he did see that's the way you ought to get something from God don't come around a meeting like this to make fun don't come around and pack some kind of a tail from one place to another if you do that you'll never get over with God don't read the Bible to fuss about it read the Bible to live it right so then when he went down there anything he respected him he said my father my father the Terrace of Israel and the horse in other words my my father your word more than all the characters and all the horsemeness I'll stay tonight though Elijah was considered a holy Roar a fanatic by the modern world yet his presence in that nation was worth more than all of the horses and shared to have said tonight that a good old-fashioned Holy Ghost candy is more to protect us than all the atomic bombs that we could create in a million years respect he didn't go to say now hey holy war you know what my pastor just told me about you all right he didn't do that he walked down with respect and you went over me and because he come and approached it reverently God has respect you God said now still Elijah Rhymes up and Elijah rules up and they were just about ready in their back spreading conditions to be besieged by another country the syrians they were coming to get him and Elijah knew that but because this one man crumbled himself and come down before God and said oh my father how we need you God respected it and he respected Elijah and God respected him and if you respect God's Bible and God's holy spirit he'll respect you amen don't try to protect it or say it isn't thought just the reason that's all watching now and Elijah said go get your bowl the East is the way that Jesus Will Come I said not alive now I want you to put the air into place and draw back just as far as you can and he did he says shoot and when he's shocked what happened to everyone else he said get the error when he come back he said scratch the ground and he struck the ground three times and the prophet was wrong with him so why describe it more times than that why do you do something else about it strike it more time since you Struck it three times but you only had three victories if that's just about what the things happen tonight in the Christian church we are struck the era of God's Deliverance is that it was God sent the Arabs delivered to us the era of Deliverance is the holy spirit that's been sent shot from the soul of God's love right when eternity Perry was pulled together by the court of love God shut the hell out delivered into the church overhead City Hall hello and the church was dead in her hands the church was given into her hands the era of monsters amen the holy spirit will deliver the church out of any kind of the chaos he could get into it but what did they do with it they picked up the era and the struck three times King they struck the air like well we'll deal to church that's all right we'll teach theology that's all right we'll teach that college and have an organization that's just about as far as his son they struck short of many lessons and the church tonight the check tonight is still sharp there's a stuck out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the power of delivered from singing It's such dark or you say I'm going to church [Music] and make you act like a lady it made you quit your smoking breaking lime feelings and everything's better when you've got your best preparations amen it makes you love God it makes you go to church it makes me worship it it makes you tell your neighbor about it and make you live about 10. oh they just don't say we got a chair we got a good teacher we got theology that's not as much as you should order Empress Thomas in the book is mine sure [Music] they had all kinds of signs wonders Miracles divers gifts of the Holy Ghost everything they had it but we're stocking sharp with it the best of the Holy Ghost in the United States has come to the Gentiles in the Western countries and God shot their delivered to us and we have just about struck Among Us and they were said oh I'm assembling Hallelujah I thought the Church of God glory to God hallelujah [Music] wow it's not an organization that God said strikeless it's given to each individuals to strike against the powers [Music] oh my word amen but we should start short always go over to the church and we join the church and we think that's all right that's not all right brother don't strike short or nothing of God's blessings the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday amen don't be afraid I'm the Lord of Liberty not this Soul if the air of Deliverance it's brought into the church line we talk about a historical God that's what's the matter tonight the church has been taught of some historical thing and not put it down to a present day what good is the god of Elijah if he is the same God tonight what good is a god of Moses that delivered the Hebrew children out of Egypt what good is that God in the history if he isn't the same God what good is the god that walks the base of Galilee back on Earth and Open the Eyes of a blindness and then condemn to speak in here heal the sick Deliverance if he is in the same job tonight what city is he that's right amen what good is he what's good does it do to get your boys to education or something on the history learn of all theology teach in the Bible then if you turn around and tell us and those things [Music] already out that's the same way as today with all of our education with all of our theology with all our church denominations we fasten people of the pillars at the same there's no such thing today they can't be healed there's no certain things for the Holy Ghost all this stuff they say is what could they do to preach them in the Bible if you're going to keep them safe and say that God message many years ago if he ain't the same God who delivers back there and now if he was back then he isn't worth nothing to us he's a dead teacher he's done historical something how are you going to get a man more by a painted fire The Man was created table brother look at this nice story it worked two thousand years you don't want them to go do this since then you're freezing sure if Jesus Christ raised in the dead shall I'll be with you always [Music] [Music] that's right amen the air Deliverance has given to the church about worldliness unbelieved superstitions and everything else is creeped in brought Wilderness to the church God blesses in the church organs different denominational marriage one down this way I'm that way I will call on it oh mama that's what's the matter the brother so yes the era of Deliverance is still with Mercy life gives you the church what we already take it out the strike for the glory of God that's why I never did find blessing in God's promise endures by faith if you receive it do you believe it Moses up on the mountain and Moses the tribe of all these doctrines with all he know about the Bible all his mother at home all the teachers that taught him and everything he tried to go out and do it in himself entails but one time when the angel of God come down God spoke in the power of the Holy Spirit God's word become real when the Holy Spirit reveal it to Moses heals us different names take place you'll be a different person in the light of God's word may you live and believe and serve the Lord Jesus let us pray our heavenly father this is the night this is a time when man is pressed to the kingdom this may be the last time that manager our women will ever hear this may be the last opportunity death may take them before mornings this may be the lifetime that some people ever stood on Earth hit me oh God in heaven speak with you Lord oh May the Holy Ghost take these few broke up Origins thank them down into
