This morning we'll be listening to for Sunday school the adult Sunday school class here um the Leodysian church age paragraph 243 to 288. Looking forward to hearing about this last church age this morning with you. I forgot to mention to the Clayvilles from Sierra Vista. Welcome. We're sure glad to have you. And Erica, nice to have you as well. I forgot to mention we have Sunday school. I'm a little nervous. Um, usually don't do this. We're missing some people though. So, Sunday school for 5 through 15. There's two classes over here. We'll get you going if you would like to participate if your kids are in that age group. So, again, welcome. Uh, only belief. [Music] Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. only be all things are possible only. Let us pray. Dear Lord, we're so happy to be in church this morning. Lots of places we could be, things to do, Lord, but we believe time is short and we just want to be right in line with the word. Lord, we know it's stable. It's a true and sure foundation. And Lord, you said that there is no variableness or shadow of turning. You're unchanging, unfailing, Lord God. That same yesterday, today, and forever as we know from the word. And thankful to be with like-minded people that just love you and want to serve you and worship you, Lord. This portion of the message we'll hear this morning. And we appreciate Brother Jonathan visiting with us, our visiting minister. We pray for him that you'd anoint him and anoint our ears to hear. We know you said you'd walk the aisles or just two or three would be there. And so we're counting and believing that. Lord, now may we hear and take something home ourselves. Name of our precious Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. All God's people say, "Amen." Now, let's sing it like this. Lord, I believe. Yay. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Yes, Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Amen. You can be seated, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; This poor prostitute there crying, weeping, and the first thing you know, here stood the Simon, the big guy, all got him to come down and said, shows whether he's a prophet or not. You know what kind of a woman was? That hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So after she got through and Jesus never moved his feet, you sat looked at her and watched her. Oh, I like that. Hey, &gt;&gt; it's not the big things that we do. It's the little things we leave undone sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He watched her. Just watched her sat there. Nobody's paying attention to him. Finally her in there crying and washing his feet kind of paid attention to him. Got the attraction of the people and he just watched her and never said a word. Old Simon stand back there said, "You see whether he's a prophet or not, don't you? Told you. Told you if he was a prophet, he know who that woman was. You see, we were the great church. You see, we know. So we know he's not a prophet. You know it after after she got through them tears of repentance running down her face wash Jesus' feet. Yeah, I believe you felt a little refreshed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I like to been there. &gt;&gt; I would wash them again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Boy, wouldn't a woman have a hard time wiping her feet with her hair today? She have to stand on her head to do it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Cut it all off. But Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There Jesus feet. Nobody panic critical sitting disgraced that stink on his feet. She washed it after he got after he got through. He looked down at her as if saying, "All right." Looked over said, "Simon, I got something to say to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You invited me here and you never met me at the door. You didn't give me any water to wash my feet with. &gt;&gt; You never anointed my head when I come in. take the parchment of the sun off of me. You never give me any kiss of welcome. Want to come in? But this poor woman. Oh, &gt;&gt; this outsider, a prostitute on the street. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She had no water to wash my feet. And she washed them with her tears. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She had nothing to wipe them off with, so she took her hair. She wiped them. She's continually kissed my feet. Now I want to say to you, her sins which are many are forgiven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Never said nothing about his. &gt;&gt; Your sins which are many are forgiven. And today when Jesus standing outside the door of the Pentecostal organizations, &gt;&gt; Baptist organizations, Methodist organizations &gt;&gt; trying to get back in with Pentecost again. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people are passing him by &gt;&gt; after you your worldliness and things has pushed him out of the church. He's standing trying and crying to get back in again. And boy, it's the most pathetic thing I ever seen in my life. &gt;&gt; Had no deed of him. Him outside knocking trying to get in. That's the same thing he's trying to do. Why? Why? He was outside. They never throw him out. They still sang of him, preached about him, but had never missed him in their presence. That's right. They were going right on. Why? They were nearsighted. Just look at their big building. They were rich. They were looking at the great organization they belong to, trying to build it up, get more members to come in. And they didn't miss him. No. No. They didn't miss speaking in tongues. They didn't miss the great powerful messages of God who cuts down to the heart and circumcises the heart, &gt;&gt; tears off the things of the world and shucks you like a piece of corn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, they if you preach like that in the church that house you out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the way the Holy Ghost preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You generation of vipers, you you snakes in the grass and John did you and great anointed man always tore the hide off of them." &gt;&gt; Right? But they didn't miss him because they didn't have that. See, so they had a little flowerly something patting them on the back and said, "You just join, put your name right here and and we'll take you in your membership and you go get your paper from the other church and we will receive you and and so forth." Now, your pledge will be how much each year? See, that's it. Rich have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; Oh, but you have need of the greatest thing and haven't got it. &gt;&gt; Jesus standing outside trying to get back in with Pentecost. What do you think would happen tonight in the Methodist church if the Holy Ghost fell upon the church and they begin to shout and jump in speaking in tongues and act like a bunch of drunk people while the the conference and throw that Methodist church out of the conference? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that. What would happen to the Baptist church if it happened? Same thing. Pentecostals. Well, there's many of them happen the same thing. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yes, sir. They wouldn't put up with that nonsense and say why they even spoiled our new carpets. My my what a miserable bunch they are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, all right. He was once with them. He walked with them in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. And here is the answer. Denominations and their worldly things, their bishops, cardinals, and all their worldliness had ousted him out and they never missed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the church. Now, what are we going to do to get him back in? If he's outside the Pentecostal church now, what are we going to do to get him back in? Will it take a unanimous vote of the people to bring him back? Will it take electing of a new pope, new cardinal? Or maybe it'll take u it'll it'll take rising up a new denomination. That'll never take it. No, &gt;&gt; that'll never do it. A new denomination won't do it. A new uh uh a a new cardinal won't do it. A new pastor won't do it. A well- paid evangelist won't do it. There's nothing in the world can be done but you yourself. How do we get him in? &gt;&gt; Not by vote. No sir. We don't vote Jesus back in because he won't come in. Hear it. Here it is. If any man will hear my voice &gt;&gt; and open the door. &gt;&gt; Now we know what the door is in. &gt;&gt; If any man will open the door, hear my voice. Not now. If any church, if any organization, no sir, he don't deal with them. They're dead and gone to begin with. &gt;&gt; He hates it. He always hates it. He said he hate it. He hates it yet tonight. But if any man, any Methodist man, any Baptist man, any Presbyterian man, any Catholic man, any Church of God man, Nazarene man, Pentecostal man, any man that will hear my voice and will open the door, I will come in and suck with him and he with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the message to the Pentecostal church. not try to revive the Pentecostal organization but revive the Pentecostal blessing in an individual's heart. That's the only way and I will suffer them in the healing. What does the messenger to the church message to the church teach us then? Uh teach uh teach us not the growth in the spirit. No sir, decline of the spirit. We have a decline all the time. The method the the messengers to the church and the message to every church age condemn denominationism. Every message to the church the church is constantly on the decline and wouldn't listen to it. The message to the church was disregarding denominations and it made hybrid Christians so-called. That's right. Who know nothing about God or the Holy Ghost. That's as true as I stand in this platform tonight. the fine lukewarm members only to be spewed out of his mouth. Paul warned the Gentiles was a branch. Now I want some of you if you will to turn to Romans 11th chapter the 15th to the 27th verse just so you can mark it down you all and I've been slate I will quote this to you now just before leaving because it's a now Romans if you want to put it down 11:15 to 20 uh to 27 Paul told them talking to the Gentiles there the Romans he said if God now listen as we're closing on the church ages is Paul said, "If God did not spare the original olive tree, but cut it off because of unbelief." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What caused them to be cut off? Because they rejected Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, &gt;&gt; they made fun and blasphemed the Holy Ghost. When Jesus is here on earth, he said they called him Beyb said he was a devil. He was a fortune teller. Whatever more he said, I forgive you for that. But when the Holy Ghost has come, don't you speak against it. &gt;&gt; Because you speak against it, it'll never be forgiven you. &gt;&gt; And remember when Jesus commissioned his disciples not to go to the Gentiles, is that right? &gt;&gt; But go rather to the lost sheep of Israel. How did they condemn themselves? By blaspheing in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Calling the spirit of God an unclean thing. Made fun of them when they were dancing in the spirit and so forth on the day of Pentecost. That same city, they made fun of it. Titus killed them in there and their blood went out the gateway. They ate their own children and everything in that same century. &gt;&gt; That's right. One of the greatest nations of the world become the lowest and scattered to four winds of the earth &gt;&gt; because why? &gt;&gt; Unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was the original stump, the original tree, Israel. &gt;&gt; Did old Paul say there? Who's got the scripture right there? Got it, Pat? Stand up and read from the 15th to 27th verse. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead? For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy. And if the root be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild olive tree were grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fattness of the olive tree, boast not thyself against the branches. But if thou boast, thou beest not the root, but the root. Thou wilt say then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in. Well, because of unbelief, they were broken off. &gt;&gt; Listen. Unbelief. All right. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; And thou standest by faith. Be not high minded, but fear. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed, lest he also spared not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God, on them which fell severely, but toward thee goodness. if thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again. For if thou w cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more shall these which be the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, there shall come out of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. &gt;&gt; Do you get it? Paul said if Israel come up and seen the signature of the Holy Spirit and was cut off remember because they rejected Paul's message &gt;&gt; baptism in Jesus name &gt;&gt; repentance and baptism in Jesus name signs and wonders following the believer and they rejected it and they said lo we turn to the Gentiles is that right &gt;&gt; let's see I believe it was at uh where they first called Christians was at um anyhow. Now, now if um if the first tree was holy, it branch is holy, the original tree, and because they disbelieve the Pentecostal message that Paul was preaching, is that so? &gt;&gt; God cut him off &gt;&gt; and took a wild olive tree, which was the Gentiles, us, and grafted us in that we might live off the the substance of that tree. Now, how much more in this day when we are rejecting &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal message that's come down through the church ages, &gt;&gt; how much more is God able to take that old wild tree off of it anyhow and let the other come in because he will reject it because of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Now, dovetail that with the lesson this morning. &gt;&gt; You know where we're standing now, don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes. We're at the end time for the taking away of the gentile church, the rapture for it, and the issuing in of the Holy Ghost to come upon the Jews and Jesus to make himself known to seal the 144,000. There you are bringing back the original tree back into the blessing into Israel again. Jesus ain't going to stand outside of your door and knock all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a time when he'll get enough and turn away. Then you'll do the knocking, but you'll never find him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come while it is time. Come while there is a knock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you compromise with anything less than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like they got at Pentecost with the same type of water baptism. The same things that they did there. Don't you let nothing put anything in your heart less than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to you, my Catholic friends, let me tell you something. that you believe in the Virgin Mary. Virgin Mary being the mother of Jesus Christ had to go up to Pentecost and be filled with the Holy Ghost and she act like a drunk person. She was among them 120 &gt;&gt; had the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and acting like a drunk woman &gt;&gt; out there under the spirit of God. And if the Virgin Mary had to do that in order to get into glory, how are you going to get in anything less than that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Baptist. &gt;&gt; That Baptist preacher back here wants to be sure this said to the Baptist also. That's for anybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't care who it is. So just joining church and saying a creed and going to church every Sunday morning won't do you one speck of good. &gt;&gt; You're only making a mock out of God. &gt;&gt; Either be a real Christian or don't be anything at all. &gt;&gt; Be either hot or cold. &gt;&gt; Either be out because you can't be. You never did see a black white bird. Need see a drunk sober man. You never did see a sinner saint. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, you don't. They don't make them. You're either filled with the Holy Spirit and God living in you or you're not at all. You you are or you are not. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you must you must remember that Jesus stands at your door and remember God's promisure &gt;&gt; that he will in these days because of what? Rejecting what caused Israel to be cut off the original tree. &gt;&gt; Amen. because they rejected Paul's Pentecostal message. &gt;&gt; And do you believe this is the last church age? &gt;&gt; Bible said so. And what's going to happen to them? They're going to be cut off because of rejecting the Pentecostal message &gt;&gt; and then God will return again to the Jews &gt;&gt; and all Israel then will be saved because he'll take them as a nation. Not as an individual, but to you and I, it's individual because he come to the Jews. Acts in the book of Acts, he came to the Gentiles to take a people out of the Gentiles for his name, &gt;&gt; his bride, a people. One here, one there, one over here. And he deals with us as individuals regardless of race, creed, or color. He deals with us as individuals. It's his bouquet that put on his altar. But as the Jews, he always dealt with Israel as a nation. They are a nation of people, his nation. I'm glad tonight that we had this message. And I'm so glad that you attended and your attendance has been so appreciated by me. I'm grateful to Almighty God for him letting me see what I have seen and being able to deliver to this church. And now it's off my heart. For some time, the Holy Spirit dealt on my heart. I couldn't shake it away. I just had to go with it. There's two things I felt led to do. Go to Shreport, Louisiana for a meeting with brother Moore. My wife sitting there can tell you for weeks I almost cried. I want to go to Shreport. Why? And anybody was there at Shreport know why. Now they never seen or heard anything like it. Preachers coming from everywhere. Baptists and different kinds. One man say start put his hand on the ice box and the Holy Spirit come up on him and said go to shreport Louisiana you'll be told you there what to do told him my name the word of fine said he'll tell you what to do I said the pool's open at the bottom of the steps you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there so things like that people speaking and and prophecies and things of predicting things that happen right there among us then I said I must go to Jeffersonville and write this book because I don't know how much longer I've got to be here. But if I express this and it goes on writing after I'm gone, the words will live on. &gt;&gt; I've got the history wrote down which will go in the book and I come here to bring it before the church to find the inspiration of the Holy Spirit because I didn't know these things myself. That's true. That's in the name of the Lord. That's true. I did not know him. Now I feel delivered. I feel that God has brought us a message. I believe that we're at the end of the road. &gt;&gt; I believe that the hour is sure for the manifestation of God to be made known among us. &gt;&gt; And I don't know how much longer it'll be. But the hour is soon at hand. We'll be looking for that great one to rise. He might come in my day. He might come in the younger days. I don't know. He might be right among us now. We can't tell. The Holy Spirit is here to lead us to that time. And when this leader will take his order, he'll still be anointed of the Holy Ghost. Amen. The Elijah will of course that will come but he will be the leader that will turn the hearts of the children or the hearts of the children back to the father's message &gt;&gt; back to our heavenly father's message on the day of Pentecost when he poured out his spirit which that little line I brought it just as close as I could by the history of Bible and show that that thing has come right down through the church ages and that's it today show that denominations is a curse before God &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; I hope that's settling in your mind Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; By Bible, by the acts of the apostles, by the history and all that. And there is never one time that God ever organized his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mother of organized churches is the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Roman Catholic Church. It's the mother of the organizations. And as soon as the revival breaks in any Protestant group, they go right back and do the same thing. And the Bible said she was a and her she had daughters which was churches off of her. They had to be women to be harlots. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There she is. So we're setting. But he also said this, "Fear not, little flock. &gt;&gt; It's your father's goodwill to give you the kingdom." &gt;&gt; So may we all at that day, you Methodist Baptist, whatever you are, whosoever will open the door, I'll come in and suck with him.

When there's no foundation stable, go to the rock I know is able. Go to the rock. I go to the rock of my salvation. Going to the stone that the builders rejected. Running to the mountain and the mountain stands by me. When the earth all around me is sinking sand. Christ the solid rock I stand. When I need shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Where do I hide? Till the storms of life are raging, where do I turn to? When those winds of sorrow blow, is there a reuge in my time of tribulation? When my soul needs consolation, go to the rock. [Music] I go to the rock of my salvation. Go to the stone that the builders rejected. Running to the mountain and the mountain stands by me. When the earth all around me is sinking sand, Christ the solid rock I stand. When I need shelter, when I need friend, I go to the rock. Oh, I go to the rock. I go to the rock of my salvation. Go into the stone that the builders rejected. Running to the mountain and the mountain stands my feet. When the earth all around me is sinking sand on Christ the solid rock I stand. When I need shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the rock. Amen. And I'm so glad for that rock this morning. &gt;&gt; We'll slow it down just a bit. We'll go to the key of C and sing about what heaven means to me. In a country where no twilight shadows deepen, [Music] unending day where night will never be. A city where no storm clouds ever gather. [Music] Lord, this is just what heaven means to me. What will it be when we get over yonder and join the throne upon the glassy sea? We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever. [Music] Oh, this is just what heaven means. Let's stand as we sing this last verse together. [Music] Oh, when at last we see the face of Jesus [Music] before whose image loves all. But when we crown him Lord of all, I'm going to be there. Lord, this is just what heaven means to me. What will it be when we get over yonder [Music] and join the throng upon the glassy sea? [Music] We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever. [Music] Oh, this is just what heaven means to be with all your heart one last time. Oh, what will it be when we get over yonder and join the throne on the glassy sea? We'll join our loved ones and crown Christ forever. [Music] Oh, this is just what heavens to me. Amen. We'll go ahead and have our brothers come this morning.

We'll read a scripture, get started. I appreciate the prayers. Everybody's been ta telling me they've been praying for me, and I sure uh I sure need it, and I really appreciate it. I don't take that lightly. I believe I believe people when they tell me they're praying for me and I sure uh will accept those prayers and um I've also been praying for you though I don't know each individual name I pray that God will be here and have his way. &gt;&gt; Uh we'll start at St. John the first chapter. We'll start at the 31st verse the 35th verse sorry. All right. The Bible says again the next day after John stood and two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, "Behold the lamb of God." And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. Then Jesus turned and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, which is to say, being interpreted, Master, where dwellest thou? He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day. For it was about the 10th hour. One of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. He first findeth his own brother Simon and saith unto him, "We have found the Messiah, which is being interpreted the Christ." And he brought uh and he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, "Thou art Simon the son of Jonah. Thou shalt be called Cphus, which is being inter is by interpretation a stone." The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Philillip and saith unto him, FF follow me. Now Philip was of Bethada, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith unto him, we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathaniel said unto him, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Phil Philip saith unto him, Come and see." &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Nathaniel coming up or coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile. Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, "Before that Philip called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee." We'll ask the Lord to add the blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated. Little bit of a lengthy scripture. a lot in there, &gt;&gt; but uh I'm not real good at titling messages, but if if I'm going to title it, it would be where dwellest thou? Is there any good thing that comes from that place? So as we as we see in the scripture and I always like to make note, you know, when whenever you meet this Jesus, you see this is a this is a this is a the story of these disciples meeting Jesus for the first time. And I I know for a fact from my own testimony when I met Jesus, yeah, I might heard of him and I I might have uh I might have even been in his presence from time to time, but the first time that he spoke to me, &gt;&gt; he he told me who I was. &gt;&gt; He he he told me exactly who I was and what my name is and everything about me. Kind of like these folks here. And &gt;&gt; and I'm telling you this morning, if you haven't met him, you could meet him this morning and he'll do the same for you. &gt;&gt; You know my testimony. I spent many years not knowing who I was, &gt;&gt; not knowing who my friends and my family was, but when I met him, he answered all those questions. &gt;&gt; And I'm so I'm so thankful for that. &gt;&gt; He He'll do it again and again and again. But I would like to pull a couple things out. And you know, you you see when when Philip met him and I like I like how every occasion was a little different. &gt;&gt; The the response to it was just a little different. &gt;&gt; But the end result was they followed him. &gt;&gt; The end result is that they believed him. &gt;&gt; So So Jesus just had to tell Philip, "Hey, follow me." And Philip's like, "Okay, let's go." He he must have he must have recognized something there. Huh? &gt;&gt; Well then, like many of us when we first meet Jesus, we respond like Philillip. I know for myself when I first met Jesus and he and I had my encounter with him, I had to go tell somebody about Jesus. &gt;&gt; I had to go tell somebody who I just met and and I and I found him. The one that everybody's been talking about. The one that everybody says is so great and wonderful. The one that will deliver you from all of your sin, all of your shame, and all of your guilt. The one that will heal you. This this Jesus, this promised word, I I met him. Come and see. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and and uh as Philip comes to Nathaniel, when Nathaniel now, he's hearing it from from Philillip. And maybe there's people that we've encountered and we've told and and they were good people, but the response wasn't exactly how we thought it would be. &gt;&gt; But don't count them out. &gt;&gt; You can't count them out. They if if they don't know, they don't know. &gt;&gt; You didn't know at one point. &gt;&gt; You don't know until you know. &gt;&gt; First give them the opportunity to come and see. &gt;&gt; But we see Nathaniel's response. He said, "Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Any good thing come out of that place? You know, we know a little bit about Nazareth, don't we? We uh you know the funny thing though just want to hit this note. The funny thing is he was the only good thing period. &gt;&gt; You see Jesus told the rich young ruler &gt;&gt; is there anything good but God. He was the only good thing. Period. Right. &gt;&gt; But but yet not knowing yet. Not knowing yet. He he he questioned it just a little bit. Not not because of because he didn't meet him yet. He didn't know yet. But because of the place that that Jesus was identifying with because of the place where where Jesus Jesus of Nazareth because of the name that was connected to him. Because of the place that was connected to him. He had a little bit of doubt that anything good can come from that, &gt;&gt; you know, and I don't want to get ahead of myself, but there's that's the that's the good part. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; but let's just let's just talk about Nazareth for a moment. You know, the scholar said that Nazareth a part, he had right to be skeptic of uh Nazareth of somebody that comes out of there. They didn't even basically know where it was on the map. There you put it on the map. Not only that, they felt like they were a little too influenced by the Gentiles as well. So, how could this great Messiah on top of that? &gt;&gt; On top of that, the Messiah didn't come out of Nazareth. You know, but sometimes we don't know the full story. &gt;&gt; You know, I could only tell you so much this morning. You know, your your your parents, they can only tell you so much. &gt;&gt; Your friends, they can only tell you so much. &gt;&gt; But but you're only going to know if you come and see. &gt;&gt; You're only going to know if you come and meet this Jesus yourself. &gt;&gt; You're only going to know. You're not going to know the whole story. You're not going to you're not they're not going to be able to explain this to you. &gt;&gt; You just got to come and see. But Nazareth, it wasn't a it wasn't a good place. Uh it was there was a lot of prejudice there. There was they everybody thought they were better than anybody that come out of Nazareth. So So this is what brother Brandham said about Nazareth. He said, 'Look, there wasn't a meaner, wicider, lower, this is in God of this evil age. He said, look, there wasn't a meaner, wicider, lower prostituting city in the world than Nazareth. And out of there, God chose a virgin. &gt;&gt; Could any good thing come out of Nazareth? you know, and and I just want to linger on this for a little bit as we work our way through. And and I I imagine you're putting some of the dots together. I'll help you a little bit. You know, we we see certain situations in life. We s we see certain people in life. We see we see certain things in life. We go through certain things in life. And the question may arise, could any good thing come out of this? &gt;&gt; You you see some terrible terrible situations? &gt;&gt; Um, and you wonder, I've wondered how how how is there anything good going to come of this? That's right. &gt;&gt; How, for example, and all I got I got my testimony and I won't do it all over again, but I I got to hit a couple places because that's where I came from. &gt;&gt; That's how I know Jesus is real &gt;&gt; because he revealed himself to me &gt;&gt; and he showed me that he is he is there. He was there all the time &gt;&gt; and in every situation, in every circumstance, &gt;&gt; he he was able to bring me through it. Yeah, I was talking and there's some young people in here. I was talking to a young man uh we just had uh youth camp up there and and I know he he struggles he struggles with depression. He he struggles with taking his life. We'll just be candid. And and he's a a good young man. Everybody loves him. We all love him. But the devil, how how evil, &gt;&gt; how sick the devil is. He just torment a mind like that and tell him how alone he is and nobody cares and all these all these things that you're not going to make it through. You're not going to make it through this time. You know, and maybe the devil, he's not attacking you to that degree, but he he comes every once in a while and tells you you're not going to make it through. Maybe it's not your life, but maybe it's uh in this message, maybe it's in this word, maybe it's in your faith. He'll try to come to you and tell you you're not going to make it through. But but church, just like I told the young man, all the evidence that I've ever seen in life tells me that you're going to make it through. &gt;&gt; Because just look back on life and look at the last problem that you had, that that you were going through and now you're through. Look at the problem before that that you were going through and look at where you're at now. And it's not that problem no more, but now it's another problem. But you came through that one and you're going to come through this one. &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil tell you that you're not going to make it through because the word of God tells us that we're going to make it through. &gt;&gt; It tells us that we can't be lost. We can't be be deceived. that that we can't lose because we are in Christ Jesus because we have faith in the son of God. &gt;&gt; We believe on who God has sent. &gt;&gt; That's a side note, but you're going to make it through this morning. &gt;&gt; And and if there's a circumstance or a situation that looks so dark, looks so hard that you the devil tells you that, well, could there any good thing come out of it? Has God ever proved that good things come from hard situations? &gt;&gt; You know, for me, I've seen it in my life. I've seen it in my life. My my dad, he passed away when I was very young. You think how what good thing what possible good thing can come out of that, you know, and and I can tell you that every one of his children by the testimony the the the elders obtained a good report, church, and by the testimonies of other saints and other people that knew him. And I've hearing it all my life and my sisters and my brother hearing it all our life. It did something to us. My dad's testimony. And maybe if I if he became more common to me or common to us, things might have been different. I don't know. But I'm just I'm looking for the good thing. I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; And the good thing this morning is that every one of us believe this message. &gt;&gt; Every one of us is serving God. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And and no matter what situation it looked like in life, and trust me, I've been in some dark ones and some bad ones, God had has brought it out. That he was in it all and that he was in control of it all. And that though it was a dark place, it was only that I could recognize what light was when I seen it and appreciate it when I've seen it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There there's nothing like like being free from your addictions. being free from your your anxiety or your oppression. Yeah. I've been telling this testimony lately because I believe we have to testify about what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; And and my mind was so messed up. I couldn't even tell you the things that I thought. They're they're so dark and ugly. But and I couldn't think straight. I never thought, you know, I couldn't even I couldn't even read until I got saved and I was 22 years old. I couldn't read. The reason I learned to read is because I love this word. &gt;&gt; I love the word. What? Let me know more about you, Jesus. Let me in. At first, you're just trying to stumble through it and just trying to, you know, figure out what's even being said. But, uh, that's how I know God. He He talks to us by his word. &gt;&gt; He reveals to us himself by his word. &gt;&gt; But I say that because God, he fixed my brain. God God, he healed my mind. &gt;&gt; He He said, "Be not conformed to this world, &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the word of God is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But let's let's move on. Let's go in some of these maybe some of these other situations. That's just mine, but let's look at some of our other uh brothers and sisters. You know what about Joseph? Everybody know the story of Joseph. &gt;&gt; You imagine you imagine being rejected. Maybe you don't have to imagine it. Maybe it's happened. Maybe it's happened to you. Maybe maybe people start looking down on you because of whatever you you plug in the situation there and they start kind of envying you or or maybe thinking all kinds of evil thoughts about you because of your experience with God or whatnot. And so that's what happened to Joseph because he was spiritual because he had a he had a a gift and he had favor with his father and we know the things and his brothers, they decided to throw him into a pit. First, they said, "You know what? Maybe we'll kill him. And if somebody didn't stand up, then they would have done that." &gt;&gt; They're like, "Well, let's throw them into the pit and maybe we'll maybe we'll uh maybe we won't. Then they sell him into slavery, you know." And we hear so much in the modern day about um the sins of the past of this country and the slavery and all that. We know I mean yeah we talk about that and it was horrible. And maybe that gives us a little glimpse of of how ugly a situation &gt;&gt; that the children of Israelite was Israel was in &gt;&gt; and that Joseph was in. You know, I I went to uh Ghana one time and there's a place called Cape Coast and that's where uh a huge portion of slaves that was their last um that was their last time that they had feet in Africa. And from that castle, they would go out and go wherever they were going to go. And a lot of them died on the journey, as you know, maybe. But I was in there and there was dungeons in the in the bottom of the castle. dungeon dungeons. I've never seen anything like this. I mean, I was It was a spiritual moment for me walking through that and I was looking and they'd have a little little squares on the wall, not bigger than these pictures here. And if the sun was not on that side of the castle, they were in total darkness. And only when the sun would come on that side, they would have a little bit of light. And they would pack hundreds of them, 300 maybe or more in a place maybe as wide as this row and not even as long. And they just they all live there for months at a time. And they would throw food in a hole, you know. It was like it was such an ugly disgusting condition that these slaves were in, you know, and and I I just it makes me cuz God, you know, God shows you things and stuff like that. That's the condition that each one of you were in. &gt;&gt; That's the condition that I was in. You might have not been there physically, but spiritually Amen. &gt;&gt; You were you were barely being maintained. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were living in filth. &gt;&gt; You know that they were living in filth. They had no toilets in there. They had no bathrooms in there. They were just smooshed together. They were living in the filthiest conditions you can imagine. And spiritually speaking, that's what we were living in. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we are at &gt;&gt; before the the the great emancipator &gt;&gt; came and did what he did to set us free, &gt;&gt; you know, and I I just can't imagine. And I'm going off my notes a little bit, &gt;&gt; but I I can imagine that if one of those slaves got an opportunity to be free from that condition, &gt;&gt; to to be set free from they where they were, and enter this enter the light, come out of the dungeon, have a bath, get cleaned up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then they they said, "All you got to do is go down there and tell somebody where the door's at, &gt;&gt; and the rest of them can go free, too." &gt;&gt; Do you think that slave would keep it to himself? You think he would hold that back knowing the condition of his brothers and sisters? Or would he go down in the dungeon and tell him, "You can be free. &gt;&gt; The door's that way. There's light. There's food. There's water. Whatever you have need of, go that way. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's my desire. &gt;&gt; That's my desire. That's that's that's what I that's what I do. You can be free this morning &gt;&gt; from the darkness that the devil has placed you in. &gt;&gt; The thing is, it's a bluff. He tricked you into staying there. You don't have to stay there. You could walk out of the dungeon, &gt;&gt; walk towards this Jesus, you know, but some but sometimes for Joseph, he had to go through this. He had to go through this. But I'm going to move move along. The Bible says, Joseph says, "But as for you, you thought evil against me." You know, the world thinks evil against you. People think evil against you. They try to do harmful things. The devil, he thinks evil against you. He's just He's just playing into the hand of God, though. &gt;&gt; He He is just playing in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; He He hates it. He really wants to win, and he tries very hard, &gt;&gt; but he keeps losing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God meant it unto good &gt;&gt; to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive. &gt;&gt; I don't have all the time to go into each one of these stories, but I just want to hit them to kind of bring out this point. See, he had to go into the dungeon, be rejected of his family. Brother Brandham said he was a perfect type. The &gt;&gt; perfect type. &gt;&gt; You know, and and he had to he had to uh be falsely accused, thrown into prison, &gt;&gt; but everything he touched prospered &gt;&gt; because God had a purpose for him. And all the trouble that he went through being separated from his family, he loved his dad. No doubt. He he loved he loved being uh a part of the tribe and having his little place, you know, tell on his brothers and things. He he had a good spot. He But now he's in a in a horrible condition, falsely accused. &gt;&gt; Everything he tries he tries to do good and and bad things keep happening. &gt;&gt; Has that ever happened to you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're you're trying to do good. You're in you're in a bad situation and you're just trying to do good and more bad things happen. Well, hold on. &gt;&gt; Just hold on. Could anything good come out of that? Just come and see. &gt;&gt; Just come and see. &gt;&gt; What could God do? What could God do with it? If you have faith in God, he can do wonder wondrously. Marvelously. Yeah. I got a couple other points. You think anybody I I think you guys are maybe you're not some of you, but it looks like we we got some from all walks and all and it's good. It's great. That's that's the way it works. You know, we come into Christ or maybe we're just interested. Maybe like I said, these these different these different brothers, these different people had a different encounter at a different time &gt;&gt; and they had a different response, &gt;&gt; but the end result was the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So maybe you don't know the story, maybe you do. Tamar and Judah, if you that's in uh Genesis 38. I'm not going to go through it all, but I'll run through it real briefly. So Tamar was Judah's firstborn son's wife. She was a Canaanite. And and the law says, well, first of all, Judah's first son, he wasn't a real good guy. So God God killed him. God slew him. That's what the Bible says. Um and left her a widow. Now, the law says that if there was uh brothers that could marry her to keep the the lineage of the of the other brother going, then they were to marry her. So, Judah gave one of his other sons. He had three sons. Gave the other son to her and he wasn't the best guy either. He wouldn't do what he was required to do. And God took his life as well. Then Judah promised Tamar that that okay when my last son gets old enough you can marry him and bring forth seed. Now this the story is so great I can't get into all of it. It's really beautiful. You know you know Jesus he was promised to come out of the line of Judah. He was promised to come out of the line of Judah and uh it didn't look like there was much hope. look like a pretty bad situation. &gt;&gt; Really look like how how could how could God fulfill his promise? &gt;&gt; You know, you you might be in a place in life, you're looking at situations in life and things the way it's going, and the devil might tell you, "How is God going to fulfill this promise to you? &gt;&gt; How is he going to save your kids? How is he going to save your grandkids? How how is he going to fix this addiction? How is he going to fix this, that, or the other? &gt;&gt; How is he going to do it? It doesn't look like a good thing can come out of their situations or the situation that's uh at hand. Just like Tamar and Judah. Now, now Tamar, she she really wanted to bring forth children. She uh well, we we'll we'll kind of fast forward, but what she did was she she disguised herself as a prostitute and placed herself where she knew Judah would be coming by, Judah, her father-in-law and she she tricked him to go in onto her and and conceive a child. And you know, she took some certain things. She had a plan. She was kind of mischievous, huh? There was a lot of deceit going on. There was a lot of immorality going on. There was a lot of lying going on. You know, Judah, he he he was lying, too. He told her that he would, but out of fear that that the same thing would happen to his last son, trying to protect the promise. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we try to protect the promise. &gt;&gt; Or sometimes we try to bring the promise to pass. &gt;&gt; We try to get when we get our hands all over it and we wreck the promise itself. We we interrupt it. We can't stop it. Nothing's going to stop it. But we might interrupt it. &gt;&gt; And we might make things a little bit more challenging than they had to be. &gt;&gt; But if we could just stay with the word of God, stay with our own word. We say we trust him. We say we'll follow him. We'll say we'll do these things. Well, let's do it. And allow God to work it out in our lives. &gt;&gt; He'll bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; If God had said it, he'll do it. &gt;&gt; Period. And that's and that's just the way he is. &gt;&gt; That's the way this Jesus that we serve is. &gt;&gt; Well, try to make it a shorter story. She did conceive. And then they went and they told on her and they said, you know, Tamar, your daughter-in-law, she played a harlot and now she's pregnant. And Judah said, well, she needs to be burned. You know, &gt;&gt; he was going to kill her. But then she had those little tokens &gt;&gt; to prove &gt;&gt; what happened. &gt;&gt; And Judah said, "You're more righteous than I am." &gt;&gt; You know, and out of that, out of all that mess, &gt;&gt; out of all that trouble, &gt;&gt; that's where Jesus came from. &gt;&gt; God chose that line, that lineage. It's it's in Matthew that lineage to bring forth the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Oh, think of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There there's more stories. We know we know Rahab. &gt;&gt; Same situation. Not same exactly, but she was also a harlot. &gt;&gt; Also a a uh condemned situation in our eyes today. &gt;&gt; If we're looking at somebody like that, we're looking at a a somebody, you know, she lied too. They asked her, "Hey, did the spies Did you see anybody? Did you see somebody coming here? We're looking for them." Oh, yeah. No, they're not here. They They left. She lied. They were hiding on the roof. Could any good situation come from that? &gt;&gt; Her whole house, not just her, but her whole house was saved &gt;&gt; because of what she did. Because she believed the word of God. You know, you might be in a in a dark, messy situation, but you believe the word of God and and you and your whole house &gt;&gt; could be saved. &gt;&gt; You see, God, he's not a respector of per persons. &gt;&gt; If he done it for one, &gt;&gt; he'll do it for another. And if he'll do it for another, he'll do it for you. If you just stand on that same word, stand in that same place and approach it the same way. Brother Brandham said, "God is obligated." &gt;&gt; You know, all all these situations I think of Egypt back to the slavery thing. Can you can you imagine 400 years to to some it never ended? &gt;&gt; They lived, they died. &gt;&gt; They had children, they lived, they died. &gt;&gt; And all the while there's people believing God's word. &gt;&gt; You know, we some of you have been doing this longer than me, a lot longer. And you see people come and go. You think you see things happen, you see dark situations, people go back into slavery, people people do all those things, but you remain in the promise. &gt;&gt; You know that good things can come of this. &gt;&gt; You know that that there there's there's light and &gt;&gt; go. &gt;&gt; You know that darkness might be all around and death might be all around, but there's a reason for it. And all you got to do is believe the word of God and act on the word of God. And you don't have to be a part of that. &gt;&gt; You could be separated from that. &gt;&gt; And God can show his glory &gt;&gt; in your life. &gt;&gt; But in order to do that, he had to have the other. &gt;&gt; What about Paul and Silas? say Acts uh Acts 16:22. We'll read this little portion. I like this. He said, "And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes and condemned to beat them." Now, a little backstory. I'm not going to read the whole thing, but they were there preaching the gospel and uh this diver, which is like a a witch or a fortune teller, started following them around, telling them that they come from God and and you know, saying these are men of God and they have the word of God. And Paul kind of got sick of it because she was doing it for a while. So he cast that demon off of her and her handlers, the one that were making money off of her her um witchcraft. They got mad and they started an uprising and this is what it resulted in. And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison ch uh charging the jailer to keep them safely. who having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks. Let's go to 31. Let's just jump down there. Now, we're skipping some for time sake, but basically they found theirel in a bad situation. They praised God anyways and God set them free. All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now here they are. Now this jailer finds himself in a bad situation. &gt;&gt; He finds himself, oh, I was doing things against God. And this God is actually real. &gt;&gt; That that I found myself in that situation before. I was doing things against God. I was out of the will of God. I I was I I I rejected his way out at the time. Not completely, not fully. Can't do it. Neither can you. By God's grace, But in the flesh, that's what I was doing. &gt;&gt; In my mind, that's what I was doing. &gt;&gt; And and this jailer, maybe not knowing, but now he knows, found himself in a bad situation. &gt;&gt; And he was going to kill himself. He was gonna because, well, all these prisoners have escaped. And Paul said, "Don't do it. Don't do it. We're still here." you know, &gt;&gt; and then Paul gave him the way out. Ain't that something? &gt;&gt; In Paul's bad situation, &gt;&gt; in Paul's dark circumstance, &gt;&gt; he was able to in in Paul's prison, he was literally in prison, he was able to free somebody else. &gt;&gt; If he never ended up in that situation, this jailer would have not had the opportunity. See, God has a way of doing things. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord to all that were in the house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he in all his straight way. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; I can't wait to meet I can't wait to meet that guy. You know, I can't wait to meet all these that just they recognize something and responded when they heard the truth. And that's why many of you are here this morning. &gt;&gt; You might not even know that you heard the truth yet. &gt;&gt; You might not even know that you're responding. You might not know what has drawn you here this morning. But there's something rather somebody that has drawn you to this place. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; So that you can hear from him. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; So that you can come and see. Jonah, this is my guy. I I can relate. Jonah running from God, finding himself in a great fish, which how I relate, a great trial. Running from God, doing the opposite of what God told me to do. And now I'm in this great trial, this belly of darkness, this slop. &gt;&gt; And there's no way out seemingly &gt;&gt; and and really, I mean, you got to put yourself in the feet of Jonah &gt;&gt; just for a moment. Brother Brandham said they tied him. They they tied him up and and they were trying to figure out why the why was the gods angry with them. They were about to go down in the ship. They were on the sea. And so they cast lots and guess what? It was Jonah. You know, hey, they they still didn't want to throw him out, but they tied him up and they threw him over in the midst of a raging sea. And to top that off, a big fish eats him. like that's a pretty bad situation, you know, h how could it get any worse? Well, Jonah might have been wondering, there's no good in this. I messed up. I met you. You know, we hear the end story, but this was a person who had a brain and a mind just like you do, who had thoughts and he was in a bad situation. So just put yourself there. If you were ever in a bad dark situation and the thoughts that the devil gave you, no doubt Jonah had them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If you think you have symptoms, what about Jonah?" &gt;&gt; See, Jonah, he had them &gt;&gt; and he was in there. And but there was something inside of him. It wasn't necessarily the place in the belly of the well, but it was the place inside of Jonah that that recognized that there was a promise and there was a truth and all he had to do was was act upon it. &gt;&gt; He, you know, he believed it because he acted on it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so he acted upon it. And guess what God did? He delivered him out of the depths of the sea, out of the belly of the well, and the well puked him out on the on the shore of Nineveh where he was supposed to go in the first place. &gt;&gt; But God used that situation because that's the only way Nineveh would accept it. They were worshiping that that false fish god. And you know, I thought often I was in the belly of alcoholism and and drugs and depression. And one day I got spit out on the shore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I can tell people, &gt;&gt; you don't have to worship that false god. &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in that beast. You can be free. &gt;&gt; You can live a victorious life. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is repent from what you're doing and look towards the same promise I'm looking at. What good can come out of that? You know that situation? Backsliding preacher. You know, Brother Brandon preaches it both ways. Backsliding, but also in the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; You figure it out. I just believe it. You know, he he took that guy. And when Jesus came, &gt;&gt; he said this about that situation. For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the wells belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the hearts of the earth, in the heart of the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonas. And behold, a greater than Jonas is here. &gt;&gt; God in flesh called back to that situation and identified himself with it. Not only that, but the the very thing that we're all looking to, the very thing that everybody was looking to. He took that guy who was running from his presence and made him an example of the resurrection &gt;&gt; of the way back, the redemption, the fellowship back with God. He He took that guy and he said, "As that guy was, so will the Son of Man be." Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what good can come out of that place? &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor calmliness. and when ye shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Not only did they think Nazareth wasn't good enough, they thought the actual human being. &gt;&gt; What good can come out of this? &gt;&gt; He wasn't anything to look at. &gt;&gt; You know, our our lives, us, we're nothing to look at. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're nothing to ad uh aspire to be. At least I'm not. I can just speak for myself. &gt;&gt; Nobody aspired. And I'm with good company. &gt;&gt; What the best company. The Bible says nobody desired that. We'll drop a few more. And it tells us what nobody desired. And And I just love I just love the scriptures. I love it. Who had believed it? Who believed this report? Who who though there was nothing to desire, who desired it? Who whoever desired it? Whoever believed it, to them it was revealed who that was. &gt;&gt; And who that was, he did this for us. Talk about an ugly and dark situation. It said, "But he was wounded for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. &gt;&gt; The chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray." We've all been in bad situations, huh? We all went the opposite way. We have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. &gt;&gt; Every person in here, &gt;&gt; every person of the world, not just what you did yesterday, not just what you've done today, this morning, even not what you've done just in your lifespan, but what you'll do tomorrow and the day after if the Lord carries. And not just you, but everybody in the world. He put the iniquity on himself &gt;&gt; and he took the beating &gt;&gt; and he and he took he took the jarring and the and the ma being made fun of and the pulling of the beard and they spit on him and they put this big heavy cross on his back and they took a crown of thorns and they stuck it on his head and as he was screaming in agony I I don't imagine his mom thought this is good. I don't imagine Mary thought this is a good situation. I don't imagine anybody standing around witnessing that thought this is a good thing. I imagine maybe some of them might have said if I was standing there and thinking could there anything good come of this? &gt;&gt; What good can come of this? &gt;&gt; Oh, why are they doing this to him? &gt;&gt; What? How could they do this to him? He's done nothing wrong. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And even his friends, they reject they they they uh denied him. &gt;&gt; You know, the ones he was walking with and talking with and they loved him, no doubt, but fear &gt;&gt; but fear, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; got a hold of them. &gt;&gt; And they didn't have the courage or strength. They would get it one day though. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, you don't have to be in that situation. You can have it now. &gt;&gt; You can have it now. But Peter, he wasn't as fortunate as you. So, he had to deny Christ. He couldn't he couldn't beat he couldn't beat the word of the Lord. So, he had to do it. No doubt feeling guilt and shame. &gt;&gt; And then seeing this happen. &gt;&gt; You know, Judas, Judas, he regretted what he did. He wished he could take it back, &gt;&gt; but it was too late for him, you know, and and he must have thought he must he he didn't believe it. He couldn't believe it. It's it's a that's a hard thing. Some people just can't believe it. But that don't give that don't stop us from trying. That don't stop me from trying. I don't care what they say about me or what they think. I don't care what they've said or what they've done. You know my I told my testimony last I keep calling back to that but if you were here my friends killed one of my other friend. They killed him then they try to cover it up and um you know they got busted and it's just a terrible thing. It's a it was a terrible terrible thing. And I and I thought, you know, I was thinking on this and I thought he didn't they didn't mean to do it is what the evidence shows. Things got out of hand. It happened and then instead of calling for help, they try to cover it up. And you know, one of them was my my really good friend. Um not the one that passed away, he was also a friend. We all friends together, all of us. But this one was my friend and he had a hard life. He had a real hard life. Um his mom was a street lady and on drugs and she had so many children and she didn't know where any of them were at besides these two. She had two children that uh were still together. Everybody else was all spread out. And his and his grandma was his everything. She took care of him. She gave him shelter. did her best and at that same time she passed away and left him with the house and he had no way to support it and he was losing the house and and he was also uh an addict. So things were just out of his control. And then this happens, right? He wakes up. There's a sh there's a stuff going on downstairs in his house and two of his other friends are beating his other friend. Beat him up. And then they would go too far. And so they take the friend out and dump him in the in the uh river and he stays back and he tries to cover it up. Well, they all they all get caught and they all go to jail. Now he makes a deal and he gets out after a few years, but uh you know I that's just thing in my past. you know, it's a thing that happened in my past and and I moved on from that, right? I have moved on. I'm I'm I've been walking away from that past ever since. You know, the Bible says repent. Repent and be baptized. &gt;&gt; And repent just means turn from &gt;&gt; You're turning from that old life and you're turning to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now, I've been walking my walk towards Jesus. And sometimes God will bring now the the way God brings your past and the way the devil brings your past are two different things. &gt;&gt; And we need to recognize that. &gt;&gt; See, the devil would have told Jonah a little something different about his past. And maybe the Bible scholars of that time might have told Jonah's story a little different, but Jesus brought that past back up and it was different than anybody thought. So, I'm just saying this to say, you know, uh, ugly things, situations happen, but that shouldn't harden our hearts. &gt;&gt; That shouldn't turn us from the grace of God for others. &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying, not everybody can receive it. &gt;&gt; People live in a in a dark place. They live in a hard place. They live in a confused state. And there's nothing they can do about it except turn to Christ if they would. I was drinking coffee, getting ready, doing making my schedule and whatnot, and uh see this guy out of the corner of my eye. Can you know how you can just feel somebody staring at you? I knew he was just staring at me. So, you know, I'm doing my thing and then I look up and I recognize him, you know, and it was Kenny. Kenny was his name and he looked rough. Looked like life was not too friendly to him. And I can tell you of a truth. I can tell you by the grace of God when I looked at him, I just wanted to give him Jesus. &gt;&gt; I didn't think of the things that he's done. I didn't think of the place that he's been or the whatever transpired after all of that, the 14 years of life that he lived on the streets and all that. I didn't see that. I saw somebody who needs Jesus. &gt;&gt; Somebody if they could only accept it, it can change their whole trae trajection in life. &gt;&gt; And so I said, "Kenny." And he just lit up. He just lit up &gt;&gt; that I recognized him and that I would actually not ignore him &gt;&gt; or put him down like the rest of the world and separate myself like the rest of the world, but I would invite him to have some coffee with me and maybe hear what Jesus did for me. Now, I I haven't seen him since. He hasn't come to my church. I don't know where he's at, but I I pray for the man. Pray God will will use that. We'll do something. I pray that God will will do something for that man that he would make a step towards Jesus. &gt;&gt; And that's my prayer for for all of us. You know, that's why Christ died. &gt;&gt; I don't know how long I've been. You see, we too often look at these things naturally. &gt;&gt; Nazareth, look at it naturally. &gt;&gt; How could something good come out of that natural place, of that that area of land, out of that community? You know, we look at things naturally. But but you see maybe in all these different situations, right? The woman at the well, we know her story too, huh? We look at it naturally and it looks like a impossible situation &gt;&gt; and a hor and a horrible thing that there's no good in that. It's all bad. But you see God, he doesn't look to the natural place. You see all those people including you I believe come from somewhere else. They come from another place and it's a good place. It's a good place. I believe that before there was time that God ha had had you somewhere else. &gt;&gt; That God had you in mind. He had you in a place in his mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he had a desire in his mind for you &gt;&gt; and all the things that you've had to go through, all the dark darkness and the trials and temptations that you've fell to in order that he can manifest this thing, this place that was in his mind. &gt;&gt; You see, this is what brother Brandham says about the woman at the well. You know, they would say she come from Samaria and she was a hybrid. Not only that, she was a prostitute. So, there was a lot of bad things. She didn't come from a good place. You know, Samaria, it's when Israel when they split, Judah took one, Israel took the other. Samaria was the capital of Israel. Every king after David or after Solomon was uh was evil. in Israel. And then the Assyrians came in and they mixed and they had the Samaritans. Now, that's where the Samaritans come from. Not only did they never repent, they went away from God. Then they hybrid with the enemies and and they weren't pure blood no more. It was a bad And not only that, she was a prostitute. Could any good thing come from that place? Brother Brandham says, "But here was a little ill-famed woman, a prostitute, down in her heart, well, she had a representation of one of God's thoughts." &gt;&gt; There she was waiting waited in sin. But when she seen that happen, she said, "Sir, I believe you're a prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll tell us these things. What did it do? It cleansed her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the redeemer to her because he could lift her up from where she had come from. If he can do it for her &gt;&gt; and he can do it for me &gt;&gt; and there's something inside of you that that is brother B said do you feel that pulsating is there something when you hear the words of life say there's something to that &gt;&gt; I I that sounds right that sounds good &gt;&gt; could any good thing that pulsation He said she had representation in his thoughts. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm counting on. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm count. I'm not counting on my situations in life. &gt;&gt; I'm not counting on my good works. &gt;&gt; Though when you meet him &gt;&gt; and like you said, he pulled her out. He pulled her up. He cleansed her. &gt;&gt; That's what he'll do. That's what he'll do for you. That's what he's done for me. It wasn't by my own doing. &gt;&gt; I was I was just fine wallering. &gt;&gt; But when I recognized the condition that I was in, that wasn't good. There was much better. &gt;&gt; There was much better. Yeah, there it's right. The situation's not good. But can there be any good that comes out of it? Just read you some quotes here for the the last little bit of this. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Try to finish this up. Said, "Notice, when Jesus came and manifested the word, because the word discerned the thoughts that was in the heart." As Hebrews 4 says, it will 4:12 that he would, the word was the discerner of the thoughts of heart. and he come as the son of man, the prophet. What happened? This priest with only intellectual learnings said it's a devil because that's what his denomination called it. What did it do? He had no representation. So it blacked him out. I think brother Paul might have read the quote where the religious spirit is the worst one. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't want that. Black you out. But there's another spirit that has representation, and that's what we want. But this little woman had nothing to present. She was a filthy and dirty as she could be. But notice way down in her, &gt;&gt; she's got representation. &gt;&gt; See? And then she was looking for this to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There's something in you. &gt;&gt; There's something in you that wants to see Jesus, &gt;&gt; that wants to see the Christ manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; There's something in you when you see it happen that comes to life &gt;&gt; that says, "Oh, this is what they said would come." &gt;&gt; And he says, "I'm it." &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. But I know when I seen it, &gt;&gt; when I seen it, my whole life changed. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer what I used to be, but I'm something different than what the devil told me. I I'm I'm something different than the lies that he placed me in. I don't come from that place, but I come from another place. &gt;&gt; I have representation. And so do you. If you can just believe the word of God, &gt;&gt; ah believe the one he had sent. You can see him. You can know who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see Jesus, he he he grew up in Nazareth. He wasn't from Nazareth. He wasn't from Bethlehem either. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Out of this evil age where the God of this age has blinded the eyes of people with the dogmas and denominations, out of that very age, God is choosing a people for his name." &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says what and if so this is this is the uh quote that Jesus gave the religious gave the religious when they thought that's too much now you know we stuck around for the flesh and blood speech you know we don't know that we don't know what's going on there but we we'll stick around and then he went a little further and this is when they're like I'm out I can't I can't go there with you. That's too much. But for somebody with representation, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; they stay right there and they say, "Where are we going to go? &gt;&gt; We got nowhere else to go. For thou has the words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; We don't understand it all. We don't know what you're talking about, but we know that you are the Messiah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that this is true. &gt;&gt; He said, "What? if you shall see the Son of Man ascend up where he was before. See, God, he Jesus, he didn't come from Nazareth. He didn't come from Bethlehem. He didn't come from Judah. He didn't come from Tamar. Yet, in the lineage, the Bible does say that that was where he came from out of in the flesh. But that's not where Christ came from. That's not where Christ is or was. &gt;&gt; He said, "What if you see me going back where I was before?" &gt;&gt; Where is he dwelling? &gt;&gt; We We still good. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know how I see it's almost 12. Just I just want to bring it down. Let's bring it down a little closer. Call back to the scripture earlier. Then Jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them, "What seek ye?" They said unto him, "Rabbi," which is to say, being interpreted, "Master, where dwellest thou?" You know, he saith unto them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day. You know, I've I've had that same question before. Where dwellest thou? Where is he? Where is he dwelling? Now, if you ever meet Jesus, you want to be wherever he's dwelling. If you ever come into real contact and relationship with him, there's a reason that they dropped everything and followed him around everywhere he went. &gt;&gt; They wanted to be with him. &gt;&gt; They wanted to be wherever he was dwelling. I want to dwell there. &gt;&gt; Where is he dwelling? And I want to say where is he dwelling now? First Kings First Kings 8:27 just to lay background. But God indeed dwell on But God indeed dwell on earth. Behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house that I build it? Solomon speaking there. Isaiah 66:12, thus sayeth the Lord, the heaven is my throne, the earth is my foottool. Where is the house that ye build unto me? And where is the place of my rest? For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, sayeth the Lord. But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word. That's where he's at. You want to know where God dwells? Where that scripture says he dwells. &gt;&gt; He said, "I made all the earth. I made all the heavens. I made all these things. The heavens is my throne. And the the earth is nothing but something to plant my feet on." He made all the universe and all the galaxy. Told the church the other night, the Almighty, the Almighty. You think of all the storms of the earth, the force of nature takes man out left and right. Whenever there's a flood, whenever there's a a hurricane, tornado, whenever there was a storm, man cannot stand against that. There's a lot of might in that. But God don't just have all that might though. He has that might too. He has that power, too. He has control over it. He showed it by putting his foot on the bow of the ship and saying, "Peace be still." He has power over it. &gt;&gt; But not only that, you know, the sun has storms, too. The sun has storms that are are thousands and thousands and thousands times bigger than our planet. And God has all that might. And if you look, there's numer you can't even count the galaxies and stars. And there's storms in all of them. And there's might and power and forces in all of them. And God has all that might. And he says, "Where am I? What house will you build me? You think you can contain me in a building? &gt;&gt; You can contain You think you can contain me in a in a tabernacle built of hands? &gt;&gt; Where did God choose to put all of this might? &gt;&gt; Where did God choose to put all this power? Where did God choose to dwell? &gt;&gt; Oh, did he choose to dwell in great revelated teachings, great good preaching and all these different things, intellectual uhism trying to make you bigger in your mind? Is God dwelling there? He says, 'When you go to church on Sunday morning, do you look for the fine organ well-dressed minister, a rogue choir, a bunch of women with paint on? What do you look for? Some kind of society in the churches? You belong to this and that? What do you look for? That's about what you see. Listen here. No wonder when No wonder when you carry the flat gospel and see the Holy Ghost come in and make manifest amongst an oldfashioned bunch of people. It's foreign to you. It's hard for you to believe. As I said the other night about Joseph, it was hard for him to think of Mary being pregnant. How could she be that a holy little woman like that? And she said Gabriel visited her. But it was so unusual. It was so unusual for a thing like that. It never happened before. And that's where God dwells in the unusual to the carnal mind. But those who believe him to be the same yesterday, today, and forever. All things are possible. Every word that he promised will be fulfilled. It's the unusual thing that makes him God. He goes to the unusual. He makes everything unusual to the people. Yes, sir. All right. Musicians can come forward. I got a couple more quotes. We'll begin to close. Now, we're bringing it down to where God dwells. Now, they were they were too smart in that day. No longer a slave. They were too smart in that day to catch the meaning of God's simple way or doing things. It wasn't polished for them. It's got to be uh it's got to be polished. It's got to be highly ched or they miss it. Now, but the great Jehovah was hid in his word. And he made himself known to the people that believed in his word by saying uh by saving them and bringing to pass the simple message. The simple message of Noah, God brought it to pass. Now notice that [Music] God's in his word. God dwells in his word. Not big mighty theologies or anything like that, but in his simple message. his simple message. The Bible says, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. [Music] And it became flesh and dwelt among us. Now, it didn't just remain among us. Though it's among us, but it didn't just remain among us. He didn't just remain like brother Levi sitting here. Jesus is not just sitting there in his fullness. He condescended a little bit lower. He came a little bit closer to home, I would say. Is that your home? is my home the home I'm talking about your home as well. He said there's only one real church. You don't join it. You're born in it. See? And if you're born in it, the living God works himself through you and making himself known. See, that's where God dwells in his church. God goes to church every day. I like that. just lives in the church. He just lives in church. He lives in you. You're his church. You are his church. You are the tabernacle that God dwells in. There's just a lot of good There's just a lot of good quotes. &gt;&gt; You want to hear a couple more? I'll just read them. Just listen. This is let that representation respond. Just let it let God minister to you. I said a lot of words up here, but if you don't remember anything that I said, just listen to these quotes and let that minister to the thing that's inside of you, to the good thing that comes from inside of you. [Music] I see a man sitting here looking at me. He's had a little trouble in his life. That could be any of us, huh? [Music] He had the mumps when he was He's kind of got something on his heart. He's looking right at me. His children is all boys. He wants a girl now. You know that man is a preacher. Two, Mr. Bird. Reverend Mr. Bird, raise up your hand, sir. That's true, isn't it? God grants you your request, sir. Yeah. See how simple God dwells in simplicity. Do you believe that? That was the same one that was talking to the woman at the well. That quote right there in its simplicity was the same one that was talking to the woman at the well. How did he know he was a preacher? How do he know that he had boys only? And how did he know that he wanted a girl? [Music] God is in simplicity. [Music] &gt;&gt; See, God don't dwell in big buildings. He dwells in your heart. See, God don't dwell in intellectual education. He's far from it. He dwells in humanity, in your heart. He dwells in his word, and his word comes into your heart and speaks itself out. and declare. He interprets his own word through you. He is trying to find somebody he can get a hold of to show that he is still God. [Music] Could any good thing come out of your life? Could any good thing come out of somebody? When I was 14, 15 years old, they called me drunk John in my town. And when they would see me on the street, I was barely able to walk most of the time. Ask my sister. People would walk away from me. My own friends would not want to hang out with me when I was in that state because I was a drunk. And no doubt there was no good thing that anybody could see in that situation or condition. Could any good thing come out of something like that? My testimony is some good thing came out of that situation. You see, God, he takes a world of chaos without form and void and he transforms it into a garden of Eden into a beautiful paradise that sons and daughters can live on that that they can eat all they need to eat. They can fellowship with him at their leisure. Oh, he takes a chaotic world and he makes a beautiful one out of it. Could any good thing come out of that? Oh, the God that I serve can take a drunk and turn him into a preacher and give him the Holy Ghost that he can go and tell the world that God still saves and God is still real. And hold on, church, because God has good that can come out of your life. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. You have covered me with a melody. [Music] You surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies. [Music] And all my tears have gone. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. From my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Love has called my name. I've been born again to your family. [Music] Hallelujah. I'm no longer a slave to fear. I am a child of God. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God. Amen. This thing he's walking in my shoes. Maybe you don't know this song. Maybe you do. See, he used to walk on this earth with sandals on his feet. Many people would gather around just to hear him speak. [Music] With hands that heal the sick, open the eyes that could not see. Do you think that his spirit now lives inside of me. Now he's walking with my shoes, singing with my voice. Reaching out with my hand. Helping someone make the right choice. Smiling with my face, [Music] showing me the way. I'm so glad that I can be a part. [Music] He's living in my heart [Music] with the voice that spoke and calm the angry sea. [Music] He said one day that you would do greater things than these. [Music] He forgave the man that held him to bet the tree. You think that his spirit now lives inside of me. Now he's walking with my shoes. Singing with my voice. [Music] Reaching out with my hand. helping someone make the right choice. Yes. [Music] Hey, smiling with my face, showing me the way. I'm so glad that I can be a part living in my heart.
