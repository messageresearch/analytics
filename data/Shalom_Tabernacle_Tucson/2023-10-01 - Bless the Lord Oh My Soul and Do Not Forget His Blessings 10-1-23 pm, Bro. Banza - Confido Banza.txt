throne again this evening Lord for this wonderful moment that you've given us to come together to listen to your word to praise and worship you Lord we are unworthy to be here but because of your grace Lord here we are and we just waiting upon you Lord Jesus to do wonders again this evening to give us new Tes monies Lord and to be present in our midst we know that everyone who went to school can read the Bible and he can repeat the word but it's the anointing that comes from you that can make the difference and that can bring life so we invite you in this place again this evening be with us Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ we commit this service in this congregation to you in the name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ we pray and we believe amen God bless you let's take our Bibles and go straight in the book of Exodus chapter 32 Exodus chapter 32 let start to the uh the first verse the Bible says and then the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him up makers Gods which shall go before us for is for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what is become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring bring them unto me and all the people break off the Golden Earrings which were in the ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten cough and they said this be thy God o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron saw it he built an altar before it and Aaron made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast of the Lord and they rose up early on the tomorrow and they offered burnt offerings and brought peace of fairings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and Rose up to play and the Lord said unto Moses go g thee down for thy people which thou brought thou broughtest out of the of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated so this this evening I have a brief message and I'm doing my best to go uh as fast as I can cuz I don't want to hold you long last time when I preached I held you long and that was not good so today uh I'm sure it's not going to happen so I'll be Runing with the time and um I hope this message is going to bless somebody is going to comfort somebody amen it is a pleasure to stand before God's people all the time you know you are so precious and we cannot just take it you know for granted when we stand before you know God chosen people in this age amen so uh the small message that I have for this evening I give it a title of bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefit amen amen because in this life we have problems and consequences when we forget we have no right to forget because a man who forgets is like a dead man a man who forgets can do nothing for the society he's not useful are we together and I was reading actually uh I was checking in the dictionary when they uh they talk about Amnesia I wanted to know like what is the meaning of Amnesia I was curious to know what is the meaning what does that mean uh to to have amnesia what can we learn from that how can we avoid to have amnesia so um at this time what I'm going to do I'm just going to uh read from Mariam Webster I want to read uh the definition of Amnesia amen we start slowly so they said that Amnesia the first definition they say it's loss of memory due unusual uh uh uh usually to break brain injury shock fatigue repression or Illness but first of all it's loss of memory like your memory is empty you can't remember nothing because when someone has Amnesia he cannot even remember who's his wife he cannot even remember his address or the name of his kids so he has a loss of memory are we together and here in Psalms uh 103 David say bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits and as we are reading here this is a popular story in the Bible this is after they crossed the Red Sea they were so blessed they've seen God doing wonders they've seen God doing great things they've seen God divided the Red Sea and on the other side of the Red Sea as they had a lot of things they were blessed they had a material blessings because all of them have had gold you know right here none of us have we have not even a a watch in Gold but they had H earrings in gold everything was gold and when we talk about gold it's all about money it's expensive it's value and they had money they had everything everything was set up for them and now arrogance started they said we can't wait no more upon the Lord I think we can do something for ourselves we cannot depend no more uh just waiting for the Lord waiting for Moses message waiting for the day Moses is going to come back the Bible says they said Moses has delayed to come back and we don't know what happened to him and they were not even worried about praying for Moses they says they said they went to Aaron and they put a real pressure on Aaron you know what right now you have to make us a God we need another God that we're going to worship and due to the pressure Aaron couldn't escape he told them all right so right now just bring all your earrings uh your wife's earrings your sons and daughters earrings we're going to make up some something and Aaron had that that that that's graving tool he made up you know H uh that golden Cal and then people rejoiced they said oh Israel here is your god who brought you out of Egypt here is your God now and you know the Bible says this was a great sin this was a great SC you know in a matter of second in a matter of days they just forgot who is their God they forgot what the Lord has done for them and they started worshiping you know the idol you know they forgot about how the Lord has divided the the the has separated the red they forgot what the Lord has done with all the plagues that he hit with you know in Egypt they forgot everything because of wealthy they were wealthy they had a lot of things and they couldn't uh they couldn't worry no more are we together sir and we realized that when they were in Egypt when they were in slavery they were praying really hard but when their prayer was answered they couldn't pray no more that was the time now to be corrupted and that what happens with some of the Believers you realize that the way you used to pray when you were broke since you got a job you don't pray the same way the way you used to pray before getting a good job that you have right now you you that's not the way you used to pray that's not the way you're praying right now a lot of things have changed because all is well all is well no more time to pray you have a lot of excuses you can wake up early in the morning and pray why because you are forgetting and that why the Lord was praising David he says this is a man after my heart because David all the time was remembering where the Lord got him from David all the time he could remember I was a shepherd and today I'm a king not because I deserve it not because I'm better than somebody not because I'm very special but because of his grace today he made me who I am and I think that the feeling that we are supposed to have as Believers today because if we have a such feeling we want we're not going to be rolling eyes on someone who's weaker than us we're not going to be rolling eyes or looking down on someone who's not dressing like us who's not behaving like us if you have that Spirit if you can remember what we used to be before then we will have empathy that's right to others we will have love to others amen we'll have a burden to others amen we will pray for them because them that we are pointing they're not Believers they're not respecting this they're not respecting this if you have a right Spirit if you have the Holy Ghost in you the Holy Ghost will push you to love that person that you think he's unlovable the Holy Ghost will push you to love and to sustain to help that person who you think is not yet on your level are we together because some Believers some believers they think if they are filled with the Holy Ghost everyone is supposed to be that way and if you are not that way you are condemned they're not like me they don't have my experience yes indeed it's a process brother can you be a little bit patient amen and pray intercede for them Souls that are still struggling that the spirit of a True Believer because you cannot convince me that you have a right spirit and then hate someone because he's weak right hate somebody because he's doing something that he was not supposed to do you need to have that burden feel sorry for the brother approach the brother pray for him love him you know the prophet of God says a little bit of love can kick out demons just a little bit of love if you show love to somebody that can change a lot of things are we together so let me read a quote here and I'm just going to read this slowly even if I can just read his quote and then close I'm okay but as long as I know that you got it right you understand it and just promise me brother banza we're going to apply this court in our lives we can even close the service in the sermon Jehovah Gyra that he preached on February 22nd 1955 I love this with all my heart paragraph 65 let us go slowly if they going to display that so that we can just read all of us together because uh in the morning brother Isel told us why we repeat brother brandham we have no new revelation to bring to you we have no new message to bring to you so we are just we are just here to repeat what the prophet said amen the the prophet of God started start here on paragraph 65 here sometime ago I was up in Ohio in Acron or somewhere up there in Ohio having a meeting and we were eating in a little dunked restaurant nice little ladies all cleaned up and they were ladies every we uh every we of them and they was uh waiting on us it was a pleasure to go there and eat in that nice place well Sunday came they went to church closed up their place just across the way uh I was out in the country a ways of the crossroad crowds was so great couldn't stay uh right around the city so I went across the boys had went in out had to preach that afternoon I'd been Kinder praying all morning and all of them had gone to the meetings but the backer and all and I thought I'm so hungry I'm going to get a sandwich this this was before the meeting the prophet went to get a sandwich somewhere so this is where I want you to pay close attention I went up walked out W walked down the road a little piece and went into uh an ordinary Little Restaurant Little Road place and when I walked I I walked in behind the door the door shut behind me uh really hard I looked and there stood a policeman with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine and uh gamblings uh G gambling is illegal in in Ohio and I thought the law the very law and the man was my age perhaps married or had a family at home I thought oh my corruption filth this the prophet corruption filth I looked back at the table back there and some young boys and lady about little uh young lady about 18 20 years old they ought to be in Sunday School summer this boy drinking back there and oh the way they saw uh they was abusing that girl and her standing and her standing there and letting them do it and I happen to look over my rights and there was an olderly woman sitting better sitting there uh with little old clothes she ordered to to have had a real old about 65 maybe better and she had a a purple makeup on her mouth and on her toenails and her arms a poor old thing was flabby and her hair was boish gloved in little Kinky Curls up on it she she's trying to light a cigarette drunk and two drunken man uh uh with her listen close here I thought this is the prophet oh God this is the prophet oh God how can you look at a such thing I thought my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to be raised up in a world like that God why why this is BR Brown why don't you just destroy the thing take it all off I don't see how you can stand it Lord so the prophet so that that was high level of filthiness Lord why can't you destroy this and imagine the angel of God is asking God to destroy you that would happen this the the angel of God Speak speaking here and to look at s at such thing as that I was standing there doing what criticizing her this brother Bram you know one thing that I like about our prophet he was so sincere he was just telling the truth everything as it happened he was not trying to turn himself as a holy person am he was saying everything right amen because he couldn't forget where God got him from I was standing there criticizing her the two drunks with her got up and went out to be gone just for a while and just then I felt something moving on me I went back and sat down a little B A little booth to the side nobody paid any attention to me yet I was in the dark in the corner and there God gave me a vision because God saw the prophets criticizing that old poor thing why can't you destroy her Lord and then the Lord came with a vision hey hey forget not brother BR forget that and changed my mind and things the vision that he got from the Lord changed his mind and everything am I looked there and I saw a world and there the world was look like a red stke just uh as spray something said this is the blood of of the Lord Jesus who died to save Sinners that's the reason that God can destroy he can't see her he can't every moral being has a right and has a right to accept their salvation until they die and go beyond that blood they don't have to stand in judgment they already judged the day you eat thereof that the day you die but as long as you're here you got right you got a right to the threee of life if you'll accept it listen now then I looked and above it there stood the Lord Jesus in a vision and seeing his thorns on his head and blood running down his face and big Mercury speed over his precious beard and he was jerking his head like that you know uh every once in a while jumping like that I thought what is that my Lord all this Vision because the prophets criticized someone a huge Vision like this just because he criticized an unbeliever and he said that's your sin this is the scene of brother Bram that's your scene everything that you see in the vision that's you sin and I seen that the blood of Jesus to my own sins was acting like a bumper now the Lord is showing the prophet his own sins and the blood of Jesus acting like a bumper on his own sins I wish all of us we need such Visions amen am if it have went beyond that stream of blood there that was ground the earth when he died to settle this uh the sin question if it have went beyond that then God would have killed me just like the bumper to the car to keep your car from being hot the bumper catches the the leak and the blood of Jesus catches your sins father forgive them they don't know what they're doing father forgive them and I look there my why there my name laying there on the old book wrote all kind of things condemned on the name of brother William brandham I crawled up to his feet and I said Lord Jesus will you forgive me then you know he was the one criticizing now he's the one asking for Mercy yes sir because sometimes we think that we are better than someone else oh he just came to church today he's not he's behaving weirdly he's not a brother but remember you were not born a brother you were not born with the Holy Ghost you had to seek the Holy Ghost you had to pray for God to change you amen you had to pray to be baptized amen because all of us for all the people here if you look 20 years back you were not what you are today unless you lie but you were were not you are something else and now you're making a progress on a daily basis as you come to church you are changing your mind sir this Vision changed the prophet mind and when you condemn someone and you read back the word is going to change your mind amen and all kind condemned I crawled up I said Lord Jesus will you forgive me I didn't mean I said you mean my sins hurt you like that what God Said Yes he took his hand and dipped it in his side took his finger and wrote across the book pardoned you are pardoned put it back behind him like that put his arms together and looked at me he said I forgive you didn't I and I I said yes Lord I love you for it he said but I love this question that they asked the prophet now you are forgiven now you have the Holy Ghost everybody who's here let's suppose you have the Holy Ghost and now the angel of God Jesus himself asking brother Bram you are pardoned but why are you condemning her why why are you condemning her because you see in the book you are forgiven you are pardoned so why then you don't think she deserve the same pardon amen you were willing to condemn someone else but look you was condemned you was condemned once yourself and freely he pardoned you he said but why you condemning her that changed my motive that changed my motive amen sir soon as I got out of the vision I walked over there to her you know he was sincere God BL William brandham he didn't say okay thank you Lord it's done he walked over to that lady I said Madam could I talk to you a minute she said oh I have a company I said I don't mean it I don't mean it that way lady I'm a minister of the Gospel I want to talk to you she took her cigarette down and she said yes sir and I said why are you living this like this now the prophet is sweet right for the first at the beginning was like Lord destroy this poor thing but now he's like why are you living like that the sweetness the sweetness now is coming down I said you don't really really enjoy it are you a mother she said yes and she gave me her story and it was a broken a heartbroken story you know some time we judge people without knowing what they've been through and we just so quick to judge but at least you have to to learn and to listen to the story of that person the prophet say it was a heartbroken story a picture of Life uh at the side disappointment and Things She Said sir I was raised in a Christian home I told her why the Lord Jesus rebuked me for condemning her and wanted her blow up for something like that I said lady I want to ask you will you forgive me for having such thought about you the lady didn't know that the prophet will criticizing her but brother Bram now is repenting you know uh most of the time you'll see people repenting maybe because they stole money maybe because they messed up some way or another but I've never seen in my life someone repenting like this brother excuse me I could criticized you I've never seen that in my life other than this in this quote we repent for what we've qualified to be uh big sins something that was seen by everybody something that is training on the news but this was just in his heart but he had to make it right you want brother sister Madam will you forgive me for having such thoughts about you I was asking the Lord to kill you but he rebuked me you know if uh we get this kind of attitude we can have some beautiful assemblies where you just criticize a brother and at the end of the service you go there brother Israel I'm sorry I criticize you when we were preaching sorry that would even that for me will be a sign that the Rapture is ready that we're about to be raptured because now we are conscious yes sir we are not waiting for someone to come to to tell us hey go there and make it right you feel a burden in your heart because a true son and daughter of God when you've done something that is not according to to the word the word in enough is a judge your conscience won't be a peace that's right you cannot critize a brother a sister and go to the restaurant have your lunch in peace what kind of Holy Ghost do you have right very and you come back and they bring the Lord's supper and you are the first on the line we like you don't even feel nothing in your heart and but Isel standing here and you just take the cup you drink knowing that in your heart you have something against a brother you criticize her in the morning oh my and you just and you take even the bread yet the Bible told us examine yourself first before coming forth before coming to drink that that is not a drink like a h an energy drink or you know whatever drink that's something else that's the blood of Jesus and when we are approaching the blood of Jesus your conscience has to be working functioning amen she's she I said will you kneel down here she said certainly she she forgave the prophet she forgave the prophet she said certainly and she said will you pray for me that I'll be saved I said will you kneel down down here she said I will we turn that place into the prayer meeting that's night that's right that's woman got saved see God will provide won't he God will provide he has already provided a way to escape for everyone it started with criticism bad feelings and it ended up being a prayer meeting amen they forgave each other she got saved job well done why because the prophet repented first but most of the time we don't progress in this life because we have very hard heart no matter what no matter who can preach you're not ready to make it right you're not ready to open up your hearts it's like Pharaoh's heart he couldn't repent at all no matter how hard the Lord would hit plagues in Egypt Pharaoh could never repent and there is a quote that brother Israel read this morning they were made to be that way some people are just naturally that way amen but the prophet repented this is Brother William brandham repenting to an unbeliever not his fellow preacher not his fellow brother a nonbeliever again a lady but brother Bram he repented but why don't we make things right how can we have a a lot of talk of anger hatred in our hearts you know against brothers and you go to the same church God sees you because you know uh you can fool everybody but you cannot fool God he knows you he sees what is in your heart even right now he knows what you thinking about me even right now he knows what is going on in your heart because you can't hide God anything the devil knows what is going on and your own conscience knows what is going on Amen in the message our hope is in God 15 more minutes brother Isel so I'm looking at the clock today now it's been 30 minutes 15 more amen all right God bless you br Chris because most of the time when we preaching about repentance people are cold on now people don't want to hear things like this people need you're going to be blessed you're going to be raptured how you going to be raptured with all that stock of anger that you have in your heart that's not true you're still looking down on people how are you going to be raptured amen there is no Rapture without true love in your heart first because 1 Corinthians 13 tells us no matter what I can do without love even if you come to church on Wednesday night you come in the prayer meeting on Saturday morning you drink that coffee cuz we have a coffee most on Saturday morning we take a coffee you take that coffee and on Sunday you come uh to uh to both Services if you have no love in your heart heart you are just a pilgrim if you do everything in the church correctly to get God approval you need to have love am you love everybody yes sir you you're not going you're not going to be there judging people judging people Jud they're not right they're not right you know when you read the Bible the Bible says Daniel was praying for his sin and the sins of his people that's the heart that we need if you think there is something that's not going right pray for them that will prove that you have the spirit of God but just don't be oh you see the way they do things see the way they do things who are you who appointed you to be the judge in the the judge in the church even if you preach and that person is not changing his time will come because we preachers we not the one who change people we just repeat the word of God and God himself takes care of the Soul amen but we need to be patient those who are strong in faith support those who are weak Amen in the message our hope is in God this is also a good one it's short but it's a good one he preached this on on September 29th 1951 we start on paragraph 12 that's what we are we should always is try to do something to help somebody else after all that's the Christian attitude toward things so there is no you can't call yourself a Christian if you don't have that heart that that is ready to help somebody else the prophet tells us it's all about that that's the Christian altitude he says this is a great heavy burden that no one knows nothing about that just God and I alone but when I uh uh when I do get to the bed to bed uh what a wonderful privilege I have to kneel down before God and say father I've done the best that I uh that I know how today I've done all uh that I know how to make life just a little more pleasant for people to make life a little more pleasant for people not to be there judging people make life a little bit Pleasant for people sir amen and I'm sure with his blessings he turns and and returns and make life a little more blessing for me now brother Le listen to this my friend if you want to do something for God do something for his people if you want something good said about you cuz some people they want to be praised they want everybody to clap hands for them they want you know to be lifted up they want you know like all best testimony is to be toward them who's a good preacher him who's a good one him he want they want to be the best of the best in everything so here is the advice of the Prophet if you want to you want something good said about you say something good about someone else that's how it works it's like a circle say something good about the brother someone there will say something good about you amen bless someone else and your blessing uh bless someone else and as you are blessing someone else you are blessing God Jesus said in so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have done it to me so we know that is the truth so may the Lord bless us tonight now as we read his word you need God bless him bless someone else you need a a good testimony about you say a good testimony about somebody else there is no Christianity with selfishness no you are filled with the Holy Ghost pray for the next brother to to get the same holy ghost that you have you have a revelation a great grace Revelation pray for me to have the same Revelation that you know if we can get to this standard the Rapture will be like pretty soon the Rapture will be like very soon I'm reading my last quote now um yeah just five minutes yeah I'm going to finish with this quotes brother good don't yes brother God bless you in the message lifting him up out of history that he preached on October 1st 195 oh that was today brother Israel okay there's something about this quot maybe it came for someone yes sir on paragraph 52 Prophet God says he's talking about amram you know Moses father how he was praying hard when they were in slavery praying God every day praying God he said the prophet says that they were uh considered they were treated like animals in Egypt you know they've been beating them up giving them you know hard task things to do and amam was praying day and night he says I can see amam night after night no matter how tired that proved uh uh his faith in that God but today the people if they don't get everything they asked for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead I've been praying about this for year but you know God is not answering got don't give up God cuz he won't give up you he's able you know we need that kind of faith God is able to do what he said he will do he's going to do it he's going to fulfill every promise to you but you pray just for a couple of years and you are down Abraham prayed for 25 years brother and he was going to church he never gave up on God because he knew that God is's going to do what he said he will do no matter what happens we keep looking to the Unseen faith is the substance of things hopeful Amen brother faith is the evidence is the substance Oh Glory is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that are not seen amen am he says what we need is men and women today of Gallant Spirits men and women who are determined to hold on hold on brother hold on brother William people can hold on on their knees amen till they see God that really Lees come to action that will not take no for an answer am oh my where are these Believers today someone who can kneel down and say Lord I'm not taking no for an answer Glory I'm not taking no for an answer until I see the god do leaves and the ti of this message lifting up lifting him up from history amen because sometimes we read about what God has done in brother branham's life that's all right but we need sometimes to say what God has done in our lives amen amen tell someone am you know this is the message that we believe God has used his Prophet but you know what last month here is what the Lord has done for me go through this message amen that person will have more confidence in that God because he will see he realize that that God is not a god of History oh so he has done this to your prophet and he's doing this in your life be like yes sir he doesn't change he's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen he says H someone who's not taking No for for an answer they are determined to stay with it if they are sick and the doctors said they can't get well yet something within them tells them they are going to be well hold on no matter what take place brother have you joined the churches of the denomination world after you have sabed all your strength from walking from place to place and you still can't find a relief there is still a God that answers prayers and save from sin brother oh my because people they are just good in changing churches I didn't like that church I didn't like that church I didn't like that brother I didn't like that's not going to give you a relief brother just pray be determined hold on until you see that God who leaves amen and as we can see amam on those weary nights back bleeding climbing up the steps again until 2 or 3:00 in the morning praying and seemed like he just talking to the wind down in his Jewish heart there burnt a faith that no Winds of Doubt could ever blow out that's the kind of men and women we need to rise on on the scene today if he doesn't answer tonight brother he will tomorrow night amen if he doesn't answer this year we are just two month away to the end of the year if he doesn't answer this year he will next year for he's a God not a God but a god but the God Amen and we see him night after night as amram climed up the stes and and Jo Joseph would come uh up to him and say amram dear you you you've been up here praying all night why don't you just tell some of the boys where you're working and let them pray a while well honey what if they don't do it somebody has got to do it somebody has got to pray through that the way every Christian ought to feel tonight not waiting for somebody else but take the front yourself brother take the fron ourselves and go through if we believe the Bible to be a history it's also prophetic book that tells us that same God shall rise in the last days and it's time for him to come on the scene we are finishing here uh paragraph 60 and seemingly with we've had a silent God for a long time by the hour has come where he's going to rise on the scene amen one night when amram had prayed maybe for several years and his ha now was turning gray and no Deliverance but just getting worse sometime we pray and the situation gets worse brother the more you pray the more worse the situation is getting that's why you have to hold on Don't Run Away don't run don't murmur hold on be determined even if it's getting worse praise God you you asking God for a job you apply the next day they reject you the same day you pray again you fast you apply they reject you hold on brother Don't Run Away amen he says it was just getting worse one night he got right down to to business that's how we have to do it get right down to business he said God you promised this and we've looked forward to it and we see the signs all here and the time is ahead it's time for you to do something about it while he was deep concentrated prayer praying with all his heart he looked standing in the corner he wbed his eyes and looked again there's two an angel with a sword W with a sword drawn he said Deliverance is coming and you are going to bring a son into the world and he's going to be the one to deliver them oh my what an answer praying asking God for a solution and then the angel of the Lord tells you the solution is coming from you brother you're going to bring a sign in the word and he's going to deliver you amen why he leave I wonder what was the night how was that night for brother amam and then the prophet here says God always answers prayers amen God bless you my time is up just hold on brother God bless you praise will Lord time is up man we thank God for the word this this evening how me enjoy that for forgetting out all his benefits amen praise praise God as we prepare to go to the table of the lord we SE certainly enjoyed that brother bza it was very nice and um it's encouraging to our hearts amen thank god let's take our uh Bibles and stand to our feet and turn into 1 Corinthians chapter 11 man I love that testimony I just I never heard it that way I didn't realize brother bam really repented to that woman told her that like that heard it before but it's so nice to slow the quote down and read it again real sincere real Precious Heart and look what God did God saved that woman my beautiful this is some real touching what God can do no he was wrong but he made it right and then God used him and so so nice that when we are wrong then we can make things right amen this is what we do as we go to the table of the lord we know we've said things that's wrong we've thought things that's wrong and then we come to the uh communion service and then we um examine ourselves with the word and we say Lord forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings and then help us to be pleasing to you and he's faithful and just to forgive us isn't that nice to know that he's willing to forgive us of our wrongs and our sins amen First Corinthians chapter 11 says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it and remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not deserting the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if you would judge if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together un condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen we're going to um um let's sing a portion of a song pleasing let me be pleasing to you you Lord and

you for paying that price we can never thank you enough but Lord but we can be obedient to what youve laid before us tonight and Lord we just ask you to bless us let it not be just a ritual or formality but let the reality of what we're doing just come forward in our minds of Israel coming out of Egypt in the Passover lives were being taken the death angel striking but yet you provided a
