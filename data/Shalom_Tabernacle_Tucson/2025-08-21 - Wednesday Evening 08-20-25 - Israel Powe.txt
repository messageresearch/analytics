Like to ask if you could come open the service up with a word of prayer. [Music] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Gracious Lord Jesus, Father, I just want to say thank you Lord for allowing us Lord to be in this house or to worship you. Father, our prophet taught us we don't know what the day holds but we know who holds the day. And father, may we treat this service, Lord God, just Lord Jesus, as you were standing here present and our prophet taught us to take and picture you as though you were sitting before us. Father, we don't want to take it lightly. Father, we want you to come down and be Lord in our hearts. Father, we ask, Lord Jesus, that you'd forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings, even Lord, as we forgive those that trespass against us. Father, that your Holy Spirit would come down and have its perfect will, his way. Father, that you would speak to our hearts and help us to receive, Lord, what we have need of. Ask you bless the Trevor's songs, these musicians, Father, any specials that would be sung, the ministry that would come forth. We ask for a blessing, Father, in Jesus Christ's name, for thy glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to the key of G. [Music] You have heard of little Moses in the bull rush. You have heard of fearless David and his sling. You have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph and of Jonah and the whale you often sing. There are many many others through the Bible. I should like to meet them all. I do declare by and by the Lord will surely let us meet them at the meeting in the air. Oh, there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by. I am going to meet you, meet you over there in that home beyond the sky. My singing you will hear. Never heard my mortal ear will be glorious I doare. And God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting. If you may be seated. Many things will there be missing at that meeting. For the mourers's bench will have no place at all. There will never be a sermon preached to sinners. For the sinner had refused to heed the call. There will be no mourning over wayward love. There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer. All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted at that meeting. in the air with all your heart. There is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by. I am [Music] reaching all the beyond. sing and God's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in. God's own son. Oh, and God's own son will be the leading one at the leading in the air. Let's go to the key of B flat. When pains of death seized on my soul, unto the Lord I cried. Till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. No, I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not deny as Jacob in the days of hope. I wrestle with the Lord and instant with courage I stood upon his word. I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh, Satan said my Lord was gone and would not hear my prayer. Praise the Lord. The work is done in Christ the Lord. Amen. I would not be alive. Oh, I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be denied. Oh, I would not be denied. I would not be denied till Jesus came and made me whole. I would not be. [Applause] Let's go to back to the key of B flat. Years I spent in vanity and pride, caring not my Lord was crucified, knowing not it was for me. He died on Calary. [Music] Mercy there was great and grace was free. Hearten there was multiplied to me. There my burden soul found liberty at calary. By God's word, at last my sin I learned. Then I trembled at the law I spurned. Till my guilty soul in boring turn to calary. [Music] Mercy there was grace and grace was real. Pardon there was multiplied to me. There my burden over at Calary. [Music] And now I've given to Jesus everything. [Music] Now I gladly own him as my king. Now my raptured soul can only sing of calary. Mercy there was great and grace was free and there was multiplied to me. There my burden soul fell liberty at Calary. And oh the love that true salvation plan. Oh the grace that brought it down to man. Oh the mighty gold that God did at Cal. [Music] Mercy there was great and grace was free and there was multiplied to me and there my burden sold at Calary. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Well, greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Well, Satan's like a roar in line roing to and fro [Music] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible tells us so. And many souls have made his pray to fall in some weak hour. But God has promised us to make his overcoming power. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. And on the day of Pentecost, a maring mighty wind, it blew into the upper room and baptiz all of them with the power gater than any earthly foe. I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going to let the whole world know. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that one more time. Lord, greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Let's all stand as we change the order of the service. We'll go to the key of uh E flat. If you're walking through the valleys and there are shadows all around, oh do not fear for he will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound. For he has promised to never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. God is good all the time. [Music] We were sinners, so unworthy. Still for us, he chose to die. Fill us with this. Holy Spirit, how we can stand and testify. [Music] God is loving everlasting and his mercies they will never end. God is good all the time. He put a song of praise in his heart of mine. God is good all the time. Through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. He's so good. Let's take that first verse. Well, if you're walking through the valley and there are shadows all around, do not fear for he will guide you. He will keep you safe and sound cuz he has promised to never leave you nor forsake you and his word is true. God is good all the time. We put a song of praise in this heart of night. God is good [Music] all the time. Through the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. He's so good all the time. God is good all the time. [Music] All the time [Music] [Applause] [Music] is so good all the time. [Applause] It's good to be in the house of glory with you all tonight. We &gt;&gt; made it back from Columbia, my wife and I, sister to share, and we thank the Lord for bringing us back home safely &gt;&gt; to you all. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly Father, we ask your blessings on this service tonight, Lord, as the worship has gone forth. Lord, we come to this portion of ministry and of your word. Bless every heart. We pray. We love you, Lord. I pray you touch me in my body. Rebuke the enemy that tries to stop us. Lord, we move forward in Jesus name. Claim the victory tonight. Lord, we thank you for all the precious hearts that have gathered here. Lord, may they receive from you, something very special, something very meaningful, something that will impact them, Lord, in their Christian journey. Our prayer in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, baby. Yes. Praise the Lord. We'll take our scriptures as we get right into the word. We'll take a scripture over in 1 Samuel chapter 18. Before we bring these prayer requests to to the Lord, I' like to welcome each of you. In verse one, and it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was met with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. And Saul took him that day and would and would let him go no more home to his father's house. Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle. And David Saul sent him and behaved himself wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war. And he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul's servants. It came to pass as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the women came out of all the cities of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul with tabarites with joy with instruments of music. And the women answered one to another as they played and said, "Saul had slain his thousands and David his tens thousands." And Saul was very wroth and at the same displeased him. And he said, "They have ascribed unto David 10,000, and to me they have ascribed but thousands." What can he have more but the kingdom? And Saul, I David, from that day and forward. Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask you bless your word. Bless your people. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. We have been talking on this authority and of the sons and daughters of God and also uh being faithful in a few things. He'll make us ruler over many things. And we know that ruler the rulership that he's talking about is that next place is the millennium. Amen. We've been talking about that and thanking the Lord for it. It's been encouraging our faith and just what to look forward to. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh very simple. And we see this in these principles of training for reigning in the life of of little King David and how he grew in popularity and this great anointing that came upon him. Now this is what we as the saints of God are going through today. We can take this Old Testament example of King David as he went from just a nobody uh fathering his uh or watching over his father's sheep until he became a great man and the Lord moved him up in in his status really made him a popular young man. I want you to take a scripture that first chapter going over in 1st Samuel chapter 17 just right at the last end of it there verse number 56 and the king said inquire thou whose son the strippling is. And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand in his hand. And Saul said to him, "Who son art thou? Thou, young man." And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. So he was just a nobody. Is that right? They didn't know who he was, but here he is now coming in the presence of the king. I can imagine there's a lot of young men that would love the opportunity to meet their national leader, the opportunity to meet the king. But the Lord brings little David into the presence of the king because of these little lower level responsibilities. I'm just going to take a little bit of time tonight and just share that with you. So good to be back home with you. Did I say hi? Hello, saints. God bless you. But here he is just like an insignificant position. He's carrying over his father's sheep. these sheep. Maybe he has a name for them, maybe he doesn't, but they're definitely um not something that of any great status. He's just a nobody. He's out there watching over his father's sheep. And we'd call this maybe just a lower level of responsibility, his father's sheep. And then once he would prove that faithful for a period of time, we don't know how much time David was in this role as a shepherd boy watching over these sheep out in the pastures there singing by himself in the presence of the Lord. No doubt his gifts to write music and to write psalms were already in him. They didn't come in him after he was anointed. Those gifts that are in you are born in you. You have them in you right now. And the scriptures really don't give us a period of time. But he gradually moved from being a shepherd of his father's sheep to becoming the king's shepherd over his own sheep. And so these animals represented people. Surely if he would have put his life on the line for an animal then no doubt he would have put his life on the line for people. And and the Lord looks at that this way. And we brought that out in many parables that our attitude towards where he has you in life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and we got to know that where you are in life right now, he has you there. &gt;&gt; If your life is in his hand, he put you exactly where you are tonight. And he put you there and he's watching you. My brother, my sister, little one, older one, minister, non-minister, whoever you are, he is watching you and he gave you life. He gave you the opportunity to express those gifts and qualities in that he gave you for for just a small period of time. We don't know what tomorrow holds. But we see in 1st Samuel 17 that the king asked about him, who is this young man? Who's who's his mother? Who's his father? And this came about because remember he had been anointed. And the anointing came upon him. And now he moved from the lion and the bear to Goliath. The Lord uses him to take the life of a great warrior. And so these battles seem to move up in popularity. Um the lion and the bear that's kind of his testimony, his word against everybody else's. But this one with with the with the giant, this one with Goliath was in the presence of all of Israel. &gt;&gt; This one with the giant was the stage had been set. He didn't plan it. He was just going to go and do as his dad told him to go see how the battle goes and encourage your brothers. And while there, this challenge rises up. And David maybe doesn't know he has this ability to take the giant down, but it's already in him. &gt;&gt; And the Lord allowed this stage to be set. Now remember, all of Israel had the opportunity. I think it was 40 days and 40 nights that this boast went out. Give me a man. That's what he asked for. I want a man and we'll settle the battle. And here's David laying in the household of Israel. You know, I was thinking of this great quarterback, uh, Tom Brady, one of the greatest ones. I talk sports a lot, you know, because I that's I come up in that. Many of you know sports. How many of you know Tom Brady is? I don't know if I if you can hear me properly or not cuz I can't. My ears are plugged. So you all pray for me. So but that I can still hear your amen or not. They ain't that plugged. But this Tom Brady was a second string quarterback I think out of Michigan. He's on the um New England Patriots. There's a starting quarterback before him. Forget his name. At any rate, this quarterback gets hurt and they take Tom Brady and give him the opportunity to play. And when they give him this opportunity, whoa, they didn't know that they had the greatest quarterback of all time on their roster. because in the practice and I I relate to that story well because that's how I was discovered on our football team wasn't an injury. We were just getting the snot beaten out of us on this game. Sorry, I didn't mean to say it like that, but you all understand. We're getting beat so bad, brother Joe, out of town and and it was at the towards the end of the game. And so they started putting in the second strings and third string teams in and they put me in, they gave me the ball and I really did well. And so from that time on, I became the starting uh starting position or whatever just in that little school there. And I I knew that feeling because I always knew I can play. I always knew I was good. My close friends knew I was good, but the coaches didn't know how good I was. And it took this opportunity to take place. And the same thing is this was with with Tom Brady. He, you know, this it was a loss. It looks like they lost their their main guy, the guy that all of the scouts said was the better player. He's the best. But when they put Mr. Brady in, he proved himself to be, like I say, the greatest, arguably greatest quarterback of all time. That wasn't the his coach's choice. &gt;&gt; The professionals that should have saw that gift and talent missed it. &gt;&gt; But because they had no other choice, brother John, they put him in. And now you can't argue with his talent. &gt;&gt; And so here is David now. when the Lord wanted to anoint someone from his family, the prophet, the mom and dad, and nobody knew who David was, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I mean, he's just a shepherd boy. In fact, he was asking for Jesse's sons, and he was the last one to bring to come in. They they never saw David as being the king of Israel. &gt;&gt; They didn't know he had it in him. &gt;&gt; This little boy can knock a giant out. Yeah, it's in him. &gt;&gt; And you don't know what's in you either. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Until you come in contact with God &gt;&gt; and the word of the Lord ignites your faith that you can do all things through Christ. That let let me say this. Don't let anybody put a limit on God for your life. If it's in the Bible, if it's in the message, then go get it. &gt;&gt; It's 100% for you. Don't wait for somebody else to encourage you. Don't wait for somebody else to say amen with you. You go get it for yourself. &gt;&gt; And that's a personal coming of of age. That's a personal something that has to happen to you. I'm thanking the Lord. It is beginning to happen to me &gt;&gt; and I'm picking up the Bible for myself and trusting God to help me. And so here's David. Now, he's not well known. It says that um in in Samuel 18 that David was accepted in the sight of all of Israel and also in the sight of Saul's servants. The scriptures go even further to say that and Samuel there that all of Israel and Judah loved David because a and there was a reason why and the reason was the scripture tells us plainly if you take 1st Samuel 17 18 and 19 the Bible says because he went out before them and came in. So here's a here's a man actually fighting for for your safety. &gt;&gt; And so don't tell me you love me or care. Just show it. &gt;&gt; And you know this is better shown than told. &gt;&gt; And they saw David come in and come out as a warrior putting his life on the line. And the people began to love him. The Bible says all Israel, all Judah, even Saul's men love David. &gt;&gt; Not only that, Saul's son, Jonathan, we read the scripture, falls in love with him. And we can only say this is the favor that the Lord gives you when he anoints you. There is a favor that comes with the anointing. The Lord will open doors for you because of the anointing of God that's over your life. Don't think it's your skill set. And you might have skills and don't think it's because of you have this and that or the other. The Lord is with his people. &gt;&gt; He opens the doors &gt;&gt; that no man can open. &gt;&gt; You know, they might they might try to close the door in your face, but if God opens a door for you, it's going to be open. And you can't you can't say you can't give anybody the praise or credit for that. Believe real believers know this &gt;&gt; that everything they have right now is nothing but the goodness of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is why we praise him. &gt;&gt; We praise him because he gives us what we do not deserve. He gives us blessings upon blessings upon blessings. &gt;&gt; That we do not deserve. &gt;&gt; If he gave us what we deserved, &gt;&gt; we wouldn't be here tonight. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't be here tonight. Wouldn't have nothing. &gt;&gt; We'd be out here on the street somewhere. &gt;&gt; Yes. Without destitute, no home, no nothing, no friend, nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the believer knows this. Amen. &gt;&gt; That everything we have, little, much, whatever, mediocre, it all comes from the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Lord opens this up by anointing King David. this anointing as I studied it a little bit more it's just a just taking a small portion in the scripture there it's like the it's like a lowlevel anointing that is given first and then the Lord sees how you responds to those responsibilities and then he blesses you with more. Brother Bham taught us that he favors us and then he brings more as depending on our attitude for what he's given to us. If the Lord has given us a message with the visions and all of the deep things that are in them and we don't care that they're there, then why would God want to show us more? &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? You're not even taking what he gave you. And so I think part of that is our attitude is that Lord just continue to reveal yourself to me. Um I've heard people say, "Oh, we're just listening to a tape." I mean that's that's a shameful. It's like we're just read I read that scripture already. &gt;&gt; As if reading it, the more reading you read it, it has less power in it. &gt;&gt; I'd argue the other. I'd say the more you read it, the more power is in it. I think the more you listen to the tapes, the more anointing possibly that you can receive from that tape. &gt;&gt; Amen, somebody. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil fool you. Don't let people shame you because you listen to a tape in your church &gt;&gt; or you're listening to a tape for your devotion time. I say this, if you don't have a tape devotion time, I would question the spiritual growth, seeing that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel &gt;&gt; and that the ministry of Elijah was sent to turn your heart &gt;&gt; back to the original faith. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so this anointing, we've already read that that these low-level responsibilities and then he favors us with more of the the anointing. All Israel and Judah favored David. Even Saul's men favored David. His daughter, one of his daughters loved David. And then his own son loved David, which actually caused his life to be spared. 1st Samuel 19:2 it says Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David and Jonathan told David saying Saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore I pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in the secret place and hide thyself. So the Lord gives this favor with David. He's a poor shepherd boy. And the king's son, probably the most popular son in the kingdom, falls in love with the poor boy. And this poor boy now, he gives him his sword, gives him his armor, gives him his girdle, begins to give this to him because he loved him. Um, how many's ever had a friend like that? Yeah, &gt;&gt; guys or girls have friends like that. Do you want to give? And this love was granted to King David through the most important boy there was probably in Israel. Later he was able to save uh David's life because of it. Now this um faithful over a few things, he'll make you ruler over many. Um, just looking at this temptation that brother Brandon brings out to us that money, women, and popularity are the things that a man needs to be careful of to watch out for, not just ministry, but any man. &gt;&gt; When God begins to bless a man or woman, &gt;&gt; begins to bless them, then the enemy comes in. And what a stage was set for David. Now, he was a nobody to where all of Israel knows who he is. &gt;&gt; He kills the most popular foe or enemy. He's now very popular. Saul loves him. All the men love him. All of Israel love him. And then these women begin to sing this song about him. And so the anointing doesn't always and doesn't only give you favor, but the anointing creates enemies, too. &gt;&gt; How many know that's true? &gt;&gt; When the Lord begins to bless you, just remember, everybody ain't happy when you're getting blessed. &gt;&gt; I've seen this so many times. You'll see people go forward and God begin to bless them on their career and their job or maybe bless them with the family, bless them in their finances, bless them with a little gift or something. Maybe it's in speaking or singing or a little position. And then instead of others with that same gift or same, you know, area of ministry, they'll begin to compare themselves with this other these others that are being blessed. And that's a temptation that we all have to be careful of. I see ministers do it. I see gifted people who can sing, they do it. I've seen we thank the Lord for our people here, but I've seen where preachers can't say amen to nobody &gt;&gt; but themselves. &gt;&gt; They're only excited when they have the mic in their hand. &gt;&gt; You watch them in the service, they're just disconnected. They can't hardly say amen. I see worship leaders who do this, too. &gt;&gt; They're very noble and quiet in their praise and worship. And then they get up here, they want everybody to be excited with them. &gt;&gt; And I just feel like if you're um like if I'm a song leader, all the other song leaders should have my back. &gt;&gt; Don't let me drown up here by myself. &gt;&gt; I'm just slowly sinking, sinking, sinking, seeking. I can't get a pray. Nobody. That's when the other worship leaders should help &gt;&gt; keep me from drowning &gt;&gt; because you know what it feels like. &gt;&gt; Huh? What about other musicians? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about other musicians? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They should be worshiping with one another. &gt;&gt; And you see this, you see this? And this is a temptation that we all have. You know, can I can I be happy if you're blessed in the service? Is that going to bother me? &gt;&gt; If the Lord gives you something before I get a scoop, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; We're all human beings here. &gt;&gt; Those spirits that Satan likes to anoint people with. You know, Satan was the most gifted and the most talent that he had. He was a writer and it still wasn't enough &gt;&gt; because he wasn't right. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; And when you're not right, you'll be mad at people that have less than you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Jealous of people that have far less than you. &gt;&gt; And so, this is where you don't want to fall in this trap of, you know, being lifted up. As soon as God begins to bless a man, then he thinks he is the only one that has that gift or that talent. I love what brother Brandham says right here in the message influence unconditional covenant sorry 1954 he says and then the next thing is popularity usually when God blesses a man gives him a little ministry he begins to think he's above everybody else &gt;&gt; and that's just the time he's on his road out Yes, &gt;&gt; that's right. See that you never you're no more. No matter what God has made you. And if he's give you a ministry that's so big or whatever it is, remember we're only men. It's God that's all that does it. And we must keep that kind of an attitude and love the people. &gt;&gt; I like that. Amen. And the message influence 1963, brother Brandham says this here. The king got along fine until he found out that all the nations was fearing him. He become largely populated. His kingdom got built up. He got lifted up in his heart with pride. You see? You see, we're just I'm just a big man now. And that's the way out. The way up is down. How do you know which way is up or down? Cuz if the world stand in space, how do you know which is up or down? So always he that humbles himself, God will exalt. He that exalts himself, God will bring to a base. He'll bring him down. Always keep humble and be little in what? &gt;&gt; Your own sight. No matter what God does for you, just see how much more humbler you can be all the time. More God blesses you, just keep getting more humble all the time. &gt;&gt; He can continue to bless. But when you get to the place you think, I got it. You haven't got it. You're on your road out. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, you lose your influence. You lose the strength of your testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Banner continues in 1963 influence and he says this here in November. But if God blesses you, you stay in the category that God has called you in. If it's a housewife, remain a housewife. Excuse me. If it's in a business, remain in that business, reflecting God. Whatever God has called you to, let it be that because he wants you to be a real housewife to reflect your influence upon another person that would want to be a good housewife. If you're a good businessman, let your life so be that it will reflect Jesus Christ in your business with honesty and integrity and with things that really mean something because somebody is watching your life. You're influencing somebody. God has to have a real housewife. Amen. So now this is what we see that soon as God begins to bless a man and I started to think on that and meditate on that a little bit more. Look at what the message search has done or the ability to have the entire tape library. &gt;&gt; Look at what it's done across the board. Has it caused more saints to be in the house of God more? Or have we seen more people stay at home and and and leave church and you know and they leave church with a quotation in their hand. Several of them they can explain their behavior. There's no church. The church can have 15, 20, 30 churches in the city and none of them are good enough. &gt;&gt; I can't find any church that agrees exactly with me, so I'll start my own. That's what Sister Kay would say. Sister Kay would say, "I'm going to start my own church if I have to." And that's literally we see that taking place. And you would think, wow, more of the message, more research, more information that ought to create more love. But it seems like, and I it's not everywhere. It's not everywhere, but we have seen more arguing and fussing, separation. We've slicing it even thinner on why we can't get together. And it's just, it's like the Lord blessed us with that ability to search out all the word. And it really hasn't reflected in a lot of our a lot of the lives that we see. Like I say, that's not all. That's not all. But we see too much of it. You would think that more of the tapes would create more love. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Or more obedience to the word. We don't see that, do we? &gt;&gt; We're seeing more. I mean, it's just another thing coming out next. what's next? And so this temptation that King David had to face. So first look at what he had to go through. His outer temptations were his father-in-law. And this is a tough one. Here's King David now having to behave himself wisely against the Lord's anointed. What do you do when your enemy is the Lord's anointed one? How do you behave yourself with someone that can throw a stone at you, but you can't throw one back? They don't have the discipline to believe everything in the in the word, but you do. And so, you can't never jump down on somebody else's level. God holds you accountable to what he showed you. They might have started it. They might not play by the rules. But you got to play by the rules &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; And this is more a test now of what's inside of David. So this is this is a higher level of the war, not outside, but the inside wars, the wars that work within us. the power to control you, your attitude, your own spirit. And if we can't control that, then why would the Lord need us in a city to rule and reign quote unquote over the heathens if we can't even rule and reign in this little small space of time and we'll lose it on our job. We'll lose it in our home. We'll lose it in working with one. And then it becomes common behavior and then it becomes accepted like &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; the message gives us the okay to behave like this. No, &gt;&gt; no, no, no. At some point somebody's got to change. &gt;&gt; And the word is not going to. &gt;&gt; So the somebody is you. &gt;&gt; And this authority, this this power, it's not power. It's really the authority as brother Vanda taught us. is not power, but he gives us authority. And that little policeman, he has the authority because of his position that God gave him to go out here and arrest a man or make you slow down or make you obey the law. He's just a regular guy. Just has nothing to do with his physical strength, but it has to do with his position as as a um a member of the police force. We are sons and daughters of God. And he's given us authority over demons, devils, and all things that are evil. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So the things that are evil can't rule and reign over us. &gt;&gt; We're to rule and reign over them. &gt;&gt; And God has given us that power and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Is that right? I believe we got to come up higher. I believe that this has to be expressed in a way that maybe we've never seen before. I believe that that the stage is being set for us to move forward in this behavior &gt;&gt; to come with this anointing on us. We want the Holy Spirit, don't we? Yes. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it make you feel good when the Holy Spirit comes down? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, that Holy Spirit might cause somebody to lie on you &gt;&gt; or to come against you. This is scripture. That's what happened with Jesus. Happened in brother Brandham's ministry in his life. We see it happening in the life of King David. So, he goes up to this great position. Now, he's the man of the hour. He's the most popular. He's King David. He slew uh the giant. took his head off. He got his sword. Now he's moved up. Now he's a king. He he he he first gets a position over um the army. Saul made him captain over a thousand. So look at that. He went from taking care of these few little sheep. He was anointed. God watched him, blessed him. Kills the lion and the bear. kills Goliath and now he's captain over a thousand people. That's in 1st Samuel chapter 18 verses 1 through three. Yes. So he raises up in his position. Do you want to stay where you are? Do you want to go further in the Lord? Want the Lord to take you higher and deeper? Here what the prophet says in the adoption number two. Yeah, I remember writing that to my son. Yeah, I remember writing that. Oh, when he say when he saw that, he just screamed and jumped up and down hollering, hallelujah, Lord, take all the world out of me. Make me like that. Yes, sir. And all those things that he done. And the father said, I'm happy for that son. That's a fine son. All right. Keep an eye on him for a few years and see how see how he comes on and how he progresses after a while. The years pass by. How he getting along, excuse me, or a few years. I can behave for a few services, Lord, but a few years. When you going to vindicate me? When you going to make all my enemies go broke? When you going to make their tires go flat? When you going to vindicate that I'm right and they are wrong. He says, "Watch him for a few years. See if he really has this in him. If this character is in him." Really, the one you have to rule and reign over is you. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is your own spirit. &gt;&gt; You know what your weaknesses are more than anybody. &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints? &gt;&gt; Huh? That means I can write out a list what I see in you and you be like, "Please, you missed most of it. You can come and tell me, brother, this this." I'm like, "Man, you just got part of the list. I'm much worse than that. I know my weaknesses." And the Lord knows that you know your weakness is called your conscience. You know unless you're going to lie to yourself, you know what your weaknesses are. Excuse me. And you know when you have overcome and you're growing and I thank the Lord that he has growth for the believer that you can actually be growing like tonight like right now &gt;&gt; like in this prayer meeting &gt;&gt; like Lord Jesus cause some growth to happen in my life &gt;&gt; that's never happened before. Shoot out something in me. A little flower, a little bud, a little growth in me tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what our prayer should be. &gt;&gt; That's really focusing on ourselves right here. What brother Bham says in blasphemous names. I'm going to read these last two quotes here. 1962 in November. And the prophet of God says here, paragraph 166. Now, in the Old Testament, when that son was adopted or placed into the family, his name was just as good on the check as his daddy's was. They didn't they had a ring in them days, a sign, a signate. Brother Banner makes a spitting sound and hits the pull pit, spit on it, and place it. There was a signet. He wore his daddy's ring, his signant. And that was just as good as his daddy's. Now when Jesus had been obedient, Jesus to God, God placed him positionally, this is him. Now when the member is born by the Holy Ghost into the family of God and has proven to have these virtues in him that God can see virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness in him, then God seals him or places him. And there that's when you see the sons and daughters of God. Amen. Look at paragraph 175. Same message says, "But when these things are operating in you by God, then you're sealed. Then there's no put on about it." So that's what we want. We want these things operating in us. Not just today, not just when you get called out. Not when you just make a big, you know, big mistake. We can all see it. I make a big mistake and then have to come back and make things right. But we want growth. And I believe that growth is taking place. &gt;&gt; Do you? &gt;&gt; You put the planet in the right atmosphere, give it the water, give it the sunlight, it's going to grow. And I believe it is growing. I believe you have to believe that what you're doing, God is in control of all of it. &gt;&gt; You don't know the strength that's in you. You don't know when you're going to have to face a David, but we sure hope you got an experience with the lion and the bear somewhere. &gt;&gt; Has the Lord did anything for you? &gt;&gt; He has. That same God that did that for you, he can do more for you, &gt;&gt; even greater battles than you've ever faced. &gt;&gt; And um I don't want to I don't want the next battle if I'm not ready for it. &gt;&gt; But then I do want the anointing because it makes me feel good. And I want the anointing because I know that's what I need. But I don't, you know, but the challenge to deal with those wars that lying within me. God have mercy upon me. Here what the prophet of God says here talking about this great gift. Now this is way back in the 40s in the beginning of his ministry and the Lord is showing him putting him on the field of service and this is what he says here. It's in 1948 paragraph 48. So now shall we bow our heads now for prayer? Father, realizing that I'd be afraid to step into this realm now without you would hold my hand. Now, my mind is going back to around two years ago when in the room that night, the angel of the Lord came walking in there and said, "You are been born in this world to take a gift of divine healing to the people. Many will not believe you, yet many will. If you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you, not even cancer shall stand before your prayer. So there's some people not going to many people won't believe you. The angel told him that many people won't believe you, but many will. So what should he focus on? Getting the people to believe him. You don't focus on those that don't believe. You focus on those that will believe and nothing would stand before your prayer. Not even cancer. And God revealing himself to his people. He says this in 1950. He said as a prophet Moses was given two signs so will you be given two signs. Said first will be that you'll be able to detect diseases by your hand taking the patient by the right hand in your left. And if you'll be sincere when you pray and get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray, nothing shall stand before your prayer, not even cancer. See, he spoke cancer. That's the only disease he said. And he says, then if you'll be sincere with that, it will come to pass that you'll you will tell them the secrets of their heart. Said them will be the two signs. And he said, "And I said, I will go." He said, "I'll be with you." &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord showed him about getting the people to believe. Not all will, but many will. And if you can get them to believe you, believe what? Believe that the angel of the Lord came to you and gave you this commission. Say it. Because that's what the truth of it was. Say it. No matter how ridiculous it sounds, tell them. And a lot of people are not going to believe that. Even to today, they won't believe it. But how many here believe it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I believed it. &gt;&gt; Could I please talk for a minute? Just because the Lord is really bothering me right now. &gt;&gt; Could I share a testimony? &gt;&gt; You have a testimony? &gt;&gt; Yes, please. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; If you don't mind. It's just God's been bothering me the whole this whole time that I got to share it. My name is Ta and I'm here tonight and I'm definitely here for a reason. Um, this message was definitely for me. I have been growing a lot the last two months with my walk with God and um he's been showing me my gifts at work and I'm walking the distance my kids and their husband and their husband are becoming um the more happier I am, um, the more proud I am of myself, um, they're becoming more distant. They're not, they're not, it's just the enemy is definitely using my kids against me. &gt;&gt; Um, and everything that um, everything he's coming full force towards me, but I keep going and keep going and keep going. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Sunday I was supposed to be here with Jonathan. And God knows that my heart is my animals. I have three dogs and two cats and I just love my animals and they've been through a lot with me. And um I thought I was going to have to put one of my dogs down on Sunday. And I was all ready to come here to church with Jonathan and everything. And my de my dog was like almost not breathing. So I just I just rebuked the devil. I kept praying. And I'm like, "Okay, I understand the enemy doesn't want me to go to church. My kids didn't want me to go to church because they even at their church, they were like they did they were like they we invited them here and they're like, "No, I'm not coming." So it was like I everything was against me on Sunday. &gt;&gt; And um so I stayed. I just loved I I read I prayed the Bible. I watched Elevation Church with my dog and held them and Jonathan said he prayed. It's like a it was a miracle &gt;&gt; straight from God. He's 100% didn't have to go and spend any money on vet bills or nothing. &gt;&gt; And then tonight I was going to come here. I woke up this morning and my sciatic nerve hurt so bad I couldn't walk. I couldn't walk until 4:00 today. &gt;&gt; I I could barely walk. &gt;&gt; I was crawling and crying in pain today. &gt;&gt; And I was going to go to urgent care and then with my insurance, they wanted a co-ayment, so I couldn't afford to do that today. I have to go back to work tomorrow because it was my day off. I'm like, God, you you healed my dog because I love him so much. I'm growing in you. I'm doing everything and being obedient. just tell me. And and he just reminded me. He just reminded me to put the armor on, the full armor, walk. No weapon formed against me will prosper. And just keep going and keep going. And until 4:00 today, I seriously could barely walk. &gt;&gt; And he goes, "Do you want to continue to grow?" And I said, "Yes, no matter what, I will be obedient and continue to grow." And I'm here today walking. So this message &gt;&gt; and this is my church. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; He also brought me to this church. Praise God. I was looking for a church. &gt;&gt; This is the church he sent me to. So this message and everything is a confirmation tonight. So I just want everyone to know. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Bless you. &gt;&gt; Let's give her a hand. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So the Lord knows how to make the service interesting. Some of y'all woke up quickly. So, God bless you. Thank you for that. And I was just wrapping up on the message here. And you know, Brother Brandham had to tell the truth about the angel of the Lord coming to him. And he told that and if you can get the people to believe you, be sincere, then these greater gifts would be accompanied in your life, in your ministry. And we see that and that will happen with each of you here tonight as well. If you're faithful over the little bit that the Lord has given you, he will open up so much more for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. Thank you. If the musicians come, we have a few prayer requests here. I think I actually brought them out tonight. Sister Ernie Bolan, Jeff Elkins, um, father-in-law needs prayer requests. Remember, Sister Barb, Sister Barbara's brothers to keep them in prayer. Brother Bobby and I Mike Wartz. Um, so happy to have brother Joe with us tonight. Joe Galante. Praise the Lord. Happy to have brother Art, sister Annabel as well. Was a surprise. And um our dear sister Tila, I believe Tila, sister Ta, you were baptized, right? &gt;&gt; Oh &gt;&gt; yes, I got a picture of that that she was baptized in the name of the Lord. So we thank the Lord for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's stand to our feet as we prepare to take these requests and a prayer request. the more will help us. And then um let's sing that song.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Yes. several interviews. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've had I remember the Lord open the doors for me to get a job and I remember it just so many times. It just you can't see it and he just makes a way and it just brings a contract your way. I've seen him do that so many times. &gt;&gt; I Sometimes you have so much work as a contractor. We have leads and leads and then sometimes you just don't have anything and the bills are due and every time the Lord has always come through for me. I've seen him do that over the years until I got to the place where my faith I know he provides. That's all there is to it. He's going to provide. And so I can say that for you, Sister Heather. The Lord will provide. He's already got the job laid out for you. Amen. Thank the Lord for that testimony from Sister Taylor. Lord, pray the Lord will bless her.
