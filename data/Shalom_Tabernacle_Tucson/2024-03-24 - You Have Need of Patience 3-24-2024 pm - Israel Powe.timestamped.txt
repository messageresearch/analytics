[36:54] little box in the back there it's for
[36:57] the purpose purp of taking some of those

[39:18] were kind of and that was the weekend I
[39:20] went to Warz I had already saw it but
[39:23] the brothers here the board went and
[39:25] looked at that and so we were kind of
[39:27] and looking at going forward with that
[39:30] and um they sent an email afterwards
[39:33] telling us that the developers they need
[39:37] more time and so I'm saying yeah take
[39:40] all the time you need so we didn't you
[39:42] know took that pressure off of us to
[39:45] have to push and move to to to make a
[39:48] decision like that and so we uh thank
[39:52] the Lord for that to be honest with you
[39:54] so we have um until the end of the year
[39:59] at least and maybe even more and that's
[40:02] kind of the the you know the TUSD that
[40:05] we rent from they're kind of loose in
[40:07] their ways and that's been a benefit to
[40:09] us because they don't get in our
[40:10] business and I and they don't bother us
[40:13] and they've been very very We complain
[40:16] about nothing when you find out what
[40:17] other people's are paying for a building
[40:20] of this size oh no you don't complain
[40:23] about nothing so we haven't been
[40:26] complaining but we are conscience of the
[40:29] Saints here you know the air
[40:30] conditioning and and so forth so we got
[40:32] a plan for that and we trust the Lord
[40:35] will bless you and help you as you
[40:37] continue to support I know many of you
[40:40] most of you will still praise the Lord
[40:42] even if we didn't have air conditioning
[40:44] can I get a
[40:45] witness can I get a
[40:48] witness Hey Brother Israel if you don't
[40:50] get that AC fix we're out of here I'm
[40:53] streaming
[40:55] well we understand those things and so
[40:58] we it's available for us and so we we're
[41:01] moving in that direction and we trust
[41:03] the Lord will continue to bless you and
[41:05] help you as you support the the little
[41:07] work here and it's on our heart for this
[41:11] building fund and and and uh doing
[41:14] something in that line as the prophet
[41:17] and maybe I'll bring some quotes on that
[41:18] and then it help you Saints and the
[41:21] trustees will be in charge of that and
[41:23] they'll commission that and keep you up
[41:25] a breast of that another develop for my
[41:28] heart was when I took this trip down to
[41:30] Warz
[41:32] wadz and I met this fine Pastor here
[41:35] with brother arando he here in our
[41:38] assembly and I forgot him and then in
[41:39] war as I saw him again and he's here
[41:42] with us again uh this evening he pastors
[41:45] of church Shalom
[41:48] Tabernacle and so I wrote his name down
[41:51] I'm so bad about that and I just left it
[41:53] on my desk or whatever so what's your
[41:55] name my brother again Cesar brother
[41:57] Cesar yeah yeah brother Cesar and I
[42:00] believe that's his wife um
[42:03] and um and of course sitting next to him
[42:07] is my good friend brother Armando Rivera
[42:10] right Pastor he just drops in on us like
[42:13] this he really should be preaching
[42:15] tonight sure but uh we're going to we'll
[42:19] leave he said leave me alone all right
[42:21] okay I'm going leave him alone
[42:23] tonight all right and so we appreciate
[42:26] our brother Cesar and going down in New
[42:29] Mexico and seeing those Brothers serve I
[42:33] said this is me right here these people
[42:36] are me that's what I actually stood at
[42:37] the P pull pit and I told them I am
[42:39] Mexican the soy Mexicano and they and
[42:43] they looked again are you sure brother
[42:45] po of course if I was in China I would
[42:48] be a China man too so for clarity so you
[42:51] just reone with them and we want to get
[42:55] behind something and I see
[42:58] rushing and the brother you can see the
[43:00] stress on the pastor and his wife
[43:02] they're running these meetings and
[43:04] trying to get something going and at the
[43:07] end you see three people make a decision
[43:10] and it turns out to be six people that
[43:12] get baptized I don't know who wouldn't
[43:14] want to be a part of that I was so glad
[43:17] it just touched my spirit and heart that
[43:20] I should be doing a bit more we should
[43:23] be doing a bit more in the missionary
[43:26] work with the people that we know
[43:28] eyeball to eyeball Pastor to pastor and
[43:32] so I believe that's available to us
[43:33] there are neighbors right next door and
[43:36] I believe the Lord will give us the
[43:38] opportunity and at the same time there's
[43:40] a good friend and Pastor from
[43:43] Jamaica that have been calling me and to
[43:46] come and just to come and be a part of
[43:48] his church I've known him for years
[43:50] maybe 14 15 years 15 years I've never
[43:53] obviously been to Jamaica and he really
[43:55] wanted me to come for Easter time and I
[43:58] know you all would have loved for me not
[44:00] to be here but I decided to stay home
[44:03] for
[44:05] Easter and um but I thought I said well
[44:09] maybe if I asked him I said if we if if
[44:12] I if I recommend a brother to come would
[44:14] you be okay oh we would love that and so
[44:17] I had brother George on my mind and I
[44:20] asked brother George and he was willing
[44:21] to go and so the Lord is going to work
[44:23] that out for him to go and to minister
[44:27] there at the Easter weekend and they're
[44:30] going to really put him to work and um
[44:32] but he's capable and um and I know he's
[44:37] the Lord will bless the people there
[44:39] with the word of God there and they feed
[44:42] the people and so I would like to be
[44:44] able
[44:45] to uh maybe send some kind of support to
[44:48] those meetings as they go forward as a
[44:51] free will offering for that missionary
[44:53] work back to Warz so the Warz meeting
[44:57] were so be blessing and beneficial I
[45:00] took pictures I sent those to Sister
[45:01] Aaron and she put them up on the website
[45:03] now so you can go and see that great
[45:06] work it's on Shalom Tabernacle website
[45:08] just go right on there you don't need a
[45:10] password and you can see 15 or 20
[45:13] pictures or whatever and you can see the
[45:15] pastor and some of those folks and the
[45:18] great work that brother Tito is doing
[45:20] down there and I want to put my shoulder
[45:23] right to that AB no question about it so
[45:27] and this other brother uh here in
[45:29] Jamaica a fine Brother fine Pastor he's
[45:32] getting all the churches he can together
[45:34] they all support each other and mono Bay
[45:37] there and brother George will be going
[45:39] there and we'll be praying with our
[45:41] brother and then um it may be on
[45:45] Wednesday when's your last day here
[45:48] George uh Wednesday night Wednesday
[45:50] night okay so Wednesday you actually
[45:53] leave Thursday Thursday morning early
[45:55] yes okay so maybe Wednesday the Lord
[45:57] willing will take up a missionary
[45:59] offering for Jamaica brother George will
[46:03] make a report they've been building on a
[46:05] tabernacle there for years I've sent
[46:07] them reports over the years I've never
[46:09] been there he send me videos of their
[46:12] their thing and their structure he lives
[46:14] right next door and um and so that that
[46:18] we'll make that available to you to do
[46:20] that amen and um you're always in the
[46:23] will of God when you are doing
[46:26] missionary
[46:27] work if you can't go and send somebody
[46:30] amen amen so that's what we will do we
[46:33] trust the Lord will bless each of you I
[46:35] think that it's all that we have we like
[46:38] to go into the word Hebrews chapter 10
[46:42] quickly and we trust it to be a blessing
[46:44] to you let's stand to our feet as we
[46:47] take this
[46:54] scripture now there's a lot of people we
[46:56] can support there's a lot of poor people
[46:58] right here in this city they come in
[47:00] here they ask us for money I don't know
[47:03] what they're going to do with it but if
[47:04] I know a pastor that's preaching this
[47:06] message and I say that purposely this
[47:10] message the last day truth that's my
[47:13] brother amen and I'm going to stand with
[47:15] him yes sir if the Lord would help me
[47:16] and I believe we can stand with him amen
[47:19] amen Hebrews chapter 10 verse number
[47:24] 3 five
[47:28] the Bible says cast not away therefore
[47:31] your confidence which hath great
[47:34] recompense of
[47:36] reward for you have need of patience
[47:39] that after you have done the will of God
[47:42] you might receive the
[47:47] promise for yet a little while and he
[47:50] that shall come will come and will not t
[47:53] now the just shall live by faith but if
[47:56] any man draw draw back my soul shall
[47:57] have no pleasure in him but we are not
[48:00] of them who draw back oh my unto
[48:04] predition but of them that
[48:07] believe to the saving of the Soul thank
[48:11] the Lord you have need of patience
[48:14] that's the title of the message here
[48:16] tonight we pray God will bless you uh
[48:19] you may be seated I'm going to continue
[48:21] just a little bit what we talked about
[48:23] this morning on the open book of
[48:25] redemption I'm titling it that you have
[48:28] need of patience because patience is
[48:31] where the great breakdown happened in
[48:33] the garden remember Adam lost Adam who
[48:37] was our father lost the deed to all of
[48:42] creation he lost the authority that he
[48:45] had over the world over all of God's
[48:49] creation brother bam calls him the god
[48:52] of the earth he gave up his deity if you
[48:56] would
[48:57] to go and follow after his wife and he
[49:00] forfeited it now how did that happen
[49:03] what it took place and we went into that
[49:05] this morning and we understand that
[49:07] there was a law or a process for the
[49:10] return of this great book of redemption
[49:13] back into the hands of man Satan has
[49:17] partial control as a squatter on the
[49:20] earth he's in control of politics and
[49:22] all the world order and the world world
[49:25] system but the Earth is self still
[49:27] Belongs to the Lord and the meek shall
[49:29] inherit the earth actually it actually
[49:32] gets back comes back to us when he
[49:34] tempted Jesus he tried to get him to Bow
[49:37] Down and Worship and I'll give you all
[49:39] the kingdoms of the earth brother bam
[49:42] says Jesus knew that he would capture
[49:44] all that in the Millennium after he paid
[49:48] the price and so he had no he didn't
[49:50] want to he didn't sell out like Adam did
[49:54] but we understand also that Adam wasn't
[49:56] just a bum no who sold out Adam
[50:00] deliberately as a kinsman redeemer saved
[50:04] his wife by going in and God created a
[50:08] path of redemption and that's the great
[50:11] Redemption story which this Bible the
[50:14] book is the book of
[50:16] redemption brother um I was trying to
[50:19] find it this morning and brother Josh
[50:22] picked it up for me on that quote and
[50:25] here again I didn't bring again that you
[50:28] are sealed with the book of redemption
[50:31] amen amen and uh I probably should read
[50:36] it help me out Josh thank you just bring
[50:38] it up here yeah thank
[50:41] you all
[50:43] right I like people that hand me quotes
[50:46] that's right they're good people
[50:48] right paragraph 75 in the breach between
[50:52] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[50:54] Seals now notice now
[50:57] this book is sealed and you are sealed
[51:00] with the book until the day of
[51:06] redemption now if somebody took off
[51:08] Dancing I wouldn't have stopped you let
[51:10] let me let me read that one more time I
[51:12] think there's an amen down in you that
[51:15] wants to say Amen I'm going give you the
[51:16] opportunity to say Amen all right
[51:18] paragraph 75 in the message the breach
[51:21] between the seven Church ages and the
[51:23] Seven Seals now notice this book is
[51:27] sealed and you are sealed with the book
[51:31] until the day of
[51:33] redemption so ain't nobody being
[51:37] lost we are sealed until the day of our
[51:40] Redemption it's not a temporary fix but
[51:44] God before the foundation of the world
[51:47] had our life plotted out and laid out
[51:50] for us and we are just now coming into
[51:53] realization of Who We Are amen we are
[51:57] Sons and Daughters of God and God has
[52:00] given us this great heritage that uh
[52:04] that the original man had we're just
[52:06] coming out of our Amnesia we're kind of
[52:09] just waking up to really like wow I
[52:12] wasn't lucky when I got saved it wasn't
[52:15] luck it wasn't just like per chance
[52:17] somebody just happened like I like it
[52:20] was an almost I didn't make it but no it
[52:22] was
[52:23] deliberate the coworker that handed me
[52:25] the church yes sir Hallelujah yes sir
[52:29] God knew that I would be working there
[52:32] you know God gave me that job and on the
[52:35] job was a man that had this Revelation
[52:39] then he shared the book with me and then
[52:41] my life never been the same that's
[52:43] deliberate Saints that's not winning the
[52:46] lottery that's not you were lucky that
[52:49] wasn't you having a great day that was
[52:51] God for ordained it and now we're just
[52:56] now coming into realization of it so how
[52:59] and why did they lose this book now this
[53:03] was um Eve through
[53:08] her lack of patience to see the word
[53:12] develop in her life now if you really
[53:16] look at yourself if you're ever trying
[53:18] to accomplish anything let's try to ride
[53:20] a bike or hit a baseball or preach the
[53:23] gospel whatever it is and someone is
[53:26] trying to teach you or bring you
[53:28] along Isn't it nice when they're patient
[53:31] with
[53:32] you the teacher to the student the
[53:36] teacher is looking after he's not
[53:38] judging you every mistake that you made
[53:41] he he bringing you along he's watching
[53:44] you and anything he tells you as far as
[53:47] correction goes it's for your
[53:49] benefit he's watching you in parts that
[53:52] you can't see yourself you think you you
[53:55] you think you're standing up straight or
[53:56] you think you're doing it right but he's
[53:58] on the back watching your form and
[54:01] everything and he's taking notes to make
[54:03] you a better whatever you're trying to
[54:05] be and we all need patience when we're
[54:08] trying to do something can I get a
[54:10] witness we all need patience but we also
[54:13] need to give
[54:18] patience so you know you know somebody's
[54:21] going forward they're trying to do
[54:23] something that's right it could be a a
[54:25] young Church or a young Pastor or young
[54:28] Ministry a soloist singing their first
[54:31] song or whatever it may be then you know
[54:34] the older ones should have patience with
[54:37] that one to watch this this child or
[54:40] this young person develop yes if you
[54:43] squash them you can hurt them and you
[54:46] know the the scriptures require that we
[54:49] have this patience and the Lord and and
[54:54] in what Adam lost the reason they lost
[54:57] it is because Eve could not wait they
[55:01] knew they had this Authority they knew
[55:04] that they would come to spoken word
[55:06] children that this would take place that
[55:08] there was a great manifestation to come
[55:11] and the Temptation was for them to get
[55:14] ahead of God and so this this lack of
[55:19] patience we see it in the book of Exodus
[55:22] if we can turn there quickly Exodus
[55:24] chapter 24
[55:33] amen cuz we have the promises we see the
[55:36] word it's been made manifested before us
[55:39] we know it's true but then are we going
[55:42] to make anything happen are we going to
[55:45] manufacture something that's right are
[55:47] we going to make God do it now well we
[55:50] can't you have to wait on the Lord and
[55:53] be of good courage wait I say upon the
[55:55] Lord yes and you wait until he brings it
[56:00] to
[56:01] pass and sometimes you're waiting for
[56:03] quite some time look at Exodus chapter
[56:06] 24 and verse is number let's take number
[56:11] 1 through 8 just quickly and he said
[56:13] unto Moses come up unto the Lord thou
[56:16] Aaron NAD abaho and 70 of the Elders of
[56:21] Israel and worship you a far off and
[56:24] Moses alone shall come near the Lord but
[56:26] they shall not come nigh neither shall
[56:28] the people go up with him and Moses came
[56:31] and told the people all the words of the
[56:33] Lord all the judgments and all the
[56:37] people answered with one voice and said
[56:40] all the words which the Lord had said
[56:43] will we do Moses wrote all the words of
[56:45] the Lord rose up early in the morning
[56:48] and built an altar under the hill 12
[56:51] pillars according to the 12 tribes of
[56:53] Israel he sent a young man of the
[56:55] children of Israel which offered burnt
[56:58] offerings sacrificed peace offerings
[57:01] oxen of oxen unto the Lord and Moses
[57:04] took half of the blood put it in the
[57:07] Basin half of the blood sprinkled it on
[57:10] the altar he took the book of the
[57:12] Covenant and read in the audience of the
[57:15] people and they said all that the Lord
[57:18] had said will we do and be obedient and
[57:22] Moses took the blood and sprinkled on
[57:25] the people and said behold the blood of
[57:27] the Covenant which the Lord ha made with
[57:29] you concerning all these words so the
[57:31] Lord is calling Moses these three men
[57:34] apart along with the 70 apart and now
[57:40] he's going to now bring the Ten
[57:43] Commandments to Moses now part of the
[57:45] word was written in the the other books
[57:48] you'll see laws on how to treat the
[57:51] animals and different things like that
[57:53] and disciplinary laws and so forth your
[57:56] neighbor your brother these aren't the
[57:58] Ten Commandments he had already they
[57:59] already had those but here now this is
[58:02] written before them and they take this
[58:04] and they read it out to the people and
[58:06] all the people say we will do it now
[58:09] verse
[58:11] n then went up Moses and Aaron naan and
[58:14] abue and 70 of the Elders of Israel and
[58:17] they saw the god of Israel look at this
[58:20] verse 10 and they saw the god of
[58:24] Israel and they saw saw the god of
[58:28] Israel and there was under his feet as
[58:31] it were a pave work of sapphire stone
[58:35] and as it were the body of Heaven in his
[58:38] clearness and upon the Nobles of the
[58:40] children of Israel he laid not his hand
[58:43] meaning Lord the Lord didn't strike them
[58:46] also they saw God and did eat and drink
[58:51] and the Lord said unto Moses come up to
[58:53] me into the mount and be there and I
[58:56] will give thee tables of stone and a law
[59:00] and Commandments which I have written
[59:02] thou mayest that thou mayest teach them
[59:06] Moses rose up his Minister Joshua Moses
[59:09] went into the Mount of God and he said
[59:11] unto the elders T here for us until we
[59:14] come again unto you and behold Aaron and
[59:17] her are with you if any man have any
[59:20] matters to do let him come unto them and
[59:23] Moses went up into the mount and the
[59:24] cloud covered the mountain
[59:26] the glory of the Lord above upon the
[59:28] mountain SI and the cloud covered it how
[59:31] many days 6 days and the seventh day he
[59:35] called unto Moses out of the midst of
[59:37] the cloud and the sight of the glory of
[59:40] the Lord was like a devouring fire on
[59:44] the top of the mount in the eyes of the
[59:47] children of Israel and Moses went into
[59:50] the midst of the cloud and got him up
[59:52] into the mount and Moses was in the
[59:55] mount 40 days and 40
[59:58] nights so very powerful portion of
[1:00:02] scripture what's taking place here Moses
[1:00:04] is telling these faithful ones the 70
[1:00:08] plus these three men that were called by
[1:00:10] name to wait here until I return back
[1:00:15] here uh but before that they saw the
[1:00:19] Lord they saw his countenance how he
[1:00:23] stood the Lord didn't smite them he gave
[1:00:26] them a witness clearly that this was God
[1:00:30] speaking to Moses now this is this
[1:00:33] wasn't the whole congregation but these
[1:00:35] were the
[1:00:36] 70 these were the leaders these were men
[1:00:40] and they opened their eyes and they saw
[1:00:42] that there was the
[1:00:44] Lord and a and Moses says T here until I
[1:00:48] return and and look look here's Aaron
[1:00:51] here's her if anything comes up go to
[1:00:54] these brothers
[1:00:58] they'll be faithful until I get
[1:01:01] back allegedly
[1:01:04] allegedly they'll keep you in the right
[1:01:07] way
[1:01:10] allegedly they should
[1:01:13] have sir 30 40 days go by 40 days and 40
[1:01:22] nights you know you can find out your
[1:01:24] true friend in the week almost
[1:01:26] these days and people can't wait on you
[1:01:29] for
[1:01:31] nothing they they put you on the
[1:01:34] clock you make a mistake they got their
[1:01:36] Market against you you know give me some
[1:01:39] patience I need to give you some
[1:01:42] patience and while they saw the Lord and
[1:01:46] Moses goes up into the mount there
[1:01:48] here's this span of time where the
[1:01:50] Prophet isn't here anymore and here the
[1:01:52] people are here and there is no answer
[1:01:55] there is no personal conduct or contact
[1:01:57] with Moses so here's the Temptation here
[1:02:01] that Adam and Eve were fac with now
[1:02:04] brother bam tells us in the message
[1:02:07] wisdom versus Faith paragraph 229 he
[1:02:10] says this
[1:02:12] here Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:02:15] voice they can tell whether it's a goat
[1:02:18] he's a sheep himself uh-huh my sheep
[1:02:22] know my voice strangers they won't
[1:02:24] follow what is his voice here it is the
[1:02:27] word see my sheep know my voice drop
[1:02:32] down to paragraph 234 he said but oh you
[1:02:35] think that a good loving father would do
[1:02:37] a thing like that what she do she
[1:02:39] listened to reason took his wisdom it's
[1:02:43] a tree Delight one can be desired of and
[1:02:47] she fell for it that's exactly when she
[1:02:50] did what happened like it would to any
[1:02:52] woman as soon as you fall for it it
[1:02:55] finishes you you right there that's
[1:02:57] right now you see the seed that she was
[1:02:59] holding and would have finally become a
[1:03:02] mother by the will of God through a
[1:03:05] spoken word she would have finally
[1:03:07] become a mother but she couldn't wait
[1:03:11] went into that now you see then as soon
[1:03:15] as she did that accepted wisdom with the
[1:03:18] word and wisdom was contrary to the word
[1:03:21] you understand amen so we see that the
[1:03:24] issue with with with Eve was she
[1:03:28] couldn't wait now brother bam deals with
[1:03:30] this again and the spoken word is the
[1:03:32] Original
[1:03:35] Seed and he says this
[1:03:41] here paragraph 52 and part
[1:03:46] two and this book has the numbers off a
[1:03:48] little bit but I think you'll be able to
[1:03:51] find it it's in the spoken words of the
[1:03:54] Original Seed the part two portion he
[1:03:56] says the bride today is a byproduct see
[1:04:00] she calls herself the bride but what she
[1:04:02] is she made up of the material of
[1:04:05] organization not of the word so much so
[1:04:09] much word in it to make it kind of a
[1:04:12] byproduct to make it
[1:04:13] hypocritical Eve believed most of the
[1:04:17] word but she doubted one part of it
[1:04:21] today she can't even get Acts 20 Matthew
[1:04:24] 28:19 straight with acts 238 see it
[1:04:27] confuses her that's just one little
[1:04:30] place of the hundreds of others now the
[1:04:32] Bride of Adam was a type of the second
[1:04:35] Adam's bride and Adam's bride could not
[1:04:40] wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply
[1:04:44] and replenish the Earth it was an
[1:04:47] oncoming thing a promise she was not his
[1:04:51] wife as yet he had never lived with her
[1:04:54] the bride of Christ is not his wife yet
[1:04:56] the wedding supper is to take place get
[1:04:58] it she she got in a hurry and what did
[1:05:02] she do she crossed her seed she mingled
[1:05:05] it with the serpent seed and when she
[1:05:07] did she brought what did she bring she
[1:05:09] brought forth a child of
[1:05:12] death a child that she perverted every
[1:05:16] child after that and when the Church of
[1:05:18] Jesus Christ was perverted in the time
[1:05:20] of Rome after her virgin birth and was
[1:05:23] given to Christ at Pentecost what did
[1:05:25] she do she crossed herself with Roman
[1:05:28] Dogma the Protestant church has done the
[1:05:30] very same thing she can't wait a woman
[1:05:34] engaged to a fine young clean man before
[1:05:36] they come together what's she done she's
[1:05:39] found pregnant by some o someone else
[1:05:42] then her own seed which is betroth her
[1:05:45] own body which is betroth to her
[1:05:47] boyfriend her engaged husband is found
[1:05:50] full of the seed of another man what a
[1:05:53] disgrace that's exactly what Adam found
[1:05:57] that's what Christ has found couldn't
[1:06:00] wait that's what's the matter with the
[1:06:02] people today they can't wait for the
[1:06:04] real Holy Spirit to take the church in
[1:06:08] position they've got to manufacture
[1:06:11] something work something up initial
[1:06:14] evidence speaking in tongues to get more
[1:06:16] members in the church and all these kind
[1:06:19] Tommy Rod instead of waiting upon the
[1:06:22] Lord for the real manifestation of the
[1:06:25] resur ction of Christ making himself
[1:06:28] known among the people brothers and
[1:06:30] sisters if you notice all of the
[1:06:32] movements that happened that continue to
[1:06:34] happen in the message they have we
[1:06:36] turned a corner this is the Revelation
[1:06:38] now and this group has it it's all
[1:06:40] because they can't wait all right yes
[1:06:43] sir see see when the prophet was here
[1:06:46] you wouldn't be doing that amen if the
[1:06:49] prophet was here you wouldn't have a
[1:06:50] problem taking communion it wouldn't be
[1:06:53] an issue taking the Lord suffer
[1:06:56] but he's not here
[1:06:57] now and you know what's what's going on
[1:07:00] so we've turned a corner now we got to
[1:07:03] change we got another anointing we got
[1:07:06] we got to make this thing you know we
[1:07:08] got to make it more you know interesting
[1:07:11] for the
[1:07:12] Youth it's boring to stand up and read
[1:07:15] quotes boring to who all right all right
[1:07:20] right boring to who yes sir are we just
[1:07:23] going to listen to a t what do you mean
[1:07:25] just that's going to listen to a tape
[1:07:28] what tape are you listening to the
[1:07:30] prophet oh my that's
[1:07:32] fire we should be fired up for that amen
[1:07:37] Saints for sure and so it's all because
[1:07:42] they can't wait we can't wait for the
[1:07:44] real manifestation to come I didn't know
[1:07:48] brother brownon was coming I wasn't
[1:07:50] praying for him to come but he came and
[1:07:52] now I know he's here now I can see in
[1:07:55] the Bible he was supposed to be here so
[1:07:57] I don't need to jump out ahead of God
[1:07:59] and say what's going to happen next let
[1:08:02] it take place it will vindicate what it
[1:08:05] is this Vindicated what it
[1:08:09] was can I get a witness somebody yes sir
[1:08:13] wait on the Lord be of good courage and
[1:08:17] he shall strengthen your heart amen amen
[1:08:20] now this um this this waiting on the
[1:08:24] Lord this Eve she couldn't
[1:08:29] wait Aaron and NAD they couldn't wait
[1:08:32] turn to Exodus
[1:08:46] 32 so Exodus 24 we saw what happened
[1:08:49] Moses in the mountain he tells your
[1:08:52] brethren to wait on him then Exodus 25
[1:08:56] it goes a little bit deeper on what the
[1:08:58] and the experience the Lord is that
[1:09:00] Moses is having with the Lord 26 Along
[1:09:03] on in there then Exodus chapter 32 look
[1:09:07] at verse
[1:09:08] one look at this this is just 40 Days
[1:09:12] Later a little over a month later and
[1:09:15] when the people saw that Moses delayed
[1:09:17] to come down out of the mount the people
[1:09:20] gathered themselves together unto Aaron
[1:09:22] and said unto him up make us Gods which
[1:09:26] shall go before us for as for this Moses
[1:09:30] the man that brought us up out of the
[1:09:33] land of Egypt we W not what is become of
[1:09:37] him now who would make a statement like
[1:09:40] this first of all I can see somebody
[1:09:43] from the congregation making this
[1:09:45] statement but none of the 70 elders
[1:09:48] should have they should be solid they
[1:09:52] saw God the Bible said they saw God they
[1:09:57] saw how he stood there and God didn't
[1:10:00] spite him he came into their presence
[1:10:02] Vindicated that it was God and Moses
[1:10:05] told him wait here until I get back what
[1:10:09] you mean you don't know what happened to
[1:10:11] him he's on his way back that's what
[1:10:14] happened to him he's coming back yes sir
[1:10:18] he said he was coming back glory to God
[1:10:22] she talking about you don't know what
[1:10:23] happened to him what do you mean
[1:10:26] he said he was coming
[1:10:29] back where's the men at in this
[1:10:31] congregation all right this is Aaron his
[1:10:34] older brother right he's talking about a
[1:10:36] shame on you that's a shame on you Aaron
[1:10:40] this is your
[1:10:42] brother your baby brother that rose up
[1:10:44] in our midst and we know that God was
[1:10:46] with him yes sir 40 days later you let
[1:10:51] the congregation turn you away from this
[1:10:54] glor ious
[1:10:56] commandment
[1:10:58] H so this is the great Temptation that
[1:11:02] Eve was faced with she couldn't wait and
[1:11:06] then of course we know the Plan of
[1:11:07] Redemption
[1:11:09] now as I shared with you this morning
[1:11:12] and the other night the Bible is the
[1:11:15] book of
[1:11:16] redemption is that right it is The Book
[1:11:20] of
[1:11:21] Life it has the answers to life it has
[1:11:25] the answers to your life amen nothing in
[1:11:29] your life will make sense until you come
[1:11:31] in contact with the good book The Bible
[1:11:34] there's been an onslaught of critics
[1:11:37] against the word even message Believers
[1:11:40] try to downplay what the Bible say and
[1:11:43] try to make the Bible and the message
[1:11:45] two separate
[1:11:46] works if you're stranded on the island
[1:11:50] you know the crazy little
[1:11:51] scenario if you were stranded on the
[1:11:54] island first of all let's pray that we
[1:11:55] don't get stranded on no
[1:11:57] island so we don't have to come with
[1:11:59] this
[1:12:00] nonsense so we stranded on the island if
[1:12:03] you had to keep one book which book
[1:12:05] would you keep well the Bible is
[1:12:08] 66 one of the 66 which
[1:12:11] one you going to take the Bible or
[1:12:14] brother Brandon's
[1:12:15] message and that's an argument for
[1:12:18] whoever wants to have that argument to
[1:12:19] me they're one and the same work that's
[1:12:22] right the author sent this message like
[1:12:25] you said the
[1:12:26] Bible and this book the Bible is the
[1:12:29] book of redemption it's the book of life
[1:12:31] it answers the questions for all life
[1:12:34] including your life you know if it
[1:12:36] answers all the questions to life but it
[1:12:38] doesn't answer the question to your life
[1:12:41] then it's still really just a regular
[1:12:43] book but when it begins to answer the
[1:12:45] question to your life then it becomes a
[1:12:49] more intimate book it becomes a love
[1:12:52] letter from your heavenly father to
[1:12:56] you in the book it tells you why you're
[1:12:59] here it tells you your purpose and where
[1:13:02] you're
[1:13:03] going what other piece of literature can
[1:13:06] tell you about
[1:13:08] yourself what other piece of writing can
[1:13:10] tell you where you're
[1:13:11] going it's the good book The Bible and
[1:13:15] this Bible was meant to be
[1:13:19] read you open it up and you read it now
[1:13:24] through the script
[1:13:26] ures it was recorded for a
[1:13:29] purpose in J Exodus
[1:13:32] 17 Moses tells Joshua to write this for
[1:13:36] a memorial in the book Exodus 341 it
[1:13:40] says the Lord said unto Moses heue thee
[1:13:43] two tables of stone like unto the first
[1:13:45] write it upon these tables of words that
[1:13:47] I that were in the first tables Exodus
[1:13:50] 34:27 and the Lord said to Moses write
[1:13:53] these words for after the tenor of these
[1:13:56] words I have made a covenant with thee
[1:13:58] and with
[1:13:59] Israel and Deuteronomy
[1:14:02] 27 deals with it Jeremiah 36 1-4 you see
[1:14:08] the Lord telling these prophets to write
[1:14:10] it
[1:14:11] down write it in the book keep it for a
[1:14:15] memory rehearse it back to the ears of
[1:14:18] your children the reason why it's
[1:14:20] written down is so somebody else can
[1:14:22] read it again it keeps the book of Li
[1:14:25] because it's written down and it's meant
[1:14:27] to read again read it in 20 years read
[1:14:31] it in 100 years read it when you get it
[1:14:35] into your possession Ezekiel form
[1:14:38] thereof and all the
[1:14:42] ordinances Luke chap 1
[1:14:44] 1-4 I'm just rattling these
[1:14:47] off but Luke chapter 1 1-4 says for as
[1:14:51] much this is Luke The Physician for as
[1:14:54] much as many have taken in hand to set
[1:14:56] forth in order a declaration of those
[1:14:59] things which are most surely believed
[1:15:01] among us even as they delivered unto us
[1:15:05] which from the beginning were
[1:15:07] eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word
[1:15:10] okay it seemed good to me
[1:15:12] also having had perfect understanding of
[1:15:16] all things from the very first to write
[1:15:19] unto thee in order most excellent
[1:15:23] Theophilus that thou mayest know the
[1:15:26] certainty of those things wherein thou H
[1:15:29] has been instructed so here's
[1:15:32] Luke setting things in order by writing
[1:15:37] it down
[1:15:39] Amen in our day it's written down but
[1:15:42] even better than written down it's been
[1:15:44] recorded sir and the tape message the
[1:15:48] tape recordings were instructions from
[1:15:50] the angel to the prophet to store up the
[1:15:53] food on tape yeah why is it on the tape
[1:15:56] so that somebody can hear it again amen
[1:15:59] so it can be played again so it can be
[1:16:02] read again and when you read it again it
[1:16:05] comes alive to you the reader or the
[1:16:07] hearer amen and we see this through the
[1:16:13] scriptures and brother
[1:16:15] brandham has in a number of places about
[1:16:19] the visions that the lord gave him he
[1:16:20] would tell them to to write this down in
[1:16:24] the fly leaf of your Bible he said that
[1:16:26] about the 300,000 going to be saved in
[1:16:30] India he said that that was going to

[1:19:34] message thou knowest all things in
[1:19:39] 1952 he says this
[1:19:42] here now remember keep that on your mind
[1:19:45] write it on a piece of paper lay it in
[1:19:47] your Bible put it on the fly leaf
[1:19:50] somewhere you'll hear through the
[1:19:53] magazine brother random had a meeting
[1:19:55] somewhere in the orients or down in
[1:19:58] India I believe or Africa somewhere
[1:20:00] where
[1:20:01] 300,000 people attended the
[1:20:06] meeting he doubles down in questions and
[1:20:09] answers in
[1:20:10] 1954 and he says this here paragraph 140
[1:20:14] he says mark my word write it in your
[1:20:17] pages of your Bible for it's thus sayeth
[1:20:20] the Lord remember when we land in India
[1:20:23] you're going to hear of tens of
[1:20:24] thousands times thousands being saved
[1:20:28] the Holy Spirit has said it I've wrote
[1:20:30] it here in my Bible it's wrote in tens
[1:20:33] of thousands of Bibles right here like
[1:20:36] the resurrection of the little boy by
[1:20:37] the vision that he said there is 300,000
[1:20:40] of them in there and you see if that
[1:20:43] isn't right there is how the gospel is
[1:20:45] going to be preached just overnight
[1:20:49] she'll just sweep like that from place
[1:20:50] to place so here brother Bram is
[1:20:53] actually in my ising the people quite
[1:20:57] confidence a lot of confidence there for
[1:20:59] him to tell people to write these things
[1:21:01] down in the fly leaf of their Bible to
[1:21:04] remember them he's admonishing them to
[1:21:07] do that remember something Rises greater
[1:21:11] than this or besides this that I'm a
[1:21:14] false prophet that's thus sayth the Lord
[1:21:16] he didn't say that of himself now now
[1:21:19] how's there thing that are there things
[1:21:21] that have risen up in the past 10 years
[1:21:23] or 20 years or 30 years there's things
[1:21:27] rising up all the time we see it all the
[1:21:30] time and the Temptation would be like
[1:21:33] the Temptation that Eve had was to get
[1:21:36] ahead of the word and make something
[1:21:38] happen because we know it's a promise
[1:21:42] there's a third pool there's a seven
[1:21:44] Thunders there's a manifestation of the
[1:21:46] word there's the Holy Ghost and there's
[1:21:48] all these things that we want to jump
[1:21:50] out and get ahead of but you have need
[1:21:53] of patience
[1:21:55] after that the word has come to you amen
[1:21:58] so the purpose of the word of
[1:22:02] God coming to you is that you read that
[1:22:06] word and it keeps you stabilized in your
[1:22:10] life when Israel was brought out of
[1:22:13] Egypt Through The
[1:22:15] Exodus and one of the precepts that the
[1:22:17] lord gave Israel was that when you elect
[1:22:21] a king and you have a king in your midst
[1:22:24] one of the things that you'll need to do
[1:22:26] is to make sure that he keeps a copy of
[1:22:31] the word written with him at all
[1:22:33] times and this was in Deuteronomy
[1:22:36] chapter 17 and verse number 18 can I
[1:22:39] close on this last Point here
[1:22:41] Deuteronomy 18 just turn there real
[1:22:43] quickly Deuteronomy 17:
[1:22:46] 18 and it shall be now this is the
[1:22:49] instructions to a King now now
[1:22:51] Deuteronomy is giving all the laws on
[1:22:53] what to do and how to do and he's given
[1:22:56] this this instructions when you elect a
[1:23:00] king this is how he must continue on in
[1:23:04] his leadership in his
[1:23:07] rulership and and and and and it shall
[1:23:10] and it shall be when you when he sited
[1:23:13] upon the throne of his kingdom that he
[1:23:15] shall write him a copy of this law in a
[1:23:18] book out of that which is before the
[1:23:20] priests the
[1:23:22] Levites and it shall be with you him and
[1:23:25] he shall re therein how
[1:23:28] long all the days of his life why are we
[1:23:31] going to do that now that he may do What
[1:23:34] learn to fear the lord his God to keep
[1:23:39] all the words of this law and these
[1:23:42] statutes to what do them that his heart
[1:23:47] be not lifted up above his Brethren so
[1:23:50] it's going to deal with the pride issue
[1:23:52] that he turn out a save side from from
[1:23:54] the Commandment to the right hand or to
[1:23:56] the left to the end that he may prolong
[1:24:00] his days in his kingdom he and his
[1:24:03] children in the midst of Israel
[1:24:06] beautiful beautiful look at those Five
[1:24:09] Points there I think if it's good for a
[1:24:12] king in Israel I think it's good for a
[1:24:14] saint at Shalom
[1:24:17] Tabernacle these are five beautiful
[1:24:20] points of you getting a copy let me say
[1:24:24] like this what if you had to write out
[1:24:26] your own Bible
[1:24:28] yourself St in
[1:24:31] Genesis in the beginning God created
[1:24:34] what if you had to write out your own
[1:24:37] copy you think it would help you sir
[1:24:42] huh do you think it would help
[1:24:45] you then why don't we do
[1:24:49] it said brother Israel after you you do
[1:24:51] it and we'll do it but he he the the the
[1:24:55] the the the point of it is that the king
[1:24:57] needs to keep a copy of this book with
[1:25:00] him at all times all the days of his
[1:25:03] life what is it going to do for a king
[1:25:05] if he does this if he does this it will
[1:25:08] teach him how to fear the
[1:25:11] lord it'll teach him how to respect the
[1:25:14] Lord with The Godly reverence and
[1:25:16] respect number one number two it'll
[1:25:20] teach him how to keep and to do all the
[1:25:23] words you can't do something that you
[1:25:25] don't know what to do as you read the
[1:25:28] word it instructs you on what to do it
[1:25:33] will deal with his heart not being
[1:25:35] lifted up so this will keep you humble
[1:25:39] keep you respectful and in your place
[1:25:42] that your heart doesn't get lifted up in
[1:25:44] Pride not when you're staying with the
[1:25:46] word and it would also keep him from
[1:25:50] turning aside to the right or to the
[1:25:52] left it give him that balance in his
[1:25:56] life and that balance in his ministry
[1:26:00] and finally it will prolong the days of
[1:26:03] his life it will keep him stable for
[1:26:08] many many years God will grant the
[1:26:10] longevity to him and he will have that
[1:26:13] longlasting Ministry that everyone
[1:26:16] should have now that that was the rules
[1:26:19] for a
[1:26:21] king and those are the benefits of
[1:26:23] keeping in it with the King now we see
[1:26:27] in this last day that that the things
[1:26:31] that have risen
[1:26:36] up in this last
[1:26:40] day and the people that have fallen
[1:26:42] after them is because they
[1:26:45] have obviously not kept the word before
[1:26:49] them theyve they've they've left this
[1:26:52] word they let it Le from them amen it's
[1:26:55] the tendency of
[1:26:57] man can I take one more scripture I'm
[1:27:00] going to take one more set of scripture
[1:27:02] and I got one last quote and then I will
[1:27:05] close amen it who said
[1:27:08] that some two one two people all I need
[1:27:11] is two that's a witness three okay I got
[1:27:14] three
[1:27:14] Witnesses all y'all are outnumbered I
[1:27:17] gave you opportunity to speak we just
[1:27:21] voted he said preach it all right give
[1:27:24] me just a few more moments Exodus 32
[1:27:27] this is Moses Getting ready to
[1:27:30] leave Deuteronomy 31 sorry this is Moses
[1:27:34] Getting ready to leave and look at what
[1:27:35] he says in verses 22 through
[1:27:41] 30 this is very strong he's talking to
[1:27:44] Joshua he's getting ready to leave he's
[1:27:46] going to write a song he's gonna make
[1:27:48] them learn this song and look at what
[1:27:50] Moses
[1:27:51] says Moses therefore wrote this song the
[1:27:54] same day and taught it to the children
[1:27:56] of Israel Deuteronomy 31:23 and he gave
[1:27:59] Joshua the son of nun a charge and he
[1:28:02] said be strong and of good courage for
[1:28:05] Thou shalt bring the children of Israel
[1:28:07] into the land which I swear unto them
[1:28:09] and I will be with thee and it came to
[1:28:12] pass when Moses had made an end of
[1:28:14] writing the words of this law in a book
[1:28:17] until they were finished that Moses
[1:28:19] commanded the Levites which bear the Ark
[1:28:22] of the Covenant of the Lord saying take
[1:28:24] this book of the law and put it in the
[1:28:27] sight of the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:28:29] Lord your God that it may be therefore a
[1:28:32] witness against thee for I Know Thy
[1:28:36] rebellion and thy stiff neck behold
[1:28:39] while I'm yet alive with you this day
[1:28:42] you have been rebellious against the
[1:28:44] Lord how much more after my
[1:28:47] death gather unto me all the Elders of
[1:28:50] your tribes your officer that I may
[1:28:52] speak these words in their ears and I
[1:28:55] call Heaven and Earth to record against
[1:28:57] them to to record record against them
[1:29:00] for I know that after my death you will
[1:29:04] utterly corrupt yourselves and turn
[1:29:06] aside from the way which I have
[1:29:08] commanded you and evil will befall you
[1:29:12] in the latter days because you will do
[1:29:14] evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke
[1:29:16] him to anger through the work of your
[1:29:18] hands and Moses spake in the ears of all
[1:29:21] the congregation of Israel the work
[1:29:24] words of this song until they were ended
[1:29:27] so Moses is know knows he's leaving he
[1:29:30] sees what they did to him when he was
[1:29:32] gone for 40 days now he's leaving the
[1:29:35] Earth and he says I know that you're
[1:29:37] going to corrupt
[1:29:38] yourself I know that's what you're going
[1:29:40] to
[1:29:41] do there's no question about
[1:29:44] it and so we see
[1:29:47] this this corrupting we see it taking
[1:29:50] place even
[1:29:51] today even in our churches to today and
[1:29:54] our encouragement to you today is to um
[1:29:59] understand why they forfeited it it's
[1:30:01] because they it was a lack of patience
[1:30:04] but we are going to be those that wait
[1:30:06] upon the Lord but there is a secret that
[1:30:10] the the bride has the spoken word and
[1:30:14] she knows what to do with the
[1:30:17] word now we are not like the Eve that
[1:30:20] fell before us we are of a different
[1:30:23] category now because we've been called
[1:30:25] out and our instructions are to wait on
[1:30:28] the
[1:30:29] Lord and there's a prophecy in Souls
[1:30:32] that are in prison now
[1:30:35] 1963 yes and paragraph 364 the young
[1:30:40] sister can pull that up and download it
[1:30:43] I want to play that I'll read it and
[1:30:44] then I'll play it for you what this
[1:30:47] prophecy was at the end of this message
[1:30:49] Souls that are in prison now but in the
[1:30:54] spoken word is the Original
[1:30:56] Seed the prophet of God brings this
[1:30:59] secret to
[1:31:00] us that he said here's the secret that
[1:31:04] the word is in the
[1:31:07] bride and the mind of Christ to know
[1:31:09] what's he what he want done with the
[1:31:11] word and she does it in his name she has
[1:31:15] thus sayth the Lord then it's
[1:31:17] gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until
[1:31:20] it's grown and serves its purpose they
[1:31:23] do only his will I hope I'm talking to
[1:31:26] those that this quote is talking about I
[1:31:29] believe that no one can persuade them
[1:31:34] different they have thus sayeth the Lord
[1:31:36] or they keep
[1:31:38] still they don't make up
[1:31:41] quotes they don't make up things that we
[1:31:44] need to do now they're not making up a
[1:31:46] theory of what something may or may not
[1:31:49] mean they have thus sayeth the Lord or
[1:31:52] they keep still amen what's this what's
[1:31:54] thus sayith the Lord It's the word of
[1:31:56] God if you have the word of God on the
[1:31:59] subject then say it you have the freedom
[1:32:02] to say it you don't ask permission for
[1:32:05] that you say it and you say it with
[1:32:08] conviction you say it with all of your
[1:32:11] heart you say it for the rest of your
[1:32:13] life you say it when it makes friends
[1:32:16] you say it when it doesn't make friends
[1:32:19] you just stay with the word that's our
[1:32:22] that's our commandment
[1:32:24] that's our
[1:32:26] protection that's the reality of the
[1:32:28] believer's life is our protection is
[1:32:31] staying with the word it looks common it
[1:32:35] looks humble it looks uninteresting it
[1:32:38] looks like we heard it before but that
[1:32:40] is your protection stay with the word so
[1:32:44] the bride has this secret she knows what
[1:32:48] to do with the word or she keeps still

[1:39:37] gladly and my life has never been more
[1:39:41] blessed than when I'm reading God's word
[1:39:45] there's a blessing that comes with it
[1:39:47] you take the laws of the Bible and you
[1:39:50] read that word daily it'll keep you
[1:39:53] it'll answer all those questions about
[1:39:55] fearing the Lord knowing how to do them
[1:39:59] that your heart won't get lifted up in
[1:40:00] Pride that you won't turn to the left or
[1:40:03] to the right that he'll keep you in the
[1:40:06] longevity of your
[1:40:08] ministry those th those are just simple
[1:40:11] little tasks brother bam what should we
[1:40:13] do how how can we get closer to the Lord
[1:40:15] what he tell us 40-day
[1:40:19] fast what do he tell
[1:40:21] us read your Bible and pray when every
[1:40:26] day so simple but there's power in that
[1:40:30] don't let anybody downplay the power
[1:40:32] that's in this word it's beautiful it'll
[1:40:36] keep your ministry solid and sound it'll
[1:40:40] keep your family solid and sound you

[1:40:44] there's others but in this prophecy many
[1:40:47] will turn aside and that's what they
[1:40:49] have done but we gladly sincerely
[1:40:53] receive it humbly and we're blessed
[1:40:56] because of it great blessings will come
[1:40:59] upon thee how many are
[1:41:01] blessed why are you blessed God's word
[1:41:04] blesses you it's because of his goodness
[1:41:07] to us God bless you so much let us pray
[1:41:11] thank you
[1:41:12] Father for your goodness and mercy to us
[1:41:15] Lord we thank you for your word this
[1:41:18] evening we thank you Lord Jesus that
[1:41:20] you've given us these great truths of
[1:41:22] the revelation we see that even great
[1:41:26] men in the Old Testament walked away
[1:41:28] from
[1:41:29] Moses they reeled up a golden calf it's
[1:41:32] unbelievable Lord when I think about it
[1:41:35] but these were men that were even
[1:41:36] greater than than than me they were in
[1:41:40] the Commonwealth of Israel they were
[1:41:41] born in that elected Gene the elected
[1:41:44] sea the the elected nation of Hebrews
[1:41:48] Aaron and these great 70 elders they
[1:41:50] actually saw you how did did they turn
[1:41:53] aside I can't put that together
[1:41:57] Lord and I think that sometimes we get
[1:42:00] overconfident and we shouldn't Lord but
[1:42:02] if we keep the word before us it'll
[1:42:04] cause us that we won't get lifted up in
[1:42:07] Pride it'll keep us stable that we won't

[1:45:01] little testimony if I
[1:45:03] may
[1:45:05] uh I
[1:45:07] I I know that this is the
[1:45:10] greatest thing that we
[1:45:13] have uh reive in our hearts I I really
[1:45:17] believe
[1:45:19] this and uh there is a a a person who
[1:45:23] came to our church who was uh in a
[1:45:26] denomination for maybe 14 years and he
[1:45:31] was uh he was in uh leading a group of
[1:45:34] people and he came in our church and so
[1:45:38] he sat down and we started preaching the
[1:45:42] message and
[1:45:44] then uh he about a week ago I think it
[1:45:48] was he got baptized I baptize him in the
[1:45:51] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:53] and knowing that he was a leader a
[1:45:56] minister I told him to to preach for us
[1:45:59] you know some 30 minutes and so he came
[1:46:02] up FR and preached and he he he said
[1:46:06] this he said in my heart about a year
[1:46:11] ago I said there is
[1:46:15] something it's like I need to go back to
[1:46:18] the faith oh of my father
[1:46:21] amen and I preach a message on returning
[1:46:26] amen how the angel the the prophet of
[1:46:29] God was going to return us to the Faith
[1:46:32] of Our Fathers do you believe that so I
[1:46:36] preach about that and that man he was he
[1:46:39] said I found the answer
[1:46:42] am I found the answer for What the Lord
[1:46:45] Has spoke to my heart he said I never
[1:46:47] knew about this message and I told him I
[1:46:50] said how how can this be an equad door
[1:46:53] when brother galdona run the whole South
[1:46:58] America preaching this message you know
[1:47:01] I said I don't I don't understand and he
[1:47:04] said well the thing is that we are
[1:47:07] another
[1:47:08] generation and and it seems to me that
[1:47:12] the message we are we are taking to our
[1:47:15] families and our friends but there is
[1:47:17] another generation rising up on the side
[1:47:20] of us and they need to hear this truth
[1:47:24] amen so he was so happy he said oh I
[1:47:27] found the answer to what the Lord put in
[1:47:29] my heart he said we need to go back to
[1:47:33] the Faith of Our Fathers he said so so
[1:47:36] he's starting to read the book of Acts
