[2:31] 306 you may be
[2:36] seated see the loving longsuffering of
[2:41] God before he passed judgment upon on
[2:44] her he gave her a place to
[2:48] repent and it's in the name of the Lord
[2:51] I say
[2:52] this he's give the Protestant Church the
[2:56] same thing and she won't do it
[2:59] [Music]
[3:02] messages shuck
[3:05] everywhere and she won't do it she go to
[3:09] have her own dogmas and Creeds I don't
[3:11] care how much you explain it as I said
[3:14] there in Chicago they four more
[3:16] ministers and are people sitting
[3:18] here and there they had me pinned off
[3:21] about the doctorine of serpent seeding
[3:23] all this other thing I said somebody get
[3:25] your Bible and come here and stand by me
[3:27] then nobody said nothing Tommy Hicks
[3:31] said I never heard that like that before
[3:34] brother BR I want 300 of those tapes I
[3:36] would send them all my Ministry there's
[3:37] about 50 or 75 said I'm coming down
[3:40] there to be re-baptized did they come
[3:42] not a one of
[3:43] them why you give them space to
[3:46] repent you'll cast your children to
[3:50] death spiritual
[3:52] death we pick that up tomorrow night the
[3:55] Lord willing or Saturday night on those
[3:57] plags as passes over you watch what
[3:59] takes place there like could give Egypt
[4:01] he give Egypt place to
[4:03] repent what was that last flag was death
[4:08] that's the last plag that's hit the
[4:09] Pentecostal church is spiritual death
[4:12] she's
[4:14] dead that's in the name of the Lord
[4:20] she Place rep she
[4:24] rejected now she's dead she'll never
[4:27] rise again
[4:30] and then people out there trying to
[4:31] bring in episcopalians and Priests and
[4:34] so forth and call them holy fathers so
[4:36] and so why they ought to be ashamed of
[4:38] themselves how blind can man get so
[4:42] Jesus say when that sleeping virgin come
[4:45] to BU or she did not get
[4:48] [Music]
[4:50] it everybody you people say I got the
[4:52] Holy Ghost I spoke in h but they don't
[4:54] want to come around a church like this
[4:56] oh you know I don't believe I want to go
[4:57] around place like that and then say you
[4:59] got the Holy
[5:03] Ghost but you want your dignified ways
[5:06] you want to stay in bab and still enjoy
[5:09] the blessings of Heaven you have to make
[5:11] your
[5:13] choice you can't stay out there in the
[5:15] world and serve God at the same time
[5:17] Jesus said you couldn't serve God in
[5:20] mm Hallelujah so if you won't expect if
[5:23] you really get save you enjoy meetings
[5:25] where the holy spirit is vindicating
[5:27] itself and showing that the word of
[5:33] [Music]
[5:34] is someone said the people make too much
[5:37] noise it makes me nervous you'll be
[5:39] nervous if you get to heaven just think
[5:41] all of them are there then what about
[5:46] it oh my how the Lord wants to get the a
[5:50] long suffering like it was in the days
[5:52] of Noah he tried hard he suffered long
[5:55] for 120 years to get him to repent they
[5:57] wouldn't do it in the days of E Egypt he
[6:00] sent plagues and everything else they
[6:01] wouldn't do
[6:02] it he sent John they wouldn't return He
[6:06] sent Jesus to Die to Save the whole
[6:09] group that would hear the word and now
[6:12] in the last days he promised again that
[6:15] he would send a message to call her out
[6:18] and restore the original Faith back to
[6:20] it back to the word and they won't
[6:22] receive it they're so dogmatic in their
[6:24] dogmas and Creeds tell they don't oh
[6:27] they think it had a if a angel walk down
[6:29] but God don't do that he takes something
[6:32] ignorant and stupid something that don't
[6:34] know harder your ABCs or anything and
[6:37] then he takes that type of a person
[6:39] because he can take something it's
[6:41] nothing and then work through it as long
[6:43] as something thinks or something then
[6:44] they can do nothing with
[6:46] it always did that you had become
[6:49] nothing to become somebody with
[6:52] God oh my notice yeah he gave her space
[6:57] to repent but she didn't do it he's done
[6:59] it again she won't do it her rejection a
[7:03] away makes her or her rejection makes
[7:07] the perfect way for Satan to come into
[7:10] her and be
[7:12] incarnate that's right incarnate himself
[7:16] right in her because she rejected the
[7:18] word and that's exactly the same thing
[7:21] that the Protestant church becomes a
[7:23] harlot is because she rejects the
[7:26] Vindicated truth of the word of God and
[7:28] that gives a devil face to come right in
[7:30] and incarnate himself and he'll make an
[7:32] image unto the beast when they consolida
[7:34] together right under
[7:38] now
[7:40] amen if I had an education I could bring
[7:42] it out I haven't got no education I Mis
[7:45] expecting the Holy Spirit to reveal it
[7:46] to he will to those who that's right
[7:50] he'll do
[7:51] it notice
[7:54] look H what she did here she rejected
[7:57] God's message for her to repent she
[8:00] started off an antichrist and that's
[8:02] what she was she come a false prophet an
[8:05] incarnate devil and what she did with
[8:07] her false teaching then in all of that
[8:10] God gave her space to repent try to get
[8:13] her see how longsuffering what a
[8:15] wonderful love there's no love like that
[8:17] look at those even spit in his face and
[8:19] things he forgave him that's
[8:23] God don't reject God's message look she
[8:26] was asked you repent go back to where
[8:29] she fell from and where did she fall
[8:32] from the
[8:34] word where did E fall
[8:37] from where did the denomination fall
[8:40] from word there you
[8:43] are no other way to right back to the
[8:46] word right back to the word and they get
[8:49] into a system that runs them back
[8:51] waiting the word runs them from the word
[8:53] instead of to the word notice look she
[8:56] was given the space to repent go back
[8:59] repent me need to go back turn back bout
[9:01] face repent go back and she was given a
[9:04] space to go back to where that now
[9:06] remember she was the original
[9:09] Pentecostal church that the Holy Ghost
[9:11] is poured up on on the day of
[9:12] Pentecost amen how many Bible students
[9:15] knows
[9:17] that see where she went from she fell
[9:19] from the word and accepted Dogma she
[9:23] instead of the Holy Ghost she want a
[9:24] holy
[9:25] name Dr LL pH Q that made him a
[9:31] PO sure but that's what she wanted
[9:34] somebody to do her praying somebody she
[9:36] just pay her money out and that's all
[9:38] she had to do now said that same thing
[9:41] as long as they got a Pew to set in play
[9:43] heavy on the collection plate that's
[9:44] good enough they're a member of that
[9:45] church you don't tell nothing else about
[9:46] it they don't that's her daughter now
[9:50] where did she fall from from the
[9:52] original word of the apostolic Apostles
[9:55] and Prophets that's where she fell from
[9:58] that's where the Protestant fell from
[10:00] repent go
[10:03] back turn back or it's too late it ain't
[10:08] already too late one of these days that
[10:10] lamb will lead his place and then it's
[10:12] all over so as her daughter's been ask
[10:16] now before being judged with her to
[10:20] return
[10:22] back now the last message they get is
[10:25] when this Prophet that I've been
[10:27] speaking of which I've been reading
[10:29] readen many books about it and I know
[10:31] that real good sensible spiritual
[10:34] thinking man knows that that's
[10:38] coming but the trouble of it is it keeps
[10:40] saying we need it it's going to be and
[10:42] when it comes they'll be so humble they
[10:45] probably miss it just like did the other
[10:48] time people are right about it
[10:50] everything say oh yes it needs to be and
[10:52] then let it be showed right before them
[10:53] and they just go right on so always done
[10:56] that watch now the original
[11:00] they they has to repent to go back there
[11:02] so her daughters is being asked to be
[11:05] forc they will be judged and thr into
[11:07] the same bed and kill with her they've
[11:10] been asked to turn back to the original
[11:13] word go back to the apostolic Doctrine
[11:16] but they're so tied down with their
[11:18] Creeds and things they want do it they
[11:21] only make fun of it then what do they do
[11:24] they finally form up in the image unto
[11:26] the Beast another power no
[11:31] and act to the Lamb's bride like she did
[11:34] in Revelations
[11:35] 13:14 that's what they do just persecute
[11:38] just the same thing the churches make
[11:40] just as fun of the true bride of Christ
[11:42] as Rome ever did just
[11:45] today act to the the real Lamb's bride
[11:48] just as like like she did in Revelations
[11:50] 13:14 now notice we see by God's Word of
[11:55] Promise he will uh he will uh
[12:00] killer children the
[12:02] denominations her daughters with
[12:05] spiritual death now that's Revelations
[12:07] 2:22 don't forget to kill is to putt to
[12:11] death and death is eternal separation
[12:13] from the presence of
[12:15] God think of that friends think of that
[12:18] won't you trust in any man-made
[12:20] Creeds anything is contrary to what you
[12:23] keep away from
[12:24] it now watch watch in the Bible here it
[12:28] said his name is hell and I mean his
[12:30] name is death and Hell follow that tree
[12:33] now hell always follows death in the
[12:37] natural when the natural man dies hell
[12:40] follows him that's the grave Hades see
[12:42] that in the natural but in the spiritual
[12:44] it's a lake of fire see all right
[12:47] Eternal separation where they're burn up
[12:49] and Malachi for that don't even lead in
[12:51] stubble or Branch or nothing else it's a
[12:53] way the world has a purifying itself
[12:54] again for the Millennium see have you
[12:57] noticed the Rider is a
[13:01] he and he had in his
[13:04] hand man false prophet but his bride is
[13:08] called the church she
[13:10] Jezebel Ahab
[13:12] Jezebel watch this as perfect as
[13:15] anything
[13:17] daughters is she
[13:20] also but never receive one man headship
[13:24] Protestants to that but still Harlot and
[13:27] principle of the doctrine that's right
[13:30] denomination systems that's that's what
[13:34] it
[13:34] says notice what is this all coming to
[13:40] now we just got about 12 14 minutes here
[13:42] I guess look what this is all coming to
[13:45] what is it it's going right back the way
[13:49] it did and started in heaven is coming
[13:51] to the End Time
[13:54] battle the first thing in heaven was a
[13:56] battle Lucifer's kicked out come to the
[13:58] Earth then he polluted Eden then he's
[14:01] been polluting ever since and now from
[14:03] the battle in heaven it's coming to the
[14:06] battle on Earth and it is to be finished
[14:09] at on Earth at the end time in a battle
[14:12] called Army
[14:15] geddon anyone knows that the battle
[14:18] started in heaven holy so they kicked
[14:21] them
[14:22] out Michael and his angels overthrow
[14:24] them run out when they did drop right
[14:27] down to Eden here start the battle down
[14:28] here
[14:30] God had his children all fortified up by
[14:32] his word and Eve stuck her neck out I
[14:34] believe you're right maybe and there it
[14:36] went and it's been ever since yeah then
[14:39] God come down and now he's got to he
[14:41] come down to redeem those who have come
[14:43] down as I said God's like a big
[14:45] contractor he lays out all his material
[14:47] on the earth and then he builds his
[14:49] buildings now remember before there was
[14:52] a grain of of seed on the earth before
[14:55] there was a sun that ever struck the
[14:58] Earth your your body was laying on the
[15:00] earth because you are the dust of the
[15:03] earth you are God's the contractor now
[15:07] the way he was going to do it was reach
[15:08] down and get like he did Adam a little
[15:10] bunch of calcium poish and Cosmic
[15:12] lightting say there's my other son then
[15:15] he bring up some War there's another one
[15:18] but what did Eve do she corrupted that
[15:20] way and she brought it so a sexual a
[15:24] then death Struck
[15:26] it now what's God doing he's got so many
[15:29] of those seeds down through there that's
[15:31] predestinated so much of predestinated
[15:34] and then at the end time he won't say
[15:36] Eve come bear another child you call and
[15:38] I'll
[15:39] [Music]
[15:41] answer that's the that last one's
[15:44] brought in that settles it now the
[15:47] battle started at Heaven it'll be
[15:49] finished on Earth in the form of army
[15:52] geddon now let's watch and see it unfold
[15:57] and maybe we can unfold it the Lord help
[15:58] us right not to do this now watch it
[16:01] unfold the mysterious
[16:05] Rider watch what he does
[16:07] now opposed refus to
[16:11] repent and to go back to the original
[16:15] blood
[16:15] word the word became blood and flesh he
[16:20] refused to go back to
[16:23] it is
[16:26] Antichrist the true word
[16:30] Bride is a he's opposed to the true
[16:33] worded
[16:34] bride takes his own bride he opposes
[16:38] this true bride to and he takes his own
[16:41] bride and brings her to him in a form of
[16:44] religion called Creeds and
[16:47] dogmas see and now seeing the holy bride
[16:53] he is against her but he forms his own
[16:56] bride
[16:59] called Antichrist by Antichrist teaching
[17:02] which is contrary to Christ see how sh
[17:05] is and now instead of having a unity of
[17:08] love controlling worship under blood
[17:11] he's got a
[17:14] denomination instead of having the word
[17:17] he took Creeds dogmas and so
[17:21] forth like in a Protestant says the
[17:23] Apostles
[17:25] Creed amen I want you to find a word of
[17:27] it in the Bible
[17:29] aost no Apostles Creed in the Bible if I
[17:32] said here not Longo or somewhere if the
[17:34] apostles had a Creed it's acts
[17:36] 238 all I know he ever had that's what
[17:38] they called everybody to do when he
[17:40] found what it looked like they were
[17:42] Christian he said have you received the
[17:43] Holy Ghost and that you believe said we
[17:44] know how word be said then how was your
[17:47] badti
[17:51] amen now being baptized in the Jesus
[17:54] name in the name of our Lord Jesus
[17:57] Christ brother that that's all right but
[17:59] that's not all of it
[18:01] yet no sir you can be baptized 50 times
[18:05] like that and don't do a bit of good
[18:06] until that heart's Changed by the Holy
[18:09] Spirit it all has to go
[18:12] together
[18:14] notice it's it's Christ the Antichrist
[18:19] refuses the true
[18:21] bride doctr and therefore he takes his
[18:24] own bride now and builds her up under a
[18:28] Creed of his
[18:31] own takes his own bride and makes her a
[18:35] denomination she gives birth to other
[18:39] denominations as quoted in this Holy
[18:42] Scripture gives birth to
[18:45] daughters and
[18:49] um she don't she becomes just like her
[18:52] mother natural worldly
[18:56] denomination opposing the spiritual
[18:59] bride the
[19:00] word they don't say they don't belong to
[19:03] church you talk to the denominational
[19:05] person sure I belong to church are you a
[19:07] Christian I belong to church that don't
[19:09] have one thing to do with
[19:11] it you don't belong to you you might
[19:13] belong to what's called a church okay
[19:16] belong to a church that's not a church
[19:18] that's not churches and lodges amen
[19:21] where people get together and people
[19:22] like birds of a feather but you're only
[19:24] one church that's and that's the
[19:26] mythical Body of Christ amen
[19:29] and you don't jarn that you're borned in
[19:30] it I've always said I've been to Brandon
[19:33] family 53 years and never did jar it I
[19:36] bned in it now
[19:38] notice it's just tight beautiful I I got
[19:41] the scripture WR down here but we ain't
[19:43] got time to get to it as Esau and Jacob
[19:46] now Esau was a religious
[19:48] man he didn't claim to be an unbeliever
[19:51] he believed in the same God Jacob did
[19:55] Same God his daddy did but he was just a
[19:57] Shiner excuse me expression just he was
[19:59] just no good he he was as far as being
[20:03] morally he was really a better moral
[20:06] acting man and Jacob was but you see he
[20:09] didn't think oh what's that Birthright
[20:11] got to do with
[20:12] it and he sold his Birthright to Jacob
[20:16] see but Jacob he didn't have big things
[20:20] like Esau did he didn't have the
[20:22] inheritance he did but there's one thing
[20:24] Jacob wanted was that birth right he
[20:26] didn't care how he had to get it he's
[20:28] going to get it
[20:29] and God had respect to him and then
[20:33] that's the same thing today with the
[20:34] natural man carnal mind worldly minded
[20:37] well I belong to the state church I
[20:38] belong to this church I belong to that
[20:40] that don't have one thing to do with it
[20:43] not a thing
[20:45] watch gathers them now on his mixed
[20:50] colored horse he's Gathering Together on
[20:52] his mixed colored horse because he's got
[20:54] political power you don't believe he has
[20:56] how did this President get in this now
[20:59] how did that ever slip
[21:02] up come over here for freedom of
[21:04] religion and you bunch of
[21:06] Democrats that would sell your
[21:08] birthrights out to politics I ain't got
[21:10] Democrat parties are they're both rotten
[21:13] I'm talking about Christianity but you
[21:15] sell your birth rights on a Democrat
[21:16] ticket and put something like that
[21:19] in same
[21:22] amen
[21:24] hallelujah don't you realize that this
[21:26] nation exactly is in a of Israel what
[21:30] did Israel do she come over to a Strange
[21:32] Land and Tuck the occupants out and
[21:34] killed them off and went in and
[21:36] possessed the land that's what we did
[21:37] the Indians that's the only true
[21:39] American there is is our Indian friends
[21:42] and then what did they do Israel had a
[21:44] few great man first thing you know they
[21:47] had David and they had Solomon they had
[21:50] great man and finally they got a
[21:52] renegade up there Ahab that married a
[21:57] jezebel an unb
[21:59] believer well that's the same thing we
[22:00] did we had a Washington and a Lincoln
[22:02] but look what we got
[22:04] now and the very thing of it is he's
[22:08] married and SS down and died in the wool
[22:12] to

[1:04:10] the
[1:04:11] scripture and we kind of went through
[1:04:14] that a little bit
[1:04:16] more and thought of what is the greatest
[1:04:19] thing that a Christian can do an
[1:04:20] individual can do in his life is to be
[1:04:23] able to repent
[1:04:25] because the day of repentance and that
[1:04:28] hour to repent that door will close when
[1:04:32] those that will that have spurned that
[1:04:36] they will seek for that repentance and
[1:04:38] they won't be able to find it we know
[1:04:40] that that time is coming that there's a
[1:04:43] place where a man can go too far wait
[1:04:46] too long and his day of visitation he
[1:04:49] completely misses it but we're so glad
[1:04:52] that there's still Blood on the throne
[1:04:54] this morning that any wrong that you
[1:04:57] have done that I have done we can make
[1:04:59] it right today and God can receive us
[1:05:03] back into his fold of forgiveness and
[1:05:06] his loving arms and we can continue on
[1:05:08] with our Christian Journey amen and
[1:05:11] that's what we want to do in Revelations
[1:05:13] chapter 5 and verse
[1:05:18] number five and one of the elders saith
[1:05:22] unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the
[1:05:25] tribe of Judah the root of David had
[1:05:28] prevailed to open the book and to loose
[1:05:31] the Seven Seals thereof and I behold and
[1:05:35] lo in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:05:38] four beasts and in the midst of the
[1:05:40] elders stood a lamb as it had been slain
[1:05:44] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:05:46] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:05:49] into all the Earth and he came and took
[1:05:53] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:05:55] that sat upon the throne and when he had
[1:05:59] taken the book The Four Beast the four
[1:06:02] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:06:06] having every one of them Harps golden
[1:06:09] vows full of odors which are the prayers
[1:06:12] of the Saints and they sung a new song
[1:06:15] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:06:19] to open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:06:23] slain and H has redeemed us to God by
[1:06:27] thy blood out of every Kindred and
[1:06:30] tongue and people and nation and has
[1:06:34] made us unto our God Kings and Priests
[1:06:39] and we shall reign on the earth let us
[1:06:43] pray Lord we ask your blessings on your
[1:06:45] word we ask in Jesus name amen God bless
[1:06:49] you you may be seated title of the
[1:06:51] message this morning is instructions
[1:06:55] from the
[1:06:57] angel the instructions from the angel
[1:07:01] we'll see this great scene in
[1:07:03] Revelations chapter 5 as we just back up
[1:07:06] just a little bit and see what this
[1:07:09] great scene was here the Elder John one
[1:07:12] of the 12 disciples of our Lord he sees
[1:07:17] this great event take place there's a
[1:07:20] book and there's no one worthy to take
[1:07:23] this book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:07:28] and the Bible says that he wept much he
[1:07:30] began to weep because no one was found
[1:07:33] worthy to take the book and then uh a
[1:07:37] voice from one of the Angels says weep
[1:07:40] not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:07:44] Judah hath prevailed and he'll take the
[1:07:47] book and he'll open it when John went to
[1:07:51] look and see what this La lion was the
[1:07:55] script says that there stood a lamb in
[1:07:58] the midst of the throne as though it had
[1:08:01] been slain so we see that this lamb and
[1:08:05] this event takes place after Calvary we
[1:08:09] see that Calvary had taken place this
[1:08:14] lamb was slain our Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:08:16] just went through Easter and now he's
[1:08:20] the only one that was worthy to take the
[1:08:22] book now we have this emblem of
[1:08:26] suffering and shame we call it the cross
[1:08:29] it's a sign of
[1:08:30] Christianity um the Catholics use it
[1:08:33] Christians use it but really the prophet
[1:08:36] Moses and Abraham didn't establish that
[1:08:39] as one of the emblems we should have in
[1:08:42] our assemblies none of the Apostles told
[1:08:44] us to put it in our churches it was a
[1:08:47] political indictment of for
[1:08:50] criminals but we use that because it is
[1:08:53] where our Lord PID the the ultimate
[1:08:57] price the Romans were in charge and he
[1:09:00] was indicted under their Rule and under
[1:09:03] their law because the Jews failed to see
[1:09:06] their day and when they didn't see their
[1:09:09] day and their coming prophecy to take
[1:09:11] place they indicted him and they nailed
[1:09:14] him to the Cross now it would have been
[1:09:16] very simple just to cut his head off or
[1:09:20] you know Pierce him in the heart and get
[1:09:23] the death over it that's not what this
[1:09:25] was for this is not for a quick sudden
[1:09:28] death This is for a painful death This
[1:09:32] is for not only a painful death it's for
[1:09:36] uh public death so that the public can
[1:09:39] come and watch you die slowly you would
[1:09:44] um uh begin to lose oxygen and they
[1:09:47] stripped you of all of your clothes and
[1:09:50] men and women and this is was a this was
[1:09:52] a public humiliation it wasn't just
[1:09:55] death sentence let's be clear of that
[1:09:58] this is was your enemies your friends
[1:10:00] your family whoever can come and watch
[1:10:03] you die slowly this is the death that
[1:10:06] our Lord he wasn't the only one that
[1:10:08] died on the cross but he's the only one
[1:10:10] that died on the cross and was buried
[1:10:13] but got back up again in fact he's the
[1:10:16] only founder of any religion that did
[1:10:19] that and that that's that's why we love
[1:10:22] him so that's why here in Revelations
[1:10:24] chapter 5 we see he's a bloody lamb
[1:10:27] meaning that that blood came from his
[1:10:31] wounds at Calvary so now John's weeping
[1:10:36] now turns into worship the elders the
[1:10:41] beasts and all those around the throne
[1:10:44] begin to sing a new song Thou Art
[1:10:49] Worthy and oh my I I think I could sing
[1:10:54] a little bit of that here this
[1:10:56] morning you had your opportunity to sing
[1:10:59] that this morning in the worship service
[1:11:01] sometimes we come to the worship service
[1:11:03] and we're still looking around trying to
[1:11:05] find out if the song leader gonna get it
[1:11:09] together or if the musicians can get on
[1:11:11] time or they didn't sing my favorite
[1:11:13] song you missed the whole purpose the
[1:11:15] whole purpose of the worship service was
[1:11:18] for the
[1:11:19] worshippers to
[1:11:21] worship the lamb that was slain you
[1:11:25] don't come to church to be seen we've
[1:11:27] made it that you don't come to church to
[1:11:29] be entertained we've made it that but we
[1:11:32] came here to meet with the king of kings
[1:11:36] and Lord of lords don't matter who's not
[1:11:39] here don't matter who else is here but
[1:11:41] I'm here to Worship the Lord Jesus
[1:11:44] Christ this is our Focus this is our
[1:11:48] purpose this is why I got up this
[1:11:50] morning this is why I got dressed to
[1:11:53] come to the house of the Lord and to
[1:11:57] worship he alone that was worthy of all
[1:12:01] of our praise some great men that come
[1:12:04] in our day great prophets Mighty Men
[1:12:07] Moses job Daniel all of the Hebrews and
[1:12:12] the prophets of oath wonderful men men I
[1:12:15] love to see on the other side but
[1:12:17] there's only one that was worthy of our
[1:12:19] worship only one that's worthy for us to
[1:12:23] bow down on our knees
[1:12:26] and give praise to and that was the lamb
[1:12:28] the Lord Jesus Christ and so we don't
[1:12:32] come just to hear a sermon we actually
[1:12:34] come to worship brother random tells us
[1:12:36] so we see this great event take place
[1:12:38] here and we played a portion for you
[1:12:42] last Sunday night out of the breach
[1:12:45] message that um where this great opening
[1:12:50] this great happening is taking place and
[1:12:54] brother randam uses the term oh what a
[1:12:57] jubilee and it's in paragraph 296 in the
[1:13:01] message to breach I'll read for you just
[1:13:03] for a
[1:13:12] moment how many remember that Sunday
[1:13:21] night he says listen what a jubilee
[1:13:24] going on
[1:13:25] when they seen that lamb come and take
[1:13:28] that book of redemption the soul
[1:13:30] screamed out we'll get it all everything
[1:13:34] the elders fell down they poured out the
[1:13:37] prayers of the Saints what there was
[1:13:40] represented a Kinsman for us they fell
[1:13:43] upon their faces they sang a song and
[1:13:46] said Thou Art Worthy for you were slain
[1:13:50] watch look at these angels and he reads
[1:13:53] the scripture there paragraph 297 what a
[1:13:57] jubilee going on in heaven when the lamb
[1:14:00] leads leaves that intercessory box to
[1:14:03] come here to possess his claims you know
[1:14:07] that got next to John he must have saw
[1:14:10] his name wrote there when them seals
[1:14:13] broke he must have got real happy listen
[1:14:17] to what he said so I want to I want our
[1:14:21] minds to go back to what a jubilee is
[1:14:25] and why we use that term Jubilee read it
[1:14:28] for you in the scripture in Exodus and
[1:14:30] Deuteronomy that the Jubilee was the
[1:14:33] time where the slaves could go free
[1:14:37] after being in bondage for seven years
[1:14:39] these are Hebrews to Hebrew
[1:14:42] relationships these are the Hebrews that
[1:14:45] were released out of
[1:14:47] Egypt they they had a they had a past so
[1:14:51] their mind battles and their memories
[1:14:53] and their scars are real these are
[1:14:56] people who were slaves for
[1:14:59] Generations uh Joshua is one of these
[1:15:03] very beautiful characters of a leader we
[1:15:07] see him in the Book of Joshua how he led
[1:15:11] and God was with him and all those that
[1:15:13] were with him the people stayed with the
[1:15:16] word with Joshua and I would think that
[1:15:19] Joshua be an easy leader to follow
[1:15:23] because Joshua had a testim
[1:15:25] where he was in slavery he came through
[1:15:29] the Exodus and he saw all of the
[1:15:31] foolishness with his cousins and
[1:15:33] brothers going back on the word rising
[1:15:36] up against and he got through all of
[1:15:39] that at kades barnea when folks lost
[1:15:41] their mind forgot why we even left Egypt
[1:15:45] and they want to go back to Egypt are
[1:15:47] you kidding me you must have never been
[1:15:49] there before this is Joshua's
[1:15:51] perspective and now here he is he was in
[1:15:55] Egypt come through the Exodus and he
[1:15:58] crosses over what a tremendous life what
[1:16:01] a TR tremendous man this was and so this
[1:16:05] these people the Hebrews God establishes
[1:16:08] these laws with
[1:16:10] them and he introduces to them this
[1:16:14] Jubilee the laws of the Jubilee we've
[1:16:17] been through it many times here and I'll
[1:16:19] keep going through it it's the word of
[1:16:21] God it's the reality of hearing the
[1:16:25] truth of the Gospel trumpet that slave
[1:16:28] when he hears that truth he recognizes
[1:16:31] that he can go free if he decides he
[1:16:34] wants to stay they would bore him in his
[1:16:37] ear we went went through it and he would
[1:16:39] have to be a slave um for the rest of
[1:16:42] his days no matter how many more
[1:16:44] jubilees would come this was a
[1:16:47] lifechanging event this was a life
[1:16:50] altering time in this life this wasn't
[1:16:53] just like a regular week day trumpet
[1:16:56] sounding this was if I hear this sound I
[1:16:59] can go free now I want you to to just
[1:17:02] take your mind back a little bit the
[1:17:04] other nations
[1:17:05] around probably could hear the Jews
[1:17:09] blowing these trumpets and doing all the
[1:17:11] stuff that they do and to the other
[1:17:13] nations out there it don't mean nothing
[1:17:15] but to those who are taught and who are
[1:17:17] the Commonwealth of Israel it meant a
[1:17:20] whole lot if your father was in bondage
[1:17:23] it meant Dad gets to come home if your
[1:17:27] parents were gone it meant that you get
[1:17:29] to see your parents again if you lost
[1:17:32] your property lost your you're gonna say
[1:17:35] Amen in a minute lost everything that
[1:17:38] you owned in the Jubilee you now can
[1:17:42] receive it back
[1:17:44] again and this is what the gospel does
[1:17:47] to a man or a woman that hears the truth
[1:17:51] of the gospel and I want to connect this
[1:17:54] gospel hearing of the word to us hearing
[1:17:59] these seals break
[1:18:01] open now I read this the quote for you
[1:18:04] in paragraph 200 in the breach where
[1:18:07] brother random says if we can get our
[1:18:09] minds and our sins far away enough to
[1:18:13] where the lamb would leave from glory to
[1:18:17] meet you as you repent of your sins
[1:18:20] he'll do that even this morning and even
[1:18:23] though you might not be able to
[1:18:25] articulate that this is Revelations
[1:18:27] chapter 5 taking place in your life you
[1:18:30] can articulate that Jesus set you free
[1:18:33] but what does it look like how does it
[1:18:36] sound well it's right here in
[1:18:38] Revelations chapter 5 we read it for you
[1:18:41] the lamb proceeds from the midst of the
[1:18:44] throne and he begins to release these
[1:18:48] seals now the prophet of God goes
[1:18:50] further and he says this here and we
[1:18:52] read it for you or we played it for you
[1:18:55] Sunday night read it for you this
[1:18:57] morning paragraph 299 talk about a
[1:19:00] jubilee talk about a time when that lamb
[1:19:04] walked forth see the book is even sealed
[1:19:07] in heaven the Mysteries are say is my
[1:19:11] name there I don't know I hope it is but
[1:19:14] if it is it was put on the book before
[1:19:17] the foundation of the world but the
[1:19:19] first thing that represented that
[1:19:22] Redemption come the lamb that had been
[1:19:25] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:19:28] he took the book Glory opened the book
[1:19:33] and tore off the seals and sent it down
[1:19:36] to the Earth to its seventh angel to
[1:19:39] reveal it to his
[1:19:43] people in parenthesis it says
[1:19:45] congregation greatly rejoices youall
[1:19:47] remember that they was fired up what
[1:19:50] they was they praising the Lord sound
[1:19:53] like maybe we can use some of that in
[1:19:54] our church too that's what they did on
[1:19:57] the tape and they begin to praise and
[1:20:01] there you are what happened the screams
[1:20:04] the shouts the
[1:20:06] Hallelujah the anointed the power the
[1:20:10] glory the
[1:20:12] manifestation the Bible the prophet the
[1:20:15] tape said the congregation continues to
[1:20:18] greatly Rejoice so we see that this uh
[1:20:22] book being opening and real time
[1:20:26] 1963 the prophet of God is now going to
[1:20:30] uh present the revelation of the Seven
[1:20:33] Seals as God give it to
[1:20:35] him now what's so nice about that we
[1:20:38] read it in the scripture or we heard it
[1:20:40] on the tape I read it for you just now
[1:20:42] that that lamb took the book and he
[1:20:45] gives it to
[1:20:47] who he gives it to the seventh angel is
[1:20:50] that right let's take our scriptures one
[1:20:52] more time in Revelations chapter 10
[1:20:56] verses 1-7
[1:21:05] quickly he said brother Israel I don't
[1:21:08] think that's I don't think that's
[1:21:10] fulfilled and and the prophet brother
[1:21:12] Brandon well you better find somebody to
[1:21:14] fulfill it because there's going to be a
[1:21:16] seventh
[1:21:17] angel and Revelations 10 vers 7 says
[1:21:22] this but in the days of The Voice of the
[1:21:25] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:21:27] sound the mysteries of God should be
[1:21:30] finished as he declared it to his
[1:21:33] servants the prophets so we see that
[1:21:37] this coming Angel this angel that comes
[1:21:41] to reveal the Mysteries he's revealing
[1:21:45] these Mysteries that he received from
[1:21:48] the lamb because the lamb is the one
[1:21:50] that opened the book amen and we know
[1:21:54] that this was a book of redemption and
[1:21:56] that book of redemption showed that we
[1:22:00] can now go free this was the Gospel
[1:22:04] trumpet sound this was the Jubilee in
[1:22:08] the Old Testament they can hear that
[1:22:10] they can now go free in the New
[1:22:12] Testament you'll see that many of the
[1:22:15] Apostles didn't know exactly who they
[1:22:18] were in the Commonwealth of God the
[1:22:22] Peter didn't really know the apostle
[1:22:24] Saul before his name was changed he
[1:22:27] didn't know and many of us we don't even
[1:22:30] know exactly what the Lord has for us
[1:22:33] until the word of the Lord comes our way
[1:22:36] and the lord always sends an angel to
[1:22:40] reveal the truth of the word it's
[1:22:42] throughout the Bible we'll take two
[1:22:43] examples here in just a moment if the
[1:22:46] Lord will help us but he uses an angel
[1:22:48] and an angel is a
[1:22:52] messenger and the messenger has a
[1:22:56] message and this message of redemption
[1:23:00] is to you and I that can hear the gospel
[1:23:02] truth and realize that you can go free
[1:23:06] that Calvary was for you that what Jesus
[1:23:10] did at the cross was specifically for
[1:23:12] you and as the word of God begins to
[1:23:15] open up in your life you'll realize it's
[1:23:18] not just about Moses or the Hebrews or
[1:23:22] the Bible characters it's about God's
[1:23:25] relationship with you as it opens up
[1:23:29] you'll see as you get closer to the Lord
[1:23:32] this is why we should keep our Bibles
[1:23:34] handy with us at all times you know we
[1:23:37] have it on our phones where's my phone
[1:23:39] at it's back there somewhere but the
[1:23:41] phone doesn't represent your Bible this
[1:23:44] right here represents the word of God
[1:23:46] that's all it represents your phone
[1:23:49] represents all kind of other things it
[1:23:51] got Maps it got notes it's got things on
[1:23:53] there somebody can see send you
[1:23:54] something you don't like and so there's
[1:23:56] quite a difference and so handle it the
[1:23:58] way you want to but this is the only
[1:24:01] thing it represents only one thing it's
[1:24:04] not a subcategory or a source among
[1:24:08] other sources like your phone like your
[1:24:10] tablet and I use them all the time I'm
[1:24:12] not hating on the phone or the tablet
[1:24:14] but when you pick up your phone and
[1:24:16] you're looking down at it we don't know
[1:24:17] what you reading but when you have this
[1:24:20] open we know exactly what you're reading
[1:24:22] can I get a witness that's why prefer it
[1:24:24] in the in the in the in our reading I
[1:24:27] prefer it to have it handy with you
[1:24:30] because as your relationship grows with
[1:24:33] the Bible your relationship grows with
[1:24:36] the Lord you can't say l Lord have mercy
[1:24:39] upon me I want to know more about you
[1:24:42] but I don't have time to read the Bible
[1:24:44] sorry doesn't work that way the way you
[1:24:47] get closer to the Lord is by reading
[1:24:49] your Bible he is the word and his word
[1:24:54] is written for us so that we can read it
[1:24:58] so as we develop a relationship with it
[1:25:00] it's just nice to have handy have it you
[1:25:03] know clear in your view on your seat in
[1:25:06] your truck or car on your table dining
[1:25:09] room you just flip through the pages get
[1:25:11] a scripture here or there it'll always
[1:25:14] do you good do I got a witness here and
[1:25:17] sometimes we get overwhelmed I haven't
[1:25:19] read my whole Bible I haven't read 10
[1:25:21] chapters I haven't had read I haven't
[1:25:23] read three chapters today I haven't read
[1:25:26] through my scriptures well why don't you
[1:25:27] start by reading one
[1:25:29] verse it's better than no verses and you
[1:25:33] can commit to reading just one verse and
[1:25:36] as you do that it's your relationship
[1:25:39] with the Lord is through this word so
[1:25:43] this great book this great opening of
[1:25:46] redemption opens up the mystery for our
[1:25:50] very lives here
[1:25:52] John I love this now I just have to keep
[1:25:56] myself from getting happy this morning I
[1:25:59] just might dance with the could the can
[1:26:01] the pastor dance in his own church maybe
[1:26:04] y'all won't stop me will
[1:26:06] you John as he's seeing this thing
[1:26:10] unfold you know everybody worships and
[1:26:13] then down at the end there in verse 13
[1:26:15] and then it says then everybody heard I
[1:26:19] John and John begin to worship why is he
[1:26:23] worshiping brother Brandon brings it out
[1:26:25] he says he must have saw his name there
[1:26:29] Hallelujah so him seeing his name and
[1:26:32] the Jubilee are
[1:26:34] connected so it's not just somebody's
[1:26:37] word out there it's your word that
[1:26:39] you're reading and your name is in
[1:26:43] there it is it is what John saw and this
[1:26:47] is what we call Revelation when the Lord
[1:26:50] opens up his word to you he's opened up
[1:26:53] his word word as it pertains to
[1:26:57] you think of that it's nice to read
[1:27:01] about the Old Testament Saints it's nice
[1:27:04] to read about the New Testament Saints
[1:27:06] but we're talking about the you
[1:27:08] Testament we're talking about you in the
[1:27:11] scripture and the word of God coming
[1:27:13] alive in
[1:27:16] you it don't mean it it don't mean much
[1:27:19] until you can see your name in
[1:27:21] it and so this revelation of the word is
[1:27:25] specific it's specific to your very life
[1:27:29] not just like I said the old and the New
[1:27:32] Testament but it's the Testaments as
[1:27:35] they pertain to your life you hear the
[1:27:38] gospel it reveals to you what your
[1:27:42] rights are it tells you where you are
[1:27:45] and it tells you what freedoms you have
[1:27:49] that's what the gospel trumpet does it
[1:27:51] gives you information you think you know
[1:27:54] what your name is like Jacob but do when
[1:27:56] he wrestle with the angel the angel told
[1:28:00] him what his name was and his name
[1:28:02] wasn't Jacob no more your name is Israel
[1:28:06] I'm changing your name how you gonna
[1:28:09] change my name because I know you better
[1:28:12] than you know you and the word of God
[1:28:15] will find you because the word knows you
[1:28:19] better than you know you does that make
[1:28:22] sense you're lost until you find him and
[1:28:26] when you find him you realize that
[1:28:28] you're saved and he starts you to
[1:28:31] understand who you really are and so
[1:28:34] this this these instructions that come
[1:28:38] from the
[1:28:39] angel this is what the seventh Angel's
[1:28:42] Ministry was he gets these seals now and
[1:28:45] he releases them to the seventh angel
[1:28:48] It's composed in this little book here
[1:28:50] Pastor figuro brother Bobby's daddy gave
[1:28:53] me this book nice copy and as a gift in
[1:28:57] um I have several copies some of them
[1:29:00] are Torah but it's so nice just to go
[1:29:01] through it and read it this is what the
[1:29:03] seventh angel received from the lamb and
[1:29:08] in that it would reveal to John that his
[1:29:12] name was in there this is why John got
[1:29:15] happy this is why he said that John must
[1:29:19] have looked a past the
[1:29:21] curtain and saw John
[1:29:26] in the breach paragraph number 304 he
[1:29:28] says this
[1:29:32] here are we still together
[1:29:35] here look at this
[1:29:40] here so John's in a vision and he's
[1:29:43] writing these things that he
[1:29:46] sees he says he was so happy till he
[1:29:48] said everything in heaven he must have
[1:29:51] really cried out didn't he everything in
[1:29:54] heaven everything in Earth everything
[1:29:56] beneath the Earth every creature
[1:29:59] everything else heard me saying amen
[1:30:03] blessings Glory wisdom power might
[1:30:07] riches belongs to him amen why when the
[1:30:11] Revelation come that lamb the Redeemer
[1:30:15] our Kinsman had come back from the
[1:30:17] Throne of his mediatorial and had walked
[1:30:20] out there to take his possession
[1:30:24] talk about a Happy Time paragraph 303
[1:30:27] when them seals broke John must have
[1:30:29] looked in and seen past the curtain of
[1:30:33] time and said there is
[1:30:36] John remember the 24 Elders who are they
[1:30:40] the 24 Elders are the 20 the 12 sons of
[1:30:44] Israel the Patriarchs and the TW
[1:30:47] Apostles which John is one of them so
[1:30:50] here's the 24 elders and John and this
[1:30:52] vision is seeing this thing break and he
[1:30:55] can count and see these Elders oh who's
[1:30:58] that it looks more to me like any of the
[1:31:02] other ones who is that that's you John
[1:31:06] oh everything can hear me
[1:31:08] praise glory and honor and wisdom and
[1:31:13] power everything in heaven on the earth
[1:31:16] and under the Earth heard I John so you
[1:31:20] see why we shout we shout because of
[1:31:24] what we see we shout because of a
[1:31:27] revelation we have we don't shout
[1:31:29] because the crowd is shouting it's okay
[1:31:32] if the crowd shouts but the reason why
[1:31:35] you are shouting in the crowd is because
[1:31:37] what God has showed you it's a
[1:31:39] revelation of who you are he shows you
[1:31:43] his will he shows you his word he tells
[1:31:47] you your freedoms and somehow or another
[1:31:50] that amen comes out of your soul
[1:31:55] amen thank you Lord Praise His Name
[1:32:01] worship the individual begins to worship
[1:32:04] as an individual but we're here as a
[1:32:06] group and we're worshiping based on what
[1:32:09] we can see in the
[1:32:12] scripture not just seeing the scripture
[1:32:15] for the sake of saying amen but it's
[1:32:17] seeing ourself in the scripture that it
[1:32:21] pertains to me that I'm the the bride of
[1:32:24] Christ that I can be set free from all
[1:32:27] of my sins that all my iniquities will
[1:32:31] be charged a away from me or taken away
[1:32:35] from me through the blood of the
[1:32:37] Lamb amen can I take 15 more
[1:32:41] minutes now this angel coming to John
[1:32:45] this angel coming to the church changes
[1:32:49] everything this is a pivotal point so
[1:32:53] when the the seals break or begin to
[1:32:56] break on John that's when the Weeping
[1:33:00] stopped that's when the crying stopped
[1:33:04] is when it broke on him what the lamb
[1:33:07] was doing what was taking place the most
[1:33:10] Sublime act in the scripture we see it
[1:33:13] it's like when that man or woman can see
[1:33:15] what Calvary has done not for the entire
[1:33:18] world not just for the bad people but
[1:33:21] what Calvary has done for you
[1:33:24] when it is when you see what Calvary
[1:33:27] means it'll break you down it'll make a
[1:33:30] grown man cry and weep at the sins that
[1:33:35] he's committed against this lovely one
[1:33:38] the Lord Jesus it'll make you repent of
[1:33:41] your sins it'll cause you great sorrow
[1:33:46] to know that you were the one who put
[1:33:48] him on the cross he was charged guilty
[1:33:51] of the crimes that you and I did
[1:33:55] he was indicted for it and when you see
[1:33:58] yourself in that transaction it's not
[1:34:01] just you know it's not enough to feel
[1:34:03] guilty or feel sorry because everyone
[1:34:06] else is crying but when you feel guilty
[1:34:09] for the sins that you've committed
[1:34:11] against him move everybody else out of
[1:34:14] it well my parents did this and my U
[1:34:17] round was this or my background was this
[1:34:19] and all of this happened to me move all
[1:34:21] of that out of the way what about the
[1:34:23] crimes that you committed against him
[1:34:26] and when you see your crimes it'll cause
[1:34:28] you to weep but then he takes he takes
[1:34:32] your weeping and he tells you it's okay
[1:34:35] I paid a price for you will you accept
[1:34:38] it and you say well what do I have to
[1:34:40] give oh you have nothing to give you
[1:34:45] there's no money you can pay for it
[1:34:48] there's no works or deeds do I have to
[1:34:51] crawl on my knees do I have to pay all
[1:34:53] of my money do I have to pay penants no
[1:34:56] none of that he took care of all of that
[1:34:58] at
[1:34:59] Calvary he paid it
[1:35:02] all Jesus Paid It
[1:35:05] All am man He Paid a Debt that he did
[1:35:08] not owe and I owed a debt that I could
[1:35:12] not pay and he paid that debt for you
[1:35:16] and I how many know what I'm talking
[1:35:19] about oh my no complaining when you
[1:35:23] think about what he's done for
[1:35:25] you no pride no bad attitudes when you
[1:35:29] think about what he's done for you so
[1:35:31] this great event this great event of
[1:35:34] redemption now coming to the hand of men
[1:35:38] and women you and I now this angel will
[1:35:43] see him show himself in different places
[1:35:47] in the scripture and when he
[1:35:50] does he changes the course of that that
[1:35:53] individual's life I'm going to take a
[1:35:55] little Bible character that we don't
[1:35:57] talk about too much and that's this
[1:35:59] little girl little lady
[1:36:02] Hagar she was um a servant to Sarah
[1:36:07] Abraham and Sarah and Hagar was an
[1:36:11] Egyptian and she
[1:36:15] has
[1:36:16] um the task of being a servant to them
[1:36:20] and Sarah could not have children
[1:36:24] so she has it in her mind it's her idea
[1:36:27] it's not Abraham's it's not a aar's idea
[1:36:30] but she has it in her mind I'll give my
[1:36:33] maid to my husband and I'll have my
[1:36:36] children through
[1:36:39] her she slightly she slightly doubted
[1:36:42] the promise Abraham doubted it too if
[1:36:46] Abraham had strong faith he would have
[1:36:48] said no we don't need to do that we
[1:36:50] don't need to help God but we're going
[1:36:52] to we're going to help God out out
[1:36:53] because I can't have children and I'm
[1:36:56] getting old and there was a promise that
[1:36:58] I'd have a son but we'll help God out
[1:37:00] how we going to help him we'll give
[1:37:02] Abraham Hagar he has Hagar and she
[1:37:06] conceives a child and as she sees that
[1:37:09] she conceives a child she now begins to
[1:37:12] despise Sarah and Sarah didn't like
[1:37:15] it but Sarah you're the one who started
[1:37:18] it and Sarah got so mad she treated her
[1:37:22] very harshly that this woman takes off
[1:37:24] and leaves she quits the job I quit and
[1:37:28] she leaves and she's out in the
[1:37:31] wilderness somewhere and the Bible says
[1:37:33] in Genesis chapter 16 that the angel
[1:37:36] found
[1:37:38] her and when the angel found her he
[1:37:40] called her by her name and he asked her
[1:37:44] the question where are you coming from
[1:37:49] and where are you going let me ask you
[1:37:52] this do you think the angel knew where
[1:37:54] she was coming from you anytime the Lord
[1:37:58] or the angel asks you a question it's
[1:38:01] not because he don't know the answer
[1:38:03] already he already knows the answer but
[1:38:06] he's asking her where are you coming
[1:38:08] from where are you going and she says
[1:38:11] well my mistress treated me so hard and
[1:38:14] I had to leave and the angel says return
[1:38:18] back to
[1:38:19] her submit yourself under her hands and
[1:38:23] we know just looking at the time it was
[1:38:25] at least 13 or maybe 15 years that she
[1:38:29] had to go back and serve under this
[1:38:32] harsh condition but the Lord instructs
[1:38:35] her through this Angel to go back so she
[1:38:38] goes back to to Sarah and he tells her
[1:38:42] return and submit to under her hands I
[1:38:45] will multiply thy seed
[1:38:47] exceedingly your son you'll call him
[1:38:51] ishmail and that means god hear it
[1:38:54] and I'm going to bless you
[1:38:57] because because the Lord has heard your
[1:39:02] cry now she cried out because of the
[1:39:05] harsh treatment but God had a purpose
[1:39:07] and a plan for her life and it was under
[1:39:10] these harsh extreme conditions you think
[1:39:14] of you know how Sarah treated this
[1:39:16] little Egyptian and you fast forward a
[1:39:19] few years how the Egyptians treated
[1:39:22] Sarah's children
[1:39:24] it all comes back around don't it for
[1:39:27] sure
[1:39:29] and she names him ishmail she submits
[1:39:33] herself at least 15 years or so at least
[1:39:37] after Isaac is weaned Sarah sees the two
[1:39:40] boys playing ishmail mocking Isaac and
[1:39:45] now kicks her out and leaves her Abraham
[1:39:48] gives her a bottle of water a little bit
[1:39:51] to eat it all Runs Out she's in the
[1:39:54] wilderness they're about to die she says
[1:39:56] I don't want to see my son die so she
[1:39:59] steps away from him and the little baby
[1:40:02] is crying and God hears that baby's cry
[1:40:06] now this little ishmail we say what you
[1:40:08] want about him we criticize them now
[1:40:11] today with all of the um the historical
[1:40:14] fighting and so forth going on but he's
[1:40:17] the Seed of
[1:40:18] Abraham and God kept him
[1:40:21] alive huh it was God that kept ishmail
[1:40:25] alive the angel of the Lord heard this
[1:40:29] baby crying this young boy crying and
[1:40:32] came down and showed her a wh and she
[1:40:37] her life was changed she saw the well
[1:40:40] she caused this boy to get married and
[1:40:42] from him preceded 12 princes and we see
[1:40:45] this great this name when the angel
[1:40:49] catches her again the second time
[1:40:52] remember the Lord had already told her
[1:40:53] she's going to have a son told her that
[1:40:56] she's going to bless her seed told her
[1:40:59] that yeah you're just a servant you're
[1:41:01] an Egyptian but I'm going to bless your
[1:41:03] seed after you now this brings a
[1:41:06] perspective to her life now where fors
[1:41:09] she was just a slave but now she's
[1:41:12] actually gonna have a very important son
[1:41:15] and now this this helps her to go back
[1:41:18] and submit herself under such harsh
[1:41:21] conditions because the a Angel has
[1:41:24] spoken to her and given her these
[1:41:28] instructions we need that
[1:41:30] today if the angel of the Lord would
[1:41:32] come and give us instructions it'll
[1:41:34] probably tell us something that would
[1:41:36] blow our mind we probably couldn't take
[1:41:39] it wouldn't believe it you you know you
[1:41:42] know you you have your capabilities like
[1:41:45] this right here but God maybe has your
[1:41:47] capabilities way out here over here and
[1:41:50] when God begins to share things with you
[1:41:52] you you always limit yourself be be the
[1:41:56] the the believer always limits itself
[1:41:59] but the scriptures and the promises of
[1:42:01] God are
[1:42:02] unlimited and to whosoever will God will
[1:42:05] take that word and multiply it in your
[1:42:09] life you see it's when the angel reveals
[1:42:14] the seals to you that you can really
[1:42:17] begin to put things together and realize
[1:42:19] who you are even today to preach this
[1:42:24] message today the angel had to reveal
[1:42:27] that and so now we can't preach a
[1:42:29] message like any other group or any
[1:42:32] other church or any kind of people we
[1:42:34] have to go by the instructions that the
[1:42:36] angel has given to us and it's a
[1:42:39] definite difference from before we heard
[1:42:42] the word to when we now hearing the word
[1:42:47] amen it's a pivot of all it's a it's a
[1:42:50] tremendous difference you know just
[1:42:53] gradually know all things no there's a
[1:42:56] revelation that God gives you there's a
[1:42:59] test there's a trial there's years of
[1:43:03] you floundering your time away years of
[1:43:06] you not capitalizing on an oldfashioned
[1:43:09] altar years of you not capitalizing of
[1:43:12] reading your Bible and praying but then
[1:43:14] when the angel comes to you it quickens
[1:43:17] those things to you and then you'll
[1:43:19] start to take these things more personal
[1:43:22] you'll start to internalize the
[1:43:24] scripture and it means more to you now
[1:43:27] than it ever meant to you
[1:43:29] before sure we need the angel of the
[1:43:33] Lord how many you know all believers
[1:43:35] have a true Angel call it a word body a
[1:43:39] theophany you get to hear from that
[1:43:41] don't you and that thing reveals things
[1:43:45] to
[1:43:46] you and I wonder if he wants to reveal
[1:43:49] something to you
[1:43:50] today I wonder what the Ang wants to
[1:43:53] reveal to you today has anything to do
[1:43:56] with what's going on out there in the
[1:43:58] world today I wonder if it has anything
[1:44:01] to do with what the economy is doing or
[1:44:04] who lied on who or who divorced who or
[1:44:08] what uh what other things going on out
[1:44:11] there I wonder if what he wants to
[1:44:13] reveal to you is laying right here in
[1:44:15] his
[1:44:16] word as he sounds that voice off to you
[1:44:21] you begin to realize who who you are in
[1:44:24] God's Great
[1:44:26] economy she went this distance away off
[1:44:30] this is several years later now and
[1:44:33] she's now coming to the time that she
[1:44:35] has to leave from um Sarah and Abraham
[1:44:39] and now the angel comes to her and says
[1:44:42] hegar what alth Thee the the the a
[1:44:47] better word for alien he says Hagar what
[1:44:50] troubles you what's your trouble Hagar
[1:44:53] and this Angel is directly involved in
[1:44:56] this lady's Life In This Girl's Life and
[1:45:00] she's an Egyptian yes she's not of the
[1:45:02] Seed of Abraham yes but she had an angel
[1:45:05] come to
[1:45:07] her she had a conversation with the
[1:45:11] angel and the angel instructed her on
[1:45:15] how she should do or what's going to
[1:45:17] take place in her life and if it's the
[1:45:19] angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord
[1:45:20] ain't going to lie to you this is is
[1:45:23] more valuable than your mom or dad
[1:45:25] talking to you this is more valuable
[1:45:28] than any other venue of
[1:45:30] news or information that we like to get
[1:45:34] caught up into interesting news or
[1:45:37] interesting information the angel coming
[1:45:40] to you is where your DNA is being
[1:45:43] revealed to
[1:45:45] you begin to tell you really what your
[1:45:47] name you think your name is Junior or
[1:45:50] senior oh that ain't your name let the
[1:45:53] angel wrestle with you and he'll show
[1:45:55] you what your name is when the angel
[1:45:58] gets through with you he'll set you on a
[1:46:00] course with h a message now now you can
[1:46:05] go clearly you have instructions now
[1:46:08] amen God heareth the lad Genesis
[1:46:13] 21:18 and he reissues the promise to
[1:46:17] Hagar and her son ishmail I like that so
[1:46:21] much we see this
[1:46:23] taking place with this great angel that
[1:46:26] comes to this gentleman Gideon we'll
[1:46:30] take this one last Bible character and
[1:46:33] then we'll let you go amen Gideon in the
[1:46:37] Bible Judges chapter 6 remember Gideon
[1:46:41] he
[1:46:43] is
[1:46:45] there they're in this situation where
[1:46:47] the Lord leaves Israel for seven years
[1:46:53] and they're in bondage for seven years
[1:46:55] under M under the midianites and the
[1:46:58] midianites and treated them very
[1:47:00] harshly he would ruin them and come
[1:47:03] through and take with they come in the
[1:47:05] scripture says like without numbers men
[1:47:08] on camels would come through and sweep
[1:47:11] through their Harvest and take over the
[1:47:14] strength of their land the increase of
[1:47:17] the earth they destroyed it took their
[1:47:19] sheep their oxes their asses and all
[1:47:23] that they worked so hard for and here is
[1:47:25] a young man by the name of Gideon and
[1:47:28] he's standing by The Wine Press hiding
[1:47:32] wheat he's hiding wheat near The Wine
[1:47:36] Press I thought the wine press is for
[1:47:38] grapes I thought the wine press is for
[1:47:41] wine why do you have wheat in the wine
[1:47:43] press well he has his wheat in the wine
[1:47:46] press because he's hiding it from the
[1:47:48] enemy I'm not gonna fight with him I'm
[1:47:51] just gonna hide from him I'm not going
[1:47:53] to confront it I'm just going to learn
[1:47:55] to work around it that's what many of us
[1:47:57] do with the troubles that alth us and
[1:48:01] the troubles that keep us down we learn
[1:48:03] how to work around them or or just live
[1:48:06] with the situation or situ or the
[1:48:08] problem but Gideon is here hiding this
[1:48:12] wheat and look at the angel of the Lord
[1:48:15] comes to him in verse um first it says
[1:48:19] that they repented Israel Cried unto the
[1:48:22] Lord and they prayed uh Judges chapter
[1:48:25] 6: 7 they cried out to the Lord because
[1:48:28] of the Affliction in verses 8 through1
[1:48:31] the Lord sends a prophet now this
[1:48:34] Prophet comes to Israel and tell them
[1:48:38] why they've done wrong um the prophet
[1:48:41] comes and gives them a message and the
[1:48:44] message instructs them on where they had
[1:48:48] gone off and what they have done that
[1:48:50] was wrong and after this prophet sends
[1:48:53] his message then the angel of the Lord
[1:48:55] came and sat under an oak
[1:48:57] tree Judges chapter 6 verse 11 he's
[1:49:01] sitting down he looks just like a man
[1:49:04] everybody thinks he's a man no doubt
[1:49:06] he's just a regular guy sitting under
[1:49:08] the oak tree and he's watching Gideon
[1:49:12] when Gideon walks by him he said the
[1:49:14] Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[1:49:17] Valor like we like who are you talking
[1:49:19] to you talking to me you the Lord is
[1:49:23] with thee thou might I wonder who else
[1:49:26] ever told him something like that I
[1:49:29] wonder if that's the first time he heard
[1:49:32] that let me say this to you Christians
[1:49:34] and to you Believers there are some
[1:49:37] firsttime Revelations that God wants to
[1:49:40] give you something you've never seen
[1:49:43] before that was always in your Bible
[1:49:46] always in the message and you just have
[1:49:49] to stay with the word and God will
[1:49:51] reveal to you you who you are this is
[1:49:55] the angel now calling him a mighty man
[1:49:57] of Valor in other words calling him a
[1:50:00] mighty
[1:50:03] warrior the Lord is with thee mighty
[1:50:07] warrior I'm hiding wheat from my enemy
[1:50:11] we've been in bondage for seven years
[1:50:13] and how is the Lord with me and look at
[1:50:14] Gideon's attitude and this is the
[1:50:17] attitude of a true scriptural man
[1:50:20] brother brandom says he says if the Lord
[1:50:22] Lord is with us then where are all the
[1:50:26] Miracles and why have we been forsaken
[1:50:30] like this so Gideon now asks this Angel
[1:50:36] these questions and the angel tells him
[1:50:38] to go in this thy might go in this
[1:50:41] strength and the Lord's going to deliver
[1:50:44] the midianites into your hands these
[1:50:47] questions that Gideon ask reveals what
[1:50:50] kind of man he is now I read a quote for
[1:50:52] you all last Sunday I want to read it
[1:50:54] again uh a couple Sundays ago I'll read
[1:50:56] it again for you again here in the
[1:50:59] message he carth for you
[1:51:01] 1960 paragraph
[1:51:03] 31 says there's only one way that you'll
[1:51:06] ever be able to receive this wonderful
[1:51:08] comforter is When You Believe on the
[1:51:10] Lord Jesus Christ confess your sins
[1:51:14] repent have Christian baptism ad
[1:51:16] minister to you and a promise that God
[1:51:19] will fill you with the Holy Spirit
[1:51:22] that's his promise he cannot go go back
[1:51:25] on that it's his promise I've always
[1:51:28] said if a person was thoroughly taught
[1:51:32] and was repented and from their heart
[1:51:35] had believed on God with all that was
[1:51:37] within them and when they are
[1:51:40] baptized immediately the holy spirit
[1:51:43] will come upon them because he promised
[1:51:46] to do so he promised it and I like that
[1:51:50] you know this is Gideon Gideon is saying
[1:51:52] like where is this quote in
[1:51:55] manifestation um you know you get people
[1:51:57] get baptized that's a great Point that's
[1:51:59] a great tremendous happening but what
[1:52:02] happens after you get baptized you're
[1:52:04] supposed to receive what why we don't
[1:52:07] talk about it
[1:52:08] enough why is that like you know I got
[1:52:11] baptized you know you got baptized so
[1:52:13] you can receive the Holy Ghost that's
[1:52:16] the next step that's the next stage
[1:52:20] that's what God has for you has for us
[1:52:24] any true church should be asking if God
[1:52:27] is with us where's the Sinners coming to
[1:52:30] the Lord where's the gifts of the Spirit
[1:52:33] where's the Holy Ghost falling down on
[1:52:35] our assembly where if God is with us
[1:52:38] we're all the Miracles but yet we make
[1:52:41] excuses and sometimes we shy away from
[1:52:44] this portion of the promise you repent
[1:52:48] and then you're baptized then God will
[1:52:51] fill you with the hope holy ghost that
[1:52:53] is the
[1:52:55] promise it's it's not it's not meant to
[1:52:58] make people get upset or fight over it's
[1:53:00] a promise that he made this promise is
[1:53:05] unto you and to your children and all
[1:53:08] those that are far off even as many as
[1:53:10] what the Lord Our God shall
[1:53:15] call and the day and and the day comes
[1:53:19] when our assemblies Don't Preach the
[1:53:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost then you're
[1:53:24] not preaching the
[1:53:26] message can't be you're not preaching
[1:53:29] the Holy Ghost to fill the believer just
[1:53:33] like it did in the Bible just like it
[1:53:35] did on the tapes and you're not
[1:53:36] preaching the
[1:53:38] message and a true man of God will ask
[1:53:42] that question if God is with us then
[1:53:44] where are the
[1:53:46] Miracles you know what's interesting
[1:53:48] about the Miracles brother bam was
[1:53:49] talking about when he he used to when he
[1:53:52] first went on the field he said he would
[1:53:54] tell his staff to get the hardest case
[1:53:58] get any case and before I leave from
[1:54:00] here they will be healed he said in
[1:54:02] Phoenix there's a crippled up girl he
[1:54:04] stayed on that platform for an hour and
[1:54:06] 45 minutes praying for her until the
[1:54:09] Lord healed her then it was in
[1:54:11] Burlington Vermont I believe it was that
[1:54:14] he he CLA made another claim like that
[1:54:16] and there was a boy came up that was
[1:54:18] born blind 15 years 15 years old brother
[1:54:22] says he started praying for him and it
[1:54:24] was an hour or two hours of prayer
[1:54:28] before that Spirit broke and he said
[1:54:31] what happened he says that all the
[1:54:33] others that needed prayer he missed
[1:54:36] those because he was just dealing with
[1:54:37] this one case and that night 3 o'clock
[1:54:40] in the morning the angel of the Lord
[1:54:42] came to him and revealed to him that if
[1:54:46] he relies only on the Miracles then the
[1:54:50] people will only begin to look for
[1:54:54] miracles and so he had to step back from
[1:54:57] just relying on the Miracles and what
[1:54:59] we've done we don't even pray for a
[1:55:01] miracle
[1:55:02] now but God the god that we serve is a
[1:55:07] miracle working God and if you're a
[1:55:09] young person here and you live in and
[1:55:13] and and you you go to this church or any
[1:55:15] church and you're a young person raised
[1:55:17] up in the message if your if your
[1:55:20] expectation is that you don't see any
[1:55:21] miracle Les then I did a wrong job as a
[1:55:25] pastor to you and whoever else you're
[1:55:26] listening to because those tapes you
[1:55:29] listening to full of
[1:55:33] Miracles amen I got a witness
[1:55:36] there am I talking about Divine Healing
[1:55:39] Divine Healing is part of it too but a
[1:55:41] miracle is different than just Divine
[1:55:43] Healing a miracle is uh the the the
[1:55:48] miraculous part of the gospel and if God
[1:55:51] is with us then we're the Miracles and
[1:55:53] this is what this this young man this
[1:55:56] scriptural taught man the angel comes to
[1:55:59] him now and begins to tell him that God
[1:56:02] is with him this is going to change his
[1:56:05] life he's a mighty man he don't even
[1:56:07] know it his name will be changed to
[1:56:09] jeruel he don't know it he's going to go
[1:56:11] into the city now and burn and cut down
[1:56:15] an altar and all of his Brethren are
[1:56:18] serving this God and he knew he was
[1:56:20] going to cause a harm to his family but
[1:56:24] that's what it'll do once you find out
[1:56:26] who you are when the angel comes to you
[1:56:29] and reveals to you who you are it'll
[1:56:32] change the course of your
[1:56:34] life he tells them to go in this might
[1:56:38] he asked those scriptural questions look
[1:56:41] at his scripture his questions in um
[1:56:44] Judges chapter 6 verse th 13 let's take
[1:56:47] a portion of that and then we'll let you
[1:56:49] go Judges chapter 6
[1:57:02] Joshua
[1:57:04] Judges
[1:57:06] right Judges chapter
[1:57:13] 6 what the scripture say here
[1:57:29] and verse number
[1:57:32] 13 Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if
[1:57:36] the Lord be with us why then is all this
[1:57:39] befallen us and where be all his
[1:57:42] miracles which our fathers told us of
[1:57:46] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[1:57:49] Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us
[1:57:52] and delivered us into the hand of the
[1:57:53] midianites so here this young man he was
[1:57:57] obviously not a part of them that came
[1:57:59] out of Egypt but he heard the
[1:58:02] testimony he heard those tapes on what
[1:58:05] took place in Egypt he heard the message
[1:58:09] of the
[1:58:10] fathers he knew who Moses was he knew
[1:58:14] who Joshua was he knew what the fathers
[1:58:16] talked about and he asked the question
[1:58:19] where be the Miracles that they talking
[1:58:21] about my dad and them was talking
[1:58:24] about you know if you if you ask those
[1:58:28] kind of questions those are scriptural
[1:58:31] questions those are questions that come
[1:58:34] from a Hungry Heart that wants to see
[1:58:37] God move in their midst move in their
[1:58:40] assembly I wish someone would ask that
[1:58:42] question here today I wish we wasn't
[1:58:45] satisfied with just coming to church and
[1:58:46] then you look at the clock and say well
[1:58:48] it's time for us to go it's time for us
[1:58:50] to leave and we'll be back back next
[1:58:52] Sunday same time same
[1:58:55] thing we have it all mapped out on what
[1:58:57] God's going to
[1:58:59] do but I wonder if we would ask a
[1:59:01] question what about the God that we
[1:59:03] heard about on the
[1:59:05] tapes
[1:59:07] huh we heard about what he did in Egypt
[1:59:10] and if God is with us and you calling me
[1:59:12] a mighty man of Valor where is this
[1:59:16] God brother bham calls him a scriptural
[1:59:19] man he goes into the script and he says
[1:59:23] where be the God so my my question is as
[1:59:25] a as a pastor where's the
[1:59:28] repentance where's the Holy Ghost
[1:59:31] where's the gifts of the Spirit
[1:59:36] hallah are they still in the
[1:59:39] Bible are they still on the tapes then
[1:59:42] they should be in your church and if
[1:59:45] they're not in your church that should
[1:59:46] be in your life
[1:59:52] like the one brother said you know I
[1:59:54] came to church and nobody ever preached
[1:59:56] on this or nobody ever talked about that
[1:59:58] like did you make every service this
[2:00:02] year maybe they preached on it when you
[2:00:04] wasn't
[2:00:06] there so we we the the answer the
[2:00:10] problem and the answer they're related
[2:00:13] you have a question and the answer
[2:00:15] they're all related and sometimes you're
[2:00:17] you're looking at the problem them is
[2:00:19] the problem when really the problem you
[2:00:20] need to it circles back and it'll catch
[2:00:23] you you think you're indicting but
[2:00:25] you're really inditing yourself so the
[2:00:28] church is supposed to be this church is
[2:00:29] supposed to be that aren't you the
[2:00:31] church you can't complain about traffic
[2:00:34] when you in
[2:00:36] it you're part of it exactly right so
[2:00:41] you you know the church and and this and
[2:00:44] and that you gotta it starts with
[2:00:45] looking at yourself in in in in the
[2:00:47] mirror and so what did Gideon do when
[2:00:49] the angel comes to him he get
[2:00:51] overwhelmed he didn't run and lose his
[2:00:53] mind he starts to ask this Angel
[2:00:56] questions and that's how you should pick
[2:00:58] your Bible up and pick this message up
[2:01:00] looking for the answer from the
[2:01:04] word and then he tests this angel now if
[2:01:08] this is really you can you wait here for
[2:01:10] a moment I want to bring you a little
[2:01:12] kid I want to bring make a little meal
[2:01:14] for you so the Bible says he goes and
[2:01:16] cuts up a a little goat he makes the
[2:01:18] little meal and he brings the broth and
[2:01:20] he brings the offering on the Rock
[2:01:22] brother Ram says it's probably two or
[2:01:24] three hours
[2:01:27] later so he leaves to go do this and now
[2:01:30] the angel is instructing him and we know
[2:01:32] the great battle that Gideon won that
[2:01:37] Gideon fought he was hiding wheat now
[2:01:40] he's leading an army to take over the
[2:01:48] midianites let me say this to you Satan
[2:01:51] don't don't know who you are he has no
[2:01:55] business telling you who you are cuz he
[2:01:57] don't
[2:01:58] know and and let's let's go a little
[2:02:01] deeper with that you don't know who you
[2:02:02] are
[2:02:04] either it's only when the word reveals
[2:02:07] to you who you are after you wrestle
[2:02:10] with the angel he'll tell you who you
[2:02:13] are and give you your
[2:02:15] instructions no I can't do this or no
[2:02:17] that's not for a resent no no no you're
[2:02:19] a mighty man of Valor Gideon
[2:02:23] now go in this strength go in this might
[2:02:27] and go take care of the midianites I
[2:02:30] wonder how many young men here today how
[2:02:32] many young sisters how many fathers and
[2:02:34] mothers who's been in the word for all
[2:02:36] these years it's still that God has more
[2:02:40] to reveal of himself to
[2:02:43] them I'm talking about
[2:02:46] 2024 I'm talking about right
[2:02:49] now I'm talking about what you used to
[2:02:52] do and what is always done has always
[2:02:54] been I'm talking about that's what
[2:02:55] Gideon had he was hiding Wheat by The
[2:02:58] Wine Press but the angel met him it says
[2:03:03] Thou Mighty Man of Valor oh why nobody
[2:03:07] ever call me that the word called you
[2:03:10] that ain't wait for nobody else to call
[2:03:12] you that the word called the word
[2:03:16] declares who you
[2:03:20] are starts all over doesn't it God makes
[2:03:24] it new to you he makes it fresh to you
[2:03:27] that Take 5 10 more minutes yes sir he
[2:03:30] makes it new he reveals it to you Satan
[2:03:33] don't know who you are you don't even
[2:03:35] know who you are it is on your knees
[2:03:39] that God reveals to you who you are and
[2:03:43] what you're supposed to be
[2:03:45] doing you think you know you have things
[2:03:48] planned out for your own life God has it
[2:03:51] planned out for you God has your life
[2:03:54] your DNA he has the instructions for
[2:03:57] your life and that's all contained that
[2:04:00] information is contained in that angel
[2:04:04] word body that was with you from the
[2:04:07] very
[2:04:08] beginning amen you got to come in
[2:04:10] contact with that it's when that angel
[2:04:13] reveals that word to you that you can
[2:04:16] now declare that you're free you know
[2:04:19] the overwhelming
[2:04:21] issue for our age in Genesis chapter 3:
[2:04:24] 17 the overwhelming indictment for our
[2:04:28] age is that
[2:04:32] they they wouldn't repent the Lord told
[2:04:35] them to
[2:04:37] repent he prays all the other ages but
[2:04:41] but in this age he tells them to buy
[2:04:43] gold dried in the fire buy white rment
[2:04:47] go purchase that tell them to anoint thy
[2:04:51] eyes with I have he that has ears to
[2:04:54] hear Let Him hear but it all starts with
[2:04:59] repent and this age in particular the
[2:05:03] people don't want to repent they don't
[2:05:04] want to say I'm sorry they'll never
[2:05:06] wrong they'll never make right properly
[2:05:09] they won't thoroughly repent they won't
[2:05:11] repent about any they didn't do anything
[2:05:13] wrong you can't say nothing to them you
[2:05:15] can't correct them about nothing you
[2:05:17] can't disagree even disagree with them
[2:05:23] and they lose they lose all credibility
[2:05:25] they can't they you know they disagree
[2:05:27] with me they they they disagree me I
[2:05:29] don't know if I can go on are you
[2:05:31] kidding
[2:05:34] me I don't know if I can make it they
[2:05:36] they don't like me get in line what
[2:05:38] everybody supposed to like
[2:05:40] you what you gonna live this life and
[2:05:43] nobody spread a rumor about
[2:05:45] you good
[2:05:48] luck everybody's supposed to like us
[2:05:53] no no no no no no don't work that
[2:05:56] way but that indictment for this age was
[2:05:59] to
[2:06:00] repent and then go buy gold tried in the
[2:06:04] fire it it's a price it takes time to
[2:06:08] thumb through your Bible to thumb
[2:06:10] through the word of God and find out who
[2:06:13] you
[2:06:13] are to wrestle with the angel how long
[2:06:17] did did Jacob wrestle with that angel
[2:06:20] huh somebody help me Sunday school how
[2:06:24] long did he W wrestle with him all night
[2:06:28] long I mean the Angel's trying to get
[2:06:30] him in the headlock and Jacob trying to
[2:06:32] get him in the headlock he trying to
[2:06:34] twist him up and trying to man maneuver
[2:06:36] he's trying to
[2:06:38] maneuver UFC at its
[2:06:40] finest this angel trying to wrestle with
[2:06:43] this man and this is the Earthly man
[2:06:46] wrestling with a Heavenly Angel and
[2:06:49] Jacob said I won't let you go until you
[2:06:52] reveal my blessing to me many of us come
[2:06:56] and we want God just to dump Revelation
[2:06:58] to dump the Holy Ghost upon dump
[2:07:01] whatever upon us and no no cry no no
[2:07:05] scrapping no fighting no wrestling at
[2:07:08] the
[2:07:09] altar doesn't come that way the Bible
[2:07:12] didn't come that way the message didn't
[2:07:14] come that way and the Holy Ghost doesn't
[2:07:16] come that way comes to a thoroughly
[2:07:19] repented heart that's how it comes
[2:07:23] amen
[2:07:25] amen and so the angel of the Lord
[2:07:28] reveals to us the angel of the Lord the
[2:07:31] messenger of the church has revealed
[2:07:33] these seals to us so we read them and we
[2:07:37] go through them little by little bit by
[2:07:39] bit we see this great Redemption taking
[2:07:41] place and this is the instructions that
[2:07:44] the angel
[2:07:46] gives gives to to the believer I Am SE
[2:07:51] myself in the scripture brother Bobby in
[2:07:54] a way like I never seen before huh and I
[2:07:58] trust each one of you are seeing
[2:08:00] yourself that
[2:08:01] way it's not just you know punching a
[2:08:05] time card we with this something very
[2:08:08] specific to our to our life and our
[2:08:12] livelihood so let's take a few places
[2:08:16] here as I close where brother random is
[2:08:19] talking about this Angel of the Lord
[2:08:21] that came to
[2:08:22] him and so we know the seventh angel
[2:08:26] taught the prophet these things that he
[2:08:28] knows and he I'm just going to I read
[2:08:30] some of these for you before I'll read
[2:08:32] these for you and then we'll then we'll
[2:08:34] go because this is what makes the
[2:08:36] difference is the Angel of the Lord
[2:08:39] revealing these things to you he
[2:08:41] instructs you the angel does and the
[2:08:44] message Be not Afraid paragraph 56 I
[2:08:47] regard you as my friends and my brothers
[2:08:50] and sisters I expect to spend eternity
[2:08:52] with you in glory if you disagree with
[2:08:55] me on my teaching that's perfectly all
[2:08:57] right but I believe if you'll search
[2:08:59] your Bible right good you'll find out
[2:09:02] it's on the mark because first the angel
[2:09:05] of the Lord come to me and taught it to
[2:09:08] me then he showed it me in the Bible
[2:09:12] where to find it I've got find the first
[2:09:16] man that came came can that can down it
[2:09:20] and that's been for years it's the truth
[2:09:23] yes sir some great theologians as I've
[2:09:26] talked to when it's finally come to a
[2:09:28] showdown we know it's right but our
[2:09:31] church would put us out if we accepted
[2:09:33] that all right if you think more of your
[2:09:35] church than you do of Christ that's up
[2:09:37] to
[2:09:38] you see but for me I stand on the word
[2:09:42] in the breach between all the
[2:09:44] denominations saying we are brothers so
[2:09:47] here's a theologian that went to school
[2:09:49] to learn and here's a seventh grade
[2:09:52] education but with an angel you see you
[2:09:56] see the difference a theologian arguing
[2:09:59] with an angel there's no there's no
[2:10:01] comparison and so the angel of the Lord
[2:10:05] taught the prophet amen paragraph number
[2:10:07] three in the message the Messiah I was
[2:10:10] speaking on that and
[2:10:12] turn them to pray for the sick the angel
[2:10:14] of the Lord came right down before them
[2:10:16] all went right over and stood in the
[2:10:19] corner there 300 or more people stood
[2:10:22] and looked at it for 15 minutes
[2:10:24] screaming crying and praising God all of
[2:10:27] them looked the first time had ever come
[2:10:30] like that before our church just come
[2:10:32] right in move right over there and stood
[2:10:35] there I said can you see it every
[2:10:38] Everybody begin screaming and
[2:10:40] falling there it was the big amber light
[2:10:44] of the pillar of fire just as perfectly
[2:10:46] round standing there then it began to
[2:10:49] shade itself and shade every one of
[2:10:52] those churches it's just exactly the way
[2:10:54] I taught them in the pillar of fire God
[2:10:58] knows us the truth here before his Bible
[2:11:02] we're living in the end time surely so
[2:11:05] brother bam is talking about the message
[2:11:07] on the church ages he draws out the each
[2:11:11] age shows that moon and the the darkness
[2:11:14] in each age how had more light in Paul's
[2:11:17] age and arenus and Luther and Martha all
[2:11:19] those age it got darker he drawed it out
[2:11:22] on his black board it's in the church
[2:11:24] age book he draw it out and then right
[2:11:27] at the end the pillar of fire comes into
[2:11:29] the room now into his Tabernacle and
[2:11:32] draws the same thing that he drew
[2:11:35] out somebody's copying
[2:11:39] somebody the angel of the Lord wrote out
[2:11:42] exactly the way the prophet drew it out
[2:11:44] so the prophet's teaching was exactly
[2:11:47] right the angel of the Lord Vindicated
[2:11:50] that
[2:11:51] and some people have a problem with
[2:11:53] talking about it in their churches
[2:11:55] that's up to
[2:11:56] them their problem right not mine the
[2:12:00] godhead explained paragraph 179 he says
[2:12:03] this here
[2:12:05] um paragraph 181 but the only what the
[2:12:09] only way that I can have faith in God is
[2:12:12] to know that the Bible is right and
[2:12:14] believe it's right stay right with it
[2:12:17] though I don't understand it I move it
[2:12:20] anyhow now but when these contradictions
[2:12:23] come up then I go before God to find out
[2:12:27] and the same angel that meets me in the
[2:12:29] meetings at night is the same one who
[2:12:33] taught me this see now see if this is
[2:12:37] how this is now so this is he's talking
[2:12:40] to the trinitarian ministers there in
[2:12:44] Chicago they set the trap for him on
[2:12:46] water baptism he baptized in the name of
[2:12:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and they believe
[2:12:51] that trinitarian baptism Father Son and
[2:12:53] Holy Ghost he asked them to take their
[2:12:55] Bible and show them where any man was
[2:12:58] baptized that way he's there explaining
[2:13:00] how God gave him these Revelations but
[2:13:03] it was the angel of the Lord that deals
[2:13:06] with him when these contradictions come
[2:13:08] up I thank God for them because they
[2:13:11] come from the lamb and from the lamb to
[2:13:13] the seventh angel to release it to his
[2:13:16] church and we have not followed
[2:13:19] cunningly devised faith Ables of men you
[2:13:23] take the messenger out of this equation
[2:13:26] you can try to interpret your Bible if
[2:13:28] you want to but first you need to get an
[2:13:30] angel to interpret it for you and many
[2:13:33] people they want to take the truth of
[2:13:36] the word and then move the prophet out
[2:13:38] of their assembly or out of their
[2:13:41] Ministry you can't do it Revelations
[2:13:43] 10:7 says that the mysteries of God
[2:13:46] would be finished as he declared to his
[2:13:49] servants the prophet
[2:13:51] so these Mysteries are revealed through
[2:13:54] the seventh angel Ministry praise the
[2:13:58] Lord 1965 paragraph number 74 he says
[2:14:01] this here I'm not degrading my
[2:14:03] Presbyterian Brethren there some of you
[2:14:06] Baptist Brethren on the way you have
[2:14:08] security I'm not saying this to be
[2:14:10] different but you didn't have it just
[2:14:12] right see that's right but I had it
[2:14:15] wrong too but when an angel stands from
[2:14:18] heaven and tells you and here is the
[2:14:21] here it is right in the scripture that's
[2:14:24] right see that's right see he always
[2:14:26] speaks exact with the
[2:14:30] scripture all right so why do we always
[2:14:33] point to people that way that's on
[2:14:36] purpose I do that deliberately you know
[2:14:39] where this word comes from I always
[2:14:41] point the people back to this message to
[2:14:44] this messenger because Timothy told us
[2:14:47] the time would come that would not
[2:14:49] endure sound Doctrine 2 Timothy 3 verse1
[2:14:54] 15 it
[2:14:56] says all scripture verse 16 all
[2:15:00] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[2:15:03] and is profitable for Doctrine you got
[2:15:08] there for reproof for what you see it on
[2:15:13] the screen correction for what
[2:15:17] instructions in
[2:15:19] righteousness why that the man of God
[2:15:22] may be what somebody help me preach the
[2:15:26] man of God may be perfect thoroughly
[2:15:30] furnished unto all good works so the
[2:15:34] word of God should directly affect your
[2:15:38] life it is personal it's not the book
[2:15:42] out there and you over here but you come
[2:15:44] one with the book as you read it you
[2:15:46] take on flesh of the word second Timothy
[2:15:51] 4 last scripture he says Paul telling
[2:15:56] Timothy verse number two preach the word
[2:16:00] be instant in season and out of season
[2:16:05] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[2:16:08] longsuffering and Doctrine for the time
[2:16:12] will come when they who is they will not
[2:16:18] endure sound Doctrine but after their
[2:16:21] own lust shall they Heap to themselves
[2:16:25] teachers having itchy ears and they
[2:16:28] shall turn away their ears from the
[2:16:30] truth we've seen that taking place over
[2:16:32] the years we just seen that taking place
[2:16:34] the last five to seven years here we see
[2:16:37] they turn their ears from the truth and
[2:16:39] shall be turned
[2:16:41] unto
[2:16:43] fables but watch thou in all things
[2:16:46] endure afflictions through the work of
[2:16:49] the Evangelist make full proof of thy
[2:16:53] Ministry amen I fought a good fight I
[2:16:56] finished my course I've kept the faith
[2:16:59] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[2:17:01] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[2:17:04] the righteous judge shall give me at
[2:17:06] that day not to me only but but unto all
[2:17:10] them also that
[2:17:13] what love his appearing so the
[2:17:18] Commandment is to preach the word stay
[2:17:20] with the truth endure stay with sound
[2:17:23] Doctrine for the time will come that
[2:17:26] they will not endure sound they won't
[2:17:28] endure it they won't take it it's all
[2:17:30] kind of foolishness on the TV different
[2:17:33] churches those assemblance of the word
[2:17:35] and even Believers won't even question
[2:17:37] and ask where the Miracles are where's
[2:17:40] the where's the god of Elijah where's
[2:17:42] the power of God is the Holy Ghost still
[2:17:45] pouring out it's the Holy Ghost for our
[2:17:47] children and our children's children it
[2:17:49] is the same yes it is the same Holy
[2:17:51] Ghost it's the same work and God does
[2:17:55] not
[2:17:56] change his work is still the same you
[2:18:01] come on those those grounds God will
[2:18:04] fill you with the Holy Ghost if it's
[2:18:06] just one of you if it's just one person
[2:18:08] God's going to keep his word he'll
[2:18:10] bankrupt heaven to make that word come
[2:18:13] alive and let me say this here you'll
[2:18:16] only know who you are as the word of the
[2:18:18] Lord is revealed to you
[2:18:21] as you develop that relationship with
[2:18:24] his
[2:18:25] word it begins to reveal to you who you
[2:18:29] are and what your place is so God bless
[2:18:31] you we pray that the Lord will let his
[2:18:34] Angel wrestle with you a little bit give
[2:18:38] to you the things that you need in your
[2:18:39] life God bless you let's pray Heavenly
