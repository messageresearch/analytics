[17:03] God for the

[17:15] Oh

[17:21] lighthouse and from the
[17:25] rocks of
[17:27] sin he has
[17:30] shone a

[18:23] sin he has shown a

[19:19] Key D
[19:25] [Music]
[19:36] Life is
[19:37] [Music]
[19:40] easy when you're up on the
[19:44] [Music]
[19:45] mountain and you've got peace of
[19:51] mind like you've never
[19:54] [Music]
[19:56] known. But then things change
[20:01] and you're down in the
[20:07] valley. Don't lose
[20:12] faith. For you're never
[20:17] alone. For the God on the
[20:22] mountain is still God in the valley.
[20:29] When things go wrong,
[20:35] he'll make them
[20:38] right. And the God of the good
[20:44] times is the God in
[20:47] the times.
[20:50] The God of the
[20:54] day is still God in the night.
[21:01] You talk of faith
[21:04] [Music]
[21:05] when you're up on the
[21:08] [Music]
[21:10] mountains, but talk comes so
[21:16] easy when life's at its best.
[21:22] But it's down in the
[21:26] valley of trials and
[21:29] [Music]
[21:31] temptations. Well, that's when faith
[21:37] is really put to the test.
[21:43] For the God on the
[21:47] mountain, he's still God in the valley.
[21:52] [Music]
[21:54] When things go wrong,
[21:59] he'll make them right.
[22:04] And the God of the good
[22:08] times, he's still God in the bad times.
[22:15] The God of the day,
[22:18] [Music]
[22:20] he's still God in the night.
[22:25] The God of the day,
[22:30] he's still God in the night.
[22:46] Amen. Thank you, brother and sister
[22:50] Nichols. Let's all stand and sing that
[22:53] song. He brought me
[22:56] out flat.
[23:01] Oh my heart was distressed neath
[23:05] Jehovah's red brown and low in the pit
[23:10] where my sins rack me down. I cried to
[23:15] the Lord from the deep my
[23:19] reclaim who tenderly brought me out to
[23:24] golden day. Oh, he brought me out of the
[23:31] myy
[23:32] clay. He set my feet on the rock to
[23:39] stay. He puts a song in my soul
[23:45] today. A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[23:52] And he placed me upon the strong rock by
[23:58] his side. My steps were
[24:02] stand and here I'll
[24:05] abide. No danger of falling. While here
[24:11] I
[24:12] remain, but stand by his grace until the
[24:17] ground I gain. Oh, he brought me out of
[24:23] the
[24:24] m
[24:26] clay. He set my feet on a rock to
[24:33] stay. He puts a
[24:36] song. So
[24:39] today, a song of praise. Hallelujah.
[24:46] Oh, he gave me a song. Was a new song of
[24:53] praise. By day and by night, it sweet
[24:57] nose I will raise. My heart's
[25:03] overflowing. I'm happy and
[25:06] free. I'll praise my redeemer who has
[25:11] rescued me. Oh, he brought me out of the
[25:18] maryy
[25:20] clay.
[25:23] He on a rock to

[25:40] And I'll sing of his
[25:44] wonderful mercy to me. I'll praise him
[25:49] till all and his goodness shall
[25:53] see. I'll sing of
[25:57] salvation at home and
[26:00] abroad. Till many shall hear the truth
[26:04] and trust in God. Oh, he brought me out
[26:11] of
[26:12] [Music]

[26:37] out my
[26:41] reclaim.

[29:52] paragraph 102. God bless you, brother.
[29:59] [Applause]
[30:01] God bless you. You be
[30:08] seated. I am sorry that we don't have a
[30:13] another couple of weeks of this.
[30:16] I want to say that this has been one of
[30:18] the finest revivals or meetings that I
[30:22] have ever had. It it ranks a red letter
[30:26] to me. This meeting, I've never had a
[30:29] time in my life that I ever had any more
[30:32] liberty and felt any more freer just to
[30:35] preach the very conviction of my heart
[30:37] than what I have in this meeting. And
[30:39] it's been a wonderful time. We had a
[30:42] wonderful time at the businessman's
[30:45] fellowship and also a wonderful time
[30:48] down at brother Sullivan's church this
[30:49] morning and we've met so many fine
[30:52] people and we sure appreciate all this
[30:55] and we want to say to if there happens
[30:58] to be some of the the people that's
[31:02] present and if not you who tend to as
[31:05] such we want to thank the people that
[31:08] let us have this grounds this shitakqua.
[31:11] We appreciate that, my friends. And may
[31:15] it long stand for a purpose to serve the
[31:18] Lord. We appreciate it with all of our
[31:21] hearts. I want to thank brother
[31:24] Sullivan, all the cooperating pastors,
[31:27] all you dear people for all that you
[31:29] have done for me, for the love offering
[31:33] and all that you they said they take up
[31:35] one a while ago. Brother Duplic has just
[31:37] told me and I greet you all and thank
[31:40] you for myself, my wife, my son, Brother
[31:46] David Duplicus, Brother Sullivan, Jean
[31:48] Leo, all the whole staff. We certainly
[31:51] thank you very much. We includedly
[31:54] invite you that if any time that you
[31:56] have any troubles or anything that we
[31:58] could help you while the night never
[32:00] gets too dark and the rain never falls
[32:02] too hard, you could call us. I used to
[32:05] say I could come to you, but there's so
[32:08] many now. I couldn't do it because it
[32:10] runs into well, I guess millions, not
[32:13] only just like here, but around the
[32:15] whole world, you see, and it makes it
[32:17] too hard. I I can't say that. I'd love
[32:19] to do it, but I can't say it with all my
[32:23] heart because I wouldn't be able to do
[32:25] it. But if you have a prayer request,
[32:27] just mail it to me anytime. Just William
[32:29] Brandom, Jeffersonville, Indiana. You
[32:32] want Post Office 325. But you don't have
[32:34] to have that. It'll come anyhow. And
[32:37] we'll be glad to minister to you, send
[32:39] you prayer claws, any help, anything
[32:42] that we can. Absolutely free. Nothing.
[32:44] There's no charges to nothing. We got
[32:47] books. They sell them. And they belong
[32:49] to someone else. Brother Lindsay owns
[32:52] one of them and Brother Julius
[32:53] Statscliffe owns the other. And we buy
[32:56] them at 40 cents less on the books than
[32:59] we have to pay for bringing them, pay
[33:01] for selling them, stay the loss. And you
[33:04] see what we are. It's always in the red.
[33:07] The books are every time we take an
[33:09] inventory on that, we're always behind
[33:11] because I've told the boys and all if
[33:15] they find any person that wants a book
[33:18] and they haven't got the money to pay
[33:20] for it, take it anyhow. Take the book
[33:23] anyhow. And I seen the first night when
[33:26] we started on books, a little old mother
[33:28] standing back there with fumbling in a
[33:29] pocketbook trying to get out 60 cents.
[33:31] She didn't have but 40. I watched the
[33:33] lady that was selling the books. Said,
[33:35] "Well, they are 60 cents." I walked
[33:37] right around and got her two or three
[33:39] and give them to her. See, so I No, what
[33:42] was that? My mother. And another thing,
[33:45] the books are not for commercial.
[33:47] They're to try to help somebody. The boy
[33:50] sells the tapes down there. And here
[33:53] some time ago, I checked up on the boys.
[33:56] Jean and Leo, Jean's my tape boy. Leo is
[34:00] my field secretary. And they have
[34:03] records and tapes. And I checked those
[34:04] boys myself to see what price they're
[34:07] selling those tapes for cuz I bought a
[34:09] tape from a an evangelist. It cost me
[34:11] around $6. Then they're getting $2 and
[34:14] something for them. So I seen what they
[34:16] paid for them and they're just a barely
[34:18] a little margins all they make. And they
[34:20] get I told them get the best tape they
[34:22] could get and they use it on scotch
[34:24] tape. They have those tapes any message
[34:26] or anything. And
[34:28] now sometimes I want to make this clear
[34:31] now. Every man has his own idea. We have
[34:34] your own doctrine. When I'm out here in
[34:37] this interdenominational I try to hold
[34:39] it to the great fundamental evangelical
[34:42] doctrines because of other ministering
[34:45] brothers. And I want the ministering
[34:47] brothers to know this. Sometimes in my
[34:50] own church I preach my own convictions
[34:52] about things in there. There's many
[34:55] people takes the tapes and sometimes
[34:56] they get out. Now I would not want to
[35:00] push anything that I believed over on
[35:02] anybody. Just little something that I
[35:03] had in my own mind and thought it was
[35:05] this way. And if I didn't teach it the
[35:07] way I thought it, I'd be a hypocrite. So
[35:10] I just leave that part alone. Go preach
[35:11] what I know that the rest of them agrees
[35:13] with. You see? And go on. Well, now if
[35:16] you happen to get a hold of some of your
[35:17] members, brother, get a hold of a tape
[35:18] that come from my church up on something
[35:20] that you might not agree with me. Please
[35:22] don't fall out with me about it. I'm
[35:24] your brother. I I love you and I I don't
[35:26] mean for them to get out, but you can't
[35:28] help it when these 20 or 30 taking tapes
[35:30] and everything, it seems. And so, we try
[35:33] to curb it the very best we can. The
[35:35] church tuck it up on themselves, the
[35:37] foundation to to uh try to hold the boys
[35:40] alone when they're taking tapes on my
[35:43] meetings. And so uh I'm here to
[35:46] cooperate to make it one big body of
[35:49] Jesus Christ. That's all. And after all
[35:51] the great fundamental part of it is
[35:53] repentance and baptism and faith towards
[35:56] God, salvation, divine healing. I think
[35:59] all of us can agree upon that. See upon
[36:01] those things. Now the approach to it
[36:03] sometime I might have a little different
[36:05] angle but I think like this one time I
[36:09] was at my work at Jeffersonville. I was
[36:12] working for the public service company
[36:14] and there was
[36:15] a a Mr.
[36:17] Bohannan the superintendent was a
[36:21] pastmaster
[36:22] mason I was a Baptist preacher Reverend
[36:26] Arie Kle from the Maple Street Methodist
[36:29] Church come in and then in come Father
[36:31] Halp and the Catholic priest. Well, can
[36:35] I quote what he said? All right. He said
[36:38] we should start a crap game. We're all
[36:40] here. Catholic priest said that. And so
[36:43] then he done something old that that
[36:46] started something rolling in my heart.
[36:49] He said on there, he draw three lines.
[36:51] He said, "Here's the Pennsylvania going
[36:53] down, Billy." That was me. He said,
[36:55] "Well, go down on that line. And here's
[36:57] another one, the southern." Said, "Mr.
[36:59] Clag here. I'll go down on that line.
[37:01] Here's another one over here." Said,
[37:02] "Yes, stay on your line if as long as
[37:05] you're pointing towards heaven." I
[37:06] thought that was pretty good for our
[37:08] priest. And he said, "Stay on your
[37:10] line." And that's right. As long as
[37:12] you're converted and believe on the Lord
[37:13] Jesus Christ, just keep moving on with
[37:15] all your heart and he'll lead you in the
[37:17] light. I believe that with
[37:21] all that's been so nice, the ladies with
[37:24] the music, the special singing,
[37:26] everything's been so fine. Then I guess
[37:29] they can't hear me, but the police
[37:32] that's been helping us out there getting
[37:34] in and out, parking the cars, they
[37:37] certainly done a wonderful job. Fine
[37:40] job. Everybody has been real fine. And
[37:43] we sure appreciate it. And it's our
[37:46] hopes and our prayers and our desires
[37:49] that we have did something or said
[37:52] something or you've seen God do
[37:54] something by us that'll strengthen your
[37:56] faith and it'll make you love Jesus more
[37:59] and you're sick that you'll get healed
[38:02] because that's our our simple heart
[38:05] sincere desire is that's what we're here
[38:08] for. And if we've achieved that by our
[38:11] coming, we're thanking God with all
[38:13] that's in our hearts. And now, if you're
[38:16] ever down around Jeffersonville there,
[38:17] while the little tabernacles at 8 and
[38:19] Penn Street, once in a while I'm in have
[38:21] services there or anywhere out in the
[38:23] meetings, let's meet together again and
[38:25] shake hands. And I hope to be here again
[38:27] next year, the Lord
[38:30] willing. Thank you. Thank
[38:34] you. Now, how many of you will pray for
[38:37] me while I'm out in the fields? That
[38:38] that's the main thing. God bless you.
[38:40] That's fine. You promise your prayers
[38:43] and that's that is my strength where I
[38:46] draw it from God is by the Holy Spirit.
[38:49] There's so many things I could say. Many
[38:51] of my friends from Jeffersonville this
[38:52] is here and from different parts. The
[38:55] Downings are here from down in
[38:57] Tennessee. I've never seen them but
[38:59] waved at him. Brother Welch Evan wife
[39:01] and family sure somewhere. I couldn't
[39:04] find them now. Brother Banks Wood, his
[39:07] father and mother and brother and all
[39:10] are converted Jehovah witnesses and
[39:13] they're here in the the meeting. And um
[39:16] Oh, I hear that brother Hickerson
[39:18] received the Holy Ghost last night. Oh,
[39:20] praise be to God. Him and his wife,
[39:22] Brother Collins, the Methodist preacher,
[39:25] his he his wife and his brother and and
[39:29] uh his wife all received the Holy Ghost.
[39:31] And oh, I tell you, things are just
[39:33] rolling on wonderfully. And we thank
[39:36] you, dear people, who was in the prayer
[39:37] rooms to help pray with these people. It
[39:40] means a lot to my church to be
[39:41] strengthened like that. Somebody told me
[39:43] that brother Wood and them had received
[39:45] the Holy Ghost also which was seeking
[39:46] for the baptism. I'm so thankful for
[39:49] that. May the Lord bless those brothers.
[39:52] I know there'll be a new something in
[39:53] their life. It'll be real. Amen.
[39:57] Now, we're going to pray for the sick.
[40:00] We don't want to keep you too long. We
[40:01] want you to go back to your church
[40:03] tonight. If you're visiting, uh, visit
[40:05] some of the churches. Brother David Dupl
[40:07] has just reported and said they had such
[40:10] a wonderful time at the place where they
[40:11] were at this morning. I run over to
[40:13] brother Sullivan's and we had a
[40:14] wonderful time over there with his
[40:16] congregation. This little brother here,
[40:18] Brother Pat Tyler, another one of my
[40:20] brothers and associate. Yeah. Brother
[40:22] Anthony from New York. A little
[40:26] um, are you Greek brother? All right.
[40:28] Italian. little Italian church in New
[40:31] York all around so many everywhere. I
[40:34] just couldn't call their names, but I I
[40:36] trust that God will richly bless you.
[40:38] Now, everyone that's here that isn't
[40:40] healed, let this be the hour. Let this
[40:43] be the time. Now, last night, there was
[40:45] a group of wheelchairs along here, and I
[40:49] was so much under the discernment. I I
[40:51] couldn't hardly see the congregation no
[40:53] more and almost fell off the steps out
[40:55] there going out. I kept feeling Billy or
[40:57] somebody hit me in the sides to leave.
[41:00] But I there was a a little um colored
[41:04] baby that I was very interested in right
[41:08] here. It's here. I'd saw what had
[41:10] happened to the baby, a mistake of a
[41:13] doctor that did the the damage from a
[41:17] shop. But um uh I believe that that
[41:21] child's going to be all right. That's
[41:24] right. And I I was so far out to I
[41:27] couldn't hardly call no more. If people
[41:29] will never know until I meet you over in
[41:31] that lamb what that does to me. You It's
[41:34] just hard brother and sister. You don't
[41:36] under just think Jesus of Nazareth. One
[41:39] woman touched his garment. He said that
[41:41] made him weak. Virtue went out of him.
[41:43] Is that right? And that was the son of
[41:46] God. How about me? A sinner saved by
[41:49] grace. And stand here and see it time
[41:51] after time after time. The only way that
[41:53] is because he promised the works that I
[41:56] do shall you also more than this shall
[41:59] you do for I go unto my father. I know
[42:01] it says greater but the writing
[42:03] translation from it is more more than
[42:05] this shall you do for I go to my father.
[42:08] Now before we read the father's
[42:11] word let us bow our heads for
[42:16] prayer. Our gracious and
[42:19] loving honorable and father, we come to
[42:25] thee just as humble as children could
[42:29] come. And we were giving our brethren
[42:32] and our friends thanks for all that they
[42:35] have did for us in this meeting. Now
[42:38] every one of us together with our heads
[42:40] and hearts bowed, we are thanking you,
[42:43] our loving
[42:44] father, for your goodness. For it was
[42:48] through you that all this has been
[42:51] accomplished. The afflicted has been
[42:53] healed. The sick has been healed.
[42:56] Sinners have come to you to be saved.
[43:01] And those who are saved has come and
[43:02] been filled with your spirit. Thou has
[43:05] not left one thing undone that we have
[43:07] preached. You have confirmed every word
[43:11] with signs following. We thank thee for
[43:14] it, Father. And we know that it's your
[43:16] will to heal everybody and to save
[43:20] everybody and to fill everyone with the
[43:23] Holy Spirit. And we pray, Father, if
[43:26] there's any year that's left out, may
[43:28] they realize at this hour that it is not
[43:31] your will that they be left out of
[43:33] anything that they have need of because
[43:35] you are here and willing and wanting and
[43:39] longing to give them the desire of their
[43:42] heart. For they are your children to
[43:45] whom you gave your life for, and you are
[43:47] ready and willing to help them.
[43:50] Bless the words that we
[43:52] read. And while we are speaking, let the
[43:57] blessed Holy Spirit take those words out
[44:00] across this audience and sank them down
[44:03] into every heart as they have need of.
[44:07] And when we are finished with the
[44:09] service this afternoon, or rather when
[44:12] you are finished with the service this
[44:14] afternoon, and we return to our homes at
[44:17] different places and different towns and
[44:20] cities and states and even different
[44:23] nations, may we say like those who came
[44:26] from Emmas that first Easter morning,
[44:30] did not our hearts burn within us as he
[44:34] talked to us along the way
[44:37] and
[44:37] we'll always give thee the praise,
[44:41] Father, for we ask it in the name of thy
[44:44] loving son, the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[44:48] Neither is there any water to drink. And
[44:51] Moses and Aaron went from the presence
[44:53] of the assembly unto the door of the
[44:56] tabernacle of the
[44:58] congregation. And they fell upon their
[45:01] faces, and the glory of the Lord
[45:04] appeared unto them. And the Lord spake
[45:06] unto Moses, saying, Take the
[45:09] rod, gather thou the assembly together,
[45:13] thou and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye
[45:16] unto the rock, before their eyes, and it
[45:21] shall give forth his water, and thou
[45:26] shalt bring forth water out of the rock.
[45:30] So thou shalt give the congregation and
[45:33] their beast
[45:36] drink. May the Lord bless the words of
[45:41] his
[45:45] Bible. It must have been a an awful hot
[45:51] morning. They had had no sleep through
[45:54] the night. They had gathered at a little
[45:58] oasis. All night long the cattle balled
[46:02] and the the horses knickered and the
[46:05] children cried and the people
[46:08] murmured no water to
[46:12] drink. And they were out in a desert
[46:15] alone.
[46:18] And they'd searched through all the
[46:20] springs around the place and all the
[46:23] springs that went dry and there was no
[46:27] water. Their sin had brought them into
[46:30] this
[46:31] condition. They had forgotten all that
[46:34] God had did to them and did for
[46:38] them and have went off to murmur against
[46:41] God and his
[46:43] prophet. And it had brought them out
[46:45] into this wilderness where it was a
[46:48] desert. No
[46:51] water, nothing for their
[46:53] children. No food to eat, no water to
[46:57] drink. It's a horrible thing when people
[47:01] sin. A very striking type of today in
[47:08] the world.
[47:10] Then we find also that they had easily
[47:13] forgotten that the God that
[47:16] had promised them to take them to the
[47:19] land had been the God that s gave all
[47:22] those signs and wonders and
[47:27] miracles. If we could stop, wish we
[47:30] could, but we can't pause on that for a
[47:33] few minutes.
[47:34] God makes a promise. Then he confirms
[47:38] that he's going to fulfill that promise
[47:40] by keeping all of his words and showing
[47:43] himself
[47:45] present. How beautiful that God is doing
[47:48] the same thing right here at this
[47:53] shitqua. But you see our we are on our
[47:56] road to the promised land. God promised
[47:59] to supply all their needs from Egypt to
[48:02] the promised land. God promised to
[48:04] supply all our needs until we reach
[48:06] reach the promised land. And there would
[48:10] not be any sickness among
[48:12] us if we'd kept God's
[48:15] promises. But we have sinned. What is
[48:18] sin?
[48:19] Disbelieved. Unbelief is the only sin
[48:22] there is. Drinking, smoking, gambling,
[48:26] committing adultery. That is not sin.
[48:29] That's the attributes of of unbelief.
[48:32] See, righteousness is the attributes of
[48:35] salvation. But people can quit smoking,
[48:38] drinking, and everything and still not
[48:40] be
[48:40] saved. So sin is a mark that the pe
[48:46] person that does it is not a believer.
[48:49] The Bible said, "He that believeth not
[48:51] is condemned already." So before you, if
[48:54] you never lied, stole, or done anything
[48:56] in your life, you're still a sinner to
[48:59] begin with. you're you don't have a
[49:02] chance outside of Christ. He is the way.
[49:07] And these people had got all together
[49:10] away from God and he had cut off their
[49:13] water supply and their food supply. And
[49:16] that's very similar of today that God
[49:20] has cut off the great blessings from the
[49:22] church that he promised the church that
[49:24] he would be with them. Listen, you be
[49:28] with us, even in us to the end of the
[49:32] way.
[49:34] The works that I do shall you do also.
[49:38] I'll never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
[49:42] I'll be with thee always, even unto the
[49:46] consummation all the way. Now, why isn't
[49:50] he in the church today that people talk?
[49:52] Where is that God of history, that God
[49:54] that rose up? He's only waiting for his
[49:57] people to come back to him and get
[49:59] right. Then you'll see the God of
[50:02] history come in when the people gets
[50:04] right. How easy they had forgotten that
[50:08] when the plagues was in Egypt that they
[50:10] were
[50:11] protected. When there was flies all over
[50:16] everything, there wasn't a fly around
[50:18] them. when lice filled all the beds, all
[50:22] the clothing and everything. There
[50:25] wasn't one uh bit of it on them. Frogs
[50:29] was in the cupboards and everything else
[50:31] all over the rest of the
[50:33] unbelievers. But they had been
[50:35] protected. God showing his mercy.
[50:41] Notice, and when that final and great
[50:45] night
[50:46] came, God said, "This is my final blow
[50:50] at
[50:52] Egypt. But before I can strike this
[50:55] blow, I've got to bring my children to
[50:58] protection."
[51:01] And there was a sacrificial lamb killed
[51:03] and the blood was put on the post the
[51:06] linels of the door and the congregation
[51:09] went under the
[51:11] blood. Remember that was the last plague
[51:15] that struck Egypt. And the last plague
[51:19] that striking the church today is the
[51:22] same as that was a spiritual death.
[51:26] Because as God led them literally, he
[51:29] leads us
[51:31] spiritually. And the last blow at the
[51:35] the enemy is death is striking and all
[51:39] from under the blood is dysfellowshipped
[51:42] by the Holy
[51:44] Spirit.
[51:46] Now therefore, we have a spiritual death
[51:50] in the churches.
[51:52] That's the last sign before the hour of
[51:55] deliverance is a sp a spiritual death.
[51:59] Did not Jesus say the same thing? They'd
[52:02] be heady, high-minded, lovers of
[52:04] pleasure more than lovers of God, truce
[52:06] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[52:09] despisers of those that are good, having
[52:11] a form of godliness,
[52:16] but would deny the power
[52:18] thereof from such turn away, the hour
[52:23] that we are now living, when the church
[52:26] world has become plagued and dying a
[52:29] spiritual death,
[52:32] But God protected
[52:35] them. And they had forgotten
[52:38] it. How quickly our Pentecostal
[52:43] believers are forgetting that too.
[52:47] That you were saved by his grace and
[52:51] filled with his spirit. This great
[52:53] tremendous dying time to the church.
[52:56] Don't forget that. that the God that
[52:58] gave you the Holy Spirit to live by and
[53:01] to make this journey is with you every
[53:03] step of the
[53:04] way. We just so quickly forget it. It's
[53:08] too bad. Now, how that God brought them
[53:12] out, how that in that great night he
[53:15] passed over them, the great Passover,
[53:19] and how he had done these great things
[53:22] for them. how then how they had be to
[53:26] grumble after they got out. They got out
[53:28] to the to the Dead Sea. God opened up a
[53:32] way when there was no other way. God
[53:35] became their way. That's the way I found
[53:38] it in my life. When I get to a place
[53:40] where there is no way, then Jesus makes
[53:43] a way where there is no way to be made.
[53:47] I am the way.
[53:50] I am the truth and the life. Now we find
[53:55] that God made a way when there was no
[53:58] way and delivered
[54:00] them. Now I hope you got on your
[54:03] spiritual jackets. Listen. And the
[54:08] uncircumcised meaning without the Holy
[54:10] Ghost. The uncircumcised. How many knows
[54:13] that the Holy Spirit is circumcision?
[54:15] You ever read your Bible? You circum
[54:18] Steven said in my message this morning
[54:20] told them priests and them you
[54:22] uncircumcised in the heart and ears you
[54:24] always resist the Holy Ghost like your
[54:26] fathers did. The Holy Ghost circumcises
[54:29] the heart. And now in the journey God
[54:33] promised to take care of them and he did
[54:36] take care of them and he never
[54:40] failed. And then when the unbelievers
[54:44] tried to impersonate them, they was
[54:47] drowned. And you've seen yourself people
[54:50] come in and try to impersonate or act
[54:52] like they got the Holy Ghost where you
[54:54] find out it isn't long till they're on
[54:56] the rubbish heap. That's right. Exactly
[54:58] right. You cannot impersonate it. It's
[55:01] got to be a genuine something you got
[55:04] yourself.
[55:06] You cannot come in and act like you're a
[55:08] Christian. You've got to be one. Yeah.
[55:10] And the only way you can be one is by
[55:12] birth. We've heard people come in and
[55:14] speak with tongues. First thing you
[55:16] know, find them out you're on the
[55:17] rubbish sheep. They didn't get the Holy
[55:18] Ghost. That's right. They got a
[55:20] confusion of language. They never The
[55:22] Holy Spirit makes a man what he is from
[55:23] his heart. Amen. He has godly love. Now,
[55:28] they had forgotten all of this. And this
[55:31] they left the
[55:33] great murmur with Moses and with God
[55:38] chatting, "Why did you bring us out
[55:40] here? Why do we have to stay here? I'd
[55:42] rather be back down in Egypt anytime.
[55:44] Why did we die down there? Let Pharaoh
[55:46] kill us. Be better being out here." If
[55:49] that isn't like the complaints of the
[55:50] church today, so easy they forget the
[55:53] hand of God. So easy they forgot it.
[55:57] Listen what taking place. Oh, it's
[56:00] tremendous. We'd rather die down there.
[56:02] Look, those people had left from eating
[56:06] onions and garlics of Egypt. And God had
[56:10] rained bread down out of heaven, angels
[56:12] food, and fed them with it. And they
[56:14] were still complaining.
[56:17] God has given the church angels food,
[56:20] Holy Spirit. And they still complain
[56:22] about something all the time.
[56:26] left onions and garlics to eat angels
[56:28] food that angels prepared in heaven and
[56:31] rain down on the food that they had
[56:33] eaten. And still they were complaining.
[56:35] They had left the old muddy rivers of
[56:37] the Nile drinking that old muddy water
[56:40] and was drinking from the spiritual rock
[56:43] of pure salvation water and was
[56:46] complaining about it. Yes. Always
[56:49] complain because a little hard time
[56:51] struck them. Oh, that just soon as you
[56:54] have your first trial, come in meeting,
[56:56] see the Holy Spirit, go back out and
[56:58] have a tummy ache and say, "Well, maybe
[56:59] I never got healed." Shame on
[57:01] you. Sure you got healed. If you believe
[57:04] it, your feelings has nothing to do with
[57:06] it. It's your faith is what we look at.
[57:09] That's what God sees is your faith, not
[57:10] your feelings. Jesus never did say, "Did
[57:13] you feel it?" He said, "Did you believe
[57:15] it?" That's the irony. But they left the
[57:18] boasting physicians of Egypt down there
[57:21] saying, "Oh, we're the doctors. Days of
[57:23] miracles has passed to be with the great
[57:26] physician." And 40 years journey,
[57:28] hundreds and thousands of little babies
[57:30] born, all kinds of sickness and old
[57:32] people. There wasn't a feeble one among
[57:35] them with that one great position.
[57:38] Hallelujah. And still complaining. They
[57:41] had left the place down there where the
[57:43] where they said the days of miracles is
[57:45] passed. That's where you left. You left
[57:48] those places that says the days of
[57:49] miracles are fast. They left that to be
[57:52] with the out there where signs and
[57:54] wonders follow the believer. And still
[57:57] they were complaining. Isn't that just
[58:00] like the people today? But instead of
[58:02] all that, in the face of all of that,
[58:05] when God seen the mercy for the people,
[58:08] Moses fell on his face, that prophet,
[58:10] and said, "Lord God, sure they've
[58:12] sinned, but here they'll give them
[58:15] another
[58:16] chance." What happened? God told him,
[58:19] "Rise up and go out there and speak to
[58:21] the
[58:22] rock and it'll bring forth its waters."
[58:26] Now, if that wasn't, wouldn't the carnal
[58:28] mind pick that up as a foolishness? What
[58:30] would the carnal mind do? Well,
[58:32] certainly the rock was the driest place
[58:34] in the wilderness. Well, if there's
[58:37] going to be any water, it would be in
[58:38] the spring, not up there on that rock.
[58:41] God does things vice versa sometime or
[58:43] what man thinks it's right. That's the
[58:45] reason man hasn't got a right to lead
[58:47] God's people. It takes the Holy Spirit
[58:49] to do it for a fil church. Certainly.
[58:53] Now, they say today if there's any
[58:55] divine healing and miracles, it would be
[58:56] in our Catholic church, being in our
[58:58] Baptist, being in our Methodist. But
[58:59] God's able of these stones to rise up
[59:02] children of Abraham.
[59:05] What did he do? The went to the most
[59:08] unliken place there could be the rock.
[59:11] That's the way today they say. Now what
[59:13] kind of place that healing going on at?
[59:15] Where them visions take place? It's a
[59:17] Pentecostal group. Ah, get away from
[59:19] there. This kind of thing like that God
[59:21] give you give it to our church. See, but
[59:23] that's what it is. What happened? Why
[59:25] wasn't there water? because our man-made
[59:28] springs have dried up. That's what's the
[59:30] matter today with the churches. Our
[59:32] man-made denominations and theology has
[59:34] dried up, but God still has a command to
[59:37] speak to the rock and it'll bring forth
[59:39] its
[59:40] water. Certainly, yes. Very foolish to
[59:45] go out there. It looks very foolish. Why
[59:47] would a man leave a great big place to
[59:49] come down and get amongst a bunch of
[59:51] what they call holy rollers? What's he
[59:53] doing? He's only obeying the word of
[59:56] God. That's what Moses did. He obeyed
[1:00:00] what God said do. He spoke to the rock
[1:00:03] regardless of how foolish it sounded or
[1:00:06] anything else. He spoke to the rock and
[1:00:09] the rock was to bring forth waters of
[1:00:11] life for them. Oh, the only thing we
[1:00:14] need to do today is just like it was
[1:00:16] then, is speak to the rock. No matter if
[1:00:20] all the springs have dried up, if
[1:00:22] everything else is lost and gone, the
[1:00:25] only thing we have to do is still
[1:00:27] continue and speak to the rock and the
[1:00:30] rock is still able to bring forth its
[1:00:32] waters. You believe that?
[1:00:35] Now, one time in the Bible now, we're
[1:00:39] having a little shower on the outside
[1:00:41] also. So just move in. Give a little
[1:00:44] vent especially on this side where the
[1:00:47] rains are coming from and it won't hurt
[1:00:51] anything. I'll speak to the rock and the
[1:00:56] rock shall bring forth his
[1:00:59] waters. Did you notice it? It t it will
[1:01:04] bring forth his personal pronoun his
[1:01:08] waters. What kinds of waters? waters of
[1:01:11] life. That's the kind it'll bring forth.
[1:01:14] God promised it and God would do it.
[1:01:18] Now, that's what's the matter today.
[1:01:21] When you have gone as far as you can go,
[1:01:24] if you search through every doctor's
[1:01:25] office there is and they still say
[1:01:28] there's nothing to be done for you, then
[1:01:30] I'll tell you, do like Moses did. Speak
[1:01:32] to the rock for it's still bringing
[1:01:34] forth it waters of salvation, divine
[1:01:37] healing, just as God promised. Only
[1:01:40] thing you have to do if the doctor says
[1:01:42] no, speak to the rock and it'll bring
[1:01:45] forth its waters. Now
[1:01:48] Hannah was turned out of her home. She
[1:01:51] had a little baby. The poor little
[1:01:53] fellow was dying. Why? She didn't know
[1:01:56] what to do with it. She didn't
[1:01:57] understand the the treatment of her
[1:02:00] mistress. What happened when they got
[1:02:03] this condition? Her little baby's
[1:02:05] tongue, little Ishmael's tongue was
[1:02:07] swelling out of him. She laid him under
[1:02:10] a bush and went out about a bow shot and
[1:02:13] fell down on her face and she spoke to
[1:02:16] the rock and the rock brought forth the
[1:02:18] waters and there was a spring basha
[1:02:21] which still stands today as an
[1:02:23] everlasting memorial that he still is
[1:02:26] God and you can speak to him and he'll
[1:02:28] bring forth whatever you have need of
[1:02:30] everything that he promised in the land.
[1:02:33] Sure.
[1:02:34] The Hebrew children want to stay true to
[1:02:37] God. One day because if they were true
[1:02:40] to God, the federal government find
[1:02:43] them. And they said they would throw
[1:02:45] them in the fiery furnace, which meant
[1:02:47] instant death. And when they started to
[1:02:49] throw them in the fiery furnace, they
[1:02:52] prayed all night, sought God. And as
[1:02:55] they throw them in the fiery furnace,
[1:02:56] they let them burn for about four or
[1:02:58] five hours. The king got wearied. He
[1:03:00] said, "Go open the door." And when they
[1:03:03] opened the door, they found the three
[1:03:05] Hebrew children sitting in there
[1:03:08] speaking to the rock that was able to
[1:03:10] lift them from the fire in the furnace.
[1:03:13] They were speaking to the rock and the
[1:03:16] rock had smothered the fire.
[1:03:19] Joshua one day he was bothered. God had
[1:03:21] led him across the sea and we are across
[1:03:25] the Jordan River. How was he going to
[1:03:27] take this land? How was he going to take
[1:03:29] Jericho? He was walking around one
[1:03:31] afternoon trying to figure out a way
[1:03:33] that he could descend the walls or
[1:03:36] something. After a while, he saw a man
[1:03:38] standing there. He pulled his sword and
[1:03:40] went to meet him. The man pulled his
[1:03:42] sword and come to meet him. He said,
[1:03:44] "Are you for us? Are you for our
[1:03:47] enemies?" He said, "I am the captain of
[1:03:50] the host of the
[1:03:51] Lord." Joshua spoke to the rock and the
[1:03:55] walls fell down.
[1:03:58] As long as we'll speak to the rock,
[1:04:00] there'll be a way made. Blind Barnameus
[1:04:03] hundreds of years later was sitting. Now
[1:04:05] look, hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:04:07] later, an old blind man sat for the wall
[1:04:10] dreaming of the days when Joshua shut
[1:04:13] the walls down with the power of God,
[1:04:15] sitting there in his blindness. And he
[1:04:17] said, "Oh, if I could only lived in that
[1:04:19] day, I would have seen him also." And
[1:04:23] less than a few minutes a man, old blind
[1:04:26] Barnabas, without hope, without any
[1:04:28] medical cure, without anything, he spoke
[1:04:31] to the rock and the rock gave him back
[1:04:34] his sight. When Jesus of Nazareth, which
[1:04:36] is the rock of the weary
[1:04:38] land, he spoke to him and he gave him
[1:04:41] back his sight. The woman at the well,
[1:04:45] she came up there one day to get a drink
[1:04:48] of water. Her life was condemning her.
[1:04:51] She wanted some water and she'd draw it
[1:04:53] down to get it. Somebody sitting there
[1:04:56] said, "Why don't you ask me for a drink?
[1:04:59] I'd give you water. You don't come here
[1:05:01] to
[1:05:01] draw." And she said, "Lord, give me this
[1:05:05] water forever more." She spoke to the
[1:05:07] rock. And when she got a drink of that
[1:05:09] water, she run into the city, saying,
[1:05:11] "Come see a man who told me the things
[1:05:13] that I learned." Isn't this the very
[1:05:16] Messiah? Sure, she was thirsty and she
[1:05:19] spoke to the rock. Martha, the sister of
[1:05:22] Lazarus. One day, one sickness had come
[1:05:25] to her home. Death had come to their
[1:05:28] home. Her brother was dead, buried,
[1:05:31] staking out in the grave. But she went
[1:05:34] out into the city, for she heard
[1:05:36] something, faith cometh by hearing. And
[1:05:39] when she got down there, she spoke to
[1:05:41] the rock. And the rock brought forth
[1:05:43] life again to her dead brother because
[1:05:46] she spoke to the rock. And the rock gave
[1:05:49] back the life of the dead
[1:05:51] boy. The disciples one night in a storm
[1:05:55] twice as horrible as this was out on the
[1:05:57] raging sea and all hopes is gone. They
[1:06:00] thought they'd be gone, but they happen
[1:06:03] to remember they had the rock on board.
[1:06:05] Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] They spoke to the rock
[1:06:11] and the rock gave forth its eternal life
[1:06:14] waters and he spoke to the winds and the
[1:06:16] waves and they obeyed him. They just had
[1:06:19] to speak to the
[1:06:22] rock. If you need joy, speak to the
[1:06:26] rock. If you need salvation, speak to
[1:06:29] the rock. If you need divine healing,
[1:06:32] speak to the rock.
[1:06:34] If you need the Holy Ghost, speak to the
[1:06:36] rock and he'll bring forth his waters,
[1:06:39] the waters of salvation. If you'll just
[1:06:42] speak to the rock. Anything you have
[1:06:44] need of, speak to the rock. The rock is
[1:06:48] just the same today as he ever was. He's
[1:06:50] still got eternal life. He's still got
[1:06:51] eternal peace. He's still got joy
[1:06:53] unspeakable and full of glory. He's
[1:06:55] still got divine healing. He's the same
[1:06:57] yesterday, today, and forever. The only
[1:06:59] thing the people need to do is speak to
[1:07:02] the rock. Amen. You believe that?
[1:07:06] Let's bow our heads and speak to the
[1:07:08] rock. Everybody in prayer.
[1:07:12] Heavenly Father, we come in the name of
[1:07:15] the rock.
[1:07:17] The rock in a weary land, the shelter in
[1:07:20] a time of storm. We pray, oh Lord God,
[1:07:24] that the rock will overshadow us with
[1:07:25] his power and mercy. That every sick
[1:07:28] person in here may be healed today. May
[1:07:31] they speak to the rock. Thou are men and
[1:07:34] women sitting here suffering with
[1:07:35] cancer. Some of them blind, some
[1:07:37] crippled. The doctor says there's no
[1:07:39] hope for them. Then let them speak to
[1:07:42] the rock. Moses without hope. They was
[1:07:45] in the wilderness where no water was.
[1:07:47] But they spoke to the rock. And the rock
[1:07:49] gave forth a gusher. And they all drank
[1:07:52] and they lived. Lord God, may we drink
[1:07:55] from that fountain today that never runs
[1:07:56] dry. Oh, in this bul land of salvation
[1:08:00] where we've been called out of Egypt's
[1:08:01] garlics and steak pots into this great
[1:08:04] wonderful place where it's due the land
[1:08:06] where the rock lays eating angels food
[1:08:08] and drinking from a fountain that never
[1:08:10] runs dry. God in heaven grant this
[1:08:13] blessing to the people. May they see
[1:08:15] today that the rock still lives. The
[1:08:18] rock resurrected from the dead. The rock
[1:08:20] is in the land today. He's a shelter in
[1:08:23] the time of storm. and may the people
[1:08:26] run into it and are safe. Grant it,
[1:08:28] Lord. Hear the prayers of your servants
[1:08:30] as we pray and call upon you in the name
[1:08:33] of your son Jesus Christ.
[1:08:37] Amen. Oh
[1:08:39] my. Speak to the
[1:08:42] rock. If you're sick, speak to the rock.
[1:08:46] If the doctor says, "I can't do no more
[1:08:48] for you," then speak to the
[1:08:50] rock. If the church says, "If you shout,
[1:08:53] "My church, I'll turn you out." Then
[1:08:55] speak to the
[1:08:57] rock. If the denomination wants to
[1:09:00] excommunicate you, speak to the rock.
[1:09:02] Amen.
[1:09:05] When death comes stealing in your room,
[1:09:07] speak to the rock. You'll make a way and
[1:09:10] divide the waters of Jordan as he did
[1:09:12] for them, and you'll walk over on dry
[1:09:14] land. Speak to the rock. That's all you
[1:09:18] have to do. You don't have to smite it
[1:09:20] no more. Just speak to it. Just call on
[1:09:22] his name. Whatever you ask the father in
[1:09:23] my name, that I'll do. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:09:28] Speak to the rock and it'll bring forth
[1:09:30] its waters. Speak to it. Look at others
[1:09:33] speaking to it. You without the Holy
[1:09:35] Ghost, look at them. It spoke to it.
[1:09:36] Methodist, Jehovah Witness, Baptist, all
[1:09:39] such speak to the rock. The rock's no
[1:09:42] respector of person, no respect of time.
[1:09:45] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:47] forever, and will ever more be the same
[1:09:51] rock that's promised to supply all we
[1:09:53] have need from here to the promised
[1:09:55] land. Amen. You believe that?
[1:10:00] Give out prayer cards.
[1:10:03] Huh? Billy said to give out prayer
[1:10:06] cards. All right, let's find out. You
[1:10:10] sick people, you come this
[1:10:12] afternoon. Come doing this and
[1:10:15] conditioned to speak to the rock. I'm
[1:10:17] not the rock. I'm this is outlet.
[1:10:22] See, our ministries are just outlets
[1:10:25] where the it's a pipe where the water
[1:10:28] flows through. Don't glorify the pipe.
[1:10:31] Glorify the water that you're getting
[1:10:32] out of the
[1:10:35] pipe. For the water comes from the
[1:10:37] fountain. glorify the water.
[1:10:41] Then remember, it couldn't be me that
[1:10:44] healed. The pipe doesn't give you a
[1:10:45] drink. The stem that comes through, it
[1:10:47] doesn't give the drink. It only supplies
[1:10:49] the water. You drink from that rock,
[1:10:52] that smitten rock that's already been
[1:10:56] smoked. Moses smoked that rock with the
[1:10:59] judgment rod of God. And the judgments
[1:11:01] of God smoked the rock, Christ Jesus.
[1:11:04] And when Moses spoke the rock, there was
[1:11:06] a cliff in the rock. Always was a cliff
[1:11:09] in that rock from that time forth. And
[1:11:11] when Christ was smitten, there was a
[1:11:13] cliff in the rock. Out of that rock,
[1:11:15] they found honey. When they were hungry,
[1:11:18] they found water. When they were
[1:11:20] thirsty, for it was a smitten rock. That
[1:11:22] same rock today has water and honey and
[1:11:25] abundance of life, joy unspeakable, full
[1:11:27] of glory, divine healing powers of God
[1:11:29] to set a man free from sin.
[1:11:46] Amen. How many can say praise the Lord?
[1:11:49] Thank God for his word. Let's give the
[1:11:50] Lord a hand of praise.
[1:11:54] Amen. Amen. What a wonderful atmosphere
[1:11:56] to call on God to hear and answer our
[1:11:59] prayer. You know, he was smitten at
[1:12:02] Calvary 2,000 years ago, our Lord and
[1:12:06] Savior, and he was wounded for our
[1:12:08] transgressions and all of our
[1:12:10] iniquities. Whatever we have need of, we
[1:12:14] just bring that to him tonight and speak
[1:12:17] to him, the Lord Jesus Christ, and he
[1:12:20] will answer your prayer. How many
[1:12:22] believe that? Tonight, we're going to go
[1:12:25] to the Lord in prayer. This is our
[1:12:26] prayer meeting tonight and we'll call on
[1:12:29] God to hear and answer those requests.
[1:12:32] Um please remember Sharon Pashko
[1:12:36] um the granddaughter Jessica she will be
[1:12:41] undergoing tests for a complicated
[1:12:44] physical
[1:12:45] issue. God bless you. I think that's
[1:12:48] from the Kings. Remember this Jessica,
[1:12:51] sister Sharon's
[1:12:53] granddaughter. Also, Brother Kim's
[1:12:57] grandson is in the
[1:13:00] NICU. He's been there for 10 days. He
[1:13:03] ingested something. There's something in
[1:13:05] his lungs or that they're trying to work
[1:13:07] out there and there's no end in sight.
[1:13:10] They they don't think or they're just
[1:13:12] they haven't figured it out. So, he
[1:13:14] asked for the prayer request. Amen. So,
[1:13:18] we'll go to the Lord for brother Kim
[1:13:20] Dean Wall's grandson. Was there a
[1:13:24] request here tonight that someone would
[1:13:26] like to make known? Um, yes, Sister
[1:13:29] Heather.
[1:13:36] Oh,
[1:13:37] okay. Sister Deborah McGinty. Oh, she's
[1:13:40] here in the back there. So, we'll keep
[1:13:42] her in prayer. Good to see you, Sister
[1:13:45] Deborah. Praise the Lord.
[1:13:47] We'll pray for her and uh someone else.
[1:13:50] Sister
[1:13:57] your
[1:14:06] niece.
[1:14:08] He's fallen. Okay. We'll pray for Elijah
[1:14:12] for his eye. There's someone else that
[1:14:14] had a request. Yes, brother.
[1:14:23] Your brother, brother Josh's brother,
[1:14:25] Brandon has some chest pains. We'll pray
[1:14:28] for him. Brother George's family was
[1:14:31] they had some stomach bug, I think,
[1:14:33] coming from Canada. and they're probably
[1:14:36] weary in their body from traveling.

[1:37:24] That hand clapping song. Jesus has a
[1:37:28] table spread where the saints of God are
[1:37:31] fed. Come and dine, the master
[1:37:34] calleth. Jesus has a table spread where
[1:37:39] the saints God are fed. He invites his
[1:37:43] chosen people. Come and dine.
[1:37:51] faith and supplies our every

[1:38:18] multitude, turn the water into wine to
[1:38:23] the hungry, call it now, come and
[1:38:28] die. And the disciples came to land,
[1:38:33] thus obeying Christ's command. The
[1:38:37] master called to them, come and die.
[1:38:43] There they found their heart's desire.
[1:38:47] Bread and fish upon the fire. The sea
[1:38:51] satisfies the hungry every time. Can we

[1:39:50] Just clap those hands.
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:40:03] table all the time. All the time. He who

[1:40:14] the hungry, call it now. Come and
[1:40:19] die. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:40:21] praise. Brother Jonathan, why don't you
[1:40:23] come and dismiss us in a word of prayer?
[1:40:26] just come forward my brother.
[1:40:29] Yes, he was here and then he was gone
[1:40:31] and then I didn't see him for months and
[1:40:33] months and then he called me today. So,
[1:40:35] it's good to see him again. God bless
[1:40:38] you. Amen. God bless you.
[1:40:45] Amen. May I say something?
[1:40:52] [Music]
[1:40:54] I come to
[1:40:56] America in
[1:40:59] 20
[1:41:02] 23 in
[1:41:05] February in Tucson,
[1:41:09] Arizona. And
[1:41:11] u I have been at Tucson
[1:41:15] Tabernacle and I've been introduced to
[1:41:18] this man
[1:41:20] I left last year. I went to
[1:41:27] Chicago. When I was in
[1:41:30] Chicago, a
[1:41:32] pastor invited me to preach to some
[1:41:37] place.
[1:41:38] [Music]
[1:41:40] But since last
[1:41:42] year, and this is the message I'm
[1:41:45] directing to the
[1:41:47] pastor, I have been burdened so
[1:41:51] much because of the things that have
[1:41:54] happened in
[1:41:57] America.
[1:41:59] America
[1:42:01] ministers, they have turned a corner.
[1:42:07] ministers. They have now
[1:42:10] said this
[1:42:14] man, this
[1:42:17] man is no longer
[1:42:20] needed in their
[1:42:23] churches to be
[1:42:28] quoted. And when I was in Chicago there,
[1:42:32] that minister called me to
[1:42:35] preach. My message that I left in
[1:42:38] Chicago was the message
[1:42:43] revival. You deny him.
[1:42:48] You have a
[1:42:49] form that you are a believer of this
[1:42:52] message but you have denied the
[1:42:57] power. Without
[1:43:00] him this
[1:43:01] world will be burning
[1:43:05] today. That is Malachi chapter 4.
[1:43:11] To deny him, it is also to deny the
[1:43:18] message. To be gathered like this here
[1:43:22] and to have a
[1:43:24] pastor. I want to come to a
[1:43:27] church where one
[1:43:31] day the pastor of a
[1:43:34] church leaves this pulpit and sits in
[1:43:38] the
[1:43:39] congregation to listen to the
[1:43:45] voice because without this
[1:43:49] voice we are denomination.
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:43:56] I'll say it because I said it. I come
[1:44:01] from
[1:44:02] Chicago. I go to a
[1:44:05] brother and I say, "My
[1:44:08] brother, this that you have started
[1:44:11] doing at your
[1:44:12] church, you have denied the headship.
[1:44:19] No minister, brother Israel, and I'm
[1:44:22] talking to
[1:44:25] you. There is no
[1:44:27] minister in our
[1:44:30] generation that can stand in the
[1:44:33] pit and start reading from this
[1:44:37] Bible speaking to the congregation the
[1:44:40] knowledge that can surpass the
[1:44:45] prophet. no
[1:44:49] minister because this Bible was a closed
[1:44:57] book. This Bible we didn't know. I come
[1:45:01] to know him when I was 20 years in my
[1:45:04] father's church. In my father's church
[1:45:06] they baptized us in titles. In my
[1:45:09] father's church they believe that before
[1:45:10] somebody preaches he must go and stud. I
[1:45:13] was supposed to go to England and study
[1:45:15] for 3 years then become a
[1:45:17] pastor. But when this Bible was
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:23] opened, now we know how to receive the
[1:45:27] Holy
[1:45:28] Ghost. I asked the brother, "Are you
[1:45:32] going to teach your
[1:45:33] church about William
[1:45:37] Brennan?" He says, "I don't want to put
[1:45:39] a man before the people." said but when
[1:45:42] you read the book of Corinthians who
[1:45:44] wrote
[1:45:45] it if you say you are not going to put
[1:45:49] man a man before the people but the book
[1:45:51] of Corinthians was written by Paul
[1:45:56] and God tells Joshua God tells Israel
[1:46:00] and I'm talking to brother Israel I'm
[1:46:02] sorry I'm talking to you my
[1:46:05] brother you cannot take away the message
[1:46:08] from the church and expect a revival
[1:46:13] That's why you go to churches where they
[1:46:15] don't respect the prophet. It is like
[1:46:17] people are
[1:46:19] dead. I said it in Chicago
[1:46:23] there. There is no baptism in churches.
[1:46:26] It is all recycling odd believers.
[1:46:29] People come from Tennessee, they come to
[1:46:31] church. People come from Chicago, they
[1:46:33] come to church. And you call them
[1:46:34] believers. No, brother. We need to
[1:46:37] baptize the
[1:46:38] people. And the only way we can baptize
[1:46:41] the people is to take this message and
[1:46:44] tell it to the people and the people
[1:46:46] repent and the people come to the to the
[1:46:48] church and then there will be joy in
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:55] heaven. I called a pastor last
[1:46:58] week. I said I want to come to church.
[1:47:02] give me the address because I know
[1:47:04] brother Israel's church is there in
[1:47:07] broadest there and from my place to that
[1:47:10] place is about 15 20 minutes I say okay
[1:47:14] I'm knocking off at 6:00 let me just go
[1:47:17] attend here so I got the address I
[1:47:21] didn't go that Wednesday today I said
[1:47:23] I'm going I knock off I drive to that
[1:47:27] place there is no service
[1:47:31] today. So I said I don't know Lord
[1:47:35] whether brother Israel will pick up my
[1:47:37] phone. I'm outside the fence and I say
[1:47:40] Lord I don't know whether this man will
[1:47:42] pick up my phone. And I call two rings.
[1:47:45] He says hi brother Jonathan. I said give
[1:47:48] me the address to
[1:47:51] church. And when I walk into the church,
[1:47:56] I see the picture of the
[1:47:59] Lord by
[1:48:01] testimony. And I see the pillar of fire
[1:48:05] by
[1:48:06] testimony hanging before the
[1:48:09] congregation. That's what I've been
[1:48:11] brought. That's how I've been brought
[1:48:14] up. I said, "Pastor, why don't you hang
[1:48:17] the picture of the prophet in your
[1:48:18] church?" He says, "His is man worship.
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:22] But you hanging the picture of your
[1:48:24] grandfather who was even a witch maybe
[1:48:25] when he died in the
[1:48:28] house. Oh, I don't want to preach. Okay,
[1:48:31] I want to pray. But I want to
[1:48:34] say, Pastor
[1:48:37] Israel, may God bless your ministry.
[1:48:45] Brother, if you are going to continue on
[1:48:48] that trajectory of this
[1:48:51] message, there will be revival in this
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:49:00] church.
[1:49:02] So I want to declare to you before the
[1:49:07] church today. I have made this church to
[1:49:10] be my home
[1:49:12] church. When you don't see me here, I am
[1:49:17] working. Tell your neighbor that if you
[1:49:20] don't see brother Jonathan here, then
[1:49:21] he's
[1:49:22] working. Tell your neighbor, "Brother,
[1:49:25] if you don't see me here, I'm
[1:49:34] working. You can't change
[1:49:38] me." No, brother. You can't change me.
[1:49:41] 37 years
[1:49:44] 37 years now I have been following
[1:49:49] this that voice has kept me I am
[1:49:55] weak I am a sinner saved by the grace of
[1:49:59] God tomorrow I will sin tomorrow I'll
[1:50:02] make
[1:50:03] mistakes but that
[1:50:06] voice may it continue to remain in my
[1:50:11] soul until he
[1:50:14] comes. Let's bow our heads and
[1:50:18] pray. Heavenly
[1:50:22] Father, what a day.
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:43] Do we hear the voice
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:52] Lord which has kept
[1:50:56] us to find a man to find a
[1:51:00] brother that is still respecting the
[1:51:05] headship of this message.
[1:51:09] today.
[1:51:10] Lord, bless brother Israel.
[1:51:14] Father, may he stand
[1:51:17] true. May he be
[1:51:19] there even if he remains alone in
[1:51:25] Arizona. Watch over this
[1:51:29] man to bring us the
[1:51:31] voice of Malachi 4.
[1:51:35] You sent him to
[1:51:37] us too soon has been the bedroom of
[1:51:41] Jehovah in this
[1:51:44] message. It is in Arizona
[1:51:47] here where you wanted to come and live.
[1:51:50] There is a house Lord behind there. He
[1:51:54] shifted all his trophies to come and
[1:51:57] live in that house. It was not in your
[1:52:00] plan
[1:52:01] father. You took the messenger away.
[1:52:06] But we have the voice
[1:52:09] today. Forgive us our sins and our
[1:52:13] trespasses that we hold to this voice,
[1:52:17] to these
[1:52:19] words until you come.
[1:52:23] Lord, thank you for the message
[1:52:27] today and the prayers of your children.
[1:52:31] The pastor read prayer requests
[1:52:34] here. The messenger says just speak to
[1:52:37] the
[1:52:40] rock.
[1:52:42] Father, bless our driving back
[1:52:46] home. Bless the service that is coming
[1:52:49] on Sunday.
[1:52:52] Bless the saints that are holding on to
[1:52:56] this
[1:52:58] voice, ministers that you are
[1:53:01] raising. Let them see the importance of
[1:53:04] the voice of the
[1:53:07] messenger. Thank you, Father. We love
[1:53:10] you
[1:53:12] tonight. In the blessed name of Jesus
[1:53:14] Christ, Father, we
