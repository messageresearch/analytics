to come even to the table of the Lord tonight but by your grace and your mercy and supreme and ultimate sacrifice you made a way for us to come Lord we appreciate that tonight may you bless us as we walk forward into the good things you've prepared for us we pray and we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints so good to be in the house of the Lord with you we welcome each of you to the house of the Lord our visitors and friends and Saints of the most high God Amen God bless you richly we had um quite a long trip here coming back from thank you musicians from Florida to lay arest my good friend brother Wesco and uh just a really tremendous service that they had there to see another servant of the Lord cross over like that and so we um were part of that uh a small part of the service there on Friday and then Saturday and we took a flight late Saturday night and we got into Phoenix the we hours of the morning this morning had a service this morning with the Saints in Mesa and had a wonderful time I trust that they are the Lord will bless them I believe they're on the service tonight and tonight we're coming to the table of the Lord and um another great subject from his word that we trust will be a blessing to each and every one of you amen aren't you glad to be a Christian thanking the lord for Thanksgiving uh sometimes we just survive it you know because we eat more than we should I did anyways and my family came down 10 of my family members from California came down and which hasn't happened ever before and so that was wonderful but we had to turn and leave that Friday which is a little difficult but we thank the Lord for that thank the Lord for each of you and so let's go right to the word before we go to the table of the lord we ask you to stand to take a scripture reading in Romans chapter 7 and Matthew Chapter 5 Romans 7 as we know brother random takes this message and preaches the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and as I told the church this morning in Mesa first of all brother random where did you get that title from it is inspired all all the way through and when you go deeper into that message as it unfolds so many truths that we have today were just opened up right in that little series there in streetport and it's beautiful really really rich I heard it again I've never heard it the way I've heard it these last few times and it's just a blessing to me so Romans 7 verse 1 no know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though should be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be what married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God Amen and so the subject there in that if you continue down to verse 6 is speaking of adultery but the Apostle Paul brings it deeper than just the physical adultery he's talking about how the man and how the law has no dominion over him if he's dead and so we'll take one more scripture as Jesus opens up this subject to us more in Matthew chapter 5 verse 27 Jesus speaking ye have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever lookth up on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the reading of the word once again we ask your blessings upon the hearing and the speaking we ask in jesus' name amen God bless you you may be seated married to Christ the word that's the title of the message married to Christ the word and the subject is the invisible Union so quickly and briefly here how many of you were raised in denomination Nation or organization or come through that system a number good hand number that were raised in that and so maybe you you all can help me with this too I was raised in church my whole life I never had this scripture expounded to me like how brother Brandon brings it out that when you look and you lust you have committed the crime in fact in the world many people would say I was just looking I was just looking and so um but Jesus here makes it clear he takes what adultery is and he raises up but I say unto you now he's quoting in the laws of Moses Thou shalt not commit adultery it's in Exodus it's in Leviticus it's in Deuteronomy Thou shalt not commit Thou shalt not commit adultery and here he is re quoting it you have heard them say of old times but I say unto you he that lookth and lusteth hath committed adultery already in his heart so God bless you Saints there in Phoenix this morning uh just bear with me as we review just a little bit because they heard some of this this morning so if you just uh meditate on the scripture there Romans chapter 7 alone verses 1-6 you'll get this out of the text along with the message in ible Union uh first our first birth is a type of our first nature the carnal man it is also a type of our first marriage with the world the carnal man this is how this is what this scripture how Paul is playing with it and also brother brandom is bringing that first marriage and it's clear that we must die to this first marriage or our first birth birth that's why we need the new birth and be remarried to Christ weere the scripture there all believers that are a part of the Bride are married to Christ so there's no single people in this message amen that are in the word okay not not everybody that follow the message you understand but if you're a part of the Bride you're are married to someone and that someone is he who raised from the dead which is the word and so with this marriage like any other marriage we can make this statement that all flirting and relationships outside of the word is adulterous now we're living in age of adultery first Peter tells us that their eyes are full of adultery I mean the advertisements the um everything that you see going on it's motivated by you know the act of adultery sex sinful fornication strip tees all of that to advertise what they're doing it's an age of that so you don't even have to imagine the way a man or a woman is dressed they show you everything there's no imagination to it it's placed right before you you just looking at them it's like you did something wrong I mean but um Jesus makes it clear if you look and you lust you commit you commit um adultery and so this this beautiful message that we have received as the prophet of God brings to us out of the message the invisible Union of the bride of Christ and he says this and this is where I got the title in invisible Union paragraph number 175 and he says this here how can a preacher goes out here to a seminary and looks at acts 238 and sees that there's not a person in the Bible ever baptized in those titles and then still say he's pregnated with the word of God he's telling you a lie he's sold his birthrights he's committed adultery against the very thing that he said he is put away in divorce God is going to have a virtuous church just exactly a bride the Bible said the word is not in you the the word is not in you so what kind of children are you bearing pregnated denominational there's been no death to separate you from your first lover amen what will the Joneses think if I go to crying and speaking in tongues what will they think if I'm re-baptized what a nonsense are you married to the Joneses or are you married to the church or are you married to Christ the word now who are you married to okay who are you married to we're all married to Christ the word and that is our headship that's our leadership tonight we are married to Christ the word now brother brand goes deeper in this message and I uh uh I want to the Brethren there and to to you know if you take the message there and you listen to it how he types A woman with the church and he talks about how she's given this sacred Trust of motherhood of Womanhood of virtue motherhood and um her her Womanhood that she God gives her that and then he says this in paragraph 101 as he crosses that over to the church and he's talking about the woman through this message he says I want you to keep the church in mind with this and so as you go back and listen to the message as the Lord would lead you I believe you'll really get a deeper understanding that this isn't about it's harder for the Sisters than it is for the brothers no no no no no it's hard for everybody when you really look at that every one of us have to give an account for our marriage and the faithfulness to who we're married to then it's much deeper than some carnal Affair who's dressing right and who's not it goes so much deeper than that Jesus brought it deeper he says if you look and you lust um you've committed adultery you say brother isra I didn't take the second look well you didn't have to because your First Look was so long you saw everything you needed to see and so that's that's between you and God now now if we all hanging out we're brothers we walking up wherever we're going and we're fellowshipping at the restaurant and I might not I might not be able to see what you're doing in your mind but God sees you and you might not be able to see what I'm thinking in my heart in my mind but God sees me and if in your heart you look and you lust Jesus said you've committed it already where in your heart so it's so much deeper than what you see me or catch me doing this you can't catch but God can and he sees it so much deeper God bless you so here the prophet of God brings this one-on-one invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says what a sacred trust amen what a responsibility to a woman now you see why she's a type of of the church which has the same responsibility as a woman has a sick responsibility to Motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has I've read this quote many many times for you and it still means the same thing that it that it says on the tape it is a sacred responsibility not just a responsibility it is a sacred responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ now the word is a bleeding word and the word that we have is word that bled and died for us it's not just Jesus the man with sandals on with his lovely face and the image that we see here as a man the characters of who he is just beyond any other Mortal being and many times that image we have in our head and many times the denominations they have the image of the lovely Lord Jesus but they do not connect that image with his word and his word is really who he is and we're married to the word above anything else now a woman is married to her husband yes he's the head of her yes but above her husband is still the word if that husband wants his wife to do something that's contrary to the word if she's a Christian she'll take what the word says above anything that's wrong can I get a witness that's the truth because Christ really is who we are married to and so Ephesians chapter 5 let's turn there quickly and see this washing of the Water by the word verse 21 it's talking about submitting yourselves one to another wives submit yourselves to your own husband goes down that the husband is ah head of the wife as Christ is to the body and to the church verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that verse 26 that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so the word is what washes you you know that song we love to sing it what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus which blood are we talking about are we talking about the literal blood well the literal blood we don't know where that is I wasn't there 20 th years ago to actually touch the literal blood or see the literal blood but where is the blood at the blood is the life and the life is in his word the word of God is what cleanses us it's when the word comes forth and you hear it and you do what it says then that's literally what cleanses you it's not a theories it's like Lord cleanse me from my sins yes he sends you his word and his word heals you it delivers you it changes the things that you do because the word says it here and you do what the word says amen so this is very clear in the message pardon 1963 the prophet of God says this I'm sorry not that we'll take the invisible Union of the bride of Christ paragraph 273 and he says this what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word unbelief in God which is the word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies amen standing ready think your garments Washed by the Water of the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you are washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word makes your mind and heart stayed on God and on his word how many thank God for the word the word washes you the word cleanses you I think it's in Psalms it says how can a young man cleanse himself by taking heed to his word according to Thy word and the scriptures tells us in Ephesians 5 that he washed Us by the washing of the Water by the word now brother bam makes a strong statement about these prostitutes and he's talking in in reference to the other Church and to the false churches strong statement very strong language but it's still the truth the Bible is written that way and it's the immoral immorality of a church that causes it to wear those kind of labels just like a lady that is living untrue there's labels that she would wear by the actions of her life and it's not nice to think of it it but it's a reality that's what it is and when the scripture talks about the uh harlots and Revelations there 17 and 19 talking about um the mother of harlots is talking about churches and brother Brandon brings that so clear to us um that that that's a type of the church now you have to keep the spiritual side in mind because sometimes many times we just focus on the natur natural and we're we're looking at the way somebody is dressed in church maybe somebody looks worldly but really it goes much deeper than what somebody looks like on the outside it's so much deeper um we could show you and prove to you that inside of your heart you can be right and your outside still be looking pretty tore up but it's still a hard question and God is the only one that knows that the moment a heart is made right in the eyes of God they are right I don't care what they're wearing I don't care what their hair looks like don't care how worldly how many whatever they got on them when that heart is made right they are right before the sight of God amen amen and so we we we we so much on that we look on the outside so much but this is really an inner and in the message brother bam takes the message pardon and he says this and just getting into the denomination and I got 10 more 10 or 15 more minutes and then we'll close okay thank you Sean paragraph 51 now from Adam until now I want you to get this tonight from Adam until now man has tried to make his own substitute he's tried his best to do something a little better than what God did it then and that's just natural in man man is always trying to better something to make it a different way he wants to inject his own ideas into the plan of God and that's why we stand tonight separated the Christian people of the world by barriers by denominational barriers does this because that man has injected his own idea into God's plan from Adam until now as I've said it's been that way Adam expressed me man's thinking in the Garden of Eden when he made himself a fig Leaf apron to face God it's something that he did himself and from and from fig leaves he's tried educations Towers cities Idols civilization denomination but it ever Remains the Same God only accepts his subjects under the blood that's all education has totally failed more education we get further we get from each other denomination has totally fail we draw lines and barriers and each one trying to get that denomination higher than the other and it breaks Fellowship civilization has merely brought about confusion cities towers and what more has all failed and God's plan Still Remains the Same under the blood and we know that the blood is the word is that right the word bled for us the word died for us the word is what cleanses us the word is my husband the word is my headship is that what the scripture says it says that we're married to him who raised from the dead that's who we're married to this evening now go a little bit further in the exposition of the perrian church age here's what is written in that church age book and he makes this statement when any man turns from the word of God and joins a church instead of receiving the holy spirit that man dies dead that is what he he is don't join a church don't get into organizations and get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or your dead read that again it says don't get into organization and get taken up with Creeds and tradition or anything that takes the place of the word and the spirit or you're dead it's all over you're dead eternally separated from God that is what happened in every age sense God delivers the people they come out by the blood Sanctified by the word walk through the waters of baptism and get filled with the spirit but after a while the first love cools off and someone gets the idea that they ought to organize in order to preserve themselves and make a name for themselves and they organize themselves right back in the second generation and sometimes even before them they no longer have the spirit of God just a form of worship they are dead they have hybridized themselves with Creed and form and there is no life in them we stop right there sometimes we feel like we need to help the word or protect the word by hiding this part or not preaching on this part or making it more acceptable to the masses but God sent his word exactly the way he wanted it to come and he uses the people that he wanted to use you think well God why would you use a seventh grade education the grammar is not the greatest Southern uh know you know Southern language and just all of the other you know he had all the scholars of the day there some very smart people God could have used in this day why would he purposely use a seventh grade educ ation a nons schooled man a poor man at that do you think that was random or was that really on purpose that was on purpose my friend and we know that when God sends his word he sends his word so that we would not rest in the word of men but we'll rest in the power of God it's the power of God that saves you it's not your intellection it's not your intellectual it's not your ability to argue the Scriptures it has nothing to do with how smart you are but my faith rests in the power of God the Apostle Paul was a very smart man very smart man but when he came to the church he didn't come with great big words he came in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost so that your faith would only rest in that Amen in the the power of God what does the scripture say about that Psalm 68:35 says oh God Thou Art terriable out of thy holy places the god of Israel he is he that giveth strength and power unto his people Blessed Be how many need some power it ain't coming in the gym we're running three miles a day how many need some power that power comes from on high that power comes from the source of power that power gives you the grace and the power to overcome the world that comes from godj 1 Corinthians 1:17 says Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect for look at Verse 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us unto me when I heard the gospel cross being preached that's the power that saved me that's the power that delivered us that delivers the church it's the preaching of the cross the church ain't preaching the cross it's not preaching the gospel that's right but unto us which are saved it is the power of God 1 Corinthians 2 verse number three and I was with you in weakness and fear and much trembling and my spee my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and a power he demonstrated it that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God you know some people will try to take this message and make it about some man's intellect something that you got to prove you got to argue you got to prove everything that he said is it actually happened you can prove it online you got to be able to show them that brother B was telling the truth you know the the message speaks for itself God speaks for God doesn't need any of my help doesn't need your help just say what it says and it will do what it said it will do in the life of a prostitute or a religious man when the gospel of the Cross is preached that is the power that saves any of us any individual now 2 Corinthians 1 Corinthians 4:20 says for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power 2 Corinthians 13: 3-5 since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me which to you word is not weak but is mighty in you for though he was crucified through weakness yet he lived by the power of God for we also are weaken him but we shall live with him by the power of God Amen we need this power verse five goes with the service tonight examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your ownselves know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reates Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edge sword piercing even to the dividing the suer of the soul and the spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart neither is there any creature that's not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open his his eyes the unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do that word power in the Greek is dynamus it means Force it's inherent power it's used as strength even in violence it means Mighty power residing in something the SC scriptures talk about in different places Old Testament and New it's power to perform the Miracles power in riches power in wealth power in numbers power in war those some of those little Wars and little fights and little battles with Samson and David H was outnumbered but they had the power of God on their side what about little shamgar shamgar jumped out of the window brother bam said said they been come coming taking his corn every year and he you know he would hide his his wheat in the wine press there and those Philistines come to take his corn and his wheat hard-earned labor hard earned earn dollars his wealth come to you know being stolen once again and then something come over him and he realized that he was a son of Abraham he was a child of God then the Revelation struck him don't need an army don't need to train to fight all I need is the power of God brother M says he took an ox gold he looked out the window saw them coming said he grabbed the ox gold and jumped out of the window and beat 600 Philistines it probably 800 he just stopped at 600 the rest stopped coming I mean when y'all going to figure it out this man ain't going to lose 100 fell 200 fell 300 fell he's all number 400 or 500 a smart man would be like you know what leave this crazy man alone let's get back let's get back home and and be able to tell the story but I'm not going to go heads up with a man that just whipped 400 500 oh my what did he have behind him brother Joe what did he have behind him brother Sean what did he have with him he had the power of God and that's the power that we live by and the preaching of the Cross is what delivers us with the power of God amen amen this is the word that we're married to is that right amen so the prophet brings this in let me finish this quote in the seven Church ages the exposition the pergan church age he says this here they are there they're hybridize themselves with Creed and form and there is no life in them look at this very strong statement as I wind down to close so balum got Israel to commit fornication do you know that physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion I said that the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have their place in a lake of fire that is what God thinks of organization yes sir the and her daughters will be in the Lake of Fire denominations are not of God they never have been and never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into hierarchy and leoy and is therefore a wrong spirit that that that that separates the people from the people that's what organizations and denominations do in organizing themselves from the word of God organizing they separate themselves from the word of God and bring themselves into what spiritual adultery far more Far More damning Than Physical adultery now physical adultery is horrible it's a tremendous crime yeah but spiritual adultery my goodness does that happen physical adultery doesn't even have to be physical according to St Matthew Chapter 5 that we read you can commit that by looking and lusting already in your heart now bring it up to the level of 1 Corinthians 7 and in light of this message the invisible Union of the Bride if Christ is my husband any flirting with the world is adulterous it's in nature it's the next step to committing adultery and a man always does it he has a better idea thinks this is you know we have to dress this up we have to help God we have to fix this we have to do something different we have to do what the other churches are doing so we follow their music programs we follow their music and the way they worship before you know that we'll be painting our ceilings black we have that stage like performance before you know it our message churches will move right in that you know with the open collar and the blue jeans Pastor up with the corduroy jacket with the cool the cool church and the cool pastor with his muscle shirt showing it off from the platform that's exactly what uh you you'll go into if you don't stay with the word yes yes should I keep going whose church is this anyways it's God's Church yes and before you know it you'll be going right along with those other churches what they're doing but I'm so glad it's recorded this word is recorded so I can stay faithful to the word of God the word of God that's who I'm married to I must be faithful to the word above anybody else that's my first love amen God help us God give us the grace to be faithful amen all flirting relationships outside of the word is adulterous let me say this here about worldism I've seen people who have a tremendous position in the word doctrinally they know the word they believe it's true there's no mistakes in it they have a good solid stand but they still have a worldly Spirit on on them so it's one of those sins or crimes that you can't really put you as I was telling the church this morning you know I can walk in you see me in the park with my hat on backwards everybody that wears their hat on backwards ain't wearing it on backwards for the same reason or leaning down in my car driving through the neighborhood is there anything wrong with leaning in the car well in certain neighborhoods it probably is depends on where you're coming from I know for me that would be worldly even walking through the neighborhood I can walk like this like what my my friends would call I can walk like a square or walk like one of the boys walk I'm just walking right yeah but there's a worldly aspect to it and that is internal that's what you got to deal with in your heart I can't tell you sister that was worldly the way you wore that but you can wear it worldly and walk and do things in a worldly atmosphere so this is this is the spirit of of worldliness this is the spirit of adultery adulterous that we want to be faithful to far more greater um our relationship with the Lord which is the word our husband that we're married to that's who we want to be faithful to can you say Amen how many see that now can I go just a little bit further I'm finished with this message but I shared with you last Sunday and it just touched my heart over re reexamining the meetings and the fruit of the meetings are really really good I enjoyed them brother John I think were great the Lord really blessed but I feel like I missed something because of our time you know the time pressurized me you know that there was 2 and 1 half hour preaching service on Saturday night it was brother Ferguson I believe and while I was in the service one of the people that's not really in the word yet but they were there they sent me a text I'm hungry when is the service going to be over I'm sitting on the front row and I wanted to text him back and say we all hungry but and maybe if we didn't have have food to serve at the end some folks would have left but we can't leave we got food next door so it was a long service and so I get up and I thank the Lord for it wonderful service but I felt the pressure and I didn't even give an altar call didn't give an altar call and I mentioned that to you all on Sunday kind of you know that pressure people getting up people looking at their watch it's long service and I'm going to hear it it's a long service brother Israel but like where are you going anyways you're going to eternity and the service is already long at that point it don't get late until 2 after that it's too late as brother Al would say I mean it it's already late you're already there so why frown why begrudgingly stay in your praise so anyways um I I was thinking about that so I got into this message here and I brought it for Thanksgiving then I came back the next uh I think it was Monday or so it just real strong in my heart early in the morning I started listening to it again and I went through the entire message so after two hours of preaching brother brandom takes 20 minutes on an altar call 1965 okay those of us that are are saying that those altar calls are over go get this message and that let that be your example not me not somebody else he takes 20 minutes on an altar call and as he gives the altar call he um says that my the altar just has men because the sisters believe I'm against them I'm not against you sister um and there's two or three sisters and then you can see hear that the altar filled up and then as the altar is filling up brother branner is laboring and praying with the people he already preached two hours it's a special meetings he knows he had held him long he's that brother Jack More's Pulpit is kind of in a hostile environment but I'm so glad he stayed faithful to what he had to say and he held that crowd until somebody came to the front that needed to come to the front and then as he's laboring in this his message is over and he's praying for the people and he's he makes the statement he says um he says yes that's right come on out the move is on then he says thus sayeth the Lord the move is on for the bride that little statement was hanging in the altar after the preaching of the word and so many times we miss those precious words because we're faithful to everything else but to our husband Christ the word we'll give our job more time we'll give our children more time we'll give our own Leisure more time but what about Christ goad the word who are you married to a church you're married to entertainment you're married to an organization or are you married to Christ the word amen God bless you richly I pray the Lord will strengthen Us in these tremendous truths you pray you listen to that message yourself and you tell me how it affects you and I trust and believe that it will thus sayeth the Lord the mo can we get that maybe we'll take take that quote there thus say the move is on for the bride it's in the message invisible Union I didn't have it in my notes it's right towards the end [Music] there maybe I can find it here I don't have my phone up here let see I'll find it here quickly it's one of those things you have to you got it all right go up a little further some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering into another age we're entering the raptured age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better better it must get worse worse how many knows that say Amen it's got to get worse it can't go like this see it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord move up now consecrated Christians that wants your record that wants your record to find out that these who come sincerely that you want to come and offer prayer with them as your brothers and sisters come up around the altar stand around here just a moment for prayer someone else want to come stand around here just kneel down by them just walk where you men around those men you women sweetly humbly ask prayer for them sounds like an altar call to me sound like he's encouraging people to come to the front for prayer and when was that before that's the first pool that's in the old he stopped with the altar call no you stopped with the altar call the message did not stop with it and the move is on for the bride I want to be in that move for the raptured age God bless you richly amen amen if the brothers will come with the elements and the musicians come let's bow our head for a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus thank thank you for these few words you placed upon my heart being married to the word Christ the word and Lord we've been oh Lord we we want to be faithful to you above everyone it seems like we might put you last and many times you take last place but Lord let that let that be a day gone by but let me let me rekindle my first love with with you the first love Lord when you saved me it was the greatest thing that could ever happen to me never thought never knew love like that never knew what a power of like that could do I'd heard about it I felt it sometimes but when you came down upon me and you changed me I never knew a love like that and father you've been faithful and I have not been faithful all the time but Lord I'm coming back to you tonight I'm coming back to you in this season of The Rapture I'm coming back to you in the season of Thanksgiving and Lord to renew my marriage vows with you the word to put you above everything else and Lord I just appreciate the provision that you made for us in this hour I never knew that adultery was even that that deep as what Jesus said what you said in your word to look in the lust you committed it in your heart Lord as I meditate on that how we have flirted with the things of the world even Comedians and movies and even some of the commercials are just filthy and vile and we've gotten used to hearing that and we kind of even chuckle and laugh it's like we're flirting with it Lord and we don't want to I don't want to and I just want to Lord be uh be pure in my faith to you that my faith would be [Music] unadulterated in an adulterous age that I would have an unadulterated faith for the Rapture that's my desire that my mind my spirit my faith would have no adultery in it at all God I pray as you forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings as we come to the table may you bless each heart each believer we pray in Jesus name amen amen let's sing that song I love him because he first loved me don't you love him tonight I love him I I love him because he first love me and purchase my salvation on c g tree oh [Music] I love him yes I I love him because he first love me love me and puras my Sal [Music] on [Music] C Calvary Street oh my just thinking about what the prophet said that all the way from Adam until now man has tried to do something to better hisself he took the Fig leaves to better his guilt he was in the wrong but instead of making it right he tried to cover it that's just in a man to do that in a woman in a human being we cover our wrongs our sins but we don't want them covered this evening we want them confessed placed under the blood and he through the word will wash us from all of our sins and I thank him for that [Music] I love him oh I love him because he first led me yes he loved me and Pur Sal on [Music] C calvary's tree let's stand and take 1 Corinthians 11 amen verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had up saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's till he come wherefore who soever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup that's verse 28 I'm going to take just hold it there but in 2 Corinthians 13 verse 5 says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves so that's an inner examination right Saints let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many or weak and sickly among you many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another If any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come so we'll take a moment silent prayer you pray for me I'll pray for you and let's all pray for one another just list in silent prayer amen heavenly father in my hand I hold the bread that was made for this service Lord we ask that you'll bless it and may you sanctify it for this service in Jesus name amen heavenly father I hold in my hands the cup of the New Testament of your blood it's a type of your blood it represents your blood lord it's not your blood but it represents it and we partake of it tonight according to the word and we know that it'll bring strength and healing and there's Deliverance in the cup even tonight we thank you Lord that we can come and draw strength for the journey that lays ahead May everyone that partake tonight receive that strength naturally and spiritually we pray as the prophet prayed Lord we believe that with all of our hearts in Jesus name we ask your blessings now amen God bless you can follow the directions of ushers may be seated

having now put into the heart of Judas a scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he rised from supper he laid aside his garments and he took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but thou shal know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus sath to him he that is washed needed not save to wash his feet but it's clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment was sat down again he said said sat down again he said unto them know ye what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the
