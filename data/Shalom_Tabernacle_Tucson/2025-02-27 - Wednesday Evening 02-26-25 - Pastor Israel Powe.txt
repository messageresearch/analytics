Name magnify you for all the good things you have done Lord we didn't come to complain but we came to worship you in spirit and in truth Lord and to hear your word the greatest thing that we can listen to is your word father and I pray that a portion of what will be said tonight will settle in our hearts Lord to increase our faith is our prayer we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen God bless each of you we like to welcome you to the house of the Lord this evening amen and we welcome our visitors our friends and our enemies too oh my Lord help us to love our enemies amen but we don't have no enemies here tonight me look at me take a good look real quick no enemies here tonight so God bless you um the Jonathan and Shalom cook are here with us we're so happy to have them amen um with us once again and so welcome them to the house of the Lord always good to see you Hunter God bless you and uh brother George and Moors are back from their trip and services and we had a wonderful time we um in l cruus this past week and we came back here and had a wonderful powerful testimony Sunday night if you didn't hear that you need to hear that it really encouraged my faith brother Kim ding Wall's daughter how she that family went through cancer eight years old incurable no other person had ever been healed of that but today there's a witness that the Lord Jesus came heal that form of bone cancer amen and we know these people that's so nice it's not something we read on the internet we know them that's right amen and this witness is true amen so as you're standing we like to go right into the word this evening in this new testament scriptures I know the good speeds are going to be leaving on Friday we want to pray for them also sister Lucille McCoy we'll keep her in prayer um brother Ben had a praise report he had some things going on on his job there and the Lord worked it all out for him today and he wants to thank the Lord from that amen and so we'll take our prayer request in just a moment but in Matthew chapter 13 verse number three we'll also take Revelations 3:18 okay yes and he spake many things unto them in Parables saying Behold a swer went forth to seow when he had sowed some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and for with they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away and some fell among thorns and a thorn sprung up and choked them but other fell in good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60 fold and some 30 fold who hath ears to hear Let Him hear let's take verse number 22 23 but he that receiv seed in the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some 100-fold some 60 some 30 amen I know it's the Lord's desire that we understand what we read and what we listen to and if we don't understand it we need to ask the Lord to open our understanding we don't have to act like we understand something when we don't but he can open our understanding even the little ones to the old ones he'll give you something that you can understand Amen in Revelations chapter 3 verse number 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy neck andness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with isav that thou mayest see amen just for a little tle title tonight pre predestinated seed and soil predestinated seed and soil and so may God bless you you may be seated we know that this um prophecy or the parables are natural testimonies that have deeper implications of spiritual things so Jesus taught many in Parables a swer went to sew or a farmer went to sew a field or a good man of the house or someone went to go build he gives these examples in Parables and um this is the parable of the seed being sewed and we see that the seed which we know is the word of God in one instance was seed in four different places and it was sewed in um Stony places it was sewed amongst you know shallow ground it was sewed in many different atmospheres but the place where it really thrived was when it was sewed in good ground and that good ground as we'll see brother bam tells us was the predestinated ground that was a ground that was pre prepared ground that was already prepared now as on our Sunday Services we've been in the Book of Joshua and talking about how successful his ministry was and how our example should be to stand like Joshua stand like Caleb and we looked at their uh examples and we could see how successful he was seemingly a bit more successful than even Moses he got the people to do what he wanted them to do he was even so bold to tell the son to stand still I like who you talking to I mean we never heard nobody command the son but he did it and the son obeyed him and never was a day like that that that the sun obeyed the voice of a man and even commanded the Moon too but if we really think and look at it Israel had been through a great purging right at kades Baria kades Baria got rid of a lot of the grumblers the complainers and the elders that couldn't see it and could this and that had were upset they had already tempted the Lord so he's really dealing with a fresh clean group a a group that have been purged and so it is the design of the father to purge all of us and the purging is the correction correction is what we all need pastors newcomers sisters brothers any believer that's going to go forward with the Lord you've got to be able to receive correction and that happens like for the rest of your life like when is it going to stop it doesn't stop for the rest of your life and truth be told many of us don't like the correction actually the Bible tells us it's not convenient when it happens it's embarrassing we don't like to receive the correction but we want more fruit we want to grow we want our Ministries to grow we want our gifts to be flourishing we want the Lord to use us we want the anointing in our life how many want that want the anointing in your life want the Holy Ghost to use you on every level well in order for that to happen there has to come a purging now brother brandham is dealing with this group in Leo DEA the group that needed their isaf and he made the comment that they wasn't really blind they were nearsighted so that kind of puts it in view for us Christians today and we'll read for you here and see if that will help you all right in the message um leoan Church the prophet says this in paragraph 189 he says also they were blind now that's a bad way to be I don't think these Christians were so blind as they was nearsighted I believe they were nearsighted the only thing they could look at was their big buildings only thing they can look at was their big congregation the only thing they looked at was their well garnished choir with all of its big robes and things I think they was just nearsighted they couldn't see over their nose hardly oh my I don't think they were blind they were just nearsighted all they could see was there well you know what we belong to so and so they're big denominations they're big crowd many members their Sunday school their fine buildings you know I like the way the brother random puts that because it kind of settles it in that we can receive that if I told you you was blind that's pretty harsh but if I tell you you were nearside you're just not seeing the full picture sis brother you're just not seeing the full uh uh gamut of what the word is saying you can receive that better right and so here brother random is talking about Christians that they're not blind they're just nearsighted you can see but your vision is blurry and the word of the Lord comes to open your understanding open your vision the Holy Spirit wants your vision to be clear so you can see where you're going see how to stand see the hour that you're living in and I see that many of us have had these times where we're not looking at the picture fully yes sometimes we're just looking at ourselves what's in it for me how much I'm going to get out of it you know who's going to recognize me I'm the gifted one I'm The Talented one they should always look after me and me me me me and but you're not looking at it right my brother you're not looking at it right my sister just a little nearsighted and so when we look at the word the word of the Lord has prepared every one of us to be exactly where we are today can I get a witness there's nobody can keep a blessing from you come on like they just take they're just taking all the blessings from me can nobody keep a blessing from you God knows exactly where you live that's right he knows your boss he knows the team you're working with he knows his job he knows exactly how much money you making he knows exactly what you have need of and it's just up to him Amen to open the windows of heaven or close the door who do you want in control of your life you want to take over your finances you want to you want to design a security team to watch over your family and all your junk security to watch over my my my car all my stuff all of your junk the best thing that can watch over your stuff is the good Lord Jesus over your home over your family over your health over your life over your children over your ministry that's all in God's hands so we as Believers we rest in his arms and when he brings us correction the mature Believers say yes Lord remember that that that man that threw stones at David before he was anointed yeah that's good spit on him and called him all kind of names and David had the power to shut this man up but he said no no leave him alone the Lord allowed him to come against me and all of our tests and trials are predestinated just like our blessings are too amen they're supposed to talk about you they're supposed to make you mad they're supposed to get on your nerves right but how are you supposed to react to it h and so this nearsightedness is what Christians are many times now brother bam goes forward and talks about this correction a little bit in his unfailing words of promise and he says this here Jesus himself when he came he knew he was the word he was POS positive of that for when he was just 12 years old a little boy we find him like I was speaking yesterday in the temple debating with the priest his knowledge could surpass their Traditions he was teaching them men and when his own mother come to him and said a word that was wrong watch the word correct the error the word always corrects the error and if people can only see it today the word corrects the error the whole thing is become an error but God's word is what is right he said heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall not pass away and the word that is prophesied for this day corrects the error of the day you understand the word itself corrects the error the people today say oh let's join this let's go to the council let's do all these things that's an error and the word comes back and corrects that era by identifying itself the hour the time of the hour now we know these things are true so we see where our correction comes from comes from the word doesn't come from someone's feelings or what I think or how I you know how the way others have done it always the correction comes from the word and the word for our day can you say praise the lord lord so end the word for that day is what's going to correct us keep us tuned up prune us purges us once God plants a good Vine a good tree it's his job that that tree succeeds and it grows and the way he allows that tree to succeed is he allows droughts Hard Times harsh weather winds you know the elements of the outside have to toughen that plant toughen that tree tree up and he allows the criticism of the world he allows it where everybody is not going to receive you or like you sometimes your family many times you try to make a decision to serve the Lord or go forward with the Lord many times your family will resist against you how many you know what I'm talking about how many you ever experienced that you come out of the world or you come out of what you used to do and many times your family will come again you because they're the closest to you but the Lord allows this and so as a Believer we must understand that these things are allowed by him and we got to be able to take a punch Saints you got to be able to take a slap in the face spiritually speaking and maybe even physically you got to be able to withstand the pressures of the day everything is not going to run smoothly and everything is not going to be done to your liking or to your taste and people will deliberately stick their foot out to trip you up and pull on you and snag you up and they will deliberately do that but you're a Believer you were bought by the price of the blood of our Lord Jesus and he believes that you can make it you will overcome the test and the storm how many can receive that encouragement tonight that no matter what comes or goes I'm going to stay with this word Lord help me to hold out there a song we used to sing Lord help me to hold out until my change is come my way may not be easy he did not say that it would be but if it gets dark I can't see my way told me to put my trust in thee that's why I'm saying Lord help me to hold out can y'all help me sing it no you can't help me sing that but Lord help me to hold out then it goes on I believe I can hold out I believe I can hold out I believe yes yes yes and sometimes we come on and sing it I would if somebody would help me that's why I stop because they don't should be looking at me praise the Lord all right Lord help me to hold out give me the strength I know it's in me you called me to hold out and um he does that but this is part of The Purge and this was what Israel went through and we see the success of Joshua's ministry here what brother vam says in the message hear ye him paragraph 8 God always in his great feeling towards people he meets in the counsil of man God only works through his church the church is God's agency he said one place in the gospel I'm the vine you are the branches the vine does not uh bear fruit it purges the branch and the branch bears fruit so the church is the branch that the holy spirit is working through he speaks through the pastor's lips he works through his hands and through Divine gifts he sets his body in into emotions led by the Holy Spirit by emptying himself out and letting the Holy Spirit take control he brings messages he sees visions and great things no matter what it might be that God has chosen him to do if he will yield to the spirit God will work through him or any member of his church Prophet continues in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and says this now listen to strengthen that for you he said I am the vine you are the branches now the vine does not bear fruit the vine only purges the branch and the branch bears fruit therefore the only way Jesus could speak tonight would be through my lips or your lips my hands or your hands my life or your life I am the vine you are the branches sir he doesn't bear fruit anymore he he just purges his church and it bears fruit persecution doesn't weaken a Believer persecution actually strengthens a Believer persecution always strengthens the church the prophet of God said now what kind of fruit would we be if the life that was in him is in his church it'll bear the same kind of a life amen amen amen amen Prophet continues in the message Fellowship speaking of job he says job righteous man a Godly Man everything against him one day Satan took a notion to make him deny God and when he did I love to read job many people say it's a riddle it isn't it's the word of God Jesus referred to job about how have you not heard the patience no matter what was going on how much he was persecuted how much he was called that he was in the wrong path job stayed pat on the word I like that he said pre- Adventure my children have sinned I'll offer a sacrifice for them now the only thing that man knew that man knew was the burnt offering that was God's requirement and many people think sometime because disaster happens to a Christian oh he got off the will of God they left the church they went out sometimes that's not right because God chastens every every son that comes to him he cleanses him and purges him and tries to see if he will stand that's what he's doing that's what he was doing in the time of job amen so we see the Lord purchased his church he did it with job he does it with the believer today now that's the true seed it's been planted now it's growing and now it has to be purged now the prophet goes deeper in this purging process and the correction process you know it's good to know where you stand with the Lord at all times and it's I know that many of us all of us would love to live a life where we would make never make a mistake ever ever ever again but that's just simply not going to take place it's we all make mistakes is that right and we do things that's wrong if you just look around in the building you're looking at a bunch of flawed people from the pulpit all the way through every one of us have errors faults failures little things that are undesirable and if we'll be real honest you yourself don't like those things more than anybody else that's right if you examine yourself very clearly there's things about about you that you simply just don't like and you're asking the Lord to help you this is what keeps us on our knees Saints this is what keeps us before his throne of grace and mercy what would happen if the blood ever moved off the throne what if the Lord held us accountable for every mistake we've ever made what if he held it against us I'm so glad that he paid the price that I can come under the blood tonight and say Lord forgive me for my sins take it away Lord forgive me Lord and try me one more time sir give me another chance to make it right teach me how to walk straight teach me how to not slip or slide but strengthen me Lord forgive me and try me one more time and so this constant correction this constant you know coming before the Lord and asking him to forgive give us is just the way of a Christian Life That's What believers do we're very very conscious of the things that we do now if you don't care you just don't care but true believers really care that's right when it's written in the word or it's spoken in the word a True Believer really takes that to heart many times True Believers will run to the altar when really some of the some people that really should be at the altar they'll sit in their seats that's right and but it's easy to catch and convict a True Believer because he really wants to be right he almost thinks I mean you think you're you're like you're like Lord you're just going to forget about me you feel like you just you know you just failed him for the final time the last time but he loves us tonight his great love towards us amen I'm so glad that he loves me and he loves you amen and so it's part of it the correction is part of it it's this gentle hand of Love towards us as he's correcting us Prophet tells us Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and says this here paragraph 8 uh paragraph 7even friend someone said to me brother Brandon brother Roberts pray for 500 people while you're praying for one that's right but brother Roberts is doing what God told him to do and I'm doing what God told me to do see we just have to see we're both working for God but look if a person has got unconfessed sin something in their heart you could pray for them all night long that'll never do no good that de demon will hold right there or if that person was supposed to do something that it didn't do it and God put that disease on them to bring them to reconciliation or to correction you just can't do it that's all and then what if he did do it and God gave the man the authority to take that sickness off there and would take it off when God put it on them for a purpose or God didn't put it on them he let the devil do it God doesn't make people sick sometimes he permits the devil to do it but God couldn't do it himself cuz he his Mercy he's Mercy can't be mercy and death he's life or death one he's life through Satan comes death and so here we see that sometimes the things that happen to us the devil is causing it to happen to us but it's the Lord allowing it to happen for a purpose not just to see you squeal and sream and get upset and temper T but he's doing it for a purpose and what is the purpose that these people are lying on me why are these people that don't like me on my job what is this going on in my neighborhood what is the purpose for whatever I'm going through that should be our prayer God has a purpose if you're a True Believer he's not wasting time on any tests or trials there's no extra test that he's just going to throw in there for no reason they're for a purpose and everything you're going through right now is for a purpose even the questions in your mind the questions of what your future is and what am I supposed to be doing I believe every one of us here have those questions some area of I have them Lord what should I do what does that look like in the future what does that hold and we're constantly trying to find what we call the perfect will of God and the enemy has come and he he's allowed to to cause us these little stresses these little annoyances but God allows it and it would be a tragedy if we go through all of that and we never get the purpose of what's really going on now we can make a long list of how dirty they did to us and what they did and them over there and they over there but what what about you what did it do for you did it develop a prayer life in you did you come to church more did you come less did you praise the Lord more if you got the same look on your face I don't know if that maybe you need to go through it again that test should have wiped that smirk off of your face or that frown or that growl or that grunt or that come on somebody m yes yes it's a purpose there's a purpose so the Lord purges us and he prunes us you have to do that to a tree to encourage growth to do that to a plant sometimes it's got to happen the purging and it happens to the individuals it happens to groups Lord Purge me Lord take out all the impurities out of my faith Lord Lord take the nearsightedness and let me see clearly what's really going on in my life stop letting me find an excuse on how to you know this group or these people and them let me take that out of my prayer and really focus on and put the spiritual glasses on and see clearly what the purpose is because God clearly has a purpose for our life amen the prophet says we realize in the message Supernatural we realize that this is like an experience of the Christian sometimes we have to go through terrible chastisement chastening of the Lord many things to correct us that will be fruit bearing Christians sometimes has to prune us or cut off take away take out of our hands we think sometimes oh God what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing amen so we pray father that today that you'll prune every one of us from the leadest to least to the greatest the pastor God we pray that you'll prune every one of us take away all that's unlike you father take away the thing that's hindering us from being fruit bearing Christians the days are coming when it's going to get dark then want to go into the Sheepfold we want to be sheep today Father we want to follow exactly in the footsteps of the shepherd He gave us us an example he said I come not to do my will but the will of him that sent me may that be our motive today God to do the will of God who has saved us praise the Lord praise the Lord God is a good husbandman he says in the message the rest restoration of the brid tree yes paragraph 42 God is the good husband Men He pruned the tree that was all cut off all the dead limbs what's he going to do burn them up exactly God is the husbandman of this tree he takes care of it he watches over his Heritage what is his Heritage his own word he watches over his word to confirm it to watch it to see where he can get he's going to restore so when these churches begin to organize and things like that he just prunes them off and the church goes on and the Lutheran were going to be an organization will uh be as big as the ca Catholic all right he just pruned off the branch Wesley took it right on raised up another Prophet then soon as Wesley did it well Wesley died the great prophet what they do organize onc come Pentecost soon as she died he pruned that off it's raising right on up see he's going to restore where does the fruit grow it don't start down here at the bottom it starts in the top where does the sun hit the tree first all glory in the evening light the top of the tree amen not down at the bottom branches but up there in the top of the tree is where the fruit ripens at amen do you love him amen will you serve him amen do you believe him amen I sure do believe him with all my heart now what is it he's going to prune off them old dead Vines as she comes up all those organization Vines till she gets right up into the top of the tree there is where he's going to get his fruit now how many of us want to be pruned oh my how many of us need to be pruned yes we do we do in the third ex Exodus the prophet of God says this here paragraph 117 he says the organizations live L lusciously lived as a grafted Branch into the real Vine of Christianity but it's still bearing its original fruits women half-dressed men intellectual denying the power of the spirit but it's lived under the name of the Christian church it's a grafted Vine but the husbandman is coming by now to prune that Vine as he said he would do all those that don't have the fruit is cut off and thrown into the fire and consume is that probably what we've seen happen over the last 5 to 10 years these groups of people that are falling away in this pastor in this ministry and this group don't believe the word anymore and that group decides this is not important or those days of Miracles is pass or we don't believe in the gift and whatever is that part of what is taking place I don't know but it certainly looks like there has been a great Purge I don't even have all of the open doors of friends and pastors and ministri that I had like five years ago or 10 years ago things have changed people have changed um and your friendship will change and the people your fellowship will change as this great Purge happens and I say Lord Purge me Purge my faith so that my faith is pure 100% unadulterated faith not mixed with anything and that's what I want to be and I've we've leaned on our friendships we've leaned on because there's groups we've leaned on from one reason or the other and then the Lord allow that friendship to be challenged he'll allow that arm of Flesh to be challenged and to find out really do you really love me or do you really love to be popular all right you know he allows that and we've seen that I'm talking from my own experience I've seen that the Lord challenge allows those things to happen I I don't like it I don't like the way that feels I would love I'm not a fighter I love to just fellowship and be friends but things happen people make decision ISS that you have to stay with the word amen Believers amen Saints the world's going to change and the way they view religion is going to change and it's constantly changing they'll change the Constitution they'll change the laws they'll constantly change and even Believers will change how they view the word but I want to keep my eyesight right I want to see what God Said in his word amen and I don't want to compromise on his word not for a friend not for a foe not for popularity oh my God help us to be real solid Believers like Joshua like Caleb amen let's be a real seed that's planted in real soil now what is this soil this soil was predestinated Amen in works as Faith Express the prophet of God says this paragraph 130 any seed has to have its ground of course therefore all he forne see he already knew what was going to happen notice Jesus said again about the seed some fell on Rock others mixed ground see over where there's Thorns thistles and everything else it couldn't grow and others on good ground good ground good soil which had been preprepared already prepared now notice paragraph 152 notice now we find that Isaiah here spoke it the Virgin Mary the grounds was already broke up she had been a virgin she hadn't run around the grounds had been already prepared or predestinated by for knowledge of God even said she was a virgin right then God know what her name would be for her name was on The Book of Life in heaven then it was Vindicated man then to man saw the expression of it by the works when it was already done now we look back and say sure it was done because we see the works that was done and God's going to have a church in the last day there will be a that will rise in the last day amen and even when he said that there would be a bride for a Rapture he knew which names were on the Book of Life already he saw you yes sir he saw me amen prepared soil thank the Lord because the word is predestinated but he also predestinated my heart for the word to receive a beding ground for that seed to fall in in a pre prepared soil remember the Bible the truth the word has been broadcast to many different people groups all over they've heard it it falls they've heard it they'll start in a little bit and then they fall back they've heard it and then the world catches them but somehow some way you hear the word and then it settles in your heart then it begins to be bring about a change in you you oh you ought to be grateful and thankful for the predestinated seed the predestinated pre-prepared ground them two coming together and you'll find out that this word was actually made for you and you were made for it it's the only thing that made my life make any sense was the word of the Lord nothing else makes any sense to me and I've heard the arguments that I've ran after it I've tried it drink this run like this stand upside down do whatever and don't work for me take this vitamin read this book seven steps to a good life 12 steps to whatever join this group don't eat meat on Friday we're all white shave your head bald whatever the foolishness they do it but this word that I heard it fit me just exactly when I heard it I said yes where'd you get that from I asked the brother Fred where'd you get that from oh yes we got a message you got a prophet what's a prophet you showed me that picture right there see that light up there see that light up there I was like yeah I kind of see it he said that's the pillar of fire the first time I heard that I was like the pillar of fire yeah that's in the Bible and you start going deeper into it and you find out that this actually makes sense now I can't explain it like a college degree would explain it and I'm not an explainer like can break it down as a scientist could explain it but I'll just say it like this I know who my mama is and I know that this message is true it's been revealed to me that it is the truth and we'll give our life for it won't you there's no amount of money that can pay you to make you stop believing this word do you can you be bought no sir do you have a price no no no there is no amount of money well if you follow this word we're going to leave you well he like well get going all right if you follow this word you're not going to have no friends well the Lord got other friends for me you follow this you take this stand you know you're going to be the odd man out you do this you're going to do that but you know what this is the only thing that fits because you know why I was predestinated to follow this message that's why I handle it the way I do that's why I preach it the way I do is because it is mine and I know it's mine all right amen somebody amen the prophet continues here my last quote here in the message works his faith is Express he says this here in paragraph number 160 now what if Moses would have said sir just a moment I thought I was talking to an intelligent being this great I am that you say you are now how in the world will I ever take this little old Crooked Stick I got here in my hand and take over an army of a million of men armed with Spears Fighters I'm not a fighter I'm a Shepherd how can I ever do that there was no question why why the ground in his heart he was predes he was a predestinated person gifts and callings are without repentance God had told Abraham that he would do that and there was the ground prepared yes sir and Moses took this stick and went down there and took that Nation out of a Nation when he come with the stick in his hand and told Pharaoh let them go pharaoh seen in Moses The Works that he had faith in what he was going to do or trying to do he had faith in the promise of God that had made the promise he went down to take it over no other man would have done that and no other man could have done it he was ordained to do it God beforehand had told Abraham that that's just what would happen and when the time of the promise Drew nigh there was a little boy born and a fair child in the par parents amaran and jocked was not afraid of the king's commandment see there was something the grounds was already prepared oh God I hope I'm speaking to ground prepared tonight if the seed can fall in the right place and it's going to be some if it isn't it won't happen that's the same thing why you say brother bandam that kind of takes it away from us if it does it takes it away from Christianity too you can impersonate anything but if it really falls in the word of God falls in the right kind of a ground is going to bring forth its kind it's got to because it's a seed amen how many thank the Lord for that it's a good ground it's a seed and it's prepared soiled I was made you were you were made for such a time is this he prepared the soil he put our name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the Bible says we were predestinated before the foundation of the world in order for him to be God he had to know who you were before you got here knew your station in life knew what age you would hear the word and knew that you really would care what the word of God God said and I'm so glad that he put something in me that cares about this word thank the Lord not what I ought to be not what I should be but I'm so glad I'm not what I used to be and I know I'm going somewhere tonight amen God bless you God bless you let us let us pray the musicians come thank you Lord for your word tonight if you you portions of word Lord for our encouragement father that the word of the hour corrects the errors of the hour the church is going in the different directions that they're going he said you watch the condition of the women it'll tell you the condition of the church Lord that's in your word watch the attitude of men and see the weakness see of the hour you see the the the evilness the worldliness the cares of the world you see the lack of depth that many they don't go deep into the word you told the prophet Joshua to meditate day and night that's that's morning and nighttime that's not just one time hearing or listening it's meditating in day and night and you would make his way prosperous give him good success to stay with the laws the word of Moses Lord that's our desire tonight we know that the good ground is ground that's been prepared where the seed can take root Lord we take these messages of the Prophet to our heart we study them Lord we read them we consume them we thank you for them there's depth to it Lord we read our Bible we pray every day there's a depth to our Christian experience we're not just here to show up and see show that we've been here but there's a behind the scene we have a prayer closet we have a time of Consecration and that's the oldfashioned prayer meeting that we've come to tonight Lord to rededicate our lives our hearts consecrate ourselves to you Lord and Lord also the that seed can handle the criticism it can handle to be ridiculed oh it can handle the cares and the elements because it's in good ground and and and we go through things we hear things that's not convenient we we go through things that are not nice but Lord but we are in good ground and the seed is taking root in the soil and there Lord now we can produce 100-fold 60 fold 50 fold we begin to produce from a Christian life not just a taker or just setting back we're actually producing from a Christian Life producing the word of God in our life oh God we pray that that would be our testimony tonight Lord we're true Christians here but some of us myself included we're nearsighted Lord and we need Isa to take away the blindness in our eyes we can see clearly Lord Wash Me Lord Purge me with hup cleanse me Lord with Isa open my eyes to see the picture the big picture the picture how you see it Lord oh God grant it we pray we ask these blessings in the mighty name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen thank you oh my so this is from Brother sea
