[32:53] made a way for us to come Lord we
[32:56] appreciate that tonight
[32:58] may you bless us as we walk forward into
[33:01] the good things you've prepared for us
[33:04] we pray and we ask in Jesus name amen
[33:09] God bless you Saints so good to be in
[33:11] the house of the Lord with you we
[33:13] welcome each of you to the house of the
[33:14] Lord our visitors and friends and Saints
[33:19] of the most high God Amen God bless you
[33:23] richly we had um quite a long trip here
[33:26] coming back from thank you musicians
[33:29] from Florida to lay arest my good friend
[33:32] brother Wesco and uh just a really
[33:35] tremendous service that they had there
[33:38] to see another servant of the Lord cross
[33:42] over like that and so we um were part of
[33:46] that uh a small part of the service
[33:49] there on Friday and then Saturday and we
[33:53] took a flight late Saturday night and we
[33:56] got into Phoenix the we hours of the
[33:58] morning this morning had a service this
[34:01] morning with the Saints in Mesa and had
[34:04] a wonderful time I trust that they are
[34:06] the Lord will bless them I believe
[34:08] they're on the service
[34:10] tonight and tonight we're coming to the
[34:13] table of the Lord and um another great
[34:17] subject from his word that we trust will
[34:19] be a blessing to each and every one of
[34:21] you amen aren't you glad to be a
[34:24] Christian thanking the lord for
[34:26] Thanksgiving
[34:28] uh sometimes we just survive it you know
[34:30] because we eat more than we
[34:32] should I did anyways and my family came
[34:35] down 10 of my family members from
[34:38] California came down and which hasn't
[34:41] happened ever before and so that was
[34:43] wonderful but we had to turn and leave
[34:46] that Friday which is a little difficult
[34:48] but we thank the Lord for that thank the
[34:50] Lord for each of you and so let's go
[34:53] right to the word before we go to the
[34:55] table of the lord we ask you to stand to
[34:57] take
[34:58] a scripture reading in Romans chapter 7
[35:01] and Matthew Chapter 5 Romans
[35:05] 7 as we know brother random takes this
[35:08] message and
[35:12] preaches the invisible Union of the
[35:14] bride of Christ and as I told the church
[35:17] this morning in Mesa first of all
[35:21] brother random where did you get that
[35:23] title
[35:24] from it is inspired all all the way
[35:29] through and when you go deeper into that
[35:32] message as it unfolds so many truths
[35:35] that we have today were just opened up
[35:38] right in that little series there in
[35:41] streetport and it's beautiful really
[35:44] really rich I heard it again I've never
[35:47] heard it the way I've heard it these
[35:49] last few times and it's just a blessing
[35:51] to me so Romans 7 verse
[35:56] 1 no know you not brethren for I speak
[35:59] to them that know the law how that the
[36:01] law hath dominion over a man as long as
[36:06] he liveth for the woman which hath a
[36:09] husband is bound by the law to her
[36:11] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[36:15] husband be dead she is loose from the
[36:18] law of her husband so then if while her
[36:21] husband liveth she be married to another
[36:24] man she shall be called an adulteress
[36:27] but if her husband be dead she is free
[36:30] from that law so that she is no
[36:34] adulteress though should be married to
[36:36] another man wherefore my brethren ye
[36:40] also are become dead to the law by the
[36:44] body of Christ that ye should be what
[36:49] married to another even to him who is
[36:53] raised from the dead that we should
[36:56] bring forth fruit unto God Amen and so
[37:00] the subject there in that if you
[37:03] continue down to verse 6 is speaking of
[37:07] adultery but the Apostle Paul brings it
[37:10] deeper than just the physical adultery
[37:13] he's talking about how the man and how
[37:16] the law has no dominion over him if he's
[37:19] dead and so we'll take one more
[37:21] scripture as Jesus opens up this subject
[37:24] to us more in Matthew chapter 5 verse
[37:36] 27 Jesus speaking ye have heard that it
[37:40] was said by them of old time Thou shalt
[37:42] not commit adultery but I say unto you
[37:46] that whosoever lookth up on a woman to
[37:49] lust after her hath committed adultery
[37:53] with her already in his heart
[37:59] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on the
[38:01] reading of the word once again we ask
[38:03] your blessings upon the hearing and the
[38:06] speaking we ask in jesus' name amen God
[38:10] bless you you may be
[38:13] seated
[38:14] married to Christ the word that's the
[38:17] title of the message married to Christ
[38:19] the word and the subject is the
[38:21] invisible Union so quickly and briefly
[38:25] here how many of you were raised in
[38:27] denomination Nation or organization or
[38:28] come through that system a number good
[38:31] hand number that were raised in that and
[38:34] so maybe you you all can help me with
[38:38] this too I was raised in church my whole
[38:40] life I never had this scripture
[38:43] expounded to me like how brother Brandon
[38:46] brings it
[38:47] out that when you look and you lust you
[38:51] have committed the crime in fact in the
[38:54] world many people would say I was just
[38:58] looking I was just
[39:00] looking and so um but Jesus here makes
[39:04] it clear he takes what adultery is and
[39:07] he raises up but I say unto you now he's
[39:11] quoting in the laws of Moses Thou shalt
[39:14] not commit adultery it's in Exodus it's
[39:16] in Leviticus it's in Deuteronomy Thou
[39:18] shalt not commit Thou shalt not commit
[39:21] adultery and here he is re quoting it
[39:25] you have heard them say of old times but
[39:28] I say unto you he that lookth and
[39:31] lusteth hath committed adultery already
[39:34] in his heart so God bless you Saints
[39:36] there in Phoenix this morning uh just
[39:39] bear with me as we review just a little
[39:41] bit because they heard some of this this
[39:43] morning so if you just uh meditate on
[39:47] the scripture there Romans chapter 7
[39:49] alone verses
[39:51] 1-6 you'll get this out of the text
[39:55] along with the message in ible
[39:58] Union uh first our first birth is a type
[40:02] of our first nature the carnal
[40:05] man it is also a type of our first
[40:09] marriage with the world the carnal man
[40:12] this is how this is what this scripture
[40:15] how Paul is playing with it and also
[40:18] brother brandom is bringing that first
[40:22] marriage and it's clear that we must die
[40:24] to this first marriage or our first
[40:27] birth birth that's why we need the new
[40:28] birth and be remarried to Christ weere
[40:32] the scripture there all believers that
[40:36] are a part of the Bride are married to
[40:40] Christ so there's no single people in
[40:43] this message amen that are in the word
[40:46] okay not not everybody that follow the
[40:48] message you understand but if you're a
[40:50] part of the Bride you're are married to
[40:52] someone and that someone is he who
[40:55] raised from the dead
[40:57] which is the word and so with this
[41:00] marriage like any other marriage we can
[41:03] make this statement that all flirting
[41:06] and relationships outside of the word is
[41:10] adulterous now we're living in age of
[41:13] adultery first Peter tells us that their
[41:17] eyes are full of
[41:20] adultery I mean the advertisements the
[41:24] um everything that you see going on it's
[41:28] motivated by you know the act of
[41:31] adultery sex sinful
[41:34] fornication strip tees all of that to
[41:37] advertise what they're doing it's an age
[41:39] of that so you don't even have to
[41:41] imagine the way a man or a woman is
[41:44] dressed they show you everything there's
[41:48] no imagination to it it's placed right
[41:50] before you you just looking at them it's
[41:53] like you did something wrong I mean
[41:57] but um Jesus makes it clear if you look
[42:01] and you lust you commit you commit um
[42:04] adultery and so this this beautiful
[42:08] message that we have received as the
[42:12] prophet of God brings to us out of the
[42:15] message the invisible Union of the bride
[42:18] of Christ and he says this and this is
[42:20] where I got the title in invisible Union
[42:23] paragraph number 175
[42:27] and he says this
[42:29] here how can a preacher goes out here to
[42:32] a seminary and looks at acts 238 and
[42:36] sees that there's not a person in the
[42:38] Bible ever baptized in those titles and
[42:41] then still say he's pregnated with the
[42:44] word of
[42:45] God he's telling you a lie he's sold his
[42:49] birthrights he's committed adultery
[42:53] against the very thing that he said he
[42:56] is put away in divorce God is going to
[43:00] have a virtuous church just exactly a
[43:03] bride the Bible said the word is not in
[43:07] you the the word is not in you so what
[43:10] kind of children are you bearing
[43:12] pregnated
[43:14] denominational there's been no death to
[43:16] separate you from your first lover amen
[43:20] what will the Joneses think if I go to
[43:23] crying and speaking in tongues what will
[43:26] they think if I'm re-baptized what a
[43:29] nonsense are you married to the Joneses
[43:32] or are you married to the church or are
[43:36] you married to Christ the
[43:38] word now who are you married to okay who
[43:43] are you married to we're all married to
[43:46] Christ the word and that is our headship
[43:49] that's our leadership tonight we are
[43:52] married to Christ the word now brother
[43:56] brand goes deeper in this message and I
[43:59] uh uh I want to the Brethren there and
[44:02] to to you know if you take the message
[44:06] there and you listen to it how he types
[44:10] A woman with the church and he talks
[44:13] about how she's given this sacred Trust
[44:15] of motherhood of Womanhood of virtue
[44:20] motherhood and um her her
[44:23] Womanhood that she God gives her that
[44:27] and then he says this in paragraph 101
[44:30] as he crosses that over to the church
[44:32] and he's talking about the woman through
[44:34] this message he says I want you to keep
[44:36] the church in mind with this and so as
[44:39] you go back and listen to the message as
[44:41] the Lord would lead you I believe you'll
[44:43] really get a deeper understanding that
[44:47] this isn't about it's harder for the
[44:50] Sisters than it is for the brothers no
[44:53] no no no no it's hard for everybody
[44:57] when you really look at that every one
[45:00] of us have to give an account for our
[45:04] marriage and the faithfulness to who
[45:07] we're married to then it's much deeper
[45:10] than some carnal Affair who's dressing
[45:13] right and who's not it goes so much
[45:14] deeper than that Jesus brought it deeper
[45:17] he says if you look and you
[45:19] lust um you've committed adultery you
[45:22] say brother isra I didn't take the
[45:23] second look well you didn't have to
[45:26] because your First Look was so long you
[45:29] saw everything you needed to
[45:31] see and so that's that's between you and
[45:34] God now now if we all hanging out we're
[45:36] brothers we walking up wherever we're
[45:38] going and we're fellowshipping at the
[45:40] restaurant and I might not I might not
[45:42] be able to see what you're doing in your
[45:44] mind but God sees you and you might not
[45:47] be able to see what I'm thinking in my
[45:49] heart in my mind but God sees me and if
[45:53] in your heart you look and you lust
[45:56] Jesus said you've committed it already
[46:00] where in your heart so it's so much
[46:04] deeper than what you see me or catch me
[46:08] doing this you can't catch but God can
[46:12] and he sees it so much deeper God bless
[46:14] you so here the prophet of God brings
[46:16] this one-on-one invisible Union of the
[46:18] bride of Christ he says what a sacred
[46:20] trust amen what a responsibility to a
[46:23] woman now you see why she's a type of of
[46:27] the church which has the same
[46:30] responsibility as a woman has a sick
[46:33] responsibility to Motherhood to her
[46:36] virtues to her husband the church has a
[46:40] sacred responsibility to prayer and to
[46:44] the word and to Christ just the same as
[46:49] the woman has I've read this quote many
[46:52] many times for you and it still means
[46:56] the same thing that it that it says on
[46:58] the tape it is a sacred responsibility
[47:02] not just a responsibility it is a sacred
[47:06] responsibility to prayer to the word and
[47:10] to Christ now the word is a bleeding
[47:15] word and the word that we have is word
[47:20] that bled and died for us it's not just
[47:24] Jesus the man with sandals on with his
[47:27] lovely face and the image that we see
[47:30] here as a man the characters of who he
[47:33] is just beyond any other Mortal being
[47:38] and many times that image we have in our
[47:40] head and many times the denominations
[47:43] they have the image of the lovely Lord
[47:45] Jesus but they do not connect that image
[47:48] with his word and his word is really who
[47:52] he is and we're married to the word
[47:57] above anything else now a woman is
[48:00] married to her husband yes he's the head
[48:02] of her yes but above her husband is
[48:06] still the word if that husband wants his
[48:09] wife to do something that's contrary to
[48:11] the word if she's a Christian she'll
[48:14] take what the word says above anything
[48:16] that's wrong can I get a witness that's
[48:19] the truth because Christ really is who
[48:22] we are married to and so Ephesians
[48:24] chapter 5 let's turn there quickly
[48:27] and see this washing of the Water by the
[48:34] word verse
[48:36] 21 it's talking about submitting
[48:39] yourselves one to another wives submit
[48:41] yourselves to your own husband goes down
[48:43] that the husband is ah head of the wife
[48:47] as Christ is to the body and to the
[48:50] church verse 25 husbands love your wives
[48:53] even as Christ also loved the church and
[48:55] gave himself for it
[48:57] that verse 26 that he might sanctify it
[49:01] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[49:04] Water by the
[49:06] word so the word is what washes you you
[49:11] know that song we love to sing it what
[49:13] can wash away my sins nothing but the
[49:16] blood of Jesus which blood are we
[49:19] talking about are we talking about the
[49:20] literal blood well the literal blood we
[49:23] don't know where that is I wasn't there
[49:26] 20 th years ago to actually touch the
[49:29] literal blood or see the literal blood
[49:32] but where is the blood at the blood is
[49:35] the life and the life is in his word the
[49:40] word of God is what cleanses us it's
[49:43] when the word comes forth and you hear
[49:46] it and you do what it says then that's
[49:49] literally what cleanses you it's not a
[49:52] theories it's like Lord cleanse me from
[49:54] my sins yes he sends you his word and
[49:57] his word heals you it delivers you it
[50:01] changes the things that you do because
[50:04] the word says it here and you do what
[50:06] the word says amen so this is very clear
[50:12] in the message pardon
[50:14] 1963 the prophet of God says this I'm
[50:19] sorry not that we'll take the invisible
[50:20] Union of the bride of Christ paragraph
[50:24] 273 and he says this what is sin sin is
[50:29] unbelief unbelief in what the word
[50:33] unbelief in God which is the word pure
[50:38] unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon
[50:41] for the skies amen standing ready think
[50:46] your garments Washed by the Water of the
[50:49] bleeding word the word become
[50:53] blood the word bled for you
[50:57] and you are washed in bleeding word the
[51:00] word bleeding the life of God in the
[51:03] word and the Word was bled for you that
[51:06] you might be washed from the filth of
[51:09] these prostitutes and be cleaned and
[51:12] Sanctified by the washing of the water
[51:14] of the word makes your mind and heart
[51:18] stayed on God and on his word how many
[51:22] thank God for the word the word washes
[51:25] you the word cleanses you I think it's
[51:28] in Psalms it says how can a young man
[51:31] cleanse
[51:32] himself by taking heed to his word
[51:35] according to Thy word and the scriptures
[51:39] tells us in Ephesians 5 that he washed
[51:43] Us by the washing of the Water by the
[51:48] word now brother bam makes a strong
[51:51] statement about these prostitutes and
[51:53] he's talking in in reference to the
[51:55] other Church
[51:57] and to the false churches strong
[52:00] statement very strong language but it's
[52:03] still the truth the Bible is written
[52:05] that way and it's the immoral immorality
[52:09] of a church that causes it to wear those
[52:13] kind of labels just like a lady that is
[52:17] living untrue there's labels that she
[52:20] would wear by the actions of her life
[52:24] and it's not nice to think of it it but
[52:26] it's a reality that's what it is and
[52:29] when the scripture talks about the uh
[52:32] harlots and Revelations there 17 and 19
[52:36] talking about um the mother of harlots
[52:40] is talking about churches and brother
[52:42] Brandon brings that so clear to us um
[52:46] that that that's a type of the church
[52:49] now you have to keep the spiritual side
[52:52] in mind because sometimes many times we
[52:55] just focus on the natur natural and
[52:57] we're we're looking at the way somebody
[52:59] is dressed in church maybe somebody
[53:02] looks worldly but really it goes much
[53:04] deeper than what somebody looks like on
[53:07] the outside it's so much
[53:09] deeper um we could show you and prove to
[53:12] you that inside of your heart you can be
[53:15] right and your outside still be looking
[53:17] pretty tore up but it's still a hard
[53:19] question and God is the only one that
[53:21] knows that the moment a heart is made
[53:24] right in the eyes of God they are right
[53:27] I don't care what they're wearing I
[53:28] don't care what their hair looks like
[53:30] don't care how worldly how many whatever
[53:32] they got on them when that heart is made
[53:35] right they are right before the sight of
[53:38] God amen amen and so we we we we so much
[53:43] on that we look on the outside so much
[53:45] but this is really an
[53:47] inner and in the message brother bam
[53:51] takes the message pardon and he says
[53:54] this and just getting into the
[53:55] denomination
[53:57] and I got 10 more 10 or 15 more minutes
[53:59] and then we'll close okay thank you
[54:03] Sean paragraph 51 now from Adam until
[54:07] now I want you to get this tonight from
[54:10] Adam until now man has tried to make his
[54:14] own
[54:16] substitute he's tried his best to do
[54:19] something a little better than what God
[54:22] did it then and that's just natural in
[54:25] man man is always trying to better
[54:28] something to make it a different way he
[54:31] wants to inject his own ideas into the
[54:33] plan of God and that's why we stand
[54:36] tonight separated the Christian people
[54:39] of the world by barriers by
[54:42] denominational barriers does this
[54:45] because that man has injected his own
[54:49] idea into God's plan from Adam until now
[54:55] as I've said
[54:56] it's been that way Adam expressed me
[55:00] man's thinking in the Garden of Eden
[55:03] when he made himself a fig Leaf apron to
[55:07] face God it's something that he did
[55:09] himself and from and from fig leaves
[55:13] he's tried educations Towers cities
[55:16] Idols civilization denomination but it
[55:19] ever Remains the Same God only accepts
[55:23] his subjects under the blood that's all
[55:27] education has totally failed more
[55:30] education we get further we get from
[55:32] each other denomination has totally fail
[55:35] we draw lines and barriers and each one
[55:38] trying to get that denomination higher
[55:40] than the other and it breaks
[55:43] Fellowship civilization has merely
[55:46] brought about confusion cities towers
[55:49] and what more has all failed and God's
[55:54] plan Still Remains the Same
[55:56] under the
[55:58] blood and we know that the blood is the
[56:01] word is that right the word bled for us
[56:05] the word died for us the word is what
[56:10] cleanses us the word is my
[56:15] husband the word is my headship is that
[56:18] what the scripture says it says that
[56:20] we're married to him who raised from the
[56:23] dead that's who we're married to
[56:26] this evening now go a little bit further
[56:31] in the exposition of the perrian church
[56:36] age here's what is written in that
[56:40] church age
[56:42] book and he makes this statement when
[56:44] any man turns from the word of God and
[56:48] joins a church instead of receiving the
[56:50] holy spirit that man
[56:53] dies dead that is what he he is don't
[56:57] join a church don't get into
[57:00] organizations and get taken up with
[57:01] Creeds and tradition or anything that
[57:04] takes the place of the word and the
[57:06] spirit or your dead read that again it
[57:09] says don't get into organization and get
[57:12] taken up with Creeds and tradition or
[57:15] anything that takes the place of the
[57:18] word and the spirit or you're dead it's
[57:21] all over you're dead eternally separated
[57:25] from God that is what happened in every
[57:28] age sense God delivers the people they
[57:32] come out by the blood Sanctified by the
[57:35] word walk through the waters of baptism
[57:37] and get filled with the spirit but after
[57:40] a while the first love cools off and
[57:44] someone gets the idea that they ought to
[57:47] organize in order to preserve themselves
[57:51] and make a name for themselves and they
[57:54] organize themselves right back in the
[57:56] second generation and sometimes even
[57:58] before them they no longer have the
[58:01] spirit of God just a form of worship
[58:04] they are dead they have hybridized
[58:07] themselves with Creed and form and there
[58:10] is no life in them we stop right there
[58:14] sometimes we feel like we need to help
[58:16] the word or protect the word by hiding
[58:20] this part or not preaching on this part
[58:22] or making it more acceptable to the
[58:25] masses
[58:26] but God sent his word exactly the way he
[58:30] wanted it to come and he uses the people
[58:34] that he wanted to use you think well God
[58:37] why would you use a seventh grade
[58:38] education the grammar is not the
[58:40] greatest Southern uh know you know
[58:43] Southern language and just all of the
[58:45] other you know he had all the scholars
[58:47] of the day there some very smart people
[58:50] God could have used in this day why
[58:52] would he purposely use a seventh grade
[58:55] educ ation a nons schooled man a poor
[59:00] man at that do you think that was random
[59:03] or was that really on purpose that was
[59:05] on purpose my friend and we know that
[59:08] when God sends his word he sends his
[59:11] word so that we would not rest in the
[59:14] word of men but we'll rest in the power
[59:18] of God it's the power of God that saves
[59:22] you it's not your intellection it's not
[59:25] your intellectual it's not your ability
[59:27] to argue the Scriptures it has nothing
[59:29] to do with how smart you are but my
[59:32] faith rests in the power of God the
[59:36] Apostle Paul was a very smart man very
[59:40] smart man but when he came to the church
[59:41] he didn't come with great big words he
[59:44] came in the power and the demonstration
[59:48] of the Holy Ghost so that your faith
[59:51] would only rest in
[59:53] that Amen in the the power of God what
[59:58] does the scripture say about that Psalm
[1:00:00] 68:35 says oh God Thou Art terriable out
[1:00:04] of thy holy places the god of Israel he
[1:00:07] is he that giveth strength and power
[1:00:11] unto his people Blessed Be how many need
[1:00:14] some power it ain't coming in the gym
[1:00:17] we're running three miles a day how many
[1:00:19] need some power that power comes from on
[1:00:22] high that power comes from the source of
[1:00:26] power that power gives you the grace and
[1:00:29] the power to overcome the world that
[1:00:32] comes from godj 1 Corinthians 1:17 says
[1:00:37] Christ sent me not to baptize but to
[1:00:40] preach the gospel not with wisdom of
[1:00:42] words lest the Cross of Christ should be
[1:00:46] made of none effect for look at Verse 18
[1:00:49] for the preaching of the Cross is to
[1:00:54] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[1:00:59] unto
[1:01:00] me when I heard the gospel cross being
[1:01:04] preached that's the power that saved me
[1:01:08] that's the power that delivered us that
[1:01:11] delivers the church it's the preaching
[1:01:13] of the cross the church ain't preaching
[1:01:16] the cross it's not preaching the gospel
[1:01:19] that's right but unto us which are saved
[1:01:22] it is the power of God 1 Corinthians 2
[1:01:28] verse number three and I was with you in
[1:01:32] weakness and fear and much trembling and
[1:01:34] my spee my preaching was not with
[1:01:36] enticing words of man's Wisdom but in
[1:01:39] demonstration of the spirit and a power
[1:01:42] he demonstrated it that your faith
[1:01:44] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:01:47] but in the power of God you know some
[1:01:51] people will try to take this message and
[1:01:53] make it about some man's intellect
[1:01:55] something that you got to prove you got
[1:01:57] to argue you got to prove everything
[1:02:00] that he said is it actually happened you
[1:02:03] can prove it online you got to be able
[1:02:05] to show them that brother B was telling
[1:02:07] the truth you know the the message
[1:02:09] speaks for
[1:02:10] itself God speaks for God doesn't need
[1:02:13] any of my help doesn't need your help
[1:02:15] just say what it says and it will do
[1:02:18] what it said it will do in the life of a
[1:02:21] prostitute or a religious man when the
[1:02:25] gospel of the Cross is preached that is
[1:02:28] the power that
[1:02:30] saves any of us any
[1:02:33] individual
[1:02:35] now 2 Corinthians 1 Corinthians 4:20
[1:02:38] says for the kingdom of God is not in
[1:02:41] word but in
[1:02:44] power 2 Corinthians 13: 3-5 since you
[1:02:48] seek proof of Christ speaking in me
[1:02:51] which to you word is not weak but is
[1:02:54] mighty in you for though he was
[1:02:57] crucified through weakness yet he lived
[1:03:00] by the power of God for we also are
[1:03:03] weaken him but we shall live with him by
[1:03:08] the power of God Amen we need this power
[1:03:13] verse five goes with the service tonight
[1:03:15] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[1:03:18] faith prove your
[1:03:19] ownselves know ye not your own selves
[1:03:23] how that Jesus Christ is in you except
[1:03:25] you be reates Hebrews
[1:03:28] 4:12 says for the word of God is quick
[1:03:33] and powerful and sharper than any
[1:03:36] two-edge sword piercing even to the
[1:03:39] dividing the suer of the soul and the
[1:03:40] spirit and the joints and Marrow and is
[1:03:44] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[1:03:47] of the heart neither is there any
[1:03:50] creature that's not manifest in his
[1:03:53] sight but all things are naked and open
[1:03:56] his his eyes the unto the eyes of him
[1:03:59] with whom we have to do that word power
[1:04:02] in the Greek is dynamus it means Force
[1:04:05] it's inherent power it's used as
[1:04:07] strength even in violence it means
[1:04:10] Mighty power residing in something the
[1:04:14] SC scriptures talk about in different
[1:04:16] places Old Testament and New it's power
[1:04:19] to perform the Miracles power in riches
[1:04:23] power in wealth power in numbers power
[1:04:26] in war those some of those little Wars
[1:04:28] and little fights and little battles
[1:04:29] with Samson and David H was outnumbered
[1:04:32] but they had the power of God on their
[1:04:34] side what about little shamgar shamgar
[1:04:38] jumped out of the window brother bam
[1:04:40] said said they been come coming taking
[1:04:43] his corn every year and he you know he
[1:04:46] would hide his his wheat in the wine
[1:04:48] press there and those Philistines come
[1:04:50] to take his corn and his wheat
[1:04:53] hard-earned labor hard earned earn
[1:04:56] dollars his wealth come to you know
[1:04:59] being stolen once again and then
[1:05:01] something come over him and he realized
[1:05:04] that he was a son of Abraham he was a
[1:05:07] child of God then the Revelation struck
[1:05:10] him don't need an army don't need to
[1:05:13] train to fight all I need is the power
[1:05:16] of
[1:05:18] God brother M says he took an ox
[1:05:21] gold he looked out the window saw them
[1:05:24] coming said he grabbed the ox gold and
[1:05:26] jumped out of the window and beat 600
[1:05:31] Philistines it probably
[1:05:33] 800 he just stopped at 600 the rest
[1:05:36] stopped coming I mean when y'all going
[1:05:38] to figure it out this man ain't going to
[1:05:41] lose 100 fell 200 fell 300 fell he's all
[1:05:46] number 400 or 500 a smart man would be
[1:05:49] like you know what leave this crazy man
[1:05:51] alone let's get back let's get back home
[1:05:55] and and be able to tell the story but
[1:05:57] I'm not going to go heads up with a man
[1:05:58] that just whipped 400
[1:06:01] 500 oh my what did he have behind him
[1:06:05] brother Joe what did he have behind him
[1:06:07] brother Sean what did he have with him
[1:06:10] he had the power of God and that's the
[1:06:14] power that we live by and the preaching
[1:06:17] of the Cross is what delivers us with
[1:06:20] the power of God
[1:06:22] amen amen this is the word that we're
[1:06:25] married to is that right amen so the
[1:06:29] prophet brings this in let me finish
[1:06:32] this quote in the seven Church ages the
[1:06:36] exposition the pergan church age he says
[1:06:38] this
[1:06:39] here they are there they're hybridize
[1:06:42] themselves with Creed and form and there
[1:06:45] is no life in them look at this very
[1:06:47] strong statement as I wind down to close
[1:06:50] so balum got Israel to commit
[1:06:53] fornication
[1:06:55] do you know that physical fornication is
[1:06:59] the very same spirit that lies in
[1:07:02] organized
[1:07:06] religion I said that the spirit of
[1:07:10] fornication is the spirit of
[1:07:13] organization and all fornicators will
[1:07:16] have their place in a lake of fire that
[1:07:18] is what God thinks of organization yes
[1:07:21] sir the and her daughters will be
[1:07:24] in the Lake of Fire
[1:07:26] denominations are not of God they never
[1:07:31] have been and never will be it's a wrong
[1:07:35] spirit that separates the people of God
[1:07:39] into hierarchy and leoy and is therefore
[1:07:43] a wrong spirit that that that that
[1:07:47] separates the people from the people
[1:07:50] that's what organizations and
[1:07:52] denominations do in organizing
[1:07:55] themselves
[1:07:56] from the word of God organizing they
[1:07:59] separate themselves from the word of God
[1:08:02] and bring themselves into
[1:08:05] what spiritual
[1:08:08] adultery far more Far More damning Than
[1:08:13] Physical
[1:08:14] adultery now physical adultery is
[1:08:17] horrible it's a tremendous crime yeah
[1:08:20] but spiritual adultery my
[1:08:23] goodness does that happen
[1:08:26] physical adultery doesn't even have to
[1:08:28] be physical according to St Matthew
[1:08:31] Chapter 5 that we read you can commit
[1:08:33] that by looking and lusting already in
[1:08:36] your heart now bring it up to the level
[1:08:39] of 1 Corinthians 7 and in light of this
[1:08:42] message the invisible Union of the Bride
[1:08:45] if Christ is my husband any flirting
[1:08:48] with the world is
[1:08:53] adulterous it's in nature it's the next
[1:08:56] step to committing adultery and a man
[1:09:00] always does it he has a better idea
[1:09:03] thinks this is you know we have to dress
[1:09:04] this up we have to help God we have to
[1:09:07] fix this we have to do something
[1:09:09] different we have to do what the other
[1:09:11] churches are doing so we follow their
[1:09:13] music programs we follow their music and
[1:09:15] the way they worship before you know
[1:09:17] that we'll be painting our ceilings
[1:09:19] black we have that stage like
[1:09:22] performance before you know it our
[1:09:24] message churches will move right in that
[1:09:26] you know with the open collar and the
[1:09:28] blue jeans Pastor up with the corduroy
[1:09:31] jacket with the cool the cool church and
[1:09:34] the cool pastor with his muscle shirt
[1:09:36] showing it off from the platform that's
[1:09:39] exactly what uh you you'll go into if
[1:09:41] you don't stay with the
[1:09:43] word
[1:09:45] yes
[1:09:47] yes should I keep
[1:09:50] going whose church is this
[1:09:52] anyways it's God's Church
[1:09:56] yes and before you know it you'll be
[1:09:58] going right along with those other
[1:10:00] churches what they're doing but I'm so
[1:10:02] glad it's
[1:10:04] recorded this word is recorded so I can
[1:10:09] stay
[1:10:10] faithful to the word of God the word of
[1:10:14] God that's who I'm married to I must be
[1:10:17] faithful to the word above anybody else
[1:10:22] that's my first love amen
[1:10:26] God help
[1:10:27] us God give us the grace to be
[1:10:31] faithful amen all flirting relationships
[1:10:34] outside of the word is adulterous let me
[1:10:37] say this here about
[1:10:39] worldism I've seen people who have a
[1:10:43] tremendous position in the word
[1:10:47] doctrinally they know the word they
[1:10:49] believe it's true there's no mistakes in
[1:10:51] it they have a good solid stand but they
[1:10:53] still have a worldly Spirit on on
[1:10:56] them so it's one of those sins or crimes
[1:11:00] that you can't really put you as I was
[1:11:03] telling the church this morning you know
[1:11:05] I can walk in you see me in the park
[1:11:08] with my hat on backwards everybody that
[1:11:10] wears their hat on backwards ain't
[1:11:12] wearing it on backwards for the same
[1:11:16] reason or leaning down in my car driving
[1:11:19] through the
[1:11:20] neighborhood is there anything wrong
[1:11:22] with leaning in the car well in certain
[1:11:24] neighborhoods it probably is
[1:11:26] depends on where you're coming from I
[1:11:27] know for me that would be
[1:11:30] worldly even walking through the
[1:11:32] neighborhood I can walk like this like
[1:11:35] what my my friends would call I can walk
[1:11:37] like a
[1:11:39] square or walk like one of the boys walk
[1:11:43] I'm just walking right yeah but there's
[1:11:46] a
[1:11:47] worldly aspect to it and that is
[1:11:50] internal that's what you got to deal
[1:11:52] with in your heart I can't tell you
[1:11:55] sister that was worldly the way you wore
[1:11:57] that but you can wear it worldly and
[1:12:01] walk and do things in a worldly
[1:12:04] atmosphere so this is this is the spirit
[1:12:07] of of worldliness this is the spirit of
[1:12:11] adultery
[1:12:12] adulterous that we want to be faithful
[1:12:15] to far more greater um our relationship
[1:12:19] with the Lord which is the word our
[1:12:21] husband that we're married to that's who
[1:12:23] we want to be faithful to can you say
[1:12:25] Amen how many see
[1:12:28] that now can I go just a little bit
[1:12:31] further I'm finished with this message
[1:12:33] but I shared with you last Sunday and it
[1:12:36] just touched my heart over re
[1:12:38] reexamining the meetings and the fruit
[1:12:40] of the meetings are really really good I
[1:12:42] enjoyed them brother John I think were
[1:12:44] great the Lord really blessed but I feel
[1:12:47] like I missed something because of our
[1:12:49] time you know the time pressurized me
[1:12:53] you know that there was 2 and 1 half
[1:12:54] hour preaching service on Saturday night
[1:12:57] it was brother Ferguson I
[1:12:59] believe
[1:13:01] and while I was in the service one of
[1:13:03] the people that's not really in the word
[1:13:05] yet but they were
[1:13:08] there they sent me a text I'm
[1:13:12] hungry when is the service going to be
[1:13:15] over I'm sitting on the front row and I
[1:13:18] wanted to text him back and say we all
[1:13:21] hungry but and maybe if we didn't have
[1:13:25] have food to serve at the end some folks
[1:13:27] would have
[1:13:28] left but we can't leave we got food next
[1:13:31] door so it was a long service and so I
[1:13:34] get up and I thank the Lord for it
[1:13:35] wonderful service but I felt the
[1:13:37] pressure and I didn't even give an altar
[1:13:38] call didn't give an altar call and I
[1:13:41] mentioned that to you all on Sunday kind
[1:13:44] of you know that pressure people getting
[1:13:47] up people looking at their watch it's
[1:13:48] long service and I'm going to hear it
[1:13:50] it's a long service brother Israel but
[1:13:52] like where are you going anyways you're
[1:13:54] going to eternity and the service is
[1:13:57] already
[1:13:58] long at that point it don't get late
[1:14:00] until 2 after that it's too late as
[1:14:03] brother Al would say I mean it it's
[1:14:06] already late you're already there so why
[1:14:11] frown why
[1:14:13] begrudgingly stay in your praise so
[1:14:16] anyways um I I was thinking about that
[1:14:20] so I got into this message here and I
[1:14:22] brought it for Thanksgiving then I came
[1:14:24] back the next uh I think it was Monday
[1:14:26] or so it just real strong in my heart
[1:14:28] early in the morning I started listening
[1:14:30] to it again and I went through the
[1:14:32] entire message so after two hours of
[1:14:36] preaching brother brandom takes 20
[1:14:39] minutes on an altar call
[1:14:43] 1965 okay those of us that are are
[1:14:46] saying that those altar calls are over
[1:14:49] go get this message and that let that be
[1:14:51] your example not me not somebody else he
[1:14:53] takes 20 minutes on an altar call and as
[1:14:56] he gives the altar call he um says that
[1:15:01] my the altar just has men because the
[1:15:04] sisters believe I'm against them I'm not
[1:15:06] against you sister um and there's two or
[1:15:09] three sisters and then you can see hear
[1:15:10] that the altar filled
[1:15:13] up and then as the altar is filling up
[1:15:15] brother branner is laboring and praying
[1:15:18] with the people he already preached two
[1:15:20] hours it's a special meetings he knows
[1:15:22] he had held him long he's that brother
[1:15:24] Jack More's Pulpit is kind of in a
[1:15:26] hostile environment but I'm so glad he
[1:15:29] stayed faithful to what he had to say
[1:15:31] and he held that crowd until somebody
[1:15:35] came to the front that needed to come to
[1:15:38] the front and then as he's laboring in
[1:15:41] this his message is over and he's
[1:15:43] praying for the people and he's he makes
[1:15:45] the statement he says um he says yes
[1:15:48] that's right come on out the move is on
[1:15:50] then he says thus sayeth the Lord the
[1:15:53] move is on for the bride that little
[1:15:57] statement was hanging in the altar after
[1:16:00] the preaching of the word and so many
[1:16:02] times we miss those precious words
[1:16:06] because we're faithful to everything
[1:16:08] else but to our husband Christ the word
[1:16:13] we'll give our job more time we'll give
[1:16:15] our children more time we'll give our
[1:16:17] own Leisure more time but what about

[1:16:22] to a church you're married to

[1:16:38] Us in these tremendous
[1:16:42] truths you pray you listen to that
[1:16:44] message yourself and you tell me how it
[1:16:47] affects you and I trust and believe that
[1:16:50] it will thus sayeth the Lord the mo can

[1:19:50] by but let me let me rekindle my first
[1:19:54] love with with you the first
[1:19:57] love Lord when you saved me it was the
[1:19:59] greatest thing that could ever happen to
[1:20:01] me never thought never knew love like
[1:20:05] that never knew what a power of like
[1:20:08] that could do I'd heard about it I felt
[1:20:11] it sometimes but when you came down upon
[1:20:13] me and you changed me I never knew a
[1:20:17] love like that and father you've been
[1:20:20] faithful and I have not been faithful

[1:20:45] made for us in this hour I never knew
[1:20:48] that adultery was even that that deep as
[1:20:52] what Jesus said what you said in your
[1:20:54] word to look in the lust you committed

[1:26:34] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:26:36] that bread and drink of that
[1:26:39] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:42] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
