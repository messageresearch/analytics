as we come to this portion of the service Lord I pray father that you would bless every heart as we take the time to look at the great life of uh this servant John hus Lord is placed upon our hearts may you bless uh what we hear Lord and father we truly want to draw closer to you as our prayer as we hear of another Soldier that's gone on good friend of mine after the Sunday morning service today he was called home just like that young man and father that's how that's how we'll all leave here one by one and father we just want our lives and our Deeds to be pleasing in your sight that's all that matters is that you are pleased with what we're doing help us father to focus on that and let that be our motivation we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you well I had on my heart it came to me to um play this little movie of John hust I think many of us have saw it before and heard it before but I was yesterday uh preparing after the prayer meeting I went and got this book John hus it it was actually brother Carl Wheeler's book it was a load of books I like brother Mam's work and there's some other books and it's been in this safe for some quite some time and I was just straighten some things up so I picked it up and I started looking through it yesterday and um to the day he was burned at the Stak on July the 6 and that really struck me that I you know all that time that I looked through there and so I wanted to read a scripture July the 6 19 14 uh or 1415 he was burned to the stake there um 600 years ago 609 years and I wanted us to take a scripture and read just before we go there I ask you to stand the turn in Hebrews chapter 11 and Revelations chapter 2 and just the the life of this great uh Saint and as I was reading through the book really really interesting it's an old one very old book it's published in 1915 so 500 years after his uh martyr he was burned at the stake as a heretic there in constant the constant Council burned him at the stake there in Bohemia in the Czech Republic um it is um quite striking how in Hebrews 11 it speaks of these great soldiers Heroes of the faith I believe brother random calls them and I like to read there in verse number 32 and what shall I more say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barack and Samson and jeffa David also and Samuel and other prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms rot righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortur not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and of others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment there were ston they were saw asunder they were tempted slain with the sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being T destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtain a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen think of that Revelations chapter 2 to the saman church age and verse number eight and unto the angel of the church and Smyrna right these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy Works in Tribulation and poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated just for a moment you know this great um soldiers that were Martyrs and I I thought it was something how the Lord just led me to you know to pick up this book and see the life of this great Saint and soldier that was burned at the stake there and then thinking and going deeper into the research there were many that were of his same belief they just didn't have the strength to take that stand many turned When Death was placed to them you know they tried to get him he was in prison for many days this Soldier this saint of the Lord um John hus he was a priest and as the Lord was opening his eyes to truth he began to preach that and he preached it to the people and it started to reach the Common People the prostitutes even the queen there and many of the his his sermons reached outside of the church walls it started to grow and he started to minister into the people's language and as God began to deal with him and work with him you know the enemy put pressure they arrested him false charges were raised against him and he sat in this prison for many days his friends came to him and asked him to recant many times because what good are you dead when you can be alive to preach the gospel and the good news and the enemy many times he thinks that setting John on fire that that would put it out but what it happens is not only did he set John on fire he set the movement on fire it spreads and they try to wipe this man's memory out of the mind of the people they burned his ashes took his ashes every scrap of it and threw it in the river so the people couldn't have a relic to follow him but that just impressed in their Memories the more and so your life speaks even if you leave from here and that's the power of what we stand for and what we believe and I was thinking about the character of the men what kind of man am I in that climate all your friends all the others are going this way and here's the pressure on the new found truth am I able to stand I sure hope I'm able to I sure believe I'm able to and I certainly want God to give me that Grace and Faith to stand I want to read in the message it's in the smin church age book I'm going to take my time so don't rush me okay I'm going to take this Merin Church age book and read this and this as brother random takes this scripture in Revelations chapter 2 and and he uh begins to uh show the relationship between those that strive daily and those that actually are Martyrs that will give their life some of us actually may have to give our lives blood we don't think of it that way but it's still the truth and um it's just a matter just like that it can happen come in here arrest us for something we said and then a lie then a false witness and before you know it um things can change quite quickly I'll take this um in the spurn and Church age paragraph number uh it's not a paragraph that you would have but I'll start reading it says Thou shalt have tribulation 10 days in the church age book here is a prophecy and with it is a means of determining the lifespan of the saman age Dian the cruelest of all Emperors launched a terror campaign against the Saints of God that except for the mercy of God would have wiped out all Believers it was the bloodiest in history and lasted 10 years the 10 days Revelations chapter 2 verse 10 from 302 to 312 be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until death but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yeah Millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like Antipas the faithful marterer that held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to Triumph in Christ Jesus is the same faith that upholds the polyc carps and all the martyrs the Supreme faith will give Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour blessed be God forever and I will give thee a crown of life since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the Lord fails to receive a reward how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the Lord Jesus perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown with the crown one in a race know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that you may obtain 1 Corinthians 9:24 a crown given to the winner of the Olympic race was a Garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in the Revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty Jesus calls it the Crown of Life The One Crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are Incorruptible they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plotts of the world their Glory will fail but those who give their lives for God either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the Crown of Life all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the thankful Saints amen amen thank God for his word and uh we'll go to that turn the lights and I trust this will be a blessing a blessing to all of you amen amen our life is a life that we live daily for him amen God bless [Music] you the 15th century marked the turning
