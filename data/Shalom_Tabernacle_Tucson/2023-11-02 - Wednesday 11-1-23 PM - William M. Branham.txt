time frame I think he's still on plus n or so hours ahead so told me the other day to find a tape I don't take take that light and you know it's hard to come before God's people know exactly what to play but it's hard but it's easy if you know what I me brother John that anything we do would be acceptable and and pleasing I believe but we want to just find the mind of the Lord and I think we have it come follow me it kind of fit the time frame that we have tonight it was preached in Tucson we haven't heard it and as you know so this was 63 June if I remember correctly and so of course the end of 62 brother brandom preaches I just heard this one um is this the end time sir he talks about the visions and the things that are to be and then those things came to be in Tucson and the the cloud and the revelation of the Seven Seals these things and he always took those doctrines back to his home Church the Jeffersonville but he talks about a few of those things here in Tucson and 63 as well so it would be nice to come follow me we're all following somebody who are you following tonight let's follow our precious Lord and Savior the message of the hour the things that he's revealed and delivered to us amen amen amen God bless you little quieter little smaller crowd on Wednesday but no matter we come expecting and he'll just fill us right up tonight where we need to be so God bless you welcome each one appreciate each one tonight we'll sing brother brandom's theme song as we prepare only be only be all things things are [Music] possible only believe only me ho [Music] believe all things are possible only amen God's Prophet brother brandham you can be seated no before Becky is born and so I I thought well you know I I just eat a bowl of oatmeal cost a dime well I just they gave me my ticket and just signed it to see I paid for it give it back and I turned it in because I had an expense count and one day when we had a a patrolman's meeting my they said who's this nut that turn in something like that see the head guy you know 10 cents for a breakfast so that looks real cheap on the other Fells you know some of them turn in a dollar see $2 for a dinner and I turn into just exactly what it was well I said well there's no need of me turning in what would I do if I just eat 10 cents Mr fields which is assistant superintendent he said Billy turn it in a dollar anyhow at least that's what the rest of them do and said you got to keep that together well I said I I never eat but just a little old meal that's what I charge for I said oh don't never do that well then I thought what will I do with it then I charge 50 cents for breakfast and I take 40 cents left get some kids on the street some kids you know look like they need a sandwich I thought maybe I might have uh right that was a company itself talking to me like that that's a man out of the company so I thought maybe I I did something wrong so here not long ago uh with a patrolman now they P control of a helicopters you see so he came by and stopped he said to say brother Bram said this tree is growing us yeah I said kids playing with that out there I said can we top it I said yeah but don't cut it down see he said Well we'd like to cut it we pay for it I no no don't want you cut it well I know the laws are right away too you know cuz that it's on it seven years and I said no I said I don't want to cut but you can top it I said I I keep it top but I said you can you can top it if you want to I said I brother woods and I fix to top it we top all these others along here and I said but we'd like to keep that there on kind of kids Joel and you know little Fell's playing on that tree I went away on a trip when I come back she sawed down and moved out oo what a suit that would have been on the company you see for cutting that tree you see and so I thought now I said Lord I'm not going to even mention that see whether if there is anything that I that I on that sometimes turnning in only eating a dime have turning 50 cents see I said if there is something on that let that make it up see that I I I put that in you see that I and I quit dreaming about being a Public Service Company then see because it must have been something back in there we have to watch what we do we got to meet it someday kids come over here your mother was over the day Trudy I guess you didn't you didn't know this is kind of little surprising see and um you're fixed to graduate and we've had this trip out here together I'll go into a meeting now immediately after this meeting we're going home I thought it' be a good chance to talk to you all and then also thought it' be good to speak to the kids just a little bit before your graduation read a verse out of the Bible and just talk to you from my heart for about 10 minutes I'll step out of your way see um before I talk to the kids I just like to talk to the adults just a minute the two all of you it's um been a perhaps maybe a strous trip it's been um but the experience that I've learned from God I wouldn't take $10,000 for what I learned of the Lord since I've been here I truly believe I come in full obedience to the command of the almighty and uh I hope I can ever remain that way and there's a when I come one thing was by a vision that I standing above Tucson up here when uh a blast went off brother Fred was there when it went off and uh they took a picture you know in the sky and I didn't think much about it never noticed it so it began to impress me somehow the day and brother Norman Norman's Father Here told me said did you notice this and just as it look right there was that angel just as plain as they could be sitting right there that picture to see look see what it was It's Time same about day or two before day or two after I up there now look where it was that Northeast of flag safe or Prescott which is below flag safe well that's just where we at just exactly 26 miles high while Vapor can't go over over four four miles high or five moisture any kind of fog or anything you see planes flying 19,000 has to get above all the clouds you see in 19,000 is about 4 MI high this is 26 Mi high and 30 Mi across it and in the shape of the pyramid if you've looked at the picture and on the right hand side as I told you I noticed outstanding that angel there he is chest out Wings back coming right in just exactly the way it was I never know where s when it first there been so many things as and coming down the road the other day there was something happened that's spoke to me about the thing that I I must do and it's uh it's not my message one time Leo Mercer said said brother brand the time will come after this said about five or six years ago maybe seven said the Lord go to change your ministry brother Brandman said when he does said you'll probably just line up hospitals and speak them out of the the beds and things it didn't sound right although I believe brother Leo was trying to be sincere about it but it didn't down just right because see our lord Jesus never did that see and he went into the hospitals there was one in that hospital do you remember what is that in the Bible the pool of Bethesda great multitudes of of important people laid there lame blind withered waiting for the angel now that was in a spiritual hospital where people waited on Divine Healing and you hear the Divine healer himself came in and heal one walked out so you couldn't expect a martal man or a Ministry to come forth to be any greater than that was see I couldn't agree with it but as I started turn around the Holy Spirit come up me I asked Leo for a pen I got a piece of paper and I wrote it it's in his trailer today if you ever reports that it's that old luminum trailer where he had the loading outfit just as you go IND door the shelf on the right hand side right in front of the trailer laying under there I laid up there said someday you can pull this out God will never change the Ministry but he'll change the man with the ministry that's what's to be done see I I know what I've got to do but I I I can't I can't do it in the condition that I am now because I've got to something's got to happen within me that'll take God to do it we're a to go back home kids are homesick all them want to go back so I'm figuring on taking them back Lord will maybe after service Saturday and uh so uh go back from there I don't know but I know as soon as that something happens within me to make me feel towards people different from what I do now I had rejected the the people see and I I didn't want to have no more to do with them you know what I mean what I call Ricky and ricketta they had the things that they had did I preached with all the sincerity and God had confirmed it in every way and if they didn't want to believe it well let them alone then I was going to join up with bud it's coming fall start outfitting up there wait in the wilderness let my hair and beards grow out and if the Lord BN me go where he send me a word and I go down and do it and on the road coming down the other day he stop me and I seen where the what of was coming to um I'm on my road to something else now and I thought when I got home I'd make what we call a heart-to-heart talk maybe put it on tape and then uh so the public would see why the sudden change now you kids let's just uh let's have a little word of prayer Lord Jesus we are grateful for this time to know that we're assembled here the young and old and the middle-aged and we have assembled this side of Eternity once more to speak about you and about the things that pertains to everlasting life these young ones sitting in here tonight some of them are graduating some is already graduated but I realized Lord something had happened just a few hours before that great shock or great blast had taken place in the mountain up there north of Tucson when the angels of the Lord came down I remember what was said and especially about the young people I pray the Lord help us to understand and may I be able to say something to these young folks tonight that'll help them along the journey for Lord we all need that help at this time bless us together forgive our sins and if anything that we've done since we've been out here that's displeased you we pray you forgive us for it for we realize today that we have no no guarantee of Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow brings we must be prepared today to meet tomorrow and father God there's only one way that we know to do this that's to prepare to see you for by and by we realize that we are all going to do it and we've got to meet it sometime either in peace as a friend or child or as an enemy far be it Lord that we be anything else but your own beloved children Grant these things we ask in Jesus name amen today while I was chopping weeds really early this morning I found a place in the Bible I thought would be a good thing to read at this time and it's uh may not be too dashing appropriate but I thought this for just a just a few minutes to talk I'm going to read this out of 18th chapter of St Luke all four gospel writers write of it the 18th chapter and the 18th verse and a certain ruler asked him saying good Master what shall I do to inherit eternal life life and Jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is God th knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and mother he said all these have I done and kept them from my youth up now when Jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all thou has and distribute unto the poor thou shall have Treasures in Heaven come follow me I think the word come follow me that' be the best advice I could give if I was talking to 10,000 kids or if I was talking to just what I am it's a command and the greatest thing that I think was ever offered anybody and especially a young person follow me you're going to follow somebody uh you just can remember that you're going to follow somebody and the way you follow the person be sure that who this person's following see we Paul one time said be followers of me as I am of Christ in other words just as I follow Christ you follow me and now at this turning point this this stage of life where we all come and many times you've heard me holler Ricky Retta and things that it's the age it's the age that we're living in it really isn't those people those people are people like we are those kids out here these hot rods running up down the street and carrying all the way they are smoking cigarettes and drinking liquor girls dressed in morly and them girls and boys like we are see they're human they love they eat they drink they sleep they breathe they got to die they're people just like we are and yet they have been uh they've been possessed of an evil spirit they don't know it not because of of the people but because sometimes some leader that they've been following have leted him in the wrong road now you girls and boys no better than that you know you've been taught better than that's got better parents Sounder training than to do a thing like that you know better but they don't see because the churches that they go to uh are modern churches modernistic and they they just live for the day more poer and all my heart's the morals become virtue to them see so they what is it said one time in a play that I seen down here not long ago of Solomon Gomorrah that uh evil possessed woman said to to lot what you call imor I call virtue Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be at the coming of the son of man so we're back to that place again let's look at this fell for a few minutes that we read about no doubt that this kid was born in a good home like you kids are he's brought up with good parents because it proved it when Jesus uh presented to him the Commandments of God he said I've kept the since a youth it showed that he had he had been he' been brought ight he wasn't just a snatch out and you know he had been brought up to know what kids like you all are probably come up under a God-fearing Mother and Daddy to tr to to teach him right when he was a kid well that's good maybe it's a a little baby his mother uh had high Ambitions of him being a great man someday his father's worth money that could School him and and get him an education that he could he'd come out with a good education to be able to be something in the world and with the sincerity of this mother and dad uh educating this kid and perhaps come to his graduation time like you are see the time that he passed through school had his education no doubt perhaps was the pride and joy of of that mother and daddy's life no doubt in them days he had a fine horses like you have automobiles a good dad mother like you all got that ceas to eat you got good clothes and and a car and can just enjoy life just something like you have today and the father and mother with the praying constantly that that their son would not turn out just an ordinary man that he'd be an extraordinary man all parents want that did you hear Jesus refer to that commandment honor the father and mother and stop and that's the ambition of any parent to do the best for their children to can educate them give them things maybe they wasn't able to get that's what I feel about my children I think sometime in going to school now I think send Becky and Sarah and Joseph into these high schools and things where all this go on at I think I'll take them and get back into the mountain and and raise them up there if they let the Indians live but here's what it is what's the end the kids going to come out no matter where it is it's got It's going to come out if it's evil in there it will come out in the Indian Camp if it's good in there it'll come out in any Camp see see it's what's in the kid the makeup of the kid what's on the inside of you and what you are now is what you're probably be the rest of your life you're on the changing spot do you know one 86% of the conversions to Jesus Christ is done before 21 years old shows the statistic shows it 86% that come to Christ come before they're 21 you as you pass that age you become more molded or set in your ways well it's possible sure they come 70 80 years old but it's very rare that you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions to what you want to do and what you're trying to achieve in life you think of it and as you think of course your mind it's presented into your mind by an unknown something that it dominates your mind and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it that you're going to do it then your Ambitions drive you to it so mother and father expecting this young man to his Ambitions to be great enough money to Carri it out and then no doubt prayed that this this young lad would would get that opportunity you see they they had done all they could do he maybe having fine horses and and maybe he's very popular among of women and if what would go for a man would be for a woman vice versa see because we're taught by human life Souls both men and women and then after all this opportunity the boy had see he become on easy street we call it on a place where he he didn't have to worry about too much his parents had money he had he has very he become a ruler the Bible refers to it here the as a Young Rich Young Ruler and we see at a young age Maybe in his teenage just out of school just out of graduation maybe a few weeks before or something he become a he's a ruler and uh he had all that Hearts could desire and the boy wasn't no modern Ricky he's a fine kid I believe when Luke wrote about it or Mark I believe it was Jesus looked at him inside because he loved him there's something about the kid there was a nice personality hook with his kid where did he come from out of a nice family who had taught him the Commandments of God and SE that he kept them and he did it from his youth up and the boy had an ambition he wanted eternal life he said a good Master what could I do to inherit eternal life see with all you got in the world yet the Soul on the inside of it tells you there's something that you need that you're having got just by wealth or it always had to be wealth it could be po or some pretty girl she's got her beauty that she can think of maybe she's very popper in school maybe the boy can get any girl he wants he feels it he's kind of secured that's not security it'll fade just like the flower in the field See it'll go won't be long just a few turns the sun that's gone then you got a soul that has to live eternally and this young kid must had a nice personality because he presented himself to the Lord Jesus name he bowed upon his knee he said good Master What could I do to have eternal life he said why do you call me good said when you know there's only one good and that's God see what the young man expressing this that he was God see he said you thou know it's the Commandments keep them said say said what Commandments Master he said the Commandments of honor the father and mother and so forth he said this I've done from the youth up see I've did this he said yet you're liking one thing go sell what you have and distribute to the poor and follow me what an opportunity that could have been Peter James or John in the ram see the kid have been trained and brought upright and been presented to Christ to use him and all the potential that he had in him to use probably educated Young Rich influenc where he could have presented the gospel and yet turned it down what a what a rational thing that was for that young boy see follow me I see he had to follow someone now he had to either follow the influence of the people he's associated with the influence of some young lady the some influence of a gang of boys that he has associated with his colleagues in school or follow Jesus Christ and all of his goodness yet he knew he didn't have eternal life kids that's what you got to think about see now look at the boy tonight what he could have been and what he is what he is tonight he's somewhere he was a man he he's somewhere he's waiting a judgment he's waiting to face the Judgment at that day turning down the same opportunities presented to you kids almost under the same circumstance fine kids good personality find fathers and mothers what you have don't even have to workless you want to see but there's something else that goes with that and something goes with that that word tonight Never Dies it's still a challenge to every young man every young woman follow me see words don't die whenever you speak anything you just remember whether it's in your car in the secret whether it's in the Pulpit whether it's down the street corner with your boyfriend or girlfriend wherever it is it never dies it's it's got to live forever I seen that girl that I other night in the vision young pretty girl a Hollywood actress and I've seen her dying reaching trying to get the help and she died in a heart attack Miss Monro and then that's been two years ago and I seen her D and two days later she did die and then the other night I heard that girl's voice how the kids have been telling me Daddy you go down that River no return all the time said they got a play like that on tonight they told me a certain night it would be on a week or two ahead of time and I thought well I want to see that cuz I've been down that River two or three times about five times I think but I I went to see it in this mman Ro acted that out well that was the girl I saw in the vision and there she was in picture and the actions the very act that she made on the River of No Return she talk that picture perhaps 15 years ago an old picture maybe 20 years ago and she's been dead two years and There She is again alive every action and every word see it's still so caught in Magnetic Tape until it's alive again not only that but everything that we say is alive every word that we speak cannot die coming through the room is words now forms of people television picks it up you speak right here and then hear you around the world that same second even before you can hear it in this room it goes around the world by electronic and God's Great screen picks that up and every move and every act that you make you've got to me it at the Judgment see so young fell it's a good thing to stop think about these things see because you're going to meet it again let's trace this young man the opportunity he had and put yourself in his place and a girl this same as this Becky and Maryland just like just the same as you stand in his place and you can hear that voice which is still alive it's still alive it's still moving science says in 20 years now they pick up his literal voice that he spoke 2,000 years ago it's still alive like a pebble dropped in the ocean the wave never ceases it goes to the shore thousands of miles and turns back when a voice is once spoke into the air like that it never dies there ain't nothing you said to judge judement is right there there will be the voice of Jesus Christ bidding that young man follow me and him turning away on the screen sorrowful because he had great possession see we might not be always has to be money it can be other things see anything we hold dear than we do that call see it becomes lack of money to us it becomes something that corrupts us now let's follow him a little bit what happens when he turns away he didn't listen to that voice of Christ he went with his friends which you kids you're all fine kids and you're bound to have friends but watch what kind of friend you have if that friend's fallowing Christ go with that friend follow Christ to but if it don't don't do it let's look at him we find out he perhaps kept his friends he become a great ruler he was a ruler then later we find him so prosperous on until he he had to build extra barns to put his stuff in and then he said to himself after he got old and the cares of young life and things has passed all he done maybe was entertain when an old man an old woman like me my wife your mother's and dad there isn't hardly anything that they can think of they can't don't want to get out and and run up and down the streets you know it's young fellas would and young women dates and who's going to be your wife for your husband or see they don't have that in their mind they they got children they're interested that's going to be you all tomorrow if there is a tomorrow and uh see the fellow then with maybe maybe he never even got married and however he was a great ruler and he set up on and his is in Jerusalem yet the day they eat on the housetop this time of day when it get cool out the evening and we we find another character pictured with him a beggar and the man from being raised uh to honor the neighbor and do unto others as have others to do unto you see by rejecting that call of Christ finally look like a boy been raised in a home like that that would never got away from him but it did it did and there laid a man at the gate by the name of Lazarus begging him for food and vainly he would have eat the crumbs that he swept off not even to the beggar but to the dogs and was full of sores but the man had been so Polished in society then he had no more feelings he become numb because he' rejected that offer of Christ and maybe one evening this time making his toast with Fine Wines and lovely women's jeweled around him and things like that with all his Hearts could desire and toting a bler laying at the gate and before daylight Dawn the next morning he was in Hell screaming for that Lazarus to come put water on his tongue the Chang of the scene and you notice when he said Father Abraham now he still remembered that Abraham was the father of the Jews he said Father Abraham sand that beggar Lazarus down here's a little water on his fingers to put on my lips these Flames are tormenting and he said uh and Abraham said I can't do that in so many words and besides all this you see you had your opportunity in life when did he have it when Jesus said follow me but he turned it down he went the way that he can make money and that's all right nothing wrong with making money but follow Jesus while you're doing it see and he went the other way with the crowd and you find out he said and Abraham said and besides all this he's a go fixed between you and he that no man has ever crossed over and never will then that are there cannot come here and these here cannot go there it's been fixed no man has crossed or will cross then listen that he he wants to be an evangelist then the call that Jesus had given him to to follow him had and to be a soul in her as a Young Man returned to him again he remember remembered it that he had five brothers and back on Earth and he didn't want them in that place he said send Lazarus then back to tell my brothers not to come this way in other words except the call of follow me but he said they they won't do it he said yes if one would raise the dead like Lazarus and go back and tell him you see it shows that after we die you're still con ious he remembered Abraham said Son remember in your days see you still remember you don't lose your memory you remember and the memories that man could have and still in the same place remember the opportunity he had of hearing Jesus say follow me but he followed the wrong person the wrong crowd he got in the wrong crowd and went to the wrong place end up in the wrong eternity be annihilated at that day from God forever Jesus also said a great striking word though one rais from the dead and go back yet they would not be persuaded because they've got Moses in the law and if they won't hear that then they won't you're though one would be raised from the dead they will not be persuaded why why did the law speak something like that yes do to others as you have them do unto you and he had lived under the law law but he let the beggar die at the gate see he he lived under the Commandments of God and yet failed to see that great eternal life kids each one seem like mine you each one seem like this my sons and daughters in one way you are spiritually speaking that's right the Lord God has has put your souls into my care because you come listen to me you believe me see and in one sense words you are my sons and daughters that's right always remember keeping the Commandments of God is a great thing being raised in a good home is a Heritage from God and to be fine kids with personalities as you have good wonderful to have an education it's a wonderful even live in this free land we got a many things to be thankful far but there's one thing that you just don't inherit you've got to accept it that's eternal life and you only do that by following Jesus by a born again experience don't neglect that a little story one time I heard of a man who all he was poor and he he always wanted to it's a little fairy story like always stuck with me though and one day he picked a flower and the flower was magic and the flower answered to him and said you've been poor all your life he said now um ask what you will and it'll be given to you he said that yonder's mountain would open up and I could go there in and find the gold in the mountain well the he said you will have to take me with you wherever you go see you'll have to take me with you so wherever I am then you can ask what you will he walked to the mountain and the mountain opened up and he went into shells was full of gold and diamonds as a little fairy story goes he laid the flower down on a on a table or a rock and he run and grabbed the great big gy and he said I must go show this to my friend friends and now I'm a rich man I have everything now I'm going show this and so the flower spoke that said you have forgot the main thing so he runs back and picks up said well uh maybe I'll I'll get a piece of gold I get a piece of silver and so he said uh I'll I'll hurry out to tell the people how rich I am what all I've got and he got to the door and the flower said but you forgot the main thing so he runs back again he said in here we find all kinds of materials so he picked up a stone he said I'll go take this Stone and show the people what kind of a stone this Mountain's made out of so I can find my way back to it see and he started out the door and the flower said for the it's final time you have forgot the main thing oh he said oh shut up see he didn't want to hear it anymore forgot the the main thing and he ran out the door and when he did the door closed behind him with the flower on the inside the main thing was the flower see the main thing was the flower years ago as a kid as you all are here cattle range above here those genix I was reading a piece of the prospect a paper about a prospector then there was no roads to here then this little sand path they still do a lot of prospecting in here you know but this prospector had come in and he found a lot of money and he struck a lot of gold and on his Road in he stayed in a cabin he' found and he had a dog with him and uh the dog tied up on the outside and that night had been an outlaw following him to get this skull he picked it up no Spanish mind and he was um coming in with it and uh the dog started barking and the man didn't want to be bothered with that dog he said uh shut up he said tomorrow I'll take this into to the city and morals the story was this and I'll have it uh weighed up and I'll be a rich man and I'll buy great cars and I'll have all kinds of women and big parties and I'll be a rich man because I've already struck the the claim I've got the gold here much of it and said ah and while he was trying to go to sleep the dog kept barking because the dog seen the outlaw coming up spping up waiting for the prospector to go to sleep he raised up again and screamed at the dog again said shut up and the poor dog whined and tried to warn his master the danger waser lurking and when he the next time when the dog started barking the prospector had a shotgun he didn't want to be bothered so he just raised up and shot the dog and the prospector was killed that night by The Outlaw all of his fancy dreams done him no good why he still the voice that was warning him there's nobody can try to do anything your kids would never be able to do anything wrong after being raised the way you are unless you feel something tell you not to do it I don't never steal that voice that's warning and always remember except that voice that said follow me and you'll always come out right I believe you will I got confidence in you but just always remember at Jesus that voice is alive in the Earth tonight just the same as every voice every word we spoke is still alive when that voice goes on that ether wave of the air see you got a transmitter here that sends it out you are the transmitter that sends it out now it takes a station to pick it up and Jesus was a transmitter of God's word for he was the the trunity of God manifested in one man he was complete God and complete man in the Trinity of God the Trinity of the attributes of God God as being Father Son and Holy Spirit was represented in that one man Jesus Christ so there he was the word and he was the transmitter that said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life see verely I say unto you he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life now that words went out from a transmitter he said one day verely I send if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said now if you can just be the station to pick that up by the some control inside of you by faith it'll move you right into the cycle of God to the new birth and be born again then you'll always be in contact to hear that voice that'll always warn you when dangers along when things are wrong going wrong it'll always be a warning to you and then instead of someday being like that rich young boy that we're speaking of be a man like Apostle Peter Paul or somebody that one souls for Jesus Christ you do that kids can we pray Lord Jesus youth men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them Lord we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow if there is not then today is the day and then father we know that no one is accepted in your sight no flesh can Glory no education although as good as these things may be no good works no religious institution no psychology no nothing can confirm God but the Holy Spirit he's the instrument God himself in a form of eternal life that can come to us as an individual we are thankful for This truly is expressed when Peter made the confession and Jesus said to flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you never learned it in a seminary you never learned it in some school it's a personal thing something that each individual has to receive you set up on this rock I build my church and the Gates of Hell will not be able to overcome it we're thankful for that Lord that voice is still alive tonight and there are still post outposts listening posts receiving stations of faith that can accepted we pray that each one of these children will receive that Lord in their hearts and remember that not what they do to be good but they God does not judge us by what we do but by what we have accepted we are saved by our faith and not in our works so we pray heavenly father that they'll catch the vision now and see and hear that great uh Eternal uh invitation of come follow me May each one of them Lord turn aside from all the things of the world this Mortal fringy life as they he tonight in their golden BL blond hair and some of them with their black hair and dark eyes and blue eyes and setting in their very best of there'll ever be and as a great writer said remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nigh then Thou shalt have no pleasure in them how Lord Jesus you said to Peter when you were young you got up and went where you wanted to but when you get old someone packs you where you would not go let them remember
