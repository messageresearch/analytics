that would like to be here those that are on their way father we just ask your blessings upon each one we love you we thank you you in Jesus name amen God bless you you have your Bibles I'm going to move to this mic here says Amy man I want to thank the Lord for the meetings we just come through it's been a tremendous success in my opinion I feel like the Lord was blessed and he really uh the Lord did it has done done and is doing some mighty great things for us through those through the ministering Gifts of his word the presence of the Lord and so we certainly appreciate that I want to just take a two places in the scripture St John 1426 and just maybe touch on a few things from the meetings this weekend as a reminder What the Lord Has Done For Us St John 14 verse 20 six we take verse number 23 if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him he that loveth me not keepeth not my says and the word which you hear is not not mine but the father's which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you amen thank the Lord for the comforter that will teach us second Peter chapter 1 this was kind of one of the keynote themes of our meetings it's the statue of a perfect man uh where brother bam takes this scripture and preaches the statue of a perfect man and in verse um number four we take take verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto I'm sorry uh let's see pardon me second Peter yeah chapter one verse two Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that ha called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust this is what brother Paul was bringing on Saturday morning and besides this is giving all diligence add to your faith virtue to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but he that lacketh these things is blind cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth amen and that's what we just want to bring you to remembrance of some of these things though we may know them but they are to establish Us in the present truth God bless you you may be seated and thank God for the reading of his word amen we certainly as I said appreciate the the meetings that we had and of course they didn't come without a sacrifice and without a a test and without great cost um physically and so forth there's a number of folks that are out sick tonight and weary in their bodies I tell you on Saturday night I had a headache that I hadn't had for I don't know I don't remember having a headache that bad for years terrible splitting headache and I know was part of my my tiredness and part of the stress and the hustle and bustle of the meeting and I know my face didn't look too good I tried to make it look good but I know my head was hurting so bad I got in the back office with Brother John and we prayed for the service as we normally do and he got out he started singing I was just going to wait back there and I decided to come out as we start singing I think it's the first song we started singing I lifted my hand it started just to Worship the Lord and it just immediately broke off of me and I just enjoy the rest of the service and quite frankly I enjoy the rest of the meetings and so I thank the Lord for that amen um but on Friday night as we know brother whisper brought that beautiful message on zerubba Bell and uh part one and then part two and really the message if you bring them both together he was bringing this message of the stature of a perfect man the new birth being filled with the Holy G ghost being born again making our way to the adoption and I'd like to encourage you to go back and listen to three primary messages that will help you and one of them was the message that he was quoting out of the message of Grace We're going to play a portion of that for you tonight the message of Grace preached in um 1963 I believe 62 63 and the other is uh statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names and blasphemous names really the first part of it because the message Blasphemous names he's going to go into uh Revelations and talking about the names of blasphemy and the denominational churches but really the first part of the message he is opening up what he brought in this message a statute of a perfect man so I call it part one and part two statue of a perfect man and then Blasphemous names go back and hear those again I just love how the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a continual yes sir and it's an experience upon experience and we had meetings here on the Holy Ghost we had a prayer line for that we listened to those last messages of 1959 for the purpose of bringing us into receiving the Holy Ghost brother banam did it for his own Tabernacle and there's a lot that goes with it and I think and I believe that bringing all that together will be a blessing to you brother Paul takes the scriptures in uh Luke 17:26 Genesis chapter 6 and 2 Timothy 3 chapter 1 talks about the perilous times and the Darkness of the age what I would uh like to encourage us to do is to go back and go through those messages that we heard because what what will happen is it was good it was nice but then we won't adjust or change our lives based on what we heard and that was a lot that we heard and I I have to say that they were not running the owls jumping dancing like that and I think we only had one alter call for the whole service meetings that was the Saturday night of course the altar is always open so it wasn't one of those Services where all the young people came up it wasn't one of those Services where we had a prayer line uh where we emptied every road and pray for the sick like that but I think it was one of the major messages or meeting meetings that we have had and I really don't want us to miss that you know sometimes the great powerful things move very quietly oh yeah like the sunrising the Sun that huge ball of energy it rises without saying one word and everybody knows it's rising and it does tremendous effect and what happens if it doesn't rise then we'll all be done so the great powerful things many times like I say they're they're not always drastic but they're like getting a an adjustment from a chiropractor and you get on that table and you'll just adjust a few little things and it makes a tremendous difference and I'd like you to go back and get those messages and I like you to take those uh messages of the Prophet the message of Grace stature of a perfect man and Blas Blasphemous names now I feel to tell you that it's up to you uh to to do it all right that's my encouragement to you I think there will be a blessing for you one of the questions maybe came up on with brother whisper message on zerubabel I've heard some people say a couple different things uh first I want to say uh what he preached I believe it exactly that way exactly 100% there was nothing in the teaching or the preaching that I did not agree with and furthermore I'll take another step to say that there is a growing element amongst the leadership pastors I'm talking about that would have a problem with maybe what he brought or the delivery method and of course his deliver is quite different than is brother Ferguson is quite different than brother Paul they're all very different for all Faith they're all very different can I get a witness I'm different and so an artist like I can look in the mirror and try to draw myself and I wouldn't do a very good job but an artist can draw me better than I can draw myself and so that's a gift that's a talent and so if I'm trying to speak on something my delivery would be different and all Brothers brother George whoever their delivery would be different but you go back and you hear the content that's being said and and I set in the back normally I don't I'm usually in the front right in front where the preacher can see me but I sit in the back and uh that's probably why I don't sit in the back because I see a lot of reactions I see visitors I say woo how they take that statement woo how they and I really should just be feeding on the word that's why I like sitting in the front uh sitting in the back you see too much stuff yes okay but I sat in the back and uh he had a picture up of brother brandham and on the T on the top of it said that that was Z rubab Bell and I was like yes say it beautiful wonderful because I'm coming from a student of the word position and I've studied it and I've actually read those quotes from that very message to this church but my delivery would be different and then time and all of that some of you may not uh remember but he started to read those quotes in there and there's one quote in paragraph number 52 I believe I know he had it there to read it he did not read it it didn't take away from anything but I want to read it for you here too because it might it might have seemed a little drastic to say that brother ranam was the the zerubabel but we would have no problem if we said he was eler but we know we're talking about a type of elaser so you have to show Grace on all levels just don't be you're not comfortable with it because you didn't hear it before but he was saying of course he couldn't be the elaser of the Bible uh he had a father and so forth but he was saying in type okay so follow all the way through so the grace to say that brother vam was elaser we know I shouldn't have to qualify that every time to message people that you know that I'm talking about he's a type of elaser can I get a witness all right so in this message the message of Grace sis help me out thank you brother random says this here we're going to play this part of this for you that it will be a blessing to you it's one of my favorite quotes the anoint anointing jacket spiritual thinking anointing jacket I love that how brother R brings that but it's in the message of Grace and brother brandom says in paragraph number 48 he says we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the temple and zerubabel was a great Prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord then when he did he laid the foundation stone and as we read on further we find out that that God said zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands he also shall bring forth a headstone I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth a Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone now this is this is where brother whisper stopped he didn't read this paragraph 50 and I want you to read this now so he's talking about zerubabel he's talking about Zachariah 4 he reads the scripture and brother Ram if you continue reading he says and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone and he's also The Headstone now and now if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the father in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the chch Church in the last days so here he's talking about Z rerel Zechariah chap 4 and then he brings in the seventh Church age messenger why is he doing that well you got to have your anointing jacket on and you got to have your spiritual thinking on he set you up for that put on your spiritual anointing jacket and then he brings in the seventh angel messenger paragraph 56 he says this according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone and I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace for it's by grace are we saved that not of Works lest any man should boast and the message of Grace has been traed under fooot under men until it's become a disgrace some of them runs into eternal security some runs over into everything but the true message of Grace remains the same and there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by amen so that's beautiful the title of his message was a message of Grace then he says this great Prince is going to bring the message of Grace and then he refers to the seventh angel messenger that's going to bring not by power not by mind which is Zechariah 4 so who is he speaking of he's not talking about Billy Graham he's sh talking about Ora Roberts he's not talking about Pastor Reverend s who is he talking about and so to get the full context of it I want you to listen to that message it's in that message that the Holy Spirit speaks to him about the Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the the new those three rainbows we're going to play that for you just for a moment it's a very very important uh uh uh Revelation to know that the three are one not that they just agree in one but the three are one that the Lord Jesus Christ is Jehovah the heavenly father and they're not three persons it's one person's with those attributes and that's a tremendous revelation we kind of just step over it and we quote it but the age lost that and the Z zerubabel anointing had to restore that and the zerubabel and the Bible had to restore the building of the natural Temple um as the zerubabel in type would restore the spiritual house that God dwells in that's this message for this last last day I trust that was a blessing uh to you how he brought it I know there's some you know newcomer new voice a new delivery it could throw some people off but if you're a student of the word you'll know where and I do agree I don't agree with saying Amen to something that you don't understand keep quiet until you do understand and uh keep the criticism quiet too until you understand and so you get an understanding and then pick pick up the message go listen to it for your that's on you that's your diligence to do that amen you don't wait till don't hey what did you think about what brother what did you think about what the P what do you think did you open that did you even take any notes from the message that was brought and did you go back and hear it for yourself now whose responsibility is that we say it all the time say what the tapes say how can you say what the tapes say if you're not playing the tapes and so if any question comes then pick up the tape teaching and go back look at your notes pray and ask God to bless you and help you and he will amen amen and so and then Peter brings this sobering message and he really brings a warning to us and um that warning was that all the plagues of Egypt the Israelites escaped except for the last plague that struck everybody and that last plague was death and today it's spiritual death and he talked about how that came in and he brought the quotations about how Hollywood was brought in and he really brought in this the quote how brother vam talked about that spirit that was on the Nazi Germany that caused him to persecute the Jews that same spirit will persecute the last day bride the last day church it's a Roman Spirit it has nothing to do that the Bible or their Christians it's the spirit and that Spirit persecuted the Christians then that Spirit persecuted the Jews and then that Spirit was Unleashed on the bride 200,000,000 Horsemen spiritual Chargers released out of the river Euphrates upon the bride that's the age that we live in it's not a it's not a joke it's a prayer meeting message it's a message to strike your prayer meeting he brings up brother Paul did the asbery Revival and he thought well could this be the foolish virgin looking for oil well if the foolish virgin is looking for oil then we know for the bride it's lamp trimming time time amen now I wonder how many bride members people that follow the message looked at the Asberry thing just as a news piece or something to talk about I wonder what they're doing or they're not in the word or it's false I wonder it's going to come out of curiosity versus identifying it in the scripture that it could be the foolish virgin looking for oil so what what am I supposed to be doing missing more Church missing more prayer meetings no serious Saints and so the these these messages now God sends a gift it sends a humble little gift tall guy Paul durksen we've seen him before handsome guy lovely wife comes up there preach very common but if you don't see the gift of God that that that that's the Lord speaking to you you will miss your day in its message and the warning that come from that you know and it could be said said well Lord give me a second chance why didn't you warn me I brought a man all the way from a province of Saskatchewan flew him all the way down drove him down here to preach to you a message and you rode and you said amen but you kind of rolled your eyes like he ain't say nothing prayer life didn't change Bible study didn't change tape time didn't change nothing changed but we had special meetings you know I believe God's going to hold me accountable and hold us accountable so brother whisper comes all the way from England brother Ferguson all the way from can Montreal the other ones that come and then they stand behind the pulpit the song specials the word that was preached the scriptures that were given and many people didn't take one hair of a note well maybe we have our memory so great we don't need to take notes so this is not a I'm not bashing you don't take it that way I'm just as reminding you amen though you know these things amen so it's recorded it's on tape it's beautiful you can go back and hear them and say Lord what what are you trying to say to me through those meetings whether Paul brings in that the last plague was spiritual death can I take five or 10 more minutes brother Ferguson brings a message on the ministry of reconciliation you talk about a beautiful message on justification and being forgiven and he separated what it meant to be pardon and these truths will never leave a True Believer these I mean I can't think of anything more beautiful than being forgiven if you can't be forgiven then you can't be saved you can't come back to God God so he makes a way for forgiveness but then he moves us even past forgiveness he justifies us and justify means you never even done it in the first place God makes you righteous and who can lay anything against the elect who can bring a charge or an accusation against the elect a beautiful message he shared with us about how we should be reconciled to our brothers if there's a riff there there's an issue and also the word wants us reconciled back to God as a human being we need to be reconciled back to God but in the ministers meeting he brought out a point that I thought was beautiful and that was reconciling the word with the word that there are no conflicts in the word has some people make try to make you pick sides on a Doctrine or an issue all of it is on God's side and so people want you to say well you know what do you believe these quotes or th those quotes and just tell them I believe all the quotes you believe Jesus or Peter or I believe all of the Bible it's only the devil that doesn't want the scriptures to reconcile and dovile and say the same thing when you know the scriptures say that then you don't have to be afraid of any Doctrine or any Scripture or any quotation you don't have to be afraid because you know it doves tails with the rest of the message amen so A beautiful thought and then on Sunday night brother feron Fay picked up the token again he was preaching out of the message the token to apply the blood don't just say you're part of it get in it he brought the seriousness of it it's time to stop playing Church it's time to apply the token not just come to church not just pay your tie not any of that it's apply the token and beautiful that these messages should in should have encouraged us and I believe they did to really be sealed place and adopted because that's really what God has called us to we're predestinated to to adoption and you know all these things that are holding us back the things that we have fallen into um brother Ferguson brings his scriptures out of 2 Corinthians 51 17 and Corinthians 15: 21-23 and then brother Fay brings his scriptures out of Luke 17 same scripture that Paul brings and then Revelations 10 7 seven so those three messages if you have a time or actually if you're alive you have time so I want you to take the time to get into those messages statue of a perfect man Blasphemous names you'll see that in the blasphemia names that the reason why brother bam opens it up even further is because a sister has a dream and she was worried whether she had the holy ghost or not very human very believer type issue we have Believers with that do I have it or not do I really have it I know I love the Lord I know I believe the word I try to do everything I could am I sealed am my place where am I and she had that she falls on her she falls asleep on her bed thinking that the Lord gives her a dream a beautiful dream and sees brother brandom with his sleeves rolled up the messenger of the age with his sleeves rolled up pouring water down a mountain and clear water and it's just flowing through and then sees that messenger take a bucket of honey and pour that through a rock box and just like a dream but a dream interpreted is thus sayeth the Lord that's what it is it's just like your Bible interpreted is the word of the Lord so I encourage you to go back to that we've all how many of us have heard that know what I'm talking about yeah to do us good to hear it again it just reminds us it sets us on course for what these brothers brought uh uh during the meetings and I was so happy with how the Saints really uh pulled together to feed the people and the host of people and all the things I mean the brothers are just so impressed with the church and the love and the um and the you know the way we work together to get things done and so we certainly appreciate that the songs the choir the musicians you know my wife and the organists and the different song leaders and the people that the kept things clean and straightened up I thank you for that I really appreciate it there's no way I I mean everyone had something to do it seemed like and then others were doing just kept going I really really thoroughly appreciate it could we have done it better sure could have delivered and could have been communicated some things a little bit more um Lord will help us we'll we'll get better at doing that but in the in the grand scheme of things the messages that were brought were absolutely exactly what I believe the Lord wanted us to hear and um I would V value that and go back and really glean from what the Lord said in those meetings and I believe uh you'll be blessed and strengthened by it amen so let's play this little portion of the tape it's about 15 minutes or so it's a message of Grace brother Brand's going to give this experience of seeing these three rainbows is paragraph 21 through 57 and then we'll bring our pray request to the Lord in praying amen amen God bless you last year as all of you know which is on print and also in testimony and in the tapes I was sitting at a place here in Indiana where the Lord God came down and spoke to me that my second Ministry that was ready to take place in the near future and there was spoken into existence Three Squirrels all of you know the story I'm sure somehow going up the road I why I let the rest of the boys off going hunting I I had a strange feeling to go to this place again it was before daylight raining I didn't even know whether they get to hunt or not but that I would get over in the field there hunting means to get along to yourself to pray and I stopped the car and got off and walked across the road and went over into the bush and just before it would have been daylight it's kind of gray Dawn I'd stopped and i' offered a little word of prayer as usual in telling father that just what I have need of to provide it I don't believe in wasting anything or destroying never shot a burden my life for a target practice or anything else what a hun I eat or give to someone that that does eat it I don't believe in wasting anything I don't believe in doing those things because it's not right then as I turned and started along a familiar little pathway by the side of a pasture that crossed over to an L shape in the woods and something strange took place all my experiences I've never had anything like that I looked at the top of the hill to my left from where I was standing and there're coming up out of a black the top of the hill came three rainbows and they were running some 30 foot high first I looked and seen the light and I just turned back because I thought it might be the sun raising on the second thought it wasn't towards the sun it was towards the South and another thing it was smooth cloudy rain raining all over that was August the 25th last Friday morning and you know how it was raining and it's smooth clouds everywhere and I looked again and there it was growing taller and taller three rainbows I took off my hat I sat down my gun I started walking towards it with my hands up something is seem to tell me this is close enough I was going to sit down and take off my boots that I had on to see if I could walk a little closer but I got within a few yards of it and I seen the color of it misting like a fog moving around I Stood Still for a few moments just coming right out of the top of the little mountain and I watched as the three one to the right one to the left left and one in the center running down into one bow L every what it was was alive it was moving and making its motions and I stood there just as it was graying Dawn I turned and looked again and I screamed out oh God what would you have your servant know just then the spirit of the Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changed his mask from Spirit to man that was confirming of course my message of him letting me know as sure that these 31 years hasn't been in vain as I started to approach it began to go away went down into this bow like Affair and then disappeared I walked up close I was afraid to go any close closer because he' stopped me before I got there I turned and notice that that light the way it was shining for me was just exactly in line with the tree where I sat last year where the squirrels appeared some 35 or 40 minutes later I went down through the woods and over the creek bottoms and so forth to I got to this tree that separates in four directions east north west and south four prongs of the tree running out and I climb into this prong and sit down where I was when he told me of that scripture if you say to this mountain be moveu and as I stood there a little bit not thinking yet of the rainbow it had left my mind I stood there and this has been a very bad year for squirrel hunting everything is late no squirrels I thought right here is where God gave me them squirrels last year to speaking to existence I took off my hat again and I said Lord God you are still the same Jesus you are still God and something said to me how many do you need this time I said just as I did the other time the limit and then I said I shall have this limit before 10:00 today and strange as it seem just then I was in a very bad mosquito area where it was invested with mosquitoes and kind of swamp land a great big mosquito came to bite me right by the eye and I said not one of them will bother me this day no repellent or anything with me and before I knew it I said the sun will shine within 30 minutes and no more than i' said that till just behind me a squirrel exactly like that in last year young red jumped out on a limb about 70 yards away and began barking I turned around at those long distance I could barely through the powerful scope see his eye just shocked that's all I didn't even have aim at no more than over the squirrel and the bullet was just exactly smacked with the eye where it was the other time on down through the woods I went and at exactly 3 minutes of 10:00 I shot my third squirrel just it like it was last year just exactly the same at 3 minutes before 10 God being my solom judge not one mosquito even Buzz all day long right where there just tons of them I suppose if they could be weighed out and I never even seen or heard one I was listening for them to see if I could and I heard a huming I thought there's one somewhere and I listened and it was a truck way back on the highway and exactly 30 minutes from that time the sun Shone out good and bright and I came back to the place and I've been thinking when I said limit that meant five squirrels which is the limit in Indiana but I remember last year when he asked me how many did it take for me a mess I said three and I just got the three so yesterday I went back was going to the same place again and something said do not go across the road and at exactly 10:00 on the exact dot 10:00 with my watch I shot the Indiana limit the fifth squirrel amen I want want you to notice there was three rainbows and there was three things said Three Squirrels gotten there was three things Three Squirrels by 10:00 no mosquitoes the sun would shine in 30 minutes and U there were three to give witness of it brother Banks Woods my son Billy Paul and his son David to give Witness to it when I seen them rainbows about as wide across as that Halo is that angel of the Lord but there were three of them running into one oh how it help my heart to know that God Jesus is not just a man as people think he is just a prophet as this modern idea today thinks that Jesus is just a prophet he's Jehovah of the Old Testament made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah there that sure did comfort me then thinking on that subject that God had s so many people now there is a group of people call themselves The Oneness or the Jesus only I don't agree with them upon their Theory neither do I agree agree with that trinitarian group that says that there are three different gods the extreme of the trinitarian but I believe that the three Father Son and Holy Ghost is one that there are three offices of one God he lived in the fatherhood in the pillar of fire he lived in the sunship in Jesus Christ and he lives now in the Holy Ghost in his church the same Lord Jesus that was made flesh and dwell Among Us is with us this day amen Among Us in the form of the Holy Spirit Hall of all the experiences not turned first and SE thinking first it could be the sun peep through a cloud somewhere but it was before the sun time that when I turned back again and seen it wasn't a light it was rainbows and then when I looked and seen that I become numb all over just someone said to me did not you feel like shouting no I didn't feel like shouting those experiences never make you feel like shouting they just make you feel anchored just where that you know that there's something that tells you just a satisfied feeling now those things are truth I know we have things that say said that many times some people say I don't believe in such stuff as that I can't voucher for that I don't know I can only voucher for what I know to be the truth and God Almighty who wrote this Bible and I am his servant he knows that that is the truth think of it that the day that we are living in just before the coming of the Lord Jesus said there will be signs in the skies and in the Earth great sights flying saucers missiles perplex of time distress between the Nations and fearful sights upon the Earth and we're living in that day to see those things now for the message this morning I have chosen I want you to turn with me in the scriptures over to Zachariah it was my Zachariah the the fourth chapter I is my desire to tell you these things many times things happen that I don't U don't speak it don't say it but this was too outstanding for me to keep it from the church amen it must be told and before God who I stand it's the truth hallelujah I know that there is a God I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God Emmanuel dwelling amongst his people today in the form of the Holy Spirit and I know that the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh when signs and wonders are appearing we just got through the seven Church ages and learning that we're in the last and Lady of seean church age when the church is be indifferent get cold denominate be organized organizations would take it over eat it up but a promise that there'd be a little Remnant left there would be a church it would be scattered abroad everywhere but God would gather it together and Rapture it into glory amen a little Sanctified group somewhere waiting on the Lord then the other day when I got Daniel 70 weeks standing right here in the pull pit something struck me I've never been able to get away from it to see the hour that we're living in I want to go somewhere and do something else keep it off my mind I got too many loved ones that's unsaved knowing what can I do to get them saved what Israel I can do I have preach the gospel God has done great signs and wonders like he's never done since the world since the days of the Lord Jesus as he never did it in all the history of time and around the world it's went and still the world continually gets worse but then I have to remember that we're living in the lady oan Church age where they will get worse and it said they would then I chose this morning Ben that that message was so attacked and another thing that I'm so gotten after about is preaching Grace I want to speak on that this morning as I read the fourth chapter of Zechariah a portion of it and the angel that talked with me came again and wakened me as a man that is waken out of sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by one upon the right side of the bow and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zer able saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of host do you see the message will not come by some great mights or Powers but by the spirit of God last verse seventh verse who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto it Grace Grace unto it we are all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zerubabel was a great Prince amongst the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you want you to put on your spiritual thinking anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation Stone and as we read on farther we find out that God said zerubabel has laid the foundation with his hands he all so shall bring forth The Headstone amen I want you to notice he never said he shall bring forth the Cornerstone he shall bring forth The Headstone and we know that the scripture says that Jesus is the ch Cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit Hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord Lord not by organization not the denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days zerubabel the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he had tuck the people back to the foundation in tight which we all know that these candlesticks and so forth represented both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the ible said here and the Olive Branch we are the wild branch that was grafted into the root of the Ted Olive Tree gentille and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give light to the seven Church ages now remember in our teaching on the lessons that we just been through that we T the Great Pyramid and studied that for a while that Enoch must have buil and The Headstone was never put in the pyramid I've been there the architectur of it could never be replaced to this day we have no machines that could build a pyramid no powers less the atomic power that could build a pyramid because it's too gigantic stone that will weigh tons and tons and tons stands way in the air so put together that even a thin razor blade cannot and they're not cemented they're just cut so that they Join one with another that's the way the body of Jesus Christ should be so cut by the Holy Spirit but God's Great instrument and tool that we be joined as one person we are not divided we should be one person and it goes to show that no Machinery can do that that way it takes God to do that no mechanics of organization no lodges none of these things can ever do it as good as their intentions are they can never do it because that it takes God to do this the Holy Spirit I don't think I have a dollar bill in my pocket but there is yes I do I have a dollar bill I'm sorry on the back of this dollar bill you'll see the Seal of the United States on the left side looking towards you from me it be on the left side yours it's right it's the eagle and also in there the coat of arms and so forth but on this side here right side to me you see the pyramid and you notice above the pyramid is the Capstone and beneath there says the Great Seal even on our currency that we have to recognize no Infidel can stamp out Christianity every letter that you date dates the birth of our Lord every calendar everything speaks of even on our curreny The Headstone which is Christ why did not they put the headstone on the pyramid because the headstone was rejected when he come but now according to the prophecy there will come The Headstone I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out the message will cry Grace Grace Hallelujah for it's by grace are we saved that not of Works lest any man should boast Hallelujah and the message of Grace has been trapped under the feet of man until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into eternal security some runs out into everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same and there where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God that we're all saved by so in the deity of Jesus Christ if the Lord God could come there and confirm that that is the truth not only that but by his word he confirms it the truth and by signs and wonders he confirms it the truth then all so Grace is the truth then why could anyone criticize and say that Grace is wrong that we're saved by works we are saved by grace that through faith not by works works shows that you have been saved but what saves you is the grace of God grace saves you Grace is what God does for you works is what you do for God to show appreciation of what God did for you but by grace are you saved amen thank God for his word amen musicians come we'll take these prayer requests please remember Chuck's nieces Jessica and Juanita in Alberta they both have many uh serious physical uh needs
