[38:58] Branham
[38:59] may the Lord add the blessings
[39:02] as we read now in
[39:04] the book of Saint Mark the 11th chapter
[39:07] beginning with the first verse
[39:11] and then after you're just a little
[39:13] quotation
[39:15] or exhortation then I will go to our
[39:18] text this is reading for what I'm
[39:20] wanting to tell you
[39:24] and when they came
[39:26] I beg your part I want to get the tenth
[39:28] verse
[39:29] to save the time
[39:31] the 10th verse of the 11th chapter
[39:34] blessed be the kingdom of Our Father
[39:38] David
[39:39] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[39:45] hosanna in the highest and Jesus entered
[39:49] into Jerusalem and into the temple
[39:52] and when he had looked around upon all
[39:56] things
[39:57] and now evening tide must come and he
[40:00] went out into Bethany with his twelve
[40:04] and on the mara
[40:06] when they were come to Bethany he was
[40:08] hungered
[40:10] and seeing a fig tree far off having
[40:13] leaves he came if happily he might find
[40:17] anything there on
[40:19] and when he came to it he found nothing
[40:22] but leaves for the time of figs was not
[40:25] yet
[40:27] Jesus answered and said unto if
[40:30] no man eateth fruit all the Hereafter
[40:34] forever and his disciples heard it
[40:40] and they came to Jerusalem and Jesus
[40:42] went into the temple and began to cast
[40:45] out them that sold and bought in the
[40:48] temple and overthrowed the tables all
[40:50] the money changers and the seats of them
[40:53] that Soul does
[40:56] and would not suffer than any man should
[40:58] carry any vessel through the temple
[41:01] and he taught saying unto them it is is
[41:06] it not written
[41:07] my house shall be called of all Nations
[41:11] the House of Prayer but you made it
[41:14] again to thieves
[41:17] and the scribes and the chief priests
[41:20] heard it
[41:22] and sought how they might destroy him
[41:24] for they feared him because all people
[41:28] were astonished at his Doctrine
[41:31] and when evening was come he went out of
[41:34] the city and in the morning
[41:37] as they passed by they saw the fig tree
[41:40] dried up from the roots
[41:43] and Peter calling to remember said unto
[41:46] him Master behold the Fig Tree which
[41:50] thou did cursed it is withered away
[41:55] Jesus answering said unto them have
[41:58] faith in God
[42:02] for verily I say unto you that
[42:06] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[42:10] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[42:12] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[42:16] but shall believe that those Saints
[42:18] which he saith shall come to pass
[42:21] ye shall have whatsoever he said
[42:27] therefore I say unto you
[42:30] what things so ever you desire When you
[42:33] pray believe that you receive them and
[42:36] you shall have them
[42:40] what a gracious promise
[42:45] and it is absolutely the truth
[42:52] this you know me or as I should use that
[42:56] expression for a long time
[43:01] how could that be
[43:06] and one time when I first started
[43:08] preaching here at the Tabernacle many
[43:10] years ago
[43:12] I run on to the word of hell
[43:17] and I run the reference to it many times
[43:20] then it referred to Hades in the Greek
[43:24] which meant the grave
[43:27] and I didn't know what to say because
[43:30] I do not want to be responsible for
[43:34] man's Souls at the day of the judgment
[43:39] so I searched it and searched until I
[43:43] found what was the truth
[43:45] for about four or five years I would not
[43:49] touch the subject of hell
[43:52] until I found what was truth about it
[43:56] and then this scripture stumped me even
[43:59] more
[44:02] because it was outstanding such a
[44:06] promise being made by none other than
[44:09] Jesus Christ
[44:13] and when he said to his disciples
[44:16] what things so ever you say you can have
[44:23] if Thou shalt say to this mountain
[44:27] be plucked up and removed into the sea
[44:30] and will not doubt in your heart
[44:35] but shall believe that what you have
[44:37] said will come to pass you can have what
[44:42] you said
[44:45] oh if we could weigh those words
[44:49] you can have what you say
[44:53] not what I say but what you have said
[44:57] you can have what you said
[45:01] four years us lingered over that eye
[45:05] went to ever election commentary ever
[45:08] translation even to the due a version
[45:11] and every translator translates it the
[45:13] same
[45:14] you can have what you say
[45:19] so I know that if it's written in the
[45:21] scripture
[45:24] to me all scripture is truth
[45:29] and if I can't rightly divide it it's
[45:32] still the truth
[45:35] so I believe sometimes that God just
[45:38] lets us see things when it's time for us
[45:41] to see things
[45:43] he withholds these blessings like the
[45:47] blessings that we're enjoying today our
[45:49] forefathers did not enjoy those
[45:53] it wasn't season for them
[45:57] now I could remember when the Holy
[45:59] Spirit that night when I returned back
[46:02] to this same desk
[46:04] from the mill
[46:06] where I've been praying and told many of
[46:10] you people sitting here that he had
[46:13] charged me by his spirit amen
[46:16] a commission to all the world
[46:20] at the lame would walk in the blind but
[46:23] see
[46:25] and the Kings and monarchs would be
[46:28] calling for prayer
[46:30] and it would start a Revival among the
[46:32] Brethren that would sweep around the
[46:35] world before the coming of the Lord
[46:37] it was hard to believe that it was hard
[46:40] for me to believe it
[46:42] but that's what's happened
[46:46] it's just did that thing to today re
[46:50] Holy Ghost Revival fires are burning the
[46:53] world around
[46:55] India Africa Asia all into Europe and
[46:59] everywhere holy ghost man filled with
[47:03] the spirit is burning the world up with
[47:06] a Revival
[47:07] all the power of the Risen Christ
[47:11] name walk blind seed deaf hear dumb
[47:16] speak all kinds of marvelous Miracles
[47:19] are taking place
[47:22] because God promised it
[47:26] and God's promise is true
[47:29] and when I begin to ponder over this I
[47:32] could not
[47:34] but ask the one who was speaking to me I
[47:37] was insufficient
[47:39] not suppose God had to pick some little
[47:43] unconcerned illiterate person because in
[47:47] that eat God takes something that's
[47:49] nothing
[47:51] something that's been cast out
[47:55] that's what makes me love God's people
[47:58] so amen
[48:00] amen they cast them out as holy rollers
[48:03] are illegitimate
[48:06] people
[48:08] but that's when God's ready to pick him
[48:10] up then and do something with them
[48:14] and it pleases him that shows that he's
[48:17] God takes nothing and makes something
[48:19] out of it
[48:21] takes a sinner like me and makes a
[48:24] Christian
[48:25] the hand of God
[48:28] I question him of the ability and he
[48:31] told me that I was to pray for sick
[48:33] people and the commission was get the
[48:37] people to believe and be sincere then
[48:40] nothing would stand by the prayer
[48:42] many of you here remember that it's
[48:44] printed in literature across the world
[48:48] I question how could I do that when I
[48:51] had no education he said there will be
[48:52] two signs be given you
[48:55] as is given to Moses and one of them
[48:57] would be about Mike Moses hand he
[49:00] changed it from leprosy to healing and
[49:03] and then the same taken place about the
[49:08] putting my hand on the people and then
[49:11] how that that made itself manifest then
[49:13] he said you'll know the very secrets of
[49:16] their heart
[49:18] and uh I said that is why I'm here he
[49:22] said then he explained the scriptures to
[49:24] me and oh from that time the Bible
[49:27] become a new word to me Hallelujah
[49:31] I had a different look on it a different
[49:33] view of it something happened
[49:38] then a little later
[49:41] he said that if you'll be sincere
[49:44] stay humble keep away from money and
[49:47] stuff said then it'll just keep blessing
[49:50] you and you keep climbing
[49:53] now many times we look at men who climb
[49:56] up in great ranks like and get high
[49:59] names but sometimes that's not what God
[50:02] calls High
[50:05] you remember when
[50:07] John came preaching the Bible foretold
[50:11] that every Mountain would be brought low
[50:14] in every low place would be lifted up
[50:17] see and when it come you would think it
[50:21] would be coming out of heaven with fiery
[50:23] chariots but what was it but a poor man
[50:26] dressed in a piece of sheepskin wrapped
[50:29] around him and out on the banks of
[50:31] Jordan preaching
[50:33] on the Muddy Banks not even in the
[50:35] church but God called that great
[50:38] and when Jesus said to the disciples
[50:41] that there wasn't one Bond of a woman
[50:44] has greeted John the Baptist
[50:47] you take all the kings and David the
[50:50] prophet in all of his great Splendor in
[50:53] Solomon they didn't even touch John
[50:56] Hallelujah and yet he didn't even have a
[50:58] place to lay his hand
[51:01] so you don't have to be rich and mighty
[51:04] in this world to be great in the sight
[51:06] of God
[51:07] you only have to be humble in your heart
[51:12] God calls that greatness he that's great
[51:14] enough to Humble himself
[51:16] that's a great person that'll that'll
[51:19] take the blame for everything that'll
[51:21] humble himself that's greatness
[51:26] then we find
[51:28] that this what God Said then it was
[51:31] pronounced from the pulpit year the
[51:33] first time
[51:34] it done just exactly what it said it
[51:38] would do
[51:40] there come up the Pentecostal Church
[51:43] caught Revival and today the Pentecostal
[51:46] church is the fastest growing Church in
[51:49] all the world
[51:51] last year they registered that doesn't
[51:54] conclude us and and these out of the
[51:57] denominations one million five hundred
[52:00] thousand conversions
[52:01] last year
[52:03] which covered all the rest of
[52:06] protestantism put together in
[52:07] Catholicism too
[52:09] Catholicism only had I'll be 475
[52:13] 000 something like that converts around
[52:16] the world
[52:17] but penny cost money a million five
[52:20] hundred thousand
[52:21] [Music]
[52:24] God's making his church ready
[52:28] Man Of No Education low degrees rise up
[52:32] in the power anointing of the spirit go
[52:34] out without any education or anything
[52:36] and Proclaim The unsearchable Riches of
[52:39] Christ
[52:41] that's what's great in the sight of God
[52:45] and we noticed Stanton
[52:47] that all these things set fire and the
[52:51] Holy Spirit was true to his word
[52:54] after about five years of taking the
[52:57] People by the hand them one night in
[52:59] Queen cities in Regina in Canada a man
[53:02] walked across the platform and there
[53:05] ladies life just as open as it could be
[53:07] before the spirit
[53:09] that was discernment as he promised
[53:12] that's been around the world it's
[53:16] printed in many many languages prettier
[53:19] all around the world
[53:21] to all the world knows about it
[53:25] then the enemy come in and made fun of
[53:28] it and said it was mind reading and
[53:30] there was impersonations come of it and
[53:32] everything else but in the midst of all
[53:34] of it God moved right on just the same
[53:40] God stayed true to his loyal promise he
[53:45] will every time
[53:47] now we find later then
[53:50] one day I was
[53:52] going to a fishing down at Dale holler
[53:55] with some man Mr woods and his brother
[53:59] and they were Jehovah Witnesses and just
[54:02] had been converted and baptized into the
[54:05] faith
[54:06] and while we were fishing over against
[54:09] the bank I've told you the story many
[54:12] times
[54:13] there
[54:14] Mr wood said the banks would one of our
[54:19] trustees here now
[54:21] said about some old sister that used to
[54:24] feed them a slice of homemade bread and
[54:26] butter she belonged to the Church of God
[54:30] and said Lao to his brother we ought to
[54:33] go up and tell her that we got saved
[54:37] you know there's just certain things
[54:40] that we can say that takes a hope with
[54:42] the Holy Spirit
[54:43] just certain things that pleases him
[54:46] just right
[54:49] and when we say that thing
[54:52] now I want you to notice what you say
[54:57] if we can just find what to say
[55:02] your words judge you
[55:04] your words condemn you are your words
[55:07] will bless you
[55:11] and unconsciously
[55:14] Banks must have said the right thing
[55:17] for no more than he said that I was
[55:20] sitting in the back of the boat fishing
[55:22] with a flower line for a little bluegill
[55:24] fish to be to put on the line for bait
[55:27] before we run out of bait
[55:29] and I was catching these little fish and
[55:31] putting them in a bucket
[55:33] for the trotline
[55:36] Ayman Banks said that all of a sudden
[55:39] something struck me
[55:41] he said the right thing and the Holy
[55:45] Spirit spoke out and said thus saith the
[55:47] Lord
[55:49] you'll find in the next few hours there
[55:52] will be a resurrection
[55:54] of a little animal
[55:57] I thought it would be a kitten that I
[55:59] thought my little boy had squeezed too
[56:02] hard and squeezed the breath out of him
[56:03] and dropped him on the floor before we
[56:06] left I thought that's what it would be
[56:09] but to our surprise the next morning
[56:13] while we were sitting in the boat I know
[56:16] Banks is yeah guess Lao is now here
[56:19] banks are if you are allowed raise up
[56:21] your hands he comes down with us all the
[56:23] time
[56:25] um
[56:26] he was caught a fish with a
[56:29] one a long hook and he caught a little
[56:31] bluegill fish and he swallowed the hook
[56:34] all the way down and he took a hole the
[56:36] little fish instead of just taking the
[56:38] hook out of his mouth he was caught so
[56:41] deep till he just pulled it and he
[56:43] pulled the stomach and the intestines
[56:46] and the gills and all right out of his
[56:48] mouth
[56:50] I just threw it out on the water just a
[56:52] little fish like we had been fishing
[56:54] with night before to cut up a hundred of
[56:57] them or more Barbie and the little
[57:00] fellow quivered four or five times and
[57:02] tried to work his little mouth but he
[57:04] couldn't because he's filled up with
[57:06] gills and so forth
[57:08] and Lao said you shut your lace one
[57:11] little fella well I went ahead fishing
[57:14] thinking nothing about it
[57:16] then
[57:18] God does saying so strange
[57:22] all of a sudden I've felt there coming
[57:26] something down over the top of them
[57:28] Woods
[57:30] the Holy Spirit moved down and said
[57:33] stand up
[57:36] said speak to that little fish and it
[57:39] shall have its life again it had been
[57:42] laying there dead for a half hour
[57:45] done floated back into the weeds
[57:48] I said little tishy
[57:51] I can give you your life in the name of
[57:53] the Lord Jesus that little fish turned
[57:57] over
[57:58] flipped up and well to the water just as
[58:00] hard as he could go
[58:05] they're not knowing what to do
[58:08] brother bankswood said it's good for us
[58:11] to be here
[58:14] and law said that meant me because I
[58:17] said that thing to him you've shot your
[58:19] last one little fella
[58:22] and he got all excited I said no
[58:26] it isn't I was trying to console loud I
[58:30] said that isn't so and then the
[58:32] scripture came to me again
[58:36] everybody
[58:37] I had at least a hundred little
[58:40] children on the list to pray for
[58:43] many people with leukemian cancer and
[58:46] tuberclear being eat up blind and deaf
[58:49] and dumb there's page after page at my
[58:54] house full of them
[58:55] and it looks like that a merciful god
[58:57] would have graded that instead of using
[59:00] his power on a low insignificant fish
[59:05] but he remains God
[59:08] why didn't he use his power on the
[59:10] lepers at the gate instead of the little
[59:12] fig tree
[59:14] what is it to do God wants to show that
[59:17] he's concerned
[59:19] he knows all things he's got over the
[59:23] Fig Tree he's God over the fish he's got
[59:25] over creation he's God over all things
[59:30] and there's nothing too little or too
[59:32] insignificant but what he's interested
[59:34] in
[59:35] [Music]
[59:36] so that would give us to know though we
[59:38] belittle and insignificant God's
[59:41] interested in us doing something for him
[59:44] he likes to display his glory
[59:48] and that stuck with me so hard that I
[59:51] could hardly rest day and night that's
[59:54] been two years ago and constantly it is
[59:58] haunted at me
[1:00:00] and I'd say oh I just can't say nothing
[1:00:02] about it
[1:00:04] for I can't place it in the atonement
[1:00:08] whatsoever you saying it shall come to
[1:00:12] pass
[1:00:13] you can have what you say
[1:00:16] now I've stood here at the same pulpit
[1:00:19] and tried and wrote on the scripture and
[1:00:22] refrained from it didn't go back because
[1:00:24] I was afraid to use it
[1:00:29] you cannot have faith unless you know
[1:00:31] what you're doing
[1:00:34] some fellow come to me not long ago and
[1:00:36] he said brother Branham do you think
[1:00:38] it's wrong for a Christian to smoke
[1:00:42] tobacco
[1:00:44] and I said what are you asking me for
[1:00:47] if there's a question in your mind
[1:00:50] leave it alone
[1:00:53] don't never you can't have faithless
[1:00:56] you're perfectly sure that you're right
[1:01:00] amen when all Shadows are drifted away
[1:01:04] then you can have faith and confidence
[1:01:08] and I could not walk out there and
[1:01:11] preach that scripture not knowing what I
[1:01:13] was talking about
[1:01:15] but yet I knew it was
[1:01:18] of the Lord
[1:01:20] many of you people bear me a record
[1:01:22] that far last two years you've
[1:01:25] constantly heard me from this platform
[1:01:27] say that there's something something
[1:01:30] somewhere yeah
[1:01:33] I'm reaching I know it's close to him
[1:01:36] I just can't seem to grasp it
[1:01:41] I'll say I hit a scripture there I don't
[1:01:43] know what to do
[1:01:45] because scriptures oh you might put an
[1:01:48] interpretation
[1:01:50] if someone would have asked me I'd said
[1:01:53] something to them and walked away and
[1:01:55] turned it off on something else but to
[1:01:58] face the issue just like we've got to
[1:02:01] face the issue is the baptism of the
[1:02:04] Holy Ghost right or wrong
[1:02:06] we've got to face the issue is Jesus
[1:02:09] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:02:11] forever is it right or wrong we got to
[1:02:14] face it
[1:02:15] ever
[1:02:17] we must know that God's word is always
[1:02:19] true
[1:02:23] so on it when and up and down and I'd
[1:02:27] get it in my mind and I just couldn't
[1:02:30] get it away
[1:02:32] never where I'd go it would constantly
[1:02:34] come to me
[1:02:35] if you say to this mountain
[1:02:38] be thou plucked up and cast into the sea
[1:02:41] and don't doubt in your heart but shall
[1:02:43] believe that what you've said will come
[1:02:45] to pass you can have what you have said
[1:02:48] although how can it be Lord that would
[1:02:52] be me saying it
[1:02:54] I would it wouldn't do no good
[1:02:56] for it would be me saying it
[1:02:59] so I can't say nothing but what you said
[1:03:02] and I I just say that but the scriptures
[1:03:04] and all things rested in the atonement
[1:03:08] thus no blessings outside of the
[1:03:10] atonement
[1:03:12] because we are sinners outside of the
[1:03:14] atonement
[1:03:16] if it was just a universal thing for
[1:03:18] everybody then everybody would be saved
[1:03:21] but it's your attitude towards the
[1:03:23] blessings of the atonement that brings
[1:03:25] the blessings to you
[1:03:27] like salvation as far as
[1:03:30] God was concerned I was saved when Jesus
[1:03:33] died but it will never do me no good
[1:03:35] until it's revealed to me that he's the
[1:03:37] son of God and I've accepted him as my
[1:03:39] savior
[1:03:41] and every scripture is the same way
[1:03:44] Divine healings for you if God will
[1:03:47] reveal that to you that that's for you
[1:03:50] but you can't just stumble at it
[1:03:53] it's got to come by revelation
[1:03:56] and when it's revealed that bias types
[1:03:59] you were healed there's nothing Satan
[1:04:02] can even do as our young brother from
[1:04:04] Sellersburg said all the Devils couldn't
[1:04:07] move it sure once something is revealed
[1:04:12] notice
[1:04:14] then in this ice fall many has said to
[1:04:18] me why is it every morning you when
[1:04:21] you're home you grab your rifle and take
[1:04:23] out to the woods to hunt
[1:04:26] I want you to know that he's God of the
[1:04:28] woods just the same as his god of the
[1:04:30] city
[1:04:31] just as much God out there as he is here
[1:04:35] God always deal with man according to
[1:04:37] their capacity and what like David by
[1:04:40] The Still Waters and Green Pastures
[1:04:43] because he was a shepherd
[1:04:45] and different ways he has revealing and
[1:04:48] something I'd get up of a morning to go
[1:04:51] out to the Woods real early around four
[1:04:53] o'clock this girl hunting my wife even
[1:04:55] said to me she said Billy don't you
[1:04:58] never get tired of going hunting
[1:05:01] see this battle is one alone
[1:05:04] my wife doesn't understand it
[1:05:07] I don't understand it but it's a fight
[1:05:12] you have to stand alone nobody can stand
[1:05:16] with you
[1:05:18] just room for you and Jesus
[1:05:21] [Music]
[1:05:23] misunderstood sure
[1:05:25] even to my little girl there Rebecca she
[1:05:28] said if I ever marry a man if he even
[1:05:30] mentions going hunting I'll not married
[1:05:35] I said I know what my mother's been
[1:05:36] through
[1:05:38] husband out and gone the meetings as
[1:05:40] soon as he comes home grabs an old rifle
[1:05:42] or a fishing pole and hits to the woods
[1:05:44] I said would you rather he'd do that or
[1:05:46] would you rather he'd grab a deck of
[1:05:48] cards or or some blonde and take off
[1:05:52] not just draw your opinion when I come
[1:05:55] back that day she said Daddy I apologize
[1:05:58] for that I'm gonna marry a man like you
[1:06:01] that likes to hunt that I'm gonna hunt
[1:06:02] with him she said I'll go out with him
[1:06:06] I said well that's all right too I wish
[1:06:08] you could talk to your mother a little
[1:06:10] bit about it
[1:06:12] but it's something in the woods
[1:06:16] when I first learned of God I wanted to
[1:06:18] repent
[1:06:19] I didn't know how to repent I didn't
[1:06:21] know how to talk to him
[1:06:23] so I sat down and wrote him a letter
[1:06:27] and asked him to forgive me
[1:06:30] and I didn't know how to do it so I
[1:06:32] noted I'd felt something out in the
[1:06:34] woods and I
[1:06:36] packed it on a tree
[1:06:39] so when he come down through the woods
[1:06:41] in the place I had saw him and he could
[1:06:43] read this and would understand what I
[1:06:45] meant
[1:06:47] and I was shy I hadn't served him and I
[1:06:50] wanted to forgive me my sins
[1:06:53] then I got a shame to myself and took it
[1:06:55] I said if he's a man he'll understand as
[1:06:58] a man he's my creator
[1:07:01] and I got down in the shed and began to
[1:07:03] speak to him like a man and he answered
[1:07:05] me back like a man
[1:07:09] then
[1:07:11] it was on the I've got some dates set
[1:07:13] down here on October the 12th
[1:07:16] on the 15th deer season was opening over
[1:07:20] in Wyoming on the 12th was the last day
[1:07:23] I could hunt
[1:07:25] and we were going to leave on the 12th I
[1:07:28] mean on the 10th
[1:07:29] it was in the woods which was a Saturday
[1:07:32] Sunday I preached which was 11th on
[1:07:34] Monday
[1:07:35] for the southmen and brother Roberson
[1:07:38] back there and all of us we left for
[1:07:41] for the meeting for the deer hunting
[1:07:45] over in Wyoming on that morning of the
[1:07:48] 10th which would be then on the 18th the
[1:07:51] season would close in Indiana we would
[1:07:53] have no more squirrel hunting
[1:07:56] so I said this will be the last time I
[1:07:58] can go out
[1:08:00] and we gathered a bunch together and US
[1:08:02] straight them around the woods I went
[1:08:04] way back up into a place where I love to
[1:08:08] go at Salem
[1:08:10] season was late
[1:08:12] squirrels were few I've been out several
[1:08:15] times just getting one squirrel at a
[1:08:17] time
[1:08:18] so this morning I made my way to the
[1:08:21] same woods and a wind rose and they'll
[1:08:23] begin to blow in anyone who hunts knows
[1:08:25] that's a bad morning I hunted all the
[1:08:28] woods through without seeing one
[1:08:30] squirrel or hearing one
[1:08:32] I went down into a creek bottom and
[1:08:34] started up to find another little scope
[1:08:36] of woods and as I drew near this little
[1:08:38] wood there was a a lot of
[1:08:41] walnut trees and Locust trees the leaves
[1:08:44] all off of Mr bear Thicket
[1:08:46] along the side of two sycamore trees now
[1:08:49] squirrels don't hang around sycamores
[1:08:51] but right up from it I seen look like a
[1:08:54] cup the glitz I'll caught the glitz of a
[1:08:57] squirrel going up through the woods but
[1:08:59] he was running fast
[1:09:01] oh I said there's no need of hunting
[1:09:03] here's people out here the farmers
[1:09:05] picking their corn right around this
[1:09:06] little woods the squirrels would not be
[1:09:08] here so I sit down
[1:09:11] between the two trees and prop a feet up
[1:09:13] on one and lean back against the other
[1:09:15] to warm sunshine I'll go I'll just take
[1:09:18] a little nap
[1:09:19] then I'll get brother Banks and brother
[1:09:21] softman and the boys as I go back and
[1:09:24] down the road
[1:09:29] pardon me
[1:09:31] as a sit there under the tree just got
[1:09:35] snug down in a warm sun shining on me
[1:09:40] something said
[1:09:43] you you say to this mountain
[1:09:46] be thou plucked up and cast into the sea
[1:09:50] and shall not doubt in your heart but
[1:09:52] believe that those things that you've
[1:09:54] said will come to pass you can have what
[1:09:56] you said
[1:09:59] I said well now there's that scripture
[1:10:01] in my mind again
[1:10:03] I said I've got a while you're about an
[1:10:06] hour before I have to go get the rest of
[1:10:08] the boys so I'll just study that
[1:10:10] scripture
[1:10:11] and I said now how could that apply I
[1:10:14] said here's the only way it could have
[1:10:15] been
[1:10:16] that those
[1:10:19] disciples live the other side of the
[1:10:22] atonement the atonement was later about
[1:10:25] it or several weeks later before the
[1:10:28] atonement was made Jesus gave them power
[1:10:30] the other side of the atonement like he
[1:10:33] did the prophets
[1:10:35] and when I said Prophets
[1:10:39] something struck me again
[1:10:43] what was the prophets
[1:10:47] then I begin to think of it about what
[1:10:51] he did with the prophets
[1:10:53] and it got after I was speaking there
[1:10:56] for a while inside myself just thinking
[1:10:59] till I become so conscious of something
[1:11:02] here until I was talking to someone
[1:11:06] and something said to me
[1:11:10] that's in the atonement
[1:11:14] or if a man or a woman is so consecrated
[1:11:18] and surrendered to God
[1:11:22] that God just moves in and uses their
[1:11:25] voice
[1:11:26] man and it isn't the man speaking it's
[1:11:29] God that's in him speaking
[1:11:33] I thought that's right something said to
[1:11:36] me who do you think how do you see those
[1:11:38] Visions on the platform
[1:11:40] how do you see those Visions out here
[1:11:43] what is it do you think it's your own
[1:11:45] wisdom
[1:11:47] that you could predict something that
[1:11:49] would happen every time to the letter
[1:11:52] you think it's you speaking
[1:11:55] would you think sometime when the Holy
[1:11:58] Spirit gets into a message
[1:12:02] and you don't know what to say what is
[1:12:05] it speaking then
[1:12:07] what is it when a man will speak with a
[1:12:09] tongue that he doesn't know nothing
[1:12:10] about it
[1:12:12] what is it that will interpret that same
[1:12:15] tongue neither one of them knowing
[1:12:16] anything about it
[1:12:19] is it the individual or is it the spirit
[1:12:22] of the Living God
[1:12:24] I said that is true
[1:12:27] I see it
[1:12:30] it's God that's speaking in all the
[1:12:32] church needs is a step closer to him
[1:12:36] I'm more of a consecrated life
[1:12:39] to live with him
[1:12:42] and while I was sitting there just for a
[1:12:45] moment or two
[1:12:46] thinking on this I caught myself talking
[1:12:48] to someone
[1:12:51] and I heard something say
[1:12:53] X say what you will and it shall come to
[1:12:57] pass
[1:12:58] I said what are you I said who am I
[1:13:01] talking to
[1:13:02] who are you
[1:13:05] who's steady hear these bushes that I
[1:13:07] can hear that voice talking to me who
[1:13:10] are you speak out to me
[1:13:12] I got all excited and jumped up from the
[1:13:15] dream those trees I said speak to me
[1:13:18] who are you I can't see here I'll look
[1:13:20] for that light there I could see nothing
[1:13:23] I screamed out who are you who are you
[1:13:27] what you want with me Lord where are you
[1:13:30] something moved back and say say what
[1:13:33] you will
[1:13:37] be given to you
[1:13:42] I said Lord are you changing my Ministry
[1:13:46] is this the change you've been speaking
[1:13:49] of
[1:13:50] is this what it's coming to
[1:13:53] is this what it'll be something in that
[1:13:55] little house
[1:13:57] that I saw in the vision is this hidden
[1:14:00] just stand a real deep Sweden daunting
[1:14:04] of the Holy Spirit raise me like off of
[1:14:07] my feet
[1:14:08] and said say what you will
[1:14:12] and it shall be given unto you amen
[1:14:17] they're amazed it left me I had nothing
[1:14:20] although what could I say
[1:14:23] there's no sick people here there's
[1:14:26] nothing here I'm in the woods
[1:14:29] what could I say what what could I do
[1:14:35] and I thought am I losing my mind have I
[1:14:39] studied so hard till I'm my mental
[1:14:41] powers are cracking up
[1:14:43] and just stand I heard it just the same
[1:14:47] as you hear me
[1:14:48] said aren't you hunting
[1:14:51] and you have no game
[1:14:57] said speak anything that you wish
[1:15:01] well I thought this God said prove all
[1:15:04] things
[1:15:06] I said Lord God if that be you and this
[1:15:09] is a sign that you're fixing to change
[1:15:12] my Ministry from those Visions to
[1:15:14] something greater of the farce along I
[1:15:17] said let it come to pass it you'll
[1:15:20] answer my prayer
[1:15:21] and I'll stood there a little bit and I
[1:15:24] thought what did he say he didn't say
[1:15:26] pray he said say what you will
[1:15:29] you're sad and your words will
[1:15:32] materialize
[1:15:35] say to this mountain and it'll do just
[1:15:37] as you say
[1:15:39] so I'll put my shoulder against the tree
[1:15:43] and I'm used to got my rifle set for 50
[1:15:45] yards to drive tax so I I looked around
[1:15:49] to see a tree at 50 yards and the one
[1:15:52] who was 50 yards away out out of the
[1:15:54] leaves I said it's almost total
[1:15:57] impossible for a squirrel to come to
[1:16:00] that tree Roger them Farmers there
[1:16:02] picking their corn
[1:16:03] I said but there will be a red squirrel
[1:16:07] come out on the end of that limb and sit
[1:16:10] down there
[1:16:11] I'll shoot him from here
[1:16:13] no more and I'd said it there was a
[1:16:16] squirrel
[1:16:19] I trembled a little and labeled down and
[1:16:21] shot the squirrel walked over and picked
[1:16:24] it up I was shaking all over I said
[1:16:27] maybe that just happened that way you
[1:16:29] know how people can doubt
[1:16:32] but you want to be sure
[1:16:37] don't do nothing unless you're positive
[1:16:40] and then you know what you're doing and
[1:16:44] I'll rub my face a little and I'll look
[1:16:47] perfectly I shop
[1:16:49] so I went up sit down on the side of the
[1:16:51] hill and I said
[1:16:53] Lord it is written in your word
[1:16:56] not the mouth of two or three witnesses
[1:17:00] that every word be established
[1:17:02] I said if that was you forgive me and my
[1:17:05] stupidness but I pray thee
[1:17:08] to give me another squirrel like that
[1:17:12] and I said then I'll believe you
[1:17:14] that it's you and the devil won't have
[1:17:17] any room to say that it just happened
[1:17:19] that way
[1:17:20] so I sit down
[1:17:22] just in a moment here come that I call
[1:17:26] it super anointing swept over again and
[1:17:30] I have a almost all of my feet and say
[1:17:32] say what you will and it shall be given
[1:17:36] you
[1:17:38] I'll look through the woods until I
[1:17:39] found another tree some 50 yards away
[1:17:42] had a lot of brush in it and grapevines
[1:17:45] and things wrapped around where
[1:17:46] squirrels sell them ever take a tree
[1:17:48] like that I said there shall be another
[1:17:51] young fox squirrel sitting right there
[1:17:55] and on top of my finger down and looked
[1:17:58] around through the woods and looked back
[1:18:00] and there said the fox squirrel looking
[1:18:01] right at me again
[1:18:03] amen
[1:18:04] I shot that one picked him up
[1:18:07] I thought oh I was trembling I thought
[1:18:10] thank the Great Mighty God Of Heaven is
[1:18:13] here in the woods
[1:18:15] and he's confirming to me in my own way
[1:18:18] hunting here that he's going to do just
[1:18:23] exactly what he told me 15 years ago am
[1:18:26] I
[1:18:27] watched it a little bit I said Lord it
[1:18:30] shall happen again he said speak the
[1:18:33] place where it'll be
[1:18:35] make this radical
[1:18:38] I said that old snag sticking out there
[1:18:40] for the side of the field
[1:18:42] Bears slick and white I said there shall
[1:18:45] come another red squirrel and he'll go
[1:18:48] out on the end of that snag and look out
[1:18:51] over the field at the farmers
[1:18:54] that'll be that way I look back and
[1:18:57] there was no squirrel there
[1:18:59] I looked for about five minutes there
[1:19:00] was still no squirrel
[1:19:02] I said well I said two
[1:19:06] two squirrels is fine I said choose a
[1:19:08] witness I'll leave it like that and
[1:19:10] something said but you said there would
[1:19:12] be one
[1:19:15] I waited another five minutes nothing
[1:19:19] and it kept quoting in my heart
[1:19:22] you said there'd be one
[1:19:24] I waited and waited something said are
[1:19:27] you doubting I said not one bit
[1:19:30] I know no more and said that to out that
[1:19:33] limb went the red squirrel stood and
[1:19:36] looked at the farmers got my job
[1:19:39] standing here
[1:19:40] I shot the squirrel
[1:19:43] went over and picked him up and walked
[1:19:45] to the woods till I was way hours to
[1:19:47] pass picking the boys up to see if
[1:19:48] there'd even be one more anywhere and
[1:19:50] there wasn't
[1:19:52] then I come home and told you about it
[1:19:55] and then on November the 7th I was down
[1:19:59] in Kentucky
[1:20:01] I was with
[1:20:03] brother Woods's brother-in-law standing
[1:20:05] there Charlie Cox then they're at the
[1:20:07] pilaster
[1:20:08] and with brother Tony zabel one of the
[1:20:11] deacons here in the church are you here
[1:20:12] Tony uh he's here somewhere brother Tony
[1:20:15] is able and also brother Banks Woods
[1:20:20] and we were up in the mountains hunting
[1:20:24] and I started into the woods and
[1:20:28] squirrels were very scarce no
[1:20:30] the leaves deep on the ground and
[1:20:33] I started up into the woods and
[1:20:35] something said to me
[1:20:36] how many squirrels do you want this
[1:20:40] morning
[1:20:41] I said well I've got 114 this year 117 I
[1:20:45] said if I had three more make 120 that
[1:20:48] would make just the even number to stop
[1:20:50] on
[1:20:51] now I said another thing it would be
[1:20:53] give me six to take home which I love
[1:20:56] them better than any meat there is to
[1:20:58] eat
[1:20:59] and I said if I could just get three
[1:21:01] more I walked on up through the woods a
[1:21:04] little farther and all there was none
[1:21:06] good Hunters like Charlie and them got
[1:21:08] one
[1:21:09] and I said well
[1:21:11] I something said say to it
[1:21:16] beat the Three Squirrels
[1:21:18] and you'll have it I said that's
[1:21:20] happened once
[1:21:24] so I stood by this I have a little tree
[1:21:26] late in the afternoon on the side of a
[1:21:28] ridge and that anointing comes so great
[1:21:32] that I could hardly stand on the ground
[1:21:35] it said speak what you say don't doubt
[1:21:39] you can have what you've said uh and I
[1:21:42] said I shall get three squirrels
[1:21:45] he said where will they come from I said
[1:21:48] one will come from that way one from
[1:21:49] that way and one back this way
[1:21:51] make it radical
[1:21:54] God don't care how radically it seems
[1:21:57] he's God of circumstance
[1:22:00] and while I stood there for about a few
[1:22:02] minutes
[1:22:03] I could hear no shooting around the rest
[1:22:05] of the boys around anywhere
[1:22:07] I happen to look to my back
[1:22:10] way up in the woods about 90 yards I
[1:22:14] thought something was on a stump I
[1:22:15] watched it I just jumped off and it was
[1:22:18] a gray squirrel so far all the way
[1:22:20] across the Hollard up on top of the
[1:22:22] ridge when I come along with the silent
[1:22:24] tree I shot it at about 90 yards and it
[1:22:27] killed it
[1:22:28] I said there's one I might as well turn
[1:22:31] and look this other way for the others
[1:22:32] because they're coming
[1:22:34] see God has a way of bringing things to
[1:22:37] you
[1:22:38] making you sure what you're talking
[1:22:40] about that anointing is all for me then
[1:22:43] well I waited watch this away for about
[1:22:46] an hour nothing happened I was getting
[1:22:48] cold and I thought surely
[1:22:51] if that is the holy spirit that's
[1:22:53] telling me those things it will be just
[1:22:56] exactly because when the anointing was
[1:22:58] on me I spoke that word it'll have to be
[1:23:01] that way
[1:23:02] now listen real close to this
[1:23:05] and this is going to be a tape recording
[1:23:08] it'll go all over the world
[1:23:10] now and then to my left I kept watching
[1:23:14] after a while I looked up on a tree
[1:23:16] coming around the beach tree there come
[1:23:18] a Grace for us it tests exactly that way
[1:23:20] that's right Lord I'll turn down raised
[1:23:23] up the shooting and there come another
[1:23:24] squirrel I said there's two just exactly
[1:23:27] make my three now raise them shout the
[1:23:30] first squirrel the other one run under a
[1:23:32] log I could see him cutting on a hickory
[1:23:35] nut or something under the law a log is
[1:23:37] about that high at the end where he's up
[1:23:39] out the foot I could see the squirrel
[1:23:41] I'll kill the first one I said now I'll
[1:23:43] get the other one now level down put
[1:23:46] those crosshairs right over his ear not
[1:23:48] over 40 50 yards away and shot and hit
[1:23:52] the log
[1:23:54] and the squirrel never even got excited
[1:23:56] I put another bullet in it and he turned
[1:23:59] around went down the law and went the
[1:24:00] other end well I leveled down and tucked
[1:24:03] the best aim I could and I'd only miss
[1:24:05] five shots all year so then I level down
[1:24:09] right perfect shot and touch the trigger
[1:24:11] again and I hit about four inches above
[1:24:15] him
[1:24:16] I said I must have knocked my scope out
[1:24:19] and then I watched again the squirrel
[1:24:21] run up and went right out in the solid
[1:24:23] woods broadsided from me
[1:24:26] well I said I knocked the scope out I
[1:24:28] was just shooting broadsided then in the
[1:24:31] chest cavity and I raised up and put the
[1:24:33] Crosshair and I thought maybe I've got
[1:24:35] cold and shaken I thought it wasn't cold
[1:24:38] shaking when I shot the other one
[1:24:40] so then just the same about a minute or
[1:24:43] two apart and I got a hold of a bush and
[1:24:45] put it in my hand and helped the gun
[1:24:47] real tight and put it on the chest
[1:24:50] cavity the squirrel and pull the gun off
[1:24:52] and I shot a foot under him
[1:24:55] and our Pole to get another shell and
[1:24:58] our gun was empty while I was loading I
[1:25:00] said I'll get him if he'll stand there
[1:25:02] and when I got score went on up through
[1:25:04] the woods I stood there at the what
[1:25:07] there's three shops straight missed
[1:25:11] and I've only missed five out of 114 I
[1:25:14] said how could it be that uh my gun
[1:25:17] would be out and just then it comes to
[1:25:20] me you can't shoot that squirrel that
[1:25:22] way
[1:25:23] he was come from that way
[1:25:26] talk word is perfect
[1:25:30] couldn't shoot him from the south he's
[1:25:32] coming from the north
[1:25:35] well I said I'll just turn around this
[1:25:36] way then and watch North till he comes
[1:25:39] I put more shells in the gun and watched
[1:25:41] the little I said if he comes he'll have
[1:25:43] to be awful close I don't like to shoot
[1:25:46] one close that is a sport this is nice
[1:25:48] to do it so one was the thicker there I
[1:25:51] said well I'll have to get this one from
[1:25:53] the north because I said that way so I
[1:25:55] stood this way watching
[1:25:57] now I said I just got late I said a
[1:26:01] quarter to four not four o'clock I'll
[1:26:04] have to leave because with them too
[1:26:06] because the boys are waiting for me and
[1:26:10] so I waited a little while four o'clock
[1:26:11] came three minutes after four
[1:26:13] I said well I'll go get my squirrels I
[1:26:15] went up and got the squirrels and come
[1:26:17] back so dark I could hardly see in the
[1:26:19] holler
[1:26:20] I started down the holler and as it's
[1:26:23] going down the holler it's dark and I'm
[1:26:27] going to pass the place where I've been
[1:26:28] standing something said to me aren't you
[1:26:31] going to go up there and get that
[1:26:33] squirrel
[1:26:35] I said how could I see him now
[1:26:38] with a little telescope site little
[1:26:41] bitty fine Target scope hardly enough
[1:26:43] life to see a few feet in front of you I
[1:26:46] said how could I see it said but you
[1:26:48] said that there would be another one
[1:26:51] oh I wish I could just make that somehow
[1:26:54] I could get see what that yeah that what
[1:26:56] that really means friend
[1:26:59] see under that anointing it wasn't me
[1:27:01] that said it
[1:27:03] it was God that said it
[1:27:07] and I walked a couple of steps said turn
[1:27:11] and go back towards the North
[1:27:13] your squirrel's there
[1:27:15] I went turned I said Lord God I walked
[1:27:18] out a bit I started walking back towards
[1:27:20] an earth
[1:27:21] how are those setting your noses
[1:27:23] started walking back towards the North
[1:27:25] and way up on the ridge 50 or 60 yards
[1:27:29] away a squirrel run up the tree just
[1:27:31] enough light that I could see him I'll
[1:27:34] search with my scope all up and down the
[1:27:36] tree no score locking fine that's why I
[1:27:38] thought I seen a knot on the tree way up
[1:27:40] there so dark I said well I'll try that
[1:27:43] anyhow
[1:27:44] and I'll shop and when I did a squirrel
[1:27:47] run around the tree and run down
[1:27:49] I heard it hit the ground I thought it
[1:27:51] jumped off same time that happened about
[1:27:53] 20 feet from it one run up a white oak I
[1:27:56] said he run down one and run up the
[1:27:57] other one now surely Lord you won't let
[1:28:00] me miss him after you've already said
[1:28:02] under that anointing and this would be
[1:28:04] and you're confirming my Ministry this
[1:28:06] will be six times
[1:28:08] that you confirmed it to me at number of
[1:28:12] man
[1:28:13] six times I said you won't let me miss
[1:28:16] him I'll look all up and down the tree
[1:28:17] way up and now I thought I seen some
[1:28:19] leaves I've seen something moving in it
[1:28:22] I raised and shot and the squirrel
[1:28:24] dropped to the ground Stone dead up the
[1:28:27] hill I went rejoicing and happy I went
[1:28:30] to the first tree over to my left and
[1:28:33] there laid the squirrel
[1:28:35] well I said I know I got that one but I
[1:28:38] wasn't sure of this one
[1:28:39] I said then Lord you give me one for a
[1:28:41] good measure
[1:28:43] I goes over to find the other squirrel
[1:28:45] he wasn't there
[1:28:48] and I looked and I looked and I searched
[1:28:52] under leaves and raised up little pieces
[1:28:55] of Chunk and tore open an Old Log and it
[1:28:58] wasn't but one log Lane of then 30 yards
[1:29:00] and I tore it all the pieces looked
[1:29:01] around the sides and held my hand in the
[1:29:04] leaves and felt there was no squirrel
[1:29:05] there nowhere on up there's a big old
[1:29:08] snag on top of the hill I went up that
[1:29:10] little snag this little bitty hole I
[1:29:13] felt in there and I thought I felt the
[1:29:14] squirrel raising up and down when I was
[1:29:17] I said well I can't get to him so in the
[1:29:19] morning I'll bring the boys back and get
[1:29:21] about to go tell him
[1:29:23] now I went down to brother Charlie stuff
[1:29:25] the hole up went out to brother Charlie
[1:29:27] and them and told him we went over their
[1:29:28] house that night for supper we was
[1:29:31] rejoicing in the presence of the Lord
[1:29:34] Edmond before going to bed brother
[1:29:37] Charlie there asked uh brother Tony
[1:29:40] zabel back there to lead in prayer
[1:29:44] now I don't say this to conflict Arthur
[1:29:48] hurt brother Tony
[1:29:51] he is one of the finest Christian
[1:29:54] gentlemen that I know of
[1:29:56] but just show you how the Lord works
[1:30:02] Tony in his prayer that night said Lord
[1:30:04] God
[1:30:06] let it be known to us that our brother
[1:30:08] is telling us the truth
[1:30:10] that tomorrow he'll find that squirrel
[1:30:12] in the stump
[1:30:14] that was I never said I'd find a
[1:30:16] squirrel in the stump under the
[1:30:17] anointing
[1:30:19] I said I shot the squirrel of course I
[1:30:23] couldn't get the squirrel because if I
[1:30:25] did that it made more than I'd said just
[1:30:27] exactly what I'd said or that anointing
[1:30:29] that's what God produced
[1:30:32] so I didn't say nothing about that see
[1:30:35] that's how a lot of times people say
[1:30:36] brother Branham said so and so when
[1:30:38] brother bran says anything they don't
[1:30:40] have nothing to do with it but when God
[1:30:42] says it
[1:30:43] that's eternally true
[1:30:47] but brother Tony didn't get it
[1:30:49] he said if that squirrel is there then
[1:30:52] we'll know our brothers told us the
[1:30:53] truth
[1:30:55] brother Woods brother Charlie all of
[1:30:58] them picked it up we said nothing I
[1:31:00] slept with brother Tony that night the
[1:31:02] next morning at the table we were
[1:31:04] talking about oh it was a horrible day
[1:31:06] and brother Tony said well there's one
[1:31:08] thing brother Brandon will probably get
[1:31:09] his out of the stump this morning
[1:31:11] out of the tree
[1:31:12] I said brother Tony I never said the
[1:31:15] squirrel was in there I said I could
[1:31:16] feel it when it raised up it would drop
[1:31:18] he said it'll be there it'll be right in
[1:31:21] the Stone
[1:31:22] we went on up and when I left the car I
[1:31:25] started to turn back again and say
[1:31:27] there's something wrong I better tell
[1:31:30] Tony now because if that squirrel isn't
[1:31:33] in that hole
[1:31:34] and that stump I'll come back with no
[1:31:37] squirrel at all then according to the
[1:31:39] way he prayed last night he'll still
[1:31:40] believe I told a lie I said God you know
[1:31:44] with my Bible up told the honest truth
[1:31:47] and God knows that's the truth
[1:31:50] is that just the truth
[1:31:52] and I went on something just drove me on
[1:31:55] and I went walking up through the woods
[1:31:57] hunting I kept thinking what if that
[1:31:59] squirrel isn't in there he gave me his
[1:32:01] hunting knife so I could cut the whole
[1:32:02] bigger reach in and get him
[1:32:05] and something said to me
[1:32:07] if it isn't there or if it isn't there
[1:32:10] what makes a difference
[1:32:12] I said he will he wouldn't believe me he
[1:32:16] prayed and said that
[1:32:18] if we find the squirrel you'll know what
[1:32:21] our brother has told us the truth
[1:32:24] and
[1:32:25] that right in the morning comes that
[1:32:27] just say the squirrel will be up there
[1:32:29] and you'll get him
[1:32:33] I thought surely Lord
[1:32:35] surely this would be seven times
[1:32:37] straight
[1:32:39] all this in the morning's the homie I
[1:32:40] said is that you said say what you will
[1:32:44] I said I shall find that squirrel
[1:32:49] the anointing left me a hundred until 9
[1:32:52] 30 what we're supposed to do coming down
[1:32:55] go get some dogs and they thought they
[1:32:57] were and I went on up the hill at 9 30.
[1:33:01] looked in the hole felt around cut there
[1:33:04] was no squirrel there at all
[1:33:06] in the hole
[1:33:08] I felt all around now what I was picking
[1:33:10] up his little fine Grassroots or roots
[1:33:12] of trees I was picking up feeling fall
[1:33:14] off the stick want to run the stick in
[1:33:15] and pull it up like that I thought it's
[1:33:17] picking up the squirrel is sliding off
[1:33:19] the stick but his little roots and
[1:33:20] things
[1:33:22] no squirrel in there I thought now what
[1:33:25] will I do I said here it is 9 30 I've
[1:33:27] got to go back I picked up a rifle
[1:33:29] starved down the hill and something said
[1:33:31] did not did not you say you'd find the
[1:33:34] squirrel
[1:33:36] I said where would I find him
[1:33:40] God being my son judge with his word
[1:33:45] here
[1:33:46] now I'm a man of 50 years old a preacher
[1:33:50] of the Gospel standing in this Pulpit
[1:33:53] something said look under that little
[1:33:55] piece of bark
[1:33:58] I said Lord I wouldn't doubt you for
[1:34:00] nothing
[1:34:01] I walked over and picked up the bar and
[1:34:04] there was no squirrel there
[1:34:09] just before I did it some said what if
[1:34:11] he isn't there I said oh he'll be there
[1:34:13] I picked it up there's no squirrel there
[1:34:15] I'll look down with amazement I saw a
[1:34:18] little bitty piece of gray sticking out
[1:34:21] from under a leaf I pull it up and there
[1:34:24] laid the squirrel
[1:34:27] making it just exactly right what he had
[1:34:30] said to do down the hill I went and told
[1:34:34] him about it and we rejoiced and when I
[1:34:36] come to the car Charlie's standing right
[1:34:38] there Banks they were talking wasn't
[1:34:40] that strange that Tony would say a thing
[1:34:42] like that in his prayer as well as he
[1:34:45] loves brother Branham and why would he
[1:34:47] doubt his word and say that see he just
[1:34:49] had to say it that way
[1:34:52] but God knew it I'd stand in the Pulpit
[1:34:55] this morning and claim the same thing
[1:34:58] you've got to watch what man says and
[1:35:00] then what God says what God says is true
[1:35:04] then I thought well praise be to God
[1:35:09] I went down we had a great time come
[1:35:11] home
[1:35:13] brother George Wright for years has made
[1:35:15] the communion wine found closing
[1:35:19] as May the communion wine for the church

[1:36:15] some 25 or 26 years
[1:36:19] I pray that I prayed for that little
[1:36:23] girl
[1:36:25] I prayed to see God healer and I've seen
[1:36:28] afflictions even greater than hers
[1:36:30] healed
[1:36:32] and I've fasted and I've prayed and I've
[1:36:35] longed and I've sought the Lord with
[1:36:38] tears for the healing of that little
[1:36:40] girl
[1:36:41] poor little pillar was afflicted when
[1:36:43] she was just an infant
[1:36:45] perhaps infantile paralysis
[1:36:47] let's draw her little hands and feet she
[1:36:50] suffered for many years and when we
[1:36:52] prayed the first time for her she
[1:36:53] stopped suffering that's a year 26 years
[1:36:55] ago
[1:36:56] once she gets a stomach acre of a
[1:36:59] toothache just as soon as they go to
[1:37:01] pray for I know the Lord's going to take
[1:37:03] it but that Affliction and I've seen her
[1:37:06] sit here in the building when other
[1:37:08] cripples that get up and walk away and
[1:37:09] afflictions and so forth and water why
[1:37:11] don't that little girl walk
[1:37:14] Lord appear over her
[1:37:17] let the angel of Light overshadow the
[1:37:19] child so I can speak thus saith the Lord
[1:37:24] if it was up to me I'd speak it but it
[1:37:26] ain't up to me
[1:37:27] it's up to him
[1:37:29] am I and I watched it and we were come
[1:37:33] back she wanted a rabbit brother woods
[1:37:35] and I went out and killed two rabbits
[1:37:38] brought them back for her she had dinner
[1:37:40] ready
[1:37:41] Mrs writing them and during that time
[1:37:44] sister Hattie Mosier
[1:37:48] she just lost her husband I married the
[1:37:50] couple
[1:37:51] some years ago they got two fine
[1:37:53] children
[1:37:55] and brother watt was killed
[1:37:58] his own boy found him under his tractor
[1:38:01] mashed to death
[1:38:03] and the little boy had a break and
[1:38:05] something happened to him brother Woods
[1:38:07] I went out and went out and stayed Into
[1:38:08] the Night
[1:38:09] or his mother and Uncle were staying
[1:38:12] with him and the Lord let him be well
[1:38:14] and setting present this morning
[1:38:18] mother was interested in him
[1:38:21] that teenage just began to get out with
[1:38:23] the world 15 years old or something his
[1:38:26] little brother coming on 12 13 years old
[1:38:30] sister Hattie right all of you know we
[1:38:33] call her a writer named Moser
[1:38:35] but she's been a loyal person
[1:38:38] a little old Housewife lives in two
[1:38:42] rooms away back up into the Hills
[1:38:46] out there with a shovel and a hole
[1:38:50] trying to hold the cockle birds out of
[1:38:52] the Corn Patch to keep her little family
[1:38:54] together
[1:38:56] work Faithfully
[1:38:58] when I was setting at the table eating
[1:39:00] dinner
[1:39:01] I've been explaining what faith was
[1:39:04] I said your face like this if I see a
[1:39:08] vision of brother Shelby setting so and
[1:39:11] so on each one the way there was and
[1:39:12] sister had he was sitting way back out
[1:39:14] toward another room she didn't have much
[1:39:17] to say
[1:39:18] never does
[1:39:20] and then while we were talking I said
[1:39:22] the Lord showed me a vision that
[1:39:23] something was to take place then I would
[1:39:25] could say it that's what raises my faith
[1:39:28] I said when the Lord shows me what will
[1:39:31] take place then I've Got Confidence
[1:39:33] since you'll be that way when he showed
[1:39:35] now I said I'd come right here if that
[1:39:37] little Afflicted girl sitting there in
[1:39:38] the Lord show me she's going to be
[1:39:40] healed I'd come around here and stand in
[1:39:42] the track see if everything was just
[1:39:43] exactly the way he said and then say
[1:39:45] thus saith the Lord he just rise up and
[1:39:48] walk I said you'd see those little legs
[1:39:50] unfolding them little hands unfold and
[1:39:52] she'd get up from there and walk to the
[1:39:54] glory of God I said if it would come
[1:39:56] like that I've been telling about this
[1:39:59] experience
[1:40:00] and I said do you know
[1:40:03] I want to ask you something brother
[1:40:05] Banks were just sitting next to him at
[1:40:07] the table and next set the then sister
[1:40:10] had he was sitting way back and the boys
[1:40:11] just sitting here and Mrs Wright and Mr
[1:40:14] Right and Shelby setting back to my left
[1:40:17] oh listen don't miss this show you the
[1:40:21] sovereignty of God
[1:40:24] and while we were
[1:40:25] talking
[1:40:27] I said I want to ask you something
[1:40:31] what put those squirrels there
[1:40:35] there's no squirrels in the woods
[1:40:38] at a hundred and hundred and I I'm not
[1:40:41] the best of Hunter but
[1:40:43] I wanted since I was a little boy
[1:40:46] and I'd hunted close then and they were
[1:40:49] in the most ridiculous place and then
[1:40:52] the most ridiculous way I could call him
[1:40:54] I said what put them there
[1:40:58] I said I wonder
[1:41:00] if it is
[1:41:02] that my Ministry fixing to take a change
[1:41:06] that the god of Abraham
[1:41:08] is confirming his promise as he did to
[1:41:12] Abraham when he's up on top of the mount
[1:41:15] and he needed a sacrifice for it instead
[1:41:18] of his son
[1:41:19] Jehovah Jireh
[1:41:22] performed a miracle
[1:41:25] and placed the ram
[1:41:28] a hundred miles back his three days
[1:41:31] journey in any ordinary man can walk 25
[1:41:34] miles a day then he lifted up his eyes
[1:41:37] and saw the mountain far oh
[1:41:39] and then went to the mountain
[1:41:43] and went up on top of the mountain
[1:41:46] wild Ram back in there sheep wild
[1:41:49] animals would have killed it
[1:41:52] I'm not up on top of the mountain where
[1:41:54] there's no water
[1:41:56] how did that Ram get up there
[1:41:59] what happened
[1:42:01] God needed a sacrifice
[1:42:04] to prove to Abraham that he was Jehovah
[1:42:07] Jireh
[1:42:08] the very God of creation spoke or ran
[1:42:11] into existence
[1:42:13] I wasn't a vision
[1:42:16] he killed the RAM and blood came out of
[1:42:19] that animal
[1:42:20] it wasn't Vision it was a ram
[1:42:23] I said that same God
[1:42:26] Hallelujah
[1:42:28] that Jehovah
[1:42:31] just as much Jehovah Jireh today as he
[1:42:34] was on the mouth with Abraham
[1:42:37] he can still produce an animal to his
[1:42:41] glory
[1:42:42] these squirrels are not a vision I'll
[1:42:44] shot them blood came out of them I'd
[1:42:47] dress them and eat them
[1:42:49] they wasn't Visions they were squirrels
[1:42:53] I said that same Jehovah Jireh trying to
[1:42:57] get his promise over to me my thickness
[1:43:00] and tell us to mine he could speak my
[1:43:04] need into existence as same as he could
[1:43:07] speak Abraham's need into existence
[1:43:11] odd no more he said that until sister
[1:43:14] had is sitting there crying now
[1:43:18] hadn't said a word
[1:43:21] and she said that's nothing but the
[1:43:25] truth
[1:43:26] she said the right thing
[1:43:31] she said just like Bank said down there
[1:43:35] I heard her voice as a sweat from my
[1:43:38] ears like up into the woods
[1:43:41] Mrs Wright sitting back there with her
[1:43:43] little girl
[1:43:44] was trying to interpret what he just
[1:43:46] said it I couldn't hear him that's right
[1:43:49] and that's super anointing strip over me
[1:43:53] said tell Hattie
[1:43:56] that she's found Grace in the sight of
[1:43:59] God
[1:44:00] who would have thought
[1:44:03] said
[1:44:04] tell her to ask whatever she will then
[1:44:07] you speak it by this gift into existence
[1:44:10] whatever she asked
[1:44:13] him to speak it into existence
[1:44:16] I'll look to Sister Hattie
[1:44:20] the first time it was ever performed on
[1:44:22] a human being
[1:44:25] I said sister Hattie
[1:44:28] ask what you will
[1:44:32] God's gonna give it to you
[1:44:36] what do you think of that
[1:44:38] does it get into you
[1:44:41] seven times he had confirmed it by an
[1:44:44] animal seven is God's complete number
[1:44:48] here's the first time on a human being
[1:44:51] any what did he choose some great risk
[1:44:55] to crack a great noted Minister a poor
[1:44:59] little woman who can hardly write her
[1:45:02] name
[1:45:04] God knows what he's doing
[1:45:07] said ask what you will
[1:45:10] had he said to me brother Branham what
[1:45:12] do you mean
[1:45:13] I said ask anything your heart desires
[1:45:18] and it shall be produced right here that
[1:45:22] you'll know that the Lord God of
[1:45:24] Heaven's answers
[1:45:26] any scriptures are true
[1:45:29] the first time with the new gift
[1:45:32] a first anointing
[1:45:34] I could hardly hear
[1:45:37] and she looked around we've been talking
[1:45:40] about her little crippled sister
[1:45:42] I said oh no doubt in my heart within a
[1:45:45] few minutes little Edith of me jump into
[1:45:47] the glory of God
[1:45:49] had he looked around all around and she
[1:45:52] said brother Bill my greatest desire is
[1:45:55] for the Salvation of my two boys
[1:45:59] what up why there couldn't have been a
[1:46:01] greater thing she could have asked for
[1:46:04] ten thousand dollars she'd have got it
[1:46:07] what if there had been some millionaire
[1:46:09] would have asked for another million
[1:46:12] God no one watches go to ask for
[1:46:15] sister I had to at least a seven or
[1:46:17] eight Witnesses standing there all you
[1:46:19] people that was present when that
[1:46:21] happened raise up your hand everybody in
[1:46:23] the building was present that happened
[1:46:24] one two three four five six seven seven
[1:46:27] of them eight of them eight of them was
[1:46:30] present
[1:46:32] when that happened I said ask anything
[1:46:35] you want to cause God's give it to me to
[1:46:38] give to you whatever you want
[1:46:41] she said her voice is beginning to go
[1:46:43] off on the teenage
[1:46:45] tantrum and she said the salvation of my
[1:46:48] two boys
[1:46:49] I said Baha the will of God follow the
[1:46:53] power of God I'd give you in the name of
[1:46:56] Jesus Christ your desire and her two
[1:46:58] boys shook under the power of God and
[1:47:01] that old building trembled Banks fell
[1:47:04] into his plate shall be grabbed and had
[1:47:07] he screamed you could hear her for two
[1:47:09] blocks
[1:47:10] and them two boys with tears rolling
[1:47:12] down their cheeks received exactly what
[1:47:15] they asked
[1:47:18] oh
[1:47:20] the first time it was ever used on a
[1:47:22] human being
[1:47:24] f
[1:47:30] her boy sitting there with her this
[1:47:32] morning
[1:47:33] why would she have asked what if she'd
[1:47:36] asked the healing of her little sister
[1:47:38] what I should ask then the little girl
[1:47:40] would have been healed but her two boys
[1:47:42] lost
[1:47:44] what if that poor Widow who just told me
[1:47:47] that she tried to give to this church
[1:47:49] fifty dollars
[1:47:51] on a pledge to help build a new church
[1:47:54] and brother Roberson wouldn't take it
[1:47:57] and only let her give 20 of it
[1:47:59] I said to myself when she's speaking
[1:48:02] I'll give her back to 20 but God said to
[1:48:05] me in my heart now an above Vision in my
[1:48:09] heart when Jesus was standing watching a
[1:48:11] widow putting three pennies or there was
[1:48:14] thousands of dollars laying
[1:48:17] what would you have done I said well if
[1:48:18] I've been standing up said we don't need
[1:48:20] it sister we got plenty of money but
[1:48:21] Jesus never said it he let her go on and
[1:48:24] do it
[1:48:25] because he know what was down the road
[1:48:28] so help me God
[1:48:30] as my sovereign judge God knew that was
[1:48:33] down the road for her
[1:48:36] and I've run my hand in my pocket to get
[1:48:38] my pocketbook to give her her twenty
[1:48:40] dollars back say sister Hattie but he
[1:48:42] said don't do it
[1:48:44] then a few minutes from the questions
[1:48:45] part about Jehovah Jireh she said that's
[1:48:48] nothing but the truth
[1:48:50] and it come from a poor widow woman's
[1:48:53] heart
[1:48:54] and Hallelujah God knowing she'd ask the
[1:48:57] greatest thing could be done as long as
[1:49:00] there is the heaven when the stars is
[1:49:03] gone when there's no more moon no more
[1:49:05] Earth no more sea them boys shall live
[1:49:10] on through eternity
[1:49:12] with the same Jehovah Jireh who gave the
[1:49:16] immortal promise
[1:49:18] his promises cannot fail
[1:49:23] looking forward for the coming of this
[1:49:24] meeting down here in San Jose
