for our Sunday school adult Sunday school and the Bible says and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword amen only believe only believe oh believe only believe all things are possible only [Music] believe only believe only believe all things are possible only be God bless you may be seated brother Brandon I was want to ask you something just just look at something right here in the face Israel is now for the first time for 25 100 years a nation the oldest flag in the world is flying over Jerusalem tonight amen Israel's in her Homeland it was a brother here one time wanted to be a missionary felt to go missionary to the Jews I said you might get one now and then all people thinks the whole nation no sir Israel is converted as a nation not as a person a nation will be born in a day that's Israel all Israel Sav remember that Paul said so all Israel say now notice all Israel that's exactly right now notice this but he said when you see the Fig Tree and all the other trees putting forth their buds H there's never been a time for 2 200 years that Israel has ever come to a homand amen we got the little show of 3 Minutes to Midnight there she is the the six point star of David flying all these things has there ever been a time that the denominations has had revivals like they had in the last few years I just study now we're at home when did the denominations ever blew out hour or any man's Ministry like it has of Billy Graham Methodist Baptist and so forth amen when was there ever a man search down your history that ever went forward to the church formal by the name ending with h m the form a b e a b r a h a m h look Abraham's name has seven letters a b r a h a m but our brother Billy Grim had g r a h a m six not seven the world Amen that's where he's ministering to church natural Church natural was lock and solom amen and when this fellow went down there and preached and blinded him by the gospel but there was one who stayed with Abraham amen and Abraham called him Elohim Lord now when Abraham seen three coming he said my Lord lot seen two coming he said my lords there your difference youri work Jesus said as it was in the days of L you see that notice count it now there was one come to this church spiritual the bride Abraham that wasn't in in Sodom to begin with amen amen and watch what he did he never done no preaching like they did he taught them but then they done a sign before him he done the Messiah sign he had his back turned to the tent and he said Abraham I remember his actual name a few days before that was Abram but it says Abraham where is your wife s a r a a few days before that was called s a r r a amen Abraham said she's in the tent behind you amen amen and he said Abraham I there's your personal pronoun I am going to visit you according to the promise that have made you amen you see who it was a man with dust on his cloes eating the meat of a calf and drinking the milk from the toow and eating cornbread God Elohim Amen manifested in flesh Hallelujah promised in the last days am to manifest himself in flesh again Hallelujah notice Abraham where is your wife Sarah she's in the tent behind you said I'm going to visit you and the lady of course being 100 years old she kind of laughed up her sleeve back in the tent now behind the curtains in the tent she said me and old woman well it ceased to be with them the husband and wife for years you know cuz he was 100 years old and and she was 90 said that will never happen and he said why did she laugh with his back turned to the tent why did she laugh saying how can these things be see amen he showed him a sign amen now he promises that this will repeat at the end times again the two men went down there and preached the word and told them to get out of there the place is going to burn up and so forth and it did and lock staggered out the church natural down in sin in the mar but yet struggling along in their organizational programs but the bride that one man never went to them he went only and and call the bride [Music] type now we're in the last days now notice you said there are God manifested In the Flesh Jesus said himself how do you condemn me said isn't it written in your Bible your laws that they the prophets who the word of God came to Jesus said the word came to the prophets because he was scriptural in all things he said now the word of God says that the word came to the prophets and you call them gods for the word of God came to him so then how you going to condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God WR all there you are see how where we at we're at the end time now listen real close now now we find out that there would be wars and rumors of wars and now we see that the fig trees put forth its buds and the other trees put forth their buds methodists Baptists Presbyterians and all put forth their buds a great revival going on now I believe that God's Gathering the bride for that last hour there you left oh my I notice let us now consider what John saw then of these things what he saw a red horse and his rider Goes Forth power given to him to slay with a great sword now here's my revelation of it this is Satan again amen it's the devil again in another Farm amen now we know that that um seals pertain to it said the other night and trumpets pertain to to to to Civil Wars you see amongst the people among nations but you find out here that this man has a sword so it pertains to church political war you might not think that but just watch it a minute just few minutes amen notice the change of color of these horses same Rider amen change of color of hor and a horse is a beast and the Beast in the Bible and her symbol represents a power the same system riding on another color power from the innocent white to a bloody red watch him now he's coming when he first started he was just well he's just a little Doctrine in the in the called the nicoladis of course it wouldn't slay anything that's Revelations 2:6 if you want to put it down he wouldn't slay anything it's just a Doctrine it's a spirit amongst the people now he would slay nothing oh he was so innocent R white well you know we could have a great worldwide church we could call it the universal church they still do all right see now we could have or it's perfectly innocent and um or it's so innocent it's just a group of man we'll all get together for Fellowship see it's very innocent it's white the white horse was see now so the um uh dignitaries and the better dressed and the educated you know kind of like birds of a feather you know we we kind of get things together uh poor Bunch why they want to stumble along well all right but we we'll get a better class coming to our church if we can just get ourselves pulled off out here we'll we'll be a we'll be a bunch of Masons or so forth you know we we just have the things fixed up or oddfellas as they are and so then not the odd fell LOD now but you know what I mean so it's odd to the real believer now but otherwise words we want a little group a little Syndicate we can call her own it's just a Doctrine very innocent Brethren why we have nothing against you people certainly not you're all right but you know we feel that um if we have business and we we'd be better off just had ourselves together see amen it finally went right on down to hen yes sir get together but when this awful deceiving Spirit oh man incarnated in incarnate spirit this Doctrine Spirit became incarnated to take the place of Christ into a man it must be worshiped then turned to be a worship like Christ in other words up over the Vatican I've been right there it's wrote vicarious ofili adilia and it's wrote in Roman numerals now you just draw a line at the bottom of those nor Roman numerals and it means instead of Son of God in other words he's a viker you know what a viker is just take the place of something he is the biker instead of the Son of God Amen and the Bible said let him that has a gift of wisdom count the numbers of the Beast am for it's a number of a man and his number is 666 now you take viar filad dilia and draw a line Roman numbers of B for five I for one and add it up and see if you haven't got six 66 the Bible said he would be sitting in the temple of God worship like God when that little Doctrine become a incarnate it become a biker instead of the Son of God see oh my that awful deceiving Spirit if you want to read that read in 2 Thessalonians 2:3 you can see where it's at and of course you remember Satan is the head of all political power of every nation how many knows that you want to put it down Matthew 4:8 Satan took Jesus up to a high mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms of the world that ever was or ever would be Amen in a moment of time amen talk about a person he said I'll give them to you amen if you'll worship me and Jesus knew that he was going to fall air to him that's what they say well you bunch of poor Holy Rollers well we get the world Amen the meat shall inherit the earth what Jesus said see see notice Jesus knowed fall air to him so he said get thee hyan it's written right back with the scripture again see thou shall Worship the Lord and him only see now now when when he as his head demon incarnate in this super religious man as the Bible predicts then he unites his church and state both of his own powers unite together see when the Antichrist Spirit went forth it was a spirit then it become what it become then I watch this seal when the spirit went forth it was Antichrist against the teaching of Christ all right the next thing did what Christ set out for his church to do it was against saying that all don't it don't mean that it don't mean it that was for somebody else that that's back in the 100 years ago back under that that ain't for us see that's see anti against then it become now the riter went out he he didn't have no Crown but he was given one that white horse he had a boat no arir see so then when he went forth then after while he was given a crown because you can't put a crown on a spirit's head but when this Spirit become incarnate the second work of his of his dispensation of his myy the second work he become a crowned false prophet to the working of the Antichrist spirit amen now we SE now now now he becomes that when he takes that then he uh is already Satan controls the political powers of the world now he gets into a place that he's going to make a universal church power taking religious power and do you not understand my brothers that in when this nation appears in the 13th chapter of Revelations this little animal raised up like a lamb and it's got two horns civil and ecclesiastical power but he done the same thing the Beast did before him it's strange America is number 13 and a woman and strange that appears even the 13th chapter of revelation we start out with 13 stripes in the Flag 13 stars everything's 13 13 13 13 all the way down everything's woman woman woman all way down and it finally end up on predicted a woman will control her remember that's 30 years ago I said it and and and the the seven things that I predicted five of them done come to pass and they got the man right there now to bring her in and you voted into your politics all right so much to say you can't hardly get to where you want to get to notice now I won't keep you a little bit longer if I have to car tomorrow night look notice when Satan now everybody that realizes that Satan controls all political powers of the world he said so Matthew the 4th chapter you get it in the eth verse all the kingdoms belong to him amen that's the reason they fight War kill I remember isn't that strange they was given this sword to kill one another amen notice now now when he did that he did not have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started in with a demon of a false teaching and that teaching become a doctrine that Doctrine become incarnate in a false prophet and then he went just to the right place he never went to Israel now he went to Rome now see of Rome the Council was held and they elected a head Bishop amen and then by doing this they United church and state together then he Dred his bowl he got off his White Horse he got on his red horse or he can kill anybody that don't agree with him there's your [Music] seal same B watch him right on into eternity H with it see unites both his powers together the same thing they're trying to do right now that's right same thing today and a strange thing maybe don't understand it but today from a Baptist group in Louisville you heard it on the radio a speaker raised up and you how many heard it see are here you are they want and ask in the church now that we don't really have to um all just kind of Jar the Catholic church but we have to kind of fellowship with them get it and the same time that going on in Lille over here God's unfolding the seals to his people to show don't do [Applause] [Music] it see them both working together remember the crow and Dove sat on the same Roost B yes remember now we find out he unites his power then when he become both state and church ecclesiastical then what are you going to do he forms his own religion and now he can do whatever he wants to then he has the right to put the death whosoever will not agree with him that's exactly what he did too amen and he did that just exactly and what he he did it to the true Saints of the Living God who kept the word and wouldn't agree with him on his dogmas he put him to death amen now brother leel and you teachers here of the NAIA age in the early church I don't know where you read this or not if you want to read it you get in Smucker's glorious reformation and you find it that when St Augustine of Hippo become a priest under the Roman Church had the opportunity to one time the Holy Spirit tried to come on him and he rejected it how many knows that as a teacher so he rejected the Holy Spirit that's exactly what a type of the Protestant church today amen that's rejected the Holy Ghost he went back down to hippo and he was the very one that signed that that paper that had the Revelation from God that it was all right and pleasing God to put every person to death that didn't believe with the Roman Catholic Church [Music] [Music] am [Music] h [Music]

wife and brother dingal and his dear wife and we um was trying to squeeze a special out of him sorry about that but uh some of the Saints said you know they wanted to hear you sing and so um but we're here this morning to magnify the name of the Lord and receive from him and we know that he has something for us amen do you believe that amen God bless you we like to go right into our Bibles and I will ask you to stand and turn in the scripture uh a very simple topic that we had started last week's Sunday in Proverbs chapter 18 we can turn there quickly talking about our words and the words that we use in verse number 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof so the scripture is speaking of the power that is in our tongue and how that he gives a whole gamut of a lifespan death and life that's saying a lot there uh talking about the power that is in our tongue we'll take one more scripture found in James chapter 3 verse number 8 man don't you just love the Lord nice ask God to help us James chapter 3 speaking again about our tongue verse number eight is what we'll take but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison therewith bless we God even the father and therewith curse We Men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceeded blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not so to be that the fountain send forth the same place Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree my brethren bear Olive berries either a Vine figs so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of good out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom but if you have bitter enviance and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth so this um this tongue the the small member of your body the tongue the tongue that that can set the course of life or death by our simple words and so let us pray father we ask your blessings upon us may you speak to our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may you may be seated all right praise the Lord just have to bear with me just for a moment as we think of where our words are and how the songs that we sing are just words our prayers are just words Galatians chapter 6 tells us that we'll reap what we sow and the Bible clearly tells us that death in life lay in the power of the tongue this isn't even talking about the difference between right or wrong um it has nothing to do even with being a Christian it it's it's a law that whatever seed is planted it will produce after its kind Satan knows this and he knew this in the garden and he needed a host in order to speak and to do and to manifest his seed and so I want us to look at this uh little message this morning about our words being seeds and that what we say will manifest uh whether it's positive or negative and this is a principle it's not just you know one denomination or the next it's a principle that you reap what you sow and these principles Satan knows it business people know it positive thinkers know it book writers know it everybody knows this and um we can use that and it's it is being used by us even even as we sit here this morning I asked you on Sunday night and I encouraged the church after we spoke on that Sunday morning to go plant a garden and I told you to start planting a garden with the words that you speak there's those seeds you blant a big Garden or a little one but start planting something and so don't think that it's just uh just your words don't mean anything they absolutely mean something and um we can really do damage to people with our words and we can actually build people up with our words and this simple thought this simple principle I brought it out in this sinner prayer I call it the sinner's prayer as brother bandam is leading some people to Christ in his message in the in the life story and I want to read it for you again it's in 1952 paragraph 165 he says now will all your heads bow Let The Sinner say this so he's having the congregation the people that's coming to Christ to repeat these words and I want you to think about these words you oldtimers you saints that have been traveling a long time or short while or whatever stage of the journey you are these words resonate to the believer for It Is What Makes Us Believers it's our confession almighty God the people repeat this prayer after brother banam now I now come to thee as a sinner accepting Jesus Christ thy son as my savior I believe in you God and I believe that you sent Jesus to take my place at Calvary in that that I could not do for myself being a sinner I accept what you did for me I believe that in his death you was pleased to receive Me by his obedience therefore Lord nothing in my arms I bring none of my righteousness nothing that I can do only I believe your word and I accept it into my heart now receive me oh lord for I am sincere and from this day hence I will be your servant and in the hour of my death may Jesus Christ come down through the valley of the shadow of death and lift up the way and light up the way and bear my weary soul to a Haven of Rest until that time I will search after thee and seek for the Holy Spirit until thou has has give it to me and I'll make my life the best of my knowledge a pattern or a salt to the unbeliever that they might see my work by my faith and come to you receive me oh God In The Name of Jesus Christ now while your heads are bowed simple prayer just a few words if you were timing that probably a minute or two just words just simple words but at the beginning of those words we're dealing with the sinner at the end of those words we're dealing with the saint that's right somebody who's saved yes sir I mean that's a world of difference life and death lay in the power of the tongue and the words that we speak are very very important to God a negative attitude a negative atmosphere negative words should not be the host of a Believer a Believer speaks life a Believer speaks the word of God for that is what builds us up and that is also called a confession amen confession isn't just in the Catholic church where you did wrong and you have to make a confession okay fess up fess up no a confession means to say the same thing that's what it means to confess it means to say the same thing say what the word says amen now the prophet of God takes an example with the prophet Moses and um in the message why Christ speak he he he preached this uh twice and he deals with this Moses crying to to the Lord after God had already had already given him the Declaration to go forward he had already called him he had already Vindicated him and it looked like every time he got into problems or troubles he started calling on God to help him and brother random says it looked like God got frustrated with him now so he preached this message twice I think there's a five-year Gap in between he preached it in Cornersville Indiana why Christ speak and he had a secondary subject of that on God's on your attitude towards God's servants and then few years later 62 63 he preaches a 2-hour message in the Tabernacle why Christ speak same text a little bit different Direction they're all the word of the Lord but in this message why Christ speak one of the first and tremendous points that brother random makes is that there is no retreat in God Amen that's what he there's no turning back now we change our minds and things happen that we you know re we revisit our commitment but not God when God declares when God Proclaim claims when God thus sayeth the Lord that is his word it's very deliberate it said on purpose it's said with an authority it's said so that it can be heard and when it's heard it's meant to be spoke again for the hearer this is why it's recorded amen this is why God's word is recorded it's recorded so that it can be read it's read so that it can be SP spoken again and every time you speak the word of the Lord it brings that word back to life again it makes the book come open again your Bible is a closed book on your shelf but open it up one time even if it's a Bible app open up the app and begin to read what the words of say it out loud Faith cometh by what hearing what the news the 5:00 news negative attitude Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord even if it's you hearing yourself Faith cometh by hearing and the believer walks by what what ain't looking at the weather believer walks by faith lives by faith declares God's word by faith and that's how we live that's another realm in a negative Society that's another atmosphere in a negative friends or Atmos or family but we declare the word of the Lord and I ask the church to plant a garden plant a garden of with the seeds of God's word go through them and find a few of them and begin to plant a garden plant a Tre tree or two a shade tree then over on the other side plant a fruit tree then over there plant some other kind of little Edibles plant some beautiful flowers some that smell good some that make you appreciate God in his name plant a garden doesn't matter what color what kind as long as there's seeds from God's word go plant a garden and I wonder how many Saints did that I wonder how many Saints did that all right God bless you so this death and life lays in the power of the tongue and brother random says this here in all walks of life you'll find that you usually reap just as you sow so let's do good talk good be kind and people talk about us will say good things and kind things and good things will come our way if we'll give them out how many want good things to come your way but we want it first come our way first we don't want to start it when they say bad things about us or shade for things about us or cross things about us what are we to do huh say good things about them how easy is that it's not it's hard hard come on somebody uh but we'll say good things and then and then good things will come our way if we give them out Paul's speaking here of the Valley of the shadow of death this is in the message law 1955 could never make the worshipper perfect then he goes on to show what Perfection is now it's a strange thing that is so much thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say that's it you're just talking his language you say well I was just being humble no that's what the devil wants you to say if you're a Christian Proclaim that if you made a mistake Proclaim that God is your savior and he forgives you if you would repent of your sin he's faithful and he's just to forgive you of your sins if you done wrong you'll pay for your wrong but you confess those wrongs and he's faithful and just to lift you back up to that place that you're supposed to be you're not supposed to go around talking about how bad you are or how bad you feel or how you're just a horrible Christian that's what the devil wants you to say you start talking like that it's an atmosphere and the devil's come around and they'll tell you no say it like this and they'll encourage you of more negative things to say but a Believer declares the word of the lord it's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then see you mustn't never say that don't never let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time look at your neighbor and say let it be positive all the time all the time right all right did you wake them up did you wake your neighbor up when you did that okay we'll do it one more time all right touch your neighbor I I didn't like being in that kind of church touch your neighbor all through this Earth tap your neighbor and tell them this I was Raising that kind of church and here I'm now repeating that but touch with your neighbor and just look at him all right God bless you oh God bless you all right so there is no retreating God and there are mistakes that we make when Once the word has been declared the spirit the word of God has one message and God wants us to Clare that message so let's go back and look at the author the authority that was given to a man before we read a couple quotes on that we share with you the uh scriptures some of the scriptures in Matthew chapter 8 verse 6 and 10 it says this is the man that's calling on God to come and heal his daughter he heal his servant and it says and saying Lord my servant layeth at home sick of py griev previously tormented and Jesus saith unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion asked and said Lord I'm not worthy that thou should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it doeth it when Jesus heard it he Marvel now he's not making this up this struck him this did something to him like that woman that touched His Garment remember that this is this is a gentile now a man who doesn't know all the principles maybe of of the laws of Moses maybe he couldn't memorize what the the what the Old Testament uh uh uh uh uh laws and the and all of the precepts of Moses but he he simply knew the order of authority that if Authority has been given unto you then that Authority you know we're both men we both eat the same we breathe the same but one has the authority and one does not and the man that has the authority he's the boss he's the CEO he's the chief uh whatever he is and he has others under him and it's very simple principle it's very simple it's nothing to do with being a Christian not how holy you are how saved you are who you work for who is your boss and what did the boss tell you to do simple right simple principle and he says Lord you know Jesus said he'll come to your house how many Believers would need that so needy amen Lord take your time and come to my house and the Lord said I'll come I'll come to your house and the service says no wait wait wait you ain't got to come to my house what kind of believer is that it's a believer that Jesus marveled at it he stood back and he says wow what kind of faith is this and yeah verely I said to you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel so we see that this man understood what this Authority was Mark chap 13:33 says take heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is a man taking a far Journey who left his house and who gave gave authority he gave this authority to his servants that's Mark 13:33 if you want to write it down or just take a note of it and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for you know not when the Master of the House cometh at evening or midnight crowing or in the morning L coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what I say unto you I say unto all all watch so this is a parable again our Lord is giving this Parable to take heed for the son of man is a man taking a far Journey who Le leaves his house and gave authority to his servants so the Lord gives this authority to his servants all right we see this Authority given also in second Timothy chapter 2 this is the Apostle Paul commissioning Timothy and also in Titus he gives them instructions and look at how he says this in verse one thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men so I'm doing it you see me doing it now now I'm giving it to you now go committed to Faithful Men so what is that he's given them the authority to do what Paul was doing because God was God had commissioned Paul we know that he's God's messenger we know that Timothy what do you think Titus yes what did Paul say Paul told us to go and find Faithful Men and what you see me do among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be able to do what we make it easy for you if you didn't bring your Bible we got it up there on the screen the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who should be able to do what teach others so I'm committing it to you you're committing it to them and they're going to commit it to others the same Authority that's right Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach others thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ how many love the word amen also in Titus Chapter 2 verses 1-1 15 I'll just take verses one and verse number 15 this is Paul again he says speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine he's telling this to Titus and then the last verse it says the these things speak and exort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee so the promises of God the precepts of the Lord the word of God was made to be declared Amen brother random says on the message I pulled it I didn't pull it out um does God change his mind about his word I think it is or trying to do God of service he says this is why I've said and I'll say it again you say what is said on those tapes right now the emphasis is to play what's on the tape well you got to play it so you can know what it says but then after you play it the commission was to say speak it say what the tapes say Press Play Say it and then obey it how about that can we add that in there they say press play and Obey well let's press play and then say what the tapes say so we all know what we obeying say what the tape well my pastor said what I think that's not what he said say what I think what Pastor said what we feel like you know what's changed no say what the tape say that was the that was the commission the prophet gave us amen so we know it was recorded it was recorded so that we could hear it we hear it so that we can speak it now this speaking and having the authority to speak God gives us that authority to speak and with that Authority we don't take it lightly amen we take that Authority as marching orders from the Lord and with the Authority once the Revelation strikes to you who gave you the permission to say Amen to every word you know how some Christians are they ask they ask for permission they ask their pastor and they do it in a subtle way they'll be visited a certain church and a a declaration to be made and then they look to see did the pastor say Amen if the Pastor said amen then I can say Amen well we ain't looking for that no more if it's in the word brother sister is Free as a Believer you can say Amen to what you read is that right there's a freedom that comes with that the Lord Set Me Free with that know how's brother so and so going to see this quote well it don't matter how you see it not looking for a group amen yes sir start a Facebook page to see if we can all say Amen together let's all thumbs like it together come on on Saints no you read it it blesses your soul say Amen to it eat it while it's hot eat that biscuit while it's hot sure or the bread eat it while it's hot Matthew 7:29 says for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes Luke 10:1 18:20 and he said unto them I be Satan lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you amen not withstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written so there's the scripture the scripture Jesus gives the church the authority over all the powers of Satan can we say Amen how many believe that let me see your hand that's what the cheap Captain said that's right he told us that we have the authority so if there's a mixup in that it's because we're believing something or we allow something to creep in now let's take the original man and this is in the message uh uh um fundamental Foundation of faith brother random deals with this and he spends little time talking about the original man and um paragraph number eight I think I'm actually getting to the notes that I gave you s God bless you paragraph number eight no matter what a state of a man's in he's yet a Son of God no matter how sinful he is how far away he is he's a fallen son but yet he's a son yeah God God is his Creator God is his maker God has bought him with a price he may never reconcile himself to that he may never accept it it may never do him any good but yet he is a son and she is a daughter of God and what did God put him here for now we could spend much time on these thoughts but we won't we just give it in a basic thought here for tonight then we'll go praying for the sick God when he made made man in the beginning he made him Superior to anything on earth right he gave him the jurisdiction over everything on the earth to control everything he controlled the animal life he control the fowl life the fishes of the sea he controls the winds he controls the plant life he controlled everything now a real man needs to hear this I'm not talking about a false man I'm talking about a believer that started here with the sinner's prayer and committed his life to God then you know what he redeemed us and he's bringing us back to you need to start what what did the original man have stop looking at all these other caral men and caral application I'm talking about God's man the original man had the power over everything the fishes the foul the winds and the waves what kind of man needs to hear this a real man needs to hear this a daughter of God needs to hear this a son needs to hear this and it quickens up and say what that's what I come from That's The Authority that was given to me God don't let me live below my privileges he made him Superior amen he controlled everything man was made as a secondary God on Earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great Powers but then the then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell Adam could speak to the winds it would stop he could speak to the trees they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters every what it was everything obeyed Adam oh my now that is the beginning of man that's what God give him power over everything on the earth now though the fall through though now though the fall he lost the that power yeah then he becomes unconscious ience of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels become clogged up and he couldn't get through now what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that now Our Redeemer to redeem anything is to bring is to bring it back to its original again yeah Adam never had to be sick he never had to die he never had to worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just climbed up in the arms of the father just like a child everything was his and whatever he asked why he just got it everything obeyed him because he was God's child and the child is heir of all things now when man fell he lost this and now what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting light life he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall how many Saints can say Amen to that now the thing of it is since he's restored man back to this place man in the fall has lost his conscience of what father put him here on Earth to do in other words all of the plumbing as it was in our brain and the outlets the faith has been clogged up come on preach brother Brandon clogged up with business Affairs home life domestic things who he preaching anybody is he talking the truth business life home life domestic affairs what's it doing clogging you up man some of y'all thinking about Monday right now taking notes on Tuesday business Affairs all clogged up what we going to do when we get home I got to take care all clogged up and you come to the house of the Lord to get some Faith because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of the Lord but you worried about what kind of sandwich you going to eat at 12:00 you worried about what's for dinner what bills got paid and didn't get paid who likes you and who don't like you all clogged up brother or sister you are a son or daughter of God and God gave adam the authority over everything all circumstances were under his domain now this author God gave it to us amen clogged up with business Affair home life domestic things it's all become so clogged clogged up with that until God cannot operate through those channels that he made a man for now when God made the human body every little part had its place to play the teeth the tongue the eyes the nose God does everything in there to make it perfect in operation to make the man to live and if God so patterned a man the body of a man how much more has he patterned and set in order the body of Christ the church drop down to paragraph 17 same message so then we [Music] believe this is the confidence we have in God that we get what we ask for for he's God and cannot take back his word he's got to stay with his word so then if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given unto you isn't that simple Faith created we was made for that purpose then through the fall why we was taken away from that then in Redemption we was brought back to it again and the only thing that hindered the human race today from being Superior and controlling like they did in the beginning is because of that power that that the power lines of the outlet of God made in the human being has been clogged up you need a spiritual plumber unclog your pipes amen sometimes I say this reverently some sometimes Theology and church doctrines what they do make you want to fight somebody argue think you better it's just clogging you up man you all clogged up you need to you need a nasal congestion decongestion a spiritual unclogging you need your plumbing you need you need to be unclogged look what he says about theology many times SA sometimes Theology and church doctrines have clogged up your faith line clogged up your Lin so you have been taught that those things can't be and that puts a block in the way God help us amen yes glory to God Amen so God wants us to know what the original man was wants us to know why we're not in the place that we should be because things have clogged up our faith line these are not you know a a question of your salvation of course you are saved by grace are you saved um the grace of the Son of God he he puts that faith in your heart you accept him you make that confession and then you are sa you are saved but now this this um prophecy that comes forth to Moses about why are you crying unto me speak and that the prophet brings it out in that message why Christ speak and he says God got kind of tired of it I believe said while you crying to me speak to the people and go forward my if any time ever look like they ought to retreat was then but God has no retreat there's no place to retreat in God go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's t TV go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward thus sayith the Lord and move on cry to the people but the people then rebelled and said it had been better that we died in Egypt it been better that we had our Graves marked then for the hyenas and the vultures to pick up our bones in the wilderness why did you bring us out here and after he had seen God had approved Moses to be a servant God when he when God comes into a person or to persons into a congregation into a man or a woman he vindicates his presence God proves that he's there for when God comes Supernatural signs begin to appear this person becomes a changed person they're not no more like they used to be sin has vanished from their life fear and doubt has vanished frustration they are solid stable live or die it's Christ they don't care what comes or what goes nothing shakes them they move forward how many Believers are like that today I'm moving forward I'm going forward paragraph 79 same message he's talking about Stonewall Jackson he says the other generals asked him and said Mr Jackson a little bitty fellow blackheaded and blueeyed only about 5'2 in tall very modest moup speaking little fellow said Mr Jackson how can you stand in such opposition bashful like he kicked his boot on the ground and he said I never take a drink of water unless I thank God for it first that's where it is there is no retreat in God speak and go forward that's right that's God's commission to his church we have no time to slack they say the Revival is over it isn't over go forward it's time that Pentecost is played out it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise in the name of Jesus Christ and go forward there there's no retreat there's no staying on the same ground let's move with the spirit or the spirit move on to somebody else and leave you standing you follow it do all that's in your heart for God is with you now so these declarations are made typically on a Sunday morning if you're in a good church or in God's Church let's say You're going to hear these Declarations of faith you're going to hear the word of the Lord but then there's murmurings I'm going call them the the Monday morning murmur you got to watch out for that Monday morning murmuring and let's take a few scriptures here just for a moment believe in Deuteronomy chapter 12 Deuteronomy chapter 1 excuse me so they saw the great work works of Moses God had delivered them that's why they're out of Egypt now they're going on their road to the promised land and these people have become professional murmurers they they I'm serious they learn how to complain and it's just like it's almost like it's like you ask a guy what do you see he says well I'm just going to keep it real um uh I don't like what's going on I'm just keeping it real if it's contrary to God's word you're not keeping it real God said that we was going to take the land God said that we're more than able and we see this conflict at uh uh at at kades Baria when the spies all the spies went over and the 12 the 10 spies the 12 two came back with a positive report and the 10 came back with an evil report they simply persuaded the entire congregation out of a Divine promise of God through their words that they spoke they just begin to speak they begin to speak and as they spoke it was convin Ing and it became so convincing that okay these guys are valid because they were just there I didn't go I couldn't go I wasn't called to go but these guys went and Pastor Reverend Elder so and so said that we can't take it and then you know how people start quoting one another yes sir and then that that one that one that that single voice jumps on another to another until the congregation has one voice and it's a negative voice and you think everybody has their individual voice they don't everybody's quoting somebody it's either positive or negative and the whole congregation got in one mind in one Accord of the wrong thing they were quoting they didn't go over there they were quoting what they heard but they wasn't quoting what they heard from the Lord very dangerous spot Deuteronomy 26 notwithstanding you would not go up but rebelled against the Commandment of the Lord your God and you murmured in your tents you didn't do it in the Tabernacle you went back home murmuring in the tents I got to straighten up this tent I don't know what a tent had in it how many rooms a tent has but you know family life intense you doing this and then but the Lord heard them murmuring and where were they murmuring at in their tents and those words you got to pay for them you'll reap what you speak what you are speaking it's going to come back upon you you think you're pronouncing something you think you're holding up something that's true if it ain't with God's word it ain't worth repeating is that right Saints M and you murmured in your tents and said because the Lord hated us he had brought us forth of the out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us whei shall we go up our Brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of Anakin there then I said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them the Lord your God which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes and in the wilderness where thou has seen how the Lord thy God bear thee as a man doth bear his own son and all the way that you went until you came into this place in this thing you did not believe the Lord your God who went in the way before you to search you out in place a place to pit your tents in the fire by night to show you by what way you should go in a cloud of day and the Lord did what heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swear so he went before you and you think this is a conversation between you and brother so and so and other disgruntle whoever about this you know going up and take the land and the the sons of anude there and all of the the cities are walled all those things are true it wasn't lying about that it's true and the doctors's report is a true report it's what the doctors their x-ray is not lying that's what it said but who's going to believe God's report now God has a report over all other reports and we as believer we Proclaim God's report we Proclaim that all for all other reports can I get a witness it's not easy to do no it's a horrible Monday Sunday was great that's we had a nice service did you praise the Lord yes I praise the Lord did you high five the brothers yes I high-fived them for those of us who high five did you have the joy of the yes I even highlighted some few quotes I took my highlighter on the Highlight I was praising the Lord and then Monday comes along and you got to go in and work next to the devil's you got to go in Satan's eating now and you got to proclaim the name of the Lord in a negative atmosphere and we all get angry we all get in bad mood we all feel funny that's called being a human being but speaking it out should never come out of our mouth don't let the devil get into your mouth now tame your tongue the word of the Lord Bridle it if a man can do that he'll be a perfect man Psalms 106 24 yeah they despised a pleasant land they believe not his word but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord let's see how this happens the murmuring so look at this here what I call it murmuring Mondays look at a murmuring Monday paragraph 51 and the message what does thou hear paragraph 51 and it's very strange Pastor here knows and other ministers watch after your Mount carels you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God Pours Down and does something for you look out Satan is on the track just remember the next day that Monday after a good day on Sunday is going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before look out for the Mondays sometimes it's in the parking lot we don't even leave the church grounds that negative that gloom and doom that will never make it I'll never amount it didn't mean it's not for me all of that negativity you need to kick that out you need to let that go am get behind me Satan get behind me Satan in the name of the Lord yes in the message why Christ speak brother bam deals with it in paragraph 46 he saids Now isn't that just like today we see the message come forth we see the church rise to a place on the wings of the Holy Spirit until the power of God Thrills every person in there the glory of God Falls around and signs and wonders take place less than a week less than a week Satan is permitted he gets the permission to come into that congregation cuz he ain't talking about our church he's talking about all the other churches why does he do it God permits it and then the church begins to murmur fall back amen maybe it wasn't so there is where we fail that's the failing of the church regardless of what takes place it's God move forward we'll say there is a brother so and so I shouted a victory with him but he's back no matter what he's done that has nothing to do with you well so and so professor said that that wasn't right that wasn't of the Lord no matter what professor said so you you are the guy that stood on on the sacred grounds that's right you're the guy was at the burning bush you know the Lord hears our words even when we whisper them even in a corner it's just you and you know gossip number one and brother gossip number two you are just we this between me and you you know between me and you don't say it to nobody else and you whisper he say it very close you think nobody heard you in your tents I heard you murmuring you remember Grace Weber her testimony this is on the positive side sister Grace Weber the Lord came by Vision to the prophet to tell her to go tell her son or husband that she's going to die she has cancer shall not be healed make ready and really that's a blessing if a belie believer knows they have it's time their time to go you ready to go you know back pain whatever you got going on now in a few moments you'll be praising the Lord you know remember Sister Sister uh ma or hope remember she went to the other side she had her loving husband here she had two babies here on this side and she said why did you call me back she did not want to come back cuz the other side was so beautiful so Lov that was a mother think about how great that was she didn't want to come back and get in she like it's our time it's my time to go but Grace Weber the Lord told her it's your time to go Prophet Vindicated and told her you're going to die of this and she was at her job working and some sisters began to speak ill of the prophet and she took up for the prophet he says you know God is calling me home but what that man is doing is true amen yeah well I I watched his life he's a True Believer he's God's servant and brother bam says the angel of the Lord heard her yeah heard those words and It reversed her her proclamation of death till you will not die you will live cuz I heard you now some people want to speak praise where everybody can hear them why don't you speak Praise In Secret like a secret closet and begin to proclaim the positive blessings over your enemy's life you don't have to let everybody know what you're doing you don't have to tell everybody what kind of garden you're planting but go plant a garden with your words the words of the Lord and the Lord who sees in secret yes will reward you openly sees your words take your words be very careful with your words knowing that there are seeds that have to be planted death in life laying the power of the tongue and life the fruit thereof you will eat from that can I take one more step keep walking keep walking thank you the new Christians they come with a nice positive outlook the the old saints were we going to that how long we going to preach you know all that kind of stuff but the ni do that's why we need to get some more in here give me some more more new Christians just fill that we got some free seats right up here just tell them to come on cuz we need that positive outlook you remember the new Christian you know how we call it spiritually ignorant but they just believe everything was going to be all right they believe all their prayers will be answered let me ask you what what what's a better position position to be in that's right whether they're answered or not who has the better attitude who do you want a 2hour ride with in a car who do you want to hang out with I want a man who's got a positive testimony a woman that speaks the blessing of God who proclaims these blessings with faith knowing it makes a different amen bless his wonderful name I'll take one more step here in that same message why Christ speak the prophet of God says in paragraph 39 we read before I read it again he says speak what his word and go forward thus sayith the Lord and move on cry to the people the prophet of God says in paragraph number 73 look at David when he sit with Nathan the prophet David a man after God's Own Heart he was anointed God anointed him King David was not only a king but he was a prophet I like this quote I just want to drop this in so Nathan was the great prophet of the nation David was more or less a poet and a prophet songwriter musician and prophecy really in its original is more like a song when they prophesy I wonder if we can view Our Song service like that oh my does it matter if you're in the right key or not or does it matter more what words are you saying many people come to church they don't even sing they listen to other people sing right they don't Proclaim it out of their mouth God gave you a mouth to sing open your mouth and praise the Lord those words of the song is prophecy and David great king great warrior great but he was a musician and he was a songwriter and that was a prophecy a declaration Onward Christian Soldiers marching as War you sing those songs that give you courage that give you Faith the joy of the Lord is your strength it rises up your joy you begin to Proclaim that through the song why Christ speak paragraph 87 men and women today will join some social standings in the church join some intellectual group because they love to get into the intellectual sections when they know that the spirit of God has life and moves Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and the way he was then that's the way he is now and will be forever and the messenger of God is here the Holy Ghost to reject it is death to receive it is life approved how does people accept it now the Holy Spirit has one message speak the word and go forward that's right don't cry to me there's the word speak it and move forward thus sayeth the Lord that's the message of the Holy Ghost so what's the message of the Holy Ghost speak the word and do what go backward go forward go forward Holy Spirit has one message look at your neighbor and say one message and that one message repeat that one message Mage is speak the word and go forward don't go back sis don't go backwards my brother you go forward word the holy spirit's message is speak the word and go forward if it if you can't speak the word and go forward it better don't say nothing it's better just to keep it on quiet just button it up a got nothing to say what you what you think about I got nothing to say cuz what I'm going to say ain't GNA be right Lord help my mind help my thoughts let me get into atmosphere let me get a word of the Lord and when you get that word of the Lord you speak it you don't just think it all thinking is part of it but we don't just think it we speak the word and then move forward within a 7day span a week later this is lost many times because Satan is permitted to come to a congregation he has permission sir it's like Satan you don't have no business no have business here your father said I can come and mess with y'all and he comes here to mess with y'all that's right and some of some of us don't catch it I've seen it happen right here at this church we'd have an outpouring a nice service a series of services just a nice Sunday and nice Sunday how you know what I'm talking about nice glory of the Lord and then come back Wednesday or the next week is like what happened in a week there somebody got this to stepped on or somebody didn't come under expectation but we're Saints of the most high God we come to worship the king of kings and Lord of lords we got the Declaration of life in our tongue or death you can speak life to a situation stop being so negative all the time you got negative friends tell them to go dismiss them there you go tell them no M amen get moving tell them to get going that's right say bye do like that bye and let them get going and stay with the positiv stay with God's Declarations of his word amen God bless you so much can we plan a few Gardens here this morning we'll plant a couple plants a couple trees I'm going to read a couple scriptures for you this is one of my most favorite Psalms I read it almost every Sunday morning I come here I read it out loud I declare it every Sunday Morning by myself psalms 27 amen and verses 1-4 in particular take the first couple of verses I want you to listen to the Declarations that are made from this I it has never failed for the years I've been doing this that I get something another angle out of this one one chapter that speaks to my heart but it's nice to speak it and it's nice to hear it so when you're by yourself you can do both you can speak it out loud and then you hear it and Faith cometh by what amen and hearing by the word of the Lord the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid afid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me they want to gank up me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this what in the war I'll be confident my faith will actually rise in this I'll be confident one thing of I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple verse five for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me I'll offer sacrifices in his Tabernacles of Joy I will sing praises unto the Lord look at Psalms 23 let's quote that one together Psalms 23 how many know it let's declare it out loud the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever you know the song writer the the the the inspiration behind this was a man that knew God something squeezed him to write this it was alive when he wrote it it was living words when he wrote it it was sealed up it's prophetic it's a declaration it was uttered but it's sealed up until you read it it comes back alive again for you now David's PSAL becomes your song and when the songs that you sing out of the song book becomes your song then the anointing comes upon your life and you got a tree that's being planted in your life from your lips that you spoke out as you declared it and believed it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I like Psalms 34 this is was my mom's one of my mother's favorite Psalms she would quote it all the time I Will Bless The Lord at all times his praise how many know it his praise shall continually be how is his praise going to continually be in my mouth while I'm murmuring and complaining I can't Praise Him and complain his praise shall continually be in my mouth my soul will make her boast in the Lord The Humble will hear thereof and be glad oh my oh magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name together amen how many love that amen Psalms 11817 says I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and Glory so brother Israel what you saying everything I want no I ain't say the scripture didn't say everything you want say he will supply all my needs how many can say that all my needs are met because I'm a Believer he's meeting them right now the cupboard is empty there's no oil in there me and my son are about to die but go bake me a cape first and she go bake a cake oh my and when she went into her cupboard her cupboards were filled food and oil she was sustained with life what about the believer today amen what about the believer today my brother my sister hold your head up even if it is bad there's bad things that happen there's bad things that come our way even if it is bad and it makes you feel bad and there's a negative atmosphere on you and you're in a bad mood or a bad attitude we all get into those but our declaration out of our mouth because God has given us the authority to do so is to speak life you can speak death and you will reap the benefits of it and those that are around you will but you can speak life and life only comes by the word and I'm so glad that we can speak the words of Life he's given us that Authority you know that that ruler he understood the authority of of just life of just one being a ruler and I say one come and one comes and one go and one go and Jesus said I'll come to your house he said I'll come to your house to visit your servant and he stopped the Lord he saids no don't come to my house I just need to hear you say it if I hear you say it oh my I'll go back and tell them what you said he went back the Lord spoke the word of life he went back back and everything was all right and then he spoke what Jesus said would would take place now will you do the same thing this morning God bless you you got the power to plant a new Garden another Garden that's not negative that's positive that's surrounded around the word God bless
