[38:22] unto
[38:23] Aaron and he received them at their hand
[38:26] and fashioned fashioned it with a
[38:29] graving tool after he had made it a
[38:33] molten
[38:34] cough and they said this be thy God o
[38:39] Israel which brought thee up out of the
[38:42] land of Egypt and when Aaron saw it he
[38:46] built an altar before it and Aaron made
[38:50] Proclamation and said tomorrow is a
[38:53] feast of the Lord and they rose up early
[38:57] on the tomorrow and they offered burnt
[38:59] offerings and brought peace of fairings
[39:03] and the people sat down to eat and to
[39:06] drink and Rose up to
[39:09] play and the Lord said unto Moses go g
[39:14] thee down for thy people which thou
[39:16] brought thou broughtest out of the of
[39:19] the land of Egypt have corrupted
[39:23] themselves may God bless the reading of
[39:25] his word you may be
[39:28] seated so this this evening I have a
[39:31] brief message and I'm doing my best to
[39:34] go uh as fast as I can cuz I don't want
[39:38] to hold you long last time when I
[39:40] preached I held you long and that was
[39:43] not
[39:45] good so today uh I'm sure it's not going
[39:48] to happen so I'll be Runing with the
[39:52] time and um I hope this message is going
[39:55] to bless somebody is going to comfort
[39:57] somebody
[39:58] amen it is a pleasure to stand before
[40:01] God's people all the time you know you
[40:03] are so precious and we cannot just take
[40:06] it you know for granted when we stand
[40:09] before you know God chosen people in
[40:11] this age amen so uh the small message
[40:16] that I have for this evening I give it a
[40:19] title of bless the Lord oh my soul and
[40:23] forget not all his benefit amen amen
[40:29] because in this life we have problems
[40:33] and consequences when we
[40:38] forget we have no right to
[40:41] forget because a man who forgets is like
[40:44] a dead
[40:46] man a man who
[40:48] forgets can do nothing for the society
[40:52] he's not useful are we together and I
[40:55] was reading actually uh I was checking
[40:57] in the dictionary when they uh they talk
[41:01] about Amnesia I wanted to know like what
[41:04] is the meaning of
[41:05] Amnesia I was curious to know what is
[41:08] the meaning what does that mean uh to to
[41:11] have
[41:12] amnesia what can we learn from that how
[41:16] can we avoid to have
[41:18] amnesia so um at this time what I'm
[41:22] going to do I'm just going to uh read
[41:26] from Mariam
[41:28] Webster I want to read uh the definition
[41:32] of
[41:34] Amnesia
[41:36] amen we start
[41:39] slowly so they said that
[41:42] Amnesia the first definition they say
[41:46] it's loss of
[41:48] memory
[41:50] due unusual uh uh uh usually to break
[41:56] brain
[41:57] injury shock
[42:00] fatigue
[42:01] repression or Illness but first of all
[42:06] it's loss of
[42:07] memory like your memory is empty you
[42:11] can't remember nothing because when
[42:14] someone has
[42:16] Amnesia he cannot even remember who's
[42:20] his wife he cannot even remember his
[42:23] address or the name of his kids so he
[42:26] has a loss of memory are we together and
[42:30] here in Psalms uh 103 David
[42:34] say bless the Lord oh my
[42:37] soul and forget not all his
[42:41] benefits and as we are reading here this
[42:44] is a popular story in the Bible this is
[42:47] after they crossed the Red Sea they were
[42:49] so blessed they've seen God doing
[42:52] wonders they've seen God doing great
[42:54] things they've seen God divided the Red
[42:57] Sea and on the other side of the Red Sea
[43:01] as they had a lot of things they were
[43:04] blessed they had a material blessings
[43:08] because all of them have had gold you
[43:10] know right here none of us have we have
[43:13] not even a a watch in Gold but they had
[43:16] H earrings in gold everything was gold
[43:20] and when we talk about gold it's all
[43:23] about money it's
[43:24] expensive it's
[43:26] value and they had money they had
[43:29] everything everything was set up for
[43:31] them and now arrogance
[43:35] started they said we can't wait no more
[43:38] upon the Lord I think we can do
[43:40] something for ourselves we cannot depend
[43:43] no more uh just waiting for the Lord
[43:47] waiting for Moses message waiting for
[43:50] the day Moses is going to come back the
[43:52] Bible says they said Moses has delayed
[43:55] to come back
[43:56] and we don't know what happened to him
[43:59] and they were not even worried about
[44:00] praying for Moses they says they said
[44:03] they went to Aaron and they put a real
[44:07] pressure on Aaron you know what right
[44:09] now you have to make us a God we need
[44:12] another God that we're going to worship
[44:15] and due to the pressure Aaron couldn't
[44:17] escape he told them all right so right
[44:19] now just bring all your earrings uh your
[44:22] wife's earrings your sons and daughters
[44:24] earrings we're going to make up some
[44:26] something and Aaron had that that that
[44:29] that's graving tool he made up you know
[44:32] H uh that golden Cal and then people
[44:35] rejoiced they said oh Israel here is
[44:38] your god who brought you out of Egypt
[44:42] here is your God now and you know the
[44:44] Bible says this was a great sin this was
[44:48] a great SC you know in a matter of
[44:50] second in a matter of days they just
[44:53] forgot who is their God they forgot what
[44:57] the Lord has done for them and they
[44:59] started worshiping you know the
[45:02] idol you know they forgot about how the
[45:05] Lord has divided the the the has
[45:07] separated the red they forgot what the
[45:09] Lord has done with all the plagues that
[45:11] he hit with you know in Egypt they
[45:13] forgot everything because of wealthy
[45:17] they were wealthy they had a lot of
[45:19] things and they couldn't uh they
[45:21] couldn't worry no more are we together
[45:24] sir and we realized that when they were
[45:27] in Egypt when they were in slavery they
[45:31] were praying really hard but when their
[45:34] prayer was answered they couldn't pray
[45:37] no more that was the time now to be
[45:40] corrupted and that what happens with
[45:42] some of the Believers you realize that
[45:45] the way you used to pray when you were
[45:46] broke since you got a job you don't pray
[45:48] the same way the way you used to pray
[45:52] before getting a good job that you have
[45:54] right now you you that's not the way you
[45:57] used to pray that's not the way you're
[45:58] praying right now a lot of things have
[46:01] changed because all is well all is well
[46:05] no more time to pray you have a lot of
[46:08] excuses you can wake up early in the
[46:10] morning and pray why because you are
[46:13] forgetting and that why the Lord was
[46:16] praising David he says this is a man
[46:20] after my heart because David all the
[46:23] time was remembering where the Lord got
[46:25] him
[46:26] from David all the time he could
[46:29] remember I was a shepherd and today I'm
[46:32] a king not because I deserve it not
[46:34] because I'm better than somebody not
[46:36] because I'm very special but because of
[46:38] his grace today he made me who I am and
[46:41] I think that the feeling that we are
[46:43] supposed to have as Believers today
[46:45] because if we have a such feeling we
[46:47] want we're not going to be rolling eyes
[46:49] on someone who's weaker than us we're
[46:52] not going to be rolling eyes or looking
[46:54] down on someone
[46:56] who's not dressing like us who's not
[46:59] behaving like
[47:01] us if you have that Spirit if you can
[47:04] remember what we used to be before then
[47:07] we will have empathy that's right to
[47:10] others we will have love to others amen
[47:14] we'll have a burden to others amen we
[47:17] will pray for them because them that we
[47:20] are pointing they're not Believers
[47:22] they're not respecting this they're not
[47:24] respecting this if you have a right
[47:26] Spirit if you have the Holy Ghost in you
[47:30] the Holy Ghost will push you to love
[47:33] that person that you think he's
[47:35] unlovable the Holy Ghost will push you
[47:37] to love and to sustain to help that
[47:41] person who you think is not yet on your
[47:44] level are we together because some
[47:47] Believers some believers they think if
[47:51] they are filled with the Holy Ghost
[47:53] everyone is supposed to be that way
[47:56] and if you are not that way you are
[47:58] condemned they're not like me they don't
[48:01] have my experience yes indeed it's a
[48:04] process brother can you be a little bit
[48:07] patient amen and pray intercede for them
[48:11] Souls that are still
[48:14] struggling that the spirit of a True
[48:17] Believer because you cannot convince me
[48:20] that you have a right spirit and then
[48:23] hate someone because he's weak right
[48:27] hate somebody because he's doing
[48:28] something that he was not supposed to do
[48:31] you need to have that burden feel sorry
[48:34] for the brother approach the brother
[48:37] pray for him love him you know the
[48:40] prophet of God says a little bit of love
[48:43] can kick out
[48:45] demons just a little bit of love if you
[48:48] show love to somebody that can change a
[48:50] lot of things are we together so let me
[48:53] read a quote here and I'm just going to
[48:55] read this slowly even if I can just read
[48:57] his quote and then close I'm okay but as
[49:00] long as I know that you got it right you
[49:03] understand it and just promise me
[49:05] brother banza we're going to apply this
[49:07] court in our lives we can even close the
[49:11] service in the sermon Jehovah
[49:15] Gyra that he preached on February 22nd
[49:20] 1955 I love this with all my
[49:24] heart
[49:27] paragraph 65 let us go slowly if they
[49:30] going to display that so that we can
[49:32] just read all of us
[49:35] together because uh in the morning
[49:38] brother Isel told us why we repeat
[49:41] brother brandham we have no new
[49:44] revelation to bring to you we have no
[49:47] new message to bring to you so we are
[49:49] just we are just here to repeat what the
[49:52] prophet said amen the the prophet of God
[49:56] started start here on paragraph 65 here
[49:59] sometime ago I was up in Ohio in Acron
[50:05] or somewhere up there in Ohio having a
[50:08] meeting and we were eating in a little
[50:11] dunked
[50:12] restaurant nice little ladies all
[50:14] cleaned up and they were ladies every we
[50:18] uh every we of them and they was uh
[50:21] waiting on us it was a pleasure to go
[50:25] there and eat in that nice place well
[50:29] Sunday came they went to church closed
[50:31] up their place just across the way uh I
[50:34] was out in the
[50:36] country a ways of the crossroad crowds
[50:39] was so great couldn't stay uh right
[50:42] around the city so I went across the
[50:45] boys had went in out had to preach that
[50:50] afternoon I'd been Kinder praying all
[50:53] morning and all of them had gone to the
[50:57] meetings but the backer and all and I
[51:01] thought I'm so hungry I'm going to get a
[51:03] sandwich this this was before the
[51:06] meeting the prophet went to get a
[51:08] sandwich somewhere so this is where I
[51:11] want you to pay close
[51:13] attention I went up walked out W walked
[51:17] down the road a little piece and went
[51:20] into uh an ordinary Little Restaurant
[51:23] Little Road place and when I walked I I
[51:26] walked in behind the door the door shut
[51:28] behind me uh really hard I looked and
[51:31] there stood a
[51:33] policeman with his arm around a woman
[51:37] playing a slot machine and uh gamblings
[51:41] uh G gambling is illegal in in Ohio and
[51:44] I thought the law the very
[51:47] law and the man was my age perhaps
[51:50] married or had a family at home I
[51:52] thought oh my corruption filth
[51:55] this the prophet corruption
[51:59] filth I looked back at the table back
[52:02] there and some young boys and lady about
[52:05] little uh young lady about 18 20 years
[52:08] old they ought to be in Sunday School
[52:10] summer this boy drinking back there and
[52:13] oh the way they saw uh they was abusing
[52:17] that girl and her standing and her
[52:19] standing there and letting them do it
[52:22] and I happen to look over my rights and
[52:25] there was an olderly woman sitting
[52:28] better sitting there uh with little old
[52:31] clothes she ordered to to have had a
[52:35] real old about 65 maybe better and she
[52:39] had a a purple makeup on her mouth and
[52:42] on her toenails and her arms a poor old
[52:45] thing was flabby and her hair was boish
[52:50] gloved in little Kinky Curls up on it
[52:54] she she's trying to light a cigarette
[52:57] drunk and two drunken man uh uh with her
[53:02] listen close here I thought this is the
[53:05] prophet oh God this is the prophet oh
[53:11] God how can you look at a such
[53:14] thing I thought my little Sarah and
[53:17] Rebecca going to have to be raised up in
[53:20] a world like that God why why this is BR
[53:26] Brown
[53:29] why don't you just destroy the
[53:34] thing take it all off I don't see how
[53:37] you can stand it
[53:39] Lord so the prophet so that that was
[53:42] high level of
[53:43] filthiness Lord why can't you destroy
[53:46] this and imagine the angel of God is
[53:49] asking God to destroy you that would
[53:52] happen this the the angel of God Speak
[53:55] speaking
[53:56] here and to look at s at such thing as
[53:59] that I was standing there doing what
[54:03] criticizing her this brother Bram you
[54:08] know one thing that I like about our
[54:10] prophet he was so sincere he was just
[54:13] telling the truth everything as it
[54:16] happened he was not trying to turn
[54:18] himself as a holy person am he was
[54:22] saying everything right amen because he
[54:25] couldn't forget where God got him
[54:28] from I was standing there criticizing
[54:31] her the two drunks with her got up and
[54:35] went out to be gone just for a while and
[54:37] just then I felt something moving on
[54:40] me I went back and sat down a little B A
[54:44] little booth to the side nobody
[54:48] paid any attention to me yet I was in
[54:51] the dark in the corner and there God
[54:54] gave me a
[54:57] vision because God saw the prophets
[55:00] criticizing that old poor thing why
[55:03] can't you destroy her Lord and then the
[55:06] Lord came with a vision hey hey forget
[55:09] not brother BR forget
[55:11] that and changed my mind and things the
[55:16] vision that he got from the Lord changed
[55:18] his mind and everything am I looked
[55:22] there and I saw a world and there the
[55:25] world was look like a red stke just uh
[55:29] as spray something said this is the
[55:32] blood of of the Lord Jesus who died to
[55:35] save
[55:36] Sinners that's the reason that God can
[55:41] destroy he can't see her he can't every
[55:46] moral being has a right and has a right
[55:48] to accept their salvation until they die
[55:51] and go beyond that blood they don't have
[55:54] to stand in judgment they already judged
[55:56] the day you eat thereof that the day you
[55:58] die but as long as you're here you got
[56:01] right you got a right to the threee of
[56:04] life if you'll accept it listen now then
[56:08] I looked and above it there stood the
[56:11] Lord Jesus in a vision and seeing his
[56:14] thorns on his head and blood running
[56:17] down his face and big Mercury speed over
[56:20] his precious beard and he was jerking
[56:23] his head like that you know uh every
[56:26] once in a while jumping like that I
[56:29] thought what is that my
[56:33] Lord all this Vision because the
[56:35] prophets criticized
[56:37] someone a huge Vision like this just
[56:40] because he criticized an
[56:44] unbeliever and he said that's your
[56:49] sin this is the scene of brother Bram
[56:51] that's your scene everything that you
[56:54] see in the vision
[56:55] that's you
[56:56] sin and I seen that the blood of Jesus
[57:01] to my own sins was acting like a
[57:05] bumper now the Lord is showing the
[57:08] prophet his own sins and the blood of
[57:11] Jesus acting like a bumper on his own
[57:14] sins I wish all of us we need such
[57:19] Visions amen am if it have went beyond
[57:25] that stream of blood there that was
[57:27] ground the earth when he died to settle
[57:30] this uh the sin question if it have went
[57:33] beyond that then God would have killed
[57:36] me just like the bumper to the car to
[57:39] keep your car from being hot the bumper
[57:43] catches the the leak and the blood of
[57:45] Jesus catches your sins father forgive
[57:48] them they don't know what they're doing
[57:50] father forgive them and I look
[57:53] there my why there my name laying there
[57:58] on the old book wrote all kind of things
[58:03] condemned on the name of brother William
[58:06] brandham I crawled up to his feet and I
[58:09] said Lord Jesus will you forgive me then
[58:13] you know he was the one criticizing now
[58:16] he's the one asking for Mercy yes sir
[58:20] because sometimes we think that we are
[58:22] better than someone else oh he just came
[58:24] to church today he's
[58:26] not he's behaving weirdly he's not a
[58:31] brother but remember you were not born a
[58:35] brother you were not born with the Holy
[58:37] Ghost you had to seek the Holy Ghost you
[58:40] had to pray for God to change you amen
[58:43] you had to pray to be baptized amen
[58:45] because all of us for all the people
[58:48] here if you look 20 years
[58:50] back you were not what you are today
[58:53] unless you lie but you were were
[58:55] not you are something else and now
[58:58] you're making a progress on a daily
[59:01] basis as you come to church you are
[59:03] changing your mind sir this Vision
[59:06] changed the prophet mind and when you
[59:09] condemn someone and you read back the
[59:11] word is going to change your mind amen
[59:14] and all kind condemned I crawled up I
[59:17] said Lord Jesus will you forgive me I
[59:20] didn't mean I said you mean my sins hurt
[59:24] you like that
[59:26] what God Said
[59:29] Yes he took his hand and dipped it in
[59:32] his side took his finger and wrote
[59:34] across the book pardoned you are
[59:37] pardoned put it back behind him like
[59:39] that put his arms together and looked at
[59:41] me he said I forgive
[59:43] you didn't I and I I said yes Lord I
[59:47] love you for it he said but I love this
[59:50] question that they asked the prophet now
[59:52] you are forgiven now you have the Holy
[59:54] Ghost
[59:55] everybody who's here let's suppose you
[59:56] have the Holy Ghost and now the angel of
[59:59] God Jesus himself asking brother Bram
[1:00:03] you are pardoned but why are you
[1:00:06] condemning her
[1:00:08] why why are you condemning her because
[1:00:13] you see in the book you are forgiven you
[1:00:15] are
[1:00:16] pardoned so why then you don't think she
[1:00:19] deserve the same
[1:00:22] pardon amen you were willing to condemn
[1:00:25] someone else but look you was condemned
[1:00:29] you was condemned once yourself and
[1:00:32] freely he pardoned you he said but why
[1:00:35] you condemning
[1:00:37] her that changed my
[1:00:41] motive that changed my
[1:00:44] motive amen sir soon as I got out of the
[1:00:48] vision I walked over there to her you
[1:00:51] know he was
[1:00:53] sincere God BL William brandham he
[1:00:56] didn't say okay thank you Lord it's done
[1:00:58] he walked over to that
[1:01:01] lady I said Madam could I talk to you a
[1:01:04] minute she said oh I have a company I
[1:01:07] said I don't mean it I don't mean it
[1:01:09] that way lady I'm a minister of the
[1:01:11] Gospel I want to talk to you she took
[1:01:13] her cigarette down and she said yes
[1:01:16] sir and I said why are you living this
[1:01:20] like this now the prophet is sweet right
[1:01:24] for the first at the beginning was like
[1:01:26] Lord destroy this poor thing but now
[1:01:29] he's like why are you living like that
[1:01:31] the
[1:01:32] sweetness the sweetness now is coming
[1:01:34] down I said you don't really really
[1:01:37] enjoy it are you a mother she said yes
[1:01:41] and she gave me her story and it was a
[1:01:45] broken a heartbroken story you know some
[1:01:48] time we judge people without knowing
[1:01:50] what they've been through and we just so
[1:01:53] quick to judge but at least you have to
[1:01:56] to learn and to listen to the story of
[1:01:59] that
[1:02:00] person the prophet say it was a
[1:02:03] heartbroken
[1:02:05] story a picture of Life uh at the side
[1:02:08] disappointment and Things She Said sir I
[1:02:11] was raised in a Christian home I told
[1:02:15] her why the Lord Jesus rebuked me for
[1:02:18] condemning her and wanted her blow up
[1:02:20] for something like that I said lady I
[1:02:23] want to ask you
[1:02:25] will you forgive me for having such
[1:02:27] thought about
[1:02:29] you the lady didn't know that the
[1:02:31] prophet will criticizing her but brother
[1:02:34] Bram now is
[1:02:36] repenting you know uh most of the time
[1:02:38] you'll see people repenting maybe
[1:02:40] because they stole money maybe because
[1:02:43] they messed up some way or another but
[1:02:46] I've never seen in my life someone
[1:02:48] repenting like
[1:02:51] this brother excuse me I could
[1:02:54] criticized you I've never seen that in
[1:02:56] my life other than this in this
[1:02:59] quote we repent for what we've qualified
[1:03:02] to be uh big
[1:03:06] sins something that was seen by
[1:03:08] everybody something that is training on
[1:03:10] the news but this was just in his heart
[1:03:14] but he had to make it right you want
[1:03:16] brother sister Madam will you forgive me
[1:03:20] for having such thoughts about
[1:03:22] you I was asking the Lord to kill you
[1:03:26] but he rebuked
[1:03:28] me you know if uh we get this kind of
[1:03:31] attitude we can have some beautiful
[1:03:34] assemblies where you just criticize a
[1:03:36] brother and at the end of the service
[1:03:37] you go there brother Israel I'm sorry I
[1:03:39] criticize you when we were preaching
[1:03:42] sorry that would even that for me will
[1:03:45] be a sign that the Rapture is ready that
[1:03:47] we're about to be raptured because now
[1:03:50] we are conscious yes sir we are not
[1:03:52] waiting for someone to come to to tell
[1:03:54] us hey go there and make it right you
[1:03:56] feel a burden in your heart because a
[1:03:58] true son and daughter of God when you've
[1:04:00] done something that is not according to
[1:04:02] to the word the word in enough is a
[1:04:05] judge your conscience won't be a peace
[1:04:08] that's right you cannot critize a
[1:04:10] brother a sister and go to the
[1:04:13] restaurant have your lunch in
[1:04:15] peace what kind of Holy Ghost do you
[1:04:18] have right very and you come back and
[1:04:21] they bring the Lord's supper and you are
[1:04:22] the first on the line we like you don't
[1:04:25] even feel nothing in your
[1:04:27] heart and but Isel standing here and you
[1:04:30] just take the cup you drink knowing that
[1:04:33] in your heart you have something against
[1:04:35] a brother you criticize her in the
[1:04:37] morning oh my and you just and you take
[1:04:40] even the
[1:04:42] bread yet the Bible told us examine
[1:04:45] yourself first before coming forth
[1:04:47] before coming to drink that that is not
[1:04:49] a drink like a h an energy drink or you
[1:04:52] know whatever drink that's something
[1:04:54] else that's the blood of Jesus and when
[1:04:57] we are approaching the blood of Jesus
[1:04:59] your
[1:05:00] conscience has to be working
[1:05:04] functioning
[1:05:07] amen she's she I said will you kneel
[1:05:10] down here she said certainly she she
[1:05:13] forgave the prophet she forgave the
[1:05:15] prophet she said certainly and she said
[1:05:17] will you pray for me that I'll be saved
[1:05:20] I said will you kneel down down here she
[1:05:24] said I will we turn that place into the
[1:05:28] prayer meeting that's night that's right
[1:05:32] that's woman got saved see God will
[1:05:34] provide won't he God will provide he has
[1:05:37] already provided a way to escape for
[1:05:39] everyone it started with
[1:05:43] criticism bad feelings and it ended up
[1:05:47] being a prayer
[1:05:50] meeting
[1:05:52] amen they forgave each other
[1:05:54] she got saved job well
[1:05:58] done why because the prophet repented
[1:06:03] first but most of the time we don't
[1:06:05] progress in this life because we have
[1:06:08] very hard
[1:06:10] heart no matter what no matter who can
[1:06:13] preach you're not ready to make it
[1:06:16] right you're not ready to open up your
[1:06:19] hearts it's like Pharaoh's
[1:06:22] heart he couldn't repent at all no
[1:06:25] matter how hard the Lord would hit
[1:06:28] plagues in Egypt Pharaoh could never
[1:06:32] repent and there is a quote that brother
[1:06:34] Israel read this morning they were made
[1:06:36] to be that way some people are just
[1:06:39] naturally that
[1:06:41] way
[1:06:42] amen but the prophet
[1:06:45] repented this is Brother William
[1:06:47] brandham repenting to an
[1:06:50] unbeliever not his fellow preacher not
[1:06:53] his fellow brother a nonbeliever again a
[1:06:59] lady but brother Bram he
[1:07:02] repented but why don't we make things
[1:07:06] right how can we have a a lot of talk of
[1:07:12] anger hatred in our hearts you know
[1:07:15] against brothers and you go to the same
[1:07:20] church God sees
[1:07:22] you because you know uh you can fool
[1:07:25] everybody but you cannot fool God he
[1:07:29] knows you he sees what is in your heart
[1:07:30] even right now he knows what you
[1:07:32] thinking about me even right now he
[1:07:35] knows what is going on in your heart
[1:07:37] because you can't hide God anything the
[1:07:41] devil knows what is going on and your
[1:07:43] own conscience knows what is going on
[1:07:47] Amen in the message our hope is in God
[1:07:52] 15 more minutes brother Isel so I'm
[1:07:53] looking at the clock today now it's been
[1:07:56] 30 minutes 15 more
[1:07:59] amen all right God bless you br Chris
[1:08:02] because most of the time when we
[1:08:04] preaching about repentance people are
[1:08:06] cold on now people don't want to hear
[1:08:08] things like this people need you're
[1:08:10] going to be blessed you're going to be
[1:08:12] raptured how you going to be raptured
[1:08:14] with all that stock of anger that you
[1:08:16] have in your heart that's not
[1:08:19] true you're still looking down on people
[1:08:21] how are you going to be raptured
[1:08:24] amen there is no Rapture without true
[1:08:28] love in your heart first because 1
[1:08:30] Corinthians 13 tells us no matter what I
[1:08:34] can do without love even if you come to
[1:08:37] church on Wednesday night you come in
[1:08:39] the prayer meeting on Saturday morning
[1:08:42] you drink that coffee cuz we have a
[1:08:44] coffee most on Saturday morning we take
[1:08:46] a coffee you take that coffee and on
[1:08:48] Sunday you come uh to uh to both
[1:08:51] Services if you have no love in your
[1:08:53] heart heart you are just a
[1:08:58] pilgrim if you do everything in the
[1:09:01] church correctly to get God approval you
[1:09:04] need to have love am you love everybody
[1:09:09] yes sir you you're not going you're not
[1:09:11] going to be there judging people judging
[1:09:13] people Jud they're not right they're not
[1:09:14] right you know when you read the Bible
[1:09:16] the Bible says Daniel was praying for
[1:09:19] his sin and the sins of his people
[1:09:24] that's the heart that we need if you
[1:09:26] think there is something that's not
[1:09:27] going right pray for
[1:09:30] them that will prove that you have the
[1:09:33] spirit of God but just don't be oh you
[1:09:36] see the way they do things see the way
[1:09:38] they do things who are you who appointed
[1:09:40] you to be the judge in the the judge in
[1:09:42] the
[1:09:44] church even if you preach and that
[1:09:46] person is not changing his time will
[1:09:49] come because we preachers we not the one
[1:09:52] who change people we just repeat the
[1:09:54] word of God and God himself takes care
[1:09:58] of the
[1:10:00] Soul amen but we need to be
[1:10:05] patient those who are strong in faith
[1:10:08] support those who are
[1:10:11] weak
[1:10:12] Amen in the message our hope is in
[1:10:16] God this is also a good one it's short
[1:10:19] but it's a good
[1:10:20] one he preached this on on September
[1:10:24] 29th
[1:10:26] 1951 we start on paragraph
[1:10:30] 12 that's what we are we should
[1:10:34] always is try to do something to help
[1:10:38] somebody
[1:10:39] else after all that's the Christian
[1:10:43] attitude toward
[1:10:45] things so there is no you can't call
[1:10:48] yourself a Christian if you don't have
[1:10:50] that heart that that is ready to help
[1:10:53] somebody
[1:10:55] else the prophet tells us it's all about
[1:10:57] that that's the Christian
[1:11:00] altitude he says this is a great heavy
[1:11:05] burden that no one knows nothing about
[1:11:07] that just God and I alone but when I uh
[1:11:10] uh when I do get to the bed to bed uh
[1:11:14] what a wonderful privilege I have to
[1:11:16] kneel down before God and say father
[1:11:18] I've done the best that I uh that I know
[1:11:21] how today I've done all uh that I know
[1:11:24] how to make life just a little more
[1:11:26] pleasant for
[1:11:29] people to make life a little more
[1:11:32] pleasant for
[1:11:35] people not to be there judging people
[1:11:38] make life a little bit Pleasant for
[1:11:40] people sir
[1:11:42] amen and I'm sure with his blessings he
[1:11:45] turns and and returns and make life a
[1:11:48] little more blessing for
[1:11:50] me
[1:11:52] now brother Le
[1:11:54] listen to this my friend if you want to
[1:11:57] do something for
[1:11:59] God do something for his
[1:12:02] people if you want something good said
[1:12:06] about you cuz some people they want to
[1:12:08] be
[1:12:09] praised they want everybody to clap
[1:12:11] hands for them they want you know to be
[1:12:13] lifted up they want you know like all
[1:12:15] best testimony is to be toward them
[1:12:18] who's a good preacher him who's a good
[1:12:21] one him he want they want to be the best
[1:12:25] of the best in everything so here is the
[1:12:28] advice of the
[1:12:29] Prophet if you want to you want
[1:12:32] something good said about you say
[1:12:35] something good about someone
[1:12:38] else that's how it works it's like a
[1:12:41] circle say something good about the
[1:12:43] brother someone there will say something
[1:12:45] good about
[1:12:46] you
[1:12:48] amen bless someone else and your
[1:12:51] blessing uh bless someone else and as
[1:12:54] you are blessing someone else you are
[1:12:57] blessing
[1:13:00] God Jesus said in so much as you have
[1:13:03] done unto the least of these my little
[1:13:05] ones you have done it to me so we know
[1:13:08] that is the truth so may the Lord bless
[1:13:11] us tonight now as we read his
[1:13:15] word you need God bless him bless
[1:13:17] someone else you need a a good testimony
[1:13:21] about you say a good testimony about
[1:13:24] somebody
[1:13:26] else there is no Christianity with
[1:13:30] selfishness
[1:13:32] no you are filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:35] pray for the next brother to to get the
[1:13:37] same holy ghost that you

[1:13:47] Revelation that you know if we can get

[1:19:14] climbing up the steps again until 2 or
[1:19:16] 3:00 in the morning praying and seemed
[1:19:19] like he just talking to the wind down in
[1:19:22] his Jewish heart there burnt a faith
[1:19:25] that no Winds of Doubt could ever blow
[1:19:28] out that's the kind of men and women we
[1:19:31] need to rise on on the scene today if he

[1:19:38] tomorrow night amen if he doesn't answer
[1:19:41] this year we are just two month away to

[1:19:50] God not a God but a god but the God Amen
[1:19:55] and we see him night after night as
[1:19:57] amram climed up the stes and and Jo
[1:20:01] Joseph would come uh up to him and say
[1:20:04] amram dear you you you've been up here
[1:20:07] praying all night why don't you just
[1:20:09] tell some of the boys where you're
[1:20:11] working and let them pray a while well

[1:20:26] waiting for somebody else but take the
[1:20:30] front yourself brother take the
[1:20:34] fron ourselves and go through if we
[1:20:37] believe the Bible to be a history it's
[1:20:40] also prophetic book that tells us that
[1:20:42] same God shall rise in the last days and
[1:20:45] it's time for him to come on the scene
[1:20:48] we are finishing here uh paragraph 60
[1:20:51] and seemingly with we've had a silent
[1:20:53] God for a long time by the hour has come
[1:20:58] where he's going to rise on the scene
[1:21:01] amen one night when amram had prayed
[1:21:05] maybe for several years and his ha now
[1:21:09] was turning gray and no Deliverance but
[1:21:12] just getting worse sometime we pray and
[1:21:15] the situation gets worse brother the
[1:21:17] more you pray the more worse the
[1:21:20] situation is getting that's why you have
[1:21:23] to hold on Don't Run Away don't run
[1:21:27] don't murmur hold on be determined even
[1:21:32] if it's getting worse praise God you you
[1:21:35] asking God for a job you apply the next
[1:21:37] day they reject you the same
[1:21:40] day you pray again you fast you apply
[1:21:43] they reject you hold on brother Don't
[1:21:46] Run Away amen he says it was just
[1:21:50] getting worse
[1:21:53] one night he got right down to to
[1:21:55] business that's how we have to do it get
[1:21:58] right down to business he said God you
[1:22:02] promised this and we've looked forward
[1:22:04] to it and we see the signs all here and
[1:22:06] the time is ahead it's time for you to
[1:22:09] do something about it while he was deep
[1:22:12] concentrated prayer praying with all his
[1:22:15] heart he looked standing in the corner
[1:22:19] he wbed his eyes and looked again
[1:22:21] there's two an angel with a sword W with
[1:22:26] a sword drawn he said Deliverance is

[1:22:33] into the world and he's going to be the
[1:22:37] one to deliver them oh my what an
[1:22:42] answer praying asking God for a solution
[1:22:45] and then the angel of the Lord tells you
[1:22:47] the solution is coming from you brother
[1:22:50] you're going to bring a sign in the word
[1:22:52] and he's going to deliver you amen why
[1:22:57] he leave I wonder what was the night how
[1:23:00] was that night for brother amam and then

[1:23:09] prayers amen God bless you my time is
[1:23:15] up just hold on
