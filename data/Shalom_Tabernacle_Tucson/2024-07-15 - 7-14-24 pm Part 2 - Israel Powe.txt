========================================

and godly fear and Brotherly Love Takes its place in the human heart then you'll become salty then the message will have its preeminence in the heart it'll have its influence in the city he said that in Phoenix huh yes here brother vam has asked a question on stubbornness and God being misunderstood any of y'all stubborn in here don't don't confess it now say you're fighting stubbornness I'm not stubborn but something stubborn likes to get on me every now and I'm fighting against a stubborn right because I'm a Christian we're ain't going to be no stubbornness in heaven and that's where I'm going brother Zach by God's grace I'll see you there will you dance with me on the streets of Glory yes ain't going to be no stubbornness over there so Believers you know we fight against those Spirits I'm fighting against them all the time all the days of our life we fight against them they ask brother Rand a question question 137 in the message God being misunderstood 1961 brother brandom I am saved I've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but how do I get away from a stubborn spirit that I can't seem to break away from this is paragraph number 46 in the message God being misunderstood so they ask the question how do I get away so it's obviously a Christian Christians are the ones who care anyways and so they want to get rid of this well my Christian brother or sister whoever it may be now most times when you find people that's got stubborn Spirits it's usually a complex that causes this either they have inherited from a mother father uncle aunt or grandmother grandfather somebody like that and if you'll trace it back down through your life you'll find now I've taken this by experience under discernment because I have met cases on the platform thousands of those that had that Spirit and the first thing you know I chased that Spirit right back by discernment and find that there was a granddaddy there was a grandmother there was somebody else back down there and you inherit that by Nature so it's true it comes by inheritance by nature but now he's tracing it down now now he find out where it come through granddaddy had it it come through by Nature so you have it and now how do we deal with it and he says so stubbornness stubborn stubbornness is not of God and the only way to get away from this is you have to have faith to overcome that that you you are a Christian you are a son or daughter of God whichever you may be and you'll never be able just to stand and rebuke it and rebuke it and rebuke it it's just like tantalizing a rattlesnake he's laying there ready to bite you if you'll just ignore him and walk away from him he can't hurt you see so when you feel that you got a stubborn Spirit lay the thing on the alar and believe God the thing is dead and you'll never have it no more go on and don't even pay any attention to it no more and the thing will leave you resist the devil and he'll flee from you let's get away quickly so that's would be my advice how to overcome it we overcome the Devil by faith that's what we overcome all evil is by faith Faith how many can say Amen to that how do we overcome all evil by faith my goodness what if he would have said stubbornness is from from all the Capricorns or the Tauruses or the Geminis what if he would have did that to us he' be like oh man but stubbornness is not from God we like to do that say where where was you born I know what you up toil you now we do it no matter we when he traces it down you find out you got a stubborn Spirit then you got to deal with it how do you deal with it by faith that's how you deal with all evil you don't make excuses for it you don't pet it you deal with it by faith now praise the Lord thank God for his word amen amen stubbornness is not of God Satan wants you to be stubborn that's right he wants you to have a stiff you don't want you to bend he wants you to do it your way huh when you get married and you have kids and that stubborn Spirit rise up you going to have a battle bro you going to have a battle sis you get two stubborn ones in the house be locking horns all night but God have mercy on us y'all know what I'm talking about yeah yes yes stubborn no I'm just not you know and you know but you know we want to get rid of that we don't want we don't want that taking over we don't want those Spirits my pride getting into it I don't have to be right that's right I want the Holy Spirit working through me and I want to get and overcome that by faith now this um this Ephesians chapter 6 as as the Apostle Paul is bringing this H H uh the the the the armor of God put on the whole armor of God and then at the end of the verse there he says and praying always Ephesians 6 quickly and so he puts in this whole armor of God he puts you know the helmet The Shield the sword the with your feet covered the breastplate your loins you're completely covered and then Verse 18 says praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and then he says and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in my bonds oh my what a prayer Lord if the Saints would pray for me that I would open my mouth when I ought to and be bold with these things of God if the Lord would open the mouth of the brothers that handled the word that they would be bold with it amen praying always as we take this whole armor of God now these Spirits as we talked about and as we know and we've identified the spirits that are for our on our city and many other cities too but this is what what he brought out for our city and we see that one of the things he talked about was this proel liting and the competition between others and I I stopped here with this um brother Walker's dream this morning and maybe I won't get to it tonight I'll just close right here prepare to close here back in the message Paradox now this message Paradox as he was bringing this uh to the people 1961 he said that he was on sitting on a narrow Highway with a brother and you get a chance go get that it's in the paradox December 12th 1961 he explains this spiritual happening to him I believe it happens for us he recorded it for us to hear it he's sitting on a narrow Highway with a brother he said everybody was afraid and then a voice said to him in paragraph number 60 it says he heard that voice say there is such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you I wonder Saints brother George as you travel and you cross and you see you hear different you're in contact with many other congregations and people I wonder if this is what has happened with many of the people that have fallen a away have they been struck by this Mamba and brother Brandon brings it to us that there's great danger in these days the voice says there is such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you Oh my he so he's on this narrow Highway with this Brethren and he said that the sin represents sin and death and then this thing tried to approach him one way and then he tries to come and get him another way and then finally it goes after his friend this brother that was with him and his brother was screaming and jumping and trying to not get bit by this black mamba this Death Strike he was trying to stay he was on a narrow Highway trying to save his life that's like you or I you know this hour that we're living is a very serious hour and people are getting struck all the time you wonder where where they got struck at they come back with a bad Spirit on them and they have a different idea towards the message and the messenger and the landscape today is not what it was 20 years ago I guarantee you these attitudes these flexes against the message it's just that we haven't seen it before and where did it come from but here's a spiritual dream that the prophet gives to us and tells us about this black mamba he's on the narrow road there and trying to strike this brother and then he cried out Lord please save my brother and when he cries out for his brother that snake turns back to him and comes after him again and then the voice speaks to him and says you've been given power to bind him but you must be more sincere amen thank you there just then the serpent turned to me when I said that looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any and I said well God what must I do he said there is one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere I said well God forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity when I raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something and I looked at the serpent and then he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and I said Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and The Serpent and blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like a s capital s made backwards a an sign it means bind this one or anything below him CU he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him his tail choked his own self to death around his head when he made this backward s that an sign like a conjunction you see choked it to death and the brother was free and I went over and masked on it and said now I've got to find out about this because it's a vision and I hit on the one thing and it turned like that looked like a handle on a glass handle on a pitcher just made it solid Crystal and I said think of that how quick that blue smoke was life and everything it left it all the elements and it turned to Glass just then the voice came again and said you can unbind him also so I said then Satan that I might know I unbind you when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and I said said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ when it did the smoke flew out of him and again he choked himself right back again and turned to Crystal and then when he did that the voice says now you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then it left me and I was standing in the room a few minutes later the clock went off he says and then he says he starts to go through he picks up his Bible and he wants the Lord to show him what this all means he says I I don't do this often or he's not encouraging us to do it and he opens up his Bible and his finger falls in the scripture now here's our answer in First Corinthians chapter 5 let's turn there we read it verse seven Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump and as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast with old leaven neither let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth now brother Rand says now he was coming to a fast and here's where he says a feast with the Lord is a fast in the body and we brought that message to the church here about the power of fasting didn't we and that is something that we can we can do that believers do can do that the fasting will help you get into the frame of of sincerity it will it will uh it's sobriety there because you're you're you're draining the body from you know what it would normally have and all of the energy for that now it goes spiritually towards your mind your thinking and in the realm of the spirit we know that Jesus said though said that there's a power in fasting and that's it's another level in your prayer life and Lord make me more sincere he was coming to a fast and this fasting and prayer is how some stubborn Devils won't move until you step up your prayer life and fasting and prayer give me a church that would do that give me a pastor that would do that give me the Deacon board that would do that give me the church that have a special meeting around that that's that's more powerful wouldn't you say but it requires a sacrifice it requires time it requires energy it's not an easy thing to do especially when we're eating all the time and all the Temptations to eat all the time what about a prayer meeting not not just daydreaming I'm talking about prayer in the spirit really laboring at the on the horns of the Altar for some of these stubborn devils in our midst some of these stubborn demons trying to attack our homes and our children in the laws in this city where our children go to school and all these neighborhoods and foolishness nextest door and whoever's doing what that whatever they're doing God give us the power to bind these spirits and that we can go free you know we can have that but it's going to require a sacrifice amen Saints it requires a bit more and the voice of the Lord tells the brother Bram you need to be more sincere you're not going to tell god well I was already sincere you're not going to do that with God God say you need to be more sincere that's what he told the prophet he don't know nothing to argue about it's like forgive me for my insincerity Lord help us now this this I'm going to close here this brother Walker's dream and this is what I've seen this is just some of my own little thoughts that I've seen over the years and I've seen it growing this competition amongst the churches and amongst other ministers but it really starts with com competition against brother brandom and this vision is showing here where brother brandom as a military prance a military horse with the the Indian Garb as a chief he's got this Authority we read it for you this morning remember how many remember and then I stopped at paragraph 261 let's pick it up from paragraph 262 and then you just you let this you let this Vision speak to you don't say don't make it say something that doesn't say but there is a spiritual application here I believe that and I know that Spirits don't die this little man on this little horse trying to knock off the prophet who's already been established I've seen that already so you don't have to tell me this quote don't mean that I've seen it with my own two eyes and these Spirits want to rise up and flex against the prophet bump him off of the horse well he ain't here you know bump him off you got a little bitty horse right you barely even got got a horse he's trying to bump the prophet off why did God show The Prophet this dream can I get into it brother Ben brother Ben said okay paragraph 262 when it did is I seen this man that called himself a prophet you know said he come up a horse that was mixed with white and black together he said he got up behind this great big horse said it was said way up above the clouds and the road wasn't over about that wide so you see another narrow road there and said the horse just danced to the wind blowing the feathers and everything on your guardar and then then the horse man and tail blowing Great Master big white horse walking right in line and said this guy ran up behind you come from towards Canada and the man lives in Canada he said come back and said he took his little horse trying to knock your big horse off turning him around make his hips hit against said it never moved the big horse he just kept walking he man I like that I can preach a sermon right there don't be moved just keep walking walk in the spirit my brother you got a vision you got a focus you got something to preach on preach that and keep walking that's it that's what we're doing tonight then all of a sudden said you turn turned around and said that would be the third time you had spoke but the second time you said all right and said you didn't speak like you did you commanded so you turned around and called The Man by name and said get off of here you know that a man can ride this road here without God be that no man can ride this road here without God be ordaining him to do it get off of here and so the man turned around and said said the man has wrote me letters across his horse H horse's hips the black and gray mixed up together said across his horse's hips was wrote his name signature just like he has on his letter and he wrote off towards the north said then you went on down that big horse turned around way as far west as you could said you stood and raised your raised excuse me you stood and raised your hands up like that then he started crying said brother brandham to see that war that horse standing there all that wore Bonnet and everything like that it said that breastplate and everything shine said you held your hands up a little while and said you looked down again picked up the rains and said I'll ride this Trail just once more said the whole earth Shook Back and Forth like that he said there was no more life left in me I just fell down aside The Rock then I woke up said what does it mean sir I said I don't know we know it meant something and we know that it shook brother Walker up and we know that brother bam uses that later on in streetport I will ride this Trail again we know that he was on the dream showed him on a horse we know that the authority was given to him and this little Ministry tries to knock him off the competition that we've seen growing yes and guess what Saints it's going to continue to grow they'll Flex against they'll they start you know we we're not following the man and then they start you know they don't want to hear the quotes no more get rid of the pictures and then y'all two message ye and so forth and so on but beyond the curtain of time they didn't have a problem with lifting him up on a high place said what did you br me up here because on Earth you were a leader a leader of men a leader of ministers a leader of families a leader of teachers and preachers a leader of young people a leader on how to run a church I don't got a problem with Following the Leader amen God help me to stay sincere help me to keep myself in line and not let these spirits of competition get on me get on you get on any of us keep those Spirits off of us even the stubborn ones we bring we drag them spirits to the altar bring them to every tape service bring them to every church service and let the power of God begin to melt them Spirits away God bless you we believe that he will do that amen don't you love the Lord amen God bless you richly if the musicians will come Lord bless you
