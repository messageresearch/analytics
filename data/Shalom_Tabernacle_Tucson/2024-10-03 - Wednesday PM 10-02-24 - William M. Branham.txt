brandom baptismal service I believe they have the pool filled up and uh communion and foot washing how many people in here ever was had a foot washing let's see your hands oh my look at the Baptist that's in here this morning you know they say the footwash Baptist and uh thing old and I used to go to foot wash Baptist and only wash one feet just one foot and now here we wash both feet a double blessing you see have two blessings in one if it's a blessing you wash one foot yard try both one night the foot wash bapti well it depends on what kind of service we have this morning we don't know just what it will be tonight because we of um how the service is this morning uh kind tired we just come from Mexico where I had one of the one most marvelous meetings we've ever had and I know many of you are interested to hear of it so uh we was down there for three nights had three nights of service and the our Blessed Redeemer certainly did do the exceeding abundantly down there the last night we had 20,000 people that have never come to Christ in any manner receive Jesus as personal savior at one time 20,000 at one time a resurrection of a little baby that died in its mother's arms while standing on the ground and the doctor had said the day before it was going to die and she had brought it to the meeting to be prayed bar and the people were standing like they are around here you think it's pretty bad here for we Americans to have to stand hour but they would come in sometimes at 6:00 at morning and stand till 11: that night and they were so jammed together till they estimate how much ground we had for them to stand on and they were standing six people every 3 Square fet six people just standing jammed together leaning against each other I said it reminded me of sheep you know when the heat of the day is on the sheep all get together and they stand against another and they make shade for each other and they support each other so that's the way the Sheep of God should do kind of Stand Together F places and support one another with our faith now every person and your own way of praying whichever way you pray at your church you pray this morning and we are going to read some of God's word and because of those who are standing as we come up they just turning the people away and away and said they've been turning away for quite a long time so now we're going to be real quick and speak on the word so you can have a ground for Faith and then after that then we're going to pray for the sick uh the way the Lord will I've been wanting to have our first opening service to take the people away the vision it just showed but I don't know where I'm going to be able to do that or not the rooms are Jam full in there to get them away from the public trust that you'll try to hold on just for a little while and pray now the first thing I believe that all Doctrine must come from God's Eternal blessed word amen for faith cannot rest upon the shifting SS of Theology of man it must be based upon the unmovable Rock of God's word therefore a person can rest assure that if God has said it God will perform what he said in the message this morning we were talking on how that God before perhaps 10,000 years before there's ever a World Jesus Christ was slain before the foundation of the world God spoke it and that said it as long as God speaks it that makes it right and in God's mind when he speaks the word it's already confirmed in heaven that's how perfect it is up there so how much ought we martal who have been redeemed by his grace trust his his word if his word said so that settled now first the word the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God now before it could be a word it had to be a thought because a word is a thought expressed and God when he seen that the enemy of this world had was going to do what he did God thought how he would stand the great Plan of Redemption and when he thought it then he spoke it and it was as good as done right then and thousands of years later came the Lord Jesus Christ and died for sins and rose again some 1900 years ago this morning for our justification setting up his right hand now as a high priest making intercession Upon Our confession it's already finished and any word that comes out of God's Bible you can rest your soul upon that's the reason down in Mexico the most of the people down there are Catholic and being interviewed by Catholic man he said brother brandom do you believe that that our Saints can perform Miracles I said if they're living not dead and he said well he said um well you I said I he said what church are you with I said the Church of the Lord Jesus and he said what denomination is it now I said it isn't a denomination it's the body of Christ by one Spirit we all come together to believe and in there no matter what the man thinks it's his personal faith in Christ he said of course that Bible was the ancient history of the Catholic Church now I said well I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt I have I read many histories and I don't see where the Catholic church ever come into existence for 300 years and something after death the last Apostle but however I I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say it well then you can call me a Catholic of the old type because I believe the Bible that's right all right and I believe that every word can never be changed if God has once spoken in it forever the truth see see you and I keep learning more wisdom you know more now than you did a few years ago a little girl sitting here uh she's just a child her parents has to lead her after a while she'll grow up and probably in her day she progresses she might be smarter than her mother is now see because she keeps progressing but God is infant he can't change he has he he was he was perfect to begin with he'll be the same at the end he he can't change so whatever his attitude was towards anything in the Bible it has to be the same now or he did wrong the way he acted then see so he's got this never change so before we open up his word let us speak to the one who wrote it the Lord Jesus while we bow our heads our heavenly father today is one of the greatest days of the on the history of the Christian calendar it's the day of the Resurrection we pray heavenly father that he who is alive today and alive forever more will visit with us in these next few moments of speaking and praying for those poor people who are sick and needy today I humbly ask that you forgive us all of our sins and trespasses we do wrong we realize that because we're living in a wrong world with wrong motiv wrong Spirits wrong emotions but father thou knowest all these things so we are so thankful that we have Jesus who sets it right hand of the Majesty to make intercessions Upon Our confession that we are wrong and he promised to forgive us and we believe it and trusting get Glory out of the service today circumcise every heart to hear the word and the lips who speak it far we ask it in Christ's name Amen in the book of the Ephesians I wish to read these words I just love to read God's word wherefore the book first chapter beginning with the second 15th verse wherefore I also after I heard of your Fai in the Lord Jesus and love with all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of the calling and what is the riches of the glory of the inheritance of the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he has wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all all principalities and powers and might dominion and every name not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and given to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all and then over in the gospels of St Mark or Luke rather beginning about the [Music] 20 5th verse then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all things the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures and the things concerning himself and they drew not unto the village where they went and he made as though he would have gone farther but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is towards evening and the day is far spent and he went in and carry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight may the Lord add His blessings to his word enough scripture has been read till it would take us weeks and months to even halfway go to the context of this text but my subject this morning our text is a mighty conqueror and now we begin where we left off of the Resurrection where it proved what he was there's many mens who can make statements there's been many philosophers in the world Buddha muhamed confucious many other great philosophers they've all made statements that they were great people but death settled the question forever with them but never has there been a man outside of Christ who said I have power to lay my life down and to take it up again and could prove it that's the one beautiful thought of Christianity even today that as we speak of the Gospel we do not have to take a year say our historical thing about it because it can be proven right here this morning that Jesus Christ lives and Reigns and is raised from the dead and alive forever more after 2,000 years he's just as present as he was when he was walking in Galilee with his disciples doing the same thing performing the same Miracles showing the same Mercy preaching the same gospel he is not dead but alive forever more what happy heart that ought to make Christian and be today to know that it's not some purist philosophy that we're understanding but it is the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and as the great St Paul said in his days being the only educated one among the disciples he said I didn't come to you with the Excellency of word or with the speech of man that your faith would be trusting in such things but said I come to you with the power and demonstrations of the Holy Ghost that you're your uh Faith would rest in God something to that order how we love that and to know that the same thing that Paul preached in the days after the resurrection of Christ is just the same today and can be proven right here now infallible proofs that Jesus is alive today what a marvelous day it must have been for copius and his friends it was a beautiful Easter morning the first Easter morning brokenhearted as they went along the road the Bible said they were ignorant and unlearn man his apostles were they might not have know much about botney they might not have know much about um uh mathematics or or algebra or anything of that sort of our modern education they might not have know much about that but they know him and that's the main thing to know him is life remember that Christian friend and sinner friend to know Christ is life many people go and they learn a catechism they think that's life many people go and learn the Bible they think that's life many people know the doctrine of their Church they think that's life all those things are good but to know him personally as your personal individual savior that is life and that alone to know him it's good to know your catechism it's good to know your books it's good to know your doctrine of your church but all of that is the sideline but to know him is to know life and to to have life is to know him for he that heareth my words and believeth on him it sent me have everlasting life and shall never come into condemnation but pass from Death unto life Jesus made those statements and those are words that answer there's no more moon and stars those still words will still be in effect and just as powerful as it was the day that he spoken his words cannot fail now if you will listen closely on this Easter morning as they went along they were brokenhearted the man that they had trusted in the one that they thought was going to be the savior of Israel the one that they trusted to be the coming King had been miserably mistreated dead crucified buried and a seal put up his grave with the D of the Roman Garrison they ever touch it or the penalty of all Rome resting in it and if any man would break that seal they'd be put to death immediately Mary his beloved mother though she stood in Steam stripped down naked before the people beaten to a pop bones in his hands parted by the cruel Roman na and all these things and disgrace and heard him screaming for Mercy as he died thinking surely that no man of that caliber could ever die such a death but God works all things together for the good he had to bring in that as I said this morning how would you have confidence in your loved ones ever raising from the dead if if we only had en who was translated if Elijah who went home to heaven in a chariot if we only had them we'd be miserable but this man died he died until the sun know he was dead he died until the moon and stars know he was dead he died until everything in Earth and Heaven knew he was dead that he might die the death of every Mortal that ever lived amen because he died is because we live he died he was mistreated is he came into the World by the way of a barn no place to lay his head when he come on Earth and he was so rejected by the people he didn't have a place to Die the Earth refused him and Heavens couldn't have him because he was coming a sinner not with own sin but with our sins upon him he is bearing the sins of the world upon him so he was rejected in Heavens and the Earth didn't mourn him and they had to lift him up between heavens and earth and let him die outside of heaven and outside of the earth What A Savior how could you turn down such a person as that for modern theology are for the persons of people when you know that you've got to stand in his presence in that day of judgment give account for your life God won't hold you responsible for being a sinner he'll hold you responsible for rejecting the way out you can't help being a sinner you were borned your nature is a sinner but you can help it Jesus made the way for you and there he was after seeing all of that and surely How could a person thought Mary that not knowing a man I was packing water one day from the well and the Holy Ghost spoke to me in a big light and said that Holy thing which will be born to thee shall be called The Son of God how could God ever permit to see his own child hanging there suffering bleeding twisting dying how could it be they were looking at any time for him to turn from the cross pull his hands loose and Triumph over the enemies but they didn't realize if he did that then we'd be left Sinners this morning he had to do that they paid him the greatest compliment them Pharisees did that that crucified him they paid him the greatest compliment he was ever paid one they said he saved others but himself he cannot save they didn't realize that if he saved himself he couldn't save others he had to give himself in order to save others and it was a complimentary to him them not knowing it they were guilty of putting him to death but on Easter morning when God proved above a Shadow of Doubt that something more than a philosopher died something more than a prophet died man today in modern theology tried to make him preaching the Social Gospel as just a philosopher our good man or fine scholar a teacher he was more than that he was God himself made flesh among us he was divine his blood did not come from any mortal man but it come from the creative power of Jehovah God his father and he was divine and he proved it when he broke the seals of death and Rose on the third day here was many of the disciples all dishearten many things that come up in life just like we get ourselves along this journey they were on the road home going over to emus Copus and his companions walking along the road and how little did they know on this beautiful first Easter morning that Jesus Christ was alive and among the people they thought he was dead and as they did then so is it now many people who really love Jesus fail to understand that he's right with us living resurrected here Among Us they teach it as a historical Affair something and it is a history the Bible not only a history but it's a prophet also he's not only dead but he raised again he died truly but he rose again from the dead and there's many fine Christian people this morning who belong to fine churches who doesn't realize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and Alive among us today with the same Powers the same principles the same acts that he did when he was here on Earth littlest people know that and as they journeyed Along on their way down to emus about a Sabbath day Journey about couple of miles I guess on their road down walking along the side of the road they were speaking of his death I want you to notice just when they were speaking oh why could it ever happen how could it ever happen to us we've left your church now to follow this man who we thought surely would be the why we seen him raised Lazarus from the grave after been dead 4 days and how could a man that could raise a dead man from the grave every die but God works in his own way he just just like a seed goes into the ground and dies and brings forth again except the corner of wheat falls into the ground and abides Alone says the Bible so they was wondering but while they were thinking on him he appeared to them and that's the way he usually comes to us when you usually find your greatest blessing you Housewives when the children's all gone to school and you're out by yourself or the dishes or something when you're running the sweeper on the floor or something when do you man when you're sitting eating your lunch maybe by yourself and read the Bible on the side somewhere where you're on your road going home home in this car and you're meditating on if we would let the thoughts of our heart and the meditations of our mind be up on him he would appear often to us amen but the trouble we're thinking about where we're going to make the next dollar and what we're going to do here how this is going to be Jesus said all these things will be taken care of but seek ye first the kingdom of God but as they went along on the road that morning I can just see them oh my the greatest BL what ever happened to them here they was on the road that left the church excommunicated far fing they thought surely he would do something Triumph there at the grave then they were taken from their Church they couldn't return to church anymore and they'd be branded mocked at laughed at made fun of that's the way a man does when he really sells out for Christ he has to cut every Shoreline to walk alone with Christ him alone and men and women of this world who's ever mounted to anything or man and women who has predominantly taken Christ for their Savior and stood alone in their decisions it'll be the same way with every man here this morning or every woman boy or girl if you ever wish to amount anything go farward with God don't trust your church don't trust your preacher your Rabbi your priest but stand alone in Christ Jesus amen the only way you can do it don't if you're here be prayed for her this morning to be healed don't say oh if I can get to the affair to be prayed for her if brother Brandon can pray for me somebody else do this there put your trust alone in him and there know he raised from the dead and made the infallible promise and it can never fail God's word you see it noce and as they went along thinking he appeared to them and walked with them and they didn't rest recogniz him well there's been many times God's walked right with you and you didn't recognize him who kept you from that wreck the other day who did this who who was it out there at the hospital when the doctor said well you a hardly anything and more I can do and you got well who did that where did it come from you didn't recognize it but it was his grace it was he that did this thing for you a little lady may be present now I don't know she lived just across the street there she should be presid if she can get in unless she's G some outside of her place Mrs Reese I remember the time that when I went down there at the corner when Mr Andrews Liv next door to me across the street and that man laughed at me on the corner when I went that night when she was laying there right across the street here on the corners that's where she lived when she was in sickness and she' been taken from up at her own Silver Crest to die with TB and her lungs were all congested Up When Miss Grace Weber right second door here first door above the church was heal with TV right in the same time I believe I see the sister sitting here was he was cancer was nothing but a skeleton when the doctor turned her down a Miss sitting here with a pink flower on you what Weaver is that right yeah several years ago gold cancer went all through her eating her up healed with cancer because the Lord showed a vision down her house and said thus sayith the Lord you'll not die I baptized you here in this pool of water when I had to hold her her arms wasn't over that big round years she is alive yet today and that's been years ago how many more can I say in he the deaf dumb blind cancer eatting and so forth that God has healed because God made the promise that night while praying for the lady over on the corner the Holy Ghost came down she had her little children around her and her husband was sitting there and the Holy Spirit said thus saith the Lord she's going to be made well the next morning Mr Andrews that perfect Infidel met me at the corner and shame he said preacher aren't you ashamed of yourself I don't old pair of ragged overhaul com in the store to get some buns for breakfast and he was going over and he said shame on you would to see that family like that that poor little mother laying there those children dying and you telling her under a falsehood that she was going to be said sir I never told her that God said that in his words of truth said shame on you there's no such a thing is God only your a midle work up in emotions oh my a few days after that when his wife is stricken as a hospital year you know the story most of you and he had to come to me to go pray for a very renowned Christian woman I said sister L my wife which is here somewhere she got in the building this morning and we went to see her and as she was swollen didn't even know nothing the doctors of Lille said that a great blood clot run to her heart and she' be dead and it said any minute and he come with his hat pulled down crying he said preacher I've been an unbeliever but if God can help my wife he said that woman that you said that about some word doing her housework I said sure she lives yet today and that's been eight or 10 years ago and she's still living and the woman said he come across this commment of crying he said will you go pray for us I said yes sir but I want you to pray here first and let him see we went out the hospital and there she was laying there dying all swelled up her lips turned inside out like that and wife loved her and we knelt down she was a church member of the Christian Church in Virginia and we went and nailed and prayed for when was praying a vision come over I see myself sitting lean back back on that porch right there eating a big apple pie like this in my hand for she was a famous cook I raised up and I said honey thus sayth the Lord she's going to live and when she did and our two hours some man they had to call the specialist from all the water it passed from her and everything else and the specialist said somebody's been here besides a doctor what was it prise two weeks after that I passed the man on the same corner I'm looking at the tree right now he stopped there I said Mr Andrews we met here before he said yes we have preacher he was a scientist a Bist and I said what do you think about it now he looked over that big tree that I'm looking at he said preacher build me a tree oh it can't be done but because God because Christ raised from the dead that's it he's with us Mrs ree if she's present she's telling me here recently her and her daughter was over the river and this poor old woman begging on a corner she had a dime to get back on so she passed by and the Holy Ghost said to her go back and give that poor old woman that dime well she said it's all I got to cross the river he said I'm the Lord amen she went back and said sister forgive me put her arms around her said the Lord told me to come back and give her give you this dime her mother said mother how are we going to get home she said that's up to God we can walk the bridge maybe and when he turned around walked about a half a city block from there just before they come to the station to where they was to get on at her daughter said look here mother here lays the dime on the street what was it Christ he's with you many times and you don't know it that's him just follow way he leads you or he leads me I will follow I'll go with him all the way so through Valley dark and shadowy he will be with me every dayy and as he moved down Copus and then watch when Christ be to speak he and everyone off on some kind of a tantrum he went off on some kind of theology he opened up the scriptures that's the way he does it yet today and he began he said all foolish of heart sowh you so sad about said they said are you just a stranger sir oh man looked like he didn't dress like a rabbi or priest he dressed like an ordinary man so and he he walked among them they had been with him for three years and a half and they still didn't recognize him he said well he said why are you so slow of heart said well are you a stranger said don't you know that Jesus of Nazareth who we expected to be the King has been killed and buried and this is the third day he said and now we' had some women come to us this morning said they've seen a vision of some angels and we just considered it not and through all these things are going around Jerusalem like it is he said why are you so slowful of heart why are you so foolish didn't you believe the prophet oh my can't you believe the word but don't you know that all the prophets said that Christ must suffer first and then enter into his glory and he began with Moses that's Genesis and explained to them as he walked along the road all the precepts of the old test what was to take place wouldn't you like to been in company there that morning but you are this morning he's just as alive today as he was then he said I am he who was dead and as alive forever more and because I live ye shall live also you're not only is he here alive but you're alive with him this great hope that you have within Your Heart Makes You Alive believe in death itself has nothing that can shatter that beautiful hope that rest in Christ Jesus to every believer though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die he said oh when he went to the grave of Lazarus these words were spoken in St John 11 now as he walked along and after a while he made out like he's going to go on a pass the little place you know sometimes he does that have you ever thought of that mother you in the wheelchair look like it just going to pass you by youever think of it brothers sisters you people out there that's turned down today by cancer the doctors turned you down nothing they can do you that say well if that woman sitting there was just a shadow and the best of doctors and the cancer was in the uter his first wasn't his sister went into the spine and even the holes was eat to her intestinal tracks and things how could she live that's what her doctor said to me how can she live I said because he lives that's why it isn't for me to question it's for me to believe it Right Said thus sayith the Lord sister I've never been in your place but your little chicken house back here in 3 days you'll visited she did that's right she's here yet this morning because he lives he made out like he's going to let her die when I come to her house she said preacher I'm not worthy that a minister would come into my house I'm a sinner I said that's what Jesus died for for your siners his reputation's made where Sinners are that's right his reputation is not hurt by Sinners it's made by Sinners it's self-righteous is where he's hurt that's right that you won't humble yourselves to him notice and he made like he would pass by dad you have the heart trouble Mother you have the cancer it's going to die you know you got to die maybe you say well I've been a Christian all my life brother Brandon why would it happen I've asked him but maybe he just made like his going to go by that's what he done to Copus and he said made out like he know all time he was going in he know it all time he's going with him so he said they act like he's going on by and they constrained him come in we love you that's the way come in and abide with us can you do that today can the Methodist do that the Baptist the Presbyterian the nazarin the pilgrim Holiness the Catholics the Lutheran can you do that regardless of what church says come in and abide with me this Resurrection morning come and abide with us he's never ask unless you receive he said ask and you shall receive not it'll be open seek and you shall find for everyone that seeketh findeth the him that knocketh it shall be open right ask then you shall receive no maybe you will you will receive and they asked him come in with us he turned come back walked into the little Hut it might have been a little Adobe on the side of the road as many of the Syrian countries there have those little doobies made up with mud and so forth thick poor why would the the king of glory ever stoop to come into a place like that but there's never a place to too little there's never a church too small there's never a person too rejected by the world there's never a woman too Fallen there's never a man too drunk but he'll come when he's at certainly asked him and find out may I say this leaving it for last there's never a person who's too sick never a person who's too far gone but ask and you shall receive let me come in make my board with you I'd like to talk to you a few minutes and they invited him he came in and when Once inside and the doors of the world shut out along with Jesus there you are if he can only get you to yourself once if he can only get you away from the crowd the pleasure seeking Crown if he can only get you away from the doubters it says the days of Miracles has pass he can ever get you away from the people that says there's no more feeling of religion the heartfelt religion of our fathers bled on the battlefield far there's nothing to it if he can ever get you alone one time and you're all your idea shut out TI H he could ever get a group of people together like that that would be a repeat of Pentecost he can ever get a church like that there'd be a Revival ever sweet the nation get alone with him while he was alone the doors shut the world outside he picked up some bread and he broke it and that's the way he done it they knew it had to be him their eyes were open they had talked to him all day they had Fellowship they heard him preach along the road through the Journey of the heat of the day but when Once alone he made himself known to him man their eyes come open oh if he could only get this group of people at this hour he can only get you to a place alone where you wouldn't noce say I'm sitting by a Methodist this morning and I'm a Baptist well you mustn't do that you must shut the world out shut the other people out you must walk alone with Christ if you ever get you alone then your eyes going to stay white with him all the time then he'll do something here this morning the way he used to do it and way he does it today for he has to do the same thing today that he did then act on the same principles or he isn't the same yesterday today and forever and he did wrong when he acted there if Christ in the here it is get it Christ at the first resurrection and made himself KN to these Apostles by something that he did when he was here on Earth to prove to them that he was risen from the dead and it was he he's under the same obligations to move this morning in this Tabernacle the do things here in this church this morning that he did when he was here on Earth in the same manner he's obligated the same way to act when the same Christ has AR now for another few moments on if you'll stand it I want to stay come to my other scripture quickly he is risen from the dead the highest of Heaven became the lest through Earth he passed through a City Jericho the lowest city in the world and the Littest man in the city had to look down the scene I tried how low did he come did you ever think of it he become me that I through Grace might become him he become sin knowing no sin that I by sin might be righteous in the sight of God that's what he did for you that's what he did for you sinner friend this morning how could you turn him down now notice now that was his his Earthly work was finished at the resurrection he proved everything he said now he's got another work to do that the world knows little about that's right his next work and his Ascension we want to speak on that for a moment after he's risen from the dead after he's already here on Earth and proving himself Alive by impower of proofs that he's doing the same things that he did when he was here in flesh and here he is walking breaking bread and eating with them oh the same Jesus he's proved us now the ascension come now the time comes did you ever know the Bible said that he ascended up on high far above every ever through every Heaven this Earth belonged to the devil through the fall this Earth was given to the devil every Kingdom of this world is governed by the devil we hate to think that but the Bible says it is that that's the reason we have wars and shooting and fighting and trouble is because the kingdoms of this world is the kingdoms of the devil the Bible said so and in the great Millennium which is to come the Bible said Rejoice all you heavens and you holy prophets of the Earth for the kingdoms of this Earth have become the kingdoms of our Lord and and he he shall Rule and Reign forever now they will become we'll have a moreal war then when he comes no more sickness no more trouble now notice when he had died there so little spoke of this Ascension it's one of the greatest days when he ascended up follows all over the Earth since the day in the Garden of Eden that sin was committed all Heavens was shut off from mankind Satan is the prince of the power of the air right why art thou falling from heaven old Lucifer no man could see in the glory no man could understand because the power is just above it Heaven means atmosphere above and then all these powers are shut off from mankind because of sin but when he had died and had rose again and come up he the Bible said no one has ascended up but he that came down from first when he was in heaven he was a lust that went out of God in the beginning and he came down on Earth and was not to be made an angel he came down on Earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel not come down in the great Jehovah Glory but he came down as a man to redeem man to die for man to die for as a man he never died as God he died as a man the sin of man was up on the son of man and he had to become a man in order to pay the penalty what did he do the Bible said he was made a little lower than the angels in order for death that he might take away and abolish sin and take away sickness from the world now when he came down from the highest lust from God he came down through angels and came down and was made a man and he said I am not even a man I am a worm and no man for he was despised and rejected there was no Beauty we should desire him he was mared above every man he was probably a little skinny skinly looking fell didn't look like a king many times that people judge people by the way they dress or by their statues man is not judged by how big he is how strong his muscles man's judged by character and character alone I've seen men that weigh 200 lb and have answer man about him man is judged by character what he is in his heart and Christ was not judged by physical strength but he was judge by character never a man ever Liv like him or never a man could ever die like him amen never a man could have send up on high like him because he was God I am no man he made of himself no reputation did you ever think the man that made an artificial eye made a reputation the man that made false teeth made a reputation the man that made a wooden arm made a reputation for himself but the man who made the original eye the man who made the original arm made of himself no reputation but become a servant of bond man un the man who were Sinners that he might win them back How could a man in his right mind know the gospel truth of that and reject the man reject that offer God has given to save the man from a life of sin how can he do it I just can't understand it how that you could reject such a one when he's not here to make anything that you have to do for him but just offering you a way of escape from the things that you're going to and became that far you when he did when he was dying under Calvary everything everything had rejected him they spit on him his face was full of mocky spit they had a rag around his eyes and hit him on the head and said if you're Prophet tell us who hits it a little woman run into the midst of him and said what has he done but heal your sick and raise your dead and done good they smacked her in her mouth and said would you listen to that woman instead of your priest away was such a person and his own Dear Mother walking in his bloody Footprints God let me walk the same way as he under the calvary down in her heart was a wondering when she seen her darling child Die Young a man 33 years old and look like 50 the Bible said of his strain is where probably turning gray and the grim look on his face word he was suffering not so much physically but as it was Agony the Bible said that his blood and water separated from each other and any doctor or anything can tell you that knows the chemistry of blood that only sorrow will do that he never died from a Roman spear neither did he die from a nail drobe in his hand or his feet but he died of a broken heart being rejected he came to his own his own received him not said brother brand I wish I could have stood there that de Calvary rather you're standing in a better place today you're standing in the presence of a resurrected Lord Jesus who has proved himself Triumph look at him as he stands there and after he rose from the dead then we notice here that as he went on then after he talked with his disciples the Bible said he ascended up on high what did he do he took the he was here come down the low God from heaven when he went back he took within the high priest being a high priest Anointed with the torch light of his own blood when he went down all these pow sh that accused what L God and man Fellowship it had been broke in the Garden of Eden sin the things Satan had the domain of this Earth was Satan it belonged to the Devils but when he come the anointed high priest as the high priest Aaron went in to the holies of holies behind the veil Anointed with the precious anointing or walking a certain way playing holy holy to the Lord as he walked into the type of Christ with the blood of the lamb before him and if you want any other way he would die Christ with his own blood as the high priest Anointed with the power of God raised from the dead and poured down the Dominion of Satan as he broke the domains he went to Heavens Beyond heavens and he was come to the lowest on Earth and was seized up in heaven and God set him on a pinnacle until he has to look down to see Heaven amen oh wonder he's the mighty conqueror as he stand under today in the domain forever and ever I Isaiah said unto us a son is born unto us a child is given and his name Shall be Called CER Prince of Peace Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his domain there shall be no end forever and ever he'll r on the throne of David seated in the heavens and Heavens far above every Angel Archangel every principality and power he tore down his borrow at his crucifixion and Resurrection everything Satan had he broke through the veil of sin he tore apart with the high priest blood of his own body he come to the next what was it it was a fail of sickness and Hell over people he tore it apart for he was wounded for our transgression with his T we were healed he went through the great Veil under of sickness the great veil of sin he went through the the great veil of worry he went through the great veil of fear he tore every one of them down and ascended so high and received a name above every name that they in the heavens above in Earth Below or in the world to come God taken that lovely one who stoop down so low that even he didn't have a place to be born or a place to die God exalted him on high and give him a Crown of Glory name above every name sent the dead a mighty conqueror sent every B the veil of sin was written to the veil of sickness was written to and every that kept man away from God was written to I the way the truth and the life he broke every Power he scattered every devil he made a search like from glor and all the old Prophet when he laid down on the on the bed of stone that I this pillar of stone he saw the Angels ascending and descending notice in the first place it was descending and ascending but this time it was God and man ascending and descending on the ladder of Jacob as we would call it when he broke every Power SP every domain and set at the right hand of the magest on high far above everything the channel of the Holy Ghost in This dark world is laying open for whosoever will they come and be baptized into this great channel of his BL and receive the Redemptive blessings that he died for man and women how could you turn such a one down when he's sitting there cloth in his majesty how he sets his glory this morning what did you do he came here to the world homeless to make a way for homeless men and women for men and women who has no hope for men and women who has no place to go for homeless wonders who are pleasure crazy walking you down the streets today and horse races gamblings and so forth trying to find a comfort he made a place for them every man and just as free as the water runs whosoever will let him come amen you can't walk outside of this Veil you've got to come in here to find out you've got to get your where there's nothing between you and God where the angels of God can descend and Ascend back and forth bringing the messages of God back and forth to the individual there's nothing between my soul and the Savior the there sets the mighty conqueror he ever veil in he rent The Veil that you could be saved you rent The Veil if youve committed adultery if you have cursed if you've done anything wrong he rent that bail for

to do I will cast all my cares upon you there's something you don't know just what to do tonight church maybe something in your life I know there's a need in my life I'd like to bring before the Saints tonight that you'd remember me certainly missing brother Israel sister Sharon tonight remember them in South Dakota and their trip home on Saturday that just be able to ra relax and enjoy themselves and be a blessing where they're at I'm sure that they will and our sister Annabelle asks that we remember her for a ankle problem that she's having she's had that before our precious sister Annabelle cedo and and Mesa there so remember her need spoke briefly to Sister Deborah mcti tonight she's doing well she needs they're trying to schedule a surgery for her back here in coming couple of weeks so we'll just hold her up before the Lord I told her we would do that for Trevor and Abigail boy they're not feeling well tonight want to remember the yuros for a trip this weekend we'll miss them those traveling [Music] my Sarah's not here tonight she's got a big test tomorrow so just pray for her she didn't say that or ask for that but I'm sure she would appreciate if she could do well

yeah definitely tell Janet we're praying for her in her trip so remember Sister Alise her friend sister Chris yes man we sure want to do that I know my son's over there and didn't think too much about a hurricane in North Carolina he's just pretty near where that had hit a lot of Believers affected there in Tennessee brother George uh sister Chris um and I've lost everything very uh tragic I don't know that Believers have lost lives but sure affected a lot of people and we just turn to the Lord and asked for his help and kindness and deliverance for those and all these things occurring in the news and these tragedies just point us to talk to him talk to the master let's do that together for one another especially these the Believers in the South that were affected by the uh hurricane would there be another one we should mention all right uh let's turn these over to the Lord for here the next 15 minutes I know brother Chris and company wants to clean the church I'm going to apologize in advance Wednesdays don't work for me so you forgive me and if everybody stayed it probably wouldn't work out either but if we can get you know a good crew to help him we want to do that it's delicate it's delicate for me because we don't if someone wants to have an experience with the Lord we don't want to be coming in here too fast too quick mumbo jumbo rattling things around going Outdoors loudly we want to embrace the Holy Spirit and if we have to pray with you all night long we want to support that Embrace that and so let's let's approach that the right way if if at all possible I know you know what I mean I don't know exactly how to do all that right I think we do but just be aware um but as we leave to do that work with brother Chris and I missed this door I think maybe the choir or somebody opens it and and prop it let's not prop that door anymore please cuz I've missed it a couple of times thank the Lord nothing has happened so when whoever closes down let's make sure that that's the big thing there's fans and things they get left on try to get all that done but the main thing is get these doors closed where they can't be propped open in this um area of town and then the air conditioning just turn it back to what it was or what you have at your home when you're not there and that will be fine there's a remote control back there you got to hear it beep beep
