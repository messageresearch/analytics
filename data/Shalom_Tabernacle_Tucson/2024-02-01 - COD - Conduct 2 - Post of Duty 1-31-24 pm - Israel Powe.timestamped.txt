[18:51] Lord so good to see brother Dan sister
[18:54] Vicky there tonight and each of you amen
[18:58] amen God bless you richly we' like to go
[19:00] right into the word in um Hebrews
[19:03] chapter 2 is where we'll take our
[19:06] scripture we started last Wednesday on
[19:08] conduct order and Doctrine we'll call it
[19:12] the C but um we're still under the
[19:16] conduct
[19:17] portion and we're going to deal with the
[19:20] uh the post of Duty we'll call that
[19:24] we'll put that under conduct also the
[19:27] way we dress
[19:29] our attitude that's probably under
[19:31] conduct but we won't get into that
[19:33] tonight but just to go um uh little by
[19:37] little step by step for the next few
[19:40] Wednesday Services until we get through
[19:42] the portion that we' like to get to but
[19:45] in Hebrews chapter
[19:47] 2 the word of
[19:50] God says this
[19:57] here
[19:59] verses number one
[20:02] 2 and three
[20:05] therefore we ought to give the more
[20:07] Earnest heed to the things which we have
[20:11] heard lest at any time we should let
[20:14] them slip for if the word spoken by
[20:17] Angels was
[20:18] steadfast and every transgression and
[20:22] Disobedience received the just
[20:24] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[20:28] if we neglect so great salvation which
[20:31] at the first began to be spoken by the
[20:33] Lord and was confirmed unto us by them
[20:37] that heard him amen so we'll pray God's
[20:41] blessing on the reading of his word you
[20:43] may be seated uh
[20:45] tonight um as we started last week
[20:51] Wednesday and
[20:54] uh as under the beginnings there in Luke
[20:57] chapter
[20:59] 14 our lord Jesus is there uh
[21:03] admonishing his disciples as they began
[21:06] to follow him in discipleship and he
[21:08] says he that is not able or willing to
[21:11] hate his father his mother his wife his
[21:16] children his Brethren and his sisters
[21:20] and even his own life for my sake so the
[21:24] preparation that our Lord is giving his
[21:27] disciples that
[21:29] um not that of course not that we should
[21:31] hate our mother fathers and our families
[21:34] and hate our own life but he's bringing
[21:36] the comparison as to what a life of
[21:39] service to the Lord is and how we come
[21:42] to him and I strongly believe and I
[21:45] failed to do this many times but it's a
[21:48] really good question to ask those
[21:50] Believers that want to come to
[21:52] Christ are you willing to give your life
[21:55] for
[21:57] this because the True
[21:59] Believers um throughout all of the ages
[22:02] had to and that brings the serious the
[22:06] the severity of what you're doing when
[22:08] you take a stand for the Lord Jesus and
[22:12] when you want to come to serve him it's
[22:14] there not that Hollywood version that
[22:16] you might see it's not the great
[22:18] television evangelist version that you
[22:21] might see but this is really a serious
[22:23] commitment that one makes and Jesus said
[22:27] you count up the cost what man B
[22:30] purchases a field without first trying
[22:33] that field who's going to purchase an
[22:35] animal without first trying the animal
[22:39] and so the cost needs to be tallied up
[22:43] and that's not to scare anyone but that
[22:44] just brings the seriousness as we are
[22:48] are making our decision to follow him so
[22:50] that's the beginning of our Christian
[22:52] journey in the Great Commission Mark
[22:55] chapter 16 our lord Jesus tells tells us
[22:58] what the Great Commission is how every
[23:01] believer is commissioned to go and tell
[23:05] go and teach All Nations and go and be a
[23:09] witness of me go and preach the gospel
[23:14] to Every Creature now this commission is
[23:17] not just to preachers who preach this is
[23:20] not just to old people this is not just
[23:23] for young people these are for
[23:25] Christians this great Comm Mission and
[23:28] it'll always be until Jesus comes we see
[23:31] the door closing for the Gentiles and
[23:35] the purpose of this set of study or this
[23:38] set of messages is that I believe that
[23:42] the Lord wants to raise up pillars in
[23:46] the house of the Lord that the local
[23:50] Fellowship where you worship God you
[23:52] know every church has them we have those
[23:55] Believers that you can count on them
[23:57] they're going to be there on Wednesday
[24:00] and Sunday services and then we have
[24:02] those Believers that maybe they come and
[24:05] go and so um and every church has them
[24:09] we have our what we call our Wednesday
[24:11] night crowd our prayer meeting crowd our
[24:14] Sunday morning crowd and every group
[24:17] over the years I've seen them and so you
[24:20] have this uh this Dynamic of coming to
[24:24] the house of the Lord well well the
[24:26] scripture tells us in Hebrews uh chapter
[24:29] 10 I believe we read it for you last
[24:31] time to not forsake the assembling of
[24:36] yourselves together but even more as you
[24:39] see that day
[24:41] approaching what does that word forsake
[24:43] mean that means to abandon or to give up
[24:47] and you can literally get into the habit
[24:51] of missing the Gathering time that the
[24:54] Believers have have called to gather
[24:56] together and one of the things I'd like
[24:58] to ask our ourselves as a local
[25:02] Fellowship because that's what we
[25:04] represent we represent the Lord Jesus
[25:07] Christ in this community and if this
[25:10] church was to leave from this community
[25:12] would it even miss us would there be a
[25:15] vacancy here would the would the
[25:18] neighbors here even know that there was
[25:21] a group of Believers here a place that
[25:23] they could come and find rest for their
[25:25] souls to be prayed for if they needed it
[25:29] spiritual needs we all know where
[25:31] McDonald's is we all know where the fast
[25:33] food and we know where to get gas where
[25:35] can we get God at in this neighborhood
[25:38] and you'll be surprised at the people
[25:41] that claim their little Neighborhood
[25:44] Church as their local Fellowship I was
[25:47] sharing this with with some of the
[25:49] Believers there in Phoenix and I think I
[25:51] shared it here too during the time of
[25:53] covid when you know we we had the
[25:56] challenges that all the churches had and
[25:59] I believe it was on one Sunday morning
[26:01] that we had um canceled our service here
[26:05] and I went to go preach for brother
[26:07] Osorio that Sunday morning I believe
[26:09] that was the only service I can't
[26:11] remember the exact date but it any rate
[26:14] that Sunday morning there there at
[26:16] brother uh Isaac osorio's church I Was
[26:19] preparing to to preach the sermon and
[26:22] getting my notes together and someone
[26:23] just kept calling my phone and calling
[26:26] my phone blowing my phone up really
[26:28] and I was like who is this calling me on
[26:29] the Sunday morning so I finally answered
[26:32] the
[26:32] phone and it was one of Doug's friends
[26:36] the homeless guy Doug we say he's
[26:37] homeless but he's not homeless we just
[26:39] that's how we identify him he's got a
[26:41] home but he looks homeless and he's okay
[26:43] with it so we all know who I'm talking
[26:45] about
[26:47] Doug Doug what's his name Doug Wilson
[26:51] okay and so we call him homeless but
[26:53] he's not homeless well it was one of his
[26:55] friends calling me
[26:58] outside our church door
[27:00] there she said where's everybody
[27:04] at I said you know what we cancel
[27:07] service she said
[27:09] why now for her this was her church for
[27:14] that Sunday morning and she was counting
[27:17] on depending on us to be here and that
[27:20] really gave me another whole another
[27:22] perspective and I said you know I'm
[27:24] sorry will we cancel the service we're
[27:26] at another location says are you coming
[27:28] back yeah we'll be back don't worry and
[27:30] it almost brought tears to my eyes and
[27:32] the impact of what the little
[27:34] Neighborhood Church is and I was sharing
[27:36] this with some of the brothers and
[27:38] brother dingwall he uh I think I said
[27:42] that right brother
[27:43] dingwall I shared that and he said that
[27:46] when they had decided I forget which
[27:49] group he was with when they decided to
[27:52] move from the neighborhood that their
[27:54] church had grew up into to go go
[27:57] purchase a piece of property and leave
[28:00] when they put the announcement out that
[28:01] they were leaving he said the
[28:03] neighborhood people came crying and
[28:07] weeping begging them not to go people
[28:11] that you won't never you you won't
[28:12] normally see maybe and so you know
[28:14] there's people that claim this to be
[28:16] their church and they claim that this is
[28:18] their home church and maybe we don't
[28:20] even know them or see them but that's on
[28:24] us we said we're going to be here and
[28:27] when we come to gather in his name you
[28:30] know that's just not for the preachers
[28:33] that's not just the board members that's
[28:36] like for every believer we agree to
[28:40] gather in his name on Sunday morning
[28:44] Sunday night and Wednesday night
[28:48] deal
[28:50] deal and so as Believers of the church
[28:53] there's no part-time Believers right
[28:58] am I getting that wrong or is that right
[29:01] and so some of us and I know some
[29:03] Believers have the attitude that you
[29:05] know if I'm a little tired I'll be there
[29:08] if not what if the janitor had that
[29:09] attitude what if the pastor had that
[29:12] attitude what if we what if I came here
[29:14] when I just felt so great and felt so
[29:18] good about being here I mean it's the
[29:22] weather my bones are aching man I can
[29:24] catch up on some sleep it's Wednesday
[29:28] night I know some of y'all going to be
[29:30] here so I'm going to be here and I
[29:33] believe the the M the Believers that's
[29:36] their attitude why the Bible tells us
[29:39] not to forsake
[29:41] ourselves and the scripture tells us
[29:43] that Jesus Promised where two or three
[29:46] are gathered in my name he says I will
[29:49] be in the midst who who wants to miss
[29:52] that who wants to miss that opportunity
[29:55] so we're going to go through this just a
[29:57] little bit and this Hebrews chapter 2
[30:03] veres 1 and 3 and the things that we're
[30:06] talking about tonight they're not deep
[30:08] they're not things that you know
[30:10] talented people have to know or people
[30:12] who are gifted who can sing or who can
[30:16] preach or who have talents beyond
[30:19] measure we're just talking about uh
[30:22] faithful
[30:23] people
[30:25] faithfulness and this is where where
[30:28] this Hebrews 2 1-3 speaks of that that
[30:32] we need to give heed L one of these
[30:36] things slip from us and so we're just
[30:38] going to bring a few of those things
[30:40] here for you tonight now first of all
[30:44] this word omit brother manam deals with
[30:48] it and he calls it the sin of
[30:51] omission and it means to leave out or to
[30:55] exclude it's either either intentionally
[30:58] or
[31:00] forgetfully um it means to leave off it
[31:03] means to fail to do to fail to continue
[31:07] and brother Ram deals with this failure
[31:10] this Omission this sin of om omission
[31:15] and brother he he deals with this in
[31:17] blind bmus 1960 paragraph number 24 he
[31:21] says you
[31:23] know as a servant of God you ought to
[31:26] watch what you're doing
[31:28] because your written Epistles read of
[31:30] all men you Christians always be willing
[31:34] to lend a hand or to do something to
[31:37] help somebody make life a little more
[31:40] pleasant for them as they're well I
[31:44] don't have any gift of healing you don't
[31:46] have to have at least offer something
[31:51] offer a prayer do something make them
[31:54] feel do the best you can by them anyhow
[31:59] never turn a shoulder a cold shoulder to
[32:03] anyone no matter what it is even if
[32:06] they've mistreated you do it anyhow if
[32:10] you can't do it from your heart then you
[32:13] ought to come to the Altar and stay till
[32:16] that Spirit comes in you that from your
[32:18] heart you can love those who doesn't
[32:20] love you that's when God will answer
[32:23] your prayer for as long as there
[32:26] anything in your heart if I conceive
[32:28] iniquity in my heart then God will not
[32:30] hear me that's what David said that's
[32:33] true he won't hear
[32:37] you the prophet of God continues on and
[32:39] door to the heart he said that's a
[32:42] beautiful thought did you know I don't
[32:45] think I gave you the assist but I'll
[32:47] read it anyways did you know all great
[32:49] things has to pass through the critics
[32:53] God's blessed church has to go through
[32:56] the critics
[32:57] critics and stand the criticism before
[33:00] can be took to the hall of God's
[33:03] Immortal Fame the scripture says all
[33:05] that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall
[33:08] suffer persecution so if you're not
[33:10] persecuted for righteousness sake not
[33:14] something you brought on yourself but
[33:15] for righteousness sake there's something
[33:19] wrong
[33:21] somewhere brother bam continues on the
[33:24] message the blushing Prophet paragraph
[33:26] 19
[33:28] 98 many of you here who has professed
[33:31] Christianity for a long time and know
[33:34] that you have failed to tow the line
[33:37] with God know that you're doing things
[33:40] right now that you ought not to do and
[33:43] you're going unconfessed them just
[33:47] Loosely floating along with the tide
[33:50] looking at the kind of programs you
[33:52] should not look at look at the kind of
[33:54] magazines and reading the literature
[33:56] that that you should not read it's not
[33:59] BEC coming to Christians listening to
[34:02] jokes of V vow and dirt and smut that
[34:06] you know you shouldn't do both men and
[34:09] women you know of places where you could
[34:13] have spoke and did not do it and your
[34:16] guilty maybe the sin of
[34:20] omission and the message super sign n uh
[34:25] 1959 perig at
[34:27] 50 Prophet says this do you understand
[34:31] that it's the little things that you
[34:33] pass over and old me that means so much
[34:37] to God can the church conceive that this
[34:40] morning and our achievement as an
[34:42] organization and his great buildings and
[34:46] and
[34:47] we're omitting the little things that
[34:51] means so much to God and so much to our
[34:54] Eternal destination we omit those things
[35:00] I think sometimes we I think sometimes
[35:02] we look at the great big things and the
[35:05] big Monumental things that get the
[35:08] credit and the the stage and the lights
[35:11] and all of the Fanfare but the
[35:15] faithfulness of being uh committed to a
[35:19] post of Duty I believe that's important
[35:22] to God I believe it's in the word of God
[35:24] for a reason I believe he told us that
[35:27] we should Gather in his name and he
[35:30] would be in our midst and then that we
[35:33] should not forsake that we should really
[35:37] take that very very very deeply we know
[35:40] the scripture or Jesus says and many of
[35:43] us we we use the scripture as it
[35:45] pertains to work that my Ox was in the
[35:47] ditch well this entire age has placed
[35:52] the ox in the ditch if you let it it's
[35:54] just a busy age I mean there everything
[35:58] is 24 hours more things are open on
[36:01] Sundays than ever before and it used to
[36:04] be Sunday was God's day and even many of
[36:07] our chores and things that we do have
[36:09] spilled over on Sunday in between
[36:12] services and we've gotten caught up into
[36:14] that rat race but that really Belongs to
[36:16] the Lord but then the prophet added and
[36:20] the Christian church at least in this
[36:22] country added the Wednesday night prayer
[36:25] meeting or the weekday service service
[36:28] and I want someone to show me where
[36:30] brother brandham minimized that service
[36:33] he never did now we know Sunday Belongs
[36:36] to the Lord and it's it's the equivalent
[36:39] of the the the Hebrews Sabbath day and
[36:44] that Sabbath day from sun down to Sun up
[36:48] Sundown Friday night to to Sun up the
[36:51] next uh I'm not getting my time here
[36:53] straight but it it's not starting
[36:56] Saturday morning when you see the
[36:58] sunrise and when you prepare to go to
[37:02] church on Sunday morning that actually
[37:04] starts on Saturday it really should
[37:08] because you're preparing for what's
[37:09] going to come tomorrow so you get
[37:12] everything all the work and all the
[37:14] pressure and all the toys you try to lay
[37:16] all of that out on Saturday so Sunday is
[37:21] the day of worship it's a holy day the
[37:25] age has made it not holy but God rose on
[37:30] that day and brother Brandon made it
[37:31] very clear that he believed that it was
[37:34] a sin now I want you to think about that
[37:37] it was a sin to hunt to fish or to work
[37:41] on Sunday if you could have gone to
[37:47] church that's a quote if I I might get
[37:49] to it tonight I'm not sure but but it
[37:52] still it shows the importance of it now
[37:54] who who in the Age is telling you that
[37:57] that not not Walmart surely not and not
[38:01] the shopping industry surely not and not
[38:04] the rat race that we live in surely not
[38:08] but Sunday Belongs to the Lord It's a
[38:13] holy day for us
[38:15] Believers and it's not a flip it's not a
[38:18] halfway it is deliberately a day for the
[38:22] Lord I'm coming to meet with the Lord
[38:26] and the Brethren and I have a little
[38:30] local Fellowship that I'm accountable to
[38:34] I'm accountable to the young people in
[38:36] that church even though they're not my
[38:38] children I'm accountable to the elders
[38:40] in that church even though they're not
[38:42] related to Me In by Blood I'm
[38:45] accountable to the youth I'm accountable
[38:47] to every brother every sister that would
[38:50] need prayer or need my time or need my
[38:55] touch or just need needs to see my face
[38:58] I'm
[38:59] accountable there people depending on
[39:02] you amen and this age has tried to take
[39:06] that away from
[39:08] us but thank God for his word and for
[39:13] the reminders in his word
[39:18] amen in the paragraph number 30 in the
[39:21] message hear ye him sometimes it's the
[39:23] little things that we omit that spoils
[39:27] our our great faith we'll see a little
[39:31] something come up the weather's too hot
[39:34] they got too tired this or some little
[39:37] thing like that that you'll omit coming
[39:40] to the meeting again or maybe somebody
[39:42] got out of order or something went wrong
[39:45] or something and then that right there
[39:49] is where you fell see but you see faith
[39:53] is so positive it never you can't hinder
[39:57] Faith no matter what it is you're going
[40:00] to do it anyhow no matter what anybody
[40:03] else does if you believe it you're going
[40:05] to stay with it because faith has no
[40:09] hindrance you might have a lot but your
[40:12] faith doesn't so it'll stay just stay
[40:15] right with it
[40:23] amen praise the
[40:25] Lorden so let's go a little bit further
[40:28] the message 1948 experiences brother
[40:33] brandham says this in paragraph number
[40:36] four I like this one you know and that
[40:40] one we just read there you see something
[40:42] out of order just a little bit and then
[40:45] sometimes you'll you'll admit because
[40:47] the weather's too hot or you get too
[40:49] tired and you'll omit from coming now
[40:53] we're not talking about you that have a
[40:56] reason that you can't come we're talking
[40:58] about you're forsaking it when you can
[41:01] come but you don't come and and as I
[41:04] said on last week Wednesday when we put
[41:08] the stream service together there is
[41:10] it's not to substitute Hebrews chapter
[41:13] 10 that's not a substitute is it's not
[41:16] to make the the church service more
[41:18] convenient because all the Believers are
[41:21] going to be there I could be there but I
[41:24] you know I kind of just feel like I'm
[41:25] gonna stay home let me pop on the stream
[41:27] I'll get the service anyway that's not
[41:29] what the service is for service for for
[41:32] for those that can't come we have some
[41:35] Elders some people that's in their 90s
[41:37] they can't come some people that are
[41:39] sick or weak in their body they can't
[41:41] come some people that have their Ox in
[41:43] the ditch they're working whatever the
[41:46] case may be they can't come but then you
[41:48] have the group that can come but they
[41:51] choose not to come that stream service
[41:55] is not for it's not for that I believe
[41:58] that there's a commitment and there's an
[42:00] effort made to come when those doors are
[42:05] open is the way the prophet of God told
[42:08] us all right and
[42:12] now and like I said last time this
[42:14] message maybe for the people that need
[42:17] to hear it or not here
[42:19] anyways but tell them to go get the
[42:22] message all right tell them they need to
[42:24] hear it all right encourage them in a
[42:27] nice Gentle
[42:28] Way right okay don't say well you need
[42:32] to hear this just say you know where
[42:33] were you we miss you might want to hear
[42:35] so all right is that okay all right
[42:41] experiences 1948 and you people who have
[42:45] little churches here who's
[42:48] struggling my advice would be for you to
[42:51] stand at your post of Duty just as loyal
[42:55] as you can to the cause of Christ and
[42:59] back up your minister and everything
[43:02] that's that's that's going on for the
[43:06] cause of Christ and do that and God will
[43:10] bless you the only way that you can
[43:12] respect God is to respect one another is
[43:16] that right so you know I like that
[43:19] because you know when you have little
[43:21] things in the church is struggling well
[43:24] that's kind of like you know that's
[43:26] sometimes people feel like well I'll
[43:28] I'll come when you guys get things put
[43:30] together properly when the church stops
[43:34] struggling then I'll come I'll show up
[43:36] well actually we need you here when the
[43:39] church is struggling and is trying to
[43:41] find its way you don't leave when things
[43:44] are are struggling that's when the
[43:46] church needs you you know you you're not
[43:49] just coming to the church to receive
[43:51] from God you're actually coming to give
[43:54] Christianity is living for others we
[43:57] have we we need your voice in The
[44:01] Ensemble we need to hear your voice in
[44:04] the chorus portion of the song service
[44:07] it's not the song leader up here leading
[44:10] a song special solo but we want to hear
[44:13] your voice even Out Of Tune even if you
[44:16] can't sing that word we want to hear you
[44:19] we want to hear your broken vocal cords
[44:23] we want your tired praise
[44:27] we want that worship after work the
[44:29] midweek praise worship after work hard
[44:34] day demons Devils attacking against you
[44:38] bring that on to the house of the Lord
[44:39] that's that's a
[44:42] flavor my that's homecooked flavorings
[44:46] that you just can't get anywhere else
[44:50] tired back ache could have stayed home
[44:53] but decided to press my way out out
[44:56] anyhow and if somebody a sinner comes in
[44:59] here to be prayed for we need your hand
[45:03] on that Sinner's life to pray them
[45:06] through this neighborhood needs that it
[45:09] needs
[45:10] you not just the pastor not just the
[45:13] ministers not just the ones we know are
[45:15] going to be here we're talking about you
[45:17] that are on the fence God is calling for
[45:22] God soldiers and
[45:24] pillars amen and that starts right
[45:28] here amen it looks simple it looks
[45:32] uneventful you're just pressing your way
[45:34] coming to the house of Lord you don't
[45:36] know what can we we've had some strange
[45:38] characters come in here for prayer
[45:39] haven't we we have some people come in
[45:41] here we never seen them before they come
[45:44] up and they need prayer who's supposed
[45:46] to pray for
[45:48] them what the church down the street or
[45:51] the other church over there no this one
[45:53] right here amen amen
[45:59] so when things are struggling my advice
[46:02] would be for you to stand at your post
[46:04] of Duty God's provided way of healing
[46:07] brother brandom says this here father we
[46:10] pray that every Christian will take his
[46:12] post of Duty get on the telephone call
[46:17] others do everything you can go out in
[46:21] the country dragging them from the
[46:24] hedges and high ways and byways the lame
[46:28] halt blind which was the last call that
[46:31] Jesus said would be before the coming
[46:34] the great
[46:36] supper when was the last time some of
[46:39] y'all dragged someone to
[46:42] church like the songwriters say my
[46:45] mother drugg me drugg me to Sunday
[46:48] school drug me to church and he says I'm
[46:51] so glad mama and daddy drugged me he's
[46:54] talking about being Dr drugged but the
[46:56] drugs his parents had him on they drugg
[46:59] him to church and brother Ram is talking
[47:02] about going in the hedges in the
[47:04] highways and getting on the phone and
[47:07] dragging them to
[47:12] church Lord help me put my gloves on and
[47:15] grab somebody by the collar and drag
[47:17] them to church you strong enough you can
[47:20] do it
[47:23] right don't look at me like that Saints
[47:27] make this Valley full of ditches here
[47:29] what the prophet of God says here
[47:31] paragraph number 51 brother brandom I
[47:34] don't do nothing maybe that's what's the
[47:38] matter that's the trouble of it it's
[47:41] more sin not to do than it is to do when
[47:45] you know
[47:47] better that's right he know he that
[47:51] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[47:53] him it's sin you got to make ready doing
[47:56] nothing is the worst thing you can do do
[47:59] nothing about it you Southerners
[48:02] remember your history went up here when
[48:04] Grant was setting just across the river
[48:07] he had a boy out there on guard Duty and
[48:11] the rebels was across the river and this
[48:13] boy walking along there kind of Dazed
[48:17] around with the dreams of his sweetheart
[48:19] he left his post of Duty and went down
[48:22] to pick some violets to send to his
[48:24] sweetheart he didn't mean to do wrong he
[48:27] went then at the time there was a spy
[48:30] ready from the southern Army and they
[48:33] slipped in and they looked around and
[48:36] they found out that the southern Army
[48:38] was two or three times the size of
[48:40] General Grant well what happened the boy
[48:44] come back on the post of Duty not
[48:46] knowing what had happened but the Spy
[48:48] had already been there and what happened
[48:51] they stormed across the river and drove
[48:54] them Plum back up into the the state and
[48:56] that boy was shot in an hour later not
[49:00] because they didn't have no objection to
[49:03] him picking the violets they didn't have
[49:06] it wasn't what he done it was the things
[49:09] he didn't do he didn't stand to his post
[49:12] of Duty he didn't guard the post like it
[49:15] was like he was supposed to and he
[49:17] spoiled the whole thing and that
[49:20] responsibility tonight lays at the Life
[49:23] Tabernacle and other Tabernacle and
[49:27] churches in streetport Louisiana God is
[49:30] here taking with the storm it ain't what
[49:33] you're doing than it is what you're
[49:36] failing to
[49:39] do let's do something about it let's dig
[49:43] with all of our hearts that when the day
[49:46] of judgments comes we can say God I did
[49:49] the very best I could and you know I did
[49:52] amen when we know what we can do that's
[49:57] all
[49:58] expected when we know what we can do
[50:02] that's
[50:03] all that's that's alls expected
[50:07] amen this is in the message Church order
[50:10] we listen to this couple of weeks ago
[50:13] paragraph 65 and may the Holy Spirit
[50:15] watch over each one of you and may every
[50:18] officer of the church fill his post of
[50:20] Duty knowing this that God is going to
[50:23] hold you responsible for how you held
[50:27] your office in the church each one will
[50:31] have to give an
[50:33] account and the message adoption number
[50:36] one 1960 brother randam says this may we
[50:40] tonight see this Lord plainly as it is
[50:45] given to us in the word give us
[50:48] understanding and place us Lord at our
[50:51] post of Duty that we might serve
[50:54] Faithfully until you come we ask this in
[50:57] jesus' name for his sake
[51:05] amen
[51:09] yes so it's the little things that we
[51:12] leave undone let's turn to Matthew
[51:14] chapter 25 just for a moment there's a a
[51:18] pertinent uh Parable
[51:24] there
[51:30] Matthew
[51:33] 25:14 for the Kingdom of
[51:36] Heaven is as a man traveling into a far
[51:39] country who called his own servants and
[51:42] delivered unto them his
[51:44] goods and unto one he gave five talents
[51:48] to another two and to another one to
[51:51] every man according to his several
[51:53] ability and straightway took his journey
[51:56] then he that had received the five
[51:59] talents went and traded with the same
[52:01] and made them other five talents and
[52:03] likewise he that had received two he
[52:05] also gained other two but he that
[52:08] received one went and digged into the
[52:10] Earth and hid his Lord's money after a
[52:13] long time the Lord of those servants
[52:15] cometh and reckon with them and so he
[52:18] that had received five talents come and
[52:21] brought other five talents saying Lord
[52:23] thou deliver unto me five talents behold
[52:26] I have gained besides them five talents
[52:29] more his lord said unto him well done
[52:33] thou good and faithful servant thou has
[52:36] been Faithful over a few things I will
[52:39] make thee ruler over many things enter
[52:42] thou into the joy of thy Lord he also
[52:45] that received two talents came and said
[52:48] Lord excuse me thou Deliver Us unto me
[52:51] two talents behold I have gained two
[52:53] other talents besid besides them his
[52:56] lord said unto him well done good and
[52:59] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[53:02] over a few things I will make thee ruler
[53:06] over many things read it with me enter
[53:10] thou into the joy of thy
[53:14] Lord look at verse 24 then he which have
[53:17] received the one Talent came and said
[53:20] Lord I knew thee that thou art a hard
[53:24] man reefing where thou has not sown
[53:27] Gathering where thou has not straw and I
[53:30] was afraid and went and hid thy talent
[53:33] in the earth and lo there thou Hast that
[53:36] is thine his Lord answered and said unto
[53:39] him thou Wicked and
[53:42] what
[53:44] what slothful
[53:47] servant thou knowest that I reap where I
[53:49] sow not and gather where I not straw
[53:51] thou ought to us therefore to have put
[53:55] my money to exchangers and then at my
[53:57] coming I should have received my own
[54:00] with Usery take for the talent from him
[54:04] and give it unto him which hath 10
[54:06] talents for unto everyone that hath
[54:09] shall be given and he shall have
[54:13] abundance but from him that hath not
[54:16] shall be taken away even that which he
[54:18] hath and cast ye the unprofitable
[54:22] servant into outer Darkness there shall
[54:26] be weeping and nashing of teeth now this
[54:29] is a parable of our Lord Jesus the
[54:32] loving Lord Jesus and he's given this
[54:35] Parable showing that we all don't
[54:39] receive the same talents
[54:41] gifts and there's other people that have
[54:45] salvation that don't know anything about
[54:48] this picture right here or the seventh
[54:51] seal and maybe would say they have one
[54:54] Talent or two
[54:55] but we the bride of Christ have have
[54:58] been given not because of our own
[55:01] goodness not because we're smarter than
[55:03] anyone else but we have been given the
[55:07] greatest
[55:09] treasure that any Bible believing
[55:13] Christian could ever be given and that's
[55:17] a prophetic insight into the mysteries
[55:21] of
[55:22] God we have the mind of the Lord on
[55:27] these great issues that many many they
[55:31] don't have a clue on and that shouldn't
[55:33] boast us that shouldn't make us feel
[55:35] better that should really just make us
[55:38] feel so much more responsible amen if
[55:41] any of the other preachers from any
[55:44] other age could change or trade places
[55:48] with me I wonder if they would live the
[55:53] the message or live the the life that
[55:55] I'm living today or would they really be
[55:57] on fire for the Lord if the Believers in
[56:00] other ages could trade places with you
[56:03] and look at the opportunities that we
[56:06] have whereas Even In This Very age when
[56:10] the message come we would have to you
[56:13] know we'd have to get take a tape and
[56:15] then find a tape recorder to even play
[56:18] it so that would be in a car or a little
[56:20] Walkman device or at home but now it's
[56:24] we we've moved move that aside now we
[56:26] can listen to the message so frequently
[56:29] and and with a clean you know just a
[56:32] clean hearing audio is just great we can
[56:36] we can do it in the privacy of our home
[56:38] and it basically in American dollars it
[56:41] didn't cost us anything I mean when you
[56:44] look at the price of it it was it was
[56:47] free and and you know God has really
[56:50] been good to us and he is but this is
[56:53] our Lord his attitude
[56:55] was you know at least you could have
[56:59] tried to take my talent a a and and try
[57:03] to develop it in a different way at
[57:06] least you could have and he was not
[57:08] happy with that servant his excuse
[57:11] didn't
[57:13] fly it wasn't it wasn't enough for for
[57:16] him to know that Lord we know that
[57:18] you're heart we know that you you know
[57:20] and I and I was afraid no excuses for
[57:23] that you should have at least and Look
[57:26] What the Lord says bind him
[57:30] and where there will be this great
[57:33] weeping bind him and cast him in the
[57:35] outer dark darkness seemed like that's
[57:38] pretty harsh huh he went from giving us
[57:40] something to work with and now he's
[57:43] upset that I didn't even do anything
[57:45] with what he gave me well that's our
[57:48] Lord he makes us responsible for the
[57:52] things that he give us faithful being
[57:55] faithful is not the most talented or
[57:56] gifted it's not the most decorated or
[57:59] flashy faithfulness is not seeing but
[58:03] observed a quality detected by
[58:06] observation Proverbs
[58:09] 20:6 says most men will Proclaim
[58:12] everyone his own goodness but a faithful
[58:15] man who can find Matthew 2444 says
[58:20] therefore be ye also ready for such an
[58:22] hour as you think not the son of man
[58:25] cometh who then is a faithful and wise
[58:29] servant whom his Lord hath made ruler
[58:32] over his household to give them meet and
[58:35] due season blessed is that servant whom
[58:39] his Lord when he cometh shall find so
[58:44] doing when Desert Storm hit it was in
[58:47] 1991 or 92 or so a lot of my friends
[58:52] made a big turn towards the Lord
[58:54] remember when 911 hit 911 hit the church
[58:59] churches were filled up and all these
[59:01] catastrophes hit and people start trying
[59:03] to come and get right with the Lord but
[59:07] a faithful servant is going to be
[59:10] faithful to their post of Duty no matter
[59:14] what day of the week no matter what time
[59:16] no matter what's going on he's going to
[59:18] be faithful how many message people
[59:22] would come to church tonight if they
[59:24] knew this
[59:26] was indeed their last Wednesday night
[59:30] service well Lord if you would have told
[59:32] me it was my last one I would have came
[59:35] well you made the choice not to come and
[59:40] it's different if you couldn't come then
[59:44] you just couldn't come that's different
[59:46] it's more of an attitude but you could
[59:48] have come and you decided not to come
[59:53] well that's I I wouldn't call that a
[59:55] faithful servant I
[59:58] wouldn't
[1:00:03] okay I like the way brother Brandon puts
[1:00:05] this as I pray to W wrap this up
[1:00:12] here they asked brother bam this
[1:00:14] question and uh it it's in uh questions
[1:00:18] in answers
[1:00:21] 19
[1:00:23] 63
[1:00:25] and it brings the perfect balance should
[1:00:27] evangelist continue on the
[1:00:30] field question they asked brother
[1:00:32] brandom it's like you know they maybe
[1:00:35] maybe we should stop preaching or should
[1:00:37] evangelist continue on the field it's a
[1:00:38] it's a powerful question they really
[1:00:40] gives the Insight of where the people's
[1:00:42] thinking are you know if I was in that
[1:00:45] crowd I'd be like who asked that like
[1:00:48] what do you mean should have what you
[1:00:50] what are y'all talking about should what
[1:00:52] did he say you know but I'm glad the
[1:00:53] question was asked
[1:00:55] because we needed to hear this question
[1:00:56] and we needed the answer for it today
[1:01:00] yes
[1:01:00] sir in this hour of course what they
[1:01:04] mean certainly by all means don't change
[1:01:07] a thing if Jesus is coming in the
[1:01:10] morning Preach Today like if it was
[1:01:14] going to be 10 years from today but live
[1:01:17] like it's going to be at this hour don't
[1:01:20] get scrupled up now that's what I'm
[1:01:22] trying to warn you about see just don't
[1:01:24] be odd
[1:01:27] peculiar don't change nothing but if
[1:01:30] you're doing something wrong or doing
[1:01:31] evil repent see come back to God
[1:01:34] continue on your Evangelistic service
[1:01:37] just as you always did if you're
[1:01:39] building a house put it on up Jesus
[1:01:42] comes tomorrow you'll be found faithful
[1:01:45] at the duty if you're Building a Church
[1:01:48] go on put it up I'd rather be putting my
[1:01:51] money in something like that than be
[1:01:53] found with it in my pocket see so just
[1:01:57] keep on continue as you are everybody
[1:02:01] understand
[1:02:02] now continue right on just go right on
[1:02:05] as you are just don't stop don't do
[1:02:08] nothing just go right on just as you are
[1:02:11] keep on serving the lord now for
[1:02:13] instance if you was working with Amanda
[1:02:16] you know it was 15 minutes before
[1:02:18] quitting time well you say ah just 15
[1:02:22] minutes more so I might as well just go
[1:02:24] over and sit down you'd get docked for
[1:02:27] that 15 minutes if you're planting wheat
[1:02:30] plant your wheat you're digging potatoes
[1:02:33] go on dig them out say well nobody will
[1:02:36] eat them that don't make any difference
[1:02:41] dig them out anyhow see yeah just
[1:02:45] continue on as you are I got a letter
[1:02:48] from somebody the other day somebody
[1:02:50] told them and said well the time is at
[1:02:52] hand sell the farm now you won't need
[1:02:55] the food you live off of on the farm
[1:02:57] said cuz the Millennium is going to
[1:02:59] start and you won't need it so just go
[1:03:01] ahead and while the tribulation period
[1:03:04] is going on your children is not safe so
[1:03:06] just let them let the children have the
[1:03:09] farm where they where they can where
[1:03:11] they can eat off of but you sell your
[1:03:15] farm and something like that and oh they
[1:03:18] had it I said oh my if I know he was
[1:03:21] coming tomorrow and I was a farmer I put
[1:03:24] my crop in today sure if he made me a
[1:03:29] farmer I'm going to stay right at my
[1:03:31] duty that's right if he made me a
[1:03:33] mechanic somebody said the other day a
[1:03:36] fellow come in and said say brother you
[1:03:37] know what I'm going to give you the
[1:03:39] second set of keys he brought a new car
[1:03:42] so I'm going to give you the second set
[1:03:44] of keys and told his Pastor I'm going to
[1:03:46] give you the second set of keys cuz the
[1:03:48] Rapture might come you know and I won't
[1:03:51] be in need
[1:03:53] anymore see the pastor was going to miss
[1:03:55] it you see oh that's making ready isn't
[1:03:58] it all right but that's the way it is
[1:04:01] see we mustn't be that way we must be
[1:04:05] same solid Christian see that I'm put
[1:04:09] here to work right up to the last minute
[1:04:13] I've got a job to do and I'll be right
[1:04:16] found faithful at the post of Duty if he
[1:04:19] comes this morning I want to be standing
[1:04:21] right here in the pull pit you say
[1:04:24] brother brandom if he was if if he was
[1:04:26] to come this morning shouldn't we be out
[1:04:29] there no sir this is my post of Duty
[1:04:33] I'll be standing right here preaching
[1:04:35] when he comes saying the same things I
[1:04:38] am then when he comes I'll just move
[1:04:41] right on out with him see if I'm hoing
[1:04:44] potatoes I'll just be hoing away just as
[1:04:47] hard as I can when he comes I'll just
[1:04:50] drop the hole and take
[1:04:52] off remember in the Jubilee year you're
[1:04:55] hoing with the hoe there's just just
[1:04:57] keep ho on hoing they know the Jubilee
[1:05:00] year was maybe 10 minutes more and the
[1:05:03] trumpet will sound at the Jubilee year
[1:05:05] they just kept on pitching hay whatever
[1:05:08] they was doing but when the trumpet
[1:05:10] sounded then they dropped the Pitchfork
[1:05:13] and gone see that's it just keep on
[1:05:16] pitching hay until the trumpet sounds
[1:05:19] all right so I love that balance that
[1:05:23] brother
[1:05:24] uh brandom gives he in one place he
[1:05:27] talked about the second seal he said if
[1:05:31] he was going to the it was in the third
[1:05:34] shelf I knew he was coming tomorrow
[1:05:36] night tomorrow I would study and ask him
[1:05:40] to give me the message for the fourth
[1:05:42] seal and I come down here and preach it
[1:05:46] just the same see I want to be doing
[1:05:49] every day just what I would be doing if
[1:05:51] he comes and I don't know no other
[1:05:54] better place than to be caught right at
[1:05:56] the post of Duty see at the post of Duty
[1:06:00] see so we just keep carrying on till he
[1:06:04] comes so the Lord reveals us to us our
[1:06:08] post of Duty we don't want to omit it we
[1:06:12] don't want it to let it slip we don't
[1:06:15] want to forsake it because we know that
[1:06:19] these little things are where is where
[1:06:22] our faithfulness is measure Jesus said
[1:06:25] if you're faithful in a few things the
[1:06:29] little things I'll make you ruler over
[1:06:31] many and it's these little things that
[1:06:33] we omit sometimes and we devalue them
[1:06:37] because maybe our attitude in the age
[1:06:40] that we live in and my our our message
[1:06:42] here tonight is just to encourage you to
[1:06:46] remind you to don't let those things
[1:06:49] slip praise the
[1:06:50] Lord I'll read one last quote and I
[1:06:53] didn't give you this sister but if you
[1:06:55] can get it for me it's in the message
[1:06:58] 1963 the way of a true Prophet paragraph
[1:07:02] number
[1:07:04] 27 brother brandom says this
[1:07:07] here so now if you have had to miss work
[1:07:12] to hear to be with us and pray with us
[1:07:15] and so forth you have to miss work
[1:07:18] that's all right just go ahead and miss
[1:07:21] work but don't you miss church
[1:07:24] don't you miss church I want I won't
[1:07:28] make you L enough to miss church but if
[1:07:31] you do have to miss work once in a while
[1:07:33] that won't hurt now cuz work that's just
[1:07:36] your daily bread and you the Lord
[1:07:40] promised to provide that so but this you
[1:07:43] must really be sure to come to church
[1:07:46] you see so brother manam is just
[1:07:49] encouraging us amen that importance that
[1:07:53] our Lord will be here to meet us here
[1:07:57] all
[1:07:59] right all
[1:08:02] right so God bless
[1:08:04] you we don't want to admit any of these
[1:08:06] things we want
[1:08:08] to stay faithful all the way to the end
[1:08:12] praise the
[1:08:13] Lord these things are important they'll
[1:08:16] be important to you when they're
[1:08:18] important to you you you'll internalize
[1:08:21] them and it be it's because it it is
[1:08:24] it'll it'll be you doing it not someone
[1:08:28] making you feel guilty to do it you take
[1:08:31] these these principles of why we come
[1:08:35] and what we're doing when we come here
[1:08:37] and that God is going to meet us here
[1:08:40] those principles are not going they're
[1:08:42] not going to change he said he would
[1:08:44] meet or two or three or gathering in his
[1:08:46] name there I'll be in the midst even
[1:08:49] that much more as the day is approaching
[1:08:51] so God bless you God bless you the
[1:08:55] musicians come let us
[1:08:57] pray father we thank you for your word
[1:08:59] tonight we thank you
[1:09:04] for the ability to take these things
[1:09:08] and with the Pure Heart Lord just
[1:09:11] examine
[1:09:13] ourselves to see where our hearts are
[1:09:16] and see what talents you've given to us
[1:09:19] and am
[1:09:21] I am I
[1:09:24] am I forsaking that Lord am I omitting
[1:09:27] that am I just looking over
[1:09:30] it is it my attitude kind
[1:09:34] of um am I approaching it the wrong way
[1:09:37] Lord or or is this church depending on
[1:09:41] me is this community depending on me am
[1:09:45] am I faithful
[1:09:47] to compelling men to come getting on the
[1:09:51] phone dragging people to to church as it
[1:09:55] was and encouraging them Lord to do my
[1:09:59] part that's what I want to be faithful
[1:10:02] to do Lord I know that you know we
[1:10:05] expect the the ministry to be there we
[1:10:07] expect the deacons and the board members
[1:10:10] we expect maybe some of the older Saints
[1:10:14] to be there Lord but father really every
[1:10:18] believer should internalize and have
[1:10:21] this burden on their heart
[1:10:24] oh God I pray that you would Quicken
[1:10:26] that to us and Lord that you would be
[1:10:32] blessed and you'll be praised your name
[1:10:35] be glorified and magnified as our prayer
[1:10:38] we want to draw closer to you Lord and
[1:10:41] we know that's that means drawing closer
[1:10:43] to your word and the actions and our
[1:10:47] behaviors Lord that are not pleasing to
[1:10:50] you I pray that you'll help us to to
[1:10:55] fall in line with your perfect will for
