[0:00] [Music]
[4:19] Lord, lift me up
[4:23] and let me stand
[4:27] by faith on hand.
[4:32] [Music]
[4:35] a higher plane
[4:39] that I have found.
[4:43] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[4:47] ground. Let's sing that chorus one more
[4:49] time. Lord, lift me up
[4:54] and let me stand
[4:58] by faith on heaven's
[5:03] table land
[5:07] a higher plane
[5:11] that I have found.
[5:15] Lord, plant my feet on high.
[5:19] Let's sing that first verse. I'm
[5:20] pressing on the upward way. I'm pressing
[5:23] on
[5:26] the upward way. New heights I'm gaining
[5:29] every day. New heights I'm gaining
[5:35] every day.
[5:39] Still praying as
[5:43] I'm onward.
[5:47] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[5:52] ground. Lord, lift me up. Lord, lift me
[5:56] up
[5:59] and let me stand
[6:03] by faith on heaven's
[6:05] [Music]
[6:07] table and
[6:11] a higher claim
[6:15] that I have found.
[6:20] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[6:24] ground.
[6:29] Amen. Let's stand together if we could.
[6:30] Let's go to the key of C. Sister Abby.
[6:35] My heart was distressed
[6:38] Jehovah's tread brown and low in the pit
[6:44] where my sins dragged me down. I cry to
[6:48] the Lord from the deep my clay who
[6:54] tenderly brought me out to golden day.
[6:59] Oh, he brought me out of the mighty
[7:04] flame.
[7:06] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[7:12] He puts a song in my soul today. It's a
[7:18] song of praise. Hallelujah.
[7:24] Then he placed me upon the strong rock
[7:28] by his side. My steps were established.
[7:33] And here all about there's no danger of
[7:38] fall.
[7:40] Here I remain, but stand by his grace
[7:45] until the crown I came. For he brought
[7:50] me out of the mighty clank.
[7:56] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[8:02] He puts a song in my soul today.
[8:07] It's a song of praise. Hallelujah.
[8:13] And then he gave me a song was a new
[8:18] song of praise. By day and by night, his
[8:23] sweet nose already. My heart's
[8:28] overflowing.
[8:29] I'm happy and free. I will praise my
[8:34] redeemer who has rescued me for he
[8:40] brought me out of the mighty clay.
[8:45] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[8:52] He puts a song in my soul today. It's a
[8:58] song of praise. Hallelujah.
[9:02] I'll sing of his wonderful sing of his
[9:06] wonderful
[9:08] mercy to me. I will praise him till all
[9:13] in his goodness shall sing a sing of
[9:18] salvation
[9:19] and home and abro
[9:22] till many shall hear the truth and trust
[9:27] in God. Yes, he brought me out of the
[9:32] fiery flame.
[9:35] He set my feet on the rock to stay.
[9:42] He puts a song in my soul today.
[9:47] A song of praise. Hallelujah.
[9:53] [Music]
[9:57] Amen. Brother Rick, would you come open
[9:58] our service tonight with a word of
[10:00] prayer?
[10:01] [Music]
[10:13] Heavenly Father, we come before you in
[10:17] thanksgiving this day to be in your
[10:20] presence and use this service.
[10:24] We pray that you lead us and guide us
[10:27] with your Holy Spirit.
[10:29] Help us do that which we should and do
[10:32] not that which we should not. We have a
[10:36] problem with this both ways all the time
[10:39] before you Lord. And we ask your
[10:42] forgiveness. Your blood on the cross is
[10:45] all that can save us. And we know that
[10:48] we claim the blood for us, our children
[10:52] and our children's children, and all we
[10:55] do business with that we may do business
[10:58] with godly men, not men of iniquity.
[11:02] We pray in Jesus holy name. Amen.
[11:10] Yes, he set my feet on the rock to stay.
[11:19] Puts a song in my soul today.
[11:25] A song
[11:27] of praise.
[11:29] Hallelujah.
[11:30] [Music]
[11:32] Can we just give him a praise offering
[11:33] before we're sing?
[11:41] Amen. You can be seated.
[11:44] Had a couple me people mention to me
[11:46] this morning that
[11:48] had we try to have a mixture of songs
[11:51] when we sing, but we want to praise him
[11:53] in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs. And
[11:56] to me, that's we just want to have a
[11:57] have a variety and not just all the the
[12:00] same type. But sometimes I sing songs
[12:03] that I've known for a long time, but
[12:05] maybe not all of you do. So, a few
[12:07] people said something to me. So, could
[12:09] we try to sing some that maybe the rest
[12:11] of us know? So, I know there's one
[12:13] tonight that maybe not all of you know,
[12:15] but Sister Abby practiced that a little
[12:17] bit this afternoon. We want to sing
[12:19] that. But I think we can all if you
[12:22] don't know the words, just read the
[12:23] words and it'll be a prayer that we can
[12:25] all say, "Lord, that's my prayer
[12:26] tonight." But this is uh Lord take me
[12:29] deeper deeper in love with you. Jesus
[12:33] hold me close in your embrace.
[12:37] [Music]
[12:39] There is a longing
[12:43] only you can feel
[12:48] a raging tempest
[12:51] only you can steal.
[12:55] My soul is thirsty Lord to know you as
[13:01] I'm known.
[13:04] Drink from the river
[13:07] that flows before your throne.
[13:12] Lord, take me deeper,
[13:16] deeper in love
[13:18] with you,
[13:21] Jesus. Hold me close in your embrace.
[13:28] Oh, take me deeper.
[13:32] Deeper than I've ever been before.
[13:36] I just want to love you more and more.
[13:40] How I long
[13:43] to be deeper in love. How many can say
[13:46] that's your desire tonight?
[13:50] Sunrise to sunrise,
[13:54] I will seek your face,
[13:58] drawn by the spirit to the promise of
[14:03] your grace.
[14:06] My heart has found in you a hope that
[14:11] will abide
[14:14] here in your presence.
[14:18] Forever satisfied.
[14:23] Take me deeper,
[14:27] deeper in love
[14:29] with you.
[14:32] Jesus, hold me close in your embrace.
[14:37] [Music]
[14:39] Take me deeper,
[14:43] deeper than I've ever been before.
[14:47] I just want to love you more. And
[14:51] how I long
[14:53] to be deeper in love.
[14:59] I wonder if we could just correct the
[15:00] second verse. I've got some different
[15:02] words, different lyrics on that first
[15:03] line, but I think what we displayed here
[15:05] is sunrise to sunset, I will seek your
[15:08] face. But I don't want to quit seeking
[15:10] his face at sunset and take a pause
[15:12] until the morning. So maybe we can
[15:14] change that one. Sunrise to sunrise
[15:17] because then it's constantly we're
[15:19] seeking his face just like as far as the
[15:21] east is from the west. You can you can
[15:23] define the north from the south, but you
[15:26] can't you're never going to get any
[15:27] further to the west when you're
[15:29] traveling east.
[15:31] But you can run to the point of the top
[15:32] of the North Pole and then you're going
[15:34] to be heading south. But so let's do
[15:36] sunrise to sunrise. I will seek your
[15:38] face. And if it's ready, let's just sing
[15:40] that one more time. Lord, that's my
[15:42] commitment tonight. Sunrise to sunrise.
[15:46] I will seek your face.
[15:49] [Music]
[15:51] Drawn by the spirit to the promise of
[15:56] your grace.
[15:59] My heart has found in you a hope that
[16:03] will abide
[16:07] here in your presence.
[16:10] Forever
[16:12] satisfied.
[16:15] Oh, take me deeper,
[16:19] deeper in love
[16:22] with you.
[16:24] Jesus, hold me close in your embrace.
[16:31] Take me deeper,
[16:35] deeper than I've ever been before.
[16:39] I just want to love you more and more.
[16:44] How I long
[16:46] to be deeper in love.
[16:50] [Music]
[16:55] When peace
[16:57] like a river
[17:03] attendeth
[17:06] my way.
[17:10] and sorrow
[17:13] like steep
[17:16] below
[17:18] road.
[17:25] Whatever
[17:28] my Lord,
[17:32] thou has taught
[17:34] me
[17:36] to say.
[17:39] It is well.
[17:42] It is well
[17:45] with
[17:47] my soul.
[17:53] It is well
[17:57] [Music]
[18:00] with my soul.
[18:04] with my soul.
[18:08] It is well.
[18:11] It is well
[18:15] with my soul.
[18:20] Though Satan should buff it, though
[18:24] Satan
[18:27] should buff
[18:29] it, though trials
[18:35] should come.
[18:38] Let this
[18:41] bless
[18:42] assure
[18:44] us
[18:46] control
[18:53] that Christ
[18:56] had regarded
[18:59] [Music]
[19:01] my
[19:03] bless
[19:05] state
[19:07] And as shed
[19:11] his own blood
[19:14] for my soul.
[19:18] [Music]
[19:22] It is well.
[19:25] It is well
[19:29] with my soul.
[19:33] with my soul.
[19:36] It is well.
[19:40] It is well
[19:44] with my soul.
[19:47] Let's sing the third verse together now.
[19:49] My sin, all the bliss, my sin,
[19:55] all the bliss
[19:58] of this glorious
[20:04] thought.
[20:07] My sin
[20:09] not
[20:11] in part
[20:14] but the whole
[20:21] was nailed
[20:24] to the cross
[20:28] and I bear
[20:31] it no more. Oh,
[20:36] praise the Lord.
[20:39] Praise the Lord,
[20:42] oh my soul.
[20:50] It is well
[20:57] with my soul.
[21:03] All it is is well.
[21:08] It is well.
[21:11] Brothers Joe. Joe, if you can come just
[21:14] sing that chorus one more time as they
[21:16] come forward.
[21:18] Oh, it is well
[21:22] [Music]
[21:26] with my soul.
[21:32] Oh, it is well.
[21:37] It is well
[21:40] with my soul.
[21:45] [Music]
[21:51] Amen. God bless everyone.
[21:54] We have some prayer requests tonight.
[22:00] Let's continue to remember the Snow
[22:02] family and the strength and
[22:04] encouragement. God has brought them a
[22:06] mighty long way already.
[22:08] And then we also have a request here
[22:11] from Elisa Par, Sister Elisa Par. Please
[22:14] remember in prayer my sister and her
[22:16] husband Elia and Edward Sanchez. They
[22:19] lost a mobile home and a truck in the
[22:21] floods in San Angelo, Texas. My
[22:24] brother-in-law was able to go and
[22:26] recover a few pictures and things he's
[22:28] going and things and he's going through
[22:31] a very hard time after seeing the
[22:33] destruction. Please pray for them and
[22:36] those that lost loved ones.
[22:38] Amen.
[22:41] Can we all stand and take this to the
[22:44] Lord in prayer? Amen. Bow our heads.
[22:48] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful
[22:50] for what you have done for us, Lord, as
[22:53] we think of the communion night tonight,
[22:56] Father, and Lord, not in part, but in
[22:59] whole, Father. You paid the price for
[23:01] our sins, Lord. A debt we could not pay,
[23:05] Lord. A debt you didn't even owe, but
[23:07] you, Father, died for us, Lord. And we
[23:10] thank you for that, Lord Jesus. We pray
[23:13] for the Snow family, Sister Lori. Lord,
[23:16] continue, Father, the blessing in her
[23:18] life, the speedy recovery, Father, Lord,
[23:22] all you have done. The Sanchez family,
[23:24] Father, and St. Angelo, wherever they
[23:27] may be right now, Father, we pray that
[23:29] you'd,
[23:31] Lord, lead them on the path of
[23:32] restoration.
[23:34] Help them, Father, in all things, Lord,
[23:36] the families, the whole community that's
[23:38] been affected. Lord, we're asking for
[23:41] your mercy, Lord, and your grace, Lord.
[23:44] Not that we deserve anything, Father,
[23:46] but you have done it, Father, for us.
[23:49] And we thank you for your free gift.
[23:52] Thank you for salvation of body and
[23:54] soul. Lord Jesus, be with us tonight as
[23:57] we remember you, Father, in all
[23:58] sincerity.
[24:00] Lord, prepare our hearts, make us ready,
[24:03] and we'll give you the praise and the
[24:04] glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, we
[24:06] ask. Amen.
[24:13] We have a couple song specials tonight.
[24:14] Maybe we could just sing that chorus,
[24:16] same key, shut him with God as our
[24:19] brother Shawn comes to sing for us.
[24:22] Shut in
[24:25] with God
[24:28] in a secret
[24:32] place.
[24:34] There
[24:36] in the spirit
[24:39] beholding
[24:41] his face
[24:45] gaining
[24:47] new power
[24:50] to run in the race.
[24:54] How I long
[24:57] to be shut in with God.
[25:04] You can be seated.
[25:09] May God bless you. Happy to be in the
[25:11] house of the Lord tonight.
[25:17] What? Sing it with me as long as he's in
[25:20] the house.
[25:23] So, one thing about the song, we're all
[25:29] the second verse tells of a girl that
[25:32] was dead in all our sin till Jesus
[25:34] touched his heart. We were like that
[25:36] little girl and he gave us life again.
[25:39] Amen. Believe we can all say that
[25:41] tonight.
[25:43] [Music]
[25:46] Little girl was lying there. People all
[25:51] were weeping.
[25:53] [Music]
[25:54] They just laughed at Jesus
[25:57] when he said she's only sleeping.
[26:03] As he took her by the hand,
[26:07] she began to live again.
[26:11] Some begin to praise the Lord. And some
[26:15] begin to say,
[26:18] "He's in the house.
[26:22] [Music]
[26:23] Death has to flee.
[26:25] [Applause]
[26:27] Now there is life.
[26:30] Where darkness used to be,
[26:35] now there is hope.
[26:39] There's no more doubt.
[26:42] Praise his name.
[26:46] Praise his name.
[26:50] He's in the house.
[26:57] We were like that little girl, dead in
[27:01] all our sins.
[27:04] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[27:08] and gave me life again.
[27:12] And I am just a house of clay. And ever
[27:17] since that blessed day,
[27:20] there's a light that shines in me for
[27:24] all the world to see.
[27:27] That he's in the house.
[27:31] Death has to flee. You sing it with me.
[27:35] And now there is light
[27:39] where darkness used to be.
[27:43] Now there is hope.
[27:47] There's no more doubt.
[27:50] Praise his name.
[27:54] Praise his name.
[27:58] He's in the house.
[28:02] Death has to flee.
[28:06] And now there is life.
[28:09] Where darkness used to be,
[28:13] now there is hope.
[28:17] There's no more doubt.
[28:21] Praise his name.
[28:25] Praise his name. Let's sing the second
[28:28] verse together. The house
[28:35] We were like that little girl who met it
[28:39] all our sins
[28:42] till Jesus touched this heart of mine.
[28:46] He gave us life again.
[28:48] Now I'm just a house of clay. I'm just a
[28:52] house of clay. And ever since that
[28:55] blessed day,
[28:58] there's a light that shines on me for
[29:01] all the world to see.
[29:05] That he's in the house.
[29:09] Death has to flee.
[29:12] And now there is light
[29:16] where darkness used to be.
[29:20] Now there is hope.
[29:24] There's no more doubt.
[29:28] Praise his name.
[29:32] Praise his name.
[29:36] He's in the house
[29:39] that death has to flee.
[29:43] And now there is light where darkness
[29:46] used to be. This used to be. Now there's
[29:49] hope. Now there is hope.
[29:54] There's no more down.
[29:58] Praise his name.
[30:01] Praise his name.
[30:05] Praise his name.
[30:09] Praise his name.
[30:13] Praise his name.

[30:21] He's in the house.
[30:27] Bless you.
[30:33] [Music]
[30:38] God bless you all.
[30:41] I'm not the most articulate when it
[30:44] comes to my prayers. Sometimes I have a
[30:46] hard time praying a a beautiful prayer,
[30:51] but my heart's always in it. But
[30:54] sometimes when I really want to
[30:57] pray a beautiful prayer, sometimes I'll
[30:59] just sing sing a song or I'll think of
[31:02] the words to a song and I'll be getting
[31:05] halfway through it and just start crying
[31:07] in my prayer. This is one of those. And
[31:09] I think I think tonight's an appropriate
[31:12] night for it. I know I song led it
[31:13] recently, but if you'd like to sing with
[31:16] me, I hope it's a blessing to you.
[31:22] Search
[31:25] me,
[31:27] oh God,
[31:32] and know
[31:35] my heart
[31:38] today.
[31:44] Try
[31:46] me,
[31:48] oh Savior.
[31:55] Know
[31:56] my thoughts
[31:59] I pray.
[32:06] See
[32:08] if
[32:10] there be
[32:16] some wicked wicked way
[32:21] in me.
[32:27] Cleans
[32:30] me
[32:32] from every
[32:35] sin
[32:37] and set
[32:41] me
[32:43] free.
[32:49] I
[32:52] praise
[32:53] thee Lord
[32:59] for cleansing
[33:02] me
[33:04] from sin
[33:11] for
[33:15] thy word
[33:21] and make
[33:23] me pure
[33:25] with it.
[33:28] [Music]
[33:31] Fill
[33:34] me
[33:36] with fire
[33:41] where once
[33:44] I burn
[33:46] with shame.
[33:49] [Music]
[33:52] Grant
[33:55] my
[33:57] desire
[34:00] to magnify
[34:02] [Music]
[34:06] thy
[34:08] name.
[34:13] Lord,
[34:16] take
[34:18] my life
[34:23] and make
[34:26] it holy
[34:29] thine.
[34:34] Fill
[34:37] my
[34:39] poor heart
[34:42] with
[34:45] thy
[34:46] great love
[34:49] divine.
[34:50] [Music]
[34:55] Take
[34:57] all
[34:59] my will,
[35:04] my passion,
[35:08] self
[35:09] and right.
[35:15] I
[35:18] now
[35:20] surrender
[35:23] Lord
[35:25] in me.
[35:27] [Music]
[35:38] Holy
[35:41] Ghost,
[35:45] revival
[35:49] comes
[35:50] from thee.
[35:56] 10
[35:59] day
[36:01] revival
[36:07] start
[36:09] the work
[36:11] in me.
[36:14] [Music]
[36:17] I
[36:20] word
[36:22] declares.
[36:26] Thou wilt
[36:29] supply
[36:32] our need
[36:38] for
[36:40] blessing
[36:43] now.
[36:44] Oh Lord,
[36:47] I humbly
[36:51] [Music]
[37:00] [Applause]
[37:03] Amen. that stand together this evening.
[37:06] You know, just looking out and it's good
[37:08] to see a good crowd on a summer night
[37:12] and in Tucson on a Sunday night. A lot
[37:15] of different things we could be doing,
[37:16] but you know, I'm not happy with a
[37:20] half-filled church. You know, I' I'd
[37:23] like to see just fire of God burning in
[37:26] everyone's heart where they just they
[37:28] can't wait for the doors to be open
[37:29] again. And I know I know there's people
[37:32] that are gone that are traveling, those
[37:34] that are recovering from surgery that
[37:36] would love to be here that can't be
[37:37] here. I think of those that maybe are
[37:41] are seasonally here and just the
[37:43] dingwalls, what a blessing they were
[37:45] when they were out here and how they
[37:47] gave of themselves and just to make our
[37:49] life more comfortable after after they
[37:51] were gone. And just just thinking as we
[37:53] have communion tonight, maybe just look
[37:55] around and and think of those that
[37:57] aren't here and just let's just have a
[38:00] burden for those and just Lord, lay some
[38:04] soul upon my heart, Lord. May may I do
[38:08] my part, Lord, to encourage that. Maybe
[38:10] it's not win a soul for them, but maybe
[38:12] they're just just a little discouraged
[38:14] right now. And we can do something that
[38:15] we could lift them up, that we could we
[38:17] could make their day a little brighter.
[38:19] Amen.
[38:21] Amen.
[38:23] Maybe in the key of C, we could just
[38:25] sing one chorus. Change my heart, oh
[38:28] God. You know that one.
[38:31] Let's not do you know it.
[38:34] She's saying no. We'll stick with one
[38:37] that we can all do. Let go and let God
[38:39] have his wonderful way. Key of F. Just
[38:43] let go and let God have his wonderful
[38:51] way. Just let go
[38:55] and let God have his way.
[39:03] Your sorrows
[39:06] will vanish.
[39:09] your night turn today.
[39:13] Just let go and let God have his way.
[39:21] Just sing it one more time. You can be
[39:24] seated. Let go
[39:26] and let God have his wonderful
[39:33] way.
[39:34] Let go
[39:37] and let God
[39:40] have his way.
[39:45] Your sorrows
[39:48] will vanish.
[39:50] Your night turned.
[39:55] Just let go
[39:57] and let God have
[40:01] his way. Just continue to play.
[40:08] [Music]
[40:28] Rose will vanish.
[40:31] or night. Turn to death.
[40:36] Let go.
[40:39] [Music]
[40:40] God have his way.
[40:44] Amen. Well, God bless all of you saints.
[40:46] So happy to be in the house of the Lord
[40:48] with you this evening. Are you glad to
[40:50] be here?
[40:51] Amen. God bless you. So, we wanted to um
[40:56] I was going to speak first, but I really
[40:58] should do the ordination first. So,
[41:00] we'll ask brother Joe to come forward
[41:03] and as he prepares to come, let us stand
[41:07] and take our Bibles. We'll turn in the
[41:09] scriptures.
[41:12] 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[41:23] his wife can come with him too at some
[41:26] point. Well, yes, you the
[41:31] his first wife.
[41:35] 1 Timothy chapter 3 and we'll pray with
[41:38] both of them together. We'll just get
[41:40] the scripture reading for you. Certainly
[41:42] appreciate our brother
[41:48] Joe.
[41:50] And all these years I've been
[41:51] pronouncing it wrong. How do we say it?
[41:55] Galante. All right. Joe Galante. That's
[41:58] how he says it. That's the way he wants
[42:01] it said. Amen. All right. So the
[42:03] scripture says, "Likewise, must the
[42:06] deacons be grave,
[42:08] not double tonged, not given too much
[42:12] wine, not greedy or filthy lucer,
[42:15] holding the mystery of the faith in a
[42:18] pure conscience, and let these also
[42:21] first be proved, then let them use the
[42:24] office of a deacon, being found
[42:26] blameless. Even so must their wives be
[42:29] grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful
[42:33] in all things. Let the duck, let the
[42:35] deacons be the husbands of one wife,
[42:39] ruling their children in their own
[42:41] houses well. For they that have used the
[42:45] office of a deacon well purchased to
[42:47] themselves a good degree and great
[42:50] boldness in the faith which is in Christ
[42:54] Jesus.
[42:56] Uh the prophet of God makes this
[42:59] statement here in the message healing
[43:02] and what sickness is 1950 he says this
[43:07] paragraph 10 divine healings in reach of
[43:10] every person and every person that is a
[43:12] Christian has a right to pray for the
[43:15] sick that's right if there's any among
[43:18] you sick call the elders that's the
[43:22] deacons in your church see then he said,
[43:25] "Confess your faults one to another, and
[43:27] pray one for another."
[43:30] In expectations, the prophet said,
[43:32] "Confess your faults one to another.
[43:34] Pray for one for another that you might
[43:36] be healed. If there's any sick among
[43:38] you, let them call the elders." Now, we
[43:40] call them in our groups. We call them
[43:43] the deacons.
[43:45] Let them call the elders of the church.
[43:48] Let them anoint them with oil. It's not
[43:51] called the elder but the elders plural
[43:54] two or three where two or three are
[43:57] gathered together and agree and pray.
[44:00] See that's the way we do it.
[44:05] Total deliverance
[44:07] 1959. The prophet says this. Now
[44:10] therefore, now there is a group of
[44:12] offices of our church, deacons,
[44:14] trustees, Sunday school superintendent,
[44:17] pastors as our church is set in order.
[44:20] And you, the people elected these
[44:21] officers and this pastor. I'm just
[44:25] general overseer, seeing it goes on
[44:28] right. And to give advice and so forth.
[44:31] You are the one who elects your pastor.
[44:33] You elect your trustees. You elect your
[44:36] deacons. You elect every office there is
[44:38] in this church. You people, it's and
[44:41] it's your duty to stand by those men.
[44:44] See, for they'll make mistakes. They're
[44:46] mortal. They're just men and they'll
[44:49] make mistakes.
[44:52] Amen. Can I read one more?
[44:55] Amen.
[44:55] Church order 1963 December. Prophet of
[44:59] God says this here.
[45:01] That isn't brother Neville's job. That's
[45:03] your job. See, you don't tell Brother
[45:05] Neville what to preach or how to preach.
[45:08] See, that's your job. You deacons,
[45:10] you're supposed to do that. You take
[45:11] care of that. That's nothing to Brother
[45:13] Neville. That's your job. See, now if a
[45:16] policeman's out here on the street and
[45:18] he sees a man stealing property out of
[45:20] the back out of the back of a car,
[45:22] should he call the mayor and say, "Now,
[45:24] mayor, your honor, sir, I'm working for
[45:26] you here in this police force. Now, I
[45:29] find a man up the street here. He's
[45:31] stealing some tires off of a car last
[45:33] night. Now, I just wonder what's your
[45:35] opinion of that. Huh? See? See, that
[45:38] wouldn't be sensible, wouldn't it? No,
[45:40] sir. If he has if he was doing something
[45:43] wrong, arrest him. And if a man's doing
[45:46] something wrong here in the church and
[45:47] anybody stop them, talk to them. Don't
[45:50] be arrogant. But if they won't listen,
[45:53] speak to speak in a way that they know
[45:56] what you're saying. See? See? like you
[45:58] tell a child say walk back there and
[46:00] he's misbehaving
[46:02] deacon stay at your place and brother
[46:05] Bham goes on paragraph 131 the deacon
[46:10] takes care of the house of God someone
[46:13] come in come in speak to them be there
[46:15] to greet them shake their hand that's
[46:18] you're the policeman
[46:22] a policeman or the deacon is a military
[46:25] police to the army courtesy
[46:28] but yet with authority. See, you know
[46:30] what a military police is? Is actually
[46:33] he carries out his rights. I think he's
[46:35] just like a chaplain. You see, it's
[46:38] courtesy and everything, but yet he has
[46:40] an authority. See, we must mind him. He
[46:44] puts these rookies get out there and get
[46:46] drunk while he puts them in their place.
[46:48] And so is the deacon to put them in
[46:53] their place. Can everybody say amen to
[46:54] that?
[46:55] You know, we we apply that to everybody,
[46:57] but probably us.
[46:59] We have a hard time. The deacon, don't
[47:01] come over here, tell me what to do. I'm
[47:02] a grown man. I know what I'm doing. But
[47:05] we're reading the quotations of the
[47:06] prophet. Now, somebody if a deacon sees
[47:09] something, they have to have some kind
[47:11] of authority to do it. And you know the
[47:13] character of the brothers that serve
[47:15] here, they love you with all their
[47:16] heart. And they we don't want I don't
[47:20] want to run in it with nobody. I just
[47:22] want good smiles all the time. But
[47:26] there's times we have to say things and
[47:27] do things that's a bit uncomfortable.
[47:29] But we do that in service to the Lord.
[47:32] And I'm sure you all you saints
[47:34] understand that. And that's the position
[47:36] and the post of a deacon. And so there
[47:40] are elders in the church and I've known
[47:42] brother Joe for quite some time, but I
[47:46] didn't know that's how you say his last
[47:48] name.
[47:50] and Sister Galanti.
[47:53] Galant, did I say it right? Yes.
[47:55] Galante. And um so we want to uh pray
[48:00] for them. I'm ask uh some of the other
[48:03] brothers. Brother Joe can come forward.
[48:05] Brother Chris, brother Ben obviously
[48:08] come forward. And let's bow our heads as
[48:11] we ask God's blessing
[48:14] over our brother.
[48:18] Let's all pray. Bow your heads. Lord
[48:20] Jesus, thank you for my brother and my
[48:23] sister. You've called them to work with
[48:25] us in this life. What a privilege, Lord,
[48:29] to serve you in your great army. And
[48:32] Lord, we make mistakes, Lord, but we
[48:34] don't mean to. And I pray that the
[48:36] anointing of the Holy Spirit would rest
[48:38] upon our brother. Bless him. I pray his
[48:41] dear wife. Lord, use him in service.
[48:45] Lord, may you hear his prayer. anyone
[48:47] comes up for prayer, Lord, may he have
[48:49] the faith to cast the devils away. And
[48:52] may we join him, Lord, and stand with
[48:55] him
[48:55] as he stands with us and we support one
[48:58] another. In Jesus name we pray. We thank
[49:01] you, Father. Amen. Amen. God bless you,
[49:05] brother Joe, sister Elise. God bless
[49:08] you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[49:10] praise for our brother. Amen.
[49:13] Your wife.
[49:15] Amen. While we're standing,
[49:18] um, let's take the scriptures in, um, I
[49:24] think we were in Mark chapter 4, and I'm
[49:28] just going to finish up a little bit
[49:29] before we go to the table of the Lord.
[49:35] We have been speaking on adoption these
[49:38] last few services. I I'm titling it the
[49:42] orders of adoption, but then these
[49:44] little uh subject orders of adoption and
[49:47] then these titles, the placing of the
[49:50] seed this morning. And we'll continue in
[49:53] that just for one portion here in Mark
[49:57] chapter 4. When you have that, you can
[49:59] say amen.
[50:06] It's a parable that Jesus gives.
[50:12] And he explains the parable
[50:18] in verse 13. It says, "And he said unto
[50:20] them, know ye not this parable, and how
[50:22] then will you know all parables?
[50:26] The swer sweethth the word, and these
[50:30] are they by the wayside, where the word
[50:33] is sown. But when they have heard, Satan
[50:35] cometh immediately, and taketh away the
[50:38] word that was sown in their heart. And
[50:41] these are they likewise, which are sown
[50:43] on stony ground, who when they have
[50:45] heard the word, immediately receive it
[50:47] with gladness, and have no root in
[50:49] themselves, and so endure, but for a
[50:52] time afterwards, when affliction or
[50:55] persecution arises for the word's sake,
[50:57] immediately they are offended. And these
[50:59] are they which are sown among thorns,
[51:02] such as hear the word, and the cares of
[51:05] this world, and deceitfulness of riches,
[51:08] and the lust of other things entering in
[51:11] choke the word, and it becometh
[51:14] unfruitful. And these are they which are
[51:17] sown among good ground, such as hear the
[51:20] word, receive it, and bring forth fruit.
[51:24] Some 30, some 60, some hundfold.
[51:29] Now, if you have been raised in church,
[51:32] you've heard this parable many, many
[51:34] times. It's a very familiar parable. the
[51:38] parable of the swer
[51:41] and his seed being sowed on different
[51:44] grounds.
[51:45] And so we'll move forward just a little
[51:47] bit. Let us pray one more time. Lord
[51:49] Jesus, we ask your blessings on the
[51:52] word. Bless your people. We pray in
[51:55] Jesus name. Amen.
[51:57] God bless you. You may be seated. We
[51:59] greet the saints in Mesa faithfully
[52:02] holding steady sister um um
[52:08] Trevor's little sister Ella is here with
[52:12] us today and good to have her. God bless
[52:14] her richly. Good to have each of you.
[52:18] Appreciate those song specials also. So
[52:21] here is the placing of the seed that we
[52:24] see that the seed itself needs to find a
[52:28] place
[52:30] and it is a mature seed finding mature
[52:36] ground.
[52:39] So the seed has to find the right kind
[52:42] of a ground and this is this u wayside
[52:46] stony ground among thorns and then good
[52:50] ground. You know these parables that
[52:52] Jesus gives when he says the wayside
[52:56] he's talking about people. When he's
[52:58] talking about the stony ground he's
[53:00] talking about people. When he's talking
[53:03] about the among the thorns he's talking
[53:06] about people. These are people that all
[53:09] hear the word and in hearing the word
[53:12] this word has a reaction
[53:15] should have an action upon them. You
[53:18] know at the wayside we see that the word
[53:21] after it's planted or preached then
[53:23] Satan comes to take that word that was
[53:27] heard. And I and I I just have to
[53:30] believe that this isn't isn't a one-time
[53:34] happening. This isn't just to a
[53:37] newcomer. I believe that anytime the
[53:40] word is being preached to a believer
[53:42] that Satan tries to capture that word
[53:46] from finding its resting place and its
[53:49] resting place is to be found on mature
[53:53] ground, mature soil and so that it can
[53:57] have its uh maturity. This is the seed
[54:02] coming to maturity. This are this is our
[54:05] lives our ministries coming to maturity.
[54:08] This is sons and daughters of God
[54:11] finding their position and then finding
[54:13] your position then you grow into
[54:16] maturity
[54:18] and that was the purpose of it. Some
[54:21] will produce 60fold
[54:24] some will produce 30fold.
[54:28] Some will produce a hundfold.
[54:31] But the true seed when it hits the
[54:33] mature ground, the true ground, it will
[54:37] have an effect upon your life. And this
[54:40] is what we all want to see, isn't it? We
[54:43] want to see growth in our life. I'm
[54:45] talking about spiritually
[54:48] where we can spiritually look in the
[54:50] mirror of God's word and see where God
[54:52] brought you from
[54:53] and what he has done for you. As I said
[54:56] this morning, we don't know what our
[54:57] future we didn't know. Some of us didn't
[54:59] know we would be sitting in the seat
[55:01] that we're sitting in today. We don't
[55:04] know what field God would call us to
[55:06] serve in. We just don't know. So, we
[55:10] just want to be faithful to whatever God
[55:13] has called us and whatever portion that
[55:16] he has called us and whatever way he has
[55:18] called us to serve. We want to be
[55:20] faithful with that because we are coming
[55:23] to maturity
[55:26] and we want to be able to be able to
[55:28] look back over our life spiritually
[55:32] speaking and see the victories that we
[55:35] have won. And please don't receive that
[55:39] you know everything is a a test. It's so
[55:42] hurtful. It's so hard. It's just
[55:44] gruesome. And we've been fighting all of
[55:46] our life. And that is true. We are
[55:48] fighting all of our life. But it's not
[55:51] it's not sad. It's it's a sweet it's so
[55:56] beautiful when you overcome a test.
[55:59] How many's ever been through a battle
[56:01] and then you come through it? There's
[56:04] there's an emotion that comes over when
[56:06] you pass the test
[56:08] like it was hurtful, it was hard, you
[56:10] lost something, you had to gain
[56:12] something, but then you passed the test
[56:15] and you get to move forward. And so your
[56:17] life isn't just in the valley. We have
[56:21] our mountaintop experiences.
[56:24] There's some joy bells. There's some
[56:27] times to dance.
[56:29] And as I said it many times, this church
[56:31] can use a good praise break
[56:34] where everybody runs the aisles. Just
[56:38] have Why you running? Oh, because I can.
[56:41] And just run for the Lord.
[56:43] Thankful. I was listening to this u one
[56:47] of my favorite football teams at
[56:48] Pittsburgh Steelers and one of the the
[56:51] uh the receivers had got the call that
[56:54] he was being drafted, something he
[56:56] worked for his whole life. And so while
[56:58] his family was on the news looking at
[57:00] who he was going to get drafted to, the
[57:02] team that was drafting him called him
[57:05] first and he was upstairs in his room
[57:07] and he said he got the phone call and
[57:09] the coach called him and told him
[57:10] they're drafting him. He takes off
[57:13] running, runs down the stairs, and he
[57:15] takes off running down the street
[57:16] because he was so happy. And the family
[57:18] didn't know what happened, what's going
[57:19] on. And they're waiting to see, did he
[57:21] get drafted? But he's so happy just
[57:23] running.
[57:25] And I feel like we got something to run
[57:27] about.
[57:29] We got something to be happy about.
[57:32] And I long for the day when this church
[57:35] would just, oh my, the joy of the Lord
[57:38] would strike every heart. And uh we'd
[57:41] have a wonderful time in the Lord Jesus.
[57:44] How many's ever had one of those times?
[57:47] Oh yes. Yes. We've spent a while. I
[57:50] remember on the Sunday night we had a
[57:52] Holy Spirit poured out in our service in
[57:54] Sacramento. Just a young man. Oh my. I
[57:57] couldn't do nothing but jump. I I used
[57:59] to be able to jump pretty high then.
[58:02] But I just jumped and jumped. and my
[58:05] good friend, brother Reese, we just
[58:06] started leaping at the altar, just happy
[58:09] like we won the Super Bowl or got a
[58:12] million dollars or something. It was
[58:14] just the the anointing of joy came upon
[58:16] us.
[58:17] And I'm kind I don't like to be in the
[58:19] front and I don't He might think I do,
[58:21] but I really don't like people looking
[58:23] at me. But when the joy strikes you,
[58:27] oh my I just had to dance and praise the
[58:30] Lord. And so we can, you know, the
[58:33] battle that we're in, it isn't just a
[58:35] gruesome fight, but we are in the most
[58:38] wicked of all the ages. And it is a
[58:41] terrible time. And um but there are some
[58:45] beautiful, sweet victories that we want
[58:48] to gain and mature by. Amen. I want to
[58:53] grow as a servant of the Lord. I want to
[58:57] grow in his grace and mercy. And so here
[59:00] we see this seed is coming to maturity.
[59:04] It's a seed I it falls on good ground
[59:08] and after falling in good ground it
[59:10] moves forward. The the thing with this
[59:14] seed is that the thing with this parable
[59:17] is that everyone heard the same word.
[59:23] And that's the touchy part that we have
[59:25] to touch on just a little bit. They all
[59:28] heard the same word. The seer, the swer
[59:33] swed the word of God in all of these
[59:37] places. The same word, same message.
[59:40] It's the Bible. It's the truth. It was
[59:43] sold here. It was sold there. It was
[59:45] sold there. It was all like, you know,
[59:47] we heard the same tape, so to speak. The
[59:51] same scriptures were given to everyone.
[59:54] But the effects of it was quite
[59:56] different. The word of God warns us of
[59:58] that. I don't know who the next pastor
[1:00:00] will be that will turn his back on the
[1:00:03] message. I really don't know. But I
[1:00:05] would be foolish to think that it's not
[1:00:07] going to happen again. And I want to
[1:00:09] prepare my heart not to be looking at
[1:00:11] who's going to turn from it or who's
[1:00:14] what's going to happen in the message.
[1:00:16] Who's the next pastor? Who's the next
[1:00:18] church that gets arrested or the police
[1:00:20] come? I I really don't I really want to
[1:00:23] bury myself in coming in line with the
[1:00:27] word of the Lord
[1:00:30] that has been given to me.
[1:00:32] Amen. And so this is the the
[1:00:36] maturity. Now Satan is there to block
[1:00:39] this maturity from happen happening.
[1:00:42] He's there to block this seed from
[1:00:44] coming to um its rightful place. And the
[1:00:48] message hidden life, brother Brandham
[1:00:50] says this here. He says, "Now we've held
[1:00:52] this ground so long. I believe with all
[1:00:54] my heart that we're on the threshold of
[1:00:57] stepping into another veil yonder
[1:01:01] somewhere to where the greater mysteries
[1:01:03] of God will be known to the church. And
[1:01:06] me for one, I've got both ears and eyes
[1:01:10] and heart open to hear the message when
[1:01:13] it comes. examine it for Satan will put
[1:01:17] out many a false runner. But I just lay
[1:01:21] it aside. Remember, it's only signifying
[1:01:24] that something real is going to take
[1:01:27] place when you see it. For Satan will do
[1:01:30] everything, as I said last night, to
[1:01:33] blockade the real jewel of God. When
[1:01:36] it's coming forth, you'll hear it. He
[1:01:40] put a blockade to catch Abel. He put one
[1:01:42] to catch Joseph. He wanted to catch
[1:01:44] Jesus and so forth. He will do it. Want
[1:01:47] to get Moses? For you can notice those
[1:01:50] things that Satan will try to block it.
[1:01:56] In the message, what heest thou? Elijah
[1:01:58] the prophet of God says this paragraph
[1:02:02] 12 1959. He says, "It goes to show that
[1:02:05] when God's doing something, Satan is
[1:02:08] always present to block it or to tear it
[1:02:12] down or do what he can to interrupt it.
[1:02:18] So your adversary is trying to interrupt
[1:02:21] the move of God in your life.
[1:02:24] The Holy Spirit is trying to move you
[1:02:26] and place you, trying to grow you, but
[1:02:32] Satan is there to interrupt that. We are
[1:02:34] aware of that, aren't we? We know we
[1:02:36] have a real enemy. He's after us, and he
[1:02:40] doesn't take any days off. We seem to,
[1:02:44] but he does not. and he studies us and
[1:02:48] watches after us to prevent the present
[1:02:52] truth of the word from happening in your
[1:02:55] life in a greater measure. So we must be
[1:02:58] diligent. Amen.
[1:03:00] We must be on guard, on point. We don't
[1:03:03] know when our last sermon, when our last
[1:03:06] service, when our last time to manifest
[1:03:10] this word will be. We really don't. And
[1:03:13] tomorrow's a new day, a day we've never
[1:03:15] seen before. But God has given us the
[1:03:18] tools to handle the enemy in the day
[1:03:21] that we're living in. Do you believe
[1:03:24] that?
[1:03:26] Yes. This is a tremendous hour. I I know
[1:03:29] that you know uh um just I mean uh just
[1:03:34] the depth of what's going on in the
[1:03:37] realms of the spirit
[1:03:40] in dark places and the things that are
[1:03:43] taking place behind the scenes. the
[1:03:45] things that I mean I don't follow the
[1:03:47] news very much. I really don't. But I
[1:03:50] know that there's the crimes and the
[1:03:52] things that's going on. That's one
[1:03:53] thing. But I know in the realm of the
[1:03:55] spirit, Satan is masterminding a great
[1:04:00] falling away, the great apostasy.
[1:04:04] And we see the individual when they fall
[1:04:08] away, but they probably have already
[1:04:12] fallen maybe years before. Maybe they
[1:04:15] don't believe even now and just waiting
[1:04:17] for the opportunity to fall. And so we
[1:04:19] want to be ready, don't we? We want to
[1:04:22] be uh stabilized. Amen. Everything that
[1:04:26] can be shook will be shaken.
[1:04:31] And think of that. The prophet of God
[1:04:34] says, "The hour is come." He says this
[1:04:36] in the message, "The hour has come."
[1:04:38] 1951. Don't worry. If you accept him
[1:04:41] tonight as your healer, Satan will put
[1:04:44] the heat on you tomorrow. Don't you
[1:04:47] worry about that. Yes, sir. How many's
[1:04:51] here has been sick?
[1:04:54] And then you go to claim your healing.
[1:04:57] When you claim your healing, you know
[1:04:58] that Satan is after you to stop you to
[1:05:03] not make it so easy for you. It's a
[1:05:05] fight, isn't it?
[1:05:07] Yes, it is a fight. But greater is he
[1:05:10] that is in us. It's it's a fight that we
[1:05:13] don't want to give up on. I mean, I'm
[1:05:15] not going to just give up and say my
[1:05:17] life is in the medical
[1:05:20] um community.
[1:05:23] My life is in the doctor's hands. I'm
[1:05:26] not going to give up and my life is in
[1:05:28] this version of healthc care. No, I'm a
[1:05:31] believer in the word of God.
[1:05:33] We're the true church of the living God
[1:05:35] and he's given us power over all unclean
[1:05:39] spirits.
[1:05:41] Did he?
[1:05:42] Yes, he did. That's our place. That's
[1:05:44] our position. And we have to fight for
[1:05:46] it. Remember the message this morning?
[1:05:49] Putting that seed in the wrong place can
[1:05:52] have the wrong results. Israel was down
[1:05:54] in Egypt. They never flourished until
[1:05:56] they came out into the promised land.
[1:05:59] And then they flourish when God put them
[1:06:02] planting the vine and putting it in the
[1:06:04] right place. Then it will flourish when
[1:06:07] it's put in its right place. And there's
[1:06:10] many people that are gifted and talented
[1:06:13] sitting in some church pew somewhere,
[1:06:16] maybe sitting right here tonight, and
[1:06:18] never manifest the gifts and qualities
[1:06:21] in their life. Because if they're in a
[1:06:24] church that doesn't believe in it, um if
[1:06:27] they're in an atmosphere that doesn't
[1:06:29] receive it, doesn't make it convenient,
[1:06:31] doesn't teach it, doesn't foster it, it
[1:06:34] will set there and you wouldn't know the
[1:06:36] gifts and qualities that are laying
[1:06:39] right in a small group of people like
[1:06:41] this or many or any other group. And so
[1:06:44] the you know so so um
[1:06:48] God has um as I said God has gifts and
[1:06:52] talents that are laying in the body of
[1:06:54] Christ.
[1:06:56] But if that if that individual is in a
[1:06:59] group that is hostile or the environment
[1:07:03] is very hard
[1:07:05] then it really isn't going to u mature
[1:07:08] properly and you're like a young person
[1:07:11] getting up to sing for the very first
[1:07:13] time
[1:07:15] struggling with nerves and everything
[1:07:17] get up to sing for the very first time
[1:07:19] and they go up to sing and all of the
[1:07:20] people looking at him or her it just no
[1:07:24] encouragement no you know, like judging,
[1:07:28] judging, judging. And that's all that
[1:07:31] poor little soul sees. I I I don't blame
[1:07:34] them not wanting to sing because they
[1:07:37] got to sing. You didn't help them. You
[1:07:38] just looked at them.
[1:07:40] And that's what many of us do sometimes,
[1:07:44] but we want to help and foster. We want
[1:07:46] to encourage after you're converted,
[1:07:48] Peter, do what to your brethren?
[1:07:51] Strengthen your brethren.
[1:07:53] We want to encourage that. Some of y'all
[1:07:56] can sing because you're singing
[1:07:59] in the shower all the time, but you come
[1:08:02] to church. We don't know what you sound
[1:08:05] like cuz you won't do it here. But we're
[1:08:09] praying for you. Amen.
[1:08:12] Somebody said, "Brother Israel, I
[1:08:13] enjoyed that song you sang during the uh
[1:08:16] during the singing. We should sing like
[1:08:17] that more."
[1:08:19] I would love to if Well, I'm not going
[1:08:22] to say that. So,
[1:08:26] the atmosphere means a lot, right? I
[1:08:30] sing all the time. Don't Don't do Don't
[1:08:32] get me, Chris. Chris going to get me.
[1:08:34] Like, I sing all the time in my truck. I
[1:08:37] make up songs all the time. I think I
[1:08:39] compose one or two little songs. I have
[1:08:41] them. And these little hymns, these
[1:08:43] little songs, these little runs that I
[1:08:45] do all the time.
[1:08:47] Lord, help me.
[1:08:48] Amen.
[1:08:50] Chris said, "Yes." So Chris, you can do
[1:08:52] that because Chris does sing. So, but
[1:08:54] we're talking about the seed coming to
[1:08:56] maturity and then the hostile
[1:08:58] environment.
[1:08:59] I believe that the church ought to be
[1:09:03] like if there is one place you ought to
[1:09:06] feel at home ought to be in the house of
[1:09:08] the Lord
[1:09:10] where you can come in and feel the
[1:09:12] precious Holy Spirit
[1:09:15] and then you can lift your hands and
[1:09:17] praise him without feeling judged
[1:09:22] or out of place.
[1:09:24] How many Christians come to church and
[1:09:26] they don't really worship because they
[1:09:28] feel out of place?
[1:09:30] Well, that shouldn't be this church.
[1:09:32] That's right. This should there should
[1:09:34] be an atmosphere here where a sinner
[1:09:36] just slides right into his presence
[1:09:41] where they don't dictate our atmosphere,
[1:09:44] but our atmosphere will dictate to them
[1:09:48] that they'll know that these people are
[1:09:51] worshiping an almighty God.
[1:09:54] That's what the song service is all
[1:09:56] about. Every service you're not going to
[1:09:58] feel that instant anointing, but we do
[1:10:00] offer the sacrifice of praise. And what
[1:10:04] are we doing? We're changing the
[1:10:06] atmosphere. Why? Because the word is
[1:10:09] going to be preached. And when the word
[1:10:11] is preached, we want that word preached
[1:10:13] on good soil.
[1:10:16] The worship service is working the soil.
[1:10:20] So when the word is preached, it falls
[1:10:23] into a mature atmosphere.
[1:10:26] something that it can grow in, something
[1:10:29] that it's connected to, something that
[1:10:31] would cause it to produce fruit, and
[1:10:34] that that fruit would remain even. You
[1:10:38] know, this is our our test. This is our
[1:10:41] challenge. And we know that Satan is
[1:10:43] there to hinder that. He wants to hinder
[1:10:46] the service, hinder the preaching,
[1:10:48] hinder the work of the Lord, hinder what
[1:10:50] you're hearing. He's there to do that.
[1:10:53] And I am convinced that there are some
[1:10:58] services that we miss because Satan has
[1:11:02] done just that. He's distracted us. He's
[1:11:07] hindered the service
[1:11:09] by some uh a conversation or something
[1:11:13] going on outside. But we want the Holy
[1:11:16] Spirit, we want the seed of God to find
[1:11:19] itself in the good ground. Amen.
[1:11:24] That's our desire. Now,
[1:11:27] as I just wrap this message up uh for
[1:11:32] the evening service. I there's so much
[1:11:34] more I can go into there. There is a
[1:11:36] portion in second Peter
[1:11:40] chapter 2 that I must bring as I believe
[1:11:43] the Holy Spirit had put it on my heart
[1:11:46] the other day. And I didn't go into it
[1:11:48] this morning on purpose
[1:11:50] and I thought I would leave off of it
[1:11:52] tonight, but I I have to just lay this
[1:11:55] part and I believe this is a good place
[1:11:57] to put it being that it's a communion
[1:11:59] service. Second Peter chapter 2:es 1-2.
[1:12:05] This, my brothers and sister, is an
[1:12:08] example of this Mark chapter 4 parable
[1:12:14] in that everyone
[1:12:17] in this warning had heard the word
[1:12:22] and the finality of it, you know, it
[1:12:25] goes into um how they secretly bring in
[1:12:30] these heresies and how many will follow
[1:12:33] them And it it says a number of places
[1:12:36] that they speak they speak against the
[1:12:39] truth. They speak against uh dignities.
[1:12:42] They they they have great swelling words
[1:12:44] and so forth. But look at the last
[1:12:46] couple of verses there verses 20 and it
[1:12:50] says let's take verse number 18. And I
[1:12:53] believe this places us who we are.
[1:12:57] For when they speak great swelling words
[1:12:59] of vanity, they allure through the lust
[1:13:01] of the flesh, through much wantingness.
[1:13:06] Those that were clean escape from them
[1:13:12] who live in error. While they promised
[1:13:14] him liberty, they themselves are the
[1:13:16] servants of corruption. For of whom a
[1:13:19] man is overcome of the same as he
[1:13:21] brought in bondage.
[1:13:23] For if after they have escaped the
[1:13:26] pollution of the world through the
[1:13:28] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ, they are again entangled therein
[1:13:32] and overcome, the latter end is worse
[1:13:36] with them than the beginning.
[1:13:41] For it had been better for them not to
[1:13:46] have known the way of righteousness
[1:13:50] than after they have known it to turn
[1:13:53] from the holy commandment delivered unto
[1:13:55] them. Now brothers and sisters, this is
[1:13:59] where we are today. This is our message.
[1:14:04] This is the we're seeing the
[1:14:06] manifestation of that take place even
[1:14:09] today.
[1:14:11] And at the beginning of the chapter, it
[1:14:14] talks about the false prophets and the
[1:14:18] the false teachers that are among you.
[1:14:21] And they'll secretly bring in these
[1:14:23] heresies or these false teachings. And
[1:14:26] there there is there is for the
[1:14:28] believer, I'll say this, for the
[1:14:29] believer, you need to be able to
[1:14:32] overcome the world.
[1:14:34] You'll need to be able to overcome the
[1:14:37] sin of the day in the world. And you as
[1:14:40] a believer, you will at one time or the
[1:14:44] other hear false doctrine,
[1:14:49] false teaching. You as a believer will
[1:14:54] come in contact with it. It is the one
[1:14:58] of the great warnings that are laid out
[1:15:00] to us. And in second Peter chapter 2,
[1:15:04] this is the groups of people that have
[1:15:07] heard the word. These are not the
[1:15:10] sinners. These are not those that are um
[1:15:13] in the other saved categories. The
[1:15:16] foolish virgin. These are those that
[1:15:18] have heard the word. And some of this
[1:15:21] might be foolish virgin or or or or or
[1:15:24] just an unbelieving seed. But but all of
[1:15:27] these have heard the word and then they
[1:15:30] have turned from it. And so in Mark
[1:15:35] chapter 4, they all heard the word. But
[1:15:39] for us, let's get it again in verse
[1:15:42] number 18. And it says, "Those that were
[1:15:46] clean escaped from them?" Escaped from
[1:15:50] what? Escaped from the false teaching
[1:15:55] of the day.
[1:15:58] Those that were clean.
[1:16:01] Oh God, help us. Lord, be with us. This
[1:16:05] is our great challenge. This is our
[1:16:08] desire as we mature in Christ. Now, the
[1:16:13] word comes in many forms. The word is
[1:16:16] vast. There's many portions of the word.
[1:16:19] And I I want every seed of the word that
[1:16:22] I hear to come to maturity.
[1:16:26] Not just this part. I want every single
[1:16:28] seed that I hear. Let's look at it like
[1:16:32] that. Let's move in it. Like every truth
[1:16:36] that is brought, I want it to go down
[1:16:40] deep into the good ground of my spirit,
[1:16:44] down into the good ground of my heart
[1:16:47] and let it produce
[1:16:49] after its own kind. I don't want it to
[1:16:52] fall by the wayside. I don't want a
[1:16:55] truth to fall on stony ground. I don't
[1:16:58] want a truth, a quotation of the prophet
[1:17:01] to get caught up among the thorns. But I
[1:17:05] want every quote, every scripture, every
[1:17:08] truth of God to come down and find its
[1:17:12] resting place in good ground so that it
[1:17:15] can produce 30, 60, and 100fold.
[1:17:19] This second Peter chapter 2
[1:17:23] says, "If God spare not the angels that
[1:17:26] sin, but cast them down to hell, deliver
[1:17:29] them into chains of darkness to be
[1:17:30] reserved unto judgment. Spare not the
[1:17:34] old world." Verse 5. Verse six, he
[1:17:36] turned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:17:39] into ashes to condemn them with the
[1:17:41] overflow, making them an example unto
[1:17:44] those that should live ungodly. and
[1:17:47] deliver just lot vexed with the filthy
[1:17:51] conversation of the wicked. That
[1:17:53] righteous man dwelling among them in
[1:17:56] seeing and hearing vex his righteous
[1:17:58] soul from day to day with their unlawful
[1:18:02] deeds. The Lord knoweth how to deliver
[1:18:07] the godly out of temptation,
[1:18:10] and to reserve the unjust unto the day
[1:18:13] of judgment to be punished.
[1:18:18] Chiefly them that walk after the flesh
[1:18:20] in the l lust of uncleanness and despise
[1:18:23] government. Presumptuous are they
[1:18:24] self-will. They are not afraid to speak
[1:18:28] evil of dignities. You'll see this more
[1:18:32] and more. You'll see this
[1:18:35] disrespect, disregard
[1:18:38] for the things that are righteous and
[1:18:41] things that are holy. And let me say
[1:18:44] this. If if I'm in association with
[1:18:51] a fellowship or a friend or a person
[1:18:55] that has turned from this holy
[1:18:58] commandment, then you you have to be
[1:19:01] very careful with that with that
[1:19:03] fellowship.
[1:19:04] You have to heed the warning of what is
[1:19:09] taking place because with that darkness
[1:19:12] and with that fellowship they are that
[1:19:15] that influence will have its effect upon
[1:19:19] you and your faith. And we're seeing
[1:19:22] that more and more and more.
[1:19:27] Jesus said it would be here. The Apostle
[1:19:29] Paul tells us it'll be here. And all the
[1:19:32] scriptures warn us of this. Look at the
[1:19:35] great turn against just this picture
[1:19:39] alone. As we were I was in the um the
[1:19:43] study and I I had this from brother
[1:19:46] Gordon Lindsay before one of the
[1:19:48] messages there. he had
[1:19:52] uh introduced brother Brandham and he's
[1:19:54] talking about when that picture was
[1:19:56] first uh formed
[1:20:00] and
[1:20:02] um what message was that says that I I
[1:20:05] gave it to you I think
[1:20:07] I didn't bring it this time I don't
[1:20:09] think I have it under under that picture
[1:20:11] I need the guy to get to it tonight but
[1:20:14] it's worth listening to here's Gordon
[1:20:17] Lindsay's testimony Gordon
[1:20:19] Uh um um Grace to the Nations or what
[1:20:22] that great organization he started. They
[1:20:24] changed the name to this the name that
[1:20:26] it is now. Work with brother Brandham.
[1:20:28] The voice of healing magazine.
[1:20:30] Tremendous resume as a minister. How God
[1:20:33] called him and called him to work with
[1:20:35] brother Brandham with the Brandom
[1:20:36] campaigns and others. Here he is
[1:20:39] introducing
[1:20:41] uh brother Brandham. And he he takes a
[1:20:44] few moments. We have time to play that
[1:20:46] just real quick. Let's play that just if
[1:20:49] you have it, sis.
[1:20:52] And
[1:20:53] yes,
[1:20:54] 85 to A 100. From A85 to A 100, stand in
[1:20:59] line to my right of the platform and
[1:21:02] your left. Everyone else remains here,
[1:21:04] please.
[1:21:10] While the prayer line is forming,
[1:21:14] I want to show you this picture that we
[1:21:16] happen to get a hold of just now when
[1:21:18] that brother Brandham was talking about
[1:21:21] which shows the supernatural light over
[1:21:24] his head.
[1:21:26] As soon as that picture was taken, I
[1:21:30] made arrangements to have the negative
[1:21:32] taken to
[1:21:35] the examiner of question documents.
[1:21:39] uh Mr. George Lacy of Houston, Texas.
[1:21:44] And I asked him, I said, "You have all
[1:21:47] the means of science at your command.
[1:21:50] Can you tell me if there's any fake
[1:21:52] about that uh particular negative? Can
[1:21:57] you tell if there's a superimposure?
[1:22:00] Can you tell if there's been a double
[1:22:03] exposure? Can you tell if the film has
[1:22:05] been doctorred with in any way?" He says
[1:22:08] absolutely I can. So he took it cost us
[1:22:12] a considerable sum because he was a
[1:22:14] scientist engaged in that work and
[1:22:18] examined it many hours in his laboratory
[1:22:22] and then with his own name signed
[1:22:25] underneath it he declared that the
[1:22:28] negative was absolutely
[1:22:31] absolutely positively genuine. May I
[1:22:34] just add this word? The picture was
[1:22:36] taken by a hostile photographer,
[1:22:39] one that had spoken against the meeting.
[1:22:42] In fact, the statement even got in the
[1:22:44] newspaper and he was as surprised as
[1:22:48] anyone.
[1:22:49] There were Jews,
[1:22:51] Orthodox Jews.
[1:22:53] And so I regard this merely as a
[1:22:56] verification and confirmation.
[1:23:00] And brother Brandham regards it not that
[1:23:03] he is supernatural in any way. for a
[1:23:06] verification of his ministry and message
[1:23:10] of bringing divine healing to the people
[1:23:13] of the world. Friends, I believe the
[1:23:16] Bible is true.
[1:23:18] And so tonight, as brother Brandham
[1:23:20] Ministries, may we all be in the spirit
[1:23:23] of God and realize that the supernatural
[1:23:26] is here tonight to deliver people, not
[1:23:29] only heal them, but to heal their souls.
[1:23:32] Bring men and women to Jesus Christ.
[1:23:35] Balancing that chorus only.
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:50] That's right. There's a background on
[1:23:52] that sister. If you'll do that, I
[1:23:53] appreciate it. Now, everyone be
[1:23:55] reverend. And I may I say this now as I
[1:23:59] make this statement. I am not
[1:24:02] responsible
[1:24:03] around these meetings. I trust the
[1:24:06] people on the outside will hear this
[1:24:08] also.
[1:24:11] I'm not a fanatic friend.
[1:24:14] If I die tonight, what I have said is
[1:24:17] testified as truth.
[1:24:20] That picture seals with
[1:24:23] God vindicating it. I told it see it
[1:24:26] isn't me. It's him. Did you see it? Can
[1:24:29] all of you see it? Good.
[1:24:32] We'll have it back on the book table if
[1:24:34] you will, brother Lindsay, so they can
[1:24:36] look at it.
[1:24:38] And we'll see about getting instant
[1:24:40] copies of it.
[1:24:43] A lady in the hospital recently had one
[1:24:45] sitting on her desk. She was looking at
[1:24:46] it, not at me, but the angel of the Lord
[1:24:50] in this form of a halo. And she said the
[1:24:54] picture begin to mill come right out and
[1:24:56] hung over her. She got up and went home.
[1:24:59] Well, so it was a it was it's not it's
[1:25:03] him
[1:25:05] only stating facts and truth. Now I
[1:25:13] Amen. How many can say amen to that?
[1:25:16] So that picture it identifies us who we
[1:25:20] are and we know that there's a great
[1:25:22] misunderstanding with it. But the
[1:25:25] warning is um the warning is this is
[1:25:30] what God sent in this day in this hour.
[1:25:33] Is that right? And so I this is how we
[1:25:37] stand. We stand with that. And anybody
[1:25:42] that doesn't understand it, that's one
[1:25:43] thing. I have lots of grace for people
[1:25:46] who don't understand that can't walk
[1:25:48] what I'm walking into. I totally get
[1:25:50] that. I totally understand that. But
[1:25:52] someone who was in it and they turn from
[1:25:54] it
[1:25:57] and then they want to sit and and talk
[1:25:59] to me and negative negative negative on
[1:26:02] the prophet. I don't have time for that
[1:26:05] and I warn you not to have any time for
[1:26:08] it either.
[1:26:10] Because you have to examine what is
[1:26:12] taking place here. What you need to do.
[1:26:15] I I would say this. This is what I as I
[1:26:17] was thinking about this because I'm not
[1:26:20] here to tell you who to fellowship with.
[1:26:22] who not to. But I would say this. If you
[1:26:25] can go before the Lord in prayer, you as
[1:26:27] a Christian and knowing that God called
[1:26:30] you to follow this message, and if the
[1:26:32] Holy Spirit gives you the okay to sit in
[1:26:36] fellowship with people that have turned
[1:26:39] from this way and it's okay for you to
[1:26:42] do that, then I'd say go ahead and do
[1:26:44] it. But I'd say you pray about that.
[1:26:48] I am very firmly warned against that
[1:26:52] because I know what's going on. I know
[1:26:54] what's to take place. The next thing is
[1:26:56] they prove this and then they prove this
[1:26:58] and they go online and they prove this
[1:27:00] and they get you off on the grounds of
[1:27:02] knowledge and proving God when you can
[1:27:05] never prove God by knowledge.
[1:27:08] It's by revelation.
[1:27:09] The reason I'm here today is because God
[1:27:12] revealed his will to me. That's why I
[1:27:16] stand the way I stand. I didn't go to
[1:27:18] Hebrew. I didn't learn Hebrew. I didn't
[1:27:20] learn Greek. I don't know Latin. Barely
[1:27:22] know English. I do not know church
[1:27:24] history. I am not a scholar. And so
[1:27:27] that's not the stand that I'm standing
[1:27:29] on. So I'm not going to stand out as an
[1:27:31] apologist to argue with this man who
[1:27:34] doesn't believe that these things are
[1:27:36] true and go back and forth and back and
[1:27:38] forth and back and forth. No, no, no,
[1:27:40] no. God had revealed this to me that
[1:27:44] this is the truth.
[1:27:46] Can I get a witness?
[1:27:48] And because of that, this is where we
[1:27:50] stand. So we have the picture up there.
[1:27:53] It will remain there. We play Brother
[1:27:54] Van's tapes. We will continue. And when
[1:27:57] I stop playing them, you pray for me.
[1:28:01] And if if you're not listening to them
[1:28:03] in church,
[1:28:04] are you listening to them at home?
[1:28:06] Yes, sir.
[1:28:07] And God sent us the greatest message
[1:28:09] that could be found. Amen.
[1:28:11] And you and I need a revelation of what
[1:28:16] came down in this generation.
[1:28:20] I know people can abuse that and there's
[1:28:22] people that run off and they go off the
[1:28:24] word and they don't have the scriptures
[1:28:26] and they bow down and worship and they
[1:28:28] follow whatever they want to follow.
[1:28:29] That's not my I'm not, you know, that's
[1:28:32] not that's going to be here. That's
[1:28:33] always here. That's all throughout your
[1:28:35] Bible. But you are going to give an
[1:28:37] account for st coming in contact with
[1:28:40] this word and the enemy wants you to
[1:28:42] turn from that.
[1:28:45] That's the warning to you tonight. Stay
[1:28:47] faithful saints. The the the the the
[1:28:50] word of the Lord is wanting to find its
[1:28:53] resting ground in good good soil. I
[1:28:57] don't know how that tied into the
[1:28:59] message tonight, but that that there it
[1:29:01] is. All right. So, God bless you so
[1:29:03] much. Let's take
[1:29:06] our Bibles and turn into
[1:29:09] for the communion service.
[1:29:19] I was looking through my some photos and
[1:29:22] there was a wedding. I think it was Will
[1:29:24] Alifont's wedding actually and had a
[1:29:27] picture there with brother Amalong.
[1:29:29] And I forgot to mention him, I think, as
[1:29:31] one of the elders that has gone on and
[1:29:34] stood before us. And it was so nice to
[1:29:36] see him. And as I started to replay over
[1:29:40] my life, Brother John, here in this
[1:29:42] city, I look at all the ministries and
[1:29:45] pastors in this city that stand for this
[1:29:48] message. I don't agree with them all. I
[1:29:50] don't understand them all, but I have a
[1:29:52] respect for them. And you're not going
[1:29:54] to hear me come from the pull pit and
[1:29:56] start bashing a pastor because I
[1:30:00] disagree with this or that. It'd be
[1:30:02] better for you just don't say anything.
[1:30:05] Is that right, saints?
[1:30:07] You know, they did this, they hurt me,
[1:30:08] and this and that. The last church I was
[1:30:10] in or the last group they did. And some
[1:30:13] of you have been around this city for a
[1:30:15] long time, right? You've come across
[1:30:18] some things, right?
[1:30:20] But you know what? You know what? God
[1:30:23] never gives you the right to go to start
[1:30:25] speaking against dignities and pastors
[1:30:28] and elders and ministers. It's better
[1:30:31] for you to don't say anything than to
[1:30:35] engage with a group of people that are
[1:30:38] negative and then wants to fight and
[1:30:40] talk crazy against this one, against,
[1:30:43] you know, brother whoever, brother
[1:30:45] Green, Brother Cues, but whoever the
[1:30:47] pastor is. That's that spirit that wants
[1:30:49] to come against that and they want you
[1:30:51] want you to be involved in that. I tell
[1:30:53] you I tell you right now that God God is
[1:30:56] not pleased with that. I don't care.
[1:30:58] They might be wrong. They might have
[1:31:00] done things wrong, no question, made
[1:31:01] mistakes, whatever. But you keep keep
[1:31:05] keep your mouth from speaking against
[1:31:07] these people, these brothers. They
[1:31:09] they're going to have their place and um
[1:31:13] and um they they'll all have to give an
[1:31:16] account. Um but that's because it's so
[1:31:21] easy for us to get into that. I'm not I
[1:31:23] don't I don't want to be interested in
[1:31:24] that. Amen. So, let's all stand to our
[1:31:27] feet. God bless you.
[1:31:29] 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:31:56] 1 Corinthians 11 verse 23. For I have
[1:32:01] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:32:04] delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus
[1:32:07] the same night in which he was betrayed,
[1:32:09] he took bread, and when he had given
[1:32:12] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:32:14] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:32:17] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:32:21] After the same manner also he took the
[1:32:24] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[1:32:25] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:32:29] This do ye as of as you drink it in
[1:32:32] remembrance of me. For often as you
[1:32:35] drink this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:32:37] to show the Lord's death till he come.
[1:32:43] Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:32:45] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:32:47] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:32:50] and blood of the Lord, but let a man
[1:32:53] examine who?
[1:32:55] Himself. And so let him eat of that
[1:32:58] bread and drink of that cup. Let me stop
[1:33:00] here because this is just in my spirit
[1:33:02] right now. I have to say this. Um I was
[1:33:05] talking with a brother. There's another
[1:33:06] minister, good friend of mine, and he
[1:33:10] brought up another pastor from this
[1:33:13] city, and he said about that pastor, he
[1:33:16] said, "Oh, we know that he is in a cult
[1:33:21] or part of a cult."
[1:33:24] And it just didn't strike me just right.
[1:33:27] And I'm not friends with this other
[1:33:29] pastor, but I I asked him, I said,
[1:33:31] "Brother," I asked him just like that. I
[1:33:34] said, "Brother, have you ever met this
[1:33:36] brother?"
[1:33:38] He says, "No, I haven't. Brother Israel,
[1:33:40] have you ever been to his church?" "No,
[1:33:42] I haven't." So, so I said, I thought,
[1:33:46] "Well, I would be a little careful about
[1:33:49] saying somebody's in a cult that I had
[1:33:51] never met before.
[1:33:54] I think I think I would deserve I would
[1:33:58] want you to at least speak to me and
[1:34:01] then discern that on me and then make
[1:34:03] that judgment. But could you imagine me
[1:34:06] saying that about brother Tim or brother
[1:34:09] Sean? He's in and I never met him, never
[1:34:12] talked to him oneonone. Everything I'm
[1:34:15] saying about him is based on what other
[1:34:17] people have said. And this city is
[1:34:20] guilty of such. And that spirit is here
[1:34:23] in this city. And I live in the city.
[1:34:25] And that spirit wants to get on me. Let
[1:34:27] me say this to you too. You young
[1:34:29] people, you young little ones, you don't
[1:34:31] don't get involved with speaking against
[1:34:33] pastors, preachers, and people that are
[1:34:35] in the spirit or other churches or other
[1:34:37] groups. My teaching to you is that you
[1:34:40] respect all of those people.
[1:34:42] You don't understand it.
[1:34:45] Just
[1:34:47] move away from it.
[1:34:49] Don't get involved in bashing another
[1:34:51] group and what they said and all. Don't
[1:34:53] get involved in that. You're in the
[1:34:54] fellowship and they're doing it. Don't
[1:34:56] you get involved. If you're a teenager
[1:34:58] and you know better, you're the age of
[1:35:00] accountability. Don't get involved with
[1:35:03] speaking against pastors, ministers,
[1:35:06] other groups, other people that's trying
[1:35:08] to serve the Lord that people that you
[1:35:10] don't even know. Please, please.
[1:35:14] Okay? That's true.
[1:35:16] Because I had to the Lord had to deal
[1:35:18] with me on that. So, I don't want to.
[1:35:21] The elders are gone. Many of them are
[1:35:23] gone. And um I'm not going to stand here
[1:35:26] and point out where they missed it or
[1:35:28] where they were wrong.
[1:35:31] Please.
[1:35:32] When it's time for us to leave, we're
[1:35:35] going to want some grace over us, too.
[1:35:38] Is that right? Yes,
[1:35:40] that's of course we if we're if we're
[1:35:43] all perfect and we never made a mistake,
[1:35:46] then of course we wouldn't need that
[1:35:48] grace. But we know that some of us are
[1:35:51] making mistakes even right now
[1:35:54] and we need God's grace.
[1:35:56] Is that right or wrong?
[1:35:59] This city is guilty of that. It's an
[1:36:00] atmosphere. It's an anointing. And I'm
[1:36:02] saying that because I travel and people
[1:36:04] start telling and telling me what's
[1:36:06] going on in my city and wants to bas
[1:36:09] ministries in my city. I'm not getting a
[1:36:11] part of that. You don't even live here.
[1:36:14] You haven't never been to this brother's
[1:36:15] church and you're going to indict him of
[1:36:18] being a part of a cult. Come on, saints.
[1:36:21] The Lord has taught us better than that.
[1:36:24] That's a little reminder to you, right?
[1:36:26] So let a man examine himself. So let him
[1:36:29] eat of that bread and drink of that cup.
[1:36:31] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:36:32] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:36:35] damnation to himself, not discerning the
[1:36:39] Lord's body.
[1:36:41] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:36:43] among you, and many sleep. For we would
[1:36:45] judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:36:48] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:36:50] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:36:53] be condemned with the world. Wherefore
[1:36:56] my brethren, when you come together to
[1:36:58] eat, tar one for another. If any man
[1:37:02] hunger, let him eat at home, that you
[1:37:04] come not together unto condemnation, and
[1:37:06] the rest will I set in order when I
[1:37:09] come.
[1:37:14] Let us tar one for another. You pray for
[1:37:17] me, I'll pray for you in silent prayer
[1:37:20] as we prepare to come to the table of
[1:37:23] the Lord. Thank you.
[1:37:26] and bring those forward those elements.
[1:37:28] Thank you.
[1:37:49] In silent prayer, we pray for the Lord
[1:37:51] to forgive us of our sins. And then we
[1:37:53] pray for our brother and our sister. And
[1:37:56] we all pray one for another. Amen.
[1:38:22] Heavenly Father, in my hand I hold this
[1:38:25] bread that was made for this service.
[1:38:28] Lord, it's a type of your body that was
[1:38:30] broken for us. It's a type of the word
[1:38:34] that's being planted in this age. And
[1:38:37] Lord, when we partake of it, it shows
[1:38:40] that we believe all the word as your
[1:38:44] messenger taught us. It is not the body
[1:38:47] of Jesus Christ, but it represents
[1:38:50] his body. In this great sacrament that
[1:38:54] stood the test of time, Lord, coming out
[1:38:57] of Egypt, the Hebrews had a Passover.
[1:39:02] And when you saw the blood, you passed
[1:39:04] over them. It's a type of that great
[1:39:07] Exodus. And Lord Jesus, as we partake,
[1:39:10] let us remember of the lamb that was
[1:39:13] shed for our sins. And we partake of it,
[1:39:17] remembering as we have examined
[1:39:19] ourselves, Lord, in Jesus name. Bless
[1:39:22] this bread for that purpose. Amen.
[1:39:31] Lord Jesus, this is the cup of the New
[1:39:34] Testament of your blood. It is not your
[1:39:36] blood, but it represents your blood and
[1:39:39] we drink it, Lord, in faith, an
[1:39:43] ordinance left for the church.
[1:39:46] Oh, we don't fully understand it all,
[1:39:48] Lord, but it's kept the believers down
[1:39:51] through the ages. The apostle Paul
[1:39:53] instituted it and brought the meaning to
[1:39:56] what it means to partake.
[1:39:59] And oh God, how we know that when we
[1:40:02] partake, this is divine healing for us.
[1:40:06] It is the overcoming grace, strength for
[1:40:10] the journey lays in this little simple
[1:40:13] service in its humility. the world
[1:40:16] wouldn't understand it. But it's in the
[1:40:18] scriptures, Lord, that we would be
[1:40:23] strong and healthy and not a feeble one
[1:40:25] in our midst. Lord, let that be us
[1:40:28] tonight as we partake of it in faith,
[1:40:32] believing as you sanctify and bless the
[1:40:35] wine for this service in Jesus name.
[1:40:38] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated.
[1:40:41] Follow the directions of the ushers,
[1:40:43] please.

[1:51:22] and take our Bibles
[1:51:25] and turn into St. John
[1:51:31] chapter 13.
[1:51:51] And supper being ended, devil having now
[1:51:55] put into the heart of Judas's Scariot,
[1:51:57] Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus,
[1:52:00] knowing that the Father had given all
[1:52:02] things into his hands, and that he was
[1:52:04] come from God, and he went to God. He
[1:52:08] rised from supper. He laid aside his
[1:52:10] garments, and he took a towel and girded
[1:52:12] himself. After that he poured water into
[1:52:15] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:52:18] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:52:20] wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he
[1:52:23] to Simon Peter. Peter saith unto him,
[1:52:25] Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus
[1:52:28] answered and said unto him, What I do,
[1:52:30] thou knowest not now, but thou shalt
[1:52:33] know hereafter? Peter saith unto him,
[1:52:36] Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
[1:52:39] answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou
[1:52:42] hast no part with me." Simon Peter saith
[1:52:45] unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but
[1:52:47] also my hands and my head. And Jesus
[1:52:51] said to him, he that is washed needeth
[1:52:54] not saved to wash his feet, but is clean
[1:52:57] every wit. And ye are clean, but not
[1:53:00] all. For he knew who should betray him.
[1:53:03] Therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.
[1:53:06] So after he had washed their feet and
[1:53:09] they had taken his garments and was sat
[1:53:11] down again, he said unto them, "Know ye
[1:53:14] what I have done to you? You call me
[1:53:16] Master and Lord, and you say well, for
[1:53:19] so I am. If I then, your Lord and
[1:53:21] Master, have washed your feet, you also
[1:53:24] ought to wash one another's feet. For
[1:53:26] I've given you an example that ye should
[1:53:29] do as I have done to you.
[1:53:34] Verily, verily, I say unto you, the
[1:53:35] servant is not greater than his Lord,
[1:53:38] neither he that is sent, greater than he
[1:53:40] that sent him. If you know these things,
[1:53:42] happy are ye if you do them.
[1:53:46] It's so nice that the Lord got down on
[1:53:49] his knees and he washed everyone of his
[1:53:52] disciples feet.
[1:53:54] And we do that once a month. We go down
[1:53:57] and we wash
[1:53:59] and have communion. And I know um it
[1:54:04] doesn't save us and we don't have to do
[1:54:06] it every month. Brother Random did it
[1:54:08] every month in his tabernacle and we try
[1:54:12] to follow that. if we did it twice a
[1:54:15] year or four times a year. I think the
[1:54:18] main thing is that we do it and we
[1:54:20] believe in what we're doing. And it
[1:54:23] reminds us all that communion is a time
[1:54:25] of it's a um you you're at a um what did
[1:54:30] brother Adam call it? Uh huh.
[1:54:34] It's a showdown. Thank you. That's the
[1:54:36] word. It's a showdown for the believer.
[1:54:39] And so we need this showdown every now
[1:54:41] and then. And it's good to I mean you're
[1:54:44] all big and all mighty and then what'd
[1:54:47] you do Sunday night? Well, I washed
[1:54:49] somebody's feet.
[1:54:51] I washed my brother's feet. It's kind of
[1:54:54] hard to be proud and do that. And so
[1:54:56] Lord, help us. Our Lord Jesus did it and
[1:54:59] we follow his example. None of us are
[1:55:02] too big to to that we can't get down and
[1:55:05] wash one another's feet unless there
[1:55:07] were some physical reason. But we're
[1:55:10] glad to do it, aren't we? Amen.
[1:55:12] We're happy to do follow in our Lord's
[1:55:14] footsteps. So, God bless you. Let's sing
[1:55:15] that song. Um, what a day that one. No,
[1:55:20] maybe not that one. Let's see. Um,

[2:29:13] taken in a role as a trustee and so we

[2:29:17] God will bless him and sister Bethany as
[2:29:20] they serve the body of Christ. Amen. So
[2:29:23] we thank the Lord pray for the
[2:29:26] opportunity to serve you fine folks here
[2:29:31] in the city of Tucant. What a beautiful
[2:29:33] blessing it is to walk in this life with
[2:29:36] you all. And when we all get to heaven,
[2:29:41] what a day that's going to be.
[2:29:44] Oh my goodness.

[2:29:48] more.
[2:29:51] I'll be in the streets of glory. I'm not
[2:29:53] coming back here to fight this battle
[2:29:55] once again. It'll all be over, brother
[2:29:57] Chuck. Thank you, Jesus. We'll give him
[2:30:00] praise, all the glory, and all the
[2:30:02] honor. Throughout eternity, we will hail
[2:30:05] him. King of kings and lord of lords.
[2:30:10] He's the great and mighty one among us.
[2:30:13] He's the victorious one. All hell, King
[2:30:17] Jesus. Amen. So, God bless each of you.
[2:30:21] We're going to dismiss you just now. Ask
[2:30:24] the Lord will bless you each one. Was
[2:30:26] there anything other announcements you

[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:07] God bless you all. Let's go before the
[2:34:09] Lord in prayer today.
[2:34:12] Our dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[2:34:15] our Aba father, Lord, our alpha and
[2:34:19] omega Lord. It's been good to be in the
[2:34:21] house of the Lord tonight.
[2:34:23] Oh God, to feel your presence. What a
[2:34:26] valuable thing it is, Lord. It's worth
[2:34:28] more to us than gold, more to us than
[2:34:30] riches, more than fame.
[2:34:33] Oh God, how we crave it, Lord. And we
[2:34:36] know, Lord, it's not long now until
[2:34:38] you're coming. Lord, there's been a
[2:34:40] shout. There's been a trumpet. Lord,
[2:34:42] there's been all these things. And now,
[2:34:44] Lord, we're expecting your appearing.
[2:34:46] We're waiting for your appearing, Lord
[2:34:48] Jesus. Lord, until you take us to that
[2:34:51] place, Lord, where there's no more
[2:34:53] sickness, no more pain, Lord Jesus.
[2:34:57] Lord, where we can gather together,
[2:34:59] Lord, and spend a couple hundred years,
[2:35:01] Lord Jesus, and have a couple hundred
[2:35:04] years more,
[2:35:06] oh God, forever in your presence.
[2:35:09] Lord Jesus, our bodies made new, Lord.
[2:35:13] All the pain taken away, our loved ones
[2:35:16] seen again, Lord Jesus.
[2:35:19] Lord, that's the price that you paid.
[2:35:21] Lord, you've given us the earnest. Lord,
[2:35:24] it's here. Lord Jesus.
[2:35:26] Lord, it's as sure as anything it'll
[2:35:29] happen. Lord God, we thank you and
[2:35:31] praise you, Lord, for our sister Lorie
[2:35:34] Snow. Lord Jesus, oh God, for taking
[2:35:37] care of her, bringing her home, Lord.
[2:35:40] Thank you, Lord, for this church, Lord,
[2:35:42] this little local body. Oh God, a cleft
[2:35:45] in the rock, Lord, until the storm is
[2:35:47] passed. I just pray Lord Jesus you would
[2:35:50] be with each one as we go from this
[2:35:52] place Lord. Oh God watch over us Lord
[2:35:56] like the Bible says as the apple of your
[2:35:58] eye Lord Jesus. Each one precious in
[2:36:01] your sight.
[2:36:02] Oh God I pray that you would bring us
[2:36:05] back again Lord at the appointed time
[2:36:07] Lord but never from your presence Lord
[2:36:09] Jesus. We thank you and praise you Lord.
[2:36:12] We can't praise you enough oh God.
[2:36:15] Lord, thank you for everything you've
[2:36:17] done for us, the gifts, Lord, you've
[2:36:19] given us. We pray these things tonight
[2:36:21] in the wonderful, lovely name of the
[2:36:23] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:36:26] [Music]
[2:36:28] Amen. God bless you, saints. God be with
[2:36:30] you. You're dismissed. God bless you.
[2:36:33] I'm going to pray
[2:36:36] [Music]
[2:36:43] ever more
[2:36:49] within
[2:36:51] [Music]
[2:36:59] Jesus.
