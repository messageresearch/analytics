[22:26] even know where we're going
[22:29] amen Well's good to be here tonight I am
[22:33] you can be seated for a moment if you'd
[22:36] like I was going to mention it Sunday
[22:38] morning when I uh Sunday evening when I
[22:40] came and opened in prayer that I do in
[22:42] fact still go to church here ain't been
[22:45] there in a couple weeks just trying to
[22:46] been follow the Lord's leading you know
[22:49] spread the word spread the good news
[22:52] that's what we're trying to do who knows
[22:53] that the word of God it's a seed that's
[22:55] what the prophet told us he said it's a
[22:57] seed that goes out and the seed
[22:59] it has to it has to go in the right
[23:01] conditions it has to go in the right
[23:02] atmosphere it's got to be planted in
[23:04] good ground he says in the message of
[23:07] queen of shebe says the word of God
[23:09] right here is a seed that a sewer SWS
[23:11] and every seed will produce its kind he
[23:15] said if it's put in the right
[23:16] atmospheres and the right condition he
[23:18] said you can't hide it you can't hide
[23:21] genuine life and it this feels like the
[23:25] right
[23:26] atmosphere this feels like the right
[23:28] condition it feels like the word of God
[23:30] can come forth tonight and that it can
[23:33] go into some good
[23:34] ground that's what it feels like and
[23:37] we're as a Believer we're we're
[23:39] responsible for providing a right
[23:41] condition we are responsible when you've
[23:43] heard this word for creating an
[23:45] atmosphere that the spirit of God can
[23:47] feel comfortable moving
[23:49] in how how is he going to walk these
[23:51] aisles if we cannot create the right
[23:53] atmosphere then to if we're not coming
[23:55] in in the right
[23:56] atmosphere he's not going to move that
[24:00] that Heavenly Dove it's not going to
[24:01] come down on a lamb that's sitting
[24:04] here and if we could just stand we'll
[24:06] turn to that scripture right there
[24:07] Matthew 3 veres 13-1 17
[24:30] uh three Matthew 3: 13-1
[24:40] 17 verse 13 says then cometh Jesus from
[24:44] galile to Jordan unto John to be
[24:46] baptized of him he said but John forbade
[24:49] him saying I have need to be baptized of
[24:51] thee and cometh thou to me he said and
[24:54] Jesus answered said unto him suffer it
[24:56] to be so now for thus it becometh us to
[24:59] fulfill all
[25:01] righteousness he said then he suffered
[25:03] him and Jesus when he was baptized went
[25:05] up straight way out of the water and lo
[25:08] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[25:11] saw the spirit of God descending like a
[25:13] dove and liting upon him and that's that
[25:16] that happened for Jesus and that's just
[25:18] the same for a Believer the heavens when
[25:21] you have been baptized when you give
[25:22] your life to Christ when you are you
[25:24] have a heart of repentance the heavens
[25:27] are open to a believer any any
[25:29] Redemptive blessing that he died for
[25:31] whatever it may be they open to the
[25:34] believer and that Dove that spirit of
[25:37] God it looks to come upon a Believer any
[25:40] chance it can but we got to be in the
[25:42] right condition for that to happen we
[25:44] have to walk with the right atmosphere
[25:46] around us for those things to
[25:48] happen says in low a voice from Heaven
[25:51] saying this is my beloved Son in whom I
[25:54] am well pleased amen may the Lord add
[25:57] the blessings to the reading of his word
[25:58] you may be seated and the title tonight
[26:00] is getting in Lamb condition and the the
[26:06] scripture it's it's from the message the
[26:08] church and its condition and the prophet
[26:10] when he's when he's going over this
[26:12] scripture here he's talking he's talking
[26:13] about the scripture and how that Dove
[26:16] came down and it came down on the Lamb
[26:17] of God then as he moves forward in that
[26:20] message he starts typing the believer to
[26:22] a lamb he starts typing the believer to
[26:24] a sheep and he starts talking about the
[26:27] right condition that that lamb has to be
[26:29] in and he starts talking about about
[26:31] what a lamb is like the attributes of a
[26:34] lamb and he says the proverb refers them
[26:37] he calls them a a sacrificial bird and a
[26:41] sacrificial beast and he says that's
[26:42] what drew the Lord to those two animals
[26:45] is that they were animals that were
[26:47] sacrificial you know the dove it's a
[26:49] it's a monogamous bird it's a bird of
[26:51] Purity it has a mate for life that's
[26:54] right and we know in the scripture that
[26:55] Jesus told us when the comforter will be
[26:57] sent back to you he will abide with you
[27:01] forever what a type of the spirit of God
[27:03] and we know that we know that a lamb
[27:05] it's the ultimate sacrificial animal
[27:07] it's willing to do whatever the
[27:09] shepherd's voice tells it to do it's
[27:12] willing to go wherever the shepherd
[27:14] tells it to go it it's in the field it's
[27:17] listening to hear what the shepherd has
[27:18] to say to it it has ears open at all
[27:22] times and now that's what we have to get
[27:24] into today we have to get into a lamb's
[27:26] condition and that's something the
[27:27] prophet brought out in this tape and now
[27:30] he could have he could have chosen a
[27:31] lion he could have chosen a bear he
[27:33] could have chosen strong animals and
[27:35] strength to represent the believer but
[27:38] he chose an animal that was willing to
[27:41] give up its own self-will he chose an
[27:43] animal that was willing to have
[27:45] everything sheared off of it at any
[27:47] point of its life it was willing to give
[27:50] up anything to do what the shepherd said
[27:53] to do yes sir and that's why he
[27:56] represented himself like that and the
[27:57] these powerful animals a lion a bear
[28:01] like we said they they are animals that
[28:02] depend on their own strength they don't
[28:05] depend on anything else the lamb it
[28:08] depends on the shepherd they don't
[28:09] depend on anything they they do their
[28:11] own thing they do what they want to do
[28:14] they they're they're not a they're not
[28:15] sacrificial at all and the prophet says
[28:18] in the message the church in its
[28:20] condition he's speaking of people coming
[28:22] coming to a meeting that he's going to
[28:24] be at in Canada and he's talking about
[28:26] how they're sacrificing things to get
[28:28] there how there there's some people
[28:29] that's that's selling their businesses
[28:31] just to get to his meeting there's
[28:33] people that are that are selling
[28:34] everything they have just to come get a
[28:37] glimpse of what Jesus Christ is doing in
[28:40] in their hour they're selling everything
[28:43] there now there's a lot of there's a lot
[28:44] of sellouts
[28:47] today but they not a lot of sellouts for
[28:49] the right
[28:51] thing at any point we have to be willing
[28:53] to put anything down to sell out
[28:56] anything that the shepherd would tell us
[28:59] to sell out on we have to have a willing
[29:02] and an obedient heart that's what Jesus
[29:04] Christ had that's the example that he
[29:06] brought us he he showed us what a
[29:08] willing and obedient heart looked like
[29:11] he got down in the garden and he said
[29:13] father I don't want to do this I don't
[29:15] want to have to go I don't I don't want
[29:17] to have to sacrifice myself like this
[29:19] may this cup pass from me but if it be
[29:21] thy will
[29:23] Lord if you want me to do this Lord I
[29:25] will do it
[29:28] do it that's the lamb condition right
[29:31] there that's where we need to be at at a
[29:34] spot where we can give any of it up he
[29:35] said he said it's a sacrifice that they
[29:38] make is what causes them to get so much
[29:40] out of the service it's a sacrifice that
[29:43] they make he said when there's no
[29:46] sacrifice there's not very much to the
[29:49] service when there's no sacrifice
[29:51] there's not much to a service Wednesday
[29:53] nights sometimes they feel like a
[29:55] sacrifice they feel like a big sacrifice
[29:57] you had a a rough day and it's it it
[29:59] feels like a sacrifice getting over here
[30:01] at 7:00 p.m. and walking in the church
[30:03] and hearing hearing a not very good
[30:04] preacher preach to you it's a sacrifice
[30:07] you got to just sit on through it
[30:09] hopefully you
[30:11] will but why is that he said when
[30:13] there's no sacrifice there's there's not
[30:15] very much to the surface why is that
[30:17] it's because Christianity in itself at
[30:19] its core is built on
[30:22] sacrifice Jesus Christ's life was built
[30:25] on sacrifice it was doing whatever ever
[30:28] it took to win a soul it was doing
[30:30] whatever it took to to just pull
[30:32] somebody in closer to the gospel it's
[30:35] built on sacrifice he said you he said
[30:38] you have to really get down and do
[30:39] something that hurts real
[30:41] bad he said you have to lay aside some
[30:44] things and stop the work and do this or
[30:46] that to get to go to church and show God
[30:49] that you love him he said you make a
[30:51] sacrifice to God it's then when you get
[30:54] something out of it when you make a
[30:56] sacrifice to God and God want a believer
[30:58] in that sacrificial state in that
[31:01] sacrificial condition at all times
[31:04] willing and ready to
[31:05] go in the message of church and its
[31:08] condition again he says now another
[31:09] thing the lamb is the Lamb is willing to
[31:12] submit its rights he said now God wants
[31:15] us to be Lambs but there's so many times
[31:18] that we don't want to submit our rights
[31:20] or forfeit our rights you know we say
[31:23] brother I have a right to be angry at
[31:24] them they did me wrong I have a right to
[31:26] hold them accountable yeah all right I
[31:29] have a right to tell them what I think
[31:31] about them and when we get outside those
[31:33] Church doors I'm going to tell them what
[31:34] I think about them they they did me
[31:36] wrong and I got a right to do
[31:38] it but God's not going to he's not going
[31:40] to move in a heart of unforgiveness or a
[31:42] heart of bitterness that's not the right
[31:44] condition that's not a place that Dove
[31:47] it's going to go fly off as the prophet
[31:49] told us and sit on a branch somewhere
[31:51] it's going to fly away and it's going to
[31:52] sit on that Branch until we can realize
[31:55] what's happened we can take an in we can
[31:58] think that's the problem nowadays people
[32:00] say I feel so distant from the Lord I
[32:02] feel like my prayer it's not making it
[32:04] past the ceiling I I feel like it's not
[32:06] going anywhere well at that point we
[32:08] need to take a personal inventory and
[32:10] think father do I need to go make
[32:12] something right is there a reason my
[32:14] prayer does it feel like it's not
[32:15] getting to you is the dove far from me
[32:19] and he'll reveal it to you if you have a
[32:21] True Heart of
[32:23] repentance that's what repentance it
[32:25] repentance isn't just right when we
[32:26] first come to the Lord
[32:28] right when the initial birth happens but
[32:30] it's every single day of our life it's
[32:33] over and over and over again I I I make
[32:36] mistakes every single day and we have to
[32:39] continually repent for them and
[32:40] repenting is you you've been going this
[32:42] way and you make a 18 180 and you decide
[32:45] you're going to go this way it's turning
[32:47] for the lord it's making a U-turn in
[32:50] life going down a different
[32:53] street you know unforgiveness I've heard
[32:55] I've heard some people say that you know
[32:57] unforgiveness or when you have a odd
[32:59] against somebody when you have a
[33:00] disagreement it's only hurting you I've
[33:03] heard people preach that they say it's
[33:04] only hurting you and I understand what
[33:06] they're saying it it does hurt you
[33:08] because then you're sitting there and
[33:09] you're thinking about it and it's
[33:11] messing your day up when they don't even
[33:13] know anything's going on they don't even
[33:15] they they have no idea anything's going
[33:17] on but it's messing your day up but i'
[33:20] would also like to I'd like to think
[33:22] about it on the other hand too when
[33:24] you're holding something against
[33:26] somebody like that in your life and
[33:27] you're not in that right condition
[33:29] you're hurting them too what if the Lord
[33:31] wants to use you to contact them are you
[33:35] in the right condition would would he
[33:37] use you in that manner to contact them
[33:39] if you have a odd against them we have
[33:42] to think of it both ways it's not just
[33:43] hurting you it could possibly be hurting
[33:46] somebody that needs their soul saved
[33:48] that needs to hear the that needs to
[33:49] hear a tape for the first time that
[33:51] needs to read their Bible for the first
[33:53] time if you got something against them
[33:55] like that he goes on he says so many of
[33:58] you say well I've got rights brother
[33:59] Brenham he said that's true but are you
[34:02] willing to forfeit your rights are you
[34:04] willing to give your rights that God
[34:06] could lead you that's what the matter
[34:09] with our churches today in the majority
[34:11] that the gentleness of the Lamb of God
[34:13] we are supposed to be lambs and we have
[34:14] become everything else but Lambs he said
[34:17] we become everything else but Lambs he
[34:20] says and that's the reason as soon as we
[34:23] get that attitude the dove of the Holy
[34:25] Spirit takes her flight and leaves she
[34:27] does
[34:28] he says if the Lamb of God would have
[34:30] made the first snarl like a wolf or
[34:32] would have done anything contrary to
[34:34] what the gentle Dove would have
[34:35] permitted the dove would have took her
[34:37] flight yes she would have left in a
[34:41] minute and we have to invite that Dove
[34:43] back we have to get in a condition that
[34:45] that Dove is willing to come back into
[34:47] our lives we have to get in a spot it it
[34:51] starts with recognition and you know
[34:53] what he said about repentance he said
[34:54] before and this was for time and time
[34:56] again in in our spiritual walk he said
[34:59] before you can get to that heart of
[35:00] repentance he said you got to go back
[35:03] and realize what Calvary meant to you
[35:05] you have to go back and have a
[35:07] revelation and a realization in your
[35:09] life of what he did for you because
[35:12] initially when you got when you had that
[35:14] first revelation when it really struck
[35:16] your heart what Christ did for you that
[35:18] somebody that shouldn't have cared about
[35:19] you cared for you when you were down in
[35:22] the myy clay that he reached down and
[35:25] picked you up when you come back to that
[35:26] revelation
[35:28] then you can have a heart of repentance
[35:31] and now a heart of repentance it's not
[35:32] being a lifetime apology Giver either it
[35:35] it's it's talking about you give the
[35:37] apology and we're we're turning a
[35:38] different way it's not I'm going to
[35:40] apologize and I'm going to do it do the
[35:42] same thing to you again tomorrow I'm
[35:43] going to apologize and do it again
[35:44] tomorrow that's not a true heart of
[35:46] repentance a True Heart of repentance is
[35:49] realizing you've wronged the one that's
[35:51] done everything for you when you didn't
[35:54] deserve it when we didn't deserve it
[35:55] when I didn't deserve it he goes on in
[35:58] that same thought and he says and the
[36:00] dove would not have settled on a wolf
[36:02] his Nature's not right it couldn't have
[36:04] settled on a dog his Nature's not right
[36:06] it had to be on a lamb he said the two
[36:10] Natures had to be the same and that's
[36:12] the way we have to be our Natures has to
[36:15] change from the Roaring sinner to the
[36:18] meekness of a lamb and as we're saying
[36:21] that that's a daily battle that's a
[36:23] daily fight we're going to fight for
[36:25] every inch of ground that we claim that
[36:27] we want to stand on we're going to
[36:28] continue to fight it's not it's not good
[36:31] enough that that I was just I had the I
[36:33] was in the lamb condition on Tuesday and
[36:36] then then I go back to being a wretch on
[36:37] Wednesday that's not good enough that's
[36:40] not what he's looking for he's looking
[36:42] for that constant lamb condition
[36:44] somebody that he can use at all times
[36:47] not just somebody he can use on their
[36:49] good days when everything's going right
[36:51] for him but somebody that he can use on
[36:52] their bad days when nothing's going
[36:54] right for him cuz speaking for preaching
[36:57] itself when when you have a service
[36:58] coming up and you're about to preach I I
[37:01] know brother George and brother Israel
[37:02] could probably attest for it everything
[37:04] goes wrong your day turns bad the devil
[37:07] starts attacking he your truck won't
[37:09] start you you can't you can't get to
[37:10] work on time all kinds of stuff happens
[37:12] to you but you got to keep that lamb
[37:14] condition you got to stay in a place
[37:17] where God can use you if you get out of
[37:19] that lamb condition he can't use you
[37:23] you'll just sit there and you'll stay in
[37:24] it Lord help us
[37:29] he says is anything too hard for the
[37:31] Lord he says now Satan do you do you
[37:33] think the devil knows when God's about
[37:35] to do something for you do you think the
[37:37] devil can see
[37:39] that he says now Satan was trying to
[37:41] block Abraham and Sarah because he knew
[37:44] there was an Angelic visitation coming
[37:46] the devil was trying to get them out of
[37:48] a condition now he was trying to get
[37:51] them in a wrong condition and he
[37:53] succeeded with one of them he succeeded
[37:55] with Sarah the prophet says he didn't
[37:57] seed with Abraham now a few paragraphs
[38:00] down in the same message he's speaking
[38:01] to Sarah he says see she had herself all
[38:04] out of condition to receive it when God
[38:07] brought
[38:08] it you know we ask God for so much in
[38:11] our lives and we and and he wants to
[38:13] give it to us but we just can't seem to
[38:16] sometimes get to a place where we can
[38:17] allow him to give it to us where we can
[38:19] allow ourselves to receive it he says oh
[38:23] my don't never get that in your heart he
[38:25] said be open be ready he said she missed
[38:28] it she failed to see it he said maybe if
[38:31] we don't watch Friends the church is
[38:32] going to fail to see it he said let's
[38:35] not look for church hair does and new
[38:36] dresses he said let's look for the Holy
[38:39] Spirit to come in the Supernatural and
[38:42] raise some things when we walk into a
[38:44] church service let's not be looking
[38:45] around at everybody's new pair of shoes
[38:47] or their new clothes they got on let's
[38:49] look like in that song service that we
[38:51] just had let's look for the Holy Spirit
[38:54] to move in this place let's have
[38:56] expectations
[38:58] let's build an atmosphere you know he
[38:59] refers to the believer in this age as a
[39:02] spiritual
[39:04] astronaut and now something about an
[39:06] astronaut when he goes to space or when
[39:08] they go to the moon or wherever they end
[39:10] up going he's a pilgrim in a Strange
[39:12] Land so for him to make it in that
[39:14] Strange Land he's got to bring his own
[39:15] atmosphere with him and that's what we
[39:18] got to do in a church we got to bring
[39:19] our own atmosphere with us and watch it
[39:22] start affecting somebody that's sitting
[39:24] here that's the reason why Fellowship is
[39:26] so important come into the house of God
[39:29] because you may be on the mountain top
[39:31] but your brother or sister over here is
[39:32] in the valley and they need your help to
[39:34] pick them up out of it that's why we got
[39:37] to get in the right condition no matter
[39:39] where we're at we're depending on one
[39:43] another we need one
[39:46] another he said the church don't need a
[39:48] facelift it needs a birth he said the
[39:52] Holy Ghost to come into the church bring
[39:54] back people is that what we still
[39:55] believe today that we need the holy
[39:57] ghost in the church or are we just a
[39:59] bunch of Saved people are we just just a
[40:01] bunch of Saved people sitting here it
[40:02] don't it don't matter if the Holy Ghost
[40:04] moves or not he has to move for anything
[40:07] good to happen for you he has to move
[40:09] we're not going to work it up oursel
[40:11] it's not how good I am it wasn't he said
[40:14] it's not how good Abraham is he said
[40:17] it's because Abraham was elected and
[40:19] then Abraham was called and then Abraham
[40:22] separated himself from
[40:24] everything that's what he called Abraham
[40:26] to do
[40:27] and that's what he calls us to do it's a
[40:30] lection then it's a calling out and then
[40:32] it's a separation from
[40:34] everything and that's what the lamb will
[40:36] do it'll Shear off
[40:39] everything it won't sit there and kick
[40:41] he mentions that in another spot it
[40:42] won't sit there and kick whoever's
[40:44] sharing it but it'll take it it'll just
[40:46] take that sharing it'll take any
[40:47] correction it needs any of the the the
[40:50] Lambs today the lamb sitting in here
[40:52] they'll take the word when it comes
[40:54] forth when that seed word comes forth
[40:58] They will receive it if they are in a
[41:00] lamb
[41:02] condition he says bring back people and
[41:05] that believes the Supernatural and holds
[41:07] on in waiting for the coming of the Lord
[41:09] as if it might be any hour living in
[41:12] them conditions he said no facelift we
[41:15] don't we don't need a covering up we
[41:17] don't need excuses we just need a birth
[41:19] if anybody is if you know the story of
[41:21] zakus as a prophet tells it and he kind
[41:23] of dramatized it a little bit he said
[41:25] zakus gets up in a tree cuz he's trying
[41:27] to see Jesus and zakus is sitting in
[41:30] there and the tree it has a spot that
[41:31] comes to a y and that's God's way and
[41:34] that's zaki's way and he said that's a
[41:35] great place to be because that's where
[41:38] change comes and so zakus he's sitting
[41:40] there and he's wanting to see Jesus he's
[41:42] looking for Jesus I feel like if we
[41:46] should be coming here looking for Jesus
[41:48] I don't care if we've been believing for
[41:50] 50 years or just 10 minutes we should
[41:52] come here looking for Jesus but
[41:55] zakus he's got all that garbage all over
[41:57] him he's got all that stink on him he's
[41:59] got splinters all up and down him and
[42:02] zakus right when he sees Jesus around
[42:04] the corner what does he do he takes two
[42:06] branches and he covers himself
[42:08] up he just covers himself and that's
[42:10] that's a what what did Adam and Eve do
[42:12] they covered their self and that's what
[42:14] we do sometime we try and cover it up
[42:17] but God's going to he's going to search
[42:18] it out he sees what's in our heart he
[42:21] sees what's keeping us from getting in
[42:23] that right condition he's going to
[42:26] search it out he's going to find
[42:28] it and after it's all said and done
[42:31] we're glad that he found it because we
[42:33] were able to move out of that condition
[42:34] and get in a right condition to receive
[42:37] something from
[42:39] him and he talks of he he says in
[42:42] Blasphemous names he says it's a birth
[42:44] and and he says I've been birthed into
[42:46] this and this and this and this he says
[42:48] it seven times so just after the initial
[42:51] birth it's not done there there's still
[42:52] some growing to do we never we we don't
[42:55] just come in receive it and then it's
[42:57] all said and done but we're birthed into
[42:59] this into this we grow and we grow our
[43:02] condition gets better and better we get
[43:05] closer to that Lamb of God condition
[43:07] that example that came and walked this
[43:09] Earth for us that's the example that's
[43:11] the condition we need to get
[43:13] into he said then what does he do when
[43:16] he gives me the Holy Ghost he said he
[43:17] sits you out in a separate place to
[43:19] yourself he said he marks you see so
[43:23] it's an election it's a calling then
[43:25] it's that separation and that's that's
[43:27] been that was a precent that God sent
[43:29] from the very beginning God separated
[43:31] the light from the
[43:33] darkness and if if this is anything
[43:35] today it's a separating time it's a
[43:38] separating time it's a preparation time
[43:41] to get ready for the coming of the Lord
[43:43] to to be in a Rapture condition whenever
[43:46] he calls it could be as a prophet said
[43:48] over and over in the tapes it could be
[43:50] tonight it could be in the morning and
[43:52] and he preached that to people hard the
[43:55] Rapture condition we we have to get to a
[43:58] place where you wouldn't be scared about
[43:59] it if it was in the morning where we
[44:01] wouldn't feel like we had anything to
[44:03] worry about a a beautiful testimony
[44:05] brother Mark Castillo his me and brother
[44:07] George went over there and his mother
[44:08] had just passed away we showed up there
[44:11] on Friday or Saturday and his mother had
[44:14] passed away
[44:15] Thursday and you you would think that
[44:17] you would you would walk in and you
[44:19] would see a guy that was a mess and I'm
[44:21] sure he was a little bit but he wasn't
[44:23] showing it and the reason he wasn't
[44:24] showing it is because his mother had
[44:26] been so faithful for years and years and
[44:29] her her last breath was that this is
[44:31] what I've been waiting for this is the
[44:33] moment I've been wait this is what I've
[44:36] been preparing for she was in a lamb
[44:40] condition she knew that the shepherd was
[44:43] coming to get her what a testimony
[44:46] laying there on your deathbed so many
[44:49] people would be scared to death of that
[44:51] but she said this is what I've been
[44:53] waiting for I'm going home I don't have
[44:54] to deal with this anymore I'm about I'm
[44:56] about about to shed these 16 elements
[44:58] and I'm going to go somewhere different
[45:00] that's where I'm going to go put me in
[45:02] the ground already and if that's if
[45:04] that's how we can't think about death
[45:06] today that's we would we should take an
[45:09] inventory if if you can't think about if
[45:12] I were on my death bed right now would
[45:14] would my testimony be come get me Lord
[45:16] I'm I'm ready I know I'm prepared for
[45:18] this I don't not being arrogant not not
[45:21] being arrogant about it but knowing that
[45:22] you've done everything that the Lord's
[45:24] wanted you to do knowing that you you've
[45:26] been in a land condition that you've
[45:27] allowed him to lead you that there's
[45:30] nothing else you need to make right that
[45:32] you made those things
[45:34] right is that our testimony would it be
[45:37] our testimony and if it's not we need to
[45:40] think on those things we need to we need
[45:42] to find out where the problems at if
[45:44] there are any as I mean not for me I
[45:47] don't have any I mean if you guys got
[45:49] some if you do I don't I don't I'm
[45:52] thinking right now and I really can't
[45:53] spot any but
[45:57] he goes on he says you're a different
[45:59] person then he said you're not of the
[46:00] world no more he said see you're clothed
[46:03] different you're dressed different he
[46:06] said not this outside dress he said no
[46:08] no you don't have to be odd and peculiar
[46:10] and and caller turned around and a long
[46:12] ceremony he said like no no you you
[46:14] don't do that he said you dress
[46:15] physically like this it's a spiritual
[46:17] dress that counts the wedding garment
[46:20] has been put on you he said what are you
[46:23] he said like Jesus watch he was
[46:25] overshadowed and he was transf triggered
[46:27] before them and his reignment Shine Like
[46:30] the Sun there he was Jesus God placing
[46:33] his own sun sea and that's what he's
[46:35] saying here if that if that spiritual
[46:37] reignment on the inside if that starts
[46:39] shining that'll make this outside
[46:41] reignment start shining that'll make
[46:43] that's what makes this outside reignment
[46:45] start coming under subjection when that
[46:48] spiritual reignment when it starts
[46:49] shining we'll we'll start seeing men
[46:51] walk like men again talk like men again
[46:53] act like men again not act like women
[46:56] and we'll start see and women get back
[46:58] to the place where they're supposed to
[46:59] be if that spiritual reignment is right
[47:02] and it's shining and Something's
[47:04] Happened on the inside that's what God
[47:06] cares about he cares about what's
[47:07] happening on the inside the inside
[47:10] condition the outside condition Abraham
[47:13] when he finally got to the end to the
[47:15] promise being fulfilled he was old and
[47:17] decrepit he he didn't look like much of
[47:19] anything but that inside condition
[47:21] something was happening on the inside he
[47:24] had he had waited he had preped prepared
[47:27] and something was fixing to happen in
[47:29] Abraham's
[47:31] life and that's what it takes to become
[47:33] reflectors of the word in this day the
[47:35] prophet he says uh the prophets of God
[47:38] are reflectors reflectors of God's word
[47:40] and then in that same tape when he's
[47:42] talking about that he said you are
[47:44] reflectors of God's
[47:46] word now let me say something that might
[47:49] not be popular amongst the message today
[47:51] if we're not if we're not hearing that
[47:53] messenger reflector and if we're not
[47:55] reflecting the same thing that he's
[47:57] reflecting then you can't be a true
[47:59] reflector today you got to be hearing
[48:01] that voice you got to hear the
[48:04] voice I like what brother Israel said he
[48:06] said you you can read the tapes you can
[48:08] read them that's fine I do that with a
[48:09] lot of the older tapes but hear the
[48:12] voice of God for your day it does
[48:14] something to you it drives out demons I
[48:17] remember when I when I was brand new and
[48:19] I would I would flip on a tape and I was
[48:21] so tormented anxiety depression whatever
[48:24] it was you name it and I would flip on a
[48:26] tape and those demons scattered like
[48:28] cockroaches when you flip flip on a
[48:30] light they don't want nothing to do with
[48:32] that there's power on those tapes
[48:34] there's power behind that voice it was
[48:36] in the days of what the
[48:39] voice there's power
[48:42] there we need to be hearing that voice
[48:45] he goes on in another place he says now
[48:46] the lamb is a very gentle little fell he
[48:49] said he doesn't he can't help himself he
[48:51] isn't self-reliance because he can't
[48:53] help himself the lamb he realizes he's
[48:56] nothing
[48:57] he realizes he's not a thing he said
[49:00] here some time ago I was going through a
[49:02] pasture when I used to patrol and I
[49:04] found a little lamb and all of them that
[49:06] had got away from him somehow said and
[49:08] he was all wound up in a little bunch of
[49:10] Bob wire now that lamb I imagine got
[49:12] himself wound up in that Bob wire it was
[49:15] his fault he had gotten away from the
[49:17] rest and he got himself in an awful
[49:20] condition and God will let us get in
[49:22] that shape sometimes he'll let he'll let
[49:24] us open our own doors he'll let us
[49:26] follow our own
[49:28] ways he'll let us figure it out for
[49:30] oursel because if he doesn't if he helps
[49:32] us too soon and we'll say oh Lord I had
[49:34] a couple doors left now I probably could
[49:36] have still done it my way but he'll let
[49:38] us try every single
[49:41] way he said and the poor little fellow
[49:43] was laying there bleeding and bleeding
[49:45] and I come by and I seen way up about a
[49:47] half mile up was a whole herd of sheep
[49:50] he said now he'd have laid right there
[49:51] and the crows would have been picking in
[49:52] his eyes pretty soon if he hadn't have
[49:54] got him out he said but I W the little
[49:57] guy little fell picked him up in my arms
[50:00] he never refused he laid real quiet he
[50:03] said I picked him up in my arms first
[50:05] time perhaps a human being had ever had
[50:08] their hands on him but he was gentle he
[50:10] was willing to be
[50:12] led he was willing to be helped he said
[50:15] I hope you see it he was willing not to
[50:17] try to resist or to kick back or to bite
[50:20] he said Lambs don't Kickback they don't
[50:21] bite they just humble themselves and
[50:25] this little fi packed him up
[50:27] and sit him down on the rest of the
[50:28] sheep in a few minutes his mam found him
[50:30] and he was happy as he was now how
[50:32] typical that is of a lamb of God and he
[50:36] he's bringing these things out to tell
[50:37] us this is what this is where we need to
[50:40] be he's saying this is how we need to be
[50:43] with the Lord we need to allow him to
[50:44] lead us we need to be ready at any
[50:46] moment to move whatever Direction he
[50:48] says no matter if it's hard if it's easy
[50:51] no matter which direction it
[50:54] is he says in another place but the lamb
[50:56] it doesn't have any great minds of its
[50:59] own he said a lamb is one thing when
[51:01] it's lost it's hopelessly lost we were
[51:05] hopelessly lost we we had no way of
[51:07] bridging that Gap we had no way of
[51:10] getting ourself to Jesus Christ he came
[51:13] looking for us he ran us down we didn't
[51:15] run him down we didn't go seeking him I
[51:18] don't ever remember it it crossing my
[51:19] mind I need to go seek Jesus but one day
[51:22] he ran me down from behind and grabbed a
[51:24] hold of me and changed my
[51:28] life it wasn't in us to seek after him
[51:31] there there was nothing that we could do
[51:33] to get oursel to him nothing at all he
[51:36] said a sheep can't find its way back he
[51:38] said that's the reason the goat leads it
[51:41] to its death he said it can't find its
[51:43] way a sheep's lost he said that's the
[51:45] reason God likened us to sheep when
[51:48] we're lost we're lost he said there's no
[51:50] way we can find oursel he said there's
[51:52] only one way to do it that's submit
[51:54] yourselves to The Shepherd of the FL
[51:56] block and he does deleting and he
[51:59] mentions this this lamb it it realizes
[52:01] it doesn't have a great mind of its own
[52:04] but sometimes today we get to thinking
[52:06] we might be somebody because we got this
[52:08] message we might begin to think I'm
[52:11] somebody I'm something special I'm the
[52:13] bride of Christ I'm special and there's
[52:15] so much preaching today about you're the
[52:17] bride of Christ you're special you're
[52:19] this you're that we are nothing let's
[52:21] not get away from the Good gospel
[52:22] message we're nothing without Jesus
[52:24] Christ we're nothing without the blood
[52:26] of Jesus Christ we are zip without it we
[52:30] were nowhere without it the prophet
[52:32] tells a story of a man that he was he he
[52:35] was walking up a hill it was a a man
[52:36] that was real smart he said he could he
[52:38] could talk about the Bible with anybody
[52:40] he knew all the Hebrew he knew all the
[52:42] Greek and he was walking up the hill to
[52:44] his church one day and he kind of got a
[52:46] feeling that somebody was walking behind
[52:47] him and so he stops for a second because
[52:50] he was going to talk to him about the
[52:51] word a little bit and as he turns and
[52:53] looks he sees a A man carrying like a
[52:55] big bundle on his back and the bundle he
[52:58] said was bigger than the man himself he
[53:00] said it was bigger than the man and he
[53:03] looked over at him and he he asked him
[53:04] if he needed some help and he said no I
[53:07] got to pack this bundle myself he said I
[53:10] got to pack this bundle and he said then
[53:12] I realized I was in a vision he said I
[53:14] looked down at his hands and there was
[53:15] holes in his
[53:17] hands he said I realized who it was I
[53:20] was talking to and he fell down and he
[53:22] said Lord I'm so sorry he said is that
[53:24] he said is that the sins of the world on
[53:26] your back he said no that's just your
[53:28] sins on my back he said I got to get you
[53:31] up this hill I got you got to get you in
[53:33] a right condition so when we get to
[53:36] thinking we're somebody remember who's
[53:37] carrying our sins on his back up the
[53:40] hill when we get to thinking we know a
[53:42] lot when we get to thinking we're
[53:44] something special or or something about
[53:46] this Flesh and Blood warranted our
[53:48] Salvation remember who's packing that
[53:50] bundle up the hill we were not able to
[53:53] pack that bundle that bundle that bundle
[53:56] that that wasn't our bundle to pack that
[53:57] was his bundle to pack we didn't do
[54:00] anything we and then sometimes we we'll
[54:02] be ashamed of it we'll be ashamed to
[54:04] testify of it we'll be we'll be ashamed
[54:08] to to say what Jesus Christ has done for
[54:10] me last night my my truck broke down at
[54:13] work that's why I mentioned that it was
[54:14] 9:00 p.m. I had just got finished
[54:16] studying at my work and I went out to
[54:17] crank my truck broke down it it wouldn't
[54:19] start and so I called this Uber and uh
[54:22] it was a Jamaican guy showed up in the
[54:24] Uber and he was a Christian and I just
[54:26] thought isn't it funny how God works
[54:28] things out and so we started talking
[54:29] about he had Christian music on the
[54:31] radio and actually invited him to church
[54:33] tonight and we I just started testifying
[54:35] to him I started testifying about Jesus
[54:38] I didn't I didn't mention anything else
[54:39] but just Jesus Christ and he had the
[54:42] same testimony and I thought how good is
[54:44] God how how good how how Faithful Is He
[54:47] that he would put two people together
[54:49] like this you know what started out
[54:51] looking like I can't believe my truck is
[54:53] broke down why in the world is this
[54:54] broke down and and it led to that
[54:58] conversation we can't be ashamed to to
[55:00] share the gospel he tells another story
[55:03] about that the girl returning home from
[55:05] college on the train oh yeah and she's
[55:07] riding the train back and she's got her
[55:09] her worldly college friend with her that
[55:11] she had picked up brother Bram said she
[55:12] had she had gotten away and gotten away
[55:14] from God out there at college and a
[55:17] worldly friend was sitting beside her
[55:18] and they're pulling up and they they see
[55:20] this old scarred up marred up woman
[55:22] walking over there and the friend says
[55:24] my goodness look at her wouldn't you be
[55:26] a ashamed to be seen with her wouldn't
[55:28] you be ashamed to be seen eaten with her
[55:30] and it was her
[55:31] mother and she's sitting there and she
[55:33] doesn't say anything then she gets off
[55:35] the train and and the mother comes up to
[55:37] her just how Jesus does with us or how
[55:38] he did with us how he does every day
[55:40] with us and the mother ran up and and
[55:43] tried to hug her and put her arms around
[55:45] said my darling my darling you've
[55:46] returned
[55:47] back and then the girl turns away just
[55:50] turns her back to her
[55:52] mother and then the conductor of the
[55:54] trainy says knew the story so he said
[55:58] the conductor of the train walked over
[56:00] and grabbed a hold of the girl and said
[56:01] you mean to tell me that's how you're
[56:02] going to act to your mother he said let
[56:04] me remind you of the story every time I
[56:06] tell a story it's hard to hard to make
[56:09] it through this one he said when you're
[56:11] a baby he said you know the story when
[56:13] you were a baby the house was on fire
[56:16] and he said you were upstairs and your
[56:17] mother was out back hanging the
[56:21] clothes and there was and there was a
[56:24] fire in the house and GRE upstairs and
[56:26] the mother and the the the fir trucks
[56:29] came and everybody came and brother
[56:31] Brandon made a statement when he was
[56:32] telling the story he said nobody would
[56:34] dare Pierce those Flames for you he said
[56:37] nobody would dare do it nobody wanted to
[56:40] enter that fire for
[56:42] you and as he goes on he said that
[56:44] mother she grabbed some clothes and she
[56:46] wrapped herself in them and she ran
[56:48] through the house and then she got to
[56:49] you and she had to take all that
[56:51] wrapping off and and cover you up and as
[56:54] she ran out all the Flames were licking
[56:56] her all the Flames were hitting her and
[56:58] they were scarring her up and they were
[56:59] making her ugly and he said she was even
[57:02] more beautiful than you was but because
[57:05] of her love for
[57:06] you because she she she couldn't stand
[57:09] to see you die just like Christ with us
[57:11] he couldn't stand to see you die that's
[57:14] right a life of sin he went in the
[57:17] Flames for you he went on the cross for
[57:20] you and we may know all of this maybe
[57:22] this is simple but like I said you can't
[57:25] get away from preaching the gospel
[57:26] message the blood of Jesus
[57:28] Christ what does any of it mean to us if
[57:31] not for that what's this message mean if
[57:34] not for that yes sir would it mean
[57:36] anything at the end of that
[57:38] story The Prophet said that's the way
[57:41] Jesus did for us he said when we were
[57:42] Sinners ugly before God Cast Away turned
[57:46] away he came the lovely Son of God from
[57:48] the ivory palaces come down upon the
[57:51] Earth and took the shame upon himself
[57:56] he said and and the sin upon himself and
[57:59] died out there at Calvary
[58:03] crying he said should I be ashamed of
[58:06] his gospel that's right that's right
[58:10] should we be ashamed to be a lamb that's
[58:12] led by the dove should we be ashamed of
[58:14] that today no matter what the world
[58:15] tells us is the right way no matter what
[58:17] the Glamorous way is should we be
[58:19] ashamed of that today we can't be
[58:21] ashamed of that today he said Christians
[58:24] on the streets were ashamed to stand up
[58:26] for the gospel he said when he was
[58:28] marred and made ugly that you could be
[58:31] free he was marred with sin that you
[58:34] could be free from sin he said don't
[58:36] never deny him always love him he said
[58:40] stand for that which is true stand for
[58:44] his
[58:46] gospel as a musicians come tonight we'll
[58:48] just read we'll read one more quote
[58:51] here in the church in its condition
[58:57] he says come back to a lamb he says come
[59:01] back to be gentle come back to know
[59:04] nothing come back to just submit
[59:06] yourself to Christ he said don't don't
[59:09] try don't try to know nothing he said
[59:11] just walk meekly quietly humbly gently
[59:15] and the dove will lead you he said but
[59:19] whenever you see go to listening to that
[59:20] gossip whenever you go to getting that
[59:22] temper up whenever you go to thinking
[59:24] that you got a right to do this or you
[59:26] got a right to do that the dove just
[59:28] takes her flight and goes on
[59:31] away he said then you don't have it
[59:33] anymore he said now she's not very far
[59:36] from you this morning church or
[59:39] tonight he said she's sitting right out
[59:41] there on the limb of Peace waiting for
[59:43] your nature to be
[59:46] changed he said what you need today is
[59:48] to submit all your rights is to let God
[59:51] lay you down and shave all your rights
[59:53] off of you he he said amen could you
[59:56] imagine how a little old lamb all fleece
[59:59] hanging over him that's his rights he
[1:00:01] said yeah yeah pant pant pant burning up
[1:00:03] and then just lay on the shearing table
[1:00:06] they know what's best for him take all
[1:00:08] of his rights away from him and Shear it
[1:00:10] all off how cool and light he runs and
[1:00:13] that opportunity is here tonight how
[1:00:15] cool and light you can run if you'll
[1:00:18] just allow him to Shear it off of you
[1:00:20] and that's got to be a decision of yours
[1:00:22] repentance has to be a decision of yours
[1:00:25] he he can't make that decision for you
[1:00:28] he can't take that step for you that's
[1:00:30] right he can't make something right for
[1:00:32] you these are things that we have to
[1:00:34] realize we have to take that inventory
[1:00:36] and go make it right go apologize
[1:00:39] forgive that brother forgive that sister
[1:00:41] no matter what they did to
[1:00:43] you whatever it is whatever is blocking
[1:00:45] that lamb condition we got to get rid of
[1:00:48] it in our lives we got to seek it out
[1:00:51] and get rid of
[1:00:52] it he said yes sir I I'll if you'll
[1:00:55] forfeit your rights that's what you get
[1:00:57] but you got to forfeit your rights and

[1:01:02] off of you take all the habits of the
[1:01:04] world away and you become a new creature
[1:01:07] in
[1:01:09] Christ and if we could just bow our
[1:01:11] heads here this is a this is a prayer
[1:01:14] that the prophet prayed at the end of
[1:01:15] this
[1:01:17] message he said but what am I going to

[1:35:15] life give it all to you brother Trevor
[1:35:20] had a testimony or something to say here
[1:35:25] God bless you I um I wanted to share
[1:35:30] something that happened the other night
[1:35:33] with me and Abby I haven't really talked
[1:35:37] about it with her it's kind of just been
[1:35:39] on my
[1:35:41] heart but I've been uh we've been doing
[1:35:46] um door Dash and delivering food just
[1:35:48] for some extra money on the side to help
[1:35:51] out with bills and stuff and um
[1:35:54] it's really nice having her with me and
[1:35:56] it's nice having the company and we I
[1:36:00] picked up an order real cheap order like
[1:36:02] $4 or something and I W I walked into uh
[1:36:08] it was a Little Caesar's
[1:36:10] and there was this this man he was
[1:36:15] really upset because his card was
[1:36:17] declining and he was getting frustrated
[1:36:21] and he was cussing and getting mad at
[1:36:24] the the lady on the other side of the
[1:36:26] counter and my order was 10 minutes
[1:36:29] behind so I thought I'd just commit and
[1:36:31] just wait for so I was waiting and he
[1:36:34] was getting more and more
[1:36:35] frustrated
[1:36:38] and something in me said to help him out
[1:36:42] or to pay for it and you know offer at
[1:36:45] least
[1:36:46] and I didn't listen to that I didn't I
[1:36:51] didn't give any attention to that I
[1:36:53] thought here I am trying to make money
[1:36:56] I'm like why you know and it was just
[1:36:59] greedy mindset of mine and and so he he
[1:37:03] he went back and he's looking at his
[1:37:05] phone trying to figure it
[1:37:06] out and this man got his order and he
[1:37:10] this other person he walked out but
[1:37:13] after I kind of decided in my my heart
[1:37:16] that I'm not going to do anything about
[1:37:17] this this red man he he walked back in
[1:37:21] he goes up to him and he put his armed
[1:37:23] on his shoulder and he said hey he
[1:37:26] said I I think he started with a
[1:37:29] compliment he's like I really like your
[1:37:31] hat he's like where did you get that hat
[1:37:33] at and he's like he's all frustrated
[1:37:35] he's like I I got at the certain store
[1:37:38] whatever he's like it's a really nice
[1:37:39] hat he's like and then he like kind of
[1:37:41] got a little closer like more maybe to
[1:37:43] like whisper he's like can I can I buy
[1:37:46] your food for you you know can I help
[1:37:47] you out I'll pay for it and the guy he
[1:37:51] said no no no it's it's fine I and he's
[1:37:53] like are you sure and the guy's like no
[1:37:56] I'm I'm fine I got it he's like well
[1:37:58] have a good night and he walked out and
[1:38:02] he
[1:38:03] eventually um ended up leaving and I got
[1:38:06] my order carried on with my night but it
[1:38:08] just kept eating at me I'm like if this
[1:38:11] random man could come in and help him
[1:38:15] while the Lord's speaking to me to help
[1:38:19] this person I don't even know who this
[1:38:21] guy is I don't even know his life or his
[1:38:23] story who came to offer and help
[1:38:27] but with what I
[1:38:30] know and to know the Lord like I do
[1:38:34] what's my excuse what's what's an extra
[1:38:37] what's 10 bucks Less in my account to
[1:38:39] help someone out who's hungry and I just
[1:38:43] really tore up about it and just like I
[1:38:45] said I haven't even talked to Abby about
[1:38:47] this but I'm just disappointed to myself
[1:38:50] and just take it as a lesson to maybe
[1:38:56] you know be more willing to let the Lord
[1:38:58] use me even if it means $10 less in my
[1:39:00] account like what what does that matter
[1:39:02] the Lord has all my money under control
[1:39:05] doesn't matter and he tried to use
[1:39:09] me and I was unusable and I
[1:39:13] just just wanted to share that
[1:39:17] maybe that pothole I stepped in someone
[1:39:19] could I could just map that out for
[1:39:21] somebody so they could see it on their
[1:39:22] path and just say oh there's that P and
[1:39:25] step around it so hope that's
[1:39:26] encouraging to you and I just wanted to
[1:39:29] share that
[1:39:31] so thank you brother Trevor God bless
