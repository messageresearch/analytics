[0:00] and godly fear and Brotherly Love Takes
[0:02] its place in the human heart then you'll
[0:05] become salty then the message will have
[0:08] its preeminence in the heart it'll have
[0:13] its influence in the city he said that
[0:17] in Phoenix huh yes here brother vam has
[0:21] asked a question on stubbornness and God
[0:23] being
[0:24] misunderstood any of y'all stubborn in
[0:28] here don't don't confess it now say
[0:32] you're fighting
[0:33] stubbornness I'm not stubborn but
[0:36] something stubborn likes to get on me
[0:38] every now and I'm fighting against a
[0:40] stubborn
[0:42] right because I'm a Christian we're
[0:45] ain't going to be no stubbornness in
[0:46] heaven and that's where I'm going
[0:48] brother Zach by God's grace I'll see you
[0:50] there will you dance with me on the
[0:53] streets of Glory yes ain't going to be
[0:56] no stubbornness over there so Believers
[0:59] you know we fight against those Spirits
[1:01] I'm fighting against them all the time
[1:04] all the days of our life we fight
[1:06] against them they ask brother Rand a
[1:07] question question 137 in the message God
[1:10] being misunderstood 1961 brother brandom
[1:13] I am saved I've been baptized in the
[1:15] name of Jesus Christ but how do I get
[1:17] away from a stubborn spirit that I can't
[1:21] seem to break away from this is
[1:23] paragraph number 46 in the message God
[1:26] being misunderstood so they ask the
[1:28] question how do I get away so it's
[1:31] obviously a Christian Christians are the
[1:34] ones who
[1:35] care anyways and so they want to get rid
[1:38] of this well my Christian brother or
[1:40] sister whoever it may be now most times
[1:43] when you find people that's got stubborn
[1:46] Spirits it's usually a complex that
[1:50] causes this either they have inherited
[1:53] from a mother father uncle aunt or
[1:57] grandmother grandfather somebody like
[2:01] that and if you'll trace it back down
[2:03] through your life you'll find now I've
[2:05] taken this by experience under
[2:09] discernment because I have met cases on
[2:12] the platform thousands of those that had
[2:15] that Spirit and the first thing you know
[2:18] I chased that Spirit right back by
[2:21] discernment and find that there was a
[2:24] granddaddy there was a grandmother there
[2:26] was somebody else back down there and
[2:29] you inherit that by Nature so it's true
[2:32] it comes by inheritance by nature but
[2:35] now he's tracing it down now now he find
[2:38] out where it come through granddaddy had
[2:40] it it come through by Nature so you have
[2:43] it and now how do we deal with it and he
[2:46] says so
[2:49] stubbornness stubborn stubbornness is
[2:52] not of God and the only way to get away
[2:55] from this is you have to have faith to
[2:57] overcome that that you you are a
[3:00] Christian you are a son or daughter of
[3:03] God whichever you may be and you'll
[3:06] never be able just to stand and rebuke
[3:09] it and rebuke it and rebuke it it's just
[3:12] like tantalizing a rattlesnake he's
[3:14] laying there ready to bite you if you'll
[3:17] just ignore him and walk away from him
[3:21] he can't hurt you see so when you feel
[3:25] that you got a stubborn Spirit lay the
[3:29] thing on the alar and believe God the
[3:32] thing is dead and you'll never have it
[3:34] no more go on and don't even pay any
[3:37] attention to it no more and the thing
[3:40] will leave you resist the devil and
[3:43] he'll flee from you let's get away
[3:45] quickly so that's would be my advice how
[3:49] to overcome it we overcome the Devil by
[3:54] faith that's what we overcome all evil
[3:58] is by faith Faith how many can say Amen
[4:01] to that how do we overcome all evil by
[4:06] faith my goodness what if he would have
[4:09] said
[4:09] stubbornness is from from all the
[4:13] Capricorns or the
[4:15] Tauruses or the
[4:17] Geminis what if he would have did that
[4:19] to us he' be like oh man but
[4:22] stubbornness is not from God we like to
[4:25] do that say where where was you born I
[4:27] know what you up toil you now we do it
[4:31] no matter we when he traces it down you
[4:34] find out you got a stubborn Spirit then
[4:36] you got to deal with it how do you deal
[4:38] with it by
[4:41] faith that's how you deal with all evil
[4:44] you don't make excuses for it you don't
[4:46] pet it you deal with it by faith now
[4:49] praise the Lord thank God for his word
[4:53] amen
[4:55] amen stubbornness is not of
[4:58] God Satan wants you to be stubborn
[5:01] that's right he wants you to have a
[5:03] stiff you don't want you to bend he
[5:05] wants you to do it your way huh when you
[5:09] get married and you have kids and that
[5:11] stubborn Spirit rise up you going to
[5:14] have a battle
[5:15] bro you going to have a battle
[5:18] sis you get two stubborn ones in the
[5:20] house be locking horns all
[5:24] night but God have mercy on
[5:27] us y'all know what I'm talking about
[5:29] yeah yes yes stubborn no I'm just not
[5:33] you know and you know but you know we
[5:35] want to get rid of that we don't want we
[5:37] don't want that taking over we don't
[5:39] want those Spirits my pride getting into
[5:41] it I don't have to be right that's right
[5:44] I want the Holy Spirit working through
[5:46] me and I want to get and overcome that
[5:49] by
[5:51] faith now
[5:53] this
[5:55] um this Ephesians chapter 6 as as the
[6:00] Apostle Paul is bringing this H H uh the
[6:06] the the the armor of God put on the
[6:09] whole armor of God and then at the end
[6:11] of the verse there he says and praying
[6:15] always Ephesians 6
[6:18] quickly and so he puts in this whole
[6:21] armor of God he puts you know the helmet
[6:24] The Shield the sword the with your feet
[6:27] covered the breastplate your loins
[6:30] you're completely covered and then Verse
[6:33] 18 says praying
[6:36] always with all prayer and
[6:39] supplications in the spirit and watching
[6:43] there unto with all
[6:45] perseverance and supplication for All
[6:49] Saints and then he says and for me that
[6:53] utterance may be given unto me that I
[6:56] may open my mouth boldly
[7:00] to make known The Mystery of the gospel
[7:04] for which I am an ambassador in my
[7:07] bonds oh my what a prayer Lord if the
[7:12] Saints would pray for me that I would
[7:15] open my mouth when I ought to and be
[7:18] bold with these things of God if the
[7:22] Lord would open the mouth of the
[7:24] brothers that handled the word that they
[7:26] would be bold with it amen
[7:30] praying always as we take this whole
[7:33] armor of God now these Spirits as we
[7:38] talked
[7:38] about and as we know and we've
[7:41] identified the spirits that are for our
[7:43] on our city and many other cities too
[7:46] but this is what what he brought out for
[7:48] our city and we see that one of the
[7:50] things he talked about was this proel
[7:53] liting and the competition between
[7:56] others and I I stopped here with this
[8:01] um brother Walker's dream this morning
[8:04] and maybe I won't get to it tonight I'll
[8:06] just close right here prepare to close
[8:08] here back in the message
[8:11] Paradox now this message Paradox as he
[8:14] was bringing this uh to the people
[8:19] 1961 he said that he was on sitting on a
[8:23] narrow Highway with a brother and you
[8:26] get a chance go get that it's in the
[8:28] paradox
[8:30] December 12th 1961 he explains this
[8:34] spiritual happening to him I believe it
[8:37] happens for us he recorded it for us to
[8:39] hear it he's sitting on a narrow Highway
[8:42] with a brother he said everybody was
[8:45] afraid and then a voice said to him in
[8:49] paragraph number 60 it says he heard
[8:53] that voice say there is such danger in
[8:58] these days
[9:00] there's a great hideous thing that's
[9:03] death when it strikes you I wonder
[9:07] Saints brother George as you travel and
[9:10] you cross and you see you hear different
[9:13] you're in contact with many other
[9:15] congregations and people I wonder if
[9:18] this is what has happened with many of
[9:20] the people that have fallen a away have
[9:23] they been struck by this
[9:28] Mamba and brother Brandon brings it to
[9:30] us that there's great danger in these
[9:33] days the voice says there is such danger
[9:37] in these days there's a great hideous
[9:40] thing that's death when it strikes you
[9:44] Oh my he so he's on this narrow Highway
[9:47] with this Brethren and he said that the
[9:49] sin represents sin and
[9:53] death and then this thing tried to
[9:55] approach him one way and then he tries
[9:57] to come and get him another way
[9:59] and then finally it goes after his
[10:02] friend this brother that was with him
[10:05] and his brother was screaming and
[10:07] jumping and trying to not get bit by
[10:10] this black
[10:11] mamba this Death Strike he was trying to
[10:15] stay he was on a narrow Highway trying
[10:18] to save his life that's like you or I
[10:22] you know this hour that we're living is
[10:23] a very serious hour and people are
[10:26] getting struck all the time you wonder
[10:29] where where they got struck at they come
[10:30] back with a bad Spirit on them and they
[10:32] have a different idea towards the
[10:34] message and the messenger and the
[10:36] landscape today is not what it was 20
[10:39] years ago I guarantee you these
[10:41] attitudes these flexes against the
[10:44] message it's just that we haven't seen
[10:47] it before and where did it come from but
[10:49] here's a spiritual dream that the
[10:52] prophet gives to us and tells us about
[10:55] this black mamba he's on the narrow road
[10:58] there and trying to strike this brother
[11:00] and then he cried out Lord please save
[11:04] my brother and when he cries out for his
[11:08] brother that snake turns back to him and
[11:12] comes after him again and then the voice
[11:15] speaks to him and says you've been given
[11:17] power to bind him but you must be more
[11:23] sincere amen thank you there just then
[11:27] the serpent turned to me when I said
[11:29] that looked at me again and a voice came
[11:31] from above me and said you have been
[11:33] given power to bind him the worst or
[11:40] any and I said well God what must I
[11:43] do he said there is one thing you must
[11:47] do you must be more sincere see you must
[11:51] be more sincere I said well God forgive
[11:54] me for my
[11:56] insincerity and let me have sincerity
[11:59] when I raised up my hands to him again
[12:01] there was a great something came over me
[12:05] just lifted me up seemed like that my
[12:08] whole body was charged with something
[12:11] and I looked at the serpent and then he
[12:13] started towards me and he couldn't do it
[12:16] yet and I said Satan in the name of the
[12:19] Lord Jesus Christ I bind
[12:22] you and The Serpent and blue smoke flew
[12:24] out of him and he curled up and made
[12:27] that sign like a s capital s made
[12:29] backwards a an sign it means bind this
[12:32] one or anything below him CU he was the
[12:36] worst blue smoke fell out of him his
[12:39] tail choked his own self to death around
[12:42] his head when he made this backward s
[12:45] that an sign like a conjunction you see
[12:48] choked it to death and the brother was
[12:51] free and I went over and masked on it
[12:54] and said now I've got to find out about
[12:57] this because it's a vision and I hit on
[13:00] the one thing and it turned like that
[13:02] looked like a handle on a glass handle
[13:04] on a pitcher just made it solid Crystal
[13:07] and I said think of that how quick that
[13:09] blue smoke was life and everything it
[13:12] left it all the elements and it turned
[13:14] to Glass just then the voice came again
[13:17] and said you can unbind him also so I
[13:21] said then Satan that I might know I
[13:24] unbind you when it did he started coming
[13:27] to life again wiggling and I said said I
[13:29] bind you back in the name of Jesus
[13:31] Christ when it did the smoke flew out of
[13:33] him and again he choked himself right
[13:36] back again and turned to
[13:40] Crystal and then when he did that the
[13:42] voice says now you must be more sincere
[13:46] than what you are to do this then it
[13:49] left me and I was standing in the room a
[13:53] few minutes later the clock went off he
[13:54] says and then he says he starts to go
[13:58] through
[13:59] he picks up his Bible and he wants the
[14:03] Lord to show him what this all means he
[14:06] says I I don't do this often or he's not
[14:09] encouraging us to do it and he opens up
[14:11] his Bible and his finger falls in the
[14:15] scripture now here's our
[14:18] answer in First Corinthians chapter 5
[14:22] let's turn there we read it
[14:29] verse seven Purge out therefore the old
[14:33] leaven that you may be a new lump and as
[14:36] you are unleavened for even Christ Our
[14:39] Passover is sacrificed for us therefore
[14:42] let us keep the feast with old leaven
[14:46] neither let us keep the feast not with
[14:48] old leaven neither with the leaven of
[14:52] malice and wickedness but with the
[14:54] unleavened bread of sincerity and
[14:58] Truth now brother Rand says now he was
[15:01] coming to a
[15:03] fast and here's where he says a feast
[15:07] with the Lord is a fast in the body and
[15:10] we brought that message to the church
[15:12] here about the power of fasting didn't
[15:15] we and that is something that we can we
[15:19] can do that believers do can do that the
[15:23] fasting will help you get into the frame
[15:28] of of
[15:30] sincerity it will it will uh it's
[15:33] sobriety there because you're you're
[15:37] you're draining the body from you know
[15:40] what it would normally have and all of
[15:42] the energy for that now it goes
[15:45] spiritually towards your mind your
[15:48] thinking and in the realm of the spirit
[15:52] we know that Jesus said though said that
[15:54] there's a power in fasting and that's
[15:58] it's another level in your prayer life
[16:01] and Lord make me more sincere he was
[16:03] coming to a fast and this fasting and
[16:07] prayer is how some stubborn Devils won't
[16:11] move until you step up your prayer life
[16:15] and fasting and prayer give me a church
[16:17] that would do that give me a pastor that
[16:20] would do that give me the Deacon board
[16:23] that would do that give me the church
[16:25] that have a special meeting around that
[16:28] that's that's more powerful wouldn't you
[16:31] say but it requires a
[16:34] sacrifice it requires time it requires
[16:37] energy it's not an easy thing to do
[16:41] especially when we're eating all the
[16:42] time and all the Temptations to eat all
[16:45] the time what about a prayer meeting not
[16:49] not just daydreaming I'm talking about
[16:51] prayer in the spirit really laboring at
[16:56] the on the horns of the Altar for some
[16:59] of these stubborn devils in our midst
[17:03] some of these stubborn demons trying to
[17:05] attack our homes and our children in the
[17:09] laws in this city where our children go
[17:11] to school and all these neighborhoods
[17:14] and foolishness nextest door and
[17:16] whoever's doing what that whatever
[17:18] they're doing God give us the power to
[17:22] bind these spirits and that we can go
[17:26] free you know we can have that
[17:29] but it's going to require a sacrifice
[17:32] amen Saints it requires a bit more and
[17:36] the voice of the Lord tells the brother
[17:38] Bram you need to be more sincere you're
[17:39] not going to tell god well I was already
[17:41] sincere you're not going to do that with
[17:43] God God say you need to be more sincere
[17:46] that's what he told the prophet he don't
[17:47] know nothing to argue about it's like
[17:50] forgive me for my
[17:54] insincerity Lord help
[17:57] us now this
[17:59] this I'm going to close here this
[18:02] brother Walker's
[18:04] dream and this is what I've seen this is
[18:06] just some of my own little thoughts that
[18:08] I've seen over the years and I've seen
[18:11] it growing this competition amongst the
[18:15] churches and amongst other
[18:17] ministers but it really starts with com
[18:21] competition against brother
[18:24] brandom and this vision is showing here
[18:28] where brother brandom as a
[18:31] military prance a military horse with
[18:34] the the Indian Garb as a chief he's got
[18:38] this Authority we read it for you this
[18:39] morning remember how many remember and
[18:43] then I stopped at paragraph 261 let's
[18:45] pick it up from paragraph
[18:48] 262 and then you just you let this you
[18:52] let this Vision speak to you don't say
[18:54] don't make it say something that doesn't
[18:55] say but there is a spiritual application
[18:59] here I believe that and I know that
[19:01] Spirits don't die this little man on
[19:03] this little horse trying to knock off
[19:06] the prophet who's already been
[19:08] established I've seen that already so
[19:11] you don't have to tell me this quote
[19:12] don't mean that I've seen it with my own
[19:15] two eyes and these Spirits want to rise
[19:18] up and flex against the prophet bump him
[19:22] off of the horse well he ain't here you
[19:24] know bump him off you got a little bitty
[19:26] horse right you barely even got got a
[19:29] horse he's trying to bump the prophet
[19:32] off why did God show The Prophet this
[19:35] dream can I get into it brother Ben
[19:39] brother Ben said
[19:40] okay paragraph 262 when it did is I seen
[19:44] this man that called himself a prophet
[19:46] you know said he come up a horse that
[19:48] was mixed with white and black together
[19:51] he said he got up behind this great big
[19:54] horse said it was said way up above the
[19:57] clouds and the road wasn't over about
[20:00] that wide so you see another narrow road
[20:02] there and said the horse just danced to
[20:05] the wind blowing the feathers and
[20:07] everything on your guardar and then then
[20:11] the horse man and tail blowing Great
[20:13] Master big white horse walking right in
[20:17] line and said this guy ran up behind you
[20:21] come from towards
[20:22] Canada and the man lives in Canada he
[20:25] said come back and said he took his
[20:27] little horse trying to knock your big
[20:30] horse off turning him around make his
[20:33] hips hit against said it never moved the
[20:36] big horse he just kept
[20:39] walking he man I like that I can preach
[20:42] a sermon right there don't be moved just
[20:46] keep walking walk in the spirit my
[20:48] brother you got a vision you got a focus
[20:51] you got something to preach on preach
[20:52] that and keep walking that's it that's
[20:55] what we're doing tonight then all of a
[20:57] sudden said you turn turned around and
[20:59] said that would be the third time you
[21:01] had spoke but the second time you said
[21:03] all right and said you didn't speak like
[21:06] you did you
[21:08] commanded so you turned around and
[21:10] called The Man by name and said get off
[21:13] of here you know that a man can ride
[21:16] this road here without God be that no
[21:19] man can ride this road here without God
[21:22] be ordaining him to do it get off of
[21:26] here and so the man turned around and
[21:28] said said the man has wrote me letters
[21:30] across his horse H horse's hips the
[21:33] black and gray mixed up together said
[21:36] across his horse's hips was wrote his
[21:38] name signature just like he has on his
[21:40] letter and he wrote off towards the
[21:42] north said then you went on down that
[21:45] big horse turned around way as far west
[21:49] as you could said you stood and raised
[21:52] your

[22:54] him on a horse we know that the
[22:56] authority was given to him and this
[22:59] little Ministry tries to knock him off

[23:05] yes and guess what Saints it's going to
[23:07] continue to grow they'll Flex against
[23:10] they'll they start you know we we're not
