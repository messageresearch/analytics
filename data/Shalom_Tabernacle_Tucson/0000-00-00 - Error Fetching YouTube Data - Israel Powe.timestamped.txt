[3:58] Good morning everyone. Can we all stand?
[4:01] Welcome to Sunday school class.
[4:05] We're going to be finishing with our
[4:07] message.
[4:09] What is the Holy Ghost given for? We'll
[4:11] start at paragraph 151.
[4:14] Let's all bow our heads in prayer.
[4:17] Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful to
[4:19] be here this morning. Well, we're
[4:22] thankful for the health and strength,
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, and the Holy Ghost, Lord Jesus,
[4:27] the spirit of Christ among us. We pray,
[4:30] Father, that we'd, Lord, draw closer to
[4:33] you this day, Lord, that we'd all be a
[4:36] part of the body of Christ. Father,
[4:39] we're looking for everything that you
[4:40] have for us. Thank you, Lord, for saving
[4:43] our souls, Lord, for dying on the cross
[4:46] for us. And Lord, we look for your soon
[4:49] coming, Lord, and the resurrection.
[4:50] Lord, remember us, Father. Lord, we we
[4:54] believe according to your word, Lord.
[4:56] And Father, the things that you have
[4:58] said that we could be there,
[5:01] Lord Jesus. Be with the young people,
[5:02] Lord, in their Sunday school class also,
[5:05] Lord, and every visitor and everyone
[5:07] that may may be on the way this morning,
[5:10] Lord. our pastor, Lord, and whatever is
[5:13] you have planned for our services today,
[5:16] Lord, we pray your blessing, your
[5:18] anointing upon it. We ask it all in the
[5:21] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[5:26] Only
[5:28] believe,
[5:32] only
[5:34] believe.
[5:38] All things are possible.
[5:43] Only
[5:45] believe.
[5:49] Only
[5:50] believe.
[5:54] Only
[5:56] believe.
[6:00] All things are possible.
[6:06] only
[6:07] be.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; You may be seated, brother Brennan.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Now, a a grain of wheat or corn will
[6:18] take like Jesus said there. Of course, a
[6:21] a corn in the Bible, I was just reading
[6:22] it today, refers to flax or any kind of
[6:25] seed. But wheat, barley, lathe, or
[6:28] anything, it's a corn. But when a corn
[6:32] or wheat falls into the ground, now this
[6:34] all of us here have seen know this
[6:37] happens. A corn of wheat or a grain of
[6:40] corn can look as perfect as it can be.
[6:43] And you put it in the ground and if that
[6:45] corn it has perpetual life. It'll go
[6:49] down today, reproduce itself in a stalk
[6:52] and come back down and go up again and
[6:54] come back down. It's perpetual life. If
[6:57] that corn hasn't got the germ of life in
[7:02] it, no matter how beautiful it looks,
[7:04] it'll never raise. It'll go to the
[7:07] ground and rot and that's it. Part of
[7:10] it, the materials can be used for
[7:12] fertilizing things in the ground. But as
[7:14] far as it ever living again, it'll never
[7:16] live unless it's got perpetual life in
[7:20] it. Anyone knows that?
[7:23] &gt;&gt; You just can't. There could be two men.
[7:26] One of them just exactly both of them
[7:28] just alike. One of them can be a good
[7:30] man. He can do good works. He can do so
[7:32] forth. But except that man has
[7:37] eternal life in him.
[7:40] He'll never rise in the resurrection.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; He can't do it. There's nothing there to
[7:44] reign.
[7:46] There's nothing to bring him up. There's
[7:48] no life.
[7:49] So you see, my dear brother, my dear
[7:52] sister, except the man be born again, he
[7:56] can in no wise come back into this
[7:58] kingdom.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; He can't except this corner wheat falls
[8:03] into the ground and dies.
[8:05] He's talking of himself. But he had not
[8:08] perpetual life. He had eternal life. And
[8:11] the life he gave to you that you might
[8:13] have the same kind of life. Now, if
[8:15] you've just got human life enough to
[8:17] move you around, lust,
[8:19] she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[8:23] while she is alive.
[8:26] You can't rise. You might be the most
[8:28] popular girl in school. You might be the
[8:31] most popular girl at the card game of
[8:33] your society. You might be the best
[8:35] dressed woman in the country. You might
[8:37] be the prettiest.
[8:39] You might be the best built. You might
[8:42] be an idol to your husband. You might be
[8:45] all these things, which that's
[8:47] wonderful. But sister, unless you have
[8:52] the Holy Ghost in you, which is eternal
[8:54] life, at the end of this road, you are
[8:57] finished.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what you look like or
[9:01] how these things are, how unpopular or
[9:04] popper you are, how pretty or how ugly.
[9:06] If you've got eternal life there, you'll
[9:09] live forever and forever. When the moon
[9:12] and stars is gone and the earth has
[9:15] weeped itself into the mountains and the
[9:19] deserts and everything has has it's no
[9:22] more and the worlds are toddling like a
[9:25] drunk man coming home at night and the
[9:27] stars refuse to shine and fall from the
[9:29] heavens and the moon turns into blood
[9:31] and the the sun blushes and hides its
[9:34] face. When to see the son of man coming,
[9:36] you'll shine in the righteousness of
[9:38] Jesus Christ to come forth from the
[9:39] grave as a young beautiful woman to take
[9:42] your mate and live forever and forever
[9:45] and forever and all eternal ages you'll
[9:48] still be living.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; If you feel the least tug, don't turn it
[9:56] away.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? God in you.
[10:02] What's it for? to continue his work
[10:04] among his people to bring his church
[10:06] together to bring a church to a place in
[10:09] this day far beyond the Lutheran,
[10:11] Methodists and Pentecostals into a place
[10:14] to a adoption and a rapture grace that
[10:17] when this part of the church when the
[10:19] spirit moves into this church here,
[10:22] it'll just raise and it'll bring forth
[10:25] bring forth all of the redeemed that's
[10:29] touched that spirit. Those Lutherans who
[10:31] stood there with all the life they had
[10:33] in justification. Those Methodists that
[10:35] fell on the floor and they throw water
[10:36] in their face from the spirit strike
[10:38] them through sanctification. Those
[10:40] Pentecostals that they walked up and
[10:42] down the street and call them tongues to
[10:44] lung and oh jabbers and goose language
[10:46] and all of that. They'll stand in the
[10:49] righteousness of the sight of God at
[10:51] that day. Just as certain as this Bible
[10:53] stands here, if you believe me to be a
[10:55] servant, you call me as prophet. I don't
[10:57] call myself that. But you listen. I'm
[10:59] telling you in the name of the Lord,
[11:01] those that are in Christ will God bring
[11:05] with him at his coming at the
[11:07] resurrection. And only those that are in
[11:10] Christ. How do we get in Christ, folks?
[11:13] By one creed, we are all joined in. No.
[11:17] By one handshake, we are all pulled in.
[11:20] No. By one water, we are all baptized
[11:23] in. No. Or by one denomination, we are
[11:27] all denominated in. No, but by 1
[11:30] Corinthians 12:13, by one spirit,
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, God's spirit, we are all
[11:42] Methodist, Baptist, Luther,
[11:43] Presbyterian, walk in the light as he is
[11:47] in the light. We have fellowship one
[11:49] with another in the blood of Jesus
[11:50] Christ, God cleans us from all
[11:52] unrighteous by one spirit. We are all
[11:56] baptized into one body and been made
[11:59] partakers of his grace.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; You cannot go to judgment. He that
[12:05] heareth my words and believeth, no man
[12:07] can believe until he's got the Holy
[12:09] Ghost and believeth on him that sent me
[12:11] when the Holy Ghost has testified of his
[12:13] resurrection. Hath eternal life and
[12:17] shall never come into judgment, but has
[12:19] passed from death unto life.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; What? You'll never catch the judgment.
[12:25] You'll never stand at the white throne
[12:27] for judgment. You meet your judgment
[12:29] right here. You pass your judgment when
[12:32] you pass and say, "I'm no good and my
[12:34] learning IS NO GOOD." LORD, COME INTO ME
[12:38] AND TAKE ME AND LEAD ME, LORD. I DON'T
[12:41] CARE WHAT THIS CRAZY word says. Lead me,
[12:44] Lord. But your spirit.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; You've judged them. Judge yourself as a
[12:52] fool for Christ
[12:54] and in his righteousness that day we'll
[12:57] stand in mortal in his likeness
[13:00] &gt;&gt; only one way how by one spirit
[13:05] we are all baptized
[13:08] &gt;&gt; into one body and when you're in that
[13:11] body judgment has already judged that
[13:14] body and you've accepted him as the
[13:16] propitiation of your sins you say I've
[13:19] done that brother Brandham
[13:20] Then if the Holy Ghost has come back and
[13:23] give you a seal as a sign that spirit
[13:27] brings you into the body of Christ, you
[13:29] turn back the other way and you're a new
[13:31] creature in Christ Jesus. You pass from
[13:34] death into life. Old things IS GONE AND
[13:36] YOU ARE NEW IN CHRIST.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; OH, please let me persuade you, my
[13:45] Christian brother or sister. Don't let
[13:49] this revival pass you.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; You must receive the Holy Ghost.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; What is it? The spirit of God. What was
[13:58] it for? To lead you.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Guide you,
[14:03] &gt;&gt; fill you,
[14:05] &gt;&gt; sanctify you,
[14:07] &gt;&gt; call you out into the church. What is a
[14:10] church? What does the word church mean?
[14:12] Called out, separated.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:17] Oh, how I could take a sermon from that
[14:19] right now. Called out, separated,
[14:24] aliens away from the world, pilgrim and
[14:28] stranger,
[14:30] &gt;&gt; professing, and we have here no earthly
[14:32] city that we desire to live in.
[14:35] Oh my. As Abraham and Isaac and Jacob,
[14:40] sold dwelling in tents in the land. They
[14:44] professed and they were pilgrims and
[14:45] strangers, the seed of the air, the heir
[14:48] back there, the father of the air. We
[14:51] are their seed. And they was looking for
[14:53] a city whose builder and maker was God.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY WERE SEARCHING. AND TODAY,
[15:00] THEIR SEED IS STILL LOOKING for a city
[15:03] that comes in. I don't want to get
[15:06] adjusted in this world. I don't want
[15:08] nothing to do with this world. I want
[15:11] I'm looking for a city that's built for
[15:13] square. I'm looking for a city that's
[15:15] got eternal life where the sun will
[15:18] never go down. Where there'll never be
[15:19] old age, where there'll never be a crepe
[15:21] on a door knob or a grave ON A HILLSIDE.
[15:24] I'M LOOKING FOR THAT CITY WHO'S BUILDER
[15:27] AND MAKER of God.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to find it. There
[15:31] was a stone cut out of the mountain
[15:33] without hands. It rolled into the world
[15:35] and smashed it out and become like wheat
[15:38] or chaff on the thrashing floors. Let
[15:41] that stone to Christ Jesus, that
[15:45] stumbling stone to the world, a stone of
[15:47] an offense, a laughing stone, a
[15:50] stumbling block to the church, but a
[15:54] precious and a large stone to the
[15:57] believer. Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; A stone
[16:00] of assurance, a stone of rest.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my resting. I know that I have passed
[16:10] from death unto life. My soul is at
[16:13] rest. Oh, hallelujah.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all you labor and heavy
[16:16] laden, and I'll give you rest to your
[16:18] soul. a a sign.
[16:22] That's to be evil spoken of, said uh the
[16:27] prophet to Mary. It'll be a sign. Sure
[16:31] it will. But it'll be an assurance.
[16:34] It'll be a love. It'll be a
[16:37] satisfaction.
[16:39] It'll be something that you know you've
[16:40] passed from death unto life. My brother,
[16:43] my sister, as your brother,
[16:47] as your servant in Christ, let me
[16:50] persuade you as all my heart.
[16:54] Don't you let this go over your head or
[16:59] go by you or under you. Receive it into
[17:03] your heart
[17:05] &gt;&gt; and you'll be a happy person on earth.
[17:08] I'm not promising you you'll get a
[17:10] million dollars.
[17:11] No sir, brother Leo. I think there's
[17:13] been too much of that promise. Now,
[17:16] millions of dollars of things that
[17:18] different ones say if you be a
[17:19] Christian, you'll get a million dollars
[17:20] and you'll be a rich man. I'm not
[17:22] promising you nothing. I'm promising you
[17:25] this. The only thing I can promise you,
[17:27] his salvation, his grace is sufficient
[17:30] for every trial. The people at
[17:33] Pentecost, they didn't even want what
[17:35] they did have.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; I talk about millionaires.
[17:41] They didn't want what they had. Sister
[17:43] Angie,
[17:45] like hear you and Gertie sing one of
[17:46] these days. What she had homecoming week
[17:49] one of these days.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Many of them done passed across the
[17:52] border since then.
[17:55] Oh my.
[17:57] They didn't ask for great things. They
[17:59] didn't ask for money. While Peter said,
[18:02] "Silver and gold have I none, but such
[18:05] as I have, I'll give it to you."
[18:09] And I say that tonight, friends, the
[18:11] joy, the love, the assurance that I have
[18:15] of Christ and his resurrection, such as
[18:17] I have, I offer to you. I offer to you
[18:21] as God's children. And you come and stay
[18:24] at the cross if God called you. And
[18:27] don't you get up when you come tomorrow
[18:29] night, you come either to go in here and
[18:31] stay till it's over or come up and we're
[18:33] going to pray and lay hands on you. Go.
[18:35] That's the order of the Bible. Lay hands
[18:37] on them for the Holy Ghost. And then
[18:39] we're going you go to your home if you
[18:41] stay right there. If you stay all night,
[18:43] stay the next day, stay the next day,
[18:45] stay through the holiday, stay through
[18:46] the first year, stay on, stay until
[18:49] that whatever we instruct about tomorrow
[18:51] night showing you in the Bible what has
[18:53] to come will come. And when it comes,
[18:56] then there is enough devils and torment.
[18:59] You know you've passed from death into
[19:00] the life. You're a new creature in
[19:02] Christ Jesus. The joy bells of heaven
[19:05] are ringing. Brother Opel, I'm telling
[19:06] you, it just sets you a father. Here's
[19:09] an old boy sitting. You're an old
[19:10] brother of mine. That was a gangster
[19:14] &gt;&gt; walking with guns on his side looking
[19:17] for a man around the corner, somebody to
[19:19] blow their brains out. And what
[19:21] happened? One day he looked and believed
[19:25] unto
[19:26] walked on. He followed my meetings. And
[19:29] a poor guy with not enough to eat and
[19:31] laid and slept in bushes by the side of
[19:32] the tent.
[19:34] hungering and thirsting. One day the
[19:37] Holy Spirit come. Oh my brethren, it
[19:41] changed you, didn't it? It brought life
[19:44] and took death away. Hatred left and
[19:46] love come in. Oh my. Unity and strife
[19:50] all fell away. New life come in. Look
[19:53] here. Others times others. Others times
[19:55] others now through there. Oh, the joy
[19:58] bells of heaven ring. And friends,
[20:00] there's be no way for me to express it.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Listen, I might leave this. If you have
[20:07] believed my testimony as a servant of
[20:10] Christ and have tried to show you out of
[20:12] God's Bible, it's right. And if my words
[20:15] seem like they might be just a little
[20:17] strange about this, look at that picture
[20:19] in the scientific world.
[20:22] What's the fruit that this pillar of
[20:24] fire that led the children of Israel?
[20:27] What's the fruit it bears?
[20:29] Yeah.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; See what it does. What it tells. It's
[20:34] not me that speaketh. It's him that
[20:37] speaketh through you.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; It's not me that sees the vision. It's
[20:42] him that speaks through you. It's not me
[20:44] that heals the sick. It's him that's in
[20:47] you heals the sick.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; It's not me that preaches. I'm a
[20:51] backward coward and run from the very
[20:53] thought. But it's him that speaks
[20:55] through. I don't know the word, but he
[20:58] knows it. That's it. That's it. That's
[21:02] what it is. And there he is. That same
[21:05] angel of God is right here in this
[21:08] building tonight.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, how I love him. Now, how many wants
[21:16] to receive the Holy Ghost? Take the
[21:19] examination of our lives.
[21:22] How many hasn't received it and wants to
[21:24] raise up your hand? Say, "Brother Brand,
[21:26] the depths of my heart, I want to
[21:28] receive the Holy Ghost." God bless you
[21:29] everywhere. How many of you that has
[21:32] received it and would like to go like
[21:34] Acts 4 and say, "Oh Lord, oh Lord,
[21:37] stretch forth thy hand the healing,
[21:39] showing signs and wonders in the name of
[21:41] thy holy child Jesus, and give me all
[21:44] boldness and love to speak and a new
[21:47] filling."
[21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, yours mine, too, God. Give it to
[21:50] me.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us bow our heads in the
[21:54] deepest of sincerity.
[21:57] Each person holding your desire in your
[21:58] heart.
[22:00] Lord Jesus, we close this little
[22:03] gathering tonight after the fellowship
[22:06] around the word and the Holy Ghost. How
[22:09] he has blessed us and poured out into
[22:12] our hearts the oil of his word.
[22:16] There are ministers, there are men here
[22:19] that were all walks of life that's
[22:22] tasted and seen the Lord is good.
[22:25] &gt;&gt; We know what the Holy Spirit is now, a
[22:27] promise of God. It is eternal life to as
[22:31] many as believe. And we know that the
[22:34] Holy Spirit was the spirit of Jesus
[22:36] Christ sent back and he's in us today.
[22:41] As God was above us in that pillar of
[22:43] fire, then he walked with us in the a
[22:47] body that was called Emmanuel, God with
[22:51] us.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; And now he is in us by the Holy Spirit,
[22:57] God in us.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus said, "At that day, you'll
[23:02] know that I am in the Father
[23:06] &gt;&gt; and you are in me and I am in you."
[23:10] You'll understand it that day because
[23:12] you're in a world of darkness as to say
[23:14] now, but at that day you'll understand.
[23:17] Father, it could not be made plain and
[23:19] perfect because then we'd have nothing
[23:22] to have faith for. But all works of God
[23:25] is governed by faith and by faith in
[23:28] your word in the evidence of the Holy
[23:30] Spirit that we know is now. I ask that
[23:33] every hungry soul in here will be filled
[23:37] with the Holy Ghost. those who do not
[23:40] have it and are hungering for it. Just
[23:42] remember we had say to them Lord like
[23:45] this that you said blessed are you when
[23:48] you do hunger and thirst you shall be
[23:52] filled. That's a promise and it's even
[23:54] blessed to be hungering. You're blessed
[23:58] to even know that God has spoke to you
[24:01] for it said no man can come to me except
[24:03] my father draws him first. Lord, those
[24:06] who are old veterans here, they put up
[24:08] their hands. I had up mine. Oh Lord,
[24:12] give us strength. Give us power to
[24:15] stretch forth the hand of thy holy
[24:17] child, Jesus, that signs and wonders
[24:20] might be done. That it might be a deeper
[24:22] ministry, a greater thing that's ever
[24:24] happened yet. Give us boldness and love
[24:28] to speak to the people. Grant it, Lord.
[24:31] Be with us in all things we ask in Jesus
[24:34] name. And tomorrow night, Lord, may
[24:36] there come such a rushing mighty wind
[24:39] fall into this building that it'll be
[24:42] just like another day of Pentecost. The
[24:44] foundation's been laid, everything is
[24:47] ready, the ox are killed, the fatlins
[24:50] are killed, the rams are killed, the
[24:53] table is set, the guests are invited. Oh
[24:56] Lord, send a jubilee of Pentecost
[24:59] tomorrow night into this building and
[25:01] fill every soul with the baptism of the
[25:04] Holy Ghost. Granted, Father, we ask it
[25:07] in Jesus name. Amen.
[25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; We'll learn a lot of things.
[25:20] We'll have a heart
[25:23] that's made of gold
[25:26] perhaps a thousand
[25:30] strings.
[25:32] We'll sing and shout
[25:36] and dance about.
[25:38] The lamb will dry our tears.
[25:44] We'll have one home from homing.
[25:50] the first 10,000.
[25:58] Amen. The precious blood
[26:03] of God's own son
[26:06] has cleansed and sanctified.
[26:11] A wonderful
[26:14] bar his name
[26:16] and they are called the bride.
[26:20] Hallelujah.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Oh nected
[26:26] and despised.
[26:29] One day the Lord will bring
[26:33] those chosen ones
[26:37] in the gate.
[26:40] And that's where
[28:31] Heat.
[28:33] Heat.
[29:07] Hallelujah.
[29:33] Heat. Heat.
[29:54] Heat. Heat.
[31:30] Thank you.
[31:51] Heat.
[32:05] Heat.
[32:16] Hallelujah.
[33:27] Heat. Heat.
[34:11] Swing on
[34:14] a sweet cherry. Car us
[34:21] home.
[34:24] Swing home.
[34:27] Sweet cherry
[34:31] coming for to carry me home.
[34:36] Oh, I looked over Jordan and what did I
[34:42] see
[34:44] coming for to carry me home?
[34:50] A band of angels coming after me,
[34:56] coming for to carry me home.
[35:02] Swing on
[35:05] sweet cherryot
[35:09] coming for to carry me home.
[35:15] Swing more.
[35:18] Sweet cherry
[35:22] coming for to carry me home.
[35:27] Now if you get there
[35:31] before I do
[35:35] coming for to carry me home.
[35:41] Tell all my friends I'm coming to
[35:47] coming for to car me home.
[35:53] Oh swo.
[35:55] Well, let's stand as we sing it one more
[35:57] time. Chariot
[36:00] coming forth to carry me home.
[36:06] Swing low.
[36:09] Sweet cherry on
[36:13] coming forth. Sing it one more time.
[36:16] Brother Chris, will you come open our
[36:18] service with a word of prayer? Swing
[36:19] low.
[36:22] Sweet cherry
[36:26] coming for to carry me home.
[36:31] Swing more.
[36:34] Sweet
[36:36] cherry
[36:39] coming for to car me home.
[36:44] God bless you.
[36:49] Dear Lord,
[36:52] we just want to invite you to come here
[36:54] today, Lord. Just let us worship you,
[36:58] Lord.
[37:00] Dear Lord, we ask to be fed this
[37:03] morning, Lord.
[37:05] We ask that our brother Israel, Lord,
[37:08] that you'll bring a feast to this
[37:11] morning, Lord Jesus.
[37:13] Dear Lord, we love you so much. We
[37:16] desire you to be here, Lord. We just
[37:19] thank you for everything you've given
[37:21] us.
[37:23] We just thank you so much, Lord.
[37:26] Dear Lord, we just ask you to be in this
[37:28] service and encourage us, Lord.
[37:33] We all ask this in Jesus Christ's name.
[37:35] Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you mind just turn around,
[37:40] shaking hands with a few people that are
[37:42] around you this morning? Good to be
[37:43] together in the house of the Lord again
[37:45] today.
[37:57] Each time I stop and take the time to
[38:01] look around me,
[38:05] I see the sign of his appearing
[38:11] everywhere.
[38:15] The things he said would come to pass
[38:19] are now
[38:21] for us.
[38:24] And I can feel a strange excitement
[38:30] in the air. Oh, think about this. Just
[38:34] any day now.
[38:38] Our Lord is coming.
[38:43] He will be returning
[38:48] for you and me.
[38:52] Oh, I've been watching
[38:57] and I've been waiting
[39:02] just any day now.
[39:06] His face I'll see. Oh, there's a longing
[39:09] in my heart. Oh, there's a longing in my
[39:15] heart for his appearing.
[39:20] I'll gladly leave behind these trials
[39:26] here below.
[39:30] For this journey is so long and I'm so
[39:36] weery. Oh, but I still have an
[39:39] excitement this morning. I feel that I
[39:43] am so much closer home.
[39:48] Just any day. Now
[39:53] our Lord is coming.
[39:58] He will be returning
[40:02] for you and me.
[40:07] Oh, I've been watching
[40:12] and I've been waiting.
[40:16] Just any day now
[40:21] is f. Sing that chorus again as you're
[40:24] seated this morning. Just any day now,
[40:30] our Lord is coming.
[40:35] He will be returning
[40:40] for you and me.
[40:44] Oh, I've been watching
[40:49] and I've been waiting
[40:54] just any day now.
[40:58] His face I'll see.
[41:04] And it's not by might,
[41:07] it's not by power,
[41:10] but it's by my spirit,
[41:13] saith the Lord.
[41:17] It's not by might.
[41:20] It's not by power.
[41:23] But it's by my spirit,
[41:26] saith the Lord,
[41:30] that this mountain
[41:33] shall be removed.
[41:37] This mountain
[41:39] shall be removed.
[41:43] This mountain
[41:46] shall be removed
[41:50] by my spirit,
[41:52] saith the Lord. Let's sing that one more
[41:55] time. It's not by might.
[41:59] It's not by power,
[42:02] but it's by my spirit,
[42:05] saith the Lord.
[42:09] It's not by might.
[42:12] It's not by power.
[42:15] But it's by my spirit,
[42:18] saith the Lord,
[42:21] that this mountain
[42:25] shall be removed.
[42:29] This mountain
[42:31] shall be removed.
[42:35] This mountain
[42:38] shall be removed
[42:41] by my spirit,
[42:44] saith the Lord.
[42:47] And he is everything.
[42:51] He's everything to me. He is everything.
[42:58] He's everything to me. He's my father
[43:02] and my brother. My sister and my
[43:06] brother. He's everything to me.
[43:13] Yes. He's everything.
[43:17] He's everything to me.
[43:20] He's everything.
[43:23] He's everything to me. He is my father.
[43:28] He's my mother. He's my sister and my
[43:32] brother. He's everything
[43:36] to me.
[43:41] Alas, and did my savior
[43:45] bleed? And did my sorrow die?
[43:52] Would he devote that sacred
[43:58] hand for such a worm as I
[44:05] at the cross at the cross where I first
[44:09] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[44:14] rolled away.
[44:17] Oh, it was there by grace. I receive my
[44:22] sign and now I'm happy all the day.
[44:29] Was it for Christ that I have done that
[44:36] he groaned upon the tree?
[44:42] Amazing
[44:44] pity.
[44:46] Grace unknown and love beyond
[44:52] degree.
[44:54] or at the cross. At the cross where I
[44:58] first saw the light and the burden of my
[45:03] heart rolled away.
[45:06] Oh, it was there by faith. I received my
[45:12] sign and now I'm happy all the day.
[45:19] dwell by the sun in darkness high and
[45:26] shut his glory.
[45:31] When Christ the mighty maker died for
[45:38] man the creature sin.
[45:43] Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I
[45:48] first saw the light and the burden of my
[45:52] heart rolled away.
[45:56] Oh, it was there by faith. I received my
[46:01] side and now I'm happy all the day.
[46:08] I trust the grief and everything
[46:15] the debt of love I own.
[46:21] Here Lord I give myself
[46:26] away is all that I can do.
[46:33] more at the cross. At the cross where I
[46:37] first saw the light and the burden of my
[46:41] heart rolled away,
[46:45] for it was there by faith. I received my
[46:50] side and now I'm happy all the day.
[47:02] A vessel
[47:05] of honor
[47:08] for God.
[47:14] A vessel
[47:17] of honor
[47:19] for God.
[47:26] sanctified,
[47:29] holy,
[47:31] that I might be
[47:37] a vessel
[47:40] of honor
[47:43] for God. How many can you say, Lord,
[47:45] that's my desire this morning. I want to
[47:48] be a vessel
[47:52] upon earth
[47:54] for God.
[48:00] A vessel
[48:03] of honor
[48:06] for God.
[48:12] sanctified,
[48:15] holy,
[48:18] that I
[48:20] might be
[48:23] a vessel. Stand and sing it one more
[48:26] time as the brothers come for the prayer
[48:28] request.
[48:29] Oh God, Lord, a vessel for you, Lord.
[48:35] The vessel
[48:38] of honor
[48:41] for God.
[48:46] A vessel
[48:49] of water
[48:52] for God.
[48:58] sanctified,
[49:01] holy,
[49:04] that I
[49:06] might be
[49:10] a vessel
[49:13] of honor
[49:16] for God.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Good morning, saints.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good. Grateful to be in the house
[49:26] of the Lord with each one of you this
[49:28] morning. We had eight children, six
[49:31] Bibles and $4 for the offering this
[49:33] morning. A little lighter than normal.
[49:34] We're missing uh some of the crowd here,
[49:37] the Morrises. I think we're missing the
[49:38] Smiths and different ones. So, we sure
[49:40] want to hold them up in prayer. Thankful
[49:42] for our visitors this morning. Glad that
[49:44] you could be here with us. Our solid
[49:47] rock brothers there tell me they work on
[49:49] trees, but they're rocks to me,
[49:52] petrified wood. So nice to have the zinc
[49:55] this morning. Our precious sister Lori
[49:56] in the back there, she's getting along
[49:58] so much better and getting around, but
[50:00] she's got a need this morning. Want to
[50:02] hold hold up before the church. She
[50:03] says, "Please remember me in prayer as
[50:05] the coming Wednesday. I'm having a
[50:08] procedure to remove the filter that was
[50:11] in place to block blood clots. Bit
[50:14] nervous asking the Lord to be with us,
[50:16] be with the doctors and grant us peace."
[50:19] And I know the Lord would do that. She
[50:21] says, "God bless you." So certainly
[50:23] remember our precious sister Lorie Snow.
[50:25] Our precious brother Trevor Boyd is not
[50:28] feeling well. I know he's working tons
[50:29] of hours. So remember him for strength
[50:31] and the touch that he needs. Trevor this
[50:33] morning also brother Edward. Sister
[50:35] Bethany McFaten. They'll be taking the
[50:37] baby I guess to Pennsylvania. Is that to
[50:39] see the parents? Is that where your
[50:41] parents are? So we want to remember them
[50:43] this week as they take that long journey
[50:45] with the baby. Would you do that this
[50:47] week for these saints? A few of you
[50:49] will. That'd be good. and the rest of
[50:51] you will remind you. Uh there's a uh
[50:54] just to mention those that are some
[50:56] missing seats. So if you see a missing
[50:58] seat, just remember those around you
[51:00] this morning as we approach the Lord.
[51:02] Dear God, we're so thankful to be in
[51:04] church this morning. Lots of things we
[51:06] could be doing, Lord. But as this song
[51:09] we were just singing says, we want to be
[51:11] an honor to you and just submit to you,
[51:14] Lord. The other songwriter says,
[51:16] "Whatever it takes, Lord, to be more
[51:18] like you, that's what I'll be willing to
[51:20] do." Oh, God. That's the desire of our
[51:22] heart this morning. Help us to have that
[51:24] desire, that one true desire, God.
[51:27] Whatever it takes to be more like you,
[51:29] Lord, we know you're going to bring the
[51:31] word through our precious brother Israel
[51:33] this morning. May our ears be ready to
[51:35] hear from heaven. Maybe it's something
[51:37] different than we've heard before. Maybe
[51:39] we don't completely understand, but we
[51:42] know there will be a nugget for us this
[51:43] morning if we just be attentive, Lord,
[51:46] and ready to hear from heaven. So, help
[51:48] our hearts to be open to that this
[51:50] morning. We appreciate the touch that
[51:52] you've given us, Lord, in our family.
[51:55] Sister Tila, we see here, Lord,
[51:57] different ones that have been in the
[51:58] battle, Lord, a physical battle. We know
[52:00] there are financial and other troubles
[52:03] and political seasons, but we don't
[52:06] aren't distracted by that today. We're
[52:08] just focused on the word and whatever it
[52:10] takes to be more like you. Lord, help us
[52:12] to do that this morning as we collect
[52:14] tithes and offerings. Lord, a sacrifice,
[52:16] another sacrifice of praise, we bring to
[52:18] you the little that we can and knowing
[52:20] that you will magnify it, grow it, Lord,
[52:22] for the kingdom of God. As we bring it
[52:24] cheerfully this morning, we thank you
[52:26] for it. Precious name of our Lord and
[52:28] Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. All God's
[52:30] people say
[52:49] I need.
[52:52] I need thee
[52:55] every
[52:57] hour. I need thee.
[53:01] Oh, bless
[53:03] me now, my savior.
[53:07] I come
[53:09] to thee.
[53:13] I need
[53:15] thee. Oh, I need thee.
[53:20] Every
[53:21] hour I need thee, oh,
[53:27] and now my Savior,
[53:31] I come
[53:33] to thee,
[53:41] Jesus,
[53:43] you're the sweetest name of all,
[53:49] Jes. Jesus,
[53:52] you always hear me when I call.
[53:57] Oh Jesus,
[54:00] you pick me up each time I fall.
[54:05] You're the sweetest,
[54:07] the sweetest name. Let's tell him that
[54:11] again.
[54:14] Jesus,
[54:17] you're the sweetest name of all.
[54:22] Jesus,
[54:25] you always hear me when I call.
[54:31] Jesus,
[54:33] you pick me up each time I fall.
[54:38] You're the sweetest,
[54:41] the sweetest name of all. Oh, I love to
[54:45] praise your name, Jesus.
[54:51] How I love to praise your name.
[54:56] Jesus,
[54:58] you're still the first, the last, the
[55:02] same.
[55:04] Oh Jesus,
[55:07] you died and took away my shame. You're
[55:12] the sweetest,
[55:14] the sweetest name of all. He's my soon
[55:18] and coming king. Oh Jesus,
[55:24] you're the soon and coming king.
[55:29] Oh Jesus,
[55:32] we need the love that you can bring.
[55:37] Oh Jesus,
[55:41] we lift our voices up and sing.
[55:46] You're the sweetest,
[55:48] the sweetest name.
[55:52] That last the first verse one more time.
[55:54] You're the sweetest name of all.
[55:58] You are the sweetest name of all.
[56:03] Jesus,
[56:06] you always hear me when I call.
[56:11] Jesus,
[56:15] pick me up each time I fall.
[56:19] You're the sweetest,
[56:22] sweetest name of all.
[56:26] Amen. And you can be seated if you like.
[56:33] Out on the
[56:37] storms raging high,
[56:40] the waters around them. They were
[56:45] troubled that night.
[56:49] Fear filled their hearts
[56:52] and they thought they would die.
[56:57] They failed to remember
[57:00] that the master was nine.
[57:05] But he spoke the words
[57:09] and the winds all stood still.
[57:14] Even the waters
[57:17] they oyed his will
[57:21] and he calmed their storms
[57:26] just like he will mind
[57:29] if I just remember
[57:33] that he lives deep inside.
[57:37] Also why should I worry?
[57:42] Why should I fear
[57:46] when this very same Jesus,
[57:50] he stays always near.
[57:54] He lives in my heart
[57:58] and he hears when I cry.
[58:02] I call on his name
[58:06] till the storm passes by.
[58:10] But read in the Bible
[58:14] how he walked with them,
[58:18] brought light to their darkness
[58:22] when the way grew on him.
[58:26] How great it would be
[58:30] to have his steps leading mine
[58:34] and to walk with the master.
[58:39] all of the time. Oh, so when trials come
[58:46] and death seems so nice,
[58:50] I'll just call on the master.
[58:54] I know we'll get there on time.
[58:59] And when sickness comes
[59:02] and my body is in pain,
[59:07] all I have to do
[59:10] is just call on his name.
[59:15] So why should I worry?
[59:19] Why should I fear
[59:22] when the very same Jesus
[59:27] stays always near?
[59:31] He lives in my heart
[59:35] and he hears when I cry.
[59:39] Call on his name
[59:43] till the storm passes by. Oh, and why
[59:48] should I worry?
[59:51] Why should I fear
[59:55] when this very same Jesus,
[59:59] he stays always near.
[1:00:03] He lives in my heart
[1:00:07] and he hears when I cry.
[1:00:11] I call on his name
[1:00:15] till the storm passes by.
[1:00:28] It's beginning to rain rain.
[1:00:33] Hear the voice of the father
[1:00:39] sing. And whosoever
[1:00:43] will come drink of this water,
[1:00:49] I promise to pour my spirit out on your
[1:00:54] sons and your daughters.
[1:00:58] So if you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[1:01:03] the sky. It's beginning to rain.
[1:01:10] The turtle dove is singing his sweet
[1:01:15] song of morning.
[1:01:20] All the leaves of the trees turn their
[1:01:23] silver cups to the sky.
[1:01:30] The silent clouds above are beginning to
[1:01:35] gather.
[1:01:40] The bear and land is thirsty. Lord, so
[1:01:45] am I.
[1:01:48] But it's beginning to rain. Rain, rain.
[1:01:53] Hear the voice of the father.
[1:01:58] He's saying, "Whoever
[1:02:02] will come drink of this water,
[1:02:08] I promise to pour my spirit out on your
[1:02:14] sons and your daughters.
[1:02:18] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[1:02:22] the sky.
[1:02:23] beginning to rain. At the first drop of
[1:02:26] rain.
[1:02:29] Well, at the first drop of rain that you
[1:02:32] feel, bro.
[1:02:38] Go call all your children together and
[1:02:43] throw wide the door.
[1:02:48] And when the rains of the spirit are
[1:02:52] fallen, Lord, fill every vessel.
[1:02:58] For he who drinks his f will thirst no
[1:03:04] more.
[1:03:07] It's beginning to rain, rain, rain. Hear
[1:03:12] the voice of the father.
[1:03:17] He's saying, "Whosoever
[1:03:21] will come drink of this water?"
[1:03:26] For I promise to pour my spirit out on
[1:03:32] your sons and your daughters.
[1:03:36] If you're thirsty and dry, look up to
[1:03:40] the sky. It's beginning to rain.
[1:03:54] You can say, "Lord, that's my desire
[1:03:55] this morning.
[1:03:57] Just more
[1:03:59] of you.
[1:04:05] I've had it all,
[1:04:09] but what I need
[1:04:13] is more of you.
[1:04:20] of things
[1:04:22] I've had my fear
[1:04:27] and yet
[1:04:30] I hunger
[1:04:32] still
[1:04:36] empty and bare.
[1:04:40] Lord hear my prayer
[1:04:43] for more of you.
[1:04:49] will let the musicians play in it. Lord,
[1:04:52] that's my desire this morning. More of
[1:04:55] you.
[1:04:58] He's all that matters. Does it matter
[1:05:00] what this world has to offer us?
[1:05:03] What good does it do us if we gain the
[1:05:05] whole world, but we don't have him?
[1:05:07] Lord, we need more of you this morning.
[1:05:10] Fill us, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, that's our desire today.
[1:05:19] Come and fill every vessel this morning,
[1:05:21] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:05:25] Blessed be your name. Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:33] Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] Amen.
[1:09:17] God bless you saints.
[1:09:19] Let us pray.
[1:09:21] Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless
[1:09:25] this portion of the service Lord as we
[1:09:28] come as humble as we uh know how Lord to
[1:09:34] ask you to cover us with your precious
[1:09:36] blood Lord. And may we approach
[1:09:40] uh this portion of the service with all
[1:09:43] sincerity.
[1:09:45] Oh God, if there be anything in us that
[1:09:47] is needs correcting, please Lord have
[1:09:51] your way in our in our lives. Lord,
[1:09:54] don't let us be arrogant or resistant
[1:09:59] to the moving of your precious Holy
[1:10:01] Ghost.
[1:10:02] Father, help us to get out of the way,
[1:10:04] Lord, and to come into your presence and
[1:10:08] then reap the benefits of coming in your
[1:10:12] presence. Bless everyone that's gathered
[1:10:15] here today. Bless the Saints and Mesa
[1:10:17] and those that could not be here.
[1:10:20] Father, we just give you all the praise
[1:10:21] and all the glory. In the mighty name of
[1:10:24] Jesus Christ, we ask these blessings.
[1:10:27] Amen.
[1:10:29] God bless each of you. We're so happy to
[1:10:32] be in the house of the Lord with you
[1:10:33] today. It's always a privilege to be in
[1:10:36] the find oursel in the house of the Lord
[1:10:39] to praise him. Amen. We like to welcome
[1:10:43] all of our visitors. And brother um Ben
[1:10:47] has a in the back there a gentleman here
[1:10:50] for the first time. We'd like to welcome
[1:10:51] him. Um and his name is brother Isaac
[1:10:58] Isaac Jimmerson. So we like to welcome
[1:11:01] you my brother. Happy that you made it
[1:11:03] to House of the Lord. Also the Zincas
[1:11:06] Tom and Tommy Zinca. Good to have them
[1:11:09] always. And and I think the Dinguals are
[1:11:13] leaving sometime soon. And we just pray
[1:11:16] that not that we want you to leave soon,
[1:11:18] but that the Lord will uh just bless
[1:11:21] them. They've just been just a
[1:11:23] tremendous help to we can't thank them
[1:11:25] enough. Amen. and we certainly
[1:11:27] appreciate them and each and every one
[1:11:30] of you. Um, this morning
[1:11:34] just before we go into the word, I think
[1:11:37] we've done all of our announcements and
[1:11:40] so forth and so I'll take a little time
[1:11:42] to um,
[1:11:46] so I think I got all the visitors,
[1:11:47] right? Yes. All right. just to take a
[1:11:51] little time to
[1:11:53] uh
[1:11:55] give you a little bit what's the desire
[1:11:57] on my heart um as we move forward in our
[1:12:04] service to the Lord particularly
[1:12:07] as it pertains to this church obviously
[1:12:10] um we have normally we have it our adult
[1:12:13] Sunday school class and that is a
[1:12:17] usually a series on the Holy Ghost or
[1:12:19] the church ages or something like
[1:12:21] questions and answers. And at the end of
[1:12:24] those, I'd like to
[1:12:27] have one Sunday school, adult Sunday
[1:12:29] school where we would bring all those
[1:12:31] things together. And so, um, just to
[1:12:36] make it like a Sunday school, just to
[1:12:38] recap what we heard, we've taken 15
[1:12:41] minutes or 20 minutes of the tape
[1:12:45] um through those series. I think we were
[1:12:48] in the Holy Ghost and we're just coming
[1:12:49] to the end of the uh what was it given
[1:12:52] for what it is and then um there'll be
[1:12:57] some other messages that we'll bring on
[1:12:59] the Holy Ghost like um the new birth and
[1:13:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will
[1:13:05] be playing for you. Um but we'd like you
[1:13:09] to be involved in that. And so um at the
[1:13:15] end of those series, we'll have one of
[1:13:18] the brothers to or myself to just take
[1:13:22] and bring those together like uh an
[1:13:26] adult Sunday school class just a
[1:13:28] teaching for 15 or 20 minutes bringing
[1:13:30] it all together and we'll try that. So
[1:13:34] that means the brothers who teach it
[1:13:36] have to know what they're teaching. And
[1:13:40] um
[1:13:41] if you've been in the word for any any
[1:13:43] amount of time, if you are a brother or
[1:13:46] man, actually all believers are
[1:13:48] commanded to study the scripture. It's
[1:13:51] not just preachers.
[1:13:53] study the scripture so that you would be
[1:13:58] wise that there's wisdom in the
[1:14:00] scripture that you be a workman that not
[1:14:03] be ashamed.
[1:14:05] So if you don't study it is a shame and
[1:14:08] it would be a shame on you to be walking
[1:14:11] in this truth for any amount of time and
[1:14:14] you should be able to be a teacher but
[1:14:17] not quite capable of doing that simply
[1:14:20] because you don't study. I think that um
[1:14:24] that is and I have all the scriptures on
[1:14:26] that too, but that's what we like to do
[1:14:29] and also take a a hard look in and our
[1:14:33] prayer towards our music and the
[1:14:35] ministry of music here as we have it set
[1:14:39] here. The Lord has blessed us with many
[1:14:40] fine gifts in music and singing and the
[1:14:45] ministry of music and the the the
[1:14:48] song leaders and so forth and all the
[1:14:51] instruments that are being played that
[1:14:54] um you know those meetings that will be
[1:14:57] coming forward whoever would be in
[1:15:00] charge of those or bringing those
[1:15:02] forward those musicians we like you to
[1:15:04] be uh really involved in that starting
[1:15:08] with prayer.
[1:15:09] and asking God to um to really reveal to
[1:15:14] you the purpose of a ministry of music
[1:15:18] and really reveal to you what a gift is.
[1:15:21] And we've been talking about the gifts
[1:15:23] and those gifts are not for you. They're
[1:15:26] for the body of Christ. Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; And God gives them to you for that
[1:15:31] purpose.
[1:15:33] also with their sound and video and I
[1:15:37] just call it the recording ministry
[1:15:39] whether it's video whether it's audio
[1:15:41] whether it's streaming whatever it is
[1:15:43] that is a ministry and the Holy Spirit
[1:15:47] has to be with you when you're doing
[1:15:50] that I believe that with all my heart
[1:15:52] it's it's not just a secondary
[1:15:55] last minute thing I believe that it's
[1:15:58] the Holy Spirit and if Um,
[1:16:03] if we put our hearts towards that, I
[1:16:05] believe the Lord will bless us as we
[1:16:06] respect it.
[1:16:09] The ministry of missionary,
[1:16:11] the work of witnessing to the lost,
[1:16:15] particularly right here in this little
[1:16:18] church here. There's a quotation as
[1:16:20] we'll take Ephesians chapter 4 in just a
[1:16:23] moment that God placed in the church
[1:16:26] apostles, prophets, teachers,
[1:16:27] evangelists, pastors for the perfecting
[1:16:31] of the body. That
[1:16:34] gift or missionary is the apostle
[1:16:38] ministry. And brother Brandham says you
[1:16:41] don't even have to be a minister to be a
[1:16:44] missionary. There's a quote for that.
[1:16:48] And you're always in the will of God
[1:16:50] when you are on the mission field. So
[1:16:53] where does that place all of us in a
[1:16:56] sense? A missionary means one scent.
[1:16:59] Apostle means one scent. And so we think
[1:17:02] of an apostle as a minister. He's a
[1:17:05] called minister. But brother Vanam
[1:17:07] simply clears that up for us. help us
[1:17:09] open it up a little bit more that a
[1:17:11] missionary is one that is sent and that
[1:17:14] each and every one of us should have a
[1:17:16] ministry to witness the lost.
[1:17:20] Also, the ministry brother Ezekiel is
[1:17:23] not here today. He's in uh in Mesa.
[1:17:27] Greet him and his family. And happy
[1:17:28] birthday to all of those fine people
[1:17:31] that have a birthday in January.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Should I call them out?
[1:17:37] Okay, I'll call him out.
[1:17:40] Sister Troutman, she had a birthday over
[1:17:43] there. Yes, getting younger all the
[1:17:46] time. Lily Osor Neo, Sister Lily, I
[1:17:51] don't know where she is. Lulu Hernandez.
[1:17:53] Sister Lulu and Mesa. Brother Edward
[1:17:57] McFaten. God bless him.
[1:18:00] Nathaniel Robson, the young soldier.
[1:18:03] Where's Nathaniel? There he is. young
[1:18:06] soldier coming up, Jonathan Gonzalez.
[1:18:09] All these fine people had a birthday in
[1:18:11] January. So, don't let me miss February,
[1:18:16] okay? Cuz they all the rest of the
[1:18:19] months. But what was I saying is that um
[1:18:24] the Spanish ministry to the Spanish and
[1:18:27] that language and being uh able to
[1:18:31] minister to those that we they we want
[1:18:35] them to hear the message to and brother
[1:18:37] Ezekiel is dedicated to that. We
[1:18:39] appreciate his hard work and service
[1:18:41] there. And so just pray for that. had
[1:18:45] something on my heart in regards to that
[1:18:47] for several months and um but we'll pray
[1:18:51] that the Lord will continue to bless
[1:18:53] that there's a few saints here that need
[1:18:56] the interpretation and brother Ezekiel
[1:18:58] is not here but sister Norma is pretty
[1:19:00] good at understanding and then so forth.
[1:19:03] Amen. So those are some of the
[1:19:05] directions we want you to continue to
[1:19:07] pray with us about as we continue to
[1:19:09] move forward in the service to the Lord.
[1:19:12] Amen.
[1:19:14] Now,
[1:19:16] we like to go into the scripture and
[1:19:18] I've tried to um just really try to find
[1:19:23] the mind of the Lord and the direction
[1:19:26] to continue to go in and we're still
[1:19:30] speaking on these gifts. And the
[1:19:33] scripture says to be not ignorant
[1:19:37] concerning spiritual gifts. So, we'll
[1:19:39] just take Ephesians chapter 4. We'll
[1:19:41] have you stand and we'll read that along
[1:19:45] with Psalms 68.
[1:20:06] Ask the Lord to bless the brethren that
[1:20:08] did the to do the harmony. Brother uh
[1:20:12] brother George Moore and the saints at
[1:20:16] at Phoenix Tabernacle
[1:20:19] just doing something to help the saints
[1:20:21] and we pray that the Lord will
[1:20:24] has blessed that. I know that service
[1:20:26] last night. So anything to help the
[1:20:29] people of God, we want to
[1:20:34] we want to do that. Ephesians chapter 4
[1:20:38] verse number five, but unto every one of
[1:20:41] us is given grace according to the
[1:20:43] measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore
[1:20:47] he saith when he ascended upon high,
[1:20:51] he led captivity captive, and he gave
[1:20:53] gifts unto men. Now that he ascended,
[1:20:57] what is it but that he also descended
[1:21:00] first into the lower parts of the earth?
[1:21:03] He that descended is the same also that
[1:21:06] ascended up far above all heavens that
[1:21:09] he might fill all things. And he gave
[1:21:15] some apostles, some prophets, some
[1:21:18] evangelists, some pastors and teachers
[1:21:22] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[1:21:24] the work of the ministry, for the
[1:21:27] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[1:21:31] all come in the unity of the faith and
[1:21:33] of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto
[1:21:36] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[1:21:39] stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:21:43] that we would what henceforth be no more
[1:21:48] children
[1:21:50] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:21:54] every wind of doctrine by the slate of
[1:21:56] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[1:22:00] lie wait lie wait
[1:22:02] they lie in wait to deceive but speaking
[1:22:07] the truth in love. Amen. Psalm 68.
[1:22:23] You have that. You can say amen.
[1:22:30] Verse 18.
[1:22:33] This is a song of King David.
[1:22:37] And King David was anointed to write
[1:22:41] these psalms.
[1:22:43] Actually, he come under the great spirit
[1:22:46] of God. And God gave him words and they
[1:22:51] look just like words maybe, but that
[1:22:54] inspiration has carried through. They
[1:22:57] were recorded and they're the songs.
[1:22:59] They're the psalms. Jesus quoted from
[1:23:02] them. And and I believe this is where
[1:23:05] the scripture that the apostle Paul is
[1:23:07] quoting that we just read in Ephesians.
[1:23:11] Thou has ascended on high. Thou has led
[1:23:15] captivity captive. Thou has received
[1:23:18] gifts for men. Yeah. For the rebellious
[1:23:21] also that the Lord God might dwell
[1:23:25] among them. Amen. We'll take one more
[1:23:28] scripture. I wasn't going to read it but
[1:23:30] just comes on my mind. in Genesis 18
[1:23:33] quickly.
[1:23:59] And Verse
[1:24:05] number one. And the Lord appeared unto
[1:24:07] him, talking about Abram,
[1:24:10] in the plains of Mamra, and he sat in
[1:24:12] the tent door in the heat of the day. He
[1:24:15] lift up his eyes and looked. And lo,
[1:24:18] three men stood by him. And when he saw
[1:24:20] them, he ran to meet them from the tent
[1:24:23] door. He bowed himself toward the ground
[1:24:27] and said, "My Lord, if now I have found
[1:24:31] favor in thy sight, pass not away, I
[1:24:34] pray thee, from thy servant."
[1:24:39] Continue to read the scripture. He's now
[1:24:41] making food for these angels. This one
[1:24:44] is the Lord that he addresses.
[1:24:47] And then the angel asked this question
[1:24:50] in verse number nine. And they said unto
[1:24:52] him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he
[1:24:56] said, Behold, in the tent, and he said,
[1:24:59] I will certainly return unto thee
[1:25:01] according to the time of life, and lo,
[1:25:04] Sarah, thy wife shall have a son. And
[1:25:07] Sarah heard it in the tent door, which
[1:25:09] was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah
[1:25:13] were old and wellstricken in age, and it
[1:25:16] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:25:19] of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within
[1:25:22] herself, saying, After I am waxed old,
[1:25:26] shall I have pleasure, my lord being old
[1:25:28] also? And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[1:25:32] Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall
[1:25:35] I of short bear a child, which him owed?
[1:25:40] Is anything too hard for the Lord? At
[1:25:43] the time appointed, I will return unto
[1:25:45] thee according to the time of life, and
[1:25:48] Sarah shall have a son.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not,
[1:25:55] for she was afraid. And he said, No,
[1:25:58] nay, but thou this laugh. Let us pray.
[1:26:03] Lord Jesus, bless your word. Bless the
[1:26:06] reading. Bless the speaking and the
[1:26:08] hearing of your word. In Jesus name we
[1:26:11] pray. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[1:26:14] seated.
[1:26:17] Now, these gifts as we have uh been
[1:26:21] going through them and we just kind of
[1:26:25] in brought the introduction a couple of
[1:26:28] services back and we laid out a bunch of
[1:26:31] things where the prophet of God talks
[1:26:34] about these gifts, what they are, what
[1:26:37] they are not. And the scriptures in
[1:26:40] Romans 11:29 tells us that gifts and
[1:26:43] callings come without repentance.
[1:26:47] Psalm 68 says, "He ascended up on high
[1:26:50] and he gave gifts for men, even the
[1:26:54] rebellious."
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; So good people, bad people, young
[1:26:59] people, old people, no matter what kind
[1:27:01] of people, people that go to church,
[1:27:03] people that love God, people that don't
[1:27:04] go to church, people that don't love God
[1:27:07] have gifts.
[1:27:09] You're born with them. It's part of the
[1:27:12] human being. In fact, I can't see
[1:27:16] anywhere in the scriptures where there
[1:27:19] is a human being that does not have an
[1:27:23] attribute of a gift that comes from the
[1:27:26] great creator, our heavenly father. Man
[1:27:29] is his greatest creation. And in that
[1:27:32] creation, he puts gifts into each
[1:27:34] individual. And we're none of us are the
[1:27:37] same. were very different and some have
[1:27:40] different gifts for different purposes
[1:27:42] and different reasons.
[1:27:44] And um the general thought of gifts that
[1:27:48] God gives, you know, like salvation, the
[1:27:51] Holy Spirit, grace, all the life, all
[1:27:56] those gifts are for humanity to receive
[1:27:59] and enjoy those if you receive them.
[1:28:03] Then apart from those gifts, those
[1:28:05] general gifts, there are individual
[1:28:07] gifts that each individual would have in
[1:28:10] their life. A talent, uh we would call
[1:28:13] it uh an ability, an aptitude towards
[1:28:16] something that you're just made that
[1:28:18] way. There was nothing you did to put it
[1:28:21] there. It was there from the very
[1:28:25] beginning. Amen.
[1:28:28] But then in the scriptures, it's very
[1:28:30] clear that God has set gifts in the
[1:28:35] church for the edification of that
[1:28:38] church. He put them in there. And if you
[1:28:42] take 1 Corinthians chapter 12, 13, and
[1:28:45] 14, it gives you kind of a a sense of
[1:28:49] what those gifts are and what the
[1:28:52] purpose of them are.
[1:28:54] Corinthians 13 stops almost and then
[1:28:57] drops in there. Love is above everything
[1:29:02] and without it none of the gifts even
[1:29:04] matter and God is love. Amen.
[1:29:09] And so it's the approach that we would
[1:29:12] want to look at and take that you
[1:29:15] sitting here today under the sound of my
[1:29:18] voice, you have a gift that came from
[1:29:21] God.
[1:29:23] It's beautiful.
[1:29:26] It is tremendous
[1:29:29] when you realize that the gift that you
[1:29:32] have is not from some university
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; or the race that you were born in.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Actually, the gift came from God.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And he gave it to you for a purpose.
[1:29:49] You're sitting right here with it.
[1:29:51] Whether you realize it or not, whether
[1:29:52] you're using it or not, whether it's
[1:29:54] misappropriated or not, God gives you
[1:29:57] those gifts. He don't take them away.
[1:30:00] Now, those gifts are placed into the
[1:30:02] body for the purpose of God being
[1:30:06] magnified, for you growing in his grace,
[1:30:09] for faith ultimately to uh come to you
[1:30:14] so that you can be ready for the rapture
[1:30:16] and the great sudden going away. these
[1:30:18] gifts and we have seen just in the
[1:30:22] service th this far a display of many
[1:30:25] gifts and talents already. You know the
[1:30:28] music program up here, the piano, the
[1:30:31] organ, the the horns, the strings,
[1:30:35] the um the drums,
[1:30:38] um you the worshipper are th those were
[1:30:43] gifts on display. The music is a gift
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; and it had a purpose why we would sing,
[1:30:51] why there is music before we come to
[1:30:53] this part of the service which is
[1:30:55] another gift as well preaching. But why
[1:30:58] the music first? What was that there
[1:31:01] for?
[1:31:03] Did you miss what the music was for?
[1:31:07] It's interesting how many people miss
[1:31:11] God's gifts.
[1:31:14] Just the greatest gift that ever came to
[1:31:16] the earth was the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:31:18] most of the people missed him. That was
[1:31:21] God made flesh
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; and they missed him.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Very very common. More common than
[1:31:29] received are the gifts that are missed.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And you think about that. God sends a
[1:31:36] gift. He sends it. It comes from heaven.
[1:31:38] It's anointed. And the people that he
[1:31:41] sends it to, they actually miss it.
[1:31:44] They miss their opportunity. It's like
[1:31:47] in the days of Noah, Noah was a gift to
[1:31:50] them people.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; If you can really look at it, Noah was a
[1:31:54] gift to his community, to everybody
[1:31:57] around him. If they would have only
[1:32:00] caught who Noah was,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; they would have got into the ark and
[1:32:04] would have been saved. But he was only
[1:32:07] able to witness to his family.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; He was only able to accomplish the the
[1:32:14] saving of his own household.
[1:32:17] He had the education. He had all of the
[1:32:20] history. He had all of the community
[1:32:22] that he was fighting against to try to
[1:32:26] get these people to see that is the
[1:32:30] grace of God that I have found in God's
[1:32:34] sight. The Bible says that Noah found
[1:32:36] grace in the sight of the Lord. He found
[1:32:39] grace. Now he's giving that grace to the
[1:32:42] people. Get into the ark.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; How many's been to the ark enclosure
[1:32:48] there in Cincinnati?
[1:32:50] It's in Ohio, Cincinnati,
[1:32:51] Jeffersonville, in that area. It's huge,
[1:32:53] isn't it?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; If you were driving by the street, the
[1:32:57] road and you missed that, it's because
[1:32:59] you were blind. It is huge. I mean you
[1:33:04] from a way in the distance. It's
[1:33:06] standing way up. You can see it from a
[1:33:09] very far distance. So it wasn't because
[1:33:11] they didn't see it. It wasn't because
[1:33:13] they didn't hear about it. They missed
[1:33:16] it for whatever reason they missed it.
[1:33:20] But when they did see it, it was too
[1:33:22] late. So there's a little window, wasn't
[1:33:24] it?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Your gift is here. Your gift is here.
[1:33:28] Your gift is here. And the door closed.
[1:33:30] And then when it closed, then everybody,
[1:33:33] oh, wait a minute. I think Noah was
[1:33:35] right. Let's go get into that ark. What
[1:33:37] he's talking about. It's raining out
[1:33:39] here. We never seen that. The clouds are
[1:33:41] dark. We never seen what's all THIS
[1:33:43] CRAZINESS GOING. WHERE'S WHERE'S HE AT?
[1:33:45] Where's he at? LET'S GO TO THE ARK NOW.
[1:33:47] WELL, it's too late.
[1:33:50] And on the day of judgment,
[1:33:53] everyone will bow their knee and confess
[1:33:56] that Jesus is the Christ. But it'll be
[1:33:58] too late, won't it? So what's the
[1:34:01] message there? The message here there is
[1:34:04] to catch the visitation of the Lord when
[1:34:08] it comes to you. Now God has visited us.
[1:34:13] Us, the people of God that have heard
[1:34:15] the voice of God. That's a visitation
[1:34:18] that God has granted to you. And you
[1:34:22] caught it. You saw it. And thank God
[1:34:25] you're in the ark Christ Jesus today.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to start with some of the
[1:34:31] quotations of the prophet here in
[1:34:34] Jehovah Gyra and say this in in I'm
[1:34:37] sorry, the angel of the Lord 1951. It
[1:34:40] says this. I'm thankful to be alive
[1:34:42] tonight.
[1:34:44] I'm thankful for the privilege to
[1:34:46] witness of my Lord the power of his
[1:34:48] resurrection. Yes. And if no one in the
[1:34:51] world ever believes it, but myself, I
[1:34:53] believe it with all my heart. But I'm
[1:34:55] thankful to give witness to tens of
[1:34:58] thousands. Yes, into the millions that
[1:35:01] believe it and believes. And I believe
[1:35:03] that God's going to let me live to pack
[1:35:06] it until all around the world it's been
[1:35:09] circulated. I believe when I get into
[1:35:12] those dark lands of Africa over there
[1:35:14] where those poor people that's deprived
[1:35:16] and set back, I believe there will be
[1:35:19] literally thousand times thousands of
[1:35:22] them except our Lord Jesus when they see
[1:35:25] his power and fill them and sweep in in
[1:35:29] different places. When they see them,
[1:35:32] miracles raise up and tell the people
[1:35:35] even and to speak in their own language
[1:35:37] and tell them what it was. It'd be a
[1:35:39] perfect time. They'd fall by the
[1:35:42] hundreds at the altar and repent of
[1:35:45] their sins. Jesus Christ the same
[1:35:47] yesterday, today, and forever. Amen.
[1:35:51] Let's bow our heads. Our heavenly
[1:35:53] father. Oh, my heart gets warm. Real
[1:35:56] warm. The old world is just the the the
[1:36:00] old world is judgment ripened.
[1:36:04] It won't be long till it'll be over. But
[1:36:06] oh father, while the hour of visitation
[1:36:10] is here, grant that your children will
[1:36:13] see Lord quickly.
[1:36:16] May great faith be built, translating
[1:36:20] faith, great faith that'll just make the
[1:36:24] people be ready for the great
[1:36:27] translation.
[1:36:29] Amen. So I believe that is the purpose
[1:36:35] of the visitation of the Holy Spirit is
[1:36:39] so you can see your day, see the message
[1:36:44] and catch what the Lord Jesus is trying
[1:36:48] to prepare you for that great judgment
[1:36:51] that is to come. That's the great
[1:36:53] judgment day. And it's to give us faith.
[1:36:57] And that faith IS TO BUILD US UP SO that
[1:37:00] we can have translating faith for the
[1:37:04] great translation.
[1:37:06] The age for the rapture is our message.
[1:37:11] We have to have faith to be raptured out
[1:37:15] of here.
[1:37:18] So if the gift, the talent, the servant
[1:37:21] did service didn't move you towards that
[1:37:23] faith, you'd have to ask yourself the
[1:37:25] question, what was the purpose of it?
[1:37:29] Jesus said, will I find faith when I
[1:37:31] return?
[1:37:32] Except you believe that I am he, you'll
[1:37:34] die in your sins.
[1:37:36] It's all around you getting faith for
[1:37:42] the rapture.
[1:37:44] If you're not getting faith, I want you
[1:37:46] to tell me, what are you getting?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; If your faith is not being encouraged
[1:37:51] and growing, then what was the purpose
[1:37:55] of even reading the Bible? Is it so that
[1:37:58] we can argue it? What was the purpose?
[1:38:02] if it's not moving me SOMEHOW SOMEWAY IN
[1:38:07] MY FAITH. By faith, Enoch, by faith,
[1:38:12] Moses, BY FAITH, ALL THE BELIEVERS, it's
[1:38:17] impossible to even please God if you
[1:38:20] don't have faith.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about knowledge. WE'RE
[1:38:23] TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:38:24] ARGUMENTS. We're not talking ABOUT WHO'S
[1:38:26] BETTER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT faith
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; and the gifts of God should be moving us
[1:38:34] somehow somewhere in our faith.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I like this in Jehovah Gyra 1955.
[1:38:44] So many of them miss it in that day.
[1:38:46] Don't you miss it in your day.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; It's the day of his visitation.
[1:38:53] Not me. I'm just a poor substitute of
[1:38:56] anything. But he but it's it's him
[1:39:00] moving, working. He just gives me a way,
[1:39:03] a gift to yield myself to him and do
[1:39:06] these things for your benefit, not for
[1:39:10] mine, for yours. So it's up to you. Now,
[1:39:16] so we see this great day of visitation.
[1:39:20] You know, I am sure I'm gonna I'm going
[1:39:25] to speed ahead here just a little bit. I
[1:39:27] am sure that many people miss the day of
[1:39:31] visitation
[1:39:33] even every Sunday.
[1:39:37] I'm not talking about missing the day or
[1:39:39] the age of the message. Okay, that is
[1:39:43] that's a miss too. And actually, what is
[1:39:46] sin anyways?
[1:39:49] Sin is unbelief and and unbelief and sin
[1:39:53] is also to miss the mark. You swung and
[1:39:57] missed
[1:39:59] like it means to miss the mark. That's
[1:40:02] what sin means. You missed.
[1:40:06] And this faith that is supposed to be
[1:40:10] restored to the believer that God has
[1:40:14] sent to us so that we would not miss the
[1:40:16] day of visitation. But but not just the
[1:40:19] day of visitation. I'm talking about
[1:40:21] missing him today
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; like missing him in the song service.
[1:40:29] missing the Holy Spirit where the
[1:40:32] scripture so many said that I will never
[1:40:35] leave you where two or more or two or
[1:40:39] three are gathered in my name I will be
[1:40:41] there with you
[1:40:44] he made the promise he said he would be
[1:40:47] here he comes
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; and many people miss him I'm talking
[1:40:52] about on a Sunday I'm talking about this
[1:40:54] Sunday
[1:40:56] is it possible for us to miss him today.
[1:41:00] Miss the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:02] when he comes down
[1:41:05] to know what that is that's taking
[1:41:07] place. Now here,
[1:41:09] um we'll get into this a little bit
[1:41:12] more. 1960, is there anything too hard
[1:41:15] for the Lord? Going to our um um
[1:41:20] scripture there in in Genesis 18. You
[1:41:23] know sometimes when things are going
[1:41:25] wrong dark we know by nature that is
[1:41:28] darkest just before day
[1:41:31] many times when we see disastrous things
[1:41:34] happening like that especially to
[1:41:37] believers we must bear this in our mind
[1:41:41] that is Satan trying to block the
[1:41:44] blessing that's on its road
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; that was very much so in this case Satan
[1:41:50] was trying to tempt him to feel that
[1:41:52] they had done wrong. It was trying to
[1:41:55] block the oncoming visitation that God
[1:41:58] was going to give Abraham and Sarah. And
[1:42:02] we're taught in the scriptures that all
[1:42:04] things work together for the good to
[1:42:06] them that li love love God.
[1:42:10] How many of you have ever got a bad
[1:42:12] attitude on the way to church?
[1:42:16] Yeah. We're just going to say you was
[1:42:18] driving by yourself. All right.
[1:42:21] And just somewhere a bad attitude came
[1:42:23] from somewhere. All right. Whatever.
[1:42:25] Whoever started, I don't know who
[1:42:26] started it. and you're on your way to
[1:42:29] church and man, somebody tee you off
[1:42:36] and you're trying to get into the
[1:42:38] presence of the Lord
[1:42:40] and you come here with that atmosphere
[1:42:43] and that attitude
[1:42:46] and you don't think people around you
[1:42:47] can't see it because those are
[1:42:49] atmospheres. Those are anointings.
[1:42:54] You don't think the song leader, if he's
[1:42:55] gifted, can't pick that up when the
[1:42:58] crowd is willing and the crowd has
[1:43:00] prayed up. I'll tell you this right now.
[1:43:03] It's a it's a big difference preaching
[1:43:06] to people who have prayed up than it is
[1:43:10] preaching to people who have bad
[1:43:12] thoughts in their mind.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; It's a big difference. The outcome of
[1:43:16] the service will be very different.
[1:43:20] Even even the atmosphere the atmosphere
[1:43:24] that's around you
[1:43:27] is you really just take it back to what
[1:43:30] you're thinking. We might call it a
[1:43:33] mood.
[1:43:34] We might call it um the atmosphere
[1:43:37] around us but Satan that is his job
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; to block the oncoming visit. You said
[1:43:48] the visitation. Yes. The Holy Spirit
[1:43:51] promised to be here today.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Is he here? YES OR NO? DID THE BIBLE SAY
[1:43:57] HE WOULD BE HERE?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; WE SAID, "I didn't feel nothing." We're
[1:44:00] going to deal with that in just a
[1:44:01] minute.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; What you felt?
[1:44:06] You got to go by what the word says.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen.
[1:44:12] So the blocking of this oncoming
[1:44:14] visitation
[1:44:16] in Jehovah Gyra, the prophet says it
[1:44:18] like this. Paragraph 70, I'll drop down
[1:44:21] a little bit. At the end of the road, a
[1:44:24] President Eisenhower in every city and
[1:44:26] in every county and in every village and
[1:44:29] in every town in this America would
[1:44:32] never stop the onslaught
[1:44:35] going on. Cigarette smoking women and
[1:44:37] drunkards and so forth. It couldn't be
[1:44:39] done. You're going to have it your own
[1:44:42] way. You're bulldozing yourself right
[1:44:45] into hell. That's right. And you know
[1:44:47] it. And you're without excuse. But just
[1:44:50] But BEFORE A JUST GOD CAN POUR out his
[1:44:53] judgment upon a people, he has to make a
[1:44:56] way of escape for everyone who desires
[1:45:00] to receive it.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; This is your day of visitation.
[1:45:06] You might not want to believe it because
[1:45:08] an uneducated minister said it, but
[1:45:11] don't pay no attention to the messenger.
[1:45:15] Pay attention to the message you're
[1:45:17] hearing.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Now, let us pray.
[1:45:22] How many can say amen?
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:27] Prophet of God continues on
[1:45:30] and this is really good here. This is in
[1:45:34] the message. Um, he's gonna tell us how
[1:45:38] to do it just a little bit. And Jesus
[1:45:40] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:45:42] forever. I was listening to this tape
[1:45:44] and he really blessed me.
[1:45:46] Prophet of God is towards the end of the
[1:45:48] service and he's going into his healing
[1:45:50] ministry. And he says, "I'm not a
[1:45:52] healer. God take me to rec record. I
[1:45:56] make it clear. I made it clear. There's
[1:45:58] people here that I don't know. God knows
[1:46:00] it. But there's no one here could hide
[1:46:02] their life right now. Not because I'm
[1:46:05] here, but because Jesus is here.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; The great alpha and omega. Oh, you
[1:46:10] people of Jeffersonville, this is your
[1:46:13] visitation.
[1:46:15] The hour is coming WHEN YOU WILL CRY for
[1:46:18] this and won't have it.
[1:46:21] Not only that, but you people of the
[1:46:24] world, peoples of the world, because the
[1:46:27] spirit of God will someday be taken from
[1:46:30] the earth, and you'll moan and cry, then
[1:46:35] let it be known to you that the God of
[1:46:37] heaven has made himself manifest in the
[1:46:40] form of Jesus Christ and was and has
[1:46:44] went into the glory and come back into
[1:46:46] his church and set in his church. He
[1:46:50] said, "You are the branches. I am the
[1:46:52] vine. You can't bear no fruit lest I
[1:46:54] give you life to bear it with, and
[1:46:57] you'll bear the kind of fruit that I
[1:46:59] purge you to." And it happens to be this
[1:47:02] discernment happens to be the part that
[1:47:05] he purges me to. And it's not me. It's
[1:47:09] the life of God that comes out of the
[1:47:11] branch. Christ by divine promise.
[1:47:16] Prophet of God continues on. He says
[1:47:17] this here, paragraph 79. Now, the only
[1:47:20] thing I can do is to cast away that
[1:47:23] doubt from your heart. I don't know that
[1:47:26] I can do that. I'll try by prayer. And
[1:47:30] if the doubt leaves you and you feel
[1:47:32] that there's something near you, the
[1:47:35] angels of God are in this building. You
[1:47:38] say, "Is that so, preacher?" Yes,
[1:47:40] absolutely. The Bible said they are.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. The angels of God are encapped
[1:47:46] about those who fear. But there's A DARK
[1:47:50] DARK SHADOW BETWEEN you and that angel
[1:47:54] that wants to help you bringing the
[1:47:57] message of Christ. That's unbelief. Now,
[1:48:00] if you can get that unbelief, that dark
[1:48:03] shadow, then you'll see plainly. Then
[1:48:07] you'll raise and rejoice and go home
[1:48:09] shouting, praising God, and and get
[1:48:12] well. Don't let that shadow stand
[1:48:14] between you.
[1:48:17] So here the prophet of God is talking
[1:48:19] about the gift that God had given him as
[1:48:22] a preacher, as a seer, a gift of divine
[1:48:26] healing that he used to break the doubt
[1:48:29] from people's mind. And what what was
[1:48:32] one way he did that? He did that by the
[1:48:34] discernment, telling them who they are
[1:48:35] and where they're from. Remember, the
[1:48:38] discernment wasn't creating anything
[1:48:41] that the patient didn't already know.
[1:48:44] The patient knows their name. But when a
[1:48:48] stranger now tells you your name,
[1:48:51] it lets the patient know that something
[1:48:54] else is going on here, it brings a
[1:48:56] faith. NOW, NOW THAT FAITH IS FOR YOU TO
[1:49:00] BELIEVE. AND NOW WHEN YOU believe you
[1:49:03] can receive
[1:49:05] WHAT THE WORD OF GOD SAYS.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD IN AN
[1:49:11] ATMOSPHERE OF DOUBT.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; SO THE UNBELIEF HAS TO MOVE FROM YOU
[1:49:17] FIRST.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; This is that precious feeling that we
[1:49:22] feel at the end of a service.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; How many know what I'm talking about? At
[1:49:26] the end of a good Holy Ghost service, at
[1:49:28] the end, THERE'S A SWEET SPOT RIGHT AT
[1:49:32] THE END WHERE THE worship has gone
[1:49:34] forth, where the PREACHING OF THE WORD
[1:49:36] HAS GONE FORTH, AND ALL THE ATMOSPHERES
[1:49:39] THAT YOU CAME IN HERE WITH THAT WAS
[1:49:42] CONTRARY HAD TO LEAVE. THAT'S THOSE
[1:49:45] PRECIOUS MOMENTS OF HIS VISITATION
[1:49:50] WHERE YOU CAN CLAIM THE PROMISE OF GOD
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; and say, "It's for me. It's mine."
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; They don't happen all day. They're not
[1:50:01] all around us all the time. BUT THOSE
[1:50:04] MOMENTS WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGES,
[1:50:06] SOMETIMES IT'S AN ANOINTED SONG.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's a playing OF THE PIANO.
[1:50:12] SOMETIMES IT'S A READING OF A SCRIPTURE,
[1:50:15] BUT SOMETHING MOVES IN YOUR HEART.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; DON'T MISS THAT VISITATION WHEN he
[1:50:25] comes.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] All right.
[1:50:35] Can I move a little further?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:50:40] and forever.
[1:50:46] But when the seeds of power of power of
[1:50:49] the resurrected Christ manifest did it
[1:50:52] settles the question the idols was
[1:50:55] broken 30,000 heathens more than the
[1:50:58] Baptist more than the Baptist had won in
[1:51:02] 150 years of missionary and at one time
[1:51:05] because it was it's what Christ said
[1:51:08] would take place and We're living in
[1:51:12] that hour and in that day and this is
[1:51:16] our day of visitation, friends.
[1:51:19] It's later than you think.
[1:51:23] Let's pray. He goes on. So he's talking
[1:51:25] about that meeting he had in Africa, a
[1:51:29] healing campaign. Thousands,
[1:51:32] 30,000 raw heathens accepted the Lord
[1:51:36] Jesus Christ as savior.
[1:51:39] And he's bringing that up to what that
[1:51:42] great ministry did for them people there
[1:51:46] and that him being from away
[1:51:50] um they could receive it better than at
[1:51:53] even at home here in America
[1:51:56] because the people here they miss it.
[1:51:58] They'll miss it because of who he is and
[1:52:00] maybe the way it's coming. And the
[1:52:03] prophet tells us this is our day of
[1:52:05] visitation friends. is later than you
[1:52:07] think.
[1:52:09] I wonder if we know how late it is.
[1:52:13] All we've seen all of our lives is
[1:52:18] grace.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; But when the door closes, there will be
[1:52:22] no grace.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; And none of us have seen that yet.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; When the doors of mercy and grace close
[1:52:30] to the Gentiles,
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; YOU TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING TO COMPLAIN
[1:52:34] ABOUT. Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; You're talking about NOT BEING ABLE TO
[1:52:37] GET A PRAYER THROUGH.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; We are living in the GREATEST TIME WE
[1:52:43] COULD EVER LIVE IN.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Examine yourself.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; And then when you do, you'll just have
[1:52:49] to give God praise
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; for what he has given you.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; DO YOU REALIZE THE GIFT OF GOD THAT WHEN
[1:52:59] HE GAVE YOU SALVATION, WHAT YOU
[1:53:01] RECEIVED?
[1:53:04] greatest thing could happen to you.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; And we're walking it. And let something
[1:53:09] in our job get us upset or something in
[1:53:12] politics get us upset or something in
[1:53:14] the neighborhood or some family member
[1:53:16] get us upset. Are you saved? Are you a
[1:53:20] believer?
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Spirit in your
[1:53:23] life?
[1:53:26] Oh my. Tremendous gift.
[1:53:29] Now here is a pattern.
[1:53:34] I want to make this statement here to
[1:53:35] you that patterns are made to follow
[1:53:39] or to avoid.
[1:53:43] When you see a pattern,
[1:53:45] it's to let you know you need to follow
[1:53:48] the pattern or be leerary of what that
[1:53:52] pattern led to. And here is a pattern
[1:53:56] that God sends a move of God to the
[1:53:59] people and after so much time that move
[1:54:02] becomes common to them and then they go
[1:54:07] back to what they used to be. They'll
[1:54:10] even complain. They'll get so used to
[1:54:12] the grace and the goodness of God that
[1:54:15] they'll begin to complain about even
[1:54:18] under this uh uh ministry of grace that
[1:54:21] we're under. They'll complain about it.
[1:54:23] They'll whisk. They'll they'll flex
[1:54:25] against it. They'll be upset. They did
[1:54:26] it to Moses. Got upset with him. This
[1:54:29] all of the stuff and all the trials and
[1:54:31] tribulations to him. And then they
[1:54:34] actually go back and they become worse.
[1:54:36] Brother Brandham brings it out in the
[1:54:38] Ephesian church age book. Church age
[1:54:40] book number three says in the church
[1:54:44] corporate has never learned this lesson
[1:54:46] from the scripture nor from history.
[1:54:48] Every time God gives a visitation of the
[1:54:51] Holy Spirit and people get free,
[1:54:55] after a while, look at your neighbor and
[1:54:56] say, "After a while."
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; After a while,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; after a while,
[1:55:02] they bind themselves right back to the
[1:55:05] very thing they came out of. When Luther
[1:55:09] came out of Catholicism, the people
[1:55:11] stayed free for a while. But when he
[1:55:14] died, the people simply organized what
[1:55:16] they thought he believed and set up
[1:55:18] their own creeds and ideas and
[1:55:20] repudiated anyone who said opposite to
[1:55:23] what they said. They went RIGHT BACK TO
[1:55:25] CATHOLICISM with a little different
[1:55:28] form. And right today, many Lutherans
[1:55:31] are ready to go all the way back. So we
[1:55:34] see this is a a lesson for us,
[1:55:38] right? The temptation is to go back what
[1:55:41] to what from what God delivered you
[1:55:42] from. Oh, it's so fresh. It's so new.
[1:55:45] How many remember getting saved and that
[1:55:48] a nice precious anointing over your
[1:55:50] life? The temptation level was very very
[1:55:53] low. You can go forward and that high or
[1:55:56] that anointing will last maybe a couple
[1:55:59] weeks or so,
[1:56:02] maybe six months or so or something. And
[1:56:05] then something will happen. It's called
[1:56:09] life
[1:56:11] continues to happen and then something
[1:56:14] will happen on the job and you're like
[1:56:16] where's that where's that uh revival
[1:56:18] spirit that I had this happens to people
[1:56:20] that go to camp meetings all the time go
[1:56:22] to camp nice atmosphere the Holy Spirit
[1:56:24] blesses them they come back and in a few
[1:56:26] days they're worse
[1:56:29] their challenges come back because the
[1:56:33] human being the the pattern is when God
[1:56:36] sends a move and it's a genuine move of
[1:56:40] God. The people that receive that, if
[1:56:43] they're not careful, they'll end up
[1:56:45] going back to what they came out of.
[1:56:49] It's a cycle. It happens. So, it's good
[1:56:53] for us to know that. Amen. Now these
[1:56:55] gifts
[1:56:59] as we read there in Ephesians,
[1:57:01] the gift to preach,
[1:57:04] the gift of uh apostles, prophets,
[1:57:08] teachers, evangelists, those Ephesians
[1:57:10] for gifts, all that are in there, they
[1:57:15] are indeed gifts.
[1:57:18] Now, does a preacher have to study? Yes.
[1:57:21] Does a preacher need knowledge on
[1:57:23] things? Yes. Okay. But you have to study
[1:57:26] and you need knowledge on them too,
[1:57:28] brothers and sisters. Everybody does.
[1:57:32] And because you can study a subject and
[1:57:36] have the knowledge of it doesn't make
[1:57:39] you a preacher still though.
[1:57:41] The the the preaching is a gift
[1:57:46] before the man even repents. It's a gift
[1:57:50] that's in there.
[1:57:53] AND THAT GIFT HAS TO operate properly
[1:57:57] under the word of the Lord, under the
[1:58:00] discipline of the Holy Spirit. That
[1:58:03] gift, it's it's there. He can use it to
[1:58:06] get money or fame. He can use it to make
[1:58:09] himself whatever, open doors for him and
[1:58:12] do all this kind of stuff and God will
[1:58:13] hold him accountable. But the gift is
[1:58:15] there. He can go out all night and do
[1:58:18] things that's wrong. Preachers have done
[1:58:20] it all night. all week and come to the
[1:58:23] pull pit without sleeping a wink. Pick
[1:58:25] up a scripture and the anointing
[1:58:29] WILL COME AS HE PREACHES.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Satan was gifted.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Lucifer could preach.
[1:58:41] So it is a gift.
[1:58:44] And some people they get this mixed up.
[1:58:48] They'll they'll come after the
[1:58:49] convention or after the service. You
[1:58:51] know, the the preacher always got a
[1:58:53] little tag on his back. Can I talk from
[1:58:56] experience for a minute? When we went to
[1:58:58] Israel, they actually put a tag right
[1:59:00] here. I didn't know what it was. Brother
[1:59:02] George Smith. On that tour, all the
[1:59:04] pastors
[1:59:06] had our name and said that we're pastor.
[1:59:07] I was like, "Okay, you want to tell
[1:59:09] everybody we're pastors?" And all of the
[1:59:11] salesmen came to the pastors to kind of
[1:59:14] work on us because the pastors got all
[1:59:16] the money, right?
[1:59:19] I started to figure this out. Why these
[1:59:21] people just keep coming to me, talking
[1:59:23] to me, trying to sell ME THE MOST
[1:59:25] EXPENSIVE ITEM in their store? I figured
[1:59:28] it out. Oh, he knows I'm a preacher, so
[1:59:31] they're coming out. So this the
[1:59:33] preacher, the the the the the minister,
[1:59:38] you know, everybody wants his time.
[1:59:42] They want to tie him up. They want to
[1:59:44] catch, "Oh, I knew more than him. I got
[1:59:47] them." They want to witness to the
[1:59:49] preacher.
[1:59:50] They won't witness to the guy on the
[1:59:52] street. They want to preach to the
[1:59:53] preacher.
[1:59:55] Catch them. Now, I'm not saying y'all
[1:59:57] stop talking to me cuz some of y'all
[1:59:58] don't even talk to me.
[2:00:02] Some of y'all need to talk to me.
[2:00:03] Actually,
[2:00:06] you know this um you know, you're you're
[2:00:09] it's a gift. It doesn't mean he's
[2:00:12] smarter than anyone. It doesn't mean his
[2:00:14] IQ is greater than anyone. Doesn't mean
[2:00:16] he's MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON EVERY
[2:00:18] SUBJECT. IT JUST MEANS THAT GOD GAVE HIM
[2:00:20] A gift to preach.
[2:00:24] IT'S NOT A POLITICIAN.
[2:00:27] It's not JUST SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT A
[2:00:29] SUBJECT MATTER. IT IS ACTUALLY HERALDING
[2:00:33] the truth.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; That's what a preacher is.
[2:00:38] And many have mixed this up. Well, if I
[2:00:41] can run a good business, then I'll be a
[2:00:43] good preacher. Stop. No. No. I don't
[2:00:46] think so. DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. MAYBE
[2:00:48] YOU WILL BE A GOOD PREACHER. MAYBE.
[2:00:50] MAYBE. MAYBE. But are you called to
[2:00:53] preach?
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I can have seven sons
[2:00:59] and desire them to be preachers, to fall
[2:01:03] in line with the great, you know,
[2:01:06] tradition of preachers in our home. If
[2:01:09] God didn't call him, he ain't gonna be
[2:01:11] no preacher.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; If the gift isn't in there, you can't
[2:01:15] put it in there.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T WAKE UP AND SAY ONE DAY, "OH,
[2:01:19] I THINK I WANT TO BE A PREACHER." WELL,
[2:01:21] why do you want to be a preacher? Cuz
[2:01:22] ain't nobody else doing it. Wrong
[2:01:24] answer. I'm sorry.
[2:01:26] The gift has to be in there.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; And the preacher never asked for it. And
[2:01:32] if he's really a God called preacher,
[2:01:35] he's running from it. He's looking for a
[2:01:38] retirement plan quickly.
[2:01:40] He's trying to get out of it.
[2:01:43] He's looking to get fired
[2:01:47] so
[2:01:49] he can go get his reward
[2:01:55] because I have eternal life just like
[2:01:57] you have eternal life.
[2:02:01] Now, let's deal with this just for a few
[2:02:03] moments. I have 15 more minutes. I'm
[2:02:05] going to take every bit of it.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe a squeeze a little bit more. All
[2:02:11] right,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; I'll try to wrap this up by 12. God will
[2:02:15] help me. Now, here's what the prophet of
[2:02:16] God says talking about these ministers.
[2:02:18] Now, ministers usually paragraph 16 and
[2:02:22] looking for Jesus. The Now, the
[2:02:24] ministers usually here is the basic and
[2:02:28] foundation of all Christianom. It lays
[2:02:31] right here in the Bible. Anything
[2:02:34] outside of that is untrue. That's right.
[2:02:37] It has to be based on thus sayeth the
[2:02:39] Lord. Now the minister speaking, he gets
[2:02:42] inspiration.
[2:02:44] He's got a gift of healing. Gift of
[2:02:46] healing course is faith in healing. Now
[2:02:51] he believes it with all his heart. and
[2:02:54] he stands up and he preaches it with
[2:02:58] great forceful WORDS
[2:03:01] THAT GOES OUT TO THE people and they
[2:03:04] just have to believe it.
[2:03:07] He just PRESENTS IT IN SUCH A WAY YOU
[2:03:11] JUST HAVE to believe it. And brother
[2:03:14] Roberts is very good at that. Brother
[2:03:16] Osborne is a man who can tie Satan in so
[2:03:19] many places in the scripture till he
[2:03:21] hasn't even got a place to move. That's
[2:03:23] all. HE'S JUST TIED UP. NOW, HE DOES
[2:03:27] THAT NOT BY KNOWLEDGE. They do that by
[2:03:32] inspiration.
[2:03:35] THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVES THEM A GIFT OF
[2:03:38] DIVINE HEALING which gives inspiration
[2:03:41] to the people when they see the word of
[2:03:43] God is claiming what they're talking
[2:03:46] about.
[2:03:48] Prophet God continues on the expectation
[2:03:51] and he says this paragraph 23. Now God
[2:03:54] has after all that is in the word. He
[2:03:58] has set in the church some apostles,
[2:04:00] prophets, teachers, gifts of healing,
[2:04:03] speaking in tongues, INTERPRETATION OF
[2:04:06] TONGUES AND ALL THE different gifts he
[2:04:08] sets in the church. the edifying of the
[2:04:11] church to bring the church together
[2:04:16] to make us one. Is that right? That's
[2:04:19] right. To make us one in him, a
[2:04:21] brotherhood of one soul, one heart, one
[2:04:25] body, one spirit. For we're not baptized
[2:04:28] into two spirits, one spirit, one God,
[2:04:31] father of us all, through all, in all,
[2:04:34] over all. And there's where these gifts
[2:04:36] in the church, some of them can speak
[2:04:38] with tongues. Gift of speaking with
[2:04:40] tongues.
[2:04:42] Another one has a gift of interpretation
[2:04:44] of tongues. Some are sent to preach.
[2:04:46] Now, we know that people that don't
[2:04:48] believe in divine gifts and yet they're
[2:04:50] preachers. How do they get their
[2:04:51] inspiration to preach from? Brother
[2:04:54] Madam continues on. Can you say amen to
[2:04:57] that?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody say amen for the
[2:05:01] preachers.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; The good ones anyways.
[2:05:05] Paragraph 112. The first thing I would
[2:05:08] say according to the rules of the church
[2:05:10] in the Old Testament or the New
[2:05:12] Testament rather at the first place that
[2:05:14] people entered into the church and God
[2:05:19] in a spirit of worship
[2:05:22] and they walked in hymns were sang and
[2:05:25] maybe the preacher would speak for he
[2:05:27] was a prophet of the church. A New
[2:05:29] Testament prophet is a preacher. We know
[2:05:31] that the testimony of Jesus Christ is
[2:05:34] the spirit of prophecy. Skip down to
[2:05:37] paragraph 115. Now then, if it's in
[2:05:40] order, if this is what you were getting
[2:05:42] at, while the preacher is speaking,
[2:05:44] everything should be silent to listen at
[2:05:47] the preacher, for there's the word of
[2:05:49] God going forth. If he's preaching under
[2:05:54] anointing
[2:05:55] and every spirit of the prophets is
[2:05:57] subject to the prophet. When a pastor
[2:05:59] walks to the platform, turns that Bible
[2:06:02] down, the church should be silent,
[2:06:04] listening at his his reading of the
[2:06:07] scripture, listen to what he's going to
[2:06:09] say. If he says something that sounds
[2:06:11] good to you, you can say, can you say it
[2:06:14] with me?
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:17] It even louder than that. Free.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord or whatever you want to.
[2:06:22] Amen means so be it.
[2:06:26] prophet of God brings in 1953 I perceive
[2:06:29] that thou art a prophet he says this
[2:06:32] here now to bring up this faith in
[2:06:34] Christ there's ministers that's the most
[2:06:37] important thing of the day is a god good
[2:06:40] god said preacher I admire them and
[2:06:43] their gift is far beyond anything could
[2:06:46] be done anything else is a preacher a
[2:06:50] man who knows how to rightly divide the
[2:06:52] word of God it's the most wonderful gift
[2:06:55] in the world is to be a minister which
[2:06:59] was a New Testament modern-day prophet
[2:07:01] or preacher. Prophesy means to foretell
[2:07:03] or to tell something personal. In other
[2:07:05] words, if you read the Bible and start,
[2:07:07] then that's a teacher. See, but prophesy
[2:07:11] is to testify or foretell.
[2:07:14] And the spirit of Christ is prophecy.
[2:07:17] Now, who said that? Who said that? Who
[2:07:20] said that right now?
[2:07:22] Huh? Who said it? Somebody
[2:07:27] y'all didn't hear who said that. Who am
[2:07:29] I quoting?
[2:07:30] Dr. uh uh uh Charles Stanley. Who am I
[2:07:34] quoting right now? Who said that?
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; And he was a preacher. And here he is
[2:07:40] quoting this and telling us what this
[2:07:44] great gift is. Now he moves forward and
[2:07:48] says this in preparation 1953.
[2:07:51] Now let me explain one more time so that
[2:07:54] you'll thoroughly understand. Gifts and
[2:07:56] callings are without repentance. Do you
[2:07:59] know that you can never make yourself
[2:08:01] something that you're not? See, you're
[2:08:04] born in this world sovereignly by God
[2:08:07] with different things to do.
[2:08:11] You take a man that wants to be a
[2:08:12] preacher and goes off to get himself an
[2:08:14] education, he will never he will never
[2:08:17] make a preacher. He might make a
[2:08:19] lecturer, but preachers are born.
[2:08:24] GOD CALLS PREACHERS. That's right. And
[2:08:27] you might try to be a singer and you set
[2:08:29] up and squeak tenor for four or five
[2:08:32] hours every day. Something they're like
[2:08:35] that. You'll never make a singer.
[2:08:39] Singers are born.
[2:08:42] That's right.
[2:08:45] Some of y'all say, "Well, that's why I'm
[2:08:46] not in the choir because I'm not a
[2:08:48] singer." Well, that's Nobody asked you.
[2:08:54] That's God's decision whether you're a
[2:08:56] singer or not. Well, I'm a singer. I'm
[2:08:58] not a singer. Says who? Is you or SAYS
[2:09:01] GOD? IF GOD says you're a singer, guess
[2:09:03] what you are?
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you. And what should you be doing
[2:09:07] with the gift of singing?
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; Singing.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Sitting quiet in the back. Don't bother
[2:09:11] me. I'm going to do my thing. No. No,
[2:09:14] YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SINGING. THAT'S
[2:09:17] WHAT THE GIFT WAS FOR.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN, SOMEBODY.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; NOW, let's go a little bit further here.
[2:09:25] Uncertain sound, 1955, paragraph 86. The
[2:09:28] prophet of God says this here. When I
[2:09:31] went to Rome, Italy, went to the burying
[2:09:33] grounds of the saints, they even had a
[2:09:35] sign at the gate, St. Angelo's burial
[2:09:37] place, the catacombs. It said, "American
[2:09:39] women, please put on clothes before you
[2:09:41] enter this place." and respect the dead
[2:09:45] in an ordinary arnery degraded
[2:09:48] debauchered low down places Italy have
[2:09:51] to speak such words as that and our
[2:09:53] preachers are the causes cause of it
[2:09:57] from the platform
[2:09:59] by not telling the truth. Amen. That's
[2:10:04] right. Preachers are not born to make
[2:10:07] everybody happy. Preachers are born to
[2:10:10] tell the truth. And if the truth makes
[2:10:12] you happy, then great. We're all happy.
[2:10:16] WHY ARE WE HAPPY? BECAUSE THE PREACHER
[2:10:18] TOLD THE TRUTH.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; And that's happiness that we want. Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Let's move forward. Brother Manam goes
[2:10:27] forward and say, "Today's preachers are
[2:10:29] trying to be reformers instead of gospel
[2:10:31] preachers. They're saying you can quit
[2:10:34] do this. You don't do that. Get my
[2:10:36] church to do that's not our business.
[2:10:39] The police are reformers. They're the
[2:10:42] one who sends them to the penitentiary
[2:10:44] penitentiary to reform them. WE'RE
[2:10:46] GOSPEL PREACHERS TO TELL them of Jesus
[2:10:50] Christ.
[2:10:52] Get them born again the spirit of God.
[2:10:55] Then God takes over the person and the
[2:10:57] Holy Ghost gets into the heart of the
[2:10:59] man and woman.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; You know that's true. Each one of you.
[2:11:05] Amen.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Let's take this last one here in the
[2:11:09] message of guide 1962. Sometimes
[2:11:13] sometimes good preachers are led astray
[2:11:16] by their congregation.
[2:11:20] That's the reason I have, you know,
[2:11:22] that's that's a man trying to appease
[2:11:24] everybody.
[2:11:26] And the inspiration of the Lord comes to
[2:11:28] him. However it comes, different people
[2:11:31] have different ways that God deals with
[2:11:33] them. And then the congregation with
[2:11:35] their feelings, with their thoughts of
[2:11:37] political, what what all the other
[2:11:39] churches are doing and how what's more
[2:11:41] comfortable and what's more easier to to
[2:11:43] do and then move that ministry away from
[2:11:47] the word of the Lord.
[2:11:49] A preacher is beholden to the word of
[2:11:52] the Lord.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; That is what he is inspired to preach is
[2:11:58] the truth.
[2:12:00] It might not even be a service that you
[2:12:02] would say that's inspired.
[2:12:04] And maybe you look through the CROWD AND
[2:12:06] SOME PEOPLE FALLING ASLEEP.
[2:12:09] And maybe it look like a subject that
[2:12:10] you heard already.
[2:12:12] But if it's a IF IT'S THE WORD OF THE
[2:12:15] LORD, IT WILL NEVER RETURN VOID.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:21] And the truth is always appropriate. Can
[2:12:24] I take 10 more minutes
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; and talk about you for a minute?
[2:12:29] Okay.
[2:12:31] In the message demonology 1953
[2:12:35] paragraph 75. And the gift of healing
[2:12:37] and all those gifts, my Pentecostal
[2:12:39] friend, you get mixed up. The gifts are
[2:12:43] in the church subject to any persons in
[2:12:47] the church. ANYBODY THAT'S BAPTIZED into
[2:12:51] the body by one spirit. We're all
[2:12:53] baptized in
[2:12:57] paragraph 29. the message where I think
[2:12:59] Pentecostal failed. Now while I'm right
[2:13:02] on this subject, let's take this now
[2:13:04] real close. Gifts and callings are
[2:13:06] without repentance. They are the
[2:13:08] fornowledge of God. You could not make
[2:13:11] one cubic higher or lower. You could not
[2:13:14] take taking thought could not add one
[2:13:17] inch to your cubic or to your stature
[2:13:20] rather. But there is God for knowing and
[2:13:24] has made you just what he wants you to
[2:13:27] be. He's made you. He has set you and
[2:13:31] give you a place. If everybody I tell
[2:13:34] you what I like I like people to be
[2:13:37] original.
[2:13:39] I don't like people to impersonate
[2:13:41] someone else. Do you? There's so much of
[2:13:44] that TODAY IN THE WORLD. ACTORS, you
[2:13:47] know the word Pharisee means actor. WE
[2:13:50] GOT SO MANY ACTORS today that people
[2:13:53] trying to act like somebody else, trying
[2:13:55] to impersonate somebody else. People
[2:13:58] would love you a lot better if you just
[2:14:00] be yourself.
[2:14:02] They know more how to take you.
[2:14:07] Questions and answers 1957.
[2:14:10] But just trying to make it just briefly
[2:14:12] plain as I know how to make it. No. When
[2:14:15] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:14:17] you then have the new birth. When you
[2:14:19] believe on the Lord, you receive a new
[2:14:22] thought, a new life, but it isn't the
[2:14:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You got the
[2:14:27] new birth when you believe.
[2:14:30] YOU'VE GOT ETERNAL LIFE. IT'S A GIFT OF
[2:14:32] GOD THAT'S given to you through
[2:14:35] sovereign grace by accepting the gift
[2:14:39] that God is giving to you. He that
[2:14:41] heareth my words and believeth on him
[2:14:44] that sent me hath eternal life, hath
[2:14:46] everlasting life. That's the new birth.
[2:14:48] you're converted. It means you're turned
[2:14:51] around. But the baptism of the Holy
[2:14:53] Spirit puts you into the body of Christ,
[2:14:58] subject to the gifts for service.
[2:15:03] What are those gifts? 1 Corinthians 12
[2:15:06] 13 and 14.
[2:15:09] It doesn't make you any more of a
[2:15:11] Christian. It just puts you into the
[2:15:14] body of gifts.
[2:15:17] See, now by one spirit, 1 Corinthians
[2:15:20] 12, we're all baptized into one body.
[2:15:22] Paul, there are different gifts. And in
[2:15:25] and in this body is nine spiritual
[2:15:27] gifts. In this body, you have to be
[2:15:29] baptized into the body to possess one of
[2:15:32] these gifts. They come with the body.
[2:15:38] All right. God bless you saints.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Praise the Lord."
[2:15:45] So I have so many more on that that
[2:15:48] every one of us
[2:15:50] is baptized. If you're a Christian, how
[2:15:53] many of you are saved? Let me see your
[2:15:55] hand. How many of you have received the
[2:15:57] Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit in your
[2:15:59] life?
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; And that Holy Spirit, you're baptized
[2:16:03] into the body of gifts.
[2:16:08] I was going to title the message. I
[2:16:09] would tie that into the title there,
[2:16:11] too. body of gifts.
[2:16:14] You're baptized into the body of gifts.
[2:16:16] You're a member of the body of Christ.
[2:16:19] And guess what? You don't get to pick
[2:16:21] the gift that God operates through you.
[2:16:27] How many can you say amen to that?
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Is that too much pressure?
[2:16:32] I mean, we're going to heaven
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; and you're a Christian
[2:16:37] and you're not trying to make yourself
[2:16:38] something that you're not, but you're
[2:16:41] just letting the Holy Spirit use you.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; You get out of the way and you let the
[2:16:45] Holy Spirit use you BECAUSE YOU'RE
[2:16:49] BAPTIZED INTO THE BODY OF gifts for the
[2:16:52] edification.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; That is the true church of the living
[2:16:57] God.
[2:16:59] Everybody has something they should be
[2:17:01] doing that the Holy Spirit is doing
[2:17:03] through them. Every one of us. Amen.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:11] And maybe some of us are missing that.
[2:17:15] Maybe some of us are missing that.
[2:17:18] Now, what happens is
[2:17:22] our attitude
[2:17:24] and our approach to the gift really
[2:17:27] determines what you're going to get out
[2:17:29] of the service or even the scripture,
[2:17:32] reading of the scripture. The prophet of
[2:17:35] God uses the term the mood.
[2:17:38] You got to get into the mood of reading.
[2:17:42] You just don't read it with a cold
[2:17:44] heart. You get into the atmosphere of
[2:17:47] it.
[2:17:48] And in that atmosphere is pleasantness.
[2:17:52] It's the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Now, there's greater
[2:17:57] outpourings, greater baptisms. But what
[2:18:00] happens many times, the Holy Spirit will
[2:18:02] baptize us on one service am.
[2:18:06] And then in the PM, you're like, "What
[2:18:09] happened?"
[2:18:11] Well, the PM SERVICE, WE WANT GOD TO
[2:18:13] JUST DRAG US THROUGH the service. Well,
[2:18:16] I'll praise you, Lord, if you make me.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; I will dance, Lord. I'll lift my hands.
[2:18:22] I'll sing if you just take over my vocal
[2:18:24] cords and make me sing. No, no, no.
[2:18:27] Saints, no.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; The the praise comes from our heart to
[2:18:32] him.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond our feelings.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; It goes beyond WHAT WE THINK AND HOW
[2:18:38] WHAT'S GOING ON. WE COME TO PRAISE HIM
[2:18:41] BECAUSE THE WORD of the Lord, that's one
[2:18:43] of our offerings.
[2:18:45] Amen.
[2:18:47] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go through this just for a
[2:18:49] moment. Yeah, I'm right on time.
[2:18:51] Paragraph 272. Usually, people that has
[2:18:54] gifts are people who don't want gifts.
[2:18:59] I think we got that covered here.
[2:19:02] Paragraph 272. Let's read that one
[2:19:04] again. If this is the last one, I'll
[2:19:06] read, Brother Joe. All right.
[2:19:09] Usually, people that have gifts are
[2:19:11] people who don't want gifts. See, Paul
[2:19:15] tried to run from the thing. So did
[2:19:17] Moses. Great leaders like that try to
[2:19:20] run from the job. They know what lays
[2:19:22] before them. You see, you take a guy
[2:19:26] that always, "Oh Lord, fill me with
[2:19:27] power. I'll go out here and I'll cast
[2:19:29] out devils." He'd never do it. God knows
[2:19:33] better than to trust anybody like that.
[2:19:36] See, he'd never do it. It's the guy that
[2:19:39] don't want nothing to do. Paragraph 273.
[2:19:43] Shalom Tabernacle, Tucson, Arizona.
[2:19:47] It's the church. IT'S THE PEOPLE. IT'S
[2:19:49] THE GUYS
[2:19:51] THAT DON'T WANT nothing to do.
[2:20:00] I'm too much, but I'm going to go to
[2:20:01] heaven anyway. I'm leave here.
[2:20:04] Am I too much for y'all?
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; Is the word too much? That's what I'm
[2:20:08] quoting. It's a guy that don't want
[2:20:10] nothing to do with it. You see, that's
[2:20:13] the guy that God can take him and teach
[2:20:17] him something sometime. You see, so we
[2:20:21] want the Holy Spirit to teach us.
[2:20:24] Amen.
[2:20:27] I remember we had our our as I talked
[2:20:30] about our football team, we were sorry.
[2:20:32] We wasn't sorry, but we were sorry. And
[2:20:34] we lost a lot of games. We had a few
[2:20:37] stars on the team, whatever. We thought
[2:20:39] we was good. Thought we was that. and
[2:20:41] the city of of Sacramento, some
[2:20:44] associating wanted to honor some of the
[2:20:46] better athletes. And so they so I was
[2:20:49] one of those athletes to be chosen to go
[2:20:50] to this banquet and this dinner end of
[2:20:52] the year, all these high school
[2:20:53] students. And they came to our table and
[2:20:56] we each had to give a speech of
[2:20:58] gratitude and thank you.
[2:21:03] And man, I couldn't enjoy anything else
[2:21:06] being done in that program. Like what? I
[2:21:09] go to say a speech about what? So
[2:21:13] I said, "Hey guys, this is what we
[2:21:14] should do to really represent our
[2:21:17] school." Well, don't all of us go up
[2:21:20] there. Just one of us go up there and
[2:21:21] represent us all.
[2:21:25] Yeah. Yeah. And the other guy that was
[2:21:27] shy said, "Yeah, that's a good idea."
[2:21:29] Well, who should do it? Not me. You
[2:21:32] should do it. And that's what we did.
[2:21:34] So, Luther Burbank, we had one
[2:21:35] representative and all these other
[2:21:37] talented speakers, they're not going to
[2:21:39] speak tonight.
[2:21:41] The thought of getting up and standing
[2:21:43] before a crowd and speaking, oh, that's
[2:21:45] not happening. Not for me. No, no, no,
[2:21:48] no, no.
[2:21:51] Please don't put the microphone in my
[2:21:53] hand. No. See, but that's not my choice,
[2:21:57] right?
[2:21:59] God deals with that. Now, I have to get
[2:22:03] into something here and I know I took a
[2:22:06] little time to give you an announcement
[2:22:09] on what I want to move forward for the
[2:22:11] future the church and um
[2:22:16] I want to say this here.
[2:22:19] Let's move over into this um where
[2:22:22] brother Vanam is talking about the mood
[2:22:24] and how Sarah what mood she was in when
[2:22:28] the visitation came. Now in 19 in 1947
[2:22:33] paragraph 54 in the message the children
[2:22:36] of Israel the prophet of God says this.
[2:22:39] I know it's hard cuts me down and I hate
[2:22:42] to say anything to people but friends I
[2:22:44] have to stand at judgment someday to
[2:22:46] answer before you people. That's right.
[2:22:49] And your blood will be upon my hands.
[2:22:51] You serve God with reverence in your
[2:22:53] heart. Pure holy love for him. Walk
[2:22:57] every day in that mood of love all the
[2:23:01] time.
[2:23:02] Do good to others and do good charitable
[2:23:05] deeds and love God and worship him and
[2:23:09] that's the way you're supposed to live
[2:23:12] and treat your neighbor as yourself.
[2:23:14] That's right.
[2:23:18] The lamb and the dove 57 he says this.
[2:23:20] Now, the entire Bible is set up on
[2:23:24] Revelation.
[2:23:27] Now, you'll never know the Bible just by
[2:23:31] some coldhearted reading it. You've got
[2:23:34] to read the Bible in the spirit. You've
[2:23:38] got to be in the mood of reading.
[2:23:41] You've got to love to read it. And the
[2:23:43] Bible is written so that the wise,
[2:23:45] smart, educated, will never understand
[2:23:47] it. Jesus thanked God and said, "Father,
[2:23:50] I thank thee that thou has hid these
[2:23:52] things from the wise and prudent and
[2:23:55] will reveal them to babes such as we'll
[2:23:57] learn." I'm so glad of that. You don't
[2:24:00] have to be somebody in this world to
[2:24:02] know God. You just have to have a
[2:24:04] willing heart and God will go to dealing
[2:24:06] with that willing heart if you are
[2:24:11] willing.
[2:24:14] Paragraph 185.
[2:24:16] I have to take these here for you just
[2:24:18] for a moment. If you will now as quickly
[2:24:22] as possible,
[2:24:24] sorry, this is a message of Christ 185.
[2:24:27] If you'll now quickly as possible, each
[2:24:29] one of you that raise your hand for
[2:24:30] salvation closer walk, believe you have
[2:24:34] it. If you can't feel it, take the
[2:24:37] adopted child. See, keep saying you have
[2:24:42] it until it becomes a reality.
[2:24:48] You that accepted healing and you don't
[2:24:50] feel any difference. You say, "My faith
[2:24:52] is not enough to move it right now."
[2:24:54] Brother Brandham, take the adopted child
[2:24:57] way. Just keep saying, "Lord, I'm
[2:25:00] healed.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; I believe it. It'll come. It'll get
[2:25:07] it'll get you in the right mood." You
[2:25:10] see, and then your faith will be right.
[2:25:13] I'll take it. You just believe it with
[2:25:15] all your heart. I love that.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; In the images of Christ, he continues
[2:25:21] paragraph 185. If you will now, as
[2:25:24] quickly as possible, each one of you
[2:25:25] that raise your hand. Oh, we read that.
[2:25:27] Yeah. Stepping in take the adopted child
[2:25:30] route and keep moving
[2:25:35] on is what he says. What's the adopted
[2:25:37] child route? The adopted child route is
[2:25:41] for those mothers that can't seem to
[2:25:45] conceive. They try, they try and then
[2:25:49] many times they adopt a baby and after
[2:25:52] adopting the baby that mother is able to
[2:25:56] conceive of her own seed because the
[2:25:58] atmosphere, the mood and brother Manam
[2:26:00] is saying take the adopted baby route
[2:26:04] when you feel like you in a bad mood
[2:26:07] when you come to church.
[2:26:10] or any promise of God,
[2:26:13] you get into the atmosphere of the word
[2:26:16] and you keep saying it until the mood
[2:26:19] changes.
[2:26:20] And the song service is for that
[2:26:23] purpose,
[2:26:24] to change your mood. It's amazing that
[2:26:28] we can go through an entire song
[2:26:30] service, get up to the preacher, and I'm
[2:26:31] still dealing with an attitude. Not
[2:26:34] here. Not here. I'm talking about some
[2:26:36] other saints somewhere else.
[2:26:40] You missed the day of the mood change.
[2:26:44] The mood swing should have happened when
[2:26:48] the organ was playing.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; When the strings were playing, your mood
[2:26:54] should have BEEN SWINGING OUT OF THERE.
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; And I challenge anybody to have bad
[2:27:00] thoughts, but then be in a a great
[2:27:02] atmosphere.
[2:27:06] Your thoughts is the reason WHY YOU HAVE
[2:27:08] THE atmosphere on you.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR THOUGHTS THAT BRINGS THAT
[2:27:12] ATMOSPHERE. SO, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR
[2:27:14] THOUGHTS. AND SOMETIMES IT'S MECHANICAL.
[2:27:17] SOMETIMES YOU JUST DO IT BECAUSE THE
[2:27:19] BIBLE SAYS TO DO IT. BUT DO IT ANYWAY
[2:27:22] UNTIL
[2:27:24] THE MOOD CHANGES. And when the mood
[2:27:26] changes, now the Holy Spirit can come in
[2:27:30] now and you can grab those promises
[2:27:33] because the promises of God are not made
[2:27:35] to be read with a cold heart.
[2:27:40] Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. God bless
[2:27:43] you, saints. This is where Sarah was
[2:27:48] that morning.
[2:27:50] The prophet makes the statement here and
[2:27:54] I'll close just now in paragraph number
[2:27:59] 79 78 paragraph 83 talking about Sarah
[2:28:04] she was ear
[2:28:07] um you know Sarah in there eavesdropping
[2:28:12] some people call it ear hustling
[2:28:16] Sarah is in there easedropping kind of
[2:28:18] half-hearted in a upset mood food from
[2:28:20] her condition that morning. She thought
[2:28:22] in her heart, "Now, isn't that a silly
[2:28:25] thing? Think in our day, me, an old
[2:28:28] woman, as old as I am, here I am 90
[2:28:30] years old. There says my husband 100
[2:28:33] years old." Well, it's not been with me
[2:28:36] as woman for 50 years. And Abraham,
[2:28:38] well, we've been married since we were
[2:28:40] about 17. I'm about 27. You know, how
[2:28:44] could that be? How could it be? See, she
[2:28:47] had herself all out of condition to
[2:28:49] receive it when God brought it. Brought
[2:28:52] it. Oh my. Don't never get in that in
[2:28:56] your heart. Be open. Be ready. She
[2:29:00] missed it. She failed to see it. Maybe
[2:29:04] if we don't watch, friends, the church
[2:29:06] is going to fail to see it. Let's not
[2:29:08] look for your church hairds
[2:29:11] and new dresses. Let's look for the Holy
[2:29:14] Spirit to come in the supernatural
[2:29:19] and raise some things.
[2:29:23] Paragraph 78, they say, "I see the angel
[2:29:25] takes his chair maybe and leans back
[2:29:27] towards his back towards the tent. Sarah
[2:29:29] listening through the tent, you know,
[2:29:31] kind of e easedropping, you know, and
[2:29:34] listening through the tent and she kind
[2:29:35] of in an awful mood that morning. You
[2:29:39] don't see things when you come to church
[2:29:41] in that kind of a mood. You just no need
[2:29:45] of trying it. You just might as well
[2:29:47] stay home. You won't get nothing out of
[2:29:50] it. Go home in a when you come to
[2:29:53] church, come prayed up. Come in the
[2:29:56] atmosphere. Come expecting.
[2:29:59] Abraham knew that the time of the
[2:30:01] promise was coming close and it had to
[2:30:04] be. It's a hundred years old. He was
[2:30:06] expecting it at any time. He watched
[2:30:10] every minute.
[2:30:13] Amen.
[2:30:14] So when you come to church, come pray it
[2:30:16] up.
[2:30:18] Sometimes that first prayer of your day
[2:30:22] is when you got to church because you
[2:30:23] just barely made it here and you fall
[2:30:26] down on your knees. He's like, "Lord
[2:30:28] Jesus,
[2:30:30] please help me today.
[2:30:33] Change my mood.
[2:30:35] change my attitude. I'm a believer. I
[2:30:39] have the Holy Spirit in my life. And
[2:30:41] maybe you want to use one of those gifts
[2:30:44] through me.
[2:30:48] Maybe that's what you want to do. So,
[2:30:50] God bless you, saints. That's our
[2:30:52] prayer. That's our message for you
[2:30:54] today. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, thank
[2:30:58] you for your word today. We thank you
[2:31:01] for these words of truth.
[2:31:04] Lord, I know there's many, oh God, their
[2:31:07] timing may be
[2:31:11] their timing may be off or they might
[2:31:14] just not know how to approach some of
[2:31:18] these things, Lord. It's new to them,
[2:31:22] Lord. We're just ignorant to them. Some
[2:31:25] of us are just, we just don't know,
[2:31:27] Lord. And but we do know that we love
[2:31:31] you and you called us to be a part of
[2:31:33] your bride.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Now from that one truth right there,
[2:31:38] Lord, we lift our hands and our hearts
[2:31:41] to you and say, "Oh, blessed Holy
[2:31:44] Spirit, take full control of my life.
[2:31:48] Take me from this day forward, Lord, and
[2:31:52] may you use me the way you choose to use
[2:31:55] these gifts, Lord. May I not miss you.
[2:31:58] Even in the even in the Sunday service,
[2:32:03] Wednesday service, the precious Holy
[2:32:06] Ghost moves the doubts away.
[2:32:09] And now you want to come in and minister
[2:32:13] and build us up with faith.
[2:32:17] Oh God, the faith that was once restored
[2:32:20] to the church. Faith for the body
[2:32:23] change. Faith for getting up out of the
[2:32:26] grave. Faith for the rapture.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; Faith, oh God, is what the believers
[2:32:33] need. That's what we need. The just
[2:32:36] shall live by it. May you grant, oh God,
[2:32:38] these things to each heart. We pray in
[2:32:42] Jesus name.
[2:32:44] Amen. God bless you. Amen. Brother John,
[2:32:49] would you come? Is there anyone here
[2:32:51] that needs special prayer? You need
[2:32:53] hands laid up on you,
[2:32:56] you have a special request in your life,
[2:32:58] you can come forward at this time, we'll
[2:33:00] pray for you,
[2:33:02] you have a special need
[2:33:05] and um we will do that for you. So God
[2:33:08] bless you richly. Amen.
[2:33:13] Yes, I'm right forward, Jonathan.
[2:33:18] Does someone else need prayer or desire
[2:33:20] prayer this morning? Amen. Let's bow our
[2:33:22] heads and let's hold our brother for his
[2:33:26] request. What's inside?
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Brother Jonathan is coming for
[2:33:33] prayer. The Lord will touch him
[2:33:36] that the Holy Spirit will
[2:33:39] just move all of the nerves, the
[2:33:44] anxiety, whatever it the challenges are.
[2:33:47] Let's stand with our brother this
[2:33:49] morning. Heavenly Father, I lay my hands
[2:33:52] on this brother
[2:33:54] and in the name of Jesus Christ. We
[2:33:58] rebuke the enemy that's trying to
[2:34:01] destroy him.
[2:34:03] He his enemy is our enemy. And Lord, but
[2:34:08] you paid it all.
[2:34:11] You paid for deliverance.
[2:34:13] You paid for healing.
[2:34:16] You paid to relieve
[2:34:19] anxiety and stress.
[2:34:22] You pray. You paid for the release of
[2:34:26] depression and oppression.
[2:34:29] You paid it all, Lord. You paid for our
[2:34:32] salvation.
[2:34:34] You paid that we could have the Holy
[2:34:36] Ghost in our life. You paid for us to be
[2:34:40] free,
[2:34:41] oh God. And we're free. You set us free,
[2:34:44] Lord. and we claim this victory for my
[2:34:48] brother in Jesus name.
[2:34:51] Lord, we settle for nothing less than
[2:34:54] what you've granted at Calvary. With
[2:34:57] your stripes, we are already healed. And
[2:35:00] he claims that healing, Lord Jesus.
[2:35:04] Lord, move away every doubt, every speck
[2:35:06] of unbelief from him. And in Jesus'
[2:35:10] name, may he take these promises,
[2:35:13] stand upon them, Lord, and receive them
[2:35:17] in Jesus' name I pray. Lord, we claim
[2:35:20] it, Lord, in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
[2:35:25] God bless you. God bless you. Amen.
[2:35:32] Amen.

[2:39:29] his countenance
[2:39:34] resting
[2:39:36] on
[2:39:37] your face.
[2:39:42] I know that there
[2:39:47] are angels
[2:39:50] hovering all around us

[2:51:46] where the waterers
[2:51:49] cool flows
[2:51:51] the weary
[2:51:54] ones feet.
[2:51:57] God leads his dear children
[2:52:03] along.
[2:52:09] And some through the waterers,
[2:52:15] some through the blood,
[2:52:20] some through the fire.
[2:52:26] But all through the blood
[2:52:31] and some through great sorrow,
[2:52:37] but God gives a song
[2:52:43] in the night season
[2:52:48] and all the day long.
[2:52:54] Sometimes
[2:52:56] on the mountain where the sun shines so
[2:53:02] bright,
[2:53:05] God leads his dear children
[2:53:11] along.
[2:53:17] Sometimes
[2:53:19] in the valley,
[2:53:22] in the darkest
[2:53:25] of night,
[2:53:27] God leaves his dear children
[2:53:34] alone.
[2:53:40] Some through the waters,
[2:53:46] some through the flood,
[2:53:51] some through the fire,
[2:53:57] but all through the blood
[2:54:02] and some through
[2:54:05] great sorrow.
[2:54:08] But God gives the song
[2:54:14] in the night season
[2:54:20] and all the day long.
[2:54:25] Though sorrows
[2:54:28] befall us and Satan
[2:54:34] upholds.
[2:54:36] God leads his dear children
[2:54:42] along.
[2:54:48] Through grace
[2:54:50] we can coner
[2:54:53] and defeat all our foes.
[2:54:59] God leads
[2:55:01] his dear children
[2:55:05] alone
[2:55:11] and some through
[2:55:14] the waterers.
[2:55:17] Some through the flood,
[2:55:23] some through the fire,
[2:55:28] but all through the blood
[2:55:33] and some fruit through
[2:55:36] great sorrow.
[2:55:40] But God gives a song
[2:55:46] in the night season
[2:55:51] and all the day long.
[2:57:00] Hallelujah.
