[25:35] praise tonight shall
[25:41] we amen so good to be in the house of
[25:43] the Lord tonight and I think uh brother
[25:46] Joel We got to get us one of these
[25:49] headsets that's going around here and
[25:52] and uh sure it sounded good tonight I
[25:54] like that so uh amen it's good to be
[25:57] back in the house the Lord we'll be
[25:59] listening to the remainder of a thinking
[26:01] man's filter tonight and finish up that
[26:04] message that we started last week and I
[26:07] was reflecting today Saints
[26:10] on
[26:12] just I was just thinking about where I
[26:14] would be if God hadn't sent a prophet in
[26:17] this day and uh have you ever done that
[26:21] just thought about what might happen
[26:23] What Might Have Been of your life if if
[26:26] God hadn't to called you and God hadn't
[26:28] pulled you out and and I was thinking
[26:30] how thankful I am that God sent me a
[26:33] message and give me ears to hear it and
[26:35] a heart to receive it and because if he
[26:39] hadn't I would my estimation I would
[26:41] either be dead or in prison somewhere
[26:44] and I thought also about where would a
[26:46] church be tonight without a message
[26:49] without a TI poost without an absolute
[26:52] where would the church be what condition
[26:54] would the church be in well you can just
[26:57] look at every Church in the world today
[27:00] and tell where we would be and so how
[27:02] thankful we should be that we've got the
[27:05] voice that we have tonight and we don't
[27:08] come here and and have to listen to a
[27:10] tape we come here and get to listen to a
[27:13] tape and I'm so grateful that we got a
[27:17] voice that that that that no matter what
[27:20] any other voice we hear and politics and
[27:23] religion and the world today there's a
[27:26] voice that we can tie ourself to that we
[27:30] know will put us in a Rapture and so for
[27:33] that I was I'm so grateful you know for
[27:37] the elect's sake he did
[27:40] that and part of the portion of the
[27:42] message that we listened to last week
[27:44] brother Braham said my eyes cannot deny
[27:48] my hand and he said my foot or my toe or
[27:51] any part of me they can't deny it and
[27:53] neither can a man that's a part of the
[27:56] word of God or a woman
[27:58] deny one part of the word of God and he
[28:02] said that women when you think you can
[28:04] have bobbed hair and come into presence
[28:06] of God you're wrong you see he said
[28:09] you're wrong you can't come through
[28:10] God's filter whether you're Washed by
[28:13] the Water of the word he said then you
[28:16] enter into the fellowship by the washing
[28:19] of the water the word he said we enter
[28:22] into fellowship with him and he says you
[28:25] think that you are but you can't be
[28:27] until you come through the word and
[28:30] every little spot every little word of
[28:33] God he says man shall not live by bread
[28:36] alone but by every word it's got to come
[28:39] through that filtration aren't you
[28:42] thankful tonight for the filtration that
[28:45] no matter what anybody else says you can
[28:47] run it through God's filter and see if
[28:49] it's right or not he says and that gives
[28:52] a righteous man's taste he says because
[28:56] that's what he's looking for is that
[28:58] what you're looking for tonight Saints
[29:00] he says looking for something to cleanse
[29:03] him and that's what we want tonight
[29:05] Saints is to be cleansed by the word of
[29:08] God and he goes on and he says the word
[29:11] of God is a thinking man's filter and it
[29:14] makes a righteous man's taste and he
[29:18] says we know that's true filters all sin
[29:22] of unbelief out there's no more
[29:24] disbelief when you come through the
[29:26] filter because it's it's a true
[29:28] believer's taste and a True Believer
[29:32] wants to be right
[29:34] regardless a True Believer wants to be
[29:38] right Saints if we're wrong we want to
[29:40] be right if we want to be if there's
[29:43] something in our life that's off we want
[29:44] to be corrected but but our heart's
[29:47] desire is to be right tonight do y'all
[29:49] believe that amen let's just sing only
[29:51] believe as we listen to God's Prophet
[29:54] finish this message of a thinking man's
[29:56] filter oh
[29:58] only
[30:02] be
[30:04] only
[30:07] be all things are
[30:13] possible
[30:15] only
[30:19] believe
[30:21] only
[30:24] believe
[30:26] only be
[30:31] all things are
[30:36] possible
[30:38] only
[30:40] be amen God bless you tonight as we hear
[30:43] God servant and Prophet brother brand
[30:45] you may be
[30:48] seated a thinking man's taste when a
[30:52] thinking man hears the word of God my
[30:54] sheep you hear my voice a stranger they
[30:57] will I
[30:58] for down in there is
[31:01] life and life connects with
[31:04] life sin connects with sin and sin is so
[31:08] H
[31:10] hypocritical until it thinks that it's
[31:13] saved when it isn't
[31:16] S it's in the very depths of
[31:20] hypocrisy church members want a
[31:22] denomination filter so that they can
[31:25] have their own desire and still still be
[31:28] class religious people you hear say oh
[31:30] very religious in Africa out there one
[31:34] day and it's talking about these some of
[31:36] the kids that talk about these rock and
[31:37] roll songs at Elvis Presley and Emma
[31:40] sing and Pat Boon and whatever more
[31:43] Ricky Nelson and all them others I said
[31:45] there are a bunch of
[31:47] Renegades some little girls said well
[31:49] he's very religious I said so was
[31:52] Judas I said Judas only got 30 pieces of
[31:55] silver Elvis Pressley got million
[31:58] dollars they both sold out their birth
[32:02] right I said there nothing the very
[32:05] worse than denate the nation's
[32:08] God still just as deceiving as the
[32:11] filter of the cigarette these
[32:13] denominations let those members come in
[32:15] they ought to even be a there ought to
[32:17] be a law that they couldn't sing
[32:18] religious
[32:20] songs against or be against the law from
[32:23] to do it but the whole thing's become
[32:25] one great big pile of hypocrisy
[32:28] there's where they St today the
[32:30] truth for the soul says if you love the
[32:33] world are the things of the world the
[32:36] love of God's not even in you see you
[32:39] can't you can't say rock and roll is of
[32:41] the world is of the god rock and roll is
[32:45] of the world any of those dances and
[32:47] filtered nasty filthy things rather is
[32:50] of the world all of the world you can't
[32:53] say that bobbed hair for a woman is of
[32:56] God the Bible says this not so it's a
[32:59] filth of the world and if you love one
[33:01] Speck of the
[33:03] world the love of God's not even in see
[33:06] what's that what's drawing it it's
[33:08] something down on the inside drawing the
[33:10] soul is drawing your resource to the
[33:13] outside down through the spirit into the
[33:15] soul and if the soul loves the world
[33:18] it's
[33:19] dead I don't care how much anointed it
[33:21] is out here how righteous it is I hear
[33:23] down in here it's dead for he that loves
[33:26] the world are the things the world the
[33:28] love of God's not even in him no matter
[33:31] how
[33:32] religious the true filter that way will
[33:35] will set all those things out and bring
[33:37] nothing but the tress of God the word
[33:39] into their real true Soul they're like
[33:42] Esau out okay Esau was religious on the
[33:46] outside and when it comes to religion it
[33:48] see to be more religious than Jacob was
[33:51] you see to be a better man than Jacob
[33:53] was but the inside of him what he was
[33:57] his outwardly the
[33:59] religion but his thinking was not
[34:01] filtered he didn't think right of the
[34:04] birthright he he didn't think that God
[34:07] the birthright meant as much as God said
[34:09] it did D voice said I'm hungry what
[34:12] difference it make about the old birth
[34:13] right you can have it if you want it oh
[34:15] my see I go to church I'm just as good
[34:18] as you are my denomination just as
[34:21] that's one of the greatest in the world
[34:22] my mother belong to it my father belong
[34:24] to it all this that and the other my
[34:26] pastor was educated he's got so and so
[34:27] that putch in that much farther from
[34:29] God that ain't a thinking man's filter
[34:33] if it would how could Peter ever been
[34:36] what he was when he couldn't sign his
[34:38] own
[34:41] name but he packed the thinking man's
[34:45] filter notice oh
[34:49] my Esau thought that that birth right
[34:52] didn't mean what God said it did that
[34:54] was the difference between life and
[34:56] death and so like Eve and like Judas
[34:59] sold their
[35:02] Birthright for a satisfaction of the
[35:04] taste of the knowledge of
[35:06] civilization that's exactly what Eve
[35:09] sold her birthrights for she sold it for
[35:12] a little taste of
[35:13] science a little taste of worldly
[35:16] knowledge a little better church a
[35:18] little better glass of people today it
[35:20] would be called see and Judas sold his
[35:23] birth rights for 30 pieces of silver to
[35:26] make a few extra dollars my congregation
[35:28] can pay me better over here and I'll
[35:30] just preach over here see sold up I
[35:32] become a preacher well they said brother
[35:34] BR we believe that message is the truth
[35:35] but we can't accept it if we did well
[35:37] where would we preach at the world
[35:40] brother that's the
[35:42] parish certainly well none of the
[35:44] Brethren would back me up I I ain't
[35:46] looking for none of the Brethren to back
[35:47] me up I'm looking for Jesus Christ to
[35:49] back me up because he stood by he's the
[35:51] one who said it and when the true
[35:53] Birthright the blood filled out by the
[35:56] word of all sin and the world and church
[36:00] and denominations and sectarianism is
[36:03] Left Outside
[36:05] education
[36:07] civilization church denomination system
[36:11] sin of all types is left outside when a
[36:14] thinking man takes a thinking man's
[36:16] filter in God's
[36:17] estimation there's nothing left in it
[36:20] when a man draws his his life through a
[36:25] God's filter notice here your life is
[36:28] all messed up with sin because you were
[36:30] borned in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[36:33] the world speaking lies I'm going to say
[36:35] something as brother mull used to say
[36:37] listen to
[36:39] me when you come in this world you were
[36:42] born in
[36:43] sin you didn't even come with a Fighting
[36:47] Chance you were borned in sin shaped in
[36:50] iniquity come to the world speaking
[36:52] lives within your own Spirit the desire
[36:56] of sin a lover sin because you were born
[37:00] in sin you didn't have a
[37:03] chance but down inside of you somewhere
[37:06] here you
[37:08] come there was something in there that
[37:11] be to
[37:12] draw if you know it but something that
[37:14] told you there was a god somewhere and
[37:16] you read his word and you took the
[37:18] church you took their ideas when you was
[37:20] told better then you'd never use the
[37:23] thinking man's filter but when you use
[37:26] God's filter which is the thinking man's
[37:28] filter because all other filters will
[37:31] pass away but mine shall
[37:35] not and when you take God's filter and
[37:38] draw your life your
[37:41] desires if you draw your desires through
[37:44] God's filter a thinking man's filter
[37:47] there's nothing left but the Holy
[37:50] Ghost now if you want the evidence of
[37:52] the Holy Ghost there it
[37:54] is when that soul of your align with the
[37:57] word of God in every
[37:59] respect shows you draw your life through
[38:01] the thinking man's filter God filter
[38:05] notice is that God's filter he said we
[38:08] was Washed by the Water of the word and
[38:11] when God gave Adam and Eve a filter in
[38:14] the Garden of Eden he said don't you
[38:16] draw none of this in there but Satan
[38:18] punched the hole in say oh it's a little
[38:20] bit won't hurt just one drop too it's
[38:22] all it took to St death into the human
[38:25] race that's all it takes just one take
[38:27] the nicotine then they're gone there's
[38:31] nothing left but the Holy Ghost and then
[38:34] that shows that in you was that
[38:36] predestinated seed down in you that
[38:39] makes you hungry for God all the father
[38:42] has given me has given me to
[38:44] redeem they died with me at Calvary they
[38:47] raised with me in the resurrection all
[38:50] that he has given me will come to
[38:53] me they'll be placed in the body where
[38:55] foot arm nose mouth whatever it is
[38:58] they'll be placed in there and they will
[39:00] come to me in their
[39:03] season oh my There Is that real
[39:07] filteration of all the sin of the world
[39:10] and the love of the world is dead and
[39:12] the soul is drawing only one
[39:15] thing here it is don't remember don't
[39:17] forget it all you out there on the
[39:20] telephone set this down in your mind
[39:23] when a thinking
[39:26] man but begins to think who he's going
[39:29] to stand before and what the word of God
[39:32] is when he begins to think then when he
[39:36] draws to that there's nothing can get to
[39:39] it but the Holy Ghost what is it it's
[39:41] the germ seed word from the beginning
[39:46] that you was in God at the beginning sty
[39:48] here drawing the seed
[39:50] life the seed is in your heart before
[39:54] ordination Hallelujah
[39:58] the seed is already in there by the for
[40:01] knowledge of God
[40:03] predestinated and when it draws it can't
[40:05] draw through nothing else but the
[40:08] word and then it's the taste of the
[40:10] thinking
[40:12] man the righteous man the holy man who
[40:17] sees the Bible that Jesus Christ is the
[40:20] same yesterday and forever what comes
[40:22] into that place down there that word
[40:24] that's in the heart of hid Thy word in
[40:26] my heart that s not against
[40:28] what is it when it's drawing through the
[40:29] word there's only one thing will pass
[40:31] through the
[40:32] word that's the Holy
[40:36] Ghost that's the only thing that can
[40:39] pass through the word is the Holy Ghost
[40:42] and a thinking man's filter gives a holy
[40:46] man A Taste then he's tasted of the
[40:49] Heavenly P he's got the word of God in
[40:52] his heart he sees it manifested before
[40:54] him and his whole Soul's wrapped into
[40:58] and the world and all things is dead
[41:00] around him a thinking man's filter of
[41:05] religion and I'm thinking of filtering
[41:06] religion now when a thinking man's
[41:09] filter gives a holy man's
[41:11] taste see it satisfies his taste he sees
[41:15] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[41:17] today and forever there it is see right
[41:20] before us doing the same things he did
[41:22] it satisfies the holy man's taste his
[41:26] thinking he knows then that he's pass
[41:28] some death into life and he loves and
[41:32] and it loves for the world to be
[41:35] confirmed and wants the word to be
[41:37] confirmed and Vindicated in each age he
[41:40] waits for it for he is a holy man and
[41:44] he's got a desire to see God others just
[41:47] wants to join church this man wants to
[41:49] see God he don't see him in a bunch of
[41:52] Creeds he don't see him in big fine pipe
[41:54] organs or Cathedrals and high crosses
[41:57] are polished up Scholars with their
[41:59] collars turned around he doesn't see him
[42:01] in
[42:03] theolog in a theologian he sees him in
[42:06] the confirmation of his word I seen him
[42:09] in the watch firir
[42:11] of my eyes have seen the glory of the
[42:14] coming of the Lord he's tramping out the
[42:16] Vintage where The Grapes of Wrath are
[42:18] stored he's loose of faithful lightning
[42:20] with his terrible Swift sword his truth
[42:22] keeps marching on it will to the end yes
[42:26] sir
[42:27] see what I mean a filter man or thinking
[42:31] man's filter a man that wants to stand
[42:33] in the presence of God what was God's
[42:36] filter his
[42:38] word that day you eat thereof that day
[42:40] you die don't care what's happening out
[42:43] here don't you pass that
[42:45] word washed By the Waters of the word a
[42:48] thinking man's filter not a denomination
[42:51] not a Creed not a church not a cathedral
[42:53] but a thinking man's filter for you're
[42:56] going to be judged by the
[42:58] word a thinking man will think
[43:02] that a foolish man or a taste of the
[43:05] world will just take anything a
[43:07] substitute why a substitute when there's
[43:09] a real one think just think of it a
[43:12] minute a woman speaking in tongues with
[43:17] bobbed hair and lipstick
[43:18] on and then the church still holds to it
[43:22] that's the evidence the Holy Ghost
[43:27] or a preacher from a seminary or some
[43:30] Bible School using the trinitarian
[43:35] baptism or compromising with the words
[43:38] of some Creed or
[43:40] denomination is that a thinking man's
[43:44] filter not the way I see it brother it's
[43:47] a foolish man drawing through
[43:51] that right could you imagine that
[43:54] instead of using God's word as a filter
[43:57] for his soul letting that old Creed and
[44:00] denomination piling on top of him like
[44:02] that instead of taking God's word for a
[44:04] filter and then he's all contaminated
[44:07] and let him induce into him doctrines of
[44:09] man doing things almost deceiving the
[44:12] very elected and neglecting the word
[44:15] when he could draw to his own soul if
[44:17] there's anything in there to draw about
[44:20] but if that
[44:22] predestinated
[44:24] seed don't miss this if if that
[44:27] predestinated seed is not in there it
[44:30] will not draw through there because
[44:34] it'll draw for its desire if a smoking
[44:37] man wants a smoking man's taste and if
[44:40] he got a hold of a stick I say suck your
[44:42] finger and he's stood there stuck in his
[44:44] finger well he said that's silly why his
[44:48] taste is for
[44:50] nicotine so he's not a thinking man see
[44:54] but he said I don't I don't taste
[44:56] nothing I want to taste the I want to
[44:58] taste the backa I don't taste the thing
[45:00] give him a clo pin let him suck on
[45:04] that they suck on that he said I don't
[45:06] taste nothing what you sucking on it for
[45:08] then you've got a desire to taste
[45:11] nicotine and when you're sucking on a
[45:14] church
[45:15] Creed and still you women wear bobbed
[45:18] hair painted faces and is sexy dress and
[45:20] you man look at them and all these other
[45:22] things and carry on the way you do what
[45:24] is it what's in there the world still in
[45:27] there and you got a taste you're pulling
[45:31] on it for a taste I go to this church
[45:33] and don't ever name that thing they
[45:34] don't say nothing about this nothing
[45:35] about that none of these things are
[45:36] brought up our preacher is more wide
[45:39] minded than that we don't say things
[45:40] like that what is it you've got the
[45:42] taste of the world you're sucking
[45:45] for right but a thinking woman won't
[45:48] take that kind of a thing she knows
[45:51] she's got to be
[45:53] holy and the only thing that you can
[45:55] draw through God's word is the spirit
[45:59] the quickening power to make the word
[46:02] itself which is in you live to manifest
[46:05] Jesus Christ in the age of your
[46:07] living
[46:09] Hallelujah brother if that ain't the
[46:12] truth I don't know what the truth is
[46:14] I've lost my mind if that isn't the
[46:17] truth it is the word
[46:20] itself in your heart predestinated there
[46:25] that's drawing and spits out that world
[46:28] it don't want it but when it gets over
[46:30] here in the word it begins to draw and
[46:33] when it draws to the word it can be
[46:37] nothing else but the holy ghost that
[46:39] Quicken that
[46:42] word than a thinking religious man's
[46:46] filter is the word and it satisfies that
[46:51] Holy taste that's in his heart a
[46:54] thinking man's filter a holy man's taste
[46:59] oh
[47:00] my what we're into instead of using
[47:03] God's filter for his soul he's letting
[47:06] Satan deceive him by some denomination
[47:10] or Creed just exactly like the tobacco
[47:12] companies are deceiving you people who
[47:14] smoke cigarettes you just get more
[47:16] members and that's all oh let me close

[55:46] thinking woman's filter you'll come out
[55:49] with a holy woman's
[55:50] dress that's right you'll come out
[55:54] brother with a holy man's look now
[55:55] that's just one thing everything that
[55:57] you do pass it through the filter of
[55:59] God's word see if it's right or wrong
[56:02] you'll come out with a holy woman's
[56:03] dress with long hair decently dressed a
[56:07] quite humble Spirit not up brawling and
[56:10] fighting and carrying on a quite Meek
[56:13] Spirit which is a great treasure from
[56:17] God the Bible said
[56:19] so now I want to ask you something out
[56:22] in the lands we're going to close in a
[56:23] few minutes now let us all tonight check
[56:26] our desires and then you can see what
[56:31] kind of a filter you've been drawing
[56:34] through let's check each one of us here
[56:37] and out Across the Nation check your
[56:39] desires what you want really in life
[56:42] check what you're fighting for check
[56:44] what you're here for check what you go
[56:46] to church for what makes you it's good
[56:49] to go to church but don't just don't go
[56:50] to church only that won't save you he
[56:53] just check just a few minutes say is my
[56:56] objective what what kind of a filter am
[56:58] I drawing to
[56:59] anyhow and if you won't cope with the
[57:01] word of God and your soul don't do it
[57:03] then need something
[57:05] wrong for it shows up your taste that
[57:09] the life what kind of a life is in you
[57:12] if it's a holy discreet honorable it'll
[57:15] come out that way if it isn't you've got
[57:17] another taste in you you're drawing from
[57:20] exactly right if the taste is the word
[57:23] of God and the will of God then you know
[57:26] what what's in you what's drawing The
[57:27] Taste shows you are a part of that word
[57:32] that word is in you drawing from the
[57:34] word what's it drawing it's drawing
[57:36] through the word because you are a part
[57:38] of the body of Christ of this age and if
[57:42] that word is in you it can only draw
[57:44] through the word the spirit that
[57:46] quickens that word that's in you this
[57:50] the word alone won't live that's the
[57:52] reason all the father has given me will
[57:56] come to me and if I be lifted up I'll
[57:58] draw all man unto me see see the Father
[58:02] the part of the body of Christ that's in
[58:04] the world predestinated put into the
[58:06] heart any man that's a real Christian
[58:08] born again today knows since he was a
[58:10] little kid or a little girl either that
[58:13] there was something in you that hungered
[58:15] for God and you tried joining churches
[58:18] and everything else it wouldn't work why
[58:19] was it it was that word you was hunting
[58:23] for a filter and one day ADV before you
[58:26] you seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[58:29] today and forever that satisfied The
[58:32] Taste because life is in you drawing see
[58:35] the life in you is drawing it's it's
[58:37] telling what desire you got you're
[58:38] you're pulling you can't pull through
[58:40] this and that and the other you've got
[58:41] to find that right filter because you're
[58:43] a thinking
[58:44] person if you're a thinking person you
[58:47] are predestinated or filtered for from
[58:51] the for the foundation of the world and
[58:53] if a denominational Minister hears this
[58:59] I hope that he takes the thinking man's
[59:02] filter if he's a denomination
[59:05] Minister then he'll throw down that
[59:07] denominational pack that's sure to
[59:10] perish because it's a word of man and
[59:13] accept God's filtered word that can
[59:16] never fail nor pass away and it will
[59:19] suit the holy man's taste and like Jacob
[59:23] will sacrifice all the world and the
[59:26] appetites of every denomination or fame
[59:29] that there is in the world where you can
[59:31] be Bishop Cardinal where you can be a
[59:33] state preser or Pastor some great church
[59:36] you'll sacrifice everything that there
[59:38] is not like Esau to become part of the
[59:40] world but like
[59:42] Jacob you'll give everything you got to
[59:45] obtain the birth right the
[59:48] filtered of the thinking man because
[59:51] it'll give you the holy man's taste and
[59:54] it will satisfy
[59:57] and it be satisfy and will sanctify with
[1:00:00] the Eternal Taste of the Holy goodness
[1:00:03] of God remember Satan punched the first
[1:00:06] hole through Eve's mind or her thinking
[1:00:10] to let the taste of his wisdom and
[1:00:12] knowledge get through now think of this
[1:00:15] I'm closing Satan punched the first hole
[1:00:18] through because all she could draw was
[1:00:21] the word that was the spirit through the
[1:00:24] word of God because she's said as long
[1:00:26] as you breathe through this filter
[1:00:28] you'll never die but you take a breath
[1:00:31] of this I hear it you'll die see and
[1:00:34] Satan said but you don't know nothing
[1:00:36] here but you take a little taste of this
[1:00:38] year and then you'll know you'll be like
[1:00:40] God see he knows right wrong you don't
[1:00:43] and if you just take a little taste of
[1:00:44] this and she let him punch a hole in it
[1:00:48] just one little
[1:00:51] hole now you see why I say say why don't
[1:00:54] you teach women and so forth how to
[1:00:56] receive gifts and things like that I
[1:00:58] said how can you teach them algebra when
[1:01:00] they won't even learn their
[1:01:02] ABC one little hole all it took he took
[1:01:07] the world's wisdom and when he did it
[1:01:10] set death to the whole family wanting to
[1:01:13] taste of wisdom now look at the
[1:01:15] filter and
[1:01:17] certainly it expressed her taste her
[1:01:21] taste was for the world that's what
[1:01:23] she's got that's what it is today they
[1:01:25] love the the world and the things of the
[1:01:27] world with a form of godliness but
[1:01:29] denying the power thereof see Satan let
[1:01:32] him speak in tongues he let him shout he
[1:01:34] let him have Divine Healing service he
[1:01:35] let do all these kind of things he say
[1:01:37] many will come to me that day and Lord
[1:01:38] have not I cast out Devils have not I
[1:01:40] done many things done this he say I
[1:01:42] didn't even know you you worker of
[1:01:45] iniquity when the word was placed right
[1:01:47] before you and you still sucked that old
[1:01:49] filter of the
[1:01:51] world see shows the taste that was in
[1:01:53] the heart doves cannot eat a
[1:01:57] Caren they cannot eat it they don't have
[1:02:01] any
[1:02:02] Gall a crow can eat the seed like a dove
[1:02:05] and can eat a car like a crow see
[1:02:09] because he's a hypocrite but a dove is
[1:02:12] not built like any other Bird that's why
[1:02:16] God represent himself as a dove
[1:02:18] descending from Heaven see it cannot it
[1:02:21] cannot stand the stink of a can it's not
[1:02:26] vulture the reason it don't have any
[1:02:28] Gall it couldn't digest it it would kill
[1:02:31] it if it eat it and a dove never has to
[1:02:34] take a
[1:02:35] bath a Dove's body puts out oil from the
[1:02:39] inside that keeps it
[1:02:41] clean it's a life that's in the Dove it
[1:02:45] generates in it an oil that keeps the
[1:02:47] feathers clean and so is a Christian
[1:02:50] there's a life within
[1:02:53] him that keeps them clean
[1:02:57] it's
[1:03:00] filtered oh notice now look at he at the
[1:03:06] filter and certainly you can see the
[1:03:09] taste thereof of what they're doing
[1:03:11] today look at this modern Church look at
[1:03:13] the filter you can see what they love
[1:03:16] see what they got the love what do they
[1:03:18] love miss lady
[1:03:21] oia which is hated for God's judgment
[1:03:25] that's right
[1:03:26] the love the church love today is for
[1:03:28] lady oia a great organization a great
[1:03:31] setup a great poer thing F dressed
[1:03:34] people highly cultured full of wisdom
[1:03:36] full of the devil am under the deceit of
[1:03:39] the Church of
[1:03:41] Christ there's only one word ought to be
[1:03:43] in there
[1:03:45] Antichrist or everything that Christ
[1:03:47] taught they're against practically
[1:03:49] everything just enough so they can call
[1:03:51] themselves that now if you are a
[1:03:54] thinking people tonight here and out in
[1:03:57] the land where the message is going your
[1:04:00] desire will be a Bible taste not a
[1:04:04] denominational taste for you will be
[1:04:07] judged by the very Bible the word that
[1:04:10] I'm asking you to filter your soul
[1:04:12] through and to reject one word of it and
[1:04:16] not let your soul pass through that one
[1:04:18] word you'll be turn down for a man shall
[1:04:22] not
[1:04:22] live Breathe by bread alone but by every
[1:04:28] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:04:31] God it will be brought into you
[1:04:33] predestinated and when the Lord breathes
[1:04:35] upon you his spirit will Quicken that
[1:04:37] word to a reality and you'll see that
[1:04:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:04:42] and forever oh my leave the world's
[1:04:45] denomination religious pack let it lay
[1:04:48] like that cigarette pack in the woods
[1:04:51] Let It Rock in the Cain
[1:04:56] it's it's a wrong filter and take the
[1:04:59] word which is Christ that gives and
[1:05:03] reaches and
[1:05:05] preserves the taste of eternal life to
[1:05:09] everyone that will take
[1:05:11] it eternal life the word if you're are
[1:05:15] predestinated you SI there's no way to
[1:05:18] hide it from you you look there and say
[1:05:20] watch this plain before my face I look
[1:05:22] at it there it is I'm looking right at
[1:05:24] it I see it there it is the word every
[1:05:26] word just word by word living out then
[1:05:29] there's a taste of eternal life that you
[1:05:32] want and when you breathe through that
[1:05:34] what can come through that God's filter
[1:05:36] nothing but the
[1:05:38] spirit no world at all no unel at all
[1:05:43] it's God's filter and when you breathe
[1:05:46] through that nothing can get through
[1:05:48] that but the Holy
[1:05:50] Ghost now you got the evidence of the
[1:05:52] Holy Ghost see uh God holy man or
[1:05:57] woman's taste they want to live they got
[1:06:00] eternal life and because it's words
[1:06:01] quickened to them they live a thinking
[1:06:06] man's filter and a holy man's taste
[1:06:11] don't take the world like them cigarette
[1:06:14] companies under deception but take the
[1:06:16] real thinking man's filter filter the
[1:06:20] breath that you breathe the food that
[1:06:22] you eat everything that you are
[1:06:25] breathing through God's
[1:06:27] word and you'll have a holy man's taste
[1:06:31] for it will produce that for he's the
[1:06:33] same yesterday today and forever and I
[1:06:35] know whether we are whether we are not I
[1:06:38] believe that we are but if we are not
[1:06:41] there's somebody in the world today
[1:06:44] that's part of the body of Christ and it
[1:06:47] will live only by the word of God every
[1:06:51] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[1:06:53] God for this age that we're living in
[1:06:55] now
[1:06:57] and I can't see where denomination of
[1:06:59] those words so plainly in the Bible said
[1:07:01] it would happen and the things that
[1:07:02] would be in here we are living right in
[1:07:04] it now I can't see where it could be
[1:07:06] anything else for this church I realize
[1:07:08] I've got to stand with you in the
[1:07:09] Judgment someday father be it for me to
[1:07:12] ever tell you anything wrong for
[1:07:14] popularity I don't want that if I had my
[1:07:17] desire i' just my human desire I'd take
[1:07:19] my rifle and go to the woods and build
[1:07:20] me a cabin and trap the rest of my life
[1:07:23] I'm getting old tired weary and broke
[1:07:25] down
[1:07:26] but I can't quit there's something in me
[1:07:30] grinding W unto me if I don't tell the
[1:07:33] truth and the whole truth War to me if I
[1:07:35] don't stand here till the last breath of
[1:07:37] body has left me I must stand regardless
[1:07:40] of what anyone else says I'm responsible
[1:07:43] before God and I truly believe that the
[1:07:46] thing that we're preaching is the truth
[1:07:48] not because it's me preaching it no my
[1:07:50] brother no sir God knows my heart I
[1:07:53] would like to sit out in the
[1:07:54] congregation and listen to to the
[1:07:55] anointed preach how much easier it would
[1:07:57] be on me certainly because I'd have
[1:07:59] eternal life as same as the man in the
[1:08:00] Pulpit I'm a part of it as same as he is
[1:08:03] I go to the same heaven have the same
[1:08:05] privileges how easy it would be for me
[1:08:07] to sit out there and not take all these
[1:08:08] bruises and beats and carry on how easy
[1:08:11] it would be we're out there all night
[1:08:13] with no sleep an hour and a half or two
[1:08:15] hours wrestling all night with things
[1:08:17] that's come up how easy it for me to do
[1:08:19] that take up my gun the next morning my
[1:08:20] fishing rod and go fishing or hunting
[1:08:22] how easy it would be brother if my
[1:08:27] lot God help me to never shun my post of
[1:08:30] Duty but to stand loyal and true and
[1:08:32] produce to you a thinking man's filter
[1:08:36] that'll give you a holy man's taste the
[1:08:38] thinking man filter is the Waters of the
[1:08:41] Waters of Separation it's a purification
[1:08:43] from sin which is the word of
[1:08:46] God and the thinking man the man that
[1:08:49] knows he's got to stand before God knows
[1:08:51] he's got to answer for every word of the
[1:08:53] Bible it'll satisfy that taste that's in
[1:08:56] your heart may God help us to receive it
[1:08:58] as we bow our
[1:09:01] heads dear
[1:09:03] God another hour or two has passed on
[1:09:08] the clock has moved around
[1:09:11] now the message now goes into
[1:09:17] history and it's recorded on the
[1:09:19] book we all have to answer now for this
[1:09:22] every move that we made every word that
[1:09:24] we said every thought went through your
[1:09:26] mind the record is still
[1:09:28] playing and it'll play on till life is
[1:09:31] over and then we'll answer at the day of
[1:09:34] the Judgment oh God the great creator of
[1:09:38] heavens and earth whom we do believe I
[1:09:41] pray for this people of this day I pray
[1:09:44] for myself with them that Lord Jesus
[1:09:47] that you'll hold your filter and if I'm
[1:09:49] saying anything sacriligious Lord I in
[1:09:52] my heart I don't know it I pray that if
[1:09:54] it's wrong for me to take your word and
[1:09:56] use such a thing as that you forgive me
[1:09:58] for it but Lord I thought when you spoke
[1:10:02] to me there in the woods you know the
[1:10:03] time in the morning it just I couldn't
[1:10:06] get it off my mind I accepted it as
[1:10:08] coming from you so father God I have
[1:10:12] already spoken and I pray God that
[1:10:15] you'll let it be in the way that I
[1:10:17] thought it to be that the thinking man
[1:10:19] the man if he's got any thinking at all
[1:10:22] he'll know he has to stand in the
[1:10:23] presence of God and he won't take into
[1:10:25] his soul anything that contaminates or
[1:10:28] it's contrary to the word of
[1:10:30] God father we realize that as I compared
[1:10:34] it with these organizations of the day
[1:10:36] not to be different Lord you'll judge me
[1:10:39] someday from my
[1:10:41] heart and I pray God that you'll see
[1:10:44] that it wasn't to be different but it
[1:10:46] was to be honest to try to be sincere
[1:10:50] realizing I hold the purchase of your
[1:10:52] blood from coast to coast right now in
[1:10:54] my hand
[1:10:56] and many of them has believe the report
[1:11:00] God Of Heaven May there not be one of
[1:11:02] them lost I claim them everyone and hold
[1:11:05] before them the filter from sin the
[1:11:08] Waters of Separation the blood of Jesus
[1:11:11] Christ the word made flesh Grant it Lord
[1:11:15] May the Holy Spirit pour through every
[1:11:17] promise into our souls and may we be
[1:11:21] living representatives of the Bride of
[1:11:23] Jesus Christ in the time of the eyes of
