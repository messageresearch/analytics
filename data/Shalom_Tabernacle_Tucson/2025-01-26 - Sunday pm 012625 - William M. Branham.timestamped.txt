[15:02] I just have a quick little
[15:03] testimony my niece had been going
[15:06] through um an investigation one of the
[15:09] doctors she just had twin babies and
[15:12] they thought they were
[15:13] underweight but the doctor just was not
[15:16] being reasonable with her and so they'd
[15:19] had an investigation on her from
[15:21] November till just this last week but
[15:24] when brother po was preaching on
[15:26] Wednesday about being patient and just
[15:28] waiting on the Lord and how God loves to
[15:30] see us when we're going through things
[15:32] and we don't get angry at him but we
[15:35] just praise him and I just started
[15:38] calling out on her behalf again in the
[15:41] middle of the night she came on my heart
[15:43] and just to get a call the next day from
[15:46] her saying everything was good the
[15:47] doctors all stood up for her on her
[15:49] behalf and the babies were fine and so
[15:52] just a burden lifted but a lot of people
[15:54] didn't know but I just want to thank the
[15:56] Lord for that
[16:03] [Music]

[16:17] lies they don't

[39:18] me Leo one of my recording boys sick old
[39:22] Vol je the same way Billy the same way
[39:25] be the same way so oh this
[39:29] weather I believe I'd have to come down
[39:32] and stay uh sometime in the summertime
[39:34] to uh or winter time to get used to it
[39:37] for
[39:38] summer but I imagine if you come up to
[39:40] my house when it's about 28 below zero
[39:43] you PR want to stay in the house that's
[39:45] when we all want to go
[39:46] R about 28 below zero it's just what
[39:50] part of the country we get customed to
[39:52] and sometimes a different part Mr Mo
[39:55] believe was tell me today that David in
[39:57] the army camp over somewhere in Texas
[40:00] and him being used to this weather here
[40:01] he said he got so sick last year he
[40:03] couldn't even drive his car home Hardy
[40:05] the weather being so hot and it may seem
[40:07] like it's awful nice and cool to you all
[40:10] but you're the
[40:13] US well there's one thing it's a good
[40:16] time to preach repentance isn't when you
[40:18] got we like
[40:20] that es so we're happy tonight to know
[40:24] that we're on the grounds of the
[40:26] Forgiveness of our
[40:27] sins and on the grounds of Eternal
[40:31] salvation looking for the coming of the
[40:33] Lord

[40:47] everything the cases of PO on the rageed

[40:53] like about time one thing gets started
[40:55] common while another thing starts up

[40:59] something and looks like it'll take care
[41:01] of that in a few years here turns up and
[41:03] gives a great thing that nearly kills a
[41:05] patient man so only thing we can hope
[41:08] for is the coming of the
[41:10] Lord that's when all troubles to be
[41:14] over they looking back over my shoulder
[41:16] at sister Anna I thought hard all right

[41:58] thing I read a little Talmer girl here
[42:00] her husband left also yesterday or
[42:04] somewhere way away so bless these young
[42:07] women and just remember this Jesus said
[42:12] that he will not forsake his father his
[42:16] mother wife daughter children and
[42:19] whatever it is and clean to me is not
[42:21] worthy of to be my disciples right so
[42:26] Peter said we have taken all our wives
[42:28] our children our homes to allity what
[42:31] shall we receive in the Kingdom he said
[42:33] verely verely I say unto you that you'll
[42:35] set on 12 Thrones Jud in the 12 times of
[42:38] it oh my now you know I don't want to do
[42:41] that and really from the bottom of my
[42:43] heart I don't want nothing great
[42:45] classical you know what I want I just
[42:48] want to look at
[42:50] it I I just want to see old colored man
[42:55] here's some time ago he got saved at an
[42:59] old camp meeting and so he went back nor
[43:02] where the old colored folks down in the
[43:03] South used to go around have a himn
[43:05] singings at night so next morning he was
[43:08] telling all the slaves that he was free
[43:11] yeah so the boss heard him say that so
[43:13] he said what's this sandle you said you
[43:15] just

[45:23] you that's going spend a lifetime now
[45:27] being it's warm tonight and we don't
[45:29] this beginning of the week now and
[45:32] tomorrow night if there is someone here
[45:35] to be prayed for or we'll pray for the
[45:37] sick tomorrow night the Lord with us and
[45:40] now I don't blame the people not coming
[45:43] our church
[45:45] Vis my how hot and so and Romans the 8th
[45:52] chapter and the first verse we want to
[45:54] consider this just for a little while
[45:58] Romans 8 and
[46:01] 1 there is therefore now no condemnation
[46:05] to them which are in Christ who walk not
[46:08] after the flesh but after the spirit
[46:12] amen now our heavenly father we pray now
[46:16] that you will get our minds centered on
[46:18] the spirit of God and may He lead us not
[46:21] knowing what to say but thou will
[46:24] provide the words and I pray that you'll
[46:27] lead us to a a great meeting Lord where
[46:30] the seat of God will fall deep into the
[46:32] heart of every person the unsaved be
[46:35] saved and The
[46:37] Sinner backslider be called back to God
[46:41] again and the sick be healed for this we
[46:44] ask in Christ's name
[46:48] amen led by the spirit of God do you
[46:52] believe in man of God are led by the
[46:56] spirit of God
[46:57] that's right now Paul speaking here to
[47:01] the Romans said there is therefore now
[47:04] no
[47:05] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[47:11] Jesus now that walk not after if you're
[47:15] in Christ Jesus and you walk not after
[47:18] the flesh but after the
[47:21] spirit now you know it's a it's a danger
[47:24] thing when we go to Fain that many times
[47:27] the Christians who are filled with the
[47:30] holy spirit will still walk after the
[47:33] flesh did you know that they'll do it
[47:37] and then the Holy Spirit gets away from
[47:38] them as we've been saying I you see
[47:41] people sometimes someone rais up and
[47:43] speak in tongues which will be God and
[47:47] maybe someone say glory to God I can do
[47:49] that too that's flesh see you have to be
[47:53] led by the
[47:55] spirit Lord and I was just telling the
[47:57] other day while brother Jack and I were
[47:59] out visiting a a Lutheran
[48:02] Seminary and they were asking about
[48:04] these Divine gifts I told them how I did
[48:08] it at my church I see it many times that
[48:11] I feel that Full Gospel people who
[48:13] believe in those gifts not only that but
[48:16] there's many Baptist churches and many
[48:18] of them speak with tongues certainly
[48:20] Charles Fuller has speaking in tongues
[48:22] at Long Beach but he an interpretation
[48:25] spoke up on the radio just recently tell
[48:27] them about how they spoke in Tong
[48:29] interpreted said but if there was no
[48:31] interpreter what was the flesh but said
[48:33] if anyone spoke they all kept real quiet
[48:35] so and see what the interpretation is I
[48:38] here's the way we did it at home when I
[48:40] received the Holy Spirit seeing these
[48:42] things was for the church we found if
[48:44] somebody spoke in tongues then if there
[48:48] was no interpreter we had them to keep
[48:50] hold their feet that's right they're not
[48:52] supposed to speak in public like that
[48:54] but then when they become an interpreter
[48:56] some one could interpret how we didn't
[48:58] want just a bunch of foolishness we had
[49:00] to be genuine so we had all those people
[49:03] to meet all the gifted people those who
[49:05] had Revelations those who had the word
[49:08] of Prophecy and those who had the
[49:10] interpretation and speaking of tongues
[49:13] and they gathered at the church about an
[49:15] hour before the church ever started they
[49:18] come in for their own Ministry and they
[49:20] set in the church kept quiet and the
[49:23] Lord speak a message now before that
[49:26] message could be received and give to
[49:28] the church there had to be three there
[49:31] with the spirit of discernment and two
[49:33] of that three had to witness it was of
[49:35] God if it was they never even counted it
[49:38] at all but now it couldn't be according
[49:40] to scripture because God told us not use
[49:43] vain repetition it had to be some
[49:45] message directed to some person in the
[49:48] church or it wasn't received then say
[49:51] for instance like this somebody raise up
[49:53] and say thus sayth the Lord tonight at
[49:56] the service there will be a lady coming
[49:58] in with her bandage around her head she
[50:01] was in an automobile accent 5 years ago
[50:04] and she can't be healed and they bring
[50:06] her from a certain place have brothers
[50:08] so and so as soon as she comes in
[50:10] they'll be coming from Michigan to lay
[50:12] his hands up on her for thus sayth the
[50:14] Lord she's going to be healed now
[50:16] everybody kept quiet after a while one
[50:19] of them with the spirit of ger say I
[50:20] believe that was the Lord another now
[50:22] well remember your words of State other
[50:25] say I believe it was of the Lord all
[50:26] right it's put out that's put on my desk
[50:29] I'm in the room praying all the time all
[50:31] right then the next thing you know
[50:33] somebody spok in tongues and give a
[50:35] message said thus sayth the Lord have
[50:37] brother Henry Jones to move away from
[50:39] the place where he's at because there
[50:41] some large trees stand there for thus
[50:43] sayith the Lord tomorrow afternoon by
[50:45] 2:00 there's coming a hurricane go blow
[50:47] all those trees down having to be out of
[50:49] the way thus sayith the Lord it had to
[50:52] be to someone a message to the church
[50:55] now theny one of the interpreters or one
[50:58] of the man with the discernment said I
[51:00] believe it's of the Lord they say I
[51:02] believe it's of the lord well if they do
[51:03] that then they put it down put it on the
[51:05] desk and when I come out just before the
[51:07] service started I read these messages
[51:09] off to the church that already had their
[51:11] name signed for the discernment to say
[51:13] that they was from the Lord Brother
[51:15] Henry Jones got away as quick as he
[51:16] could we watched for the woman if she
[51:19] didn't come or the storm didn't come
[51:21] then I made him everyone get to the
[51:22] Altar and get that evil spirit away from
[51:24] him right not right God don't speak lies
[51:28] he tells the
[51:29] truth God tells the truth so that's what
[51:32] I found amongst the people so much of it
[51:34] here in California not long ago I was
[51:36] fixing to make an alar call and a lady
[51:39] raised up and began speaking in Tong
[51:42] just broke the alar called the pie now I
[51:44] don't say that but the well then some
[51:46] woman got way back over there and give
[51:48] some kind of a sign all of you be ready
[51:49] the Lord to coming so forth we know that
[51:52] that wasn't nothing directed so then I
[51:54] never s was my meting so when the next
[51:58] couple days after that she met Billy
[52:00] Paul out there she said tell your daddy
[52:01] get ready when he goes to give his life
[52:03] story call I've got another message I
[52:05] got to give now that won't work now
[52:08] that's flesh I don't condemn the person
[52:10] but I condemn the the way they're using
[52:12] the gifts of God if they're used
[52:14] correctly they're the most marvelous
[52:16] things there is but if you don't use
[52:18] them right it'll bring a disgrace to the
[52:20] church so we must be led of the spirit
[52:25] and when we're LED of of the spirit then
[52:28] God makes everything work just exactly
[52:30] in harmony now if they give this message
[52:33] and I give it out and the lady comes in
[52:35] here she is everybody's wondering where
[52:36] she's at every while here she comes in
[52:38] pack her in on a stretcher I know
[52:40] exactly what to do the Holy Spirit done
[52:42] spoke go lay hands on her she's going to
[52:44] be healed that's exactly what happens
[52:46] and the next thing next day brother
[52:48] Henry Jones gets away from those big
[52:50] trees or waiting the railroad track
[52:51] where they going to have a wreck or he
[52:52] doesn't go down to this corner for a
[52:54] certain thing or whatever it is and the
[52:56] next thing we see that happen perfectly
[52:58] that way then we say thank you Lord
[53:00] Jesus for warning us we love you because
[53:02] you're with us and you're showing your
[53:04] signs and wonders and we love you and we
[53:06] adore you and we just pour out to you
[53:09] the whole Adoration of our heart for
[53:11] being so good to us see now if those
[53:13] gifts are used right they're to edify
[53:15] the church and you let one come in un
[53:18] learn and watch and see what happens
[53:19] that way you'll find out he Shivers run
[53:21] up his back and he get right with God
[53:24] but when they're just misconstrued and
[53:26] show out if that anyway I believe there
[53:29] are gifts but they don't know how to use
[53:31] them that's what we need is a teaching
[53:33] on how to use the gifts of
[53:36] God that's the reason they begin to
[53:38] dwindle out because the people don't use
[53:41] them rightly and we must do that Paul
[53:43] said he set the church in order telling
[53:46] just how and how to do it we try to put
[53:48] our church just exactly that way course
[53:50] and now since I've left wife it's been
[53:53] there's a Methodist Pastor there now was
[53:54] a Baptist just before me and or right
[53:57] after me brother now a Methodist brother
[53:58] has it and they don't teach those things
[54:01] they just let go ahead and preach the
[54:03] gospel and make all call go home but
[54:06] what the church needs tonight is know
[54:07] how to control these gifts see for evil
[54:12] spirits can come in and speak just the
[54:14] same as good spirits can speak you know
[54:16] that and you must have the spirit of
[54:18] discernment to know that they had it in
[54:19] the Bible time why if they didn't do it
[54:22] then why did Paul say Let One judge and
[54:24] the people judge and so forth those
[54:26] Gifts of Prophecy everything is supposed
[54:27] to be correctly put in order for Satan
[54:30] can imitate every gift that God's
[54:33] got every gift he can imitate it and you
[54:36] must know the right and wrong and by its
[54:37] fruits you know it watch where it comes
[54:39] to pass and whether it's truth or not
[54:41] and that's what you know the spirit now
[54:44] but sons of God we are led by the spirit
[54:48] of God there is therefore now no
[54:51] condemnation you don't have to worry
[54:52] about those things to those that are in
[54:55] Christ Jesus B
[54:57] walk not after the flesh say oh
[55:00] Hallelujah I a't speaking T glory to God
[55:02] I can do this no no that's wrong
[55:04] attitude that's the wrong attitude
[55:06] that's right don't do that see but
[55:09] here's what it is to those no
[55:11] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[55:13] that want not as the flesh but as the
[55:16] spirit now the next thing is how do you
[55:19] get into these spiritual gifts the Bible
[55:21] said by one Spirit we are all baptized
[55:25] into one body and that body is the body
[55:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ now this is a
[55:32] great thing for a ree Baptist preacher
[55:34] to say but I believe there's one Lord
[55:36] one baptism and and one calling and I
[55:41] believe that one baptism is not water I
[55:44] believe it's Holy Spirit baptism that
[55:47] we're baptized into the body of Christ
[55:50] not by water but by Spirit 1 Corinthians
[55:54] 12 and we are Sons and Daughters of God
[55:58] are led by the spirit of God after
[56:00] they've been baptized into the body of
[56:04] Believers oh how marvelous how sin
[56:07] opened the heart of the Lord Jesus and
[56:10] given us a issue of blood coming forth
[56:13] from him and through the life in that
[56:15] blood we go back by Holy Ghost baptism
[56:18] into the body of Christ the Lord oh my
[56:23] that make you forget the hot weather
[56:25] notice and while you're in that body you
[56:29] are just as free from condemnation as he
[56:33] is Lord you'll never have to stand any
[56:36] judgments God calls judgments to be
[56:39] struck upon his body and if you're in
[56:43] him God cannot judge you he's already
[56:46] judged you when he judged Christ amen
[56:49] and you can't be under judgment no more
[56:51] Christ took your judgment and when
[56:54] you're baptized into that body of Christ
[56:56] you are free from God's judgment the
[56:59] wrath of God will pass over you that's
[57:02] why he said when I see the blood I'll
[57:05] pass over you that's right that was the
[57:07] sacrificial lamb the blood was in the
[57:10] shape of the cross on the Lin and the
[57:11] door poost and was a sign that death can
[57:16] not come to that house and when death
[57:19] tries to strike us that separation from
[57:21] God then the blood is applied by the
[57:24] Lord Jesus Christ and the death cannot
[57:26] take it no sir for we are free then we
[57:30] are in Christ and led by the spirit of
[57:33] Christ L many man and nearly all man I
[57:38] say all man that's ever mounted to very
[57:40] much in this life has been man and women
[57:43] who have been led to do the gallent
[57:46] things they've done by the spirit of
[57:48] God I think tonight one of the greatest
[57:51] generals that America has ever had with
[57:54] Stonewall Jackson I believe there's
[57:56] never been a general like him since
[57:59] Joshua why was he done that he was a
[58:02] gallant man he was a man of prayer he he
[58:05] closed up everything even make all these
[58:07] generals and everything don't even eat
[58:08] breakfast or nothing and lay on their
[58:10] face and seek God yes sir General Grant
[58:15] um I'm Stonewall Jackson I'm thinking
[58:18] him instead of Grant General Grant was a
[58:21] drunk alcoholic but Stonewall Jackson
[58:25] was a Christian Christian
[58:27] gentleman and he loved the Book of
[58:30] Joshua and he wanted to be like Joshua
[58:33] and God gave him the desires of his
[58:35] heart and one day he was asked why is it
[58:38] Mr Jackson that you can stand in such
[58:43] opposition so many man against you and
[58:46] you take a little handful and stand he's
[58:48] a very timid sort of a fell little sharp
[58:51] fell kind of blueeyed and dark hair he
[58:54] kicked his boots on the Dust and he said
[58:56] I never put a glass of water to my mouth
[58:59] without thanking almighty God that's
[59:01] where it comes from right there where
[59:05] the secret lays trusting God being led
[59:08] by the spirit of God God speaks to man
[59:11] man hears his voice Noah in the early
[59:15] beginning at the end of Luan destruction
[59:18] when he was a man who feared God a
[59:20] farmer lived out on the farms and God
[59:24] spoke to him one day and he was led by
[59:27] the spirit of God to build an ark for
[59:31] the saving of his household and now God
[59:35] has spoke to Noah is the same God that
[59:37] speaks tonight and he speaks to Noah to
[59:41] make a way for the saving of his
[59:42] household he speaks to every man and the
[59:45] Way's already been made for the saving
[59:47] of your household the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:50] is vicarious suffering and death at
[59:53] Calvary and how that Noah now there was
[59:57] no sign of rain never had rained out of
[59:58] the heavens it always God watered
[1:00:01] through the Earth up through the streams
[1:00:04] irrigation life never rained out of the
[1:00:06] heavens but God told Noah that his
[1:00:09] judgments was coming yeah and he said as
[1:00:13] it was in the days of Noah so will it be
[1:00:16] in the coming of the son of man your
[1:00:18] judgment is bound to Strife for man had
[1:00:22] continually to get Evil all the thoughts
[1:00:26] was evil they are all kinds of devices
[1:00:28] it's like we got today really a smarter
[1:00:32] people than we are today they built the
[1:00:34] Pyramid and the Sphinx and many of those
[1:00:36] things there that our Modern Machinery
[1:00:38] couldn't touch we couldn't no long us
[1:00:41] touch it they must have had a control of
[1:00:43] atom power gasoline power electrical
[1:00:46] power would never lift those Boulders
[1:00:49] and build such as the pyramid they weigh
[1:00:51] hundreds of tons and Ste away in the air
[1:00:55] about a city block High mostly and how
[1:00:58] do they ever get him up there that's the
[1:01:00] Myster and so perfect Masons till a
[1:01:02] razor blade couldn't go between them
[1:01:05] hone down his Masterpiece his
[1:01:09] Mastermind and they got so smart and so
[1:01:13] shrew and the Bible said they become
[1:01:15] workers of wood workers of brass a great
[1:01:19] day of uh science and they got so smart
[1:01:23] till they figured they just outsmarted
[1:01:25] God and didn't need him any longer and
[1:01:28] then God not willing that any should
[1:01:31] perish talk to a man out in a field one
[1:01:33] day Noah and told him to erect an ark to
[1:01:37] protect him from the
[1:01:40] judgments God let him to do it and Noah
[1:01:44] R away took his old crude tools and so
[1:01:47] forth and begin to build away on the ark
[1:01:51] and as he built away and God told him
[1:01:54] how to fix it I've often wondered that
[1:01:57] type of wood that he said to build it
[1:01:59] out of what kind of wood was that to be
[1:02:02] a cheddam wood I wondered what kind that
[1:02:05] was and reading up on it once I find out
[1:02:09] that it was a b goer wood is what he
[1:02:11] said to build it out of goer wood and uh
[1:02:14] the reading up on this goer wood it was
[1:02:16] the most lightest wood that there is in
[1:02:18] the world like bossom just real light
[1:02:23] and if you'd put that in the water it
[1:02:25] would sink immediately if you had water
[1:02:27] log and sink right down and then when we
[1:02:32] find out that God told him to pitch it
[1:02:34] on the inside and out and how they
[1:02:36] pitched it they tuck and beat the rosin
[1:02:39] out of another tree and Bor it and
[1:02:41] poured into these pores that was so
[1:02:44] loose and emptied up and that rosm
[1:02:47] filled up the pores and tasted it over
[1:02:49] so hard till it be as hard as steel is
[1:02:51] now what a beautiful type of the church
[1:02:55] today it's all empted out the things of
[1:02:59] the world is gone the heart's all empted
[1:03:01] up and God beat one man of Our Kind
[1:03:05] Christ and he stood our judgment and by
[1:03:08] the blood of the Lord Jesus to the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost he pours it in it fills every Tab
[1:03:13] and every place where the world has been
[1:03:16] Ed out the Holy Ghost fills it up and
[1:03:19] chases it and seals
[1:03:21] it
[1:03:23] amen until that day the fiery judgments
[1:03:27] of God brother sisters so many people
[1:03:30] laugh about the baptism of the holy
[1:03:31] spirit it's the only thing that will
[1:03:34] save
[1:03:35] you not another thing God has no other
[1:03:39] way provided but for men and women to be
[1:03:43] filled with the Holy Spirit and led by
[1:03:46] the Holy
[1:03:48] Spirit correctly thank God God get his
[1:03:51] church all cased up you remember that
[1:03:54] pitch that they put in that rosin that
[1:03:57] was on the inside and outside of that
[1:03:59] ship soaked that thing to it made it
[1:04:01] just as tight as it could be and it kept
[1:04:03] out the
[1:04:04] Judgment hallelujah amen oh my the water
[1:04:10] was God's
[1:04:12] judgment right and the only thing that
[1:04:14] kept it out was the pitch that's right
[1:04:17] and the only way that we're going to
[1:04:19] escape the wrath and Damnation of God's
[1:04:22] judgment is to empty up ourselves and
[1:04:25] let the Holy Spirit chug us so
[1:04:28] fool of the baptism of the spirit and
[1:04:32] that day remember the very thing that
[1:04:35] they laughed at Noah making pouring
[1:04:38] pitch into it the very thing that they
[1:04:41] laughed that but the very thing that God
[1:04:43] led him to do they laughed at it and the
[1:04:46] very thing that spirit filled man and
[1:04:48] women are led to do today the world
[1:04:52] last C of nonsense but it was was the
[1:04:56] only thing Hallelujah that's right it
[1:04:59] was the only thingl that separated Noah
[1:05:03] from
[1:05:04] judgment the blood of Christ to the Holy
[1:05:07] Ghost is the only thing that will
[1:05:09] separate the church from the
[1:05:11] world denominations and barriers and so
[1:05:15] forth and education will never do it
[1:05:17] it'll take the baptism of the holy
[1:05:20] spirit in our heart has poured itself
[1:05:21] out before God and EMP us God has has
[1:05:25] filled up that person then they are led
[1:05:30] by the Holy Ghost amen I like that now
[1:05:35] he's made a preparation for us he beat
[1:05:39] the life out of Christ sin did it at the
[1:05:43] cross and that life that was beat out of
[1:05:45] a man that lived and eat like you and I
[1:05:47] do is poured into us when we're empted
[1:05:51] up and made life did you ever get down
[1:05:53] and pray until he come to a place do you
[1:05:55] felt like is walking on
[1:05:57] cloud hallu that's when you're getting
[1:06:01] light the Bible said in Hebrews the 11th
[1:06:04] chapter the 12th chapter seeing that we
[1:06:06] are Compass about such a great cloud of
[1:06:08] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:06:12] empty up Hallelujah and the sin that
[1:06:14] does so easily beset us that we might
[1:06:17] run with patience the race the set
[1:06:19] before us looking to the author and
[1:06:21] finisher of our faith the Lord Jesus
[1:06:24] think of it how God has made a way and
[1:06:28] beating from his body he was wounded for
[1:06:31] our transgression bruised for our
[1:06:33] iniquity look at the Life coming out of
[1:06:36] him you took the tree and laid it down
[1:06:38] and would beat it and when they beat it
[1:06:40] the r would fly out of it and they cut
[1:06:43] that same Ross and they come out of one
[1:06:45] tree and poured it into this one to make
[1:06:48] an atoma make a separation of something
[1:06:51] that would float and the only way that
[1:06:54] no knew to do it it could not be
[1:06:57] scientifically proved but Noah was led
[1:07:00] by God to do it that's the way men and
[1:07:02] women are today that's born again the
[1:07:04] spirit of God is led by the spirit of
[1:07:07] God to live like Christians and act like
[1:07:09] Christian and believe in the Full Gospel
[1:07:11] of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:13] Christ amen
[1:07:15] hallu it's a leading it's all nonsense
[1:07:19] to the
[1:07:20] unbeliever I can prove to you tonight by
[1:07:23] the Bible that the church of the Living
[1:07:26] God is built upon spiritual revealed
[1:07:30] truth when Cain and Abel was in the
[1:07:33] Garden of Eden to begin with it te was
[1:07:36] just as religious as Abel was but who
[1:07:38] told Abel to TU a lamb who told Cain and
[1:07:42] talk a ni something that catch the eye
[1:07:44] of God and Cain worshiped just the same
[1:07:47] as Abel worship Cain made an offering as
[1:07:49] same as Abel did came was just as
[1:07:52] sincere as Abel of so sincerely don't
[1:07:54] save you God has a way a
[1:07:58] program you got to walk into that and
[1:08:01] King come and worship if God only
[1:08:04] requires a man to join Church bow at the
[1:08:06] altar and worship God and give him his
[1:08:08] his tent to the church or or whatever it
[1:08:11] is and all the good deeds and things he
[1:08:13] could do would testify for him in glory
[1:08:17] then God would be unjust to condemn King
[1:08:20] but
[1:08:21] able not by works not by building some
[1:08:24] great organization but doing something
[1:08:26] else making great churches and flowerly
[1:08:28] alers and flowerly speeches but somehow
[1:08:31] he was led by the spirit of God and he
[1:08:35] goes over he gets a little lamb and
[1:08:37] wraps a piece of Great Vine around his
[1:08:39] neck and offered him on the Altar and
[1:08:42] died on the same altar his lamb died
[1:08:46] on that's a revelation every man that
[1:08:49] comes to God and free from the judgments
[1:08:52] has got to die on the same altar the
[1:08:54] lamb did empty up everything of self
[1:08:58] that God might pour in the Holy
[1:09:01] Spirit
[1:09:03] right notice Jesus come down off the
[1:09:06] mount one day this is over the New
[1:09:09] Testament coming down off of them m one
[1:09:12] day he saw some people and he was
[1:09:15] talking to them and he asked them he
[1:09:16] said who does man say I the son of man
[1:09:18] am some said you're Moses the Elias and
[1:09:21] the prophet and so forth he said but who
[1:09:24] do you say that I am yeah I don't care
[1:09:26] what someone else says what's your
[1:09:28] personal opinion of
[1:09:30] me Peter being led by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:35] not taking what somebody else
[1:09:38] said he said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:09:42] of the Living God listen at him he turns
[1:09:45] around and said blessed art thou Simon
[1:09:47] bar Jonah or by Jonah far flesh and
[1:09:51] blood has not revealed this to you you
[1:09:54] never learned this out of a book you
[1:09:56] never learned this out of a seminary you
[1:09:58] wasn't taught this in some church Papa
[1:10:01] and Mama never told you this some
[1:10:03] preacher didn't tell you this all is
[1:10:06] good as it may be but that's not it yet
[1:10:09] he said My Father which is in heaven has
[1:10:11] revealed this to
[1:10:13] you and you've been LED in other words
[1:10:16] so many words you've been led to make
[1:10:18] this confession and Upon This Rock I'll
[1:10:21] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:10:24] can't Prevail against it
[1:10:26] upon spiritual revealed truth how the
[1:10:29] Living
[1:10:30] God so if many Full Gospel Doctrine
[1:10:33] seems hard to you just get down and pray
[1:10:35] till the Holy Ghost gets in you lead you
[1:10:37] to the P I'm
[1:10:42] here if you just get down to the
[1:10:45] Fountain empty up so God can fill you up
[1:10:48] led by the spirit Sons and Daughters of
[1:10:51] God are led by the spirit of God Abraham
[1:10:56] the old patriarch 75 years old Sarah 65
[1:11:00] God met him one day down in the valley
[1:11:02] of the Shire there city of and he said
[1:11:05] Abraham I'm going to bless you and I'm
[1:11:08] going to give you a son B
[1:11:10] Sarah so out order to do this if you
[1:11:13] stay around all this unbelief around
[1:11:15] here you'll get the doub but I want you
[1:11:17] to separate
[1:11:19] yourself usually if a man's going to be
[1:11:21] a believer he's got to separate himself
[1:11:23] from his worly friend
[1:11:26] all the the people yoke yourself out up
[1:11:28] amongst unbelievers they'll only call
[1:11:30] you back into the world again
[1:11:33] environment has a lot to do with it do
[1:11:35] you know that your
[1:11:38] environment sure is is brother bar you
[1:11:41] say you put a hen egg under a puppy and
[1:11:43] time down it would hatch the eggs the
[1:11:45] puppy would hatch out the chicken man
[1:11:48] see it's because the puppy keeps the egg
[1:11:51] warm and it's the environment that
[1:11:54] counts and when you a Christian you
[1:11:56] associate with Christians and go with
[1:11:58] Christians and be a Christian you got to
[1:12:01] have the right kind of an environment
[1:12:03] around you you get out in the pool rooms
[1:12:06] and dance halls and shind digs and
[1:12:08] everything else and call yourself a
[1:12:09] Christian the first thing you know you
[1:12:11] will be believing it's all right to do
[1:12:14] it that's what's matter the Pentecostal
[1:12:17] Char that's what's matter all the
[1:12:19] Pentecostal women cutting their hair and
[1:12:21] putting makeup on and and man doing the
[1:12:24] way they're doing is because begin to
[1:12:25] associate you ought to bring yourselves
[1:12:28] together forsaking not to assemble
[1:12:30] yourselves together as you see the time
[1:12:32] coming and you lay down the
[1:12:35] bar that's the reason you don't hear the
[1:12:37] oldfashioned Backwoods hell bar Brin
[1:12:40] Stone preached anymore men are scared to
[1:12:43] preach it preachers are say scared to
[1:12:46] say so because their wives act the same
[1:12:48] way and they're afraid to say it here
[1:12:50] not long ago a certain man taking me out
[1:12:53] I had a man working for me driving a
[1:12:54] truck a man smoked a good man but he
[1:12:58] smoked he didn't profess to be a
[1:13:00] Christian but he's a good man I had him
[1:13:01] as a hand this man said we can't do this
[1:13:04] we're Full Gospel people that would
[1:13:06] absolutely upset our people to know that
[1:13:09] you had a man with you that smoked
[1:13:10] cigarett I said then I'll lay him off
[1:13:12] get somebody else said all right I said
[1:13:15] I tried two a three on it and you can't
[1:13:17] put no confidence when you're ready to
[1:13:18] go they've gone somewhere else and I
[1:13:20] said that's reason I put him on said
[1:13:22] well we are full gospel people it'll be
[1:13:24] a stumbling about before us this
[1:13:26] Minister said I said all right then I'll
[1:13:28] just tell a man the good way and lay him
[1:13:30] off I did the very next meeting we went
[1:13:33] to I went down to a big tent three four
[1:13:35] five times this size I guess field up
[1:13:37] full of people I walked up on the
[1:13:39] platform with this Minister and he said
[1:13:42] uh this is the state superintendent what
[1:13:44] it is General overseer of the certain
[1:13:46] big denominational church I said how do
[1:13:48] you do sir and I shook his hand he said
[1:13:51] Mr brandom I want you to meet my wife
[1:13:53] and there she stood there I never seen
[1:13:57] such a looking thing in my life she had
[1:14:00] her hair all cut real short on a boy Bob
[1:14:02] and curled up on the outside she had
[1:14:05] makeup so thick on her mouth and a dress
[1:14:07] that she could have poured in I never
[1:14:09] seen such an outfit in mine and there
[1:14:12] she was standing there and big long
[1:14:14] fingernails out like that looks like

[1:14:27] looks to me like she's a Han I said from
[1:14:29] the way she all that blue and stuff

[1:14:34] matter you got away from the old
[1:14:36] Landmark you got away from the Bible you
[1:14:40] got away from leading of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:42] and went out like the rest of them did
[1:14:44] that's exactly what's the matter
[1:14:46] Hallelujah are you think that preacher
[1:14:47] could have preached against it the other
[1:14:49] ministers with me not the one that told
[1:14:51] me this but the other man another man
[1:14:53] was with me which is his brother-in-law
[1:14:55] his wife jumped all over when we went up

[1:15:56] led by the Holy Spirit Sons and
[1:15:59] Daughters of God led by the spirit of
[1:16:01] God Abraham didn't care what anybody
[1:16:05] else said he said now you separate
[1:16:06] yourself so he got his little group
[1:16:08] together in his wife and went out not

[1:16:37] and how does a spirit of Supernatural
[1:16:39] being come and get into us well that's
[1:16:41] like the hot hop Down in Africa they
[1:16:44] call the word the Unseen the the Amaya

[1:16:49] is a force that you don't see they've

[1:17:00] led by The Same Spirit Hallelujah
[1:17:04] Abraham Moses Moses was a man of God led
[1:17:09] by the spirit of God oh he want to lead
[1:17:11] himself one time he got all the
[1:17:13] mathematics and militarism all in his
[1:17:15] mind he know what a great man he was so
[1:17:17] he thought he could go right out and do
[1:17:19] it himself but he found himself a
[1:17:21] failure every technique he started was
[1:17:23] wrong he slew a man that's the first
[1:17:26] thing the military treats you kill
[1:17:27] somebody teach it go kill somebody else
[1:17:30] all right that was his tactic so he went
[1:17:32] out on his military education and he
[1:17:34] slew a man and was a stranger among his
[1:17:37] brethren for 40 years but one
[1:17:41] day old sheep heard her walking around
[1:17:44] on the backside of the desert and the
[1:17:46] first thing you know he come into the
[1:17:48] presence of God and when he did the Holy
[1:17:51] Ghost got a fire in the bush there and
[1:17:54] he told Moses more about his leading and
[1:17:57] five minutes and all he had take the
[1:17:59] military out of him and put the real
[1:18:01] genuine Holy Spirit in him so he could
[1:18:04] be led by the spirit I want you to
[1:18:06] notice Moses was a coward with all his
[1:18:08] military training with all his theology
[1:18:11] with all of his understanding of the
[1:18:13] Bible his mother had taught him from a
[1:18:15] child how what was going to take place
[1:18:18] how he was to be the emancipator of that
[1:18:20] great nation Israel all these things she
[1:18:22] had taught him but yet in his own mind
[1:18:25] he was unable to accomplish the purpose
[1:18:28] and every man I don't care how much
[1:18:30] education you got how well you know the
[1:18:31] Bible how much theology you've learned
[1:18:34] you're unqualified till you receive the
[1:18:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost and be led by
[1:18:38] the spirit of
[1:18:42] God
[1:18:44] 120 I went up in the upper room these
[1:18:47] Apostles and and M mark 11:24 I believe
[1:18:52] it's Luke 24:49
[1:18:55] and Luke 24:49 Jesus told them Apostles
[1:18:58] after they had been with him and
[1:18:59] preached and everything he said but
[1:19:01] you're my Witnesses but first I want you
[1:19:04] to go to the city of Jerusalem and wait
[1:19:06] there until you're endued with power
[1:19:08] from on high right no matter they had
[1:19:11] been associat with him for three and a
[1:19:13] half years they' had seen his miracles
[1:19:15] they know what his teaching but they had
[1:19:17] to have the Holy Ghost to leave
[1:19:21] them our schools are fine but we need
[1:19:24] the whole Holy Ghost to lead him that's
[1:19:27] right now when Moses when you get the
[1:19:30] Holy Ghost to leading you the Holy Ghost
[1:19:32] will lead you into some of the most
[1:19:34] ridiculous things that the world ever
[1:19:35] looked at and make you do the most
[1:19:38] ridiculous things that the world ever
[1:19:39] thought about you're going to be counted
[1:19:42] a little bit off in the upper story just
[1:19:44] remember if they persecute the prophets
[1:19:46] wh before you they'll persecute you
[1:19:49] Jesus said blessed are you rejoice and
[1:19:51] be exceedingly glad for great is your
[1:19:54] reward in heaven that's right yeah
[1:19:56] notice hallelujah how
[1:19:59] wonderful
[1:20:01] persecuted how that he'll do it because
[1:20:04] of your peculiar action now let's take a
[1:20:07] minute here's a man that's got all the
[1:20:09] military training he's got all the
[1:20:11] Seminary uh theology in him he knows the
[1:20:15] Bible but he's a coward he's standing
[1:20:18] out on the backside of the desert scared
[1:20:20] to go down in Egypt scared of his own
[1:20:23] neck he's a afraid to go down even
[1:20:26] afraid to visit his loved ones and when
[1:20:28] God met him up there and he got a
[1:20:30] revelation from God when God began to
[1:20:32] lead him he done the most ridiculous
[1:20:34] thing that any man could do run over and
[1:20:37] kissed his father-in-law goodbye and set
[1:20:39] his wife a straddle of a mule with a
[1:20:41] young on each hip got an old crooked
[1:20:43] stick in his hand and started down the
[1:20:45] whiskers of BL leing a little old mule
[1:20:47] hallelujah we're going down to Egypt to
[1:20:49] take
[1:20:50] over if that wasn't a ridiculous looking
[1:20:52] sign going down there to m ions of
[1:20:55] trained men where you going Moses we're
[1:20:57] going to Egypt to take over how you know
[1:21:00] you are God's leading me something on
[1:21:02] the inside of me pushing
[1:21:04] me and a good thing he done it too he
[1:21:08] went out and Tuck over because he was
[1:21:09] led by the spirit of
[1:21:13] God you shouts you cry you jump up and
[1:21:16] down you don't know what takes place one
[1:21:19] time when I go hunting up in the
[1:21:21] mountain I usually go to a big old place
[1:21:23] there the best water I've ever drink
[1:21:25] just go there and lay down how I could
[1:21:27] drink it tonight and I lay down there
[1:21:30] and drink and that's the happiest stream
[1:21:31] of water I ever seen in my life it's
[1:21:33] bubble bubble bubble all the time well
[1:21:36] one time I sat down and talk to that
[1:21:38] street I said now what makes you so
[1:21:40] happy perhaps maybe deers drink from you
[1:21:43] nope that's not it maybe bears drink
[1:21:46] from you nope that's not it maybe you're
[1:21:48] happy because of what's making you
[1:21:50] bubble is because I drink from you you
[1:21:52] just keep bubbling all the time so I can
[1:21:54] drink from you no that's not it if he
[1:21:56] could talk you know what he tell me why
[1:21:58] he say it isn't me bubbling it's
[1:22:00] something behind me pushing me making me
[1:22:02] bubble and that's the way every man is
[1:22:04] formed of the spirit of God he don't go
[1:22:06] himself no more but there's something
[1:22:08] behind him when he's led by the Holy
[1:22:09] Ghost makes him do things that he
[1:22:11] thought he wouldn't
[1:22:14] do thought you a bubbling something in
[1:22:16] your
[1:22:17] bubbling it ain't you shouting something
[1:22:19] and you screaming ain't you crying and
[1:22:21] something got in your tear du hey

[1:22:27] it led by the spirit of God went down
[1:22:31] there with this wife on a mule and two
[1:22:34] little babies with a stick in his hand
[1:22:36] an old Dead stick in his hand hobbling

[1:24:31] somewhere the sun is shining against it
[1:24:33] and the sun will shine again on Earth

[1:24:37] time Holy Ghost meeting you don't have
[1:24:39] to be all the time down in the dumps but

[1:24:48] child of
[1:24:49] [Music]

[1:26:16] he
[1:26:21] said oh my

[1:27:20] right so he nodded over to his Deacon
[1:27:23] the Deacon went over over and told her
[1:27:24] said now Madam we like for you to come
[1:27:26] to church but you're interrupting the
[1:27:31] pastor if you don't keep still we'll
[1:27:33] have to lead you out

[1:27:38] because I just can't St
[1:27:40] still amen that's
[1:27:43] it and you're led by the spirit of God
[1:27:46] you goow up if you didn't say something
[1:27:49] amen led by the spirit of God now look
[1:27:53] she might have not had her name written
[1:27:55] in who's who but I imagine it was
[1:27:57] written on the Lamb's Book of Life I'd
[1:28:00] rather have it there anyhow she might
[1:28:02] not have M so much here on Earth but in
[1:28:04] heaven she was the
[1:28:06] same amen led by the spirit of God Moses
[1:28:10] went out into Egypt he delivered the
[1:28:12] children because he was led by the
[1:28:14] spirit of God all the things that they
[1:28:16] did in the Old Testament the Saints the
[1:28:19] prophets Elijah follow a great man
[1:28:22] Elijah was and how he went up there bled
[1:28:25] by the spirit of God and challenged they
[1:28:29] had to bring up all your priest down
[1:28:33] there and let's see who's
[1:28:35] God that's a way let's put it to The
[1:28:38] Showdown see who's God and they got all
[1:28:41] the priests out there they killed their
[1:28:43] sacrific and L themselves and jumped up
[1:28:46] on the altar screaming with all the
[1:28:48] sincerity in the world oh bam answer bam
[1:28:51] answer Elijah walked around said maybe
[1:28:53] he's gone aishan trip or something hard
[1:28:56] just a little
[1:28:57] louder you know he was no God in the
[1:28:59] beginning but then just about the time
[1:29:02] the evening sacrifices du Elijah killed
[1:29:05] the bulock and laid up on the altar
[1:29:07] walked out there led by the spirit of
[1:29:09] God and said God I've done all of this
[1:29:12] at your
[1:29:13] being
[1:29:15] amen I tell you devils are tremble and
[1:29:19] sinners awake when men and women submit
[1:29:21] themselves to God and are led by the
[1:29:23] holy
[1:29:24] go that's right amen what a difference
[1:29:28] it is that's
[1:29:29] right now so he made the offering and he
[1:29:33] said God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob hear
[1:29:36] me about that time the fire god be to
[1:29:39] fall because he was led by the spirit of
[1:29:42] God man and women that those that are
[1:29:45] are led by the spirit of
[1:29:48] God no condemnation to them they're in
[1:29:51] Christ walk not as the flesh
[1:29:54] but after the spirit look at little old
[1:29:58] Mary one day she was a little little old
[1:30:01] girl about 18 years old living down a
[1:30:04] real mean City but she was a virgin she
[1:30:07] lived right she did right acted right
[1:30:10] and God was looking all over the world
[1:30:12] to find a woman that he could put trust
[1:30:14] in and he found all the women setting up
[1:30:16] singing the great hymns up there at the
[1:30:18] church and their big plumes in their
[1:30:20] hats or whatever they wore in them days
[1:30:22] but a little old poor girl coming up
[1:30:24] from the well with a bucket of water
[1:30:26] sitting on her head Lord God said I'll
[1:30:29] just take
[1:30:30] her and the Lord spoke to her and told
[1:30:34] her what she was going to do she's going
[1:30:36] to have a baby knowing no man she said
[1:30:38] behold the hands made of a lord be it
[1:30:41] unto me according to your will other
[1:30:43] words
[1:30:44] what don't know Lord how you're going to
[1:30:46] do it I don't know M I don't know man
[1:30:50] after the nature of human life I don't
[1:30:52] know how you going to do it I couldn't
[1:30:54] prove it scientifically and I'm not
[1:30:56] going to the doctor to ask him anything
[1:30:57] about it I don't know how it's going to
[1:30:59] be done and I don't care what anybody
[1:31:02] else says about it if you said that it's
[1:31:05] so it's so and she tck God at his
[1:31:09] word and if you're going to be led by
[1:31:11] the spirit of God you can't P this Bible
[1:31:13] says days Amica pass no such thing as
[1:31:15] divine meing all these other things and
[1:31:17] then want by the spirit of God to be led
[1:31:20] by God's spirit will testify every word
[1:31:24] to be the
[1:31:25] TRU amen God will speak of his
[1:31:29] own yes sir so you know what she never
[1:31:33] wait just you felt L she never wait just
[1:31:35] she was positive she didn't wait any
[1:31:37] longer and no more than Angel told her
[1:31:39] she started rejoice and say I'm going to
[1:31:41] have a baby amen she took God every word
[1:31:44] she was led in the spirit of God she
[1:31:48] become the mother of the Lord Jesus
[1:31:50] Christ she took God a for little Martha
[1:31:55] she was a kind of gitary little
[1:31:57] child and so she always wanted to make
[1:32:01] the house look clean she had to clean up
[1:32:04] everything make everything so spotless
[1:32:05] while Mary listen to the words of
[1:32:09] life but I imagine Mara was Ling too
[1:32:12] because she proved it one day one day
[1:32:15] when her brother was dead had been dead
[1:32:18] four days thinking nose of done felly
[1:32:21] and skin worm crawling in and out of him
[1:32:24] him up in the grave she heard that Jesus
[1:32:27] was coming that's a good
[1:32:29] message she heard Jesus was coming and
[1:32:32] she know she ever get in contact with
[1:32:34] Jesus her worries would be over I think
[1:32:37] that's a good way to feel today and
[1:32:39] while she was thinking on those things
[1:32:41] the Holy Spirit got over her and led her
[1:32:44] right out to him she was led by the Holy
[1:32:47] Ghost and she said Lord if th would have
[1:32:50] been here my brother would not have died
[1:32:52] but even now whatever you ask God God
[1:32:54] will do
[1:32:55] it
[1:32:57] amen said thy brother shall rise again
[1:33:01] how could he say anything
[1:33:03] else said Do you believe I'm able to do
[1:33:06] this dear Lord I believe in my heart
[1:33:11] something tells me I'm LED of the spirit
[1:33:14] to say this Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:33:17] of the
[1:33:19] Liv that where have you bu come and see
[1:33:22] you you the grave weeping when he got
[1:33:25] out the grave he was always led by the
[1:33:28] spirit of God because God was in without
[1:33:30] me he was God was on the inside of him
[1:33:34] he said father I thank thee that thou
[1:33:36] hear me always but I say this I'm
[1:33:38] praying this prayer in other words so
[1:33:40] these are just an example of these who
[1:33:41] stand around so he said take away the
[1:33:44] stone they got away the stone he said
[1:33:46] Lazarus come forth and a man that was
[1:33:48] dead stood on his feet
[1:33:50] live amen
[1:33:54] a little old woman one time was led by
[1:33:56] the spirit of God she had a blood issue
[1:33:59] I can just look at her s up on the hill
[1:34:02] oh she spent all her money her husband
[1:34:04] probably was gone and she had some a
[1:34:07] farm she sold it pay off the doctor bill

[1:34:13] harness pay off the doctor bill all of
[1:34:15] her money had been spent and it wasn't
[1:34:18] nothing else left and she continually
[1:34:20] got worse many years she' had this Blood
[1:34:22] issue

[1:34:32] where Jesus is there's a lot of noise
[1:34:34] and it's
[1:34:35] commotion Str but it works that way and
[1:34:39] you know a lot of commotion that day

[1:35:12] can't
[1:35:13] come keep him there that's about the way
[1:35:16] teaching old theology that's just as
[1:35:18] dead as it can be back there and never

[1:35:45] be excommunicated right there that's
[1:35:47] going to S now there's one thing I got
[1:35:49] to do is listen what the doctor says
[1:35:51] what the pastor says cuz they both say
[1:35:53] he's a it and there's nothing to it the
[1:35:55] only thing he's doing is condemning
[1:35:57] other churches and things so I better
[1:35:59] not go down there and the Holy Spirit
[1:36:01] said my daughter if you want to get heal
[1:36:03] you better go so she listened to the
[1:36:07] Holy Spirit and was led out the Holy
[1:36:10] Spirit and she got down there where he
[1:36:12] was there's so many different bring
[1:36:14] Youngs and everything around him so he
[1:36:16] couldn't even she couldn't get near so
[1:36:19] you know what she did she sit down and
[1:36:20] crawl beneath her feet so she got over
[1:36:22] and touched the Garment for the Holy
[1:36:24] Spirit had told her she had Faith to
[1:36:26] believe and nothing can produce Faith
[1:36:28] but the Holy
[1:36:29] Ghost even Faith to be saved no man can
[1:36:32] come to me except my father draws me
[1:36:34] first and that is the Holy Ghost and no
[1:36:36] man can be saved without that Faith
[1:36:38] first acting in your sin acting in you
[1:36:41] and she had Faith the Holy Spirit Led
[1:36:43] her down there now when you get on there
