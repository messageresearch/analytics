[6:05] I love you, Lord, today

[7:06] [Music]
[7:08] God bless you all this evening. It's
[7:10] good to see everyone around the house of
[7:11] the Lord. Like to ask you if uh Brother
[7:13] Joe could come and just open the service
[7:15] with a word of prayer.
[7:26] God bless you saints. You ready to
[7:28] worship the Lord together tonight? Yes,
[7:30] a few of you are. That's good. And maybe
[7:31] a few more in a moment. We're missing
[7:34] some things tonight. Not only some
[7:35] people, but some windows. So, we're
[7:37] going to try something a little
[7:38] different. Just bear with us. If we have
[7:40] to use that for overflow during the
[7:42] meetings, would like to know if that'll
[7:44] work. So, if you need to go to the
[7:46] restroom and stuff, just be careful with
[7:48] the noise and the doors and all that.
[7:51] People travel a bit. We want to make
[7:52] them as comfortable as we can for the
[7:54] meetings. So, maybe that's a little bit
[7:56] better feel if we have to use that. So,
[7:59] we'll try it tonight and see how it
[8:00] goes. Maybe try it again. So, just bear
[8:03] with us. We'll still use those doors
[8:05] just for emergencies. If we can, we'll
[8:07] just try to minimize distractions. If
[8:09] you go to these other rooms, you're
[8:10] going to be seen. So, just uh be aware
[8:13] of that.
[8:15] And if you have some suggestions or
[8:18] ideas, these chairs are laid out for
[8:20] specific reasons to try to maximize
[8:22] efficiency. Different things are done.
[8:24] If you don't like it, that's okay. Be
[8:26] sure to tell Brother Israel. If you
[8:27] don't want to talk to anybody, you don't
[8:29] have to. Just put it in the comment box.
[8:31] So comments are there for us to help and
[8:33] and try to be a give suggestions and
[8:36] ideas and you can put um good comments
[8:38] in into right brother John about your
[8:40] favorite deacon named Joe and things
[8:43] like that. We know that would be brother
[8:44] Joe Galante. So just bear with us and
[8:47] we'll just try to make things good. All
[8:50] right. God bless you. Let's invite the
[8:51] master and welcome him. Lord, we're so
[8:53] thankful to be in church tonight. We're
[8:55] thankful for the rain. Lord, you've
[8:56] watered this parched desert tonight. And
[8:59] we just pray you'd water our parched
[9:01] lives, Lord, as we get dried up. May you
[9:04] just fill our cup to overflowing
[9:06] tonight. And
[9:08] expect to hear from heaven, Lord. First,
[9:10] we're going to praise your name, welcome
[9:11] you, welcome one another, and just honor
[9:13] you as the best we can. And we know the
[9:16] important part is the word, Lord. We
[9:17] expect to hear from heaven, Lord,
[9:19] through your prophet, through brother
[9:20] Israel. And just to prepare us for a a a
[9:24] resurrection and your soon coming, oh
[9:26] God, the signs of the times, just
[9:28] prophecy fulfilled each day before us.
[9:31] And we want to be ready. We want to be
[9:33] humble, Lord, to hear from heaven. And
[9:35] and then as we go to prayer, Lord, we're
[9:36] committing all things to you for your
[9:39] perfect will to be done in our lives. We
[9:41] thank you so much. We love you. We
[9:43] appreciate you. We appreciate each one,
[9:45] those missing among us. Lord, we pray
[9:47] you'd comfort them and be with them now
[9:49] as well. In Jesus wonderful name we
[9:51] pray. All God's people say, "Amen."
[9:55] Amen. Let's go to the key of G.

[15:54] Thank you, Lord.
[15:56] Let's go to the key of F.
[15:59] [Music]
[16:03] There
[16:05] is
[16:07] a river
[16:10] [Music]
[16:12] that flows
[16:15] from deep
[16:18] within.
[16:20] [Music]
[16:23] And there
[16:26] is
[16:28] a fountain
[16:33] that frees
[16:35] the soul
[16:38] from sin.
[16:44] Come
[16:46] to
[16:49] this water.
[16:54] There is
[16:57] a vast
[16:59] supply.
[17:05] There
[17:08] is
[17:10] a river
[17:14] that never
[17:17] [Music]
[17:18] shall
[17:20] run dry.
[17:25] And there was
[17:28] this thirsty
[17:31] woman
[17:33] [Music]
[17:35] who was drawning
[17:39] from
[17:41] a well.
[17:46] Her life
[17:49] was ruined
[17:52] and wasted.
[17:54] [Music]
[17:56] and her soul
[17:59] was bound
[18:02] for hell.
[18:07] But then
[18:10] she met
[18:12] the master
[18:18] who told
[18:20] her of
[18:23] her sin.
[18:27] He said, "If
[18:30] you drink
[18:33] this water,
[18:38] you'll never
[18:39] [Music]
[18:41] thirst
[18:44] again.
[18:47] And
[18:49] there
[18:51] is
[18:54] a river
[18:59] that flows
[19:01] from deep
[19:04] within.
[19:10] There
[19:12] is
[19:14] a fountain
[19:19] that frees
[19:22] the soul
[19:24] from sin.
[19:26] [Music]
[19:30] Come
[19:33] to
[19:35] this water.
[19:40] There is
[19:43] a vast
[19:45] supply of life.
[19:51] There
[19:53] [Music]
[19:54] is
[19:56] a river
[20:01] that never
[20:04] shall
[20:06] run dry.
[20:14] Let's go to the key of E flat.
[20:20] I exalt
[20:23] thee.
[20:27] I exalt
[20:31] thee.

[25:02] Oh
[25:04] Lord,
[25:09] Miriam Webster defines exalt as to raise
[25:13] in rank, power, or character, to elevate
[25:16] by praise or in estimation, to glorify,
[25:22] to enhance the activity of.
[25:26] And
[25:27] I want to be an exalter of him tonight.
[25:30] Maybe we could sing that one more time.

[25:36] congregation.

[25:43] thee.

[28:40] Lord, we ask your blessings on this
[28:42] portion of the service as we commit it
[28:45] into your hands, Lord. Father, forgive
[28:48] us of our shortcomings and our sins and
[28:52] as we worship you, Lord, in spirit.
[28:56] Now, send the truth of your word to us,
[28:58] Lord. Speak to our hearts, we pray. We
[29:02] love you, Father. We ask your blessings
[29:05] now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God
[29:09] bless each of you. So happy to be in the
[29:12] house of the Lord with you tonight.
[29:14] Amen. And we welcome you to the house of
[29:16] the Lord. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[29:19] Let's go to the scripture in the Old
[29:22] Testament, Genesis chapter 14.
[29:38] portion of scripture we've been through
[29:40] a little bit. Um, and we'll
[29:44] continue in that with Abraham going to
[29:47] deliver Lot.
[29:54] In verse number 11,
[29:57] and they took all the goods of Sodom and
[29:59] Gomorrah and all their vituals, and went
[30:01] their way, and they took Lot, Abraham's
[30:04] brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
[30:08] his goods, and departed. And there came
[30:11] one that had escaped, and told Abram,
[30:14] the Hebrew, for he dwelt in the plain of
[30:16] Mamm the Amorite, brother of Escall, and
[30:20] the brother of Amnner. These were
[30:22] confederate with Abram. When Abram heard
[30:26] that his brother was taken captive, he
[30:28] armed his trained servants born in his
[30:31] own house 318
[30:35] and pursued them unto Dan.
[30:39] Verse number one in chapter 15.
[30:45] After these things, the word of the Lord
[30:46] came unto Abraham in the vision. Abram
[30:49] in a vision, saying, "Fear not, Abram.
[30:52] I'm thy shield and thy exceedy great
[30:55] reward." And Abram said, "Lord God, what
[30:59] will thou give me? See, I go childless,
[31:03] and the steward of my house is this
[31:05] Eleazar of Damascus." Abraham said,
[31:09] "Behold, to me, thou has given no seed.
[31:12] And lo, one born in my house is mine
[31:16] heir."
[31:18] Amen. would just ask God's blessing on
[31:20] his word. You may be seated. And
[31:24] um brother Madam takes this story of
[31:28] Abram
[31:30] and Lot, him going to deliver him. And
[31:33] in the Hebrews message
[31:36] and a couple other messages, he's
[31:39] showing us that Abraham was a type of
[31:41] Christ. And not only a type of Christ,
[31:44] he was a type of the Christian.
[31:47] And as we went through on Sunday
[31:50] morning, what our mission is and Mark
[31:54] 16, Matthew chapter 16 lays out what
[31:58] that mission is. That is what each
[32:02] member of the church, that's what their
[32:06] goal should be. That's what it is. Go ye
[32:09] in all the world and preach the gospel
[32:11] to every creature. That's men, woman,
[32:14] boy, or girl. That's the church's
[32:17] commission. And I say not only is it the
[32:20] church's commission, it's the
[32:22] individual's commission because the
[32:24] individual is the church. And I'll say
[32:28] this that I know that because we're in
[32:32] uh the message that many times we'll
[32:34] lose sight of that portion of the
[32:38] mission to go preach the gospel to every
[32:41] creature. And um the church has been has
[32:46] fallen slack on that. I think the
[32:49] Mormons do a very good job of promoting
[32:52] what they what they believe. The Jehovah
[32:55] Witnesses do a very good job promoting
[32:57] what they do what they believe. and some
[33:00] of these great big min ministries,
[33:03] Christian churches that have these great
[33:05] big television programs, at least
[33:07] they're being made known to the world
[33:10] &gt;&gt; to get their mission across. And I'd say
[33:14] that um because we might fail in the
[33:18] mission, it doesn't mean we do it
[33:19] deliberately.
[33:21] I think that we might not be conscious
[33:24] really of what the mission is. I think
[33:27] sometimes Christians, we believers in
[33:29] the message, we'll get satisfied or
[33:31] we'll get settled in our way of doing
[33:34] things and we fail to go preach the
[33:38] gospel.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; And so after the message on Sunday, I
[33:42] had a conversation with two fine people
[33:46] um from from our church here. I think
[33:48] some of them are here tonight. And um
[33:52] you know there's a little question on
[33:55] how you would go about witnessing.
[33:58] How I would do it versus how you would
[34:01] maybe do it. Um but I think it all
[34:04] starts with prayer.
[34:06] The desire to go first. The mission is
[34:10] go preach the gospel to every creature.
[34:13] Once you have received the truth,
[34:16] brother Bannon says from that time on
[34:18] you are duty bound.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; And I read a very strong quote where he
[34:23] is repenting himself for being dilitary
[34:27] on the amount of souls that he won. He
[34:30] said I won one million soul souls. I
[34:32] should have won 10 million.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; How many remember that?
[34:35] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the attitude of a
[34:37] successful person. I think that they
[34:40] never quit. They never stop. Okay, I hit
[34:43] 300 free throws in a row. Let me get
[34:46] 301.
[34:49] And I think that's the goal. That's the
[34:50] attitude or should be the attitude of
[34:53] the believer. Now, that great commission
[34:56] is found in Matthew as we read it for
[34:59] you in Matthew chapter 16. And then the
[35:02] Bible talks about these signs shall
[35:04] follow them that believe in Mark chapter
[35:07] 16. also in Acts 1 and8 that the power
[35:11] is given to the church
[35:14] um after the Holy Ghost comes upon you.
[35:17] So you need the power in order to be a
[35:21] witness. So let's read that scripture
[35:22] just for a moment as we want to
[35:27] recommission some of you. All right,
[35:30] Acts chapter
[35:32] 1 verse number eight.
[35:36] This is the beginning. The acts are the
[35:38] acts of the apostles or as brother Vanna
[35:41] says the acts of the Holy Spirit in the
[35:44] apostles.
[35:46] But ye shall receive power after that
[35:49] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye
[35:53] shall be what?
[35:56] witnesses
[35:58] unto me both in Jerusalem, Judea, also
[36:01] and unto the uttermost parts of Tucson,
[36:06] Arizona.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Uttermost parts of the earth. So the
[36:10] power of the Holy Ghost comes upon the
[36:14] believer so that they can be a witness
[36:17] of Jesus Christ. That is what it's for.
[36:21] go preach the gospel to every creature.
[36:26] And that's a that's a mission. You're
[36:27] commissioned to do that. And I'm just
[36:30] encouraging myself, you, and one another
[36:33] to um to pick up that mission and that
[36:38] great those orders that were laid out
[36:41] for each believer, brothers, sisters,
[36:44] young people, whoever you are, you're
[36:47] part of this great mission. I think I
[36:49] read this on Sunday. If not, I'll read
[36:52] it again. It was the warning that
[36:56] Brother Brandham laid out to us about
[36:58] becoming a denomination and God's only
[37:01] provided place of worship. 1965,
[37:04] he says this in paragraph 148.
[37:07] Now, have you noticed every 3 years
[37:09] after a great meeting, what takes place?
[37:12] A denomination.
[37:14] This is 20 years in no denomination.
[37:18] Dear dying lamb, may it never do that.
[37:22] Did I read that on Sunday?
[37:25] &gt;&gt; I didn't. I had it here to read and I
[37:27] didn't. May it never do that. If I go in
[37:31] this generation, may the people who
[37:33] believe this message never stand still
[37:37] for a denomination.
[37:39] God will dot dot dot. You'll die right
[37:42] in your track. Remember that. the very
[37:46] hour that that
[37:50] the very hour that you mention
[37:52] denomination among you. I don't care how
[37:55] sincere you are. Take man for your
[37:58] leader instead of the Holy Spirit to
[38:01] confirm this word. That's the hour you
[38:05] die. The genuine seed cannot because
[38:08] there's nothing left after the seed.
[38:11] It's the same thing was back at the
[38:13] beginning. It's the bride that fell in
[38:16] the ground to bring forth the corn of
[38:17] wheat again. So that's strong.
[38:23] That is the truth. That's what um it
[38:26] still lays in and to every believer that
[38:32] is a part of this church. This great
[38:35] last day message that God sent to us and
[38:38] that we are supposed to be a witness of.
[38:40] Now, when
[38:42] when we think of witnessing, you know,
[38:44] there's a there's a little there's a
[38:47] struggle that comes with that. And I and
[38:48] I realize that and I realize that, you
[38:52] know, we kind of want,
[38:54] you know, a manual
[38:57] that someone can hand to us of the dos
[39:00] and don'ts when you're witnessing. But
[39:03] it just simply doesn't work that way.
[39:06] uh sons and daughters of God are led by
[39:08] the spirit of God and it is the spirit
[39:11] that made you a son of God and it is the
[39:15] spirit that comes upon the believer that
[39:18] allows him to be a witness. So you can't
[39:20] be a witness without the Holy Spirit.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; This is not mechanical. This is not
[39:25] okay, let's send so many charts or send
[39:28] me so many cards or send so many
[39:30] pamphlets through the neighborhood and
[39:32] let's just, you know, do some mechanical
[39:34] thing. No, you have to be led by the
[39:36] Holy Spirit. And if the Holy Spirit is
[39:38] leading you to send pamphlets, then send
[39:41] pamphlets.
[39:42] But not everybody's called to do it that
[39:44] way. If the Holy Spirit calls one to
[39:47] stand on the corner there and preach
[39:49] with a megaphone, then the Holy Spirit,
[39:52] that's what that man needs to do. And um
[39:57] but I I believe with all my heart that
[40:00] how to witness or to be an effective
[40:03] witness, you have to wrestle that out
[40:05] yourself.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; It's it's one of those things where
[40:09] every one of us have our own struggles
[40:12] and then like some struggles, I'll pray
[40:14] with you. I'll help you. You help me.
[40:15] You pray with me. But then there's some
[40:17] struggles where if if I help you get out
[40:21] of the eggshell and you're a little
[40:24] chicken, you need to struggle through
[40:26] that.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; You have to develop, you know, it says
[40:29] that that that chicken when he's pecking
[40:32] his way out, he's alive, of course, and
[40:34] then you're you're outside looking at
[40:36] him. You want to help him pull it off.
[40:38] Well, he he's developing his lungs. is
[40:42] developing his neck muscles. He's
[40:44] developing his bones in his little body
[40:48] through that struggle. It It has to be.
[40:51] And And you can peel the shell off and
[40:54] the bird will still live, but it won't
[40:58] it won't survive because it's not strong
[41:01] enough to survive.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; You say it's still alive. It's alive for
[41:04] a little while, but it's not going to
[41:05] survive because we've we've we've
[41:09] bypassed God's way of doing it. And I
[41:11] think that I believe with all of my
[41:13] heart that this mission, the great
[41:16] commission as brother Vanham calls it
[41:18] should be on the forefront of every
[41:20] believer's mind.
[41:23] Um sometimes we want to grow our church
[41:25] or we want the better church with
[41:27] whatever things that makes the church
[41:29] better, nicer choir, better preacher,
[41:33] better ministers, better dress crowd,
[41:35] better whatever. But our really our
[41:38] mission is to go preach the gospel.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; And remember brother Bham in that
[41:42] message he put the challenge. He put the
[41:44] squeeze. He said if you're not winning
[41:47] souls you're guilty. How many you
[41:50] remember that one?
[41:51] &gt;&gt; He said that and that's a challenge. He
[41:53] challenged himself. And so that
[41:56] challenge is put on us uh here as well
[42:00] and the and the greatest of all the
[42:01] ages. Now the prophet takes this example
[42:06] of Abraham. I want you to notice if you
[42:09] just go back to Genesis just for a
[42:11] moment that these four kings
[42:16] had these other five kings under their
[42:21] rulership and domain.
[42:24] Uh Lot which was the nephew of Abraham
[42:27] was in Sodom. And when
[42:31] Shaomar and Tidal and the different
[42:34] kings come together, they went on a
[42:37] campaign taking all these cities that
[42:41] had rebelled against them. They used to
[42:43] pay uh taxes to them. They pay tribute
[42:46] to them. They were their servants. And
[42:48] then they decided to rebel. Well, when
[42:50] they rebelled, they these kings went to
[42:52] go take care of their property that they
[42:56] believe belonged to them. And so they
[42:57] come through and they're just wiping out
[43:00] all of these kings and taking care of
[43:03] all of the property that belongs to
[43:05] them. Four kings against five. And the
[43:09] Bible says in verse 11, "And they took
[43:12] all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[43:14] all their vituals and went their way.
[43:17] They took Lot, Abraham's Abram's
[43:19] brother's son that dwelt in Sodom and
[43:21] his goods and departed.
[43:24] And there came one that had escaped and
[43:27] told Abram the Hebrew, for he dwelt in
[43:31] the plains there in Mammra. Verse 14.
[43:35] And when Abraham heard that his brother
[43:37] was taken captive, he armed his trained
[43:41] servants born in his own house 318
[43:46] and pursued them unto Dan. Now look at
[43:50] verse 13, though, right at the bottom
[43:53] there.
[43:54] It says, "He dwelt in the plain of Mamm
[43:57] the Amorite, brother of Eshko and
[43:59] brother of Abner." My Bible is faded out
[44:04] right there. Um,
[44:07] Amorite, Eshkaw, and the brother of
[44:09] Anor. And these were confederate with
[44:14] Abram. So, Abraham had help.
[44:17] He had the men that were trained in his
[44:19] own house. 316
[44:22] or 318.
[44:24] They were born in his own house.
[44:29] You know, I believe in all the quotes,
[44:30] don't you?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Starting with the ones in the Bible.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; These details are in there for a reason.
[44:41] These are Abraham's servants. They're
[44:43] trained in his own house. And then now
[44:47] he's going to get brothers to help him
[44:50] with this great task of going to get
[44:53] Lot.
[44:55] He divides himself against them. He and
[44:57] his servants by night, smokeote them and
[45:00] pursue them to Hoba, which is on the
[45:03] left hand of Damascus. I think the last
[45:06] time we shared with you the distance
[45:08] that was over 200 miles in that rugged
[45:12] terrain, one way that Abraham traveled
[45:16] to go and fight for his uh nephew Lot.
[45:21] And remember in verse 17, "And the king
[45:24] of Sodom went out to meet him after his
[45:26] return from the slaughter
[45:29] of these kings. And Melzdc the king of
[45:33] Salem brought forth bread and wine, and
[45:36] he was the priest of the most high God.
[45:38] And he blessed him and said, "Blessed be
[45:40] Abraham of the most high God, possessor
[45:43] of heaven and earth." And he blessed and
[45:47] blessed be the most high God, which hath
[45:50] delivered thy enemies into thy hand. And
[45:54] he gave him tithes of all. This is Abram
[45:58] giving this king of Melzdc 10% of all of
[46:03] the spoils. Now remember, Abraham and
[46:07] these three other gentlemen that were
[46:09] confederate with him actually defeated
[46:12] these four kings.
[46:15] And Abraham was not a warrior or a
[46:18] soldier. He was a farmer. But he you
[46:22] know this is the question. When when is
[46:25] it time for you to fight? You fight when
[46:28] people take your stuff.
[46:31] When people mess with things that belong
[46:33] to you, that's when it's appropriate for
[46:36] you to go fight. If you got to start it,
[46:40] if you got to pick it, if you got to do
[46:41] whatever you got to do, if it belongs to
[46:44] you, then that's what's worth fighting
[46:46] for. And this young man, Lot, his
[46:50] family, the people, and the Bible says
[46:53] goods, I'm going to give you brother
[46:55] Israel Po's version of what goods are. I
[46:58] call it stuff.
[47:01] You have it in your garage.
[47:04] You have it in your closets.
[47:07] I looked up the definition of home one
[47:09] time and it says a place where you put
[47:12] your stuff.
[47:14] That's home.
[47:16] You think your garage should have been
[47:18] made for a car, but many of our garages
[47:21] don't have cars in them, but we have
[47:23] stuff in them. And this is what the
[47:27] scriptures are very clear. when Abraham
[47:29] goes and delivers Lot, he delivers the
[47:32] king, he delivers the people and all of
[47:36] their stuff. And so here now, first time
[47:40] this king is being mentioned. You know,
[47:42] the Bible mentions five other kings with
[47:46] Sodom and and Gomorra and the other
[47:48] little and then mentions the four other
[47:50] kings that come and took them. And then
[47:52] all of a sudden, he mentions this king
[47:54] that we ain't hear about him no nowhere
[47:56] else. king of of of
[48:00] Salem,
[48:02] Melzdc, where'd he come from? And when
[48:05] Melzdc shows up, Abram takes all of the
[48:10] goods that they recovered from this
[48:14] great victory, this great battle,
[48:17] and pays tithe
[48:20] from what he received.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; And look at the king after him.
[48:26] I hope I can get into something here
[48:27] just for a moment and then I'll close.
[48:32] Verse 20. He blessed him most high God
[48:36] and he gave him tithes of all. Verse 21.
[48:38] And the king of Sodom said unto Abram,
[48:40] "Give me the persons and take the goods
[48:43] to thyself."
[48:46] It's a odd uh I mean he's not in a
[48:49] position to make no deal with nobody.
[48:52] we just delivered you. And here he's he
[48:56] he's watching Abra here. Abraham takes
[48:58] 10% of everything of all the goods and
[49:02] gives it to mec
[49:05] the priest of the most high God. And the
[49:07] the the priest of of of Salem offers him
[49:12] bread and wine. And then now the king of
[49:16] Sodom says, "Abram, you can have all
[49:19] this stuff. The rest of the stuff is
[49:21] yours. But I want these people. I want
[49:23] the persons.
[49:25] If you know what Sodom and Gomorrah was
[49:27] and what they turned out to be, you see
[49:30] what kind of persons these were.
[49:33] You keep reading the scriptures and you
[49:34] slow it down and you'll see what their
[49:37] future ended up becoming.
[49:40] They had an opportunity to come and be a
[49:42] part of what the most high God was
[49:46] offering Abram.
[49:49] Here he's getting a blessing from the
[49:51] most high God. And this man, this king
[49:54] is trying to offer him something carnal
[49:56] here. Look at the scripture here. And
[49:59] Abraham said to the king of Sodom, "I
[50:02] lift up my hand unto the Lord, the most
[50:06] high God, the possessor of heaven and
[50:09] earth, that I will not take from uh from
[50:13] a thread even to a shoe latch, and that
[50:16] I will not take anything that is thine,
[50:20] lest thou should say, I have made Abram
[50:24] rich." save only that which the young
[50:27] men of Eden and the portion of the men
[50:30] which went with me anorc
[50:34] and Mamra let them take their portion so
[50:38] here it's the time to get paid
[50:42] it's time for you know the reason why we
[50:45] were fighting and here Abraham has the
[50:48] opportunity to become more wealthy he
[50:52] has the opportunity to receive all of
[50:54] these gifts from all of the victories of
[50:57] these kings and uh they offer it to him.
[51:01] But Abraham said, "I swore before God
[51:05] that I wouldn't take nothing from you
[51:06] all." Abra, what are you fighting for?
[51:09] Why do we travel all these miles
[51:13] for? How valuable is Lot to you? I mean,
[51:18] financially, you put yourself on the
[51:20] line. You put your life on the line.
[51:23] You've traveled. You had to scheme at
[51:26] nighttime.
[51:28] You worked yourself through whatever you
[51:30] had to work through. And this wasn't a a
[51:32] practice round. This was a battle.
[51:37] And what is beating in Abraham's heart,
[51:39] he absolutely has the ministry and the
[51:43] mission and the the trained soldiers in
[51:47] his house behind him 100% to go get Lot.
[51:53] Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; If Abraham doesn't get Lot, who's going
[51:58] to get him? Huh?
[52:01] And who is Lot? And who is Abraham?
[52:04] Brother Bham brings the type so many
[52:06] times that that's what God did for us.
[52:10] He left glory to come and seek and save
[52:14] the lost. He left glory to find you and
[52:18] I. And he went further than just 200
[52:21] miles on foot. came from glory.
[52:25] For many of you, he came right in your
[52:27] neighborhood. He put a believer right on
[52:30] my job.
[52:32] Gave me a job that I had believers
[52:34] surrounded around me. And my highlight
[52:37] for my life isn't that job, but it was
[52:40] the believers that I met on that job.
[52:44] Amen. Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; So here what the prophet of God says
[52:48] here in Hebrews chapter 7 number one he
[52:51] says but still he was a fallen brother
[52:54] and Abraham done all that he could do to
[52:57] bring to bring him back again and the
[53:00] spirit was in Abram is the spirit of
[53:03] Christ that's in the church today. No
[53:06] matter what the brother has done, you'll
[53:10] do all you can to bring him back into
[53:14] the fellowship of Christ again. No
[53:16] matter what he's done, you'll try hard.
[53:19] You say, "Well, if the I ain't seen
[53:20] brother so and so. I ain't seen that
[53:22] brother. We baptized. I ain't seen that
[53:24] sister. We ain't seen them in a long
[53:25] time. You know, if they're they know
[53:27] where we're at. Uh they know where the
[53:29] church is. They know how to call me if
[53:31] they need something." That was that's
[53:32] not what Abraham they they they can't
[53:35] call you when they're bound.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; They can't come see you when the spirit
[53:42] has them bound.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; But you got the power of Christ to go
[53:47] see them.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Arm your trained soldiers, servants. Do
[53:53] everything you can. If you got to be
[53:54] confederate with these two or three
[53:56] other guys just to go win this battle to
[53:59] go get locked, it's worth it.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; This is the attitude.
[54:04] And and we've been guilty not purposely
[54:07] but out of Leo Deia's busyiness.
[54:12] It's like it's like you know you can
[54:15] keep you know one of the famous brothers
[54:17] that witness all the time just a
[54:19] highlight like a hero to me was brother
[54:21] Tommy Flanigan. How many knew him?
[54:26] This man was a witnessing machine.
[54:30] That's what his life. He kept a message
[54:32] book right here. He kept a pamphlet over
[54:34] here. Had a couple tapes in his pocket
[54:35] right here. How many knew Brother
[54:36] Flanigan?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my. How many didn't know him?
[54:41] Oh my goodness. This brother was set at
[54:43] the truck stop and I asked him one time.
[54:45] He says, "Brother Flanigan, how do you?"
[54:46] He says, "I kind of sit down."
[54:49] You know, he kind of has an odd way
[54:51] about him, but not like he's going to
[54:52] hurt you, but like and he would just
[54:55] come and sit up at somebody's table at
[54:58] the truck stop while they're resting or
[55:00] eating. And here this no-haired man
[55:03] comes slipping up. Hey, can you can I
[55:06] sit and talk to you about spiritual
[55:07] things? That's what he would say. Can I
[55:09] talk to you about spiritual things? And
[55:11] he have a book loaded
[55:14] dynamite in his pocket. His truck
[55:16] drivers didn't know what's about to hit
[55:18] him. He looks innocent. He looks like a
[55:21] nobody. But I believe who did brother
[55:23] Philan witness to bring in? I think he
[55:26] brought in
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe. But he brought in um
[55:34] I thought it was brother Maranda.
[55:37] Somebody checked me on that. But
[55:38] anyways, he told me he said he could
[55:41] tell real quick if if they're really
[55:44] resistant right away. He knew he stepped
[55:46] back. But you can tell when people
[55:48] receiving and some people were just
[55:49] curious. He's like, "Sure, sit down."
[55:51] And he'll start opening up and he'll
[55:53] keep going and keep going until they
[55:56] said stop. And then he'll back up. And
[55:57] he dropped so many tapes and CDs in
[56:02] these truckers lap and they would get in
[56:04] that truck and then the bomb would go
[56:07] off.
[56:10] He had a plan. He had a strategy.
[56:13] He witnessed to more people than
[56:15] probably most of the pastors that I
[56:17] would know. He was a witnessing machine.
[56:22] He had a style. He had he was he
[56:24] developed it. He made copies. He made
[56:27] copies of the message so he can give it
[56:29] to somebody.
[56:33] That's the spirit of Christ, I believe.
[56:36] And that's the spirit that we want on
[56:39] us. Abraham C. In 1959, Brother Banner
[56:42] says this, paragraph 116. Then we find
[56:45] out that trouble set in down in Sodom.
[56:47] Kings come through and took Lot, run
[56:50] away with him and his wives, and Abraham
[56:52] heard it. Now Abraham played the part of
[56:57] a Christian again.
[56:59] Oh, Christ going after the fallen
[57:02] brother to bring him back. Christ went
[57:05] after the fallen brother to bring him
[57:09] back.
[57:11] 1956 the lamb was alive. Brother Random
[57:14] says this here. What good would the
[57:16] million dollars do or all the feeding of
[57:19] the poor and the things that we done?
[57:22] See, it wouldn't amount to very much if
[57:25] I had a billion this morning. What good
[57:28] would it do us after we're gone? But let
[57:32] me tell you something. We haven't got
[57:33] that money. You're a poor man. All of us
[57:37] are. That's right. We live by the arms
[57:40] of the people being ministers. But
[57:42] brethren, in Africa, one little black
[57:44] boy about this high or prostitute off
[57:47] the street yonder in Lewisville, one
[57:50] soul saved in eternity. When that star
[57:55] is shining yonder, our name will be
[57:58] wrapped into it.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; There's your value. It isn't how much
[58:03] you got, how much you desire. It's how
[58:06] much you can do towards saving souls for
[58:11] Christ Jesus. Our money will fade. He
[58:14] says,
[58:16] we can say, "Praise the Lord."
[58:19] Ah, so brother Bannam is talking about
[58:24] Hudson Taylor and presuming and he makes
[58:27] this statement here,
[58:30] paragraph 124. I tell you again, instead
[58:32] of preaching,
[58:34] taking so many our students over here
[58:36] and getting them crammed so full of
[58:37] theology and things like that, I think
[58:39] it'd be better to take them in an upper
[58:42] room like they used to have a long time
[58:44] ago for an experience.
[58:47] Hudson Taylor said one time, the great
[58:49] missionary to India, a young Indian boy
[58:52] got converted. He was filled with the
[58:54] Holy Spirit. He said his face was
[58:56] shining like a light. He come in, he
[58:58] said, "Mr. Taylor, now I believe I'll go
[59:00] to school and take my four years that I
[59:02] missed in college. He says, "Then I
[59:05] think I'll then I think I'll go into
[59:08] study and get my bachelor of art. Within
[59:10] a few years, I'll be able to go out and
[59:12] preach the gospel." Mr. Taylor, the
[59:15] renowned Christian that he was, he said,
[59:17] "Son, go with what you got." Now, that's
[59:21] it. said, "Start giving light when the
[59:25] candle is lit, not when it's half gone."
[59:29] That's right. Tell you what you know,
[59:32] you you ain't got no experience, you
[59:34] can't tell nothing. Tell what you know.
[59:38] You ain't got no experience, you can't
[59:40] tell nothing. Amen. So, you know, I
[59:45] think that's the attitude. Sometimes we
[59:46] think, am I more am I well equipped to
[59:49] be a witness? Well, you tell your
[59:51] testimony.
[59:52] You tell how the candle got lit for you.
[59:55] You be a witness of you. What the word
[1:00:01] did for you. You be a witness. Young
[1:00:03] person, old person, whoever it is, you
[1:00:07] go tell how the candle got lit
[1:00:08] sometimes. And we should study the word
[1:00:11] to make oursel approve. We should be
[1:00:13] studying all the time anyways. Um, and
[1:00:16] to be a witness, you simply tell how the
[1:00:19] candle got lit. You give your
[1:00:20] experience. what you know, what God did
[1:00:23] for you, what you know is true. If it
[1:00:26] goes too deep, it goes a little further,
[1:00:27] then you can refer them to a minister,
[1:00:30] invite them to the church, or refer them
[1:00:32] to someone that has um more of those
[1:00:36] skills of of explaining and and and and
[1:00:40] those things like that. But you know, we
[1:00:42] are all supposed to be witnesses
[1:00:45] and we're all supposed to be ready,
[1:00:47] willing, and and on the ready to preach
[1:00:51] the gospel. Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the focus that Brother Bam
[1:01:00] told us that we need to put souls first.
[1:01:05] Winning souls that should be first.
[1:01:09] God keeps his word 1957. I pray tonight
[1:01:13] as I've laid back these pages of this
[1:01:15] sacred book called the Bible. I'm only
[1:01:17] able to physically to open it up, but
[1:01:20] only the Holy Spirit can interpret it to
[1:01:22] us. So we pray that he will come tonight
[1:01:24] and interpret the word and the meanings
[1:01:26] that would create faith for the
[1:01:29] salvation of souls first for the healing
[1:01:33] of bodies next and for the bringing of
[1:01:35] joy to the saints and establishing them
[1:01:38] that they might continue on. Grant these
[1:01:41] blessings, Father, the forgiveness of
[1:01:43] our sins. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:01:47] The message speaks to this mountain. The
[1:01:49] prophet of God says this. Now, we're
[1:01:52] trying to place the revival just in the
[1:01:54] best setting that we can. We do not what
[1:01:57] we call major on divine healing because
[1:02:00] divine healing is a minor and you cannot
[1:02:02] major on a minor. We know that. So, the
[1:02:05] great thing that we're after for any
[1:02:08] revival is to bring lost souls to Christ
[1:02:12] first. Revive the church back into a
[1:02:15] spiritual condition to where it should
[1:02:17] be. Close communion with God. Bring
[1:02:20] fellowship among the churches. Third and
[1:02:22] fourth, pray for the sick. That's our
[1:02:25] aim. Our try is sinners first.
[1:02:30] Fellowship with the churches and close
[1:02:32] walk with the with with the church of
[1:02:34] God and then pray for the sick.
[1:02:39] 1962, brother Brandham says that's our
[1:02:41] first intention is to win souls.
[1:02:46] Secondly, the upbuilding of God's
[1:02:48] people, the church. Thirdly, pray for
[1:02:51] the sick and to do something that lays
[1:02:53] in our power to help make life a little
[1:02:56] better for you and the journey a little
[1:02:59] the burdens of a a little lighter. In
[1:03:02] the message influence 1963, the prophet
[1:03:05] of God says this.
[1:03:10] First thing let me say first there will
[1:03:13] be souls saved and believers filled with
[1:03:15] the Holy Spirit the sick people healed.
[1:03:17] God receive glory in his church grow for
[1:03:21] the kingdom of God. So
[1:03:24] that's what our desire is right
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; souls
[1:03:29] first and we do that by winning them.
[1:03:36] Look at this message divine love 1956.
[1:03:40] The prophet of God says this in
[1:03:42] paragraph 58. We know this is the age
[1:03:45] that lacks love.
[1:03:47] It has grown cold even amongst the
[1:03:50] church, even amongst believers.
[1:03:55] You know, in some counties, in certain
[1:03:58] regions of the US, you have that h
[1:04:00] southern hospitality, that warmness that
[1:04:03] people there have this warmness way
[1:04:06] about. You see that in the south been I
[1:04:08] know in Colombia there's a different
[1:04:10] atmosphere amongst the people than let's
[1:04:12] say the people in Mexico both very nice
[1:04:15] and then in Africa and West Africa
[1:04:17] Tanzania those people are quite
[1:04:20] different than the Liberians which is on
[1:04:23] that's west Africa this is east Africa
[1:04:26] they're just different and they're
[1:04:27] believers and every region and the and
[1:04:30] the places you live you go to different
[1:04:33] places they have a different atmosphere
[1:04:35] some people are moving fast and others
[1:04:37] moving slow kind of easy, you know, and
[1:04:40] in the city of Tucson where we live. I
[1:04:43] mean, you all live here. It's it's not I
[1:04:46] mean, it's very hot um outside
[1:04:50] and warm most of the time, but a lot of
[1:04:53] the people are not very warm here. Very
[1:04:56] standoffish, very curious, very
[1:04:59] cactuslike.
[1:05:02] And um when when you come here, you
[1:05:06] start to develop that. You used to I
[1:05:08] mean I used to say hi to people. You
[1:05:10] make eye contact. You at least say hi.
[1:05:12] And I we do that. We do that in other
[1:05:14] places. I come here and after a while
[1:05:16] people don't do it then so I don't do
[1:05:18] it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You develop this little coldness. You're
[1:05:23] not mean, you're not bad, but that's
[1:05:25] just the atmosphere of our city. And um
[1:05:30] but there's an atmosphere of this
[1:05:32] message though,
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; And there's an atmosphere of the Bible.
[1:05:38] And which atmosphere am I supposed to be
[1:05:41] reflecting?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I mean, like, if I really care and you
[1:05:47] come up missing,
[1:05:50] wouldn't I make a phone call to see how
[1:05:51] you're doing?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't even enter into my prayer, into
[1:05:56] my thought.
[1:05:58] But here it's so standoffish. I'm
[1:06:00] talking about me. I'm talking about us
[1:06:01] now. It's so cold. It's so standoffish
[1:06:04] that the people will be gone and just
[1:06:07] wherever you and nobody makes a phone
[1:06:10] call to see how they're doing.
[1:06:13] Very independent. Very give me my space.
[1:06:17] Call me before you come.
[1:06:23] Nobody say amen.
[1:06:27] very that's the atmosphere. I'm not
[1:06:29] indicting it. I do want you to call me
[1:06:32] before you come. Me personally,
[1:06:36] but but if you don't call, hey, I'm
[1:06:38] happy to see you.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Some of you know that you can come
[1:06:43] without calling, right?
[1:06:46] Hope so.
[1:06:48] Anyways, that atmosphere and that, you
[1:06:51] know, that's that's that's the region
[1:06:52] where we live. It's kind of that, you
[1:06:54] know, that the men here is that
[1:06:57] four-wheel drive atmosphere.
[1:07:01] I will run you over
[1:07:04] if I have to.
[1:07:08] I mean, but oneonone in the boat fishing
[1:07:10] at the lake and you see them, they chop
[1:07:12] it up. Be nice. You're just a regular
[1:07:14] guys. But in traffic, in the street, we
[1:07:17] got to have this macho. This don't say
[1:07:19] nothing to me. No, it ain't nothing
[1:07:21] funny. what you looking at
[1:07:23] that atmosphere.
[1:07:25] But what I'm saying is the message has
[1:07:27] an atmosphere and the Bible has an
[1:07:30] atmosphere and the Christians have
[1:07:33] Abraham's atmosphere. What did Abraham
[1:07:37] do?
[1:07:38] Abraham
[1:07:40] heard that Lot was taken
[1:07:45] by men that were greater than him. And
[1:07:48] what did he do? He armed his trained
[1:07:50] servants in his house and then he went
[1:07:52] the extra mile to get confederates to
[1:07:56] work with him and he's doing all this
[1:07:59] and he makes a covenant before God we
[1:08:02] didn't know about until the end when
[1:08:04] they try to offer him the money says
[1:08:06] I've lifted up my hand towards God
[1:08:10] towards heaven that I wouldn't take none
[1:08:12] of this stuff
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Abraham was already blessed
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; and here he says now in Genesis 15:1
[1:08:24] he's worried about
[1:08:26] this master to his house. Who is this
[1:08:27] master to his house? Who was he? He's
[1:08:31] Eleazar.
[1:08:33] Is that right?
[1:08:36] Now, Eleazar was a type of our last day
[1:08:39] messenger.
[1:08:41] And in Genesis chapter 24 is where we
[1:08:46] see him again. He is Abraham's eldest
[1:08:50] servant.
[1:08:51] Remember Genesis 15. We can presume or
[1:08:55] we can say and we should believe that uh
[1:09:00] his servant uh Eleazar was probably a
[1:09:04] part of the group that went to deliver
[1:09:06] Lot or he stayed back to take care of
[1:09:09] things. We do know he was in Abraham's
[1:09:11] house.
[1:09:13] We do know that he was under that
[1:09:16] ministry. And we do know that the type
[1:09:18] of Abraham was God. But here is these
[1:09:23] trained servants that are going out to
[1:09:26] deliver Lot. But now the ministry moves
[1:09:29] from Abraham sending Eleer
[1:09:34] to go get a bride.
[1:09:36] So it's beautiful. I don't have time to
[1:09:39] get into it, but let's look at it.
[1:09:41] Here's two arms of people that need to
[1:09:44] hear the word, and they all come from
[1:09:46] Abraham's house. Abraham dealing with
[1:09:51] Lot, his nephew, and then Abraham
[1:09:56] sending a messenger for his son. So
[1:10:00] here's the ministry of the bride coming
[1:10:02] into play and the ministry of the
[1:10:05] sodomite
[1:10:07] being saved, the Lites.
[1:10:11] And Abraham is a part of all of it.
[1:10:14] Abraham was instrumental of bringing Lot
[1:10:18] salvation. And just because um they're
[1:10:21] not going to marry Isaac,
[1:10:24] just because it's not a part of the
[1:10:26] message or part of the bride, doesn't
[1:10:28] mean we don't take people as far as we
[1:10:30] can take them through salvation.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Why have we lost? We have the eleer part
[1:10:35] down. We we preach the message. That's
[1:10:37] where we stand. You lead somebody to
[1:10:39] Christ, you got to take them somewhere
[1:10:40] in the word. And God took us in the word
[1:10:43] to this message. So that's what we do.
[1:10:45] But we bring them to Christ. said, "How
[1:10:48] far can we take Lot?"
[1:10:51] Lot never left Sodom.
[1:10:53] In fact, they backslid. It got worse and
[1:10:56] worse, and God had to rain fire down
[1:10:58] upon all of them and destroy them. But
[1:11:00] he delivered just Lot. And even still,
[1:11:05] even after all of the, you know, the the
[1:11:07] lives on the line, the the outreach and
[1:11:10] the campaign to go get him, he stays
[1:11:12] down in Sodom. It gets worse and God's
[1:11:15] going to destroy it. Then Abraham goes
[1:11:17] to interceding for him. Still,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:11:22] that's a Christian. Now,
[1:11:25] that's a type of a true Christian.
[1:11:29] That's a church believer that has the
[1:11:32] mission.
[1:11:33] Go
[1:11:35] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[1:11:40] How far did Elzer travel? 400 plus
[1:11:44] miles. one way from where he was to get
[1:11:48] Rebecca. So, I don't have time to get
[1:11:50] into that, but I do want to read this
[1:11:51] quote about winning souls. All right.
[1:11:54] Here, brother Brandham says this here,
[1:11:57] paragraph 58.
[1:11:59] What is it? Divine love, sympathy had
[1:12:02] been projected by the Holy Spirit into
[1:12:05] this man. And by that, at the end of the
[1:12:08] road where he couldn't, nothing could be
[1:12:10] done. Love had taken its place. and love
[1:12:14] had met love. Then sovereign grace went
[1:12:16] to work and God through sovereign grace
[1:12:20] restored the sight to the man. See,
[1:12:23] first you have to enter into that
[1:12:26] thought. That's the way you have to do
[1:12:28] to a sinner.
[1:12:31] Many people pray for sinners. That's all
[1:12:34] right. But that's not the way to win a
[1:12:37] sinner. It's your business to win the
[1:12:40] sinner. You don't win him by praying for
[1:12:43] him. You win him. Win him by talking to
[1:12:48] him and introducing to him Christ.
[1:12:52] That's your business. That's your duty
[1:12:56] is to win sinners by talking to them and
[1:13:00] projecting to them the love of God
[1:13:03] through the word of God. That wins the
[1:13:07] sinner. Someone say, "I wouldn't go to
[1:13:09] church. I sure like that woman. I like
[1:13:11] that fellow. See, because you are
[1:13:14] winning them. If you stayed home and
[1:13:17] just prayed for the sinner and never
[1:13:19] went to contact him, there is very
[1:13:22] little can be done. But you've got to
[1:13:25] pray and then go. That's right. Go and
[1:13:30] do it. Now, the projecting of this love.
[1:13:34] So, it's our duty to win the sinner. How
[1:13:36] do we do it? We pray. Then we go and
[1:13:40] that's one of the main things we do is
[1:13:42] we win the center. We've done the
[1:13:44] praying from the distance long enough.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; But we need to go pray and then go. We
[1:13:52] have cards for our church. Got a little
[1:13:54] card that we made for the churches out
[1:13:56] there. You grab those. Taking a flight
[1:13:59] on the bus, whatever you're doing, you
[1:14:01] keep that. The door opens. It's not It's
[1:14:04] not mechanical. It's praying for them.
[1:14:06] First, there has to be a love and burden
[1:14:07] for the lost. Keeping in mind the great
[1:14:10] commission. I am called to preach the
[1:14:12] gospel to every creature. I am called to
[1:14:15] preach the gospel to I am called to go
[1:14:18] and tell somebody else. That's my
[1:14:20] calling. And
[1:14:23] God has little tools, little ways that
[1:14:26] he can develop that for you. I encourage
[1:14:28] you to go tell somebody. Amen.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:14:36] So, we don't just pray for them. We pray
[1:14:38] and then we go. That's what Abraham did.
[1:14:43] Hey, we heard Lot was taken. Yeah, let's
[1:14:46] pray for that man. Oh my. I sure hope
[1:14:49] they're easy on him,
[1:14:52] man. No, no, no. He grabbed he grabbed
[1:14:54] his, you know. Come on, guys. You got to
[1:14:56] go do this. Hey, what's the goal here?
[1:14:57] We're going to go get Lot. And what's in
[1:14:59] it for us? Yeah, that's it. We're going
[1:15:01] to go get Lot.
[1:15:05] And when the spoils came out and all the
[1:15:07] spoils and everybody's getting their
[1:15:09] peace and before Abraham even separates
[1:15:12] and give the men who helped him, he
[1:15:14] gives God first. He takes a tenth from
[1:15:17] all of this stuff here that we got
[1:15:19] because I already lifted up my hand and
[1:15:21] he already blessed me. But all this I'm
[1:15:24] going to give it to He gives it to
[1:15:25] Melzdc and the Lord blesses him and
[1:15:30] serves him bread and wine showing a type
[1:15:34] that that is us the the the Christian
[1:15:37] today that in the new home in the
[1:15:40] millennium he we will eat bread and wine
[1:15:43] with him again. And right now we are
[1:15:44] winning lot. Amen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; That's what we're doing. It's right here
[1:15:49] in this city right here. Brothers, I
[1:15:51] want to go in the mission field. We're
[1:15:53] living in the missionary field right
[1:15:55] here, right now.
[1:15:57] Let me read one more. All right. I just
[1:16:00] on my mind. I think it's in my phone.
[1:16:03] But talking about this struggle just a
[1:16:05] little bit.
[1:16:07] I just came across this quote. And here,
[1:16:08] Brother Brandham was
[1:16:12] struggling with the gift of God in his
[1:16:15] life.
[1:16:17] He had the angel of the Lord
[1:16:19] in his life
[1:16:22] and um he was really dealing with him.
[1:16:26] It's in the angel and the commission
[1:16:28] 1950
[1:16:29] and I thought about you know some of the
[1:16:31] difficulties that that we have to
[1:16:34] wrestle with. We just had to wrestle
[1:16:35] through it and get through it ourselves.
[1:16:37] And I took my Bible, little old school
[1:16:40] Bible about like that, and I put it
[1:16:41] under my arms and I took off and I went
[1:16:44] and read until nighttime. I got a cave I
[1:16:47] go into and it'll be way back in the
[1:16:50] hills. But this is a little old log
[1:16:52] cabin where I used to trap. And I prayed
[1:16:55] and I prayed. And I was sitting there
[1:16:58] praying, holding my mind with the power
[1:17:01] that reaches the spheres on in beyond
[1:17:05] the moon and stars and the fogs and gets
[1:17:09] a hold of God way in yonder somewhere
[1:17:12] sitting there meditating, thinking on
[1:17:16] God. I was getting along towards 3:00 in
[1:17:19] the morning. I said, "God, I'll stay
[1:17:21] right here until I die. Until something,
[1:17:24] I'm a minister and don't let me be
[1:17:27] deceiving. If you want something from me
[1:17:30] to do, if there's something you wish to
[1:17:32] speak to me, you showed me signs and
[1:17:35] wonders and people have told me to
[1:17:37] forget about it and I was eat too much
[1:17:40] supper or something like that." I said,
[1:17:42] "But I want you to tell me, Father, if
[1:17:44] it's wrong, come down now and stop it
[1:17:47] from me. Shut it off." So, I'll never
[1:17:50] know no more about it. I said, "Have
[1:17:52] mercy, God." I cried till my eyes was
[1:17:55] swollen. I said, "God, I'm sincere. I
[1:17:58] don't know what to do. I don't want to
[1:18:00] fail you. I've done all that I know how
[1:18:02] to do, but what is it you want me to
[1:18:05] do?" And in there in prayer, all at
[1:18:08] once, I seen a light flickering and look
[1:18:11] around. I thought, "Well, here
[1:18:13] somebody's coming with the flashlight.
[1:18:15] Couldn't be a car coming back in here."
[1:18:18] Now, where was that at? So, you can go
[1:18:23] and here that's when the angel appeared
[1:18:25] to him. But just leading up to that, you
[1:18:27] think this great momentous event needed
[1:18:30] to happen in his life. But look at the
[1:18:32] sweat. Look at the crying till his eyes
[1:18:34] were shut. He holding his Bible 3:00 in
[1:18:38] the morning. Oh, God. What is this? And
[1:18:40] he's really pressing into it.
[1:18:43] And anything of value like that, you
[1:18:46] know, lot what Abraham did was of
[1:18:49] tremendous value. You have to press
[1:18:53] into it. The kingdom of God suffering
[1:18:56] violence and the violent take it by
[1:18:58] force. And that's the part that
[1:19:00] sometimes I think that's what we need
[1:19:02] the Lord to help us with the struggle to
[1:19:05] to to press into the kingdom.
[1:19:09] And that's what I'm asking the Lord to
[1:19:12] help me
[1:19:13] Amen. To help us. All right. So, God
[1:19:16] bless you.
[1:19:19] We have some prayer requests. I'm sorry
[1:19:21] I left him back there again, Joe.
[1:19:26] For
[1:19:27] And I know we want to pray for this man
[1:19:31] that was shot, this um
[1:19:34] Charlie. Yeah. And there's others that
[1:19:36] get shot. I don't like to I'm not into
[1:19:39] political stuff and I don't follow the
[1:19:41] waves of people that get in and
[1:19:43] announcing the stuff current events of
[1:19:46] the day. I don't do that. I keep the
[1:19:48] pullpit free from that. And um
[1:19:53] there's
[1:19:54] many people get shot and killed and we
[1:19:59] want to pray for every single one of
[1:20:02] them.
[1:20:04] And um because this is what happens. You
[1:20:07] get these little political waves that
[1:20:08] come through and they're on the radio
[1:20:11] and what people consume and if we're not
[1:20:14] careful, we bring that into our church
[1:20:15] and our sermons and so forth. And I
[1:20:18] don't I don't like I don't do that. I
[1:20:20] try to stay right with the word here.
[1:20:22] There's a lot of craziness going out
[1:20:24] there. What it's going to get crazier.
[1:20:28] So, uh we'll pray for that Charlie Kirk
[1:20:32] family and Someone put that request in.
[1:20:34] Brother Bobby WZ, want to pray for him.
[1:20:37] Um, Ruth Dexter, wife and Matt Matt
[1:20:42] Dexter Jr. is getting chemo and
[1:20:46] radiation treatment for breast cancer.
[1:20:48] They live in Indiana.

[1:20:55] prayer breakfast is this coming up
[1:20:57] Saturday. And if you haven't uh RSVP,
[1:21:03] it'd be good for you to do that. So,
[1:21:05] we're looking forward to the Lord
[1:21:07] blessing in that.
[1:21:09] Pray one for another. Amen.
