[29:53] I guest the singing and I met brother
[29:55] wormal outside and I don't see brother
[29:59] egberg so I guess I missed it again
[30:01] today I like that singing good
[30:04] oldfashioned
[30:06] singing They you got quite a few
[30:08] preachers here I'll say that it's very
[30:10] fine to see this fine convention and my
[30:14] uh great opportunity today to to address
[30:17] you speak to you about the Lord which I
[30:21] know many of you could tell me about it
[30:24] and I'm just a baby to many of you and
[30:27] when it comes to addressing ministers
[30:29] I'm very kind of a little shy about that
[30:33] but they told it faith is the substance
[30:38] of things hoped for the evidence of
[30:40] Things Not Seen and my friend Joseph
[30:43] sure used some of that the other day
[30:45] when he gave out in the meeting at uh he
[30:48] never asked me if he said now can I
[30:49] announce it I said no Brother Joseph but
[30:51] I actually done announced it well uh
[30:55] when I do but come over so you uh had to
[30:58] bear with me a little while if you will
[31:00] be so kind to do it and this afternoon
[31:02] to speak a while and then tonight get
[31:05] ready for tonight service we're all so
[31:08] grateful for this great move of the Lord
[31:11] God and this and this convention here
[31:14] and the Philadelphia church for brother
[31:17] Bose for all the staff and the peoples
[31:20] of Chicago and around about we're
[31:22] grateful to you people to my opinion
[31:25] it's such things as this year that keeps
[31:27] the Backbone in America we wouldn't have
[31:30] any America if there wasn't any Lord
[31:33] Jesus here to help us be
[31:35] America after all the backbone of every
[31:38] nation is its morals when the morals
[31:41] drop in a nation then the nation's gone
[31:45] motherhood broken you just might as well
[31:47] hold up all other nations have done it
[31:49] and ours is no
[31:51] exception and we believe that the the
[31:55] great time when arms will be stacked for
[31:59] their last
[32:01] time and the Caps will sound for the
[32:04] last
[32:05] time as soon at hand when King Jesus
[32:09] shall come and take over the rain here
[32:11] on Earth and we're all looking for
[32:14] that and that's why these conventions
[32:17] are held and that's the reason that
[32:19] we're all gathered together because we
[32:21] have things in common to talk about of
[32:24] course our key note is Jesus Christ the
[32:27] son of God
[32:29] and I would look at present times at the
[32:33] things that is now I would be a very
[32:35] discouraged person but I learned a
[32:38] lesson one time or a little thing that I
[32:41] heard a man
[32:43] say they was going to give away a swin
[32:46] bicycle to the best Rider I don't know
[32:49] where they ever quoted it in this church
[32:52] among these people or
[32:53] not the boy that could ride a a 12in
[32:57] plank 100 yards could get a new swin
[33:02] bicycle and many of the boys around the
[33:04] city they thought they could ride it is
[33:07] going to win the contest and they had
[33:09] one little boy there was kind of a
[33:12] they were sure he wasn't going to win it
[33:14] so all the boys got on their one by one
[33:17] to try to ride it and all of them fell
[33:18] off but the little boy he rode on
[33:21] to the end of the plank got off won the
[33:23] swin bicycle all the other boys got
[33:26] around and said how did you do it he
[33:28] said now fellas I tell you what you done
[33:31] said when they started you off they give
[33:32] them a little push so they could get
[33:34] started hold them up let him start said
[33:36] you were looking down like this trying
[33:38] to keep your bicycle on the board I said
[33:41] I never noticed down here I see you do
[33:43] that and makes you nervous and said you
[33:45] fell off that I just put my eyes on the
[33:47] end and kept going towards the
[33:50] end that's
[33:52] it if we look right around here brethren
[33:55] we get nervous but let's look at the end
[33:58] at the
[34:00] end brother Jack was just according at
[34:03] the dinner table today uh something had
[34:06] struck real down deep in my heart and it
[34:10] said that a little boy was lost I
[34:12] believe it was an iron or Scotland one
[34:14] and he didn't know how to find his way
[34:16] back so the people were getting around
[34:18] him and trying to find he said well said
[34:21] in the city he lived in over the hill
[34:24] somewhere well there was a great big
[34:26] cross that if you just show me that
[34:28] cross and I can go home that's right
[34:31] that's right if you can show me the
[34:32] cross I'll find my way home that's
[34:35] that's the way home isn't it hallelujah
[34:37] amen
[34:39] now I don't know to speak to an audience
[34:43] like this uh I just thought I'd read a
[34:45] little verse or two of scripture here
[34:48] and then maybe speak on the word just
[34:50] for a few moments in my own oldfashioned
[34:54] sassar ass way of doing it and so uh
[34:58] over in Hebrews the 10th chapter and the
[35:00] 19th verse we read this having therefore
[35:05] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[35:08] holiest by the blood of
[35:12] Jesus let's ask our lord to bless his
[35:15] word father we are so grateful to have
[35:19] the word for Faith cometh by hearing the
[35:23] word and we as your servants today as
[35:27] men and women sitting here coming out of
[35:31] the field to refresh ourselves in this
[35:35] convention we pray heavenly father that
[35:37] you'll come to us again this afternoon
[35:39] as thou has always done for you promised
[35:42] you would and would bless us together
[35:46] today and let Thy word find its resting
[35:49] place in every heart for we ask it in
[35:52] Jesus name
[35:55] amen I would thought maybe just knowing
[35:59] last evening and never prepare anything
[36:02] because it's usually something else when
[36:04] I get there but just happen to think on
[36:06] this having boldness to enter into the
[36:09] holiest of holiest by the blood of Jesus
[36:14] Christ I thought I might take a little
[36:16] text this afternoon for a few moments on
[36:19] a hidden
[36:21] life now most all of us are in these
[36:24] conventions and so forth to try to find
[36:26] out how to to have a closer walk with
[36:30] God I'm sure that's your brother's uh uh
[36:33] um way this afternoon I I was thinking
[36:38] maybe I'd talk about the Supernatural
[36:42] and I don't know how to approach that
[36:45] it's just as much mysterious to me as it
[36:47] is to you and um well then a hidden life
[36:52] with Christ some way that we could hide
[36:55] away and get away from all of it and
[36:57] live with
[36:59] Christ am I looking at Henry
[37:02] Gro God bless you brother Henry I
[37:04] haven't seen you for a long time and
[37:06] brother I just haven't looked back and
[37:07] seen dad and recognize him when I had my
[37:10] great breakdown or come off the field
[37:13] for about eight months they were real
[37:16] brother and Daddy to me they stayed
[37:18] right with me all the time I never will
[37:20] forget the day that brother grew up
[37:22] there we went out in the cornfield to
[37:23] pray I was so nervous I stayed in the
[37:26] vision so long I couldn't tell whether
[37:28] it was in or out I never will forget
[37:30] brother Gro when he knelt down to pray
[37:32] with me put his arms around me just
[37:34] simple like said now Papa God will you
[37:37] come help brother
[37:39] Brandon Papa God will you come help
[37:42] brother
[37:43] Brandon that's always stay with me
[37:45] brother
[37:48] gr oh what will it be brother Gro some
[37:51] day I hoped I had my arm around you sit
[37:53] down with the evergreen trees where The
[37:55] Fountains of the Waters of life is
[37:57] Flowing from another Throne we be in the
[38:00] presence of our Papa God then forever
[38:02] and forever to live in his
[38:06] presence now God has made it so
[38:11] simple and of the Bible and to make the
[38:15] gospel so simple to even a person like
[38:19] myself that's
[38:21] uneducated uh would have an opportunity
[38:24] to
[38:25] speak uh and preach the go
[38:28] gopel and uh I was saying to the
[38:31] Brethren coming over how funny I feel to
[38:34] get up there today and know that before
[38:37] Scholars and some of the smartest men in
[38:39] the country sitting here and how my
[38:41] grammar how poor it is and how all
[38:46] unqualified but you
[38:48] know probably you all feel this like I
[38:51] do if you had to set before some Bishops
[38:53] and so forth but you know brotherr God
[38:56] doesn't dwell so so much in theology he
[38:59] dwells in love in humbleness where you
[39:03] can really everybody can get acquainted
[39:05] with him and KN him I'm so glad that
[39:07] he's he hasn't selected just a little
[39:10] handful or certain
[39:12] denomination he said whosoever
[39:15] will and so that even gives me and you a
[39:18] chance to come in and have fellowship
[39:21] and speak of
[39:22] him now God has made it so wonderful
[39:26] that in the old Tex Testament he where
[39:29] usually I go to for refuge for a text
[39:32] once in a while he's made the Old
[39:34] Testament in
[39:36] Parables and in symbolic forms to
[39:40] express itself in his doings that the
[39:44] simpleminded might be able to have a
[39:47] conception of his will and what he's
[39:49] done many times in the Old Testament how
[39:52] I have went back to find the old typing
[39:56] the new all always God did in what he's
[40:00] doing now in the New Testament he
[40:02] foreshadowed it in the Old Testament and
[40:06] all of those who neglected God and
[40:08] forsaken God in the Old Testament we can
[40:11] see by example what become of them and
[40:14] those who dared to have faith in Jehovah
[40:17] and stepped out in the Old Testament we
[40:19] see what happened to them now we make
[40:22] our choice right and we are thank God
[40:26] for a free nation and a place of worship
[40:31] to where we each one can set ourselveses
[40:34] in the faith of God and fly away from
[40:37] this Earth I'm glad of that today for
[40:39] there's plenty places you couldn't do
[40:42] that now for instance in the Old
[40:44] Testament how God gave all of his uh
[40:48] Parables back there and set forth his
[40:50] his um things that would be a shadow of
[40:54] today then that's the only way that I
[40:56] can teach the Bible they talk about Big
[40:59] Greek words and so forth they just tie
[41:01] me in all kinds of places but if I look
[41:05] back and see what God did back there as
[41:07] a foreshadow then I have some general
[41:10] conception of what he's doing today
[41:12] because that was a shadow if I'm going
[41:15] to the uh to the west and my Sun's
[41:19] rising in the East and My Shadow is
[41:21] before me and if I never seen myself or
[41:25] never know what I look like or a human
[41:26] being I'd have some conception of my
[41:29] form when I seen my shadow and the Old
[41:32] Testament is the shadow of the coming of
[41:35] Christ and everything foreshadowed the
[41:38] cross and in Christ all God's Redemption
[41:43] all these plans all the Plan of
[41:46] Salvation all was met at
[41:50] Calvary now how beautiful in the Old
[41:53] Testament how God foreshadowed this holy
[41:55] spirit that we're enjoying today
[41:57] how that he foreshadow the order and
[42:00] these conventions and how we could come
[42:01] together in
[42:03] fellowship and have a a fellowship
[42:07] together back there we see how in the
[42:11] early beginning of the of the church
[42:15] that how that God foreshadowed the place
[42:17] today where I think Brethren that we're
[42:19] entering now for this next
[42:23] blessing everyone knows that we're just
[42:27] on aor Tim like the great blessing of
[42:32] Divine Healing and the powers of the
[42:35] supernatural it's gone out that's
[42:37] brought about a Revival that's actually
[42:40] shooked the world the hardest that's
[42:41] ever been shooked in all the all the
[42:44] times there has never been a time in any
[42:47] age that Christianity shuck the entire
[42:50] world like it has the last five or six
[42:52] years right and every nation under ever
[42:56] placed to radio through by evangelist by
[43:00] uh we go into a place in different
[43:02] countries where they don't believe in
[43:04] God and there they find where the
[43:06] ordinary missionary had passed out some
[43:08] tracks which is fine but when they see
[43:10] the operation of the supernatural tens
[43:12] of thousands of heathen fall at the
[43:16] cross and serve the Lord Jesus it's been
[43:19] a mighty move now we've held this ground
[43:23] so long and I believe with all my heart
[43:26] that we're on the threshold of stepping
[43:28] into another Veil Yonder somewhere the
[43:31] word the greater mysteries of God will
[43:33] be known to the church and me for one
[43:36] I've got both ears and eyes and heart
[43:39] open to hear the message when it
[43:42] comes examine it for Satan will put out
[43:44] on many a false Runner but just lay it
[43:47] aside remember it's only signifying that
[43:49] something real is going to take place
[43:51] when you sit for Satan will do
[43:53] everything as I said last night to
[43:55] blockade the real Jewel of God when it's
[43:58] coming forth you'll you'll hear it he
[44:01] put out a blockade to catch Abel he put
[44:04] out one to catch Joseph one to catch
[44:06] Jesus and so forth and he'll do it one
[44:10] to get Moses for you can notice those
[44:13] things that Satan will try to block it
[44:16] and that's for I believe that the many
[44:18] Cults and things as we see rising over
[44:20] the nation is only a light post to say
[44:23] look out it will be here
[44:25] soon I've noticed among our Brethren
[44:29] that many of you as coming into to you
[44:31] as Full Gospel people coming from the
[44:32] Baptist Church myself and accepting the
[44:36] doctrine of the baptism of the holy
[44:38] spirit being a separate uh work of the
[44:42] Holy
[44:44] Spirit and I thought then when we when
[44:47] the Martin Luther reached justification
[44:51] by faith he thought that settled it that
[44:53] was a light for his day and he preached
[44:56] it and believed it and held on to it and
[44:58] it was the light of that day then he
[45:01] entered another Veil a man John Wesley
[45:04] when Calvinism begin to sweep the nation
[45:06] and they settle down to saying what
[45:08] God's go to do you'll do and does us no
[45:10] good to have a Revival God raised up
[45:12] John Wesley and he certainly smashed
[45:15] Calvinism to the ground to the place
[45:18] where it ought to have its right bals
[45:21] under the works of sanctification the
[45:24] second work of
[45:25] Grace nazarenes carried on and Along
[45:28] come the Pentecostal then next end the
[45:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit moving on up
[45:34] in the higher height and now when the
[45:38] Brethren received the baptism of the
[45:39] Holy Ghost they said this is the summit
[45:42] this is all of it but Brethren that's
[45:45] wrong there is no Summit to God's power
[45:49] we move on and on and on it's the
[45:53] unlimited resources of God has never
[45:56] been tapped yet blessings and powers
[45:59] that we know nothing about it's never
[46:01] been even revealed to archangels is
[46:03] laying just ahead for his church that
[46:05] will
[46:07] believe for Eye Has Not Seen ear is not
[46:10] heard NE has it enter the hearts of men
[46:12] what God has for them and story that
[46:13] love him so let's move up and claim our
[46:17] rights as God opens the gates and swings
[46:19] out to welcome that let's move on up
[46:21] into deeper depths and never colonize
[46:24] ourselves to organize ourselves and to
[46:26] get into a place where this is we
[46:28] believe this and that's all let's
[46:30] believe this plus how much more we can
[46:32] hear from
[46:33] God I think that are to be the motive of
[46:36] every man and woman that loves the Lord
[46:38] Jesus they'll receive all that you can
[46:40] from the hand of his Bountiful
[46:43] mercies it's my heart that's the reason
[46:46] I never jarn any organization or tuck
[46:48] sides with any groups because I wanted
[46:51] myself wide open for the love of God and
[46:53] for what he could give to me
[46:57] I noticed in the Bible one time speaking
[47:00] just for a few moments now in the Old
[47:03] Testament when a son was born into a
[47:05] home he was a son when he was borned he
[47:09] become a son when he was borned into a
[47:12] home in the ordinary typical Oriental
[47:15] home in those days the son was giving a
[47:18] place and a tutor that raised a child
[47:21] Paul beautifully speaks of it in the New
[47:25] Testament that how the tutor was to
[47:27] raise the child and we were the law was
[47:29] a tutor to bring us to Christ but then
[47:33] that child when he was born was in type
[47:36] of the church today the Born Again by
[47:40] the Holy Spirit and I believe God has
[47:43] been tutoring his church bringing it up
[47:48] raising it up to it's time now for
[47:50] something else to happen the church
[47:53] ought to be grown by this time but many
[47:57] of us who ought to be teaching others
[47:58] are yet Desiring to censor milk of the
[48:01] Bible see we need someone to teach us
[48:03] when we should be teachers and to that I
[48:06] bow my head in shame that I should know
[48:10] more about God than I do now here's one
[48:14] thing that I do believe that when a
[48:16] child the Bible speaks back there that
[48:20] when the child had been raised the tutor
[48:23] kept the father posted on the conduct of
[48:26] the child
[48:28] now the tutor in this manner has been
[48:30] the Holy Spirit to the Pentecostal and
[48:33] the church the holy ghost that give
[48:37] remember the child no matter what would
[48:40] ever take place it was born a child it
[48:44] will always be a child and when a man is
[48:47] borned of the Holy Ghost he becomes a
[48:50] child of God for it is actually a second
[48:54] birth a regeneration that creates
[48:57] something in the man that wasn't there
[48:59] to begin with whenever man is Born Into
[49:02] the household of faith he becomes a
[49:04] child then the Holy Spirit follows this
[49:07] man and brings word to God how he is
[49:10] progressing now after this child become
[49:13] of age now he's still a child but if the
[49:18] child was Reckless and never paid any
[49:21] attention and wasn't so interested in
[49:23] the father's work that child never
[49:25] become adopted to that
[49:27] family but if he was a correct child a
[49:31] good child and loved the work of his
[49:34] father and was interested and tried to
[49:36] do all he could to progress his father's
[49:38] work then the tutor brought that word to
[49:41] the father and there was What's called
[49:43] the placing of the son or as Paul gives
[49:46] it in over in Galatians the
[49:49] adoption that we was predestinated to
[49:52] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[49:56] the adoption now the same son that was
[49:58] born into a family could be adopted into
[50:01] the same family or placed in the same
[50:05] family or give a position in the family
[50:09] that he was born into and I do believe
[50:12] that that is the work of the Holy Spirit
[50:14] today among the church is trying to
[50:17] place in the church positionally
[50:20] Apostles teachers prophets and so forth
[50:24] as and we've seen many false salon arms
[50:27] and so forth moving amongst the people
[50:29] which only indicated that the real
[50:31] genuine adoption was at hand I believe
[50:35] it God has to place into the church
[50:38] that's the business of God not of man
[50:41] right now when this boy became of age
[50:45] and when he was ready then for his uh
[50:48] adoption and he had proved by the tutor
[50:51] had told the father that this boy was
[50:54] eligible for adoption he was taken out
[50:57] into a public place and there he was
[51:00] robed with a a robe a honor robe perhaps
[51:04] purple or some color of royalty and was
[51:08] set up and the
[51:10] whole city all the people around about
[51:15] seen the father adopt his own son into
[51:20] the
[51:21] family and then when he was adopted into
[51:24] the family already a son already a child
[51:30] already a heir of Grace but placed in
[51:33] the
[51:34] family you get it now when he was placed
[51:38] in the family and given his position
[51:41] then that
[51:42] boy's name on a check was just as good
[51:45] as his father's name on the
[51:48] check now I believe that that is the
[51:51] time that the church has arrived at the
[51:54] day that the next great move in the
[51:56] church is for God after we' seen the
[51:59] false alarms but now God will place in
[52:04] his church
[52:06] correctly Apostles prophets teachers
[52:11] evangelists not man-made Seminary
[52:14] Boughton but God will place into the
[52:18] church not theology run overs and
[52:21] overnights but God will place in the
[52:23] church as God has chosen as the holy
[52:26] Holy Ghost has tutored this church and
[52:28] raised it up and in there God will adopt
[52:31] into his into the phys his sons they're
[52:35] already his sons but whether they are
[52:38] worthy of the position that he has for
[52:41] them if you'll notice in a perfect type
[52:44] God did his own son the same way he
[52:47] taken three as a witness where the mouth
[52:49] of two or three witness ever word to be
[52:51] established Peter James and John love
[52:55] Faith and Hope and he taken them up into
[52:58] a mountain apart from the rest of the
[53:01] world and there before official
[53:06] Witnesses God adopted his own
[53:10] son he was transfigured before them and
[53:13] his rment did shine as a
[53:17] sun and a voice out of a cloud said this
[53:20] is my beloved Son hear ye him set him up
[53:26] on on the mountain but the witnesses
[53:28] there you see it hold them in a robe as
[53:32] bright as the sun shining in the and is
[53:34] they even Shine Like the Sun and its
[53:36] strength and God spoke out said this is
[53:41] my beloved Son hear ye
[53:44] him God adopted his own child into the
[53:49] family hear me no longer but this is my
[53:52] son who takes over from here on Amen
[53:57] that adoption is near the time and
[53:59] parable of the church it's time for that
[54:04] now let's drop back to the hidden life
[54:08] and find out what this is going to
[54:10] require to get into this place of
[54:12] adoption a hidden life we realize that
[54:15] in the Old Testament under the mosaical
[54:18] laws we found out in there any reader
[54:22] knows that there were three two veils
[54:25] two compartments and a congregation in
[54:28] the the setup of God's Tabernacle in the
[54:31] wilderness the first was the
[54:33] congregation than the holy place and the
[54:36] holiest of
[54:37] holies that's God's house that's God's
[54:40] dwelling place that's your dwelling
[54:44] place now you only live in a three- room
[54:47] house remember you may have two bedrooms
[54:49] you may have three kitchens but you only
[54:52] live in a three room house God lived in
[54:55] a three- room house house when God was
[54:57] here on Earth he occupied a three- room
[54:59] house the soul body and spirit of Jesus
[55:02] Christ in the temperal temple he he is
[55:05] in a congregation a holy place and
[55:08] holies of holies each one of them was
[55:10] separated one from another and each one
[55:12] had different frature in it to show The
[55:15] Dwelling Place a very beautiful type of
[55:19] the church The Sinner first comes into
[55:22] the uh the kitchen as it was the
[55:25] kitchens were you
[55:28] eat the living room is where you
[55:32] commune and
[55:34] the bedroom is where you
[55:38] rest oh
[55:42] God
[55:43] see The Sinner comes in faith cometh by
[55:46] hearing hearing of the word he comes and
[55:48] eats the
[55:50] word then he's baptized into the faith
[55:54] and accepts Christ as personal savior
[55:57] brings him in then to commune with
[56:00] God but then he moves on into the
[56:05] bedroom the still quietness with God for
[56:10] all the things of the world is shut out
[56:14] and he's alone in the Stillness with God
[56:18] Brethren sisters that's the place this
[56:22] Pentecostal move ought to be
[56:24] today oh not so much babylin we're we're
[56:28] Trinity we're methodists we're
[56:31] assemblies we're Church of God we are to
[56:33] be alone in that quiet Stillness with
[56:38] God don't you believe
[56:40] it certainly we ought to be notice when
[56:44] the high priest once the year entered in
[56:47] the first Veil than the second
[56:51] Veil on the outside of the lever where
[56:53] they wash the sacrifice then the
[56:55] sacrifice was killed put on the brazing
[56:57] Altar and the
[56:59] blood was put in a
[57:02] charger and the high priest once the
[57:05] year walked in behind the
[57:08] veil to make an atonement and notice a
[57:12] dressing of this high priest before he
[57:13] could enter the veil he had to be
[57:16] stripped and dressed right to go
[57:20] in that's what the church is today what
[57:23] it needs is a stripping off of all these
[57:25] little Cults and and dressed in the
[57:27] righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready
[57:30] to enter
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] [Applause]
[57:34] in his walk must be different every
[57:37] along the hyns of His Garment he had a
[57:40] pomegranate and then a bell and as he
[57:43] walked his walk was so perfect until the
[57:46] bells played holy holy holy unto the
[57:50] Lord what we need today is not whether
[57:53] we are assemblies or Church of God or
[57:55] Oneness or whatever it might be our walk
[57:58] ought to be playing to the public holy
[58:01] holy holy unto the
[58:05] Lord another thing he must be anointed
[58:09] before he goes in the anointing oil was
[58:13] made with the rose of
[58:14] Sharon and the crushing of the Rose
[58:17] brought forth the perfume and they put
[58:19] it on the oil it run on Aaron's beard
[58:21] Plumb to the hems of his skirt covered
[58:24] all over with the anointing oil walking
[58:28] right living right moving right dressed
[58:32] right there he went taking before him
[58:36] the blood and as he went behind the
[58:39] curtain into the third room there was a
[58:43] veil that dropped behind him that the
[58:45] outside world could not see him no more
[58:48] and every man or boy or woman or girl
[58:52] that ever is Anointed of God and Walks
[58:55] Behind that Temple the veil of God the
[58:58] Holy Ghost puts him in a secret
[59:01] place the veil drops behind him and the
[59:04] world and all of its things are cut off
[59:06] behind him that's the reason Brethren
[59:09] that we're holding up the adoption of
[59:11] God is our difference of life and
[59:13] fussing and quarreling amongst one
[59:14] another is a reason that Veil can't drop
[59:16] behind us and we can go into that
[59:18] presence of God that's right we're so
[59:22] interested in our denominations we're so
[59:24] interested in what the next fell are
[59:26] what what is that to thee follow thou
[59:31] me it's an individual Affair between
[59:33] every Minister how a minister ought to
[59:36] always get alone to himself even before
[59:38] he preaches before he prays before he
[59:41] does anything he should get along with
[59:44] God in that quiet place hid away with
[59:48] God how that that Veil once coming
[59:53] down now the fr Minature in this inside
[59:57] this veil was different from the
[59:59] outside way back in the congregation the
[1:00:02] lever that washed the Beast and the next
[1:00:05] veil was what it was the um the burning
[1:00:09] of the Beast body and in there was the
[1:00:13] seven golden candlesticks on the that
[1:00:16] represented the
[1:00:17] lamp and give the light and out into the
[1:00:21] outer courts was sunlight in the first
[1:00:24] veil was artif Ang notice and when they
[1:00:28] walk in here by this lamp then they go
[1:00:32] into the next court which was the
[1:00:34] holiest of holies as they walked in
[1:00:37] their
[1:00:38] anointed how that God has so planed out
[1:00:42] it's such a beautiful thing for us as we
[1:00:44] see the great plan there of God's
[1:00:47] Eternal
[1:00:48] salvation how that his ministers should
[1:00:51] walk in this how they should prepare
[1:00:54] themselves to enter into this now on the
[1:00:56] inside of this enter Court the called
[1:00:59] the holiest of holiest there was a piece
[1:01:01] of furniture sitting there called The
[1:01:03] Mercy Seat and the Covenant was in the
[1:01:07] ark and the Ark had two
[1:01:11] cherubin and it was on the inside that
[1:01:14] was a Furniture inside of the Holy place
[1:01:17] next coming out was a golden Candlestick
[1:01:20] then on out to the
[1:01:21] laad now perfectly represents the age of
[1:01:25] Luther Wesley and Pentecost exactly the
[1:01:29] three steps are dispensations of his
[1:01:33] grace that's been given to Mankind we
[1:01:35] are in the last dispensation I believe
[1:01:38] that with all my heart see now
[1:01:41] notice then also in this great move how
[1:01:46] God brought them in there in this great
[1:01:49] uh Place Moses one time was told by God
[1:01:54] when the Mana begin to all the Mana was
[1:01:56] a type of Life Christ coming down from
[1:02:01] heaven and perishing here on Earth that
[1:02:03] he might give us life the Mana Came From
[1:02:07] Heaven laid on the earth and the people
[1:02:09] eat it to substain life Christ came down
[1:02:13] from heaven and become Mana that we
[1:02:16] might live by
[1:02:19] him and notice now the people eating the
[1:02:23] Mana they had to get it quickly and eat
[1:02:25] it
[1:02:26] because when the sun rose it wasn't long
[1:02:29] till it was
[1:02:31] perished the type there of Christ the
[1:02:34] Holy Spirit the Mana was a type of the
[1:02:38] Holy Ghost today as God brought the
[1:02:41] church in natural with natural Mana he's
[1:02:43] bringing the church today spiritual on
[1:02:45] spiritual Mana when the church had first
[1:02:48] overcome come over the Red Sea type of
[1:02:51] the blood passed over into the journey
[1:02:53] on the road to the promised land Mana
[1:02:55] rain the first
[1:02:57] night amen and when the church was
[1:03:00] passed over from Life unto death on the
[1:03:04] day of Pentecost God reigned the
[1:03:06] spiritual Mana Out of Heaven that
[1:03:09] sustained the church until Jesus comes
[1:03:11] again or we pass into the Millennium
[1:03:13] into the promised
[1:03:15] land
[1:03:16] amen oh when they picked it up and they
[1:03:20] would eat it they said it was sweet it
[1:03:22] tastes like Honey in the Rock they said
[1:03:25] tast like honey David Called It Honey in
[1:03:27] the Rock and that's what it is now
[1:03:31] notice a type the Mana never did cease
[1:03:36] to fall until the day they entered the
[1:03:39] promised land for 40 years the same Mana
[1:03:42] fell every day
[1:03:45] hallelujah how you going to take the
[1:03:47] Holy Ghost and leave it at Pentecost
[1:03:49] brother it's been one continually
[1:03:51] Pentecost that cause a hardness of man's
[1:03:53] heart to fail to eat the Mana that's
[1:03:56] right notice then it was a tipe now on
[1:04:01] the day of Pentecost when our Mana as
[1:04:04] soon as the people had went into the
[1:04:07] upper room and obeyed the Commandments
[1:04:09] of the Lord Jesus and carried waited at
[1:04:13] the city of Jerusalem for the going
[1:04:15] forth of the Holy Ghost the first time
[1:04:17] there came from Heaven a sound like a
[1:04:19] Russian Mighty Wind that filled all the
[1:04:21] house where they were setting clothing
[1:04:22] tongues set up on them like fire they
[1:04:25] were all filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:26] begin to speak with other tongues as the
[1:04:28] spirit gave them utterance out into the
[1:04:31] streets they went a cowardly little
[1:04:33] bunch of preachers hid away in an upper
[1:04:37] room but all of a sudden there came the
[1:04:41] mana come pouring down to sustain their
[1:04:44] souls and out into the streets they went
[1:04:47] with an experience that they had never
[1:04:48] had
[1:04:50] before a beautiful type of God
[1:04:54] sustaining his church knew this journey
[1:04:56] to the promised land notice Brethren
[1:05:00] then how long was this Mana to last it
[1:05:03] lasted the entire Journey until they hit
[1:05:06] into another dispensation over into the
[1:05:09] promised land how long is this the last
[1:05:12] until Jesus
[1:05:15] comes Peter said repent every one of you
[1:05:18] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:05:19] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:05:21] and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for
[1:05:24] the promises unto you to your children
[1:05:26] and to them as far off even as many as
[1:05:28] the Lord Our God shall call how long was
[1:05:31] it to last as many as the Lord Our God
[1:05:34] shall call and as long as the
[1:05:37] dispensation of Grace lasts God will
[1:05:39] still call men and women to his
[1:05:41] service so the Holy Ghost is just as
[1:05:44] real today now he never said now when
[1:05:49] they eat this Mana
[1:05:52] remember if they eateth man many people
[1:05:56] eaten and said this is it they had to
[1:05:59] gather it fresh every day that's right
[1:06:02] that's right they had to gather the Mana
[1:06:03] fresh every day because along about
[1:06:06] 9:00 on their second step it would go to
[1:06:09] Melton it would perish and many times
[1:06:12] people living in God's second room even
[1:06:16] in communion after they've already
[1:06:18] received the word and come into the
[1:06:20] second step of receiving Christ into
[1:06:23] their life and never yet know what that
[1:06:25] secret room is what that bedroom what
[1:06:27] that rest place is they eat the
[1:06:30] Mana but did you notice if they let it
[1:06:33] lay too long it finally melted
[1:06:38] out there was it perished away and I
[1:06:42] think a lot of people has had a lot of
[1:06:44] Campground cramps anyhow that when they
[1:06:48] go and eat of the Lord on the campground
[1:06:50] and before another revival can come
[1:06:52] along they're all back and twisted up in
[1:06:54] some kind of culture something else
[1:06:57] what's the matter brother you've never
[1:06:58] walked in somewhere else God said Moses
[1:07:02] make you a gold and pot
[1:07:05] Hallelujah and in there place this mana
[1:07:09] and remember that a Believer when he
[1:07:11] walked in there that Mana never did run
[1:07:13] out it was always fresh and new and
[1:07:16] sweet as the days went by as the years
[1:07:19] went by and any man who comes to Christ
[1:07:22] and hides away in the veil falls behind
[1:07:24] him he's in the presence of almighty God
[1:07:26] eating a Mana day and night from one
[1:07:28] hour to the other it's always just as
[1:07:31] sweet as it was the first day it fell
[1:07:33] into your
[1:07:35] soul that's what we need today is get in
[1:07:38] where the things are
[1:07:39] at not stand off and pretend or not
[1:07:42] stand off and act but actually get in
[1:07:44] there
[1:07:47] amen the man wants now remember only
[1:07:51] Believers only the elect comes into that
[1:07:55] that God God has chosen you I believe in
[1:07:57] Revelations 2 that he that
[1:08:00] overcometh so it's promised to
[1:08:02] Overcomers you said oh I overcome
[1:08:04] smoking that ain't what he's talking
[1:08:06] about the whole lot more goes to this
[1:08:09] Christianity besides not smoking
[1:08:11] cigaretts or drinking whiskey he that
[1:08:15] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[1:08:18] he will be my son I'll be his God and
[1:08:22] listen I will give him of the Hidden
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:29] Mana
[1:08:31] amen I'll hide him
[1:08:34] away and I'll give you the hidden things
[1:08:38] the world on the outside of the curtain
[1:08:40] don't know nothing about it
[1:08:44] hallelujah oh they eat Mana but they
[1:08:47] don't know about
[1:08:49] this I'll give to him the hidden Mana
[1:08:53] I'll give him a stone with his name
[1:08:57] you get what I mean entering in to the
[1:09:02] adoption are the hidden place with God
[1:09:05] Ministers of the Gospel don't care about
[1:09:07] your denominations and what the world
[1:09:09] thinks but seek to enter in to the
[1:09:12] hidden Mana where the full revelation of
[1:09:16] God is made love perfect in your heart
[1:09:19] and you and God and everything else is
[1:09:21] at rest let anything come what may your
[1:09:25] hidden way what a place to
[1:09:28] live oh that's let me abide
[1:09:33] there as a song said let me rest neath
[1:09:36] the
[1:09:37] tree where the so freely flows where the
[1:09:40] lamb is the light and the soul of the
[1:09:44] saved never die amen sure they ate men
[1:09:49] out there but they didn't know about
[1:09:51] this they've never been in there have
[1:09:54] you my dear
[1:09:56] brother don't despise my ignorance but I
[1:09:59] want to ask you something Have you ever
[1:10:01] come to the place in life where Christ
[1:10:04] meant more to you and all the arguing
[1:10:05] you could do about your
[1:10:06] church as Christ meant more to you than
[1:10:10] all the world I don't mean from any
[1:10:12] emotional or mental work up I mean from
[1:10:14] the depths of your heart that something
[1:10:16] settled in there something's taking
[1:10:18] place that you don't know how it come
[1:10:20] but you're hid away and your whole
[1:10:22] motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you
[1:10:25] entered that place my dear brother have
[1:10:28] you come into that place where you don't
[1:10:30] care what anyone says not to go out and
[1:10:32] act smart but the little love of God Is
[1:10:35] So anchored into you that you can't see
[1:10:37] nothing else your whole motive is to do
[1:10:40] the will of God love for everybody
[1:10:44] flowing free from every what a place to
[1:10:48] live that's the hidden place that's the
[1:10:51] place where we got to come to my
[1:10:53] brethren that's the place where God
[1:10:56] Reveals His secret things that's a place
[1:10:58] where God does a placing in the calling
[1:11:01] you get what I
[1:11:03] mean in this same place we don't have
[1:11:05] much time because I got to hurry but
[1:11:08] just for another thought in this same
[1:11:10] place they put Aaron's
[1:11:14] Rod to make a decision who God had
[1:11:17] chosen who he
[1:11:19] hadn't and that
[1:11:22] Rod that was a dead stick
[1:11:26] and one night's time come to life
[1:11:30] brought buds brought flowers and brought
[1:11:34] arms it both come to life brought
[1:11:38] blossoms and yielded
[1:11:40] fruits a very
[1:11:45] typical
[1:11:46] pattern of the
[1:11:49] center being brought to God into the
[1:11:52] holy Place remember that Rod p passed
[1:11:55] over every one of those other elements
[1:11:58] and he got inside the holy place still
[1:12:01] dead but to
[1:12:04] abide it never come to life when he
[1:12:06] brought first brought it in
[1:12:08] there that's the reason the holy
[1:12:10] spirit's watched you since you received
[1:12:12] the Holy
[1:12:13] Ghost see your attitude towards his
[1:12:17] kingdom if it's been selfish motives if
[1:12:21] the things that you thought of is in in
[1:12:22] farther denomination or if it's to are
[1:12:25] there better you your position if it's
[1:12:28] to make you a man looked up to in the
[1:12:30] world if it's to build you a big church
[1:12:32] somewhere or some popularity or some
[1:12:35] other thing
[1:12:37] outside of increasing or EMB bettering
[1:12:40] the kingdom of God brother something's
[1:12:45] wrong
[1:12:47] amen now when that old dead Rod was
[1:12:51] brought in there and laid in the
[1:12:53] presence of God himself
[1:12:55] what happened it
[1:12:59] bued it
[1:13:00] blossomed and it yielded
[1:13:04] fruit showing that we born in that Rod
[1:13:09] was off of an almond
[1:13:11] tree and when it was cut off it died and
[1:13:16] when man was cut off from God he died
[1:13:20] spiritually but once brought into the
[1:13:23] place of God before the presence of God
[1:13:27] he comes to
[1:13:29] life and he yields life he yield
[1:13:33] blossoms he yields
[1:13:36] fruit Jesus come to the tree to look for
[1:13:39] fruit on it it had everything but fruit
[1:13:42] that's right and that's what's the
[1:13:44] matter with our churches today we got
[1:13:45] everything but fruit we can shout we can
[1:13:48] speak with tongues we can argue the
[1:13:51] scriptures we can teach our theology but
[1:13:53] when it comes to fruit bearing the tree
[1:13:56] is very
[1:13:58] lean what is the fruits of the spirit
[1:14:01] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:14:06] goodness
[1:14:09] patience it shows Manny is still
[1:14:13] outside on the first altar you're still
[1:14:16] open to the public you're still
[1:14:19] listening to hear what John's got to say
[1:14:20] about it what the neighbor will think or
[1:14:24] something for yourself
[1:14:26] but once behind the Bale and the
[1:14:28] curtains is dropped you're hiding God to
[1:14:32] Christ
[1:14:34] see notice what a beautiful picture of
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:39] centner laying in the presence of God
[1:14:42] now this Rod laying there it was
[1:14:46] refreshed it was fragnant brought the
[1:14:50] fragrance of the Blossom and it yielded
[1:14:53] fruit the but came forth now a beautiful
[1:14:58] type of that is given Earthly speaking
[1:15:01] the first thing that we have to do
[1:15:03] before we can have a crop we have to
[1:15:05] have
[1:15:06] seed and the seed placed in the ground
[1:15:09] will yield its
[1:15:11] fruits is that
[1:15:13] right now the first thing we have to do
[1:15:15] is to receive
[1:15:18] Christ now the tree had to be an almond
[1:15:21] tree to start with
[1:15:25] and Christ you have to receive him
[1:15:27] before you come into this
[1:15:29] place and then in the presence of
[1:15:33] this great God then these things take
[1:15:38] place what see the word Christ was the
[1:15:41] word in the beginning was the word and
[1:15:43] the word is with God and the Word was
[1:15:46] God Christ comes into the life of the
[1:15:49] human being now notice the first thing
[1:15:52] was a refreshment what made makes a sea
[1:15:55] grow did you ever get up of a
[1:15:58] morning and find the DW that's fell down
[1:16:02] from heaven and refreshes the Earth how
[1:16:06] does it refresh it when it's at
[1:16:09] peace the D don't fall in
[1:16:12] daytime the D falls in the night time
[1:16:15] when everything is at
[1:16:17] peace the do can never fall on you my
[1:16:20] brother as long as you're fussing and
[1:16:22] arguing and stewing about the things
[1:16:24] here on this Earth
[1:16:25] get along with God and let the D Drops
[1:16:29] of Mercy P upon
[1:16:31] you and the
[1:16:33] Stillness Precious Memories how they
[1:16:38] linger how they ever fill my
[1:16:42] soul in the Stillness of the midnight
[1:16:46] Secrets
[1:16:48] unfold how that God can get his believer
[1:16:51] with the curtains dropped around him
[1:16:53] alone to himself
[1:16:55] he'll bring down a refreshing from
[1:16:58] Heavens that there's no other person or
[1:17:02] no other way in the world to ever know
[1:17:03] it only he that's laying there did you
[1:17:06] ever walk out of the morning that real
[1:17:08] fresh School
[1:17:10] feeling God has refreshed this
[1:17:16] Earth pregnant did you ever go into a
[1:17:19] rose
[1:17:21] garden down my place that got a lot of
[1:17:24] honey
[1:17:25] suckles the honeysuckle don't smell much
[1:17:28] along In the Heat of the
[1:17:29] day but it's early of the morning when
[1:17:33] all the air has been
[1:17:36] purified then that Romeo of the
[1:17:41] honeysuckle let a man be out fussing
[1:17:45] fighting stewing and you'll never get
[1:17:47] much of Aroma from that of the Gospel
[1:17:50] but let him get alone one time in the
[1:17:52] Stillness of God every man it comes to
[1:17:55] the pulpit ought to dwell alone
[1:18:00] first then comes the
[1:18:02] fruits yielding forth its
[1:18:05] fruits every man that stays in the
[1:18:08] presence of God into this great secret
[1:18:11] place hid away will yield the fruits of
[1:18:14] righteousness peace love joy long
