[24:06] brother
[24:11] brandom now in numbers 199 we want to
[24:14] read this U uh text or this scripture
[24:20] rather and a man that is clean Shall
[24:23] Gather up the ashes of the heer and
[24:26] shall lay them
[24:28] up without the camp in a clean place and
[24:32] it shall be kept for the congregation
[24:36] watch now for the
[24:38] congregation of the children of Israel
[24:41] for a water of Separation it is a
[24:47] purification for
[24:50] sin notice not to
[24:54] everybody to the congregation of the
[24:57] children of Israel
[24:59] Israel the Waters of Separation now in
[25:04] Ephesians the 5th chapter and beginning
[25:08] with the 22nd verse wi submit yourselves
[25:12] unto your own husbands as unto the Lord
[25:16] for the husband is the head of the wife
[25:18] even as Christ is the head of the church
[25:21] and he is the savior of the body
[25:26] therefore as the church is in sub
[25:29] subject unto Christ so let the wives be
[25:33] to their own husbands and everything
[25:36] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[25:40] also loved the church and gave himself
[25:43] for it now here's what I want to say now
[25:45] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[25:49] with the washing of the Water by the
[25:55] word now this little text tonight
[25:58] if I should call it a text and I trust
[26:01] that people here and also out in the
[26:04] telephone hookups will not disregard
[26:09] this and think that it's meant in a way
[26:11] of sacrilegious though to take a text
[26:14] like this it would sound
[26:16] sacriligious the subject that I'm using
[26:18] for tonight is a thinking man's
[26:23] filter that sound very radical for a
[26:28] subject for a minister that's so opposed
[26:31] to smoking would take a text like that a
[26:35] thinking man's
[26:38] filter it come to pass that the other
[26:41] morning when I went squirrel hunting if
[26:44] you people out on the out on the radio
[26:47] the air or on the telephone W could have
[26:50] seen the expression on this
[26:51] congregation's face when I announced my
[26:53] text You' have had a laugh out of it a
[26:56] thinking man's filter
[26:58] well it all happened up where the angels
[27:03] of the Lord appeared to me one morning
[27:06] and them squirrels was spoke into
[27:09] existence all of you rem when had taken
[27:11] place and also just at the top of the
[27:15] hill where I was standing before just
[27:18] before preaching the seven Church ages
[27:20] going hunting one morning before
[27:21] daylight there stood I thought the sun
[27:24] was coming up about 4:00 in the morning
[27:27] unusual I seen that light and I turned
[27:29] around and there stood the seven golden
[27:32] candlesticks standing up there on top of
[27:34] the hill with like a rain bows coming up
[27:37] through the pipes and feeding out
[27:39] immediately after that the Lord Jesus
[27:42] appeared to us and right then I Heard a
[27:45] Voice that said the Jehovah of the Old
[27:48] Testament is Jesus of the new and there
[27:51] he was after a while revealed after
[27:54] those seven golden candlesticks
[27:58] then notice that how many remembers that
[28:00] text I wrote it on the back of a of a
[28:02] box of of uh cateres I had in my pocket
[28:07] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[28:10] the new God in heaven knows that was
[28:14] true when I crossed that place where it
[28:18] appeared to me a little later on about
[28:19] the
[28:20] squirrel then when I called my good
[28:23] friend Jack Moore few months later to
[28:26] ask when I started preach the seven
[28:27] Church ages Revelations 1 and he was
[28:32] standing white all over his hair was
[28:35] like wool how could he being just 33
[28:39] years old and be white all over and
[28:42] Brother Moore a very
[28:44] fine cultured Christian gentleman and a
[28:48] scholar one of the best that I know of
[28:51] and he said brother BR that was Jesus
[28:54] after his glorified condition that's the
[28:56] way he looks now
[28:58] but that didn't ring a bell with me and
[29:01] I kept praying until one day before I
[29:04] started seven Church ages I couldn't get
[29:06] that first chapter straightened out
[29:08] right how could a man 33 years old
[29:11] resurrected in the same body that the
[29:14] apostles recognized him know him to be
[29:18] and how could he be way up maybe an 80
[29:22] or 90 years old great white wool over
[29:25] his face and his beard white as snow I
[29:28] read over in the book of the of Daniel
[29:31] where he came to the Ancient of Days
[29:33] whose hair was as white as
[29:35] wool and I seen that Ancient of Days he
[29:39] was that Ancient of Days the same
[29:41] yesterday today forever see it was a
[29:43] symbol and why the white wool and then
[29:47] uh the Holy Spirit seemed to speak to me
[29:50] about a picture I saw one time of an
[29:53] ancient judge then I went to the history
[29:56] I went back into the Bible History and
[29:59] all find out in the old judges like the
[30:03] high priest in Israel you had to have
[30:05] that white gray woolly like hair and
[30:08] beard because the white over him
[30:11] signified that he was supreme authority
[30:15] of the judges in Israel and even in
[30:18] today and down to a few hundred years
[30:20] ago maybe a couple hundred years ago or
[30:22] maybe not like that later than that all
[30:25] the English judges no matter how young
[30:28] they was or how old he was when they
[30:29] went in for judgment they wore a white
[30:32] wig and to show that there's no other
[30:35] authority in that Kingdom above their
[30:38] word their word is the ultimate of the
[30:42] Kingdom what they say that's all of it
[30:46] and now then I seen that there he was
[30:50] standing there yet young man but the
[30:53] white wig on he was the full supreme
[30:56] authority he was the
[30:59] word and he's having wearing the white
[31:02] wig then later on when we got through
[31:06] and the sermon and went out west and
[31:08] when the angels of the Lord appeared out
[31:11] there for the Seven Seals and it went up
[31:13] into the air which we had the picture of
[31:14] it here and around over the country
[31:17] there he was standing there
[31:19] still wigged with that supreme
[31:23] authority he is the head of the church
[31:26] he's head of the body there's nothing
[31:28] like him anywhere he made all things by
[31:31] himself he made all things for himself
[31:33] and without he there wasn't nothing made
[31:35] he has all authority in heavens and
[31:37] earth and everything belongs to him and
[31:39] in him dwells the fullness of the
[31:42] godhead bodily and the Word was God and
[31:46] made flesh Among Us and he was the one
[31:48] who revealed the entire secret of the
[31:52] whole Plan of Salvation all the prophets
[31:55] and wise men had spoke of he alone was
[31:58] that wigged one and supreme authority
[32:03] now I stopped up on the hill the other
[32:06] morning looked like there' been some
[32:08] squirrels been cutting up there and I
[32:09] started to sit down and i' just been
[32:11] there a moment when the bushes struck by
[32:14] me in a some great big fellow with a
[32:16] double barrel musket of a thing come
[32:18] walking out through the bushes there
[32:20] like scar the Daylights out of me um
[32:23] went on over scooted down I was afraid
[32:25] to move afraid to'd shoot me and the
[32:27] bushes moved so I just sat real still a
[32:29] squirrel started up over the hill and he
[32:32] powdered both barrels with him and so he
[32:34] missed him and so the squirrel went down
[32:36] over the hill I thought now I'll get
[32:37] away with all that noise that's echoing
[32:39] he's got his gun unloaded and I started
[32:41] down the hill and a guy shot right in
[32:43] front of me they turned me back this way
[32:45] and I start over here go down another
[32:47] way and a 22 rifle started the bullets
[32:49] buzzing above me I said see I'm in an
[32:50] awful place so I turned around and went
[32:53] down by the river and I thought I go
[32:55] down here and hide till they get done so
[32:58] I can get
[32:59] out and on the road down I have to draw
[33:04] my attention was drawn to look over to
[33:07] my right side and as I did there laid an
[33:10] empty cigarette package where one of
[33:13] them throw down and all the running of
[33:16] the when the squirrels were going
[33:17] through the bushes and I picked up this
[33:20] certain cigarette pack and was looked I
[33:23] never picked it up by bigger part and I
[33:25] looked down at it I didn't pick it up cu
[33:27] I don't like the smell of the things to
[33:29] begin with and I look down there and
[33:31] it's a a certain tobacco company that I
[33:33] guess I shouldn't call their name but
[33:35] you know what said on there a thinking
[33:38] man's filter and a smoking man's
[33:44] taste I looked at that thing
[33:47] and I thought a thinking man's
[33:51] filter I thought a man could think it
[33:54] all he wouldn't smoke at all how could
[33:57] it be a thinking man's filter a thinking
[34:00] man wouldn't smoke at
[34:02] all all right now I thought how
[34:06] deceiving that is now that tobacco
[34:10] companies are supposed to be
[34:14] American and all if we live to our
[34:17] policy we would be working to help one
[34:20] another if we have a feeling one for the
[34:23] other and how
[34:26] hypocritical uh uh the reason I never
[34:29] call the company's name I've got to say
[34:31] some bad things about them and how
[34:35] hypocritical can anybody be to make
[34:38] money a thinking man won't smoke at all
[34:44] but how are the American public fall for
[34:47] it they think that that's wonderful now
[34:50] look you cannot you cannot ask anybody s
[34:55] this as you you cannot have smoke
[34:58] without having
[34:59] tar if there one little speck of smoke
[35:02] comes to that's tar and if you don't get
[35:05] any smoke well you don't get any tar you
[35:08] don't get any anything you're just
[35:10] drawing against a solid stick but as
[35:13] long as you get any smoke at all you're
[35:16] drawing in
[35:18] cancer
[35:19] nicotine if you've been with me last
[35:22] year year before last believe wasn't the
[35:23] world's fair when you Brin and all of
[35:26] them up their own demonstration
[35:28] and you see him take that cigarette put
[35:31] it in something and pull it across a
[35:32] piece of marble that doctor taking a
[35:35] swab rolled across there and got the
[35:37] nicotine off of it and put it on the
[35:39] back of a white ratp and put him in a
[35:42] cage and every seven days they tucking
[35:43] out and the rat was so full of cancer he
[35:46] couldn't walk from the nicotine out of
[35:49] one
[35:51] cigarette then he said you know they say
[35:54] that you can get it through a filter he
[35:57] said you you cannot have a filter any
[36:00] filter that would take nicotine out
[36:02] takes the Smoke Out said because you
[36:05] have to have smoke have tar to make the
[36:08] smoke and it's the tar that gives the
[36:10] cancer and then he went pulled it
[36:12] through water and said sometimes you
[36:13] think you can filter it through that
[36:15] every time that you don't matter where
[36:16] you pull it that they say I don't inhale
[36:18] it they put it in your mouth and spit it
[36:20] out then he took that and rolled it up
[36:21] and put it under something here and
[36:22] showed it was still cancer what do you
[36:25] do swallow it right down your throat see
[36:27] and no matter what you do it's still
[36:30] death see and then to think that a
[36:34] company would deceive a man enough or
[36:37] try to deceive their own people it's
[36:40] like a vulture living off of their its
[36:43] own
[36:45] kind money making selling death to the
[36:50] the country and the young man and go out
[36:53] there on the Battlefront and die for
[36:55] them then turn around and sell such a
[36:57] thing is that under a false
[37:00] pretense a thinking man's filter but a
[37:04] smoking man's taste you'd have to have
[37:06] the smoke to get the
[37:08] taste Smoking Man taste how the people
[37:11] fall far they get it now it's only to
[37:15] deceive you more see it's of the devil
[37:18] they don't care for your life they ain't
[37:21] got no feeling for you they sell you
[37:24] that stuff just to watch you die as long
[37:26] as they get money
[37:28] like politics and War I don't believe in
[37:30] War I don't believe that we all ever
[37:32] should have ever had a war I believe in
[37:35] the great Kingdom that God bringing the
[37:37] great civilization that'll be brought in
[37:38] under his own great Dominion there will
[37:41] never be another War Nation won't lift
[37:44] up Spears against Nation there'll all be
[37:47] peace Eternal Peace So this kind of a
[37:50] civilization brings war and more
[37:52] civilized we get out this the more war
[37:54] we have one trying to be more civilized
[37:57] and more civilized makes more
[37:59] war see and look what under this
[38:02] civilization that a person would put out
[38:05] such a thing as that and the only thing
[38:08] it does it only deceives you to make you
[38:12] buy more
[38:13] cigarettes for if a man smokes
[38:16] cigarettes and I believe it is of the
[38:18] devil and there a nicotine Devil in a
[38:21] man and a woman and if one cigarette
[38:25] would satisfy that nicotine devil till
[38:27] they leave you alone and quit haunting
[38:29] you with one cigarette then you take a
[38:31] filter just that's one3 of that smoke
[38:33] through there then or one3 of that
[38:35] nicotine through there then you'll take
[38:38] three cigarettes that take the place of
[38:40] that one and you'll smoke three to
[38:42] one see it's only a a
[38:46] scheme a
[38:48] deceit a scheme to try to sell
[38:54] cigarettes they can sell more that way
[38:57] than they can but just let the man smoke
[38:59] the straight tobacco uh in his pipe or
[39:02] in his cigarette now see it's of the
[39:05] devil as I stood there looking at it and
[39:08] thinking of how deceitful it was a
[39:11] question came to me and I sto back
[39:13] looked at the pack again and I just
[39:16] seemed like something said to me but the
[39:19] slogan is all right a thinking man's
[39:23] filter a smoking man's taste
[39:28] it came to me that that
[39:31] deceitfulness also in the natural Rim
[39:35] there into debaca is something on the
[39:37] order of the churches of today see a
[39:41] deceitfulness has come to the whole
[39:43] world has become a great
[39:46] deception of what is really true and
[39:49] what's right see even in politics and in
[39:53] Social Affair in school in everything it
[39:58] becomes a
[40:00] deceitfulness a young fellow was telling
[40:02] me the other day that he was down to an
[40:05] army camp and a young Soldier got run
[40:08] over by a tank his lungs stomach or
[40:11] whatever was punctured and they went up
[40:13] to the hospital they had three or four
[40:15] doctors stand there in line and
[40:17] everybody stand in line and two or three
[40:19] soldiers holding their buddy up him just
[40:21] bar could breathe every time he breathe
[40:23] that rib would stick right into his
[40:24] lungs and make him bre bleeding inward
[40:27] ly and they let that young man stand
[40:30] there in that
[40:32] line way back in the back of the line
[40:35] and let them some of them guys with
[40:37] nothing but an earache or something go
[40:38] ahead and about the time he got up there
[40:41] some Colonel come in with a little child
[40:44] that had rash his little boy or girl had
[40:47] rash on his hand and he stopped that
[40:49] line to put the cel's child in and that
[40:52] boy punctured dying
[40:57] there you are oh if that Colonel would
[41:00] have been a genuine feeling for his
[41:03] brother out there in the line he said
[41:05] this kid can wait get that man up here
[41:08] quickly do something for him but every
[41:12] man wants to show his authority now
[41:14] they're not all like that no they're not
[41:17] all like that but there's too many like
[41:19] that there's too many of them it's like
[41:22] that but the man only thing he was
[41:25] thinking of is his own little boy that
[41:27] had a rash on his hand and not thinking
[41:30] about that poor boy standing there
[41:32] mashed under a tank the very tank and
[41:35] maybe the very boy that would save his
[41:37] life someday on the
[41:40] Battlefront they they don't stop to
[41:42] think only for
[41:45] themselves a thinking man
[41:48] filter I looked at it and I thought
[41:50] something like the the denominations of
[41:53] the day the churches that we had each
[41:56] one of them has their own
[42:02] filter they have their own type of
[42:06] filter they let just what come in they
[42:09] want to and what not come
[42:12] in what they filter in and filter out
[42:15] with their own kind of a
[42:18] filter they just let so much of the
[42:21] world get in to satisfy the unbelievers
[42:25] that's in there they'll take them in no
[42:28] matter what they are if they got
[42:30] money they'll take them in no matter
[42:32] what they are if they're
[42:33] proper but there's one thing about it
[42:36] you can't get in the Church of God like
[42:37] that not the denomination I mean the
[42:40] real genuine Church of
[42:43] God like the tobacco companies out today
[42:46] the people that comes into these said
[42:49] churches or denominations they have a
[42:52] taste and that taste is the classics of
[42:55] the world
[42:57] amen and each denomination has their own
[43:00] filter and they filter out all the true
[43:04] Christians that would say Amen when he
[43:06] was
[43:06] preaching and bring in all the bobbed
[43:09] haired painted
[43:11] face uh Jazzy Bells that's in the
[43:14] country as long as they are
[43:18] popular so and so comes a movie star a
[43:22] great person that's the kind of a filter
[43:25] that they use our denomination so and so
[43:28] the president or the the colonel or some
[43:30] belongs to our denomination see what
[43:33] kind of a filter they
[43:35] [Music]
[43:36] use that filter of course is of the
[43:39] world the people of the world the people
[43:42] they know what they want so if they have
[43:45] to get what they want then they'll have
[43:47] to have a certain kind of filter and
[43:50] enough of the world speak to to satisfy
[43:52] their worldly
[43:55] taste a painting man 's filter a smoking
[43:59] man's
[44:02] taste a religious world's
[44:05] filter and a worldly man's
[44:08] taste they want to be religious they
[44:11] think they must be religious because
[44:13] they have a
[44:14] soul when we first come to this country
[44:16] you found the Indian worshiping sons and
[44:20] so forth because why he is a human being
[44:23] we go back to the far jungles of Africa
[44:26] we find the native worshiping something
[44:29] why they're human
[44:31] beings and they what must worship so the
[44:33] human being no matter how Fallen he is
[44:36] he still knows there's something
[44:38] somewhere but he's got such a taste for
[44:40] the world that he cannot take the
[44:44] correct filter he has to have his onade
[44:48] filter each one making their own kind of
[44:51] filter each cigarette company Rags on
[44:54] theirs what they can do a real filter
[44:57] this is the best filter all up front and
[44:59] all like that I said The Taste comes or
[45:02] something from
[45:04] upfront oh for goodness sake up front
[45:08] what's on the back end of it oh sure
[45:11] ain't a thinking
[45:12] man or a thinking woman but that's what
[45:16] they say just simply deceiving the
[45:19] people now we find out of our day that
[45:22] the people has got a
[45:25] taste and why do do a man smoke a
[45:28] cigarette is to satisfy a
[45:32] taste what does a woman smoke a
[45:34] cigarette for satisfy a
[45:38] taste and then if the
[45:41] church has figuring out a religious
[45:44] group they to get people in there
[45:46] they've got to have a certain kind of a
[45:48] filter to give the people the taste that
[45:51] they
[45:53] want so if they don't get any taste that
[45:56] they want they don't want the cigarette
[45:59] and if they can't get the taste that
[46:01] they want in religion they don't take
[46:04] the
[46:05] religion now just as plain as it can be
[46:09] women with shorts bobbed hair painted
[46:13] face is sexy
[46:14] dressed they want that they love that as
[46:19] I spoke this morning and uh last Sunday
[46:23] morning on that wheel in the middle of
[46:25] the wheel or that that little inside
[46:28] Soul on the inside of the spirit how
[46:31] that the spirit on the outside between
[46:34] the soul and the body can be absolutely
[46:37] Anointed with the Holy
[46:40] Ghost did you all understand
[46:43] that now that follow that in with the
[46:46] continuity of the message the God of
[46:48] this
[46:49] world the anointed ones in the last days
[46:53] that outside that middle circle first
[46:57] circle is the the human senses the
[47:00] second circle is the spirit senses will
[47:04] self- will desire and so forth but the
[47:09] inside is the
[47:12] soul that Soul was
[47:15] predestinated so they can't anoint this
[47:18] Spirit to make the outside body come in
[47:21] subject to the
[47:24] spirit but the soul that's sinth that
[47:27] Soul shall
[47:29] die the soul that rejects and unbelief
[47:33] the word of God which it is a part of
[47:36] that Soul shall eternally has
[47:41] always I believe in an eternal death
[47:45] same as I believe in an eternal heaven
[47:47] but not an eternal
[47:49] hell no such a thing is eternal hell
[47:52] amen there is an eternal death for the
[47:56] people that are many of them religious
[47:59] in the world today has always been
[48:04] dead the woman that liveth in pleasure
[48:07] with her bobbed hair and painted face is
[48:09] dead while she is alive the Bible said
[48:15] so see she may be religious but she
[48:19] never was saved she's got an outward
[48:22] motion she might sing in the choir or
[48:26] she might dance in the spirit she might
[48:28] speak in tongues and have all the
[48:31] manifestations of the spirit but unless
[48:34] that Soul on the
[48:36] inside is God's
[48:39] daughter see she's gone matter what she
[48:43] does Israel is all outwardly spiritually
[48:47] all filled with God's goodness and how
[48:50] they rever God and so forth but that
[48:53] didn't work the inside of them couldn't
[48:56] recognize the word
[49:00] itself but when you're born of the
[49:02] spirit of God then you've got to you are
[49:04] a son of God and you always was a Son of
[49:08] God and you always will be a Son of
[49:12] God no way to separate because it's you
[49:15] have eternal life and eternal never did
[49:19] begin neither will it ever
[49:23] end oh for the grace of of God that he'd
[49:28] give us understanding of such great
[49:30] Mysteries as Paul spoke here further on
[49:32] down in Ephesians speaking of the
[49:34] husband and wife and said this is a
[49:37] mystery how the women should be in
[49:40] respects to their husband even the
[49:42] second place I believe it is in the
[49:43] entire Bible that reverences ever spoke
[49:46] to said the women seeing she reverence
[49:49] her
[49:50] husband reverence her husband that a
[49:54] husband ought to live such a life before
[49:56] his wife his wife could reverence him as
[49:58] a Son of God and if he doesn't live that
[50:01] kind of life well then course she
[50:04] wouldn't reverence him because she knows
[50:05] what he's made of but when it is a man
[50:09] that is reverent man reverent clean with
[50:14] his wife and before his family a real
[50:17] servant of God and the women children
[50:20] all should respect that servant of God
[50:24] with a reverence no
[50:28] now women they want to have bobbed hair
[50:33] they want to wear shorts paint makeup
[50:36] these little bikinis and things that
[50:38] that they wear now they they want to do
[50:40] it and yet they want to go to
[50:43] church you see that
[50:46] anointing upon the
[50:48] spirit not upon the soul
[50:52] see say wants to be a Christian and also
[50:57] do these things and the pastor says it's
[51:01] okay then if he says it's okay you can
[51:04] be a member your name can be on my
[51:06] church book here it's okay then he's
[51:08] given her his denominational filter to
[51:12] suit a worldly woman's
[51:15] taste she loves the world she likes the
[51:18] taste of
[51:19] it so he's got a filter for her but
[51:23] she's a long ways to being a thinking
[51:25] woman
[51:29] but there you are that's where I found
[51:32] this text no she isn't a a thinking
[51:36] woman if she was thinking she'd know the
[51:39] church isn't going to judge her at the
[51:41] last days the church is judging her now
[51:45] by her membership her loyalty to the
[51:48] circles that she belongs to in the
[51:49] societies they're judging her now by
[51:52] that but God's going to judge her at the
[51:57] day so she isn't thinking just like the
[52:00] man that's smoking he loves the
[52:02] cigarettes so well until he's thinking
[52:04] faculties has become numbed with
[52:07] nicotine and the woman's desires has so
[52:11] numbed her thinking
[52:13] faculties until she'll do these things
[52:16] that's evil in the sight of the Lord
[52:19] because she wants to do it satisfies a
[52:21] worldly woman's taste so she takes a
[52:24] worldly Church's filter
[52:26] she goes right through it fine nothing
[52:29] to
[52:30] bother
[52:32] shows now we see that if that is trth
[52:36] the pastor says that's all right we
[52:38] don't condemn the women of doing that
[52:40] it's all right there's no sin in it
[52:43] that's through his filter shows that
[52:46] they went through a theological
[52:50] filter and they got a theological taste
[52:53] and they had a theological taste but it
[52:56] certainly didn't go through God's filter
[52:58] no sir now if there is a theological
[53:03] filter for the theological thinker and
[53:06] there is a church filter for the church
[53:08] thinker a cigarette filter for the
[53:11] cigarette thinker there's got to be a
[53:13] real filter somewhere for the real
[53:16] thinker and God has a
[53:20] filter and that's his
[53:22] word it's a separator parts the waters
[53:25] the separation for sin now that's the
[53:29] thinking man or the holy man's
[53:32] taste and if a man goes through this
[53:36] kind of a filter of the world he he's
[53:39] got a worldly taste and like the tobac
[53:42] of company he gets more members in his
[53:45] church by pushing through this filter
[53:48] every you say there's more women goes to
[53:50] church and there is man that's may be so
[53:55] that may be also true when she can go
[53:57] and do anything she wants to that's
[54:00] right she'll she'll join up with
[54:02] anything but she went through that
[54:04] church filter if she went through God's
[54:07] filter she'd come out different from
[54:08] that see she couldn't go through God's
[54:11] filter and come out with bob hair she
[54:14] just can't do
[54:15] it now this is going to be a a little
[54:18] bitter maybe to somebody but when she
[54:21] started through God's filter and it says
[54:23] in there for them not to cut their hair
[54:26] then
[54:28] what she lodges on the other side if he
[54:32] said it's a sin for a woman to do such
[54:34] and she's dishonorable to do
[54:37] such if she wants she say well she's got
[54:39] to have her haircut so then shave it off
[54:41] in and said we know that that's a shame
[54:44] for a woman to have a head short said
[54:46] then let her have her head covered and
[54:48] her hair is her covering not a hat lady
[54:51] her hair is recovering the Bible says
[54:54] show she's a Nazarite unto the law
[54:58] long hair to a woman means a Naz right
[55:00] to the Lord now we find that that's true
[55:04] but we find if the thinking man socalled
[55:08] in the world can smoke and still get his
[55:11] taste he already have sense enough to
[55:13] know he's getting car from the
[55:16] tobacco but only what it's done is to
[55:18] selling more Mak him buy more
[55:20] cigarettes and the church filter gets
[55:23] the membership and things like that when
[55:25] they let him get through with anything
[55:27] and still belong to the church they get
[55:29] more members what if we went to the
[55:31] churches T night and filtered everybody
[55:33] out besides those who were genuine word
[55:35] born Christians there be many a blank
[55:38] sermon up against the wall
[55:42] tonight it's
[55:44] true because it went through the filter
[55:47] and if I've got one desire in my heart I
[55:50] hope that everybody listening to me has
[55:51] the same thing God take me through your
[55:53] filter as David said try improve me and
[55:57] Si or be evil in me then take it out
[56:01] Lord I want God's
[56:03] filter don't care what the world does
[56:05] what the church has I want to be a
[56:07] thinking man to think who I'm going to
[56:10] be standing by one of these days for
[56:12] judgment
[56:13] notice the tobacco company does it to
[56:16] sell more cigarettes the church does it
[56:18] to get more
[56:20] members a woman with short hair wearing
[56:24] shorts be caught in God filter she could
[56:27] not go through it with short hair
[56:29] because the Bible said she shouldn't do
[56:31] it she dishonors her head when she does
[56:33] it we should go but she goes right
[56:36] through the church all right all the
[56:39] rest of them I stand sometimes not
[56:43] disregarding anybody I never speak
[56:46] personally about any person but it's sin
[56:49] in the church you bear me record of that
[56:51] I didn't say Miss so and so is so and so
[56:53] Mr so and so Reverend so and so is so
[56:55] and so no sir I say Sin is Sin if it's
[56:59] in my family it's in me it's in whoever
[57:01] it is it's still
[57:02] sin not as an individual I don't speak
[57:05] against individuals I speak against sin
[57:09] I don't care if it's me or whoever it is
[57:11] starts through God's filter any sin will
[57:13] stop you right there notice but the
[57:17] woman who wants to have short hair and
[57:18] wear shorts or wear paint anything she
[57:20] can go right through a Pentecostal
[57:21] filter just as easy as th nothing about
[57:24] it right into death
[57:27] because he she said well there's no harm
[57:29] in that if you love the world are the
[57:31] things of the world it's because the
[57:34] love of God's not even in
[57:36] you down through the spirit thing she
[57:39] can pull down into her soul things that
[57:42] isn't of God and against God's word if
[57:45] that's a taste in the soul it can come
[57:48] through the tasty taste it can come
[57:50] through the think through the reasoning
[57:51] has no harm in it I I have taste I have
[57:55] feelings I have feeling that this is all
[57:57] right she'd come right on down through
[57:59] that and right into her soul if her soul
[58:02] is of that type shows that she isn't
[58:05] drawing through God
[58:06] filter but if she's got bobbed hair
[58:09] wearing makeup shorts pants looks like
[58:11] man's all these slacks andever what they
[58:13] call them saying those kind of things
[58:15] and doing those things and living for
[58:17] the world she'll stop she can't get to
[58:20] there no Sarah it'll stop her at the
[58:24] beginning notice
[58:26] a man looking at her pretty red lips and
[58:31] painted face and shorts and and bikinis
[58:35] and it what she's got a real thinking
[58:38] man won't look at
[58:42] her now a man that's a church member
[58:45] will look at her admire but I don't care
[58:49] how she looks to the eye a thinking man
[58:52] will turn his
[58:53] head why he's been through God F her and
[58:57] he knows to look upon her is adultery in
[58:59] his
[59:00] heart he don't think she's pretty say is
[59:04] it she a pretty thing not to him it
[59:06] isn't she's a filthy looking miserable
[59:09] Jezebel
[59:11] witch to a thinking
[59:13] man a Son of God looks up on her with
[59:16] shame that he even belongs to the family
[59:18] she belongs to that's right how could
[59:22] that be my sister and act like that see
[59:25] she pulled through one filer he comes to
[59:28] another he won't think she's pretty not
[59:31] at all that's not Beauty to a real man
[59:32] of God remember one time before the
[59:36] blood of Jesus Christ become the filters
[59:37] we'll get to in a few minutes the sons
[59:40] of God looked upon the daughters the man
[59:41] that they were fair and taken to them
[59:43] wives God never did forgive it again it
[59:47] happened in the march of Israel and God
[59:49] never did forgive and every one of them
[59:52] perished a thinking man's filter
[59:56] I come out of the meeting here there's a
[59:58] little Ricky standing back here behind
[59:59] the church one night said to me about
[1:00:01] three or four years ago said the reason
[1:00:03] you say that's you're an old
[1:00:06] man said I think they look nice I said I
[1:00:09] can imagine that for Mr looks of him you
[1:00:12] tell what he look like I said let me
[1:00:15] tell you something how old are you about
[1:00:17] 30 years old I said when I was 15 years
[1:00:21] younger than you I thought the same
[1:00:24] thing right is still
[1:00:29] filth a thinking man's
[1:00:33] filter now notice if he has been his
[1:00:37] mind filtered to the word of God God's
[1:00:40] filter he won't look up on her he won't
[1:00:43] think she's pretty he'll think she's a
[1:00:46] jezebel he'll think behind those red
[1:00:49] lips is poison things that was stain and
[1:00:53] the Bible said her Gates is the gates of
[1:00:55] hell and man walks into him like an ox
[1:00:57] going to his Slaughter there's a
[1:00:59] thinking
[1:01:00] man
[1:01:02] filter what do you
[1:01:05] desire when the woman comes down the
[1:01:07] street dressed like that and you man
[1:01:09] turn your head gaze around like that
[1:01:12] you're not using a thinking man's
[1:01:14] filter because when you do that you're
[1:01:17] committing
[1:01:19] adultery for the filter said whosoever
[1:01:21] lookth upon a woman to lust after her
[1:01:24] have committed adultery with her already
[1:01:27] turn your head thinking
[1:01:30] man get away from her she's not pretty
[1:01:33] she's a serpent it's right twists like
[1:01:37] one acts like one stings like one keep
[1:01:41] her away from
[1:01:43] her oh yes the word of God is the
[1:01:47] thinking man's filter anyone knows that
[1:01:51] that's what your soul is filtered
[1:01:52] through the word of God and it makes
[1:01:56] when you come to God when a thinking man
[1:01:59] comes to God's filter it gives him a
[1:02:02] holy man's
[1:02:04] taste right when you come through God's
[1:02:07] filter then your
[1:02:10] taste is a holy man's
[1:02:14] taste it makes a righteous man's taste
[1:02:18] the slogan certainly is okay now we find
[1:02:21] out how this is done in a
[1:02:24] type in is Isel for the congregation of
[1:02:28] Israel
[1:02:30] only that's reason speaking this now if
[1:02:33] ministers disagree on anything is said
[1:02:36] this is for my congregation that the
[1:02:39] Lord's given me to to preach to notice
[1:02:43] in Exodus 19 I want you to read it when
[1:02:45] you go home when you have more
[1:02:48] time notice when Israel had committed
[1:02:51] sin first they took a red heer which had
[1:02:54] never had a yoke on her neck that means
[1:02:57] she never was yolked up with
[1:03:00] anything and she had to be red the color
[1:03:04] red is a atonement color you know
[1:03:08] science knows that if you take red and
[1:03:10] look through red to Red is
[1:03:13] white look through red at Red is white
[1:03:16] he looks through the red blood of the
[1:03:18] Lord Jesus and our red sins become as
[1:03:20] white as snow red through red and the
[1:03:24] heer was killed in the evening time by
[1:03:27] the whole Congregation of Israel and
[1:03:29] there was put seven Stripes of her blood
[1:03:32] upon the door where the whole
[1:03:35] congregation had to enter a type of the
[1:03:37] seven Church ages by the
[1:03:40] blood and then her body was taken and
[1:03:44] burnt it was burnt with the hoof with a
[1:03:47] skin with the intestines with the dung
[1:03:50] everything was burnt together and it had
[1:03:52] to be picked up by a clean man
[1:03:58] and had to be put in a clean
[1:04:01] place outside the
[1:04:03] congregation therefore if
[1:04:07] Israel could only see the type this word
[1:04:11] of God must not be handled by dirty
[1:04:14] hands of
[1:04:16] unbelief it's got to be a clean man and
[1:04:19] if he's clean he had to come through
[1:04:21] God's
[1:04:23] filter amen a clean man
[1:04:26] Clean Hands and had to be kept in a
[1:04:29] clean
[1:04:30] place not a place where jezzy bells and
[1:04:33] Ricky and everything partake and take
[1:04:36] the communion and things when they're
[1:04:38] running around with wives and husbands
[1:04:40] and all kinds of
[1:04:41] Filth going to dances and parties and
[1:04:44] wearing bobbed hair and shorts and
[1:04:46] everything else and call themselves
[1:04:48] Christians it's to be kept in a clean
[1:04:51] place and handled with Clean Hands
[1:04:55] and then when Israel sinned and
[1:04:58] recognized that they had done wrong then
[1:05:01] they were sprinkled with these ashes of
[1:05:03] this heer upon them and that was a water
[1:05:07] of separation of purification for sin
[1:05:11] notice here it is and went Israel before
[1:05:15] they could come into Fellowship in the
[1:05:18] worship they had the first pass through
[1:05:21] the waters of
[1:05:23] Separation justification by Fai cometh
[1:05:26] by hearing hearing the word then they
[1:05:29] entered into the congregation under
[1:05:31] those seven Stripes of blood to show
[1:05:35] that something died and went before them
[1:05:36] for their sin they were separated by
[1:05:39] hearing the word the Waters of
[1:05:40] Separation then entered into
[1:05:43] Fellowship the only place that God met a
[1:05:46] man was behind that
[1:05:48] AR he wouldn't meet him anywhere else he
[1:05:51] had to come behind that AR God only met
[1:05:54] Israel in one place
[1:05:56] and God only meets you today in one
[1:05:58] place that's in Jesus
[1:06:02] Christ and he is the word the Waters of
[1:06:06] separation and his blood was shed for
[1:06:09] all seven Church ages and then by the
[1:06:11] Holy Spirit we enter into that
[1:06:14] Fellowship which is only given to the
[1:06:16] church oh how great he is also now we
[1:06:20] want to look at Ephesians 5:26 said it
[1:06:23] is the washing of the water by the
[1:06:26] word of waters of
[1:06:29] Separation what does it do then the
[1:06:32] filter of God is the
[1:06:35] word Waters of Separation washing of the
[1:06:39] Waters of Separation by the
[1:06:42] word God's filter then you can come into
[1:06:46] Christ through a church filter you
[1:06:49] cannot come by a denominational filter
[1:06:51] or a Creed filter there's only one
[1:06:54] filter that you can enter into that Holy
[1:06:56] place that's to the washing of the Water
[1:06:58] by the
[1:06:59] word the word of God is a thinking man's
[1:07:03] filter the church WIll judge you here
[1:07:05] whether you're a good member or not
[1:07:07] they'll give you a good funeral and half
[1:07:08] massive flag at your death sing great
[1:07:10] reath of flowers and and do everything
[1:07:12] for you but when it comes down to your
[1:07:14] soul facing God it's got to have eternal
[1:07:18] life and if it's an eternal life it's
[1:07:21] part of the word and as my own word
[1:07:24] cannot deny my my own hand cannot deny
[1:07:26] my hand my own eyes cannot deny my hand
[1:07:29] or my foot or my toe or any part of me
[1:07:33] it cannot deny and neither can a man
[1:07:36] that's part of the word of God or a
[1:07:38] woman deny one part of the word of God
[1:07:41] and women when you think you can to have
[1:07:43] Bob Harry come in the presence of God
[1:07:45] you're
[1:07:49] wrong you see it you're wrong you can't
[1:07:54] come through God's fil
[1:07:56] or you're Washed by the Water of the
[1:07:58] word amen then you enter into the
[1:08:00] fellowship you think you are but you
[1:08:03] can't be until you come through the word
[1:08:06] and every little spot every little word
[1:08:08] of God man shall not live by bread orone
[1:08:10] but by every word am it's got to come
[1:08:12] through that
[1:08:13] filteration coming through and that
[1:08:16] gives a righteous man's taste because
[1:08:18] that's what he's looking for looking for
[1:08:20] something to cleanse him the word the
[1:08:24] word of God is a thinking man's filter
[1:08:27] and it makes a righteous man's taste we
[1:08:29] know that true filters all the sin of
[1:08:32] unbelief
[1:08:34] out there's a little more disbelief when
[1:08:36] you come through the filter because it
[1:08:39] is a true believer's
[1:08:41] taste the True Believer wants to be
[1:08:44] right
[1:08:46] regardless you just don't want to say
[1:08:47] well I belong to social ranks I belong
[1:08:49] to church the biggest church in now I
[1:08:50] don't care if it's a mission on the
[1:08:52] corner if it's a brush Harbor somewhere
[1:08:55] a thinking man knows that he's got to
[1:08:57] meet God in regards to what the church
[1:09:00] says or anybody else says he's got to
[1:09:02] come on God's terms and God's terms is
[1:09:05] God's word well he say God's word sure
[1:09:08] all of them believe it's God's word but
[1:09:09] can you filter through it how you going
[1:09:11] let a bobhair woman come through there
[1:09:13] that's right how you going to do that
[1:09:15] how you going to let a man come through
[1:09:17] there that won't hold up for this
[1:09:19] Doctrine see it ain't a thinking man's
[1:09:23] taste no a thinking man think a thinking
[1:09:26] man will think twice before he jumps
[1:09:28] into something like that
[1:09:30] notice that word cannot deny itself then
[1:09:34] it is satisfied or it's a desire it's a
[1:09:37] desire of what what made you desire in
[1:09:40] the first place because down in your
[1:09:43] soul there was a predestinated
[1:09:47] seed which was eternal life always
[1:09:50] laying in
[1:09:52] there always was in there
[1:09:56] all that the father has given me will
[1:09:58] come to me there isn't any of them going
[1:10:00] to be
[1:10:13] lost thank God
[1:10:15] for word
[1:10:17] tonight that you enjoyed that portion of
[1:10:20] the word you know brother bam said that
[1:10:23] uh this word of God must not be handled
[1:10:26] by dirty hands of unbelief and it's the
[1:10:30] word that cleanses our hands so we thank
[1:10:32] God that his filter is his word and
[1:10:36] that's what we want to come through not
[1:10:39] our church filter not approval of men or
[1:10:42] women or some group we want God's word
[1:10:45] to approve us amen God bless each of you
[1:10:48] let's all stand to our feet we'll sing a
