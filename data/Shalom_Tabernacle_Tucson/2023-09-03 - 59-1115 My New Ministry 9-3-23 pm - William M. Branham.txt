amen we're going to listen to this message my new ministry a portion of it from paragraph number 26 to paragraph 200 that's pretty much the heart of the message and as I said before we don't break the message up with the intention of that you shouldn't listen to all of it but we're just using it for this service and um for this service those are the paragraphs we're going to listen to brother random we'll go into the scripture in Mark 11. we've been talking about it here at the church and it's nice to hear him talk and give that testimony for the first time amen and so let's sing only

all things are possible Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe Lord all things are possible Lord I bless you may be seated brother Branham may the Lord add the blessings as we read now in the book of Saint Mark the 11th chapter beginning with the first verse and then after you're just a little quotation or exhortation then I will go to our text this is reading for what I'm wanting to tell you and when they came I beg your part I want to get the tenth verse to save the time the 10th verse of the 11th chapter blessed be the kingdom of Our Father David that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked around upon all things and now evening tide must come and he went out into Bethany with his twelve and on the mara when they were come to Bethany he was hungered and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything there on and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet Jesus answered and said unto if no man eateth fruit all the Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it and they came to Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrowed the tables all the money changers and the seats of them that Soul does and would not suffer than any man should carry any vessel through the temple and he taught saying unto them it is is it not written my house shall be called of all Nations the House of Prayer but you made it again to thieves and the scribes and the chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all people were astonished at his Doctrine and when evening was come he went out of the city and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to remember said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou did cursed it is withered away Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those Saints which he saith shall come to pass ye shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them what a gracious promise and it is absolutely the truth this you know me or as I should use that expression for a long time how could that be and one time when I first started preaching here at the Tabernacle many years ago I run on to the word of hell and I run the reference to it many times then it referred to Hades in the Greek which meant the grave and I didn't know what to say because I do not want to be responsible for man's Souls at the day of the judgment so I searched it and searched until I found what was the truth for about four or five years I would not touch the subject of hell until I found what was truth about it and then this scripture stumped me even more because it was outstanding such a promise being made by none other than Jesus Christ and when he said to his disciples what things so ever you say you can have if Thou shalt say to this mountain be plucked up and removed into the sea and will not doubt in your heart but shall believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said oh if we could weigh those words you can have what you say not what I say but what you have said you can have what you said four years us lingered over that eye went to ever election commentary ever translation even to the due a version and every translator translates it the same you can have what you say so I know that if it's written in the scripture to me all scripture is truth and if I can't rightly divide it it's still the truth so I believe sometimes that God just lets us see things when it's time for us to see things he withholds these blessings like the blessings that we're enjoying today our forefathers did not enjoy those it wasn't season for them now I could remember when the Holy Spirit that night when I returned back to this same desk from the mill where I've been praying and told many of you people sitting here that he had charged me by his spirit amen a commission to all the world at the lame would walk in the blind but see and the Kings and monarchs would be calling for prayer and it would start a Revival among the Brethren that would sweep around the world before the coming of the Lord it was hard to believe that it was hard for me to believe it but that's what's happened it's just did that thing to today re Holy Ghost Revival fires are burning the world around India Africa Asia all into Europe and everywhere holy ghost man filled with the spirit is burning the world up with a Revival all the power of the Risen Christ name walk blind seed deaf hear dumb speak all kinds of marvelous Miracles are taking place because God promised it and God's promise is true and when I begin to ponder over this I could not but ask the one who was speaking to me I was insufficient not suppose God had to pick some little unconcerned illiterate person because in that eat God takes something that's nothing something that's been cast out that's what makes me love God's people so amen amen they cast them out as holy rollers are illegitimate people but that's when God's ready to pick him up then and do something with them and it pleases him that shows that he's God takes nothing and makes something out of it takes a sinner like me and makes a Christian the hand of God I question him of the ability and he told me that I was to pray for sick people and the commission was get the people to believe and be sincere then nothing would stand by the prayer many of you here remember that it's printed in literature across the world I question how could I do that when I had no education he said there will be two signs be given you as is given to Moses and one of them would be about Mike Moses hand he changed it from leprosy to healing and and then the same taken place about the putting my hand on the people and then how that that made itself manifest then he said you'll know the very secrets of their heart and uh I said that is why I'm here he said then he explained the scriptures to me and oh from that time the Bible become a new word to me Hallelujah I had a different look on it a different view of it something happened then a little later he said that if you'll be sincere stay humble keep away from money and stuff said then it'll just keep blessing you and you keep climbing now many times we look at men who climb up in great ranks like and get high names but sometimes that's not what God calls High you remember when John came preaching the Bible foretold that every Mountain would be brought low in every low place would be lifted up see and when it come you would think it would be coming out of heaven with fiery chariots but what was it but a poor man dressed in a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him and out on the banks of Jordan preaching on the Muddy Banks not even in the church but God called that great and when Jesus said to the disciples that there wasn't one Bond of a woman has greeted John the Baptist you take all the kings and David the prophet in all of his great Splendor in Solomon they didn't even touch John Hallelujah and yet he didn't even have a place to lay his hand so you don't have to be rich and mighty in this world to be great in the sight of God you only have to be humble in your heart God calls that greatness he that's great enough to Humble himself that's a great person that'll that'll take the blame for everything that'll humble himself that's greatness then we find that this what God Said then it was pronounced from the pulpit year the first time it done just exactly what it said it would do there come up the Pentecostal Church caught Revival and today the Pentecostal church is the fastest growing Church in all the world last year they registered that doesn't conclude us and and these out of the denominations one million five hundred thousand conversions last year which covered all the rest of protestantism put together in Catholicism too Catholicism only had I'll be 475 000 something like that converts around the world but penny cost money a million five hundred thousand [Music] God's making his church ready Man Of No Education low degrees rise up in the power anointing of the spirit go out without any education or anything and Proclaim The unsearchable Riches of Christ that's what's great in the sight of God and we noticed Stanton that all these things set fire and the Holy Spirit was true to his word after about five years of taking the People by the hand them one night in Queen cities in Regina in Canada a man walked across the platform and there ladies life just as open as it could be before the spirit that was discernment as he promised that's been around the world it's printed in many many languages prettier all around the world to all the world knows about it then the enemy come in and made fun of it and said it was mind reading and there was impersonations come of it and everything else but in the midst of all of it God moved right on just the same God stayed true to his loyal promise he will every time now we find later then one day I was going to a fishing down at Dale holler with some man Mr woods and his brother and they were Jehovah Witnesses and just had been converted and baptized into the faith and while we were fishing over against the bank I've told you the story many times there Mr wood said the banks would one of our trustees here now said about some old sister that used to feed them a slice of homemade bread and butter she belonged to the Church of God and said Lao to his brother we ought to go up and tell her that we got saved you know there's just certain things that we can say that takes a hope with the Holy Spirit just certain things that pleases him just right and when we say that thing now I want you to notice what you say if we can just find what to say your words judge you your words condemn you are your words will bless you and unconsciously Banks must have said the right thing for no more than he said that I was sitting in the back of the boat fishing with a flower line for a little bluegill fish to be to put on the line for bait before we run out of bait and I was catching these little fish and putting them in a bucket for the trotline Ayman Banks said that all of a sudden something struck me he said the right thing and the Holy Spirit spoke out and said thus saith the Lord you'll find in the next few hours there will be a resurrection of a little animal I thought it would be a kitten that I thought my little boy had squeezed too hard and squeezed the breath out of him and dropped him on the floor before we left I thought that's what it would be but to our surprise the next morning while we were sitting in the boat I know Banks is yeah guess Lao is now here banks are if you are allowed raise up your hands he comes down with us all the time um he was caught a fish with a one a long hook and he caught a little bluegill fish and he swallowed the hook all the way down and he took a hole the little fish instead of just taking the hook out of his mouth he was caught so deep till he just pulled it and he pulled the stomach and the intestines and the gills and all right out of his mouth I just threw it out on the water just a little fish like we had been fishing with night before to cut up a hundred of them or more Barbie and the little fellow quivered four or five times and tried to work his little mouth but he couldn't because he's filled up with gills and so forth and Lao said you shut your lace one little fella well I went ahead fishing thinking nothing about it then God does saying so strange all of a sudden I've felt there coming something down over the top of them Woods the Holy Spirit moved down and said stand up said speak to that little fish and it shall have its life again it had been laying there dead for a half hour done floated back into the weeds I said little tishy I can give you your life in the name of the Lord Jesus that little fish turned over flipped up and well to the water just as hard as he could go they're not knowing what to do brother bankswood said it's good for us to be here and law said that meant me because I said that thing to him you've shot your last one little fella and he got all excited I said no it isn't I was trying to console loud I said that isn't so and then the scripture came to me again everybody I had at least a hundred little children on the list to pray for many people with leukemian cancer and tuberclear being eat up blind and deaf and dumb there's page after page at my house full of them and it looks like that a merciful god would have graded that instead of using his power on a low insignificant fish but he remains God why didn't he use his power on the lepers at the gate instead of the little fig tree what is it to do God wants to show that he's concerned he knows all things he's got over the Fig Tree he's God over the fish he's got over creation he's God over all things and there's nothing too little or too insignificant but what he's interested in [Music] so that would give us to know though we belittle and insignificant God's interested in us doing something for him he likes to display his glory and that stuck with me so hard that I could hardly rest day and night that's been two years ago and constantly it is haunted at me and I'd say oh I just can't say nothing about it for I can't place it in the atonement whatsoever you saying it shall come to pass you can have what you say now I've stood here at the same pulpit and tried and wrote on the scripture and refrained from it didn't go back because I was afraid to use it you cannot have faith unless you know what you're doing some fellow come to me not long ago and he said brother Branham do you think it's wrong for a Christian to smoke tobacco and I said what are you asking me for if there's a question in your mind leave it alone don't never you can't have faithless you're perfectly sure that you're right amen when all Shadows are drifted away then you can have faith and confidence and I could not walk out there and preach that scripture not knowing what I was talking about but yet I knew it was of the Lord many of you people bear me a record that far last two years you've constantly heard me from this platform say that there's something something somewhere yeah I'm reaching I know it's close to him I just can't seem to grasp it I'll say I hit a scripture there I don't know what to do because scriptures oh you might put an interpretation if someone would have asked me I'd said something to them and walked away and turned it off on something else but to face the issue just like we've got to face the issue is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right or wrong we've got to face the issue is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is it right or wrong we got to face it ever we must know that God's word is always true so on it when and up and down and I'd get it in my mind and I just couldn't get it away never where I'd go it would constantly come to me if you say to this mountain be thou plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but shall believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you have said although how can it be Lord that would be me saying it I would it wouldn't do no good for it would be me saying it so I can't say nothing but what you said and I I just say that but the scriptures and all things rested in the atonement thus no blessings outside of the atonement because we are sinners outside of the atonement if it was just a universal thing for everybody then everybody would be saved but it's your attitude towards the blessings of the atonement that brings the blessings to you like salvation as far as God was concerned I was saved when Jesus died but it will never do me no good until it's revealed to me that he's the son of God and I've accepted him as my savior and every scripture is the same way Divine healings for you if God will reveal that to you that that's for you but you can't just stumble at it it's got to come by revelation and when it's revealed that bias types you were healed there's nothing Satan can even do as our young brother from Sellersburg said all the Devils couldn't move it sure once something is revealed notice then in this ice fall many has said to me why is it every morning you when you're home you grab your rifle and take out to the woods to hunt I want you to know that he's God of the woods just the same as his god of the city just as much God out there as he is here God always deal with man according to their capacity and what like David by The Still Waters and Green Pastures because he was a shepherd and different ways he has revealing and something I'd get up of a morning to go out to the Woods real early around four o'clock this girl hunting my wife even said to me she said Billy don't you never get tired of going hunting see this battle is one alone my wife doesn't understand it I don't understand it but it's a fight you have to stand alone nobody can stand with you just room for you and Jesus [Music] misunderstood sure even to my little girl there Rebecca she said if I ever marry a man if he even mentions going hunting I'll not married I said I know what my mother's been through husband out and gone the meetings as soon as he comes home grabs an old rifle or a fishing pole and hits to the woods I said would you rather he'd do that or would you rather he'd grab a deck of cards or or some blonde and take off not just draw your opinion when I come back that day she said Daddy I apologize for that I'm gonna marry a man like you that likes to hunt that I'm gonna hunt with him she said I'll go out with him I said well that's all right too I wish you could talk to your mother a little bit about it but it's something in the woods when I first learned of God I wanted to repent I didn't know how to repent I didn't know how to talk to him so I sat down and wrote him a letter and asked him to forgive me and I didn't know how to do it so I noted I'd felt something out in the woods and I packed it on a tree so when he come down through the woods in the place I had saw him and he could read this and would understand what I meant and I was shy I hadn't served him and I wanted to forgive me my sins then I got a shame to myself and took it I said if he's a man he'll understand as a man he's my creator and I got down in the shed and began to speak to him like a man and he answered me back like a man then it was on the I've got some dates set down here on October the 12th on the 15th deer season was opening over in Wyoming on the 12th was the last day I could hunt and we were going to leave on the 12th I mean on the 10th it was in the woods which was a Saturday Sunday I preached which was 11th on Monday for the southmen and brother Roberson back there and all of us we left for for the meeting for the deer hunting over in Wyoming on that morning of the 10th which would be then on the 18th the season would close in Indiana we would have no more squirrel hunting so I said this will be the last time I can go out and we gathered a bunch together and US straight them around the woods I went way back up into a place where I love to go at Salem season was late squirrels were few I've been out several times just getting one squirrel at a time so this morning I made my way to the same woods and a wind rose and they'll begin to blow in anyone who hunts knows that's a bad morning I hunted all the woods through without seeing one squirrel or hearing one I went down into a creek bottom and started up to find another little scope of woods and as I drew near this little wood there was a a lot of walnut trees and Locust trees the leaves all off of Mr bear Thicket along the side of two sycamore trees now squirrels don't hang around sycamores but right up from it I seen look like a cup the glitz I'll caught the glitz of a squirrel going up through the woods but he was running fast oh I said there's no need of hunting here's people out here the farmers picking their corn right around this little woods the squirrels would not be here so I sit down between the two trees and prop a feet up on one and lean back against the other to warm sunshine I'll go I'll just take a little nap then I'll get brother Banks and brother softman and the boys as I go back and down the road pardon me as a sit there under the tree just got snug down in a warm sun shining on me something said you you say to this mountain be thou plucked up and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in your heart but believe that those things that you've said will come to pass you can have what you said I said well now there's that scripture in my mind again I said I've got a while you're about an hour before I have to go get the rest of the boys so I'll just study that scripture and I said now how could that apply I said here's the only way it could have been that those disciples live the other side of the atonement the atonement was later about it or several weeks later before the atonement was made Jesus gave them power the other side of the atonement like he did the prophets and when I said Prophets something struck me again what was the prophets then I begin to think of it about what he did with the prophets and it got after I was speaking there for a while inside myself just thinking till I become so conscious of something here until I was talking to someone and something said to me that's in the atonement or if a man or a woman is so consecrated and surrendered to God that God just moves in and uses their voice man and it isn't the man speaking it's God that's in him speaking I thought that's right something said to me who do you think how do you see those Visions on the platform how do you see those Visions out here what is it do you think it's your own wisdom that you could predict something that would happen every time to the letter you think it's you speaking would you think sometime when the Holy Spirit gets into a message and you don't know what to say what is it speaking then what is it when a man will speak with a tongue that he doesn't know nothing about it what is it that will interpret that same tongue neither one of them knowing anything about it is it the individual or is it the spirit of the Living God I said that is true I see it it's God that's speaking in all the church needs is a step closer to him I'm more of a consecrated life to live with him and while I was sitting there just for a moment or two thinking on this I caught myself talking to someone and I heard something say X say what you will and it shall come to pass I said what are you I said who am I talking to who are you who's steady hear these bushes that I can hear that voice talking to me who are you speak out to me I got all excited and jumped up from the dream those trees I said speak to me who are you I can't see here I'll look for that light there I could see nothing I screamed out who are you who are you what you want with me Lord where are you something moved back and say say what you will be given to you I said Lord are you changing my Ministry is this the change you've been speaking of is this what it's coming to is this what it'll be something in that little house that I saw in the vision is this hidden just stand a real deep Sweden daunting of the Holy Spirit raise me like off of my feet and said say what you will and it shall be given unto you amen they're amazed it left me I had nothing although what could I say there's no sick people here there's nothing here I'm in the woods what could I say what what could I do and I thought am I losing my mind have I studied so hard till I'm my mental powers are cracking up and just stand I heard it just the same as you hear me said aren't you hunting and you have no game said speak anything that you wish well I thought this God said prove all things I said Lord God if that be you and this is a sign that you're fixing to change my Ministry from those Visions to something greater of the farce along I said let it come to pass it you'll answer my prayer and I'll stood there a little bit and I thought what did he say he didn't say pray he said say what you will you're sad and your words will materialize say to this mountain and it'll do just as you say so I'll put my shoulder against the tree and I'm used to got my rifle set for 50 yards to drive tax so I I looked around to see a tree at 50 yards and the one who was 50 yards away out out of the leaves I said it's almost total impossible for a squirrel to come to that tree Roger them Farmers there picking their corn I said but there will be a red squirrel come out on the end of that limb and sit down there I'll shoot him from here no more and I'd said it there was a squirrel I trembled a little and labeled down and shot the squirrel walked over and picked it up I was shaking all over I said maybe that just happened that way you know how people can doubt but you want to be sure don't do nothing unless you're positive and then you know what you're doing and I'll rub my face a little and I'll look perfectly I shop so I went up sit down on the side of the hill and I said Lord it is written in your word not the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established I said if that was you forgive me and my stupidness but I pray thee to give me another squirrel like that and I said then I'll believe you that it's you and the devil won't have any room to say that it just happened that way so I sit down just in a moment here come that I call it super anointing swept over again and I have a almost all of my feet and say say what you will and it shall be given you I'll look through the woods until I found another tree some 50 yards away had a lot of brush in it and grapevines and things wrapped around where squirrels sell them ever take a tree like that I said there shall be another young fox squirrel sitting right there and on top of my finger down and looked around through the woods and looked back and there said the fox squirrel looking right at me again amen I shot that one picked him up I thought oh I was trembling I thought thank the Great Mighty God Of Heaven is here in the woods and he's confirming to me in my own way hunting here that he's going to do just exactly what he told me 15 years ago am I watched it a little bit I said Lord it shall happen again he said speak the place where it'll be make this radical I said that old snag sticking out there for the side of the field Bears slick and white I said there shall come another red squirrel and he'll go out on the end of that snag and look out over the field at the farmers that'll be that way I look back and there was no squirrel there I looked for about five minutes there was still no squirrel I said well I said two two squirrels is fine I said choose a witness I'll leave it like that and something said but you said there would be one I waited another five minutes nothing and it kept quoting in my heart you said there'd be one I waited and waited something said are you doubting I said not one bit I know no more and said that to out that limb went the red squirrel stood and looked at the farmers got my job standing here I shot the squirrel went over and picked him up and walked to the woods till I was way hours to pass picking the boys up to see if there'd even be one more anywhere and there wasn't then I come home and told you about it and then on November the 7th I was down in Kentucky I was with brother Woods's brother-in-law standing there Charlie Cox then they're at the pilaster and with brother Tony zabel one of the deacons here in the church are you here Tony uh he's here somewhere brother Tony is able and also brother Banks Woods and we were up in the mountains hunting and I started into the woods and squirrels were very scarce no the leaves deep on the ground and I started up into the woods and something said to me how many squirrels do you want this morning I said well I've got 114 this year 117 I said if I had three more make 120 that would make just the even number to stop on now I said another thing it would be give me six to take home which I love them better than any meat there is to eat and I said if I could just get three more I walked on up through the woods a little farther and all there was none good Hunters like Charlie and them got one and I said well I something said say to it beat the Three Squirrels and you'll have it I said that's happened once so I stood by this I have a little tree late in the afternoon on the side of a ridge and that anointing comes so great that I could hardly stand on the ground it said speak what you say don't doubt you can have what you've said uh and I said I shall get three squirrels he said where will they come from I said one will come from that way one from that way and one back this way make it radical God don't care how radically it seems he's God of circumstance and while I stood there for about a few minutes I could hear no shooting around the rest of the boys around anywhere I happen to look to my back way up in the woods about 90 yards I thought something was on a stump I watched it I just jumped off and it was a gray squirrel so far all the way across the Hollard up on top of the ridge when I come along with the silent tree I shot it at about 90 yards and it killed it I said there's one I might as well turn and look this other way for the others because they're coming see God has a way of bringing things to you making you sure what you're talking about that anointing is all for me then well I waited watch this away for about an hour nothing happened I was getting cold and I thought surely if that is the holy spirit that's telling me those things it will be just exactly because when the anointing was on me I spoke that word it'll have to be that way now listen real close to this and this is going to be a tape recording it'll go all over the world now and then to my left I kept watching after a while I looked up on a tree coming around the beach tree there come a Grace for us it tests exactly that way that's right Lord I'll turn down raised up the shooting and there come another squirrel I said there's two just exactly make my three now raise them shout the first squirrel the other one run under a log I could see him cutting on a hickory nut or something under the law a log is about that high at the end where he's up out the foot I could see the squirrel I'll kill the first one I said now I'll get the other one now level down put those crosshairs right over his ear not over 40 50 yards away and shot and hit the log and the squirrel never even got excited I put another bullet in it and he turned around went down the law and went the other end well I leveled down and tucked the best aim I could and I'd only miss five shots all year so then I level down right perfect shot and touch the trigger again and I hit about four inches above him I said I must have knocked my scope out and then I watched again the squirrel run up and went right out in the solid woods broadsided from me well I said I knocked the scope out I was just shooting broadsided then in the chest cavity and I raised up and put the Crosshair and I thought maybe I've got cold and shaken I thought it wasn't cold shaking when I shot the other one so then just the same about a minute or two apart and I got a hold of a bush and put it in my hand and helped the gun real tight and put it on the chest cavity the squirrel and pull the gun off and I shot a foot under him and our Pole to get another shell and our gun was empty while I was loading I said I'll get him if he'll stand there and when I got score went on up through the woods I stood there at the what there's three shops straight missed and I've only missed five out of 114 I said how could it be that uh my gun would be out and just then it comes to me you can't shoot that squirrel that way he was come from that way talk word is perfect couldn't shoot him from the south he's coming from the north well I said I'll just turn around this way then and watch North till he comes I put more shells in the gun and watched the little I said if he comes he'll have to be awful close I don't like to shoot one close that is a sport this is nice to do it so one was the thicker there I said well I'll have to get this one from the north because I said that way so I stood this way watching now I said I just got late I said a quarter to four not four o'clock I'll have to leave because with them too because the boys are waiting for me and so I waited a little while four o'clock came three minutes after four I said well I'll go get my squirrels I went up and got the squirrels and come back so dark I could hardly see in the holler I started down the holler and as it's going down the holler it's dark and I'm going to pass the place where I've been standing something said to me aren't you going to go up there and get that squirrel I said how could I see him now with a little telescope site little bitty fine Target scope hardly enough life to see a few feet in front of you I said how could I see it said but you said that there would be another one oh I wish I could just make that somehow I could get see what that yeah that what that really means friend see under that anointing it wasn't me that said it it was God that said it and I walked a couple of steps said turn and go back towards the North your squirrel's there I went turned I said Lord God I walked out a bit I started walking back towards an earth how are those setting your noses started walking back towards the North and way up on the ridge 50 or 60 yards away a squirrel run up the tree just enough light that I could see him I'll search with my scope all up and down the tree no score locking fine that's why I thought I seen a knot on the tree way up there so dark I said well I'll try that anyhow and I'll shop and when I did a squirrel run around the tree and run down I heard it hit the ground I thought it jumped off same time that happened about 20 feet from it one run up a white oak I said he run down one and run up the other one now surely Lord you won't let me miss him after you've already said under that anointing and this would be and you're confirming my Ministry this will be six times that you confirmed it to me at number of man six times I said you won't let me miss him I'll look all up and down the tree way up and now I thought I seen some leaves I've seen something moving in it I raised and shot and the squirrel dropped to the ground Stone dead up the hill I went rejoicing and happy I went to the first tree over to my left and there laid the squirrel well I said I know I got that one but I wasn't sure of this one I said then Lord you give me one for a good measure I goes over to find the other squirrel he wasn't there and I looked and I looked and I searched under leaves and raised up little pieces of Chunk and tore open an Old Log and it wasn't but one log Lane of then 30 yards and I tore it all the pieces looked around the sides and held my hand in the leaves and felt there was no squirrel there nowhere on up there's a big old snag on top of the hill I went up that little snag this little bitty hole I felt in there and I thought I felt the squirrel raising up and down when I was I said well I can't get to him so in the morning I'll bring the boys back and get about to go tell him now I went down to brother Charlie stuff the hole up went out to brother Charlie and them and told him we went over their house that night for supper we was rejoicing in the presence of the Lord Edmond before going to bed brother Charlie there asked uh brother Tony zabel back there to lead in prayer now I don't say this to conflict Arthur hurt brother Tony he is one of the finest Christian gentlemen that I know of but just show you how the Lord works Tony in his prayer that night said Lord God let it be known to us that our brother is telling us the truth that tomorrow he'll find that squirrel in the stump that was I never said I'd find a squirrel in the stump under the anointing I said I shot the squirrel of course I couldn't get the squirrel because if I did that it made more than I'd said just exactly what I'd said or that anointing that's what God produced so I didn't say nothing about that see that's how a lot of times people say brother Branham said so and so when brother bran says anything they don't have nothing to do with it but when God says it that's eternally true but brother Tony didn't get it he said if that squirrel is there then we'll know our brothers told us the truth brother Woods brother Charlie all of them picked it up we said nothing I slept with brother Tony that night the next morning at the table we were talking about oh it was a horrible day and brother Tony said well there's one thing brother Brandon will probably get his out of the stump this morning out of the tree I said brother Tony I never said the squirrel was in there I said I could feel it when it raised up it would drop he said it'll be there it'll be right in the Stone we went on up and when I left the car I started to turn back again and say there's something wrong I better tell Tony now because if that squirrel isn't in that hole and that stump I'll come back with no squirrel at all then according to the way he prayed last night he'll still believe I told a lie I said God you know with my Bible up told the honest truth and God knows that's the truth is that just the truth and I went on something just drove me on and I went walking up through the woods hunting I kept thinking what if that squirrel isn't in there he gave me his hunting knife so I could cut the whole bigger reach in and get him and something said to me if it isn't there or if it isn't there what makes a difference I said he will he wouldn't believe me he prayed and said that if we find the squirrel you'll know what our brother has told us the truth and that right in the morning comes that just say the squirrel will be up there and you'll get him I thought surely Lord surely this would be seven times straight all this in the morning's the homie I said is that you said say what you will I said I shall find that squirrel the anointing left me a hundred until 9 30 what we're supposed to do coming down go get some dogs and they thought they were and I went on up the hill at 9 30. looked in the hole felt around cut there was no squirrel there at all in the hole I felt all around now what I was picking up his little fine Grassroots or roots of trees I was picking up feeling fall off the stick want to run the stick in and pull it up like that I thought it's picking up the squirrel is sliding off the stick but his little roots and things no squirrel in there I thought now what will I do I said here it is 9 30 I've got to go back I picked up a rifle starved down the hill and something said did not did not you say you'd find the squirrel I said where would I find him God being my son judge with his word here now I'm a man of 50 years old a preacher of the Gospel standing in this Pulpit something said look under that little piece of bark I said Lord I wouldn't doubt you for nothing I walked over and picked up the bar and there was no squirrel there just before I did it some said what if he isn't there I said oh he'll be there I picked it up there's no squirrel there I'll look down with amazement I saw a little bitty piece of gray sticking out from under a leaf I pull it up and there laid the squirrel making it just exactly right what he had said to do down the hill I went and told him about it and we rejoiced and when I come to the car Charlie's standing right there Banks they were talking wasn't that strange that Tony would say a thing like that in his prayer as well as he loves brother Branham and why would he doubt his word and say that see he just had to say it that way but God knew it I'd stand in the Pulpit this morning and claim the same thing you've got to watch what man says and then what God says what God says is true then I thought well praise be to God I went down we had a great time come home brother George Wright for years has made the communion wine found closing as May the communion wine for the church brother Roy Roberson back there call me and said brother Branham let's go down and get the communion wine from Brother Wright which is sitting here him and his family now listen to this post as we close oh God we got to brother rights early in the morning and as usual a big welcome out and we 've talked about the wine and then little Edith the little crippled girls sitting there which I've loved like we do here at this tabernac I only need but this Tabernacle like she was our own sister the Wright family's been the oldest family one of them with the Slaughters here Roy slaughtering them in the right sir Mrs Spencer them are the among the oldest that's been in the Tabernacle I think the rights has been come here for some 25 or 26 years I pray that I prayed for that little girl I prayed to see God healer and I've seen afflictions even greater than hers healed and I've fasted and I've prayed and I've longed and I've sought the Lord with tears for the healing of that little girl poor little pillar was afflicted when she was just an infant perhaps infantile paralysis let's draw her little hands and feet she suffered for many years and when we prayed the first time for her she stopped suffering that's a year 26 years ago once she gets a stomach acre of a toothache just as soon as they go to pray for I know the Lord's going to take it but that Affliction and I've seen her sit here in the building when other cripples that get up and walk away and afflictions and so forth and water why don't that little girl walk Lord appear over her let the angel of Light overshadow the child so I can speak thus saith the Lord if it was up to me I'd speak it but it ain't up to me it's up to him am I and I watched it and we were come back she wanted a rabbit brother woods and I went out and killed two rabbits brought them back for her she had dinner ready Mrs writing them and during that time sister Hattie Mosier she just lost her husband I married the couple some years ago they got two fine children and brother watt was killed his own boy found him under his tractor mashed to death and the little boy had a break and something happened to him brother Woods I went out and went out and stayed Into the Night or his mother and Uncle were staying with him and the Lord let him be well and setting present this morning mother was interested in him that teenage just began to get out with the world 15 years old or something his little brother coming on 12 13 years old sister Hattie right all of you know we call her a writer named Moser but she's been a loyal person a little old Housewife lives in two rooms away back up into the Hills out there with a shovel and a hole trying to hold the cockle birds out of the Corn Patch to keep her little family together work Faithfully when I was setting at the table eating dinner I've been explaining what faith was I said your face like this if I see a vision of brother Shelby setting so and so on each one the way there was and sister had he was sitting way back out toward another room she didn't have much to say never does and then while we were talking I said the Lord showed me a vision that something was to take place then I would could say it that's what raises my faith I said when the Lord shows me what will take place then I've Got Confidence since you'll be that way when he showed now I said I'd come right here if that little Afflicted girl sitting there in the Lord show me she's going to be healed I'd come around here and stand in the track see if everything was just exactly the way he said and then say thus saith the Lord he just rise up and walk I said you'd see those little legs unfolding them little hands unfold and she'd get up from there and walk to the glory of God I said if it would come like that I've been telling about this experience and I said do you know I want to ask you something brother Banks were just sitting next to him at the table and next set the then sister had he was sitting way back and the boys just sitting here and Mrs Wright and Mr Right and Shelby setting back to my left oh listen don't miss this show you the sovereignty of God and while we were talking I said I want to ask you something what put those squirrels there there's no squirrels in the woods at a hundred and hundred and I I'm not the best of Hunter but I wanted since I was a little boy and I'd hunted close then and they were in the most ridiculous place and then the most ridiculous way I could call him I said what put them there I said I wonder if it is that my Ministry fixing to take a change that the god of Abraham is confirming his promise as he did to Abraham when he's up on top of the mount and he needed a sacrifice for it instead of his son Jehovah Jireh performed a miracle and placed the ram a hundred miles back his three days journey in any ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day then he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain far oh and then went to the mountain and went up on top of the mountain wild Ram back in there sheep wild animals would have killed it I'm not up on top of the mountain where there's no water how did that Ram get up there what happened God needed a sacrifice to prove to Abraham that he was Jehovah Jireh the very God of creation spoke or ran into existence I wasn't a vision he killed the RAM and blood came out of that animal it wasn't Vision it was a ram I said that same God Hallelujah that Jehovah just as much Jehovah Jireh today as he was on the mouth with Abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory these squirrels are not a vision I'll shot them blood came out of them I'd dress them and eat them they wasn't Visions they were squirrels I said that same Jehovah Jireh trying to get his promise over to me my thickness and tell us to mine he could speak my need into existence as same as he could speak Abraham's need into existence odd no more he said that until sister had is sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth she said the right thing she said just like Bank said down there I heard her voice as a sweat from my ears like up into the woods Mrs Wright sitting back there with her little girl was trying to interpret what he just said it I couldn't hear him that's right and that's super anointing strip over me said tell Hattie that she's found Grace in the sight of God who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will then you speak it by this gift into existence whatever she asked him to speak it into existence I'll look to Sister Hattie the first time it was ever performed on a human being I said sister Hattie ask what you will God's gonna give it to you what do you think of that does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is God's complete number here's the first time on a human being any what did he choose some great risk to crack a great noted Minister a poor little woman who can hardly write her name God knows what he's doing said ask what you will had he said to me brother Branham what do you mean I said ask anything your heart desires and it shall be produced right here that you'll know that the Lord God of Heaven's answers any scriptures are true the first time with the new gift a first anointing I could hardly hear and she looked around we've been talking about her little crippled sister I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith of me jump into the glory of God had he looked around all around and she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys what up why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for ten thousand dollars she'd have got it what if there had been some millionaire would have asked for another million God no one watches go to ask for sister I had to at least a seven or eight Witnesses standing there all you people that was present when that happened raise up your hand everybody in the building was present that happened one two three four five six seven seven of them eight of them eight of them was present when that happened I said ask anything you want to cause God's give it to me to give to you whatever you want she said her voice is beginning to go off on the teenage tantrum and she said the salvation of my two boys I said Baha the will of God follow the power of God I'd give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire and her two boys shook under the power of God and that old building trembled Banks fell into his plate shall be grabbed and had he screamed you could hear her for two blocks and them two boys with tears rolling down their cheeks received exactly what they asked oh the first time it was ever used on a human being f her boy sitting there with her this morning why would she have asked what if she'd asked the healing of her little sister what I should ask then the little girl would have been healed but her two boys lost what if that poor Widow who just told me that she tried to give to this church fifty dollars on a pledge to help build a new church and brother Roberson wouldn't take it and only let her give 20 of it I said to myself when she's speaking I'll give her back to 20 but God said to me in my heart now an above Vision in my heart when Jesus was standing watching a widow putting three pennies or there was thousands of dollars laying what would you have done I said well if I've been standing up said we don't need it sister we got plenty of money but Jesus never said it he let her go on and do it because he know what was down the road so help me God as my sovereign judge God knew that was down the road for her and I've run my hand in my pocket to get my pocketbook to give her her twenty dollars back say sister Hattie but he said don't do it then a few minutes from the questions part about Jehovah Jireh she said that's nothing but the truth and it come from a poor widow woman's heart and Hallelujah God knowing she'd ask the greatest thing could be done as long as there is the heaven when the stars is gone when there's no more moon no more Earth no more sea them boys shall live on through eternity with the same Jehovah Jireh who gave the immortal promise his promises cannot fail looking forward for the coming of this meeting down here in San Jose oh if it'll just break forth now when the anointing strikes s what you will I have a perfect assurance that will not strikes and whatever God puts to be asked it'll be just exactly that way it has to be far if you say to this my Sid isn't you speaking it isn't you it's God it's you so so submitted to God now watch the prophets of all when we're closing the prophets of old one day we're seeing the coming of the Lord Jesus they were so in the spirit until they spoke as if it was themselves look at David in the Psalms 22nd Psalm crying my God my God why has Thou forsaken me not David it was Christ 800 years later all my bones stare at me they shoot out their lips if they wiped their heads said he saved others but himself he cannot save David's speaking that as if it was himself but it was the spirit of God and he Christ speaking forth oh God be praised moving into his church in the fullness of his power moving among his people spreading out his great wings of Mercy may he be praised I haven't time for my sermon let us bow our heads just a moment in there how many can say praise the Lord we thank God for his
