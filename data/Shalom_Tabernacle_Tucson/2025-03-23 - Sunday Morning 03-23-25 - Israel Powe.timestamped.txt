[2:40] [Music]
[3:22] Good morning everyone. Can we all
[3:25] stand to see everybody Sunday
[3:29] school in
[3:31] prayer? Heavenly Father, Lord, we're
[3:34] coming to you once again, Lord, in need
[3:37] of a
[3:38] Lord, more of you, more of your word,
[3:41] Father, more of your spirit. Father, we
[3:43] pray that you just bless our time
[3:46] together now as we hear the preaching of
[3:49] your word, Father. May it just inspire
[3:52] us, Lord. bring us to a place, Father,
[3:55] that we would take action on everything
[3:56] we hear, Lord, that you'd bring us into
[4:00] the place of prayer, Lord, that we can
[4:03] just commune with
[4:04] you. Be with everyone that would be
[4:07] traveling and on the way, everything
[4:10] that would be done in this house of
[4:13] worship today, Father, the morning
[4:15] service, the evening service, the music
[4:18] practices, whatever it may be. We pray,
[4:21] Father, that someone would be led closer
[4:24] to you. Someone would be saved, healed,
[4:26] Father, or filled with thy spirit. And
[4:29] we'll give you all the praise and the
[4:31] glory for it in the name of Jesus
[4:35] Christ. We'll be continuing with the uh
[4:38] Pergamian church age. We'll be starting
[4:41] at paragraph 122 and we'll end after
[4:46] 154. Can we sing Only Believe together?
[4:52] Only
[4:55] believe.
[4:57] Only
[5:00] believe. All things are
[5:04] [Music]
[5:06] possible.
[5:08] Only
[5:11] believe.
[5:12] Only believe.
[5:17] Only
[5:21] believe all things are
[5:26] possible
[5:28] only
[5:29] [Music]
[5:40] beyond this country said what if Mr.
[5:43] Kennedy gets elected the Catholics to
[5:45] take over. Take over. They already did
[5:48] it long time ago and you didn't know
[5:50] nothing about it. Amen. Amen. Who pays
[5:52] your teachers? How do they get these
[5:54] things to go to their schools and
[5:55] teaching Catholicism right in their
[5:56] school and you taxpayers pay for it?
[5:58] Amen. Amen. Right under your nose. See,
[6:01] like that. Oh my. I have worked in the
[6:04] Bible said he'd take it by flatteries
[6:06] and he didn't. Amen. That's right.
[6:09] See, pay taxes on nothing.
[6:12] So, oh, so much could be said here. I
[6:15] just have to cut off them spots and go
[6:17] back again to pick up. In order to get
[6:20] this thing to working,
[6:23] Constantine set up a lot of um worldly
[6:29] entertainment to attract the attention
[6:32] of both pagan and Christians into the
[6:35] church.
[6:38] Are you spiritually minded? Amen. Are
[6:41] you thinking,
[6:43] "Isn't that the message of the hour?"
[6:47] The church has bunko games, parties,
[6:49] giveaway cars, and
[6:52] just to get them mixed together.
[6:56] Welding that power back together till
[6:58] they get a striking place.
[7:03] Just write your That's
[7:05] history. Someone has no no axe to grind.
[7:09] They're just quoting what happened. But
[7:12] he did it. Welded the church together by
[7:15] having worldly entertainments to bring
[7:19] together the nickelian church. Now
[7:22] remember, he could not touch that born
[7:25] again church.
[7:27] No sir, not any of them. But the farm
[7:30] old nickelian church fell for it. What
[7:34] do we have in our Protestant churches?
[7:36] soup, suppers, entertainment, skating
[7:38] home, rag sales, and everything
[7:41] else. Now, you know that's the truth.
[7:45] Well, now that if that is God's word,
[7:49] friends, it's the truth.
[7:52] And all Protestant churches are guilty.
[7:56] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[7:59] Now, never was God's plan to have soup
[8:04] suppers and dances and the basement and
[8:07] all that they're carrying on to pay off
[8:09] the pasture and the things. If people
[8:12] are just taught to pay their tithes,
[8:13] that would be all there'd be to it.
[8:15] That's God's
[8:17] plan. But God has a plan. But man wants
[8:20] to make his own plan. Hybrid God's plan.
[8:25] All right. Now in doing this they
[8:28] consolidated and made the early form the
[8:31] early Catholic church
[8:33] later. Then at the first great nine
[8:37] council when I read that I just fell on
[8:40] my
[8:41] knees. The great nyine council had taken
[8:44] place in AD
[8:47] 325. All of them was brought together.
[8:50] the bishops and fathers of the Christian
[8:55] faith was brought together at
[8:57] Nia. That's reason it's called the Nya
[9:01] council in AD
[9:04] 3:25 and about 1,500
[9:07] delegates came to the the the convention
[9:12] or the
[9:13] council about 1,500
[9:16] delegates and the
[9:18] leoty outnumbered the bishops 5 to
[9:24] one in the
[9:26] delegation. But yet through the
[9:29] Nicoladians, the
[9:32] co-farmals and Constantine's politician
[9:36] plan they
[9:40] outvoted the true
[9:42] church and won the victory and issued in
[9:47] bishops and holy order of man. Taken
[9:50] this the Holy Spirit from the meeting
[9:52] and placing it up on bishops, cardinals
[9:55] and popes and so forth.
[9:57] the same crooked deal that the Democrat
[10:00] party played in this last thing.
[10:05] Amen. Now, that's
[10:07] right. Now, we're not I the Republicans
[10:11] would be just as low down, but I'm
[10:13] talking about one thing that they prove
[10:16] Edgar Hoover in California and many
[10:18] other places. They had those vote
[10:20] machines placed to where you'd vote for
[10:22] Mr. Nixon, you had to vote for for Kenny
[10:24] at the same time. He didn't have a
[10:26] chance. Well, now that they've proved
[10:28] that wrong, then why don't they do
[10:30] something about it?
[10:33] Amen.
[10:34] We're living in the hour. That's it.
[10:38] We're at the end time.
[10:41] They know it. They prove that they were
[10:45] crooked. And now they won't do nothing
[10:47] about it. That was a crooked outfit back
[10:51] there. And here's the birth of it again.
[10:52] Amen. to get in a certain man to get
[10:56] over a certain doctrine.
[10:59] Nickelodeon doctrine, which was once
[11:01] just a a deeds, now it's become a
[11:04] doctrine.
[11:06] The days of Al Smith, it was a deeds,
[11:08] but now it's a doctrine.
[11:12] Now it's here. It's upon us. Oh, you
[11:16] make a Jim Dandy president. No doubt
[11:18] about that, mama. Certainly. For that
[11:21] next turn. Amen. Amen. Till they can get
[11:24] welded in. Amen. Get these pagan and
[11:28] Christian formals weld together. They're
[11:30] working on Bibles to try to bring it
[11:32] together. The popes, the cardinals, the
[11:34] archbishop
[11:36] of England, the archbishop of Cterbury.
[11:39] I met him shall talk to him myself when
[11:41] I was in England. Leagan's all come up
[11:44] almost to his hips and kind of a funny
[11:46] dress fella. But he went over to visit
[11:49] the pope the first time they visit for
[11:51] hundreds of years. Amen. What is it?
[11:54] We're at the last hour. Amen. That's why
[11:57] I'm standing here tonight instead of out
[11:59] here on the platform somewhere else
[12:01] trying to preach and pray for the sick.
[12:05] And I can't meet them all on the
[12:06] platforms these messages over and over.
[12:08] And that's the reason we're taking it on
[12:09] tape and sending it to the world.
[12:13] They might be warned and get back to the
[12:15] faith. Amen.
[12:17] Even at the last of the Christian age,
[12:19] Jude before the book of Revelations is
[12:21] written, St. Jude, supposed to be the
[12:23] brother, foster brother of Jesus,
[12:27] said, "I want you to earnestly contend
[12:30] for the faith that was once delivered to
[12:32] the saints." Amen. They begin to get
[12:35] away from it then at the death of the
[12:36] Lord
[12:37] Jesus. And now, how far is it away
[12:40] tonight? See now this first nine
[12:44] council and uh it was an 80 330 uh
[12:49] 325 about 1500 delegates and bishops
[12:52] attended the meeting but they overruled
[12:56] them in some foggy stormy council it was
[13:01] and they overruled them and voted in
[13:05] that the Nickelians took
[13:07] over and that was to take the all the
[13:13] church and put it under a
[13:15] supervision of popes or or bishops or
[13:20] something. Taken the power from the
[13:22] church and giving it over to the bishops
[13:25] that the bishop should rule a church and
[13:27] the only one that had anything to say
[13:29] about it. You notice in the Catholic
[13:31] church today, you can't read that Bible.
[13:33] That's not for you to interpret. That's
[13:35] the bishop. See where it come from? Now
[13:37] you can see what the Nickelians really
[13:39] was. Amen.
[13:41] Before it began to squeak and crawl, it
[13:43] was born right there. Amen. It's true.
[13:46] And it was a form of
[13:48] Christianity. Still is. Amen. Amen. And
[13:52] then the Protestant types right after
[13:54] the Bible, Revelation 17 said to the
[13:56] mother and the daughters. Amen. We'll
[13:59] get to it after a while, the Lord
[14:01] willing. Now, you notice it's the same
[14:05] today. They took over. Now,
[14:09] Constantine used Balum's
[14:13] strategy. Now, I want you to try to
[14:17] listen as close as you can. Now, he said
[14:19] here in the Bible here, "Hold fast my
[14:23] faith." Now, have a few things against
[14:26] thee because thou
[14:29] has thou because thou has their them,
[14:34] not these here, but there they have
[14:36] them. You have them in the in the Pergos
[14:41] church. See, holding the doctrine, the
[14:46] doctrine of Balum, who taught Bailo to
[14:48] cast a stumbling block before the
[14:50] children of Israel, to eat things
[14:53] sacrificed into idols, and to commit
[14:56] fornications.
[14:58] Now,
[14:59] Constantine used the same strategy that
[15:03] Balum did.
[15:06] They had a meeting after this council
[15:09] meeting here that the bishops was put
[15:11] over the churches and so forth to rule
[15:13] it and take all the power from the ley
[15:16] and they had no thinking of theelves
[15:17] neither they have any right to interpret
[15:19] the scriptures and it was all to the
[15:21] priests was to do the interpretation of
[15:23] the scriptures. Finally after a while
[15:25] they make a master priest and they a
[15:28] viker which was the pope but now they've
[15:31] come to the spot where they put all the
[15:34] the understanding belongs to the priest
[15:37] and the congregation don't have to read
[15:38] the bible they don't have to do nothing
[15:40] and frankly they the Bible's kept from
[15:42] them and now they they've taken it all
[15:46] over upon themselves and it was voted in
[15:48] thus because it looked good. It looked
[15:51] good because they was rich and so forth
[15:54] and he gave the at this great meeting
[15:57] when he called together
[16:00] Constantine gave the
[16:02] bishops nice buildings. He got a hold of
[16:06] some money and and all these big places
[16:09] of great like uh buildings. He gave
[16:12] these over to the church that they could
[16:16] use them as as church houses. Oh, they
[16:20] were nice buildings, all dressed up and
[16:23] so forth. So, he gave them over to the
[16:27] church. Besides that, he dressed up
[16:30] these bishops with great big robes and
[16:35] the underskirts and things under him.
[16:38] And besides that, he put them up on a
[16:41] build a high place like this and put
[16:45] them up on there like an idol. And down
[16:48] below them, he made marvel altars under
[16:52] them. And he did all this converting
[16:55] from the pagan idea over and bringing
[16:59] Christianity into it, but taking their
[17:01] bishop.
[17:04] See, they just took down the idol and
[17:06] put up the bishop. Amen. See? Amen.
[17:10] Making him an altar. The same thing in
[17:12] making him a god. put up the bishop and
[17:16] he had all say so dressed him all up and
[17:19] made him look like a god instead of
[17:22] putting him like they're pagan gods they
[17:24] put him on a robe like Jesus wore see
[17:27] and they made him just look like an idol
[17:30] sitting there oh you can imagine how the
[17:32] pagans said well I can go for
[17:35] that there's somebody can speak back to
[17:37] us we've been talking to an idol but
[17:40] this man can speak back to us how the
[17:42] Christians thought, "Well, that's just
[17:45] fine. Now, we can do anything we want to
[17:47] cuz there's our God. We can just we can
[17:49] talk to him. He can tell us back what to
[17:51] do. If we sin, we tell him about it.
[17:53] Give him a little something and a little
[17:55] do a little novena or something." And
[17:57] the first thing you know, we're all
[17:58] right. Go back out and feel free again.
[18:00] We don't have to worry about nothing.
[18:02] Oh, that looked good. Sure, it still
[18:06] does to the carnal mind. Amen. But
[18:08] you'll never poke that down a born again
[18:10] child of God.
[18:13] Hallelujah.
[18:14] Amen. Hallelujah. For he knows who he
[18:17] has believed and persuaded that he's
[18:20] able to keep that which is committed to
[18:22] him against that day. And forgetting the
[18:25] things that's in the past, we press
[18:27] towards the mark of the high calling.
[18:29] Hallelujah. Amen. In Christ. Amen. Oh,
[18:33] how thankful I am. Marble altar undering
[18:37] setting up here real dress to find
[18:39] church. Oh, how this all fixed up. All
[18:43] right. And this altar was overlaid, this
[18:47] marble altar, beautiful. Yeah. Same
[18:50] thing. Overlaid with gold and studded
[18:54] with
[18:55] gems, jewels in this altar.
[19:00] Beautiful, very fitting it was to the
[19:04] Nickelians and to the pagans. See what
[19:06] he did? He took the pagan
[19:10] ceremonies, the pagan ideas, and took
[19:15] Christianity, the cold farmers that
[19:17] didn't know better, didn't have the Holy
[19:19] Ghost to lead them different, and made
[19:20] him a god here on earth and made an
[19:23] altar for them and a god to sit there to
[19:26] forgive their sins. Are you spiritual?
[19:30] Do you understand what I mean?
[19:33] See what it is? a sin passing
[19:37] forgiveness on earth. I'm not quoting
[19:40] that from my mind. That's the history.
[19:44] Give you a page and number of the sacred
[19:46] history. The same as I can tell you
[19:48] George Washington and Abraham Lincoln
[19:50] and the Battle of Gettysburg and so
[19:53] forth. Amen. Sure. All those things are
[19:56] history I'm quoting here. Now, it was
[20:00] very fitting to not to this born again
[20:03] church. No sir. Well, when they put a
[20:07] man up there now to be a head
[20:11] bishop to uh recite ceremonies, of
[20:16] course that run the full gospel come out
[20:18] of it.
[20:20] It does yet today.
[20:23] Them ages are just carried over. Just
[20:25] slapped over. See, another form, another
[20:28] day. Oh, when they put a dignitary up
[20:31] there like a god and he'd have a few
[20:34] ceremonies said and notice that the
[20:37] pagans prayed to their dead ancestors
[20:42] and a Protestant church that would stand
[20:44] up and say, "I believe in the Holy Roman
[20:46] Catholic Church and the communion of
[20:48] saints." You Methodists, hide your face.
[20:51] Presbyterians and Luther,
[20:54] anything that intercedes with the dead
[20:56] is spiritualism.
[20:59] Sure. But now the Protestant can't laugh
[21:01] at the Catholic. He does the same thing.
[21:03] Makes us all sufficient confession that
[21:06] he believes the same name. Baptized
[21:08] right back into the Catholic church by
[21:11] his water baptism. Rejectingly making
[21:14] fun of people who try to live that
[21:16] right. Go to a church and see people
[21:19] shouting under the power of God and
[21:20] stand outside and make fun of it. Oh,
[21:23] see spirits don't die. People do, but
[21:25] not spirits. Amen. See, the Holy Spirit,
[21:29] it can't die. It was on Jesus. Now it's
[21:31] in his church. Always will be until he
[21:33] comes for his church because it's a part
[21:35] of him. See, the old persecutors, they
[21:38] they made fun of him back there in that
[21:40] day. They still live here today. God
[21:42] takes his man, but not his spirit off
[21:45] the earth. The devil takes his man, but
[21:48] never the spirit uh out of the earth.
[21:51] Those priests that sanctioned Jesus
[21:54] death that said he was a fortune teller
[21:56] or a devil, them fellas was religious as
[22:00] all religious could be. That's right.
[22:04] They know that scripture by letter, but
[22:06] they didn't know the true interpretation
[22:08] to it.
[22:10] They had their own idea and they
[22:12] wouldn't listen to nothing else. And
[22:15] then they seen him in no how could they
[22:17] fail to see that Jesus didn't qualify to
[22:20] everything every prophet ever said about
[22:22] him. Amen. But they were blind and God
[22:26] said he blinded their eyes for a purpose
[22:28] that we might have a chance for
[22:30] salvation. Amen. Now the Bible's
[22:33] predicted again that he'll that we are
[22:35] in this Pentecostal age is naked,
[22:40] miserable, blind, and don't know it.
[22:46] There's the condition of the church,
[22:48] Philadelphia. Oh, you formal Baptist,
[22:51] Presbyterians, and
[22:53] Pentecostals. See, there you are.
[22:56] Sometimes I don't mean that to you
[22:58] sitting here. I'm on a tape. You see, I
[22:59] know where it's
[23:01] going.
[23:04] Repent. Get back to the Bible. Get back
[23:07] to
[23:08] Christ. All right. But that's what
[23:11] taking place. The full gospel was pushed
[23:14] out. The signs and wonders in the church
[23:18] was dispelled. And when the Holy Spirit
[23:21] group was excommunicated from amongst
[23:23] the others, then they denied that there
[23:27] was a day of
[23:30] such and it was at that and they do the
[23:32] same thing today. It's exactly you see
[23:35] the spirit of it as I told you in the
[23:38] beginning. Put on your spiritual
[23:40] thinking.
[23:41] Let God open up your heart. Don't be
[23:45] prejudic. Sit and listen. Say, "Holy
[23:48] Spirit, reveal to me I sit." There it
[23:52] is. Ceremonies where Baptist,
[23:54] Presbyterian, even
[23:56] Pentecostals, it's become a religious
[23:58] ceremony.
[24:00] Only thing they do is beat on a piano
[24:02] something or jump up and down a while.
[24:03] As soon as the piano
[24:06] stopped, go out, cheat, steal, lie,
[24:08] everything else. But the real and enough
[24:11] temper to fight above us all. Talk about
[24:14] everybody and everything. See, there you
[24:17] are. Not only Methodist, Baptist,
[24:19] Presbyterian, Catholic, but Pentecostal
[24:21] church in the late age here. Oh, why
[24:25] don't you get back to that what your
[24:26] forefathers have? Why don't we come back
[24:29] to real Pentecost that sanctifies and
[24:32] fills with the Holy Spirit that brings
[24:34] Christ to us? That's what we need. All
[24:38] right. Now same today.
[24:42] Now the
[24:44] word Pergamus means
[24:48] married. The very word Pergamus means
[24:54] married.
[24:56] Christianity that is the Nickelodeon
[24:59] side the formal side
[25:02] married the to the state with pagan
[25:07] ceremonies.
[25:10] pagan ceremonies. And it was the birth
[25:13] of the Catholic
[25:17] Church. And that day
[25:43] [Music]
[27:38] [Music]
[28:04] Hallelujah.
[28:09] [Music]
[29:12] Hallelujah.
[29:15] [Music]
[31:56] [Music]
[32:18] You
[32:20] don't
[32:22] [Music]
[32:28] feel Heat.
[32:33] [Music]
[32:38] Heat. Heat.
[32:48] Heat. Heat.
[32:54] [Music]
[32:58] Heat. Heat.
[33:08] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[33:36] Heat.
[33:45] Heat. Heat.

[36:23] found it just listening to the first
[36:25] song. But we came to hear from him.
[36:27] We're not going to be disappointed this

[36:47] confess. So your name is
[36:50] awesome. In fact, it's awesome in this
[36:52] place because you're here and that's
[36:55] what makes it awesome. So, Father God,
[36:58] as a service begins today and we've
[37:00] heard the word of God just a moment ago,
[37:02] and we've been worshiping the Lord,
[37:04] hearing the music, and now we're here.

[52:56] time as the brothers come for the
[52:58] offering, the prayer
[52:59] request. Oh, there's a feeling, there's
[53:03] a feeling in the air that God is
[53:08] everywhere. Oh, it's that resurrection
[53:12] power that's moving in this hour that
[53:17] Jesus might be
[53:20] glorified. Give him a praise offering
[53:22] this morning.
[53:27] You say, "Praise the Lord this morning."
[53:29] You happy to be in church? Amen. A few
[53:32] of you are. How about the rest of you
[53:33] this morning? Just welcome our visitors.
[53:36] I want you to just feel right at home.
[53:38] We want you to be at home this morning.
[53:40] Y'all should be I don't see anybody that
[53:42] we'd necessarily call a visitor. Maybe
[53:44] brother Tom and Tommy, but they been
[53:46] part of our life so long. We just
[53:47] appreciate them this morning. for a
[53:49] Sunday school report. We had 13 children
[53:53] and 11 Bibles. No offering this morning.
[53:57] Did have a praise report from our
[53:58] precious sister Joy. She was starting to
[54:01] feel poorly on Thursday. Was on the
[54:02] phone with Kaden and Grandma Moore and
[54:05] they prayed for her and the intense pain
[54:07] was gone almost immediately. So, we're
[54:09] so thankful for that. Sister Joy and
[54:11] always want to acknowledge the Lord and
[54:13] always say and
[54:14] do. Just got a good day in the Lord
[54:17] ahead of us this morning. Remember
[54:18] brother Israel, he asked the deacons and
[54:20] the board to re to be be praying for an
[54:23] outpouring of the Holy Spirit. And we
[54:26] all want to pull and pray for that for
[54:27] him, for ourselves, for our lives, our
[54:30] children, for
[54:36] our travels to Canada, and I know he'll
[54:39] be a blessing there. The Hernandez
[54:41] family, they said they couldn't make it
[54:42] this morning. God willing, they'll be
[54:44] here tonight, but they wanted us to
[54:46] remember a friend of the a friend of
[54:47] theirs that was stung by a stingray. So,
[54:50] let's uphold that friend this morning.
[54:51] The Lord can be there and help them. Our
[54:54] precious sister Ellie, she's been in
[54:56] intense pain. I don't see her. I know
[54:58] she got to go home from the hospital,
[54:59] but let's remember sister Ellie
[55:01] Troutman, Sister U, and taking care of
[55:05] her.
[55:07] There's a request turn for our brother
[55:10] Samuel
[55:11] Johnson, the family from Michigan in
[55:14] prayer as he's not been given much time
[55:16] to live and the family's been saying
[55:18] their goodbyes. Pray for comfort and
[55:20] strength during this difficult time. So
[55:22] uphold them in prayer. If you've got a
[55:24] desire on your heart, a mighty prayer
[55:27] answering God, lift that before him.
[55:28] Hold it up in faith, believing, oh God.
[55:31] We just come to you humbly but boldly
[55:33] before the throne of grace, knowing
[55:35] there's a perfect sacrifice today, oh
[55:37] God. And we're so thankful for it.
[55:39] Appreciative of this place that you've
[55:41] given us, Lord. Appreciative of the
[55:43] health and strength, the revelation,
[55:46] Lord, of this late hour. We know that
[55:48] the politics and things will go down.
[55:50] But the bride, Lord, as fusion happens
[55:53] with the bride of Christ and the the
[55:56] creator, Lord, that this astronaut a
[55:58] brother Brandon likened it
[56:00] to as things were progressing that the
[56:04] bride was progressing with you. We want
[56:06] that in our lives, Lord. And for the
[56:08] people that have turned in a request
[56:10] before, brought it to the people, Lord,
[56:12] in faith believing for their needs. We
[56:14] just know you're a prayer answering God
[56:16] and that you have all power yet today
[56:18] and we invite you as the the guest of
[56:21] honor that you'd help help us heal us
[56:22] touch our bodies Lord and as we bring a
[56:26] maybe a meager tien offering that you'll
[56:29] just grow it and may it abound and may
[56:32] that last it go towards the kingdom Lord
[56:35] and that last soul potentially we're so
[56:37] thankful appreciate you so much and each

[1:07:00] you. Amen. You can be seated this
[1:07:03] morning.
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:06] A
[1:07:08] wonderful
[1:07:11] Savior is
[1:07:13] Jesus my
[1:07:16] Lord. A
[1:07:20] wonderful
[1:07:22] Savior to me.
[1:07:28] For he
[1:07:30] hideth my soul in the
[1:07:35] cl of the
[1:07:38] rock where
[1:07:41] rivers of
[1:07:44] pleasure I see.
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:50] Oh, he
[1:07:53] hideth my
[1:07:55] soul in the cl of the
[1:08:01] rock that
[1:08:04] shadows a dry
[1:08:08] thirsty land.
[1:08:13] Yes, he
[1:08:15] hideth my
[1:08:18] life in the depths of his
[1:08:24] love and
[1:08:27] covers me
[1:08:29] there with his hand.
[1:08:35] Oh, he
[1:08:38] covers me
[1:08:41] there with his hand. Let's sing the
[1:08:44] third verse. With numberless
[1:08:46] blessings. With
[1:08:50] numberless blessings. Each moment he
[1:08:52] crowns. Each
[1:08:54] moment he
[1:08:58] crowns and filled with his
[1:09:08] fullness I sing in my rapture.
[1:09:15] Oh,
[1:09:17] glory to
[1:09:20] God for
[1:09:23] such a
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:26] redeemer is
[1:09:29] mine.
[1:09:31] Oh, he
[1:09:34] hide my
[1:09:36] soul in the
[1:09:42] cler that sh
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:48] Christing L.
[1:09:54] Oh, hide in my
[1:09:59] life in
[1:10:05] the
[1:10:07] heers me
[1:10:10] there with his hand.
[1:10:17] He
[1:10:18] covers
[1:10:20] me with his hand. Just worship as the
[1:10:25] musicians continue to
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:42] play.
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:11:01] Glory. Heat.
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:52] Lord, thank you.
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:13:22] Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] Lord and
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:50] cover. Let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:13:52] prayer. Heavenly Father, thank
[1:13:55] you for covering us with the blood of
[1:14:00] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:02] It's under that protection that we come,
[1:14:05] Lord, to your throne that's covered in
[1:14:08] blood, mercy, and grace. Father, we ask
[1:14:12] that you would bless every heart
[1:14:14] gathered here today as we come to this
[1:14:17] portion of the service, Lord, is
[1:14:19] ministering of your word. May each one
[1:14:22] receive their portion. We pray. Oh God,
[1:14:26] forgive us of our shortcomings and our
[1:14:28] sins. Lord, we thank you, Lord, that we
[1:14:31] can feel your Holy Spirit in the service
[1:14:34] today. Oh God, come deeper into our
[1:14:37] hearts and deal with each one. We ask,
[1:14:41] oh God, we commit the service into your
[1:14:43] hands now in Jesus' name.
[1:14:47] Amen. Amen. Welcome to the house of the
[1:14:50] Lord this morning. So happy to see each
[1:14:53] of you and we welcome you. Amen. Are you
[1:14:56] happy to be here?
[1:14:58] So far, we're glad that you're happy. We
[1:15:00] want to make sure you stay happy. All
[1:15:02] right. And so, God bless you and welcome
[1:15:04] our visitors. Always good to see brother
[1:15:08] Henry and his dear wife there. God
[1:15:11] richly bless them and each of you. We'd
[1:15:14] like to go right to the word this
[1:15:16] morning. And we have a scripture we're
[1:15:18] going to take in Hebrews chapter 2. We
[1:15:21] ask you to stand.
[1:15:25] appreciate the song
[1:15:27] specials. Remember the service tonight,
[1:15:29] our brother Andrew Glover will be
[1:15:32] ministering the word of the
[1:15:35] Lord for us and we're trusting the Lord
[1:15:39] will bless that service. Amen.
[1:15:43] Um but we're in this service right now.
[1:15:46] So we ask him to really pour out his
[1:15:48] blessings upon us uh this morning.
[1:15:54] Hebrews chapter
[1:15:57] 2 verse number one. We've been talking
[1:16:02] about we've been with Joshua and Caleb
[1:16:05] and standing like them and we've been
[1:16:08] talking about the great
[1:16:09] purge how the Lord purges his church and
[1:16:13] then he purges the
[1:16:15] individual. And so let's take this
[1:16:17] scripture in Hebrews chapter 2.
[1:16:20] Therefore, we ought to give the more
[1:16:22] earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:16:26] heard, lest at any time we should let
[1:16:29] them slip.
[1:16:32] For if the word spoken by angels was
[1:16:35] steadfast, and every transgression and
[1:16:37] disobedience received a just recompense
[1:16:40] of reward, how shall we escape if we
[1:16:45] neglect so great
[1:16:47] salvation, which at the first began to
[1:16:50] be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
[1:16:53] unto us by them that heard him, God also
[1:16:59] bearing them witness, witness both with
[1:17:03] signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:17:07] miracles and of gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:10] according to his own will.
[1:17:15] Amen. The great purge. And we'll get
[1:17:18] into this apostasy just for a little
[1:17:21] bit. Second
[1:17:22] Thessalonians, if we can turn
[1:17:27] there, chapter 2.
[1:17:47] Verse one. Now we beseech you,
[1:17:51] brethren, by the coming of our Lord
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
[1:17:57] together unto him, that you be not soon
[1:18:01] shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither
[1:18:06] by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter,
[1:18:09] as from us, as that the day of Christ is
[1:18:13] at hand. Let no man deceive you by any
[1:18:18] means, for that day shall not come
[1:18:21] except there come a falling away first.
[1:18:24] And that the man of sin be revealed, the
[1:18:27] son of predition, who opposeth exaltth
[1:18:30] himself above all that is called God, or
[1:18:33] that is worshiped, so that he is God,
[1:18:36] siteth in the temple of God, showing
[1:18:39] himself that he is God. Remember ye not
[1:18:43] that when I was with you, I told you
[1:18:46] these
[1:18:48] things. Now let us pray. Lord Jesus, we
[1:18:51] ask you bless your word, you bless your
[1:18:53] people. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:18:57] Verse seven, for the mystery of iniquity
[1:19:01] doth already work. Only he who now letth
[1:19:04] will let until he be taken out of the
[1:19:07] way. And then shall the wicked one be
[1:19:09] revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
[1:19:13] with the spirit of his mouth, and shall
[1:19:15] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:19:18] coming. May God add a blessing to the
[1:19:20] reading of his word. You may be
[1:19:22] seated. This great purge we've been
[1:19:25] talking about is
[1:19:26] um we can see it in the kingdom of God
[1:19:30] with the children of Israel. We see it
[1:19:33] in Jesus's ministry.
[1:19:36] We can see it in our own lives, in our
[1:19:39] ministries. As the Lord begins to deal
[1:19:41] with us, there are things that he has to
[1:19:44] take away from us. And as we spoke last
[1:19:47] week, Sunday on this great circumcision
[1:19:50] and how the Holy Spirit is the
[1:19:54] circumciser and he
[1:19:56] circumcises the carnality that's
[1:19:59] associated with the believer. And our
[1:20:02] prayer should be Lord
[1:20:03] circumcise my
[1:20:06] thoughts. Circumcise my expectations.
[1:20:10] Circumcise my very
[1:20:14] intentions. Circumcise everything about
[1:20:17] me Lord that is extra weight that's
[1:20:21] holding me down. Amen. If that means I
[1:20:24] need to move from this place in my life
[1:20:29] to this place over here, then Lord, let
[1:20:32] your will be done. Amen. I don't want to
[1:20:36] hold on to a relationship that is
[1:20:39] pulling me down. I want to go on with
[1:20:42] the Lord.
[1:20:44] And his word gives us the answer that we
[1:20:47] can go on with him. Is that right?
[1:20:50] And so I as I was just internalizing the
[1:20:54] book of Joshua and thinking about his
[1:20:57] great success, we we can't help but note
[1:21:01] that part of his success had to be that
[1:21:05] so many unbelievers had to die first. We
[1:21:08] had to get rid of all of the heavy
[1:21:11] weight, the heavy
[1:21:12] unbelievers. And the Lord did that at
[1:21:15] Kadesh Barnea. you reached the final
[1:21:18] point where you've tempted me. Now I
[1:21:21] have to get rid of you. And then you
[1:21:23] know the Lord continues on using Joshua
[1:21:26] in his great ministry
[1:21:28] here. But as great as Joshua was and as
[1:21:32] powerful as his ministry was, and I
[1:21:35] don't think Joshua disbelieved God in
[1:21:38] any area of his life. I really don't.
[1:21:42] But I do believe that the whole children
[1:21:45] of Israel as a whole became
[1:21:48] neglectful. And this is what Gilgal was
[1:21:51] all about. We spoke about Gilgal was
[1:21:54] where the children of Israel had to be
[1:21:57] circumcised again. And the Lord called
[1:22:00] them to do this at Gilgal. And that word
[1:22:05] Gilgal means the rolling away of the
[1:22:08] approach uh the reproach. I've rolled
[1:22:12] the reproach of Egypt away from you.
[1:22:16] Now, they've had that on them all those
[1:22:18] years. I want you to think about that.
[1:22:20] They went through the journey. The Lord
[1:22:23] was upset with them at Kadesh
[1:22:25] Barnea. He gave an age group that would
[1:22:28] go forward and an age group that would
[1:22:30] not go forward.
[1:22:32] And he let the years go by till all the
[1:22:35] old fighters died
[1:22:37] out. And he said, "I you you got me
[1:22:40] upset. You got me mad and I'm holding
[1:22:42] all this against you. None of you will
[1:22:44] come into the promise. Now Joshua, take
[1:22:47] the people over, sanctify them, cleanse
[1:22:51] yourself. And then they started on in
[1:22:53] their ministry and they were anointed
[1:22:55] and blessed and God was with them.
[1:22:59] But in the back of God's mind, you have
[1:23:01] to know he knew that they were
[1:23:03] uncircumcised.
[1:23:05] And he still was holding this in reserve
[1:23:08] until the right time to bring it to
[1:23:11] them. That's too echoey. That's too
[1:23:13] echoey in my voice. I don't like that
[1:23:15] tunnel sound. Thank you. And God was
[1:23:19] holding this against them. Now they they
[1:23:22] were they were right. They were doing
[1:23:25] what was right, but they were just a
[1:23:27] little, let's say,
[1:23:28] neglectful. And it happens to every one
[1:23:31] of us. And we can be doing the will of
[1:23:34] God, be anointed of God, and still be
[1:23:38] neglectful
[1:23:40] in one area or the other. And this is
[1:23:43] where the word of the Lord, I believe,
[1:23:46] wants to draw our attention to that just
[1:23:49] for a moment here this
[1:23:51] morning. I read the scripture for you. I
[1:23:54] believe this was in Exodus where the
[1:23:58] Lord was going to slay Moses for not um
[1:24:01] circumcising his own
[1:24:03] son. How did Sapora know that that
[1:24:07] needed to get done?
[1:24:09] That's a good question. She wasn't born
[1:24:11] in the household of faith, but she's
[1:24:13] married to a man that's going in a
[1:24:15] ministry to go set the people of God
[1:24:19] free. And the
[1:24:21] Lord, the Bible says the anger of the
[1:24:24] Lord was against Moses and stood at the
[1:24:27] way and thought to slay him. Is that
[1:24:31] right? Let's take that scripture one
[1:24:33] more time. What What do I want now?
[1:24:36] Somebody help me.
[1:24:39] I got to get it myself.
[1:24:41] It'll be in Exodus. That's good. Good.
[1:24:44] Good.
[1:24:48] Let's turn there quickly. I have to read
[1:24:50] that because I just feel
[1:24:52] like we need to hear that before I read
[1:24:55] this quote. All
[1:24:58] [Music]
[1:25:00] right. I like those Bibles turning. All
[1:25:04] right. Exodus chapter
[1:25:07] 4. Thanks for
[1:25:10] trying, but turn there for me. All
[1:25:13] right. If you have a Bible, turn there.
[1:25:15] Don't get mad at me, sis brother. I'm
[1:25:18] I'm here to help you. God bless you.
[1:25:21] Exodus chapter 4. All right. Is that
[1:25:24] what I wanted?
[1:25:27] 4 and verse 25. Then and it came to pass
[1:25:31] verse
[1:25:33] 24. It came to pass by the way in the
[1:25:36] end that the Lord met him and sought to
[1:25:39] kill him. Then Sapora took a sharp stone
[1:25:42] and cut off the foreskin of her son,
[1:25:45] cast it at his feet, and said, "Surely a
[1:25:48] bloody husband art thou to me." So he
[1:25:51] let him go. Then she said, "A bloody
[1:25:53] husband thou art because of the
[1:25:57] circumcision." So was the Lord mad? The
[1:26:00] Bible said he was. The anger of the Lord
[1:26:03] was kindled against him. Now, here's
[1:26:05] what Brother Brandham says. I read it
[1:26:07] for you. I want to read it again because
[1:26:10] this is not, you know,
[1:26:12] neglect isn't on
[1:26:15] purpose. It isn't premeditated all the
[1:26:19] time. You neglect because you made a
[1:26:22] mistake or you forgot about it. You
[1:26:25] failed to keep it on the top of your
[1:26:27] list.
[1:26:29] You can be
[1:26:30] neglectful of your health, of your yard
[1:26:35] work, or of your the care and concern
[1:26:37] for your animals or your life. You can
[1:26:40] be neglectful of many things. Doesn't
[1:26:42] mean you're a bad person. Doesn't mean
[1:26:44] you're doing it on purpose. It means
[1:26:46] that you're a human
[1:26:47] being and you can be neglectful. Here
[1:26:50] what brother Random says in Israel, in
[1:26:52] the church. Here goes Moses come over.
[1:26:55] He said, "Jethro, I got to leave you
[1:26:57] today. grabbed up an old mule, put a
[1:27:00] halter on him, set his wife on the
[1:27:02] straddle of an old mule with a young on
[1:27:04] each hip. Here she went. Could you
[1:27:07] imagine that? An old man 80 years old,
[1:27:09] whiskers, long beard, long hair, a
[1:27:12] crooked stick in his hand, lead an old
[1:27:15] donkey with the woman sitting on it. Two
[1:27:17] kids going down to take over Egypt.
[1:27:20] Could you imagine a a sight like that?
[1:27:24] going down to do what?
[1:27:27] Moses some of them here he goes my he
[1:27:30] was having a big time come on Zapora
[1:27:33] that's his wife you know putting the old
[1:27:36] donkey to and pulling the old donkey too
[1:27:38] said come on we're going down to Egypt
[1:27:40] going to take over Egypt was like Russia
[1:27:44] the biggest mechanized unit the greatest
[1:27:46] army in the world was in Egypt they had
[1:27:49] the whole world whipped to the ground
[1:27:51] and Moses was going down to take over an
[1:27:54] old man with the stick in his hand and a
[1:27:57] wife sitting on a mule with a kid on
[1:28:00] each hip. Here she was going. They were
[1:28:02] going down to take over. Why? God had
[1:28:06] promised
[1:28:07] it. That's the same way at Kadesh
[1:28:10] Barnea. He says God had promised him.
[1:28:14] Joshua said, "We can do it because God
[1:28:17] said so." There they are going down to
[1:28:21] Egypt. And now watch how neglectful a
[1:28:24] man can get.
[1:28:26] In the end, God met him down here in the
[1:28:29] end and would have slayed him. And
[1:28:31] Sapora went and took a sharp rock and
[1:28:33] circumcised her two children with the
[1:28:36] sharp rock and throw the foreskin before
[1:28:39] Moses. So, you're a bloody husband to
[1:28:41] me. Only save Moses's life. What was
[1:28:45] Moses doing?
[1:28:47] Moses got in such a hustle and bustle of
[1:28:50] the day till he was in such a place to
[1:28:52] go down there he forgot the seal of
[1:28:58] circumcision. And that's where we are
[1:29:00] doing today. That's that's where we are
[1:29:03] doing today. That's where the holiness
[1:29:05] churches are failing. We've got so much
[1:29:08] time. The Lord has given us a lot of
[1:29:10] money. We're building great big
[1:29:11] churches, big spires, putting plush
[1:29:14] seats, pipe organs until we forgot the
[1:29:17] seal of God, which is the baptism of the
[1:29:20] Holy Ghost.
[1:29:22] True God sent us a zapora.
[1:29:27] Every church needs one.
[1:29:30] Every ministry has to have one. Somebody
[1:29:34] can see this needs to happen right away,
[1:29:37] right now. And you don't ask for
[1:29:40] permission. You don't get a second
[1:29:42] chance. You get up and you get the job
[1:29:44] done. And that's what she did. She
[1:29:47] grabbed the boy. She grabbed the rock.
[1:29:49] She circumcised. She didn't say, "Hey,
[1:29:51] Moses, let's pray about this. Moses, why
[1:29:54] don't you do it? This is your response."
[1:29:55] She got the job done.
[1:29:57] Why? An angel was there to slay her
[1:30:00] husband.
[1:30:03] That's what you call a good helpmate.
[1:30:06] Amen. Yes.
[1:30:08] Go get it. It needs to get done. Go get
[1:30:10] it. He didn't do it. You do it. And
[1:30:13] that's what Zapora did. Oh God, send us
[1:30:16] a Zapora this morning.
[1:30:20] Amen.
[1:30:22] And so the neglect, the forgot the seal
[1:30:26] of God. Now I've taken this marriage and
[1:30:30] divorce on Wednesday nights.
[1:31:59] of ours, a pastor, I won't call his
[1:32:01] name, but he gave his testimony right in
[1:32:03] our congregation. It was years after he
[1:32:06] was married and had children that he
[1:32:07] real a pastor's kid, too. Raising a
[1:32:11] pastor, taught Sunday school and
[1:32:13] realized he didn't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:16] Now, how does that happen? Whose fault
[1:32:19] is that? or or we gonna act like that
[1:32:22] doesn't happen today. Or we think that
[1:32:24] our our church is the greatest church.
[1:32:25] We got the best whatever. And everybody
[1:32:28] has an understanding that you need the
[1:32:31] Holy Ghost before you even think about
[1:32:34] getting married.
[1:32:37] And we all understand that, don't we? I
[1:32:39] thought we did. I thought we all
[1:32:41] understood that.
[1:32:45] But apparently we
[1:32:47] don't. Because if we all had the Holy
[1:32:49] Ghost, we'd have all the
[1:32:52] problems. And another thing, I started
[1:32:54] to look at some of the neglectful
[1:32:57] things. And I'm pointing to myself, the
[1:33:00] neglectful things, the forgetful things
[1:33:03] that maybe we've neglected to keep
[1:33:06] before the people, to preach to the
[1:33:09] people, not because we're bad, not
[1:33:12] because uh we're doing it intentionally,
[1:33:15] but because it's a neglect. We missed
[1:33:17] it. We missed it. So, let's go back and
[1:33:21] pick up Gilgal.
[1:33:25] Let's have that moment of a
[1:33:27] circumcision.
[1:33:28] Now, the prophet of God uh uh I was just
[1:33:32] going back a little bit. That's what we
[1:33:34] kind of talked about last week and the
[1:33:36] importance and brother Bham says how
[1:33:39] neglectful a man can get. Now this is in
[1:33:42] the message spoken word is the original
[1:33:44] seed and he's talking about himself how
[1:33:48] he is neglectful and so now you know
[1:33:51] don't I'm not pointing fingers at anyone
[1:33:53] but all of us and the word of God is
[1:33:56] talking about all of us who needs the
[1:33:59] Holy Ghost your pastor needs the Holy
[1:34:01] Ghost. It's not the newcomer or the
[1:34:04] young person or the it's me. I need it.
[1:34:09] If you don't need it, pray for me that I
[1:34:11] receive it. Another baptism, another
[1:34:16] outpouring, another fresh move of God.
[1:34:21] Get down in my soul.
[1:34:24] Take over my life again. That's what I
[1:34:27] desire. Now, some of you old-timers
[1:34:29] don't need it, but pray for me cuz I
[1:34:31] need it.
[1:34:34] We need it. How many can say we need it?
[1:34:38] Amen. Yes, we need it. Spoken word is
[1:34:41] the original CD. He says this paragraph
[1:34:43] 457. Now I've been accused of a lot of
[1:34:45] things, friends, and a lot of things I'm
[1:34:48] guilty of. I'm
[1:34:50] neglectful. That's true. I don't know
[1:34:54] why it is. Somebody has to push me in
[1:34:57] the corner, make me fight. I don't know.
[1:35:01] That's the nature. I've done things that
[1:35:03] I should not have done. not willfully,
[1:35:06] but I plundered at. And that's what
[1:35:09] makes me so afraid. I'm seeing in this
[1:35:11] day, the day that we're living at. And
[1:35:13] you see now what I believe. I want to
[1:35:16] hear from God if all possible before I
[1:35:19] make a move. See, because I don't want
[1:35:21] to fail him. I want to be with him
[1:35:24] everywhere. And I want you to pray for
[1:35:28] me.
[1:35:30] If anybody had the boldness, should have
[1:35:32] had the boldness to go out there and
[1:35:33] fight, it ought to have been in the
[1:35:34] prophet. But he said he was so he was
[1:35:37] neglectful. This is not willfully. This
[1:35:39] is something that happens to all of us
[1:35:42] being neglectful. All right, let's go a
[1:35:45] little bit
[1:35:45] further now. Have we neglected some
[1:35:50] things in our
[1:35:52] congregation? Have we? in our homes.
[1:35:55] Some of your mothers and fathers, have
[1:35:57] we
[1:35:58] neglected? You know, if you neglect to
[1:36:00] do something, God holds that against
[1:36:02] you. He's watching you. It's because you
[1:36:05] neglected or you forgot about it doesn't
[1:36:07] mean God forgot about it. And if you
[1:36:10] really want to move on with God, you'll
[1:36:11] ask him, "Lord, what am I neglecting?"
[1:36:15] And then he'll give and when you ask
[1:36:16] that question, you got to be willing to
[1:36:18] take the true answer and then do
[1:36:21] something about it. and stop waiting for
[1:36:25] everybody else to get on board.
[1:36:29] You do something because he's
[1:37:25] have he had a healing line at the
[1:37:27] tabernacle and out of the 10 times two
[1:37:30] times it was successful but that didn't
[1:37:32] stop him from doing it and I just love
[1:37:35] that and so but uh in faith without
[1:37:38] works is dead. He's talking to I believe
[1:37:42] it's a young lady in the prayer
[1:37:45] line or he's giving uh uh before he goes
[1:37:48] into the prayer line. Paragraph number
[1:37:50] nine, faith without works is dead. 1953,
[1:37:53] the prophet of God says, "Usually it's
[1:37:56] in the line of discernment. I never try
[1:37:58] to cast out a spirit unless first I
[1:38:01] realize what I'm doing because that's a
[1:38:04] dangerous thing." Did you know that?
[1:38:06] Very dangerous. Unless you understand
[1:38:08] what you're doing. If you'll notice on
[1:38:10] the platform after the anointing comes,
[1:38:12] you never hear me challenge the spirit.
[1:38:15] Let's uh firstly I see where God's it's
[1:38:18] God's will to do it. Now you say, is it
[1:38:21] God's will? Well, sometime people come
[1:38:23] to the platform who many
[1:38:27] times are even not Christians. They want
[1:38:30] to be healed of diseases and maybe they
[1:38:33] have been Christians and done something
[1:38:35] in their life or neglected to do
[1:38:38] something and that's the reason they
[1:38:41] can't get
[1:38:43] healed. So under the power of
[1:38:46] discernment when the prophetic utter
[1:38:48] utterance goes forth it tells you just
[1:38:51] exactly where your trouble is. Then get
[1:38:54] that out of the way first. Then God's
[1:38:59] got to heal you.
[1:39:01] Okay, that's on healing. What about the
[1:39:03] Holy Spirit? What about moving on with
[1:39:06] the Lord?
[1:39:08] What about whatever God has for you? If
[1:39:11] there's something you've neglected to
[1:39:12] do, you know, repentance is all about
[1:39:16] you. Repentance isn't me making you
[1:39:19] repent or making you feel so guilty.
[1:39:22] It's not me gonna come down and repent.
[1:39:24] For repentance is an internal, you know,
[1:39:28] conversation you have with yourself. And
[1:39:31] you can play the game and play the role
[1:39:34] with people and make the crowd feel a
[1:39:37] certain way about you, but deep down in
[1:39:39] your heart, you got to be really honest
[1:39:42] with yourself. And it's a strange thing
[1:39:45] that many Christians don't believe they
[1:39:47] have anything to repent of.
[1:39:50] like been serving the Lord 20, 30, 40
[1:39:54] years and you have nothing to repent
[1:39:58] of. And that's quite strange.
[1:40:01] I think it's quite off. I think that
[1:40:04] needs to be circumcised.
[1:40:07] There's a crust being built over your
[1:40:09] relationship with the Lord. You think
[1:40:11] God has You think you're going to live
[1:40:13] your life without making any mistakes?
[1:40:16] Are you serious?
[1:40:18] So God has to deal with me, you, every
[1:40:22] one of us.
[1:40:24] He deals with us through his word.
[1:40:28] And his word has the purpose of the the
[1:40:30] challenges trying to move us forward
[1:40:34] into the blessings of God and the
[1:40:36] kingdom of God. Amen. Every one of us.
[1:40:41] Amen.
[1:40:44] And so the prophet goes forward. Let's
[1:40:47] take this little example and then hear
[1:40:49] ye
[1:40:52] him. Dear Jesus, paragraph number
[1:40:56] 43 says, "Dear Jesus, as my mind slips
[1:40:59] back into that little opening, the top
[1:41:01] of the side of the mountain that day,
[1:41:03] some 12, 14 years ago near the place
[1:41:06] called Pond of Safety to see that old
[1:41:08] mother dear that she could not help it.
[1:41:11] She was a mother by nature. God, she had
[1:41:13] to display her love, her gallant love
[1:41:17] because it was her nature. Oh Jesus,
[1:41:20] there's a people in this building
[1:41:22] tonight that's joined church years ago.
[1:41:26] Maybe some of them has not, but they're
[1:41:28] are human beings that you um projected
[1:41:32] your son to them and the love of God to
[1:41:34] them and they just cold formerly joined
[1:41:38] the church or maybe neglected it all
[1:41:41] together. But they've always wanted the
[1:41:43] time that when they could have the real
[1:41:46] thing.
[1:41:49] They've had their ups and
[1:41:52] downs, ins and outs. God grant to every
[1:41:56] person tonight while your great presence
[1:41:58] is here that they will accept Jesus the
[1:42:01] savior and let him place into their
[1:42:05] nature into their character the
[1:42:09] characteristics of Jesus
[1:42:11] Christ that they might love one another
[1:42:14] and love you so much that they'll go
[1:42:16] home and act like Christians and live
[1:42:20] like Christians have fellowship with all
[1:42:22] the Christians and be your children and
[1:42:24] be such in the neighborhood until as the
[1:42:27] mother dear display the love of the
[1:42:29] mother and one unbeliever and one
[1:42:32] unbeliever to Christ may they display
[1:42:35] display the salt of the kingdom of God
[1:42:39] in Christian love. Amen.
[1:42:44] Now, there is a real thing to be had.
[1:42:52] Saints,
[1:42:53] there is a real
[1:42:55] thing. And sometimes we do things out of
[1:42:58] motion or because the time it's time to
[1:43:01] do it. And even our worship, it's
[1:43:04] complimentary to the people that are
[1:43:05] around us. And many times we s do
[1:43:08] things, we say amen. and we do things,
[1:43:10] but you know, there is a real
[1:43:14] thing that motivates and moves the
[1:43:17] believer.
[1:43:19] And I I I wonder sometimes if we've
[1:43:22] neglected to hear from the real
[1:43:27] thing that it really strikes our heart
[1:43:31] and our spirit, the word that comes
[1:43:33] across to us every weekend or every week
[1:43:37] as we come into the presence of the
[1:43:39] Lord. I wonder if we leave just because
[1:43:43] the service said it was time for us to
[1:43:45] leave or did we leave when the Holy
[1:43:48] Spirit said it's time for you to
[1:43:51] leave? Or was he still trying to get
[1:43:54] something accomplished in your life,
[1:43:56] father, mother,
[1:43:59] reverend? Was he still trying to get
[1:44:02] something over to you?
[1:44:05] You know this is the sincerity that we
[1:44:07] have to come into and this is the we
[1:44:09] don't want to neglect that
[1:44:13] post sermon
[1:44:16] worship the word has come so far up you
[1:44:19] listen to the tape you listen to the
[1:44:20] word we worship the Lord the preaching
[1:44:23] is done and then there's a little sweet
[1:44:26] spot right at the end of the service
[1:44:28] where no other time probably in your
[1:44:32] week will you be in an atmosphere like
[1:44:34] at where your heart is pliable and and
[1:44:36] something can shift and move right at
[1:44:39] this little 10 minutes, 7 minutes,
[1:44:42] whatever it is. And many of us run and
[1:44:46] we leave or we break that anointing.
[1:44:49] Lord, help us not to neglect that. We
[1:44:52] don't do it willingly. We're not doing
[1:44:54] it to be bad people, but I be believe
[1:44:56] that maybe we maybe neglect that. Some
[1:44:58] of us have serious answers we're asking
[1:45:00] the Lord about and he wants to answer
[1:45:02] those. But just when the atmosphere gets
[1:45:06] right to answer that for
[1:45:09] you, we break that anointing. Lord, help
[1:45:12] us. I wonder if we've neglected the
[1:45:15] altar time. I wonder if we haven't been
[1:45:18] sensitive enough to those that need to
[1:45:21] be born
[1:45:23] again. Lord, help us today.
[1:45:27] The prophet of God goes forward in this
[1:45:29] message here and this is a touchy one.
[1:45:31] thinking on our way 1959 these
[1:45:35] two and as I thought on my way in 59 as
[1:45:39] well we'll take this one in paragraph
[1:45:41] for 41 says what good will it do you say
[1:45:44] brother Benham raise up your hand one
[1:45:46] time and see how it
[1:45:48] feels you in radio land way out there
[1:45:51] dad out there by the radio mother
[1:45:53] sitting across the sewing you there in
[1:45:56] the hospitals have you examined yourself
[1:45:58] by the word yet you that's got sick
[1:46:01] sickness in your home. You that's got a
[1:46:03] weward boy, have you talked to him? A
[1:46:07] girl that doesn't obey, God, have you
[1:46:10] talked to them? Put your arms around
[1:46:12] them? Have you just neglected it
[1:46:15] expecting the Sunday school teacher to
[1:46:18] do
[1:46:19] it? God gave the child to you.
[1:46:24] It's your duty to talk to them. If there
[1:46:27] is it, won't you put up your hands just
[1:46:30] now and say, "Lord, remember me. I'm not
[1:46:32] I'm thinking on my ways."
[1:46:35] Sometimes we want the school teacher,
[1:46:37] want the pastor to fix it. Amen. Want
[1:46:40] someone else in the church to fix it,
[1:46:41] but God gave those children to you.
[1:46:45] Those are your children. That's your
[1:46:47] heritage. Amen, somebody.
[1:46:50] And uh uh uh we want to be we want to be
[1:46:54] sensitive to that that the Lord gave you
[1:46:56] the wisdom to raise your home. You the
[1:47:00] wisdom to lead your family. He say well
[1:47:02] do it like brother show like no this is
[1:47:05] your home and God gave that to you and
[1:47:09] he knows your capabilities your
[1:47:11] weaknesses and all your fity and he gave
[1:47:14] it to you anyways and he's given you
[1:47:17] with that grace to get the job done.
[1:47:21] Don't neglect that. Amen. You have it in
[1:47:25] you my brother and my sister to get the
[1:47:28] job done.
[1:47:30] Paragraph 39. As I thought on my way,
[1:47:32] the prophet God says
[1:47:34] this. There might be many in here
[1:47:37] tonight thinking about going home. Old
[1:47:39] age is catching up with you. Sickness
[1:47:41] got you in the grip. Better think on
[1:47:43] your way before you get there. As Jacob
[1:47:46] on his way with his wife and children,
[1:47:48] he heard a message coming that Esau the
[1:47:50] great with with the great army was
[1:47:52] coming to meet him. And he began to
[1:47:54] think on his ways. the way he done. Esau
[1:47:57] cheated him and it drove him to prayer
[1:48:00] all night long. He wrestled with the
[1:48:02] angel of the Lord. I
[1:48:05] trust that men and women, boys and
[1:48:08] girls, who's neglected the baptism of
[1:48:10] the Holy
[1:48:11] Ghost, you don't know how near you are
[1:48:14] to home. I trust that you purpose in
[1:48:16] your heart that you'll wrestle with the
[1:48:18] angel of the Lord and not let him go
[1:48:22] until you're blessed.
[1:48:26] Amen.
[1:48:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:48:31] Brother Random continues on in the
[1:48:32] message. Why? Amen. Don't you love the
[1:48:35] Lord? Let me keep moving here. I got to
[1:48:38] get to something here and we'll close.
[1:48:39] All
[1:48:40] right. Now,
[1:48:43] uh the prophet is dealing with in the
[1:48:45] message.
[1:48:46] Why? And he's bringing this individual
[1:48:49] up in uh uh uh in the prayer
[1:48:53] line. And um it's in the message. Why?
[1:48:56] And I think I wrote down this might be
[1:49:00] one of the things that we have neglected
[1:49:02] as message churches and message pastors
[1:49:05] is this the
[1:49:06] basic the basic
[1:49:09] fundamentals of being
[1:49:12] saved of
[1:49:14] repenting and then being
[1:49:17] baptized and then you go on to receive
[1:49:19] the Holy
[1:49:20] Ghost. I think we have so much truth. I
[1:49:23] know we have so much truth that we've
[1:49:26] presented that and we've given the
[1:49:28] stories of what has happened today and
[1:49:30] those things are beautiful. Those things
[1:49:32] are nice but that's not salvation. It's
[1:49:35] just information until you repent.
[1:49:39] You got to repent of your sins. Turn
[1:49:43] away from the things that you were doing
[1:49:45] first. Realize that you're a sinner.
[1:49:48] Repent from that and then get baptized.
[1:49:52] And then after you're baptized, the
[1:49:54] church shouldn't be full of people that
[1:49:56] were baptized in water, but nobody
[1:49:58] received the Holy Ghost. The next step
[1:50:01] is to receive the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:50:06] part of the great plan of
[1:50:09] salvation. Repent, be baptized, and
[1:50:13] receive the Holy Ghost. It's for you.
[1:50:16] It's a gift of God. And many
[1:50:19] have neglected to keep this before our
[1:50:22] children. We've neglected to make that
[1:50:25] the important part of our ministry.
[1:50:29] Is are you born again? Have you received
[1:50:32] the Holy Ghost since you believe? And
[1:50:34] we've moved on and we've gone into
[1:50:36] courtship and dating and haven't even
[1:50:39] received the Holy Ghost yet. And moved
[1:50:42] on. And you know, this is a this is an
[1:50:44] absolute must. It's a requirement to
[1:50:47] receive the Holy Ghost and that is
[1:50:50] absolutely something that we have
[1:50:52] neglected. I believe one of those
[1:50:55] things. Brother Bham deals with that and
[1:50:58] it gives a little example there. Let me
[1:51:00] take it real quick. Paragraph number 78.
[1:51:02] I'll just drop down says, "Now upon the
[1:51:06] basis of something speaking to you, you
[1:51:08] wanted to be saved. Something spoke to
[1:51:10] you to come to the altar. You did it.
[1:51:12] Now you've confessed your sins. Lord,
[1:51:15] I'm wrong. I don't want to be wrong. I
[1:51:17] want to be right. I want you to forgive
[1:51:18] me. He said, "He that comes to me, I'll
[1:51:21] no ice cast out." You raised from your
[1:51:24] seat where you're already when you
[1:51:26] raised from your seat, you were already
[1:51:28] forgiven. See, now can you accept him
[1:51:32] now? Nothing on what you've done. All
[1:51:35] you've done's forgotten. Upon the basis
[1:51:38] of his promise, his spirit led you to
[1:51:41] the altar. Do you accept him as your
[1:51:43] savior? Raise your hand if you do. Say,
[1:51:46] "I will accept him as savior. God bless
[1:51:48] you." Now, the next thing you must do,
[1:51:50] you're already saved. He that will
[1:51:52] confess me before men, I will confess
[1:51:54] him before my father. If you're ashamed
[1:51:57] of me here, I'll be ashamed of you at
[1:51:58] the judgment. Now, you are Christians.
[1:52:02] Now, now the next thing you want to do
[1:52:04] is be baptized and receive the baptism
[1:52:07] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:10] Let me ask you, has that prescription
[1:52:12] changed?
[1:52:14] Has it? It has not changed. That's still
[1:52:18] the answer for all of us. And so, we've
[1:52:23] neglected some of those basic
[1:52:25] principles.
[1:52:27] And now as we look into how God is
[1:52:31] purging each and every one of us, the
[1:52:33] the scripture there in Romans chap
[1:52:37] 11 deals with those that could not enter
[1:52:42] in because of
[1:52:45] unbelief and they were cut off from God.
[1:52:49] And so that is that's you know you can
[1:52:51] look at that as the purge, the pruning
[1:52:53] and purging. You could look at that as
[1:52:56] the
[1:52:57] circumcision. We could see that happen
[1:52:59] in with the children of Israel. We see
[1:53:01] it happen with Jesus's ministry also
[1:53:06] when he begin to preach on the things
[1:53:09] concerning the third pool. His ministry,
[1:53:14] who he was, the loaves and fishes didn't
[1:53:17] bother anybody. In fact, that caused the
[1:53:19] crowd to grow. But then now he's going
[1:53:23] to circumcise the crowd by bringing the
[1:53:26] things that they really needed to hear.
[1:53:29] Except you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:53:32] blood, you have no life in you. Now the
[1:53:36] Apostle Paul makes a a statement here in
[1:53:40] First Thessalonians. Just turn there
[1:53:41] quickly in verse number chapter 2.
[1:53:51] First
[1:53:53] Thessalonians where Paul makes this sec
[1:53:56] statement.
[1:54:04] Um he's asking for the saints to pray
[1:54:07] for him.
[1:54:17] 2 Thessalonians chapter 3. Sorry.
[1:54:19] Finally, brethren. 2 Thessalonians
[1:54:21] chapter
[1:54:24] 3. Finally, brethren, pray for us that
[1:54:29] the word of the Lord may have free
[1:54:33] course and be glorified even as it is
[1:54:36] with you. Paul's asking the saints to
[1:54:39] pray for him. Such an anointed man. And
[1:54:41] does he need somebody to pray for him?
[1:54:44] He asked for it. Absolutely, he needs
[1:54:48] it. Yes, he's anointed. Yes, he's God's
[1:54:51] servant. Yes, he's a prophet. Yes, God's
[1:54:53] used him tremendously. And he tells the
[1:54:55] saints to pray for us. Finally,
[1:54:57] brethren, pray for us that the word of
[1:54:59] the Lord may have what? Free course. Not
[1:55:03] pray that I'll be free, but that the
[1:55:05] word would have free course and be
[1:55:08] glorified even as it is with you. and
[1:55:11] that you and that we may be delivered
[1:55:15] from
[1:55:17] unreasonable and wicked men. For all men
[1:55:20] have not faith.
[1:55:24] Now, are there wicked men out there?
[1:55:28] Are they unreasonable?
[1:55:30] Yes. The Bible tells us that these men
[1:55:35] would arise in the last days. Here Paul
[1:55:39] is praying that he would be delivered
[1:55:43] from them. Remember we talked about the
[1:55:46] canker. Their words will caner as a
[1:55:49] sword. Those words of you know it's in
[1:55:52] uh second Thessalonians there. He's
[1:55:55] talking about these these gentlemen that
[1:55:58] that's speaking about the resurrection
[1:56:00] there. He says don't don't listen to
[1:56:02] them because there's word their words
[1:56:03] will corrupt you and begin to canker
[1:56:05] you. It's like a sore parasite and it's
[1:56:09] cancerous for you to listen to it. And
[1:56:12] there's some radio station, there's some
[1:56:14] people out there, people write books
[1:56:16] that you don't need to read or listen
[1:56:18] to.
[1:56:20] It's not for you. It's got cancer in it.
[1:56:22] There's an infection in there and it
[1:56:25] will affect you. Amen. Now, the Apostle
[1:56:29] Paul warned us of this great falling
[1:56:33] away to come. And I can't help but think
[1:56:36] of the last few years of the falling
[1:56:39] away that we have seen quote unquote in
[1:56:42] the message. I remember in 2014, I
[1:56:45] believe it was, there's a great
[1:56:46] minister, won't call his name, many of
[1:56:48] you would know who he is, from Ohio.
[1:56:52] He stood up and gave an open resignation
[1:56:55] at his church. Beautiful church there.
[1:56:58] The church is still going forward today.
[1:57:00] How many know what I'm talking about?
[1:57:02] Yes. Tremendous ministry. Wasn't an
[1:57:05] overnight guy. Been there for many
[1:57:07] years. Over 20, maybe over 30, 40 years.
[1:57:10] I don't I'm not fully sure, but many,
[1:57:12] many years. And when he gave his
[1:57:14] resignation, he said he'd been wrestling
[1:57:17] with this for two years.
[1:57:20] So we have the resignation today, but
[1:57:22] two years prior he was all the spirit
[1:57:25] was already working on him. And we see
[1:57:28] that you know it was like in 2014 or so
[1:57:31] and it's like a great you know you take
[1:57:33] a rock out of a mountain you pull it out
[1:57:36] there's little tremors and other little
[1:57:38] loose places that fall. Doesn't look
[1:57:40] like there was a major happening then.
[1:57:43] Doesn't look like a group large group of
[1:57:46] ministers followed him. But if you keep
[1:57:48] living and you trace the details, you'll
[1:57:52] see that this has happened and it
[1:57:54] happened again.
[1:57:57] Another fine ministry minister in the
[1:58:00] Carolas there. Our brother, some people
[1:58:04] we know were on the board there. And
[1:58:05] this this particular brother had been
[1:58:08] preaching for years questioning and
[1:58:10] doubting in his own heart and is coming
[1:58:13] from the pulpit, but the people didn't
[1:58:15] know it. Amen. And this is a this was a
[1:58:18] you know I I listened to him and when he
[1:58:21] resigned he was giving an interview. He
[1:58:23] said he's been pastoring for over 30
[1:58:27] years and he couldn't reconcile the
[1:58:31] inconsistencies with the
[1:58:34] message.
[1:58:36] Okay. And of course few hundred several
[1:58:39] hundred in his church. I think he had
[1:58:42] over a dozen ministers in his church.
[1:58:44] this I'm listening to his own testimony,
[1:58:46] not the hearsay. This is what he said.
[1:58:49] And after trying to reconcile and make
[1:58:52] the message make sense, he couldn't
[1:58:54] bring a reconciliation. So, he had to
[1:58:57] step away from it.
[1:59:01] And he's still got a ministry today. And
[1:59:04] maybe if he writes a book, maybe he
[1:59:06] might send you a copy.
[1:59:10] I'm not interested in reading it.
[1:59:13] No. No, no. I've come too far in my
[1:59:17] journey now. What do I need to hear that
[1:59:20] for? For what? I need to hear the
[1:59:23] message. I haven't heard all the message
[1:59:25] yet. Go ahead. Paul says, "Deliver me
[1:59:29] from wicked and unreasonable men." Some
[1:59:32] of us need to be delivered from that.
[1:59:36] Now, the importance of staying with this
[1:59:40] message cannot be overemphasized. Let me
[1:59:43] take a quote for you out of the church
[1:59:45] age book. All right,
[1:59:47] let me get this out of the church age
[1:59:49] book quickly. I didn't give this to you,
[1:59:50] sis. In the back there, brethren, in the
[1:59:52] back, the lady OC in church age, the
[1:59:55] prophet of God says this. Now, this
[1:59:58] messenger of Malachi
[2:00:03] 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[2:00:07] things.
[2:00:10] One, according to Malachi 4, he will
[2:00:13] turn the hearts of the children to the
[2:00:16] fathers.
[2:00:18] two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[2:00:21] seven thunders in Revelations 10, which
[2:00:25] are the revelations contained in the
[2:00:28] seven seals,
[2:00:30] which is where marriage and divorce
[2:00:32] comes from, which is where the, you
[2:00:34] know, the the serpent seed comes from,
[2:00:37] which all the mysteries come out of
[2:00:39] there. Huh? He will reveal the mysteries
[2:00:42] in the seven thunders in Revelation 10,
[2:00:44] which are the revelations contained in
[2:00:46] the seven seals. It will be these
[2:00:49] divinely revealed mystery truths
[2:00:54] that literally turn the hearts of the
[2:00:58] children to the Pentecostal fathers.
[2:01:06] Now many people I've met him young
[2:01:10] people raised in the message haven't
[2:01:13] even read their church age book. Amen.
[2:01:16] actually preaching preachers don't even
[2:01:19] know the word that that this great feast
[2:01:22] that the Lord has given to us in this
[2:01:25] day in this
[2:01:26] hour and the importance to say only
[2:01:30] what's on them tapes
[2:01:33] okay I'm going somewhere I'm going
[2:01:36] somewhere this
[2:01:37] morning now I can't explain all the
[2:01:40] tapes I can't explain all the
[2:01:43] visions I believe they were recorded on
[2:01:45] purpose purpose. I have to say
[2:01:47] that I believe God knew the prophet
[2:01:49] would say what he was going to say.
[2:01:53] And then there would be a ministry that
[2:01:54] would come up and say, "Well, let me
[2:01:56] explain it for all of y'all."
[2:02:00] Go ahead.
[2:02:02] Because I know you're struggling and you
[2:02:04] need an explanation.
[2:02:07] I wonder what the people who heard it in
[2:02:09] them service, what did they get? Who
[2:02:11] explained it to them? Yeah. I wonder
[2:02:13] what the what Peter and them who
[2:02:15] explained it to them. Eat my flesh,
[2:02:18] drink, they had no clue what brother
[2:02:20] Jesus was talking about.
[2:02:24] Eat my flesh and drink my blood. What
[2:02:28] are we talking about here? We My mama
[2:02:30] wanted to be healed. We wanted to live a
[2:02:33] better Christian life. We wanted to be
[2:02:35] saved. What are you talking about? Eat
[2:02:36] my flesh and drink my blood.
[2:02:39] Well, that's a part of the ministry.
[2:02:42] And remember, these divinely revealed
[2:02:47] truths literally turn the hearts back to
[2:02:52] the fathers. That's your faith, saints.
[2:02:58] Okay. Now,
[2:03:00] so these pastors as I was mentioning
[2:03:04] them
[2:03:06] 2014, six years later, 2020, 2021, right
[2:03:10] in there. And then the one
[2:03:13] pastor, he says while he was grappling
[2:03:15] with all of this and the people didn't
[2:03:18] know that he was struggling with this,
[2:03:19] so he he brings his his um questions or
[2:03:23] inconsistencies, his questions and
[2:03:25] doubts to his deacon board. And when he
[2:03:28] got to his deacon board, this is his
[2:03:30] words now. He says, "I told the deacon
[2:03:32] board to listen to this tape of this
[2:03:36] other brother who
[2:03:44] backslid."
[2:03:45] Yes. Because this other brother studied
[2:03:48] it out and brought out all the
[2:03:49] inconsistencies for us.
[2:03:55] And this other brother is from the
[2:03:56] Canada area. Is it okay if I mention the
[2:03:59] regions? Oh, I mentioned their name. I
[2:04:01] don't mind mentioning their name. I
[2:04:03] really
[2:04:04] don't. You already
[2:04:07] mad. If you're mad now, you was already
[2:04:10] mad. I ain't going to make I can't make
[2:04:11] you mad at this point. You was already
[2:04:13] mad at this point. Am I right about it,
[2:04:16] somebody?
[2:04:18] But ain't nobody mad here, right?
[2:04:24] But you got to go back and look and see
[2:04:25] where this thing started. It looked like
[2:04:28] the first brother who fell like it was
[2:04:30] no effect and everybody preached against
[2:04:32] him. But we didn't know that seeds were
[2:04:35] planted in other pull pits.
[2:04:40] and they get up teaching, having Bible
[2:04:42] study, having special meetings, bringing
[2:04:44] in message preachers, message pastors,
[2:04:47] youth conventions, and from their pull
[2:04:49] pit, they're unreasonable. They're
[2:04:52] wicked
[2:04:54] because they're planting a seed of doubt
[2:04:56] and unbelief.
[2:04:58] But the Apostle Paul said that these
[2:05:02] days we come,
[2:05:05] there will be a great falling away. What
[2:05:08] do they fall away from? They fall away
[2:05:11] from the word.
[2:05:14] The Bible said so. Amen.
[2:05:17] Let's go into it just a little bit.
[2:05:20] Now, in the message making this valley
[2:05:23] full of
[2:05:31] ditches. I'm sorry. That might not be
[2:05:35] the right. I didn't give you the number
[2:05:36] on that. I think the hour has
[2:05:39] come. Pardon
[2:05:42] me. Maybe it's the angel of the Lord.
[2:05:44] Let's
[2:05:46] see. Yeah, this the message the angel of
[2:05:50] the Lord 1951 paragraph number 15. And
[2:05:56] as
[2:05:59] get and as atheism is on the march and
[2:06:03] so forth and the churches are falling
[2:06:05] away and getting formal.
[2:06:09] Let me say this to you my dear brother
[2:06:10] and sister. If you receive me as your
[2:06:13] brother, we need a revival.
[2:06:20] The prophet of God continues in the
[2:06:21] message making the valley full of
[2:06:23] ditches. Paragraph
[2:06:25] 52. The hour has come for falling away
[2:06:30] of the church. The hour has come that
[2:06:34] religion would spread the world without
[2:06:39] salvation form of godliness denying the
[2:06:41] power thereof. The hour has come. The
[2:06:44] hour has come for the church to rise.
[2:06:46] The hour has come to ra for your raise
[2:06:49] out of the dust and shake yourself and
[2:06:51] come to herself and
[2:06:54] realize
[2:06:55] positionally that she is the church of
[2:06:59] the living God. The hour has come that
[2:07:04] somebody wakes up and they realize that
[2:07:09] I am a
[2:07:11] believer of this word that God said in
[2:07:15] this last day. She'll shake herself.
[2:07:19] She'll wake up one Sunday morning. Wake
[2:07:22] up one afternoon. Wake up while she's
[2:07:24] listening to the tape and something will
[2:07:26] shake her. Who am I? I am the church of
[2:07:29] the living God.
[2:07:32] Amen.
[2:07:34] Paragraph 145 in the message the mark of
[2:07:36] the beast Paul said that day should not
[2:07:41] come unless there come a falling away
[2:07:43] first and the man of sin be revealed.
[2:07:47] Now watch he declares him to be a man.
[2:07:50] Is that right? Paul said he was the man
[2:07:52] of sin who opposes himself all above
[2:07:55] that is called God. So he that is
[2:07:58] worshiped, he's worshiped as God, a man
[2:08:01] worshiped as God. Brother Bham continues
[2:08:04] on, a man as that would be put here as a
[2:08:08] form of worship. And he said that day
[2:08:10] could not come except first there come a
[2:08:15] falling away. What is
[2:08:18] it? Was it? What is
[2:08:22] it? I got it back here. Y'all don't have
[2:08:24] it up. a lukewarm
[2:08:27] condition. What is the falling
[2:08:29] away? A lukewarm. How many of our
[2:08:32] message churches are on fire?
[2:08:36] Well, it really doesn't matter. The
[2:08:37] question is, is your church on fire? I'm
[2:08:40] talking about this one. I'm talking
[2:08:43] about this church right here. Are the
[2:08:46] believers in this church on fire for the
[2:08:49] word? Are we just another carbon copy of
[2:08:53] one believer who left one assembly that
[2:08:55] sat in another assembly? It was dead
[2:08:57] over there, dead over here, dead
[2:08:59] wherever you go.
[2:09:02] But the church of the living God is on
[2:09:06] fire for the word.
[2:09:08] The word of the Lord means something to
[2:09:11] that believer.
[2:09:13] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:16] Now there's a great falling away but
[2:09:18] there has to come this lukewarm
[2:09:21] condition is that falling away. So my
[2:09:25] you know we might neglect the
[2:09:27] oldfashioned meeting. We might neglect
[2:09:29] to feel the Holy Spirit in our some of
[2:09:32] us don't even pray for the service like
[2:09:34] we should. Not that you mean to be bad
[2:09:37] but you've neglected to do that that 30
[2:09:39] minutes before the service to pray for
[2:09:42] the song leader. Pray for the
[2:09:44] worshippers. Pray for the instruments
[2:09:46] and the music. What is that? Is that
[2:09:49] only the pastor's job? No. Every
[2:09:52] believer has a responsibility
[2:09:56] to call on God for your church.
[2:10:01] That the Holy Ghost would have his way.
[2:10:07] Pray for the meeting. Pray for the
[2:10:09] altar. Pray that somebody get filled
[2:10:11] with the Holy Ghost. I mean, be honest
[2:10:12] with yourself. You're sitting there. God
[2:10:14] bless your heart. Be honest with
[2:10:16] yourself. When was the last time you
[2:10:17] prayed for someone to receive the Holy
[2:10:20] Ghost?
[2:10:23] Now, I don't know. I know many of you
[2:10:24] pray that. I thank the Lord for you. I'm
[2:10:27] not talking to you. I'm talking to the
[2:10:28] ones that have not prayed that. I just
[2:10:31] want to make you aware of that. That
[2:10:33] That is a prayer that you can pray that
[2:10:36] will actually help somebody.
[2:10:39] That's a prayer that somebody needs to
[2:10:43] pray that will actually help somebody.
[2:10:53] The great falling
[2:10:55] away. Paul promised it in the last days.
[2:10:58] Paragraph
[2:11:00] 92 by the Holy Spirit that the church
[2:11:03] will fall away. Millions of them. There
[2:11:06] will come a falling away, for men will
[2:11:08] be heady, high-minded, lover of pleasure
[2:11:11] more than lovers of God, truce breakers,
[2:11:13] false accusers, incontinent despisers of
[2:11:16] those that are good. Not the right
[2:11:19] discernment. Well, you say that's
[2:11:21] communism. That's so-called
[2:11:23] Christian. Watch the next verse. Having
[2:11:25] a form of godliness, but denying the
[2:11:27] power thereof, no spiritual
[2:11:31] discernment. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:34] Paul said those days would be we got it.
[2:11:37] It's here. It's on us and we look and
[2:11:41] see it. We hear it from everywhere.
[2:11:44] What do we do? It ought to draw us
[2:11:47] together.
[2:11:48] The Bible said, "Assembling ourselves
[2:11:50] together, the more that we see the day
[2:11:52] approaching, it ought to be one revival
[2:11:55] after another and bonfires of God's
[2:11:58] glory built in every church, every
[2:12:01] place. A great coming together where all
[2:12:04] the churches, one heart, one accord,
[2:12:06] assemble themselves together. Can I
[2:12:09] close right here?
[2:12:12] Oh, keep going. All right. And forget
[2:12:14] their main their man-made theology and
[2:12:18] cry out to God for spiritual power and
[2:12:22] spiritual discernment. That's the hour
[2:12:25] we need.
[2:12:28] Spiritual power, spiritual discernment.
[2:12:30] Paragraph 224 in the message, a
[2:12:32] testimony of a true witness. His word
[2:12:35] testifies in the last days that there
[2:12:37] will come a falling away. And there will
[2:12:39] come up a cold, formal, powerless church
[2:12:44] age. That's what we're living in. A
[2:12:46] church that had no
[2:12:49] power. Having a form of godliness, but
[2:12:51] denying the power thereof. From such
[2:12:54] turn
[2:12:56] away. A preacher with no power. Song
[2:13:00] specials, no power. Sermons, no power.
[2:13:04] Young people, no power. Old people, no
[2:13:07] power. Altars, no power. Bible, no
[2:13:10] power. Tapes, no power. In their life is
[2:13:14] no power. But there is a power of God in
[2:13:18] this word.
[2:13:23] And that's the power we want.
[2:13:26] That's the power that we need.
[2:13:29] the great falling
[2:13:30] away and these fellows with their
[2:13:33] ministries and their influence. Notice
[2:13:37] some of these great men that have fallen
[2:13:39] away. I'm talking about us locally. I'm
[2:13:41] talking about message ranks and the
[2:13:43] message circles how they've fallen
[2:13:45] away. That's 10 years ago, 15 years ago,
[2:13:49] 2014 and 2020. And you see this just
[2:13:53] blossom out of these ministries that
[2:13:58] disbelieve God. The podcasts are out
[2:14:00] now. There's p multiple podcasts that
[2:14:04] you click up the the Reverend William
[2:14:06] Brandham and it's a lot of garbage on
[2:14:09] there that that want you to sit down and
[2:14:11] listen to that. And you need to know
[2:14:13] that that that time was promised to be
[2:14:16] here and it is here. That's right.
[2:14:19] Wasn't like that when I came into the
[2:14:21] message. If you didn't believe it, you
[2:14:23] left quietly or you went over to the
[2:14:25] world or went to the Baptist. Now they
[2:14:27] leave with a ministry to attack the
[2:14:30] message. Tell me that ain't the word of
[2:14:33] God. That is the word. It's being
[2:14:35] fulfilled right before our eyes.
[2:14:38] But so, so what should we do as
[2:14:40] believers? We have to know that these
[2:14:42] things exist.
[2:14:45] Mhm.
[2:14:47] Say, "Lord, deliver us from wicked and
[2:14:48] unreasonable men, their podcast, their
[2:14:52] ministries,
[2:14:54] what they got to say about it. I'm not
[2:14:57] interested in what they have to say
[2:14:58] about it." Huh?
[2:15:02] They going to keep talking. Let them
[2:15:04] talk. I don't want to hear it. I don't
[2:15:06] need to hear it.
[2:15:08] I found something that changed my life,
[2:15:10] Brother Will.
[2:15:11] I found something that makes me feel
[2:15:13] great.
[2:15:15] I feel satisfied in my soul. I feel like
[2:15:19] I'm going on with the Lord.
[2:15:23] I'm time to stop and listen to no
[2:15:25] garbage.
[2:15:28] These fellows that take away the message
[2:15:31] from their pullpits, they take it away
[2:15:33] slowly. They take away the stories, the
[2:15:35] visions, they can't explain them. So the
[2:15:36] the vision was false.
[2:15:39] I'm going to get quiet here just for a
[2:15:41] minute. Brother B, I'm talking about a
[2:15:43] tent vision and it's become a a a word
[2:15:46] of controversy. Oh, brother, I know
[2:15:48] where you stand. You went to brother so
[2:15:50] and so. I know where you come from.
[2:15:51] Okay, I'm watching you now. I'm good.
[2:15:54] Keep watching. Yeah. Yeah. Where is it
[2:15:57] at on the tape?
[2:15:59] Where is it at in the scripture? It's on
[2:16:02] the tape. It's on your tapes.
[2:16:06] So why you stop quoting them? Why you
[2:16:08] stop reading them? Because some preacher
[2:16:10] said there was a group that did this and
[2:16:12] did that. I don't have that. Is not my
[2:16:15] responsibility. What some unbeliever or
[2:16:17] some group called it whatever.
[2:16:21] Coined the phrase return ministry. We're
[2:16:23] part of the return ministry. What's the
[2:16:25] return ministry? What is that? Give me
[2:16:28] the quotations.
[2:16:29] Give them to me. I want to say amen.
[2:16:31] Help. Hurry up. Amen.
[2:16:34] I don't know why that just turns people
[2:16:36] off so bad.
[2:16:39] It's a vision.
[2:16:41] And it's okay if you don't know where
[2:16:43] I'm going. I would be quiet, too. I'm
[2:16:45] the same. I'm the same way, too. I would
[2:16:47] tighten up. Be like, "Okay, where he
[2:16:48] going with this? How far you going to go
[2:16:49] with this?" What I'm saying is this. Go
[2:16:52] get the tape where brother Brandham
[2:16:55] talked about it and then say amen to
[2:16:58] that, not the other groups and other the
[2:17:01] churches that did this and brother so
[2:17:02] and so. They did this. That is not your
[2:17:05] responsibility. But where can we go for
[2:17:09] you alone have the words of eternal
[2:17:13] life.
[2:17:15] Eat my flesh. Drink my blood. That don't
[2:17:16] make no sense. What you talking about?
[2:17:17] Why'd he heal me now? Then the Lord
[2:17:19] called it home. Why? That don't make any
[2:17:20] sense. Where you going to go?
[2:17:23] Amen. Where you going?
[2:17:25] Where Reverend so and so explain all of
[2:17:27] that. Okay. Keep riding with that and
[2:17:28] find out where Reverend so and so is
[2:17:30] taking you.
[2:17:34] Reverend so and so that's not
[2:17:35] vindicated. No vision. No pillar of
[2:17:37] fire. No cloud in 63
[2:17:41] might be backslid in 5 years. We don't
[2:17:43] even know about Reverend so and so
[2:17:46] because they've come and they've gone.
[2:17:48] But this message is true.
[2:17:52] And my responsibility to you is to stay
[2:17:56] with that message
[2:17:59] with or without an explanation.
[2:18:04] It's true. I don't agree with the
[2:18:06] brothers that run off and said this
[2:18:08] means this and this is going to happen
[2:18:09] yet and you know we have this and we you
[2:18:11] know brother Bam's going to come and do
[2:18:13] this and do that. If it ain't got no
[2:18:15] close to it. That's right, brother
[2:18:17] Randy. I just tell them keep moving.
[2:18:20] Just keep keep on moving. It's okay. I
[2:18:23] love you. We can have a hamburger
[2:18:25] together. Fine. No problem. Nothing
[2:18:27] personal at all. But if it ain't on them
[2:18:30] tapes, why you want me to say amen to
[2:18:32] something that ain't on the tapes?
[2:18:34] Right. Right. But if it is on the tapes,
[2:18:37] why can't I preach it at the any pullpit
[2:18:45] all through the Bible? Stay away from
[2:18:46] that subject. What subject? Oh, chapter
[2:18:50] whatever in the Bible. Stay away from
[2:18:52] that. Oh, it's it's in the Bible, right?
[2:18:55] You got to preach what's in that word.
[2:18:57] And the prophet God gave us a message
[2:18:59] and there's several
[2:19:01] places that we can't explain. But where
[2:19:04] are you going?
[2:19:08] They started this seed of believing the
[2:19:10] Bible.
[2:19:12] some of these fellows that have left and
[2:19:16] they impregnated the people that your
[2:19:19] Bible is here and then the message is
[2:19:21] here
[2:19:23] and then you know put the Bible first
[2:19:25] and the messenger well why don't you
[2:19:26] just move the message along and just go
[2:19:28] with the Bible you know why you won't
[2:19:31] cuz that's what the Baptist is doing
[2:19:32] that's what the Presbyterian are doing
[2:19:34] that's what they all been doing
[2:19:36] following the Bible following Jesus
[2:19:40] that's what they've been Go in.
[2:19:47] Lord have mercy. But this hour would
[2:19:49] come. He said it would come that
[2:19:52] this great apost can I take three more
[2:19:55] minutes.
[2:19:58] Well, if I can take three, surely I can
[2:20:00] take five.
[2:20:04] Please don't nobody get
[2:20:07] up. I arrested you right there. All
[2:20:09] right. No, we're going to close right
[2:20:10] there. God bless you. Just one moment. I
[2:20:13] want to read this for you here in the
[2:20:18] message. There's two places I want to
[2:20:28] get. Brother Madam deals with this great
[2:20:30] falling away and convincing than
[2:20:34] concern.
[2:20:37] Paragraph 65. Now, we're living in a
[2:20:41] terrible time. We're living in a time of
[2:20:44] a great falling away. We know that. We
[2:20:47] are aware. Drop down to paragraph 70.
[2:20:50] Same message. Now, this falling away is
[2:20:53] a lack of
[2:20:55] concern for the body of
[2:20:58] Christ. I believe that maybe that right
[2:21:01] the right thing hasn't been presented.
[2:21:03] So many young students that would take a
[2:21:05] call in life sees so many fail see so
[2:21:09] many failures out here and really see
[2:21:11] the order and the program of the day has
[2:21:13] failed not Christ hasn't failed but the
[2:21:16] system that we have created has failed
[2:21:19] Christ program hasn't failed but the
[2:21:22] people's system has failed prophet of
[2:21:25] God continues in a message convincing
[2:21:28] concern 1962 paragraph number number
[2:21:32] nine we find out today that there is
[2:21:34] such a falling away. It seems to be that
[2:21:37] people are not interested like they used
[2:21:40] to be. They are falling away from the
[2:21:43] fundamental facts of the
[2:21:46] Bible. They seem to be
[2:21:49] drifting. And I think all ministers who
[2:21:52] love the word of God and know that
[2:21:54] that's the only standard in which we can
[2:21:57] be assured that we're right. It's not
[2:22:00] upon some theory but upon the word of
[2:22:02] God. That's the only
[2:22:05] basis. Paragraph 10, the same message.
[2:22:08] Today we find though that the people get
[2:22:11] away. They get away from the word. Get
[2:22:13] away from the interest. There seems to
[2:22:16] be not very much interest in it. Find
[2:22:18] that even amongst even our own people.
[2:22:20] The people full gospel people. We come
[2:22:22] to a spot that we're overfed. And
[2:22:25] brother Bam continues on. used to be
[2:22:27] after the service that people would be
[2:22:29] talking about the
[2:22:30] word at the Wednesday night people would
[2:22:32] leave and go out in somebody's home and
[2:22:34] talk about the word be talking about the
[2:22:37] message the conversations out there
[2:22:40] would be about the word I remember that
[2:22:43] how many saints remember that now people
[2:22:45] go home so quick or if they're talking
[2:22:47] it's about some joke and laugh just come
[2:22:49] out of the pull pit just come out of the
[2:22:51] atmosphere and nobody's talking about
[2:22:53] the word anymore
[2:22:55] poor. It's very interesting. A lack of
[2:22:58] concern,
[2:23:00] not interested. But now if we have, you
[2:23:03] know, we have a a hot dog bar in a
[2:23:06] coffee station and we have all that,
[2:23:08] then people are interested or a
[2:23:10] volleyball team or some kind of worldly
[2:23:12] attraction just like the denominations
[2:23:14] have, then the people will be
[2:23:15] interested.
[2:23:17] But it's a lack of concern. But Lord,
[2:23:19] help us. They're falling away from the
[2:23:22] fundamental facts of the Bible.
[2:23:25] Paragraph 173. Oh, can't you see the
[2:23:28] whole thing's facing right into the
[2:23:31] church getting unless there come a
[2:23:33] fallen way, the man of sin can't reveal
[2:23:35] himself. The communist, the lukewarmness
[2:23:38] of the church, the
[2:23:40] insignificance walk around God. God have
[2:23:45] mercy. So, he's bringing that
[2:23:47] insignificant.
[2:23:53] lukewarmness of the
[2:23:58] church. Let me take this last one in
[2:24:00] paragraph 117 in the handwriting on the
[2:24:03] wall. He says this here. I'll give them
[2:24:06] time to get to this because I want to
[2:24:07] land on this thought here as I've laid
[2:24:10] it out or tried to lay out this spirit
[2:24:15] of
[2:24:17] apostasy. This great falling away. No
[2:24:19] wonder there's a falling away. And what
[2:24:22] does the pastors know? They don't know
[2:24:24] what the cause of it. They are the cause
[2:24:29] of
[2:24:29] it. So he nails the ministry right
[2:24:33] there. And these bigname preachers and
[2:24:36] pastors, many of these
[2:24:38] pastors, many of them that have fallen
[2:24:40] away, if you go back and listen to what
[2:24:43] they preached when they quote unquote
[2:24:45] believed, they planted an intellectual
[2:24:47] seed. They were preaching it all along.
[2:24:49] And then they're preaching it was
[2:24:51] they're trying to prove the prophet and
[2:24:52] then and it wasn't he wasn't 100% right.
[2:24:55] It was like 95% right. You know he got
[2:24:58] this wrong and that was wrong but all of
[2:25:00] the seven seals was correct and this was
[2:25:01] right. That's what the seed was even
[2:25:03] years ago. And then when they backslid
[2:25:06] they planted that seed where you got to
[2:25:08] prove every when did you ever stand
[2:25:09] against a prophet? Who can judge a
[2:25:12] prophet? Either he is or he isn't. But
[2:25:15] if he is, who can stand against him? Why
[2:25:18] we playing his tapes if it ain't all
[2:25:20] right? Why would God move the ages all
[2:25:23] the way through the church age and all
[2:25:24] the way into perfection and then at the
[2:25:26] last day drop a vision in that failed?
[2:25:30] It don't make no
[2:25:32] sense. Don't make no sense.
[2:25:36] Every vision under first, not one time
[2:25:38] was there an error. All the prayer
[2:25:40] lines, thousands of people coming up.
[2:25:42] He's weary. He's tired. Different
[2:25:44] countries, different cities. Give him a
[2:25:46] prayer line. calling the name
[2:25:48] discernment for years. Not one mistake.
[2:25:53] 60s, 40s, all the way up. 64, 63, 65,
[2:25:57] all the way through. No mistakes.
[2:26:01] It's on the tapes. He boldly said it
[2:26:03] from the pull pit. Nobody said nothing.
[2:26:07] Perfect ministry. And then when he
[2:26:09] passes away, oh, we found a mistake. You
[2:26:12] found a mistake. Not but not God.
[2:26:16] God don't make no mistakes.
[2:26:20] It's to eat your flesh, drink my blood.
[2:26:22] That's what that is.
[2:26:26] You're mad because you can't explain
[2:26:29] it. Because you got to stand before your
[2:26:32] people and say, you know, this right
[2:26:33] here, I don't know, but the prophet said
[2:26:37] it, that settles it. Not a lot of
[2:26:40] preachers can do that. I know that. Not
[2:26:43] a lot of preachers can do that. And so I
[2:26:45] am sure that these well-known brothers
[2:26:48] that when I I'm I'm doing this for a
[2:26:50] reason, saints. Don't rush me. All
[2:26:51] right, I'm gonna close right now. I'm
[2:26:53] doing this for a reason. You know, I am
[2:26:55] sure that these well-known brothers with
[2:26:58] their big ministries that have fallen
[2:27:01] that that spirit that caused them to do
[2:27:04] it went to other churches too
[2:27:08] and went to other ministries too.
[2:27:12] This is why I appreciate an elder that
[2:27:16] stood his ground and stayed with the
[2:27:18] word because he heard it before. He
[2:27:22] heard the same errors that they heard,
[2:27:24] but they stayed with the word. And I
[2:27:27] say, "Thank God for them." God bless
[2:27:30] them. All of the elders that stayed with
[2:27:32] this message. Amen. You think they
[2:27:36] didn't hear the foolishness? They hear
[2:27:38] more than they tell you. Yes. And that
[2:27:41] spirit went around and has caused this
[2:27:43] one to fall, that one to stumble. Do you
[2:27:45] think they stop falling or will there be
[2:27:47] another one
[2:27:50] soon? Can we
[2:27:52] prophesy? Can we
[2:27:54] just without any inspiration? There'll
[2:27:57] be others that fall. As long as long as
[2:27:59] we continue, there'll be other big names
[2:28:01] that fall. It has to be. There'll be a
[2:28:05] great falling away first. Amen. Part of
[2:28:09] it is the lack of concern. Part of it's
[2:28:11] the lukewarmness of the church, the
[2:28:13] coldness. Part of it's the neglect of
[2:28:15] what God has given you. Look at the
[2:28:17] basics of Christianity. We've neglected
[2:28:19] to teach that to our young people.
[2:28:21] People getting married, don't have the
[2:28:23] Holy Ghost. Thinking about dating
[2:28:24] somebody, don't have the Holy Ghost.
[2:28:26] Remember George Smith's testimony? How
[2:28:27] many remember his testimony? He wanted
[2:28:29] to marry Rebecca. And brother Bam says,
[2:28:31] "That'll be fine, but don't think about
[2:28:32] getting married until you receive the
[2:28:35] How many remember that? until you
[2:28:36] receive the Holy You can engage her, but
[2:28:38] don't get married until you receive the
[2:28:40] Holy Ghost. And then one day down in
[2:28:41] Texas, he received it.
[2:28:45] Wasn't no gradual awakening. He received
[2:28:48] something.
[2:28:50] It was an event that happened to him. He
[2:28:54] said, "Brother Bannon was the first one
[2:28:55] that called
[2:28:56] him." How many remember the testimony?
[2:29:01] Yeah. I don't support everything that
[2:29:04] other brothers say, but I like that
[2:29:05] testimony. It's a good one.
[2:29:08] Talking this way. Somebody want to get
[2:29:10] married and don't have the Holy Ghost.
[2:29:13] Haven't read marriage and divorce. Want
[2:29:14] to get married? Are you
[2:29:17] serious? A pilot want to go fly an
[2:29:20] airplane and you haven't been to pilot
[2:29:21] school? No, thank you. I'm not
[2:29:23] interested. Just stop talking. You
[2:29:25] haven't been to pilot school? Stop
[2:29:26] talking. I'm gone. I don't want to hear
[2:29:28] what it's like this. Well, it's like
[2:29:29] this. There is like nothing. If you
[2:29:32] haven't been to school to get the
[2:29:33] training, you have no business
[2:29:36] going to nobody's altar, going into
[2:29:38] courtship, going into dating if you have
[2:29:41] not received the Holy Ghost. And it's my
[2:29:46] fault for not reminding you of that.
[2:29:51] There's a number of message folks that
[2:29:54] were raised in the message and I I know
[2:29:56] a number of them and their own testimony
[2:29:59] was I didn't even think about I didn't
[2:30:02] even think about receiving the Holy
[2:30:03] Ghost
[2:30:05] or the marriage and divorce sermon. Why
[2:30:08] would I want to listen to that? I'm in
[2:30:09] love.
[2:30:14] How long the in love last? Somebody tell
[2:30:16] me how long that in love, that glary,
[2:30:19] you know that stupid love, how long does
[2:30:22] that
[2:30:27] last? And so whose fault is it? It's the
[2:30:29] ministry's fault. Starts at the pullpit.
[2:30:32] That's why the pastor needs the Holy
[2:30:35] Ghost and the assistant pastors and the
[2:30:39] young people and the song servants, even
[2:30:42] the janitors. We want them filled with
[2:30:44] the Holy Ghost, too. You want to come
[2:30:45] clean our church? Here's a requirement.
[2:30:48] Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[2:30:51] you you can't even take out the trash
[2:30:55] until you receive the Holy Ghost? What
[2:30:58] if that was a
[2:30:59] requirement? God have mercy upon us.
[2:31:02] Talking about God's church, the great
[2:31:04] purge.
[2:31:06] Neglect not these great things.
[2:31:10] You know, and I close with the musicians
[2:31:12] would
[2:31:13] come. He said it was Paul promised it.
[2:31:16] He talked about the cold formal church,
[2:31:18] the
[2:31:19] powerless. He talked about it's a
[2:31:22] terrible time, the lack of concern,
[2:31:25] falling away from the fundamentals of
[2:31:26] the Bible, falling away from the word.
[2:31:29] talked about the lukewess
[2:31:32] lukewarmness and
[2:31:35] then they fell
[2:31:39] away from the spiritual feast. He
[2:31:46] says,
[2:31:48] "Huh? They fell away from the spiritual
[2:31:52] feast." That's a
[2:31:55] quotation. Can I read one more? Saints
[2:32:00] Is your life worthy of the gospel?
[2:32:01] Paragraph number
[2:32:08] 70. God bless you
[2:32:11] richly. One of the great ambitions
[2:32:13] somebody give me the paper just now,
[2:32:15] this new pope has said, is to unite the
[2:32:18] churches together. They'll do it just as
[2:32:21] certain as I'm standing here. And the
[2:32:24] Protestants fall for it. See, because
[2:32:27] the church, the Bible says, Paul, the
[2:32:30] prophet of the Lord says, "That day will
[2:32:32] not come except there coming a falling
[2:32:35] away first. Then before the man of sin
[2:32:38] will be revealed, he that siteth in the
[2:32:40] temple of God, upholding himself, all
[2:32:43] that's above God, he as God, forgiving
[2:32:46] sins of the earth, and so forth, how
[2:32:48] that this thing happened." But it
[2:32:50] couldn't happen until the falling
[2:32:54] away, until the church began to get away
[2:32:58] from the spiritual
[2:33:01] feast. Draw itself back and organize
[2:33:04] itself. Then the revelation didn't stay
[2:33:08] with the church. We've gotten away from
[2:33:10] that spiritual feast, the things
[2:33:13] that that
[2:33:16] that prepares you for the rapture.
[2:33:20] those very deep hidden truths. The
[2:33:23] mysteries of Revelations 10, the third
[2:33:26] pool, the son of man ministry,
[2:33:30] all of those beautiful being sealed in
[2:33:32] the stature of a perfect man
[2:33:35] that those things are important things.
[2:33:37] They they're all underneath that seven.
[2:33:39] So that's the spiritual feast that we're
[2:33:40] under and we don't want to get away from
[2:33:43] that. They we've increased in
[2:33:45] activities. There's more activities for
[2:33:47] our youth and for church people more
[2:33:49] than ever. And some have swapped the
[2:33:52] Holy Ghost feast for the activities.
[2:33:57] But I thank God for the activities. But
[2:33:59] we we have a spiritual feast here that
[2:34:02] we have a responsibility to. God bless
[2:34:04] you. Let us
[2:34:07] pray. Lord Jesus, we ask your
[2:34:10] blessings upon the people here, the
[2:34:13] people of God.
[2:34:16] those saints in Phoenix, Lord, and the
[2:34:18] different ones we stream the service.
[2:34:20] May you bless them and help them as
[2:34:22] well. May each one that's gathered in
[2:34:26] your name receive from
[2:34:28] you, Lord, these few
[2:34:30] moments
[2:34:32] of calling upon
[2:34:35] uh the word to come forth in our midst
[2:34:38] to
[2:34:39] circumcise our hearts, our ears, our
[2:34:43] expectations, our neglectfulness.
[2:34:46] Lord, Moses neglected it. Joshua
[2:34:51] neglected it. And Lord, many of us have
[2:34:54] neglected it. But Lord, we not
[2:34:57] purposefully. Lord, I don't believe we
[2:35:00] just haven't been made aware like we
[2:35:02] should
[2:35:03] have. Please help us, we pray.
[2:35:07] Grant a outpouring of your Holy
[2:35:10] Spirit to every one of us, Lord. We
[2:35:13] desire it with all of our hearts. I
[2:35:17] desire it, Lord. May you send it forth
[2:35:20] in Jesus name.
[2:35:24] Amen. All the
[2:35:26] way. I'm going all the way. Yes. I'm
[2:35:32] going all the way with the
[2:35:39] Lord. Going
[2:35:42] all the way. Oh yes. I'm going on.
[2:35:49] Going
[2:35:51] all the
[2:35:52] way. I am going all the way.
[2:35:58] Going
[2:36:00] all the way. Oh Lord, I'm going on.
[2:36:06] I am going on the way with the
[2:36:13] Lord. No turning back. No turn.
[2:36:19] Oh no, I'm going.
[2:36:25] No,
[2:36:26] turn me
[2:36:28] back. I am going all the way. No more
[2:36:35] turn me back. Yes, I'm going all the
[2:36:41] way.
[2:36:43] I am going all the way with the Lord.
[2:36:49] Made my
[2:36:51] decision. I made my
[2:36:55] decision and I'm going
[2:36:59] on. Yes, I made my
[2:37:04] decision. Yes, I'm going all the way.
[2:37:09] Hallelujah. I made
[2:37:14] Oh,
[2:37:18] yes. I'm
[2:37:20] going all the way with the Lord. No
[2:37:25] turning
[2:37:26] back. Oh, no
[2:37:29] turning back.
[2:37:31] [Music]
[2:37:36] No
[2:37:38] turning back.
[2:37:43] Oh,
[2:37:44] hallelujah. No
[2:37:47] turn
[2:37:49] back. I'm going all the
[2:37:53] way. Yes. I'm going all the way with the
[2:38:00] Lord. Going all the way.
[2:38:04] going
[2:38:05] on way
[2:38:07] with my
[2:38:10] Lord. Yes, I'm
[2:38:14] going
[2:38:16] way. Amen. Let's bow our heads for a
[2:38:20] moment. You know, this afternoon there
[2:38:22] will be a
[2:38:23] baptism. One young one one sister
[2:38:26] believer, she might be in streaming the
[2:38:28] service in Mesa. She was here with us
[2:38:30] for a month or so, couple months, and we
[2:38:33] were on that um marriage and
[2:38:36] divorce. And I offered the saints to go
[2:38:39] get that book. And so she got a copy of
[2:38:42] the book. She was raised in the message
[2:38:43] and she that that message began to
[2:38:47] turn her life
[2:38:50] around. She said she realized she needed
[2:38:53] to change her
[2:38:55] life. She had been baptized before. She
[2:38:57] was raised in the church, but just
[2:38:59] reading that brought an awareness to
[2:39:01] her. And she, Sister Dorcas, said she
[2:39:04] wants to be
[2:39:05] baptized. And now, you know how they're
[2:39:07] ready. This was Thursday night. I says,
[2:39:09] "When would you like to get baptized?"
[2:39:10] She said, "I'll do it right now. I want
[2:39:13] to be baptized." So, the Lord willing,
[2:39:16] they'll be here tonight for the service.
[2:39:18] Every head bowed, every eye closed,
[2:39:20] please.
[2:39:23] And
[2:39:24] um as you prepare your hearts for what
[2:39:27] the Lord has for
[2:39:29] you, if you need to be
[2:39:32] baptized, if you need to be saved,
[2:39:35] rededicate
[2:39:36] it, reconsecrate your
[2:39:40] [Music]
[2:39:41] life. That opportunity is here for you
[2:39:44] today. Right now, this morning,
[2:39:47] actually, you can be
[2:39:49] baptized. You can repent of your sin. be
[2:39:52] baptized and receive the Holy
[2:39:55] Ghost. Oh my, beautiful. The Lord Jesus
[2:40:00] has extended his grace and mercy to you
[2:40:05] today. And I would say, my brother, my
[2:40:07] sister, don't turn him away. Don't
[2:40:11] neglect the voice of the Lord.
[2:40:14] You're you're no doubt a good person in
[2:40:18] your heart and you don't want to do
[2:40:21] things that are
[2:40:23] wrong and God has been dealing with you.
[2:40:26] That's how he does and the enemy will
[2:40:29] cause you to, you know, put it off
[2:40:31] another time. Put it off. But today is
[2:40:34] the day of salvation for you. The Lord
[2:40:37] Jesus is dealing with your heart,
[2:40:39] dealing with your life.
[2:40:41] You can make that commitment to him
[2:40:44] right now. He'll receive
[2:40:47] you
[2:40:48] and you repent and then you be baptized
[2:40:53] and the Lord will fill you with the Holy
[2:40:55] Ghost. That's the promise of his word. I
[2:40:58] extend that offer to you
[2:41:00] today as we just pray. I just pray. Lord
[2:41:05] Jesus, those hearts that are here that
[2:41:09] need it in their
[2:41:11] life, oh God, I pray that they would
[2:41:15] make that decision, that they'll make it
[2:41:18] up in their
[2:41:19] mind, Father, to commit their life to
[2:41:23] you. It's you that brought them. It's
[2:41:26] you're the one that's teaching and
[2:41:28] leading them. Father, I pray that you
[2:41:31] would take them all the way. all the way
[2:41:34] with the word all the way through into
[2:41:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Father,
[2:41:42] we just ask for that. Lord, there's none
[2:41:45] like you. We give you the
[2:41:47] praise. We commit these these ones to
[2:41:50] you dealing with their
[2:41:53] hearts. Many many have been raised in
[2:41:56] this word, raised in the church, raised
[2:41:58] around it. They need a commitment. They
[2:42:00] need a they need a dedication. They need
[2:42:02] a gil gal.
[2:42:04] They need a
[2:42:05] circumcision. They need to be
[2:42:08] saved, oh God. And I pray that you'll
[2:42:11] save them
[2:42:13] today. Receive them
[2:42:15] today. In Jesus name I pray. Grant it,
[2:42:19] Father. Amen.
[2:42:24] Amen. All the
[2:42:28] way. Going on.
[2:42:33] Going all the way with the Lord. Let's
[2:42:38] all stand to our feet. Going
[2:42:42] all the way. Oh yes. I'm
[2:42:49] going. Going all the
[2:42:57] way. Going all
[2:43:01] All the
[2:43:03] way. Going all the
[2:43:07] way. I'm
[2:43:09] going all the way
[2:43:12] with the
[2:43:14] [Music]
[2:43:16] Lord. There is none like you. Let's sing
[2:43:19] that just before we
[2:43:22] go. I'm ask brother Josh to come and
[2:43:25] dismiss us in a word of prayer.
[2:43:28] There is none like
[2:43:34] you.
[2:43:36] Oh, no one
[2:43:39] else heart like you
[2:43:44] do. I can search for all eternity
[2:43:51] long and
[2:43:53] find. There is none like you. How many
[2:43:59] can testify that there's none like you?
[2:44:02] There is none like
[2:44:07] you. Nobody like Jesus.
[2:44:11] No one else can touch my heart like you
[2:44:19] do. I can search for all
[2:44:24] eternity
[2:44:26] [Music]
[2:44:28] long. There is none like
[2:44:34] you.
[2:44:36] Amen. Bless you, brother Josh. See you.
[2:44:39] Praise the Lord.
[2:44:41] Let's bow our heads.
[2:44:44] Heavenly Father, there truly is none
[2:44:45] like
[2:44:46] you. Lord, there's no joygiver like you.
[2:44:49] God have mercy. Lord, there's nobody who
[2:44:51] can touch our heart like you have.
[2:44:54] Father, you're we know your mercies to
[2:44:57] be new every morning, Lord. How you've
[2:45:00] treated us, how you've been to us, Lord.
[2:45:01] The message you've brought to us.
[2:45:03] There's no other message like it in the
[2:45:05] world. There's nothing else like hearing
[2:45:07] that voice, Lord. There's nothing like
[2:45:09] hearing those tapes like soaking it in,
[2:45:11] soaking the word of God deep into our
[2:45:13] hearts. And Father, we just never let
[2:45:16] that leave our hearts, that absolute
[2:45:18] that we have, that anchor that's been
[2:45:20] dropped. Lord, we're so thankful for
[2:45:22] what you've done in this
[2:45:24] age. Lord, nobody else could have done
[2:45:26] it. You sent somebody special to do it,
[2:45:28] and you've allowed us to have ears to
[2:45:29] hear it. You've allowed us to have eyes
[2:45:32] to see. What a blessing it is,
[2:45:35] [Music]
[2:45:36] Lord. There's churches out there that
[2:45:38] are suffering as we speak right now.
[2:45:40] Lord, pe people out there that are
[2:45:42] wondering, but Father, and nothing we've
[2:45:44] done in oursel, but Lord, you just
[2:45:46] blessed us so much to put us here to
[2:45:48] hear this word to see it. Father, Lord,
[2:45:51] we didn't deserve it, but you did it
[2:45:53] anyways.
[2:45:54] Lord, thank you so much for opening up
[2:45:56] our hearts, for giving us willing hearts
[2:45:59] to receive what you've given in this
[2:46:01] age. And Father, we love you and we
[2:46:04] thank you for your grace and your mercy.
[2:46:05] And Lord, we just ask that you would
[2:46:07] bless the service tonight, Lord. That
[2:46:09] your your presence would be here. And
[2:46:11] Lord, even in this closing song service,
[2:46:13] that your presence would be here. Lord,
[2:46:15] that your spirit would come and walk
[2:46:17] these aisles. Lord, that you would be
[2:46:18] amongst us. Lord, that as a song plays,
[2:46:20] Lord, you speak to each heart, every
[2:46:22] need that's here, Lord. We ask these
[2:46:25] things and the name above all names in
[2:46:29] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:46:32] Amen. Thank you, my brother. I'm going
[2:46:34] to ask the deacons to come. I'm sorry we
[2:46:36] didn't take that Tanzanian offering. We
[2:46:39] had a missionary offering we wanted to
[2:46:41] take
[2:46:43] for the work there in Tanzania. Brother
[2:46:47] Joshua, I've been there myself. I see
[2:46:49] the need there. And we're going to ask
[2:46:53] brother Joe and brother. Yeah, you have
[2:46:56] there. We're just quickly
[2:46:59] u bowheads for word of prayer.
[2:47:03] Lord Jesus, bless this offering and
[2:47:07] where it will go to. To the brothers in
[2:47:11] Morugoro,
[2:47:12] Tanzania, Father, for the work there. I
[2:47:15] see the burden and Lord, you've put it
[2:47:18] on our hearts to be
[2:47:22] missionaries. We can't go, but we
[2:47:25] support. We send. And Lord, we ask you.
[2:47:28] We know there's needs all over the
[2:47:30] world. Even in this city, even in
[2:47:33] there's the homes here, there's needs,
[2:47:35] financial needs, and little stresses and
[2:47:39] the things that we need in our life.
[2:47:43] Some health care and the different
[2:47:46] challenges we have. But oh God, you
[2:47:49] supply all of our needs. And we just ask
[2:47:52] you, Lord, to bless the gift and the
[2:47:55] giver. May you return to them a
[2:47:59] hundfold as they give to the kingdom of
[2:48:01] God. We know we're in the perfect will,
[2:48:04] your perfect will in this missionary
[2:48:07] effort. And Lord, we ask that you would
[2:48:11] bless this offering and let it expand
[2:48:14] and grow and meet the needs for which
[2:48:18] these precious souls are giving it to.
[2:48:23] Lord, the stewardship of it. We send it
[2:48:26] all in the mighty name of Jesus Christ
[2:48:29] we pray.
[2:48:31] Amen. Eternity
[2:48:36] long. There is none like you. None like
[2:48:42] you.

[2:48:56] touch or like you
[2:49:01] do. I can search for all
