[23:42] amen Revelation 8 verse one and when he
[23:46] had opened the seventh seal there was
[23:49] silence in heaven about the space of a
[23:52] half
[23:53] hour only
[23:56] believe only
[23:58] [Music]
[24:00] believe
[24:02] only
[24:05] believe all things are
[24:10] possible
[24:12] only
[24:15] believe
[24:16] only
[24:20] be
[24:22] [Music]
[24:24] only all things are possible
[24:30] [Music]
[24:33] only you may be seated
[24:57] brother
[25:27] e
[25:57] e

[30:23] behind the word of God come to the Earth
[30:26] the battle again
[30:28] Eve broke down the barrier from where
[30:30] she was uh isolated behind the word of
[30:34] God and from that very hour let down the
[30:37] bar Satan won the battle exctly how he
[30:40] won the battle over God's
[30:43] word his subject one of subjects let let
[30:46] down the bar from the word and that's
[30:48] exactly how he's won the battle every
[30:51] time and because one of his subjects let
[30:55] down the bar
[30:58] holy church the Living God and this last
[31:02] Church to an organizational system the
[31:05] word and the real genuine Holy Church of
[31:09] the Living God with a line riter would
[31:13] not accept the word and turn the church
[31:16] from the word to
[31:19] Dogma now how many knows that it's Dogma
[31:24] that the Roman Cath
[31:28] knew when here not long ago that Mary
[31:31] was resurrected you remember it here a
[31:33] few years ago about 10 years how many
[31:34] rememb is that papers sure everything
[31:37] the new Dogma see it's all Dogma not
[31:42] word a priest on an interview recently
[31:45] he said Mr Brandon he said God is in his
[31:47] church I said God is in his word
[31:50] amen he said we're not supposed to argue
[31:52] I I'm not arguing I'm just making
[31:55] statement amen God's in his word
[31:59] that's right anybody will take anything
[32:01] away from it or add anything to it said
[32:03] the
[32:04] word he said well God gave Christ gave
[32:07] his church power and told them whatever
[32:10] they bound on Earth be bound in heaven I
[32:12] said that is exactly truth he said we
[32:15] have on upon this principle that we have
[32:18] power to lose sin and I said if you'll
[32:20] do it the way that it was give to the
[32:22] church and the way they did it I'll
[32:24] accept it if you do there water here to
[32:26] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[32:27] for the remission of your sins not that
[32:29] somebody telling you your sins are
[32:31] remitted right that's exactly watch
[32:34] Peter with the keys on the day of
[32:35] Pentecost remember he has the keys that
[32:37] they're talking about and the the man
[32:39] said man and Brethren what can we do to
[32:42] be saved Peter said repent every one of
[32:44] you be baptized in the name of Jesus
[32:46] Christ what for for the remission of
[32:49] sins and then you shall receive the gift
[32:51] of the Holy Ghost for the promises into
[32:53] to you and your children them as far off
[32:56] even as many as the large Our God shall
[32:58] call that's right so that settles it
[33:01] forever it's all over that did it now
[33:05] but to see Antichrist come in as we
[33:08] pictured it and showed it what a
[33:10] revelation amen
[33:12] amen and the think all these years we'
[33:16] seen it moving up and here it's
[33:18] absolutely directly thus sayth the Lord
[33:23] hallelujah now and we notice this
[33:27] interval between the sixth and the
[33:30] seventh chapter
[33:32] now the seventh chapter of Revelation
[33:36] here is a uh reveals a
[33:40] happening it's not in here just for
[33:42] nothing it's not put in between this for
[33:44] nothing see it is here for a purpose and
[33:47] it's a revelation that reveals something
[33:50] notice how mysterious and how
[33:54] mathematically it fits right into the
[33:56] scripture
[33:58] exactly you believe in God's
[34:01] mathematics don't you're sure lost you
[34:03] sure get lost in the word if you start
[34:05] to putting a four or six or or something
[34:08] besides his mathematical words running
[34:11] in order you'll sure have in your scena
[34:14] cow picking grass on top of a tree
[34:16] somewhere you'll you certainly run out
[34:18] because God does not his whole word does
[34:21] run completely in in in mathematics yes
[34:26] perfect the most perfect there's no
[34:27] other literature written like it like it
[34:29] so perfect in MA mathematics now the the
[34:34] eth chapter only reveals the scene of uh
[34:39] the scene of the seventh seal where
[34:42] nothing else is revealed not nothing is
[34:46] not revealed in the seventh seal now has
[34:49] nothing to do with the seventh chapter
[34:51] of of Revelation it's uh revealing of
[34:56] the seven seal is perfectly mute and if
[35:00] I only have time I'll try a few places
[35:03] to show you all the way back from
[35:05] Genesis the seventh chapter the seven
[35:07] seal is is spoke
[35:09] of from the very beginning in
[35:13] Genesis the seven these seals move right
[35:16] up could you remember this morning
[35:18] bringing these things up and watch
[35:20] tonight bring them up and you find out
[35:22] when it gets to that seventh seal she
[35:23] cuts
[35:25] off Jesus Christ is speaking himself
[35:28] told of the end time and when he got
[35:30] told all SE six seals when he got the
[35:32] seven he
[35:34] stopped there it is see it's a great
[35:37] thing
[35:39] now
[35:40] now uh we're going to speak here now on
[35:43] this seventh chapter just a minute to
[35:46] kind of bridge it in between sixth and
[35:48] seventh seal because that's the only
[35:50] material that we have to go on right now
[35:53] is the six between the six and seven
[35:55] seal is it calling out
[35:58] of
[35:59] Israel now I have many fine Jehovah
[36:04] Witness friends sitting here it's all or
[36:08] have been maybe some of them still
[36:09] Jehovah Witness but they've always
[36:12] applied Mr Russell did this 144,000 to
[36:17] being the supernatural bride of
[36:19] Christ see it's not it has nothing to do
[36:24] in the church age at all it absolutely
[36:28] Israel now we're go to read in a few
[36:30] minutes now this interview between the
[36:34] six the seals is a calling and sealing
[36:38] of 144,000 Jews called in the
[36:43] tribulation period after the church is
[36:46] gone see has nothing to do with the
[36:49] church age at all all called in
[36:52] perfectly harmony with the scripture
[36:55] Daniel's last three and a
[36:59] weeks uh lotted to Daniel's
[37:03] people not the Gentiles to Daniel's
[37:07] people and Daniel was a
[37:10] Jew now
[37:13] notice Israel Israel believes only her
[37:19] prophets
[37:21] and after they are Vindicated and
[37:25] nowhere through the church age since in
[37:29] the early Apostolic church has the
[37:33] Protestant church ever had a
[37:36] prophet tell me who it was the
[37:39] shortcut never they had in the early
[37:43] Apostolic age one called
[37:46] actopus which was a Vindicated
[37:50] Prophet but in when the Gentiles came in
[37:54] into inheritance of God and Paul turn to
[37:59] the Gentiles after Peter as we read last
[38:01] night had received from the Lord that
[38:03] he's taken a a people from the Gentiles
[38:06] for his name his bride than they never
[38:09] has been on the pages of
[38:13] History a gentile
[38:16] Prophet you just go back through history
[38:19] and find out why exactly it be contrary
[38:23] to the
[38:25] word exactly when the first went forth
[38:28] was a line that was prophets word the
[38:32] next went forward was a work sacrifice
[38:34] the next come forth was a cunningness of
[38:36] of man but we are promised in the last
[38:41] day that to return to the church again
[38:44] for the benefit of straightening up all
[38:48] that has been Mis Mis undone left undone
[38:52] for it's predicted year that the seventh
[38:54] Angel's message would finish the the
[38:57] mysteries of
[39:00] God now we've went through it all we see
[39:02] that it's perfectly in harmony with the
[39:05] scripture that's the reason now could
[39:07] you imagine when this person comes on
[39:09] the
[39:10] scene when he does remember it'll be so
[39:14] humble and things the the churches will
[39:17] miss it a long ways and could you
[39:20] imagine the churches still under the
[39:22] tradition of the reformers would ever
[39:26] receive a pro Prophet from God who would
[39:29] be firmly against her teachings and
[39:32] organizations now there's only one
[39:34] person could fulfill that only one
[39:37] spirit's ever been on the earth that I
[39:39] know of would either be it would have to
[39:41] be Elijah in his time and it was
[39:45] predicted that it would be which is
[39:46] nothing but the spirit of Christ when
[39:49] Christ come he was a fullness he was a
[39:51] prophet he was a the god of the prophets
[39:56] AMJ Christ look how they hated him but
[40:00] he come exactly the way the word said he
[40:02] would come but being that he was a
[40:05] prophet they blasphemed themselves away
[40:07] from the kingdom of God by calling the
[40:10] spirit of God which was Discerning and
[40:12] so forth an unclean spirit said he was
[40:15] is a fortune teller a devil that's is a
[40:17] fortune teller is a devil see devil
[40:20] Spirit certainly do you know that
[40:23] absolutely fortune telling is an
[40:25] impersonation of the prophet which is
[40:28] absolutely blasphemy before God now
[40:33] notice
[40:34] called
[40:36] in perfect harmony with the scriptures
[40:39] of Daniel's last three and a half years
[40:42] notice Israel's believer Believers only
[40:47] are told in the Old Testament to believe
[40:50] their prophets after the prophet has
[40:53] been
[40:54] Vindicated if there be one among you who
[40:57] is spiritual or a prophet how the Lord
[41:01] my thy God will make myself known to him
[41:04] speak to him in
[41:05] Visions through dreams interpret dreams
[41:08] somebody have a dream a prophet will be
[41:10] able to interpret it and if if he has a
[41:13] vision he speaks it I'll make myself
[41:16] known to him through visions and
[41:20] dreams make myself KN and if what he
[41:23] says comes to pass then hear that
[41:26] prophet because I'm with him if it
[41:29] doesn't then don't fear him at all get
[41:31] away just let it alone see now that's
[41:34] now Israel always to go to believe that
[41:37] and don't you see because why I I want
[41:39] you to catch this lesson good tonight
[41:41] now why because that's an order from God
[41:45] to them amen I don't care how many
[41:49] tracks that the Gentiles get over there
[41:50] and spread out I don't care how much you
[41:53] go through Israel with a Bible earning
[41:55] your arm proving this that or other
[41:56] they'll never receive nothing but a
[41:59] prophet exactly right for a prophet is
[42:03] the only one who could take the Divine
[42:05] word and put it in his place and be a
[42:07] Vindicated Prophet they'll believe it
[42:10] right I was talking to a Jew up here at
[42:12] Benton Harbor when that John Ryan being
[42:15] blind all of his life nearly received
[42:17] his sight they take me over there that
[42:20] House of David and this uh Rabbi come
[42:22] out with his long beard he said but what
[42:24] Authority did you give John Ryan side I
[42:27] said in the name of Jesus Christ the son
[42:30] of God he said far be it from God having
[42:33] a son see and he said uh you people
[42:37] can't cut God in three pieces and give
[42:39] him to a Jew make three Gods out of him
[42:42] you're a bunch of heathens I said I
[42:43] don't cut him in three
[42:45] pieces
[42:47] amen I said Rabbi would it be a strange
[42:51] thing for you to believe one of your
[42:53] prophets told the something wrong he
[42:55] said our prophets don't tell me nothing
[42:57] wrong I said who was Isaiah 9 and6
[43:01] speaking of he said
[43:05] Messiah I said then Messiah will be a
[43:08] man Prophet is that right said yes sir
[43:11] that's right I said show me where Jesus
[43:14] missed it he said I said What relation
[43:17] will Messiah Prophet be to God he said
[43:21] he will be God I said that's right now
[43:24] you
[43:25] got so help me that Jew standing there
[43:30] and the tears rolling off his cheeks
[43:31] said I'll hear you sometime later I said
[43:33] Rabbi you believe that and he said look
[43:38] he said God is able these stones to rise
[43:41] children of Abraham I know he's in the
[43:42] New Testament I said right Rabbi now
[43:45] what about it he said if I preach that
[43:48] I'd be down there you know where the
[43:49] place sets on the hill there down there
[43:51] in the street begging my bread I said I
[43:54] would rather be down there begging my
[43:56] bread
[43:58] the Jew still got his hands on money you
[44:00] know I'd his name and gold on the I said
[44:03] I'd rather be down there eating salty
[44:06] crackers and drinking Branch water and
[44:08] know that I was in the harmony with God
[44:11] truth than I would be here my name on
[44:13] that building and go letters like that
[44:15] and know what I was away from God I know
[44:17] that you wouldn't listen to me no more
[44:19] so he want that's it you can't cut God
[44:21] no two or three pieces called father Son
[44:23] and Holy Ghost make three gods and hand
[44:25] it to a Jew it's very command
[44:27] is Thou shalt have no other gods before
[44:29] me I'm the Lord thy God why did Jesus
[44:32] say Jesus say hear you oh Israel I'm the
[44:35] Lord your God one God not three you'll
[44:38] never give that to him no no Prophet
[44:42] will ever talk about three
[44:45] gods word you never hear that no sir

[1:01:29] rolled
[1:01:31] away and it makes me
[1:01:35] happy glad and
[1:01:38] free I'll sing and shout it for he's
[1:01:42] everything to me amen let's give our
[1:01:46] Lord a hand of Praise this morning
[1:01:49] brother Sean if you want to make ready
[1:01:51] you may be seated
[1:01:59] hey God bless you happy to be in the
[1:02:00] house of the Lord just a bit of a
[1:02:03] testimony behind the song I'm about to
[1:02:07] sing I have it all written down so I
[1:02:09] don't get
[1:02:22] lost but my car was having problems so I
[1:02:24] took it to the mechanic and it was its
[1:02:26] uh it was a turbo and so I took it over
[1:02:30] there and over the weekend I went up
[1:02:33] with the Robson who were kind to take me
[1:02:37] up there to Flagstaff and we had a
[1:02:38] wonderful
[1:02:40] time us
[1:02:41] there and
[1:02:43] um so we took it to the mechanic over
[1:02:47] the weekend and then I got it back and
[1:02:49] it was it was running fine then but once
[1:02:51] I got to where I was going to my uh
[1:02:54] martial arts
[1:02:57] I the check engine light came on so I
[1:02:59] called the mechanic and he go and I told
[1:03:01] him and he goes really okay when can you
[1:03:04] get it to me I'll probably just get it
[1:03:05] to you tomorrow and he goes okay and
[1:03:08] then as I'm pulling out
[1:03:12] the I start kind of just pressing on the
[1:03:14] gas a little bit and then the turn and
[1:03:16] then my car just kind of just like
[1:03:18] starts shaking I'm over here going 20
[1:03:21] mil an hour while my RPMs is like in the
[1:03:24] fives
[1:03:25] and so I look behind me and then there's
[1:03:27] smoke coming out the back of my car and
[1:03:30] so I'm over here just on the side of the
[1:03:33] road while I'm waiting for my uncle and
[1:03:35] my grandfather to get
[1:03:39] there and so while I'm there I'm just
[1:03:41] thinking what's what's going on like
[1:03:45] Lord is this a test what's what do you
[1:03:49] what's going
[1:03:50] on and so we were going to take it to uh
[1:03:56] we were going to tow it but the towing
[1:03:59] was just too high especially late at
[1:04:01] night so we just left it in the parking
[1:04:03] lot
[1:04:04] overnight
[1:04:06] and I was singing this song to myself
[1:04:09] while I was waiting for my while I was
[1:04:11] waiting for my uncle and my grandfather
[1:04:13] and so after I was done singing Just to
[1:04:16] myself I felt led to pray over the
[1:04:18] vehicle so I walked around I put my
[1:04:19] hands on the hood and I just said God
[1:04:22] this is your vehicle you just you do
[1:04:25] what you want me to to should do with it
[1:04:26] if you want me to pay over $1,000 again
[1:04:28] I'll do it but
[1:04:31] then the next
[1:04:33] morning I
[1:04:35] get a call from my grandfather saying
[1:04:38] hey don't worry about it I'll pay for it
[1:04:40] you can pay me back later but then I get
[1:04:43] a text from the mechanic saying your
[1:04:45] Turbo's warranty you're not paying
[1:04:47] anything for the turbo it's all it's all
[1:04:50] paid for that's it and so

[1:22:02] something that he could open and reveal
[1:22:04] to us yet in this late hour I'm sure
[1:22:06] there's probably still some Hidden
[1:22:08] Truths there at least to me that he
[1:22:11] could open and and teach me and help me
[1:22:13] so don't just brush it off this morning

[1:23:59] possible
[1:24:02] Jesus is
[1:24:05] here amen you can be
[1:24:08] seated the seventh day messenger
[1:24:11] teaching in the seventh seal God bless
[1:24:13] you notice notice these prophets will
[1:24:17] come not only not only that the
[1:24:19] prophet Revelations 11 11 we've read
[1:24:23] some of it I want you to read as you
[1:24:25] study on the tapes and so forth they are
[1:24:27] absolutely Vindicated prophets by the
[1:24:29] sign of prophets then Israel's going to
[1:24:32] hear that now do you my Jehovah Witness
[1:24:36] friends understand now that
[1:24:39] these 144,000 has nothing to do with the
[1:24:44] bride there's not one bit of scripture
[1:24:46] to support that no it they're not they
[1:24:49] are
[1:24:51] Jews the elect is called out during the
[1:24:54] time time of the last three and a half
[1:24:57] years of Daniel's 70 weeks that's uh I
[1:25:01] keep quoting this so not so much to you
[1:25:03] all here but see people these tapes go
[1:25:05] everywhere see you understand that you
[1:25:07] hear me quoting back it's for that
[1:25:09] purpose notice now I see how they had to
[1:25:13] Blind do you see how they had Jesus or
[1:25:16] God had to Blind the Jews to keep them
[1:25:19] from recognizing Jesus if they knew if
[1:25:24] they only knew that that was seen the
[1:25:27] sign that he did if they had been in the
[1:25:29] right stage like it was back under the
[1:25:33] law what God commanded them about a
[1:25:36] prophet and they had seen Jesus did that
[1:25:38] they said this is the
[1:25:39] Messiah why was it those in that age who
[1:25:43] had their names written on the land's
[1:25:44] Book of Life his Apostles and so forth
[1:25:47] they seen it and recognize it what did
[1:25:49] the rest of
[1:25:51] them see they were blinded
[1:25:55] they couldn't see it they don't see it
[1:25:57] yet and they won't see it until she's
[1:26:00] born as a nation at one time am that the
[1:26:03] word Can't Fail remember the word Can't
[1:26:06] Fail don't care how many Sensations you
[1:26:08] have and what all takes place yet that
[1:26:11] word cannot fail it's going to be
[1:26:14] exactly the way God said it was see now
[1:26:18] we
[1:26:19] realize that these things must happen
[1:26:23] and that's the reason they didn't
[1:26:24] recognize Jesus when he perfectly
[1:26:26] identified himself to be the prophet
[1:26:29] even the little little Old Samaritan
[1:26:30] woman stand out there at the well he had
[1:26:33] never been in Samaria he just went up
[1:26:35] said he had need to go that way and he
[1:26:37] went up there and there's that little
[1:26:38] woman and heard her State she was in
[1:26:40] better shape to receive the Gospel than
[1:26:43] those religious priests and things of
[1:26:44] that day she
[1:26:47] done
[1:26:48] now Ze but in the face of all of their
[1:26:52] rejection yet one of their most noble
[1:26:55] man admitted that they knew he was a
[1:26:58] teacher sent from
[1:26:59] God I was talking to one of the finest
[1:27:02] doctors there is in the southern states
[1:27:05] in his office not long ago a very fine
[1:27:08] specialist in love a real Gallant man
[1:27:13] and I said to him I said Doctor I want
[1:27:17] to ask you a question said all right I
[1:27:20] said I notice your medical sign the
[1:27:23] staff
[1:27:24] you got a serpent wrapped around a pole
[1:27:28] what does that stand for said I don't
[1:27:31] know I said it stands or this it was a
[1:27:37] symbol of Divine Healing where Moses
[1:27:41] lifted up the brass serpent in the
[1:27:43] wilderness see which was only a
[1:27:47] symbol only a symbol of the true Christ
[1:27:51] now today medicine is a symbol of Divine
[1:27:56] Healing and though many of them don't
[1:27:58] believe it real good doctors do believe
[1:28:01] it but some of them don't believe it but
[1:28:05] the very emblem that they hold up
[1:28:08] testifies to the power of almighty God
[1:28:11] whether they want to believe it or not
[1:28:13] Hallelujah right there's a brass serpent
[1:28:15] hanging on a pole on the medical em now
[1:28:19] notice these
[1:28:21] Jews now the scales of
[1:28:25] blindness um was on these people's eyes
[1:28:29] they they couldn't help it it was there
[1:28:32] and God put it there and they are on
[1:28:35] there until the age at their promise uh
[1:28:40] this coming prophets you can send
[1:28:44] missionaries you can do whatever you
[1:28:46] want to Israel will never be converted
[1:28:50] until these prophets come on the scene
[1:28:52] and that will be after to the Rapture of
[1:28:55] the Gentile
[1:28:56] Church no more than the ox age could
[1:29:00] receive a lion's call for God has said
[1:29:03] in his word that a ox Spirit went out
[1:29:07] and in the reformers age a man went out
[1:29:11] see you just that's the only thing you
[1:29:13] they can receive that and in there and
[1:29:15] out they are
[1:29:18] blinded that's just all there is to it
[1:29:22] now notice but the age is coming when
[1:29:25] the Gentiles will be done with there's a
[1:29:28] tree and The Roots was Jewish and it was
[1:29:33] cut off and the Gentile was grafted in
[1:29:36] the wild olive tree and it's bringing
[1:29:39] forth its fruit now when that Gentile
[1:29:42] bride is cut off that bride tree I
[1:29:45] talked about and it's taken up in the
[1:29:47] presence of God God will wipe off them
[1:29:51] unbelieving Gentiles over here to the
[1:29:53] side the s sleeping virgin and graft
[1:29:55] again amen he promised to do it amen and
[1:29:59] until that
[1:30:01] time you just have to know where if you
[1:30:03] know where you're going well all right
[1:30:05] if you don't know uh you're stumbling in
[1:30:07] darkness now that's when the Jews will
[1:30:11] be converted during that age now like
[1:30:14] the church age under the power of the
[1:30:17] anointed
[1:30:19] promise They will receive Christ but now
[1:30:22] not while the Gentiles
[1:30:24] now we can see what kind of a message
[1:30:28] that these two prophets of Revelations
[1:30:30] 11th chapter will
[1:30:32] preach now you clearly can see exactly
[1:30:35] what they're going to
[1:30:36] do for the remnant are the 144,000
[1:30:41] predestinated receives the Seal of god
[1:30:44] let's just read now listen real
[1:30:48] closely I want you to read with me can't
[1:30:50] going going to refer back to this just
[1:30:51] in a little bit seventh chapter now this
[1:30:54] is between the sixth and seven
[1:30:56] seal after these things after these
[1:31:00] things these

[1:31:04] that's a tribulation period everybody
[1:31:05] understand that now Sixth Seal was let
[1:31:07] loose the tribulation onone after this
[1:31:10] watch after these things I saw four
[1:31:13] Angels standing on the four corners of
[1:31:15] the Earth holding the Four Winds of the
[1:31:18] earth that it should not blow upon the
[1:31:20] Earth or on the sea or on any tree Four
[1:31:25] Angels and I saw another
[1:31:27] Angel uh ascending from the East having
[1:31:31] the Seal of the Living God and he cried
[1:31:34] with a loud voice to the four angels to
[1:31:37] whom it was given to hurt the sea the
[1:31:40] Earth the sea saying hurt not the Earth
[1:31:43] neither the sea nor the trees until we
[1:31:46] have sealed the
[1:31:48] servants not the bride servants not the
[1:31:52] sons
[1:31:54] servants Israel has always been God's

[1:33:50] is what 144,000 now watch were all of
[1:33:55] the tribes of Israel now what after
[1:33:59] this now here comes another group now
[1:34:02] the bride's
[1:34:04] gone we know
[1:34:06] that but watch this group come
[1:34:09] up after this I beheld in law a great
[1:34:12] multitude which no man can number of all
[1:34:14] Nations kindreds and people in tongue
[1:34:17] stood Before the Throne and before the
[1:34:18] lamb clothed in white robes and Palms in
[1:34:20] their hand and cried with a loud voice
[1:34:23] voice saying salvation to our god which
[1:34:26] Seth upon a throne and to the lamb and
[1:34:29] all the nations stood around about the
[1:34:31] throne and about the Elder and the four
[1:34:34] beast and fell Before the Throne on
[1:34:36] their faces and worshiped God saying
[1:34:39] amen blessings Glory wisdom Thanksgiving
[1:34:42] honor power might be to our god forever
[1:34:45] and ever amen and one of the elders now
[1:34:48] he's before the elders here we've seen
[1:34:50] him all through the seals and one of the
[1:34:52] elders answered unto me what are these
[1:34:56] now John being a Jew recognized his own
[1:34:58] people he see him in tribal farm that
[1:35:01] right he recognized and called each one
[1:35:03] of the tribes but now when he sees these
[1:35:06] that he's kind of puzzled and the Elder
[1:35:09] knows it so he says uh who are these
[1:35:13] what which are arrayed in white uh robes
[1:35:16] and when cometh the John answering out
[1:35:20] and I said un him sir thou knowest John
[1:35:22] didn't know them the all Kinders tongues
[1:35:24] and Nations and he said unto me these
[1:35:28] are he said unto
[1:35:31] me uh these are they which come out of
[1:35:35] Great Tribulation in other words the
[1:35:37] Great
[1:35:39] Tribulation and have washed their robes
[1:35:42] made them white in the blood of the Lamb
[1:35:45] therefore they are Before the Throne of
[1:35:46] God and serve him day and night in his
[1:35:48] Temple and they he set upon a throne
[1:35:50] shall dwell among them they shall hunger
[1:35:52] no more neither shall they thirst
[1:35:53] anymore neither shall the sun light on
[1:35:56] them sun light on them or any heat for
[1:36:00] the lamb which is in the midst of the
[1:36:02] throne shall feed them and shall lead
[1:36:05] them un living Fountains of water and
[1:36:08] God shall wipe all tears from their eyes
[1:36:11] now we open the get to the seal did you
[1:36:14] notice they were first we start now
[1:36:17] Israel and then we see the purge church
[1:36:21] not the bride
[1:36:23] The Purge Church by
[1:36:27] tribulation coming up here great
[1:36:31] number of real sincere
[1:36:35] hearts that come up out of the Great
[1:36:38] Tribulation not the church it's gone on
[1:36:41] the rde there's the church now we find
[1:36:43] out over a little later Jesus said that
[1:36:46] the throne would set in how the that
[1:36:48] stand in the Judgment each one now we
[1:36:51] find now
[1:36:54] that these people were sealed with the
[1:36:57] Seal of the Living God is that right
[1:37:00] these
[1:37:02] Jews what is the Seal of the Living God
[1:37:06] now uh not calling any hurt any feelings
[1:37:09] of this saying see do you know that
[1:37:12] reading after many of Scholars who write
[1:37:16] on this
[1:37:17] claim that this group here Blood Washed
[1:37:22] are actually see the
[1:37:24] bride did you know that many scholars
[1:37:28] also claim that the 144,000 is a
[1:37:34] bride what a something got to fit out
[1:37:38] your wrong uh in your right because
[1:37:40] there's something wrong now notice our
[1:37:43] Adventist Brethren say that the Seal of
[1:37:47] God is keeping the Sabbath day you know
[1:37:50] that but I want one Speck of script
[1:37:53] scure on it sure that's Sabbath keeping
[1:37:57] the Sabbath day the Seal of God see it's
[1:38:00] just a a somebody draw that idea but if
[1:38:03] you read Ephesians
[1:38:05] 4:30 it says grieve not the holy spirit
[1:38:09] of God whereby you are sealed until the
[1:38:13] day you of your
[1:38:15] Redemption yes when the medal work is
[1:38:18] done and you are come Christ comes to
[1:38:21] redeem his own you're sealed not until
[1:38:24] the next
[1:38:27] Revival when you're once sealed with the
[1:38:29] Holy Ghost it's a finished work that God
[1:38:32] has received you and there's no getting
[1:38:34] away from it Hallelujah you said well I
[1:38:38] had it and I went wait oh you didn't
[1:38:40] have it God said it goes on to the day
[1:38:43] of
[1:38:44] redemption you just argue with him but
[1:38:47] me tell the day of your Redemption
[1:38:51] notice as there
[1:38:54] were as they were a Remnant according to
[1:38:59] election these Jews are now a Remnant
[1:39:03] according to election in the days of
[1:39:05] Elijah's first Ministry to the Jews were
[1:39:09] 7,000 Believers were kept Away by the
[1:39:12] hand of God now there is in this Remnant
[1:39:17] time coming to their time to be 144,000
[1:39:22] according to the
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:26] election that the message at that time
[1:39:30] to believe the message be
[1:39:34] 144,000 now you see oh now just a minute
[1:39:37] brother I don't know about this election
[1:39:40] stuff well I never read it there all
[1:39:43] right let me see if it's right now let's
[1:39:44] turn back to Matthew and um get down
[1:39:48] here and find out if we can't find a
[1:39:50] little something on this somewhere I
[1:39:52] believe now that I'm right I haven't got
[1:39:54] roll down here but just come to my
[1:39:57] mind let's take at the ending the 30th
[1:40:02] verse where we went last night the
[1:40:04] ending of the six seed on the 30th verse
[1:40:10] now let's read that and see now where we
[1:40:13] get to the 31st verse see they'll see
[1:40:16] the son of man coming in glory now the
[1:40:19] 31st verse and he shall send his angels
[1:40:23] with great sound of a trumpet and they
[1:40:25] shall gather together
[1:40:28] his
[1:40:31] elect from the Four Winds from one end
[1:40:35] of Heaven to the other amen amen the
[1:40:39] elected will come out what is it and the
[1:40:44] tribulation
[1:40:45] period the God will call his elected and
[1:40:49] that is the
[1:40:50] Jews during that time the elected the
[1:40:54] Bible speaks of it Paul speaks of it
[1:40:57] according to the election there will be
[1:41:00] 144,000 according to the election that
[1:41:03] will believe the message out of
[1:41:05] literally
[1:41:06] millions that'll be there there were
[1:41:10] millions in Palestine at the days of the
[1:41:13] prophecy of Elijah and 7,000 was saved
[1:41:16] out of
[1:41:17] millions now according to the election
[1:41:20] where millions of Jews are gathering in
[1:41:23] into the Homeland it's become a nation
[1:41:25] there'll be millions in there but only
[1:41:28] 144,000 elected ones will be taken they
[1:41:32] will hear the message same thing it is
[1:41:34] in the Gentile Church there is a bride
[1:41:37] and she is
[1:41:39] elected and he will be called according
[1:41:41] to the election
[1:41:44] notice this all types the church
[1:41:47] perfectly the elected Believers others
[1:41:50] do not believe
[1:41:53] you can just tell
[1:41:55] it you tell a man a
[1:41:58] truth and let it be proven by the word
[1:42:01] and then vindicate it I don't believe
[1:42:05] it you can just don't fool with it no
[1:42:07] more am Jesus said not to said this is
[1:42:10] like casting Pearls Before
[1:42:12] swines said just leave them alone
[1:42:14] they'll turn you on their feet to
[1:42:15] make fun of you just walk away and leave
[1:42:17] him if a blind leads a blind I went to a
[1:42:20] man not long he come to me rather
[1:42:23] been arguing all around everywhere
[1:42:24] against Divine Healing and he come up
[1:42:27] and he said I don't believe you're
[1:42:29] Divine Healing I said mine I guess
[1:42:32] wouldn't be any good because ain't got
[1:42:33] any and he I said but God's is
[1:42:37] perfect said there is no such a thing I
[1:42:39] said you're too late to say that
[1:42:41] buddy H you done you done wait too long
[1:42:43] for that you might have argued a few
[1:42:45] years ago but there's another age on
[1:42:48] now Millions to testify I said you're
[1:42:52] you're too late now
[1:42:53] to say that he said uh he said I don't
[1:42:56] believe it I don't care what you do I
[1:42:58] said certainly not you
[1:43:01] can he said smite me blind said if
[1:43:04] you're you got the Holy Ghost like Paul
[1:43:06] said smite me blind I said how can I do
[1:43:07] it when you're already
[1:43:11] blind I said your father has blinded
[1:43:15] you to the
[1:43:18] truth I said you you're already blind
[1:43:22] and he said uh I wouldn't believe I
[1:43:24] don't care what you could do how much
[1:43:26] evidence you could prove or anything
[1:43:28] like that I still don't believe I said
[1:43:29] certainly it wasn't for unbelievers it
[1:43:31] was only for
[1:43:33] believers what was it see you know right
[1:43:36] then the election's off just don't fool
[1:43:39] with it at all Jesus did the same thing
[1:43:41] he said let them alone the blind leads
[1:43:44] the blind won't they all fall in the
[1:43:45] ditch but when it come to a little
[1:43:47] prostitute it struck fire what was it
[1:43:50] there's an elected seed laying there see
[1:43:52] seen it right now when it come to Peter
[1:43:54] there was elected seed laying there see
[1:43:56] and they saw it and all the father has G
[1:43:59] half past tense giveing me they'll come
[1:44:03] they'll come to me oh my I love that yes
[1:44:06] sir notice the Believers does believe it
[1:44:10] the unbelievers can't believe
[1:44:13] it so now if anybody wants to argue
[1:44:15] about serpent seed and things and you
[1:44:16] try to show them they won't listen to it
[1:44:18] just walk
[1:44:19] away see God don't argue neither as his
[1:44:25] children
[1:44:26] notice
[1:44:28] God's 144,000 elected Jews don't bow to
[1:44:33] the Beast is denominational
[1:44:36] ISM statues or
[1:44:38] anything though their nation is in a
[1:44:41] covenant with it at the
[1:44:42] time Israel is in a covenant but here's
[1:44:46] 144,000 it's not going to do it amen
[1:44:51] that's the elected same thing is right
[1:44:53] you're in the Gentile church now he an
[1:44:55] elected group you can't pull him in that
[1:44:56] kind of stuff won't believe it amen
[1:44:59] awesome light one struck and that
[1:45:01] settles it right then they see the sit
[1:45:04] happen then sit Vindicated and proved
[1:45:06] and like that and they look down here
[1:45:07] the Bible see that word just going you
[1:45:09] do might as well just quit fooling with
[1:45:11] them because they believe it that's all
[1:45:14] all though they can't explain it but
[1:45:18] they know they got
[1:45:20] it God says a lot of things I can't
[1:45:22] explain I know it's real
[1:45:24] anyhow all right this time was between
[1:45:28] the sixth and seventh seal that he calls
[1:45:30] these people spoken of by Jesus in
[1:45:33] Matthew the 24th chapter and the 31st
[1:45:35] verse that we've just read see trumpet
[1:45:38] sh
[1:45:40] um are the two
[1:45:42] witnesses of the on the trumpet sounds
[1:45:45] is a trumpet of the two witnesses of the
[1:45:48] age of Grace for the
[1:45:51] Jews one trumpet sound you notice one
[1:45:55] trumpet sound he said it sound the
[1:45:58] trumpet I notice over
[1:46:01] here 31st and he shall send forth his
[1:46:07] angels not
[1:46:09] one see it's two of them with a great
[1:46:13] sound of a trumpet what is it when God
[1:46:18] gets ready to speak there's a sound of a
[1:46:20] trumpet that's always his voice it's
[1:46:22] calling to B thing God speaks these
[1:46:25] angels will come forth with the sounding
[1:46:27] of the
[1:46:29] trumpet and you notice at the last
[1:46:33] Angel's message the trumpet sounds the
[1:46:36] first Angel's message a trumpet sound
[1:46:39] second Angels a trumpet sounded when he
[1:46:41] sent it out notice but when the seals
[1:46:44] were announced they were all in one
[1:46:46] Great Divine thing to call out a group
[1:46:49] of people there was one trumpet sound
[1:46:51] amen and seven SE seals were broke
[1:46:54] notice gather his elected Jews from the
[1:46:58] four parts of the heavens he U
[1:47:03] mentioned uh six seals as we have seen
[1:47:07] but not the seven seal he's never said
[1:47:10] nothing in here about the seven seal

[1:54:16] God remembers every promise of his word
[1:54:20] amen oh I'd like to
[1:54:23] preach on
[1:54:24] that God don't forget
[1:54:29] nothing though it looks like like he
[1:54:31] told Moses Israel had been down there
[1:54:33] 400 years but had to go up that time he
[1:54:36] told Abraham that his seed would be a
[1:54:39] sojourning in a Strange Land for 400
[1:54:41] years then he bring him out the mighty
[1:54:42] hand but then he said to Moses I have
[1:54:46] remembered my promise amen and I've come
[1:54:49] down to make good what I've said God
[1:54:53] doesn't forget he doesn't forget his
[1:54:55] curses neither does he forget his
[1:54:57] blessings but every promise that he made
[1:55:00] he stays with it amen here's why they
[1:55:03] were missing now if you watch now read I
[1:55:06] want you to read with me now go over to
[1:55:08] Deuteronomy the 20 uh 29th verse there
[1:55:14] 29th chapter there is a reason for these
[1:55:17] tribes not being there everything has
[1:55:20] got a reason for it
[1:55:23] Deuter we want to take the the U 29th
[1:55:27] chapter of of
[1:55:29] deuteron
[1:55:31] now the Lord so help us that we can
[1:55:35] understand now now we want to start in
[1:55:37] Deuteronomy the 29th chapter at the 16th
[1:55:41] verse now listen Moses speaking for you
[1:55:45] know
[1:55:46] how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt
[1:55:51] and how we came
[1:55:53] through the Nations which we passed
[1:55:56] by and ye have seen the Abominations and
[1:56:00] their Idols wood stone silver gold which
[1:56:06] were among them every want to carry a
[1:56:08] little some other little statue of
[1:56:10] saints of C you know something like
[1:56:13] that L therefore listen lest there
[1:56:17] should be among you a man woman or or a
[1:56:22] family or a tribe
[1:56:26] amen whose heart turneth away this day
[1:56:29] from the Lord Our God to go and serve
[1:56:33] the gods of these nations lest there
[1:56:37] should be among you a
[1:56:41] root that beareth Gall and
[1:56:45] wormwood and it come to pass when he
[1:56:49] heareth the words of this curse
[1:56:53] that
[1:56:55] he that he bless
[1:56:57] himself in his heart and say I have
[1:57:01] peace though I walk in the imagination
[1:57:05] of my own heart see people say What He
[1:57:08] blesses himself you know make a little
[1:57:09] Cross or something like you do now you
[1:57:11] see same thing and you see it's a
[1:57:13] heathen
[1:57:14] trait he He blesses himself in his own
[1:57:18] heart his own imagination in his own
[1:57:20] mind to ask
[1:57:22] drunkenness to thirst just drink that
[1:57:25] don't make any difference as long as you
[1:57:26] go to church all
[1:57:28] right the Lord will not spare
[1:57:32] him but then the anger of the Lord his
[1:57:36] jealousy shall smoke against that man
[1:57:40] and of all the curses that are written
[1:57:43] in this book don't take one word from
[1:57:45] her add one to it see shall lie upon him
[1:57:49] and the Lord shall block his
[1:57:52] blot out his name from under the
[1:57:56] heaven that's what he here on Earth see
[1:57:59] under the Heaven and the Lord shall
[1:58:01] separate unto him evil out of all the
[1:58:05] tribes of Israel according to all the
[1:58:09] curse of the Covenant that's written in
[1:58:12] this book of the law therefore If any
[1:58:17] man will serve an idol or keep an idol
[1:58:21] on him or bless himself in his own
[1:58:24] imagination of his mind and serve Idols
[1:58:27] God said man woman family or tribe his
[1:58:31] name will be completely blotted out from
[1:58:34] amongst the people amen is that right
[1:58:37] amen how true idolatry did the same
[1:58:40] thing in the church years ago and does
[1:58:42] today and how notice watch how the
[1:58:46] Antichrist tried to make an anti move
[1:58:48] how many knows that the devil T types
[1:58:51] and pns after after God SS what is what
[1:58:55] is sin is right thing perverted what is
[1:58:59] a lie is a truth
[1:59:01] misrepresented what is adultery is a
[1:59:04] right act legal act done wrong see now
[1:59:08] and trying to do this blot out of name
[1:59:10] did you notice in the church age the
[1:59:13] same Beast serves the images of dead
[1:59:17] people and so forth tried to blot out
[1:59:20] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:59:23] Christ and give titles as Father Son and
[1:59:25] Holy Ghost
[1:59:27] amen same thing with that curse behind
[1:59:30] it like that Dan and Ephraim did just
[1:59:34] that under a hypocrite of a king in
[1:59:38] Israel amen an impostor
[1:59:42] jobon now notice in First Kings the um
[1:59:47] 12th chapter I know
[1:59:50] we're this to me it it it lays a
[1:59:53] background on what we can depend on what
[1:59:56] we see First
[1:59:57] Kings want to go to the 12th chapter U
[2:00:02] 25th uh to the 30th verse then jerob
[2:00:08] Shing and the Mount of eph dwelt there
[2:00:12] and went out into a built pimple and now
[2:00:16] jeroboam said unto in his heart see the
[2:00:19] imine of his heart now shall the kingdom
[2:00:21] turn to the House of David he was
[2:00:23] getting scared you see because the
[2:00:24] people might go out if this people go up
[2:00:28] to sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
[2:00:31] Jerusalem then shall the heart of this
[2:00:33] people be turned again to the Lord even
[2:00:36] to Riel king of Judah and they shall
[2:00:39] kill me and go unto RI um riom king of
[2:00:44] Judah where upon the king took counsel
[2:00:49] and made two caves of gold and said unto
[2:00:52] to them it is too much for you to go up
[2:00:54] to Jerusalem behold your Gods oh Israel
[2:00:58] which brought thee out of the land of
[2:01:00] Egypt and he set up the one in bethl and
[2:01:04] the other put
[2:01:06] he in D and this thing become a sin for
[2:01:12] the people went to worship before uh the
[2:01:16] one even to Dan see Ephraim and bethl
[2:01:20] and Dan and they set up idols and these
[2:01:24] went out to worship this and here we are
[2:01:28] plumbed down into the Millennium age
[2:01:31] almost and God still remembers that
[2:01:35] sin they're not even counted in
[2:01:38] there
[2:01:41] hey just as sure as he remembers every
[2:01:45] good promise he remembers everyone evil
[2:01:48] too just remember when that's the reason
[2:01:50] I believe friends I've always tried to
[2:01:52] stay with that word no matter how
[2:01:55] strange it
[2:01:56] seems see now they wouldn't think about
[2:01:59] that there then they didn't think about
[2:02:01] it then they thought well they got by
[2:02:03] with it all right but here they are over
[2:02:05] here in this Millennium age setting in
[2:02:08] when their names and tribes is blotted
[2:02:11] out
[2:02:13] from because they serve idolatry that
[2:02:16] God cursed didn't he say he hated the
[2:02:20] nickens and that Jezebel
[2:02:22] [Applause]
[2:02:25] okay away from it didn't he say he'd
[2:02:28] kill Jezebel's daughters with the
[2:02:30] killing of death which is eternal
[2:02:32] separation from his
[2:02:34] presence don't trust in it at all get
[2:02:37] away from it so God remembers notice but
[2:02:42] did you notice there is to be blotted
[2:02:44] out why under Heaven there was no
[2:02:47] immediate sacrifice that could give him
[2:02:50] the Holy Spirit to let him see these
[2:02:52] things but he did it anyhow in his own
[2:02:54] selfish mind but Ezekiel in his vision
[2:02:58] in the Millennium he sees them again in
[2:03:01] perfect order Ezekiel if you want to
[2:03:03] read it just put it down you read it to
[2:03:05] save time Ezekiel 48 1-7 also read 23 to
[2:03:09] 29 Ezekiel seeing every tribe just
[2:03:11] exactly in order all right and also in
[2:03:15] Revelations 14 John seen them again in
[2:03:18] tribal order that's tried every tribe to
[2:03:20] his place what Happ remember he said
[2:03:23] under the heavens that his name would be
[2:03:26] blotted out of the tribal ofar as long
[2:03:29] as he was under the heavens there would
[2:03:30] be no more and this 144,000 is down here
[2:03:34] in the tribal part
[2:03:36] yet right but you see they' been blinded
[2:03:40] they had only the sacrifice of bulls and
[2:03:42] goats see now notice he blotted them out
[2:03:46] under the heaven but the Gentile in the
[2:03:49] days of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:52] against that your name was taken
[2:03:54] completely off The Book of Life and
[2:03:56] could never have forgiveness in this
[2:03:57] world the world to
[2:03:59] come that
[2:04:00] right that's where we stand Israel under
[2:04:04] goats sheep they they did have a place
[2:04:07] as long as his own Earth here the tribes
[2:04:09] is missing they could never be included
[2:04:12] now all when he called over there
[2:04:13] 144,000 they were missing that's right
[2:04:16] they're not even numbered in there and
[2:04:18] Joseph and Levi is putting the place of
[2:04:20] Dan and EPA now you can look at there
[2:04:22] right there it is before you see and
[2:04:24] here's God's promise way back there
[2:04:26] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[2:04:28] that now what
[2:04:31] happened they were purged during the
[2:04:34] time of the awful tribulation
[2:04:37] period now if God's going to purge that
[2:04:41] that virgin that was a good woman but
[2:04:45] she just failed to get o in lamp and
[2:04:47] he's going to purger through persecution
[2:04:49] in there he puts them tribe right in
[2:04:52] there for the same thing and purges them
[2:04:55] during the time of the tribulation
[2:04:56] period because it is a a purging it's
[2:04:58] judgment but you see there a and look
[2:05:02] here here comes up the 144,000 after the
[2:05:06] purging of Israel and here comes up also
[2:05:09] the sleeping virgent comes up Purge and
[2:05:12] has white robes
[2:05:14] on
[2:05:15] see how perfect how beautiful that is
[2:05:20] just like Jacob in the time of trouble
[2:05:24] see they Jacob in the time of trouble he
[2:05:27] had done wrong but he went through the
[2:05:29] purging time because he had wronged his
[2:05:32] brother Esau see he deceived to get his
[2:05:35] Birthright but he went through a purging
[2:05:38] before he could have his name changed
[2:05:39] from Jacob to Israel which is a type of
[2:05:43] the order of God type today
[2:05:49] now we're turn out to the the eth
[2:05:53] verse of the uh of the first verse I
[2:05:56] mean of the eth chapter Revelation uh
[2:06:00] 81 I know you're tired and I just try to
[2:06:05] listen just for a few minutes now the
[2:06:08] god of Heaven helps my
[2:06:12] bre we must remember that this seventh
[2:06:16] seal is the end of time of all things
[2:06:23] right the things written in the seven
[2:06:26] seal book sealed up of the Plan of
[2:06:31] Redemption from before the foundational
[2:06:34] World it every bit
[2:06:36] ends it is the end it is the end of the
[2:06:40] struggling world is end of struggling
[2:06:42] nature it's the end of everything in
[2:06:45] there it's the end of the trumpets it's
[2:06:47] the end of the vials it's the end of the
[2:06:49] Earth it's a it's even the end of
[2:06:52] time time runs
[2:06:55] out the Bible said so Matthew the 7th
[2:06:59] chapter I mean Revelations the 7th chap
[2:07:02] 10th chapter and one the seventh verse
[2:07:05] time Runs Out angel said time will be no
[2:07:08] more that in the days of this great
[2:07:11] thing to happen everything runs out in
[2:07:13] this time the end of the the at the end
[2:07:17] of this seventh seal notice it's the end
[2:07:20] of the church age it's the the end of
[2:07:23] the seven seal it's the end of the
[2:07:25] trumpets it's the end of the vs and even
[2:07:29] in the ushering in of the
[2:07:33] Millennium that's on the seven seal it's
[2:07:36] just like fireing a rocket into the air
[2:07:39] and that rocket explodes here and it
[2:07:41] goes up then it explodes again it puts
[2:07:44] out five stars one of those stars
[2:07:47] explode and blows out five stars in m
[2:07:50] and then one of them Stars explodes gos
[2:07:52] out five stars from it see it fades on
[2:07:55] out that's what the seven seal and this
[2:07:57] ends a time for the world it ends a time
[2:08:00] for this it ends a time for that it ends
[2:08:01] a time for this it ends a time
[2:08:04] everything just ended up on that seven
[2:08:06] seal now how's he going to do it that's
[2:08:09] what we don't know isn't
[2:08:11] it we don't know it's even time for all
[2:08:16] these things and the ushering in of the
[2:08:18] Millennium notice the breaking of this
[2:08:20] seal was so great that heaven was hushed
[2:08:26] by it in silence for the space of a half
[2:08:31] hour now is it
[2:08:34] great what is it it was hushed Heavens
[2:08:39] it wasn't a thing move for a half hour
[2:08:43] now a half hour might not be long if
[2:08:44] you're having a good time but in the
[2:08:48] suspense of between death and life it
[2:08:50] seemed like a
[2:08:52] Millennium it was so great Jesus never
[2:08:56] mentioned it another rest of them John
[2:08:58] couldn't even write of it no he
[2:09:01] forbidden to write here see it's just a
[2:09:03] just he didn't write but this is silence
[2:09:06] and the four and 20 Elders that stood
[2:09:10] before God there harping with their
[2:09:13] Harps they quit playing their
[2:09:15] Harps the Angels har they
[2:09:19] singing in heaven
[2:09:22] think the holy cherubin and sarapin that
[2:09:25] Isaiah saw in the temple with six sets
[2:09:29] or three sets of wings three two over
[2:09:32] his face and two over his feet and
[2:09:33] flying and day and night they're before
[2:09:35] God singing holy holy holy is the Lord
[2:09:38] God Almighty and even when they walked
[2:09:40] in come into the temple the post of the
[2:09:42] temple move with their their
[2:09:45] presence and these holy sarapin hushed
[2:09:49] up
[2:09:52] Angels quit
[2:09:58] singing lying in the presence of God
[2:10:00] saying holy holy holy they shut
[2:10:04] up no angel singing no Praises no no
[2:10:08] altar service no nothing there was
[2:10:11] silence hush deadly silence in heaven
[2:10:14] for a half hour all the host of Heaven
[2:10:17] Was silent for this half hour when this
[2:10:19] seven seal mystery in the book of
[2:10:22] redemption was broke
[2:10:26] open think of it but it's broke
[2:10:30] amen the land breaks
[2:10:33] it you know what they were ODed by it I
[2:10:37] believe they didn't know that it was
[2:10:40] they just stopped why what is
[2:10:44] it
[2:10:46] now none of us
[2:10:49] know but
[2:10:53] I'm I'm going to tell you my my
[2:10:56] revelation
[2:11:00] of and uh I am not prone to be a fanatic
[2:11:04] if I am I'm ignorant of
[2:11:07] it I am I'm not giving away to uh such
[2:11:13] as uh larious uh carry-ons and imaginary
[2:11:19] things I said some things might been
[2:11:21] kind of strange to some people but when
[2:11:24] God comes around behind it and
[2:11:25] vindicates and says it's a truth then
[2:11:27] that's God's word they seems strange
[2:11:29] that
[2:11:32] way and
[2:11:33] now as
[2:11:35] certain as I stand in the
[2:11:39] platform
[2:11:41] tonight uh had the Revelation that
[2:11:45] revealed it's in a three-fold
[2:11:49] manner that I will speak to you by God's
[2:11:52] help of a fold of it and then you let's
[2:11:56] go to that first here's the Revelation
[2:11:59] to begin what I want to tell you what it
[2:12:02] is what happens is the those seven
[2:12:08] Thunders that he heard thunder and was
[2:12:11] forbidden to
[2:12:12] write that's what the mystery is laying
[2:12:15] behind those seven consecutive Thunders
[2:12:18] rolling out
[2:12:21] now why let us prove it why it is the
[2:12:26] secret that no one knows about John was
[2:12:29] forbidding to write about it even even
[2:12:32] not a symbol about it why this is why
[2:12:36] there was no active in he activity in
[2:12:39] heaven it might give away the
[2:12:43] secret do you see it now amen if it's so
[2:12:47] great it must be included because it's
[2:12:50] got to happen
[2:12:51] but when the seven Thunders now notice
[2:12:53] when the seven angels come forth to
[2:12:55] sound their trumpets there was one
[2:12:58] Thunder when Israel was gathered there
[2:13:00] was a
[2:13:01] trumpet when time shall be no more the
[2:13:04] last
[2:13:07] trumpet one
[2:13:09] Thunder but here is seven straight
[2:13:12] Thunders right in a row one two three
[2:13:14] four five six
[2:13:16] seven that perfect number seven Thunders
[2:13:21] in a row uttered not n just just one two
[2:13:25] 3 4 five six seven
[2:13:27] straight
[2:13:29] then Heavens couldn't write that Heavens
[2:13:33] can't know about it nothing else because
[2:13:35] there's nothing to go on is a relaxing
[2:13:38] time it was so great till it's kept
[2:13:40] secret from the
[2:13:43] Angels now why if Satan should get a
[2:13:48] hold of it you might do great damage yes
[2:13:51] there's one thing he don't
[2:13:55] know now he can interpret anything he
[2:13:57] wants to and impersonate any kind of a
[2:14:01] gift amen I hope you're
[2:14:05] learning but he can't know this it's not
[2:14:09] even written in the
[2:14:11] word it's a total secret the Angels
[2:14:14] everything shut
[2:14:16] up if they made one move it might give
[2:14:18] something away so they just shut up quit
[2:14:22] harping everything
[2:14:25] stopped uh seven God's perfect number
[2:14:29] seven just right down the low seven
[2:14:33] Thunders utter straight
[2:14:36] together like you're spelling out
[2:14:39] something notice at that
[2:14:42] time John's started writing he said
[2:14:44] don't write
[2:14:47] it Jesus never spoke of it
[2:14:51] John Couldn't Write it Angels know
[2:14:54] nothing about it amen what is it it's
[2:14:58] the thing that Jesus said even the
[2:15:01] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[2:15:03] about it
[2:15:06] see he didn't know it himself amen said
[2:15:09] only God would know it amen but he told
[2:15:12] us when we begin to see these signs
[2:15:15] coming up now you getting somewhere all
[2:15:18] right notice we can see the signs coming
[2:15:24] up if Satan could get a hold of it if
[2:15:26] you want something to
[2:15:28] happen now you'll have to take my word
[2:15:30] for this if I'm planning on doing
[2:15:32] something I know better than to tell
[2:15:34] anybody about it not that that person to
[2:15:37] tell it but Satan will hear
[2:15:39] it see he can't get in my heart there as
[2:15:42] long as God's got it closed up with the
[2:15:44] holy spirit so that's between me and
[2:15:46] God
[2:15:48] see he don't know nothing about it until
[2:15:51] you speak it then he hears it and I've
[2:15:53] triy I tell people I'll do a certain
[2:15:55] certain thing and watch the devil cut
[2:15:57] off every wheel he can to get there see
[2:15:59] to beat me to it but if I to get the
[2:16:01] Revelation from God this don't say
[2:16:02] nothing about
[2:16:03] it then it's
[2:16:06] different
[2:16:09] remember Satan will try to
[2:16:14] impersonate he'll try to impersonate
[2:16:16] everything that the church will do he's
[2:16:19] tried to do it we no it through the
[2:16:20] Antichrist
[2:16:21] but this is one thing he cannot
[2:16:24] impersonate there'll be no mimics to
[2:16:30] this because he don't know
[2:16:33] it you no way for to know it amen it's a
[2:16:36] third pull he just knows nothing about
[2:16:39] it he doesn't understand
[2:16:42] it but there's a secret LS beneath that
[2:16:46] amen glory to God in the highest amen
[2:16:50] yes
[2:16:52] thank you
[2:16:53] Lord I can never think the same the rest
[2:16:56] of my
[2:16:58] life when I seen now I don't know what I
[2:17:02] know the next step there but I don't
[2:17:04] know what how to interpret
[2:17:06] that it won't be long amen praise the
[2:17:10] Lord I've got roll down here when it
[2:17:12] happened if you can see here
[2:17:16] stop go no
[2:17:18] further than this right here I'm not
[2:17:21] prone to be a fanatic
[2:17:38] just and all God's people say
[2:17:42] amen always difficult to find exactly
[2:17:45] where to stop you said stop there we'll
[2:17:47] stop for the time and then we'll pick it
