the king and that's God and he has one sword that's his word this one here it's the word oh what a day we're living in what a great thing see the mystery and Secret the third said in there when this left me something is com to me and said don't fear not in your old voice like on the inside of me spoke I just tell you the truth this exactly what happened something said Don't Fear this is that third pole third poll you remember he said You' had so many impersonators on this what you tried to explain said don't even try this remember how many remembers that Vision that's all that's been about six years ago seven years ago and seven years ago said don't try to explain that said this is the third po but I'll meet you in there that right he said don't I was standing with a a little baby shoe when he told me say make your first pool and when you do the fish will run after to The Lure so then watch your second pool said because it only be small fish he said then the third po will get it and all that ministers got around and said brother Brown we know you can do it Hallelujah brother Brown that's where always get tied up with a bunch of preachers I love people they want you to explain everything this that and I said well I said I don't know I said I understand fishing I said now first thing you do here's what's done you see all the fish around you got the jerk the Lord that's exactly a fish so I said jerk the Lord I see when I jerk the Lord the first time fish not but the old little ones that's like they were catching so then I I said that you your and I jerked it out on the bank I had a fish but it looked like a skin Over The Lure it just it was so little and then I stand there and something said I told you not to do that I started crying all the line was Tangled around me like this I had I stand there cry with my head down like that I said God forgive me I'm a stupid person Lord forgive me and I had this line and what I had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long I had that string was about as big around as my finger about a half inch L and the eyet in this shoe was just about the size of a little than a 116 probably of an inch of the out and I was trying to lace this little shoe up with this great big inch car and a boy come said you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said now let him alone just say he picked me up he took me up and set me way up high the word meaning was going to look like a tender Cathedral of some sort now look there's a little box like place over the side and I seen that light was talking to somebody above me that like that you see that on the picture it R away from me like that and went over that tent it said I'll meet you there and said this will be the third pool and you won't K to nobody and then Saia can he said this is the third Po and there three great things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the other one unfolded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language that's then right there and look right straight at it and this is the third po coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my that's the reason all CH was now I better stop right here see I just I just feel checked not to say no more about it see so just remember the seventh seal the reason it was not the reason it did not reveal it no one should know about it I want you to know before I even know any word about that that Vision come years ago you remember that and here it is just as this other ass slides right straight into the word exactly where it was and God knows my heart I one time thought of such a thing EXA here it was that's later oh that shows us from God for see it fits exactly in the promises of God from the end of the the message you notice notice now or they in the time message this seal after all he's revealed all the six seals but who say about the seven and the end time seal when it starts with be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that and remember Revelations 1017 1- 7 chapter 10 1 to 7 at the end of the seventh Angel's message oh the mysteries of God will be the whole were at the in time the opening of The Seven seal now how did I know that the day like Sunday a week ago today I preaching on be humble be humble remember God deals little things I didn't really last one it really was talking about and now I see it it is in such a humble way you thinking something like that would be reveal to the Vatican but it comes just like John the bapti it comes like the of here oh my how do you see it the truth of God's Vision the seven Angel bringing me from the West they were coming from the West Coming Back East BR you here for this message tonight oh my Now The Voice of that great Thunder and the mission that was brought here has been revealed that it and proven that it was of God thing H I knew not these seals and they' been revealed this week did anybody think of that those seven angels being this being the message that was 24th and Angels bring me back here for that remember the seventh messenger was the seven Messengers was the norn blond to me the seventh angel it seemed more to me than any I see they were standing like this we just want you know and I was standing here and I was watching those other see one first bunch of little bird feathers all beat down you remember them and they all flew Eastward and the second bu were brighter bigger birds look like doves pointed Wings they FW East first B second P then the next was angels and it's standing right there and this explosion left and I was looking this way towards the west and they come and just pick me up and there went out of my no and the one of them coming was the one that is strange to me was the one on my beat the left where I entered the consolation that but counting from the left to the right it would been the seventh angel coming across now remember the seven Messengers do you remember the Pyramid of White Rock of Junior Jackson's dream that I driv to you noce the night that I left and I there was six dreams came and every one of them directly to the same thing then the vision started in sney West Junior he was watching well notice look how perf I'm Hing and trusting that you people realize that I'm trying to put this grace on Jes Jesus Christ who is the author of all of it and the only reason you never heard me talk about this before in your life but this hour is approaching notice I have to make it sure to you so you can be Damen down I'm fixing the leave you again I don't know where I go I must preach the gospel other places but now that you might say I've heard kind of F I don't know what I can't judge any other man I only have to answer to God for what I for myself but has there ever been one time I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord it wasn't right all these years nobody else can say so because I always told it this the way he told it now let me just show you that this is exactly true and confirm it I remember if there be a spiritual of prophet I Lord will speak to any Nations and know by dreams interpreting dreams is that Joseph you can interpret dreams and speaking and see Visions is that true now notice this that now when this taken place Junior was standing in a field and had a had a big pyramid to it like that and there was something the rocks and I was revealing that to the people is that right Junior about a year before it happened and notice the next thing now I took some kind of a bar and cut it off on the inside was White Rock that had nothing WR on it and at that time I started to the west and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return When West for the blast return back to the east with the Holy Spirit intereted this Unwritten word amen Hall am is you not trying to say this for is to show you where're at the end now if them others is perfectly on the dot with the word so is this perfectly on the dot with the word we are here we're at the end soon it shall be time run out Millions will lose your lives Millions will be if now believe that they are saved will be counted father for the atomic age we are living at the last hour by the grace of almighty God by his help to his people that they might look forward to the soon appearing of Christ how long around maybe in 20 years maybe in 50 years maybe in 100 years I don't know and maybe in the morning maybe at T night I don't know anybody says that you know they're wrong God only know now notice so help me by God I tell the truth that these are spiritually discerned to me discerned by the Holy Spirit and by every one of them has identified its place in the Bible now what this great secret is that lays beneath this seal I do not know I don't know it I couldn't make it out I couldn't tell it this what what it said but I know that it was in seven Thunders other themselves that close together just banging seven different times and it unfolded into something else that I seen then when I seen that I look for the interpretation F Closs there and I couldn't make it out that's exactly right see the hour isn't quite yet far amen but it's moving into that cycle it's coming up close so the thing for you to do is to remember that I speak to you in the name of the Lord amen hallelujah be prepared or you don't know a l time something can happen now when that gets on tape which it is that'll probably send 10,000 of my friends away from me because B say that brother B's trying to put himself and make himself a a servant or a prophet or something before God let me tell you my brethren that is an error I'm only telling you what I seen and what has been told to me and not you you do whatever you want to amen I don't know who's going to what's going to take place I do not know I just know that those seven Thunders holds that mystery of Heavens was quiet everybody understand it may be T it may be the hour now that this great person that we're expecting to rise on the scene may rise on the scene maybe this ministry that I have tried to take people back to the word has laid a foundation and if it has I'll be leaning you for good there won't be two of us here at the same time if it is you'll increase or decrease I don't know but I have been privileged by God to look and see what it was see see unfold to that much now that is the truth and I'm sure that you notice that things has been happening this sweet I'm sure you notice that little Collins boy there dying other night that little leukemia girl the kingdom of God is coming and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been now that choke people from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you're here amen we're just dra closer to God all the time can't you see Methodist ministers how that your message of sanctification was above that which Luther preached you Pentecostal can't you see your message of the baptism is beyond that what Methodist preached you know what I mean oh we've had a lot of things going forth and that's right and if there's anybody that despises uh wrong and people saying something is actually lies and not the truth I hate that but I I do love the solid truth no matter how much it interrupts this word that way if it's truth God will finally show it his truth and if he doesn't do that one of these days soon than my vision must you see where I say myself why it be brother I cannot tell you I do not know but one of these days if we never meet again on this Earth we're going to meet down at the at the Judgment seat of Christ you'll find out that in that room the Revelation coming from God is like all the rest of man and then one of the mystery of that seal the reason it wasn't revealed it was seven Thunders and other than voices and there is perfectly because nothing knows anything about it wasn't even written so we're we are here I thank God for his word I thank him for Jesus Christ for without sing him for the the propitiation of our sins we all be in a big Mark of sin with no hope but by his grace his his blood cleanses all sin it's like the drop of ink and a bucket of Clorox you never find the ink again when our sins are confessed it's but in the blood of Jesus Christ they'll never be known again God forgets them they was they been done as long as that sacrifice is laying there in an atonement for us that's all that's it see we we're not Sinners no more we're Christians by the grace of God remember in our own selves we probably be just as bad as we ever was but see the grace of God has appeared to us and that's what's made us what we are today Christian brothers and sisters this is been a tremendous week for me I'm tired my mind is tired because I I have with the best that I could do and something strange going on every day I would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something is tur me completely around and here I go in there I pick up the notes I pick up books of Dr Smith you're a Smith and all all the writers and read read down their books I say now here's a sick seal here's a four seal now what does this me say you'd say what is this look over here and get another he said was such and such it look like I just it just didn't work right and I what is I

whatever I se doing watch it like that go down then I take the rest of the day go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures then I prove all things I got this

I thought Lord has been a mysterious week the whole thing's been kind of strange how would people come see stand around the outside in the windows in the doors back around the back everywhere listen And as far as the speaker I'm far far from a speaker I I got that much intelligence to know that I'm not but I'm not a speaker but why would people sit and listen like that why would they do it they don't come to hear a person like me but they're coming because there's something in it drawing a p see there something in it that's drawing as my wife stood here at the platform and sing when I started they come from the East and West they come from the land of far to Feast with the King to d as his guest how blessed these PS are beholding his Hall face a glow with light Divine blessed partakers of his grace as gems in his crown to shine may you always bear that in mind to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ Paul said to the church you are you are the jewels the gems of his crown we want to be the gems of the crown of Jesus Christ we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me I I am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth I say that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of God has let my poor Deming eyes look beyond the curtain of time and see those things on I come back I boy I love people I always want somebody to love me and talk to me nobody would do it because of name of the family nobody talked to me but when I made my surrender to God then our people background being Irish I thought maybe there's all Catholic maybe that would be it I went there he some way and I went back the First Baptist Church and he another way I said Lord there's got to be some way it's true and something said it's a word I've help that word look at every Vision every word the day I laid that Cornerstone on that in there wrote on there what he show me that morning in Vision be instant in season out of season longsuffering doctor for the time will come and they not endure sound doct but as their own lust shall heat for themselves together as teachers having kit ear and be turned away from the truth and the fables I've seen those two trees that have stood by do that very same thing right now we are that is true now you won't remember let me exort you again don't say thank you to anybody at all don't say think of some minister or something some Mortal man there's anything good about him go there's not I don't care who he is amen there's nothing good to any man that's right if there's a whole bunch of trumpets l in Europe and one of them had to sound out of certain music it's the man trumpets are perfectly mute it's the fell that can sound the trumpet that knows what he's going to do that picks up the trumpet the trumpet has nothing to do with it the sound cons of intelligence behind it amen that's right so all trumpets are the same all man are the same all Christians are the same there's no great man among us we're not great men not great women we're all brothers and sisters the same way we're no great one W make one greater than the other not a thing at all to do no sir but we're just all human beings don't try to interpret the things don't try to do anything more than just live a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ everybody

[Music] [Music] [Music] you have just finished hearing the original Seven seal as it was preached its entirety on Sunday evening March 24th 1963 at the Brenham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana brother brandom did not want this original recording released the next day Monday March 25th 1963 brother brandham went to the motel room of brother Fred San and brother James Maguire who were at that time in charge of making the tapes brother Bram told these brothers I don't want this message sit out the way it is after listening to the tape himself he instructed the brothers to stop the tape at a certain point and at that point recorded a new portion of approximately 20 minutes in length this new portion was then used in place of the original ending this recording was the only released version of the seventh seal until 1966 after brother Brenham left the scene the board of the William Brenham Evangelistic Association unanimously agreed to release the tape originally recorded at the Tabernacle since that time both versions have been available we have now placed this additional message of brother brandham on one tape with the original 7th seal the next voice you hear will be brother brandham in the motel room on Monday March 25th 1963 be a good thing that he doesn't know anything about because if he did then he would impersonate that that's in his tricks in doing things so therefore God has made it so into to the whole world even the heaven that there is no way of understanding it only as God will reveal it himself now I want you to notice tonight that in the six seal there was a a threefold purpose of the six seal there was a three-fold purpose of the horse riders there been a three-fold purpose and all these things that brings us back to a three and a seven again see Seven Seals seven BS and so forth now in Threes And Sevens is God's number in his mathematics of revealing his word now you notice like in the the riters uh there was uh three horses went out one of them was a white one one was a red one one was a black one and then in the fourth horse what all of is mixed together see a threefold purpose now God did the same thing God did the same when he sent out his line which was his word to combat the Antichrist and we find out that he sent out the ox during the time of the uh the tribulation period the sacrificial animal and in this tribulation period That's all the people could do just work slave and offer themselves for a sacrifice then we find out in the next age which was reformers age God sent out the wisdom of a man a man like head on the Beast which was a power that went forth into reformers now did you notice every no wonder that the people of these days uh still living The Hangover like it was from the reformers age because they just see it in the ecclesiastical way of looking at it they see it in the way that the seminaries just taught it that was God's way at one time but we've lived to past that now we're into the age of the eagle the Revelation to be reveal the whole thing I'll compare this with Revelations the 10th chapter verse 1-7 and we'll see here in this Revelations uh the Revelation here 10 1-7 that in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message was to finish up all the mysteries of God now we find out also in this that the six uh seal now being open it was for a three-fold purpose now here was the purposes the first thing was that the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins of unbelief and rejecting the message this she was done in the tribulation period we see they wind up over here in Revelation 7 between the sixth and seventh uh chapter here that she had been purged and she' been given her robes now she's not the bride but it's a church that pure people that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they reply Ed by these false prophets and they they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and God knows their heart and you're there purged during this time you notice another purging kind that's for Israel when she gathers that's the second po God purges Israel in the tribulation period out of the millions out together there there will be a selected 144,000 and they will be purged also God's purging Israel notice there is a whole earth is to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars all nature will be purged you see what it is the Earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the Millennium the millennium's coming up and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the six seal now how do you notice on the or of this seventh seal it's also in a threefold mystery this one I will speak in have spoke that it is the mystery of the seven Thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this Myster it'll be right at the coming of Christ because Christ said no one knew when he would return did you notice when the Jews asking that no when we compareed the scripture with Matthew 24 with the six seals the seven seal was left out because you see Christ said only God himself know not even the angels no wonder it wasn't even written you see the harsh nothing take place and Angels don't know it nobody knows when he's coming but there'll be a there'll be uh seven voices of these Thunders that will reveal the great Revelation at that time so I believe to us who if we don't know it and we we it will't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in The Hour That is supposed to be revealed in so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before God and serving and do all that we know how to do and live good Christian lives here now we find that the six uh seal has been open to us we see it and we know that this seven seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrives now there was some reason that God let this uh seven voices be thunder because it must come see for the we find that Christ the lamb took the the book in his hand and he opened that seven seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no one knows it but it it right along with what he said no one would know he's coming they also would not know about this seven Thunder mystery so you see it's connected together that much we have an understanding of it today the C the rest of it is all unfolded but this is not unfolded but sitting in my room and I heard this not heard it brother but seen it unfold to this seven Thunders now that's as far as we can go right there and now I trust that each and every one of you will serve God and do that which is right and love him all your life and serve him and God will take care of the rest now we have the completion here now by the grace of God all the mysteries of the six seals that's been sealed up and we understand and know here that the seven seal is not to be known to the public I is coming at the hour of his coming one the destruction of the earth you know he said there what will be the sign of the coming of the end of the world in Matthew 24 there where they asked him that question he went down to that he told about Israel being gathered as a nation in the 31st verse of Matthew 24:31 but then he started off on Parables see and you see the learn a parable of big tree when you see it putting forth its bu that's why you know spring down then when you see this uh coming to pass then though the time is not see Israel gathering in its own Homeland but you notice he omitted the revelation of this seventh seal and here when the seventh seal when he opened it he also omitted it again see so we see that it is a complete mystery therefore the hour is not yet this mystery to be known therefore we're this far and the rest of it will be known right around about the time that Jesus appears on Earth again for his bride or whatever takes place at that time now until that time let's just all pray live good straight Christian lives looking forward for his coming and now this tap would have to fall into the hands of some persons somewhere don't try to uh make any kind of an ism out of it the only thing you do is continue serving God because this great secret is so great that God wouldn't even let John Rite it thundered out but he knowing that promis that it would be open but to this time it isn't open and now we are grateful to God for what he has shed us I've been sitting in the room up there for eight days and the message that I have just got through explaining to you many of you here will understand and I promise that there was something going on spiritual all the time that I sure you were missing it and here's what it is it's the absolute Vindication of this interpretation of the scriptures being s of God because before we even went into it in our left to go west the Lord showed me a vision one day about 10:00 one morning and I come and explain it I here that I'd seen it didn't know what it was it was a constellation of seven angels we remember that you'll get it on the T what time is it sir well now that is exactly what you're seeing now the seven angels I was in the west you remember the little bitt Messengers they went East the second messengers the Dos a little bit larger bird they went East and now I look they was with me all the time that is that first and second pull now the third came from the West sweeping forward with great terrific speed and they picked me up that was coming back East with the mystery of these Seven Seals just like it said and and Junior Jackson's uh dream that the Lord let me interpret for him there on the inside of that FID there was white stone that wasn't written on that's the reason I had to go west to connect with these angels message to come back here to reveal it to the church remember I said the next things that happen to you at the church that's just exactly another thing I want you to notice what taking place even if you're listen to the tape of the what time is it sir you will notice that one Angel was very notable to me the rest of them just seemed ordinary but this Angel was a noted Angel he was to my left in the consolation in the form of a pyramid and remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious White Rock was not written on and the angels took me into that pyramid of themselves the mysteries of God known only to them and now there was The Messengers had come to interpret that pyramid of that message of the secret of these Seven Seals which lays with inside the pyramid now the angel was to my left would really be the last or seventh angel if we would count them from left to right because he is on M left me looking at him towards the West him coming towards the east would be on the left side so that would be the last Angel's message very notable remember how I said he had his got his head back and his great sharp wings and how he flew right to me now that is this seven seal it still is a norble thing and we are we don't know what it is as yet because it's not permitted to be broken but now each one of you in the meeting has noticed that what a meeting it's been everybody just seemed to be right on the end of their seat everybody uh standing around here 1 2 o00 the afternoon waiting for the doors to open get up here in the front standing around the walls cramp Limbs and everything what is it it's been the Holy Spirit sing down these Messengers and they have been revealing it to us and then notice how it's Dove tail with the word exactly and then to let you all know that this is truth he foretold it about him about two months now or more before it ever happened that when I went West not knowing it come back here with the interpretation as he is given I remember in the vision he never told me one thing in the vision when he took up I was scared for has going to die being killed in an explosion you see they could not do it the interpretation Come Just As I had need of it that was in the room and I gave it out just as he give it now you see friends Visions doesn't fail they're always perfect they're just exactly true now the Vision Plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus sayeth the Lord now may the Lord bless you all each one real richly as we stand now and sing uh this good old song of the church God bless you each one amen my [Applause] all God's people say amen it's sure good be in church with each one of you today and seems like there are some things that we know better now and maybe some things that to be revealed and we're just so blessed so much to thank him for appreciated that earlier brother Scott and just love each one maybe we could do a a few just of the chorus so just be faithful believe his words stay with the message that you
