Go ahead and turn and shake the hand of your brother or sister next to you. Don't give them a high five, but welcome them to the house of the [Music] Lord. Let's go with the key of G above all powers, above all kings, above all nature. and all created things above all wisdom and all the ways of [Music] man. You were there before the world began. Above all kingdoms, above all thrones, above all wonderers the world has ever known. Above all wealth and treasures of the earth, there's no way to measure what you're worth. You were crucified, laid behind a stone. You live to die. Rejected and alone like a rose trampled on the ground. You took the fall and thought of me above all. For you were [Music] crucified, laid behind a stone. You live to die, rejected and alone like a rose, trampled on the ground. You took the fall and thought of me above all. Amen. You may be seated. You are not a God created by human hands. You are not a God dependent on any mortal man. You are not a God in need of anything we can give by your plan. That's just the way it is. Let's sing that verse one more time. You are not a God created by human hands. You are not a God depending on any mortal man. You are not a God in need of anything we can give. and by your plan. That's just the way it is. For you are God alone from before time began. You are on your throne and you are God alone. And right now in the good time and bad you are on your throne. And you are God alone. You're the only God whose power none can contend. You're the only God whose name praise will never end. You're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give. You are God and that's just the way it is. For you are God alone from before time began. You were on your throne. And you are God alone. And right now in the good times and bad, you are on your throne. And you are God alone. You're unchangeable. You're unshakeable. You're unstoppable. That's what you [Music] are. You're unchangeable. You're unshakeable. You're unstoppable. That's what you are. For you are God alone from before time began. You are on your throne. And you are God alone. And right now in the good time and bad you are on your throne. You are God alone. And right now in the good time and bad you are on your throne and you are God alone. Amen. It's the only God we can say that about. You are God alone. Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He invites his chosen people. Come and die. Oh, with his man a he of supplies our every need. Oh sweet us up with Jesus all the time. Oh, come and dine, the master calling. Come and dine. Oh, you made feast at Jesus table all the time. Oh, he who fed the multitude, turned the water into wine. to the hungry call it now come and on the disciples came to land thus obeying Christ command for the master called to them come and die oh there they found their heart's desire bread and fish upon the fire thus he satis satisfies the hungry every time.

All the saints in spotless wine and with Jesus they will feast eternally. Oh come and die the master call it come and die. Oh you may feast at Jesus table all the time. He who fed the multitude turned the water into wine. To the hungry call it now come and oh he who fed the multitude, turn the water into wine. To the hungry call it now. Come and dine. Amen. That's what we're here to do is to come and and feast on his table. Let's go to the key of C. I know not why God's wonderful grace to me have made known. For why unworthy Christ in love redeemed before his own. Oh, but I know whom I have believed in and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. And I know not how this saving faith to me did part, nor how believing in his word brought peace within my heart. Let's go to the next verse. Oh, I know not how the spirit moves, convincing men of sin, revealing Jesus through his word, creating faith in him. Oh, but I know who I have believe in and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day. And I know not what of good or ill may be reserved for [Music] me of weary ways or golden days before his face I see. Next verse. And I know not when my Lord may come at night or no day fair. Nor if I'll walk the veil with him or meet him in the air. Oh, but I know whom I have believe in and am persuaded that he is aable to keep that which I've committed unto him against that Hey, amen. Amen. As we move to change the order of the service, let's go to the key of D. Let's all stand. Sing that song. I'm amazed. I'm amazed that you love [Music] me. I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood, I found [Music] pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Oh, no one knew how alone I was feeling. And the emptiness I tried so hard to hide. Though I laughed and said, my life was fine without you. I was covering up the secret tears I cried. And one day someone told me of your [Music] mercy and the love you showed on a hill called Calvary. [Music] You died and purchased my redemption. When you broke sin's power and set my spirit free, I'm amazed that you love me. I'm amazed how you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Let's sing that one more time. Oh, I'm amazed. Brother Jill, so amazed that you care. Through your preious blood, I found pardon. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. And my sins are washed. They're all washed away. All my sins are washed away. Amen. So amazed that he loved even a sinner like me. Saints, so good to be in church with each one of you. I know William James is happy to be here. How did you know that, Brother Joe? Well, he watches me bang a little bit in the back on that tambourine and he smiles. So, we got a few smiles tonight. It's sure good to be with each one. A couple of visitors. Sister um Arvy, we're sure glad to have you here at the new church. And uh the Dubskys here all the way down from Phoenix, a musician, great musician for brother Ron there. And so, we appreciate having them. Good to see uh Josh and Mate and really Rosie, but we're happy to have them too. Um we know you've been doing some traveling. We miss your father-in-law. He'd probably poke you a little bit. So sorry for the jab there, but it's good to have you guys. And we miss them in different ones. So as far the order of a service for our visitors, we'll listen to the best preacher here for about 30 minutes finishing once more. A real good tape we're looking forward to tonight. And then we'll go in pray for pray requests. I'll mention a few of those things if you've got something you'd like to bring to the church. We'll let you do that after the tape and we'll just go in prayer as we miss our pastor tonight over in Liberia and and those things. So, God bless you real real good tonight. It's good to be in house of the Lord. You know, Wednesday we let our hair down a little bit, maybe come a little underdressed or just coming in from work. Um my daughter is always uh coming directly from work and things. So just real good to take time out with the Lord and with you tonight. Amen. Only [Music] believe. Only believe. Only believe that all things are possible. Yes. Only believe. [Music] Only believe, only be all things are possible. Only me. Let's confess together. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Yes, Lord, I [Music] believe. All things are possible. Lord, I I believe. Lord, I [Music] believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. A Lord I Amen. You can be seated. How we ought to let the thoughts go through our mind of the great victories. I don't have time to get it and keep my word to you. And of God that raised him up for this purpose. And there he stands between those two posts, blinded, defeated, humiliated. He was still the same big bulk that he ever was, but his strength was gone. The church is anything. It's stronger in membership than it ever was. But where is the word the strength being manifested? It's been cut off from you by your power shaving organizations. He had failed God. Not only had he failed God, but he failed his own people. He was a total failure. Now he was a prisoner to the very nation that God raised him up to destroy. And here stands the last organization of the church Pentecost this afternoon just as defeated as Samson was. You might not believe that, but if you'll just open your mind to the word, you'll see it's the truth. had him doing tricks for entertainment. How sometime I said not long ago, these full gospel businessmen, as well as I love them, they're in their magazine writing up, "Holy Reverend Father, so and so, you poor, deluded, blind Pentecostals. What's the matter with you? Don't you know our savior said, "Don't call no man on this earth father." Don't you realize the devil's only taking somebody's been kicked out of one of those out here and just making a laughing stock out of you? They're not coming in. Don't you let anybody tell you they are. What's the matter with this deluded church? world has punctured its eyes. Don't you know Jesus said that that would happen? And when the sleeping virgin come in to buy oral, she never got it. There's a sleeping virgin. Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, they're not getting it. They might speak with tongues and jump, but that don't mean anything. I've seen heathens do the same thing. and devil worshippers speak in tongues and jump and sing and shout. Drink blood out of a human skull and call on the devil and speak in tongues. You rely on sensations. It's a word of God that don't pass. There she is, defeated just as much as Samson was defeated. doing tricks now. How Satan stand up and laugh at him and said, "Look, they claim they believe the Bible. Look, telling all the angels of heaven, look, look, they they they're Bible believers. Each one of them look at them all, call it together. I'm going to throw them everyone over just exactly going to lead them right in just exactly what the scripture said." They have to do that. There they are, defeated, Delilah, eyes punctured. So they can't see the truth. Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You got eyes and you can't see." You got ears and you can't hear. Why? I said because Isaiah said so. He referred back to the word, the prophet. The God himself, Jesus Christ, referred back to the word of his prophet. And today, the Holy Spirit's bringing your memory back. Amen. Head highminded. Lovers are pleasure more than lovers of God. women, painted faces, wearing shorts, acting like the world, bobbing their hair and doing so forth, having a form of godliness, but denying the power they're up for. You're on the worst screen [Music] that's the Holy Spirit in the word pointing right back to the word again. Oh, you say, "I got it." When you take medicine for a disease, if it don't show up, you better change your medicine. you're dying your sins. The nation, the very purpose, the very thing that they was raised up to destroy Samson is now a victim. And so is the church. Raised up to put denominationalism and the world in the denomination to shame. And you come right into the denomination. And by doing that, you can't follow the scriptures. Every one of them's got a different idea. So you lost your strength. That blinding devil. Let a lure of a woman take him from the the word of God. Now you say, "Brother B, was it was the word of God. Delila took Samson from the word of promise." Yeah. And so has the Jezebel of this day taken the church, lured it from the word of the promised God, holy bible. Oh, same thing. Same exactly thing. What did they do? Let Jezebel spoke of in Revelations the 17th, Revelation 17th chapter. The Catholic Church is represented there and they tell you Sam too. They don't their own book says so. They make no bones of it. How many ever read their own writing and know that that's true? They say the Catholic church is represented. That's right. And you remember she was the mother of harlots. She was a and a mother of harlots. See, it had to be churches, not boys. It was girls, Protestant churches. a mother of harlots. As soon as they organized, they done the same thing they did there. They stripped themselves from the word and have to follow the dictations of some organization. I know this is not popular, but it's the truth. I haven't got no big radio programs and television programs support. God help me to never have. I only want one thing, and that's the support of Jesus Christ by his word. Let him vindicate that I'm telling him the truth by his word. Not some bogus makebelie un scruple thing, but the genuine Holy Spirit himself who takes the promise of this day and shows it as the truth. That's all I long to see. Like Jesus said, if I don't do the works of my father, then don't believe me. Now blind or you say we're not blind. You are blind. The Bible said he was. Every scripture reader knows that this is the Lady Osia church age. How many believe that? Then the Bible said that the Lady of Church was blind, naked, and didn't not There's the bad part. She don't even know it. She's worse than all the other church agents put together. The ox knows his master's crib or stall and the mule knows his crib. He said, "My people don't [Music] know." Blind. Spiritually blind. Blind to what? God's word. Amen. Just as blind as they can be. And they don't want to see it. And you tell them this. Oh, yes. I'm I'm intended to do that, but none of them does it. They can't do it and maintain their fellowship in an organization. They'll kick him right out of it. There she stands. Delilah shaved off his locks. Now he's he's bobbaired like the women in it. Same thing. Now look at them defeated just like they was ministers, the Pentecostal messengers of the early days. You would have never made them man believe that their own children would organize seminaries that they criticize by the word of God and come out of right. What by these seminaries have we got? We brought world into the church. An old ministry used to sing we let down the bars, we compromise, we sin. We let down the bars. The sheep got out. But how did the goats get in? You let down the bars. Got away from the word. When Eve let down the bars to intellectual reasonings of Satan, death come in. And the bars that God had her barred in with was his word of promise. And we substituted something else, a creed instead of the word. Amen. You know that's the truth. What have we got the Pentecostal people today? Too many Ricky's that word Elvis and Ricky. You never heard of that in other days. It's a word. It's a name for this day. It goes with this. It means something. You say a name means nothing. Then why didn't he change Abraham's name to Abraham? Yes. Why did he change uh uh Saul's name to Paul, Simon's name to Peter? Why did he change his own name? Why did he change Jacob to Israel? Not until he wrestled with the Lord. Not until he overcome. And when Jesus overcome death, hell, and the grave, the Bible said he had a new name. Amen. And when Jacob overcome, and if the church can overcome, she'll stop saying, "I'm Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian." When she can overcome her creeds and the world that's draw her in there, she'll come back to the bride of Jesus Christ, Miss Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. What a sad sight as we see Samson standing there. women with short hair, wearing shorts, painted faces and Pentecostals calling themselves Christians, singing in the choir. I was in a Pentecostal assembly not long ago, a great city where a famous great man lives and the meetings got so big I had to take it over to a big place and they had a selected Pentecostal choir. And little did they know I was sitting right down behind the curtains praying. And there every girl in that robe about 35 girls and 35 boys to sing the Messiah was wearing makeup and bob hair. And when David Duplicus was taking up a missionary offering they were acting like they were blonde Barnameus running along passing the cup. That's Pentecostal grandchildren. That ain't a Pentecostal servant of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost won't make fun of his own word. He came and remained the Holy Ghost. But that's where you've got to. Amen. Oh, Samson, get to thinking a little bit. Hallelujah. Remember, these tapes are recorded and sent around the world. I'm not only speaking to this group here. Samson begin to think of his eras. Oh, he begin to think of what he was one time. Pentecost, think what you was 1900 years ago. Church, Catholic, Protestant, think what you were 1900 years ago and look what you are today. Study a little while. Just got about eight more minutes. to keep a word. Notice, but while he was standing there, he cried. He began to think of his errors. And when he begin to think of what had happened to him, he was blind. Therefore, he couldn't see no more. He He's accepted something else. For the love of this woman, that's what got him. And she turned him down. Oh, what a trap. I can speak on here that Satan's set for the church. Just get your eyes blinded from the truth and that's what they got you then. And if you only knew it one of these days, God's going to prove it to you what the mark of the beast is. Notice, but when once blinded, there she stands. And there he stood. And he began to remember the things of his eras where he had left the straight and narrow road. Where he'd got away from God's promise and he cried out, "Lord, revenge my eyes." Why do you do this? He knew there was a possibility. Now is where I want you to listen. Samson must have thought of all where he had left the path. He saw it then. It's too late now. He saw it where he'd left the pad. And he thought there must be a possibility that God would answer. He knew if he could repent and get God to see that he was sorry for his error, there was a possibility that God would still achieve his promise. God will do it. He's going to do it. Say now God's going to have that church. Don't you worry. She's going to be to have the Holy Spirit will be moving so in the church and the church in Christ will be the same spirit. Luther stood down on the feet in justification. Wesley stood in the heartbeat of love of sanctification. But this is raised up to the head now. More than that she denominated and the husbandman come along and prune the vine. that died. They never did come back no more. They never will come back no more. But still, there's a seed of life there that's coming on. But notice Samson thought there must be a a possibility. He caught the idea. But the sad part is today the church don't catch that. They don't realize that there is a possibility of a revival. They don't realize the possibility. They haven't caught the vision yet. They just set. Oh, they say, "Now, Brother Brandon, what are you doing?" Oh, I know. You clap your hands and have great big gatherings and glittering with whirly tinsel. You have to go to the biggest places. You have to have the most best entertaining. You have to do this, that, and the other. Your pastor must be a seminary scholar with a doctor's degree. are. You can't tell your neighbors down there that your pastor's some little guy out of the cornfield peel out there that got saved. Amen. He's our pastor is Dr. LLD so and so to me that means he's just that far away from God. That's all. Just that far away intellect always takes him away. Oh, you're shining with scholarship. And another thing about a lot of this modern evangelism today, all the way from Pentecost all the way back is a bunch of Hollywood showmanship. You certainly are glittering with that as the tinsils in the hall of the fish god dagen. But that title and scholarship and intellectual showmanship with a great bride, let none of the public see any defeat and so forth. All that stuff like that, intellectual conceptions of the gospel and so forth that don't bring the power of God to make women quit wearing bobbed hair and man to act like Christians to take their place in a house and raise your children like they ought to. It don't bring the spirit of God. Samson stood there just as big a bulk as he ever was. And the church stands stronger in members than it did 40 years ago. But where is the spirit of God? Oh God, where is the spirit of God in it? I see the spirit of Hollywood. I see the spirit of the world. I see the spirit of glamour go right to you. I've been 15 years preaching against it and it's it worsen all around. I can see it and I can see the spirit there. But where is the spirit of God that can grasp God that can recognize the word itself when it's made manifest? Can recognize truth. Only the spirit of God can do that. That's right. You can take glitter, polish, showmanship. Samson had just as big a body as he ever had, but his strength was taken from him. The church, Pentecost today stands, I believe three years ago, the Sunday visitor of the Catholic Church said that the they had a million conversions to Catholicism in one year, but the Pentecostal church had 1,500,000. Amen. more there. Well, what have you got when you got it, child? I'd rather have five that can surrender their life to Christ. He can do more with five men or one man surrendered than he could with 40 million outside. What does members need? just means another thing that you're blinded and adding more strength to the harlot. Right? Notice the church today is not willing to pay the price. Samson prayed the right kind of a prayer. Lord, let me die with this enemy. Oh my. There you are. You don't want to die to your proud. You don't want to die through the things of the world. I remember I'm talking to literally thousands around the world when I'm saying this. And it's not speaking here in Chicago. I'm speaking at the world. You don't want to die. But the only way that there's a possibility of a revival, you blinded Samson. Can't you see that the Delilah has blinded your eyes? And the only way that you'll ever be able to bring back the strength to the church is to die to the enemy that's got you in this worldly. Samson said, "Let me die with the enemy." There's a great price to pay. You must die to the thing that's brought you in this thing. You must die to the thing that's brought you, you Pentecostal people, to where you are this afternoon. You've got to die to it. Amen. Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God back in his life again. I wonder if the church is this afternoon willing to pay the price and die with the enemy to think all your popularity and all your this that just to see the power of God back on you again and become a prisoner of Jesus Christ. Oh, I hear somebody say, "Oh, yes, we we're having revival, but it's denomination revival." The oneness wants to take all the threeness and make them all oneness. The threeness wants to take all the oneness and make them threeness. The church of God wants to take the church of God of prophecy. One wants to take the other making big. Don't you realize you're only catering to man. We are brethren. There's no denomination can separate the love of God. Amen. We are brethren. This will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other. Say, why are you hollering about a man? Love is corrective. If love doesn't correct, then it's not love. You see your child out on the street and don't give him a little bit of posterior polarplasm stimulation. You're not a good dad. But a real mother or dad will turn him up and spank him. Let him know he's got to get out of that street or perish. Amen. That's genuine love. But you say, "Junior, dear, I don't know you. Maybe you shouldn't be out there at this time of day, the end time, when the cars are going pretty fast, all nonsense. You sissified preacher." Not the audacity to take God's word and call white, white, and black, black. Right, right, and wrong. That's right. But they do it. Yeah, we have revivals. All right. But look at your morals behind these revivals. Don't change them a bit. Getting farther from God into the world all the time. Notice Samson knew what was going to happen if his prayer was answered. But we haven't counted the cost yet. What's going to happen if God answers your prayer to become a real genuine child of God? You know you're gone from your denomination right then and them women that you play bridge with and everything. Oh no, you're gone. That's all. Better count it up first. But Samson said, "Let me die." He was willing to pay the price. And he knew, listen close now to this remark. He knew that his present backslid condition could never meet the challenge of that hour. Yet he was just as much man as he ever was in his muscles. His frame was as big as it ever was. He was just as big a muscle that ever could raise up on his arm at any time. Is probably larger because they've been grinding down in the doing heavier work. We got better churches, better buildings, and everything. But where is our strength spiritually speaking? Oh, we could take a boat in a nation. Sure, we could do these things, but that that ain't what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the presence of God being recognized among us. That's what we are to live for. He knew that his backsliden condition could not meet the challenge of that hour. And so does a church know it now. We can't do it under this condition. You can't do [Music] it. Denominations does not vindicate the word. It denies the word. The very denomination itself denies the word as soon as it's denominated. Just the thing itself, you just get on the other side to begin with. It denies a word. All the time I've just a little minute or two longer, but notice as I hurry now to keep my word. All the times while they were all standing there and these thoughts was going through their mind, I hope it sends some to yours. They never noticed while Samson his thoughts went through his mind. Maybe they passed the bottle and took a drink again. They're fine. Hollywood women stood there with their cigarette in their mouth or if it was such a thing in that day. I don't think they got quite that low in that day, but pushed up their hair, took another drink, hollered, "Hello, Joseph or John, are you up there somewhere? We played cards together last night." Was at a big party. There's a possibility that God will hear me. There's a possibility. And while he thought the Philistines had not noticed him, while this little boy had untied his hands, walked back, he said, "Lay my hands up on the post. There's a possibility." Oh my, I wish the church could see that there is a possibility of a real revival. What did he do? He raised up his sockets. He had no arms towards God. They never noticed the moving of his lips as he was sincerely confessing. We don't need just a little Lord forgive me and Jim, Joe, and all of us. Amen. We need a sincere cleaning up from the pull pit to the janitor. They never noticed the tears running down from them sockets where he once had eyes. They never noticed the moving of his lips. His eyes briny tears streaming down from the sockets. He wanted God to make his word once more vindicated to prove as I'd say to this Delilah today or this Samson rather, Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. Once more he thought it would happen. Not a new denomination, not a new sectarian, but a vindicated word from you, God. I know you're still God. I'm blind. I've got off the track. I'm not worthy to live. Let me die with this enemy. You raised me up to destroy it. And I failed you, Lord. But there's a possibility. You hear me? Once more, Lord. Once [Music] more. Dead earnest. He prayed. He knew what was coming. Lord, just this once more. Once more, let me see Jesus Christ as he was yesterday. When he prayed that prayer, the tears rolling from his cheeks with deep sincerity of confession. That's what the church needs. Confess your wrongs. Don't care what Dr. Jones says or what anybody else says. You're out of the word of God. Confess it that you're wrong. Cry out once more, Lord. Once more. Once more, Lord. once more. Hallelujah. Avenge my blindness upon these denominations of give me strength Lord to shake this denominational world. Hallelujah. With your vindication. Amen. Give me strength, Lord. Once more proven. He knew what was going to happen if his prayer was answered. He knew. Dead earnest crying once more, Lord. And while he was praying and making his honest confession, every fiber in his body begin to vibrate. Oh God, if the body of Jesus Christ could stand as one and every fiber and every member begin to vibrate with the literal baptism of the Holy Ghost together. Hallelujah. Not with new members and shaking hands and some creed. As the strength began to move into those big muscles, every fiber be to twist. He be to feel himself again. And he twisted out. When he did, the big wall fell. All we knew to do today is to see these denominational walls fall is get deeply sincere before God to heal these blinded eyes that's been blinded from the word of God. That was Samson's greatest victory he ever had. because he was willing to confess over every enemy first that he was brought up to destroy. Oh Pentecost, stand at your post this afternoon. Your post of the duty of God's word. Repent and cry out, Lord God. Once more, let me tell you something. You better destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you. Right. Bring back the oldfashioned prayer meetings, the real godly repentance, the allnight altar service. Oh, Pentecost. Hear me. Leave. Oh, leave this corruption that Jezebel has worked among you. Leave it. Leave it quickly and return back to the word of the Lord. Away from this Hollywood showmanship. Turn with your whole heart back to the word of God. Turn back to the power of the Holy Ghost. You women dress like women. You men act like man, like sons and daughters of God. Turn, old, turn from this Jezebel system that's choking you and blind in you. God, help us to have a true repentance. Not halfheartedly. You can't do it. I think today at this very moment when my time is up, we should stand to our feet and cry with our hands in the air, "Lord, once more. Once more. Oh, Lord, once more." Let's stand. Everybody that's willing to do it to see a revival that's ready to die to this Hollywood showmanship. Everybody that's ready to die to see the power of God come design with joy. All these holy mountains never heard shall destroy. Let's raise our hands and cry once more Lord. Once more Lord once more Lord. Once more, Lord, send the Holy Ghost with Russian. Amen. Once more, Lord. Once more. If your children humble themselves and repent, you just want to do everything for them. So tonight, I just ask him once more, Lord. We'll bring our requests to them. And we sang only believe. We sang I believe. Let's sing Jesus is here. Now before we take their requests, Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Here all things are possible. Jesus is here. Jesus is here. Jesus is here and all things are possible. Jesus is here. Yes. Once more. Lord, we believe I made a mistake today. Lord, forgive me. We're not looking at ourselves. How we've performed today or what we've done or didn't do. But when that person brought that lamb up to the priest, the priest didn't look at the person. He looked at the lamb. And was it without blemish? Do we have a perfect lamb tonight? Saint slain from the foundation of the world. And just put all our hope and trust in him tonight. Looking forward to him moving in our lives in each heart. We'll mention these that we know of and give you a chance to mention those needs that you might have. So thankful for a perfect word tonight and for the precision of the word. You know, in Revelations 10:7, it doesn't say in the days of the seventh angel. It says in the days of the what is it? The voice. And so we've heard that voice. We recognize it. We're thankful for it tonight. There's been a couple of people mention request prayer, urgent prayer to please pray for brother Jim Alexander. He had a brain surgery for a blood clot. Gave him a stroke. He's in the hospital. He's a deacon at Landmark Church in Mesa. So we certainly want to uphold this believer, this friend of the Galantes and different ones. Continue to hold hold up our precious sister Lori. She's come a mighty long way here in the last week or 10 days, but her legs are bothering her. They're she's only able to move her toes a little bit at the moment. We just don't accept that that tonight. That devil trying to hinder her recovery. I mean, we just believe for a complete recovery for our precious sister there in Seattle and going through this battle and for our precious brother Randy here and he's had a a nice surgery and has some things to go through and all the decisions the family. So, we sure hold up our precious sister Lorie Snow and the family. I know there's a number missing tonight. We missed the I won't don't want to mention too many names. we'll miss some, but our precious sister Ellie, we've been praying for her. Our elder in the faith should love to be here. Also struggling with health issues, so remember her. Uh, brother Chuck, Sister Barb, um, of course, the Moors as they make preparations. We miss them. And it's going to take a few of us to make up that amen corner, Brother John. So remember, Brother George, Sister Brandy, Eden, and the family. Of course, we want to remember brother Israel and his journey there. Quite a bit of preaching to do yet and journeys and travels and coming back next week. So, I want to uphold him in prayer. I think he posted some pictures and testimonies and things to the WhatsApp. If you're not part of that, we we can get you part of that. So, just be in prayer for brother Israel. What have we missed or what would you like to to bring to the saints out loud? Is there something that should be mentioned? M brother Vic, were you going to say something there? No. Is there something else? Yes, brother. Will. Yes. We'll remember Aunt Wanda Scales. We've been praying for her. Yes. Angel. Okay. So, has Josephina Valdez, we remember other Angel's mom tonight. Is there something else that you'd like to bring before the church? [Music] How about something on your heart? Maybe a family member, a a work situation, a physical, a healing. Let's bring that to the Lord in faith. Believing tonight, all things are possible because we believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. All things are possible. Lord, I believe. Amen. Let's be reverent. Be in prayer for the next 20 or so minutes as we remember these needs. Make yourself comfortable. The altar is open and we'll pray and then we'll sing before we dismiss. God bless you.
