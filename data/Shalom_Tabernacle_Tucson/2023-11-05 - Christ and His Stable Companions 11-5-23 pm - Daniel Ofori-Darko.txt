that you have laid upon my heart Let It Be meaningful to your children father let it enter and go and accomplish what you have sent it for and that Lord Jesus we all with one Accord will lift our hands and our voices and glorify your mighty name thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen we are reading Matthew chapter 26 Matthew chapter 26 we are reading verse 17 to U 29 Matthew chapter 26 verse 17 now the first day of the Feast of UNL bread the disciples came to Jesus saying unto him where will thou th we prepare for thee to eat the Passover and he said go into the city to search a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand I will keep the Passover at thy house with my disciples and the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them and they made ready the pass now when the evening was come he sat down with the 12 and as they did eat he said verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me I hope it's not you tonight and they were exceedingly sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him Lord is it I and he answered and said he that deeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if had not been born then Judas which betrayed him answered and said Master is that is it I he said unto him thou Hast said and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and bless it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take itat this is my body and he took the cup and gave the thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my body for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i s but I say unto you I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom the Lord had is blessing to the reading of his word amen amen let us take our seat well with this uh scriptures brothers and sisters we want to speak on a short topic tonight Christ and his table companions well this inspiration came when uh I heard that there is going to be a communion service and I said oh if that Lord then what will will you help me present to your people something to encourage them something to make them know that Christianity is real Christianity is not a camouflage but it's something real yes that whether the world believe it or not that's right is going on Amen Hallelujah so the Lord laid upon my heart to for us to discuss this Jesus Christ with his stable companions now we know on that day he knew exactly what was going to happen and as it is the Bible says that he told his disciples to go and prepare a place where he was going to D for the last time in this flesh with his people and and they sat around the table amen they sat around the table and Jesus Christ begin to tell them things and the Bible said that they became so sorrowful oh Hallelujah why did they become so sorrowful because he said one of you will betray me and the disciples started asking Jesus question Lord is it I Peter asked Lord is it I Matthew asked Lord is it I but ask Lord is it I all of them asked Lord is it I until he came to Judas is scariot he said Lord is it I he said yeah thou H has said it so definitely there was somebody among them to betray Jesus Christ Hallelujah and Jesus is it what I love with this is the verse 28 he said he said for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I say unto you verse 29 I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom so it means there was going to be another step of this table that Christ was having with his people at the outper room right amen he said from now I'm not going to D with you again but till the kingdom Hallelujah so it means the disciples have to overcome the situation and the condition of their time to make sure that they register their position at the table of Jesus Christ rise in his kingdom so you see we can say definitely that this experience or this ordinance that we are going to take tonight it is for Overcomers amen hallelujah is it for Overcomers in fact if you overcome this world then you are able to die with the Lord Jesus Christ that's right until you deny the world yes until you condemn sin and you defeat The Temptations and trials Amen Hallelujah Jesus Christ knew exactly that what was going to happen but he just asked now to overcome is to means to conquer amen and like the prophet asked how can you conquer or how can you choke a victory when you have not fought that's true there must be a battle yes amen there must be a war that you will fight amen and conquer the enemy Hallelujah now one time I remember when uh Abraham on that day when there was strive between Abraham's servants and that of uh lot and Abraham said that oh my brother you are my nephew but I call you my brother it's not good for our servant to quarrel among themselves look at the land V very big Arizona is very big so just look around take a place and go and dwell there so that there will not be RI between me and you right and the Bible says that his nephew lot lift up his eyes and he looked towards Sodom he looked towards Sodom can because the place was green and he thought that it will benefit his cattle we know that usually when when things are going to be divided between uh the younger one and the elderly one the younger one supposed to tell the Elder take first but lot didn't do that that's right lot didn't say oh Uncle you are my father so why don't you make your choice first before I do but Abraham said you take it and you chose towards Sodom Abraham said no my son that place is dangerous the people over there are sin sinful they don't believe in the Lord right a whole lot of Dy character lord said that is where I want and Abraham said okay that is up to you you can go and possess the land and he went and possessed the land and that place was near Sodom and what happened it was not quiet long that's right when five nations gathered themselves together and attack Sodom they destroy Sodom they conquered Sodom and Lord and his family were taken captive Hallelujah and the Bible says that one of the people escaped and ran to Abraham and told him what has happened oh brother if perhaps it were to be me and you we will say oh don't mind that young boy that's good don't mind the young man I told him I warn him that that place is not good and he didn't respect me as his father and he went so let me leave him and do whatever ever whatever happened to him that's up to him if it were to be you and I perhaps that is what we have said but Abraham didn't do that that's right amen hallelujah because he had the spirit of God in him and the spirit of God is in you to fight the world yes the spirit of God is in you to fight unbelief amen the spirit of God is in you to project love towards one another Hallelujah and like the prophet said he said the only thing that is going to make us make this rupture is love and genuine love love for the word of God love for Jesus Christ and love for one another Abraham said well what will I do let me pursue and fight and rescue my my nephew yes and the Bible says that Abraham had only 318 men in his house they were not trained soldiers that's right right they have never fought any battle before but Abraham said we are going to war we are going to fight and bring my nephew Lord back amen and when they set off oh my god brother sister whenever you are taking a step take it in faith and God will be with you like the sisters were singing about the Lord Jesus Christ if you want Jesus to be around you wherever you are just mention the name of Jesus Christ and Christ will be with you amen hallelujah forget about talking about what is happening and and the politics and and you know talk about Jesus Christ when you talk about Jesus Christ Christ will appear around you so Abraham and his servants went and chased this five nations can you imagine 318 soldiers going to fight five nations H God is amazing God and he always fight our battles for us hallelujah what happened in the short is that Abraham was able to conquer the five nations with the 318 men and he rescu lot Hallelujah and that was the time when he was coming back home he met a man on the way Hallelujah the man's name was madc the Bible says that he has no father he has known mother today theologians even don't know who that mcedc was that's right Seminary don't know what that mchis was but thank God for your life Hallelujah because you are living in the time of Jesus Christ you know who madc is madc is no less a being but the Lord God himself and the bible say that he came down and met Abraham on the way and gave Abraham communion he said Abraham yes what you have done you have shown a great love therefore you deserve to take communion from my hands that's good he said you an overcomer you have overcome your enemies you have overcome Temptation and you are portraying love towards your son therefore you are a winner take the communion and mad gave Abraham the communion my brother my sister in the life of Jesus Christ that question that he asked them it was a time of trial yes he said I know one of you is going to betray me and when he said that they themselves were so much troubled and they begin to find out Lord is it me is it me Peter that is going to betray You Phillip said Lord is it me Phillip that is going to betray you Thomas said the same thing almost all the disciples Jesus didn't say anything but when it came to the man called Judas is kariot Lord is it me Jesus said thou have said it Hallelujah he sat with Jesus Christ he was a companion he at with Jesus Christ he preached with Jesus Christ he commit he he performed Miracle with Jesus Christ but he betrayed Jesus Christ brother sister tonight we can ask the same question yes Lord who is going to betray you is it I Daniel is it I Israel is it I Nathaniel is it I is it I is it I we can all add the same question but thank God Amen that you and I we cannot betray Jesus Christ can you say Amen here we can never betray Jesus Christ because we are part of Jesus Christ and Christ is part of us in fact without us Christ cannot be complete that's right hallelujah oh one time we went to church and uh there was one sister who didn't come to church that day so we made an announcement that the following day we were going to have not the following service day we were going to have Service uh with another church and she was not around so she didn't hear this announcement so the Sunday she went to church and nobody was there H so the following Wednesday which was a evening service we went to church and lo and behold she came around and said pastor I came here and uh there was nobody there I said yes because you didn't come to service the other time we made an announcement that we're going to have Fellowship somewhere so I asked her were you afraid that the Rapture have taken place to my un surprise the sister said pastor I am not afraid because I know the Rapture cannot go without me I say sister God bless your heart she knew that she has overcome the world she knew that he have overcome sin she knew that he has a part in the Lord Jesus Christ Christ so the rupture can never go without she being a Rapture and tonight brother sister I assure you that the rupture cannot take place without you you have also booked your position in the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that is why if you are Jesus Christ tonight Lord is it I who is going to betray you the Lord will say no you cannot betray me if you are Jesus Christ Lord am I going to betray you the Lord will tell you no you can't betray me because he know that where we have reached there is one Accord between us and Jesus Christ Glory Hallelujah he said that day you know that I am in the father and you in me and I in you we are one with the Lord Jesus Christ and this experience that we are going to have tonight is signify the prophet said that it's an open communion and it is Overcomers that take it we have overcome this world we have fought a battle and we have won that is why we have the right to take the Lord supper oh praise be the name of our God Gideon fought and he overcame the enemy David fought and he overcame the enemy Daniel fought and he overcame the enemy Shadrach mesach and Abednego they fought and they overcame the enemy and tonight you and I we have fought the world and you have overcome this world oh brother sister amen and amen let me read something quickly okay I am quoting from Victory Day He said but you know all along where there has been that kind of a battle fought there has also been God's believing people who have had many great Victory days too oh yes there's been there has been there has been on both sides where the glass has focused and went to the Natural side with the victory days also where it Focus onto the word in the Scripture it brings another Victory Day sometimes we've had many of them great battles against our enemy that's right and God had great men out here standing at the front who has been able to capture by the spirit of God the thoughts of the people and throw it into the kingdom of God down there and come out Victorious we fight it every day amen we fight it every day the prophet said that the greatest B ble ever fought was fought in heaven and was thrown on this Earth between God and Satan and now it's raging in our head our minds that is where Satan come and fight us how many times don't we you know rebuke the devil how many times that we don't fight the devil in our minds that's right brother and sister really we fight the devil any time but I assure you that so long as we have the Lord Jesus on our side we are more than conquerors hallelujah oh brother sister I feel good this evening that I'm an overcomer amen I want you to feel good that you are an overcomer amen amen hallelujah the things of this world we count it at dunk and we look forward and we are pressing on like this morning we're saying that we are not looking back that's right okay the things that have gone past we we are not focusing on that but what is ahead of us that is what we are focusing we are looking to the price of the high callings of God amen amen and amen oh my I feel good this morning brother this evening whatever you can call it whether day or night Hallelujah he said we fight it every day every Christian fight a battle every day we are in a Warfare right now going on constantly within us between right and wrong H Hallelujah he say shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world God bless you for saying no brother we will never bow down to the world because we have overcome the world Hallelujah we have overcome the world Amen and amen and amen oh when I think about uh that glorious woman who overcame the World by just ministering to the Servants of the Lord remember when salon and the other man when with the they were sent by General Joshua to go and spy Jericho the chance on a certain woman who was a prostitute yes the Bible call her a harot yes and you know business oh God have mercy I God don't care about your life that's right the only thing God care is your recognition the prophet said that recognizing your day and it message if you can recognize your day and this message all your deadly life will vanish from you Hallelujah because you are going to be refined you are going to be put in the fire you are going to be burned and you are going to be remolded he said when one come to the Lord Jesus Christ behold all things have pass away everything has become new that is why we are new creatures born by the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ oh Hallelujah and so when this Brothers go to this woman the woman said we know that you are the men of God and you are certainly going to take this country yeah because when we heard that you were coming all the men in the cities have turned to be women my who told Rahab this I mean who preached to Rahab it was by Revelation that this woman accepted the messengers of a day amen that's right Hallelujah yes and you know what happened when everything was done and this woman accepted the servant of the Lord there and then something happened to her experience that was her repentance and a woman that some few minutes ago she was called a prostitute straight away request something durable from the men of God she said before you leave me I want you to give me a true token oh Hallelujah not just a token but a true talking not just the word of God but the true word of Goden oh Hallelujah and the brother said woman you have asked and we are giving it to you amen the rope that you have given us to descend by when we go and you see us coming you hear that we are coming tie it on the ls of your window and that will be your token and make sure that you go and tell your fellow you know I mean your colleagues your perhaps your acquaintances your father and your mother your siblings if they want life let them come under the message of this hour oh hallelujah amen and they told her if you don't do that don't blame us that's right and because Rahab believed rightly look the moment the man descended from her house she TI the token on the Lal amen amen because the token you cannot hide it it must be displayed listen any time God give a token to his people he give it in secrecy that's right he give the token to them in a secret but when they want to apply it they apply it openly amen oh Hallelujah so it was flying at the windows of Rahab it was going up and down it was going up and down it was going up and down and Rahab went out to his father's house and told the father daddy you know my profession but from now Hallelujah from now I am a new woman I am a new Rahab yes there is something I want to tell you destruction is coming to this country but there is only one salvation Point whether you believe it or not it's in my house Hallelujah Oh Glory I hear somebody say your house he said yes my house whether you believe it or not my house is no longer a HED house but is a house of the Holy Spirit if you want salvation come there oh brother sister then the father got up pack all his things and follow rhab the mother pack all his and follow rhab the sibl pack all and follow Rahab because they needed salvation then perhaps

going deeper into what our brother the scene that our brother read there the night of the crucifixion they broke bread there's many details that they the Lord never revealed to them but Paul received from the Lord and this is going to pick up what he received but I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy worly eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judge we are chasten of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore Brethren when you come together to eat Terry

Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered answered him if I wash thee not thou H has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head and Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every with and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I've given you an example that you should do as I've done to you verely verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is is he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you
