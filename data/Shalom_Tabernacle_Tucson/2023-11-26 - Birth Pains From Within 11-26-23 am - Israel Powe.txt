[Music] [Music] [Music] am man God bless you this morning like to all stand we're going to our adult Sunday School uh we are in the first seal and brother brandom is just going to be taking just a portion or we're going to be taking a portion of that message this morning paragraph uh was inex at starting at paragraph number 40 ending at paragraph number 80 and there's a scripture reading for this seal in Revelations chapter 6 if you'd like to turn there and as we just before we read the word we will pray Amen Let our heads Heavenly Father we thank you oh God for bringing us together once again Lord as we open the service this morning to hear your word to read your word Lord to be partakers of your word speak to every heart we pray bless those that are gathered here today the other classes that will be gathered and those that are on their way today we pray we ask in Jesus name amen and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer amen thank God for the reading of his word as we go to this first see you let's sing only believe only [Music] believe only believe that all things are possible only believe only be only believe all things are possible oh let's lift our hands and say Lord I believe and Lord I believe Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I God bless you you may be seated brother random now we find the Lamb with the book now and now in the sixth chapter we read and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder and one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse and he is set on him had a bow and a Crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer that's the first seal the one we're going to try by the grace of God to explain it tonight by the very best I realize that a man trying to explain that is walking on Dangerous Grounds if you don't know what you're doing so if it comes to me by Revelation I tell you so if I just have to take it to my own mind I I'll tell you that before I talk about it but I'm just as positive as I'm standing here tonight that come aresh to me today from the almighty I'm not prone to uh just saying things like that when it comes to this part of the scripture God I'm I hope you're know what I'm talking about now you know you can't say things if something's supposed to be laying over here uh before it happens you you can't say it there something lays it over there see but are you reading are you listening to something now the seven seal r book is now being released by The Lamb we approach that place tonight God help us as the seals are broken and released the mysteries of the book are revealed now you see this is a sealed book now we believe that do we not we believe it it is a sealed book now we never know this before but it is it's sealed with Seven Seals that is on the back of the book the book is sealed with Seven Seals if we talked about this kind of book it would be like putting a strap across it seven straps but it isn't this kind of a book it's a scroll and then when the scroll is Unwound that's one that laying right in the scroll is number two and right here says what it is but it's a mystery but yet we have pred in it but remember the book is sealed and the book is the book of mystery of Revelation it is the revelation of Jesus Christ see a book of Revelation and now you know down through the age man has probed and tried to get into that we all had and yet one time I remember if if Mr Bohanan had to be present or or some of his people I I don't mean it by any insult Mr bannah is a bosm friend and is a superintendent of the public service and I was working there I first got saved I was telling about reading on the Book of Revelations he said I tried to read that thing he said and Mr Bohanan was a fine man and he uh he was a member of the church and and I don't know what all he belonged to but he said I think that John must have had a red pepper supper that night and when went to the bed on a full stomach I said to him although it could have cost my John I said aren't you ashamed to say that I was just a boy but I said aren't you ashamed to say that about the word of God yet just a kid no more than early maybe 21 22 years old and works scarce the depression on but yet there was a fear in there when I slanted here any slant towards God's word it's truth all truth so it was not even a dream or a nightmare it wasn't John eat he was on the aisle of patmas because he tried to put the word of God into a book form and was exiled there by the Roman government and was on the island on the day of the Lord and he heard behind him a voice of many Waters and turned to look and he saw seven golden candlesticks there stood the Son of God in between them now then the book is a revelation so a revelation is something that's made known of something something that's been revealed and now notice so you won't forget it it is closed up until the latter time the whole mystery of it is closed up until the latter times we find that in the scripture here now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken the time of redemption is over because the lamb left the intercession boat to walk out to take his claim he was a mediator between that but when the real Revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from from the sanctuary according to the word we read it last night it come from the out of the midst and tucked the book oh he's no more mediator because even they call him a line and that's the that's a king and he's not a mediator then although the actors of these seals begin at the first church age I remember so you you we'll get the background of it thoroughly if we can or as thoroughly as possible the actors I'll place it like that because um an actor is the man who changes Mass see and in this act tonight we're going to see that is Satan changing his MK and all actors Christ acting the part that he did when he become from a Spirit to man he only put on an actor's garment human flesh and came down in the form of a man in order to be a kinsman redeemer now now see it's only an actor's form that's reason they are all in Parables and and the way they are here like beast and animals so forth it's in an act and these actors began in the first church age because that was Christ revealing himself to the seven Church ages are you understanding all right see Christ revealing himself to the seven Church ages then through these Church ages there's a great mess up comes along then at the end of the church age the seventh Angels message message is to pick up these lost Mysteries and to give it to the church amen now we'll notice that but uh not then revealed in their true State now in the Bible times the Mysteries were there and they seen these things happen the way John saw it here now he said there is a white horse rider but what the mystery of it is there's a mystery that goes with that riter now what it was they didn't know but it's to be revealed but it is to be revealed after the lamb leaves the father's Throne of his intercessory as kinsman redeemer I'm going to drop a little something in here uh if anybody gets these tapes uh any man can speak whatever he wants to he has a right to for anything of his condition but if you don't if a minister doesn't want this amongst his people then tell him not to take it but I I this is amongst the people that I have been sent to speak to therefore I must reveal what is truth see now the lamb in the time of intercessory back here he knew that there were names in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world and as long long as them names had never been manifested on Earth as yet he had to stay there as intercessor you get it perfectly predestination see all right he had to stay there because he came to die for those that God had ordained to eternal life see by his for knowledge he saw him not by his own will his will was that none should perish but by his for knowledge he knew who would and who would not therefore as long as there was one name had never yet been cled declared in Earth Christ had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name but as soon as that final name had been splashed in that porox or bleach D his intercessory days was over let him that's filthy be filthy still let him it's holy he's holy still see and he leaves the sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment seat who unto those outside of Christ thing amen now notice but it's to be revealed when the lamb leaves his intercessory place from the father now that's Revelation 5 now he takes the book of seals the book of seals or a book seal with seals breaks them and shows them look at the end of the age at the essor over the church ages is done finished up you come in the first age Ephesian age reveal sent a messenger notice what happens as we go along here's the plan of it the first thing happens there is a uh an announcement in the heavens first what happens a seal is open what is that a mystery is unfolded see and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war a flag fall and a church age open see what is the war part the angel of the church catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery of God and then he goes forth to the people at the mystery's been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do out there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away asleep and then he drops a plague upon them who rejected it a temporary judgment and then after that is over then it goes on the denominate and bring in denominations and start off that man's work like of Wesley and all the rest of them and then it gets all in the scrapple again and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on Earth for a church age see then when he arrives he the the trumpet sounds he declares war see and then what happens finally then he's caught away and then when he's laid away then plag Falls destroys them spiritual death hits the church and she's gone that group then it goes on to another one oh it's a great plan until it comes to that last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in them other ages all the truths that wasn't truly revealed yet see as the Revelation come then he reveals those things in his day if you want to read it there it is Revelations 10 1 to one4 you'll get it all right see takes the book and of seals and breaks them and shows the seventh angel for this alone the mysteries of God is the ministry of the seventh angel now we just come through the church ages with even history improved that it is the the Angel's message of the seventh Church all right Reveals All the Mysteries that's been in the past all the things in the past Revelations 10: 1-7 that's the be I remember in the days of the seventh angel It's sounding forth blasting forth the gospel trumpet he is to finish all the mysteries of God just like here come forth in the early church ages we'll get it at a while of Doctrine then it become a saying first then a Doctrine and then become a statute then become a church and Through the Dark Ages and out of the Dark Ages come the First Reformation Luther and he brought with all kinds of mysterious things that happened during that church age all back in there then but he never finished it up then Along come Wesley with sanctification got some more of it still never finished it left Loose Ends everywhere such a sprankling instead of baptism and Luther T father son Holy Ghost instead of the Lord Jesus Christ all these different things that along come the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbage down on that now there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the Philadelphia the lady o see a age but then the we found in the studying of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age every time Paul come at the End of the Age we find out at irenius come to the End of the Age Martin End of the Age Luther the end of the Catholic age and Mark Wesley at the end of the the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the End of the Age of sanctification to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word as God helped me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the Ling of the church and then there's coming forth seven Myster ious Thunders that's not even written at all right and I believe that through those seven Thunders will be reveal in the last days in order to get the bride together for Rapture and Faith because what we got right now we we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther we we can't have enough faith for Divine Healing Harley we've got to have enough Faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this Earth and we'll find find that after a while the Lord's willing to find where it's written then all the judgments of these evil doers I see down to the ages of these seals has been breaken until now the last seal is broken and now as they uh as they have been watching in on these seals and just pursu presuming what they were doing now at the End of the Age of the church ages all these evil doers uh take place and head up in the tribulation all of these evildoers of the Seven Seals that's been working mysterious in the church and we'll find out in a minute it even worked in the name of a church they call themselves The Church you just see if that isn't right no wonder I've been so against denomination not knowing why see they end up now it starts back here in a mile Farm is keeps getting worse and worse on down until and people go right into it then oh yes this is just fine but in the last days these things are made known and they finally go so bad until they go come into the tribulation period and how can a man say that the bride of Christ goes into the tribulation I can't understand it she's tuck away from the tribulation if if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person ever born again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting in his words and the blood of Jesus that his confession is dropped into the Bible says so see he that that is born of God does not commit sin or he cannot s how can you make a man sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin there be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass there he cannot [Music] all [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] you h [Music] no the devil he don't like it talking about this good old way the devil he don't like it talking about the Lord so let's go

just looking forward to What the Lord Has for us amen St John chapter 16 it's our lord Jesus speaking to his disciples as we see the church now moving from the Lord being with them and he's now going away let's take verse number 20 verily verily I say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she rememberthe anguish for the joy that a man is Born Into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you amen we thank God for that amen it's just a title for the message this morning birth pains from within birth pains from within we'll take one more scripture and that's found in the Old Testament Genesis chapter number 30 how many you like the Old Testament yeah it's beautiful and when Rachel saw verse one when Rachel saw that she bear Jacob no children Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob give me children or else I die and Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel and he said am I in God's St Dead who hath withheld from Thee the fruit of the womb and she said behold my maid bah go into her and she shall bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her amen may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word God bless you you may be seated amen birth pains from within now we see that uh Jesus now is speaking to the church to the Believers as they are about to he's going to Calvary he's going to depart from them and they of course have many questions as to how this is all going to take place their leader their Master is leaving from them and he's preparing them for uh the sorrow tomorrow that is to come and in preparing them he uses an illustration of a pregnant lady it calls the labor pains or the birth pains and he gives that illustration that while she's pregnant and have those pains and those labor pains you can now determine how far along she is um there's a weight gain there's different changes going on in her body um they're not all comfortable and even when the time of the birth takes place there's extreme sorrow uh many many women don't make it through the birth uh there's many that die over the years we've gotten better at doing that but it's always a very very delicate um it's a delicate procedure there we we do it all the time we see it display all the time we're all here because we experienced it uh we were born but it's still a very delicate time it the the the woman is is compromised the baby is compromised and these lives is not a guarantee that this will come forth in a success there's many cases of stillborns or the B the mother dying and the child living or the child dying and the mother living or both dying we see this with with Rachel when she had birthed her first son Joseph and it was this great desire for her to have children but she was Barren we read the scripture there that we just read there in Genesis Chapter 30 that her sister Leah had children and when she saw that she could have no children Rachel that she envied her sister now this Envy is the same word used when Joseph's brothers envied him it was Envy it's used in a number of places in the scripture is also it's it's used the same as jealousy um but um this this Envy the the the the the the inhabitants of the land that were sewing with Isaac in Genesis chapter 26 you'll see that those people begin to Envy Isaac because the Lord was blessing him not so much I mean we can all have stuff but when you have plants or people or things that animals things that are alive that are increasing I mean even if it's a pig and you have little piglets you want to see those pigs grow if they're healthy they will grow and they grow by the birth and this is how the Lord actually grew Israel he grew a nation through two mothers through the birth and this this birth Jesus is now giving his disciples this example that while there is great sorrow there's great stress and uh but your sorrow is going to be turned into Joy after after this birth takes place to where you you won't even she doesn't even remember the mother doesn't even remember the pains so much to where this you know they might say I'll never do that again but then you look at them 5 years down the road they got four or five kids and so say what you want to is what you doing is what we look at and because you don't remember the pain you don't remember all of the those delicate times because the joy is so great The Joy the prize is so great that it's worth going through the pain and if you a Christian today you're going to go through the pain you're going to go through the test Jesus did all of his disciples did but let's go back in the Old Testament just for a little bit and deal with Rachel just for a moment and her sister Leah if we take Genesis chapter 29 in verse number 18 this is the conflict we talked about last Sunday that it's it's almost like God started it or God allowed it Genesis 29:8 and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve the seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter and laan said it is better that I give her to thee that I should give give her to another man abide with me and Jacob served seven years for Rachel they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her and Jacob said unto laan give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her and laan gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laan gave unto his daughter Leah zipa his maid for handmade it came to pass that in the morning behold It was Leah and he said to laan what is this that thou H has done unto me did not I serve thee with for Rachel wherefore hast thou beged me laben said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn you see that firstborn position again right there this is where the conflict starts is because Jacob wants to marry the younger sister and agreed to marry her but she was not the firstborn so Leah actually had that position and God respected this and look at verse number 30 one and when the Lord saw that Leah was hated he opened her W womb but Rachel was Barren so who's in control of that who who caus one to have children and the other one to not have children who's in control of that the Bible says that God saw Leah and he opened her womb and gave her children because he saw that she was hated and she conceived again and bear her son and said because the Lord had heard that I was hated he have therefore given me this son and she called his name Simeon let's take verse 32 just for a moment Leah conceived and bear son and she called his name Ruben for she said surely the Lord have looked upon my Affliction now therefore my husband will what this is what she's looking for will love me she conceived again and bear a son and said because the Lord hath heard that I was hated he hath therefore given me this son who was hating her yeah husband wasn't loving her so the opposite of that is hate and Lord you saw that I'm being hated in this contract so you give me another son I'm going to name him like that too she called his name Simeon verse 34 and she conceived again and bear a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have borne in him three sons therefore was his name called Levi notice that the mention of her husband or uh being joined to him the Love is All intertwined into the naming of these boys it's a conflict it's stressful no you took my husband no you took my husband now I was it was just agreement well you know our in the rules of our land and this conflict ensues God allows the conflict to ensue and she's having these children now my husband will love me now my husband will join with me oh because the Lord saw that I was hated now now constantly this is the burden this is the cry finally she gets to Judah and this is the first time she that she actually acknowledges the Lord and she conceived again and bear a son and she says now will I praise the Lord there therefore she called his name Judah and left baring now Judah is a very popular tribe if you follow that's the tribe that our lord Jesus comes through that's where the scepter is it's laying in that tribe and it looks like Jacob has done wrong and he probably is done wrong but God allowed it and all of these boys being born through Leah born through Rachel born through their hands Maids what's God doing he's building a nation he's building a people and the way brother random uh brings it to us it's so nice I've read it multiple times and I'll read it again for you this morning he said those labor pains that the Hebrew mothers were in the the conflict that they were in the stress that they were under caused this building of the house it wasn't all smiles it wasn't we all getting along together there's you know there's little little conflict little Envy little strife and God allows this and this is what happens when a woman is being ready to deliver a child they begin to time those birth pains brother vom takes the scripture St John 16 and as we read there and he preaches the message birth pains and remember that in this great uh Ministry that we're in today uh we're called to the adoption we're not called just to be church members we're called to this glorious adoption you say well what is the adoption it's mentioned a number of times in the scriptures Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 9 Galatians chapter 4 Ephesians chap 1 says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ so we know that our our our final inheritance for the believer as it pertains to our Earthly journey is an adoption and that adoption is actually the Redemption of our bodies our bodies are going to be redeemed praise the Lord now there is an adoption and that adoption Saints is for the believer now now whether we hear about it or whether we keep that as a goal or whether we read the quotes on it or the scriptures on it it's still a reality and that adoption is for believers that's our final you know Jesus was adopted on Mount Transfiguration hear ye him remember he had his Earthly Ministry just a regular preacher maybe just a man in the neighborhood that had gifts signs and wonders but we find out he's just not like any other preacher and then he prophesies thing that come to pass like any other Prophet then we find out he's not like any other Prophet then he makes claims that nobody else made he said you destroy this Temple I'll pick it back up again in three days days except you believe that I am he you will die in your sins I am my father are one who can make those claims nobody talk like that when you see me you see the father who can make those claims can nobody talk like that but Jesus and he had his ministry and his his work in his ministry grew up to the place where he had a great following lots of love lots of cheerfulness but then he started to bring the word and the word now starts to separate because there's a birth taking place let me take a few quotes here for you in the message adoption and this is the adoption number one paragraph number 48 I read it for you before I read it again so Ephesus here sets us like Joshua positionally you notice Joshua as after crossing over the land and taking the land then he divided the land Ephraim here manancis here this one here Gad here Benjamin here he divided the lands speaking about Joshua and notice oh this just burns our hearts each one of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the Promised Land oh it's great it's a great study if we only go into the details which would take hours and after hours someday when I get our church I'd like to come and take a solid month or two just stay right with it watch when each of those mothers when she called out Ephraim when she was in labor positionally placed him where his feet was setting in oil just exactly everyone of them wherever they were at and Joshua not knowing this but by inspiration LED of the Holy Spirit after being in the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit promised through the birth back there how that God has set some in the church who said it in the church talk to him about it God has set some in the church through the labor pains oh they get tremendous some times when the church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was to Pentecost how they groan and cry under labor pains but when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelist then he gives in there speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles now and brother man said this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner so now these gifts that brother Ram is talking about that God plac into the church they're always going to have conflict surrounding them there's always going to be misunderstanding around it there's always going to be those that want it those that don't want it and those that don't even care but God has placed this in his church he designed it he ordered it he put he puts the gifts in there and as we heard on Sunday night he expects us to respect them we don't understand them we don't even always agree with them but we respect them and with the conflict that surround the gifts all the time it's always been that way there's a group that wants to pull this way another one that says it's it's too messy it's not clean enough it's there's too much you know you got false spirits that get in there true you got people that don't have a gift and they say they do that's true that's everywhere you go you have people that are oper operating and say they're called and they're not really called that's true you have people that make a bad name for Christianity they get on the TV there and they represent Christianity and do things that's horrible and then and then it it causes others to stumble that's true but you still got to read what the Bible said the Bible said that God set some in the church and if God put them in there God is the one that taking care of his church it's not your church it's not my church it's God's church can I get a witness sir but through the labor pains through the Pains of criticism through the Pains of your life trying to draw closer to him you'll be criticized there's pains there's sorrow but through that there's a church being born there's a people there's a gift being developed you know it it's you know we we want we want to see the gift already perfected we want a 40y old preacher just to come out and no make no mistakes but you got little you got little junior junior preachers coming up right where where are they supposed to exercise their gift is there any Grace for them oh we we I can't sit listen to him because I know more than him my goodness is that how you raise your children is that how you build a young man in your home is that how you treat somebody how to ride a bicycle or let alone um handle any kind of responsibility I mean are they going to be Flawless without mistake so it creates this fear that nobody wants to even try to exercise even an inkling of a gift that their Heavenly Father might be leading them to go forward under this gift but if I make a mistake then I got a false anointing on me so I'll just sit back in my Pew and do nothing like everybody else is doing nothing but I'm so glad that the Holy Ghost knows how to call a man and God doesn't call Men by us other men he calls Men by himself he knows where you live he knows how to get a hold of you he knows how to minister to you and speak to you where you know it's him and he'll put a fire in your bones and you say it's like fire shut up in my bones I can't keep quiet I got to tell somebody the Milkman I got to tell somebody the grocery store I got to tell somebody that's that's what God does now man they want to do the choosing and the picking but I'm so glad that God does this and so it's through these birth pains that we see um that God allows this Dynamic of this house to be built now in the adoption I want to talk on that just for a moment this is should be a goal for every believer it's part of what the statue of a perfect man was all about you remember the the message we were uh ask you all to listen to the Statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names how many remember that couple of you remember statue of a perfect man it's really a message of about the history of the church it's a message about the ages of the church it's a message about you the believer and this is the building up in these virtues in second Peter chapter 1 that Peter says that that you be not Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord that you'll be fruitful that your your life will not be Barren as it pertains to the things of the Lord now in the adoption just want to touch on that just a little bit of course we know there's a ceremony that takes place and the the son is born into a family and that family Paul talks about it in the scriptures I gave you four or five different places Galatians r Roman and Ephesians talks about that that how a son is Born Into the family but he's placed under tutors and under the tutorship he's growing he's always a son because of the birth he was born in that family then he gets to a place where he now takes on more responsibility he's a son but now he's a mature son and the prophet of God deals with this in a couple of messages I just want to touch those to bring our mind to what our goals should be and what we should be looking forward to in the message everlasting life and how to receive it the prophet of God says this here paragraph number 110 and now when the Pentecostal church and these people in the last days here has begun to find the new birth being born again they thought that settled it no sir your ups and downs ins and outs and things like that God can't place you as a son but when you stay in the Kingdom stay in the gospel stay night one of these days or stay right one of these days God will call you out and set you aside adopt you as his son before the people and give you something that will shake the nations with it see what I mean it's the adoption into the family prophet of God continues in the message the position of a Believer paragraph number 50 he says this here now into his church you that's positionally he seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus be humble Brethren someday the holy spirit will speak to you call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin on the hillside or in the washroom somewhere and there will anoint you you for a certain service or a certain thing to do it won't be the laying hands of the prors or Elders it'll be the laying hands of God Almighty himself to put a new ministry in you and a new robe on you and set you out as an example all the demons out of Torment will never upset you God grant my brethren that will each one receive this blessing amen can the church say amen amen Prophet continues in the message the position of a Believer he continues on in paragraph number 20 4 now this epistle the letter to the Ephesians was written to Believers not to the outside world this is Believers that's why I thought this afternoon first I test and see if there's groups of unbelievers and sinners then I couldn't speak on this here but now seeing that it is for the Believers and the Believers are present I thought it would be good if we let the believer see where he is now try hard Christians to understand that this day that the message has been placing the believer in position of place if every believer in here was in their place well I'm so thankful that we're their whole rows of wheelchairs set there's only about two or three left in here if every believer knew their place lady on aot the man with the crutches along there there would not be a feeble person in this building in the next 20 minutes that's right if every man could simply find his place his or her place in Christ Jesus what a difference it would make now I know people filled your mind rolling fast now uh brother bam continues on paragraph 29 now the Holy Ghost will heal every person in here if your work according to the plan and will uh the plan and will of the Holy scriptures there's not enough there there's enough Christians in this city today enough Christians in this building today to close the heavens over Phoenix did you know that but you got to work according to the will of the spirit now that's what we're trying to do today is to place the believer in his right position so he can see where he's at how you going to do just running away you're just beating the air you get what I mean so the prophet is telling us that if the believer each believer can find their position then there wouldn't be a feeble one among us we would know where we stand the the presence of the Lord would would be there if we can find our place and what places us the word of God places us the message of the hour places us it shows us where to stand and how we ought to stand the prophet of God continues in the message hear ye him paragraph 112 he says this here now you love the Lord this morning said let's drop back time's about gone but I want to get something to you Peter got all excited the supernatural had been done there stood Moses and Elijah both been dead for years here they were standing alive standing there with Jesus Witnesses two of the mightiest prophets That Ever Walked the Earth standing by the side to watch God adopt his son and give him all the powers in the heavens and the Earth give in unto his hands so he's talking about Matthew chapter 17 where the Lord was transfigured before Peter James and John and there stood Moses and Elijah on Mount Transfiguration this is a scripture he's referring to two of the mightiest prophets standing by each side of him he says give him all the powers in the heavens and earth give unto his hands and he will do for you the same if you'll stand after you receive the Holy Ghost and make yourself a Christian and act like a Christian should if you put your face in God's word and your eyes towards heaven and let your pants legs be bagged at the knees be reverent before God there'll be someday that God will take you over to a side over to a side one where and give to you a power and a gift that the whole world will know he's been with you that's placing a son to his position hallelujah oh I feel religious right now yes he'll do it he promised it he's the unfailing god well the church has missed it just saying well I spoke with tongues I got it now you just got started sure that's the reason today we find people so against the supernatural against the things of God is because they've been disobedient if they had lived up in that realm where they should be they recognize those things so here the prophet is absolutely absolutely placing this adoption in our hands today amen now are you adopted and placed that's a good question for each of you or do you know of anyone that has been in this age I've often this is my own personal opinion I've always I've often referred to our dear brother Billy Paul I believed he was adopted in placed I do that's my personal opinion I saw the life he Liv I saw the ministry he had and God used him has a tremendous witness is that right Saints when he told the stories he brought you to where the story took place you can feel he's telling the truth that was absolutely the placing of God I believe that I believe that now do we know of other believers that have been adopted in the scriptures do we find this terminology now well not so much we don't see that terminology so much but brother bam here gives us this example of Jesus being adopted and placed on Mount Transfiguration when the voice Cried Out hear ye him and from there he had a short quick work from there to Calvary now he always manifest the the the signs and wonders and miracles but his ministry got to the place where it's now being crowned and capped to its full maturity now for our age and this is not my opinion this is a fact I believe maybe it's still my opinion I believe this Bible is true that's my opinion but I believe it's a fact too but I believe that brother brandham was adopted in place and I read some quotations for you here in just a moment but you know this this new birth and then this sealing of the Holy Ghost and being sealed for um for for the great body change that's going to take place that's what we're headed to as a body change to with the Redemption of our bodies the oldness of our bodies will vanish away we'll receive a healing like never before and you talk about a new birth you're talking about moving from one stage to the next as vam tells us we're birthed into each of those virtues there's a birth here a birth here a birth here first you're born into the family by the Holy Ghost that's the new birth you're a Christian but now you have to walk circumspectly and you have to add to your faith virtue and add to your virtue knowledge and Temperance and all of those godliness and patience and brotherly kindness and then be capped with the love of God and then be ready for the Rapture this is a this is a this is a work that we we're all in this work we're all you know looking in the mirror of our of the word of God to find out where we are in this pyramid where where am I at Lord is there another birth another baptism for me brother bam says and here himm 1960 says paragraph 38 placing of a son take him out in a certain place have a ceremony before the Angels Place him positionally positionally what he is in the body of Christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you count me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that I'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the Holy Spirit Will so anoint the people till they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen Powers likes coming into the church now I know it for a fact say to this mountain be moved now are you looking for that power uh-huh he continues on in the message here hym 1960 in July paragraph number 64 what God wants to do with this church tonight wants to do with the individual is find somebody finding the holy spirit is searching to find men he can take him out to a certain place speak to that person anoint them and give them something special great powers and gifts to work his will and to do his will but how can he do it when he's constantly has to come up and say oh it's terrible they just they just run after this they run after error they won't go to church they they look what a condition the church is in so if God can't do it to the body he will pick out individuals and do it God's able of these stones to rise children unto AB Abraham so it's no longer waiting for the group to get ready he will pick individuals out and perform this adoption ceremony upon them now that's what we're looking for that's what we long for this is this is not just being born again we thank God for the new birth and born again we thank God for receiving the Holy Ghost but it's baptism upon baptism upon baptism of that same holy ghost that caps the believer and seals him and places him yes sir don't you thank the Lord for that now this this adoption is spoken of and as brother Brandon brings that message statue of a perfect man he brings that were birth into this we're birth into this we're birth into this and what is a birth a birth is a changing you're leaving one world to go into another that the ninth month that that child has been forming in the womb and then now it's going to be birthed into a a outside world that he knows nothing about it's a timing Port if it is timing it's the health of that child and of the mother it's nature taking its course there's going to be sorrow there's going to be pain but when the birth takes place we'll all be happy and joy will fill all of those that are a part of it after it takes place this birth these birth pains these are these are uh uh what God allows this just as he did with Jacob and Esau take one scripture in Genesis 25 we turn there quickly so we see how the Lord built the house of Israel with Rachel Leah billah and handmaids and so forth they were built up that way believe Joseph had a wife from Pharaoh he had Ephraim and manasse and that those tribes were built up from this birth and Genesis CH 25 and verse number 19 says this here these are the generation of Isaac Abraham's son Abraham begot Isaac and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of bethu the Syrian of Pam Aram sister to laan the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was Barren and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled within her and she said if it be so why am I thus and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb two manner of people shall be separated from thy vows and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger so first this barrenness is one of the curses that many times many times is a curse that God will put on a woman that she can't have children cuz he's correcting her the case with David's wife Michel when she cursed him and spoke against him dancing and doing what he did the Lord caused this barrenness to to strike her but in Exodus 34 um Exodus 23 rather one of the blessings for the children of Israel was that they would not be Barren Deuteronomy 7:14 says that there will be no Barren men or women among you and so it was part of the blessing of the Lord was to cause fruitfulness not just in the land with the trees that you're growing not just in the animal herds that you're raising but amongst you and your wife and your son's wife wife and your daughter's husband and the family structure there is a blessing in this birth actually we're going to build our family through the birth and this is that's in the natural Israel in the spiritual side God builds the church through the birth it's the new birth and the growth of any Church the real growth of a church I'm not talking about numbers of people but I'm talking about the births that take place in that church that that is dependent upon that growth is dependent upon births taking place in the church you see a church that doesn't grow it's Barren it's hit a dead end it's stagnant it's because the people in there at hit a dead end they're stagnant and it's not about old people or young people it's about not producing fruit and when you stop growing that's a problem when you stop bearing fruit then that's a problem and the answer to this is to have these virtues in you that you will not be Barren or unfruitful and these virtues come into you Birth by birth by birth by birth and it's sad that many Christians come to church they reach a plateau in their Revelation they reach a stagnant in their service to God they used to witness but they don't do that anymore they used to study but they study that subject already they used to be enthused with the word enthused with the message but but now it's become how long we going to be there or what can we be entertained by is the pastor funny enough or do we have cookies and coffee at the end of the service what can they give us for entertainment is there a basketball team that I can join what can I do what can I it's like it's become a lodge or some kind of game that we play when really the church is born it grows through the birth and if there is no birth then you need to be like Isaac and entreat the Lord for my wife Rebecca she can't have no children Lord what's going on here he entreated the Lord and the Lord heard him and opened up her womb heard Rachel open up her womb he'll hear you and birth into you a life something different than where you are now you've hit a dead end you had a coldest sack and you've parked there and you're okay you're familiar everything is safe everything is comfortable you know the neighbors they know you but maybe God wants you out of that neighborhood go down a street you never been down before talk to somebody you wouldn't think of talking to before and let some excitement handle your life you say well if that happens I'll lose control exactly you need to lose control that mother giving birth to that baby it's all about the birth a lot going on there and this birth needs to take place in the individual's life now these two boys are represented here in the Old Testament Esau and Jacob they come from the same mother same father but they're actually struggling in the womb before we get to Genesis 2 finish up Genesis 25 let's run over to Romans chapter9 quickly and let's see what the Bible says about them Romans 9 and verse number 11 and the Bible says for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I love but Esau have I hated now look at that there it was God's purpose he did it on purpose it is his purpose to allow this to take place just like with Leah and Rachel it's God's purpose he purposed that Joseph would be gifted and he knew that Joseph's gifts would be the problem his brothers would have with him is that right let me take one quote for you in the Statue of a perfect man here quickly while I'm on on that point paragraph number 79 statue of a perfect man look at Joseph born a spiritual boy among a bunch of Brethren they were all good men all of them Patriarchs but when Joseph come he was different he could see Visions interpret dreams he was hated of his Brethren because of that because of the very work that God had put him on Earth to do his brothers hated him for it see and it was all pointing to Christ and look he was sold for almost 30 pieces of silver by his Brethren thrown into a ditch to be dead by his Brethren was took up from that ditch went and sat on the right hand of pharaoh and no man could come to pharaoh who controlled the world of that day no one could come to Pharaoh only through through Joseph so that was Joseph's purpose his whole purpose in life was to preserve and extend the life of his Brethren so what does God do God gives him a gift gives him a calling gives him a revelation gives him birth gives him fertility blesses him anoints him and with any gift any calling you're going to have those that Envy you the young people call them haters you going to have the haters now because of the gift and it was God who gave it to him because he gave it to him because that was his purpose and we see that repeat again even today look at even with with with Joseph he he goes down as a slave remember he enters Egypt probably less valuable just a slave like any other slave but let let him keep living now let those dreams begin to happen and we see his value begin to raise even though he's a slave he's in potterer house he don't own nothing he's just a slave but God is with him and God is anointing him and as God is blessing him and anointing him you don't need everybody to like you you don't even need to be free you don't need a background of this and the history of that all you need is the favor of the Lord and he was in Piper's house a slave and God is raising him up raising him up raising him up and then the men saw the anointing on him and they recognize him others see the anointing they recognize him and here Satan pulls him down throws him back into prison again here he's in prison now and he's in prison just being who he is still gifted still anointed and God starts to work with him in prison work says it's not what you know it's who you know that's exactly the truth if you know him and he knows you that's all you need to know that's all the blessing you need in your life in prison okay we'll make you in charge of these prisoners yeah we know you're innocent we all innocent too wink wink raising them up raising them up two men have a dream tells a dream remember me the dream comes to pass they forget about him two years pass tell if anybody could be bitter it could be Joseph he did nothing wrong he's serving time in a foreign land no birthday parties no family members no family visits hasn't seen his daddy for years but yet he kept his Integrity kept his testimony kept his name before God spotless I won't do that because it's God that I'm serving what God what kind of God you serving you got God in your life look where you at you in prison like the rest of us we're bums and you're a bum with us but no no no I'm gifted I'm anointed I feel his presence in my life and I'm going to be what God called me to be and God rais him up raise him up and then finally his day comes calls him out of the prison interprets the dream overnight the shift the wealth of Joseph shifted overnight and look at the wealth how God Did It He blesses Joseph and by blessing Joseph He blesses Egypt and Egypt increases in wealth increases in wealth increases in dries up all the other lands and No Other Nation like Egypt and Joseph's right on the top of all of it saves his daddy his mother another Pharaoh comes that doesn't know Joseph and they go after the Jews and so now the persecution starts and it's wealthy great economy very valuable lots of money all the wealth because Joseph interpreted a dream but now God's going to shift all that wealth back to the Jews Now isn't he what does he do he raises up a Moses amongst them and all that wealth is now transferred in him now look at same thing happened with Jacob notice Jacob when he comes to laan he's after his family he's running from Esau he's a slave in his own land you'd say can't go back home Esau wants to kill him he shows up nothing broke know a few servants a few this and that but he is blessed now he got this Daddy's blessing upon him he's still got that name issue he's a deceiver now but he's blessed and his heart is right and that's what God was looking at God was looking at his heart he took that birth right and there that birth begin to make him a new man here he is working working working and as Jacob is blessed his father-in-law and all of his house is blessed all the cattle being begin to grow and Leon and Rachel and he has Joseph he says I got to get out of here he leaves out of there and hear the persecution begins to start with him and we see this in the life and the ministry of our Lord Jesus remember he came along illegitimate birth bad name on him but he was anointed though and that anointing led him and he grew in the power of the spirit the people packed out to hear him preach he laid hands on the sick they recovered he raised the dead and his ministry grew and grew until they turned on him and that happens to any gift or any anointing they will turn because there's two Spirits working in the realm of the church realm we see it happen in the life and Ministry of brother brandham same thing first pool right look at his birth you know dad was a this and that in his family background drunkers and Bootleggers but God chose him out of that and then Rose him up didn't know who he was after a while we find out who he is he's raised up come preach for for us come for us raise them up power of the spirit gifts like we've never seen before who can replace it today they can't they're still looking for a reason or somebody to take his place a a benie hen or another Reverend so and so TD Jake or another gifted whoever and whatever and they fall like you know you know their Folly is made known but here clean life raised in the power of the spirit everybody wanted to have him until he started to bring the word and now that rub and that edge and that fight begins and why is that this happens because those two boys are represented in good and in evil and that is what's what's in the church today I'm going to close with this right here and this is very this is a reality of what we're fighting against you know it's always you see some kind of blessing or some kind of growth you see your heart trying to do what's right and you'll make an effort for God before God and you try to go forward and do what's right and it's like the enemy comes after you it's like it was better for you not to even try it seems it gets more tense full more stressful he preach on the Holy Ghost it looks like it gets harder to preach on it and people clam up even even more and you play the tape and you listen to the tape but the pressures of the world are still there what's taking place well we hope it's a birth that's taking place for your sorrow will be turned into Joy you take a stand for what's right don't matter what happens in your life you take a stand for what is right and the joy is on its way amen amen so the prophet of God says it like this I take 15 minutes okay it's only 11:45 for those of you that need to know I just said it so cuz we both know I know what time it is I know you know what time it is but you don't know if I know what time it is I know what time it is and it's not that late can I get a witness amen here what the prophet of God says here in this message hearing and recognizing and acting upon the word paragraph number nine now we are fully acquainted we people who search the scriptures day and night and read our papers and hear the news commentators that this world is now standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces and they are both religious forces and I believe that these great forces are soon coming to a head and both of these great forces was represented in these two sons of Isaac how that God in his infinite wisdom has foreshadowed all things to us that we might by these things know of a certain what lays before us made it so plain that God in his word and the nature and this universe is so perfectly arranged together that even The Sinner can see something is fixing to take place God Is So arranged it no one is without excuse now we see in these two sons that when they before they were even born they were at war with one another even though their virgin mother for she was a virgin the beautiful Rebecca that married the righteous seed of God's promise Isaac that they were too consecrated spirit filled Believers of God on God for ordained to the very marriage that they were United together by God fornew it and how could such a thing come through one mother by one father one a very evil person the other another one very good person how did that good person look to be evil and the evil look to be the good we would know today as the law of contrast that where there is good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either because Paul said when I would do good then evil is present The Sinner will never be able to shake away from the Christian the Christian from The Sinner there will be a witness there of right and a testimony of wrong always and you make your choice you have to take one side or the other amen can you say praise the Lord Amen brother bam goes on in that message and he says that they the spirit one was uh the spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today it's coming to to ahead paragraph 20 now the spiritual believer and the carnal man the carnal believer no one can say that they wasn't both religious they were they didn't say that one served an idol the other one God they were both Servants of God now pay close attention to the scriptures now on this subject because I sure it'll help you see not everyone that sayth Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven now you know notice Jacob had one thing he wanted because according to the word the blessings and the good thing laid in the birthright and Jacob was his only object that was his only objective the only thing he had in his mind was get that Birthright Esau despised it the one that actually had it despised it and he was a he was a oh excuse me Esau despised it the one that actually had it despised it or he was ashamed of it but Jo Jacob wanted it regardless of how he got it he wanted it that's the way with the spiritual believer today he doesn't care how much you laugh at him how much fun you make how ridiculous he has to act to the carnal mind his only objective is the birthright he wants to get to God cuz it's born in him he can't help it is that where you are is that where you stand as a Believer how many of you could backslide if you wanted to how many can just up and leave you can't if you're a True Believer you just can't this is this is what you are this is who you are and all all the believer is concerned with is that Birthright more than anything else the birth the birth right the next birth the next birth you know the scripture says add to your faith virtue and to your virtue knowledge and Temperance and it's like it almost looks like we're adding something from the outside on top of what we already have but that's not the way the prophet brings it he says that those things are actually born in you so they birth from within and that's where it's taking place it's like you are having a son and you're having another son and you're having another son and you're having a daughter and another son and you're building up this stature of a perfect man it's birth into this birth into this birth into this and the True Believer is really only concerned about that Birthright that's his great desire now this birth and this power of evil and good we see it displayed in these two boys and we see it now say I take my last set of quotes out of the message birth pains and brother brandham is bringing this birth pains and how that these birth pains they uh the natural types to spiritual then he brings in the distress and the sorrow and then there's why there's so many still births today then he says after your birth you never go backward spiritually you always go forward in your growth as believer and he talks about the world has gone through these birth planes through the world wars that's that's what a birth pain is it's the entire world going through the issues and problems that it has and it's actually The Messengers that God sends a prophet to bring the birth pains because what does the prophet say a prophet says you've been moving like this but now it's time to move into another dimension another level so you're building a wall but now we have to turn a corner cuz we're actually building a house or building a building and God is building a house he's building a building and he uses a prophet to turn those Corners he sends a prophet at the junction of time time to bring us to a new phase of Christianity or a new phase of our walk with the Lord and it's birth after birth after birth and those birth pains are coming from within and those struggles come from within I'll just read a couple quotes here and we'll close in the birth pains paragraph 42 I want to speak this afternoon upon the subject that I announc birth pains now that sounds very bad but it's in the Bible I believe Jesus here was speaking he said you'll have sorrow but your sorrow will be turned to Joy speaking to his disciples here knowing that the birth of Christianity was coming into existence now the old has to die in order that the new is born to have anything gives birth has to have Pains of distress and they certainly was going to go through the pain of distress and anguish to get from the law unto Grace normal natural birth types the spiritual birth all things of the natural is types of the spiritual we find out we look out here on the ground we see a tree in the earth growing it's struggling for life that goes to show that there's a tree somewhere that doesn't die because it's crying out for something paragraph 55 he says this here I think a baby is born just by still birth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children that's right they need a gospel spanking you see so to wake them up to bring them to themselves so that God can breathe the breath of life into them now we find that that's so true it's crude theology but it's true anyhow so notice in the seed's birth the old seed must die before the new one can be born so therefore death is hard and anytime so it's painful it's distressful birth is the same because you're bringing the life into the world and it's it's painful Jesus said his words was a seed that a sar went forth to se now we're all acquainted with that I want to teach this like Sunday school lessons because it is a Sunday notice then this word being a seed but remember the seed is only bringing forth new life when it dies and that's the reason it was so hard for them Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law and the law was the word of God In seed form but when the word was made flesh and become not law but Grace now Grace and law cannot exist at the same time so we see the Pharisees couldn't accept Jesus because two different Ministries are taking place they're leaving that and being birthed into something else and this happens to the believer over and over again if this is not happening to the believer then there's a problem there if we're satisfied in our elves there's a problem in there you're satisfied in your your ministry and the calling of God in your life you're satisfied with no growth and you don't know whether you're adopted or placed or not and then it's like do you even care to know would you like to know how it works are you interested to know how it works the technicality of it yes you want to know that's why it was preached so you could know it it's like well you know I can't figure it out so I'll just leave it alone well what you listen why you got your Bible why are you eating food do you know every ingredient in that ham sandwich or what you ate for Thanksgiving you don't know every ingredient but you're a human being and you have to eat and when you eat it becomes one with you and you grow and you mature and that's the same thing with the word natural types of spiritual little children can't explain all what they're eating but they must eat need a healthy diet in order to grow and we should be growing we should be growing spiritually our maturity for the gifts our maturity for his word our desire for the lost our desire to see the Holy Ghost have its way our desire to see a baby born don't you want to see that in your church or you just want another member to join you don't care about it's not about another member joining we want to see a child born by a new birth and that child might be me might be you another birth another birth is that right Saints that should be our desire our great desire two more quotes is that okay 77 in birth pains that's the same thing in the New Birth we never go back but we go forward when we're born again and that's why I think today we have so many not so many rather genuine new births is because the seed is maybe will sympathize with the word or the person but they don't want to rot away from the old system that they were in they don't want to come out they want to stay in the old system and claim the new birth or the message of the age we found that under Luther Wesley Pentecostals and all the other ages they still try to hold on to their old system and claim this but the old system age must die rot in order bring forth the new one they still want to clean notice they know the old system is there but they just don't want to rot out of it now rot is when it's really done away with when a claim is made that they are newborn but a claim is only a begotten sign rotten brings forth the new birth amen paragraph 86 we are told by God's prophets that we are to have a new Earth a new Heaven and a new Earth if you want the scripture on that Revelations 21 can quote it for you John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth was passed away it was gone now we're here to have a new Earth the old Earth and the new Earth cannot exist at the same time or the new world and the old world cannot exist at the same time there can't be two World orders together at the same time now in order to get the new Earth the old one has to die now the old one has to die then it's giving birth pains for a new one now then if the doctor went to examine a patient that was in labor now the one things that the doctors would do which I'm taking in I'm talking in the presence of two or three I know good medical doctors Christian doctors I would ask you this one of the first thing the doctor does after he's been watching the patient is to time the pains the birth pains he times the pains how close they are together how much more terrific each one gets one is more hard harder to have than the other one next one still harder closer together that's the way he diagnoses the case by the birth pains well if the world has to give away to the birth of a new world let's just examine some of the birth pains we're having on the earth and then we'll see about what day and just about how far she's the in her labor has the world experienced any birth pains has our world even our laws our politics have they experienced birth pain pains look at church as we know it today have they experienced a pain has there been sorrow associated with what we knew to be Bible truths now it's just a big it's argument it's a argument constant pains and birth pains but God sends a messenger and those pains are sent on purpose I apologize I can't finish this message this morning but this great message of adoption is for the believer but God actually gives us an example of one that goes before us and that is adopted it's called the first fruits and many times we'll hear a teaching on the adoption and we're going up in the Statue of a perfect man and there's a power going to come and then they they they leave out the messenger's place in that power coming and the first the second and the third pool were absolutely the ministry of the prophet and in this message is the rising of the sun he brings it out that there must be a mature son that is placed out before us it's the sheath of it's the example do you have an example to compare your Christianity too I'm talking about your message Church Christianity what is your rule your standard what are you measuring it by so as a gospel preacher or teacher or Pastor or Christian or Sunday school teacher anybody that handles the word those challenges remain are you adopted and placed if not where are you at on the stature of a perfect man do you even care or does it even matter is there a birth laying in the in your future is there a birth for you do you desire that what church is going to give it to you do you have to move cross town to get it you have to leave overseas to get it or does God place that in you through the word that he's given to you in this day and this is the birth this is the pain and sorrowful this is that anguish that we should experience like I Isaac when he looked at his wife and she couldn't have no children and we're supposed to have children so he entreated the Lord for this change that take place in his wife and we have to entreat the Lord for that change to take place in us I believe that with all my heart birth pains from within Lord willing we can finish just another time because there is an example that has come in our day and and it's sad that that many the Ministries are trying to you know what I have to read this last quote okay let me read this last one in the birth pains I didn't get it but brother bam says this is all right who needs some water can you wait getting water right now thank you you're getting water yes let me read this for you okay two minutes I I cut this off short because I'm feeling a little nervous but I want to read this for you here all right this is in the birth pains he's bringing this in Phoenix to a group there and I I can't leave this paragraph 165 each of the messengers of their age Rock back to the word the message of their age the message of according to the Bible I got coming a book out on the commentary the first four chapters of Revelation read it soon as we get it on press and it proves we a Shadow of Doubt what Luther's message was justification sanctification is the next process is the natural birth then come the Pentecostal was exactly now notice each age Rock the church and give it birth pains but what did it they do after the birth Pains come instead of going on with the word that got a bunch of men together just like the first one did exactly right and after the rocking of the apostles then we find her going off again then we find out Along come many of the others agabus and many of the Great reformers back in the beginning each AE each age had done and and we find out long come each age had done as you study the pre n Council the Nan fathers and all back you find it all there each age was rocked every time a messenger come forth with thus sayith the Lord now she's in the worst stage that according to the scripture that she's ever been we are in the leodan church age a rich but blinding Church age that don't know it there wasn't nowhere in the Bible that Christ was ever put out of the church but the leodan age she's in the worst age she's the rottenest she'll ever was said I said as a queen have need of nothing and don't know that you're naked miserable blind pure and poor and don't know it yes said I counsel thee to come by Isa from me that I might open your eyes now notice quickly paragraph 170 now she's in that stage beyond the shadow of a doubt we're in the lady oan Church age now her messenger is Promised in Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4 four in the church world today today there is two systems working this is what I wanted to get to right here listen real close now I want to see if you're going to say Amen on this this there's two systems working in the church world today I'm going to get this off my shoulder then I have it over with we all know that that's the word of God and the denominational system there is the two systems at work just as they was with Jacob and Esau one after the spirit the other one after the flesh what is it Esau and Jacob was fighting in the womb of the mother even to the time they were born and so is the denominational and the word fighting one against the other they have been since Luther's first brought the First Reformation I hope that's simple enough that you can understand it that's what we're working against that's going to be in any any meeting any gathered ministers meeting church meeting group meeting you're working against two system there's denominational system it's a spirit that wants to get on me it wants to get on you and then there is the word of God that's what's working what does the denominational system says was the denominational system is like this let's clean up this our church services they come here we want to be able to make sure we leave out of here by 12 we get in by 10: we get out of here by 12 on the dot every Sunday and we can plan you know time with this and time with that in between the services keep it nice and clean those that want to get born again just have them sign this little thing over here this little ticket or raise your hand you're born again you agree what you just heard yes I agree how much tithing you got oh you got some money okay make sure you pay that and keep coming at you on the back nice person we see you on Sunday see you on Wednesday come we didn't see you on Church come on you come and sit on the Pew long as you come coming to church sitting on a Pew yes but see that ain't the word of God that ain't the word of God the word of God ain't work I mean it's glad to be sitting on a Pew but have you been born again you still got that temper you still mean you're still ungrateful you still need the the the patience you need those vert birth in you the word of God will call you out and I'm so glad that it does that's what the word will do the denominational system a group of men coming together say he's good she's good don't bother them don't preach on them that's so and so's daughter that's the deacons that's the elders this and that don't preach on them because they're very important Believers don't say that that ain't the word of God no no that's something else not John the Baptist what did you go out to see when you see went to see John somebody they agree with the wind agree see how things are going let's see who what are the other churches doing huh on this subject how should we handle this quote you know what are the other churches well I don't know what the other churches are doing but the Believers are saying Amen to all of the word is that right am those are the two systems that work and a denominational Spirit let's not leave it out there this group that denominational Spirit wants to get on all of us and it's the word that birs us out of that it always be a conflict God bless you God bless you so much let us pray Lord Jesus thank you for your word this morning thank you for the patience of your people we pray Lord that even we would grow thereby that we won't be unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ that there is growth taking place in our life that even preachers and pastors and ministers and deacons and Elders are still growing oh God I pray that this great
