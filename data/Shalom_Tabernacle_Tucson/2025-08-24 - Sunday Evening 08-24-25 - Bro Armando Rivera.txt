Heavenly Father, Lord, we're coming Lord to the place where all our prayers can be answered, Father, in the unity of the spirit, Lord, in faith believing, knowing, Father, that the blood of Jesus can cover everything that is not pleasing or sinful in your sight, Father. Lord, we pray that you draw us tonight, Lord. That your presence would be felt among us, Father. that you'd have your way in everything that would be done in this service. Lord, for Bobby Wartz, we pray that your hand would be upon him, Father, Lord, and the doctors and the nurses and the help, Lord, that you'd guide him through these things and bring them forth whole, Father, as a testimony of your glory and grace. And Mike WZ also, Father, and for Clarissa, Father, Lord, it's just a small thing for you to do anything, Lord. We pray that fever would break, Lord, after it's done its job in the body, Lord, and she'd be well in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, for our service tonight, Lord, we pray for Brother Armando that you'd just anoint him once again, Father. Lord, have them to say the things that need to be said. We praise you for We thank you, Lord, for Brother Joseph and what was brought this morning, Lord. We're just so blessed to hear the things we hear, Lord. for the preachers that come through. And Father, we pray, Lord, that not one ounce of extra faith would ever leave us, but you'd build us up in the Holy Ghost, Father, and your your precious faith, Lord. Father, we pray, Lord, that you just press all the workers, the musicians, everyone, Father, that has put forth a sacrifice this day. Keep us together, Lord. for the November meetings. We pray that you'd have your way, Lord, and everything that's said and done and all the sisters and all the work that they do.

I feel like pressing my way [Applause] [Music] every hand [Music] life pressing my way. Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord tonight. Amen. God bless each of you richly. Um, how many enjoyed the service this morning? It was a real blessing and we thank the Lord for our brother Joseph. We certainly enjoyed that. God bless him and his travels back home. Back home. Also, um, I misqued those dates in November. They're the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, and um not the 13th. And so that's that veterans just before the Veterans Day weekend. We want to be in prayer for that. Amen. And brother Kim was streaming the service and he caught it and I said, "Well, thank the Lord somebody's listening to the dates." Praise the Lord. So, um um we want to be in prayer for those meetings. And tonight, we have a very special friend to me and to the ministry, uh brother Armando Rivera. And he's from El Salvador, but he's habit habiting habitating in Phoenix and he's pastoring there for a number of years. How many ever been to his church here? Praise be. It's a lively group. Very lovely. Lovely. Easy to worship, easy to preach in. And in his church, the way the Lord blessed them in their neighborhood, they purchased that church. And then the next alley behind them, there's a home that was purchased and made into a restaurant. They call it the Granero, the greenery. And it's for believers. So after the service, Friday nights typically you can go there and it's a full menu. Salmon, steak, hamburgers, takitos. It's a real full-blown. It's just believers and they'll serve you. You've been there, Will. You never been. This is a place to be. And it's easy. Yes. And and they make you feel at home and &gt;&gt; very welcome. And so the Lord put that on their heart because they would after service go to the restaurants and then be parted and you got to deal with the music and the brother that runs it is a bonafide chef. They do a very good job. It's a sight to see and they make you feel at home and welcome there. So maybe I prop I haven't properly introduced you to our brother Armando. We know him well but you got to go to his church. She has services Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. And this Wednesday night, Friday night, and Sunday service crowd is about the same. &gt;&gt; They're all there. Right, Brother Joseph? &gt;&gt; Brother Joseph said, "I was surprised these people come to church during the week." Yeah. So lovely congregation. They love us. They love me. They love our our work. Brother Armando loves our group here. He prays for us. &gt;&gt; And we're one and the same. And so it's a real privilege to have him with us and he's going to take brother back to the airport tomorrow. He's going to take him tonight then to the airport tomorrow. So it worked out. I said, "Well, brother Armando, if you're coming, why don't you speak for us?" Some of his families here with us. That's his dear wife there. God bless you, sister Dola Vendiga. And so without further ado, we'll stand to our feet and we're going to invite our precious brother Armando to take the pull pit and let's sing that hymn. Amazing grace. Amazing [Music] grace, how sweet the sound that sent [Music] like me. [Music] I was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see. Let's bow our heads as they play that softly. Heavenly Father, we come here tonight, Lord, to honor the great resurrection day you've given to us, Lord. Another day of life. And without you, Lord, we could do nothing. So Lord, we simply just bring our little life to you, &gt;&gt; asking you to pour in us the things that we need to be ready for the rapture and the great body change, the resurrection, the coming of the Lord. I pray, oh God, something to be said to stir our souls and to help us to grow in your grace and your mercy. Bless brother Armando, Lauren, and the ministry here tonight. bless your people. Commit this service into your hands. In Jesus name we pray and we love you. Amen. Everyone said amen. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise as our brother comes. Amen. Sor [Music] Al. [Music] Amen. Amazing [Music] grace. How sweet the thy sound. Hallelujah. I say a rest like me. I once was lost and now I am blind. But now I see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. to see you and uh see this beautiful church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh these people and uh I'm I'm glad to be with you and you may take your seats. Make yourself comfortable. And I'm gonna be I'm gonna be uh speaking for the next 30 minutes and uh the Lord will in 30 45 something like that. and uh uh my faithful companion, my wife is with me &gt;&gt; and I tell her that I'm glad that we getting all together, you know, and uh understanding how times work on humanity.

I think you have a wonderful pastor. great men of God. Amen. And uh his family, &gt;&gt; God bless them. Amen. And uh and the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and I I I want to say to the to the veterans, to those who have walked in this message for so many years, h it helps me a lot to see you be faithful. uh we find a lot of people kind of you know getting slow or something but it's so wonderful to see those warriors &gt;&gt; for for many years. Amen. They're there standing. You are an inspiration to the new generation. And I can say that for me, you you are an inspiration to me. When sometimes I feel tired, I'm like, "No, no, no, no. It's not possible. There there's my brother over there, my sister over there. This cannot be happening to me. I got to keep going. I got to go." Amen. So, I'm I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. And uh so uh we're going to read the word and uh we're going to be reading in Acts 2029. I wrote it in a Spanish if you stand up for to honor the word of God. Amen. and uh Acts 2029. &gt;&gt; Amen. For I know this, that after my depart departing shall grievous wolves enter among you, not sparing the flock. &gt;&gt; Also your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them. Therefore, watch and remember that by the space of three years at cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh after that we're going to be reading another scripture. But let us pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you tonight for the opportunity that we have to come into your house, Lord. And we have been taught that this is the place where we come and be in your presence also. Lord, we are taught that this is your house. &gt;&gt; This is the place where we come and worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So help us to do that. Help us to surrender ourselves to you, Father. And we thank you for the mercies and how you have been good to us. All the blessings that we have received. And father when we when you look for us, Father, we did not know and we came to you Lord with so many needs and you supplied all of that, Father. &gt;&gt; Because no man come and look for you. But father, there is a time where we tested how good you are. &gt;&gt; And now Lord, we look for you. We seek you, Father, because now we understand that your love, Father, is infinite. That you're faithful, Father. Thank you, Lord, for that. And so today, Lord, we give you thanks for everything. and we're asking for your blessings in our lives in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I I wrote uh the scripture Acts 20:29, but I want to read the scripture where he says that this church has been bought with the blood. Amen. Unless I I have the I have the wrong. Amen. Amen. So Amen. So that scripture I want to read. Technology sometimes is difficult for me. Amen. Amen. Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood. Amen. Amen. Uh this is this is the the thing about uh what is in my heart and uh I believe that we we have been brought from a life of sadness, destruction, uh things that are not right. And we we were brought to the gospel and uh through the years I I have understood that the gospel that has been given to us is not any other gospel but the gospel of Jesus Christ. And when I say we were brought to this gospel, it doesn't mean that there are other gospels. &gt;&gt; There is just one. &gt;&gt; But there are so many things around it that people call gospel when there when it is not a gospel. The the gospel is the good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are we are here to receive good news &gt;&gt; and to and to tell people that there are good news. Amen. Now we know that there are promises that there are there there are things that were promised to us that the Lord was going to do great things in our lives and that there is a process that we have to go through with this and and one of them is that he he was going to forgive our sins &gt;&gt; that he was going to cleanse us &gt;&gt; and then he was going to give us the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then after he has given us the Holy Ghost, what is next? You know, so I want to read this. Brother Brennan says, I I I did not write uh it did not print it the the the message, but then brother Brennan says, "Then our headship is a kingdom. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is within you." said the Bible, &gt;&gt; Jesus, the kingdom. We are not a denomination. &gt;&gt; We belong to a kingdom. &gt;&gt; And the kingdom is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Made spirit and life in our own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're not just a a bunch of people just gather, you know, like without any structure. It's not just a bunch of people just going by the wind or going here and there. No, we this this is a kingdom &gt;&gt; and and and and and we have to recognize that that we are part of this kingdom that that we we have power &gt;&gt; with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that this is this is the church of the living God. We what what is there? What what do we wait? &gt;&gt; What what what more is there &gt;&gt; as far as this human life goes? You know that there is nothing there there are things said about this humanity that I'm not going to change. &gt;&gt; It's going to be that way. &gt;&gt; I was young and I'm getting old. And I ask God to give me strength, you know, but I know that that there is an appointment &gt;&gt; for this body. &gt;&gt; And I have I I'm not I'm not overwhelmed by that. &gt;&gt; I'm not like what is happening to me? No, it's already written. &gt;&gt; It's it's not like something surprising me. &gt;&gt; No, it's there. And because I am a Christian, it doesn't mean that it's not going to happen to me. &gt;&gt; But sometimes, you know, it seems to me that we put attention to this human affairs &gt;&gt; and it's like it blinds us &gt;&gt; to enjoy the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am happy, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; I am happy to be in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; I am happy that the Lord called me to be in this kingdom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To be now, not not tomorrow, not in 10 years, not in five years, right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know the is it's real. &gt;&gt; Uh it's now that we have power. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says everything that was God was poor &gt;&gt; in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And all that was in Jesus &gt;&gt; was poor where in the church. &gt;&gt; So, we're not just anything. &gt;&gt; We're not just a group of people, you know, that come over here and just No, we have a shout &gt;&gt; of victory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I have many things to be happy about. I have many things in this kingdom that I am happy about, you know, and and and and and we have to realize that this is it. Now, if you're going to get married, this is it. You you have to know that you have you have a kingdom and there is a king and you therefore are a king yourself. &gt;&gt; He made us kings and priests. &gt;&gt; Made us &gt;&gt; no will make us. &gt;&gt; We are right now. If somebody if I do not know who I am or you know or or I have lost you know the sense of of who I am and somebody comes oh brother Armando do you know who you are. So well I just know I am somebody from El Salvador. No, no, no. Wait. Do you know that that last name Rivera that there was a king in Spain, his land, his last name was Rivera? &gt;&gt; And and you should go and trace the last name. &gt;&gt; And if I trace and that person says, you know what, you don't have to go into that trouble. I already did it for you. and and you are in that bloodline. &gt;&gt; I'll be like really where is my my part my inheritance? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we we we are in the bloodline of no humanity &gt;&gt; but we are in the bloodline of the King of Kings. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But we have to enjoy and realize it &gt;&gt; that when somebody ask who are you? &gt;&gt; I am a Christian. &gt;&gt; You know brothers and sisters I I I uh there is a brother uh that came from the assemblies of God. He was there for 14 12 years ministering and so he came and to be a minister and he came to our church. I baptized him and everything and now you know the his whole setup has been changed. &gt;&gt; You know the the wife is long long skirts everything has changed &gt;&gt; and now he has uh two daughters. One is a uh 16 to be 17 and the other one is like 14 15 and they they the long skirts and they were worried about how are they going to do in a school. &gt;&gt; They what what are we going to do there? &gt;&gt; I said that's where you're going to that's where you're going to show you loyalty. &gt;&gt; You're going to be tested now, &gt;&gt; you know. And so the other day uh the brother preached and when he was preaching you know you know when you are preaching you know there are things that come out you know that's why this internet are not so much into that because of you know there are things that people don't understand why you are saying it and they are not in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; So I invite all my brothers that can come to church to come to church. If you cannot come, that's good. It's okay. I I guess. But if you can come, the scripture says, "Let us go into the house of the Lord." &gt;&gt; So the brother was speaking and he said uh I think that one of the daughters went to him and and and and said, "Dad, they are telling us why do you dress like that? Why do you dress like that? &gt;&gt; And then the that dad, you know, these are people that don't know, you know, they don't they don't know much theology and teaching and but but they believe, you know, what they are taught in the Bible as far as they know it. &gt;&gt; And then he told the daughter, well, this is what you got to answer. I dress like this because I am of Christ. Why do you dress like that? Cuz I belong to Christ. &gt;&gt; There's no more explanation. There's no more I am of Christ. Simple. &gt;&gt; Simple but truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and I added a little bit in there and I said, "Then you tell that person, I I dress like this because I belong to Christ." To whom do you belong? &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful thing to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We I enjoy this. &gt;&gt; This is is wonderful. If I get sick, I pray. If disappointment comes, I said, "Lord, I got to get out of this. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know what depression. I don't know the oppression. I don't know any of those things. I don't study them. I don't know what they are. I just know that there are things and I'm like, could it be that I am depressed today? Could it be that thing? You know, I hear so much about it. And I'm like, you know what? Get out of here. You don't belong with me. I I I is so happy. I'm so glad my king came &gt;&gt; and gave me salvation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, and I, you know, my church, I tell the the my people, you either enjoy it now or what are we doing here? &gt;&gt; This is the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we come here to worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm watching the clock. Amen. So, this is it. We we were, you know, we we have to enjoy this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's good. &gt;&gt; He gave us the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And what else do we need with his power? &gt;&gt; Amen. The counselor, the real counselor, not a psychologist, but a a real counselor. Amen. So the scripture is telling us that this church was bought by his own blood. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennan tells us we are not bought by anything but the blood of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is a great price, brothers and sisters, that was paid for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. The blood of God, &gt;&gt; cleansed you, forgave you, has made you whole, &gt;&gt; has given you direction, has given us purpose to live. &gt;&gt; We know what's coming. &gt;&gt; We know what is going on. We know that the changing the changing of this body is coming up. &gt;&gt; But in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy what I have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So loyal says some of the definitions is to be reliable is to be always true. That's to be loyal. And in in in humanity we appreciate as humans loyalty. Everyone wants somebody loyal. &gt;&gt; Amen. But let's besides the words and definitions, let us see some examples of what it is to be loyal. an exposition of the church edges church Pergamus the messenger in that area right there. Brother Brennan says just to know about Martin and his mighty ministry might make one think that the persecution of the saints had evaded. Not so. They were still being destroyed by the devil through the instrumentality of the wicked. They were burned at the stake. They were nailed to the logs face down and wild dogs were turned loose upon them so that the dogs will tear away the flesh and bowels, leaving the victims to die in terrible torture. Babes were ripped from expectant mothers and thrown to the hogs. Women Women's breasts were cut away and they were forced to stand erect while each heart throw poured pour out the blood until they crumble in death. And the tragedy was even greater to think about when one realizes that this was not solely to the to the the work of the heathen. But many times it was caused by so-called Christians who felt that they did God a favor and exterminating these loyal soldiers. What is loyalty? Is to maintain to keep &gt;&gt; my position, &gt;&gt; my stand &gt;&gt; until death. &gt;&gt; That's one definition to be loyal. &gt;&gt; Amen. is to go all the way down. &gt;&gt; I'm down for it &gt;&gt; and not by force but because there is something in the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I think it was Polycarp that they captured him and he was taken to the stake in the fire and he said, "Don't tie me down. &gt;&gt; You don't need to tie me down." &gt;&gt; I'm loyal. I know what it is to be loyal. &gt;&gt; And he was there. He they they did to him evil but he did not run. &gt;&gt; He kept his loyalty to his calling. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, loyalty to be loyal. The scripture says that in the last days, Paul wrote to Timothy, there will be people that are going to be disloyal. &gt;&gt; And we are living those things today. We see them today, brothers and sisters. people who run away from the faith, people who live, you know, the standards, people who and the scripture says that they that they will go away. That's that's a prophecy and it has to be fulfilled. So we don't have to be worried about that. It's it's we ourselves. I Lord, I want to be loyal to you, Father. Amen. So that's one definition of being loyal to death. What if we take that to the family, to the wife and the husband? What if we take those things to that level? &gt;&gt; We're supposed to be loyal to one another &gt;&gt; no matter the temptation. But brother that that you cannot do by yourself. &gt;&gt; There has to be a power that come to you. &gt;&gt; So that's that's that's big to be loyal like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But let me read about other loyalty. And so the full gospel business man has been a oasis. The rapture message the rapture yuma Arizona paragraph 24. And so the full gospel businessman has been a oasis where we can come together. No churches no churches is sponsoring it. They all together the men out of the churches and we come together in fellowship across the world around everywhere. I've helped establish many many many chapter throughout the entire world of the full gospel businessman. I'm thankful for that opportunity that was given me in there. This businessman will sponsor it. Then all the churches they want to come anyhow. But then I don't want to never try to pull somebody from their church. Just stay right in your church &gt;&gt; and scared out the light. Amen. Be a real Christian. Your pastor will appreciate you. &gt;&gt; A real loyal, genuine saint. Any man that believes in God will appreciate a person like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are called to be faithful. You might well well no brother Amando be careful. How are you understanding that? &gt;&gt; I I am understanding that there is a a flock &gt;&gt; and there is a pastor. &gt;&gt; Tucson is Tucson. Phoenix is Phoenix. &gt;&gt; But this is talking about a flag &gt;&gt; and a pastor. And if there is a loyal believer, &gt;&gt; not in Tucson, but in that church, &gt;&gt; and what it is to be loyal to give my life. &gt;&gt; So let let's let's uh dwell a little bit into that. Where are you going? Well, I'm I'm going to brother Thomas church. But brother, have you heard what happened in there? You know, have you don't know? Wow. Keep keep talking to me. Loyalty. &gt;&gt; A person who is loyal says, "I don't care." &gt;&gt; Cuz loyalty will take you to what? To death. cuz you are loyal to that pastor. Brother Joseph, there have been many ministers who has gone to my church and they say, "How did you do this? How how how did this happen?" I'm like I read the message &gt;&gt; and I tell them what the message says. &gt;&gt; If I am going to preach, I'm not going to come here brother with with a spirit of brothers and sisters. Let us be loyal. Loyalty means I can't &gt;&gt; you know once I get out of this place I'm tired. I'm done. I gave everything to my God. &gt;&gt; I don't have energy because I left all my energy right here. &gt;&gt; And I believe that the congregation should do the same. &gt;&gt; Cuz the reason that we are here is for him, the Christ, the Lord, the one who saved you and saved me. &gt;&gt; Loyalty. Amen. But I'm going to read another. Are you seeing what loyalty? &gt;&gt; Have you seen a lot of loyalty like this in in churches? Have you seen a lot? And I use the term lot because I know there ain't. There are a few brothers and sisters and I think I'm looking at them today. Brother Bennon says in the message in the winds of a snow white dove paragraph 245, Sister Palmer, our sister, Sister Palmer, her husband is a very dear friend of mine, a minister from Georgia or Alabama, Georgia. And she was coming up to the tabernacle. They drive when I'm preaching up at the at the tabernacle. 1500 miles. Wow. 1,500 miles to hear one service. Brother Palmer lost control of his car or the boy one when they was turning a corner and they had a wreck. She's got an effect of it. Let's pray. Dear God, deliver this December servant of yours, his little wife, loyal. &gt;&gt; Loyal, true. But what makes it loyal? Driving 15 miles. &gt;&gt; That makes it loyal, brothers and sisters. Loyal is not just a term. It's not just an adjective. Loyal is a description &gt;&gt; of the behavior of a person. &gt;&gt; Brother, he come from Sierra Vista. He is a loyal brother. &gt;&gt; The brother that lives around the corner didn't come today. He's not loyal. loyal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm I'm brothers and sisters, I I want to be a loyal believer. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to shock you. I want to be loyal to the church. Perhaps some of the people seeing in the internet are like loyal to the church &gt;&gt; only if I read it from brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Then let's read it. &gt;&gt; And next time I come, I want those brothers in here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are we happy? &gt;&gt; Message the restoration of the bright tree. Paragraph 43. I'm going to wait till it's there so that everybody reads it. When I read that, brothers, I was like, is this real, brother? Amen. It is is it is it that message the restoration of the bright tree? Paragraph 43. Brother Israel, this is what I have. I I don't I don't know. &gt;&gt; Do you trust me that I am a loyal servant? &gt;&gt; Many times I might not know how to pronounce some words brothers but he understands. Now, brother Brennan says paragraph for 43 as I said and if someone of them are change seats every once in a while somebody sit down and the others get up and wait a little while and I will be just as brief as I can. Now remember, pray for me. Now remember, pray for me and just be loyal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To the church. &gt;&gt; Be loyal to Shalom Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; You have it right there. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the prophet There is no misinterpretation. &gt;&gt; Stay right here. &gt;&gt; Being royal mean stay right here. &gt;&gt; No, I have this thing going. I have that going. I taught my church and I told them the believers I said don't you get a job that is gonna take you away from coming to church. &gt;&gt; There was a brother for three months he was not working three months and the devil came to him to offer him a job and he said where are you from? He said from Honduras. And the and the person said the devil in that person said you know I heard who endurance are good you know good boxers they they are mean people and I need one like you was the devil and he said what is the job? Well, the job is over there where I sell liquor and and I stay all night long. So, there are some fights in there and I need you over there. The brother said, "No." &gt;&gt; I've been for months not working, but the Lord will provide. &gt;&gt; Can you give the Lord a hand of praise, brothers and sisters? Believe [Applause] God is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Stay right here to the church with That means not just the church with brother Neville. &gt;&gt; In other words, with the pastor. &gt;&gt; Be loyal. What is to be loyal? To give your life. That's a definition. to be a loyal person. I will come from I know I I'll go miles. I'll go I'll take the distance. I'll go through struggles. I go through problems. But I'll be loyal. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do we love the Lord? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. I am about 40 minutes. God bless you. Do we know what the first seal is? Yes. Is the antichrist dressed as something innocent. &gt;&gt; What is the second seat? We know it. But do we know to be loyal to the church? Do we know what this is? This is where God dwells. That's what brother Brennan says. And brother Brennan says, "Lord, we thank you for this place." Talking about Brandon Tabernacle. He said, "Here, Lord, you have changed souls. You have saved men. You have taken away from us sicknesses. You have restored our life. You have given us life &gt;&gt; here Lord. &gt;&gt; If for somebody else this isn't sacred for the believer. &gt;&gt; It's sacred. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If somebody just look at it like it's a building that's on them. But I'm me. The prophet is calling me to be loyal &gt;&gt; to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you loyal to Christ? &gt;&gt; Now bring it down a little bit. Be loy be loyal to where he has poured out everything. He is &gt;&gt; the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you brothers and sisters. It's is I'm delightful to to to speak to you, but I know it's getting it's getting late. Amen. And some of us have to go to work on on uh on Monday. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you take something from from here tonight, remember we got to be loyal &gt;&gt; to the church. &gt;&gt; That might be strange to some believers. They did that. That's why they left. That's why they are over there in in in Lawn Rangers somewhere. They they do not know. Brother Brandon said these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't want to I don't want to uh finish without reading one more code. Amen. But you know, brothers and sisters, I I believe that the Holy Spirit wants to live in us. I believe that he wants to be worshiped. I believe that he wants to do for us more than we know about. I'm not going to read that quote. I'm going to read other code. But but look at this. Brother Brennan says before the millennium happened where the bride is going to rule and reign, he said there has to be a cleanup. And every time, Brother Brennan says every time that the Holy Spirit wants to dwell, there has to be a cleanup. Amen. And God takes us to through that process until the vessel is clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want the Holy Spirit in our church. &gt;&gt; Do you want it in the church? &gt;&gt; But what needs to happen? Clean up. The young people need the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; It's happiness. You wake up in the morning, you're not asking this is life. Eat, sleep, get up. Eat, sleep, get up. This is life. When you have the Holy Spirit, you have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Life is not boring. You see the enemy trying to capture you, attack you when you have the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But before the Holy Spirit come, there needs to be a clean up. &gt;&gt; Before the vessel is is full, we have to clean it. In Spanish, there is a word. It's almost cleaning, but it's not real cleaning. And the girls when they are learning, you know, the the chores at home, you know, they they start with that, you know, the mom says, "Go wash the dishes." And then the mom goes, "No, this is this is not washed. And the mom takes the, you know, the the mom takes the glass or or the cup or the plane and says there this this oil here. No, you just it stays all in how you just you just pass it through the water. No, you need to watch it. &gt;&gt; And then the man says, "Let me see. Let me show you how you watch it." gets a a a masterful hand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And really watch the cup. &gt;&gt; You know the stain, the smell, the oil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For what? What is he going to be watched for? Because it's going to be used. I am sure as human beings which we have our normal minds if they put two glasses of full of water over here and one has like brown something over there and one here if you bring it over here I'll be like what are you trying you trying to kill me or something you you're going to say brother Amando take water which one do you choose &gt;&gt; of course I'm going to choose the clean one And this is a pure message. &gt;&gt; This is not a denomination. &gt;&gt; This is not something mingle with the world. &gt;&gt; This is a message that came from heaven. &gt;&gt; This is the spirit of God before the throne. Oh hallelujah. Who brought us this word, brothers and sisters. It's clean and before the Holy Spirit come the vessel has to be clean and you understand what cleaning means. Amen. Hallelujah. Last time I preach here, I said when you worship, great things happen. There is something that happens when you worship. You surrender yourself. You you you you get out of your formality. You get out of your own. You said, "Oh, God, I love you, Lord. I'm here for you, Father. I'm going to worship you. I'm going to say how great you are. I'm going to exalt your name. Oh, I'm going to lift you up. Oh, God. You You're out. You're out of yourself. Something is going to happen. in the message perseverant. He brother Brandon preached in so many places but I got this this here but that didn't stop her a bit church letter or nothing else didn't stop her why she have heard faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God. God is good brothers. Amen. &gt;&gt; She was perseverant. She crowded right on through every barrier. Now she arrived at Jesus. Now she thought, "It's all over now." That's the way some people think when they get the Holy Ghost. It's all over. It's just beginning. &gt;&gt; The journey has started. But now you're not alone. You got the kingdom. Hallelujah. You got the power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's when you need to be perseverant. &gt;&gt; When you arrive, when she arrived at Jesus, Jesus said, "Give her Jesus said, "Give her a real heart shaking." I believe he knew she was coming. So when she arrived, he turned around to her and let her know that he wasn't sent to her race. Oh my, what a let down that would have been. Oh, but what did he do? That didn't stop her a bit. Not at all. Still, she called him son of David. Curse the gentile has no hold on Christ by the name of son of David. &gt;&gt; No. No. See, the son of David was under the kingship and Christ is the king of the Jews. But to the church, he's not the king. He is the Lord. Amen. He's the husband as Sarah called Abraham her lord. He's lord of the church but king of the Jewish race. And so when she worshiped him and said, "Lord, help me." What did she do? Worshiped. worshiped and said, "Lord, help me. Precious Lord, precious King, holy man of God. You are great. You are my way out. &gt;&gt; Please help me." Amen. &gt;&gt; One thing is to worship and another thing is Lord help me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord help me. Jesus said but you know it's not me for me to take the children's bread and cast it to you dogs. Oh my. If that would have been a modern Pentecostal she have turned that little nose up and said I'll never go to a meeting like that again. Why? They don't have the hope that she had. Hallelujah. That's right. She had the hope. She have heard and faith have got it. She had a reason. She had a need and she she just wasn't going to turn loose. That's right. I like that. Yes, sir. Still, she held on. Although she was called a dog in a race that was lower than dogs said, "I'm not sent to your race." But remember, she is an atmosphere of worship. &gt;&gt; She's hearing this, but she is in in a state of worship. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm only sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And she said, "Lord, help me." And he said, "It's not me for me to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs." Oh my. She wasn't a hobbit plant to have to be baby. No, no, no, no. She wasn't a hobbit plant. Had to be baited. She wasn't a mother hybrid. So-called believer of the crop today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She got a hold of something. &gt;&gt; Now, well, I am Methodist. I was reading, we were listening to the message Hebrews and brother Brennan says, "You brothers and sisters, you men and women there's rises a little problem in the church and the first thing you do is is run away." &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan say you stay there. &gt;&gt; Be loyal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm Methodist and I don't have to take that. Bless God, I belong to the assemblies. I belong to the church of God. I don't have to take that. No, no, no, no. That's a hybrid. That's a hybrid type. You are bred into some organization, but a true, but a real true through through bread Christian is born of the word of God and holds on no matter what takes place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not for me to give you the bread of the children, your dogs, but she was worshiping. And what did she answer? How did that come about? There was wisdom because the Holy Spirit is wisdom, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And she said, "But sir, the dogs from the crumbs that comes that fall from the table." Oh woman, great is your faith. Hallelujah. But what was she doing? She was worshiping. She approached it worshiping. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord, brothers and sisters. God bless you. Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Bernan, questions and answers set. Now wait, let me stop there just a minute. Now that's what I am trying to tell you people. Brother Neville believes the same message that I believe. Brother Cops, brother Biller, brother Rattle, all these brothers around here believe the same message that I believe. They preach it same as I do. And if you want to really want to, you are going to move out or you're going to retire or something another and want to come for the word. Want to come for what? The word. &gt;&gt; Come here. You know, I hear people in the message, you need to go to church. That's a that's a blanket statement. You need to go to church. But what church come to my church? We need you or no? &gt;&gt; We got to be loyal. Brother says, "Come here, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He said it." Do you believe the message &gt;&gt; or this is shaking you a little bit? &gt;&gt; What is brother What is Brother Armando pointing to? What is he doing? Brother, I'm telling you, we need to realize who we are and what we are. We are not just a bunch of people going here and there. We have a kingdom. &gt;&gt; We have a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a flock. We have a pastor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have responsibilities and we fulfill our responsibilities. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a lot to say about that, but I'll stop. And want to come for the word, come here. Come to the tabernacle. That's where you hear it. Come to Shalom Tabernacle. Here is where you're going to hear the word. &gt;&gt; There you're going to be saved. Hallelujah. He's good. [Music] May more [Music] [Music] I love him. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just Oh yes.

His clothes coming. &gt;&gt; And I want to say, Lord, your church is ready. &gt;&gt; You say, "But brother Amando, who are you?" I'm talking about that church of the living God. &gt;&gt; If he's coming and we all confess that he's coming. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then where is the church? It's here. &gt;&gt; The church is here. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say praise the Lord? You believe that's the word of the Lord. I believe it with all my heart.
