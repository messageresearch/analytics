are possible [Music] only believe only be only be all things are possible only be you may be seated brother br the faithful witness the Bible calls it a little later faithful witness is the prophet when he's on Earth he was a prophet the word faithful witness the Bible calls him a little later faithful witness is the prophet he was reations 153 and when he's priest now and when he comes he'll be king if you'll get over read Revelations 153 you can see in Revelations 153 let's turn over here and see what if he's going to be king if he is King when he come now we're going to and Revelations the 15th chapter and the L the third verse and they sang a song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of of the messah which was a prophet what was he on Earth Prophet how did the people know he was a prophet he done the sign of the Messiah which was a [Music] prophet how did they miss him because they were looking for something else and he' done the sign of the Messiah and they wouldn't hear it he was a prophet Moses said the Lord your God raise up a prophet like me they'll come to pass if they not hear this Prophet they'll be cut off amongst the people he was was a prophet on earth now because he was what the faithful witness of God's word came out he was God's word made manifest St John the first chapter in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God the word and the Word was made flesh and God Among Us he was a true and faithful witness to God's Eternal Word he was the word and being the word he was a prophet for the word of God spoke to him only the thing I could do nothing Within Myself of what the father CHS me to do not me that doth the works but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works I am my father are one my father me Jesus the man the Tabernacle compound God got many titles Jehovah Jehovah JY RI Manasses oh many got seven compound Redemptive names got many titles R and Sh Valley Morning Star father son Holy Ghost all that but he's got one human name God only had one name and that was the Lord Jesus Christ when he was born Christ the lord eight days later the Holy Spirit called his name Jesus his mother had him circumcised and called him Jesus he was born to Christ like I was born to brandom I was a brandom when was born and give the name of William amen and he was born Christ the Savior and when he was 8 days old he was given the name of Jesus and he was The Lord Of Glory made manifest so he is the Lord Jesus Christ the god of Glory made manifest Among Us amen well there he is on Earth he was a prophet and Glory he's a priest coming he's the king oh I like that Prophet faithful witness of the word priest with his own blood before god king king of saints not king of the world he's king of saints we have Earthly Kings or than people but we have a king too and a kingdom that's the reason we act different like I said not long ago about my wife was going to the store up here and we seen a miracle almost in summertime a woman had on her dress I said that's a strange thing I said if I had my camera i' take the lady's picture see because we had first woman we s with a skirt on you know dressed like a lady ought to be all of she said well why is it bill that our people uh dress we're we're commanded I said it's not our people it's God's people God's people requires Holiness that's right said well don't they go to church I said there's a lady right there sings in a choir a certain church here well then why that I said because she isn't taught any different that's right exactly right that's that church call caral we'll get into this week Church Spiritual Church carnal they're all drifting right back to the manami churches the Bible said in Revelation 17 they would do it they're returning back right now all of them acting like it organizing well we are certain we organize we're this and we're that it wasn't so at the beginning taking all the power out of the church and put it on a bishop or a pope God's in his church among these people manifes himself through the land and everywhere Hallelujah now but in this day she said well aren't we Americans I said no we live here but we're not Americans we are Christians our kingdom is of above if our lives come from up there then we act like that because we come our life is from a holy place it looks different it dresses different the women up there has long hair and they don't wear manicure on their face and they don't wear shorts they they wear skirts and long robes and dresses and they have long hair and things so the the nature of it from up there reflects back on us the man don't smoke shoe lie steel they come their spirits come from a holy place makes them act holy recognize one another as brothers that's it we have a kingdom and we have a king and he is the king of Saints and the word Saint come from the word of the Sanctified ones then when a person is Sanctified Christ the holy spirit moves into the heart and becomes king over that amen oh my go home hallelujah oh in the Sanctified desel of God Christ the King the Holy Ghost moves in and a king has his domain Hallelujah hey man if your whole being is ruled by the king of saints a kingdom than every Kingdom on Earth will be shook tore down by atomic power but the Bible says we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved hallelujah king of saints thank you Lord I want you to notice the symbols of Christ also in the Bible and here on Earth on the earth he was a prophet you believe that a prophet is the word we know that the word Prophet means a Divine interpreter of the word the Divine word is wrote and the prophet has the Divine spirit of God within him and you know the prophet in the Old Testament is called God how many knew that Jesus said if they call them Gods is it written your law they are you are Gods amen and if they call them Gods who the word of God came to the prophet how will you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God because he was called God because he packed within in the word of God thus sayith the Lord hallelujah therefore the word Prophet means a his is interpretation isn't to be mingled with see if the God he says that there be one among you who spiritual a prophet our the Lord will speak to him what he says comes to pass and hear him because I'm with him but if it doesn't come to pass then don't hear him I haven't se him that's the way you know it and then you see the Divine interpretation of the word has to coincides with this last Revelation to the church he's God the almighty on Earth he was a prophet which is the eagle how many know that the prophet is considered an eagle amen a eagle is the strongest bird we got most powerful some of their wings stretch 14 feet from tip to tip he can take and fly so high that if any other bird try to follow him he'd disintegrate feathers would fall out of him and he come apart because why he's built special and what good does it do him to get up that high if he can't see what he's doing when he's up there talk about a Hawkeye you see Eagle Eye a hul can might see a chicken that's right that's watch matter some of these hwks today but I tell you eagle goes if a Hulk tried to follow him he'd die he suffocates he can't get into those spheres that the eagle does and then he's got an eye that he can see so far he's got up there so that's the reason God called His prophets Eagles he gets up there and he's the eagle he can see well and Christ on Earth was an eagle when he died he was a priest so that made him a lamb is that right and when he comes again he's King so you'll be a line line of the tri of Judah amen he is a eagle a lamb and a lion amen Father Son and Holy Ghost Prophet priest and King he that was which is and shall come the Almighty Alpha and Omega from the beginning to the end the Eternal God I want to ask you some of you precious Catholic people who call that the Eternal sunship of God God Eternal sunship of Jesus Christ with God how can you say such a word I'm a dummy with a seventh grade education but I know better than that the word son has to have a beginning so how can he be Eternal and be a [Applause] son eternity has no beginning or end so it can't be a son and eternal son and then have a beginning because there is no such a thing as an eternal son a son had a beginning so he can't be Eternal amen you see he is the Eternal God not the Eternal son Glory Almighty Jehovah Jehovah RI made manifest in flesh in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily and on the day of Pentecost when that Pillar of Fire came down over the people did you notice it separated itself and tongues of fire set upon each one of them fire like tongues setting on each one of what was God doing separating himself into the church among each one giv the women the man and all of parts of his spirit dividing himself among his church how can a man come along and say the holy man is the Pope the holy man is the bishop the holy man is Christ the holy spirit in us how can you say the Ley has no word to say each one of you has something to say each one of you got a work to do each one of you got to carry a message the Holy Ghost separated itself on the day of Pentecost God separating him that day you'll know that I in the Father the father me I and you and you and me that day the Holy Spirit overall in all through all amen there is the holy spirit has a right to move anywhere that he wants to upon anybody he wants to you don't have to take what some bishop or some priest says he's our only priest right a high priest now Prophet priest and King now and Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness the first begotten of the dead again and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood the word wash there actually in the Greek means to loose he loosed us from our we were tied to the Earth by our sins we couldn't see couldn't hear had no conception of Heaven or nothing but when the blood came down it cut the line and we got loosed I read a story one time it's uh may fit in good right here a farmer called a crow and he tied him and he said I'll teach the other crows a lesson so he tied the old crow and by leg with a string and a poor old thing like starve to death is so weak it could hardly walk around that's what some of these organizations and churches is tied to people people down just can't well this is all for you can go days of Miracles just pass yet you're just tied that's all there is no such thing as the Holy Ghost he don't speak in tongues like he used to he's God just the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews living in all the churches we'll get to it after this setting of this morning he's God that lives in every Church age he will live in every Church age and live in his people is For Eternity for we have now within us eternal life so this denomination had tied him down see while the days of Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine h a b fell hob along till he's supp poor he could hardly walk and one day there was a good man come by and he said you know that poor C I feel so sorry for him after all he might have been getting his corn that's only way he makes to liveing he's got to have something to eat so he didn't know any difference he just out there getting corn so if then he took he tuck his knife and cut the old C loose and you know here come the other crows come lord said come on Johnny Crow let's go south cold weather's coming you know what that Crow would just go as far as he could go out there he said I can't do it it's not it's just not far Us in this day we just can't do it see he had been tied so long until he thought he was still tied and that's where a lot of people you're tied down with Creeds and denominations from the old mother prostitute back there telling you that Jesus Christ isn't the same there's no such a thing is healing there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost there's none of this stuff like that trying to tell you that you've been tied so long till you still think you're tied the good man Christ gave his blood that he might wash us and loose us from our sin what is sin unless anybody to tell me what is sin sin is unbelief that's right he that believeth not condemned already and your sin is your only thing to keeps you from being free is because God cut you loose from your unbelief but you're so bad down with Creed till you still think you're tired just starving to death hbling around I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Baptist you tell me I'm Church of Christ the days of Miracle just pass know that's thing you poor starve Crow why don't you come along this morning why don't you fly away Hallelujah rise up for the wngs of the morning and F away to the son of righteousness for healing that's it brothers sisters oh he who the son is cut free is free indeed amen you said well my pastor nothing about that the Bible said you're free that's right you're free my church get cut loose has washed us and loosed us from our denominations in his own blood and has made us free so we can think for ourself and do for oursel and talk for oursel and act for oursel well if I went back and told the pastor I had to be re baptized to what about you're free this is a revelation all right you're free if you've been sprinkled with a little salt shake like this in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost there's a pool sitting here already this morning with water in it thing yes sir it's not right so you're not bound anymore you're free but maybe you don't know it but let me tell you this morning the Bible said he loosed us from our sins our unbelief that we might receive the Revelation Jesus Christ amen go away free have to take what any church says about it take what God said about it here's his Revelation revealing who he is always bre that God the father had long white beard white hair and the son with a middle-aged man and the Holy Ghost was a mascot boy brother that's paganism that's Pagan you believe in three Gods the very first commandment what is the first commandment he ye oh Israel I'm the Lord your God one God that's it he's one God not three Gods he lived in three offices served three places he's Prophet priest and King he's Eagle lamb and and lion he's the L Valley roll and Sharon L Valley and Morning Star rooting offspring of David he's from A to Z he's Father Son and Holy Ghost he's all that but he's one he's one God that's his titles that goes to him but there's one God never was anybody any page of the Bible or in history until the Catholic church is ever baptized by a mercy in the name of father son Holy Ghost if you show me the page or anything you write it l up on here to me tonight and I'll walk out this Church saying I am a hypocrite I have taught people wrong if you can show me one text of scripture or bring me one history authentic history that will show me that were that people ever baptized in the Bible in the name of father son holy ghost or bring me one script or one uh uh book of History one page one quotation in history where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost until the N seen counsil of the Catholic Church come bring it to me I'll pin a sign on my back and walk through Jeffersonville and you behind with a horn blowing I'll put on there a false prophet misleading the people Pastor if here you this morning and do that you let me do that to you hallu now what is it this is the Revelation this is the Revelation Hallelujah and this is the holy spirit Christ sending his message to the churches he praise the Lord hear it that's what the Bible teaches thank where did it come in at if you'll just won't get angry move away through the weak you you get the ni councils uh get the host to Bab get now Josephus history is all right but he only wrote one paragraph of Christ said there was a man named Jesus who ran un healing the people and he died pilot killed him and and her or put him to death and then the disciples went and stole his body away he out in each night to go cut a piece off of it and eat it so they were cannibals so it was taking communion you see the carnal mind Josephus is no one to listen to but take the fox book of the martyrs there's a good authentic fox book of Martyrs how many you ever read it uh the penman's early ages or or hoses 2 babblin or or some great authentic or the the most greatest we have is the Nan Council the pre- Nan Council and the Nan Council you find out there that was never mentioned no persons take the holy scriptures and see if there ever was anybody in the Bible ever baptized using those titles name Father Son and Holy Ghost it denotes three Gods it's for a pagan ceremony and Catholicism is nothing else in the world but a a pagan Farm of Christianity and from the Catholic Church come Martin Luther John Wesley Baptist Presbyterians and so forth but in the last days it was a door set between there that opened up the truth again that the Bible said so the great prophet was to come on the earth in the last days we believe he's coming watching he'll have a church now we'll see this now now remember this is the revelation for [Music]

the life I I Liv captive to the man I'd been but soon delivered by the Master's Hand he guided me to my Red Sea parted Waters and I walked [Music] across following the savior's [Music] lead little did I know he lead me to battle fight a fight I could could not win alone but with him I'd overcome the enemies surrounded me threatening to feend I thought I was to lose but I'd win battles with my Jesus little did I know a bed of r Moses wasn't [Music] promised when he said take up the cross my yoke is easy and my birden li but Freedom comes at greater cost though we suffer and we fight on here great in Heavens are reward for the battle it's already one with Jesus fighting on before and little did I know he lead me to battle fight a fight I could not went alone but with him I'd overcome the enemy surrounded me threatening defeat I thought I was to lose but I'd win battles with my Jesus little did I know we're going stand together like to just have a word of prayer with you before we get started just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you one more time and just expecting to hear from you Lord I know that I have nothing to give or offer these people in myself but if you would just come and move me completely out of the way father this morning that you can speak to your children Lord we'll be sure to give you all the honor and Glory if there's anything good that

things father bless this little body here bless the pastor Jesus name we pray amen amen well brother po did a pretty good job on introducing me so guess I don't have to do that myself I'm just happy to be here see some familiar faces brother Jensen sister Jensen their uh their son and grandbabies go to our church there in Alaska sure a blessing there uh don't know most of you here but sister Sharon God bless you brother po God bless you I recognize kind of uh your children and think I've seen them growing up at Harmony from time to time and that it sure is a blessing to the body your whole family has been God bless you this morning let's turn to the scripture uh in Genesis 22 to get started we'll start right there at the first verse and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Mora and offer him there for burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son enclaved the wood from the for the burnt offering and Rose up and went onto the place of which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said my father he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together you may be seated I'm going to read a another scripture in Jonah say Jonah first chapter and we'll uh read a couple verses at the top and then we'll jump down to the 17th so now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of amiti saying arise go to Nineveh that great City and cry against it for the wickedness has come up before me and Jonah rose up to flee onto Tarsus from the presence of the Lord and went down to japa and he found a ship going to tarus so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to go with them onto tarus from the presence of the Lord and then down to the 17th verse now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights now I uh titled this message and we'll see if it goes together the way it's titled but God has provided prepared and purposed and you know I was just kind of praying through the night brother po texted me yesterday and then early this morning I wasn't really sure you know if this was happening but I I want to be ready and uh you know how it goes sometimes nothing's coming nothing's coming and this morning I was reading through the scriptures and I thought about I thought about these two servants of God and you know in life we most of us are Christians in here I believe and I believe we're all here for a purpose anyways and God knows why you're here and and you know I don't know where you're at in life sometimes I don't know where I'm at in life but we're all in different places in our journey and I and I thought you know when when God came to Abraham and we know the story about Abraham and how God promised a son and and then and then he got this promis and here he is what God asked him to do and and it was no doubt not a easy thing if you can put yourself in this place for a moment and I'm reading the scripture and it says you know that God did tempt Abraham and he said and he said to him he he said take up thy son Isaac who thou love Isaac and who whom thou lovest and get thee to the land of Mora uh and offer him for a burn an offering upon the mountain which I will tell of thee and the next scripture says and Abraham rose up early in the morning and he begin to do what God told him to do you see God had told him to do a really hard thing he he he however God chose to speak to him at that time Abraham knew it was God just like sometimes we know it's God and he chooses and he speaks to us and he tells us to do a hard thing now Jonah God spoke to him as well and he told him to do a hard thing maybe it was a different situation maybe it was uh uh different circumstances but nonetheless it was a hard thing you know we all like I said before we're in a different place in life God may come to you at a different walk in your faith I I don't know where Jonah was at in the walk in his faith but his response was to run from the presence of God and Abraham's response was to wake up early in the morning and begin to gather the things together to do what God told them to do you know and and I I was reading that in different situations you might think one's harder than the other but Jonah didn't know Abraham's situation he wasn't in that place Abraham wasn't in Jo Jonah situation but you see these two sons of God doing the complete opposite you know and we look at Abraham and we know his story and and and our lives are type to that story but I want to look at Jonah for a few moments because I my life is typed to Jonah as well I I know what it's like to run from the presence of God you know they it it it's interesting isn't it the two different responses to when God come and tell them to do something now you can only imagine you can only imagine what they were going through I I I think of Jonah we know he didn't want to go down there th those who knows what those people were going to do to him not only that God might save him Jonah didn't he didn't know if he wanted that so he he chose to do the total opposite but nonetheless nonetheless he was a child of God nonetheless God he called him for a purpose and a reason and I look at Jonah and I I look at my life because I I done the same thing as Jonah I was raised in the message my dad was the associate pastor to the same church I I associate now and he passed away when I was very young and I knew what was right you know the Bible says train up a child in the way he should go and it will not depart from him when he's old and I know that to be the truth I know that to be the word of God because I I I departed I departed I left the word I Le I left the church I left the body and I went out and I began to run from the presence of God I began to live a life you know that you might see these people on the street in Alaska the homelessness is bad as well and I I don't I can't look down on them out there I can't look down on them out there the ones that don't have their minds the ones that are are literally lost and don't know where they're at because I've been there I've been there out of my mind lost didn't know where I was at literally many times running from the presence of God finding myself in a in a place where I thought I would never be thought you would you could never do the things that you're doing you you could never choose to do the things that you do I don't know I'm I don't want to get into it but you you you're just in a dark place and I I like that I'm not the only son of God that had to go through a dark place I look at Jonah's life and you know he was there running and he's in the boat he thinks he's he thinks he's getting away with it like I like I thought doing doing what you want hanging out with the friends that you want talking the way you want walking the way you want listening to the music that you want and all the while you're headed into a storm all the while you know maybe it gets a little rocky here and there and uh it's not so bad it's not so bad it'll pass I spent nights in on my mom's couch cuz I was homeless I I chose to be homeless my mom always had an open door for me and when I absolutely had nowhere else to go I had no other options and I was sick of sleeping on the street I would go home and I would lay on the couch and and I would be going through withdrawals I'd be going through with I don't I if you know what those are but withdrawals from substance abuse and I'd be laying on the couch and I'd be hearing things and just evil things in your mind you hear them uh you hear them audiable and you I would just be laying there and I'd be seeing things hallucinating and I would just think it'll be better in the morning it'll be better in the morning it'll be better in the morning I would tell myself all night you know I don't know how how long they were in that boat maybe telling theirself it'll be better in the morning maybe they they were you know I don't know how long they were traveling along and the the boat was starting to rock and things were getting a little scary and and they thought you know we've been in a storm like this before but then it just kept getting worse and worse till maybe it got to a point where they've never been in a storm like that before and it was getting into a condition where they were getting desperate they were looking around who whose fault is this you know uh I could only type my my own personal experience to this may I was looking around and whose fault is this I'm in a place in life I'm in I'm in a condition in life that I've never been before and it looks like I'm headed to certain Doom I'm headed to uh I'm headed to a sure end and I I'm looking around and everybody else might be looking and not knowing what's going on with me and how did I end up in this place or what's going on and but I I'm I'm Jonah and I know what's going on they they see the boats Rock and they see the storm but they don't know why but deep down I know why you know as Christians as as sons of God as as somebody that has called for a purpose as somebody that God ha has decided to choose to set you apart to be an example to be a witness to be a light to be a representative as somebody that he's called you might not know it yet you might not know who you are what you're called to do but God if he has called you deep down inside you know why things are the way they are sometimes you know it and there comes a time where we got to be honest we got to be honest with oursel and I got a whole bunch of notes brother Po and this is not in any of them but I I just relate to Jonah so much I can't read the scripture without just falling into it just seeing myself in the boat going back to the places where I've been being on my mom's couch it'll be better in the morning and just darkness around me you know the the the Bible the Bible tells us what happens is but brother brandom goes into a little bit more detail about it I don't think I like I said it's not my notes so I don't have the exact quote but I'm sure you heard it before he he said that they bound up his hand hands and his feet they bound up Jonah's hands and his feet Jonah said I'm the problem it's because I'm running from God you guys will be out of this situation if you just toss me out and you know I find it interesting that Jonah didn't just jump out you know we know what needs to happen but it it takes maybe a brother or sister or somebody to tie us up to get to tie us up and put us in a place and say I I don't have the my own self-will Pastor pray for me you can't pray for yourself brother pray for me sister pray for me you can't pray for yourself I've been there I would say it was better in the morning but I couldn't pray because I didn't think God could hear me I didn't think God would take me out of that condition I just didn't know him good enough yet but they bound up his feet they bound up his hands and the storm was raging and the boat was rocking and and I thought often times you know if it was anybody else if it was anybody else in that condition getting tossed into the sea let me just back up for a moment try to get back on track said God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah you see God he prepared a way for Jonah it might have not been the way that Jonah wanted see Jonah was called for a purpose and God didn't only he had he had a way prepared for Jonah to accomplish that purpose brother brandom said he don't believe Jonah was backsliding he's that's a quote like I said not in my notes but you find it he he took up for Jonah Bound in the midst of a storm thrown into the sea but God had prepared a great fish to swallow him up to anybody else they'd be a dead man not a chance not a chance to be thrown into the sea bound hands and feet and then a fish eats you you're dead if it was anybody else you see but it was Jonah and Jonah had a purpose in God's plan God had had called Jonah for a specific specific purpose and it didn't matter what Jonah's life looked like it didn't matter actually the decisions that Jonah made you know that because to us it looks like he made the wrong decisions he made the wrong choice he he ran away and Abraham if he was a Seed of Abraham the devil might tell you if you were a child of Abraham if you if you had real faith if you were really a Christian you would do exactly like Abraham did and you would get up early in the morning though it was hard though it was something you didn't want to do you didn't want to give up that it was an unthinkable ask the devil will tell you you're not saved you don't got it it's not for you if your life looks like Jonah but the word of God tells me that Jonah was a son of God and that God he had prepared a fish to accomplish his plan you see we know if if Jonah didn't end up in the belly of a fish he might have not converted the people of Nineveh I think of the wells belly that I've been in I think of the Walk that I walked I think of the things that the devil has told me I'm just telling you my testimony uh how how the Bible relates and I relate and whatever God can do for you you you allow him to do that you put yourself in the scripture maybe you're not Jonah maybe you're Abraham in this certain instance truthfully you're both you're a child of God you're part of this word you have a purpose God has provided a way I think of the the fish that I've been in I've been in a fish of alcoholism I've been in a fish of Despair uh brother brandom he says he says you think you have symptoms what about Jonah seaweed all wrapped around his neck fish vomit everywhere can't see he don't know which way's up which way's down I've been there I've experienced that not like Jonah I probably would have been dead that wasn't my purpose exactly like Jonah but my purpose was to be in the Well's belly that I was in and your and your purpose maybe you were in the Well's belly of some sort darkness and despair depression depression self-doubt I think a lot of us have that seaweed wrapped around our neck from time to time but don't be discouraged remember the promise do like Jonah do you like Jonah let me let me move a little on from that let's let's talk about Abraham now maybe Abraham's condition I want to point out that God prepared that way for for Jonah he prepared it now God provided a way for Abraham God provided a lamb in in the time that he needed it God prepared a fish for Jonah God provided a lamb for Abraham see God he provides he prepares and he purposed he's in control of all of it he has a reason for everything in your life in my life he has a reason I often thought about Abraham's ask what God was asking him to do I just can't imagine I have two young boys of myself I didn't have to to wait 25 years for them it w you know I didn't it didn't come to me like it came to Abraham they just showed up one of them what a blessing and I can't imagine I can't imagine what Abraham was going through we read the scripture and it seems like oh he just got up in the morning and here he goes and maybe he did that but I just do you know how the devil can you imagine the battle that was going on in his mind can you imagine the things that he was going through that morning brother bradam dramatized it he said that maybe he didn't even tell Sarah he couldn't bear to he got up got the things collected put the knife in the bag got the burn off got the wood chopped it up put it on Isaac's back and here we go ah it was a three days journey of this rolling around in the back of Abraham's head he was doing what God told him to do he had faith in God he he had Faith just like he told the young men his servants he said we're going to go up and we're going to go worship God and we will return he had Faith but even so how hard you can't bear to see your little child hurt you can't bear to see you your you can't I can't I can't bear to not only see him hurt but imagine doing it myself you can't and I just see Abraham he's he's walking there's the mountain but God showed me there it is it's getting close to the time that I have to do what God's told me to do I just I just can't even imagine your boy I just I just think of my little boy they're so precious they're so innocent they're so trusting they just believe that I have their best interest they just trust that I'm going to protect them and take care of them and Abraham he would do the same but God's asking him to do something hard Abraham would do anything for his boy but he would do more for God he put God above everything in his life he put God absolutely first and he had faith in the word of what God has promised that he would have the promised seed come forth from this young man this young boy but I see him walking up the mountain and it's just him and and the boy and you know how you have those conversations with just you and your son and sometimes they ask ridiculous questions but Isaac was thinking that day that was a valid question walking and maybe Abraham seemed a little down maybe his countenance was a little heavy and Isaac's noticing and he begins to realize Papa um looks like we're going up to sacrifice something I see the wood I see the fire where's lamb oh how that must ripped Abraham's heart apart how that must have hurt so bad but I believe faith in the time that Abraham needed it every time that Abraham needed it Faith would rise up and speak speak he said Son God will provide the sacrifice I I go back to a place in life where Faith some it rises up and it speaks you know when it's not you maybe you're praying and something comes out and that's not you I remember I was coming off of a just a horrible binge did all kinds of crazy stuff stole my my uncle's car my sister Sharon she was there they were out of town then I Disappeared for a week with the car without permission I was borrowing it but at the end of that I I I was in that despair again I just life got worse and worse wor and worse and worse and now I'm do like I said I'm doing things I never thought I would do my my uncle he gave me a house to live at he would feed me he gave me work and I would treat him like this you know that's how I I've seen Christ in people like that who though you treat him that way they still love you he he come home I was gone I'm I remember waking up one morning just kind of depressed and like I got to go face the music I got to go I can't live like this I got to go bring his car back and he's going to kick me out of the house and that's fine I'm I'm done anyways I'm done with the church I'm done with trying because I did try I went to church sometimes I tried but it wasn't working I thought some point you got to stop trying you just got to give it up I came home and I thought he was surely going to come out it was a Saturday night thought he's going to come out and it's it's going down like something's going to happen I don't know what something you know whatever happens happens he never came out early that morning Sunday morning he came out he said John I had to pray he said I was going to kill you he said I don't understand we we've all tried the pastor's tried I've tried your mom's tried everybody's tried and we thought you had it because I was doing okay I was putting on the face I was going to church I'd raise my hands I'd sing the songs and then all of a sudden just this curveball all of a sudden in Well's belly and he saidwhat do you want to do that whole night I thought of the things that I wanted to do just not not live I can't do that just disappear that's probably the best option just leave everything many everybody a lot of people do it I can do it too I don't need anybody these are the thoughts these were my own thoughts that I had but when he asked me the question what do you want to do without thinking about the answer I said I want to get up you know I believe Jonah was in that Well's belly and all it Revelation struck him and it said look to the temple remember the prayer of Solomon and look to the temple remember the word of God and get up oh I just same thing with Abraham I believe as he was walking and Faith just struck him and he said God will provide the lamb don't worry about it son you see I don't know how long Jonah was in the wells belly after he prayed the prayer we know he was in there for three days three nights we we know that but we don't know when he prayed the prayer did it happen an hour after he was in the belly a day I'm sure every day seemed like forever and maybe he didn't know where that he didn't I don't imagine the Bible doesn't say he knew it was swimming to Nineveh but he knew what he had to do when he stepped off on the shore and here he is oh that's Nineveh probably just face plet in the sand oh okay all right Lord I know I'll do it I want to get up I believe if you're a child of God you have the same thing inside of you no matter where you're at no matter where you're at in life today he said get up let's go to church so I did I went to church and they sang the songs the sing Amazing Grace and I there was times where I could feel the presence of God growing up I didn't feel the presence of God that time but I cried it's because I didn't feel his presence and I heard so often if you would just repent and ask for forgiveness that he would come and it's the truth but sometimes he'll make you wait sometimes he'll make you prove your faith just like Abraham see Abraham knew the lamb God would provide it but he still had some walking to do he still had some mind battles to go through it wasn't over right there on the spot Jonah he prayed the prayer and like I said I don't know but it probably felt like a long time before he got the answer and I sat in church and and and still feeling like I was in darkness still feeling like I was lost actually feeling like I crossed the line and now we were done and I'm asking God I'm sorry I don't want to be like this I don't want to do this uh we we'll we're just going to uh we're just going to get rid of the notes because uh they're they're gone you think you know what the Lord wants you to do I I cried the whole service I cried the whole service not filling the Pres you know you feel the presence of God and you cry appreciation maybe it's sorrow for you know you can do better and just whatever the reason you feel the presence of God and it make it moves you I was moved I it was not the same cry it's a different cry it was a cry of I felt like I was totally lost I knew it was the truth I know the truth and I I just believe Jonah he must have felt similar feelings he knew the truth and now he's in this fish's belly and it's over it's over service I got through it and they'd have potluck there in the fellowship hall and I went to the car and I just cried some more I just cried and cried and cried I I I don't know if you've ever been there you're lost we've all been there whether we know it or not my uncle he found me in in the car and knocks on the window and I roll it down he says I was looking for you and you know I don't got nothing to say really I'm just listening he said you know John God's a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him and if I look back on my life now at that moment I didn't know what was happening but if I look now that was a I had a little faith because I believed it you know the life the condition that you're in now might it might not look like you have faith the devil's going to tell you that you don't but I remember thinking I don't know what diligently means but I haven't done that and then he told me the story of the chicken peeping its way out of the EG and now he said that that was God's provided way he said there was no other way of doing it for that chicken to be born it had to scrape it had to struggle to be born and now he read me that quote gave it to me I read it myself and that night I went home and back into the shop that I was living in and I begin to try to diligently seek God many times in my life I tried grew up in and out of it many times in my life I didn't try many times in my life I try to make a deal with God how silly we are sometimes as if we have anything to offer God really well let me make a trade with you I'll be good if you be good her he is he is the best he is the greatest we can't out you can't ever outgive God but yet he so loves you so much he loves you so much that he won't leave you in the wells belly he won't he won't he won't leave Abraham without his promise being fulfilled I I did though I went back and I begin to pray I begin to seek God I begin to listen to brother bram's tapes I begin to read the Bible and just doing everything that I could do I don't you know it's not about the work but God wants to see a willingness to do his word a willingness to act upon the faith that he's placed inside of you and you will if you're a child of God there's no way around it Jonah could do nothing to get out of the will of God it's too bad for Jonah or too good for Jonah put him in a place that he didn't want to be put me in a place that I didn't want to be maybe you're in a place that you don't want to be today but God loves you God's allowed it he wants to bring forth his purpose in you he wants to fulfill a purpose that he has placed in you in this day I was in my room for three days kind of like Jonah's belly the the Well's belly I did get to go out of my room because I wasn't literally in the belly but I didn't eat nothing I couldn't go to work I went to work the one day I tried I went to work and I couldn't even sweep the floor couldn't do nothing so I just went back to my room begin to pray and cry and just Lord show me something I'm doing all I can I don't want to be lost I don't I don't want to be in this condition for the rest of my life I won't last long like this and I I I just remember it was that happened Sunday it was Monday Tuesday and it was Wednesday morning was late in the night Tuesday night Wednesday morning I don't remember what tape was playing I don't remember what I was thinking but I was there trying to seek God if you take anything and if you take anything away from this sometimes you got to diligently seek God and just like Abraham and Jonah had different responses and different Journeys my journey and your journey are going to be different it's not going to be exactly the same you might you might not have to do what I've done young people but God will show you what you need to do and then just do that rather than take the the other the long route but I was sitting there and all of a sudden I felt the presence of God like I've never felt it before maybe even since and it was the simplest the simplest thing that he told me he said I died for you there it was over Church of the Living God if you just if your faith could reach out and look to that sacrifice to look to that provided way to look to that prepared way and you look to the promise that was given to you you're going to hear the same words that I heard you're going to hear the same word I died for you and it wasn't like the Bible says the world it was for you it was for you it was for me it was my name in the book it was my name in the scripture I died for you I came from glory and I died for you that you could have this that you have now my life was never the same I told my sister Sharon the next day I don't I know if she beli me or not but I told her anyways and I told everybody said I have never been more alive this has never been more real I told my Uncle I'm telling him I'm just chatting his ear off riding in the truck you know how we get he's busy though he's driving we're working I'm just and then I stop I think I think I got the Holy Ghost I told him he said that's nice that don't stop me oh man he told me the devil's got a Punch coming I said all right thank you you know he was telling the truth God he has a purpose for our lives you know I I we might live our whole lives and you know as a minister you want to see people come to the Altar and give their life to God you want to see people's lives change you want to see all these things and but sometimes you're just there to help maybe it's just to help a Christian get through one one more day maybe it's just to remind a brother or sister he died for you he gave his life for you my life's never been the same since just like the devil brought brought me to places that I thought I would never go God has brought me to places that i' never thought I would go and the contrast is not even comparable one offers death one offers life Sister Jesse not a longwind at preacher especially when I Veer from my notes I believe God's children have faith maybe I will read one of my quotes just go ahead and uh put the one that's the rising of the sun know my notes had it laid out how God he he prepared your life the things that you go through and he provided the way which is his sacrifice that he gave for purpose it says Hebrews 138 said he is the same yesterday today and [Music] forever we has beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life there never was a life lived like it he was the son of God and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that is a living and how can we do it by word only for it is written the gospel came not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive now if there is another gospel as Paul spoke to one of the groups I am surprised that you turned to another gospel which there is no other but I make but a make belief gospel to a denomination fiction turning from the good news and because I live you live also and I live in you and the works that I do John 1412 The Works that I do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be light at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the dead we as beneficiaries who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that He Is Alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only ref reflect exactly what we're pointing to I'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to Christ we are getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to Christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has the son has life and if the life of man that's dead be projected in you you will live the same life life he lived if the blood of a man was a certain type and you took the blood of one man and changed the blood of one man into another he would absolutely be the that typed blood and if your spirit that's in you is wreck and dead and you are anointed with the life that was in Christ is upon you Romans 811 said if the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you it also quickened your mortal body that same life them same Powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on Earth from God he redeemed you a seed that was forn by God whose names was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world mind if I read a couple more things this is in the church age book this is the purpose this is the reason you went through all the things you went through this is this is the reason that you're here today this is the reason that Abraham had a walk the walk up the hill this is the reason that Jonah had to spend time in the belly of the well this is the reason that brother brandham lived the life that he lived and went through the suffering that he went through this is the reason and purpose that God has Church age book uh page 336 but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last age he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own Bride As the spirit of God he came down and he created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to Simply give life to a human oven oium supplied by Mary that would have been a sinful mankind producing a body that would not have produced the last Adam of him it was said Lo a body hast thou father prepared for me God not Mary provided the body Mary was the human incubator and she carried the holy child and brought him in birth it was a God man he was the son of God he was the New Creation man and God met and joined he was the first of this new race he is the head of this new race Colossians 1:18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence second Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things are become new there you can see that though man was of the old of the old order of creation or old order or creation Now in Union with Christ he has become the new creation of God Ephesians 2:10 for we are his workmanship created in Union with Christ Jesus onto uh good works Ephesians 4:24 and that ye put on the new man which God which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness the new creation is not the old creation made over or it would not be called a new creation that is exactly what it says it is a new creation that is an it is another creation distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of Flesh that was how he dealt with Israel he chose Abraham and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly Isaac line but now out of every kindred tribe and Nation he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his Spirit he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator created himself a part of his creation now here it is this is the true revelation of God this was his purpose purpose this purpose took form through election that is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church as author of this new creation of God his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will by his omnicient and omnipotence he brought it to pass how else could he know that he would be standing in the midst of the church receiving Glory from his Brethren if he did not make sure all things he knew and all things he worked out according to what he knew in order that his purpose and good pleasure be brought to pass Ephesians 2:11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the Council of his own will brother brandham says hallelujah with an explanation point aren't you glad you belong to him I did want to point out one more thing God's purpose we see his purpose in Isaac we know that that lamb was a spoken word Ram brother brandom said it would have been eaten by wild animals there was no food up there there was no reason for that Ram to be there but God he spoke it we know that Jesus was that spoken word amen Jesus the spoken word is here today he wants to live in you he wants to manifest himself in you he has prepared a body for himself not just the life that you've had to go through but your life is a preparation of God he prepared your life these lives that we live all through history how he can see himself in the midst of the candlesticks because he was right in the midst of the body that he created for himself which you are you love him today you know what I love about him is I relate to Jonah and a lot of people think Jonah was not very smart but you know Jesus also related to Jonah he used that backsliding preacher's life the Bible says was running from the presence of God and he took that life and when the people were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonas the prophet for as Jonas was in for for as Jonas was a sign onto the ninevites so shall the son of man be to this generation Hallelujah you know how God can take a broken vessel runner from his presence and make you a sign to this generation how we can take a backslid a backslider and a prophet would come and say he wasn't backsliding but God had a reason and a purpose for his life no matter what the condition look like you love him today walking in my shoes the Bible says a greater and Solomon is [Music] here the Bible says that these same things that Jesus did you shall do also and greater and [Music] more he's called us out of the world he's called us out of Darkness he's called us out of our addictions he called us out of our depressions maybe you say oh I'm still in it no he's called you out of it yeah the the the symptoms might still be there the seaweed might still be wrapped around your neck maybe I don't know how he got out of the the bounds that he was in but God he released him at some point you may still feel bound you may still feel like you're in darkness but you're looking to the sacrifice you're looking to the promise you may be having the symptoms all around you but God has already set you free God has already spoke to your issue if you need healing he said by his stripes it's done if you if you have not found this Jesus that that will come down and tell you that he's died for you hallah he was bruised for your iniquity oh if you need peace today he took it as they scorned him and mocked him he made that available to you oh if you'd only look to that sacrifice if you'd only look to that cross if you'd only look to that spoken word that has has been provided if you'd only speak out the faith that's in your heart today it's already done church it's as good as finished you are an eternal creature now now seated in Heavenly places right now oh it's his purpose that you would live it's his purpose the Bible says I have purposed it I will also do it God has never failed one time keep playing it I'm going to tell you a testimony real quick sister Elise her her mother's sister Vera at our church [Music] now Sister ver told me a testimony one time of a living God she was struggling with many things but the biggest symptom was cancer she was carrying it not everybody knew she said one night at watch night she was sitting out back and just battling praying life wasn't looking so good there was another sister there who who left the church but by God's grace she's back many years was gone just seen her recently she told me the same testimony she was there she was a witness sister ver this side her side was she was sitting there she was praying and all of a sudden she felt the presence of God just wash over her body you know he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same one that spoke that Ram into existence the same one that did the squirrels the same one that did the storm the same one that said I want to get up washed over her she said she knew she was healed now sister Tina told me that she was out back she took her kids out you know as mamas you got to deal with your kids and that's hard God sees you God knows everything that you're going through and he's mindful he gave this mama a witness of something Supernatural she said she was sitting there and she's seen sister ver praying she was Sister ver was [Music] crying Tina just started praying for her didn't know what was all going on in her life and she said she had her head bowed and all of the sudden she's seen [Music] somebody standing next to Sister Vera and she's seen the feet of this Angel a robe see sister Vera said she felt the presence I think she said she seen the light sister Tina saw the being standing next to her and she's got reverent she said I can't look all I can't look at it she said the service went on that happened and the end of service she couldn't get off her mind what was Sister Vera praying for the angel to come stand next to her brother brandom says they walk up and down the aisles they're here this morning that same God is here this morning if I could only get that across to you if you could only let your faith believe that for whatever you have need of she couldn't take it anymore so she had to ask she said sister ver what were you praying she said I was praying that God would not take these trials from me but that he would help me through him let's stand [Music] together you love him this morning he'll heal you he'll save you he'll give you peace just look to that sacrifice that provided way for he has a purpose he used to walk on this Earth with sandals on his feet the people gathered around just to hear him speak with hands that healed the sick Open the Eyes that could
