[2:19] look at this Butler and this Vaper in
[2:21] there and they both had dreams and Jesus
[2:24] when he was in his prison house remember
[2:26] Joseph was in prison and when Jesus in
[2:30] his prison house packed to a
[2:33] cross there was one saved and one lost
[2:37] Joseph when he was in his prison one was
[2:39] saved one was
[2:41] lost I noticed then after Jesus was
[2:44] taken off the cross he was exalted into
[2:46] heaven and sets at the right hand of the
[2:48] great spirit
[2:50] Jehovah no man can come to God except by

[3:22] come to Glory that the son had been lost
[3:26] Adam did God send an angel
[3:30] did he send a son did he send anyone
[3:33] else he came his to redeem his lost
[3:38] son
[3:41] Hallelujah God didn't trust it with no
[3:43] one but himself God was made flesh and
[3:45] dwell Among Us and redeemed man himself
[3:48] it's a we are saved the Bible said by
[3:50] the blood of
[3:54] God the Mortal God was the immortal God
[3:57] was made Mortal in order to take away
[4:00] sin to be the lamb himself to enter into
[4:03] Glory veiled and with the own blood
[4:06] before him Beyond the Veil now Joseph
[4:10] down into Egypt he goes and there he was
[4:14] exalted from his prison to the right
[4:17] hand of pharaoh and was made the
[4:19] caretaker and everything prospered in
[4:22] the days of Joseph now when Jesus
[4:25] returns even the desert shall Blossom

[16:54] quotation who is this who is this J go
[16:58] far
[16:59] I am Alpha and Omega I'm A and
[17:03] Z
[17:06] amen the Greek A and Z Greek alphabet
[17:10] acts
[17:11] 236 Peter said there's not another name
[17:13] given under Heaven whereby man must be
[17:15] saved or no I beg your pardon M qu he
[17:17] said let all the house of Israel know
[17:19] surely that God has made this same Jesus
[17:21] who you crucified both Lord in
[17:25] Christ John 147 and12 Thomas said Lord
[17:29] show us the father is satisfied said
[17:31] I've been so long with you you don't
[17:32] know me said he that seen me has seen
[17:35] the father why I say th show me the
[17:37] father I am a father a one am I said
[17:40] that one time to a person a lady said
[17:42] just a minute Mr Ram said you and your
[17:44] wife are one two I said but not that
[17:47] kind she said I beg your pardon I said
[17:50] do you see me she said I do I said you
[17:52] see my wife she said no I said then
[17:54] they're a different kind he said when
[17:55] you seen me you have seen the father
[18:00] so that was enough for that so in St
[18:02] John or first John 57 to8 you always put
[18:06] it down 1 John 578 the Bible said the
[18:10] speaker the very same man that wrote
[18:11] this Revelation that Jesus giving he
[18:13] said there are three that bear record in
[18:16] heaven the Father the word the word is
[18:19] the son the Father the word and the Holy
[18:21] Ghost and these three are one there are
[18:25] three that bear record in earth water
[18:27] blood and spirit and they agree not are
[18:30] one but they agree in one you cannot
[18:33] have the father without having the son
[18:35] you cannot have father or some without
[18:37] having the Holy Ghost right but you and
[18:40] water blood and spirit that's the
[18:42] elements it takes to get into his body
[18:44] when a natural birth takes place what's
[18:45] the first thing happens when a woman
[18:47] giving birth to a baby first thing is
[18:50] water second thing is blood that right
[18:53] next thing is Spirit the baby touches
[18:56] the breath start breathing water blood
[18:58] and spirit that constitutes the natural
[19:00] birth also the spiritual birth water
[19:02] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[19:05] justification by faith believing on the
[19:07] Lord Jesus Christ water what's the next

[1:08:37] of noise but a joyful noise noise for
[1:08:42] the Lord is good Romans chapter 7 is
[1:08:47] where we'll take our text for a
[1:08:51] Thanksgiving message it's the same
[1:08:53] message the prophet took
[1:08:56] when he brought the message the
[1:08:57] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[1:09:00] in verses number
[1:09:04] 1-6 we'll turn
[1:09:13] there know you not brethren for I speak
[1:09:17] to them that know the law how that the
[1:09:20] law hath dominion over a man as long as
[1:09:23] he liveth for the woman which hath a
[1:09:26] husband is bound by the law to her
[1:09:28] husband so long as he liveth but if the
[1:09:31] husband be dead so if the husband be
[1:09:35] dead she is loosed from the law of her
[1:09:39] husband so then if while her husband
[1:09:42] liveth she be married to another man she
[1:09:45] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[1:09:48] husband be dead she is free from that
[1:09:50] law so that she is no adulteress though
[1:09:54] she be married to another man wherefore
[1:09:58] my brethren ye also are become dead to
[1:10:02] the law by the body of Christ that ye
[1:10:06] should be married to another even to him
[1:10:10] who raised from the dead that we should
[1:10:13] bring forth fruit unto God for when we
[1:10:17] were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[1:10:20] which were by the law did work in our
[1:10:22] members to bring forth fruit unto
[1:10:28] death but now we are delivered from the
[1:10:32] law somebody say praise the Lord praise
[1:10:34] the Lord that being dead wherein we were
[1:10:38] held that we should serve in newness of
[1:10:42] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:10:45] letter amen may God add a blessing to
[1:10:48] the reading of his word title of the
[1:10:50] message this morning is Thanksgiving in
[1:10:53] the Golden Age a Thanksgiving in the
[1:10:58] golden a age God bless you you may be
[1:11:01] seated now this scripture in Romans
[1:11:03] chapter
[1:11:04] 7 as the prophet brings it to us that
[1:11:08] was a Thanksgiving text that he took in
[1:11:11] the message invisible Union of the bride
[1:11:13] of Christ and this is one of the latter
[1:11:16] messages that he preached a series there
[1:11:19] in shreport 1965 of November he took the
[1:11:24] invisible Union
[1:11:25] works his faith expressed trying to do
[1:11:28] God a service without it being his will
[1:11:31] I've heard but now I see God's only
[1:11:34] provided place of worship and on the
[1:11:37] wings of a snow white dove he brings a
[1:11:40] series of solid you know solid teaching
[1:11:45] and real core uh visions and things that
[1:11:49] we believe and hold to very
[1:11:51] firmly these messages he made made it
[1:11:55] very clear that he would have been
[1:11:58] preaching it in his own Tabernacle but
[1:12:01] that uh he had the opportunity to preach
[1:12:04] across the Nations to the churches that
[1:12:07] followed his message so he asked for the
[1:12:09] courtesy from Brother the pastor there
[1:12:12] brother Jack Moore that for the local
[1:12:15] church not to take it personal some of
[1:12:17] the statements that he would make
[1:12:19] because there would be some Doctrine in
[1:12:21] there the
[1:12:23] courtesy and brother BR of operated that
[1:12:25] way I love the way he respected other
[1:12:29] people their pulpits their
[1:12:33] Ministries when they told them told him
[1:12:35] the Lord told them something he
[1:12:37] respected that and he wasn't um a person
[1:12:42] that went around telling everybody what
[1:12:44] to do offering his opinion all the time
[1:12:48] and brother Billy Paul had shared that
[1:12:50] with us that you know if a brother came
[1:12:54] in or person came in and told Brother
[1:12:57] banam the Lord told him to do this and
[1:13:00] told him to do that he would just tell
[1:13:02] them well you need to do what the Lord
[1:13:04] told you to
[1:13:05] do and but if they came in and asked for
[1:13:08] the will of God then he can open up his
[1:13:11] heart and share with them um what he saw
[1:13:15] what he the Lord has showed him and I
[1:13:17] just love that you know that freedom
[1:13:20] that he had and he gave he extended but
[1:13:24] in this message he
[1:13:26] um opens up and tells us that this was a
[1:13:29] Sunday school teaching and that it was
[1:13:31] actually Romans chapter 7 was a prophecy
[1:13:35] of the Church of the last days and so if
[1:13:40] you look into the text there in Romans
[1:13:42] chapter 7 and you look at it as a future
[1:13:46] prophecy then that is um not so much to
[1:13:51] the people that heard it it's not so
[1:13:53] much even when it was wrote or written
[1:13:57] prophecy speaks of the future and so
[1:14:00] when there's a prophetic scripture or a
[1:14:04] prophetic Vision or the truths like
[1:14:07] first second and third pull there's a
[1:14:10] prophetic element to it meaning that
[1:14:13] there's a future unfolding of those
[1:14:16] things that we the true church should be
[1:14:19] looking for God is a God of Prophecy
[1:14:22] your Bible is written in the spirit of
[1:14:26] Prophecy when you go down on your knees
[1:14:28] to pray if God reveals something to you
[1:14:32] it's in the sense of Prophecy he's
[1:14:34] showing you something to come this is
[1:14:37] how warnings come this is what dreams
[1:14:39] are this is really what gifts are for
[1:14:42] this is really what the scriptures are
[1:14:44] for so you can prepare yourself for
[1:14:47] what's to come it's prophetic the Bible
[1:14:51] is written that way it's not written as
[1:14:53] like a story so we can just laugh and
[1:14:55] hahhaa and be interested in what
[1:14:58] happened in the Old Testament those
[1:15:00] things did happen there are some funny
[1:15:02] funny moments there is some moments that
[1:15:04] are intriguing but really it's a
[1:15:06] prophetic book and as you can see how it
[1:15:10] pertains to your life then you'll know
[1:15:12] how to handle yourself govern yourself
[1:15:15] you know how to choose a job choose a
[1:15:17] wife choose a husband choose a career
[1:15:20] based on the prophecy of the prophetic
[1:15:24] utterances that are in the Bible It
[1:15:27] prepares us for what's to come we
[1:15:30] already know what happened we already
[1:15:32] know what was yesterday but who knows
[1:15:35] what tomorrow holds the word does who
[1:15:38] knows how to prepare how to know and no
[1:15:41] to build an ark you can't build it when
[1:15:44] it starts raining you have to build it
[1:15:46] before it started to rain who gave him
[1:15:49] instructions how smart was he what kind
[1:15:52] of IQ did he have who down who told him
[1:15:55] the secret the Lord did and the same
[1:15:58] Lord that spoke to Noah Moses Jesus John
[1:16:02] the Baptist ought to be the same Lord
[1:16:06] when you fall down on your knees that's
[1:16:09] speaking to you he will prepare you and
[1:16:13] you think you need to be smart to
[1:16:15] prepare yourself or get yourself ready
[1:16:18] how can you get yourself ready for
[1:16:19] things you know nothing of so we place
[1:16:22] our life in his hands
[1:16:25] he's the Good Shepherd I'm just a sheep
[1:16:28] I can't fight for myself I don't even
[1:16:30] know where I'm going I don't know which
[1:16:32] way is up or down but the shepherd knows
[1:16:35] and when I put my life In His Hands
[1:16:38] everything will work out all right
[1:16:40] always has in every age amen so it's
[1:16:44] prophetic this scripture is prophetic
[1:16:47] this teaching is prophetic and so here's
[1:16:50] where I got my title here in paragraph
[1:16:52] number 31 in the message
[1:16:58] um The Invisible Union of the bride of
[1:17:00] Christ I'll read for you
[1:17:03] here sister could pick it up for us in
[1:17:06] the back there paragraph number
[1:17:09] 31 he's laying this message
[1:17:12] out
[1:17:19] beautifully I'd like to title these few
[1:17:21] remarks that I was going to make here
[1:17:23] and some scriptures that I would like to
[1:17:25] follow up closely behind if the Lord are
[1:17:27] willing to the Thanksgiving message to
[1:17:30] the invisible the invisible Union of the
[1:17:33] bride of Christ The Invisible Union of
[1:17:36] the bride of Christ doesn't sound like a
[1:17:39] Thanksgiving message though any
[1:17:41] Scripture we're thankful for all of it
[1:17:45] I'm thankful to God to be living in this
[1:17:49] time of the closing scenes of this
[1:17:52] world's history
[1:17:55] I don't know if I would have had a say
[1:17:58] so before the foundation of the world if
[1:18:01] God would have laid out the whole
[1:18:03] program to me and said to me I want you
[1:18:06] to preach now what age do you desire to
[1:18:10] go to the Earth to preach I would have
[1:18:13] chose this age for I think this is the
[1:18:19] Golden
[1:18:20] Age I certainly would have loved to have
[1:18:22] been here during the time of his visit
[1:18:24] to Earth
[1:18:25] but I think this right now is a greater
[1:18:29] time because it's a time that he's
[1:18:33] coming to take the people that he's
[1:18:35] redeemed nearing the resurrection when
[1:18:38] all the redeemed will come forth what a
[1:18:42] glorious opportunity we have to speak to
[1:18:46] a dying people great time we are
[1:18:50] enthused about it and we know that
[1:18:53] history is closing out the world's
[1:18:56] history will soon be over then we're
[1:18:59] going to step into a new day to the
[1:19:02] great Millennium that is one believer I
[1:19:04] believe in the Millennium reign with
[1:19:07] Christ so so very nice wouldn't you
[1:19:11] say that this is the Golden Age greater
[1:19:14] age any other age it's a beautiful time
[1:19:17] what a tremendous opportunity to live in
[1:19:21] this age I wonder if we don't see it
[1:19:24] that way it's closing history we're
[1:19:26] living in an age where there it it there
[1:19:30] may not be a tomorrow we're living in an
[1:19:32] age where it's going to finally all be
[1:19:35] over with and it's been revealed to us
[1:19:39] the age that we're looking in we know
[1:19:41] that it was a prophecy this scripture in
[1:19:45] Romans chapter 7 so let's look at that
[1:19:47] just for a minute quickly Romans 7
[1:19:51] interesting how the Apostle Paul speaks
[1:19:55] verses 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 he starts out
[1:19:59] with saying know ye not
[1:20:01] Brethren I speak to them that know the
[1:20:04] law how that the law hath dominion over
[1:20:08] a man as long as he liveth so he's
[1:20:11] bringing in the Old Testament law and
[1:20:14] he's bringing to the the men or the
[1:20:17] people that he's speaking to know that
[1:20:19] the law had dominion over a man while he
[1:20:22] liveth basically saying a dead man can't
[1:20:26] break the
[1:20:27] law a dead man can't commit adultery a
[1:20:31] dead man can't
[1:20:32] sin it it's only effect if you're alive
[1:20:36] the laws the Commandments only work if
[1:20:39] you're alive to do them when you're dead
[1:20:41] doesn't
[1:20:42] matter and so he's bringing that and
[1:20:46] then he brings in the woman being
[1:20:49] married to a
[1:20:50] husband and he he he he shares with us
[1:20:54] and he brings this type of the law with
[1:20:58] uh Grace and typing it to marriage and
[1:21:02] divorce the great subject in here he's
[1:21:05] he's speaking of is adultery a very
[1:21:09] interesting
[1:21:10] subject um it's a powerful Commandment
[1:21:14] that through your Bible Thou shalt not
[1:21:17] commit adultery was written and that is
[1:21:20] a man or woman uh uh living with someone
[1:21:24] that wasn't their
[1:21:26] husband wasn't their
[1:21:28] wife and this is the adultery that he's
[1:21:31] speaking of here but he's typing it to a
[1:21:35] man with the law and then uh the woman
[1:21:39] with her husband and then he brings in
[1:21:41] Christ with the body of Christ with
[1:21:45] Believers very nice how he brings that
[1:21:48] in he you notice he just doesn't say
[1:21:51] Christ you're United with Christ he said
[1:21:53] you're United with the body of Christ
[1:21:56] take your Bible with me for a minute
[1:21:57] verse four wherefore my
[1:22:00] brethren you also are become dead to the
[1:22:04] law by the body of
[1:22:07] Christ that you should be married to
[1:22:10] another even to him who is raised from
[1:22:13] the dead that we should bring forth
[1:22:16] fruit unto God so he's basically talking
[1:22:19] about marriage and divorce and he's
[1:22:21] talking about how a woman if she's
[1:22:23] married to to a man and she goes out and
[1:22:26] lives untrue to that man which is her
[1:22:29] husband she shall be called an
[1:22:32] adulteress she committed the sin of
[1:22:36] adultery but if her husband be
[1:22:39] dead then that law of her having to
[1:22:44] respect or live under that law that's
[1:22:47] dead she's free now to
[1:22:49] remarry and live in marriage and she
[1:22:54] won't be an adulterous now that's right
[1:22:56] it's it's uh he the the Apostle Paul is
[1:23:00] taking the Old Testament scriptures of
[1:23:02] the law of Moses because the Jews were
[1:23:05] so caught up in those laws the 220
[1:23:08] something laws that were there not just
[1:23:11] the Ten Commandments all the laws on
[1:23:14] what to eat dietary laws the clothes to
[1:23:16] wear how to treat your animal how to
[1:23:19] treat the stranger all these laws that
[1:23:21] were caught up in it and now he's
[1:23:23] bringing them from the law over to
[1:23:27] Christ and the example that he's giving
[1:23:30] that if a man and a woman are married in
[1:23:33] holy matrimony and that husband dies
[1:23:37] then that wife can now
[1:23:39] remarry and she did nothing wrong when
[1:23:42] she does
[1:23:43] so in verse four says wherefore my
[1:23:46] brethren ye also are become dead to the
[1:23:49] law by the body of Christ that ye should
[1:23:53] be what
[1:23:55] married to another even to him who is
[1:23:59] raised from the dead so ain't no single
[1:24:03] people in God's
[1:24:06] Church everybody's
[1:24:08] married you married to Christ if you're
[1:24:11] a
[1:24:12] Believer you you you've divorced the law
[1:24:16] of sin that ruled in your body and that
[1:24:19] thing is dead now thank you Jesus it's
[1:24:22] dead it's the old man now I'm
[1:24:27] remarried I'm married to Christ and he
[1:24:31] is the word and he is the body of Christ
[1:24:34] you know it's funny how we can be
[1:24:36] married to Christ and we looking at
[1:24:38] Jesus and Christ but then we'll disclude
[1:24:40] all the body of
[1:24:42] Christ there's some brothers there's
[1:24:46] some sisters there's young people
[1:24:49] there's the church that's made up of the
[1:24:51] body of Christ that you have to be
[1:24:53] joined with
[1:24:55] mhm yes yes and so verse five when you
[1:25:01] are in flesh the Motions of sin which
[1:25:03] were by the law did work in our members
[1:25:05] to bring forth fruit unto death talking
[1:25:09] about your old
[1:25:10] nature but verse six but now we are
[1:25:15] delivered from the old brother Israel
[1:25:19] actually he wasn't brother Israel he was
[1:25:20] just Israel the thug Israel the
[1:25:23] unbeliever
[1:25:25] y'all was thugs too sir y'all was
[1:25:28] Renegades too the Old Law the old Israel
[1:25:32] but now being dead where wherein you
[1:25:35] were held that we should serve in the
[1:25:38] newness of the spirit and not in the
[1:25:40] oldness of the letter
[1:25:45] now we become married to him to him that
[1:25:49] raised up from the dead so you'll see
[1:25:52] Paul is bringing this
[1:25:54] instructions on marriage and divorce but
[1:25:58] Christ in the church he does it in
[1:26:00] Ephesians chapter 5 as well he brings in
[1:26:03] a husband and wife how a a wife should
[1:26:06] be subject to her husband even as the
[1:26:10] church should be subject to Christ he
[1:26:13] does that play with that relationship
[1:26:15] between husband and wife Paul does that
[1:26:19] and it makes it more visual to you now
[1:26:23] so that we can bring forth fruit unto
[1:26:26] God and that we should serve in the
[1:26:29] newness of the spirit so what did this
[1:26:31] prophetic message bring to us one of the
[1:26:35] things that the prophet of God brought
[1:26:38] to us in this
[1:26:41] message
[1:26:43] is that this age this time we're not
[1:26:46] looking for a Revival we're looking for
[1:26:49] the coming of the Lord in our
[1:26:52] generation and if the coming of the Lord
[1:26:55] ain't a
[1:26:58] Revival the the coming of the Lord is an
[1:27:01] event it's a very special
[1:27:05] event it it's not a it's not a a nothing
[1:27:08] it's a
[1:27:10] something and if the Lord is coming
[1:27:12] coming to you personally coming to the
[1:27:14] church coming to the Believers to
[1:27:17] Rapture it that will be a special
[1:27:20] time you know many people like to use
[1:27:22] that quotes in paragraph 2 that we're
[1:27:25] not looking for Revival we're looking
[1:27:26] for the coming of the Lord so they'll
[1:27:28] try not to you know they'll try to
[1:27:30] downplay any move of God to the
[1:27:33] individual that's right yes sir but I
[1:27:35] don't care who you are if the word is
[1:27:38] fire and it touches you you will
[1:27:42] move if the word is on fire and it drops
[1:27:46] in your heart it will make you move it
[1:27:50] will have a response over your life you
[1:27:53] can't hold your
[1:27:55] peace amen amen and so it's a prophetic
[1:28:01] utterance in Romans chapter 7 and he's
[1:28:05] bringing this as a Sunday school
[1:28:07] teaching and then Paul brings the
[1:28:09] illustration between law and Grace
[1:28:12] marriage and divorce and then shows us
[1:28:15] all that we are married to Christ and
[1:28:18] the the real Sin here the real highlight
[1:28:22] here is adultery
[1:28:24] tree he brings it out that ye if if she
[1:28:28] lives with a man while her husband is
[1:28:31] still alive she shall be called an
[1:28:36] adulteress the scripture speak of this
[1:28:39] adulteress adulteress adulteries
[1:28:42] adulteress
[1:28:45] adulterer many many ways that it's
[1:28:47] written but the goal for this text and
[1:28:50] the goal for the Christ being you being
[1:28:53] married to Christ is that your faith
[1:28:57] would be
[1:29:00] unadulterated how many like that there's
[1:29:03] not a scripture that's that's used
[1:29:06] unadulterated but brother random used it
[1:29:08] an unadulterated Faith your faith needs
[1:29:13] to have no adultery in there and it's
[1:29:16] beyond a man in a woman getting married
[1:29:18] I'm talking about single people
[1:29:22] unadulterated faith is what the goal is
[1:29:26] that you would be married to
[1:29:29] Christ amen in the newness of life in
[1:29:32] the newness of the leather
[1:29:35] letter so he takes
[1:29:41] this and brings it to us some of the
[1:29:45] prophetic utterances in this message so
[1:29:48] now the goal is that our faith is
[1:29:51] unadulterated he brings in paragraph 79
[1:29:54] n the responsibility of a church after
[1:29:58] now we understand that it's Christ in
[1:30:00] the church or he's talking about a man
[1:30:02] and a woman but he's now talking about
[1:30:05] individuals and being married to Christ
[1:30:07] the word he who rose from the dead that
[1:30:10] you would walk in the newness of life
[1:30:12] then he drops in this sacred trust so
[1:30:16] let's get to it here just a minute in
[1:30:18] paragraph number I think I gave it to
[1:30:21] you back there sis paragraph number
[1:30:27] mhm
[1:30:40] 79 look at this
[1:30:42] Saints her body is given to her talking
[1:30:46] about a woman
[1:30:47] now a sacred Trust From God no female
[1:30:51] dog no bird nor other animal nor the
[1:30:54] creature like that no she's the only one
[1:30:57] by it she is the reason it's so sacred
[1:31:02] she's to bring forth life into the Earth
[1:31:04] her body is the bedding grounds of life
[1:31:07] therefore that's the reason she's given
[1:31:10] this sacred trust now hear you might
[1:31:13] disagree many of you theologians that's
[1:31:16] what's defiled the whole human race is
[1:31:19] that adultery at the beginning her
[1:31:22] beding ground was marred she brought
[1:31:24] forth those twins Canan Abel one act two
[1:31:27] children search the scriptures uh-huh
[1:31:30] notice now we find that her body is the
[1:31:32] betting ground therefore it's a sacred
[1:31:35] trust not to defile that now who is he
[1:31:38] talking
[1:31:40] about you Brothers some of your brothers
[1:31:43] say man he's talking about them sisters
[1:31:44] no he's talking about you he's talking
[1:31:47] about you the church that's
[1:31:50] right don't let it stay carnal Saints
[1:31:54] you know they they criticize Us in the
[1:31:56] article about you know some statement
[1:31:58] that was made in marriage and divorce
[1:32:00] about the woman and how her her you know
[1:32:03] her her um Her Sacred body and the
[1:32:07] origins and so forth and then some men
[1:32:10] will take that as like yeah the message
[1:32:12] is hard on sisters you missed the whole
[1:32:14] point he ain't talking about sisters
[1:32:16] he's talking about the church that
[1:32:19] there's no adultery in you the
[1:32:22] cleanliness that life is supposed to
[1:32:25] come forth out of your vessel and he
[1:32:28] called you to be a sacred trust you
[1:32:31] can't read everything in the news you
[1:32:33] can't look at everything out there in
[1:32:35] these worldly entertainments my brother
[1:32:38] my sister God has giv you a sacred
[1:32:42] trust to keep your vessel your body
[1:32:48] clean
[1:32:51] amen right
[1:32:55] notice her body is the beding grounds
[1:32:58] paragraph 81 therefore it's a sacred
[1:33:00] trust not defile not to defile that now
[1:33:04] I'm speaking now bringing this to an
[1:33:06] illustration to show you where the
[1:33:08] church
[1:33:09] stands I'm not speaking of you women
[1:33:13] whatever you are that's between you and
[1:33:14] God or you men but I'm speaking of the
[1:33:18] church and Christ did we get that can we
[1:33:21] see that s some s don't see that some
[1:33:25] brothers don't see that but that's what
[1:33:27] he just said right there he's talking
[1:33:29] about the church and
[1:33:31] Christ talking about it's harder than
[1:33:33] the sisters it's hard on
[1:33:36] everybody to get this
[1:33:38] right yeah you see God have mercy on us
[1:33:43] to look past the carnal and see the
[1:33:46] prophetic utterance of Romans chapter 7
[1:33:49] and what it was talking of
[1:33:51] Amen I want to name three things things
[1:33:54] that she must not get away from now I'm
[1:33:56] speaking keep the church in mind while
[1:34:00] I'm speaking this to the Natural Woman
[1:34:03] as Paul here in the seventh chapter of
[1:34:07] Romans so he brings that down and let's
[1:34:10] drop down to paragraph
[1:34:13] 100 we know what those three things are
[1:34:17] right virtue Womanhood and what was the
[1:34:19] other
[1:34:21] one we know what those three things were
[1:34:23] word that he talked about let's read it
[1:34:26] for you paragraph 100 100 I'm speaking
[1:34:29] of how it can get away when you get to
[1:34:32] mixing up with the world the church and
[1:34:34] all the Fashions and things that we have
[1:34:36] were no more like the original Pentecost
[1:34:38] was than days from night we've drifted
[1:34:41] off somewhere into some dark chaos
[1:34:44] somewhere and lost what a sacred trust
[1:34:47] what a responsibility to a woman now she
[1:34:51] why she's a type of the church which has
[1:34:53] the same responsibility a woman has a
[1:34:56] sacred responsibility to Motherhood to
[1:34:59] her virtues to her husband the church
[1:35:02] has a sacred responsibility to what
[1:35:05] prayer and to what the word and to
[1:35:10] Christ just the same as a woman has amen
[1:35:15] so let me read those three sacred things
[1:35:18] we go back up to paragraph number 90
[1:35:26] 87 notice she has a sacred Trust of
[1:35:29] virtue that's been given her trusted to
[1:35:32] her by the Lord God gave her that
[1:35:35] virtue she has a sacred trust to
[1:35:37] Womanhood committed to her that she must
[1:35:40] not break the woman I'm speaking of is
[1:35:43] here is her conduct and her character am
[1:35:46] around men and then he goes on he says
[1:35:49] she has a sacred trust to Motherhood so
[1:35:53] there's a a s a sacred trust to her
[1:35:56] virtue a sacred trust to Womanhood a
[1:36:00] sacred trust to Motherhood can I get a
[1:36:03] witness look what he says in paragraph
[1:36:05] 88 he says look on these screens and see
[1:36:08] these movie stars kissing and hugging
[1:36:11] and slopping around over these women
[1:36:15] woman does that is of a bad character
[1:36:17] she might be virtuous otherwise but see
[1:36:20] in her heart when those glands sex
[1:36:23] glands are in the lips the man kisses a
[1:36:25] woman he's actually potentially
[1:36:28] committed
[1:36:29] adultery sex glands are in the woman's
[1:36:32] lips and in the man's lips he can kiss
[1:36:36] her her on the hand it wouldn't mix
[1:36:38] through her sex gland but the sex glands
[1:36:41] is in the lips how many denominations
[1:36:45] preach in that one that kissing is
[1:36:48] potentially adultery and you young
[1:36:51] people that are in public school you
[1:36:53] know your friends that kiss and they
[1:36:55] kiss around and slopping and kissing
[1:36:57] around don't get involved in that that's
[1:37:00] so if it's of a bad character for
[1:37:03] someone to do that wouldn't it be of a
[1:37:05] bad character for me to sit down and
[1:37:07] look at it and be entertained by
[1:37:13] it talking about a love story if they
[1:37:16] ain't married they don't need to be
[1:37:18] kissing a movie it's just a movie and
[1:37:21] you're watching it and you're being
[1:37:22] entertained by
[1:37:27] by
[1:37:28] and is it Thanksgiving or
[1:37:32] what but you know this is the age that
[1:37:34] we're in if be kissing and slapping
[1:37:37] around holding hands how many you
[1:37:40] worldly people had a boyfriend or
[1:37:41] girlfriend when you was like six years
[1:37:43] old like what you doing with a
[1:37:47] boyfriend what you talking about a
[1:37:49] girlfriend you talking about in love

[1:38:09] what what you going to
[1:38:13] do you're going to do
[1:38:16] nothing we was out on the schoolyard one
[1:38:18] time and try to get those clovers she
[1:38:21] loves me she loves me not
[1:38:24] she loves me she loves me not so you got
[1:38:26] to get one that has three cuz you want
[1:38:28] to leave it on she loves me how many
[1:38:31] know what I'm talking about how many
[1:38:33] don't know what I'm talking about yeah
[1:38:36] foolishness the nonsense you saw in some
[1:38:39] love story or some movie or something
[1:38:41] and you're just a little pup talking
[1:38:43] about you in love you have a boyfriend
[1:38:44] or a girlfriend I wonder if he loves me
[1:38:47] or likes me did you read your
[1:38:49] Bible please Saints young people don't
[1:38:52] get caught in that Spirit now I've dealt
[1:38:55] with it we all deal with it it's a
[1:38:57] normal thing but my warning to you is
[1:38:59] don't get involved in that you see them
[1:39:01] kids out there doing that on the
[1:39:03] schoolyard they doing that
[1:39:07] plus don't get involved in that my dear
[1:39:10] young people we love you so much amen so
[1:39:14] this is a sacred trust that we have to
[1:39:18] to to the word to Christ and to prayer
[1:39:23] now
[1:39:24] he brings that sacred trust to the
[1:39:26] church and then he goes deeper and
[1:39:30] brings out a great prophecy we've
[1:39:32] brought it out many times and it's found
[1:39:33] in Luke chapter 23 let's turn there
[1:39:37] quickly and this is Jesus speaking of
[1:39:40] the day when they wouldn't want to have
[1:39:43] children
[1:39:44] anymore Luke
[1:39:48] 23 now you have to keep this in mind
[1:39:53] that he's talking about the church and
[1:39:56] when he's talking about the church he's
[1:39:58] talking about men and women he's talking
[1:40:01] about a spiritual
[1:40:03] condition
[1:40:04] amen Luke chapter
[1:40:09] 23 in verse number 27 and
[1:40:14] behold there followed him and there
[1:40:17] followed him a great company of people
[1:40:19] and of women which also bewailed and
[1:40:21] lamented him but Jesus turning unto them
[1:40:25] and said Daughters of Jerusalem weep not
[1:40:28] for me but weep for yourselves and for
[1:40:32] your
[1:40:34] children for behold the days are coming
[1:40:38] they're coming see the prophecy there
[1:40:40] he's talking about it's coming the
[1:40:44] future in the which they shall say
[1:40:47] blessed are the barren blessed are the
[1:40:50] wombs that never bear and the PS which
[1:40:53] never gave suck then shall they begin to
[1:40:56] say to the mountains fall on us and to
[1:40:59] the hills cover us the
[1:41:03] disrespect that they have for human life
[1:41:07] today and all of the
[1:41:09] abortion and all of the sexual
[1:41:12] intuitions for the young kids all the
[1:41:15] way up to the
[1:41:17] animals everything is
[1:41:19] sexualized it's a
[1:41:21] disrespect to that that channel that God
[1:41:25] brought to bring human life in it's a
[1:41:28] game now it's it's become entertainment
[1:41:32] to look at something like that so that
[1:41:34] you can your fantasy can be wild or
[1:41:37] whatever it is it's
[1:41:40] disrespectful it's the highest form of
[1:41:42] disrespect this the the the adultery
[1:41:45] it's a it we're living in an an
[1:41:48] adulterous
[1:41:50] generation it's not just the act of
[1:41:52] adult adultery is the laws are
[1:41:56] adulterous the people have adulterous
[1:41:59] Minds The filmmakers the movie makers
[1:42:03] it's surrounded and centered around
[1:42:07] adultery and Jesus said behold the days
[1:42:11] are coming when they will say blessed
[1:42:14] are the girls that don't have
[1:42:19] babies the wombs that don't bear the
[1:42:22] breast that don't give suck now now he's
[1:42:25] not just talking about women the natural
[1:42:27] he's talking about the
[1:42:29] church where they'll practice birth
[1:42:31] control we know the we know the quotes
[1:42:35] they'll practice birth control in the
[1:42:37] church now they want the sensation of
[1:42:40] being a Christian they want the
[1:42:42] camaraderie and the social aspect of
[1:42:44] being a Christian but when there's a
[1:42:46] soul at the altar that needs to be born
[1:42:50] again we don't have time for that our
[1:42:54] hamburger lunch is too important for us
[1:42:57] to have time for our soul to be bored at
[1:43:02] the
[1:43:02] altar God have mercy on us when a church
[1:43:06] loses that burden when a pastor loses
[1:43:11] that burden for souls to be born yes sir
[1:43:15] then he need to go sit down and let his
[1:43:17] ministry
[1:43:18] go
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] amen come on I want to see a soul be
[1:43:25] born again I want to see a birth take
[1:43:28] place
[1:43:30] amen that's what a Believer wants that's
[1:43:33] what a Christian wants that's what the
[1:43:35] Church of the Living God
[1:43:37] wants a
[1:43:40] birth
[1:43:45] amen I want it to birth in me yes sir I
[1:43:49] want a move of God on
[1:43:50] me yes I want to move of God in Me In
[1:43:56] you in all of us amen and so this is
[1:44:00] prophetic are the church have the
[1:44:02] churches gotten that way yes go visit
[1:44:06] around you'll see what's more
[1:44:10] important the building
[1:44:12] program how many people they got their
[1:44:16] music program who's the most famous
[1:44:19] preacher I I had to ask the Lord to help
[1:44:22] me and forgive me
[1:44:23] you know I just we had those beautiful
[1:44:26] meetings
[1:44:28] wonderful but the stress of the time of
[1:44:30] the service how they were long I didn't
[1:44:33] even have an altar
[1:44:38] call God have mercy on
[1:44:41] me that I would close a service down
[1:44:45] because somebody thinks the service is
[1:44:47] too long and not open up the altar
[1:44:54] yes thank the Lord for the meetings yes
[1:44:57] I thank God for them but I didn't have
[1:44:59] an altar call we had one sinner come to
[1:45:01] the
[1:45:02] altar but the pressure of
[1:45:05] time people getting up people looking at
[1:45:07] their watch people stressy antsy it's
[1:45:10] after 12 it's after 12:30 what we here
[1:45:13] for any where are you going
[1:45:16] anyways God have mercy on us that's not
[1:45:19] a rebuke to you I'm rebuking myself all
[1:45:21] right
[1:45:24] yes make it time for The
[1:45:27] Altar for those souls to come so they
[1:45:30] can be born
[1:45:32] again God help us all right excuse me so
[1:45:36] I've repented y'all forgive me I'm try
[1:45:40] not to do that again y'all got to leave
[1:45:42] leave but if we didn't have an altar
[1:45:44] call we'll open it up people need to
[1:45:47] pray they need to pray remember that
[1:45:49] after the service one service for the
[1:45:51] John remember how the worship came now
[1:45:53] the Holy Spirit came down so nice but
[1:45:56] the food was
[1:45:59] ready got to go
[1:46:03] eat
[1:46:06] amen my I was trying to be nice this
[1:46:08] morning Thanksgiving no it's true I was
[1:46:11] trying to just but you know we come here
[1:46:15] to worship and then finally at the end
[1:46:16] of the service the anointing comes and
[1:46:18] then we got to get out of
[1:46:20] here you sometimes you got to go you got
[1:46:22] to go but every time you know you want
[1:46:25] to be open for the Holy Spirit to bless
[1:46:28] you he might want you to stay a little
[1:46:31] longer all right every service isn't
[1:46:33] that way I'm just saying that if that
[1:46:34] service is there we should be sensitive
[1:46:37] to that amen that's right cuz the day
[1:46:40] will come when they will say blessed are
[1:46:43] the
[1:46:44] wounds that never
[1:46:46] bear and the PS that never gave such so
[1:46:52] he brings in the sacred trust he brings
[1:46:54] us in Luke 23:27 can we read what the
[1:46:57] prophet of God says about
[1:47:05] that excuse
[1:47:07] me paragraph
[1:47:14] 119 read this many times but it's a
[1:47:16] spirit it's prophetic it's it's
[1:47:18] prophetic to the churches here in Tucson
[1:47:21] that the churches in whatever City your
[1:47:23] churches in today I want you to notice
[1:47:24] Jesus spoke of it also if you like to
[1:47:27] read it Jesus made mention of this thing
[1:47:30] would come to pass did you know that in
[1:47:33] the last
[1:47:35] hours just before it
[1:47:40] crucifixion Luke
[1:47:49] 23 today it's a disgrace for her to have
[1:47:52] a child child see then they shall say
[1:47:55] and begin to say to the mountains follow
[1:47:57] us follow on us and the hills cover us
[1:48:00] for if they do these things in a green
[1:48:02] tree what shall they do in a dry
[1:48:05] speaking of the day when women wouldn't
[1:48:08] no more want children they want a dog or
[1:48:11] a cat or something like that
[1:48:23] but she don't want children anymore why
[1:48:25] she's oh mother hubard if she has a
[1:48:29] child see she don't want that's the
[1:48:31] remarks of Hollywood it don't want this
[1:48:34] woman to be an old mother Hubbert so
[1:48:36] she'll have some operation performed to
[1:48:39] himself or her one that will keep them
[1:48:43] from having children they don't want no
[1:48:45] children Jesus spoke of it and what did
[1:48:48] he say at that time they'll begin to cry
[1:48:51] for The Rock and the mountains to fall
[1:48:54] on us she'll practice birth control so
[1:48:57] she can go to parties she can't be
[1:49:00] bothered with the baby nursing her it'll
[1:49:02] disform her when she's pregnated it'll
[1:49:06] disform her she won't look like she used
[1:49:08] to her husband ignorant enough to let
[1:49:12] her go that way she won't give him a
[1:49:14] Child Jesus spoke of it and he said that
[1:49:17] when they were doing this at that time
[1:49:19] they'll go to crying then for the rocks
[1:49:22] to fall fall on them it's coming of the
[1:49:25] Lord they pay great sums of money for
[1:49:28] cats dogs to mother that's right she
[1:49:32] must mother something because it's a
[1:49:35] god-given nature to
[1:49:37] her he goes
[1:49:38] on and he talks about
[1:49:41] how a woman it's in her nature to Mother
[1:49:45] something he talks about how the church
[1:49:47] is bringing forth members it's in our
[1:49:49] our nature to do that but you don't we
[1:49:52] don't want the kind that the word will
[1:49:53] produce we want the kind that's socially
[1:49:57] uh adaptable to the people's
[1:50:00] taste a thinking man's filter he BR that
[1:50:03] message that you you there's a desire
[1:50:05] that you sucking on a desire so you'll
[1:50:08] find the church that fits that desire
[1:50:11] and if it's a 30 minute sermon that's
[1:50:13] what you like that's the church you'll
[1:50:15] go to if it's the desire of a worldly
[1:50:19] person's taste but if the word prod uces
[1:50:23] a child it'll be just like all the other
[1:50:26] children that were born acts
[1:50:29] 238
[1:50:31] youngans screaming hooping
[1:50:35] hollering it's uncomfortable to have a
[1:50:37] baby with you and go on an airplane it's
[1:50:40] uncomfortable to have a baby and you
[1:50:41] can't go to the Opera you can't go into
[1:50:44] a quiet place with a baby your lifestyle
[1:50:47] is limited that baby will embarrass you
[1:50:50] it will spit up on you it'll cry when
[1:50:53] everybody you wanted to be quiet it's a
[1:50:56] baby you was a baby too and somebody had
[1:51:00] patience with you until now you're a man
[1:51:03] now the church don't want the babies in
[1:51:06] the church no
[1:51:07] more it's too uncomfortable messes up
[1:51:10] our service it went too long all that
[1:51:13] screaming and hollering why she's
[1:51:15] dancing why he running up and down the
[1:51:17] aisles the question is why you ain't
[1:51:20] running up and down the aisles
[1:51:23] maybe that's the
[1:51:25] question dancing is a sign of what
[1:51:29] victory do you have the victory no don't
[1:51:33] tell me show
[1:51:35] me praise the
[1:51:39] Lord amen amen churches they don't want
[1:51:43] that I mean let's be honest to get out
[1:51:46] you know a nice reasonable time I want
[1:51:49] to I don't want to sit in church all day
[1:51:52] long
[1:51:57] ain't nobody helping
[1:52:02] me I got things to do like you do right
[1:52:06] got plans you got things you want to go
[1:52:08] on Wednesday night but what am I here
[1:52:10] for
[1:52:12] anyways ultimately I want the Holy Ghost
[1:52:14] to fall down in all of our services I
[1:52:18] want them to fall down every time and
[1:52:22] and Lord if you fall down in the service
[1:52:25] I will worship you I will Entertain You
[1:52:31] Lord would you make that commitment yes
[1:52:34] sir to him yes all right it's total
[1:52:39] disrespect for life they don't want the
[1:52:41] babies to be
[1:52:43] born
[1:52:45] now let me close this message up with
[1:52:48] this here these few little thoughts here
[1:52:52] as as brother brandham was several
[1:52:56] minutes into his sermon he says he he
[1:52:59] asked a congregation he says you're
[1:53:01] probably wondering what does this have
[1:53:03] to do with
[1:53:07] Thanksgiving
[1:53:08] and and he goes and he relates to us in
[1:53:12] other messages that Thanksgiving is the
[1:53:15] only real American holiday all the
[1:53:18] others were catholic but you know what
[1:53:21] they have they have a day for every day
[1:53:23] of the year now they have Secretaries
[1:53:26] Day they have days for different like
[1:53:30] donuts the national whatever day they
[1:53:32] got a day for every day you want to
[1:53:34] think of that people want to celebrate
[1:53:36] but the only real uh American holiday
[1:53:39] which was founded upon being
[1:53:43] thankful is
[1:53:46] Thanksgiving the giving of thanks to the
[1:53:50] Lord how many of of us are thankful for
[1:53:55] the
[1:53:56] Lord there is nothing we have we have no
[1:54:01] complaints brother George all we have
[1:54:05] brother Zach is a heart of
[1:54:08] thanks I am
[1:54:10] overwhelmed with the goodness of God
[1:54:14] that he's been so good to me when I
[1:54:18] don't deserve it he's still been so good
[1:54:23] so kind so longsuffering and
[1:54:27] merciful His blessings overtake me I
[1:54:30] can't count them they're
[1:54:32] innumerable the song says count your
[1:54:35] blessings name them one by one you can't
[1:54:40] count all the blessings and this is the
[1:54:42] day of Thanksgiving and so what he
[1:54:46] does what the prophet does is he ties in
[1:54:49] the pilgrim fathers
[1:54:53] to the seven seal
[1:54:56] message oh my how how what is the
[1:55:01] pilgrim fathers coming over with that
[1:55:04] first original Thanksgiving have to do
[1:55:07] with the seven seal let's share it with
[1:55:09] you just now all
[1:55:11] right because they're
[1:55:14] related is that right when when you
[1:55:19] respect the
[1:55:20] truth God will reveal more truth to
[1:55:24] you see there's an attitude that we have
[1:55:27] to have towards God's word and we want
[1:55:30] God to reveal more to us but we're
[1:55:32] disrespectful to the little things that
[1:55:34] he's given to us but if you thank God
[1:55:36] for the little bit that he's given you
[1:55:38] he's got more to give you more of his
[1:55:42] truth more of his
[1:55:44] word here where brother Ram says in the
[1:55:47] message um it's in the church ages
[1:55:56] the Philadelphia Church age and he says
[1:55:58] this here he's talking about Peter
[1:56:00] paragraph
[1:56:04] 180 he was the Lord when he was born he
[1:56:08] was Christ the lord then when he
[1:56:10] received his name of Jesus that made him
[1:56:13] Jesus Christ the Lord that's exactly
[1:56:15] what was revealed to Peter he knowed who
[1:56:18] John and Mary was when he said go
[1:56:20] baptize in the name of the father Son
[1:56:22] and the Holy Ghost so it could be
[1:56:25] revealed because Jesus know that Peter
[1:56:28] had the gift of
[1:56:31] Revelations he know because it had
[1:56:33] already been revealed to him by the
[1:56:37] spirit above and when God sees that
[1:56:41] man can receive Revelations from
[1:56:45] above he can trust that man to do
[1:56:48] something with him okay when it's
[1:56:51] revealed to him because he says no man
[1:56:53] can reveal this but his father God is
[1:56:56] the only one who can reveal it and he
[1:56:59] know Peter was in contact with the
[1:57:02] spirit
[1:57:03] so when God can see that Peter can
[1:57:06] accept Revelation then God can do
[1:57:09] something with him this is the same
[1:57:11] thing that we've been bringing to you
[1:57:13] that you know reading quotes or putting
[1:57:15] scriptures out there of our behaviors
[1:57:18] and things doesn't change anyone it only
[1:57:21] makes you aware of what the truth is but
[1:57:24] the Revelation has to drop in you and
[1:57:27] that's what we pray for Lord you said it
[1:57:29] in your word there's a quotation right
[1:57:31] there but I'm not living it just yet I'm
[1:57:34] not feeling it just yet but give me a
[1:57:37] revelation of it Lord make it one with
[1:57:40] me and when God sees that a man can
[1:57:43] receive Revelation now he can do
[1:57:46] something with that man this is what he
[1:57:48] did with Peter wasn't even converted yet
[1:57:52] but he had to gift the
[1:57:54] revelations and so the prophet goes
[1:57:56] forward and says this in the invisible
[1:58:05] Union paragraph
[1:58:08] 192 I'm going to close here
[1:58:13] okay who said take your time I had two
[1:58:15] people I need a third Chuck said it I
[1:58:18] said who else said that Miguel can I
[1:58:21] take my time who else who said
[1:58:25] that who said don't take your
[1:58:28] time nobody all right God bless
[1:58:31] you you all are a very smart
[1:58:39] crowd the prophet of God says this here
[1:58:42] God bless you Saints God bless you
[1:58:44] paragraph 192 he says you may say what's
[1:58:48] this all got to do with Thanksgiving
[1:58:50] what you talking about brother brandom
[1:58:52] here it is a quarter and a nine you
[1:58:53] didn't say nothing about Thanksgiving
[1:58:56] what a message for the occasion to me
[1:58:59] yes indeed the pilgrim fathers were very
[1:59:03] thankful for their new found way of life
[1:59:07] being separated from the old English
[1:59:09] denominations and Creed they could marry
[1:59:13] to the new anointed word for their age
[1:59:18] that's right the new anointed word of
[1:59:21] their age age for their day so can we be
[1:59:26] thankful as pilgrims like Abraham
[1:59:30] separated ourselves from the things of
[1:59:33] the world all of our Associates Abraham
[1:59:36] was a pilgrim God has separated us from
[1:59:40] all the dead religions I'm speaking
[1:59:43] Across the Nation now all the dead
[1:59:46] Creeds and to what separated us and open
[1:59:50] to us a new land a new message for this
[1:59:56] day what did it do paragraph 196 what
[1:59:59] did it do he opened up the Seven Seals
[2:00:03] of the last message you know that notice
[2:00:06] that the Seven Seals which all the
[2:00:09] mysteries of the seven Church Ages was
[2:00:12] sealed with Seven Seals the reformers
[2:00:15] didn't have time to do it in their days
[2:00:16] they didn't live long enough but this
[2:00:18] blessed revelation of the seven seal
[2:00:22] is open to us in the last days from a
[2:00:26] prophecy that went forth to
[2:00:31] Arizona
[2:00:33] amen how many's thankful to be married
[2:00:37] what you married to said brother isra
[2:00:39] I'm single no you're not there's no
[2:00:42] single Believers here what you married
[2:00:45] to the new anointed word because of the
[2:00:49] Seven
[2:00:50] Seals that is a Thanksgiving Day what a
[2:00:55] golden day for Thanksgiving you know
[2:00:57] when brother Brandon preached this
[2:00:58] message he says this may be our last
[2:01:01] Thanksgiving and for him it
[2:01:04] was he said we might not meet like this
[2:01:07] again and for him that was absolutely
[2:01:09] the truth right but did he leave a
[2:01:12] message of Thanksgiving for us
[2:01:15] Thanksgiving during Christmas time
[2:01:17] during Easter time during every day of
[2:01:20] my life a golden age of
[2:01:25] Thanksgiving for a new land a new land a
