[30:14] &gt;&gt; And Father, we look to you tonight,
[30:17] oh God, to minister to our hearts once
[30:20] again, Lord, give us what we have need
[30:23] of is our prayer. As we stand here
[30:26] tonight, Lord, we ask you to forgive us
[30:30] of all of our sins, our shortcomings,
[30:33] our unbelief, Lord. Lord, let us come
[30:37] into your presence, the presence of your
[30:39] word, and to hear from you is our
[30:43] prayer. We commit ourselves to you this
[30:46] evening. We love you, Lord. We thank
[30:48] you. Ask your blessings now in Jesus'
[30:51] name. Amen. Amen. God bless each of you.
[30:56] Welcome to the house of the Lord. Good
[30:58] to see each of you. Billy, William, good
[31:00] to see you. Praise the Lord. Each of
[31:03] you, we like to go right into our
[31:06] scripture just uh for tonight. um while
[31:11] we have you standing.
[31:14] So happy to have you here tonight in um
[31:18] we'll take
[31:20] the scripture in Hebrews
[31:24] chapter
[31:25] number 12.
[31:53] in verse number five.
[31:59] We've been talking about training and um
[32:02] the orders of adoption and um
[32:08] uh moving forward into the new
[32:11] land that we're coming to the millennium
[32:14] and our reign with Christ and how he has
[32:17] to reign with us here in our heart so
[32:20] that we can reign with him over there
[32:23] and that everything we're doing and
[32:26] we're going through right now is the
[32:28] training mean that we're all in the
[32:30] training ground. Everybody is being
[32:33] tested.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And verse number five says, "And
[32:37] ye have forgotten the exhortation which
[32:40] Moses speaketh unto you, as unto
[32:43] children, my son, despise not thou the
[32:47] chastening of the Lord, nor faint when
[32:50] thou art rebuked of him." For whom the
[32:53] Lord loveth, he what does he do?
[32:56] chasteneth and scourgeeth every son whom
[33:00] he receiveth.
[33:02] If you endure chastening, God dealeth
[33:05] with you as with sons. For what son is
[33:10] he whom the father chasteneth not? But
[33:13] if you be without chastisement whereof
[33:16] all are partakers, then are you bastards
[33:19] and not sons?
[33:21] Furthermore,
[33:22] we have had fathers of our flesh which
[33:25] corrected us. We gave them reverence.
[33:28] Shall we not much rather be in
[33:32] subjection unto the father of spirits
[33:35] and live? For they verily for a few days
[33:38] chasen us after their own pleasure, but
[33:42] he for our what? our prophet that we
[33:48] might be partakers of his holiness.
[33:53] Let's read verse 11 alto together. Now
[33:56] no chastening for the present seemth to
[33:59] be joyous but grievious. Nevertheless,
[34:04] afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable
[34:06] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[34:10] are exercised
[34:12] thereby.
[34:14] Amen. One more Old Testament scripture.
[34:18] Genesis 14 verse number 14. And Abraham
[34:23] and Abraham heard that his brother was
[34:27] taken captive. He armed his trained
[34:30] servants born in his own house. 318
[34:35] and pursued them unto Dan. I like the
[34:40] that those train those servants were
[34:42] trained. He armed his trained servants
[34:46] born in his own house. And that's what
[34:47] we're going to talk about for a few
[34:49] minutes. If we give it a title, we'll
[34:52] title it the training of men. The
[34:55] training of men. God bless you. May God
[34:57] bless the reading of his word.
[35:02] Excuse me. You may be seated.
[35:05] Now,
[35:07] we are all being trained right now. How
[35:11] many can say amen to that? Trained for a
[35:14] great battle, a great contest.
[35:17] I don't know how it came up, but I was
[35:20] started to read when Pearl Harbor had
[35:23] struck the US here
[35:26] um on the Second World War, the
[35:29] beginning of it there,
[35:31] and
[35:33] how our armies were not prepared.
[35:39] And it was a great I mean it caught us
[35:43] off guard
[35:45] and our planes our ships right there in
[35:48] uh on the coast there of Hawaii
[35:52] were um terribly attacked and damaged
[35:57] and we're a great nation and they were
[35:59] starting to work through some of the
[36:02] details on how and why I believe those
[36:05] generals that were in the Navy were were
[36:08] fired. they lost their job because of
[36:11] their lack of preparedness.
[36:14] And then I thought of this last um
[36:17] attack on the president when
[36:21] um they almost got him. They shot him
[36:24] and he turned his head a little bit and
[36:27] and that wasn't a game. That wasn't a
[36:29] for show. That wasn't for views. They
[36:32] almost took his head off.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; They almost got him. And it was then
[36:36] that our Secret Service came into view.
[36:39] And as we said, we don't really I mean,
[36:42] if we're talking about the Secret
[36:44] Service, that means somebody did
[36:45] something bad
[36:48] &gt;&gt; because we never talk about the Secret
[36:50] Service
[36:51] because they've done such a great job in
[36:54] protecting,
[36:56] which is as we spoke here some time ago
[36:59] on our immune system, how our immune
[37:02] system does a pretty good job. Those of
[37:05] you that are healthy, it's not because
[37:08] of your own. It's because God made your
[37:10] body to fight off germs and diseases.
[37:14] Germs and diseases that you probably
[37:15] don't even know the name of. And they're
[37:18] in every single public place or even at
[37:21] your home. Germs, diseases all over the
[37:24] place. But God put in your body an
[37:27] immune system that fights it off.
[37:30] And God has given his church the
[37:33] greatest weaponry to fight off any
[37:35] demon, devil, evil.
[37:38] Um so that the church, the believer is
[37:41] not caught off guard.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; And one of those defense me uh uh that
[37:46] defenses that he puts in there is
[37:50] forsake not the assembling of yourself
[37:53] together.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; It's a simple one.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; It's a long whole. It's an old one, too,
[38:00] but it it is so true.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; How many times has God spoke to you in
[38:07] the presence in an oldfashioned Sunday
[38:10] morning service, not regular meeting,
[38:13] special meeting, or even even a prayer
[38:16] meeting? How many times has he come
[38:18] down?
[38:19] &gt;&gt; And he made a promise that he would be
[38:21] with us when we come together. And so he
[38:25] is actually training us and equipping
[38:28] us. We do not come to church to see
[38:32] other people.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church to be seen
[38:39] &gt;&gt; by other people.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? Can everybody
[38:43] say how many how many didn't hear that?
[38:45] How how many know that's a reality? We
[38:48] actually do not come to church to be
[38:51] seeing other people.
[38:54] There's no scripture for that. Go to
[38:56] church to go see someone else.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Or to be seen of other people,
[39:02] &gt;&gt; but he said when we come together, he
[39:04] said he promised he would be in our
[39:05] midst.
[39:07] And so on this trip to Colombia was a
[39:10] real blessing to me. As I went to all of
[39:14] the services,
[39:15] uh, my wife there and I and at the end
[39:18] there, they they had these little
[39:21] plaques that they give out for
[39:22] appreciation. And they gave me a a
[39:24] plaque for being a part of the meetings.
[39:27] Maybe on Sunday I I can bring it to you
[39:30] uh, and share that with you. This Sunday
[39:32] morning, Brother George Smith will be
[39:34] with us. I'll just announce that. He was
[39:36] already planning to come anyways. And so
[39:39] if I have a chance, I'll share a little
[39:41] bit more. But um I was just really taken
[39:45] back in their organization and the way
[39:47] they had things taken care of and the
[39:49] way things were done. And one of the um
[39:53] services, they asked all the ministers
[39:56] from the country that had been affected
[39:58] by brother Fabio's ministry to come
[40:01] forward. and it lined up I forget there
[40:04] was a few hundred ministers, pastors,
[40:07] teachers from the country all across the
[40:10] platform there. You know he's 80 years
[40:13] old. He he he's 50 years in the ministry
[40:17] and um he has followed this example out
[40:21] of the message taking sides with Jesus.
[40:26] And I know of some of the other
[40:28] churches, there's church groups around
[40:29] the message that use this um what they
[40:32] call an apostolic ministry where you
[40:36] have one pastor, he's an apos, he's an
[40:38] apostle, and he establishes other
[40:41] churches, sets them up, gets them going,
[40:44] and then they repeat and continue it on.
[40:47] Well, they get this
[40:51] uh uh this understanding. They get it
[40:54] from the message taking sides with
[40:57] Jesus. How many's heard that tape
[40:59] before?
[41:00] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll take a portion of it
[41:02] here tonight. We'll read from it. Well,
[41:04] in that message, taking sides with
[41:07] Jesus, Brother Brandham actually tells
[41:11] the ministry and the men in there
[41:16] to
[41:18] train
[41:20] young men
[41:22] that you see a call of God in their
[41:24] life. And he said that maybe you should
[41:28] set up an elder like brother Neville
[41:32] that would be like the leader among you
[41:34] and then the other churches come
[41:36] together and talk the deeper things of
[41:39] the scripture ministers and um and the
[41:44] like and it's a beautiful setup and
[41:47] brother Bandham says that's the way they
[41:49] did it in the book of acts he says so
[41:52] why don't we do it today this is 1962
[41:55] too. And we don't see this format laid
[41:59] out very very well in many places
[42:05] because
[42:06] well there's probably several reasons
[42:09] for that. Um it it's almost the sense of
[42:15] when a person comes to Christ, they come
[42:17] to church and then they're sometimes
[42:21] left to figure it out on their own or we
[42:25] assume
[42:27] they understand what the next steps are.
[42:31] For example, the la the little sister
[42:32] that stood up and spoke in the service
[42:35] last Wednesday, remember her? She's not
[42:37] here, so I could talk about her. Um.
[42:43] Huh.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; God bless her.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; God bless her. Thank you. God bless all
[42:47] of us actually.
[42:49] And um she was not aware. Totally not
[42:54] aware. Had no clue. And after the
[42:56] service, I talked to Brother Joe and I
[42:57] says, "Maybe you can have your wife meet
[42:59] her and talk with her." Well, he didn't
[43:01] even have to do that. The next service,
[43:02] she came back. I didn't know I was
[43:04] supposed to get up and stand up in
[43:06] service and talk like that. It's just
[43:09] the way it went. Okay. And so sometimes
[43:12] we assume that people are learning or
[43:16] they're understanding.
[43:18] And many of us if if I told you you
[43:22] needed to be taught or someone to train
[43:24] you into something, many men get
[43:28] resentful of that.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; But I want you to take this tape in your
[43:32] own time and don't just floss over it
[43:34] because I mentioned it here. And don't
[43:37] let me play the tape for you to get it
[43:39] for yourself. That message, taking sides
[43:43] with Jesus,
[43:45] 1962,
[43:48] June the 1. The first, it's the whole
[43:51] message is good, but the first half he's
[43:52] dealing with ministers. And he sets up
[43:55] in order how young men need to be
[43:58] trained.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. And old ones, too.
[44:04] They need to be taught. There needs to
[44:09] be a training because
[44:12] we are facing the greatest battle ever
[44:16] fought.
[44:17] And when we come to the house of the
[44:19] Lord, the scriptures are given to us so
[44:22] that the man of God can be thoroughly
[44:28] furnished
[44:30] in the word of God. that the weapons of
[44:33] our warfare, they're not carnal.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; And you know, it's quite uh amazing how
[44:40] our Lord Jesus, he's the God of glory.
[44:43] He comes in the office of a baby and as
[44:47] 12 years old, as a teenager, he was
[44:50] subject to his parents.
[44:54] He was obedient
[44:57] to his parents and he is actually the
[45:00] Lord and God of glory showing us the
[45:04] example
[45:06] that as he was subject that we to
[45:12] every one of us here has to be subject
[45:14] to somebody. Sure.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Every one of us
[45:19] &gt;&gt; and every one of us here has to be
[45:21] tested and trained and taught
[45:26] and ultimately it's the Holy Spirit that
[45:30] does the teaching and the training.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] And he uses men, he uses his word, he
[45:42] uses examples.
[45:44] And um
[45:46] brother Bam takes the scripture that we
[45:48] read in Hebrews 12 and he uses this
[45:51] terminology. He calls it child training.
[45:56] That we all need child training.
[46:01] We don't know it all.
[46:05] We've seen it where, you know, we've
[46:07] seen it where, you know, um this
[46:10] training um even
[46:14] even
[46:16] um
[46:18] the the scripture tells us don't don't
[46:20] be discouraged when he's training you.
[46:23] Don't don't get don't get offended when
[46:25] he's training you because he's trying to
[46:28] bring out the best in you.
[46:32] um we look at the circumstance or we
[46:35] look past it
[46:37] and really God allows it
[46:41] to bring something out in you.
[46:44] Can you survive
[46:48] in a hostile environment?
[46:51] Do you really need
[46:55] to be babyed in order to continue on?
[46:58] If all your friends leave you, are you
[47:00] going to quit?
[47:02] &gt;&gt; If the church turns its back on you and
[47:05] you don't get what you feel like you
[47:06] deserve, are you discouraged?
[47:09] All of these things happen. All these
[47:11] things happen in real time and they
[47:13] happen to all of us. How many's ever
[47:15] come to church and been disappointed?
[47:17] &gt;&gt; How many's ever been disappointed by
[47:19] Christians?
[47:21] &gt;&gt; How many's ever been disappointed by
[47:23] people you were hoping they would never
[47:26] disappoint you? But God allows that
[47:29] &gt;&gt; and our attitude and our atmosphere and
[47:32] the way we take that is part of the
[47:34] training.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me
[47:39] &gt;&gt; to be trained to be a soldier
[47:42] &gt;&gt; that can handle any environment you put
[47:45] me in.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Not just the blessed Holy Spirit falling
[47:50] environments,
[47:51] &gt;&gt; but I'm talking about the hostile ones.
[47:54] I'm talking about the harsh
[47:56] environments, the environments where
[47:58] little water is,
[48:00] &gt;&gt; but there's no encouragement.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; The environment where um it's just hard
[48:06] to survive in.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a soldier.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Like one of these cactus out here in the
[48:12] summertime. They're just out there just
[48:15] like
[48:17] just standing. And they were made for
[48:20] that environment.
[48:23] You take a plant from the north, he
[48:24] couldn't handle it.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; You take a little baby plant that looks
[48:27] so cute inside the house, you put him
[48:30] outside, he can't handle it. And but the
[48:33] Lord is building and making and he's
[48:35] training men. Now, Brother Random tells
[48:37] us in the message Job, he says this in
[48:39] paragraph 29 says, "Moses looked over
[48:42] the lamb. He said, "Take a lamb, every
[48:43] one of you, for the house. It must be
[48:46] first put up and tried." Listen, you new
[48:50] converts. Now we thank God for many
[48:53] every night. And look, first thing comes
[48:56] along is a trial.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; As soon as you come to Christ,
[49:02] something's going to happen.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Every son that cometh to God must first
[49:08] be tried,
[49:10] scouraged, whipped a little. But a few
[49:14] things happen to really try you out.
[49:18] Child training that's what it is. You
[49:21] believe in scriptural child
[49:24] training. The Bible speaks of training a
[49:27] child with tutors and so forth. Bringing
[49:30] him up, straightening him out, giving
[49:33] him what he belongs.
[49:36] That's what's the matter tonight.
[49:37] Preachers, preachers has let the
[49:40] congregation get by with anything. They
[49:43] need a little child training. That's
[49:45] right. That's what's the matter with the
[49:47] world today. The reason they got so much
[49:49] in the natural juvenile delinquency, we
[49:52] need some child training. I think it's a
[49:56] lot of parent delinquency.
[50:00] Paragraph 45,
[50:02] excuse me, in the message fellowship. I
[50:04] think it's the message fellowship. I
[50:06] think the sweetest scripture there is in
[50:08] the Bible is this scripture. Father, I
[50:11] sanctify myself because of them. He was
[50:14] a man. He could have had a wife. He was
[50:17] a man. He could have had a home, a place
[50:19] to lay his head. He had his rights to
[50:23] that. He was a man. He could have had
[50:26] good clothes. He was a man. But what did
[50:28] he say? Father, sanctify myself for
[50:33] their sake.
[50:36] What was he doing? He was training up 12
[50:40] disciples that were going to preach the
[50:43] gospel in all the world. He put an
[50:46] example. And brethren, as ministers, I
[50:50] tell you, it pays us not to get too much
[50:53] of the world's goods and things hanging
[50:55] around us.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You preachers I'm talking to, sanctify
[51:00] yourself for them that you're going to
[51:04] lead. That's what we need today is a
[51:06] complete consecrated sanctified life of
[51:10] ministers that walk upright before God
[51:13] does not entangle with the things of the
[51:16] world. Keep away from it. Father, I
[51:18] sanctify myself for their sake.
[51:21] Not because he had to do it, but he did
[51:24] it for their sake. So he said he was
[51:28] training
[51:29] 12 disciples. That's what he was doing.
[51:34] The prophet continues, "Belief from the
[51:37] heart." I think it's the tape. Every son
[51:39] tested
[51:41] would be sure that everything was tested
[51:44] perfectly before he put it in the bridge
[51:47] because of his character. I think
[51:49] brother Adam was talking about that that
[51:51] man that built the bridge uh in Sydney,
[51:54] Australia there. And because of his
[51:56] name, how much more
[51:59] how much more did our blessed heavenly
[52:01] father test every word that was ever
[52:04] said or wrote in the Bible? He tested
[52:09] every word, every prophet, and every son
[52:14] that cometh to God must be tested. The
[52:19] material that goes in this great
[52:21] highway, every rock, every material
[52:25] before it's placed into the body of
[52:27] Christ has to be tried,
[52:31] chasened. Every son that come to God
[52:33] must first be tried.
[52:37] No exceptions.
[52:39] Everyone, every prophet, before he could
[52:42] write in that Bible, he was tested by
[52:46] the Holy Spirit.
[52:49] How many thank God for this word that's
[52:51] proven to be tested? And
[52:54] &gt;&gt; thank God for the Holy Spirit and all
[52:56] the prophets and the prophecies. They
[52:58] have all been tested and so do you have
[53:02] to be tested.
[53:04] If you have not been tested, you're a
[53:07] child of God. You will be tested.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 34 and Why Christ speak? The
[53:13] prophet of God says this here,
[53:16] "What the schools had put in Moses 40
[53:18] years, it taken 40 years to get it out.
[53:22] But one time in the presence of the
[53:25] anointing,
[53:27] one time in the presence of the burning
[53:29] bush, he knowed more about God than he
[53:32] had learned in the books in the 80 years
[53:35] of his life.
[53:36] God trains his men, then anoints them,
[53:42] &gt;&gt; gives them experience,
[53:45] &gt;&gt; takes them through the rigid training,
[53:48] down through the sands of burning
[53:50] punishment, trying, testing. Not only
[53:55] does he do that to his prophets, but he
[53:58] does it to his children. Every son that
[54:02] cometh to God must be chasened and
[54:05] tried,
[54:06] tested by his word. See, when the pinch
[54:10] come, the strong time, when it faces
[54:12] death, are you able to stand there on
[54:14] the word of God and say, "God said so."
[54:18] That settles it.
[54:20] So, we're being tested, saints.
[54:23] Everything you read about in the news,
[54:25] everything that's coming our way looks
[54:26] like a new situation, a new thing is
[54:30] happening. This one's getting arrested.
[54:33] This crime was committed. Now things are
[54:36] changing. Attitude, the laws are
[54:38] changing. Everything is us being tested.
[54:44] You are being put to the test, my
[54:45] brother and my sister.
[54:48] God's allowing the test over your life.
[54:52] And the test is there to prove
[54:56] um what kind of goods we are. Are we
[55:00] able to be a part of the material that
[55:03] he puts in the body of Christ?
[55:06] Can he depend on you
[55:10] to be that testimony in this late hour?
[55:15] You know, a lot of people are just
[55:16] jumping and doing their own thing,
[55:19] whether it's in the Bible or in the
[55:21] quotes or not. People are doing whatever
[55:23] they feel like doing. They feel like
[55:27] this is right. Yes, I've heard that, but
[55:29] I'm going to do my own thing anyway.
[55:31] That's all being put to the test.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Pastors are being tested. Ministers are
[55:36] being tested. any officer of the church,
[55:39] anybody that's trying to lead a home,
[55:42] any father, any mother that's trying to
[55:45] lead a home, you're being put to the
[55:47] test.
[55:49] Um, any relationship,
[55:52] any young person, young people, you are
[55:55] being tested.
[55:57] And your test, I don't know about your
[56:00] test. I don't know what kind of test
[56:02] you've been. I had my test as a young
[56:04] person. I guarantee you the test that I
[56:06] had is in what you're facing.
[56:10] Um, it was hard for me, but I can't
[56:12] imagine the test that our young people
[56:14] are being tested with. A young lady
[56:16] being tested, young men being tested,
[56:20] your time, your loyalty, as we heard
[56:24] Sunday night and the great tremendous
[56:27] things that God has poured out to us.
[56:30] Everybody is being put to the test and
[56:33] somebody is going to give out grades.
[56:38] There's a grading time
[56:40] and there is a week. What if we were to
[56:43] give an account in how we performed as a
[56:47] Christian at the end of the week? What
[56:51] if there's a pop quiz
[56:54] saying I'm about almost ready? I'm
[56:56] getting ready. No, it's not about
[56:57] getting ready. No, it's time. The test
[57:00] is on.
[57:02] Will you pass the test as a Christian?
[57:05] You know, all these spirits that are in
[57:07] the land, as brother Bannon was bringing
[57:08] in our Sunday school, that the great
[57:11] holy fire will burn out all the demons
[57:14] and devils that are in the atmosphere,
[57:18] but he hasn't burned them out yet. So,
[57:21] they're there around all of us.
[57:25] You can't go anywhere. No place is off
[57:28] limits. It's not sanctified nowhere.
[57:31] Anywhere you go, you're going to see
[57:33] something. You might have determined in
[57:36] your heart to do what was right today.
[57:38] You determined to stay on the straight
[57:40] and narrow path.
[57:42] You determined that you wouldn't fall
[57:44] into those things again. But Satan will
[57:47] send you a text message or allow someone
[57:50] to send one or email or you'll see
[57:53] something or you hear something. It'll
[57:56] come up in your feed and that thing is
[57:59] there. I'm talking about the things you
[58:01] overcome. That thing is there to come
[58:03] back and let me check one more time to
[58:07] see if she's really got the goods or if
[58:10] he's really overcome. We're all being
[58:13] tested. Is that right?
[58:16] And um God has given us his word to
[58:21] train us.
[58:23] We are being trained right now.
[58:26] This is what the services are all about.
[58:30] This is what the Holy Spirit coming down
[58:32] in the meeting is for. When the Holy
[58:36] Ghost came upon Moses in that presence,
[58:40] he learned more about God in the
[58:44] presence of the Lord than all the years,
[58:48] the 40 years of training with the
[58:50] Egyptians.
[58:51] So his presence is where he trains us.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; So we want to come into his presence,
[58:58] don't we?
[59:00] We need to come into his presence. In
[59:04] his presence, he begins to unfold things
[59:07] to us, reveal to us, make things known
[59:11] to us wisdom. And his wisdom comes, he
[59:15] unlocks little keys to things, how to
[59:18] operate, how to prepare yourself, little
[59:21] warnings and little distraction that are
[59:24] coming up the road. The Holy Spirit is
[59:26] there to equip you for the battles that
[59:29] you're going to face that you're facing
[59:31] right now.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the praise. It's in the
[59:35] worship. It's in the anointing coming
[59:37] down. It's in the preaching of the word.
[59:40] It's in his presence
[59:43] &gt;&gt; that he begins to train us.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That would be sad for me just to feel
[59:48] that presence and then walk out and
[59:51] didn't get any training.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't learn any maneuvers or tactics.
[59:57] Didn't learn how to fight better or
[59:59] strive better.
[1:00:01] that brain that word train means to
[1:00:03] teach a particular skill.
[1:00:07] It means to teach a particular skill and
[1:00:11] he's been training us. Here what the
[1:00:12] prophet of God says here in my last
[1:00:15] quote here that I have here then I want
[1:00:17] to go into taking sides with Jesus for a
[1:00:19] moment and I'm just about done here. Uh
[1:00:22] the contest 1962
[1:00:25] paragraph 12. Now, I know that's an old
[1:00:27] saying, people. There's an old saying.
[1:00:31] It's not so old either. People don't
[1:00:33] believe in demons in this day. But the
[1:00:36] thing to do, to my opinion, is know your
[1:00:38] enemy. Know your enemy and train for the
[1:00:44] contest that you're going to have when
[1:00:48] you meet him.
[1:00:51] Because you're going to meet him.
[1:00:55] Know him. know what his strength is.
[1:00:59] Then train for this contest when you do
[1:01:02] meet him. For it's one thing sure you're
[1:01:05] going to meet him. So you train for the
[1:01:09] contest. Now training for the contest is
[1:01:12] just like a boxer. His enemy that he's
[1:01:15] going to meet out there in a contest to
[1:01:17] fight. A real good fighter usually knows
[1:01:21] and studies his opponents. Let me ask
[1:01:25] you this. How many young people here do
[1:01:28] not study?
[1:01:31] I'm not ask don't answer that question.
[1:01:33] I'm just throwing that out there. How
[1:01:35] many young men, how many young ladies
[1:01:38] that are Christians that don't study the
[1:01:42] word of God?
[1:01:44] You know, that's that's a um that's a a
[1:01:47] command. That's a demand on you to study
[1:01:52] the word to show yourself approved.
[1:01:56] Study is a part of being a Christian.
[1:01:59] Picking up your Bible and reading the
[1:02:01] word of God and then meditating on it.
[1:02:04] That's a part of your arsenal as a
[1:02:07] believer. You're not just I mean you're
[1:02:09] we're soldiers here. You know, the
[1:02:10] Apostle Paul uses sports. He's talking
[1:02:13] about training and sports and then he
[1:02:15] uses the military training training in
[1:02:18] an army. I give those analogies about
[1:02:20] sports all the time and the prophet uses
[1:02:23] one about boxing because we human beings
[1:02:26] we like the contests and we like a
[1:02:28] winner and a loser. We like a prize. We
[1:02:30] want a first place, second place, third
[1:02:32] place. We like these prizes and we like
[1:02:35] to grade one another on up our
[1:02:38] achievements. How fast are you? How can
[1:02:40] you jump? Can you throw darts? Who's the
[1:02:43] best in chess? Who's the best in
[1:02:45] checkers? Who's the fastest one in here
[1:02:48] running?
[1:02:50] Well, that would be me.
[1:02:52] I'm teasing. Of course,
[1:02:57] I'm teasing.
[1:02:59] But I'm kind of serious, too. Oh, no.
[1:03:02] No. But this is what we do, my friends.
[1:03:05] We did. We little pups, young pups
[1:03:07] coming up. We want to test and wrestle
[1:03:09] and find out. And the scriptures brings
[1:03:11] out this um uh playing by the rules. If
[1:03:15] you don't play by the rules, you don't
[1:03:17] get that prize. What if you're in the
[1:03:20] army? You don't train properly. You're
[1:03:21] not you're not a soldier ready to fight.
[1:03:24] And you are we are Christians today. We
[1:03:27] don't come to church and join a group of
[1:03:31] people that's going to heaven without a
[1:03:35] fight.
[1:03:38] We are in a battle.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I'm in I'm fighting
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; against somebody. I have an enemy.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, I have an enemy. And how would I
[1:03:50] know who he is? How do I train for him?
[1:03:52] How can I get this guy off of me,
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; out of my space? He's always coming,
[1:03:58] always trying to catch me slipping.
[1:04:00] Always trying to catch me when I'm not
[1:04:03] prepared for him. It's a sneak attack.
[1:04:06] You know that Pearl Harbor was was a
[1:04:08] cold-blooded attack and when it got us
[1:04:12] it embarrassed our military.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, it did. I forgot how embarrassing
[1:04:18] that was. And we have all these
[1:04:21] characters of character of the Japanese
[1:04:25] and the jokes that the Americans would
[1:04:27] tell about them and laugh and joke and
[1:04:30] stuff. Wasn't laughing and joking when
[1:04:32] they dropped them bombs on us.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And people got up and got upset
[1:04:36] and got ready. And then after that
[1:04:39] bombing, we became stronger than we've
[1:04:43] ever become because we learned a lesson,
[1:04:45] didn't we? 911 was another surprise
[1:04:49] attack, too. Really woke up the whole
[1:04:52] and the churches were full of fool
[1:04:54] Sundays after the 911 attack. How many
[1:04:56] remember that?
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; How remember how god conscious we became
[1:05:01] as a nation? What happened to all of
[1:05:03] that?
[1:05:04] Where did that go now?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody wanted to pray. Everybody
[1:05:08] wanted God after that attack and we
[1:05:11] didn't see it coming and it coming and
[1:05:13] it it happened. And this happens to
[1:05:15] believers. This happens to ministries.
[1:05:18] It happens to people that are good
[1:05:19] people, good marriages, good homes, good
[1:05:24] men, good women fall because Satan hits
[1:05:29] them
[1:05:31] with a an attack they didn't know was
[1:05:34] coming
[1:05:36] and the oldfashioned prayer meeting has
[1:05:39] become optional.
[1:05:42] It's just a side service that I'll make
[1:05:45] it if I can.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:48] But if we knew the hour that we were
[1:05:50] living in, not only would we make it
[1:05:53] here, but we would gain the instructions
[1:05:58] necessary
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; to build me into a soldier
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; that can handle any attack of the devil.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Build me into a soldier, Lord.
[1:06:12] And we have to train. We have to study.
[1:06:17] I think that's a very good thing for
[1:06:19] Christians to do. Training for the
[1:06:21] contest, just like a boxer, his enemy
[1:06:24] that he's going to meet out there in the
[1:06:26] contest to fight. A real good fighter
[1:06:29] usually knows and studies his opponent,
[1:06:32] studies his licks, knows where he fights
[1:06:34] for, whether he leans forward, hangs
[1:06:37] back, fights right-handed, left-handed.
[1:06:40] He studies all of this. And then if he's
[1:06:43] good, a good smart fighter, he gets him
[1:06:46] a sparring partner that'll fight just
[1:06:49] like his opponent fights where he'll
[1:06:52] know all of his licks when he gets to
[1:06:54] that place. And I think that's a very
[1:06:58] good thing for Christians to do.
[1:07:02] That's right. Now, if you want to start
[1:07:04] training, start with John 3:16.
[1:07:09] The golden rule. Start right out with
[1:07:12] that and that'll get you on the floor
[1:07:16] and then train for the knockout punches
[1:07:19] because you're going to have to use
[1:07:21] them. Everybody knows that you have to
[1:07:25] train to hit your enemy.
[1:07:28] And always God uses his word. We must
[1:07:31] remember that God uses his word to
[1:07:34] defeat his enemy. If God could think or
[1:07:38] could have given his people anything
[1:07:39] better to defeat the enemy with, he
[1:07:42] would have done it. So, as I've always
[1:07:45] said, when God makes a decision, the
[1:07:48] best that there is, he when God makes a
[1:07:52] decision, that's the best that there is.
[1:07:55] He never has to alter his decisions. So
[1:07:59] the first decision God gave his people,
[1:08:03] excuse me, in the Garden of Eden to
[1:08:06] combat the enemy was his word. They were
[1:08:11] fortified with his word. And now the
[1:08:14] enemy is going to study our strategy
[1:08:17] with the word. And now Satan studied
[1:08:20] that all out so perfectly to when he
[1:08:24] come to Eve, he had the best strategy he
[1:08:27] could use upon her. And that was to
[1:08:30] reason with the word. And you never want
[1:08:34] to reason with God's word. Just believe
[1:08:38] it.
[1:08:40] Just believe his word. Is that right?
[1:08:43] Let's take a scripture in Colossians
[1:08:45] 1:28
[1:08:47] quickly. It says this just to get a
[1:08:49] scripture.
[1:09:01] Where is Colossians?
[1:09:05] Say it.
[1:09:10] You don't want to help me out. Brother
[1:09:11] John.
[1:09:15] Colossians is after Philippians.
[1:09:18] All right. Thank you. Chapter one,
[1:09:27] verse 27. to whom God would make to
[1:09:29] known what is the riches of his glory of
[1:09:32] his of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:09:36] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:09:42] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:09:46] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:09:50] may present every man what
[1:09:53] perfect in Christ Jesus that doesn't
[1:09:56] happen without the teaching of the the
[1:09:58] word that doesn't happen without an
[1:10:01] acknowledgment of the word. Lord, I want
[1:10:03] to be perfect and I just want to I want
[1:10:06] to an angel or some mysterious happening
[1:10:10] just to make me perfect. No, his word is
[1:10:13] perfect. And you study that word and
[1:10:16] there's the perfection that you're going
[1:10:18] to receive comes through this word
[1:10:21] teaching us through the perfect word. We
[1:10:25] place our faith in that. We apply that
[1:10:28] to our heart and our life and that's
[1:10:30] where our perfection comes from. Whom we
[1:10:32] preach warning every man and teaching
[1:10:35] every man in all wisdom that we may
[1:10:37] present every man perfect in Christ
[1:10:41] Jesus. I take one more scripture 1 Peter
[1:10:44] 2:2
[1:10:46] quickly. Where is Peter at?
[1:10:51] James, Peter, John, those three, those
[1:10:54] were the three that were on the mount
[1:10:55] with him, too.
[1:10:58] How many know that James 1 Peter chapter
[1:11:02] 2
[1:11:05] and verse
[1:11:07] number
[1:11:10] one. Lay aside
[1:11:13] all malice and all gile and hypocrisies,
[1:11:16] envys and all evil speaking as newborn
[1:11:20] babes.
[1:11:22] Desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:11:25] you may grow thereby.
[1:11:28] If so be you have tasted that the Lord
[1:11:31] is gracious. You know that John 3:16
[1:11:34] that's the one of those baby scriptures
[1:11:36] we think and that's that first scripture
[1:11:39] that brother says to start training with
[1:11:42] that. John 3:16
[1:11:46] that's the milk and we all need milk.
[1:11:49] But milk isn't the only thing. So as
[1:11:52] newborn babes, we desire the sincere
[1:11:56] milk of the word. But look at Hebrews
[1:11:59] chapter 5. We turn there quickly in
[1:12:02] verse
[1:12:06] number 13 quickly.
[1:12:16] verse 11 will take of whom we have many
[1:12:19] things to say and hard to be uttered
[1:12:22] seeing you are dull of hearing. For when
[1:12:26] for the time you ought to be teachers,
[1:12:29] you have need that one teach you again,
[1:12:33] which be the first principles of the
[1:12:35] oracles of God, and are become such as
[1:12:38] have need of milk and not of strong
[1:12:42] meat. For everyone that useth milk is
[1:12:45] unskillful
[1:12:47] in the word. This is a lot of Christians
[1:12:50] are unskillful.
[1:12:53] They're unskillful in the word.
[1:12:57] And skills are things you learn. You
[1:13:00] work on those skills. You memorize the
[1:13:04] scriptures that deal with salvation or
[1:13:06] temptation or so you can you be a
[1:13:09] witness to someone.
[1:13:11] You need to know your Bible. You need to
[1:13:13] know the word of God. Go through it. You
[1:13:15] read it and read it with a purpose. Read
[1:13:17] it as you're feeding yourself, but
[1:13:19] you're actually sharpening your sword
[1:13:22] and you're building up your faith and
[1:13:25] what you believe.
[1:13:27] Why do you baptize the way you do? Why
[1:13:30] are you go to church on Sunday and not
[1:13:32] Saturday? What are some of the questions
[1:13:34] that you believers come in contact with?
[1:13:37] Well, there's many Christians that are
[1:13:40] unskilled. And this is who Paul's
[1:13:41] talking to. He's not talking to the
[1:13:42] unbeliever. He's talking to those that
[1:13:45] should have been teaching by now. They
[1:13:49] can't teach Sunday school. They can't
[1:13:51] teach no how nobody come to the Lord.
[1:13:53] They can't teach. If a question comes in
[1:13:56] them, it's like, "Go ask my pastor. Go
[1:13:58] ask that brother. He knows." Well, you a
[1:14:00] brother too. You should know. You a
[1:14:03] sister, too. You should know, too. Is
[1:14:06] studying only for brothers only? Huh?
[1:14:11] Come on sisters, help me.
[1:14:14] Is studying for brothers only?
[1:14:18] Because if it is, I want the quote. I
[1:14:20] want the chapter. I want the tape title.
[1:14:21] I want the paragraph.
[1:14:24] For brothers are studying. It's for
[1:14:25] everybody. It's for Christians.
[1:14:28] The b the devil comes to all believers.
[1:14:32] We all get tested and we all being
[1:14:34] tried. And this is the greatest test
[1:14:37] that any other group of people that
[1:14:39] followed this message has never been
[1:14:41] tested. I can say this comfortably. I
[1:14:44] believe with all my heart. There's never
[1:14:45] been a group of people that followed
[1:14:48] this message that are being tested like
[1:14:51] we are being tested. Satan has really
[1:14:54] ramped it up.
[1:14:56] He has ramped it up on every level. You
[1:14:59] can't hardly even witness to anyone.
[1:15:01] They'll go online and they'll look up
[1:15:03] brother Brandham and the unbeliever has
[1:15:06] taken that name and they've done
[1:15:07] whatever they've done and it's just
[1:15:10] become difficult and very hard. They
[1:15:12] have judged the messenger and they
[1:15:15] haven't even heard his tape yet. And
[1:15:18] that's the age that we're living in.
[1:15:21] Hardest age to be a sister. Hardest age
[1:15:24] to be a brother. Hardest age to be a
[1:15:26] pastor, a minister. This is the hardest
[1:15:28] age to be a young person, to be a
[1:15:31] married person. How many's looking for a
[1:15:33] wife? Hardest age to find a wife,
[1:15:37] looking for a husband. Hardest age.
[1:15:41] Difficult, brother John.
[1:15:45] It's the worst of all the ages.
[1:15:48] Satan, brother says, he has reinforced
[1:15:51] himself. He's gathered up all of his
[1:15:54] tactics from the Garden of Eden. And I
[1:15:57] want you to listen to this for a minute.
[1:15:58] He's gathered all his tactics from the
[1:16:01] Garden of Eden after studying man, and
[1:16:04] he's reinforced it and brought it down
[1:16:07] into this age.
[1:16:09] But look what God did for us.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; He gave us a message like no other age.
[1:16:17] And it's stored up on the books. It's on
[1:16:19] the tapes. It's in your phone. But if
[1:16:21] you don't study, it won't do you no
[1:16:23] good. So we can study that. So, I'm not
[1:16:26] going to take time to go through taking
[1:16:27] sides of Jesus. There's some nice
[1:16:30] quotations in there, but
[1:16:33] um I'll let you do that. Did I finish
[1:16:36] that scripture?
[1:16:44] Hebrews 5:13. Did I finish it?
[1:16:49] He that had strong me.
[1:16:52] Um no, I didn't finish it. Verse 13. For
[1:16:55] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[1:16:58] the word of righteousness, for he is a
[1:17:03] babe. But strong meek belongth to them
[1:17:06] that are full age, even those who by
[1:17:10] reason of use
[1:17:14] have their senses
[1:17:17] exercised
[1:17:20] to discern.
[1:17:22] What?
[1:17:24] Where does that come from? How does that
[1:17:26] happen? That happens through the skills
[1:17:30] of reading the word of God, studying
[1:17:33] that, being a part of it, read it again,
[1:17:36] hear it again. Can't get it all, but you
[1:17:39] can get something. The part you get,
[1:17:43] save it, retain it, believe it. God
[1:17:45] bless you so much. God bless you.
[1:17:49] What was the tape I encourage you all to
[1:17:52] listen to?
[1:17:54] taking sides with Jesus.
[1:17:58] Read one quote out of there. Brother Bam
[1:18:01] says this paragraph 83.
[1:18:05] And then in there, get training in your
[1:18:09] own groups,
[1:18:12] other ministers, men that you see that
[1:18:15] has a calling in their life for the
[1:18:17] ministry. Train them young men. bring
[1:18:21] them in here to the elder. All of you
[1:18:24] set together in a ministerial meeting
[1:18:26] and there teach the deeper things of
[1:18:28] God. Don't go on the bad end. Keep
[1:18:31] someone who you can have confidence in
[1:18:33] to be kind of like a leader for you that
[1:18:36] sometimes and brother Vanam continues on
[1:18:39] paragraph 84. And in there churches can
[1:18:42] go here
[1:18:45] and training up a group of men. If I'm
[1:18:48] in the evangelistic work somewhere,
[1:18:49] there's places I can place them
[1:18:53] worldwide. It was brother Bannon's
[1:18:55] desire to have young men trained and
[1:18:58] ready to go to other countries like
[1:19:03] India go there with a group of men and
[1:19:08] establish and strengthen the church. I
[1:19:11] want you to read that message and you
[1:19:12] ask you tell me where have you seen that
[1:19:15] done or even taught even talked and so
[1:19:21] um but it's still there still the quote
[1:19:23] is still there right amen God bless you
[1:19:27] the training of men we're all being
[1:19:30] trained tonight
[1:19:32] God richly bless you
[1:19:35] in the message or in the prayer request
[1:19:38] that we have is for brother Mike Wartz
[1:19:40] Brother Mike Wartz had surgery on his
[1:19:42] hand today and is in a lot of pain.
[1:19:47] Barb's brother Bobby Wartz is very weak
[1:19:50] and has started chemo treatments today.
[1:19:55] So remember brother
[1:19:57] Bob Wartz and brother Mike Wartz and was
[1:20:01] there another request that we had here
[1:20:04] that you had spoken request. Yes.
[1:20:14] Okay.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. Text Roberts and brother Ted's
[1:20:30] knee replacement.
[1:20:32] Okay. All right. Someone else had a
[1:20:35] request here tonight like to make known.
[1:20:38] All right. So, always pray for one
[1:20:41] another. Pray for the services coming up
[1:20:45] week. Brother George Smith will be with
[1:20:48] us. Pray the Lord will bless those
[1:20:51] services. Also, Brother Bob's meetings
[1:20:53] are this week. They start on Friday, I
[1:20:56] believe. Or is it Thursday? I think it
[1:20:58] starts Friday.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Friday.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Friday. Yes. Brother Bob. a Christian or
[1:21:03] or landmark Christian fellowship
[1:21:06] having service. Pray for those
[1:21:09] services. The services in Mesa
[1:21:12] are cancelled this on tomorrow night and
[1:21:16] this weekend
[1:21:17] Sunday they are excuse me those services
[1:21:23] are cancelled.
[1:21:25] So pray for those brothers there. Let's
[1:21:28] all stand and we'll go to the Lord. And
[1:21:35] Jesus,
[1:21:38] look for
[1:21:40] his wonderful
[1:21:43] face.
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] And the things
[1:21:50] of earth will grow strangely
[1:21:56] dim
[1:21:57] in the light.
[1:22:01] Glory
[1:22:03] and grace.
[1:22:06] Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Turn
[1:22:10] your eyes upon Jesus.
[1:22:18] Look for
[1:22:21] his wonderful
[1:22:25] face.
[1:22:29] And the things
[1:22:32] of earth will grow strangely
[1:22:38] dim
[1:22:39] in the line
[1:22:42] of his glory.
[1:22:45] And
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; also remember brother Ben Surano. He um
[1:22:52] he had some thing going on with his
[1:22:54] eyes. They sent him home early from work
[1:22:57] today. So, he's not here tonight, but I
[1:23:00] know he would be if he could. And so,
[1:23:03] we'll pray for the Lord to touch our
[1:23:05] brother, heal him in his body. And those
[1:23:08] that you don't see that are here,
[1:23:10] remember them in prayer as as well.
[1:23:13] Amen. So, God bless you. The altar is
[1:23:16] open. You can pray right at your seat.
[1:23:19] God be with you. Amen.
