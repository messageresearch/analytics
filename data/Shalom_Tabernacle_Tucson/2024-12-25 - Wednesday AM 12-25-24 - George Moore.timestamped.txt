[28:08] Matthew the first
[28:12] chapter and the 18th verse we'll begin
[28:20] Reading
[28:27] MA
[28:57] e e
[29:29] and let's just bow our heads now
[29:31] Heavenly Father we're so grateful this
[29:34] morning to be assembled together in
[29:36] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we're
[29:39] thankful today Lord that you are God
[29:42] With Us and Lord we just ask you that
[29:45] you would bless the further part of this
[29:46] service we thank you for this Fellowship
[29:49] this assembly Lord we thank you for
[29:51] everything you've done for us Lord
[29:54] everything you're doing now and
[29:55] everything that you're going to do Lord
[29:57] we appre appreciate every bit of it Lord
[30:00] and we just commit ourselves into your
[30:02] hands for this next few minutes Lord I
[30:04] pray that you would watch over me bind
[30:06] my lips before I'd speak anything
[30:08] unpleasing to you and we'll commit it
[30:10] into your hands in the name of the Lord
[30:12] Jesus Christ and a church said amen God
[30:16] bless you may be seated and uh the title
[30:18] of the message this morning is the
[30:20] greatest Christmas gift ever given and I
[30:25] want to just take a a few minutes this
[30:28] morning to uh I'm doing a very anti-
[30:31] message uh thing this morning and I'm
[30:34] going to take up maybe not anti- message
[30:36] but anti- message Believers some of them
[30:38] and I'm going to take up for Christmas a
[30:40] little bit uh uh it seems like there's a
[30:44] lot made about Christmas in the message
[30:47] and some people have different ideas on
[30:49] it and everyone seems to have a
[30:51] different Doctrine on it and I'm not
[30:53] sure exactly why uh uh you know some
[30:56] very prominent churches in the message
[30:58] this past week just uh preached some
[31:00] pretty hard messages against the uh
[31:03] people observing Christmas and so forth
[31:05] and and then they cancelled their
[31:07] Wednesday night service or their
[31:09] Wednesday service so if you're
[31:16] against U uh you know another prominent
[31:20] Minister that I was listening to said
[31:22] Jesus never pointed us to his birth he
[31:24] pointed us to his death and while I
[31:26] certainly agree with with that in in
[31:28] theory there's two of the four gospels
[31:31] that talk extensively about the birth of
[31:33] Christ and there's multiple multiple
[31:35] quotes that talk about the birth of
[31:37] Christ and we know that Jesus was the
[31:40] word and so uh I think it's pretty well
[31:43] documented brother brandham clearly
[31:45] tells us that Christ wasn't born on
[31:47] December the 25th uh but brother
[31:50] brandham makes mention that he doesn't
[31:53] believe that the the Lord cares what day
[31:55] we observe it he he just is just as long
[31:58] as we do it we should observe it every
[32:00] day really and you know uh I guess my
[32:04] point in saying all this brothers and
[32:06] sisters is I really don't care what
[32:07] anybody believes it's just when it gets
[32:09] to the point of when you have a certain
[32:11] Doctrine or a certain belief and you
[32:13] feel like anybody else that doesn't
[32:14] believe the same way you do is going to
[32:16] miss the Rapture or they're not going to
[32:18] be a good Christian or something like
[32:20] that then I have a problem with it
[32:21] Saints you believe what you believe you
[32:23] got to stand on your convictions but
[32:25] when your convictions uh uh are or or
[32:28] putting somebody else down or putting
[32:30] somebody else out of the Kingdom then I
[32:32] have a little problem with it can you
[32:33] say Amen this morning but I believe if
[32:35] we just casually search the message
[32:37] we'll find many instances where brother
[32:39] brandham and brother Neville receive
[32:41] Christmas gifts from the church every
[32:43] year and and uh the church giv Christmas
[32:46] gifts to the children the Sunday school
[32:48] children he said we got a little
[32:49] something for you before you leave back
[32:51] there for Christmas and we find
[32:53] instances in the message where the
[32:55] church was having Christmas plays uh
[32:57] with with the Sunday school age kids and
[32:59] so forth and we find instances of
[33:02] brother brandom many times wishing
[33:04] people a Merry Christmas and so uh that
[33:06] was a little Doctrine going around
[33:08] initially was don't don't say Merry
[33:09] Christmas brother Bram said say Christ
[33:11] be with you and and brother brandham did
[33:13] say that and then he right after that he
[33:15] said Merry Christmas so uh so uh however
[33:18] you want to do it brothers and sisters
[33:19] it doesn't matter to me but what does
[33:21] matter is we don't push the other man
[33:23] out for what we believe and and we find
[33:26] many instances in the stories of brother
[33:28] brandom talking about uh stockings uh in
[33:31] his in his home when he was when he was
[33:33] a child stocking stuff with oranges and
[33:35] striped candy and how they looked
[33:37] forward to it as a kid and and he talked
[33:39] about sister hope was across the river
[33:41] shopping for the kitties some Christmas
[33:43] gifts when the flood came and that's why
[33:45] they were separated cuz she was on the
[33:47] other side of the of the river there
[33:49] shopping for Christmas gifts so we find
[33:51] all of this brother brandom said I don't
[33:53] suppose that he cares what day we set
[33:56] aside Because the actual day is lost but
[33:59] it is in commemoration of his
[34:02] birthday amen and so there in in an in
[34:05] essence lies the the reason that we
[34:08] observe it amen and so um brother
[34:11] brandom clearly tells us that this
[34:15] should be a day of
[34:17] worship amen but it seems like too many
[34:21] times as people we want to bind heavy
[34:23] burdens Grievious to be born and lay
[34:26] them on men's shoulders and sometimes it
[34:28] just seems like we're trying to make
[34:29] oursel odd which brother brandom said
[34:31] we're not supposed to do but this should
[34:34] be one of the happiest times of the year
[34:37] can you say Amen to that we should be
[34:39] thankful that this time of year that God
[34:41] sent us a savior that he sent us a son
[34:44] that he that he sent us Emmanuel and we
[34:47] should be rejoicing and happy because
[34:49] that we're free people today because he
[34:52] sent us that free gift amen but it also
[34:55] is one of the most stressful times of
[34:57] the year and and you find that many
[34:58] people are dealing this time of year
[35:00] with family issues or they're dealing
[35:03] with money issues and and many times
[35:05] people today are dealing with broken
[35:07] homes and broken families and you're

[39:46] the hands of God today Saints we're in
[39:48] God's hands it's his will that we're
[39:50] living amen I don't know what tomorrow
[39:52] holds brother John but I know he holds
[39:55] tomorrow for me amen
[39:58] unrealistic
[40:00] expectations causing our priorities to
[40:03] get out of
[40:04] line even with our children sometimes we
[40:07] got unrealistic expectations maybe
[40:10] sometimes with their schooling we want
[40:11] them to be a certain level of
[40:14] smartness we want them to get a certain
[40:16] kind of education and and you know so oh
[40:19] well they're behind they're behind in
[40:20] their English or they're behind in their
[40:22] math or who said they're behind Saints
[40:24] what does it matter if they learn it
[40:26] when they're eight or nine or 10 when
[40:27] they're 20 it ain't going to matter when
[40:29] they learned it as long as they learned
[40:31] it but we set unrealistic
[40:35] expectations and it makes us anxious oh
[40:37] what am I going to do we're behind in
[40:40] math
[40:42] H I used to when I was in Hot Springs
[40:45] some of them would graduate their kids
[40:46] at 12 or 13 14 15 years old why what are
[40:50] they going to
[40:54] do graduated high school then watch
[41:00] they're 15 years old they can't get a
[41:03] job you don't need to turn them loose in
[41:06] college at 14 so what are we in a hurry
[41:09] about Saints what's the hurry what's the
[41:12] pressure where's it from well it's from
[41:13] unrealistic expectations oh oh they need
[41:16] to get a degree well I've fired a bunch
[41:18] of people that had
[41:21] degrees because degrees don't make you a
[41:24] good person they don't make you a good
[41:26] worker
[41:27] is that right Saints
[41:30] amen they they
[41:33] don't you you can be successful with or
[41:36] without a degree amen there's a whole
[41:38] lot of people that's learned trades and
[41:40] and and they've made millions of dollars
[41:42] working a trade there's a whole lot of
[41:44] people that's made a lot of money with a
[41:46] degree but Saints it it it applies to
[41:48] the person not the degree amen it
[41:51] doesn't matter what kind of degree you
[41:52] got if you're lazy and you can't show up
[41:54] for work is that right brother will how
[41:57] many of your Cowboys got degrees brother
[41:59] will don't help none does it amen I'm
[42:03] not against that by the
[42:04] way but it it's about your work ethic
[42:07] and your and your responsibility level
[42:09] and and how how much of a benefit you
[42:11] are to the people of the company that
[42:13] you're working for amen but we got to we
[42:16] feel we got this pressure that we got to
[42:18] do this certain thing because we got to
[42:19] be successful what's the definition of
[42:22] success
[42:24] anyhow the definition of success is the
[42:27] accomplishment of an aim or a
[42:31] purpose so first off if you want to be
[42:33] successful you got to have a purpose you
[42:36] got to have an aim amen and that's the
[42:40] definition of success so if your purpose
[42:42] is to be a Godly Christian wife and
[42:45] you're doing it then you're
[42:48] successful if your purpose is to lead
[42:51] your family as a Godly husband and
[42:53] you're doing it then you're successful
[42:55] today Saints don't let the the world
[42:57] dictate what successful
[42:59] is come on somebody
[43:02] today
[43:04] amen amen some of these things that we
[43:06] make a a priority they're not a
[43:08] qualification for making a
[43:11] Rapture I'd rather my kids be dumb as a
[43:13] fence post and love the
[43:17] Lord
[43:19] amen but I come this morning to say we
[43:22] need to remove ourself from the
[43:24] expectations of the world and and look
[43:27] to the expectations of the
[43:30] word see the world don't dictate brother
[43:33] Chuck what happens in our house the
[43:36] world doesn't dictate what happens with
[43:38] our children or what happens with our
[43:40] family or what happens in our church the
[43:42] world don't dictate the world doesn't
[43:43] get to dictate what we do as a family

[43:48] good my marriage is the world doesn't
[43:50] get to dictate how how how I should live
[43:52] my life I'm not living it by the world
[43:55] I'm living it by the word somebody
[43:58] amen the world don't tell me how to
[43:59] raise my
[44:01] kids amen that's that's the Lord's job
[44:04] the Lord dictates how I raise my
[44:06] children not the not the world the the
[44:09] the the world the world don't dictate
[44:10] how I School my children that's that's
[44:12] the word that dictates
[44:15] that amen my kids don't even dictate how
[44:18] I raise my
[44:21] kids them two older kids they look at me
[44:23] all the time like a hypocrite about Eden
[44:27] they said oh you wouldn't have never let
[44:28] us do that Dad well you know what I like
[44:30] her
[44:38] better but thanks we don't need
[44:40] Psychology today we don't need
[44:44] Psychology we don't need a
[44:46] psychiatrist lat see in church Edge
[44:48] brother Brown said there is a textbook
[44:50] on psychology one we all need and it's
[44:54] the
[44:55] Bible amen he said it is written by God
[44:58] and contains God's psychology and you
[45:00] don't need any doctor to explain it to
[45:02] you receive you the Holy Spirit and let
[45:04] him do the explaining he wrote the book
[45:06] and he can tell you what's in it and
[45:08] what it means
[45:09] amen oh I'm so happy for that today
[45:13] unrealistic expectation causing
[45:16] depression stress anxiety during the
[45:19] holidays the world sets an expectation
[45:22] of what a perfect Christmas looks like
[45:24] amen what a perfect meal tastes like and
[45:27] and you got a perfect meal that you got
[45:29] to fix and you're all stressed out about
[45:31] fixing the perfect meal and then the ham
[45:33] don't turn out right and you're anxious
[45:35] and depressed about
[45:37] it the expectation of what a perfect
[45:40] gift is people don't care what kind of
[45:42] gift you get them but we got all
[45:44] stressed out worried about what kind of
[45:46] gift to get somebody we're all anxious
[45:49] about it and if we don't get the gift we
[45:50] want then we're all upset or if we give
[45:52] somebody a gift we don't think they
[45:54] liked it well enough then we're all
[45:55] upset
[45:57] the perfect expectation of a perfect
[46:00] family worried about people getting
[46:01] along let me tell you something Saints
[46:03] you can put a whole group of Christians
[46:04] in a room and they ain't all going to
[46:06] get along so ain't no way your family's
[46:09] going to all get
[46:12] along but if you got an expectation of a
[46:15] perfect family and a perfect Christmas
[46:17] and a perfect everybody getting along
[46:19] you can't put a bunch of people that
[46:20] don't like each other in the room and
[46:21] expect them all to get
[46:25] along but if we that's where our
[46:28] expectations are then it's going to lead
[46:30] to anxiety it's going to lead to
[46:33] depression amen come on somebody today
[46:36] but remove ourselves today Saints from
[46:38] the expectations of Christmas and let's
[46:41] look to the reasons for Christmas remove
[46:44] ourself from the expectation and look
[46:46] for the reason brother Brown say sir we
[46:48] would see Jesus he said let me make this
[46:50] clear I do not believe that Jesus would
[46:52] care what day you worshiped his birthday
[46:54] on if it's a 25th 26th or whether it's
[46:57] in April May June July whatever it might
[46:59] be just so you Worship You worship him
[47:02] on any day but here's what it is they've
[47:05] taken the sacredness from Christmas to
[47:07] make it not a Christmas but a worship
[47:09] day but a celebration see and we we
[47:12] don't he said you hear people say we're
[47:14] going to celebrate Christmas that's
[47:16] wrong we should never celebrate
[47:18] Christmas Christmas is a day of worship
[47:21] not celebration we celebrate Lincoln's
[47:24] birthday we celebrate Washington's
[47:26] birthday and if you was down in the Deep
[47:28] South and would celebrate Lee's birthday
[47:30] or Jackson Amen to that
[47:32] now the birth the birthday is a
[47:35] celebration but the birthday of Christ I
[47:37] believe should be a day of consecration
[47:40] worship instead of tonight of people at
[47:42] church on their knees praying and
[47:44] thanking God for the real Christmas
[47:52] gift amen it's good to be in the house
[47:54] of the Lord on Christmas Day Saints amen
[47:59] Christmas is a day of worship but
[48:00] instead of being a day of worship we let
[48:02] out church
[48:04] service he said people at church on
[48:07] their knees thanking God for the real
[48:09] Christmas gift amen see when the wise
[48:12] men came they presented to Jesus gifts
[48:15] and so in commemoration of that we
[48:17] present gifts today brother Brown said
[48:20] the great shineing light he said what
[48:21] did the gold represent he was a king he
[48:23] was a he wasn't uh to be made King he
[48:26] was born born King he wasn't God's he
[48:28] was God's Eternal King he was a king so
[48:31] they offered gold and they offered
[48:33] frankincense that's a perfume very
[48:35] costly the best that could be gotten
[48:37] what did frankincense mean the perfume
[48:39] he was a sweet smelling savior unto God
[48:42] for he went about Healing The Sick and
[48:45] doing good gold because he was King
[48:47] frankincense because he was a sweet
[48:49] smelling savior to God his life so
[48:51] pleased him that God breathed in his
[48:54] breathed in his Holiness and Beauty for
[48:56] it was his own Holiness reflected in him
[48:59] oh if we could be a sweet smelling
[49:01] savior if God's holiness could be
[49:03] reflected in US is that your desire this
[49:05] Christmas Day Saints God's holiness
[49:07] reflected in us till we go about doing
[49:10] good as Jesus of Nazareth till it would
[49:12] be a sweet smelling savior unto the Lord
[49:14] but we fuss we argue we stew we doubt
[49:17] that's the reason it's become a stench
[49:19] in the nostrils of
[49:21] God our lives were in and out of old
[49:24] places we should not be we say things we
[49:28] ought not say come on somebody today we
[49:30] do things we ought not do we fuss and
[49:33] take sides with the world and deny
[49:35] Christ in the general in the great
[49:36] crucial moments that's the reason we
[49:38] can't be a sweet smelling
[49:40] savior but he was these Magi gave
[49:45] frankincense he said now they gave him
[49:47] myrr
[49:48] also and anybody knows that myrr is a
[49:51] very costly but bitter herb
[49:53] myrr what did myrr represent his great
[49:56] Supreme
[49:57] sacrifice his crushed out Young Life at
[50:00] Calvary where the sins of the world
[50:02] ground him into bits gold because a king
[50:04] frankincense of his sweet loving life
[50:06] and M because of his sacrifice for
[50:08] Sinners that he died he was wounded for
[50:11] our transgressions bruised for our
[50:13] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[50:15] was upon him and with his stripes we
[50:18] were healed Saints the greatest gift
[50:20] that could be given was gave on that

[50:36] wasn't just the birth it was the
[50:37] resurrection it wasn't just the birth it
[50:40] was the Ascension it wasn't just the
[50:42] birth it was the Holy Ghost that he shed
[50:44] for
[50:45] you oh he was wrapped in swalling cloth
[50:47] he was born in a stable he was like king
[50:49] of glory but he didn't have his own bed
[50:52] he owned it all but he didn't have a
[50:54] bed amen he owned it all but he didn't
[50:57] have a room to stay in in the end he
[50:59] owned it all but he didn't have a grave

[1:38:09] be in the house of the Lord I um happy
[1:38:12] to see you all make it out to the house
[1:38:14] of the Lord on a Christmas morning and
[1:38:17] we enjoy that word this morning didn't
[1:38:19] we amen just beautiful I have one
[1:38:22] scripture I want wanted to read to you
[1:38:25] and then we'll uh pray and we'll close
[1:38:27] here but it's in Philippians chapter
[1:38:33] 3 you turn there
[1:38:41] quickly I believe that's what it is in
[1:38:43] verse number eight
[1:38:56] verse 7even but what things were gained
[1:39:00] to me those I count it lost for
[1:39:03] Christ yes doubtless and I count all
[1:39:07] things but lost for the Excellency of
[1:39:10] the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:39:14] for whom I have suffered the loss of all
[1:39:16] things and do count them but dunk that I
[1:39:20] may win Christ and be f found in him not
[1:39:25] having my own righteousness which is of
[1:39:27] the law but that which is through the
[1:39:30] Faith of Christ the righteousness which
[1:39:34] is of god by
[1:39:36] faith that I may know him and the power
[1:39:41] of his
[1:39:42] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:39:45] sufferings being made
[1:39:48] conformable unto his death amen and we
[1:39:53] know that um to know him is life and
[1:39:59] Paul said that I may know him and when
[1:40:04] and when we know who he is it brings to
[1:40:07] us this great revelation of what
[1:40:09] Christmas
[1:40:10] is I was raised in a home where we had a
[1:40:13] Christmas tree every year when I gave my
[1:40:16] heart to the Lord the little church I
[1:40:19] was a Holiness Church um and and then
[1:40:23] coming into the message our pastor he he
[1:40:27] didn't believe in Christmas trees
[1:40:29] although his head Deacon had the biggest
[1:40:31] tree in the
[1:40:32] church every year brother s do it preach
[1:40:36] those quotes on paganism there's quotes
[1:40:39] in there you know Jeremiah talks about
[1:40:41] it brother bam calls it paganism so I I
[1:40:45] was a no tree
[1:40:47] guy even as a Believer no tree no tree
[1:40:50] no tree and my wife was raised with no
[1:40:53] tree but then after we got married you
[1:40:57] know she wanted a tree and uh I'm still
[1:41:00] a no tree
[1:41:01] guy uh she's a no tree person so guess
[1:41:05] what we got in our
[1:41:07] house
[1:41:10] Tre happy wife somebody wanted to clap
[1:41:13] over there happy wife happy life they
[1:41:17] say and um but when you know him it
[1:41:20] doesn't matter whether you got a tree or
[1:41:23] not I know some Believers they'll leave
[1:41:25] a a church over just a communion cup
[1:41:30] whether you have the little ones or One
[1:41:32] Singular cup and there's many things you
[1:41:34] can find and you'll see that brother
[1:41:36] brandom lived a balanced life and he did
[1:41:39] both and so he gave us the truth of
[1:41:43] Christmas and with the Christmas tree
[1:41:44] and all the lights and tensils but yet
[1:41:47] he enjoyed the season and I I love how
[1:41:51] brother George brought that today and so
[1:41:54] we're just I'm so good to be back in the
[1:41:56] house of the Lord good back good to be
[1:41:58] back to see you folks see you Saints had
[1:42:01] a wonderful time in
[1:42:02] Tanzania and I preached eight Services
[1:42:05] there in those days and in there um I
[1:42:10] was told my wife I was going to tease
[1:42:11] and she kind of got on me about it so I
[1:42:13] said I wouldn't but I guess I will
[1:42:18] um in their program they had it set for
[1:42:21] the preaching service we had two days
[1:42:24] just for pastors an morning service and
[1:42:27] an evening service that song specials
[1:42:31] songs prayer request specials and then
[1:42:34] the time the portion for preaching how
[1:42:37] much time do you think they allowed for
[1:42:38] the preacher to
[1:42:40] preach three
[1:42:42] hours thank you three hours for the
[1:42:46] preacher to preach and they feel short
[1:42:49] if you don't take that and so but I
[1:42:52] never took it
[1:42:54] and then in the evening session was a
[1:42:55] two-hour slot and then we repeated that
[1:42:58] and then one day we had three services
[1:43:00] one brother couldn't preach so they
[1:43:02] plugged me in there and I preached eight
[1:43:05] services and the Lord really blessed us
[1:43:08] in a tremendous way so my voice is gone
[1:43:11] a little bit and I trust it to come back
[1:43:14] to me and I certainly uh enjoyed the the
[1:43:18] the fellowship I was just blessed being
[1:43:21] in those services the old the young the
[1:43:25] middle AG they all take notes throughout
[1:43:29] the whole
[1:43:30] service they're feeding on every
[1:43:34] word you read a quote they're kid
[1:43:36] they're catching that quote and they're
[1:43:38] going to write it down and go home and
[1:43:41] read that again and just to see that and
[1:43:44] there's so many things you think you're
[1:43:45] coming from a first world country to
[1:43:48] teach them but they have so many things
[1:43:51] that they can teach us and I learned a a
[1:43:53] whole lot just from being amongst them
[1:43:55] in the midst of them and so we certainly
[1:43:58] thank the Lord and I think that's what
[1:44:01] missionary work does it puts you uh um
[1:44:04] to see how other people are serving the
[1:44:06] lord but when the when I preach the word
[1:44:09] and the Holy Ghost came in the meeting
[1:44:11] they act just like you act and the Holy
[1:44:14] Spirit over there it's the same Holy
[1:44:16] Spirit over here and the quotes in the
[1:44:19] Bible over there are the same here and
[1:44:22] so we thank God that the same God over
[1:44:24] there is the same God here and that's
[1:44:27] what joins us together didn't know their
[1:44:30] language that keep they preach Swahili
[1:44:33] and um there's a lot of cultural thing
[1:44:36] differences there but when we start
[1:44:38] preaching this word and getting into
[1:44:40] this message there's an atmosphere that
[1:44:43] unites us all and so I'm so glad to be
[1:44:46] back with you Merry Christmas I think
[1:44:48] this is the first time I've seen Aaliyah
[1:44:50] or karesa since I've been back Levi
[1:44:53] picked me up and I saw Sharon of course
[1:44:56] and so happy to be back here with you so
[1:44:58] Merry Christmas to you all and God bless
[1:45:00] you richly and we certainly enjoy all
[1:45:03] the song specials and we trust the Lord
[1:45:05] will bless you very very richly this
[1:45:09] this season and he'll bless you amen so
[1:45:12] with that said let's stand to our feet
[1:45:14] and

[1:50:51] us though I I can't
[1:50:53] [Music]
[1:50:56] repay like to
[1:50:58] say that
[1:51:02] I Amen brother Ben wanted to greet the
[1:51:06] Saints he had something to say I bless
[1:51:08] him
[1:51:10] amen God bless you
[1:51:12] all I just kind of wanted to share a
[1:51:16] little thing that's in my heart come
[1:51:18] come on real strong this morning
[1:51:22] um brother brandom said
[1:51:25] that Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:36] new Jehovah of the oldest Jesus of the
[1:51:39] new as brother was mentioned morphe he
[1:51:43] changed his
[1:51:45] form to because brother brandom said
[1:51:49] what kind of God would be a god that
[1:51:52] would send his son it's like me sending
[1:51:55] my son to die for somebody that's not
[1:51:58] even right you know what he did he he
[1:52:02] came
[1:52:03] himself he came himself that makes it a
[1:52:07] very special to me yes yes yes that it
[1:52:10] was the almighty God yes yes IM morphe
[1:52:14] changed himself into a son cuz he's he's
[1:52:18] Eternal he couldn't come he's an eternal
[1:52:21] spirit he had to become flesh you had to
[1:52:23] come in a
[1:52:24] sunship but Jesus Christ was Almighty
[1:52:28] Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the
[1:52:31] you when that came to my heart that made
[1:52:34] it so much more special to
[1:52:37] me I I love the Lord Jesus with all my
[1:52:40] heart yes
[1:52:42] sir and I just that was just in my heart
[1:52:45] that cuz sometimes we think that God is
[1:52:50] up there and Jesus with a son and like
[1:52:53] it was the
[1:52:55] almighty he came himself to to Die For
[1:53:00] Us in Redemption he there was a law in
[1:53:03] the in the Old Testament where it had to
[1:53:05] be a kins folk it had to be one of us so
[1:53:10] almighty God is a spirit he had to
[1:53:13] become flesh so he he created a body to
[1:53:16] come and die and pay the price for
[1:53:19] us and our sins put them there our sins
[1:53:25] did but then his when he shed that blood
[1:53:29] he forgave us of our sins that's a
[1:53:34] paradox yeah there I remember when I
[1:53:38] heard the life story one time where
[1:53:42] brother Brandon was he had just lost his
[1:53:44] wife and uh his his baby and he was
[1:53:50] crushed he he tried to Comm commit
[1:53:52] suicide twice and I remember he said he
[1:53:55] he was a a linean he said that there was
[1:53:58] a line like 2,000 volts he and he said
[1:54:02] uh he said he looked on the hill he saw
[1:54:05] a cross he said my sins put him there he
[1:54:08] tried to grab that that Lon and he found
[1:54:12] himself on the ground but what a love he
[1:54:15] had for for Christ said he said my sins
[1:54:18] put him there when he's thinking about
[1:54:19] that when has just left his wife and his
[1:54:22] and his daughter I remember a brother
[1:54:25] then that lost his his his son and he
[1:54:28] was he was like a very spiritual and
[1:54:32] after he lost his son he he he left he
[1:54:35] said how can how can he not resurrect my
[1:54:38] son and it was just the opposite the
[1:54:41] prophet was wasn't like that and it's
[1:54:44] just I just wanted to share that from my
[1:54:47] heart just so we can know that who Jesus
[1:54:50] Christ really is he is almighty
[1:54:54] God just thank you very much thank you
[1:54:58] praise brother thank you amen let's give

[1:55:10] Jesus did for you God became a man to
[1:55:15] die for our sins because he loves you
