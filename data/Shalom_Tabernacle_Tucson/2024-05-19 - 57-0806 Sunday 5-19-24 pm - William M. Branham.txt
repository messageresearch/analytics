so I'm going to give a testimony even though it takes a little bit of time um I gave I gave a testimony at my high school graduation which was a year ago um this end of May about um Lord healing me from diabetes and chronic headaches and um about a couple months after that it kind of all came back and I got it again and then I like six months ago I'd say um was battling a really severe depression if you ever dealed with depression it's just something you never really break out of you're just kind of always like you have your good days you have your bad days but it's kind of always a tainted day it's never a great day um and it was really hard to go through and um you know you're claiming your healing but it's your faith is down and um it was probably the hardest battle I'd been through and then is in the middle of relationship and then I got engaged and I was just praying this morning I was like Lord I don't want to take this into my marriage I I can't let this be bothering me and this is what I start my marriage out on that's just not healthy I can't I can't do that that's going to really set it off on the wrong foot um and me and Trevor had a real big heart to heart last night and I was like I have to get this under control and so brother Joel's sermon hit it right on the head this morning and I went through that prayer line I had a horrible headache this morning I couldn't get to go away I took exed I drank water and as soon as I went through that prayer line he called the sisters up to pray with me and he said they prayed with me and it just left and I felt the depression leave the anxiety it just melted away I have never felt this light and this song has been on my heart for a year I wanted to sing it after my graduation and I just never listen to the Lord so we're going to sing it tonight because he's been telling me for 12 months to sing it I've had many tears and Sorrows I've had questions for tomorrow there have been times I didn't know right

Lonely Hour yes those many lonely hours Jesus let me know I was his own for through it all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it all through it all I've learned to depend upon his word so I thank God for the mountains and I thank him for the valleys and I thank him for the storms he's brought me through for if I never had a problem how would I know that he could solve them how would I know what my faith in God could do it's the reason I sing through it all oh through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God through it

me in the N amen praise the Lord thank the lord we certainly thank the Lord for his presence in our midst we like to take the scripture in St John chapter 3 we're going to be listening to the message um God projecting his love this message brother Brandon preached it is the foundation of the message the 11th commandment the little booklet in the message and uh I trust it'll be a blessing to you we're going to start it down just a little bit but this is the scripture he takes John 3:16 and many of us know John 3:16 but we move or we fail to catch the context we don't know what John 3:15 said or John 3:14 say so we're going to read from John 3 14 15 16 and 17 and then let the prophet preach amen how many looking forward to that oh my what a privilege what a privilege and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved amen we thank God for the reading of word let's prepare our hearts to listen to this message the prophet preach in 1957 amen only believe only believe amen don't you just love the Lord I love you Lord I love you Lord amen only be only [Music] be all things are Possible only really only believe only believe all things are possible oh can you make a confession with your hand raised Lord Lord Lord I believe Hallelujah Lord I believe that all things are possible Lord I I believe you I believe your word Lord Lord I [Music] believe Lord I believe all things are [Music] possible Lord I we God bless you may be seated brother brandom amen during the time of the Revolutionary in the states it was said that a soldier was tried and court marshaled for a certain crime and was to be shot at a certain date at Sunrise day before some of them went to the notable president and beg for his life and the president being in a hurry picked up a small piece of paper and wrote on it I pardon this man and signed his name Abraham Lincoln and the carrier brought the piece of paper to the cell and said to to the man you are free and as the man looked he said it's doesn't seem official to me I just don't believe it and I'll not leave here he rejected it because it was on a small piece of paper and not a great letterhead or something from the president the next morning the man died as sentenced by firing squad then the paper was written with the president's name the man is pardoned and they shot him after the president had pardoned him and it was tried in federal court and there was a decision that a pardon is not a pardon except it be received as a pardon so John 3:16 is a pardon to every Mortal man and woman on earth if it's received as a pardon but if it's not your still condemned for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but would have everlasting life what a pardon to Adam's Fallen race that any man or woman that wants to receive it it's a free pardon for you and for me that love that God had love is a powerful force and when love is projected and it comes to the end of its strength Sovereign Grace will take it up from there and project the object that love has as far that's the reason we have a savior tonight is because God so love the world that is love being projected to the world produced a savior God wanted to see you well so much his love went out and produced an atonement for your sickness as your sins it was the love of God that constrained him to do it love is a powerful force it'll run a woman a mother right into the fls of fire after her baby if she knows she's plunging herself to death there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust you might go and know that you belong to the greatest Church in all the provinces of Canada you might know that you're the charter member of the greatest Church in the nation and then you would do things that you would not do if you belong to a little Mission somewhere in some corner and had the love of God in your heart love has no fear Love cast us out fear and I noticed in my meetings so much that when I come into the people one of the great things I find among them is fear and what makes fear is lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it Cast Away that fear and that's the way God wants his church not so many as charter members he want members that's loyal and loves and believes and have confidence in him for instance my wife is somewhere in the meeting tonight in the audience I love her with all my heart and when I get ready to go overseas now what if my wife I caught her by the arm and said listen here Mrs Brandon while I'm gone overseas Thou shalt not have any more husbands and if I ever hear of you flirting with any other man while I'm gone woe unto you when I get back and then she catch me with the coke collar and said that's very well Mr Brandon but I want you to have a little law too if I hear of you going out with another woman War under to you when you come back now wouldn't that be a home well that's just about the way we made God's place of dwelling some kind of legalistic laws that we have to keep what do I do when I go overseas I love my wife and as long as I love her I got confidence in her we just get down in the floor and pray together bring our little children around us they pray God take care of daddy bring him back I pray God take care of the family while I'm gone I rais up kiss her goodbye kiss the babies she said Billy I'll be praying for you while you're gone that settles it we think no more about it and if I was overseas under the law that I know I'd be divorced when to get back if I went out with someone else I'd be a miserable man but if I was over there no matter what kind of a condition I was in and I knew that I could cheat on her and come back and tell her and she would forgive me for it I still wouldn't do it I wouldn't hurt her for nothing no sir if I know you said bill I understand I forgive you I couldn't look her in the face I think too much of her I tell you brother when the love of God comes into the human heart it'll D all these things you don't have to worry about smoking drinking and run into BIOS Scopes when the love of Christ comes into your heart you wouldn't do nothing to hurt him not walking around saying they're narrow minded and they're this way and that way just let the love of God strike you once those things die your whole affections is placed on Christ you got eternal life then when you believe him when you really believing and get married to him and die out to the things of the world God projects his love and his love makes you what you are oh there's many things we could say about I'm just going to let my collar down as it was for a few minutes and tell you my Canadian friends some of the inside if you'll excuse that as a personal testimony I want to let you know something on the inside of my life that I found cause it seems very fitted right at this time many people wonders what takes place think it's some sort of a Mystic it isn't it's love that's the main thing is loving Christ not just saying you do but from your heart love him I've seen the cruelest of devils conquered I've seen wild animals flower themselves in the presence of God's love love castes the fear away here's in this little book is written a testimony at Portland Oregon one night I was preaching on faith and all of a sudden up through the building came a great big man about 250 I thought he must have been a messenger until I noticed the whole group of preachers maybe 150 more just scatter from the platform and when he run up he looked at me in the face Drew back his big arms little and I know he was an insane man out of an institution and he just HD a preacher out on the street and broke his jaw and his collar bone knocked him way out in the street and there's about 6,000 people present what could get in the building pouring the rain on the outside and this fella run to the platform and he looked at me and he said you hypocrite he said up here posing yourself as a servant of God I'll break every bone in your body I weighed 128 pounds he weighed right on 250 or better nearly 7 foot tall well able and strength the pack his threat out I knew better than to say anything for he was Well Physical able but when I turned to look at the man something happened oh if it would always happen instead of flying loose and wanting to fight the man or to call the police on him I loved him I thought that poor man doesn't want to hurt me that's a devil call ING that man he wants to hurt me that man is a man probably with a family who loves likes to eat soate and be a citizen but the Devil in him is doing that I thought that poor brother and he walked up close to me and he said I'll show you whether you're a man of God or not I never open my mouth I just looked at everything was quiet I had just LED two little policemen to Christ back in the dressing room they ran out to the platform to grab the man I shook my head at him it's not a flesh and blood Affair and the man walked right up to my face spit right my face he said you snake in the grass I'll break every bone in your body for I'm going to knock you way out in the middle of that audience great big arms I never said a word but I was no more afraid that I am right now that's it it's love I never went there by my own will God sent me there it's up to God to take care of me while I'm there I looked at him I thought poor fell and he raised back his big fist and started to strike me 6,000 people just sitting breathless as he started to strike I said Satan come out of that man first I missed some of it when he told me that he was going to knock me out in the floor I heard my own voice telling tonight you'll fall over my feet he said I'll show you whose feet I'll fall over and he drew back to strike me and I said Satan leave the man and the man threw his arms in the air his great eyes bulged out his mouth went open he turned around and fell on the floor and pinned my feet to the floor to the policeman had to roll him over don't be Frid God still lives I've seen him in the challenge of witch doctors in Africa with all the Hinduism in India don't don't you think the devil won't make you prove every inch of ground you claim but if you love him there's no fear left sometime ago a few weeks ago down in O Mexico we were supposed to get the bulling but they wouldn't let us have it and we had to take a great big field where they run a ballpark or something thousands of people swarmed in we couldn't get to the building or to the place they had to let me up a ladder and then down into the bull ring and then while preaching there that night the night before a lady had come there at 3:00 in the afternoon and people gathered at 9:00 at morning no cheers to set in they leaned against each other and they were waiting till 9 that night what will they do in the day of judgment against the self style groups that wouldn't even darken the door of such a place then that night Mr Moore standing in it pouring down rain and Mr Moore kept telling me there's something going on at the pray line and a Mexican Minister from California brother espinos many of you may know him he was giving out the prayer cards and trying to keep the people ly and he couldn't do it and Billy come to me my boy and said Daddy he can't hold that line any longer there's a little woman down there with a dead baby that died this morning and she's climbing over the top of the man I said well brother Moore you go down there and pray for the baby and Brother Moore started down and I looked out here in front of me and a vision come of the little baby raising up now we can't say these things unless they're authentic and the little baby I noticed a little mother down there screaming padra the word padra means father she was Catholic and when I said bring the little lady here and she had a blanket over it it's soaking wet I couldn't speak to her no one there to interpret I just laid my hands over on the little baby and offered to God a little prayer this Bible laying open here now God knows the truth the little fell let out a squeal and begin to kick his heart as he could that just alarmed the whole Mexico the next day or night when I got in there the platform was about as wide again as this entire building across here the floor space and it was pile full of old coats and hats they might pray over them hats and things for the people coming on the platform that night about the fourth or fifth person I noticed an old wrinkled faed man and as he come up he was blind and he kept saying something The Interpreter was speaking it was he approaching the man that was going to pray for him he kept telling yes he fumbled in his old ragged coat pocket brought out a little pair of beads and begin to say something over these beads I told him I said put it away brother you don't have need of that now and he stuck it in his pocket and I looked at him I begin to think now to you pastors here's something for you you know your congregation knows where you love them or not you can't put on love it's got to be real it's just like people trying to a freezing man you'd show him a painted fire he can't warm by a painted fire it's got to have some heat in it and love has got to have has an action to it and the old man as he stood there I begin to feel sorry for him I looked at his old ragged coat I put my shoulders upside of his to see if my coat would fit him I look at his feet no shoes on great calluses on his feet Dusty all the way up as far as you can see where his ragged trouser leg my shoe wasn't nothing like big enough for him and I begin to look and I thought that poor old man maybe never had a good meal in all his life oh the economics of Mexico is very poor The Brick Mason gets about eight pesos a day and it takes about four days good hard labor to buy himself a pair of shoes that's Poncho Frank what does Pedro do working for about two peses with six or eight children to raise oh it's terrible and I thought after all that and then nature the devil has given him evil to Blind his poor old blinded eyes how cruel it was to him I begin to enter into something I can't express it it was the love of sympathy as the old fellow common ladies head over on my should told I hugged that old ragged coat I said merciful God please help this poor old blind daddy and my dad would have lived it' have been about that age will you help him and I heard him H glory atos and the man could see as good as I could the people begin screaming everywhere what was it it was entering into that Fellowship of his suffering in his life is you must do it if ever I had a time of success of praying for anyone is when I could enter into the fellowship with them feel their infirmities feel their conditions then something in you goes down beyond the reason and praise of prayer of faith for the sck you've got to feel for man you've got to sympathize with him you've got to be with him before you can help him then you enter into some sort of a deepness it's a love of God it's beyond human love I'm going to tell you something you may class me a fanatic after this but I'll feel like I want to tell you anyhow many things happen like that frankly all my Ministry has been wrapped around that one thing if I can love that or fall in sympathy with it I was a game warden of Indiana for several years while I was still a Baptist pastor one day I was left my truck and was going across a field and I had a little old gun pistol revolver I was supposed to pack and I going over across the hills to see a sick friend to pray for him and I took this little old gun off and throw it up in the seat and started across the field as I walked through the field lot of little Shrub Oak I don't think you have it here little Shrub Oak we call it there in the field I was about 200 yards from the fence or better when all of a sudden the great fool raised up and I recognized him he was that killer from the Burks Farm down near the wet Ridge Cemetery a few months before that had killed a colored man gour him through and killed him and they had sold him up there because he was a famous gery bull a breeder and they had him up there and I forgot that he was in that field and he rose up not over about 30 yards from me and anyone knows what those vicious animals are and this fell a killer and as he rose up I was excited of course I reach for the gun and it wasn't there and I'm glad that it wasn't there I to kill the then went and paid for him I reached for the gun it wasn't there then I looked to the fence too far away not a tree nowhere but just little scrub Oaks about four or five foot high and he had been laying down with some cattle in this midst of these trees what was it if I turn my back he got me no matter where went he got me it was death then I thought oh my Lord I won't end my life as a coward I've tried to tell others to be brave in the time of trouble I said I'll walk to death just as Brave as I can walk trus in Jesus Christ no more than that come from my thinking now please don't take this as juvenile but something happened oh I wished it would happen right now always in those cases that something [Music] happens instead of hating that bull there was something I sympathized with him I loved him and I was no more afraid of that animal and I am standing here with my brethren all here have left and I thought poor creature I'm on your territory you're an animal you don't know any different that's the only thing you know is protect your rights and I said to this bull in these words oh creature of God I am a servant of God and I'm on my way to pray for my sick brother I'm sorry I Disturbed you but in Jesus name go lay down and he threw his Harms in the ground throwing the dirt he fell to his knees and through the dirt again I stood there just as calm as I am now and he rushed towards me just as hard as he could come in a charge I just stood there for I wasn't afraid and when he gotten about five feet of me he threw his big feet out like that and stopped and he looked this way and that way so depleted and turned around and went over there and laid down and I pass within five fet of him and he never moved No More Jesus Christ God's son when love is put in his place it'll defeat any enemy there is on the Earth or in tment now you say brother Brandon I had a lot of confidence in you till now well let me tell you brother we all going to answer at the day of judgment and the god that could close a lion's mouth in the den with Daniel still lives today certainly my wife will probably I don't know where she's at she don't always got to answer me for more in the yard the shirt off I have about a half acre in the parsonage there and one day I was pushing my lawn mow and I'd run a few rounds and somebody would come into to me prayed for i' have to slip out and take off my overhauls and put on some clothes and running pray for maybe get a couple rounds that day in the front yard would be growed up before I could get in the backyard so one hot afternoon I was in the backyard no one around no one could see me I pulled off my shirt now you all don't have hot weather here you have to have some of that in Indiana on that Ohio River and I was a mowing the grass just as hard as I could run afraid somebody would come in all at once I wouldn't get but a few rounds made and I forgot that in the corner of the fence was a nest of hornets and I Ram that Mo right into that nest and friends as God being my judge I was covered all over with Hornets just in a moment now anyone knows what a hornet is he'll kill you one Hornet can flatten you on the ground and me with no shirt on and I was standing there and something happened I don't know what it is it's just something that happens it's love instead of hating your harness I thought poor little creatures of God I have nothing again you at your home and I Disturbed you sounds like a child but the trouble of it is we tried to be growing up when we ought to be children we take things just as we are so intelligent we'd have to measure our intelligence with God's grace one time I wonder what would come up but in this these harnesses all over me and I wasn't afraid of the little fellas I said little creatures go back into your nest I will not harm you and as God Lives them Hornets whed around me three or four times and went right straight back into their nest that's just the truth as I stand here last summer Mr Mercer here Mr Gold which is your also and many of the the some of the campaign party it's not with me now we were sitting on my front steps it had been a a negro girl it's in the paper that morning a lovely beautiful looking colored girl and she had had a baby illegitimately born and she had tucked this baby and smothered it in some blankets wrapped some water around it and hir a cab and she went out on the Ohio bridge and looked off and lik she go throw a bundle over and she threw the baby in the river the tag cab driver reported back to the authorities they stained it out and found it was a baby Mr Mercer here and Mr Gold I call on my student ministers if you ever knew who they was one's a Catholic and the other I think's a steam fitter and they made them themselves a little FBI to come find out if these Visions were right and come in town posing as somebody else and the Lord revealed it all to them right there and they become friends of mine and they were sitting on the porch and I was teaching I said that woman isn't a mother a mother wouldn't do a thing like that noer I said she's a female it gave birth to a baby but she's not a mother a mother is a greater name than that and while we were talking coming down the road I don't know where you know what they are here the animals was a possum I live about 200 yards from a little woods on the River Bank the three houses between me and the woods with no fances my house has a fence around it and this old pum come up in the middle of the day about 10 o00 I guess at morning turned in the gate and I said that possum has rbies because of possum anyone knows a posum prows at night when the Sun goes down they go out and prow in daytime they're practically blind and here come this pum right in the hot summer in the middle of the day coming right up and turned in my gate Mr Woods who formerly was Jehovah Witness and his boy was healed with infantile paralysis his legs draw behind him you don't even know which leg it was now L his mother would have to tell him which it was he had quit his Contracting and moved in next door to me just to be with me and he had been cut it help me cut the yard and the rake was laying there we been rake in the grass C it gotten tall and Leo and Jean and I run out to the yard and I took this rake and throw it over the pum to stop it and when it did it just started gnawing on the rake now that's unusual because the pum usually when he touch him he what they call play possum he just lays act like he's dead and while he was in that condition Mrs Woods come up and Mr woods and Mrs Woods is a Veterinary and while he was laying in that condition I said oh I see what's the matter the dogs had got her a few days before our car and it mashed her left shoulder till it was swollen about that big broken hanging back behind her and this is an awful word to say but the Flies had bloated and maggots was working on them and I said just look at that I said that poor old thing is dying I said that's what made her fight like that and just then the Milkman come up and he was looking at her all of us standing around and a possum and a kangaroo is the only two animals that have a pocket they care they're young in so the old pum had let down her string that help the the pocket together and nine little baby possums naked about that long has crawling on the ground I said look at that now come here Leo Jean I said there is real Mother's Love there's really more mother about this old possum than there is about that woman that drowned her baby she doesn't have over 30 minutes longer to live and she's willing to give that 30 minutes to fight for them babies it's Mother's Love that's in her that makes her do it and while we were looking at it Mrs wood said brother brand what are you going to do with it said won't you you kill her now and said take them little ones and just kill them quickly because got a round mouth and they can't nurse a bottle so you'll have to kill him I said I just can't do it why Miss Wood said I go and get you a gun and kill it said I thought you was a hunter I said I'm a Hunter but I'm not a killer I said I I just couldn't do it that's a mother and she's fighting for her babies I haven't got the heart to do it she said well let Banks do it that's her husband I said no I can't do that said you don't mean you're going to let that poor thing lay there and suffer the woman was right in her with thinking said being a Veterinary she know the Humane thing to do was kill him and I said that's right Mrs woods but I just can't do it she said you going to let her lay down like that I said yes and I let the rake up and she made her way up to my doorstep and collapsed we went up there and poured water on her every once in a while she looked like she greened just a little had the posum does make the grin that night after a long days of service Mr wood said brother BR you service long enough today said let's go out and take a ride coming in that night at 11:00 there laid the old pum still laying there he said now you know if she' have ever moved anymore she'd move when the sun went down those little babies still nursing that almost dead mother all night I couldn't sleep the next morning I went out about 6:00 there was old posum still laying there do all over flies all over the lake well I thought that poor old thing and I can't kill her those little babies still nursing at her I thought suppose she's dead and I kicked on her a few times with my foot I seen her move just a little she's still alive I thought oh my just then I heard my little girl Rebecca here she's going to be a spiritual little girl she just saw her first Vision recently in the school quite just a moment I'm going to do something that or try something if God willing I'm going to ask him I'm going to ask you people tonight I told Billy not to give out any prayer cards we already got prayer cards out not to give out anymore tonight which we usually do but I'm going to ask those who's got prayer card just hold your peace for a minute I'm going to ask the heavenly father that if we have found Grace in his sight tonight that he will move over this audience now and will heal the sick without you coming here I believe he'll do it I'm asking him to upon the Merit of his word on the Merit of these people coming to Christ I've done my best all I know how to do immediately after this service I'll ask you to come to the Altar and pray just a moment we've been late each night and I'm going to ask you to be reverent and pray and look this away and if Christ the one that I have spoke of God's atonement if he were standing here in this pulpit and the Bible said that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities how many knows the Bible says that right well when a woman touched him when he was your on Earth he turned around and said who touched me and he kept looking over the audience till he found the woman and told her her condition and told her her faith that saved her is that right the Bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever that was the sign of the Messiah in the Bible when he was here because he did those things to the Jew and Samaritan and Gentile and all how many knows that to be the truth that was the Seal of his messiahship now if you will give me your attention just for a moment everybody believ everybody look everybody beli look to Christ say Lord Jesus I'm in need and we got a day where I feel sorry for the people one says this is a way that's the way we got the truth we got poor people don't know which way to go American and Canadian people are the worst confused people in all the world that's right the worst confused of all the world if he anywhere that missionaries belong is not in Africa it's in the North America continent I'm sure if brother Toms is standing here he could almost than you to say that's true that's right what do you think about it brother Toms it's right if missionaries are needed it's here I don't say this through slur I say this through reverence and respect but an educated Heathen is harder to deal with than an uneducated Heathen and what does the word heathen mean unbeliever that's right one who's smart self-sufficient you can't deal with him let one that knows he knows nothing he'll know Christ in a little bit if you'll tell him that's right they won't try to figure nothing out he just believes in that settled it tens of thousands coming a time now look this way I won't take up no more time I feel that the holy spirit is here God is always here but I believe his presence here now through this audience especially here where I can see pling in the audience because I've been preaching hard and in this audience if the holy spirit will come and perform the same Miracles right here from this platform into that audience that he did when he was on Earth how many will say it'll increase my faith and make me happy now we won't even we want people out of the audience all around wherever you are now just be reverent and set Qui just for a moment I just want to look at this side and pray I have no way in the world uh if somebody would come here if this man raise up and say brother brand what's wrong and my mother was laying here and say Billy what's wrong with me honey I nursed you when he was a baby I took care of you I fed you I what all I've done for you honey what's my outcome I wouldn't know God would have to tell me to my poor mother I have no way of controlling it it's God's grace that does it the same grace of God but you're sick people many of you here and I God wants to heal you and he's already done it he just wants your faith to believe it now let's just try to go across the audience one way or the other let's look in this way and how you people over here go to praying and just saying God be merciful to me and pray and I'll just watch how do you do it what do you see brother brandom there's something takes place there's know me trying to explain it but this spirit that you see on the picture that's scientific if this is my last message tonight remember my word is the truth because the Bible says it's a truth my Ministry proves it's a truth the holy spirit in it and the scientific world knows it's the truth so there's the three Witnesses may God give us three Witnesses here tonight at least three people if God will do that I'll be happy about it three people I just prayed and be real Reverend wherever you are in the building doesn't matter all way at the back Wherever You Are see there's lots of spirit everything's a con every one of you is a spirit everyone's a spirit if you wasn't you wouldn't be here I hear I hope that the audience will look at me at this time just watch I'm standing right here right in between here and where that step goes down there you see that circle of light that little light circle cing there now that's the light that's on this picture I just now appeared if I say in the presence of it and in my Bible and before the creator of heavens and earth I believe that that's the same light the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel I believe that Pillar of Fire was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ I believe that Jesus Christ set on Earth according to to his word I come from God I go back to God and I believe that when he returned back he returned back to that same light that led the children of Israel I believe that that is the same light that Paul saw on his road that was so bright to him and struck him down although those who was with him did not see the light I do not know where anyone sees this or not I can't say I believe it's the same light that come into the prison that night with Peter the Apostle and he dream when the prison doors open and let him out I truly believe that almighty God is the creator of heavens and earth and Jesus Christ is his son who is present now and he's answering prayer to a
