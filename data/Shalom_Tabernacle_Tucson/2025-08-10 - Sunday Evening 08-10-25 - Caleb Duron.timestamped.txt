[19:35] like an eagle to the sky
[19:40] above the peaks my soul can be found.
[19:48] An unexpected
[19:50] storm
[19:52] may drive me from the high.

[21:19] &gt;&gt; And that's not to say we don't have
[21:21] sympathy for whatever you're going
[21:22] through. But when David was at his
[21:25] lowest point in his life, says he
[21:27] encouraged himself in the Lord.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; So I want to take some notes from from
[21:31] him and we read so many psalms that
[21:33] encourage us. And that's what he did. He
[21:35] put on the garment of praise for the
[21:37] spirit of heaviness. So let's do that
[21:39] tonight. Put on the garment of praise
[21:43] for the spirit of heaviness. Oh, lift up
[21:48] your voice to God.

[31:58] together. The brothers could come prayer
[32:00] request. There were a couple that were
[32:02] turned into me and I'll just read those.
[32:03] Brother Ben, as you're coming to read
[32:05] the rest of them, our sister Vogle had
[32:07] turned in a couple. One to remember a
[32:10] good friend of Terry Vogel and also a
[32:14] request for Kelly from Austin,
[32:17] Texas. She has cancer. The doctor has
[32:19] not given her any hope. Amen. But we
[32:22] serve the great physician. He
[32:24] specializes in the impossible.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[32:28] Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Bless you all.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; Want to remember those uh this morning a
[32:39] prayer for the the wheels that are going
[32:42] through and I have a funeral this Friday
[32:44] for Sister Wa.
[32:46] And we want to remember Sister Snow for
[32:49] her quick recovery.
[32:51] And also uh we want to remember our
[32:54] deacon here uh brother Joe Galante. He's
[32:57] having surgery or he had surgery for
[32:59] quick recovery.
[33:01] And um I just kind of want to say
[33:04] something about him. Uh he I got since I
[33:06] got to know him, we I see him out in the
[33:08] foyer. We were here early
[33:12] and he is such a humble sweet brother.
[33:17] He's the real deal.
[33:20] And um
[33:21] He's always concerned about his dog.
[33:23] He's got a dog that's that uh he eats
[33:27] rocks and his uh intestines is full of
[33:31] rocks and he's real concerned.
[33:34] And I was thinking, does does God care
[33:37] about our pets? Yes, he does.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. Because
[33:41] when the prophet went over to the
[33:45] to the other side, he said his little
[33:47] dog Fritz was right there and his horse
[33:51] pit nicker was there. So he cares about
[33:54] our pets.
[33:56] We just want to pray for them. And I
[33:59] want to pray for my four daughters that
[34:00] are traveling along with the Pope
[34:03] sisters this week that God would watch
[34:07] over them
[34:09] &gt;&gt; and give them a grand time over there.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:14] We're we're a very privileged people.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; It's uh we were hearing this morning
[34:20] that um
[34:22] we can't lose in this race. We're the
[34:24] winners in this race because if we go
[34:28] before the rapture, the prophet said we
[34:31] it's a limousine ride to the sixth
[34:34] dimension.
[34:36] And if we we go in the rapture, you
[34:38] know, it's we get a body change. We
[34:40] can't lose. We're the winners of this
[34:42] race.
[34:44] And we were in God's thoughts. The
[34:47] prophet said before the foundation of
[34:48] the world.
[34:50] And the prophet taught us that a word ex
[34:53] a thought is a word expressed. So we
[34:56] were before the word. So we're the his
[35:00] thoughts expressed. So we're the word
[35:01] expressed.
[35:03] Believe it or not, you're going to say
[35:05] me. Yeah. You little me and you. We got
[35:08] to accept it and believe it. Thank you.
[35:12] Let uh any anybody I left off. Oh the
[35:16] who's this sister? Oh, you already read
[35:18] it. Okay. Let us pray.
[35:22] Lord Jesus, how we thank you this this
[35:25] evening, Lord, that you allowed us to
[35:27] come here, Lord. I don't have the
[35:30] vocabulary, Father, to express the
[35:33] gratitude that's in my heart, Lord.
[35:37] Oh, Father, that you chose us. You
[35:39] elected us before the foundation of the
[35:41] world, Lord God. And here we are
[35:44] manifested.
[35:46] Why? I don't know, Lord, but I I love
[35:48] you with all my heart, Lord. Thank you,
[35:51] Lord. Pray for the sick and the
[35:53] afflicted, Lord. Those that are going
[35:55] through hard trials and sicknesses,
[35:58] Lord, I pray and intercede for them with
[36:02] with with
[36:04] compassion in our hearts, Lord. This
[36:06] sister that they don't give her a chance
[36:08] to live, Lord, but you're the one that
[36:11] has the last word, oh God. We pray that
[36:14] you would come on the scene for her,
[36:16] Lord. And brother uh Galante, Lord, be
[36:20] with him, Lord. Restore him back to us,
[36:22] Lord. We love him, Lord. Such a humble,
[36:24] sweet brother, Lord. He's a testimony to
[36:27] me, Lord. Thank you for him, Lord. Pray
[36:31] for the the ministry, Lord. I pray for
[36:34] the the brother that's going to bring
[36:36] the word. pray that you would use him in
[36:39] a mighty way, oh God, that you would
[36:42] anoint him, Lord. Anoint his heart, his
[36:44] lips, his mind, that he would speak
[36:47] words of eternal life to us, Lord. I
[36:49] pray that be with brother Israel, Lord,
[36:52] and all his all the things he does,
[36:55] Lord. May you lead him, guide him, and
[36:56] direct them, Lord. So, we're here to
[36:58] worship you, Lord. Why shouldn't we
[37:00] worship you with all our hearts, Lord?
[37:03] Oh God, if we can only
[37:06] [Music]
[37:07] realize and open our eyes who we are and
[37:11] why you you called the prophet here. You
[37:14] told them go to Tucson.
[37:16] Why? It's getting so personal me to me
[37:20] that I believe it was because I was
[37:22] going to be born here. Oh, thank you,
[37:25] Father. I love you with all my heart and
[37:27] soul. Thank you Lord for we ask these
[37:30] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[37:33] Christ. Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] [Music]
[37:41] Just look for
[37:44] in his wonderful
[37:47] [Music]
[37:48] face.
[37:52] And the things
[37:55] over
[37:58] will grow strangely
[38:01] dim
[38:04] in the light
[38:06] of his glory
[38:10] and grace.
[38:12] [Music]
[38:13] Amen. You can be seated if you'd like. I
[38:16] thought we were going to have three
[38:17] specials and it looks like there's none.
[38:19] So, if you don't mind if I sing one for
[38:23] you this evening,
[38:24] &gt;&gt; and we can all just worship together on
[38:26] this. I'll have the words up, but just
[38:29] wanted to share a quick praise. When
[38:32] brother Ben was talking about God being
[38:34] mindful of the pets, and he one of
[38:37] brother Joe's dogs has rocks in his
[38:41] intestines. We have a dog that I think
[38:42] may have rocks in his head. He's not
[38:44] he's not real bright,
[38:47] but um I know the Lord is mindful of
[38:50] him. And so this last week we uh we were
[38:53] somewhere and garage door opened up and
[38:56] it looked like a little lizard went
[38:58] running across and I looked at it. I'm
[39:00] like, "Oh, that's not a lizard. It was a
[39:01] big scorpion running." And so me looking
[39:04] at it then then our dog Rufus saw it and
[39:07] he goes, "Oh." So he went to do what he
[39:09] normally does with lizards and went and
[39:11] put it in his mouth
[39:13] and Roffus put that down. He dropped it.
[39:16] No bite, no reaction. So his eyes on the
[39:19] sparrow was on Rufus this week. And I
[39:22] know Rufus means a lot to me. My license
[39:24] plate is his nickname, T- Rof. So he
[39:27] it's it's a it's a sickness that I have,
[39:29] but
[39:30] he knows the things that are important
[39:32] to us and and his eyes on the sparrow,
[39:35] his eyes on on the dogs, and his eyes on
[39:37] me tonight. And that's the encouraging
[39:40] things. I know that if he doesn't allow
[39:41] that dog to pick something up that's
[39:43] going to harm him, how much more does he
[39:45] care about what you and I are going
[39:46] through. Amen. The key of Eflat. Sister
[39:49] Jesse, you know that song till the storm
[39:51] passes by.
[39:54] Out on the water,
[39:58] storm raging high.
[40:01] The waters around them were troubled
[40:06] that night.
[40:09] Fear filled their hearts
[40:12] and they thought they would die.
[40:16] They failed to remember
[40:19] that the master was nigh.
[40:23] But he spoke the word
[40:26] and the winds all stood still.
[40:31] Even the waters
[40:34] they obeyed his will
[40:38] and he calmed their storm
[40:41] just like he will mine.
[40:45] If I'll just remember
[40:48] that he lives deep inside.
[40:52] So why should I worry?
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] Why should I fear
[41:00] when this very same Jesus,
[41:04] he stays always near.
[41:07] He lives in my heart
[41:11] and he hears when I cry.
[41:15] I'll call on his name
[41:18] till the storm passes by.
[41:23] [Music]
[41:26] Now we read in the Bible
[41:30] how he walked with them,
[41:33] brought light to their darkness.
[41:37] When the way grew so near,
[41:40] how great it would be
[41:44] to have his steps lead in mine and to
[41:48] walk with the master
[41:52] all of the time.
[41:55] So when trials come
[41:59] and death is so nice,
[42:02] I just search for the master.
[42:06] I know we'll be there on time.
[42:10] And when I'm in trouble
[42:13] and my body is in pain,
[42:17] all I have to do
[42:20] is call on his name.
[42:24] So why should I worry? Stand as we sing
[42:28] it together. I fear
[42:31] when this very same Jesus,
[42:35] he stays always near.
[42:39] He lives in my heart
[42:42] and he hears when I cry.
[42:46] I'll call on his name
[42:50] till the storm passes by.
[42:54] [Music]
[42:55] [Applause]
[42:56] [Music]
[43:06] Hallelujah.
[43:08] [Music]
[43:09] My heart.
[43:11] [Music]
[43:20] One more time. Why should I worry? Why
[43:23] should I worry?
[43:28] I feel
[43:32] Jesus.
[43:35] [Music]
[43:49] passes.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[43:58] Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[44:02] Amen. Welcome to the house of the Lord

[44:18] of you than it is us and uh we
[44:21] appreciate your support of your pastor
[44:23] to come and speak for us tonight.
[44:26] Brother Caleb has had me speak for him
[44:28] many many times over the years. He's
[44:31] always had an open door there and uh it
[44:34] worked out this time for him to come and
[44:37] speak for us this time.
[44:39] when he brought us that apple pie and
[44:41] that cherry pie, I had no choice. I got
[44:46] But we're uh we go way way back and I
[44:49] appreciate brother Caleb and what the
[44:51] Lord has done for him and so we look
[44:53] forward to what the Lord is going to do
[44:55] through his ministry tonight. Amen.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Did you come expecting?
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. All of you are welcome. God bless
[45:03] you. Thank you for coming. It's a few

[50:03] Am I on? Okay. Just making sure. Uh God
[50:07] bless you. I greet you in the name of
[50:09] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; And on behalf of the Amazing Grace
[50:12] Temple, we thank you for the invitation
[50:15] and your fellowship and your
[50:16] hospitality. Most of all, I want to say
[50:18] thank you with all respect to my brother
[50:20] Israel for giving me this opportunity to
[50:23] come and be a blessing to you in the
[50:26] house of God. Amen. I know that the
[50:29] enemy personally has been fighting me
[50:31] tooth and toenail ever since I came
[50:33] back. We came back from Los Cusus, New
[50:36] Mexico. And I think it's wonderful to
[50:38] know that. And I my wife, I'm not sure
[50:41] you she agrees with me or not, but I
[50:44] said it's kind of flattering uh to know
[50:46] and realized that I've upset him that
[50:48] bad
[50:49] to where he won't back off. And I said,
[50:52] I wonder what else I can do to irritate
[50:54] the enemy tonight. And I think this is
[50:56] going to irritate him. So, how many's
[50:58] glad to irritate the enemy?
[51:00] &gt;&gt; I don't say that carelessly now because
[51:02] I know that he he has a job to do and
[51:05] he's very good at it. Very good at his
[51:07] job. But God is better at his job. So,
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I wasn't going to say anything, but
[51:13] since he said it, I wanted to make sure
[51:15] I Yeah, I'm going to be there, too. So,
[51:17] that's going to be good. It's going to
[51:18] be a nice time. U excited to go. I've
[51:21] been there before to Columbia. Really
[51:22] enjoy. The weather up there is really
[51:24] nice. Uh it's the same all like most of
[51:28] the time. It's just really comfortable.
[51:30] So, anyhow, may God bless you and thank
[51:33] you for having me once again. uh if you
[51:35] wouldn't mind, would you turn in your
[51:37] Bibles to uh Genesis the 18th chapter? I
[51:40] try not to take too much of your time.
[51:42] Um but whatever he wants to do, we'll
[51:44] do.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; And uh you saw I bring a towel with me.
[51:48] I I get really sweaty and so it doesn't
[51:50] mean that I'm anointed necessarily. I
[51:52] just sweat a lot. So uh but we'll see if
[51:55] the Lord will anoint his servant tonight
[51:58] to preach his word. We had a great time
[52:00] this morning and I I asked brother
[52:02] Israel said did y'all have a good
[52:03] service last Sunday morning and he said
[52:05] we did matter of fact I said so did we.
[52:07] So did we and it just we're in the same
[52:09] neighborhood. So I expected if we have
[52:11] one y'all are going to have one
[52:12] &gt;&gt; and if y'all have one we're going to
[52:14] have one. So uh and and that's a it's a
[52:18] it's a marvelous thing. We uh had an
[52:20] incident, if you don't mind, just a
[52:22] couple more things where uh I was
[52:24] beginning to preach and all of my
[52:26] deacons ran out the door.
[52:29] I said, "Well, this isn't good." You
[52:30] know, I turned around told Brother
[52:32] Jesse, "Is it something I said?" You
[52:33] know, and he said, "No." And somebody
[52:35] said, "Somebody jumped the fence."
[52:37] &gt;&gt; And you know, in this neighborhood,
[52:40] well, in this world, we don't know
[52:42] what's going on, right?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; And so I just said, "Well, everybody
[52:45] stay calm. We'll just kind of see what's
[52:46] going on." and and here comes this
[52:48] little bitty lady come walking in the
[52:50] door and I said, "Man, all you guys went
[52:52] out there, of course, on the camera, you
[52:54] couldn't tell that it was a lady. She
[52:56] had jumped the fence. Um, she wanted to
[52:58] come to church and she saw the gates
[53:01] shut because we shut them during service
[53:03] and she didn't let that stop her. She
[53:06] jumped over the fence. And I said, "Man,
[53:08] you know, with all of us believers that
[53:10] come up with every excuse not to be in
[53:12] church,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; here's this lady who had never been
[53:15] there before, never heard me preach,
[53:17] never heard the word the way we preach
[53:19] it. She didn't care. She wanted to jump
[53:21] the fence." So I was like, "Uh, next
[53:23] time just stand there. We'll open it for
[53:25] you." But uh, the Lord said something to
[53:28] me. Are you ready?
[53:29] He said, "Do not take for granted what I
[53:32] have freely given you when there are
[53:34] people who are willing to jump over
[53:35] fences and kick down doors and run
[53:37] through walls to get what others have
[53:38] rejected."
[53:40] &gt;&gt; So, we are a blessed people.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; We are a blessed people. We are the
[53:44] bride of Christ. And I do believe that
[53:46] with all my heart and I know that the
[53:48] day is getting closer because he is so
[53:51] he has ramped up his attack. But the
[53:54] Lord has also ramped up his protection.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, blessed be the name of the
[53:58] Lord. Uh, Genesis 18 and kind of a
[54:02] different way to interpret this
[54:05] scripture, but it's verse 10 and 10
[54:08] only. And excuse me, I'm not sick. It's
[54:11] allergies. And uh just, you know, I
[54:15] don't say my allergies. Does anybody say
[54:17] my allergies? Don't say it's my They're
[54:20] not my allergies, they're just
[54:21] allergies. uh you know like someone says
[54:23] oh my diabetes is acting up or my you
[54:26] know crooked neck or tubercul they said
[54:29] I had bcitis and I go what's that is
[54:32] that like you know elder person type
[54:33] thing and they said no you've developed
[54:35] bcitis and I go well no I haven't my
[54:37] body thinks it has but we're not going
[54:38] to have that either but it doesn't
[54:40] belong to us it belongs to the enemy
[54:42] amen
[54:43] &gt;&gt; so uh and it says here uh and he oh and
[54:47] he said I will certainly return unto
[54:50] thee
[54:51] &gt;&gt; according to the time of life.
[54:55] And lo, Sarah, thy wife shall have a
[54:58] son. And Sarah heard it in the back in
[55:00] the tent there, and she laughed. Amen.
[55:03] So, may the Lord add a blessing to the
[55:05] reading of his word. Father, I love you,
[55:08] and you know this. And I pray, dear God,
[55:11] that you do what you are capable of and
[55:15] just get me out of the way as I yield to
[55:17] you, Lord. Let your word be manifested.
[55:20] We pray. Bless those that have come.
[55:22] Bless those that are watching wherever
[55:25] they might be. And I thank you for
[55:27] already hearing me already in Jesus
[55:30] Christ's name because there is no other
[55:31] name greater. Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Um I'm going to preach on uh using some
[55:40] quotes from the seals uh that I have. I
[55:43] want to kind of kind of provoke you in a
[55:46] friendly way if I could that if you
[55:48] haven't and I know that brother Israel
[55:50] we talked about that you you were kind
[55:51] of in the seals not too long ago weren't
[55:53] you?
[55:54] Yeah. Well, I'm going to say this
[55:56] though. I want to kind of provoke you to
[55:58] if you haven't read your your seals in a
[56:00] while, if you haven't heard the sermons
[56:02] in a while, to take some time and go
[56:05] back and listen as there's so much in
[56:07] there that I think that we have either
[56:09] through the years ignored or overlooked
[56:12] or bypassed and uh I don't believe that
[56:16] God waste time.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; I don't believe that his prophet wasted
[56:20] time.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; So, let me ask a question here then. Um,
[56:24] so we know that brother Brandham said
[56:26] that there was an angel of the Lord come
[56:27] every night and tell him exactly what
[56:30] that seal was. Is that right?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; So then when he got up until he got to
[56:35] the seal took maybe an hour, an hour and
[56:36] a half for him to get there.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham had the answer
[56:40] already.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; So why didn't he just come out and say
[56:42] it?
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Right? Was he just wasting time?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; No.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Was he just wasting words?
[56:48] &gt;&gt; So you agree that everything that
[56:50] brother Brandham said had a purpose
[56:51] behind it? Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; So here's where here's where I stand on
[56:55] that. Brother Brandham, the revelation
[56:57] of the first seal starts with paragraph
[56:59] one and runs all the way to the end.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Same with two, three, four, five, six,
[57:04] and seven. It isn't just the seal
[57:06] itself.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; There's a lot more in there.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Green said that people were on
[57:11] the edge of their seats. He said they
[57:13] were waiting for that punchline. Brother
[57:15] Brandham said they he could count on his
[57:17] hand how many people knew what was going
[57:18] on. Is that right? But see, we're not
[57:21] that generation, and it wasn't time for
[57:23] them to see it or understand it. We're
[57:25] of another generation. I believe that
[57:26] Jesus said, "This generation shall not
[57:29] pass away till all these things be
[57:31] fulfilled."
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Right? And there's come a time where you
[57:34] say, somebody said to me, they said,
[57:35] "Well, brother," they said, "Well,
[57:36] brother Caleb, why didn't we ever see
[57:38] these things before?" I said, "Because
[57:39] it wasn't time."
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And that's why I use that scripture. I'm
[57:42] going to visit you according to the time
[57:44] of life.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to visit you to a place where
[57:48] you give you have another birth. You
[57:51] bring forth another birth, right?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a re a born again
[57:55] experience that we're after. We're born
[57:57] again every day. How many understands
[57:58] that?
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Someone said, "How can you say that
[58:02] we're born again every day?" Well, I
[58:04] said, "You tell me how we can repent and
[58:05] die daily, and I'll tell you how we can
[58:07] be born again every day."
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Right? You you can't just keep dying.
[58:10] You got to be born again. And this
[58:12] message, uh, it never stalled. It
[58:15] doesn't it didn't grow dim. It's not
[58:17] it's lost its popularity to the
[58:19] unbeliever.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And that's okay with me because that
[58:22] means that there's more food for me.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; You ever had that?
[58:26] &gt;&gt; You have people invited over and some
[58:28] people don't show up. We all What do we
[58:30] say? That's all right. That means
[58:31] there's more for me.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; So if you don't want to take it, you
[58:33] don't want to accept it, that's all
[58:34] right. That means there's more for me.
[58:36] Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; So we are in this hour and the
[58:39] opportunity has arisen where the Holy
[58:41] Spirit is showing us that there is more
[58:44] in here not just the punchline. Now look
[58:47] the the the the horse riders and so
[58:49] forth that would have happened anyway
[58:51] whether you know about it or not.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; You understand that? But what else is he
[58:56] saying in there?
[58:57] &gt;&gt; What else is he saying to to to dress
[59:00] you for a wedding?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? It's not just the seal
[59:05] that's stressing you or the the punch
[59:06] line. I'll say it like that. It's
[59:08] everything in the from paragraph one to
[59:10] the end. Everything is said for a
[59:12] purpose.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; It's not just wait for this, wait for
[59:16] that. It's for a reason. God's prophets
[59:19] don't waste time.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; They don't stand behind the pulpit and
[59:23] just talk.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Even his jokes had something behind it,
[59:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Even even the what they call mistakes.
[59:31] Even the the little oops I you know said
[59:33] it one way he didn't rewrite the Bible
[59:35] friends. If he said it wrong one wrong
[59:37] one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong
[59:37] one wrong one wrong one wrong one wrong
[59:37] one wrong one way it was okay he said it
[59:38] wrong whatever but even that was for a
[59:40] purpose
[59:41] &gt;&gt; because then you got somebody come along
[59:43] and say well the prophet made mistakes
[59:44] well I'm not going to say that even if I
[59:46] think he did I wouldn't say it
[59:48] &gt;&gt; you understand what I mean and then I
[59:50] wonder well since you're busy counting
[59:52] brother Brandon's mistakes have you
[59:54] counted yours lately
[59:58] &gt;&gt; tell me how many you got and then we'll
[59:59] sit down and talk about how many he's
[1:00:00] got Right.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I've had people say, "Well, people make
[1:00:03] too much out of Brother Brandham." Okay,
[1:00:05] fine. If you don't want me to talk about
[1:00:06] him, I won't talk about him. Here, let
[1:00:07] me ask you something. What great thing
[1:00:09] have you done
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; that would match up to what Brother
[1:00:13] Brandham has done?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; He's done. When he said, uh, laying on
[1:00:17] his bed there, I'm just warming up. That
[1:00:18] okay with you?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; He said, uh, while I'm laying there, he
[1:00:24] said, how old was he going to be? He's
[1:00:25] in his 50 or something like that. And he
[1:00:27] said, if I'm ever going to do something
[1:00:28] for the Lord, I better get started. I
[1:00:31] thought to myself, what do you mean?
[1:00:32] Look at all the stuff he's already done.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; So, if he felt that way, how should I be
[1:00:37] feeling at 48?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; I haven't done anything. If that's the
[1:00:40] way he feels, I don't measure up.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; But yet, we want to say, "Oh, you make
[1:00:45] too much out of him." Okay, fine. If you
[1:00:46] don't want to hear it, like I said,
[1:00:48] that's more for me.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; So, I took some time a few years back
[1:00:52] and I've been doing it again and I'm
[1:00:54] going to continue to do it. I don't want
[1:00:55] to leave it because every time I glean
[1:00:57] through it again, there's something else
[1:00:59] there that I can enjoy.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; There's something else there that pops
[1:01:02] out says, "Hey man, look at this. Hey,
[1:01:03] look at this." And I'm finding out that
[1:01:05] we are in the hours of absolute no
[1:01:08] hidden mysteries and everything is going
[1:01:10] to be revealed now.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; That it was already there. It's been
[1:01:13] there the whole time, but we didn't have
[1:01:15] the spiritual insight that we do now
[1:01:17] because God is anointing us with the
[1:01:20] Holy Ghost to now see what we've never
[1:01:22] seen before.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that all right?
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, you mean you're
[1:01:27] interpreting it?" I'm not interpreting
[1:01:28] anything. I'm reading what he said,
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; and now I see what it means to me or how
[1:01:33] it fits.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So, just for the next few
[1:01:37] minutes, is it all right if I share a
[1:01:38] couple?
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; I call it seven sealed nuggets.
[1:01:44] You can't find nuggets if you don't sift
[1:01:47] through the sand.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; You can't find nuggets if you're not
[1:01:50] going to read it.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; You're not going to find it if you don't
[1:01:53] listen. You're not it's not going to do
[1:01:54] you any good. Look, if you have gold
[1:01:55] nuggets and you don't use them, it's not
[1:01:57] going to do you any good.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; So, if you got something you find from
[1:02:00] the from the from the the message here,
[1:02:02] if you get it, you better apply it.
[1:02:04] Otherwise, it's not going to do you no
[1:02:05] good.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Right? Use it. Amen. All right. So,
[1:02:08] let's go here. Uh let's go to the first
[1:02:10] one in the first seal.
[1:02:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I had a I had my seal book rebound.
[1:02:22] Isn't that cool?
[1:02:23] I got seven little. Anyway, I like it.
[1:02:27] I I I I I could get a new one and I did.
[1:02:30] But brother, you know, when yours is
[1:02:31] already marked up, it's got all the
[1:02:33] quotes highlighted that I enjoy. I got
[1:02:35] all my T. I said, I just couldn't part
[1:02:37] with it. So, I just want it rebound.
[1:02:40] Sister, she said, "My Bible's falling
[1:02:42] apart." I said, "I could re get it
[1:02:43] rebound for you." She goes, "Yeah." She
[1:02:45] said, "It's just got everything
[1:02:46] highlighted." You know, old tears, stain
[1:02:49] drops, you know, where God told you
[1:02:51] something.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Why do you want to get rid of it? Just
[1:02:54] hold on. Don't give those things. Your
[1:02:55] old Bible. Hold on to that. Will you do
[1:02:57] it?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; It means something. Remember, God spoke
[1:02:59] to you with it. All right. That's for
[1:03:01] free. Okay.
[1:03:04] There's something here that he says that
[1:03:05] I really enjoy because there's enough
[1:03:09] people. Can I take my jacket off? Is
[1:03:10] that all right? Thank you, brother. Uh
[1:03:13] there there's enough people and I don't
[1:03:15] know about you because maybe you're all
[1:03:17] perfect.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Maybe you ain't ever done nothing wrong.
[1:03:21] Okay, but brother Caleb ain't outside of
[1:03:24] the blood. Brother Caleb's done a few
[1:03:25] things that he's not proud of. All
[1:03:27] right. So, but there's enough people in
[1:03:30] the world or at least in the city that
[1:03:32] likes to remind you
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; of how bad you've been
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; or what mistakes you made 25 years ago.
[1:03:38] Like you still hung up on that,
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; right? There's people who like to remind
[1:03:43] you that that there's there may be a
[1:03:44] slim chance you're not going to make it.
[1:03:47] And those people who talk that way have
[1:03:49] got no idea who Jesus is.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; They got no idea what his blood is
[1:03:54] capable of.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; They have no idea what his grace can do.
[1:03:58] They don't know what it's like to be
[1:04:00] completely 100% forgiven.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; In the sea of God's forever as though
[1:04:06] you've never done it in the first place.
[1:04:09] So, I feel sorry for people like that.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Who are you to say that someone's done
[1:04:14] something wrong? So, that's enough of
[1:04:16] that. Let me read something that says
[1:04:18] the opposite. Okay. All right. Let me
[1:04:20] see where' I start at.
[1:04:24] 79. Good. I'll read it like this. Be
[1:04:26] easier for me. Maybe we getting old,
[1:04:29] brothers. There we go. All right. And
[1:04:32] how I love this, brother. And I'm not
[1:04:35] going to give a a quote before and all
[1:04:36] that because look, just take it. All
[1:04:38] right, go look it up. I want to provoke
[1:04:40] you to go and read it again. And how can
[1:04:44] a man say that the bride of Christ goes
[1:04:47] through the tribulation? You know those
[1:04:49] people who think that?
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I had to tell our young people when I
[1:04:52] did a Bible study because they all
[1:04:54] thought they had to go through
[1:04:55] tribulation. I don't know where they
[1:04:56] they didn't get it from me. I said, "Who
[1:04:59] taught you this stuff?" And they all
[1:05:01] think they used to think that they would
[1:05:02] have to stand before the judgment
[1:05:04] throne.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; No, we don't.
[1:05:07] I said, "No, we don't."
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; All right. So, look, it said here, I
[1:05:12] can't understand it. The prophet said,
[1:05:14] "She has took away from tribulation." If
[1:05:17] the church has been judged and they have
[1:05:20] judged themselves and have adopted
[1:05:22] accepted the blood, how can God judge a
[1:05:26] man that's perfectly totally sinless?
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Uh, oh, wait a minute. Highlight the
[1:05:33] rest of you. He said they reborn. He
[1:05:35] said somebody say, "You say there's no
[1:05:36] such a person." Brother Brandham
[1:05:38] continues. You see this meant something
[1:05:41] to me
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; because not only does Jesus tell me I'm
[1:05:44] forgiven, but now the prophet is telling
[1:05:46] me that I am perfect.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for someone to get excited
[1:05:51] somewhere.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He said this. Every born again believer,
[1:05:55] how many is born again?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; How many is born again? Okay. Then every
[1:05:59] born again believer is perfectly
[1:06:02] absolutely sinless before God.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; So that means something to me because if
[1:06:15] you want to bring up my sins, I'll just
[1:06:16] send him a quote.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Because you're trying to use a quote to
[1:06:19] condemn me. I'll send you a quote that
[1:06:21] sets me free.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; See, this is bride material.
[1:06:26] This is part of your first seal
[1:06:28] revelation
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; that the first seal broke open. This was
[1:06:32] part of it.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; The angel of God told Brother Random,
[1:06:36] "Make sure you tell them that they are
[1:06:38] absolutely totally without sin before
[1:06:42] God."
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Tell them.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; See it. He said before God, he is not
[1:06:54] trusting in his works in the blood of
[1:06:59] Jesus.
[1:07:03] That his confession
[1:07:05] has dropped into the Bible said he that
[1:07:08] is is born of God does not commit sin.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Now look,
[1:07:15] this not a get out of jail free card,
[1:07:16] okay? Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Don't go around doing goofy things and
[1:07:19] saying, "I didn't do it. The Bible said
[1:07:21] I didn't."
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; You need to have a conscience.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You need to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; It'll keep you from doing
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; goofy. All right.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:07:36] uh oh. That God does not um No.
[1:07:41] Where was I?
[1:07:45] Oh, how Okay. Yeah. does not commit sin.
[1:07:47] Thank you. For he cannot sin. How can
[1:07:50] you make a man a sinner when the bleach
[1:07:55] of the blood of Jesus Christ is between
[1:07:58] him and who?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And who?
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; So who is your accuser then? Is you see
[1:08:06] when we go around condemning one another
[1:08:07] or condemning fellow churches? Well,
[1:08:09] they believe this, they've done that.
[1:08:11] You better leave that stuff alone. Amen.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; See, I I I know some things about some
[1:08:16] people, you know, we all do, right? But
[1:08:18] who am I to judge?
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; If I if I know, and I I like saying like
[1:08:23] this, if I give the brother the benefit
[1:08:26] of the doubt by now, he's made it right.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Or at least I'd hope so.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Well, why not be like Job? Huh? Job made
[1:08:35] sacrifices just in case.
[1:08:41] just in case his children did something
[1:08:44] wrong.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; So why don't we act like that then?
[1:08:47] Instead of judging and spreading uh evil
[1:08:50] little lies, why don't we get down and
[1:08:52] say, "Lord, just in case the brother
[1:08:54] hasn't made it right yet, I want you to
[1:08:56] know, Lord, that I'm sure brother or
[1:08:59] sister so and so didn't mean to be that
[1:09:01] way.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; If they haven't asked for forgiveness,
[1:09:04] Lord, I'm asking you to forgive them of
[1:09:07] their sin.
[1:09:11] See, that's how you know you're a
[1:09:12] Christian.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; When you get down and pray for somebody
[1:09:15] who did something against you,
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; and say, "Lord, I know they didn't mean
[1:09:18] that."
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; All right. Can I look?
[1:09:23] Uh,
[1:09:25] why don't you get lost? Okay. But okay,
[1:09:27] it is. Um, that Thank you. that would
[1:09:31] scatter sin till there be nothing left
[1:09:35] of it. Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus has annihilated
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; your sin.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Scattered it
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; to where there's no proof.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Destroyed it.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Utterly done away with it.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And let me say this, not just the sin of
[1:09:56] today, but the sin of yesterday
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and today. And whatever you're going to
[1:10:02] do tomorrow, Jesus has already
[1:10:04] annihilated it.
[1:10:11] makes me feel good.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Uh, how far did I go on that one? What
[1:10:17] quote? I mean, what paragraph here?
[1:10:19] Thank you.
[1:10:22] I keep doing that. See, I get excited
[1:10:24] and I lose my place.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; We got you. Come on up here, brother.
[1:10:30] All right. With scatter sin till there
[1:10:32] be nothing left of it. How can the pure
[1:10:35] blood of Christ ever let a sin pass by?
[1:10:40] This is something you find in the first
[1:10:42] seal.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know, the seals, the
[1:10:45] seals, I don't even believe. Okay,
[1:10:47] brother, you you're focused on the wrong
[1:10:48] thing.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; It's in there
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; and it's always been in there.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Look, I don't need a show of hands and
[1:10:55] you don't have to. But if you want to be
[1:10:56] honest, I'll tell you, did you really
[1:10:58] even think about reading the rest of
[1:11:00] this stuff?
[1:11:02] Huh? Maybe you all did, right? Because
[1:11:04] you spiritual,
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; you know, but back in the day, I fast
[1:11:08] forward the tape because I wanted to
[1:11:09] hear what the seal said.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest, right? I was
[1:11:14] brand new and somebody said, "You got to
[1:11:15] hear what the seal said." Why is he
[1:11:16] talking all this stuff? I fast
[1:11:17] forwarded.
[1:11:19] Didn't realize what was in there.
[1:11:23] Oh, it's pure gold.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be you therefore perfect,
[1:11:28] even as your father in heaven is
[1:11:30] perfect." And how could we even start
[1:11:33] the thought of being perfect? But Jesus
[1:11:36] required it.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus required it, he has got to
[1:11:40] make a way for it.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love it?
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; And he has made a way for it.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; He's taking care of it already.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And he has his own blood.
[1:11:56] Now all reveals now all reveals all the
[1:12:00] mysteries that's gone on in the past.
[1:12:02] Now the thought is here at the end time
[1:12:05] that that the mysteries that began way
[1:12:07] back long ago has come down through the
[1:12:11] church ages. It is to be revealed here
[1:12:14] in the breaking of these seals. Look, it
[1:12:16] was written but it was a mystery. But
[1:12:18] now you and I, we see it perfectly
[1:12:20] clear.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a
[1:12:25] debt I could not pay. I needed someone
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; to wash my sins away.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't realize that before.
[1:12:34] No, but now you see it wide eyed.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You know what it is.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; You're not religious about it either.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; It's caused you to fall in love with
[1:12:42] him.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; It's caused you to want a relationship
[1:12:47] with this person called Jesus.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:54] I did it again. Thank you. Who's Thank
[1:12:57] you. I appreciate that. All right. Right
[1:12:59] here, brother Gilly. Here in the last
[1:13:00] days, breaking the seal. Here the last
[1:13:01] days after the time of intercession is
[1:13:04] just about finished.
[1:13:06] If he said that in 63, where are we at
[1:13:08] now?
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be caught outside the
[1:13:13] gate?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; He's interceding for you now.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you take advantage of his
[1:13:19] intercession between us and God?
[1:13:21] Lord, don't forget the thing I did
[1:13:23] yesterday.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Cover me once more.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Draw me nearer just a little closer. One
[1:13:31] more time.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Fill me up one more time.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Seal me, Lord. One more time.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Glory. Lord, whatever you do, don't
[1:13:43] leave me.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's not going to. But still, Lord,
[1:13:50] whatever you do, don't leave me.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; I like that. Till the storm passes by,
[1:13:55] just stay with me.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; It's a promise.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be with you, even in you,
[1:14:01] even until the ends of the world."
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Are we good for that?
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; I think we're done. All right. Say,
[1:14:09] "Praise the Lord."
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; That's your first seal.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Part of it. Just a little Just a little
[1:14:15] something there
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; that we don't even look at.
[1:14:19] Well, we know all that stuff from the
[1:14:20] Bible. Well, yeah, but you never paid
[1:14:22] attention to it till now,
[1:14:24] right?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand didn't need to waste time.
[1:14:28] He could have come right up and just the
[1:14:29] seal is this, the seal is that. But all
[1:14:32] those people didn't gather for 10
[1:14:34] minutes. They needed something more.
[1:14:38] And if the angel of the Lord thought
[1:14:40] enough to include it, then we ought to
[1:14:42] think enough of it to listen to it
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; and apply it. If if he says that you're
[1:14:48] sinless and you're perfect before God,
[1:14:50] then I want to apply that very principle
[1:14:53] to my life.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You don't need to walk around like I'm
[1:14:56] perfect. No. If I'm perfect, then I want
[1:14:58] to act perfect.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; I want to behave perfect.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I want to live as perfect as possible.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; I want to live to where I don't
[1:15:07] displease him.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; I want to live up to the word
[1:15:12] perfection.
[1:15:16] [Applause]
[1:15:18] Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] When he sees me, he sees the blood of
[1:15:23] the lamb.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know that's true?
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; God don't see nothing. Then why do we
[1:15:29] repent for your own conscience sake? And
[1:15:31] you were instructed to. But you ought to
[1:15:34] be glad that he don't see it.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; You understand that now? That's
[1:15:38] scripture, right? But there's coming a
[1:15:40] time if intercession is almost over,
[1:15:42] then that bloodb must be lifting up a
[1:15:44] little bit.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying it's gone. I'm not
[1:15:47] going to go there. But brother, we want
[1:15:48] to make sure we catch them before it
[1:15:50] takes off.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Take advantage of the blood tonight.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Make everything you can, right?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And if you make it right, don't do it no
[1:16:00] more.
[1:16:02] Nobody said amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; If you if you make it right, don't go do
[1:16:06] it again.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:09] you can't. Well, I did it again, Lord.
[1:16:11] First of all, he didn't know you did it
[1:16:12] because it's in this it's forgotten.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; But that don't give you a right to
[1:16:15] continue to do what you just because,
[1:16:18] you know, if I go out last night, all I
[1:16:20] got to do is repent and I come to church
[1:16:21] and I'll still do what I got to do
[1:16:23] because I was repentant. I know I I got
[1:16:25] this. It's not a game.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Man, the Holy Spirit is not even
[1:16:30] innocent for thinking that way.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; I don't want to live like that because
[1:16:35] it makes him unpleased with me.
[1:16:38] I want God to see Jesus inside of me.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You know what else I want? I want the
[1:16:45] world to see Jesus inside of me.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed you're going to the
[1:16:51] store lately, Home Depot, something like
[1:16:53] that, that you're not kidding either.
[1:16:56] This is kind of I don't know how to take
[1:16:58] this. But either people are attracted to
[1:17:00] you and they want to talk to you or I've
[1:17:02] seen people look, they don't even know
[1:17:04] me and they're in a hurry to get out of
[1:17:06] out of the aisle. I'm like, what is
[1:17:07] going on here? Their spirit sees your
[1:17:11] spirit
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; and that demon don't want nothing to do
[1:17:13] with you.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; And I kind of feel bad about that. I'm
[1:17:17] like, "Hey, I'm not going to kick you
[1:17:19] out today,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; come back, and won't talk to you. They
[1:17:22] don't want to talk to you." But then
[1:17:23] there's other people that see you and
[1:17:24] they want to talk about Jesus. Just like
[1:17:26] that.
[1:17:28] her little cousin here, she's got a some
[1:17:31] weird ability to invite her friends to
[1:17:32] church and they show up.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; All she does is say, "Guys, want to go
[1:17:38] to church?" Yeah. Where's it at? Over
[1:17:41] here. You know what's crazy? What's even
[1:17:44] more nuts? They haven't left.
[1:17:47] [Applause]
[1:17:54] I believe these young people are going
[1:17:55] to carry us on into the resurrection.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; The 11th hour workers going to come in,
[1:17:59] they're not going to have time to sit
[1:18:00] down. Brother Brandham said this, not
[1:18:01] going to have time to sit down and study
[1:18:03] and pray and fast. He's going to be born
[1:18:04] with teeth. They're going to skip the
[1:18:06] milk and go right into the stake. And
[1:18:07] they're going to have the faith to get
[1:18:09] us who have been alive and waiting to
[1:18:11] get out of here.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; There will not be another generation
[1:18:14] after us. We're going home. Somebody
[1:18:17] say, "Amen." Praise God. We're going
[1:18:19] home.
[1:18:21] [Applause]
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; We've been waiting for this.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; It almost seems unreal.
[1:18:29] I
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; I think about that all the time. Like,
[1:18:30] man, is this really happening?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; We've seen more of Brother Brandham's
[1:18:35] prophecies come to pass in the last
[1:18:37] eight months
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; than we saw since he's been gone.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Here's there's one. There's another one.
[1:18:43] You know, here and there's one. But the
[1:18:45] last eight months, boom, boom, boom,
[1:18:46] boom, boom.
[1:18:48] You know what's odd is brother Brandham
[1:18:50] said in his own words, "I don't see
[1:18:53] anything left to happen
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; except the coming of the Lord."
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I'm like, the same brother who said
[1:19:00] California, this and this, none of that
[1:19:01] stuff has happened. And then he went on
[1:19:03] to say, "Everything that's left can be
[1:19:06] done in the next five minutes."
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Well, nothing happened, but look where
[1:19:10] we're at now.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; How many more events do we need to see
[1:19:14] come to pass before we take it
[1:19:16] seriously? Yeah, I had people tell me,
[1:19:18] "Well, when I see my dead mother come up
[1:19:21] from the grave, I'll know it's time."
[1:19:24] Well, now that person's dead,
[1:19:28] both gone.
[1:19:30] I'm going to tell you what. I'm not
[1:19:33] going to die.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't care if y'all say amen or
[1:19:37] not. I know I'm not.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna stay, Brother Israel. We gonna
[1:19:41] stay alive till the coming of the Lord.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And even if I did die at 90, you're
[1:19:46] going to hear me at 90 going, "I ain't
[1:19:47] going to die. I'm going to stay here
[1:19:49] till Jesus comes. You just put me up
[1:19:51] here in the walker and I'm going to say
[1:19:53] the same thing that I'm saying right
[1:19:55] now." But somebody is going to believe
[1:19:58] this word and somebody is going to hear
[1:20:01] it, act on it, and do something about
[1:20:03] it.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Will you be that person?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's get to
[1:20:09] the second nugget in the second seal.
[1:20:14] Hallelujah.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; This kind of hit me out of left field. I
[1:20:20] wasn't expecting this one when I
[1:20:22] actually read it in front of our own
[1:20:24] church and I stopped and I went, "Wait,
[1:20:27] did I just read that?" Let's go back and
[1:20:30] hear this again. So, here's what
[1:20:31] happens.
[1:20:34] See, Satan raises those up talking about
[1:20:38] Antichrist and false prophets.
[1:20:40] Watch the shrewdness of this fellow. You
[1:20:44] know the devil don't ever come at you in
[1:20:46] plain view. You know that, right?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's wrapped up in a beautiful girl
[1:20:50] or a handsome man. Don't nobody want to
[1:20:53] say amen again. I think that's funny.
[1:20:56] Come on, young people. Say amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Right. He He wraps up in money. He wraps
[1:21:00] up in nice cars. You know what I mean?
[1:21:02] He nice He wraps up in nice careers. He
[1:21:05] wraps himself in ministries.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. to entice you. You know,
[1:21:11] because the pulpit is attractive.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; It is. It looks like power and
[1:21:16] authority. I'll tell you what, anybody
[1:21:18] want my job, you can have it.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. I say it all the time.
[1:21:22] Is you better be called of God to get
[1:21:25] behind a pulpit.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; You don't just get up here and talk cuz
[1:21:28] anybody can do that.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Anybody. But are you ready for what
[1:21:32] happens afterwards? The fight that comes
[1:21:34] down the road,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; that big old target that's on your
[1:21:37] front, on your back, on your face. Huh?
[1:21:40] Somebody say, "Well, I think I got I'm
[1:21:41] ready to be a pastor." Said, "Really?
[1:21:43] You really?" I said, "Well, here's my
[1:21:44] notes and here's my Bible." Oh, and
[1:21:47] here's my phone. What I need your phone
[1:21:49] for? You'll find out.
[1:21:54] 90% of the min of our of of being a
[1:21:56] pastor is nowhere near this desk.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Nowhere. All right,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Mitch. All people call you up and tell
[1:22:02] you how wrong that is and and then share
[1:22:05] all their ideas. You're going, "Oh, man.
[1:22:08] What was I thinking?" You weren't. God
[1:22:09] called you. All right.
[1:22:11] How'd I get on that
[1:22:15] anyway? Oh, yeah. He's shrewd. There it
[1:22:17] is. He'll He'll wrap himself up in a
[1:22:20] talent of yours.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Brand said, "Money,
[1:22:25] women, and popularity." Right now, I've
[1:22:28] always thought that means he's going to
[1:22:30] have a lot of women or a lot of money or
[1:22:31] he's very popular. But what about the
[1:22:33] opposite? What about the lust for those
[1:22:35] things?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; What about I want to be so popular that
[1:22:39] you'll assassinate characters to be that
[1:22:41] guy?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; What if you're you're you're you want to
[1:22:46] be rich so much that you'll defraud the
[1:22:48] church and steal their money?
[1:22:51] What about if you you have a a you want
[1:22:54] women or this and that that you'll
[1:22:55] commit adultery and oh no no no just so
[1:22:57] you can have what you want
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; either way you look at it'll destroy
[1:23:00] you. Do you see people that got a talent
[1:23:03] and they think they're so good? He come
[1:23:04] around. They ought to be singing how
[1:23:06] great I am
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; instead of how great thou art
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; because they're full of themselves. He's
[1:23:12] shrewd now.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; They'll get into your brain and say,
[1:23:14] "Well, you know, you're better than that
[1:23:16] one.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You know, this church is better than the
[1:23:19] other one,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; If if brother Caleb was doing his job,
[1:23:24] why'd he move Israel over here? Brother
[1:23:25] Israel over here?" He actually told me
[1:23:28] that the devil did. if you were doing
[1:23:30] your job. How come brother Israel came?
[1:23:31] I said, "Shut up."
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I said, "To help me beat you up."
[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:41] Huh?
[1:23:44] I did say that too out loud. I could
[1:23:46] have helped me beat you up. I didn't
[1:23:48] hear nothing no more. I'm like, "Where'd
[1:23:50] you go?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; What happened?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; You got nothing to say."
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm messing. You know how I am. I
[1:23:57] don't Go ahead. I'll tell you. All
[1:23:58] right. So watch how true he is.
[1:24:01] All right. Watch the shrewness of this
[1:24:03] fell that we're talking about here.
[1:24:04] Satan
[1:24:07] when we're unfolding him right here.
[1:24:10] Hold on, brother Caleb. You know the
[1:24:12] seals are about revealing Jesus. Yeah.
[1:24:15] You know who else revealed? The devil.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you're too busy looking for the
[1:24:21] the next big doctrine, you missed the
[1:24:23] whole point.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; You see? Hey. Yeah. Well, you know what?
[1:24:28] A lot of the false doctrines that come
[1:24:29] out come out of here.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Because they're looking at just the
[1:24:33] seal. They weren't looking at the rest
[1:24:36] of the story.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Where's the balance in it?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Where's the take every word? I used to
[1:24:42] find that interesting that somebody
[1:24:43] would say, "Say every word. Say every
[1:24:45] word." I'm sitting there going, "But you
[1:24:46] don't even live every word."
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; You mean you want me to say every word
[1:24:53] you think is right. But that's just the
[1:24:55] enemy enticing people to feel and
[1:24:59] believe and think they're the next big
[1:25:01] shot. You know what? It's strange, huh?
[1:25:04] There ain't no big shots left.
[1:25:06] Respectfully speaking, they're all gone.
[1:25:09] It's just us.
[1:25:13] It's just us. And we are walking where
[1:25:16] none of them have ever walked before.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; We ain't got no Moses
[1:25:21] right now.
[1:25:23] We don't have Elijah in front of us. You
[1:25:25] get what I mean?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; But I I I think it's strange. We're in
[1:25:28] the last church age. Is that right? Just
[1:25:30] leave that up. We'll be all right. I'll
[1:25:31] be back in a minute.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Right. We're in the last church age.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, as an example, when the
[1:25:41] children of Israel walked out,
[1:25:45] there was a pillar of fire in front of
[1:25:46] them and the prophet was at the front.
[1:25:49] Joshua and Caleb was up there. All the
[1:25:51] generals and leaders, they were all up
[1:25:52] there. You know, somebody's got to be
[1:25:55] last in line.
[1:25:57] Somebody has to. Not everybody can be at
[1:26:00] the front. They didn't walk like this.
[1:26:01] They walk like this. You get what I'm
[1:26:02] saying? So when the enemy start to chase
[1:26:05] them, who are they going to see first?
[1:26:08] The people at the back of the line.
[1:26:11] The seven church age.
[1:26:14] You the one getting hit the hardest.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Paul didn't have to put up with the
[1:26:18] stuff we were going through now. None of
[1:26:20] these guys did. They none of them have
[1:26:22] internet. Bro, Levi, all those uh uh
[1:26:25] details and points that you brought last
[1:26:27] time you was there about all this
[1:26:28] selfies and everything else. I'm just
[1:26:30] like I don't Wow. You know what I'm
[1:26:32] proud of? Every week my phone time goes
[1:26:35] down more and more and more because I
[1:26:38] realize I don't need it that much.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; I've started leaving in the car when I
[1:26:42] go in the store.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; I go in the shop. I want to take my time
[1:26:46] except for when Sister Anne sends me for
[1:26:48] something because I know if I'm in
[1:26:50] there, she's gonna want to ask me for
[1:26:52] something else because I do that to her
[1:26:54] all the time. Hey, while you're there,
[1:26:56] right? But you get what I'm saying. So,
[1:26:57] you're at the back of the line. You're
[1:26:59] the one who's dealing with everything
[1:27:01] the devil has.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just regular
[1:27:04] oldfashioned demons.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; We're not. We're talking about the elite
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; of Satan's army.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; We're talking about green berets, if you
[1:27:13] will. We're talking about n uh the
[1:27:15] devils seals get it that they have
[1:27:19] special anointings
[1:27:21] and they're not just trying to attack
[1:27:23] your body, your flesh or this and that.
[1:27:25] Their only job is to infiltrate your
[1:27:28] mind.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; That's why today the greatest battle
[1:27:32] ever fought is such a powerful sermon to
[1:27:34] listen to.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; You have to know your enemy.
[1:27:42] He certainly knows you.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, he knows all about you.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; He's been studying man for a long time.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; But I wish he'd get a revelation.
[1:27:53] Oh, I do. Not that he would be my
[1:27:55] brother, but that he's not going to get
[1:27:58] me
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; because I've been predestinated, too.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm not predestinated to fail.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I've been predestinated to live.
[1:28:12] Do I have to believe that? Go ahead.
[1:28:14] Praise God for it.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; There is a difference between believing
[1:28:22] and knowing.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I don't have to believe I'm his son
[1:28:26] anymore. I know I am.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I had to have faith and believe
[1:28:30] until I have that revelation. And for
[1:28:32] other things like money, I still have to
[1:28:34] have faith and believe it, right?
[1:28:36] Because I don't know where it's going to
[1:28:37] come from. You know what I'm saying? But
[1:28:38] if you're going to ask me if I'm his
[1:28:40] son, I'm not trying to believe it. I'm
[1:28:42] not working up faith. I know
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; that I'm his son.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't have to believe it. Jesus
[1:28:48] didn't have to have faith. He knew who
[1:28:50] he was.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; And you and I need to know in this last
[1:28:54] day exactly who we are.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; How many knows?
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You sure you know
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; if the devil came in your face, get out
[1:29:02] of here, man. You know who who my daddy
[1:29:04] is. You better scram, buddy. Huh? That's
[1:29:08] right.
[1:29:09] Get it.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So, we're at the back of the line. Then
[1:29:14] we're there and like the children of
[1:29:15] Israel, back of the line and they turn
[1:29:18] around and they see Pharaoh's chariots
[1:29:20] coming after them. And they start
[1:29:22] running and screaming because the first
[1:29:23] ones to get taken down is going to be
[1:29:24] them.
[1:29:26] But you see, all of a sudden,
[1:29:29] the pillar of fire that was at the front
[1:29:30] of the line
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; came to the back of the line
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; and stood between God,
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I mean, the enemy and God's people.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Today, the same pillar of fire that was
[1:29:43] at the front of the line
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; is at the back of the line,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; standing between us and the enemy.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Do you believe? Say amen.
[1:29:55] Hallelujah. So watch the shrewdness. All
[1:29:58] right. We're talking about here Satan.
[1:30:01] We're unfolding him right here. I guess
[1:30:04] this is why I upset him the other
[1:30:06] weekend. Now it's all Now it's all
[1:30:07] becoming clear to me. But I'm not going
[1:30:10] to back off. Why should I?
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; He don't back off of me.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you wish he'd like just give you a
[1:30:16] break?
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Like you know in boxing you got to you
[1:30:19] know ding you know you rest. Yeah. He
[1:30:23] don't know what a thing is. All right.
[1:30:27] Just stripping him down by the
[1:30:29] scriptures and letting you see who he
[1:30:32] is.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; See, that's what is supposed to be done.
[1:30:36] Brother Ken, where'd you find this? In
[1:30:38] the second seal.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; It's all part of the revealing of the
[1:30:44] second seal.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; It's not an accident. If he would have
[1:30:49] just went to the second seal brothers or
[1:30:51] he would have never said this stuff and
[1:30:52] we'd be okay. Now what?
[1:30:56] And you remember
[1:30:58] he has not tried to go in and be a
[1:31:01] communist.
[1:31:03] Nope.
[1:31:05] Satan hasn't.
[1:31:07] He's an antichrist.
[1:31:10] So close that Jesus said
[1:31:14] would deceive the very elect. Scripture
[1:31:16] go on and say if possible. All right,
[1:31:21] you ready? Here's what I got that I love
[1:31:23] so much. And that's the ones that who
[1:31:26] the elected
[1:31:29] that's hid down in these seals.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait,
[1:31:37] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So, you're
[1:31:39] telling me that my name is written
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; in Revelation the sixth chapter?
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:47] Well,
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; I read it. It don't say Caleb nothing.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; It don't say nothing about the bride. It
[1:31:52] don't say nothing about it. Just all
[1:31:53] these mysteries, but your name
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; was put there
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; and Satan never saw it.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; He hid them. And when they were loosed,
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; your name went out.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Oh man,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; your name went out. And suddenly your
[1:32:12] mom and dad had the inspiration. Name
[1:32:14] him Israel.
[1:32:16] Name him Caleb. Name him Jesse. Why?
[1:32:19] Because that name has been hid there
[1:32:22] right there before the foundation. Glory
[1:32:25] to God.
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; There's your second seal.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, but it broke and your name
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; has been let loose forever.
[1:32:40] When the river Euphrates gave up those
[1:32:42] demons,
[1:32:43] the seals gave up your name.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; The mystery of who you are and where
[1:32:51] you're going has been revealed.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; No wonder the devil don't like you no
[1:32:55] more. A
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; we broke up. It's all right. I don't
[1:33:00] even miss him.
[1:33:02] He ain't done nothing for me and I'm
[1:33:04] tired of it. I'm tired of the abuse.
[1:33:07] Right? You know what I'm talking about.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Whose names are in the book since the
[1:33:14] foundation of the world. He's a shrewd
[1:33:16] fellow.
[1:33:18] And when he sees this thing coming
[1:33:21] coming up, then he throws everything he
[1:33:24] can out there to upset it before it gets
[1:33:28] there.
[1:33:32] That's what he did to me before I ever
[1:33:36] became what I am now. He did everything
[1:33:38] he could to disrupt God's plan.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; How many's got the same story?
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; How many is grateful it didn't stop you?
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop God's predestination.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; It didn't stop God's plan for you. It
[1:33:53] might have slowed it down just a bit,
[1:33:56] but it didn't stop it.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:02] Where's the arrow? I need the arrow.
[1:34:04] All right. He throws everything he can
[1:34:06] out there to upset it before it gets
[1:34:08] there. Did you know there will be false
[1:34:10] Christs
[1:34:11] arrives in the last day? It should
[1:34:14] follow immediately after this. After
[1:34:16] what the seals?
[1:34:18] It did, didn't it? That's another nugget
[1:34:21] because now we have a time frame. Now we
[1:34:23] know what we're working with.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know about y'all, but I
[1:34:26] wouldn't even I wasn't even born
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; when this came out. So respectfully
[1:34:33] speaking, I'm glad that they didn't
[1:34:34] catch the revelation then
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; because I wouldn't have been here to
[1:34:38] hear it.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; See, but my name was hidden.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; So they had to wait until this time. I'm
[1:34:45] going to visit you according to the time
[1:34:48] of life.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Why is he doing it now? Because I'm
[1:34:51] going to visit you according to the time
[1:34:53] of life.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to give you revelation
[1:34:56] that'll cause a rebirth.
[1:34:59] Oh, not just a simple born again
[1:35:00] experience, but a born from a Christian,
[1:35:03] a simple Christian to a bride of Jesus
[1:35:05] Christ.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; You're more than a Christian. You are a
[1:35:09] believer that has been given the PS. I
[1:35:12] love you.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Here's your love letter. Here's your PS.
[1:35:16] I love you.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And all those things written there that
[1:35:20] were hidden before the foundation of the
[1:35:21] world. And he didn't let nobody see it
[1:35:24] till he let us see it.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Oh man. I tell you what, if brother
[1:35:28] Brandon was here, he'd probably be
[1:35:29] saying, "Amen." I know he'd be saying,
[1:35:30] "Amen." Of course, I wouldn't be
[1:35:33] preaching. We We lay him preach, right?
[1:35:38] Uh
[1:35:40] oh, thank you. You're so nice. Okay. It
[1:35:43] should fall immediately after this,
[1:35:44] after this great message that this uh
[1:35:48] brother will speak that will actually
[1:35:50] come. He's talking about himself.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:53] be anointed
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; in the spirit of Elijah immediately.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; But he didn't wait. He didn't wait very
[1:36:00] long, did he?
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; And they'll mistake him. Some of them
[1:36:04] will think he is the Messiah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Really? They sure did.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; But he'll strictly say no because he's
[1:36:11] got to come in like John.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what happened in
[1:36:16] in Los Cruises. The anointing of Elisha
[1:36:19] fell on us both and it blessed us with a
[1:36:22] double portion of revelation. So much so
[1:36:25] I'm not saying we're Elisha. I hope you
[1:36:26] understand what I mean. Just that
[1:36:28] anointing has got to be on the bride.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; The double portion of what he has
[1:36:32] preached all the thus sayith the Lord
[1:36:34] etc. has got to be double in your life.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; If you don't have thus sayith the Lord,
[1:36:39] go back and check. Why? Because you
[1:36:41] should.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. If you're not dressed by now
[1:36:46] for the wedding, you better come to an
[1:36:48] altar and find out. Because by now,
[1:36:50] brother, if you've been walking in this
[1:36:52] 45 years, why aren't you dressed yet?
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I'm getting dressed,
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; I am dressed.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Well, you got some wild ideas, man.
[1:37:09] Okay, it don't matter what you think.
[1:37:11] I'm only saying what he said
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and believing it.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; All right. All right. That's good right
[1:37:17] there. Do you love him?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read all of them
[1:37:21] because last time I did that took me two
[1:37:23] and a half hours.
[1:37:25] There's a lot a lot of fun though. But
[1:37:27] I'm going to read you the last one. Got
[1:37:29] to find the seventh seal.
[1:37:32] I'm going drink some water.
[1:37:35] I always feel bad drinking in front of
[1:37:37] y'all. I turn around.
[1:37:42] My church be like,
[1:37:47] I just turn around. All right.
[1:37:50] The seventh seal is controversial.
[1:37:53] I don't know why. Do you know why? I
[1:37:56] could never figure it out. Like, what's
[1:37:58] the big deal? Why is everybody fighting
[1:38:00] over this?
[1:38:01] Well, it's open, but or it's closed, but
[1:38:05] okay, it's open. That's the bottom line.
[1:38:07] Whether we know all of it or part of it
[1:38:10] doesn't matter. It's still open. That
[1:38:13] means that we're allowed to believe that
[1:38:15] what we don't know will be revealed
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; either by us or a short quick work
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; when the prophet does come back.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, you didn't believe in return,
[1:38:25] brother. I said, "What do you mean I
[1:38:26] don't believe in return?" They all got
[1:38:28] to come back. That's
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; If I die, I got to return.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; What's so hard to understand about that?
[1:38:35] I don't know about the rest of it.
[1:38:36] That's up whatever. I'll tell you what
[1:38:38] I've always told people this. If you
[1:38:39] believe that you should look for a tent,
[1:38:42] that's fine. I don't have that
[1:38:43] revelation. But here's the thing. If
[1:38:44] there's going to be one, don't worry.
[1:38:45] I'll be there.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Jump on a bandwagon? No. No.
[1:38:50] Because I'll be predestinated to be
[1:38:51] there.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; You don't you get it? I wasn't looking
[1:38:54] for Jesus, but he found me.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:02] I wasn't looking for grace, but it found
[1:39:04] me.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for baptism in the Holy
[1:39:07] Ghost, but guess what? It found me.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking to be a pastor, but it
[1:39:13] found me.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; I wasn't asking for these revelations,
[1:39:17] but they found me.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And if there's going to be a tent, don't
[1:39:20] worry. I'll be there. It'll find me.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You see it? All I was told to do is look
[1:39:25] up.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Look up. Watch you therefore and pray.
[1:39:30] That's all I was told to do. But in the
[1:39:32] meantime, we don't stop for nothing.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Don't get narrow-minded either. I don't
[1:39:36] want to close any idea out.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; If you got someone who's going to help
[1:39:39] me get further along, well, I want to
[1:39:41] hear it.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost inside of you ought to
[1:39:45] tell you if it's wrong or not. Say,
[1:39:48] "Well, that whole sermon was wrong."
[1:39:49] Don't go out criticize it. Just take,
[1:39:50] Brother Brand said, "Take the cherries.
[1:39:52] Throw out the pits." Our cherry pie
[1:39:55] don't have no pits. Just saying.
[1:40:01] All right.
[1:40:06] We must remember that the seventh seal
[1:40:11] is the end of time
[1:40:14] of all things.
[1:40:16] Is that right?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. The things written in the
[1:40:20] seventh seal book sealed up the of the
[1:40:25] plan of redemption from before the
[1:40:27] foundation of the world. remembered us
[1:40:29] when you were put in the seals.
[1:40:32] My name I can't get beyond that. My name
[1:40:34] was in the seals, brother Israel. Let's
[1:40:37] if you want to go look in Revelation
[1:40:39] chapter 6. Do you see any names listed
[1:40:40] there?
[1:40:42] But I see mine there now.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's wonderful.
[1:40:48] All right. Before the foundational
[1:40:50] world, it every bit ends.
[1:40:54] It is the end. It is the end of a of the
[1:40:59] struggling world. Oh, I I like this. I
[1:41:02] really do because it makes me feel good
[1:41:04] because it's the end of the struggling
[1:41:07] nature.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; It's the end of everything.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; It's the end of the trumpets. It's the
[1:41:15] end of the vials. It's the end of the
[1:41:19] earth. It's the end of time. Time runs
[1:41:24] out. The Bible says so.
[1:41:28] Right. Matthew the 7th chapter, I mean
[1:41:31] Revelation the 7th chapter. I'm reading
[1:41:32] how he says it. He goes on say, "Okay,
[1:41:34] time runs out." The angel said, "What
[1:41:38] time will be no more?"
[1:41:42] What? When then in the days of this
[1:41:45] great things happening going to happen?
[1:41:49] Everything runs out in this time in the
[1:41:52] end of the seventh seal. bonus. It's the
[1:41:55] end of the church age. Somebody say,
[1:41:57] "Praise God for that."
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; The end of the seventh seal. It's the
[1:42:02] end of the trumpets, end of the vials.
[1:42:04] It's even the uh and even even in the
[1:42:08] ushering in of the millennium. In other
[1:42:10] words, the end of the ushering in, which
[1:42:13] means the millennium is now set an end.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; There's got to be an ushering in. And
[1:42:21] that comes to an end once it's here.
[1:42:23] You got it.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So, what else can we say on that? That's
[1:42:26] the seventh seal, he said. So, where's
[1:42:29] the arguments?
[1:42:31] Where's the misunderstanding?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; How is that personal, brother Caleb?
[1:42:35] Well,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; it's the end of my struggle.
[1:42:42] It's the end of my wondering.
[1:42:44] It's the end of prayer.
[1:42:49] It's the end of begging God.
[1:42:52] It's the end of pleading.
[1:42:54] It's the end of uncertainty.
[1:42:57] It's the end of sin. Oh, come on.
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; It's the end of temptations.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; It's the end of failures. It's the end
[1:43:11] of being backslid ever. It's the end of
[1:43:15] life on earth is to be with God and ever
[1:43:19] so be with the Lord.
[1:43:21] It's the end of all things.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; It's the end of religion.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said it. I ain't taking it back.
[1:43:29] I'm tired of religious spirits.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; That religious demon is the worst one to
[1:43:33] deal with.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You can pray for someone, they'll forget
[1:43:36] cigarettes. You can pray and they'll get
[1:43:38] drugs and they'll pray and get their
[1:43:40] life right. But man, a religious demon
[1:43:42] makes you think you ain't got nothing to
[1:43:44] worry about.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's the worst one.
[1:43:49] It's the end of that, too.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; It's the end of the devil's power over
[1:43:53] us.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; It's the end of his grip on my neck. As
[1:43:58] a matter of fact, what happens is I get
[1:44:00] a grip on his neck.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; I I implore you, go back and read it.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Take your time. Get inspired. Don't get
[1:44:18] in a hurry. Instead of watching your
[1:44:20] favorite show, put on a seven seal
[1:44:22] message.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; So, I ain't got no time for that. You
[1:44:24] really don't have time for that. But you
[1:44:26] got enough time on Facebook, don't you?
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Clock your hours, man. Clock your phone
[1:44:30] hours.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not my business. I'm
[1:44:32] meddling. But I tell my people the same
[1:44:34] thing. So, if you're part of shalom, act
[1:44:36] like I'm not talking to you, okay? I'm
[1:44:37] going to talk to them. Don't get rid of
[1:44:39] social media. It's a waste of your time.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; It's a waste of God's time. It's
[1:44:45] something that's between you and him.
[1:44:46] When you could be praying,
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; when you could be studying,
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; when you could be seeking his face,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; when you could be getting another
[1:44:53] feeling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not We're not church. You
[1:44:57] don't always get a feeling of the Holy
[1:44:59] Ghost in church.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; I got one time in a Walmart checkout
[1:45:04] line.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's the truth. Yeah. True story.
[1:45:09] You want to hear it? It goes like this.
[1:45:11] We'd come back from Phoenix Tabernacle
[1:45:12] youth meetings up in Hebrew
[1:45:15] and we had a wonderful time. Spirit fell
[1:45:17] out and everything. I think brother
[1:45:18] Jesse it's when you went for the first
[1:45:20] time and I you know I don't know about
[1:45:22] you brother Israel but when I come out
[1:45:24] of meetings like that it's kind of hard
[1:45:25] on me the next couple of days. You know
[1:45:27] devil's coming after you. You're tired.
[1:45:29] You're weak. You just want to lay down.
[1:45:32] You feel like you're not victorious
[1:45:33] anymore. I don't know why that happens.
[1:45:35] You find a juniper tree somewhere. You
[1:45:36] know,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I started feeling like, man, did I say
[1:45:40] everything right? You know, man, I need
[1:45:42] to get those tapes, find out what I
[1:45:43] said. I don't know. Devil, man. The
[1:45:45] devil, right? I think God allows it,
[1:45:47] too. So, you don't get too full of
[1:45:49] yourself.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Then I'm in the checkout line and all I
[1:45:54] said was, "I just need to know if I'm
[1:45:56] going to make it." And I heard a sweet
[1:45:58] little voice said, "I already said you
[1:46:00] would."
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; So, I got teary eyed and I looked up and
[1:46:04] this bright light just
[1:46:06] And I started crying man uncontrollably.
[1:46:09] Not like boohoo just like you know I
[1:46:11] mean could add a bucket. And I get next
[1:46:14] lady goes are you all right? And I go
[1:46:16] she goes absolutely. Then she started
[1:46:18] crying. She had no idea what's going on
[1:46:19] with her. And I get in the car. Brother
[1:46:21] Ellie is just waiting for me. Looks me
[1:46:23] goes what happened to you? And he starts
[1:46:24] shaking. He starts crying and we're just
[1:46:26] worshiping God.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; But you weren't anywhere near church.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I am a church.
[1:46:35] I am a temple.
[1:46:38] [Applause]
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; You are the bride's revival.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; You know that cop's not coming back for
[1:46:47] people who never did nothing wrong.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; No, he ain't coming back for Pharisees
[1:46:51] and Sadducees now.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; He's coming back for people that need
[1:46:55] his grace all the way to the end.
[1:47:00] [Applause]
[1:47:04] Lord, I need you once again.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; He's coming back for people that can't
[1:47:10] live off their own marriage. Brother
[1:47:12] Joe,
[1:47:13] I can't make it on my own.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to make it with my virtues
[1:47:19] or or my my testimony because I don't
[1:47:22] want to get there and sound like, "Lord,
[1:47:24] didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't I
[1:47:25] because we know what happened to them.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I haven't done nothing yet.
[1:47:31] And I can't make it with that.
[1:47:34] I'm only going to make it. You know,
[1:47:36] we've heard this before. We say we're
[1:47:37] going to get there and people are going
[1:47:40] to ask you, "How did you make it through
[1:47:41] that horrible age?"
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Right? How'd you get there? How'd you
[1:47:46] make it through disease and internet and
[1:47:47] all that? And you think you're going to
[1:47:50] stand there, wow,
[1:47:53] give me a couple of hours is going. No,
[1:47:54] you know what you're going to do?
[1:47:56] Amazing.
[1:47:59] Grace,
[1:48:01] how sweet.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Well, but yeah, you going to tell me
[1:48:05] your testimony. I am that same. All
[1:48:08] right. Like who? Like me.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; How'd you make it? I was lost, but now
[1:48:15] I'm found.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; I was blind, but now I see.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; That's how we're going to tell our
[1:48:21] story.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; This is my story.
[1:48:26] This is my song. I'm praising my savior
[1:48:30] all the day long. Walking into heaven
[1:48:32] just praising God. I'm so glad that I
[1:48:35] made it here.
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:42] I've heard people say, it's going to
[1:48:45] sound funny, but I heard people say, "If
[1:48:46] I get to heaven and they're there, I'm
[1:48:47] leaving."
[1:48:49] I go, "Well, brother, don't worry about
[1:48:51] it. You won't be going
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; with that kind of attitude.
[1:48:56] The prophet of God said, "When you get
[1:48:57] there, you'll be surprised he made it."
[1:48:58] You know why? Because he's talking about
[1:49:00] me. Jail Drawn got here. Yeah. And his
[1:49:03] cousin got here, too.
[1:49:08] Huh?
[1:49:10] Tell you a little something to lighten
[1:49:12] you up a little bit. There's this guy
[1:49:14] who died.
[1:49:15] Peter's showing him around. Baptist.
[1:49:18] They're worshiping God. Catholics.
[1:49:23] Oh, y'all don't think Catholics are
[1:49:24] going to be there.
[1:49:26] Some of them will. The real Catholics
[1:49:28] that only had that much light. You get
[1:49:29] it? There's going to be somebody from
[1:49:32] every church age.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; It isn't. Well, here we go. Then there's
[1:49:36] Methodists are there. And who are all
[1:49:39] those over there screaming and shouting,
[1:49:40] "Oh, those are Pentecostals.
[1:49:42] Hey, you want to see something?" Guy
[1:49:43] says, "Yeah." He said, "Come here." Open
[1:49:45] the door and there's a whole group of
[1:49:46] people worshiping.
[1:49:48] Who's that? He goes, "Oh, they're
[1:49:49] message believers." But they think
[1:49:51] they're the only ones here.
[1:49:56] Don't get that.
[1:49:58] Don't get that attitude.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Don't get that attitude. The Bible said
[1:50:05] Jesus will Jesus was willing that none
[1:50:07] would perish.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I thank you, Father, for all
[1:50:09] that are in my hand. I won't lose one.
[1:50:11] Not one.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; Not one."
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Aren't you happy for that? Amen.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I I I I'll say this and I don't I don't
[1:50:20] care how it sounds. I get criticized for
[1:50:22] all the time. I said, "As far as I'm
[1:50:23] concerned, everybody's going to go."
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to leave nobody out.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; That's not my job.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; My job is to get as many as I can into
[1:50:34] the kingdom.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we're all going to
[1:50:37] spend eternity together.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, pastor. Would you bow your
[1:50:40] heads?
[1:50:43] Father, we love you. I thank you for
[1:50:45] this short time you give us.
[1:50:49] I don't know
[1:50:51] what'll happen after this. If there'll
[1:50:53] be criticism or the enemy I know the
[1:50:54] enemy is going to come, but I pray, dear
[1:50:57] God, that you would look out after our
[1:50:59] two fellowships,
[1:51:01] our two flocks that are just down the
[1:51:04] street.
[1:51:06] We we may not understand it, but I've
[1:51:08] heard from different brothers and they
[1:51:09] turn around and say people all over the
[1:51:11] world
[1:51:13] know that you all are that close.
[1:51:16] It may not seem like a big deal.
[1:51:20] Well, maybe we don't see how big it is,
[1:51:22] but this has been an expression of what
[1:51:25] two brothers
[1:51:27] who love God can agree to have a a work
[1:51:32] next door to each other
[1:51:34] and not be critical or fighting against
[1:51:37] the other.
[1:51:39] I ain't got no time for that. It's like
[1:51:42] I'd said before, I'm glad he's here.
[1:51:45] That just means that we whoop the devil
[1:51:47] twice as hard in this area every time we
[1:51:49] all come together. We may not be in the
[1:51:52] same four walls, but we are in the same
[1:51:53] spirit.
[1:51:55] We are in the same under the same
[1:51:56] anointing,
[1:51:58] the same Holy Ghost, covered by the same
[1:52:01] blood. Lord, I pray
[1:52:04] I pray that you bless this little
[1:52:07] church.
[1:52:08] Make it Lord
[1:52:11] great in your eyes.
[1:52:14] Let the pews be filled. Every last one,
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Lord. And if if mine never fills up, I
[1:52:20] don't matter. Just let this one fill up.
[1:52:23] It'll be all right. Give us whatever we
[1:52:26] have coming, Lord. And let us be good
[1:52:28] stewards with what people you send our
[1:52:30] way. For they're not brother Israel's
[1:52:32] people. They're not my people. They're
[1:52:34] your people. And I want to remember
[1:52:36] that. Bless brother Israel, Lord, and
[1:52:38] his wife for the invitation and the
[1:52:41] hospitality to let us come.
[1:52:44] I love you, Lord, with all that's within
[1:52:48] me. I will love you, Lord, if everything
[1:52:52] is stripped away and taken away. As long
[1:52:54] as I still have you, Lord, I'll still
[1:52:57] love you. I know. I mean that with all
[1:53:00] my heart. I've seen it come close to
[1:53:03] her. Sister Anne's gotten sick or when
[1:53:05] our little girl was born and she almost
[1:53:07] passed. Lord, I just sat there and I
[1:53:09] said, "Lord, whatever you do, I'll still
[1:53:11] love you, but you kept her alive."
[1:53:15] We've had friends come and go.
[1:53:18] I've been missing Brother Steve a lot
[1:53:19] lately, buckles, just thinking about how
[1:53:22] he he'd be excited about what's going on
[1:53:24] now. But I know that we're going to see
[1:53:28] each other in the resurrection. I know
[1:53:29] that's not too far from now. I'm looking
[1:53:32] for the dead in Christ to rise up.
[1:53:35] I'm looking for brother Brener. I'm
[1:53:37] looking for brother Green, brother
[1:53:38] Garcia, brother Nick Castillo, all the
[1:53:40] ones, Tom Bettis. I'm looking for them.
[1:53:44] I'm looking for my grandparents.
[1:53:48] I'm looking for you.
[1:53:52] Be with us now. We pray.
[1:53:55] I give you all the honor, all the glory,
[1:53:58] and all the praise. For thine alone are
[1:54:01] worthy.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. in the lovely name of the
[1:54:04] Lord Jesus Christ. For there is no other
[1:54:07] name greater. Can we say amen?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:54:13] it reaches
[1:54:15] to the highest
[1:54:19] mountain. Stand with me. S
[1:54:23] and it flows
[1:54:26] to always
[1:54:34] the
[1:54:37] free
[1:54:42] to
[1:54:50] sing one more time.
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Oh,
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:16] the blood
[1:55:18] is
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:30] just singing one more time with all your
[1:55:33] heart I s
[1:55:37] and we praise
[1:55:43] mountain
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:58] [Applause]
[1:55:58] [Music]
[1:56:02] day.
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:06] [Music]

[1:56:16] say
[1:56:19] [Applause]
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:26] you believe that. Give the Lord a hand
[1:56:28] of praise.
[1:56:36] [Music]
[1:56:44] And it flows
[1:56:46] to the Lord's
[1:56:50] valley.
[1:56:54] The blood that gives me strength
[1:57:00] from day on today.
[1:57:05] It will never
[1:57:08] lose
[1:57:10] its power.
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
[1:57:20] and time shall be no more and the
[1:57:23] morning breaks eternal bright and fair.
[1:57:28] And when the savior of earth shall
[1:57:31] gather over on the other shore and the
[1:57:35] roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.
[1:57:40] Oh, when the roll
[1:57:43] is called of y.

[1:57:59] When the roll is called up, yonder, I'll
[1:58:02] be there.
[1:58:04] And on that bride and cloud is morning
[1:58:08] and when the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:58:11] and the glory of his resurrection share.
[1:58:16] And when his chosen ones shall gather to
[1:58:20] their home beyond the sky and the roll
[1:58:24] is called they all be there.
[1:58:29] Oh, when the roll
[1:58:32] is called yonder.
[1:58:35] When the roll
[1:58:38] is called yonder,
[1:58:41] when the roll
[1:58:44] is called up.
[1:58:48] Oh, when the roll is called up yonder,
[1:58:51] I'll be there.
[1:58:54] So let us labor for the master from the
[1:58:58] dawn his setting sun. Let us talk of all
[1:59:02] his wondous love and care.
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:06] And when all of life is over and our
[1:59:10] work on earth is done and the roll is
[1:59:14] called up yonder.
[1:59:17] [Music]
[1:59:18] And the road
[1:59:21] is called up.
[1:59:24] And the road
[1:59:27] is called of yonder.
[1:59:30] When the roll
[1:59:33] is called of yonder.
[1:59:36] [Music]
[1:59:37] Oh, when the roll is called up yonder.
[1:59:41] Sing it one more time. When the roll
[1:59:46] is called up
[1:59:49] when the roll
[1:59:52] is called up
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:55] when the roll
[1:59:58] is called up yonder
[2:00:02] when the roll is called up yonder I'll
[2:00:06] be there.
[2:00:14] Amen. Let's sing one more. The key of S.
[2:00:17] When the redeemed are gathering in
[2:00:20] I am thinking of the rapture in our
[2:00:24] blessed moment. When the redeemed
[2:00:28] are gathering.
[2:00:32] I will raise that heavenly
[2:00:34] in that city in the sky with the
[2:00:38] redeemed
[2:00:40] are gathering in.
[2:00:43] Oh the redeemed
[2:00:46] are gathering in
[2:00:49] wash thy soul

[2:10:47] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[2:10:51] where they are, I say,
[2:10:55] "My sins are gone."
[2:10:58] Well, they're all underneath the blood
[2:11:01] on the cross of Calvary.
[2:11:04] As far as darkness is from dawn
[2:11:09] in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[2:11:12] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:11:16] God, my sins are gone.

[2:12:21] got me out. I'm glad
[2:12:24] my sins are gone.
[2:12:27] Well, there underneath the blood on the
[2:12:31] cross of Calvary. Just as far as
[2:12:35] darkness hits from dawn
[2:12:39] there in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[2:12:42] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:12:47] My sins are gone.
[2:12:50] Well, I'm living out for Jesus. I'm
[2:12:54] happy night and day because
[2:12:58] my sins are gone.
[2:13:01] My soul is filled with music. With all
[2:13:05] my heart I say, I know
[2:13:09] my sins are gone.
[2:13:12] They are all underneath the blood. On
[2:13:15] the cross of Calvary,
[2:13:18] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[2:13:23] in the sea of God's for that's good
[2:13:27] enough for me. Praise God.

[2:20:54] his praises
[2:20:56] near and far.

[2:21:03] life is he the savior of the world. The
[2:21:09] man of Galilee,
[2:21:12] the prophet, priest and king, the mighty
[2:21:16] God is he, the well of heaven,
[2:21:21] water free.
[2:21:24] Let's talk about Jesus.

[2:22:20] Amen. Little song who I am before we go.
[2:22:24] Oh, glorious victory.
[2:22:27] That day he set me free and made my
[2:22:31] heart
[2:22:34] is very.
[2:22:36] My life is no longer mine. I'm a

[2:22:46] to praise his name.
[2:22:49] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[2:22:53] Who I am.
[2:22:56] I can't see now just who I am.
[2:23:02] A part of my savior,
[2:23:05] a part of his word.
[2:23:08] It's a revelation
[2:23:11] of who I am.
[2:23:14] On Calvary, he died to redeem his loss.
[2:23:19] For I, the King of Kings,
[2:23:24] became my Savior.
[2:23:27] This is God's great mystery
[2:23:30] of love expressed to me that Christ and
[2:23:34] I
[2:23:36] might be made whole.
[2:23:39] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[2:23:43] who I am.
[2:23:46] I can see now just who I am.

[2:24:04] It's a revelation
[2:24:07] of who I am.
[2:24:10] Oh, who I am, Lord.
[2:24:14] Who I am.
