[3:10] actually sure going to be in church with
[3:12] each one of you. Let's all stand this
[3:14] morning. This morning we'll be listening
[3:16] to for Sunday school the adult Sunday
[3:18] school class here um the Leodysian
[3:22] church age paragraph 243 to 288. Looking
[3:25] forward to hearing about this last
[3:27] church age this morning with you. I
[3:29] forgot to mention to the Clayvilles from
[3:31] Sierra Vista. Welcome. We're sure glad
[3:34] to have you. And Erica, nice to have you
[3:36] as well. I forgot to mention we have
[3:38] Sunday school. I'm a little nervous. Um,
[3:39] usually don't do this. We're missing
[3:41] some people though. So, Sunday school
[3:43] for 5 through 15. There's two classes
[3:45] over here. We'll get you going if you
[3:47] would like to participate if your kids
[3:49] are in that age group. So, again,
[3:51] welcome. Uh, only belief.
[3:54] [Music]
[3:56] Only believe.
[4:01] Only
[4:02] believe
[4:05] that all things are possible.
[4:11] Only
[4:13] believe.
[4:16] Only
[4:18] believe.
[4:21] only
[4:23] be
[4:26] all things are possible
[4:31] only.
[4:35] Let us pray. Dear Lord, we're so happy
[4:37] to be in church this morning. Lots of
[4:39] places we could be, things to do, Lord,
[4:41] but we believe time is short and we just
[4:43] want to be right in line with the word.
[4:45] Lord, we know it's stable. It's a true
[4:47] and sure foundation. And Lord, you said
[4:50] that there is no variableness or shadow
[4:52] of turning. You're unchanging,
[4:55] unfailing, Lord God. That same
[4:57] yesterday, today, and forever as we know
[4:59] from the word. And thankful to be with
[5:01] like-minded people that just love you
[5:03] and want to serve you and worship you,
[5:05] Lord. This portion of
[5:08] the message we'll hear this morning. And
[5:10] we appreciate Brother Jonathan visiting
[5:12] with us, our visiting minister. We pray
[5:14] for him that you'd anoint him and anoint
[5:16] our ears to hear. We know you said you'd
[5:18] walk the aisles or just two or three
[5:19] would be there. And so we're counting
[5:21] and believing that. Lord, now may we
[5:23] hear and take something home ourselves.
[5:25] Name of our precious Lord and Savior,
[5:27] the Lord Jesus Christ. All God's people
[5:29] say, "Amen." Now, let's sing it like
[5:32] this. Lord,
[5:34] I believe.
[5:37] Yay. Lord,
[5:39] I believe.
[5:43] All things are possible.
[5:47] Yes, Lord, I believe.
[5:52] Lord,
[5:54] I believe.
[5:57] Lord,
[5:59] I believe.
[6:03] All things are possible.
[6:07] Lord, I believe.
[6:13] Amen. You can be seated, brother
[6:15] Brandham.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; This poor prostitute there crying,
[6:20] weeping, and the first thing you know,
[6:22] here stood the Simon, the big guy, all
[6:24] got him to come down and said,
[6:27] shows whether he's a prophet or not. You
[6:29] know what kind of a woman was? That
[6:31] hypocrite.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; So after she got through and Jesus never
[6:36] moved his feet, you sat looked at her
[6:38] and watched her. Oh, I like that. Hey,
[6:41] &gt;&gt; it's not the big things that we do. It's
[6:43] the little things we leave undone
[6:44] sometimes.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; He watched her. Just watched her sat
[6:47] there. Nobody's paying attention to him.
[6:49] Finally her in there crying and washing
[6:52] his feet kind of paid attention to him.
[6:54] Got the attraction of the people and he
[6:56] just watched her and never said a word.
[6:58] Old Simon stand back there said, "You
[7:00] see whether he's a prophet or not, don't
[7:01] you? Told you. Told you if he was a
[7:03] prophet, he know who that woman was. You
[7:05] see, we were the great church. You see,
[7:07] we know. So we know he's not a prophet.
[7:09] You know it after after she got through
[7:12] them tears of repentance running down
[7:14] her face wash Jesus' feet. Yeah, I
[7:16] believe you felt a little refreshed.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I like to been there.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; I would wash them again.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Boy, wouldn't a woman have a
[7:25] hard time wiping her feet with her hair
[7:27] today? She have to stand on her head to
[7:28] do it.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Cut it all off. But Hallelujah.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; There Jesus feet. Nobody panic critical
[7:38] sitting disgraced that stink on his
[7:41] feet. She washed it after he got after
[7:43] he got through. He looked down at her as
[7:46] if saying, "All right." Looked over
[7:49] said, "Simon, I got something to say to
[7:51] you."
[7:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; You invited me here and you never met me
[7:56] at the door. You didn't give me any
[7:58] water to wash my feet with.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; You never anointed my head when I come
[8:02] in. take the parchment of the sun off of
[8:05] me. You never give me any kiss of
[8:08] welcome. Want to come in? But this poor
[8:11] woman. Oh,
[8:13] &gt;&gt; this outsider, a prostitute on the
[8:15] street.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; She had no water to wash my feet. And
[8:20] she washed them with her tears.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; She had nothing to wipe them off with,
[8:25] so she took her hair. She wiped them.
[8:28] She's continually kissed my feet.
[8:32] Now I want to say to you, her sins which
[8:35] are many are forgiven.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Never said nothing about
[8:40] his.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; Your sins which are many are forgiven.
[8:43] And today when Jesus standing outside
[8:45] the door
[8:47] of the Pentecostal organizations,
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Baptist organizations, Methodist
[8:53] organizations
[8:55] &gt;&gt; trying to get back in with Pentecost
[8:57] again.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the people are passing him by
[9:02] &gt;&gt; after you your worldliness and things
[9:04] has pushed him out of the church. He's
[9:06] standing trying and crying to get back
[9:08] in again. And boy, it's the most
[9:10] pathetic thing I ever seen in my life.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Had no deed of him. Him outside knocking
[9:16] trying to get in. That's the same thing
[9:18] he's trying to do. Why? Why? He was
[9:21] outside. They never throw him out. They
[9:24] still sang of him, preached about him,
[9:27] but had never missed him in their
[9:29] presence. That's right. They were going
[9:31] right on. Why? They were nearsighted.
[9:33] Just look at their big building. They
[9:35] were rich. They were looking at the
[9:37] great organization they belong to,
[9:38] trying to build it up, get more members
[9:40] to come in. And they didn't miss him.
[9:43] No. No. They didn't miss speaking in
[9:45] tongues. They didn't miss the great
[9:46] powerful messages of God who cuts down
[9:49] to the heart and circumcises the heart,
[9:51] &gt;&gt; tears off the things of the world and
[9:53] shucks you like a piece of corn.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, they if you preach like that in the
[9:58] church that house you out.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; That's the way the Holy Ghost preached.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "You generation of vipers,
[10:06] you you snakes in the grass and John did
[10:08] you and great anointed man always tore
[10:11] the hide off of them."
[10:13] &gt;&gt; Right? But they didn't miss him because
[10:15] they didn't have that. See, so they had
[10:18] a little flowerly something patting them
[10:19] on the back and said, "You just join,
[10:21] put your name right here and and we'll
[10:23] take you in your membership and you go
[10:24] get your paper from the other church and
[10:26] we will receive you and and so forth."
[10:28] Now, your pledge will be how much each
[10:29] year? See, that's it. Rich have need of
[10:33] nothing.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, but you have need of the greatest
[10:36] thing and haven't got it.
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus standing outside trying to get
[10:39] back in with Pentecost. What do you
[10:41] think would happen tonight in the
[10:42] Methodist church if the Holy Ghost fell
[10:44] upon the church and they begin to shout
[10:46] and jump in speaking in tongues and act
[10:47] like a bunch of drunk people while the
[10:51] the conference and throw that Methodist
[10:53] church out of the conference?
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; You know that. What would happen to the
[10:56] Baptist church if it happened? Same
[10:58] thing. Pentecostals. Well, there's many
[11:01] of them happen the same thing.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Sure. Yes, sir. They wouldn't put up
[11:06] with that nonsense and say why they even
[11:08] spoiled our new carpets.
[11:12] My my what a miserable bunch they are.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Well, all right. He was once with them.
[11:20] He walked with them in the midst of the
[11:22] seven golden candlesticks.
[11:24] And here is the answer. Denominations
[11:29] and their worldly things, their bishops,
[11:32] cardinals, and all their worldliness had
[11:35] ousted him out and they never missed
[11:37] him.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the church. Now, what are we
[11:41] going to do to get him back in?
[11:44] If he's outside the Pentecostal church
[11:46] now, what are we going to do to get him
[11:47] back in? Will it take a unanimous vote
[11:51] of the people to bring him back? Will it
[11:54] take electing of a new pope, new
[11:56] cardinal?
[11:58] Or maybe it'll take u it'll it'll take
[12:02] rising up a new denomination. That'll
[12:05] never take it. No,
[12:07] &gt;&gt; that'll never do it. A new denomination
[12:09] won't do it. A new uh uh a a new
[12:13] cardinal won't do it. A new pastor won't
[12:15] do it. A well- paid evangelist won't do
[12:17] it. There's nothing in the world can be
[12:20] done but you yourself.
[12:23] How do we get him in?
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Not by vote. No sir. We don't vote Jesus
[12:28] back in because he won't come in. Hear
[12:29] it. Here it is. If any man will hear my
[12:33] voice
[12:35] &gt;&gt; and open the door.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Now we know what the door is in.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; If any man will open the door, hear my
[12:43] voice. Not now. If any church, if any
[12:45] organization, no sir, he don't deal with
[12:47] them. They're dead and gone to begin
[12:48] with.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; He hates it. He always hates it. He said
[12:51] he hate it. He hates it yet tonight. But
[12:53] if any man, any Methodist man, any
[12:56] Baptist man, any Presbyterian man, any
[12:59] Catholic man, any Church of God man,
[13:01] Nazarene man, Pentecostal man, any man
[13:05] that will hear my voice and will open
[13:08] the door, I will come in and suck with
[13:11] him and he with me.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; That's the message to the Pentecostal
[13:16] church. not try to revive the
[13:18] Pentecostal organization but revive the
[13:21] Pentecostal blessing in an individual's
[13:24] heart. That's the only way and I will
[13:26] suffer them in the healing. What does
[13:28] the messenger to the church message to
[13:31] the church teach us then? Uh teach uh
[13:34] teach us not the growth in the spirit.
[13:38] No sir, decline of the spirit. We have a
[13:41] decline all the time. The method the the
[13:44] messengers to the church and the message
[13:46] to every church age condemn
[13:48] denominationism.
[13:50] Every message to the church the church
[13:52] is constantly on the decline and
[13:54] wouldn't listen to it. The message to
[13:56] the church was disregarding
[13:58] denominations and it made hybrid
[14:01] Christians so-called. That's right. Who
[14:04] know nothing about God or the Holy
[14:06] Ghost. That's as true as I stand in this
[14:09] platform tonight. the fine lukewarm
[14:12] members only to be spewed out of his
[14:14] mouth. Paul warned the Gentiles was a
[14:17] branch. Now I want some of you if you
[14:20] will to turn to Romans 11th chapter the
[14:22] 15th to the 27th verse just so you can
[14:25] mark it down you all and I've been slate
[14:27] I will quote this to you now just before
[14:29] leaving because it's a now Romans if you
[14:34] want to put it down 11:15 to 20 uh to 27
[14:38] Paul told them talking to the Gentiles
[14:41] there the Romans he said if God now
[14:45] listen as we're closing on the church
[14:46] ages is Paul said, "If God did not spare
[14:52] the original olive tree,
[14:56] but cut it off because of unbelief."
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; What caused them to be cut off? Because
[15:06] they rejected Pentecost.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost,
[15:14] &gt;&gt; they made fun and blasphemed the Holy
[15:16] Ghost. When Jesus is here on earth, he
[15:18] said they called him Beyb said he was a
[15:21] devil. He was a fortune teller. Whatever
[15:23] more he said, I forgive you for that.
[15:25] But when the Holy Ghost has come, don't
[15:27] you speak against it.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; Because you speak against it, it'll
[15:30] never be forgiven you.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; And remember when Jesus commissioned his
[15:34] disciples not to go to the Gentiles, is
[15:36] that right?
[15:38] &gt;&gt; But go rather to the lost sheep of
[15:39] Israel. How did they condemn themselves?
[15:42] By blaspheing in the Holy Ghost.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Calling the spirit of God an unclean
[15:46] thing. Made fun of them when they were
[15:48] dancing in the spirit and so forth on
[15:50] the day of Pentecost. That same city,
[15:52] they made fun of it. Titus killed them
[15:54] in there and their blood went out the
[15:55] gateway. They ate their own children and
[15:58] everything in that same century.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. One of the greatest
[16:02] nations of the world become the lowest
[16:03] and scattered to four winds of the earth
[16:06] &gt;&gt; because why?
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Unbelief. Amen.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; And that was the original stump, the
[16:13] original tree, Israel.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Did old Paul say there? Who's got the
[16:18] scripture right there? Got it, Pat?
[16:19] Stand up and read from the 15th to 27th
[16:21] verse. For if the casting away of them
[16:25] be the reconciling of the world, what
[16:28] shall the receiving of them be but life
[16:31] from the dead? For if the first fruit be
[16:34] holy, the lump is also holy. And if the
[16:37] root be holy, so are the branches. And
[16:41] if some of the branches be broken off,
[16:43] and thou being a wild olive tree were
[16:46] grafted in among them, and with them
[16:48] partakest of the root and fattness of
[16:50] the olive tree, boast not thyself
[16:54] against the branches. But if thou boast,
[16:57] thou beest not the root, but the root.
[17:00] Thou wilt say then, the branches were
[17:02] broken off, that I might be grafted in.
[17:05] Well, because of unbelief, they were
[17:07] broken off.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; Listen. Unbelief. All right. Go ahead.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; And thou standest by faith. Be not high
[17:14] minded, but fear. For if God spared not
[17:17] the natural branches, take heed, lest he
[17:21] also spared not thee. Behold therefore
[17:24] the goodness and severity of God, on
[17:27] them which fell severely, but toward
[17:30] thee goodness. if thou continue in his
[17:33] goodness, otherwise thou also shalt be
[17:37] cut off. And they also, if they abide
[17:40] not still in unbelief, shall be grafted
[17:42] in. For God is able to graft them in
[17:45] again.
[17:47] For if thou w cut out of the olive tree
[17:49] which is wild by nature, and were
[17:51] grafted contrary to nature into a good
[17:53] olive tree, how much more shall these
[17:57] which be the natural branches be grafted
[17:59] into their own olive tree? For I would
[18:02] not, brethren, that ye should be
[18:05] ignorant of this mystery,
[18:08] lest ye should be wise in your own
[18:10] conceits, that blindness in part is
[18:13] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[18:17] the Gentiles become in.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so all Israel shall be saved,
[18:23] as it is written, there shall come out
[18:26] of Zion the deliverer, and shall turn
[18:31] away ungodliness from Jacob. For this is
[18:34] my covenant unto them, when I shall take
[18:37] away their sins.
[18:40] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[18:41] Paul said if Israel come up and seen the
[18:45] signature of the Holy Spirit and was cut
[18:48] off remember because they rejected
[18:50] Paul's message
[18:52] &gt;&gt; baptism in Jesus name
[18:54] &gt;&gt; repentance and baptism in Jesus name
[18:57] signs and wonders following the believer
[18:59] and they rejected it and they said lo we
[19:03] turn to the Gentiles is that right
[19:05] &gt;&gt; let's see I believe it was at uh where
[19:08] they first called Christians was at um
[19:12] anyhow. Now, now if um if the first tree
[19:16] was holy, it branch is holy, the
[19:19] original tree, and because they
[19:21] disbelieve the Pentecostal message that
[19:24] Paul was preaching, is that so?
[19:27] &gt;&gt; God cut him off
[19:28] &gt;&gt; and took a wild olive tree, which was
[19:30] the Gentiles, us, and grafted us in that
[19:33] we might live off the the substance of
[19:36] that tree. Now, how much more in this
[19:39] day when we are rejecting
[19:42] &gt;&gt; the Pentecostal message that's come down
[19:44] through the church ages,
[19:47] &gt;&gt; how much more is God able to take that
[19:49] old wild tree off of it anyhow and let
[19:52] the other come in because he will reject
[19:54] it because of unbelief.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; Now, dovetail that with the lesson this
[19:58] morning.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; You know where we're standing now, don't
[20:01] you?
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. We're at the end time for the
[20:04] taking away of the gentile church, the
[20:07] rapture for it, and the issuing in of
[20:10] the Holy Ghost to come upon the Jews and
[20:12] Jesus to make himself known to seal the
[20:14] 144,000. There you are bringing back the
[20:19] original tree back into the blessing
[20:22] into Israel again. Jesus ain't going to
[20:24] stand outside of your door and knock all
[20:26] the time.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; There's a time when he'll get enough and
[20:29] turn away. Then you'll do the knocking,
[20:32] but you'll never find him.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Come while it is time. Come while there
[20:36] is a knock.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; Don't you compromise with anything less
[20:40] than the baptism of the Holy Ghost like
[20:42] they got at Pentecost with the same type
[20:45] of water baptism. The same things that
[20:48] they did there. Don't you let nothing
[20:50] put anything in your heart less than
[20:52] that.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Now to you, my Catholic friends, let me
[20:56] tell you something. that you believe in
[20:58] the Virgin Mary.
[21:01] Virgin Mary being the mother of Jesus
[21:04] Christ had to go up to Pentecost and be
[21:06] filled with the Holy Ghost and she act
[21:08] like a drunk person. She was among them
[21:11] 120
[21:12] &gt;&gt; had the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:14] speaking in tongues and acting like a
[21:16] drunk woman
[21:17] &gt;&gt; out there under the spirit of God. And
[21:19] if the Virgin Mary had to do that in
[21:22] order to get into glory, how are you
[21:24] going to get in anything less than that?
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[21:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Baptist.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; That Baptist preacher back here wants to
[21:38] be sure this said to the Baptist also.
[21:40] That's for anybody.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Don't care who it is. So just joining
[21:45] church and saying a creed and going to
[21:48] church every Sunday morning won't do you
[21:50] one speck of good.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; You're only making a mock out of God.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Either be a real Christian or don't be
[21:58] anything at all.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; Be either hot or cold.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Either be out because you can't be. You
[22:04] never did see a black white bird. Need
[22:07] see a drunk sober man. You never did see
[22:09] a sinner saint.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; No, you don't. They don't make them.
[22:13] You're either filled with the Holy
[22:14] Spirit and God living in you or you're
[22:16] not at all. You you are or you are not.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you must you must remember
[22:23] that Jesus stands at your door and
[22:25] remember God's promisure
[22:28] &gt;&gt; that he will in these days because of
[22:32] what? Rejecting
[22:35] what caused Israel to be cut off the
[22:38] original tree.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. because they rejected Paul's
[22:41] Pentecostal message.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; And do you believe this is the last
[22:45] church age?
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Bible said so. And what's going to
[22:48] happen to them? They're going to be cut
[22:50] off because of rejecting the Pentecostal
[22:54] message
[22:55] &gt;&gt; and then God will return again to the
[22:57] Jews
[22:58] &gt;&gt; and all Israel then will be saved
[23:01] because he'll take them as a nation.
[23:03] Not as an individual, but to you and I,
[23:05] it's individual because he come to the
[23:08] Jews. Acts in the book of Acts, he came
[23:11] to the Gentiles to take a people out of
[23:14] the Gentiles for his name,
[23:17] &gt;&gt; his bride, a people. One here, one
[23:19] there, one over here. And he deals with
[23:21] us as individuals
[23:23] regardless of race, creed, or color. He
[23:26] deals with us as individuals. It's his
[23:28] bouquet that put on his altar. But as
[23:31] the Jews, he always dealt with Israel as
[23:34] a nation. They are a nation of people,
[23:36] his nation. I'm glad tonight that we had
[23:40] this message. And I'm so glad that you
[23:43] attended and your attendance has been so
[23:45] appreciated by me. I'm grateful to
[23:48] Almighty God for him letting me see what
[23:51] I have seen and being able to deliver to
[23:54] this church. And now it's off my heart.
[23:58] For some time, the Holy Spirit dealt on
[24:00] my heart. I couldn't shake it away. I
[24:03] just had to go with it. There's two
[24:05] things I felt led to do. Go to Shreport,
[24:07] Louisiana for a meeting with brother
[24:09] Moore. My wife sitting there can tell
[24:11] you for weeks I almost cried. I want to
[24:13] go to Shreport. Why? And anybody was
[24:15] there at Shreport know why. Now they
[24:18] never seen or heard anything like it.
[24:20] Preachers coming from everywhere.
[24:22] Baptists and different kinds. One man
[24:24] say start put his hand on the ice box
[24:26] and the Holy Spirit come up on him and
[24:28] said go to shreport Louisiana you'll be
[24:30] told you there what to do told him my
[24:33] name the word of fine said he'll tell
[24:34] you what to do I said the pool's open at
[24:37] the bottom of the steps you need the
[24:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and there so
[24:41] things like that people speaking and and
[24:44] prophecies and things of predicting
[24:47] things that happen right there among us
[24:49] then I said I must go to Jeffersonville
[24:52] and write this book because I don't know
[24:54] how much longer I've got to be here. But
[24:56] if I express this and it goes on writing
[24:59] after I'm gone, the words will live on.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; I've got the history wrote down which
[25:04] will go in the book and I come here to
[25:06] bring it before the church to find the
[25:08] inspiration of the Holy Spirit because I
[25:10] didn't know these things myself. That's
[25:12] true. That's in the name of the Lord.
[25:15] That's true. I did not know him. Now I
[25:18] feel delivered. I feel that God has
[25:20] brought us a message. I believe that
[25:23] we're at the end of the road.
[25:24] &gt;&gt; I believe that the hour is sure for the
[25:26] manifestation of God to be made known
[25:29] among us.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; And I don't know how much longer it'll
[25:32] be. But the hour is soon at hand. We'll
[25:35] be looking for that great one to rise.
[25:37] He might come in my day. He might come
[25:39] in the younger days. I don't know. He
[25:43] might be right among us now. We can't
[25:44] tell. The Holy Spirit is here to lead us
[25:46] to that time. And when this leader will
[25:48] take his order, he'll still be anointed
[25:49] of the Holy Ghost. Amen. The Elijah will
[25:52] of course that will come but he will be
[25:54] the leader that will turn the hearts of
[25:56] the children or the hearts of the
[25:59] children back to the father's message
[26:02] &gt;&gt; back to our heavenly father's message on
[26:04] the day of Pentecost when he poured out
[26:06] his spirit which that little line I
[26:07] brought it just as close as I could by
[26:09] the history of Bible and show that that
[26:11] thing has come right down through the
[26:12] church ages and that's it today show
[26:15] that denominations is a curse before God
[26:18] &gt;&gt; yes
[26:18] &gt;&gt; I hope that's settling in your mind Yes.
[26:20] Amen.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; By Bible, by the acts of the apostles,
[26:24] by the history and all that. And there
[26:27] is never one time that God ever
[26:30] organized his church.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; The mother of organized churches is the
[26:35] Roman Catholic hierarchy. Roman Catholic
[26:39] Church. It's the mother of the
[26:41] organizations. And as soon as the
[26:43] revival breaks in any Protestant group,
[26:45] they go right back and do the same
[26:46] thing. And the Bible said she was a
[26:48] and her she had daughters which
[26:51] was churches off of her. They had to be
[26:54] women to be harlots.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; There she is. So we're setting. But he
[27:00] also said this, "Fear not, little flock.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; It's your father's goodwill to give you
[27:05] the kingdom."
[27:06] &gt;&gt; So may we all at that day, you Methodist
[27:09] Baptist, whatever you are, whosoever
[27:12] will open the door, I'll come in and
[27:14] suck with him.

[39:47] I go to the rock of my salvation.
[39:52] Going to the stone that the builders
[39:54] rejected. Running to the mountain and
[39:58] the mountain stands by me.
[40:03] When the earth all around me is sinking
[40:06] sand. Christ the solid rock I stand.
[40:11] When I need shelter, when I need a
[40:13] friend, I go to the rock.
[40:18] Where do I hide?
[40:22] Till the storms of life are raging,
[40:26] where do I turn to?
[40:30] When those winds of sorrow blow, is
[40:34] there a reuge
[40:37] in my time of tribulation?

[40:45] go to the rock.

[41:24] Go into the stone that the builders
[41:27] rejected. Running to the mountain and

[55:44] [Music]
[55:46] I was so unworthy
[55:51] [Music]
[55:54] of such mercy.

[56:18] I'm not on an evil trip.
[56:23] I'm not
[56:27] my own.
[56:30] I make mistakes.
[56:33] I so often slip.
[56:37] I'm flesh and bone.
[56:42] But I'll prove one day just why I sing
[56:50] a special
[56:52] kind.
[56:54] Cuz when he was on the cross,
[57:00] [Music]
[57:02] I was on his mind.
[57:08] The look of love was on his face
[57:16] were on his head.
[57:21] Blood was on his scarlet ro.
[57:28] [Music]
[57:33] His eyes were on the crowd that day.
[57:40] He looked ahead
[57:42] in time
[57:45] when he was on the cross.
[57:52] Oh, I was on his mind.
[57:57] [Music]
[57:59] Oh, for he knew
[58:03] me
[58:06] and yet he loved me. Brother Joe, if you
[58:12] want to make ready.
[58:14] He whose glory
[58:17] makes
[58:19] the heaven shine.
[58:22] [Music]
[58:24] I was so unworthy.
[58:31] Oh, of such mercy.
[58:38] How when he was on the cross,
[58:45] I was on his own
[58:50] for he knew me.
[58:56] [Music]
[59:02] Oh, he whose glory
[59:07] makes
[59:09] the heaven shine.
[59:13] Oh yes, I'm so unworthy
[59:20] [Music]
[59:21] of such mercy
[59:28] when he was on the cross.
[59:34] Oh, I was on
[59:38] his mind. And oh, let's give him a hand
[59:41] clap of praise this morning, saints.
[59:47] So beautiful. I'm so unworthy of such
[59:50] mercy. But he was thinking of you. He
[59:52] was thinking of me when he was on that
[59:54] old rugged cross. My, what a a worship
[59:57] service we've had. I've enjoyed it
[59:58] immensely. Brother Scott, my sins are
[1:00:00] gone. And I know we may not always like
[1:00:03] to hear and the churches don't always
[1:00:04] like to preach on sin, but how are we
[1:00:06] going to know this great savior? How
[1:00:08] unworthy. Oh, but for the cross this
[1:00:10] morning. So, so good to be with each one
[1:00:13] of you. God bless you. We welcome the
[1:00:15] Clayville family from Sierra Vista. God
[1:00:17] bless you, brother Matthew and his crew.

[1:01:18] him to take his liberty this morning.
[1:01:20] Amen. And just be right at home. He's

[1:04:34] Heavenly Father, Lord, how we praise you
[1:04:38] this morning.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; How we love you, Lord, and how we're
[1:04:42] counting on you to come once again and
[1:04:45] to have your way in our lives, Father.
[1:04:48] Lord, we pray that you would move
[1:04:50] amongst us and meet the needs of our
[1:04:53] heart, Father, that you would come in a
[1:04:56] mighty way and
[1:04:58] and just speak to us.
[1:05:02] Father, we'll give you all the glory and
[1:05:04] all the honor. May you bless the reading
[1:05:07] of the word and the different things
[1:05:09] that are said, Father. And may you be
[1:05:12] lifted up above all, Father.
[1:05:16] Grant these things. Bless these people.
[1:05:18] Bless brother Poe and his efforts.
[1:05:23] Again, we love you. We ask these things
[1:05:25] in your name. Jesus name. Amen. You may
[1:05:29] be seated for a moment.
[1:05:32] He knew me then.
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:36] Now, maybe not all of you know me. I
[1:05:38] know some of you. Um been developing a
[1:05:41] relationship, a fellowship with brother
[1:05:43] Poe ever since my sister decided to
[1:05:46] leave us.
[1:05:48] But uh you know, it's it's worth it. I
[1:05:50] would say uh we didn't lose anybody. We
[1:05:53] gained a whole family. we gained a a
[1:05:55] whole bunch of uh fellow workers of the
[1:05:58] gospel, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[1:06:02] So, it's a wonderful thing. Um we still
[1:06:05] miss her from time to time, but
[1:06:08] so I'm happy Brother Po would ask me to
[1:06:10] come. I get to two birds, one stone, get
[1:06:14] to see little Jewel and my
[1:06:16] brother-in-law Caleb. I sure appreciate
[1:06:18] this body of believers, the musicians,
[1:06:20] and the songs. Brother Ben, a wonderful
[1:06:23] time, fellowship, and brother Will and
[1:06:26] the different ones. I I can't name you

[1:06:31] group. Appreciate your pastor, Brother
[1:06:33] Poe. Greetings from our church there in
[1:06:35] Chuggyak, Alaska. Might have not heard
[1:06:38] of the place, but it's there. And we're
[1:06:40] there, and we're uh trying to be a
[1:06:43] lighthouse.
[1:06:45] We're trying to share the gospel and
[1:06:47] live our lives for for others. Um, so
[1:06:51] greetings from our church. God bless you
[1:06:53] this morning. Greetings from our pastor,
[1:06:54] Brother Ike McGawan.
[1:06:57] I'd like to share a song with you.
[1:07:01] You know, he he knows you this morning
[1:07:05] and he didn't just find out about you
[1:07:08] this morning,
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; but he knew you
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; through everything. Huh?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; He knew me then.
[1:07:21] He knows me now
[1:07:24] and he died
[1:07:27] for me.
[1:07:32] He loved me then
[1:07:35] and he loves me now.
[1:07:38] Oh, how can it be?
[1:07:45] He saw my face.
[1:07:49] He knew the place
[1:07:52] that I would be
[1:07:54] today.
[1:07:58] Oh,
[1:08:00] he knew me then.
[1:08:04] He knows me now
[1:08:06] and he loves
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:10] me.
[1:08:15] Some people say
[1:08:18] that he died one day, but that was long
[1:08:22] ago.
[1:08:29] They say, "I'm sure
[1:08:32] he was a very good man, but me, he did
[1:08:37] not know."
[1:08:43] Listen, my friend,
[1:08:46] what I say is true.
[1:08:49] He knew me
[1:08:53] and he sure knew you.
[1:08:57] He knew you then.
[1:09:00] He knows you now and he loves
[1:09:07] you.
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:11] He knew you then.
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:15] He knows you now. And he died
[1:09:21] for you.
[1:09:25] He loved you then
[1:09:29] and he loves you now.
[1:09:32] I know this is true.
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:38] He saw your face.
[1:09:42] He knew the place that you would be
[1:09:46] today.
[1:09:47] [Music]
[1:09:53] He knew you then.
[1:09:57] He knows you now and he loves
[1:10:03] you.
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:07] I believe that he
[1:10:11] had thoughts of you and me before the
[1:10:14] world began.
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:21] I believe the word
[1:10:25] the first time that I heard that we were
[1:10:29] in his plan.
[1:10:34] He gave his life
[1:10:38] without complain.
[1:10:41] He bled and died.
[1:10:48] extended grace to you.
[1:10:52] Believe me, cuz it's true that he loves
[1:10:59] you.
[1:11:00] [Music]

[1:11:07] and he knows us now.
[1:11:10] And he died
[1:11:13] for all.
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] He loved us then
[1:11:22] and he loves us now. We cannot
[1:11:27] fall.
[1:11:31] He saw our face.
[1:11:35] He took our place at Calary.
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:46] He knew us then.
[1:11:50] He knows us now
[1:11:52] and he loves
[1:11:56] us.
[1:11:59] Amen.
[1:12:03] Amen.
[1:12:05] You believe that this morning?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. We'll read a
[1:12:09] scripture, get started.
[1:12:18] I appreciate the prayers. Everybody's
[1:12:20] been ta telling me they've been praying
[1:12:21] for me, and I sure uh I sure need it,
[1:12:25] and I really appreciate it. I don't take
[1:12:28] that lightly. I believe I believe people
[1:12:32] when they tell me they're praying for me
[1:12:33] and I sure uh will accept those prayers
[1:12:37] and um I've also been praying for you
[1:12:40] though I don't know each individual name
[1:12:42] I pray that God will be here and have
[1:12:45] his way.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Uh we'll start at St. John the first
[1:12:50] chapter.
[1:12:52] We'll start at the 31st verse
[1:12:57] the 35th verse sorry. All
[1:13:14] right. The Bible says
[1:13:17] again the next day after John stood and
[1:13:19] two of his disciples
[1:13:22] and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he
[1:13:24] saith, "Behold the lamb of God." And the
[1:13:27] two disciples heard him speak, and they
[1:13:30] followed Jesus. Then Jesus turned and
[1:13:33] saw them following, and saith unto them,
[1:13:36] What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi,
[1:13:39] which is to say, being interpreted,
[1:13:41] Master, where dwellest thou? He saith
[1:13:46] unto them, Come and see. They came and
[1:13:48] saw where he dwelt, and abode with him
[1:13:51] that day. For it was about the 10th
[1:13:53] hour.
[1:13:55] One of the two which heard John speak
[1:13:57] and followed him was Andrew, Simon
[1:13:59] Peter's brother. He first findeth his
[1:14:01] own brother Simon and saith unto him,
[1:14:04] "We have found the Messiah, which is
[1:14:06] being interpreted the Christ." And he
[1:14:09] brought uh and he brought him to Jesus.
[1:14:12] And when Jesus beheld him, he said,
[1:14:14] "Thou art Simon the son of Jonah. Thou
[1:14:17] shalt be called Cphus, which is being
[1:14:19] inter is by interpretation a stone."
[1:14:22] The day following Jesus would go forth
[1:14:24] into Galilee and findeth Philillip and
[1:14:27] saith unto him, FF follow me. Now Philip
[1:14:30] was of Bethada, the city of Andrew and
[1:14:34] Peter. Philip findeth Nathaniel, and
[1:14:37] saith unto him, we have found him of
[1:14:40] whom Moses in the law and the prophets
[1:14:43] did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
[1:14:46] Joseph. And Nathaniel said unto him,
[1:14:49] "Can there any good thing come out of
[1:14:52] Nazareth? Phil Philip saith unto him,
[1:14:55] Come and see."
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Nathaniel coming up or coming
[1:15:00] to him, and saith of him, Behold, an
[1:15:03] Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile.
[1:15:06] Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knowest
[1:15:08] thou me? Jesus answered and said unto
[1:15:11] him, "Before that Philip called thee,
[1:15:15] when thou was under the fig tree, I saw
[1:15:18] thee." We'll ask the Lord to add the
[1:15:21] blessing to the reading of his word. You
[1:15:23] may be seated.
[1:15:27] Little bit of a lengthy scripture. a lot
[1:15:29] in there,
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; but uh
[1:15:33] I'm not real good at titling messages,
[1:15:36] but if if I'm going to title it, it
[1:15:38] would be where dwellest thou?
[1:15:42] Is there any good thing that comes from
[1:15:44] that place?
[1:15:47] So as we as we see in the scripture and
[1:15:51] I always like to make note, you know,
[1:15:53] when whenever you meet this Jesus, you
[1:15:56] see this is a this is a this is a the
[1:15:59] story of these disciples meeting Jesus
[1:16:02] for the first time. And I I know for a
[1:16:05] fact from my own testimony when I met
[1:16:07] Jesus, yeah, I might heard of him and I
[1:16:10] I might have uh I might have even been
[1:16:12] in his presence from time to time, but
[1:16:14] the first time that he spoke to me,
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; he he told me who I was.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; He he he told me exactly who I was and
[1:16:24] what my name is and everything about me.
[1:16:26] Kind of like these folks here. And
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; and I'm telling you this morning, if you
[1:16:30] haven't met him, you could meet him this
[1:16:33] morning and he'll do the same for you.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; You know my testimony. I spent many
[1:16:38] years not knowing who I was,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; not knowing who my friends and my family
[1:16:43] was, but when I met him, he answered all
[1:16:46] those questions.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm so I'm so thankful for that.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; He He'll do it again and again and
[1:16:53] again. But I would like to pull a couple
[1:16:56] things out. And
[1:16:58] you know,
[1:17:00] you you see when when Philip met him and
[1:17:02] I like I like how every occasion was a
[1:17:05] little different.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; The the response to it was just a little
[1:17:09] different.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; But the end result was they followed
[1:17:13] him.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; The end result is that they believed
[1:17:16] him.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; So So Jesus just had to tell Philip,
[1:17:19] "Hey, follow me." And Philip's like,
[1:17:21] "Okay, let's go."
[1:17:23] He he must have he must have recognized
[1:17:25] something there. Huh?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Well then, like many of us when we first
[1:17:31] meet Jesus, we respond like Philillip. I
[1:17:34] know for myself when I first met Jesus
[1:17:36] and he and I had my encounter with him,
[1:17:39] I had to go tell somebody
[1:17:42] about Jesus.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; I had to go tell somebody who I just met
[1:17:47] and and I and I found him. The one that
[1:17:50] everybody's been talking about. The one
[1:17:52] that everybody says is so great and
[1:17:54] wonderful. The one that will deliver you
[1:17:57] from all of your sin, all of your shame,
[1:18:00] and all of your guilt. The one that will
[1:18:02] heal you. This this Jesus, this promised
[1:18:05] word, I I met him. Come and see. Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; You know, and and uh as Philip comes to
[1:18:14] Nathaniel, when Nathaniel now, he's
[1:18:16] hearing it from from Philillip.
[1:18:19] And maybe there's people that we've
[1:18:21] encountered and we've told and and they
[1:18:23] were good people, but the response
[1:18:26] wasn't exactly how we thought it would
[1:18:28] be.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; But don't count them out.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You can't count them out.
[1:18:36] They if if they don't know, they don't
[1:18:37] know.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; You didn't know at one point.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; You don't know until you know.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; First give them the opportunity to come
[1:18:46] and see.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; But we see Nathaniel's response. He
[1:18:51] said, "Can there any good thing come out
[1:18:54] of Nazareth?"
[1:18:57] Any good thing come out of that place?
[1:19:01] You know, we know a little bit about
[1:19:03] Nazareth, don't we?
[1:19:05] We uh
[1:19:08] you know the funny thing though just
[1:19:10] want to hit this note.
[1:19:12] The funny thing is he was the only good
[1:19:14] thing period.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus told the rich young ruler
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; is there anything good but God.
[1:19:24] He was the only good thing. Period.
[1:19:28] Right.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; But but yet not knowing yet. Not knowing
[1:19:31] yet. He he he questioned it just a
[1:19:35] little bit. Not not because of because
[1:19:37] he didn't meet him yet. He didn't know
[1:19:39] yet. But because of the place that that
[1:19:42] Jesus was identifying with because of
[1:19:46] the place where where Jesus Jesus of
[1:19:48] Nazareth because of the name that was
[1:19:51] connected to him. Because of the place
[1:19:54] that was connected to him. He had a
[1:19:56] little bit of doubt that anything good
[1:19:58] can come from that,
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; you know, and I don't want to get ahead
[1:20:03] of myself, but there's that's the that's
[1:20:05] the good part. I'm telling you,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; but let's just let's just talk about
[1:20:11] Nazareth for a moment. You know, the
[1:20:14] scholar said that Nazareth a part, he
[1:20:16] had right to be skeptic of uh Nazareth
[1:20:20] of somebody that comes out of there.
[1:20:22] They didn't even basically know where it
[1:20:24] was on the map.
[1:20:25] There you put it on the map. Not only
[1:20:27] that, they felt like they were a little
[1:20:29] too influenced by the Gentiles as well.
[1:20:32] So, how could this great Messiah on top
[1:20:36] of that?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; On top of that, the Messiah didn't come
[1:20:40] out of Nazareth.
[1:20:43] You know, but sometimes we don't know
[1:20:45] the full story.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I could only tell you so much
[1:20:49] this morning. You know, your your your
[1:20:52] parents, they can only tell you so much.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Your friends, they can only tell you so
[1:20:56] much.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; But but you're only going to know if you
[1:21:00] come and see.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; You're only going to know if you come
[1:21:04] and meet this Jesus yourself.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You're only going to know. You're not
[1:21:09] going to know the whole story. You're
[1:21:10] not going to you're not they're not
[1:21:12] going to be able to explain this to you.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; You just got to come and see.
[1:21:18] But Nazareth, it wasn't a it wasn't a
[1:21:20] good place.
[1:21:22] Uh it was
[1:21:29] there was a lot of prejudice there.
[1:21:31] There was they everybody thought they
[1:21:33] were better than anybody that come out
[1:21:34] of Nazareth.
[1:21:36] So So
[1:21:38] this is what brother Brandham said about
[1:21:41] Nazareth. He said, 'Look, there wasn't a
[1:21:45] meaner, wicider, lower, this is in God
[1:21:49] of this evil age.
[1:21:51] He said, look, there wasn't a meaner,
[1:21:54] wicider, lower prostituting city in the
[1:21:56] world than Nazareth. And out of there,
[1:22:00] God chose a virgin.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Could any good thing come out of
[1:22:05] Nazareth?
[1:22:08] you know, and and I just want to linger
[1:22:11] on this for a little bit as we work our
[1:22:13] way through. And and I I imagine you're
[1:22:16] putting some of the dots together. I'll
[1:22:17] help you a little bit.
[1:22:20] You know, we we see certain situations
[1:22:23] in life. We s we see certain people in
[1:22:26] life. We see we see certain things in
[1:22:29] life. We go through certain things in
[1:22:31] life. And the question may arise, could
[1:22:35] any good thing come out of this?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; You you see some terrible terrible
[1:22:42] situations?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Um, and you wonder, I've wondered how
[1:22:48] how how is there anything good going to
[1:22:51] come of this?
[1:22:53] That's right.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; How,
[1:22:56] for example, and all I got I got my
[1:22:58] testimony and I won't do it all over
[1:22:59] again, but I I got to hit a couple
[1:23:01] places because that's where I came from.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That's how I know Jesus is real
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; because he revealed himself to me
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and he showed me that he is he is there.
[1:23:13] He was there all the time
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; and in every situation, in every
[1:23:17] circumstance,
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; he he was able to bring me through it.
[1:23:22] Yeah, I was talking and there's some
[1:23:23] young people in here. I was talking to a
[1:23:25] young man uh we just had uh youth camp
[1:23:28] up there and and I know he he struggles
[1:23:30] he struggles with depression. He he
[1:23:33] struggles with taking his life. We'll
[1:23:35] just be candid. And and he's a a good
[1:23:38] young man. Everybody loves him. We all
[1:23:40] love him. But the devil, how how evil,
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; how sick the devil is. He just torment a
[1:23:47] mind like that and tell him how alone he
[1:23:50] is and nobody cares and all these all
[1:23:52] these things that you're not going to
[1:23:54] make it through. You're not going to
[1:23:56] make it through this time. You know, and
[1:23:58] maybe the devil, he's not attacking you
[1:24:00] to that degree, but he he comes every
[1:24:03] once in a while and tells you you're not
[1:24:04] going to make it through. Maybe it's not
[1:24:06] your life, but maybe it's uh in this
[1:24:08] message, maybe it's in this word, maybe
[1:24:10] it's in your faith. He'll try to come to
[1:24:12] you and tell you you're not going to
[1:24:13] make it through.
[1:24:15] But but church, just like I told the
[1:24:18] young man, all the evidence that I've
[1:24:22] ever seen in life tells me that you're
[1:24:24] going to make it through.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Because just look back on life and look
[1:24:30] at the last problem that you had, that
[1:24:32] that you were going through and now
[1:24:34] you're through. Look at the problem
[1:24:37] before that that you were going through
[1:24:40] and look at where you're at now. And
[1:24:41] it's not that problem no more, but now
[1:24:43] it's another problem. But you came
[1:24:46] through that one and you're going to
[1:24:47] come through this one.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let the devil tell you that
[1:24:50] you're not going to make it through
[1:24:52] because the word of God tells us that
[1:24:54] we're going to make it through.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; It tells us that we can't be lost. We
[1:25:00] can't be be deceived. that that we can't
[1:25:03] lose because we are in Christ Jesus
[1:25:07] because we have faith in the son of God.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; We believe on who God has sent.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's a side note, but you're going to
[1:25:16] make it through this morning.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And and if there's a circumstance or a
[1:25:20] situation that looks so dark, looks so
[1:25:24] hard that you the devil tells you that,
[1:25:27] well, could there any good thing come
[1:25:29] out of it? Has
[1:25:33] God ever proved that good things come
[1:25:35] from hard situations?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; You know, for me, I've seen it in my
[1:25:41] life. I've seen it in my life. My my
[1:25:44] dad, he passed away when I was very
[1:25:46] young. You think how what good thing
[1:25:51] what possible good thing can come out of
[1:25:54] that,
[1:25:56] you know, and and I can tell you that
[1:25:59] every one of his children
[1:26:02] by the testimony the the the elders
[1:26:06] obtained a good report, church, and by
[1:26:08] the testimonies of other saints and
[1:26:10] other people that knew him. And I've
[1:26:12] hearing it all my life and my sisters
[1:26:14] and my brother hearing it all our life.
[1:26:17] It did something to us. My dad's
[1:26:20] testimony. And maybe if I if he became
[1:26:23] more common to me or common to us,
[1:26:25] things might have been different. I
[1:26:26] don't know. But I'm just I'm looking for
[1:26:29] the good thing. I'm telling you.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; And the good thing this morning is that
[1:26:32] every one of us believe this message.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Every one of us is serving God.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And and no matter what
[1:26:41] situation it looked like in life, and
[1:26:43] trust me, I've been in some dark ones
[1:26:44] and some bad ones, God had has brought
[1:26:47] it out. That he was in it all and that
[1:26:51] he was in control of it all. And that
[1:26:54] though it was a dark place, it was only
[1:26:56] that I could recognize what light was
[1:26:58] when I seen it and appreciate it when
[1:27:00] I've seen it.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like being free.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; There there's nothing like like being
[1:27:07] free from your addictions. being free
[1:27:09] from your your anxiety or your
[1:27:11] oppression. Yeah. I've been telling this
[1:27:14] testimony lately because I believe we
[1:27:15] have to testify about what God has done
[1:27:18] for us.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And and my mind was so messed up. I
[1:27:22] couldn't even tell you the things that I
[1:27:24] thought. They're they're so dark and
[1:27:25] ugly. But and I couldn't think straight.
[1:27:28] I never thought, you know, I couldn't
[1:27:30] even I couldn't even read until I got
[1:27:32] saved and I was 22 years old. I couldn't
[1:27:36] read. The reason I learned to read is
[1:27:38] because I love this word.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I love the word. What? Let me know more
[1:27:44] about you, Jesus. Let me in. At first,
[1:27:47] you're just trying to stumble through it
[1:27:48] and just trying to, you know, figure out
[1:27:50] what's even being said. But, uh, that's
[1:27:53] how I know God. He He talks to us by his
[1:27:55] word.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; He reveals to us himself by his word.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But I say that because God, he fixed my
[1:28:03] brain.
[1:28:05] God God, he healed my mind.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; He He said, "Be not conformed to this
[1:28:11] world,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[1:28:15] your mind."
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; And the word of God is true.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; But let's let's move on. Let's go in
[1:28:24] some of these maybe some of these other
[1:28:26] situations. That's just mine, but let's
[1:28:28] look at some of our other uh brothers
[1:28:30] and sisters.
[1:28:32] You know what about Joseph?
[1:28:35] Everybody know the story of Joseph.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; You imagine
[1:28:40] you imagine being rejected.
[1:28:43] Maybe you don't have to imagine it.
[1:28:44] Maybe it's happened. Maybe it's happened
[1:28:46] to you. Maybe maybe people start looking
[1:28:49] down on you because of whatever you you
[1:28:53] plug in the situation there
[1:28:55] and they start kind of envying you or or
[1:29:00] maybe thinking all kinds of evil
[1:29:02] thoughts about you because of your
[1:29:04] experience with God or whatnot.
[1:29:07] And so that's what happened to Joseph
[1:29:10] because he was spiritual because he had
[1:29:12] a he had a a gift and he had favor with
[1:29:15] his father and we know the things
[1:29:18] and his brothers, they decided to throw
[1:29:21] him into a pit. First, they said, "You
[1:29:23] know what? Maybe we'll kill him. And if
[1:29:25] somebody didn't stand up, then they
[1:29:26] would have done that."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; They're like, "Well, let's throw them
[1:29:29] into the pit and maybe we'll maybe we'll
[1:29:32] uh maybe we won't.
[1:29:35] Then they sell him into slavery,
[1:29:39] you know." And we hear so much in the
[1:29:41] modern day about um the sins of the past
[1:29:45] of this country and the slavery and all
[1:29:47] that. We know I mean yeah we talk about
[1:29:50] that and it was horrible. And maybe that
[1:29:53] gives us a little glimpse of of how ugly
[1:29:57] a situation
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; that the children of Israelite was
[1:30:01] Israel was in
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; and that Joseph was in. You know, I I
[1:30:05] went to uh Ghana one time and there's a
[1:30:08] place called Cape Coast and that's where
[1:30:11] uh a huge portion of slaves that was
[1:30:13] their last um that was their last time
[1:30:17] that they had feet in Africa. And from
[1:30:20] that castle, they would go out and go
[1:30:23] wherever they were going to go. And a
[1:30:24] lot of them died on the journey, as you
[1:30:26] know, maybe. But I was in there and
[1:30:29] there was dungeons in the in the bottom
[1:30:32] of the castle. dungeon dungeons. I've
[1:30:36] never seen anything like this. I mean, I
[1:30:38] was It was a spiritual moment for me
[1:30:41] walking through that and I was looking
[1:30:42] and they'd have a little little squares
[1:30:44] on the wall, not bigger than these
[1:30:45] pictures here. And if the sun was not on
[1:30:49] that side of the castle, they were in
[1:30:50] total darkness. And only when the sun
[1:30:53] would come on that side, they would have
[1:30:54] a little bit of light. And they would
[1:30:57] pack hundreds of them, 300 maybe or more
[1:31:01] in a place maybe as wide as this row and
[1:31:03] not even as long.
[1:31:05] And they just they all live there for
[1:31:08] months at a time. And they would throw
[1:31:10] food in a hole, you know. It was like it
[1:31:15] was such an ugly disgusting condition
[1:31:18] that these slaves were in, you know, and
[1:31:22] and I I just it makes me
[1:31:26] cuz God, you know,
[1:31:29] God shows you things and stuff like
[1:31:30] that.
[1:31:32] That's the condition that each one of
[1:31:35] you were in.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; That's the condition that I was in. You
[1:31:39] might have not been there physically,
[1:31:41] but spiritually Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; You were you were barely being
[1:31:45] maintained.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You were living in filth.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; You know that they were living in filth.
[1:31:51] They had no toilets in there. They had
[1:31:53] no bathrooms in there. They were just
[1:31:55] smooshed together. They were living in
[1:31:58] the filthiest conditions you can
[1:31:59] imagine. And spiritually speaking,
[1:32:02] that's what we were living in. Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; That's where we are at
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; before the the the great emancipator
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; came and did what he did to set us free,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; you know, and I I just can't imagine.
[1:32:17] And I'm going off my notes a little bit,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; but I I can imagine that if one of those
[1:32:22] slaves got an opportunity to be free
[1:32:26] from that condition,
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; to to be set free from they where they
[1:32:31] were, and enter this enter the light,
[1:32:34] come out of the dungeon, have a bath,
[1:32:36] get cleaned up.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And then they they said, "All
[1:32:40] you got to do is go down there and tell
[1:32:44] somebody where the door's at,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; and the rest of them can go free, too."
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Do you think that slave would keep it to
[1:32:51] himself? You think he would hold that
[1:32:54] back knowing the condition of his
[1:32:56] brothers and sisters? Or would he go
[1:32:58] down in the dungeon and tell him, "You
[1:33:00] can be free.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; The door's that way. There's light.
[1:33:04] There's food. There's water. Whatever
[1:33:07] you have need of, go that way.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's my desire.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; That's my desire. That's that's that's
[1:33:15] what I that's what I do.
[1:33:18] You can be free this morning
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; from the darkness that the devil has
[1:33:22] placed you in.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; The thing is, it's a bluff. He tricked
[1:33:25] you into staying there. You don't have
[1:33:27] to stay there. You could walk out of the
[1:33:29] dungeon,
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; walk towards this Jesus,
[1:33:34] you know, but some but sometimes for
[1:33:37] Joseph, he had to go through this. He
[1:33:40] had to go through this. But I'm going to
[1:33:41] move move along. The Bible says, Joseph
[1:33:44] says, "But as for you, you thought evil
[1:33:48] against me."
[1:33:51] You know, the world thinks evil against
[1:33:53] you. People think evil against you. They
[1:33:57] try to do harmful things. The devil, he
[1:33:59] thinks evil against you.
[1:34:03] He's just He's just playing into the
[1:34:05] hand of God, though.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He He is just playing in the hand of
[1:34:10] God.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; He He hates it. He really wants to win,
[1:34:15] and he tries very hard,
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; but he keeps losing.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; But God meant it unto good
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; to bring to pass as it is this day to
[1:34:31] save much people alive.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; I don't have all the time to go into
[1:34:37] each one of these stories, but I just
[1:34:38] want to hit them to kind of bring out
[1:34:40] this point.
[1:34:43] See, he had to go
[1:34:46] into the dungeon, be rejected of his
[1:34:49] family. Brother Brandham said he was a
[1:34:51] perfect type. The
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; perfect type.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; You know, and and he had to he had to uh
[1:34:57] be falsely accused, thrown into prison,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; but everything he touched prospered
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; because God had a purpose for him. And
[1:35:09] all the trouble that he went through
[1:35:10] being separated from his family, he
[1:35:12] loved his dad. No doubt. He he loved he
[1:35:15] loved being uh a part of the tribe and
[1:35:18] having his little place, you know, tell
[1:35:20] on his brothers and things. He he had a
[1:35:22] good spot.
[1:35:25] He But now he's in a in a horrible
[1:35:27] condition, falsely accused.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Everything he tries he tries to do good
[1:35:32] and and bad things keep happening.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Has that ever happened to you?
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; You're you're trying to do good. You're
[1:35:39] in you're in a bad situation and you're
[1:35:41] just trying to do good and more bad
[1:35:44] things happen.
[1:35:46] Well, hold on.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Just hold on. Could anything good come
[1:35:51] out of that? Just come and see.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Just come and see.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; What could God do? What could God do
[1:35:58] with it? If you have faith in God, he
[1:36:01] can do wonder wondrously.
[1:36:04] Marvelously.
[1:36:08] Yeah. I got a couple other points. You
[1:36:10] think anybody I I think you guys are
[1:36:12] maybe you're not some of you, but it
[1:36:15] looks like we we got some from all walks
[1:36:17] and all and it's good. It's great.
[1:36:19] That's that's the way it works.
[1:36:22] You know, we come into Christ or maybe
[1:36:25] we're just interested. Maybe like I
[1:36:28] said, these these different these
[1:36:29] different brothers, these different
[1:36:31] people had a different encounter at a
[1:36:33] different time
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; and they had a different response,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; but the end result was the same.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; So
[1:36:43] maybe you don't know the story, maybe
[1:36:44] you do. Tamar and Judah,
[1:36:48] if you that's in uh Genesis 38. I'm not
[1:36:51] going to go through it all, but I'll run
[1:36:53] through it real briefly.
[1:36:55] So Tamar was Judah's firstborn son's
[1:36:58] wife. She was a Canaanite.
[1:37:02] And and the law says, well, first of
[1:37:06] all, Judah's first son, he wasn't a real
[1:37:08] good guy. So God God killed him. God
[1:37:12] slew him. That's what the Bible says. Um
[1:37:14] and left her a widow. Now, the law says
[1:37:17] that if there was uh brothers that could
[1:37:20] marry her to keep the the lineage of the
[1:37:23] of the other brother going, then they
[1:37:26] were to marry her.
[1:37:29] So, Judah gave one of his other sons. He
[1:37:31] had three sons. Gave the other son to
[1:37:34] her and he wasn't the best guy either.
[1:37:38] He wouldn't do what he was required to
[1:37:40] do. And God took his life as well.
[1:37:44] Then Judah promised Tamar that that okay
[1:37:48] when my last son gets old enough you can
[1:37:50] marry him and bring forth seed.
[1:37:54] Now this the story is so great I can't
[1:37:56] get into all of it. It's really
[1:37:58] beautiful. You know you know Jesus he
[1:38:01] was promised to come out of the line of
[1:38:03] Judah.
[1:38:05] He was promised to come out of the line
[1:38:06] of Judah
[1:38:09] and uh it didn't look like there was
[1:38:11] much hope. look like a pretty bad
[1:38:14] situation.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Really look like how how could how could
[1:38:18] God fulfill his promise?
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; You know, you you might be in a place in
[1:38:22] life, you're looking at situations in
[1:38:24] life and things the way it's going, and
[1:38:27] the devil might tell you, "How is God
[1:38:29] going to fulfill this promise to you?
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; How is he going to save your kids? How
[1:38:34] is he going to save your grandkids? How
[1:38:36] how is he going to fix this addiction?
[1:38:38] How is he going to fix this, that, or
[1:38:39] the other?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; How is he going to do it? It doesn't
[1:38:42] look like a good thing can come out of
[1:38:44] their situations or the situation that's
[1:38:47] uh at hand.
[1:38:50] Just like Tamar and Judah. Now, now
[1:38:53] Tamar,
[1:38:55] she she really wanted to bring forth
[1:38:59] children.
[1:39:01] She uh well, we we'll we'll kind of fast
[1:39:05] forward, but what she did was she she
[1:39:07] disguised herself as a prostitute
[1:39:10] and placed herself where she knew Judah
[1:39:13] would be coming by, Judah, her
[1:39:14] father-in-law
[1:39:16] and she she tricked him to go in onto
[1:39:19] her and and conceive a child.
[1:39:24] And you know, she took some certain
[1:39:26] things. She had a plan. She was kind of
[1:39:28] mischievous, huh? There was a lot of
[1:39:29] deceit going on. There was a lot of
[1:39:32] immorality going on. There was a lot of
[1:39:34] lying going on. You know, Judah, he he
[1:39:37] he was lying, too. He told her that he
[1:39:40] would, but out of fear that that the
[1:39:41] same thing would happen to his last son,
[1:39:43] trying to protect the promise.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we try to protect
[1:39:48] the promise.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Or sometimes we try to bring the promise
[1:39:52] to pass.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; We try to get when we get our hands all
[1:39:55] over it and we wreck the promise itself.
[1:39:58] We we interrupt it. We can't stop it.
[1:40:01] Nothing's going to stop it. But we might
[1:40:02] interrupt it.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; And we might make things a little bit
[1:40:05] more challenging than they had to be.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; But if we could just stay with the word
[1:40:10] of God, stay with our own word. We say
[1:40:12] we trust him. We say we'll follow him.
[1:40:15] We'll say we'll do these things. Well,
[1:40:17] let's do it. And allow God to work it
[1:40:19] out in our lives.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; He'll bring it to pass.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; If God had said it, he'll do it.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Period.
[1:40:27] And that's and that's just the way he
[1:40:29] is.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; That's the way this Jesus that we serve
[1:40:32] is.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Well, try to make it a shorter story.
[1:40:38] She did conceive. And then they went and
[1:40:41] they told on her and they said, you
[1:40:42] know, Tamar, your daughter-in-law, she
[1:40:45] played a harlot and now she's pregnant.
[1:40:48] And Judah said, well, she needs to be
[1:40:51] burned.
[1:40:53] You know,
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; he was going to kill her.
[1:40:56] But then she had those little tokens
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; to prove
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; what happened.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; And Judah said, "You're more righteous
[1:41:07] than I am."
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; You know, and out of that, out of all
[1:41:11] that mess,
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; out of all that trouble,
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; that's where Jesus came from.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; God chose that line, that lineage. It's
[1:41:22] it's in Matthew that lineage to bring
[1:41:25] forth the Messiah.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, think of that.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; There there's more stories. We know we
[1:41:32] know Rahab.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Same situation. Not same exactly, but
[1:41:36] she was also a harlot.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Also a a uh condemned situation in our
[1:41:41] eyes today.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; If we're looking at somebody like that,
[1:41:45] we're looking at a a somebody, you know,
[1:41:48] she lied too.
[1:41:50] They asked her, "Hey, did the spies Did
[1:41:52] you see anybody? Did you see somebody
[1:41:54] coming here? We're looking for them."
[1:41:58] Oh, yeah. No, they're not here. They
[1:41:59] They left.
[1:42:01] She lied. They were hiding on the roof.
[1:42:05] Could any good situation come from that?
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Her whole house, not just her, but her
[1:42:12] whole house was saved
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; because of what she did. Because she
[1:42:16] believed the word of God.
[1:42:18] You know, you might be in a in a dark,
[1:42:20] messy situation, but you believe the
[1:42:23] word of God and and you and your whole
[1:42:26] house
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; could be saved.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; You see, God, he's not a respector of
[1:42:32] per persons.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; If he done it for one,
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; he'll do it for another. And if he'll do
[1:42:38] it for another, he'll do it for you. If
[1:42:41] you just stand on that same word, stand
[1:42:44] in that same place and approach it the
[1:42:47] same way. Brother Brandham said, "God is
[1:42:50] obligated."
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; You know, all all these situations
[1:43:00] I think of Egypt back to the slavery
[1:43:03] thing. Can you can you imagine 400 years
[1:43:08] to to some it never ended?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; They lived, they died.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; They had children, they lived, they
[1:43:17] died.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; And all the while there's people
[1:43:21] believing God's word.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You know, we some of you have been doing
[1:43:26] this longer than me, a lot longer. And
[1:43:30] you see people come and go. You think
[1:43:32] you see things happen,
[1:43:34] you see dark situations, people go back
[1:43:37] into slavery, people people do all those
[1:43:40] things,
[1:43:42] but you remain in the promise.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; You know that good things can come of
[1:43:49] this.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; You know that that there there's there's
[1:43:53] light and
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; go.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; You know that darkness might be all
[1:43:56] around and death might be all around,
[1:43:59] but there's a reason for it. And all you
[1:44:02] got to do is believe the word of God and
[1:44:05] act on the word of God. And you don't
[1:44:07] have to be a part of that.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; You could be separated from that.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And God can show his glory
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; But in order to do that, he had to have
[1:44:18] the other.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; What about Paul and Silas?
[1:44:29] say Acts uh Acts 16:22. We'll read this
[1:44:32] little portion.
[1:44:34] I like this.
[1:44:39] He said, "And the multitude rose up
[1:44:40] together against them, and the
[1:44:43] magistrates rent off their clothes and
[1:44:45] condemned to beat them." Now, a little
[1:44:48] backstory. I'm not going to read the
[1:44:49] whole thing, but they were there
[1:44:50] preaching the gospel and uh this diver,
[1:44:54] which is like a a witch or a fortune
[1:44:56] teller, started following them around,
[1:44:58] telling them that they come from God and
[1:45:00] and you know, saying these are men of
[1:45:02] God and they have the word of God. And
[1:45:05] Paul kind of got sick of it because she
[1:45:07] was doing it for a while. So he cast
[1:45:10] that demon off of her and her handlers,
[1:45:13] the one that were making money off of
[1:45:14] her her um witchcraft. They got mad and
[1:45:18] they started an uprising and this is
[1:45:20] what it resulted in.
[1:45:22] And when they had laid many stripes upon
[1:45:24] them, they cast them into prison ch uh
[1:45:29] charging the jailer to keep them safely.
[1:45:33] who having received such a charge,
[1:45:35] thrust them into the inner prison and
[1:45:38] made their feet fast in the stocks.
[1:45:42] Let's go to 31. Let's just jump down
[1:45:43] there.
[1:45:47] Now, we're skipping some for time sake,
[1:45:50] but
[1:45:52] basically they found theirel in a bad
[1:45:54] situation. They praised God anyways and
[1:45:57] God set them free. All right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, now here they are. Now
[1:46:01] this jailer finds himself in a bad
[1:46:04] situation.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; He finds himself, oh, I was doing things
[1:46:08] against God. And this God is actually
[1:46:11] real.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; That that I found myself in that
[1:46:15] situation before. I was doing things
[1:46:17] against God. I was out of the will of
[1:46:20] God. I I was I I I rejected his way out
[1:46:24] at the time. Not completely, not fully.
[1:46:27] Can't do it. Neither can you. By God's
[1:46:29] grace,
[1:46:31] But in the flesh, that's what I was
[1:46:32] doing.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; In my mind, that's what I was doing.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; And and this jailer, maybe not knowing,
[1:46:39] but now he knows, found himself in a bad
[1:46:42] situation.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; And he was going to kill himself.
[1:46:47] He was gonna because, well, all these
[1:46:50] prisoners have escaped. And Paul said,
[1:46:52] "Don't do it. Don't do it. We're still
[1:46:55] here." you know,
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; and then Paul gave him the way out.
[1:47:01] Ain't that something?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; In Paul's bad situation,
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; in Paul's dark circumstance,
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; he was able to in in Paul's prison, he
[1:47:11] was literally in prison, he was able to
[1:47:13] free somebody else.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; If he never ended up in that situation,
[1:47:20] this jailer would have not had the
[1:47:22] opportunity.
[1:47:25] See, God has a way of doing things.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Believe on the Lord
[1:47:32] Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,
[1:47:35] and thy house." And they spoke unto him
[1:47:38] the word of the Lord to all that were in
[1:47:41] the house.
[1:47:44] And he took them the same hour of the
[1:47:46] night and washed their stripes and was
[1:47:48] baptized he in all his straight way.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:47:56] Glory.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; I can't wait to meet I can't wait to
[1:48:00] meet that guy.
[1:48:03] You know, I can't wait to meet all these
[1:48:06] that just they recognize something and
[1:48:09] responded when they heard the truth.
[1:48:13] And that's why many of you are here this
[1:48:14] morning.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; You might not even know that you heard
[1:48:17] the truth yet.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; You might not even know that you're
[1:48:20] responding. You might not know what has
[1:48:22] drawn you here this morning.
[1:48:25] But there's something
[1:48:27] rather somebody
[1:48:29] that has drawn you to this place.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; So that you can hear from him.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; So that you can come and see.
[1:48:42] Jonah,
[1:48:44] this is my guy.
[1:48:47] I I can relate.
[1:48:50] Jonah
[1:48:52] running from God,
[1:48:55] finding himself in a great fish, which
[1:48:59] how I relate, a great trial.
[1:49:02] Running from God, doing the opposite of
[1:49:05] what God told me to do. And now I'm in
[1:49:08] this great trial, this belly of
[1:49:10] darkness, this slop.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And there's no way out seemingly
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; and and really, I mean, you got to put
[1:49:20] yourself in the feet of Jonah
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; just for a moment. Brother Brandham said
[1:49:25] they tied him. They they tied him up and
[1:49:29] and they were trying to figure out why
[1:49:31] the why was the gods angry with them.
[1:49:35] They were about to go down in the ship.
[1:49:36] They were on the sea. And so they cast
[1:49:40] lots and guess what? It was Jonah. You
[1:49:42] know, hey, they they still didn't want
[1:49:45] to throw him out,
[1:49:48] but they tied him up and they threw him
[1:49:51] over in the midst of a raging sea.
[1:49:55] And to top that off,
[1:49:58] a big fish eats him.
[1:50:02] like that's a pretty bad situation,
[1:50:06] you know, h how could it get any worse?
[1:50:11] Well,
[1:50:12] Jonah might have been wondering,
[1:50:17] there's no good in this. I messed up. I
[1:50:21] met you. You know, we hear the end
[1:50:22] story, but this was a person who had a
[1:50:26] brain and a mind just like you do, who
[1:50:28] had thoughts and he was in a bad
[1:50:30] situation. So just put yourself there.
[1:50:32] If you were ever in a bad dark situation
[1:50:35] and the thoughts that the devil gave
[1:50:37] you, no doubt Jonah had them.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "If you think you
[1:50:43] have symptoms, what about Jonah?"
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; See, Jonah, he had them
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; and he was in there. And but there was
[1:50:52] something inside of him. It wasn't
[1:50:55] necessarily the place in the belly of
[1:50:57] the well, but it was the place inside of
[1:51:00] Jonah that that recognized that there
[1:51:03] was a promise and there was a truth and
[1:51:06] all he had to do was was act upon it.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; He, you know, he believed it because he
[1:51:13] acted on it.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; so he acted upon it. And guess what God
[1:51:19] did?
[1:51:21] He delivered him out of the depths of
[1:51:24] the sea, out of the belly of the well,
[1:51:27] and the well puked him out on the on the
[1:51:29] shore of Nineveh where he was supposed
[1:51:32] to go in the first place.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; But God used that situation because
[1:51:40] that's the only way Nineveh would accept
[1:51:42] it.
[1:51:44] They were worshiping that that false
[1:51:46] fish god.
[1:51:48] And you know, I thought often I was in
[1:51:50] the belly of alcoholism and and drugs
[1:51:53] and depression. And one day I got spit
[1:51:56] out on the shore.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And I can tell people,
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; you don't have to worship that false
[1:52:03] god.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in that beast.
[1:52:06] You can be free.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; You can live a victorious life.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is repent from what
[1:52:13] you're doing and look towards the same
[1:52:15] promise I'm looking at.
[1:52:21] What good can come out of that?
[1:52:23] You know that situation?
[1:52:26] Backsliding preacher. You know, Brother
[1:52:28] Brandon preaches it both ways.
[1:52:31] Backsliding, but also in the perfect
[1:52:32] will of God.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; You figure it out.
[1:52:36] I just believe it.
[1:52:40] You know, he he took that guy.
[1:52:44] And when Jesus came,
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; he said this about that situation. For
[1:52:50] as Jonah was three days and three nights
[1:52:52] in the wells belly, so shall the Son of
[1:52:54] Man be three days and three nights in
[1:52:56] the hearts of the earth, in the heart of
[1:52:58] the earth. The men of Nineveh shall rise
[1:53:00] in judgment with this generation, and
[1:53:02] shall condemn it, because they repented
[1:53:05] at the preaching of Jonas. And behold, a
[1:53:07] greater than Jonas is here.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; God in flesh
[1:53:16] called back to that situation and
[1:53:19] identified himself with it. Not only
[1:53:22] that, but the the very thing that we're
[1:53:25] all looking to, the very thing that
[1:53:27] everybody was looking to. He took that
[1:53:30] guy who was running from his presence
[1:53:33] and made him an example of the
[1:53:35] resurrection
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; of the way back, the redemption, the
[1:53:42] fellowship back with God. He He took
[1:53:44] that guy and he said, "As that guy was,
[1:53:46] so will the Son of Man be." Amen.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, what good can come out of that
[1:53:53] place?
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Who hath believed our
[1:54:02] report? And to whom is the arm of the
[1:54:05] Lord revealed?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; For he shall grow up before him as a
[1:54:10] tender plant, and as a root out of a dry
[1:54:12] ground. He hath no form nor calmliness.
[1:54:17] and when ye shall see him, there is no
[1:54:19] beauty that we should desire him.
[1:54:24] Not only did they think Nazareth wasn't
[1:54:26] good enough, they thought the actual
[1:54:28] human being.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; What good can come out of this?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't anything to look at.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; You know, our our lives, us, we're
[1:54:42] nothing to look at. Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; We're nothing to ad uh aspire to be. At
[1:54:48] least I'm not. I can just speak for
[1:54:49] myself.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Nobody aspired. And I'm with good
[1:54:53] company.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; What the best company.
[1:55:01] The Bible says nobody desired that.
[1:55:05] We'll drop a few more. And it tells us
[1:55:06] what nobody desired. And And I just love
[1:55:10] I just love the scriptures. I love it.
[1:55:14] Who had believed it? Who believed this
[1:55:16] report? Who who though there was nothing
[1:55:19] to desire, who desired it?
[1:55:23] Who whoever
[1:55:25] desired it? Whoever believed it, to them
[1:55:29] it was revealed who that was.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; And who that was, he did this for us.
[1:55:37] Talk about an ugly and dark situation.
[1:55:43] It said, "But he was wounded for our
[1:55:45] transgressions.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; The chastisement of our peace was upon
[1:55:53] him, and with his stripes we are healed.
[1:55:58] All we like sheep have gone astray."
[1:56:01] We've all been in bad situations, huh?
[1:56:03] We all went the opposite way.
[1:56:06] We have turned everyone to his own way.
[1:56:11] And the Lord hath laid on him the
[1:56:14] iniquity of us all.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Every person in here,
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; every person of the world, not just what
[1:56:25] you did yesterday, not just what you've
[1:56:28] done today, this morning, even not what
[1:56:31] you've done just in your lifespan, but
[1:56:34] what you'll do tomorrow and the day
[1:56:36] after if the Lord carries. And not just
[1:56:39] you, but everybody in the world. He put
[1:56:42] the iniquity on himself
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; and he took the beating
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; and he and he took he took the jarring
[1:56:50] and the and the ma being made fun of and
[1:56:52] the pulling of the beard and they spit
[1:56:55] on him and they put this big heavy cross
[1:56:58] on his back and they took a crown of
[1:57:00] thorns and they stuck it on his head and
[1:57:03] as he was screaming in agony I I don't
[1:57:06] imagine his mom thought this is good. I
[1:57:09] don't imagine Mary thought this is a
[1:57:11] good situation.
[1:57:13] I don't imagine anybody standing around
[1:57:15] witnessing that thought this is a good
[1:57:18] thing. I imagine maybe some of them
[1:57:20] might have said if I was standing there
[1:57:22] and thinking could there anything good
[1:57:25] come of this?
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; What good can come of this?
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, why are they doing this to him?
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; What? How could they do this to him?
[1:57:35] He's done nothing wrong.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And even his friends,
[1:57:39] they reject they they they uh denied
[1:57:42] him.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; You know, the ones he was walking with
[1:57:47] and talking with and
[1:57:50] they loved him, no doubt, but fear
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; but fear,
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; got a hold of them.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; And they didn't have the courage or
[1:58:01] strength.
[1:58:03] They would get it one day though. Praise
[1:58:05] the Lord.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, you don't have to be
[1:58:08] in that situation.
[1:58:10] You can have it now.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; You can have it now. But Peter, he
[1:58:16] wasn't as fortunate as you. So, he had
[1:58:18] to deny Christ.
[1:58:21] He couldn't he couldn't beat he couldn't
[1:58:23] beat the word of the Lord. So, he had to
[1:58:24] do it. No doubt feeling guilt and shame.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And then seeing this happen.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; You know, Judas, Judas, he regretted
[1:58:35] what he did.
[1:58:37] He wished he could take it back,
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; but it was too late for him, you know,
[1:58:42] and and he must have thought he must he
[1:58:45] he didn't believe it. He couldn't
[1:58:47] believe it. It's it's a that's a hard
[1:58:50] thing. Some people just can't believe
[1:58:52] it. But that don't give that don't stop
[1:58:55] us from trying.
[1:58:57] That don't stop me from trying. I don't
[1:59:00] care what they say about me or what they
[1:59:01] think. I don't care what they've said or
[1:59:03] what they've done. You know my I told my
[1:59:06] testimony last I keep calling back to
[1:59:08] that but if you were here my friends
[1:59:11] killed one of my other friend.
[1:59:14] They killed him then they try to cover
[1:59:16] it up and um you know they got busted
[1:59:23] and
[1:59:25] it's just a terrible thing. It's a it
[1:59:27] was a terrible terrible thing.
[1:59:30] And I and I thought, you know, I was
[1:59:32] thinking on this and I thought he didn't
[1:59:36] they didn't mean to do it is what the
[1:59:39] evidence shows. Things got out of hand.
[1:59:43] It happened and then instead of calling
[1:59:45] for help, they try to cover it up.
[1:59:49] And you know, one of them was my my
[1:59:52] really good friend.
[1:59:54] Um not the one that passed away, he was
[1:59:56] also a friend. We all friends together,
[1:59:58] all of us.
[2:00:00] But this one was my friend and he had a
[2:00:03] hard life. He had a real hard life. Um
[2:00:06] his mom was a street lady and on drugs
[2:00:11] and she had so many children and she
[2:00:13] didn't know where any of them were at
[2:00:14] besides these two. She had two children
[2:00:16] that uh were still together. Everybody
[2:00:18] else was all spread out. And his and his
[2:00:21] grandma was his everything. She took
[2:00:23] care of him. She gave him shelter. did
[2:00:26] her best and at that same time she
[2:00:28] passed away and left him with the house
[2:00:31] and he had no way to support it and he
[2:00:33] was losing the house and and he was also
[2:00:36] uh an addict. So things were just out of
[2:00:40] his control. And then this happens,
[2:00:42] right? He wakes up. There's a sh there's
[2:00:47] a stuff going on downstairs in his house
[2:00:50] and two of his other friends are beating
[2:00:51] his other friend. Beat him up.
[2:00:55] And then they would go too far.
[2:00:57] And so
[2:00:59] they take the friend out and dump him in
[2:01:01] the in the uh river
[2:01:05] and he stays back and he tries to cover
[2:01:07] it up. Well, they all they all get
[2:01:10] caught and they all go to jail. Now he
[2:01:15] makes a deal and he gets out after a few
[2:01:17] years, but uh you know I that's just
[2:01:20] thing in my past. you know, it's a thing
[2:01:22] that happened in my past and and I moved
[2:01:25] on from that, right? I have moved on.
[2:01:26] I'm I'm I've been walking away from that
[2:01:29] past ever since. You know, the Bible
[2:01:31] says repent. Repent and be baptized.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; And repent just means turn from
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; You're turning from that old life and
[2:01:41] you're turning to Jesus.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I've been walking my walk towards
[2:01:46] Jesus.
[2:01:48] And sometimes God will bring
[2:01:52] now the the way God brings your past and
[2:01:55] the way the devil brings your past are
[2:01:56] two different things.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; And we need to recognize that.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; See, the devil would have told Jonah a
[2:02:03] little something different about his
[2:02:04] past. And maybe the Bible scholars of
[2:02:06] that time might have told Jonah's story
[2:02:08] a little different, but Jesus brought
[2:02:10] that past back up and it was different
[2:02:12] than anybody thought.
[2:02:15] So,
[2:02:18] I'm just saying this to say, you know,
[2:02:19] uh, ugly things, situations happen, but
[2:02:23] that shouldn't harden our hearts.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; That shouldn't turn us from the grace of
[2:02:27] God for others.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; So, I'm saying, not everybody can
[2:02:31] receive it.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; People live in a in a dark place. They
[2:02:35] live in a hard place. They live in a
[2:02:37] confused state. And there's nothing they
[2:02:40] can do about it except turn to Christ if
[2:02:42] they would.
[2:02:45] I was drinking coffee,
[2:02:47] getting ready, doing making my schedule
[2:02:50] and whatnot, and uh see this guy out of
[2:02:53] the corner of my eye. Can you know how
[2:02:55] you can just feel somebody staring at
[2:02:56] you? I knew he was just staring at me.
[2:02:59] So, you know, I'm doing my thing and
[2:03:00] then I look up and I recognize him, you
[2:03:04] know, and it was Kenny. Kenny was his
[2:03:07] name and he looked rough. Looked like
[2:03:11] life was not too friendly to him. And I
[2:03:14] can tell you of a truth. I can tell you
[2:03:18] by the grace of God when I looked at
[2:03:20] him, I just wanted to give him Jesus.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; I didn't think of the things that he's
[2:03:25] done. I didn't think of the place that
[2:03:27] he's been or the whatever transpired
[2:03:30] after all of that, the 14 years of life
[2:03:33] that he lived on the streets and all
[2:03:34] that. I didn't see that. I saw somebody
[2:03:37] who needs Jesus.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Somebody if they could only accept it,
[2:03:42] it can change their whole trae
[2:03:44] trajection in life.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; And so I said, "Kenny." And he just lit
[2:03:50] up.
[2:03:51] He just lit up
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; that I recognized him and that I would
[2:03:56] actually not ignore him
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; or put him down like the rest of the
[2:04:01] world and separate myself like the rest
[2:04:03] of the world, but I would invite him to
[2:04:05] have some coffee with me and maybe hear
[2:04:08] what Jesus did for me. Now, I I haven't
[2:04:11] seen him since. He hasn't come to my
[2:04:14] church. I don't know where he's at, but
[2:04:17] I I pray for the man.
[2:04:19] Pray God will will use that. We'll do
[2:04:22] something. I pray that God will will do
[2:04:25] something for that man that he would
[2:04:27] make a step towards Jesus.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And that's my prayer for for all of us.
[2:04:35] You know, that's why Christ died.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know how long I've been.
[2:04:48] You see, we too often look at these
[2:04:52] things
[2:04:53] naturally.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Nazareth, look at it naturally.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; How could something good come out of
[2:05:02] that natural place, of that that area of
[2:05:06] land, out of that community?
[2:05:11] You know, we look at things naturally.
[2:05:15] But but you see
[2:05:17] maybe in all these different situations,
[2:05:19] right? The woman at the well, we know
[2:05:21] her story too, huh?
[2:05:24] We look at it naturally and it looks
[2:05:26] like a impossible situation
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; and a hor and a horrible thing that
[2:05:32] there's no good in that. It's all bad.
[2:05:37] But you see God, he doesn't look to the
[2:05:40] natural place. You see all those people
[2:05:43] including you I believe
[2:05:45] come from somewhere else.
[2:05:49] They come from another place and it's a
[2:05:52] good place.
[2:05:54] It's a good place. I believe that before
[2:05:57] there was time
[2:06:00] that God ha had had you somewhere else.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; That God had you in mind. He had you in
[2:06:08] a place in his mind. Amen.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; And he had a desire in his mind for you
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; and all the things that you've had to go
[2:06:18] through, all the dark darkness and the
[2:06:21] trials and temptations that you've fell
[2:06:23] to in order that he can manifest this
[2:06:28] thing, this place that was in his mind.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; You see, this is what brother Brandham
[2:06:37] says about the woman at the well.
[2:06:40] You know, they would say she come from
[2:06:42] Samaria
[2:06:44] and she was a hybrid. Not only that, she
[2:06:47] was a prostitute.
[2:06:48] So, there was a lot of bad things. She
[2:06:51] didn't come from a good place. You know,
[2:06:54] Samaria,
[2:06:55] it's when Israel when they split, Judah
[2:06:59] took one, Israel took the other. Samaria
[2:07:01] was the capital of Israel. Every king
[2:07:04] after David or after Solomon was uh was
[2:07:08] evil. in Israel. And then the Assyrians
[2:07:11] came in and they mixed and they had the
[2:07:13] Samaritans.
[2:07:15] Now, that's where the Samaritans come
[2:07:16] from. Not only did they never repent,
[2:07:19] they went away from God. Then they
[2:07:20] hybrid with the enemies and and they
[2:07:23] weren't pure blood no more. It was a bad
[2:07:26] And not only that, she was a prostitute.
[2:07:31] Could any good thing come from that
[2:07:34] place?
[2:07:37] Brother Brandham says, "But here was a
[2:07:40] little ill-famed woman, a prostitute,
[2:07:44] down in her heart, well, she had a
[2:07:47] representation
[2:07:49] of one of God's thoughts."
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; There she was waiting waited in sin. But
[2:07:58] when she seen that happen, she said,
[2:08:01] "Sir, I believe you're a prophet. Amen.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; I know when the Messiah cometh, he'll
[2:08:07] tell us these things. What did it do? It
[2:08:11] cleansed her life.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the redeemer to her because
[2:08:18] he could lift her up from where she had
[2:08:21] come from.
[2:08:27] If he can do it for her
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; and he can do it for me
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; and there's something inside of you
[2:08:34] that that is brother B said do you feel
[2:08:36] that pulsating
[2:08:38] is there something when you hear the
[2:08:40] words of life say there's something to
[2:08:43] that
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; I I that sounds right
[2:08:48] that sounds good
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; could any good thing
[2:08:53] that pulsation
[2:08:55] He said she had representation in his
[2:08:59] thoughts.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm counting on.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm count. I'm not counting
[2:09:05] on my situations in life.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not counting on my good works.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Though when you meet him
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; and like you said, he pulled her out. He
[2:09:17] pulled her up. He cleansed her.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; That's what he'll do. That's what he'll
[2:09:24] do for you. That's what he's done for
[2:09:25] me. It wasn't by my own doing.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; I was I was just fine wallering.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; But when I recognized the condition that
[2:09:34] I was in, that wasn't good. There was
[2:09:37] much better.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; There was much better.
[2:09:42] Yeah, there it's right. The situation's
[2:09:45] not good. But can there be any good that
[2:09:47] comes out of it?
[2:09:53] Just read you some quotes here for the
[2:09:55] the last little bit of this. Is that
[2:09:57] okay?
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Try to finish this up.
[2:10:01] Said, "Notice, when Jesus came and
[2:10:03] manifested the word, because the word
[2:10:06] discerned the thoughts that was in the
[2:10:08] heart."
[2:10:09] As Hebrews 4 says, it will 4:12 that he
[2:10:14] would, the word was the discerner of the
[2:10:16] thoughts of heart. and he come as the
[2:10:19] son of man, the prophet. What happened?
[2:10:21] This priest with only intellectual
[2:10:23] learnings said it's a devil because
[2:10:27] that's what his denomination called it.
[2:10:29] What did it do? He had no
[2:10:31] representation. So it blacked him out.
[2:10:36] I think brother Paul might have read the
[2:10:38] quote where the religious spirit is the
[2:10:40] worst one.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't want that. Black you out.
[2:10:47] But there's another spirit that has
[2:10:49] representation, and that's what we want.
[2:10:53] But this little woman had nothing to
[2:10:57] present. She was a filthy and dirty as
[2:11:00] she could be. But notice way down in
[2:11:04] her,
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; she's got representation.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; See? And then she was looking for this
[2:11:11] to be made flesh.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:11:18] There's something in you.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; There's something in you that wants to
[2:11:22] see Jesus,
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; that wants to see the Christ manifested
[2:11:27] in flesh.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; There's something in you when you see it
[2:11:32] happen that comes to life
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; that says, "Oh, this is what they said
[2:11:38] would come."
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; And he says, "I'm it."
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. But I know when I seen
[2:11:46] it,
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; when I seen it, my whole life changed.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer what I used to be, but I'm
[2:11:54] something different than what the devil
[2:11:56] told me. I I'm I'm something different
[2:11:58] than the lies that he placed me in. I
[2:12:00] don't come from that place, but I come
[2:12:02] from another place.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; I have representation. And so do you. If
[2:12:08] you can just believe the word of God,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; ah believe the one he had sent. You can
[2:12:14] see him. You can know who Jesus is.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Representation.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; You see Jesus, he he he grew up in
[2:12:26] Nazareth. He wasn't from Nazareth.
[2:12:28] He wasn't from Bethlehem either.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory.
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Out of this evil age where the
[2:12:40] God of this age has blinded the eyes of
[2:12:42] people with the dogmas and
[2:12:44] denominations, out of that very age, God
[2:12:48] is choosing a people for his name."
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:01] The Bible says what and if
[2:13:05] so this is this is the uh quote that
[2:13:07] Jesus gave the religious
[2:13:10] gave the religious when they thought
[2:13:12] that's too much now you know we stuck
[2:13:15] around for the flesh and blood speech
[2:13:17] you know we don't know that we don't
[2:13:19] know what's going on there but we we'll
[2:13:20] stick around and then he went a little
[2:13:23] further
[2:13:24] and this is when they're like I'm out I
[2:13:27] can't I can't go there with you. That's
[2:13:30] too much. But for somebody with
[2:13:32] representation,
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; hallelujah,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; they stay right there and they say,
[2:13:37] "Where are we going to go?
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; We got nowhere else to go. For thou has
[2:13:42] the words of eternal life.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; We don't understand it all. We don't
[2:13:46] know what you're talking about, but we
[2:13:48] know that you are the Messiah."
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; We know that this is true.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "What? if you shall see the Son
[2:13:57] of Man ascend up where he was before.
[2:14:03] See, God, he Jesus, he didn't come from
[2:14:05] Nazareth. He didn't come from Bethlehem.
[2:14:08] He didn't come from Judah.
[2:14:11] He didn't come from Tamar. Yet, in the
[2:14:14] lineage, the Bible does say that
[2:14:17] that was where he came from out of in
[2:14:20] the flesh.
[2:14:22] But that's not where Christ came from.
[2:14:24] That's not where Christ is or was.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "What if you see me going back
[2:14:31] where I was before?"
[2:14:33] &gt;&gt; Where is he dwelling?
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; We We still good.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know how I see it's
[2:14:42] almost 12.
[2:14:43] Just I just want to bring it down. Let's
[2:14:46] bring it down a little closer.
[2:14:51] Call back to the scripture earlier.
[2:14:54] Then Jesus turned and saw them following
[2:14:55] and saith unto them, "What seek ye?"
[2:14:58] They said unto him, "Rabbi," which is to
[2:14:59] say, being interpreted, "Master, where
[2:15:02] dwellest thou?"
[2:15:06] You know, he saith unto them, "Come and
[2:15:09] see." They came and saw where he dwelt,
[2:15:11] and abode with him that day.
[2:15:16] You know, I've
[2:15:18] I've had that same question before.
[2:15:22] Where dwellest thou?
[2:15:25] Where is he? Where is he dwelling? Now,
[2:15:30] if you ever meet Jesus, you want to be
[2:15:32] wherever he's dwelling. If you ever come
[2:15:35] into real contact and relationship with
[2:15:38] him, there's a reason that they dropped
[2:15:41] everything and followed him around
[2:15:43] everywhere he went.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; They wanted to be with him.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; They wanted to be wherever he was
[2:15:50] dwelling. I want to dwell there.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Where is he dwelling? And I want to say
[2:15:57] where is he dwelling now?
[2:16:00] First Kings
[2:16:02] First Kings 8:27
[2:16:05] just to lay background.
[2:16:08] But God indeed dwell on But God indeed
[2:16:12] dwell on earth. Behold, the heaven and
[2:16:15] heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.
[2:16:17] How much less this house that I build
[2:16:20] it? Solomon speaking there. Isaiah
[2:16:24] 66:12, thus sayeth the Lord, the heaven
[2:16:27] is my throne, the earth is my foottool.
[2:16:29] Where is the house that ye build unto
[2:16:32] me? And where is the place of my rest?
[2:16:36] For all those things hath mine hand
[2:16:38] made, and all those things have been,
[2:16:41] sayeth the Lord. But to this man will I
[2:16:44] look, even to him that is poor and of a
[2:16:47] contrite spirit and trembleth at my
[2:16:51] word.
[2:16:54] That's where he's at.
[2:16:57] You want to know where God dwells?
[2:16:59] Where that scripture says he dwells.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "I made all the earth. I made
[2:17:04] all the heavens. I made all these
[2:17:06] things. The heavens is my throne. And
[2:17:08] the the earth is nothing but something
[2:17:09] to plant my feet on."
[2:17:12] He made all the universe and all the
[2:17:14] galaxy. Told the church the other night,
[2:17:16] the Almighty, the Almighty. You think of
[2:17:19] all the storms of the earth, the force
[2:17:21] of nature takes man out left and right.
[2:17:23] Whenever there's a flood, whenever
[2:17:25] there's a a hurricane, tornado,
[2:17:27] whenever there was a storm, man cannot
[2:17:31] stand against that. There's a lot of
[2:17:33] might in that. But God don't just have
[2:17:36] all that might though. He has that might
[2:17:39] too. He has that power, too. He has
[2:17:41] control over it. He showed it by putting
[2:17:44] his foot on the bow of the ship and
[2:17:45] saying, "Peace be still." He has power
[2:17:47] over it.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; But not only that, you know, the sun has
[2:17:52] storms, too.
[2:17:54] The sun has storms that are are
[2:17:57] thousands and thousands and thousands
[2:17:59] times bigger than our planet. And God
[2:18:02] has all that might. And if you look,
[2:18:05] there's numer you can't even count the
[2:18:07] galaxies and stars. And there's storms
[2:18:10] in all of them. And there's might and
[2:18:12] power and forces in all of them. And God
[2:18:14] has all that might.
[2:18:17] And he says, "Where am I? What house
[2:18:20] will you build me? You think you can
[2:18:22] contain me in a building?
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; You can contain You think you can
[2:18:26] contain me in a in a tabernacle built of
[2:18:28] hands?
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; Where did God choose to put all of this
[2:18:33] might?
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Where did God choose to put all this
[2:18:36] power?
[2:18:37] Where did God choose to dwell?
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, did he choose to dwell in great
[2:18:45] revelated teachings,
[2:18:47] great good preaching and all these
[2:18:49] different things, intellectual uhism
[2:18:54] trying to make you bigger in your mind?
[2:18:57] Is God dwelling there?
[2:19:01] He says, 'When you go to church on
[2:19:03] Sunday morning, do you look for the fine
[2:19:05] organ well-dressed minister, a rogue
[2:19:07] choir, a bunch of women with paint on?
[2:19:10] What do you look for? Some kind of
[2:19:11] society in the churches? You belong to
[2:19:14] this and that? What do you look for?
[2:19:18] That's about what you see. Listen here.
[2:19:20] No wonder when No wonder when you carry
[2:19:24] the flat gospel and see the Holy Ghost
[2:19:27] come in and make manifest amongst an
[2:19:28] oldfashioned bunch of people. It's
[2:19:30] foreign to you. It's hard for you to
[2:19:32] believe. As I said the other night about
[2:19:35] Joseph, it was hard for him to think of
[2:19:38] Mary being pregnant. How could she be
[2:19:40] that a holy little woman like that? And
[2:19:42] she said Gabriel visited her. But it was
[2:19:46] so unusual. It was so unusual for a
[2:19:48] thing like that. It never happened
[2:19:51] before.
[2:19:53] And that's where God dwells
[2:19:56] in the unusual to the carnal mind. But
[2:20:00] those who believe him to be the same
[2:20:02] yesterday, today, and forever. All
[2:20:05] things are possible. Every word that he
[2:20:09] promised will be fulfilled. It's the
[2:20:11] unusual thing that makes him God. He
[2:20:14] goes to the unusual. He makes everything
[2:20:17] unusual to the people. Yes, sir. All
[2:20:20] right.
[2:20:21] Musicians can come forward. I got a
[2:20:23] couple more quotes. We'll begin to
[2:20:25] close.
[2:20:27] Now, we're bringing it down to where God
[2:20:29] dwells.
[2:20:37] Now, they were they were too smart in
[2:20:40] that day.
[2:20:43] No longer a slave.
[2:20:47] They were too smart in that day to catch
[2:20:50] the meaning of God's simple way or doing
[2:20:53] things. It wasn't polished for them.
[2:20:56] It's got to be uh it's got to be
[2:20:59] polished. It's got to be highly ched or
[2:21:03] they miss it. Now, but the great Jehovah
[2:21:06] was hid in his word.
[2:21:09] And he made himself known to the people
[2:21:11] that believed in his word by saying uh
[2:21:15] by saving them and bringing to pass the
[2:21:18] simple message.
[2:21:21] The simple message of Noah, God brought
[2:21:24] it to pass. Now notice that
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:27] God's in his word.
[2:21:30] God dwells in his word. Not big mighty
[2:21:33] theologies or anything like that, but in
[2:21:36] his simple message.
[2:21:38] his simple message.
[2:21:41] The Bible says, "In the beginning was
[2:21:43] the word.
[2:21:45] The word was with God.
[2:21:48] The word was God.
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:53] And it became flesh and dwelt among us.
[2:21:56] Now, it didn't just remain among us.
[2:22:00] Though it's among us, but it didn't just
[2:22:03] remain among us.
[2:22:06] He didn't just remain
[2:22:08] like brother Levi sitting here. Jesus is
[2:22:11] not just sitting there
[2:22:13] in his fullness.
[2:22:18] He condescended a little bit lower.
[2:22:24] He came a little bit closer to home, I
[2:22:27] would say.
[2:22:30] Is that your home? is my home the home
[2:22:33] I'm talking about your home as well.
[2:22:39] He said there's only one real church.
[2:22:43] You don't join it. You're born in it.
[2:22:45] See? And if you're born in it, the
[2:22:47] living God works himself through you and
[2:22:50] making himself known. See, that's where
[2:22:53] God dwells in his church. God goes to
[2:22:57] church every day. I like that.
[2:23:01] just lives in the church. He just lives
[2:23:03] in church. He lives in you.
[2:23:07] You're his church. You are his church.
[2:23:11] You are the tabernacle that God dwells
[2:23:14] in.
[2:23:18] There's just a lot of good
[2:23:23] There's just a lot of good quotes.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; You want to hear a couple more?
[2:23:33] I'll just read them. Just listen. This
[2:23:36] is
[2:23:38] let that representation respond.
[2:23:42] Just let it let God minister to you. I
[2:23:44] said a lot of words up here, but if you
[2:23:46] don't remember anything that I said,
[2:23:48] just listen to these quotes
[2:23:51] and let that minister to the thing
[2:23:54] that's inside of you,
[2:23:57] to the good thing that comes from inside
[2:24:00] of you.
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:05] I see a man sitting here looking at me.
[2:24:08] He's had a little trouble in his life.
[2:24:11] That could be any of us, huh?
[2:24:13] [Music]
[2:24:14] He had the mumps when he was He's kind
[2:24:17] of got something on his heart. He's
[2:24:20] looking right at me. His children is all
[2:24:23] boys. He wants a girl now. You know that
[2:24:27] man is a preacher. Two, Mr. Bird.
[2:24:31] Reverend Mr. Bird, raise up your hand,
[2:24:33] sir. That's true, isn't it? God grants
[2:24:37] you your request, sir. Yeah. See how
[2:24:41] simple
[2:24:42] God dwells in simplicity. Do you believe
[2:24:45] that?
[2:24:48] That was the same one that was talking
[2:24:50] to the woman at the well.
[2:24:53] That quote right there in its simplicity
[2:24:57] was the same one that was talking to the
[2:25:00] woman at the well. How did he know he
[2:25:02] was a preacher? How do he know that he
[2:25:04] had boys only? And how did he know that
[2:25:07] he wanted a girl?
[2:25:11] [Music]
[2:25:14] God is in simplicity.
[2:25:17] [Music]
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; See, God don't dwell in big buildings.
[2:25:22] He dwells in your heart. See, God don't
[2:25:25] dwell in intellectual education. He's
[2:25:28] far from it. He dwells in humanity, in
[2:25:31] your heart. He dwells in his word, and
[2:25:35] his word comes into your heart and
[2:25:37] speaks itself out.
[2:25:39] and declare. He interprets his own word
[2:25:42] through you.
[2:25:44] He is trying to find somebody he can get
[2:25:47] a hold of to show that he is still God.
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:56] Could any good thing
[2:26:00] come out of your life?
[2:26:03] Could any good thing come out of
[2:26:05] somebody?
[2:26:07] When I was 14, 15 years old, they called
[2:26:10] me drunk John in my town.
[2:26:14] And when they would see me on the
[2:26:15] street, I was barely able to walk most
[2:26:18] of the time. Ask my sister.
[2:26:22] People would walk away from me. My own
[2:26:25] friends would not want to hang out with
[2:26:27] me when I was in that state
[2:26:30] because I was a drunk.
[2:26:33] And no doubt there was no good thing
[2:26:35] that anybody could see in that situation
[2:26:38] or condition.
[2:26:40] Could any good thing come out of
[2:26:42] something like that?
[2:26:46] My testimony is
[2:26:49] some good thing came out of that
[2:26:52] situation.
[2:26:55] You see, God, he takes a world of chaos
[2:26:58] without form and void and he transforms
[2:27:01] it into a garden of Eden into a
[2:27:04] beautiful paradise that sons and
[2:27:06] daughters can live on that that they can
[2:27:09] eat all they need to eat. They can
[2:27:10] fellowship with him at their leisure.
[2:27:13] Oh, he takes a chaotic world and he
[2:27:16] makes a beautiful one out of it. Could
[2:27:18] any good thing come out of that?
[2:27:20] Oh, the God that I serve can take a
[2:27:23] drunk and turn him into a preacher and
[2:27:26] give him the Holy Ghost that he can go
[2:27:28] and tell the world that God still saves
[2:27:32] and God is still real. And hold on,
[2:27:35] church, because God has good that can
[2:27:37] come out of your life.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; You love him this morning.
[2:27:43] You have covered me
[2:27:47] with a melody.
[2:27:49] [Music]
[2:27:51] You surround me with
[2:27:55] a song
[2:27:59] of deliverance
[2:28:02] from my enemies.
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:07] And all my tears
[2:28:10] have gone.
[2:28:14] I'm no longer
[2:28:16] a slave
[2:28:18] to fear.
[2:28:22] I am a child
[2:28:26] of God.
[2:28:29] I'm no longer
[2:28:31] a slave to fear.
[2:28:38] I am a child
[2:28:41] of God.
[2:28:44] From my mother's womb,
[2:28:48] you have chosen me.
[2:28:53] Love has called
[2:28:56] my name.
[2:29:00] I've been born again
[2:29:03] to your family.
[2:29:10] [Music]
[2:29:13] Hallelujah.
[2:29:15] I'm no longer a slave
[2:29:19] to fear.
[2:29:23] I am a child
[2:29:27] of God.
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:36] Hallelujah.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:29:46] Amen.
[2:29:49] This thing he's walking in my shoes.
[2:29:54] Maybe you don't know this song. Maybe
[2:29:55] you do.
[2:29:59] See,
[2:30:01] he used to walk on this earth
[2:30:05] with sandals
[2:30:07] on his feet.
[2:30:14] Many people would gather around
[2:30:20] just to hear him speak.
[2:30:22] [Music]
[2:30:25] With hands that heal the sick,
[2:30:31] open the eyes that could not see.
[2:30:36] Do you think that his spirit
[2:30:42] now lives inside of me.
[2:30:49] Now he's walking with my shoes,
[2:30:57] singing with my voice.
[2:31:02] Reaching out with my hand.
[2:31:06] Helping someone make the right choice.
[2:31:15] Smiling with my face,
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:22] showing me the way.
[2:31:27] I'm so glad that I can be a part.
[2:31:33] [Music]
[2:31:35] He's living in my heart
[2:31:39] [Music]
[2:31:42] with the voice that spoke and calm the
[2:31:47] angry sea.
[2:31:51] [Music]
[2:31:53] He said one day that you would do
[2:31:57] greater things than these.
[2:32:01] [Music]
[2:32:04] He forgave the man
[2:32:09] that held him to bet the tree.
[2:32:15] You think that his spirit
[2:32:20] now lives inside of me.
[2:32:27] Now he's walking with my shoes.
[2:32:35] Singing with my voice.
[2:32:38] [Music]
[2:32:40] Reaching out with my hand.
[2:32:44] helping someone make the right choice.
[2:32:50] Yes.
[2:32:51] [Music]
[2:32:52] Hey, smiling with my face,
[2:32:59] showing me the way.
[2:33:04] I'm so glad that I can be a part
[2:33:12] living in my heart. Let's bow our heads.
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[2:33:21] Lord, how we love you this morning
[2:33:26] and no doubt we know you're here,
[2:33:32] Lord. These are your children, Father.
[2:33:35] They they come and they worship you this
[2:33:37] morning and they sit through a quite a
[2:33:41] lengthy little message.
[2:33:44] But Lord, I ask that you would bless
[2:33:45] them. Lord, that you would reveal to
[2:33:48] them the representation that's inside of
[2:33:50] them. Lord, that they can come out of
[2:33:53] the place that they're in and the world
[2:33:55] can see the good, Father. the good that
[2:33:59] you placed in them before there was ever
[2:34:01] a world, before there was a spec.
[2:34:03] Father, in your mind, in your thoughts,
[2:34:05] you seen good in these lives. Lord, we
[2:34:08] ask that you would at this time help us
[2:34:11] to put all the things that hold us back
[2:34:14] in the past. May we lay him at the feet
[2:34:19] of you, Jesus.
[2:34:21] Lord, knowing that you care and that
[2:34:24] we're able to cast all of our cares and
[2:34:26] problems and burdens and past and shame
[2:34:28] and guilt all at your feet. It's already
[2:34:32] been paid for.
[2:34:34] Lord, help us to leave this place
[2:34:36] victorious, living the life that you
[2:34:39] called us to live.

[2:50:08] Even
[2:50:11] by
[2:50:12] my hands,
[2:50:16] my feet.
[2:50:18] But as long

[2:50:56] his hand
[2:50:59] and do this for me.
[2:51:04] [Music]
[2:51:10] So unworthy
[2:51:14] to live
[2:51:17] and not fit
[2:51:19] to kill.
[2:51:21] When the man on
[2:51:24] the cross,
[2:51:26] he put me in
[2:51:29] his will. He said that I
[2:51:34] could still

[2:51:42] Now I'm never
[2:51:45] will
[2:51:48] I
[2:51:50] understand
[2:51:52] why a king
[2:51:56] would leave
[2:51:58] his throne.
[2:52:03] And on
[2:52:06] the road
[2:52:08] of an earthly
[2:52:11] man
[2:52:13] to feel free
[2:52:16] of flesh
[2:52:19] and bone
[2:52:24] later
[2:52:27] walk
[2:52:29] down life's lordome
[2:52:32] path.
[2:52:34] that land
[2:52:37] to calary

[2:52:55] where that I
[2:52:57] could still
[2:53:00] go free.
[2:53:04] He said that I
[2:53:08] could still
[2:53:10] go free.
[2:53:13] [Music]
[2:53:15] So tell me what kind
[2:53:18] of man
[2:53:20] would reach down his hand
[2:53:26] and do this for me.
[2:53:32] [Music]
[2:53:36] I was so unworthy
[2:53:40] to live
[2:53:43] and not fit
[2:53:45] to kill.
[2:53:48] And the man on
[2:53:51] the cross,
[2:53:53] he put me in
[2:53:56] his will. He said that I
[2:54:01] could still
