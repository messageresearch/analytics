for [Music] [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] e [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everyone can we all stand thank the Lord for another Sunday amen let's all pray together Heavenly Father Lord we're grateful in our hearts that you saved us father you delivered us Lord from the present World from the things father that are not pleasing in your sight Lord we pray that there your blood would just cover everyone here today Lord that we a fresh anointing of your spirit would fall upon every heart and soul lord we we're hungry this morning Lord and we want to be fed by Your Word Lord Jesus just come amongst us today in a mighty way father let everything that would be said and done be to the glory of Jesus Christ Lord bless the young people in their Sunday school class and the teachers father have your way in every life we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen we're going to be continuing with qu questions and answers we'll be starting with question 176 and then just before 183 it'll be about 20 minutes and uh so thank the Lord for that amen let's all sing only believe only be only be all things are possible only believe only believe only be all all things are possible only be you may be seated brother Brandon what is the the name of the it'll be on the people of Revelations 3:12 I don't know he said give him a new name I I I don't know what that is see It'll be probably made no when we get there but I I don't know what it is now see see he is going to do that he give them a new name and if they just know themselves see now brother Brandon is there any Scripture uh permitting marriage after divorce this is very important it says important well uh that's the reason it wasn't pertaining to this um as far as I can see my brother or sister whoever it may be there isn't unless your companion's dead because the Bible said we're bound to them as long as they live so as as far as being any Scripture that's what was asked here is there scripture see is there any Scripture not as I can find see not as I can find because Paul said that the the married couple if the companion's dead then they freedom to marry whomsoever they will in the law but until then but watch you take it until death we far right that's it you done talk oath over that you see so I don't think there is now if it's if you found some and it's correctly well all all right but as far as myself I I don't find any what does see thou hurt not the oil and the wine mean in Revelations 66 it's the Holy Spirit we just got through that probably somebody know come in a little late for the message the for the other tap you see well hurt not the or and the wine what does the oral and wine mean the oral as we took it in symbol means the Holy Spirit see wine is um and oil is connected together in the Bible in worship see and the wine is we but that's where I got the idea of the stimulation wine stimulates and wine uh in its uh it's anti-type of its natural from stimulation is revelation I just think what stimulates the church Revelation okay so wine the new wine would be now watch the oil and wine went together in sacrifice went together in in the church worship now notice symbl together connected together you got a Concord you look you see a whole string where wine and oil is met together in worship if you got a A Prudence why it says up there now notice on this but now you see the oil is always the Holy Spirit we find that over in Ezekiel and we find it in the Old Testament we find it all through the New Testament why do we anoint why do we anoint the sick with or we anoint the sick with or because it symbolizes the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon them see also the wise virgin had or the unwise had no or Spirit see now that is the oral and then the wine if if if the oral represents represents God God is Spirit see God is word in the beginning was word word was with God word was made flesh and that was God now then if the word now in set here in a a natural form now the wine is the water like that the Revelation that reveals that uh interpretation of the word which stimulates the believer you see M they just never seen it before before my glory that's once stimulation of Revelation I didn't know that till the they sitting there either see now that's what the the oil and wine that was see not as the black horse rider and that was during the time of the Dark Age the third age of the of the church notice and in there there's just a little bit of it left just a little bit but don't hurt and I believe if you get that uh the uh third uh seal on tape you You' find it there where we explain it in detail in detail rather brother brandom is the Lamb's Book of Life and the Book of Life the same book sure well that's where all redemptions wrote in this book see their names are in you say well our names put on the Lamb's Book of Life brother brandom I I got it put on the other night no you didn't no you didn't you just found out it was on there because their names were written before the foundation of the world see uh that's it's all the same book see now brother Brandon is it true that that every Jew born since Christ came will be saved and who are the 144,000 are they the uh predestinated ones to be sealed with the Holy Ghost and what is their mission there's about three questions in one there but here first one is um is it true that ever a Jew born since Christ came into the world is to be saved no nothing will be saved only those whose names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you are Gentile that's all the book holds that mystery and the book is only unfolding it now not each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those names you you understand that now see the book doesn't say now um leil is to be saved in time of this church age or or arm and nville or or whoever no I don't to say that it just shows the mystery unfolds mystery what the thing is but we ourselves by faith believe it that's what I said to the someone said well there's nobody me trying it brother Bram said there's only be one saved out of Jeffersonville now see it's showing a parable that that that isn't that that isn't it there might be thousands save I don't know I hope every one of them saved see but I don't know but here's the way I want to believe it I'm that one you believe the same for you if you don't then there's something wrong with your faith you're not sure what you're doing how can you how can you walk up there in the face of death when you're not too sure whether you're saved or not how can you go down here and say to this crippled man laying here blinded and twisted up thus sayith the Lord rise up Jesus Christ makes you whole how can you stand that little cold stiff body laying there that's dead and been dead for hours and hours and laying there cold and stiff and say thus sayth the Lord rise up to your feet you better you have to know what you're talking about well say death claims everything it's all gone yeah but when the word of God is revealed and you know it's God that changes things now yes these Jews uh not not all the Jews will be saved no sir they will not be saved only those who when he's speaking of of Jew Jew just as a name that was given to him after they left uh I believe Nebuchadnezzar over began to call him Jew first because the tribe of Judah was taken there and is given the name of Jew now because it come down from Judea and they got the name of Jew but now Israel is different Israel and Jew is all together different every Jew every Jew isn't an Israelite no he's just a Jew but then Israel Paul never said all Jews will be saved he said all Israel will be saved why Israel's name that's that's the name of Redemption all the way back and all Israel will be saved but not all Juda Judaism will be saved see just like Gentiles there'll be a there's thousands times thousands of of people yes literally millions in these organizations and they call Christian Church of Christ and all such names as that that don't mean one thing that's not that don't mean to be saved people say now You' got to belong to this or that an organization certain organization if your name isn't on our book you're lost now that's C that's C see there's only one way you can be saved and that is not him that willth or him that run him that that is God who shows mercy and God by his for knowledge predestinated a church to Glory that's the one to save right your faith is so anchored there you say well my faith is Anchor there look back what kind of life you're living you see you're not even fit for there your anchor is wrong got on Sand instead of Ro the first Little Wave will throw it off let the word be revealed and my church don't teach that that shows right there you wasn't anchored on no rock using sand that's right so now you see now and the 144,000 uh are they the predestinated ones yes sir that's Israel spiritual Israel this think there will be millions of them in there I don't know how many is in there now I guess a whole group but they will not all be saved because they are in Judea you have any idea how many is there now I don't know but they're probably after this next persecution begin rise are accumulating by you know I've got a tape on them taking West with me now to to one of the the uh the Covenant Church which is it's just the old um oh I forget now it started the they have them down there in Africa Dutchy Farm uh a dut Reformed Church the Covenant is now if there's any of sitting here I'll tell you why you're still holding on to that old heidleberg catechism and that's exactly the reason you're still in the still Duty form so you might polish up by American name that's that's the thing behind it because you're teaching in that same catechism the old hle bir you ask your pastor if that isn't right see so um now notice this 144,000 they are predestinated ones to be sealed by the Holy Ghost yes sir that's exactly right right all right though if there's any now if I'm if I didn't answer suit you well uh uh maybe I'm I could be wrong see but this is the best of my knowledge you see this is the best of my knowledge brother benam uh as you have travailed or tra on the serpent seed oh I never noticed this and this is slipped up on me serent seed this week will it be in order to ask this question my friends have asked me to explain Genesis 4:1 and I can't will you help me it's it's all of the subject but anyhow I I I'll try my best by the help of god let's see now let me polish up a little bit I think that's where she said I got a son from The Lord I believe it is I think you said that uh I'm going check be sure CU I said to night seven instead of 700 instead of 7,000 so it makes me so nervous see and you just have to be watching an enemy on every side you're conscious of that you see yes that's it and uh Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived in be ke and said I have begotten a man from the Lord now I'm just going to answer you a question my brother or sister and I remember not not throwing to you no I'm trying to help you see I love you and I love the person who might have been a critical on it but I don't think this person is critical they said help me see because the people believes it but they're just not sufficient to uh posted by the spirit to know what to say to the person that's asking that now she's saying here what the question is no doubt that they're saying e said she gotten this man from the Lord how do you think life could ever come if it didn't come from the Lord be it right or wrong that's right who sent who sent Judas is cared into the world tell me that the Bible said he was born the son of predition just ask him that be like a worm in a lemon see see now you see they can't can't it is notice then if you want to take them a little more Technic look Eve talks here if you want to take it the language it's here which is written so it's hid from the ey wise of prudent Eve here the way it's taught that God was the one that she begotten this son by and he's a spirit and can't do it see I watch here if you want to know that I have gotten a a man from the Lord you could take make it sound but it's got to have his right interpretation yes sir no sir if that then the spirit and we always follow the nature of our parent you know that look at the baby the nature well then Adam was a Son of God Eve was a daughter of God right the first thing of the creation of God his SE all the way down and that he become who does the world belong to the devil if you want to and bring it right down through the geneologies and you find out that they were smart man now watch not from the first seed of the natural they died I got your minds open the first seed of the natural seed just ordinary good in order to preserve that Lon coming down that one died so another could raise up let be rebirthed again you catch it all just so you get it see there you are the perfect time e don't worry they haven't got one foot to stand on they they don't believe that be King's son but we have got a tape on that if you'd like here explain in the meek shall inherit the earth so that don't worry they haven't got one foot to stand on see they don't believe that be kain's son but we have got a tape on that if you'd like here explained in detail see no sir I seen I got a piece of paper up there where a science says now go to prove that Eve never eat an apple she had an apple I got the paper up at home now see there's a apple cot how how far can people that's a carnal mind then actually Moses never crossed the water he crossed to a sea of reeds brought Israel across at the upper end of the Dead Sea is a bunch of reads their whole sea of reads and just where the waters had been one time went down and Moses took a shortcut went around that way and the Orthodox Churches accepted it you see that the Orthodox Churches accepted it that was sold oh man can't you see that seed of the serpent that Antichrist the whole thing laying right there yes sir brother Brandon please pray for my little well that's a prayer request I say pray for my little grandson very ill with the flu he is in the Riverview hotel Lord Jesus this uh poor person here never wrote that just in vain she's seen you just uh deliberately remove even rheumatic fever from a little boy other night she knows that you're the great God and we offer our prayers for that little boy in the name of Jesus Christ may he be healed amen when somebody writes anything it's not in vain that they they got up no matter how simple it sounds to us and how much out there but but there's something behind it you see that lady that little boy something is the Elijah who comes to preach to the Jews the real man who lived on the Earth or will he be the spirit of Elijah in some other man now that's I'm afraid to say I don't know let me read that again is the Elijah who comes to preach to the Jews or there the real man who live on earth or will he be Spirit of Elijah in some other man now if I could answer that correctly I could tell you about Enoch see but I I can't do it see only thing I know is just the scripture says what it will be and uh now it might be that the um now I I'm kindly inclined now let me say it this way and I hope the tape the brother on the tapes will understand this I'm inclined to believe that it will be anointed man of their spirit because see he says does not on Elisha does not the spirit of Elijah rest on Elijah the spirit of Elijah and he done just like Elijah did see so I but I can't say that's true I I don't know see I'm honest with you I don't know brother Brenham would you please answer this one for me about baptism Matthew 28:19 teaches the father [Music] d [Music] n [Music] oh [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] oh

the message this morning let's open our Bibles to Sint John the 10th chapter and amen so good to be back in the house of the Lord this morning and and I was listening in on brother Israel preaching this morning and and uh it looked like they were having a good time down there and I just pray that he's a help to the folks and that's gathered together there and look like a nice crowd good turnout look like they had a nice service last evening and and so I'm just trusting that God is with them there and uh and and the good thing about the Lord is he can be there and he can be here too and so we're grateful that he's omnipresent he's omn Mission and uh he's here to provide all of our needs St John the 10th chapter and the 27th verse uh and then we'll read over in Romans the 8th chapter if I could get some uh volume on the speaker here please St John the 10th chapter my sheep hear my voice now now that's you son sa my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish that sounds like a promise to me Saints uh and neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and I and my father are one and over in Romans the eth chapter we'll read Romans 8 the 30 uh fifth verse we'll read a few verses here it's one of my favorite portions of scripture Romans 835 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded and I am to saints that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor nor powers nor things present nor the things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord so when the devil tells you that there ain't no real Believers you can tell him you're looking at one the title of the message today is who is a real believer you're looking at one let's just our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful today to be assembled in your house in your presence we're grateful to have a place to Worship You Lord we're thankful that we get to have this opportunity Lord how many people around the world today would love to have the opportunity that we're afforded today Lord to come together with Believers of like Precious Faith to sit in comfort and hear the word of the Lord to to sing and to praise you lord lord without fear of our life or discrimination Lord Jesus Lord we're so grateful that you've given that to us Lord we don't want to take it for granted and now Lord as we have read the word Lord as we've sang your Praises now Lord we just pray that you would come into our midst and break to us the bread of life we'll commit it all into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the church said amen God bless you may be seated and so good to be here with you this morning pray for us my family is is under attack and and I know that a lot of families have been I don't know I don't know who started this thing passing this junk around brother Chuck but whoever did it we're going to find you it's I tell you who did it it was the devil that did it and uh but my my how uh how it's been seems like running through the church and running through not just the church but everywhere but uh uh by the grace of God we're g to make it Saints and uh and uh and he's with us even in us always until the end so this little message this morning the devil really fought me about and I questioned is that something that even needs to be talked about is it something that we even need to to look at it seems rather simple it's probably one of the most simple messages that I've ever preached and um you know it just seems like sometimes uh want to bring something maybe maybe new or something that people haven't heard before uh but Saints I I don't I don't I don't see that in the message this is uh we we have the message and if there's anything that can be done is to remind us of the things that's already been said and but I have never seen a time where the enemy is trying to come against people and I've been privileged to travel all over the place and and many churches many different people talk to different Believers and then here also in our own church and then uh around just in the area here and I've never seen a time where the enemy is attacking people around the basis of their very salvation like he is today and it seems like uh so many people I've run across people here recently over the last few months that have been in the message years decades some of them and they're not exactly sure if they're even saved or not uh and and so you know don't ever think you're above that Saints don't don't ever think that that you're above the the devil getting in and plaguing your mind and making you doubt whether you even have the Holy Ghost whether you're even saved or not that's right and uh I I see it where the devil the enemy is coming in to try to make people think that they're just not good enough they're just not spiritual enough or they're not righteous enough or they're not holy enough and I'll tell you that's the truth we're not but he is and it seems like anxiety and depression and stress is at an alltime high that everybody brother Brown talked about it being under pressure where it seemed like everybody is under such a strain and and moving so fast and we get done with one thing and we go right straight into another thing and another thing and to another thing and and where are we going anyways what are we doing anyways and so you know we we run down the road brother Bram said 90 miles an hour to uh you know what we get get home and look at our phone or something and it's a time where we feel saints that we should make our calling and our election Shore that we should settle in our hearts that we know what we know that we believe what we believe that God has called us to this thing that God has called us to a message that we believe that message and that this message will introduce us to Jesus Christ and you know that's all us but what about the attack that the enemy is putting on our young people make no mistake that the enemy is after The Souls of our children and you can see a greater attack a greater emphasis on the young people than has ever been before by the enemy and he slips in so cunningly and so easily and sometimes as parents maybe were just ignorant to all the things going on with our young people and and I hate to say that but I I believe sometimes we have no idea the battles that they're fighting the challenges that they're up against the things that they're battling at school or the things that they're battling at home or the things that they're battling out in the world today it's it's an extraordinary pressure on the young people and they're more accessible to the devil than they've ever been and if you take a a look at at any any medium of communication that they have or any if they've got a phone they got they got they got direct access to every devil in hell I'll tell you that well what are you going to do Sayes you got to monitor it some as best you can but you can't be there all the time and if you monitor them you can't be around they're friends all the time oh come on somebody this morning so at some point in time we got to put them in the hands of the Lord and I'll tell you there's such an attack that people would even doubt whether they're saved whether they're whe they got the Holy Ghost they doubt whether they even belong to this message or not but brother brandham said and I I was I was I was worried about preaching this today but then as soon as we put the Sunday School tape on brother brand said it he said if there is one that makes it you be that one if there's one that's going to make it you be that one is that what the prophet said and so so no matter what the devil tries to tell you or what the enemy comes against you about you say if there's one that makes the Rapture I'm going to make it if you want to see somebody that's going in the Rapture look right here that's got to be your testimony Saints that's got to be what you believe that if anybody's going to make it it's going to be you now we want to take as many people as we can but it's just like when you're on the airplane they tell you when the oxygen mask drops down if you got kids with you you don't put the ma mask on the kids first you put yours on first then you pick which kid you like the best and put theirs on next that's not what they say but you you got to help yourself first before you can help others amen you got to help your family first before you can help somebody else's family you got to help your church first before you can help somebody else's church is that right Saints now brother Brown said the third seal he said I don't want to scare you and I I don't think it's going to it's that way but I just want to tell you what he said and you know it yourself as it was in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved by water eight Souls out of the world were saved by water well you say oh my there's no need of me trying come on somebody there's no need in me trying he there's no need in me trying he said that shows you hadn't got the kind of Faith you need he says oh my there's no need of me TR he says go he said uh if there's going to be one that'll be me amen CU I Believe come on somebody today see that's that's the way you got to believe it he said be me sure I want to live so close to him that I know he's going to make he's going to take me when he comes I believe it that's right so if if everybody else misses it I am going to be there by his grace cuz he promised me that and I know that I'll be there cuz he he can't lie he says and I know my soul and life Bears record and I try to live daily just like he was coming so I'm going to be that one that's the way you want to feel now see that's not arrogant Saints brother said you want to feel that way that if anybody makes it it's going to be you he said that's the way you want to feel if there's going to be eight I'll be one of that eight if there's going to be 500 I'm going to be one out of that 500 I don't know about the other fella but I want to be one of that 500 see that's the way you want to remember see and he says if you don't remember it like that then there's something wrong with your faith see you're you're not sure you're saved yet then he says you're just guessing at it don't do that see it's not a a thing where we want to guess whether we're all right or not or guess whether we're okay or not or guess whether we're going to make a wraps or not we want a faith to settle it and he gave three points there that I want to emphasize first thing he by his grace I'm going to be there by his grace I'm not counting on my grace I'm counting on his grace I'm not counting on my righteousness I'm counting on his righteousness s we got to get back to preaching a message of Grace brother BR refers to this message as the message of Grace this message is the message of Grace that was sent to you and I today it's called the message of Grace and we got to preach that not one of us is good enough but we're going to make it because of his grace come on somebody today I'm making it if you want to see somebody who has the grace of God you're looking at him now the last time I preached here I read that quote to you about Papa Cox y'all remember that and I I found another quote where brother br's talking about Papa Cox and he said on uh he's talking about how that Christ was was the smitten Rock when Moses smoked the Rock and brought forth water he talks Christ was the smitten Rock and broken sists and he said our judgment was upon him our judgment was upon Him Saints say we want to carry our judgment but our judgment was upon him when the devil tries to remind you of your judgment but your judgment was taken from you and placed on him amen and he said from that he might come the spirit of life that would give you and me eternal life that's a perfect parable of it there in this Wilderness he says they never had to pull dig pump anything just partake of his provided way see Saints it ain't a work that we can do we we can't work our way in there we ain't got to pull our way in there we ain't got to push our way in there we just accept the provided way yes they didn't have to dig it out of a pond they didn't have to pull it with a bucket they didn't have no window to get with get with get it with they just had to partake of it and that's all there is now you don't have to join nothing you don't have to get down to the Altar and work up something pumping it you don't have to say a word oh over and over until you get a confusion of language there's only one thing that you do is just partake of him freely God's provided way no pumping no pushing no nothing just take it freely nothing you have to do just partake of it that's it just believe it that's all I can say to it they never they never had to do anything for it they never had to dig for it they never had to get down and cry all night for it they just partook of it it was smitten and ready that's right and he says I'm looking at a man now he's talking about Papa Cox he says I'm looking at a man now sitting back there on the room here I remember telling him on an old barn stall One Day by a manger and he said no but I'm no good I said I know you're not oh my God he says I'm no good he said I know you're not and he said but I'm not either he said but I said you're looking at what you are quit looking at what you are and look at what he is he said he he said if I could just get rid of these cigarettes there we go and brother Bram he said I I would be a Christian I said don't get rid of them he said you're trying to get good enough and then come to him he never come to save good men he came to save bad man that knowed they were bad oh God he didn't come to save good men he come to save bad men that knew they were bad oh there might not be a lot I'm sure of but I am sure that I was a bad man amen he came to save he said listen you don't want to go to hell do you that's a good question didn't it he said no I said well you don't have to he died that you might not have to go and said what do I have to do I said nothing it's just that simple what do I have to do he said nothing it's just that simple he said but if I can ever I said there you go back to that cigarette again quit thinking about that cigarette just remember think about him what he did what he is not what you are you're no good and you never was and never will be oh that's that puts it in perspective doesn't it you're no good you never was and never will be he said but he was L but what he is he's the one and I said now the only thing only one thing you have to do if he took your place down there you just willingly accept what he did only thing you have to do is just accept it why he said that's simple I'll do that yes sir and I said here's a creek see and I brought him up here and baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ and some of his people are sitting here and I know they felt funny about at me for doing that but I know what I was doing he said I seen the man something that was genuine see Saints we we we may not be no good but we can be sincere we can be genuine and he said I seen something that was genuine I could see it there and I took him and baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus and when we did that it wasn't long after that till I went down to his son's house and I seen a vision we seen a vision of a tree being broke at a certain place and the man fell and almost broke his back he's talking about Papa Cox almost broke his back and he said they took him in the hospital and that night the Lord revealed to me that that was the end of the cigarettes so the next day he wanted some cigarettes and I said now this is what the prophet said he said and I said I'll buy him a carton and take to him he said you just watch and see his cigarettes days are done and he's never smoked one sense and never wanted one sense now here is an example of Christ taking a bad man that never was no good and never will be no good and saving that man and then cleaning that man's life up and that's the way it's got to come so the first thing brother Bram said is I know I'm GNA make it because of his grace the second thing he said cause he promised me that and I know that I'll be there because he can't lie so the first reason you can say well who's a real believer you're looking at it it's because of his grace the second reason is because he promised you'd make it and he can't lie didn't I read that in our word opening the scriptures he he's is not going to lose a one he he can't lose one neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come nor death height or breadth or depth anything can separate you from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Philippians 1:6 says being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ yes so he don't halfway save you he don't halfway get you there he ain't going to halfway get you into a Rapture but he's going to be with you even in you until the end the god that started to work in your life is the same God that will deliver you at the day of the Rapture or what kind of God are we serving second Timothy the first chapter he said I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day we know we'll make it because the word said you would we know we'll make it because of his grace will no one make it because he can't lie if you want to look at somebody that's going to make it you can look right here you can look right here if one makes it you be that one the third thing he said I love this he says and I know that my soul bears and life Bears record he said I know I'll make it because of Grace I know I'll make it because he said make it and he can't lie and I know I'll make it because my soul and life Bears record and I try to live daily just like he was coming and I'm going to be that one now see a lot of people try to accept it they want him to save them but they don't want him to be their lord they want salvation but but but they never let him rule over their life but brother BR said I know I'm going to make it because of his grace I know I'm going to make it because his word says and I know I'm going to make it because my life Bears record that he lives in me and he says and I try key word is try I try to live daily just like he was coming so let me ask you something today Saints are you doing your best to live a Christian Life I mean I'm not saying we can't do better all of us can do better all of us can get better all of us can do more all of us can be better Christians but if you're trying your best today to live a Christian Life what else can you do is your soul tendered to the word of God is your soul tender when you when you hear the word does the word correct the error in your life that's a good that's a good barometer of your spiritual condition see none of us are perfect but when we hear the word if it's if our soul is tender and the word can correct usall that's what the word's for and you don't get mad about it you want to be corrected everyone if you want to be right if you truly want to be right and you can receive the word and allow the word to correct the error in your life that's a good barometer It's Your Soul Bears record amen I'm not what I want to be and not what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be and I'm getting better every day well when you see me tomorrow you're going to see a better man than you seen today is that your testimony Saints oh I want to be better amen see we'll never stop learning I don't believe that we're going to keep learning we're going to keep growing I've been in the message you say I've been in the message 70 years you can still learn I've been in the message 50 years you can you can still learn I've been in the message 25 years you can still learn when I gave my heart to the Lord there were things that I did not know come on somebody I I wasn't born into this world into this world I spent the first 21 years of my life serving a devil and when I was born again I wasn't born sprinting running I had to learn to walk is that right am I stumbled around I didn't know what I wasn't for sure about a lot of things and I remember things that I didn't know and nobody beat me up about it nobody at the church called me down and told me how rotten I was for doing things and I would hear something on a tape and I would almost get mad at them I say are you kidding me y'all been letting me do that when brother Brown said this on tape but I was a baby you you can't whoop a baby when he's trying to learn to walk now if I was still doing it when I was a teenager I needed a whooping is that right but when somebody's new and they're learning and they're growing and they're being corrected and they're figuring their way around we don't we don't bash them or beat them up and I'm still learning I'm still hearing stuff every day I didn't know or I never paid attention to before I remember was listen to questions and answers and my my girls would ask me about coloring their hair this might tense up I don't know well I would just say well brother brand said color it whatever just don't cut it is that what he said just don't cut it leave it let it grow and I I was talking about questions and answers well then one day I was listening to the message Blasphemous names brother Chuck and in the message Blasphemous names they asked him and he talked about he talked about coloring your hair and he said this is a part that struck me and this was just here recently probably three four years ago when I heard this and he said he says color it he said but he said if you got if you got if you got like if your hair got gray or something and you wanted to color it the the color that it was he said it'd be fine but he said if it was red and you colored it black you did wrong Welly that tightens up doesn't it but that's in Blasphemous names if you want to look it up amen but I went for 20 years and never knew that quote come on somebody when I read it you know what I did I sent it to my family I said leave it alone if it's if it's black and you want to keep it black keep it black if it's red and you want to keep it red keep it red but he said if you do if you change the color that it was you did wrong oh that's what the word said okay but I I didn't know Saints I was ignorant up until that point now I remember I was listening here uh back when we was at camp and I heard a quote where brother Brown said this now I've been I've been in the message 27 years and I tell me how I'd never heard it but brother brandham said that you got the offices of the church and he said you don't Chuck I shared that with y'all we he said we don't we can't you can't pray for those you got you born that way if you're Apostle Prophet preacher teacher evangelist those things he said oh he said but then there's n spiritual gifts and he said those are the gifts that you're to pray for is that what it said Nathan where's Nathan at that's what it said those are the gifts that you're to pray for in 27 years I had never prayed for spiritual gifts I didn't know y'all don't believe that I'm G to read the quote tonight I'll read both those quotes tonight how about that my point is we're always growing we're always learning there's always more that we can get from the word amen so we can't judge ourselves because we're not perfect we may just not know yet amen but you say well in my heart I know I love the Lord Jesus well what more can you do Saints you have to just love the lord it's like brother brandham told sister Bruce on private interview if you hadn't listened to that it's it's it's about the best six minutes you can ever spend and he talks to Sister Bruce and she said I've never had an experience of being filled with the Holy Ghost now how many of you can relate to that I've never had an experience of being filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on and he said 'all right notice this he said ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped iniquity come in a world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being Sister Bruce said yes and he says that was your nature it changed once but what changed it and she said Christ he said there you are sister that's it we want an experience or a sensation and God might do that for us but if you want to know about the Holy Ghost watch your nature you had one kind of nature and then you got another nature and brother BR said what did that look how complicated we try to make everything look look how look how difficult we try to make everything I think it's so we got something to preach on but Jesus said they they they they bind heavy burdens Grievious to be born they bind heavy burdens Grievious to be born and they lay them on men's shoulders and that's what that's what that nickeloden Spirit that's alive and well in the land today tries to do it it tries to bind heavy burdens and lay them on your shoulders something that you got to do something that you got to that you got to attain to and and they asked Peter what must we do to be saved that's a good question and Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now that sounds like something I can do that sounds simple amen we got to get dumb enough just to believe what it said I'm amazed that as soon as God sets a people free they go as quickly as they can to try to get back in prison again I've been watching this in the message for years Saints it's it's not good enough to be a believer you you got to be a believer of this certain kind of believer a a believer of this certain kind of church or a believer of this certain kind of Doctrine or you got to be a believer of this certain click over here or or or you got to you got to it's teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men you know what you got to do to be a believer you got to believe well if you're a Believer you'll go to this church or if you're a Believer you'll go to this Doctrine here if you're a Believer you'll listen to this tape if you're a Believer you'll go to this certain Camp over here Saints you don't have to do any of that to be a believer you have to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen or you got to worship this certain kind of way you got to do it this way you got to do it that way are you are you are you too loud are you too quiet or you too whatever I used to watch all the the dos and don'ts try to make all the sisters wear potato sacks so they're modest or their dresses that they trip over so they're modest but then when I would look at pictures of sister mea I said now that that's a classy looking woman right there but she didn't want dressed in no potato sack oh my here we go any rule that's not in this message ain't a rule I'll tell you that any rule that somebody comes up with that you have to live by that's not in this message ain't a rule I had a girl at work I was witnessing to a little bit and she was struggling because she'd been raised in church and she'd seen some hypocrisy and she had a pastor and the pastor had fell out and then she moved and had another pastor and another group and that Pastor fell out and she was just like I just you know I've just I don't know I've just give up on that and I said well look you you don't quit going to the gym because there's fat people there is that right or wrong Saints I mean e eating eating right and and and exercising we know that works we know it works but don't everybody at the gym do that do they this gospel we know it works Jesus Christ we know saves Jesus we know heals we know he's the same yesterday today and forever we know the gospel Works don't everybody that go to church believe that but it don't mean it don't work so we can't just look at the hypocrite and say whether it's all Hypocrites I'll tell you this it's all bad news in the world today it's all negative in the world today when you turn the news on it's just a bunch of trash I I can't even listen to it anymore Saints it's so bad even Trump can't fix it sin is abounding the cup of the amorites is filling up and I'll tell you we get caught in it and we get caught in traps it amazes me at how many Believers get all tied up in politics Saints that's not our field you you want to know about politics the prophet said it was corrupt from Pillar To Post I I don't know who's going to be in office next but I know whoever it is it's going to be worse than the one before it's going to keep getting worse until the Lord calls us on amen there's nobody going to straighten it out amen it I I don't I don't know who's getting in next nor does it matter it's not my field of effort or expertise this is my field this is what I pay attention to amen amen and sometimes in this world we get caught in traps we come up short we may do things or say things or think things that's wrong sometimes we struggle sometimes we're just better Christians than we are at other times and sometimes we can even get discouraged a Christian can get discouraged sometimes we can and the devil says well if you really believed you wouldn't be discouraged Saints anybody can be discouraged but I came today to tell you to be encouraged look up your Redemption draws near be encouraged you're part of the Bride today being Pur he calls you son he calls you daughter being encouraged every day when you get up no matter how rotten the day is you might get up every day and be sick broke dumb stupid but if you're saved you got something to shout about be encouraged this is just a short span but we're talking about eternity today Saints be encouraged now oh I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them today Saints I'm so glad I don't know where I don't know what my future holds I know what I was I know where he brought me from oh God supernaturally I'm one of them brother Brown said second-handed Rob he said when I heard the pastor say this morning that many are becoming discouraged it sound like brother brandom sat down and listened to brother Neville preach anyway he said many are becoming discouraged he says what we need brother is to take courage what we need is to be encouraged that's right trials may come we never was promised to be immune from them but he'll give us Grace to go through them and if the Mountain's too high to go over too deep to go under too wide to go around he'll give us Grace to go through it that's right just don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ he's the only one that can take us through oh Oh Glory Saints you're God's people today he will not lose a one now I know that there's a lot of fear-mongering out there and I know that the enemy Whispers all of these things well what if this group is right or what if that group is right what what what if they are right and you're going to miss something that's fear saintes amen and that's what the devil's tactic well run over here run over here and then and then you'll be all right well well wait a minute what what what about them over there maybe they're right maybe this one's right that one's right Saints it's the word that's right huh I know that the devil's real good at telling everybody they'll never make it but I'm telling you what the word says and I'd rather take the word of God over Satan's reasoning who's opinion do you want to take do you want to take Satan's opinion about it or you want to take what God said about it we should be the happiest people in all the world no matter what the day holds no matter what the day holds say no matter how bad the fight is that when you get up you know you got to fight today and you know you got to battle today but you can still be encourage knowing you're going to make it knowing that if you can't go around it you can't go over you can't go under he'll give you Grace to go right through the middle of it who saved today you're looking at it who's a Believer today well you're looking at it oh God you say oh you just telling the people what the what they want to hear no I'm telling you what the word said I'm preaching the gospel the gospel is the good news the good news that Jesus saved the gospel hallah we give up on preaching the gospel Man mark 16 go into all the world preach the good news they that believe will be saved do you believe Saints these Sons shall follow them that believe it's amazing how we can get so far removed from this most basic Point most basic doctrine of the message you say well we all know this if everybody knows this then why do you got so much doubt surrounding it why is there so many people doubting whether they even got it or not doubting whether they're part of the Bride or not if everybody knows this then why is there so much [Music] fear why are so many just giving up why are so many just discouraged because we're preaching on everything in the world you got to do to be a believer you know what you may not understand the seals you may not understand the 70 weeks of Daniel anytime I think I know something I like to listen to Feast of the trumpets you may not understand all those things we want to understand those things we want God to reveal those things to us but that is not salvation you you're saved before you understand all those things but then God can add those things to you amen but we we don't doubt whether we're bride or not because we don't have all the Mysteries figured out now there's a quote where brother Brown s in questions and answers on Hebrews he was talking about this big Minister that come in town sound like it was a woman preacher and she was coming into Kentucky and he said there was a little old boy down there that couldn't hardly read right couldn't spell his own name and he said they wouldn't let him have the schoolhouse but they let this great big preacher come in and said they had a bunch of uh doctors of divinity and stuff and they and they said that great big preacher held two weeks of Revival and didn't get one single soul saved and then they said the father went back and said my boy's got a right I'm a taxpayer my boy's got a right to have this place let them let them preach and this boy that that started preaching couldn't read right had to have somebody else read the scripture for him he couldn't even read the scripture himself and he said he preached they only gave him two nights cuz he wasn't a big name and he preached two nights nights there and the very first night the 20 people came and gave their heart to the Lord including the big name preacher don't tell me it's how much you know Saints I hate the devil and his lies I hate all I'm sick of all this fear the Bible tells us to make our calling an election sure sometimes you got to get up in the morning look in that mirror and say I'm looking right straight at a child of God today who's a child of God you're looking at him if there's one you be that one who loves Jesus you can say well you looking at him I don't know a lot but I know I love Jesus today I know I met God's qualific ations I know what I was and I know what I am now I know I believe a message how can we move on with God if we're not even sure if we're a Believer or not now we got to have some preachers preaching and telling the people go ahead and March around seven times and get ready for them walls to fall down is that right Saints encourage the people the Lord's fighting look them people Saints they they didn't know what they doing the Lord said March around the walls seven times they didn't understand why they was doing it they just did it cuz the Lord said hallelujah amen they didn't understand all the mistes they didn't understand Moses's office they didn't understand all the things of God but they just did what God Said do Joshua said March around there seven times well here they went and when they did what God said the walls fell they didn't tear the walls down God tore those walls down and that's the same God that's fighting your battles today hallelujah amen you might not understand it all but just do what he said he said repent well I've repented he said be baptized well I get baptized then you shall receive the Holy Ghost I've done all he said come on somebody I done what he said God will do the rest David said the battle's not mine the battle is the Lord's huh they didn't understand the word that just did it you say well who's fighting the the battle for us it's him I like that little police officer when they said can you show us where the wels Revival is he say you looking at it oh God I want to be on fire like that Saints that's what I want that's what this church needs Hey where's the brides Revival at oh you're looking at it you won't say Revival you're looking at it you want to see somebody on fire you're looking at it he said we're written Epistles read of all men we come one with the word we as we hear as we receive the word we become that word amen we just believe that word and keep marching forward see some people don't want this kind of preaching because we want dos and don'ts we want we want don't do this and don't do that and don't do this and don't do that and and and you need to do this you need do that that way we can look at everybody and judge them well they're not a Believer because they didn't do this they didn't do that and they didn't do this and they didn't do that see people like to make up a bunch of works that you have to do to be a Christian but I'm here to tell you that works don't precede the Christian Works follow the Christian you don't work to become a Christian you become a Christian Christian and then the works Will Follow You amen amen now brother BR talked about we we heard this I think it was uh maybe it wasn't Wednesday but Enoch he talked about him building the pyramids I think maybe brother Israel read this on Wednesday he talked about Enoch building the pyramids in Blasphemous names and he said they they they don't know how they ever built it they don't understand it he said couldn't even a razor edge razor blade slice the slices where that mortar should be he said there's no mortar in it it's just perfected uh put together and he said so that's what it is when Christ and a church becomes one there's no mortar between them see there's there's no Doctrine between them there's no Works between them the there there's no there's no isms between them there's no special group in there when the Christ and the church when the Christ when the church and the word become one there's nothing in between that church and the word and he said there's no more to between there's nothing between it's just God and the person God Christ and the person so Saints we just look in the mirror of God's word and we want to see our reflection in it and when we see our reflection we want that reflection to look like Jesus you should look like your daddy come on somebody today and when when when you walk it should look like Jesus walking and when you talk it should sound like Jesus talking and when you speak it should be his words coming out of your mouth is that right now second-handed robe this is one we listen to and he talked about the Manel and uh he talked about how that Elijah's Manel let's see paragraph 39 he said and Elijah after he threw his robe on him and tried it on him in other words Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God on his shoulders he came down and laid it across Elijah Elisha the farmer to see if it would fit but it didn't fit Elijah's mantel didn't fit on Elisha and he said it taken about 10 years to get altered to fit that mantel he said now God usually puts us in the shop and shms us up now he didn't alter his robe to fit Elisha he ordered Elisha to fit that robe and that's what he does today he Alters us to fit the robe not the robe to fit us oh God Saints it's not it's not the doctrines and things that we can come up with that we alter to fit us if we like something we you know I heard a new doctrine the other day it's really good I I love a good false Doctrine Chuck the the new doctrine I heard is that brother brandham because they don't want to believe all the message they said brother brandham preached to three kinds of Believers he preached to the believer make believer and the unbeliever and so when you do that then what you can do is you can sayi take the quotes that I want to believe and I'll say well that's the ones to the believer and all them quotes over there that I don't want to believe I'll say well that's to the make believer God don't alter his robe to fit us he Alters us to fit his robe Saints and he said it's God's robe and he made it perfect and he said he's got to bring us into that realm to make the robe to make the robe fit us we can't be perfect ourselves we know we can't there's no way for us to be and yet he said for us to be so but what he did he made a propetuating [Applause] [Music] solemnly upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus God sent him to the Earth and it was in him that we rest see the Garment ain't made to fit us we're made to fit the wedding garment amen and and and and we find these these these things that we go through and the battles that we fight and the tests that we're all going through and the stuff we're dealing with in our family and and the struggles in the church and the struggles in the at our job and the struggles everywhere and the fights whether we win or lose the battle we find it it's all just chipping away parts of us to make that garment fits because we're coming into a church of power but Power apart from character is satanic and so we have to go through these things to build character so that God can put Power in the church is that right Saints amen so when the battle comes we got to be happy we say praise the Lord that robee's fitting better all the time praise God you know it's like if you get a stomach virus you've been throwing up by three days oh it ain't good to go through but you know your pants fit better shirts fit a little better wasn't fun to go through but you lost a little weight that's good say some of these battles and some of these trials I mean it ain't good to go through them it's hard on you when you go through it but it makes you better so you can say praise God I'm getting better all the time every trial that
