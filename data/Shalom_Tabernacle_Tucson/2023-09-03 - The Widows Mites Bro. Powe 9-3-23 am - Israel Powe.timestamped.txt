[1:40] be bless you may be seated brother
[1:44] brandham and the people of today who
[1:47] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:50] Spirit now the church says these people
[1:53] are
[1:54] Fanatics they're nothing but a bunch of
[1:56] worked up emotional panic stricken uh uh
[2:04] people but little do they
[2:07] know that the word of God teaches that
[2:11] it's a
[2:12] promise and to Noah no matter how much
[2:16] they said the old man was off at his
[2:19] mind that he was scientifically wrong
[2:23] and and midly he was wrong but the Noah
[2:27] it was the word of the
[2:30] law and Noah stayed with it and the wise
[2:34] and prudent uh stumbled over the
[2:38] Simplicity of it and lost their
[2:42] being what a a a rebut now it is to that
[2:47] generation many people say if I would
[2:49] have Liv back there no You' have took
[2:51] the same attitude because today in the
[2:55] very same thing being reproduced again
[2:58] today only in another form AR they
[3:01] stumble over today just like they did
[3:05] then no doubt in them days they had
[3:07] plenty of
[3:09] preachers but Noah was inspired of
[3:14] God and Noah could look out and see that
[3:18] what was fixing to happen and know that
[3:20] an adulterous and wicked generation like
[3:24] that that God would not let
[3:28] stand so what can we do today but see
[3:31] the same thing a modern Sodom and
[3:35] gomorah wicked adulterous people so
[3:41] Polished in
[3:42] scholarship that they stumble over the
[3:45] Simplicity of God's manifestation of his
[3:48] being and his word showing his word
[3:51] there's not a person in the world
[3:53] Rosella that and can say that that we
[3:57] don't see with us the very word of God
[4:01] made
[4:02] manifest the very promise of the last
[4:06] days the very evening lights that was to
[4:09] shine we are privileged people to see
[4:15] that and where the high polished world
[4:19] it's hid from them Jesus said to God the
[4:24] father he said it pleased you to hide it
[4:27] from him even so father
[4:30] you have hid it let them with their
[4:33] wisdom you see it was wisdom that
[4:35] started the ball rolling in the muck of
[4:39] sin at the
[4:40] beginning for Eve was seeking wisdom
[4:44] when she met Satan and Satan give it to
[4:47] her see and wisdom is contrary to the
[4:51] word we are not asked to have wisdom
[4:54] we're asked to have faith in what's
[4:56] already been said so see but but today
[5:00] the scholars polish it up in such a way
[5:03] and set it over and put their own
[5:04] interpretation to it always have they do
[5:07] the same thing today it's in the same
[5:10] measure now people uh but uh uh people
[5:15] then missed it just as they miss it and
[5:18] do it today same thing they do the same
[5:20] thing for they for the reason they
[5:24] missed it for they were too smart to
[5:28] believe it amen
[5:31] see now the
[5:35] message while so
[5:38] simple that the smart was too smart to
[5:43] believe the Simplicity of the
[5:49] message oh
[5:52] my God made it so simple and
[5:56] truth that the smart and intellectuals
[6:00] miss seeing it because it was so simple
[6:05] well that's what makes the greatness of
[6:07] God so great because being the greatest
[6:10] can make himself
[6:12] Simple Man today showing that they are
[6:15] not of God they're great and trying to
[6:18] get greater and express themselves
[6:20] greater as big Bishop doctor holy Pope
[6:23] everything making themselves something
[6:25] that they're really not and God being so
[6:27] great brings himself down simp
[6:30] [Music]
[6:32] Simplicity is greatness we can build a
[6:35] jet plane we can fire a rocket to the to
[6:39] put a a a missile in orbit and we can do
[6:43] all these things yet but we cannot build
[6:47] one blade of
[6:51] grass what about
[6:54] that but instead of trying to come back
[6:56] and see what makes that grass and
[6:59] accepting the very God that created the
[7:01] grass we're trying to build a missile
[7:04] that'll get there quicker than somebody
[7:05] else can build
[7:09] one we are so smart and intellectual in
[7:13] our churches so we can build a million
[7:16] doll building or1 million doll building
[7:20] but yet and trying to build one better
[7:23] than the methodists or the Baptist Bill
[7:25] one better than the
[7:26] Presbyterians and the Pentecostal God in
[7:29] the Rat Race but but the thing of it is
[7:32] is this we are yet we are so smart and
[7:36] so set on our ways until we fail to
[7:39] Humble oursel to realize the god that's
[7:42] in the little mission on the
[7:44] corner
[7:45] Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah well
[7:49] that's they stumble in Simplicity
[7:52] they've always done it now they they
[7:56] they were too smart to believe such a
[7:58] simple message it wasn't polished enough
[8:01] for their scientific researches that
[8:04] they had it wasn't it wasn't brilliant
[8:07] the message was enough for their
[8:10] educational program that they had in
[8:12] that day see they' studied to know that
[8:14] there was a God and they studied to know
[8:17] that he was great and they tried to
[8:19] build themselves up great with him when
[8:21] the way up is always
[8:24] down now who knows whether the North
[8:27] Pole is the North or the South Pole is
[8:29] North the North Pole is the South the
[8:31] South Pole of the north which is up and
[8:33] which is down we're hanging in space we
[8:35] say the North Pole is up how do you
[8:38] know South Pole might be
[8:41] North see you don't know so let's
[8:44] remember and this word said then how
[8:46] would you say brother Brandon that Up Is
[8:49] Down on the basis of Jesus Christ's word
[8:52] he said he that humbles himself shall be
[8:54] exalted but he that exalts himself shall
[8:57] be abased be brought down so then uh
[9:00] actually uh Up Is Down Down is up as the
[9:05] old Saint said in Chicago that a man a
[9:08] certain Minister from a certain
[9:10] organization got up for some
[9:11] Pentecostals he had all these
[9:13] intellectual uh things together he got
[9:16] up there and used words that the
[9:17] Pentecostals know nothing about and he
[9:20] got up there and he seen it wasn't going
[9:22] over with the Pentecostal people and he
[9:24] went up with his chest stuck out and he
[9:26] was holy doctor or so and so you know
[9:28] from certain big school there in Chicago
[9:31] and he looked around there Pentecostal
[9:33] looking at one another they didn't even
[9:34] what he was talking about so educated so
[9:37] smart brilliant they didn't know it was
[9:40] something like a certain a senator or a
[9:43] man that just run recently for president
[9:45] and was defeated tuck Coots told me when
[9:47] I was preaching Mama Ford's funeral and
[9:50] was telling about the Resurrection The
[9:52] guarante of the Resurrection just as
[9:55] sure as the sunrises so shall I Rise
[9:58] just as sure the grass dies in the fall
[10:01] and the leaf falls from the tree comes
[10:02] back again when the earth corrects
[10:04] itself around the orbit it's got to rise
[10:07] again tuck said I appreciated that
[10:09] message Billy brother nille and I were
[10:11] sitting together in the car and I said
[10:15] tuck he said I appreciate your messages
[10:17] I said tuck I have no education I said
[10:20] he said that's a good part about it see
[10:23] and I he said he went to see well I
[10:25] guess the man forgive me I don't mean
[10:27] Atley Stevenson you know said he heard
[10:29] him 15 minutes Mr Stevenson is such a
[10:32] brilliant speaker supposed to be you
[10:34] know on tell tuck said I guess he's got
[10:37] a college education he said he sat there
[10:39] and went to sleep and said he went to
[10:42] sleep listening to him in 15 minutes but
[10:45] said with a college education I didn't
[10:46] understand but few very few words he
[10:48] said they were so highly polished he
[10:51] said you never seen me sleep in one of
[10:52] your services did you brother BR see
[10:56] it's the Simplicity of it just simple
[10:59] that's where God laid now they were they
[11:03] were too smart in that day to catch the
[11:07] meaning of God's simple way of doing
[11:10] things it wasn't polished for him it's
[11:12] got to be polished it's got to be highly
[11:15] Chrome or they miss it now but the great
[11:19] Jehovah was hid in his word and
[11:26] he made himself known to the people that
[11:29] believe in his word by saving them and
[11:32] bringing to pass a simple message the
[11:36] simple message of Noah God brought it to
[11:38] pass now notice that now then again in
[11:43] Moses day notice another time of
[11:47] Deliverance when God is just about to do
[11:51] something to deliver his people God
[11:53] sends a message to the people and it's
[11:56] so simple as we'll catch in the breaking
[11:58] into these seals that's my purpose of
[12:00] bringing this first that we find out
[12:03] that the breaking of those seals is so
[12:06] simple the the the smart missed a
[12:09] million
[12:11] miles Hallelujah I hope that God anoints
[12:14] me far see see it just goes over the top
[12:18] that's I thought this message this
[12:20] morning would be appropriate to lay a
[12:22] foundation on the Simplicity of God see
[12:26] how God hides himself in
[12:29] Simplicity just think they can break
[12:32] atoms and do everything else but when it
[12:34] comes to touch and life they can't even
[12:36] tell where it come
[12:37] from a simple blade of grass and God's
[12:40] hid in
[12:41] it they can fire rock it to the moon and
[12:45] and shoot a radar over there or whatever
[12:46] more and yet can't explain the life in a
[12:49] plade of
[12:51] grass that's right see it's because it
[12:54] can't be explained it's so simple they
[12:57] Overlook that now
[12:59] notice Moses in the day that God was
[13:02] going to deliver the children of Israel
[13:05] according to his word he what did he do
[13:08] he chose a simple family we have no
[13:11] record of them see just the son of Levi
[13:14] is all we know and so U we um and his
[13:18] wife just an ordinary uh probably mud
[13:23] Dober as the world would think out there
[13:26] making brick for the enemy he just an AR
[13:29] AR slave in Israel but God chose that
[13:33] family to bring forth the
[13:36] deliverer just an ordinary Jewish Family
[13:39] he never went and got royalty and
[13:42] celebrity or something or even got some
[13:45] priest he took a common ordinary
[13:50] family see Simplicity notice what he
[13:53] done then he brought forth a child a
[13:57] simple human being
[13:59] he never he could have he could have
[14:01] ordained the son if he wanted you to
[14:04] deliver him he could have ordained the
[14:06] wind to deliver him he could ordain an
[14:10] angel to deliver
[14:12] him oh Hallelujah God can do whatever he
[14:17] wants to
[14:18] do but how do you know that brother
[14:20] Brandon God won't leave his program
[14:23] that's the reason we know that this day
[14:25] it's got to be
[14:26] simple see now always works in
[14:30] Simplicity yeah but God in the beginning
[14:33] that could have made the son preach the
[14:35] gospel or the winds preach the gospel or
[14:38] an angel preach the gospel but he
[14:40] ordained man for that purpose and he
[14:43] never changes it he never ordained in he
[14:47] never ordained denominations he never
[14:49] ordained groups of man he ordained man
[14:52] to preach the gospel not Machinery
[14:55] Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being
[14:58] it was man and when he brought
[15:00] Deliverance to the people down there he
[15:02] sent a simple human being born of a
[15:06] simple family and a bunch of
[15:09] slaves oh my what a God he is unfolding
[15:14] himself in Simplicity now
[15:17] notice and he had him trained in worldly
[15:21] wisdom so that he could fail and show
[15:25] that it isn't wisdom that will ever be
[15:27] delivered by it's by fa that we are
[15:32] delivered he let him go in and get such
[15:35] an education until he could teach the
[15:38] Egyptians
[15:39] wisdom he was so
[15:41] smart God was with that simple family
[15:44] who could perhaps maybe not write their
[15:46] name and Moses was tuck into the highest
[15:49] of schooling with such a great education
[15:53] till he could teach the wi of the
[15:56] teachers he could teach the
[15:59] genius yes and God let him get that way
[16:03] so he could display himself in humility
[16:06] to show that wisdom has nothing to do
[16:08] with it and Moses miserably failed in
[16:11] his
[16:13] genius he let him get that way for his
[16:15] purpose so he had failed and he did fail
[16:19] and he fell so to show not by power not
[16:24] by might not by the wisdom of EG ofp
[16:29] not by the wisdom of our schools not by
[16:32] the power of our
[16:33] seminaries but not by the amounts of our
[16:37] organization not by the power of our
[16:40] scholarly teaching but by my spirit say
[16:45] God his wisdom was vanished and at its
[16:48] end when he met God in the burning bush
[16:51] there he took off his shoes and humbled
[16:54] himself to
[16:56] humility and forgot all about his
[17:00] wisdom God bringing Deliverance had to
[17:04] train him in wisdom to let him fall to
[17:06] show that you cannot lean upon the arm
[17:08] of your own understanding or anybody
[17:11] else's
[17:12] understanding let him fall to Show's
[17:15] hand can you see it God's purpose in
[17:19] doing so was to display himself in
[17:22] humility and he let Moses become the
[17:24] highest until he was he' be the next
[17:27] Pharaoh he was a Mighty General amen
[17:30] according to history he conquered Moses
[17:32] himself the countries around and then
[17:34] when he turned to the work of the Lord
[17:36] with all of his talent God let him take
[17:38] a headlong
[17:40] topple so that he could put him out on
[17:43] the desert and beat all that out of him
[17:45] and then appear to him in humility and
[17:47] send him down with a stick in his hand
[17:49] to deliver the
[17:52] people when he couldn't do it by a
[17:55] military training by an education by a
[17:58] scientific education and by a military
[18:01] force he could not do it and he give him
[18:04] an old Crooked Stick off the desert and
[18:07] he did it with
[18:08] it God in
[18:12] humility
[18:14] Simplicity God was in the
[18:16] stick and in Moses as long as Moses had
[18:19] the stick then God had it because God
[18:21] was in Moses sure
[18:24] notice not by power nor by by might but
[18:29] by my spirit but by the simple Faith
[18:33] Moses had an understanding that he was
[18:36] to be the deliverer from the teaching of
[18:39] his mother and he trained himself in
[18:41] military might to do so but it failed
[18:45] see he had the understanding he had the
[18:48] education but that didn't work so he had
[18:51] to forget it all and come to the simple
[18:54] thing of taking God at his word and then
[18:57] he delivered delivered the people that's
[19:00] God delivers by what faith in his word
[19:04] always has been we could take a look if
[19:06] we had time we got about 20 something
[19:08] minutes yet we had we could take a a
[19:11] look at Cain and Abel how that that Kain
[19:15] tried to please God by some
[19:19] beauty another way people think by by
[19:23] great fine dressed congregation by a
[19:27] priest with with uh ministers with robed
[19:30] in robed choirs and all the the put on
[19:33] that pleases God can you see where it
[19:35] come from Cain tried the same
[19:38] thing and he built him an altar no doubt
[19:42] that he made it pretty and the man was
[19:44] sincere he worshiped he thought as long
[19:47] as I'm sincere it doesn't make any
[19:48] difference it does make a difference you
[19:50] can be sincerely wrong notice he he
[19:54] built this Altar and more like put
[19:56] flowers and fixed it up and put
[19:58] beautiful fruits and thought surely a
[20:01] great holy clean beautiful God will
[20:05] accept that
[20:06] sacrifice but see he done it with his
[20:10] own wisdom he done it by his own
[20:14] thoughts and that's what it is today he
[20:18] he they do it by their own wisdom by
[20:20] their schooling by their education and
[20:24] ethics that they have learned but Able
[20:27] by
[20:29] Revelation by faith offered unto God a
[20:33] more excellent sacrifice nothing clean
[20:35] about it as far as it looked humanly
[20:38] speaking the little fell grabbing him by
[20:41] the neck and wrapping a Vine around him
[20:42] like that and pull him along to this
[20:44] altar there's nothing so beautiful about
[20:46] it laying him up on the Altar and
[20:48] hacking his little throat with a a sharp
[20:50] rock until his blood flying all over him
[20:53] blading dying it was a horrible sight
[20:55] see to see it it was simp
[20:58] in Simplicity he know that he was born
[21:02] of his mother and father's blood born in
[21:06] his mother's Blood by his father's blood
[21:09] and it was blood that caused the fall so
[21:12] it was blood that would take it back so
[21:15] he offered unto God a more excellent
[21:17] sacrifice because it revealed to him and
[21:20] some of the Brethren today who think
[21:21] they eat apples and pears and I seen the
[21:23] most radical thing of the day in the
[21:25] paper they said now they prove that it
[21:27] wasn't an apple there eve eat that I I
[21:29] think they claim it was an ocot
[21:32] so oh see where that Spirit comes
[21:57] from

[1:05:19] Bible I just have one place in or two
[1:05:21] places in the scripture I'd like to take
[1:05:23] and
[1:05:24] St Mark chap
[1:05:34] 11 so nice to see each of you in the
[1:05:36] house of the Lord this morning we had a
[1:05:38] wonderful time in the meetings there
[1:05:40] were brother Bob I think a few stayed
[1:05:43] back for the morning but I see a few
[1:05:46] that pressed their way out to be here so
[1:05:49] appreciate that good to see each of you
[1:05:52] mark chap 11
[1:06:01] very familiar portion of
[1:06:05] scripture in
[1:06:08] verse
[1:06:10] number
[1:06:13] 22 and Jesus answering saith unto them
[1:06:17] have faith in God for verily I say unto
[1:06:20] you that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:06:23] mountain be be thou removed and be thou
[1:06:26] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:06:28] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:06:31] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:06:34] he shall have whatsoever he saith
[1:06:38] therefore I say unto you what what
[1:06:41] things soever you desire When you pray
[1:06:45] believe that you receive them and you
[1:06:46] shall have them and when you stand
[1:06:49] praying forgive if you have ought
[1:06:52] against any that your faith also which
[1:06:55] is in heaven your father also which is
[1:06:58] in heaven May forgive you of your
[1:07:00] trespasses but if you do not forgive
[1:07:03] neither will your father which is in
[1:07:05] heaven forgive your trespasses brother
[1:07:08] Banner makes a statement with that
[1:07:10] scripture he says so faith is based on
[1:07:14] forgiveness I'd like to take one more
[1:07:16] scripture found in Mark chapter 12 just
[1:07:19] the next chapter over in
[1:07:22] verse number 41
[1:07:26] this is where we'll take our text uh
[1:07:29] this
[1:07:31] morning we'll title it the Widow's
[1:07:37] might and Jesus said over verse 41 and
[1:07:40] Jesus sat over against the treasury and
[1:07:44] beheld how the people cast money into
[1:07:47] the treasury and many that were Rich
[1:07:50] cast in much and there came a certain
[1:07:53] poor Widow and she threw in two mites
[1:07:58] which make a farthing and he called unto
[1:08:01] him his disciples and sath unto them
[1:08:04] verily I say unto you that this poor
[1:08:07] Widow hath cast more in than all they
[1:08:11] which have cast into the treasury for
[1:08:14] all they did cast in of their abundance
[1:08:18] but she of her want did cast in all that
[1:08:21] she had even all all her living amen
[1:08:27] let's bow our heads for word of prayer
[1:08:29] Lord Jesus we ask your blessings on this
[1:08:33] word this morning bless
[1:08:37] father as it comes forth that the things
[1:08:40] that would be said would be helpful to
[1:08:42] your people it would lift them up it
[1:08:45] would strengthen them so that when we
[1:08:47] leave from here from the youngest one to
[1:08:49] the oldest one they can say it was good
[1:08:52] to be in the house of the Lord Lord let
[1:08:54] each one receive that testimony we pray
[1:08:57] and ask in Jesus name amen a Widow's
[1:09:01] might God bless you you may be
[1:09:03] seated amen and these two portions of
[1:09:08] scripture of course very
[1:09:11] simple portions in the word of God but
[1:09:15] they go deeper as we were have been
[1:09:19] talking and speaking on the third pole
[1:09:22] and how brother brandham had this great
[1:09:24] vision expanded a 9-year period that he
[1:09:27] spoke of the third pool that Vision had
[1:09:30] three parts to it the first part was he
[1:09:33] saw with the Mexican children the second
[1:09:36] part he saw himself fishing and trying
[1:09:38] to thread the eyelid in the shoe with
[1:09:42] the wrong end it caused impersonations
[1:09:44] under the second pole and then the third
[1:09:46] pole it went deeper into this vision of
[1:09:50] a tent and a great secret that was there
[1:09:53] there and then it went further into a
[1:09:56] great blast that he had as a vision six
[1:10:00] and seven angels coming to him that was
[1:10:03] the purpose of him coming to Tucson
[1:10:05] Arizona and then he was out in the
[1:10:07] mountains praying the sword appears in
[1:10:09] his hand this is your third pull this is
[1:10:12] the King's sword the angel revealed to
[1:10:15] him that the sword in the hand was the
[1:10:18] word of God can we all say Amen so we
[1:10:21] know it's a very nice beautiful subject
[1:10:23] it's something that we shouldn't be
[1:10:25] afraid of we should thank the Lord for
[1:10:27] it actually and there's a lot to it and
[1:10:30] I understand that people can take it you
[1:10:33] know it's like you know when Satan wants
[1:10:36] to hide what God has for you but then
[1:10:40] God hides things
[1:10:41] too and he reveals them in his time and
[1:10:45] so sometimes we want to know things that
[1:10:47] we shouldn't know and then there's
[1:10:48] things that we need to know that Satan
[1:10:50] doesn't want us to know so it can get
[1:10:52] complicated and the the great Mysteries
[1:10:54] they have to be revealed and so when
[1:10:56] somebody's hiding something and they
[1:10:59] tell you a story you ask them a question
[1:11:02] and they tell you a part of the story
[1:11:05] they're hiding they might give you a lot
[1:11:08] of evidence around you like the
[1:11:10] mountaintops of what took place but they
[1:11:12] don't go down into the valley and open
[1:11:13] up what really took place and so that's
[1:11:17] the way it is with the word of God many
[1:11:19] times you'll see Life High mountaintops
[1:11:22] of EV of what the third pull is but then
[1:11:25] there's some deeper areas that we simply
[1:11:28] don't know and we don't want to be
[1:11:30] discouraged at The Valleys that we don't
[1:11:32] know let's be encouraged on the
[1:11:34] mountaintops that we do know amen hope
[1:11:37] that makes sense in a little way and I
[1:11:40] trust that these things will bless you
[1:11:42] one of the as it pertains to us one of
[1:11:44] the Little Blessings of this great third
[1:11:48] poll is how does it pertain to us how
[1:11:52] does it relate to us like I always tease
[1:11:55] kind of you know a family album or
[1:11:57] family photos they're not really
[1:11:59] interesting if you don't see yourself in
[1:12:01] those family pictures you know
[1:12:03] everybody's got a picture or something
[1:12:05] or whatever when you want to see
[1:12:07] yourself in there and so that's what the
[1:12:09] Bible and that's what any you know truth
[1:12:12] how does that relate to me I mean I come
[1:12:14] and I see all the great magnificent
[1:12:17] happenings in the Old Testament and the
[1:12:19] New Testament but there's nothing left
[1:12:21] for me now I mean what does that how
[1:12:23] does that pertain to us and so this this
[1:12:27] part of and I'll be very clear there I
[1:12:30] mean I'm leaving out a whole bunch a
[1:12:33] whole lot as it pertains to the third
[1:12:35] pool but the part that I want to talk
[1:12:37] about is this little Widow and her name
[1:12:41] is Sister Hattie
[1:12:42] rright we all well familiar with her
[1:12:45] aren't we most of us are what do we know
[1:12:48] her
[1:12:50] by we know her because she said
[1:12:54] that's nothing but the
[1:12:55] truth very simple statement it was
[1:12:59] unconscience when she said it I mean she
[1:13:02] was conscious of what she was saying but
[1:13:04] she wasn't conscious of the
[1:13:07] repercussions and the power that was
[1:13:09] behind it brother Brandon brings her
[1:13:12] story in after reading this scripture in
[1:13:15] Mark 11 he also brings in uh brother uh
[1:13:20] Banks as he said um the right thing he
[1:13:24] was in the boat he said let's go tell
[1:13:27] that old sister that we got saved and
[1:13:30] the Holy Spirit liked those words it was
[1:13:33] just something that set it off and then
[1:13:36] brother bam he describes it as a super
[1:13:39] anointing in one place heus it that
[1:13:43] powerful anointing that came down upon
[1:13:46] him into the boat and he spoke to the
[1:13:48] little fish I give you your your life
[1:13:51] back so this is all in this message my
[1:13:55] new
[1:13:56] ministry then I don't think I brought
[1:13:58] the all my God help me but then I read
[1:14:02] it for you last week in my new ministry
[1:14:04] at the end there brother random says
[1:14:06] maybe your prayer might be the right
[1:14:10] prayer to say something to get that
[1:14:12] anointing to come down again so we know
[1:14:15] there's an unconscious part to this
[1:14:19] great anointing and but before I get
[1:14:22] into that that and I apologize my sister
[1:14:25] in the back deer I didn't give you these
[1:14:27] quotes but there's like three quotes I
[1:14:29] want to read on uh what brother bam
[1:14:31] talks about the law of contrast how
[1:14:34] there's a contrast to the good and to to
[1:14:38] bad to light Into Darkness that God
[1:14:42] actually designs our life that way and
[1:14:45] we're taking this message the life story
[1:14:49] 1953 paragraph number two brother
[1:14:51] brandom says this here we know you know
[1:14:54] we don't enjoy the UPS unless we have
[1:14:57] the Downs is that right did you
[1:15:01] realize we wouldn't have any mountains
[1:15:05] if we didn't have any valleys you
[1:15:08] wouldn't appreciate the sunshine if
[1:15:10] there wasn't any night is that right and
[1:15:13] a person sometimes very very good health
[1:15:17] maybe they don't know how to appreciate
[1:15:21] unless they had a real sick spell
[1:15:25] sometime and almost died then they would
[1:15:29] they can appreciate your good health so
[1:15:33] you have to it's uh what is called it's
[1:15:37] the law of
[1:15:38] contrast I believe brother bam continues
[1:15:42] on in the message the ark and he says
[1:15:44] this
[1:15:44] here paragraph
[1:15:48] 151 don't be scared God is driving the
[1:15:51] winds God is ding driving the ark he has
[1:15:54] all things provided why Noah wouldn't
[1:15:57] have had any victories there wouldn't
[1:16:00] have been storms and trials if we're
[1:16:03] just put through a little safe tunnel to
[1:16:06] run through there's no joy the storms of
[1:16:10] life what makes us have the joy we would
[1:16:13] never know what daylight was unless we
[1:16:16] had some dark we never know what the
[1:16:18] hilltop was L we had a mountain we never
[1:16:22] know what good health was unless you had
[1:16:26] some sickness youd never know how to
[1:16:28] enjoy salvation unless you was once a
[1:16:32] sinner God has made all things the law
[1:16:36] of
[1:16:37] contrast he loves
[1:16:39] you Amen in the message um a blessing
[1:16:44] Prophet brother banam says this here if
[1:16:48] you just put in law of contrast this
[1:16:50] you'll find it pretty quick it's in the
[1:16:52] blessing Prophet paragraph number seven
[1:16:56] the law of contrast he says this here
[1:16:58] paragraph number seven of a blessing
[1:17:01] Prophet you love the Lord this morning
[1:17:03] here's what the prophet says and now
[1:17:05] tonight we find Israel in a backsliding
[1:17:08] condition Israel had its ups and downs
[1:17:12] it was a very type of the church
[1:17:14] today sometimes they were on the
[1:17:16] housetops the next time they were down
[1:17:19] in the valley that's what takes to make
[1:17:22] a APR appreciate the good thing there's
[1:17:26] what they call the law of contrast the
[1:17:29] black man of Africa never knowed that he
[1:17:31] was black his skin until he seen David
[1:17:36] Livingston and he said then he realized
[1:17:38] his skin was black because Livingston's
[1:17:41] was white it's a
[1:17:43] contrast you would never know how to
[1:17:46] appreciate a day if you didn't have a
[1:17:48] night you would never know how to
[1:17:51] appreciate the sunshine if you didn't
[1:17:53] have a cloudy day you would never know
[1:17:55] how to appreciate righteousness unless
[1:17:58] you had some
[1:18:00] unrighteousness you would never know how
[1:18:02] to appreciate good health unless you had
[1:18:05] some foul Health some bad Health it's
[1:18:09] only those and that's the reason I think
[1:18:12] that we'll appreciate heaven so
[1:18:15] much because we've liveed on earth once
[1:18:19] and I think the law of contrast the
[1:18:21] reason that we appreciate the holy
[1:18:24] spirit so much tonight is because we
[1:18:27] live so long in a church that told us
[1:18:30] that there was no such a thing the
[1:18:32] reason we appreciate it tonight because
[1:18:35] we've had the other side and that's the
[1:18:38] way God has intended it to be because
[1:18:42] his people has had their ups and downs
[1:18:45] you never know how to appreciate a
[1:18:47] Mountaintop unless you've been in the
[1:18:49] valley and so you never know how to
[1:18:52] appreciate apprciate good water unless
[1:18:54] you drink some bad sometimes and then
[1:18:58] all the way through it's a law of
[1:19:02] contrast how many can say Amen to that
[1:19:05] what is your contrast today God operates
[1:19:09] in the ups and the Downs he's still God
[1:19:13] the God on the Mountaintop is the god in
[1:19:15] the valley the god when you got money is
[1:19:18] the same God when you
[1:19:20] broke the god when you got that smile on
[1:19:24] your face and friends all around you and
[1:19:26] you're feeling encouraged and you feel
[1:19:29] saved is the same God that's with you
[1:19:32] when you don't feel saved and you're
[1:19:35] discouraged and all hell look like it's
[1:19:38] coming against you he's still the same
[1:19:41] God God intends it this way this is what
[1:19:45] makes us different than the
[1:19:47] angels on the other side we will have a
[1:19:50] song that the Angels can't sing Our Song
[1:19:54] will be the song of redemption I once
[1:19:57] was lost but now I'm found I once was
[1:20:02] sick but now I'm Healed I know what it
[1:20:04] was to know what stress was and problems
[1:20:08] and Troublesome times were but now
[1:20:11] that's all over and that's why we'll
[1:20:13] enjoy Heaven even more we appreciate the
[1:20:17] good because there is something bad that
[1:20:20] we don't appreciate you know was I was
[1:20:23] at the house there I was uh I noticed
[1:20:27] this pack rat that got on the side of
[1:20:30] our house there and um and I you know it
[1:20:34] was only one and I could see that I
[1:20:36] would see and when it started to rain I
[1:20:39] started to look out and I noticed it
[1:20:41] would pop his head out I think it was a
[1:20:43] female rat and you know when you see a
[1:20:45] rat it's like oh kill it I mean you see
[1:20:48] a cardinal it's like oh a cardinal or
[1:20:51] you know you see another little
[1:20:53] animal it's you appreciate it when you
[1:20:55] see a rat I mean it's like we just
[1:20:58] detest it why is that I mean we see a
[1:21:01] squirrel we don't think that way but a
[1:21:03] rat it's like ooh get him kill
[1:21:06] him and so I was out to kill this rat
[1:21:11] and but as I as I the daily I would
[1:21:15] notice that it was moving more stuff
[1:21:18] into this hole so it started to Peak my
[1:21:21] interest so each night I noticed it had
[1:21:24] more stuff packed up underneath one of
[1:21:26] my ladders I mean and then when it
[1:21:29] started to rain this one rat started
[1:21:32] moving more stuff each night I would go
[1:21:34] out at night and I flash my light cuz
[1:21:35] you know snakes are out and I flash my
[1:21:37] light and I look and it would pop his
[1:21:39] head out I said oh there you go I see
[1:21:41] you and then I go back and then the next
[1:21:43] day a glove be moved over there it even
[1:21:46] moved the rat trap over
[1:21:48] there yeah it was a disarmed rat trap
[1:21:51] I'm no no joke this rat moved the rat
[1:21:54] trap in front of his little hole there
[1:21:56] and was building this little Nest so I
[1:21:58] started to build a little I started to
[1:22:00] appreciate this
[1:22:01] rat I mean he had it like character he
[1:22:04] was working harder
[1:22:06] than some people in the neighborhood and
[1:22:09] I won't even go any further than that he
[1:22:12] was working every night I saw it's work
[1:22:15] it's handiwork and I thought man and it
[1:22:18] was kind of a clean looking rat I didn't
[1:22:20] see any others it wasn't in my house
[1:22:22] house it really wasn't messing with my
[1:22:24] stuff so about two weeks I let this
[1:22:26] thing build itself up and it had this
[1:22:28] little hole there and then finally we
[1:22:31] went to go clean it up with some guys
[1:22:34] one of those guys was here the other
[1:22:35] Sunday and we prayed for him Marcos and
[1:22:38] then the rat ran out and we killed
[1:22:42] it yeah and I actually felt bad for
[1:22:46] killing this rat I never felt bad about
[1:22:50] killing a rat before but this this one I
[1:22:53] kind of felt bad for because it had it
[1:22:56] was working it was just living it was
[1:22:58] just being what it was now the rat story
[1:23:02] is not in my notes today but I just just
[1:23:05] thinking of that the the character and
[1:23:08] the you know how you can appreciate
[1:23:11] something that has some kind of
[1:23:13] value and who decides that a rat is less
[1:23:18] valuable than a
[1:23:20] squirrel you know the history of it is
[1:23:24] we you know they're they're they're
[1:23:25] they're terrible they're horrible
[1:23:26] they're they're disgusting we get that
[1:23:28] we understand that but I can say not all
[1:23:31] rats are the
[1:23:36] same now Let the church say
[1:23:39] Amen you all excuse
[1:23:42] me but I am at my home church so
[1:23:46] um this this this widow's might that we
[1:23:51] read here in the scripture it's so many
[1:23:54] lessons in here and as we as we take
[1:23:58] sister Hatty Wright's
[1:24:00] testimony we'd have to say if we're
[1:24:03] believing children we'd have to say that
[1:24:06] God knew sister had he right before the
[1:24:10] foundation of the world can we say that
[1:24:13] when he wrote the Book of Genesis he
[1:24:16] knew who she
[1:24:18] was and he knew that this great ministry
[1:24:22] would culminate in her becoming a famous
[1:24:27] person amongst th those of us who
[1:24:30] believe to the unbeliever maybe right in
[1:24:32] her name own neighborhood maybe some in
[1:24:34] her distant relatives they might not
[1:24:37] know how famous she is but any
[1:24:40] believer that follows this Pillar of
[1:24:43] Fire here knows who sister hadti right
[1:24:46] is it's very interesting that not that
[1:24:50] God chose her but look look who he
[1:24:54] bypassed and he did it on
[1:24:58] purpose he he
[1:25:01] chooses of all people he chooses a
[1:25:07] widow and this little
[1:25:10] Widow had her own troubles and her own
[1:25:13] struggles now if you as I was going
[1:25:16] through this message and I was searching
[1:25:18] in the scripture a little bit you'll see
[1:25:20] how God has always had a sensitive spot
[1:25:24] for the
[1:25:25] widdow and Deuteronomy 24:20 and 22 says
[1:25:30] when thou beatest thine Olive Tree thou
[1:25:33] shal not go over the bows again it shall
[1:25:36] be for the stranger for the fatherless
[1:25:39] and for the Widow when thou gather The
[1:25:42] Grapes of thy Vineyard thou shallal not
[1:25:44] glean it afterwards it shall be for the
[1:25:46] stranger the fatherless and for the
[1:25:51] Widow and
[1:25:52] thou shall
[1:25:54] remember that thou was a bond man in the
[1:25:58] land of Egypt therefore I command thee
[1:26:01] to do this so God is instructing Israel
[1:26:04] in their laws that when I bring you out
[1:26:06] of Egypt and I start to bless you and I
[1:26:09] bless your crops in your fields and I
[1:26:12] start feeding you when you go to gather
[1:26:15] from this abundance of fruit if some of
[1:26:19] it falls on the ground leave it there
[1:26:24] because somebody's coming up behind you
[1:26:27] that has less than you remember
[1:26:32] that you were a slave in Egypt remember
[1:26:35] that you come from a long way I brought
[1:26:39] you from Al remember that don't take it
[1:26:43] all leave some for the stranger leave
[1:26:46] some for the orphan leave some for the
[1:26:50] Widow it was was on the strength of this
[1:26:53] law that Ruth was able to come back as a
[1:26:56] stranger to Israel with Naomi and gather
[1:27:01] something to eat she lost everything
[1:27:03] Ruth was a was a widow can I get a
[1:27:06] witness Exodus 2222 says you shall not
[1:27:10] afflict any widow or fatherless
[1:27:14] child Luke 4
[1:27:17] 2526 says I tell you a truth many widows
[1:27:20] were in Israel in the day of Elias
[1:27:22] When Heaven Was Shut Up 3 years and 6
[1:27:25] months when a Great Famine was
[1:27:27] throughout all the land but unto none of
[1:27:29] them was Elias sent save unto serea a
[1:27:33] city of sidon unto a woman that was a
[1:27:38] widow Acts chapter 6 is where we see the
[1:27:42] deacons being
[1:27:44] Incorporated and why did the we we feel
[1:27:47] the need to incorporate the office of a
[1:27:50] deacon they're not a part of the fire
[1:27:52] fold Ministry it wasn't something that
[1:27:54] God had placed into the church as we see
[1:27:58] as in Ephesians 4 Ministry and the other
[1:28:01] Ministries in 1 Corinthians 12 and the
[1:28:03] gifts of the Spirit but the office of
[1:28:05] the deacon was developed because of a
[1:28:09] need in in Acts chap 6 verse1 it says in
[1:28:13] those days when the number of the
[1:28:14] disciples were multiplied there arose a
[1:28:17] murmuring of the grecians against the
[1:28:19] Hebrews because they're widows
[1:28:22] were neglected in the daily
[1:28:26] ministration so was the need of the
[1:28:29] widows and the difference between the
[1:28:32] two who got more who got less dis
[1:28:34] develop let us choose men to handle this
[1:28:38] while we stay with preaching the word
[1:28:41] James 1:27 tells us that pure pure
[1:28:45] religion and undefiled before God and
[1:28:48] the father is this to visit the
[1:28:52] fatherless and widows in their
[1:28:56] Affliction and to keep himself unspotted
[1:28:59] from the world widows
[1:29:02] widowers however you want to classify
[1:29:05] that God had a special place for them
[1:29:09] you know I've always wondered in 1
[1:29:11] Timothy Chapter 5 that the Paul is
[1:29:15] telling
[1:29:16] Timothy that it's concerning widows he
[1:29:20] said don't take in any Young widows
[1:29:23] anybody under 60 don't take them in but
[1:29:27] he admonished them that if they were
[1:29:29] widows indeed make sure that they truly
[1:29:33] are widows because if they're not a true
[1:29:36] Widow they're just single it's it's
[1:29:39] what's a widow a widow is a woman that
[1:29:41] was married and her husband is not
[1:29:44] anymore he's gone and quite frankly all
[1:29:48] of us that are married here today will
[1:29:50] probably uh hold that office if the Lord
[1:29:53] continues unless the Lord takes you and
[1:29:55] your spouse together it's a reality you
[1:29:57] will be a widow or a widower you don't
[1:30:00] think of it it's not a jacket you could
[1:30:02] just wear let me just be a widow today
[1:30:04] no you become a widow you become a
[1:30:07] widower it's a
[1:30:09] classification and God uses this
[1:30:11] classification on purpose they're lonely
[1:30:15] people they have their struggles they
[1:30:18] had a husband they had a wife and then
[1:30:21] there's not there no more there's a
[1:30:23] loneliness there how many know that I'm
[1:30:26] saying the truth amen all right now now
[1:30:29] if if you can't feel for a widow or a
[1:30:32] widower just keep
[1:30:39] living because the Bible tells us
[1:30:43] to and I I was sharing this with the
[1:30:45] church in in in place there at Landmark
[1:30:49] the day I was talking with this Barber
[1:30:52] in the barber shop it was an older
[1:30:53] gentleman in his late 80s I believe he
[1:30:55] told me he was married three or four
[1:30:57] times I think he was on his fourth wife
[1:30:59] he told me but all of his wives had died
[1:31:02] before him one live for a couple of
[1:31:05] years died died on I thought wow I asked
[1:31:09] him what was that like he said he said
[1:31:11] it's the most uh you know uh helpless
[1:31:15] feeling you can think he said it's like
[1:31:16] someone closes the door in your face and
[1:31:20] you can't go back and say hey I got one
[1:31:22] last thing I need to tell you or one
[1:31:25] last conversation it's over death closes
[1:31:28] the door and you know you're married
[1:31:31] there's a union there and then when that
[1:31:33] Union is broken it and one of them is
[1:31:38] gone it's it's a it's a tight and tough
[1:31:41] can be a tough position amen but you
[1:31:44] know the scriptures are very clear on on
[1:31:47] how to treat a widow but in in 1 Timothy
[1:31:50] chapter 5 tells that if she's a true
[1:31:53] Widow then you can take them in and
[1:31:55] watch them because if she's not a true
[1:31:57] widow she doesn't have this headship in
[1:32:00] her life she'll become a
[1:32:03] Tattler
[1:32:04] gossiper and get into things that she
[1:32:07] should not get into and can be uh uh you
[1:32:12] know negative towards the flock and so
[1:32:14] Paul is is instructing the church on how
[1:32:18] to deal with that so that's a little
[1:32:20] background on the wiow all right now
[1:32:23] Sister Hatty Wright was this she was a
[1:32:27] widow Not only was she a widow or a
[1:32:30] widow she was a mother she had two
[1:32:33] children that reached in the age of her
[1:32:37] of teenage so this is kind of the
[1:32:40] background these are the some of the
[1:32:42] Shadows that we want to bring to you
[1:32:45] this morning on her life brother random
[1:32:47] opens up her life to us in the message
[1:32:51] my new ministry
[1:32:54] 1959 paragraph 167 speaking of sister
[1:32:57] Hattie he says this here sister had
[1:33:01] moer she just lost her husband I married
[1:33:06] a couple some years ago they got two
[1:33:09] fine children and brother watt was
[1:33:12] killed his own boy found him under his
[1:33:15] tractor mashed to death and the little
[1:33:19] boy had a break and some something
[1:33:22] happened to him brother wood and I went
[1:33:25] down there one night stayed into the
[1:33:28] night where his mother and Uncle were
[1:33:30] staying with him and the Lord let him be
[1:33:33] well and he's sitting present this
[1:33:35] morning his mother was interested in him
[1:33:39] that teenage just be to get out with the
[1:33:43] world 15 years old or something his
[1:33:46] little brother coming on 12 13 years old
[1:33:50] that's an inter that's a beautiful
[1:33:52] detail wouldn't you saying so this young
[1:33:54] man a 15-year-old I wouldn't know what
[1:33:57] this would feel like to go out and see
[1:33:59] my father smashed under a tractor I'm
[1:34:03] the one who finds this at 15 years old
[1:34:07] there's a trauma there there's a break
[1:34:09] there now this man is taken from the
[1:34:12] family she becomes an instant widdow not
[1:34:16] because she asked not because you know
[1:34:18] she made a wrong decision it was an
[1:34:20] accident
[1:34:22] it happened as all accidents happen and
[1:34:26] now her whole life changes
[1:34:29] now it's a different
[1:34:32] classification a wife to a widow it's a
[1:34:35] different it's a different set of
[1:34:37] circumstances you got two boys that it
[1:34:41] takes men to raise
[1:34:44] men
[1:34:47] correctly but she has to take this role
[1:34:50] now you go further and one of the other
[1:34:52] messages it was this way for 2 years
[1:34:56] brother mam says it created a break in
[1:34:59] the
[1:35:00] boy now this boy breaks is probably
[1:35:03] going to affect his younger brother too
[1:35:06] but there it created a break in this boy
[1:35:08] and here his mother trying to keep them
[1:35:12] together they're Christians and we all
[1:35:15] understand let me go a little bit
[1:35:17] further all
[1:35:19] right brother random continues and says
[1:35:22] this
[1:35:23] here skip down sister to um the next
[1:35:29] message and speak to this mountain just
[1:35:32] as I'm on that point then we'll go back
[1:35:34] speak to this mountain 1959 paragraph
[1:35:39] 54 this is Brother brand I'm giving the
[1:35:41] background of who sister hadie
[1:35:45] is a little quiet this morning but it
[1:35:48] should be sobering thoughts right amen
[1:35:52] are you with me or are you all right
[1:35:55] okay paragraph 54 he says this here but
[1:35:58] that little Afflicted girl setting there
[1:36:01] I never could understand it why he
[1:36:04] couldn't give me a vision for that girl
[1:36:09] Mr wood and I were eating dinner there
[1:36:11] and I went down he makes the communion
[1:36:14] wine for the tables at the church I went
[1:36:16] down to pick it up and this little girl
[1:36:19] said to me she said brother brandom
[1:36:21] would you get me a rabbit before you go
[1:36:23] back I said sure Edith brother wood and
[1:36:27] I will go out and get your rabbit so
[1:36:30] here is Sister Edith is Sister Hattie's
[1:36:34] sister and sister Edith was born with
[1:36:37] this infantile paralysis she was in this
[1:36:40] condition of her entire life in other
[1:36:43] messages brother bam talks about how she
[1:36:45] would just be in agony and pain and she
[1:36:48] was just Disturbed and then finally one
[1:36:51] day they went down to pray for her and
[1:36:54] it stopped her nerves from being so bad
[1:36:56] but God never healed her and all of the
[1:37:00] great fine miracles in brother B's life
[1:37:02] God never gave him a vision for Edith he
[1:37:05] never understood that and this is what
[1:37:07] he's talking about he says for Edith I
[1:37:09] mean they love him they they gave a they
[1:37:12] gave brother brandom a room in in in
[1:37:14] that he can go to when he went to their
[1:37:16] home there and why he wouldn't heal her
[1:37:21] you know he prayed and asked God for a
[1:37:22] vision so this is what he's talking
[1:37:23] about so the the the the um um um the
[1:37:29] right home it was Mother right and
[1:37:31] brother right they had these two
[1:37:33] daughters Edith and sister Hattie Hattie
[1:37:37] was married to this gentleman and had
[1:37:39] two children and in that home they did
[1:37:41] their farming and so forth and so
[1:37:43] brother Ram is talking about how they
[1:37:44] made the communion wine he was going
[1:37:46] there to pick up that communion wine
[1:37:48] there were friends of his and just going
[1:37:51] to go see them and sister Edith wanted
[1:37:54] brother brandham to hunt and grab a
[1:37:57] rabbit for them and so that's that's
[1:37:59] kind of the background amen Mrs Wright
[1:38:02] had dinner ready for us her now her
[1:38:04] daughter is a widow woman they're poor
[1:38:08] you just don't know how poor they
[1:38:11] are you people around here in California
[1:38:15] don't know what poor people is till you
[1:38:18] get into something like that now he's
[1:38:20] talking about his friends now she lives
[1:38:23] in a little two room Shanty way up in
[1:38:26] the head of the Hill her husband was
[1:38:29] killed two years ago on his own tractor
[1:38:32] an
[1:38:34] alcoholic turned over and broke his neck
[1:38:38] and the little boy found
[1:38:41] him and she's got two teenage children
[1:38:45] that's kind of going astray with no
[1:38:48] father and that poor little old woman
[1:38:51] quiet humble little Christian oh I never
[1:38:55] heard her raise her voice in her life
[1:38:58] and she
[1:38:59] was dinging on them old heels up there
[1:39:02] raising that old crawfish ground trying
[1:39:05] to raise a little patch of corn to take
[1:39:07] care of those children oh it was such a
[1:39:11] p pitiful
[1:39:13] sight and we were sitting at the table
[1:39:17] talking and they just love me they got a
[1:39:20] room up there that I just call my room
[1:39:23] when I go there used to Pastor the
[1:39:25] Baptist Church there at miltown and so I
[1:39:27] just had a room where I would stay with
[1:39:29] the rights and I said talking about
[1:39:31] Visions I said now you know I told them
[1:39:34] about what would have happened I said
[1:39:36] now like it has to have something the
[1:39:39] only thing I know it'll have if it ever
[1:39:42] happens like that it'll be a faith that
[1:39:46] God will have to give me because when
[1:39:48] that anointing comes on me just seems
[1:39:51] like super faith I said Rises it up in
[1:39:56] me something that there's not a shadow
[1:39:59] of a doubt and I said oh how I trust I
[1:40:03] said just like I've been having visions
[1:40:06] when the Lord would tell me in a vision
[1:40:08] go down at a certain thing and a certain
[1:40:10] why am I there would be no question in
[1:40:12] my mind just go do it never fails so it
[1:40:15] just got to go got to
[1:40:18] happen so you got to believe what you're
[1:40:20] doing you got to have faith and
[1:40:23] confidence and I have in the Visions
[1:40:25] when the vision listen this might sound
[1:40:28] radical but the if the Lord God who's
[1:40:31] here on this platform now can tell the
[1:40:33] secret of every heart in here or tell
[1:40:35] you what will be or what won't be you
[1:40:38] know that you see it night after night
[1:40:40] if he tell me that George Washington was
[1:40:43] going to raise from the grave tomorrow
[1:40:45] out at the National Cemetery I'd invite
[1:40:49] the whole world to come see it get done
[1:40:52] that's exactly right I believe him he's
[1:40:56] never failed me I've seen Vision since I
[1:40:59] was 18 months old and not one time has
[1:41:03] it ever failed and it never will because
[1:41:08] it's God don't let nobody change your
[1:41:11] mind on
[1:41:12] that like none of the vision failed none
[1:41:15] of the Visions failed none of the
[1:41:16] Visions failed he's taking off the scene
[1:41:18] except that one failed don't you let the
[1:41:20] devil fool you
[1:41:22] God uh prophets don't make mistakes the
[1:41:25] Visions don't
[1:41:26] fail uh what fails is people what fails
[1:41:30] is your expectation but God's word ain't
[1:41:33] going to fail and if you quote what God
[1:41:35] Said in this word it's not your business
[1:41:38] to make it work God will make it work
[1:41:41] it's your business to say Amen to what
[1:41:43] he said if he said you're healed it's
[1:41:46] not your business how you going to get
[1:41:48] healed just say what God Said about you
[1:41:52] you're already healed by his stripes and
[1:41:55] you can claim any promise Amen Let The
[1:42:00] Devil fool you we're in a we're in a
[1:42:02] time where people are switching and
[1:42:03] changing and prove this and prove that
[1:42:06] God don't have to prove nothing his
[1:42:10] existence is evidence enough the sun
[1:42:14] rises it sets the mountain ranges his
[1:42:17] creation his handiwork you have to
[1:42:20] suppress Express the knowledge that
[1:42:22] there's a Creator out there if you say
[1:42:24] there is no God we know there is a God
[1:42:28] in his name what's his name Jesus Christ
[1:42:33] amen not not another
[1:42:35] name amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise
[1:42:38] there's no name like that name the Lord
[1:42:43] Jesus Christ that's God's
[1:42:47] name they didn't know it before but we
[1:42:49] know it today yes sir
[1:42:54] amen and so God sends these visions and
[1:42:58] brother bam continues on he says in
[1:43:00] paragraph 56 and so then I was talking
[1:43:03] like
[1:43:04] that and I said now if the Lord would
[1:43:07] tell me a certain thing would happen
[1:43:09] like your little crippled sister sitting
[1:43:12] here little Edith and they were poor
[1:43:14] people but I was
[1:43:17] welcome I had a big old bowl of beans
[1:43:21] Pinto beans baked with
[1:43:24] cornbread sliced onions and I can eat
[1:43:28] that so I was raised on it how many
[1:43:31] knows what he's talking
[1:43:33] about how many don't eat beans and
[1:43:36] cornbread well you ain't eaten yet if
[1:43:38] you don't I know exactly what he talking
[1:43:41] about and I was just eating away and
[1:43:44] having a good time and mother R had
[1:43:47] baked me a big cherry cobbler you know
[1:43:50] out of the the little tree that I used
[1:43:52] to help her pick it out of there Mrs
[1:43:54] Wright in her 80s and she's 70 something
[1:43:57] with that Afflicted girl I just do
[1:44:01] anything for those people I could and we
[1:44:05] were talking about the building the new
[1:44:08] church up there the Tabernacle and Miss
[1:44:12] Wright said to me how's the pledges
[1:44:15] coming on up at the Tabernacle I said
[1:44:18] brother right I'm not there enough to
[1:44:20] know so you know what said Haddie wanted
[1:44:23] to pledge $50 towards that church and
[1:44:28] brother robertonson the trustee or the
[1:44:30] church or one of them the chairman
[1:44:32] wouldn't let her give it said because
[1:44:35] that' take her about six months to dig
[1:44:38] $50 out of them Hills over there said
[1:44:41] but she give 20 and brother banam she
[1:44:44] wants I thought you know what I got $20
[1:44:48] here in my pocket me to give it to me to
[1:44:50] pick up some eggs and I said I'll just
[1:44:52] give her that 20 before I leave back
[1:44:56] she's away from here and and you'll
[1:44:58] never know it so I bought her ice boxes
[1:45:02] and things cuz I felt so sorry for her
[1:45:04] up there that little old mother trying
[1:45:06] to work way on that hill and so I
[1:45:08] thought I'll just give her this
[1:45:10] $20 is what I'll do when I leave I'll
[1:45:14] just slip it so she'll just get it and
[1:45:17] that's her $20 she paid in on the Church
[1:45:20] of there so I thought I'll just give her
[1:45:23] that so when I said something said to me
[1:45:27] but your lord stood One Day by the side
[1:45:30] of a wall and seeing rich men putting
[1:45:34] thousands of dollars into a
[1:45:37] treasury and little Widow come by and
[1:45:40] she only had three pennies all her
[1:45:43] living and now what would you have done
[1:45:46] if you had stood there you'd see that
[1:45:49] little W put them three pennies in you'd
[1:45:51] run over and say oh no sister don't do
[1:45:54] that don't do that because we got plenty
[1:45:56] in here we don't need that but Jesus
[1:45:59] never told her not to do
[1:46:01] it he let her go ahead and do it because
[1:46:04] he know he had something for her down
[1:46:08] the road see little something
[1:46:12] better you see so he just let her God
[1:46:16] loves a cheerful a cheerful Giver
[1:46:21] can we say Amen to that oh I got to give
[1:46:25] this I'm mandated to give it God is not
[1:46:27] concerned about your begrudgingly giving
[1:46:30] few little dollars that you could give
[1:46:33] but he loves a cheerful Giver what is
[1:46:36] this example of this woman with the two
[1:46:38] mights tell us it's not the amount that
[1:46:41] you give but it's the amount you're not
[1:46:45] giving it was she gave her
[1:46:49] all she gave all that she had and it it
[1:46:53] caught Jesus's attention and he pulled
[1:46:56] his disciples together and pointed it
[1:46:58] out to her of the rich they gave more
[1:47:01] than her but really she gave more
[1:47:05] because the percentage of what she had
[1:47:08] to what she gave outweighed what any
[1:47:11] rich man
[1:47:12] gave and Jesus pointed that out and the
[1:47:16] prophet now takes this scripture in the
[1:47:19] New Testament our Lord Jesus a parable
[1:47:22] picks it up and applies it to Sister
[1:47:25] Haddie just happens to be a widow just
[1:47:27] coincidence
[1:47:29] maybe just happens to be the church was
[1:47:32] building a new building so they can
[1:47:33] preach the seals she pledged 50 they
[1:47:37] only took 20 two tens two mites
[1:47:42] maybe
[1:47:44] uhuh you
[1:47:47] know it it doesn't really matter what
[1:47:50] you
[1:47:52] give if your heart ain't in it it ain't
[1:47:55] right
[1:47:58] anyways if you're giving for somebody to
[1:48:02] give you credit or Pat you on the bat
[1:48:04] like you did your duty God's not God
[1:48:06] owns everything I mean you're not you
[1:48:10] can't be god-given
[1:48:12] none of us can be God
[1:48:15] giving he gave his
[1:48:18] all amen and when it comes time for us
[1:48:21] to give to God why we get so
[1:48:25] tight why we get you know we get so
[1:48:30] Frugal our budget comes into
[1:48:36] play when you want to go play you ain't
[1:48:39] got no budget but when it's time to give
[1:48:41] to the
[1:48:43] Lord oh I'm preaching nice this morning
[1:48:47] yes yes I'm preaching this
[1:48:52] morning
[1:48:54] uhhuh all right but this this is what
[1:48:58] this this uh this testimony gives us
[1:49:01] here of this widow she gives all that
[1:49:05] she has Jesus points it out brother
[1:49:07] brandham is pointing this out like on
[1:49:10] purpose he's opening up This Woman's
[1:49:14] life her husband was killed he was an
[1:49:19] alcoholic
[1:49:21] he he uh was the father to those
[1:49:24] children now he's gone and this is the
[1:49:27] background for sister
[1:49:31] Hattie
[1:49:34] now let's go a little bit
[1:49:38] further all
[1:49:46] right here what the prophet of God says
[1:49:49] here in the message I'll pick this back
[1:49:53] up in my new
[1:49:56] ministry paragraph
[1:49:59] number I think it's paragraph number two
[1:50:03] no paragraph 180 my new ministry
[1:50:06] paragraph
[1:50:08] 180 the brother R was giving this
[1:50:12] testimony we we all know sister hadie
[1:50:14] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:50:16] but I thought it was beautiful to see
[1:50:18] what her background was to see her
[1:50:21] situation to see the turmoil in her life
[1:50:25] she's a widow her children are going
[1:50:28] astray they probably have a good reason
[1:50:30] to go astray the one son sees dad killed
[1:50:34] like that is a big wreck and they need
[1:50:36] that strong man they need that and this
[1:50:39] is all G and all of this is working now
[1:50:41] brother bandam in my new ministry says
[1:50:44] this here paragraph number 180 say the
[1:50:46] super anointing swept over me just up a
[1:50:49] little bit says tell Hattie that she's
[1:50:52] found Grace in the sight of God who
[1:50:55] would have thought said tell her to ask
[1:50:59] whatever she will then you speak it by
[1:51:02] this gift into existence whatever she
[1:51:05] ask speak it into existence I looked at
[1:51:08] sister Haddie the first time it was ever
[1:51:12] performed on a human being I said sister
[1:51:15] Hattie ask what you will God is going to
[1:51:18] give it to you
[1:51:22] brother bam continues paragraph had he
[1:51:25] said to me brother banam what do you
[1:51:30] mean very simple very ignorant didn't
[1:51:33] have it figured out she says brother B
[1:51:35] what do you
[1:51:36] mean I said ask anything your heart
[1:51:40] desires and it should be produced right
[1:51:43] here that you'll know that the Lord God
[1:51:47] Of Heaven answers and his scriptures are
[1:51:51] true yes amen my first time with the new
[1:51:55] gift my first anointing I could hardly
[1:51:58] hear her and she looked around we had
[1:52:01] been talking about her little crippled
[1:52:02] sister I said oh no doubt in my heart
[1:52:06] within a few minutes little Edith will
[1:52:08] be jumping to the glory of God Haddie
[1:52:11] looked around all around she said
[1:52:13] brother Bill my greatest desire is for
[1:52:17] the Salvation of my two boys voice what
[1:52:21] why there couldn't have been a greater
[1:52:25] thing she could have asked for
[1:52:28] $10,000 she could have got it she would
[1:52:30] have got it what if it would have been
[1:52:32] some millionaire he would have asked for
[1:52:35] another million God know what she was
[1:52:38] going to ask for
[1:52:42] amen all right how many thank God for
[1:52:47] that so what does this do
[1:52:50] this opens up to us this is God now
[1:52:54] these are not just Bible stories these
[1:52:56] are not just little testimonies we hear
[1:52:58] on the tape or we look in the book you
[1:53:01] got to see yourself in Sister Hattie
[1:53:04] amen uhhuh you got to you got to see the
[1:53:09] Simplicity see some of us can't see see
[1:53:12] us as poor as she was or less fortunate
[1:53:15] as she was or like this we see ourselves
[1:53:18] but we got look what God
[1:53:20] chose look at the look at the station in
[1:53:23] life that God used as an example I'm
[1:53:26] going to for the first time upon a human
[1:53:28] being who am I going to use as an
[1:53:31] example for this third pool Ministry
[1:53:35] upon a human being who am I going to
[1:53:38] choose over the entire Globe he had
[1:53:41] thousands and
[1:53:43] millions of people to choose from and he
[1:53:46] chooses not an associate member of the
[1:53:49] Brandon Tabernacle not an associate
[1:53:53] pastor I'd say not a not one of the
[1:53:56] other contemporary Ministries and great
[1:53:59] ministers and great brothers and
[1:54:02] families that have the
[1:54:04] well-rounded testimony as a Believer
[1:54:06] look at what he
[1:54:08] chooses look at what God
[1:54:11] chooses does that shake you does that
[1:54:14] awaken you to something he's going to
[1:54:17] use a human being aren't you interested
[1:54:20] in what kind of human being God
[1:54:23] chose and the circumstance that led up
[1:54:26] to

[1:54:31] nothing to do with how smart you are
[1:54:33] what you have and what you don't have it

[1:57:48] now
[1:57:50] did it stop with sister

[1:57:57] question does God still honor that even
[1:58:01] today did it go beyond sister
[1:58:04] Edith yes it did brother brandom

[1:58:21] that so I like that somebody said take
[1:58:24] your
[1:58:25] time did somebody say that or I just

[1:58:30] it anyway thank you thank you thank you
[1:58:33] that's a good believer right there all
[1:58:36] right take your time squ in our
[1:58:39] seat yes sir all right so the prophet of
[1:58:43] God takes the message um in these two
[1:58:47] quotes as I was with Moses and paragraph
[1:58:50] 145 he's talking about sister hadie here
[1:58:52] again and then he says this
[1:58:59] here as I was with Moses paragraph 145
[1:59:02] little old sister hadie right there
[1:59:04] sitting in the back of the building with
[1:59:06] her heart off the things of the world
[1:59:09] she was believing she said brother
[1:59:12] brandham that's nothing but the truth
[1:59:14] she didn't just say it from here God
[1:59:18] spoke out of her
[1:59:20] heart I said Hattie ask what you will
[1:59:23] I'll give it to you she said what must I
[1:59:25] ask I said you got an old father and
[1:59:28] mother sitting here you got a crippled
[1:59:30] sister she's still sitting in that chair
[1:59:33] you can ask for her you can ask for your
[1:59:35] mother and father you're poor you don't
[1:59:38] have any money ask what you want to she
[1:59:41] says well I don't know what to ask said
[1:59:44] I just don't know she said my greatest
[1:59:47] desire is the Salvation of my two boys I
[1:59:49] said I give you your boys in the name of
[1:59:53] Jesus Christ and they both converted
[1:59:57] love the Lord Jesus both been baptized
[1:59:59] in his name serving God daily with all
[2:00:02] their heart Ed Dalton sitting here
[2:00:05] somewhere right down here about his
[2:00:08] children the same thing so it went
[2:00:12] extended to brother Ed Dalton how many
[2:00:15] you know the Dalton brother Jim Dalton
[2:00:17] is the oldest son of brother Ed but the
[2:00:20] Jim shared these
[2:00:23] testimonies uh with us he's a living
[2:00:25] witness of
[2:00:26] this brother mam continues in the queen
[2:00:29] of the South
[2:00:30] 1960 paragraph number 91 just a step up
[2:00:34] from that he says yeah I see one man I
[2:00:37] know this Baptist brother sitting over
[2:00:39] here brother Dalton I want to say
[2:00:41] something I'm expecting brother Dalton
[2:00:44] you see why I'm lining him up there
[2:00:46] about how many heard the story The squir
[2:00:49] worlds and things you all did down here
[2:00:51] I guess and so forth a new ministry
[2:00:54] taking a hold in my life that's what I
[2:00:56] got these here for tonight to try it I
[2:01:00] seen it happen about three or four times
[2:01:03] the first time it ever happened on a
[2:01:06] mortal being the second time it happened
[2:01:09] was to this Baptist brother sitting over
[2:01:12] here he setting there at the church his
[2:01:15] children teenage Reckless as they could
[2:01:18] be and we've been praying for his
[2:01:21] children all at once the same Jehovah
[2:01:24] Gyra turned around I said I give you
[2:01:26] your children in the name of Jesus
[2:01:31] Christ so we see that gift didn't just
[2:01:34] stay with sister Haddie it extended to
[2:01:37] brother Dalton and his family brother Ed
[2:01:43] Dalton what do we take from this we see
[2:01:45] that this Faith saying the right things
[2:01:48] is uncommon conscious we see that many
[2:01:51] times our faith we're unaware of it as
[2:01:55] brother bam told us many times it's an
[2:01:57] unconscious thing it's something that we
[2:02:01] have and we don't really realize it's
[2:02:03] not something that we manipulate either
[2:02:05] we believe it or we don't and when we
[2:02:08] say something that's from our heart that
[2:02:10] is true it could set the stage for God
[2:02:13] to do something great and marvelous for
[2:02:16] you he can do that for you this morning
[2:02:18] I believe that you can do that in your
[2:02:21] prayer time he did this um in a home a
[2:02:26] little home meeting there listening to a
[2:02:27] testimony did it for brother Dalton we
[2:02:29] can see this example through the message
[2:02:33] we see that God used this background of
[2:02:37] this Brokenness and the the Family
[2:02:39] Matters and family troubles that God
[2:02:42] moved on the scene and we all truly want
[2:02:46] to see our loved ones saved as well I
[2:02:49] believe that God is still the same God
[2:02:51] this morning that he ever was and that
[2:02:54] we can say it from our heart and brings
[2:02:57] in this principle brother Dalton Jim
[2:02:59] Dalton told me I can't remember the
[2:03:01] amount but he said that uh his dad had
[2:03:04] gave a
[2:03:05] preacher
[2:03:07] $100 they were trinitarian preacher I
[2:03:10] got the testimony on my phone I'm sorry
[2:03:12] I didn't think of this right now but
[2:03:14] brother Jim told me he said his dad they
[2:03:16] were struggling at the time and he gave
[2:03:20] this preacher $100 toward this ministry
[2:03:23] and he said it was right after that that
[2:03:25] the lord gave them the revelation of
[2:03:28] water baptism in the name of Jesus it
[2:03:31] was just like a little gift that he gave
[2:03:33] to towards the Lord and it opened up so
[2:03:36] many other things that God had blessed
[2:03:38] him with and then down the line they
[2:03:40] come into the message and here we see
[2:03:42] this great gift on display in the giving
[2:03:46] it's not the amount you give some people
[2:03:49] give sparingly but God likes a cheerful
[2:03:51] Giver cheerful in your praise in your
[2:03:55] Worship in your time and your ministry
[2:03:58] to help others if you have a Ministry
[2:04:01] that helps other people you'll always
[2:04:04] have a crowd to talk to you'll always
[2:04:07] have a group of people to minister to
[2:04:09] because people need help they respond to
[2:04:12] love they respond to people that can
[2:04:14] help them and if we try you know the
[2:04:17] order of the first and second third
[2:04:19] pools wasn't the doctrine first it was
[2:04:24] the Loaves and the fishes first it was
[2:04:26] love is something attractive to people
[2:04:29] something that encourages people and if
[2:04:32] that's your motive and your objective
[2:04:34] when you see another man or another
[2:04:36] woman doesn't matter their station in
[2:04:38] life if you're looking at an opportunity
[2:04:40] to help them then there's a connection
[2:04:44] there cuz all human beings want to be
[2:04:46] loved and they need that connection then
[2:04:48] you can take them to to the next level
[2:04:50] and then the next one you got to catch
[2:04:51] the fish before you clean the fish amen
[2:04:56] and after you cleaning you can give them
[2:04:58] to me and I'll eat
[2:05:00] them so that's that's the simple analogy
[2:05:04] is that you know the first pull was to a
[2:05:07] great number of people to help them
[2:05:09] everybody can identify with the bait on
[2:05:12] the hook and the bait on the hook was
[2:05:14] healing Divine Healing love something
[2:05:17] that was a human connection and then it
[2:05:20] goes further into that and we see that
[2:05:23] that God uses these traumatic uh
[2:05:26] situations in the background the the
[2:05:29] Shadows the you know he uses the you
[2:05:32] know the light and the Darkness he uses
[2:05:36] these situations and it's just beautiful
[2:05:39] how he used a widow woman in our text
[2:05:42] today just the Widow's might she gave
[2:05:45] $20 to pledge towards a tabernacle when
[2:05:49] brother bam said she couldn't even
[2:05:50] afford 50
[2:05:52] cents really she she pledged $50 she
[2:05:56] couldn't afford 50 cents he said they
[2:05:59] took
[2:06:00] $20 he wanted to give it back to her
[2:06:03] something said don't give it back
[2:06:05] because God's got something more for her
[2:06:07] up the
[2:06:09] road who won in
[2:06:12] this who won look who gave and look who
[2:06:17] received amen I can never give back to
[2:06:21] God what he's given to me even the
[2:06:24] thought the possibility that he would
[2:06:27] hear my prayer this morning is enough
[2:06:30] don't you love him God bless you so much
[2:06:34] we trust the Lord will bless you we
[2:06:35] trust that you can see yourself in
[2:06:37] Sister Hattie see yourself in brother
[2:06:39] Dalton and see yourself in this great
[2:06:42] promise of a third poll amen God bless
[2:06:45] you let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[2:06:48] you for your your word today thank you

[2:06:57] doubt and
[2:06:58] criticism how we criticize ourself and
[2:07:01] how we doubt even what you've done for
[2:07:04] us now we look at what we don't have and
[2:07:07] all the hurt and the pain and we look at
[2:07:10] what could have happened or what should
[2:07:13] have happened and what didn't happen but
