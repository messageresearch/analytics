Let's go to B flat. And I pulled up to an intersection and I I was just stopped there waiting for the light to turn green. And I'm looking in my rearview mirror and this big black truck is just barreling this like very fast, probably going 55 towards me. And it's just growing bigger and bigger and I'm just like waiting for it to slow down. And I'm just watching it and I kind of just I pu I push myself back because you know if if it hits me I don't want to you know get so I push myself back into my seat and I'm kind of like just bracing.

He is a wonderful savior, our Lord Jesus Christ. So God bless each of you. We welcome you to the house of the Lord tonight. We're going to continue on in this adoption part number four. Um we'll back up a little bit to paragraph number in the 70s there. Paragraph 77 I believe and we'll take a few moments of hearing that word. I know it's going to be a blessing to all of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord that we have a clean word to listen to. Amen. Thank God for this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the best thing out there. It's this word that we have received. Amen. How many really can recognize that &gt;&gt; that this is the voice of God for our day, for our generation. Now, in the scriptures, we like to take a a portion of scripture just to read before we go to the tape. It's in Ephesians chapter 1. Brother Brandham is bringing that on. He's trying to get through a good portion of the book and um he doesn't quite get finished like he wanted to, but he does get to this part. But in Ephesians chapter 1 vers number nine, happy to have brother Ly back from California and each of you. Amen. Verse Vers 9, Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will, that we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ, in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and whom also after that ye believed, you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance. ance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory. Amen. Thank God for his word. So let's sing uh that happy to have Levi back as well. And each of you only believe. Amen. Singing only believe. only believe that all things are possible. Only we [Music] only believe we only believe we all things are possible [Music] only. Let's lift our hand and say Lord I believe and Lord I believe. &gt;&gt; Lord, I believe that all things are possible. Lord, I believe. [Music] Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe all things are possible. Lord, I really, [Music] we're happy to have Sean back as well. &gt;&gt; I don't want to forget anyone. God bless you, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; He's a logist of God. That is true. that was the son of God. Then he made man that little God. And he said, "If they call those who the word of God came to, the prophets, if they call them gods who the word of God came to," and God said so himself that they were gods. &gt;&gt; He told Moses, "I made you a god &gt;&gt; and made Aaron your prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I may act like a religious crank, but I'm not. &gt;&gt; Oh, and your eyes can come open and see those things. &gt;&gt; All right. He made man a god. &gt;&gt; A god in his domain. And his domain goes from sea to sea, from shore to shore. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has the control of it. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came being the one God without sin, he proved it. &gt;&gt; When the winds blow, he said, "Peace be still." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when the trees said, "No man eat from thee." Verily I say unto you, you that's little gods, if you'll say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you've said will come to pass, you can have what you've said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go right back to Genesis to the original. What is it now? The world and nature is groaning, crying, everything's a moving what? For the manifestation of the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When true sons, &gt;&gt; born sons, &gt;&gt; fil sons, &gt;&gt; speak into the word is that &gt;&gt; I believe we're on the border of it right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say to this mountain, let it be so. &gt;&gt; Brother, I I desire so and so a certain thing done. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. I give it to you in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, my crops are burning up about the earth. I haven't had any rain. I'll send your rain in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, your &gt;&gt; Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. God orained it at the beginning. He gave man the domain. He gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it to his name with this assurance. Ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; oh, brother Palmer. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. The position the church as I said the book of Ephesians is the book of Joshua and Joshua placing the people where they belong. Now, if they wouldn't stand still and they put Ephraim here and Abra on Manasses land and this come back and fuss and steward, how are they ever going to get along? When one said, "I'm a Baptist. I'm a Methodist. I'm a Pentecostal. I'm one this. I'm a Tunisian. I'm that I'm so How you going to do it? Stand still." &gt;&gt; God's will to place his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God, let me live to see it as my prayer. So close I can just feel it with my hands almost look like just right there. That's what I've longed to see. &gt;&gt; Waiting for the time when walk down the street. There lays a laying there from his mother's womb. Silver and gold have I known &gt;&gt; waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When God will make himself known. when they'll stop sickness, they'll stop cancer, they'll stop diseases. You think cancer is something? The Bible said there's coming a time when man will rot right in their flesh in the buzzards. They'll eat off their carcasses before they even die. &gt;&gt; Cancer is a toothache to what's coming. &gt;&gt; But remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the seal of God. That's what we're striving for now. To get in and be positionally placed into the kingdom of God before this horrible plagues strike. &gt;&gt; Oh, how good &gt;&gt; the dispensation of time, fullness of time, the inheritance in whom we also obtain inheritance being predestinated. How is our inheritance given to us? Through what? predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Predestination is for knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How did God know he could trust you to be a preacher? &gt;&gt; He's for knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not he that willth or he that runth or it's God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Predestination. He knew what was in you. He knew what was in you before you even come on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. He know what was in here before this earth for you to come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's him. That's the infinite God. Infinite. We're finite. We can only think finite. It's been so much to me since that. What happened to me? I don't know. When I think there when I stood there for those few joyful moments and thought there's no tomorrow, there was no yesterday. There's no sickness. There's no sorrow. There's no little bit of happiness. It's not a whole lot of happiness. It's all happiness. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh. When I stood there and I said, "What is this?" That voice said, "This is perfect love." And everything that you ever loved and everything that ever loved you is shared with you now. &gt;&gt; And you will present us to the Lord Jesus when he comes as trophies of your ministry. I've seen those beautiful women standing there all grabbing me and screaming, "My precious darling brother." Seen those men with that shaggy hair around their neck here running grabbing me and saying, "Our darling brother." And I thought, "What does this mean?" He said, "They're your people." I said, "My people, there couldn't be that many brands. There's millions." He said, "They're your converts." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are your converts. They're the ones that said, "You see that woman standing there? The most beautiful woman I ever seen said she was a past 90 years old when you led her to God." &gt;&gt; No wonder she's crying. My darling brother &gt;&gt; said she'll never be old no more. &gt;&gt; She's passed from that. She's in the splendor of youth. She's standing here. She can't drink a cold drink of water. She don't need it. She can't lay down and sleep cuz she don't get tired. &gt;&gt; There's no tomorrow, no yesterday, dinner, nothing. We're in eternity now. But some glorious day the son of God shall come and you will be judged according to the word that you preach to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I said, "Will Paul have to bring his group?" Yes, sir. I said, "I preached it just exactly like Paul said it. &gt;&gt; I never did it. I never tuck into any church creeds or anything else. I stay the same and all of them scream with one accord. We know that we're listening with assurance said you will present us to him and then we'll all go back to earth again to live forever. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just then I started coming to you. I look laying on the bed and I see my old carcasser getting old and wrinkled and drawn up and and diseased up and afflicted and I see my hands behind my head and I thought, "Oh, will I have to go back in that thing again?" And I kept hearing that voice, "Keep pressing on. Keep pressing on." I said, "Lord, I've always believed if I keep believing it, but I'll press for them so help me. I'll have so many there. I let me live, Lord, and I'll put another million in there if you &gt;&gt; I don't care what color, what creed, what nationality, what they are. They're all one when they get there." And those boundary lines just passed away. Oh, I could see those women so pretty. Never seen went long, long hair way down their back, long skirts way down his barefooted. See that man with shaggy hair around their neck, red heads, blackheads, and all different colors. And they were throwing their arms around me. I could feel them. I felt their hands just God is my judge in this sacred book open. I could feel them just the same. I feel my hands on my face. They were throwing their arms around me. No sensation of women like we be now. I don't care how holy you are, who you are, what kind of a preacher you are, priest or whatever you might be. There's no man can let a woman throw his arms around without having human sensations. &gt;&gt; It's exactly the truth. My brother, when you pass between here and it ain't that way there. Oh my. It's so all there's. It's impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all love. Everything is real, brother. And everything's real, sister. There's no death, no sorrow, no jealousy, no nothing. Nothing can enter there. It's just perfection. That's what I'm striving for. That's what I'm placing for. I said, oh Lord, that's what I'm here at the church for. Trying to set the church in order, telling you, brother, sister, there's only one thing that can enter that. That's perfect love. &gt;&gt; Not because you're loyal to the Brandham Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or Baptist Church. Damn's all right. You should be. But oh friends, you've got not because you spoke with tongues, danced in the spirit, because you cast out devils or move mountains with faith. That all's all right for that's all right. But still, unless that real perfect love is in there. &gt;&gt; That was where perfect love was. And that's the only thing that'll let you in there. That's the only thing that can stay there. It's the only thing there was there. Oh my. It's an adoption. God before the foundation of the world. Now, let's hurry up. Let's get this one chapter through. Anyhow, if possible in the next 10 minutes, through whom we also have obtained an inheritance. We inherit what? Eternal life. Being predestinated. How? Does everybody understand that? &gt;&gt; Did you call on God? No. God called on you. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "Oh, I just sought God and sought God." You did not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No man never sought God. It's God seeking man. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No man can come to me except my father draws him first." &gt;&gt; See, it's a nature of man to run from God. &gt;&gt; And you say now that that's what bothers me all to preach to you people. Don't remain on in the same condition you've been going in. Change. Now hear me as I said, thus sayeth the Lord. I've never called myself this. I'm not. But you call me your prophet or a prophet. The world believes that. The world around millions and millions and millions of people. I've spoke direct and indirect to 10 or 10 or 12 million people or more. Directly speaking, I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders. Not one of them have ever failed. &gt;&gt; And that's right. He's foretold me things. It's never failed to happen. Just exactly. I bring any man to trial for that. That's right. I don't claim to be a prophet, but you listen to me. Thus sayaeth the Lord, it'll take perfect love to put you in that place. &gt;&gt; For that's all there was there. No matter how many how much religious demonstrations, how many good deeds you've done or whatever you done, that won't count nothing on that day. &gt;&gt; It'll take perfect love. So whatever you do, you lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you. &gt;&gt; I'm just as I said this morning, I was made my whole makeup is grace. A lot of people say, "No, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours." Well, you do something for me and I'll do something for you. That's not grace. Amen. &gt;&gt; Grace says, "If your back is itching, I'll scratch it anyhow." &gt;&gt; Whether you scratch mine or not, you slap me on the face and say, "My back needs itching. Need scratching, I'll scratch it." &gt;&gt; See, that's it. Do something. I don't believe in works. &gt;&gt; I believe it works as love. Works is works is a manifestation that grace has taken place. &gt;&gt; I don't live true to my wife because believe she'd divorce me if I didn't. I live true to her because I love her. I don't preach the gospel because I think go to hell if I didn't. I preach the gospel because I love him. &gt;&gt; Certainly. You think I cross those stormy seas and them planes diving back and forth and lightning flashing around and and everything else and most any minute and everybody's screaming and hail mies are going on through the plane and everything and people swinging and them safety belts and the pilots saying they left gas life 15 minutes longer. Don't know where we're at. You think I'd do that just just for the fun of doing it? Huh? You think I'd get back out there in the jungle where German soldiers had to put their arms around me like this each night and take me in and out of the meeting until the Holy Spirit begin to perform miracles? Communist set with night scopes to shoot me a mile away. You think I do that just for the fun of it? Because something in me loves their humans that Christ died for. Paul said, "I'm not only willing to go up to Jerusalem, but I'm going up there to be crucified. I'm going up to die. I'm going up there to die for the cause of the Lord." It's something love that constrains you, that makeshift. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. If I have preached the gospel for money, if it would have been, I wouldn't have been $20,000 tonight in debt. I wouldn't been that in debt. No, sir. Because I'd have kept some of some of the millions that have been given to me. One man, one man sent FBI agents with a million500,000 money draft. Now I said take it back. Not for money. It isn't money. I don't preach the gospel for money. &gt;&gt; Not for that. It's because of the love. The thing I want to do is when I cross that last breath, which may be in five minutes from now. It may be in two hours from now. It may be 50 years from now. I don't know when it'll be, but when it must I do ride there, I want to see in the splendor of youth running coloring my darling brother. &gt;&gt; My brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's in my heart. That's why I don't try to disagree with you to be be different, but I'm trying to put you on the road that's right. &gt;&gt; That's the way in. Not your church, not your denomination, but your birth in Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh my. in whom we have obtained inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things at the counsel of his own will. Listen, we're going to close a few minutes. Listen close now before we close. That we should be to the praises of his glory who first trusted Christ in whom you also trusted. Watch this now closely. Get on your jackets, gospel jackets. Hold your ears open. Listen close. I'm on the 13th verse. In whom you also trusted after that ye heard faith cometh by &gt;&gt; hearing the &gt;&gt; word of. After that, you heard the word of truth. What is truth? The word of God. Is that right? &gt;&gt; John 17:17, you just taken down scriptures. Jesus said, "Sanctify them. Follow through the truth. Thy word is truth." &gt;&gt; After you heard the truth, the gospel of your salvation. What was the salvation he's trying to tell them? Predestinated before the foundation of the earth. Is that right? &gt;&gt; To adoption of sons. Predestinated eternal life. Now if you come into eternal life, you've been saved, sanctified, filled with the Holy Spirit, your sons. Now God won't replace you positionally. Oh, so that you can work for his kingdom and his glory. That's the gospel. Be first. Hear the word. Repent. be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, taking away all your sins, calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the promised land. The promise isn't to every souljourner that's on your road. If you left your home tonight, a sinner saying, "I'll walk over to the Brandom Tabernacle." God gives you the opportunity tonight. &gt;&gt; There's one thing lays between you and the promised land. What is the promised land? The Holy Ghost. What lay between Joshua and the promised land was a Jordan. Exactly right. Moses being a type of Christ led the children up to the promised land. Then Moses did not take the children in the promised land. Joshua took the people in and divided up the land. Jesus paid the price, led them up to the Holy Spirit. God sent the Holy Spirit down and he positionally put the church in order. Amen. &gt;&gt; Each man filling him with his presence of his being. You see what I mean? &gt;&gt; All in Christ Jesus. How God predestinated this to the calling of this gospel. Paul Galatians 18 said, "If an angel come preach anything else, let him be accursed." &gt;&gt; The truth, the gospel. Now listen close as we read on finishing the verse. The gospel of your salvation. in whom also listen closely. After that ye believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the last days, the Bible said, now watch, in the last days, there's going to be two classes of people. One of them is going to have the seal of God, the other the mark of the beast. Is that right? How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Well, if the seal of God is the seal of if the seal of God is the Holy Ghost, then without the Holy Ghost is the mark of the beast. And the Bible said that the two spirits would be so close together, it would deceive the very elected if it was possible. &gt;&gt; It'll never do it because they were elected to eternal life. See &gt;&gt; churchgoing justice and honorary 10 virgins went out to meet the Lord. All sanctified, all holy, every one of them sanctified. Five were dilitarian. Let the lights go out. Five had aura in their lamps. And behold, the bridegroom cometh. And the five that had aura in their lamps went into the wedding supper. And the others was left outside where there were weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth. &gt;&gt; Be ready for you don't know what minute the Lord comes. Have you what is or represented the Bible? Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now do you hear seventh day Adventist brethren who said the seventh day is God's seal produce one scripture to prove it. The Bible said that the seal of God is the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Which, what's the 13th verse now? After that, you believe you were sealed with the with the Holy Spirit of promise. Turn to Ephesians 4:30. I believe that's it. See if we don't get 4:30 and see if this isn't the same. Ephesians the 4th chapter and the 30th verse. Yeah, here it is. 4:30. and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed until the day of redemption. &gt;&gt; How long when you really really receive the Holy Ghost? How long is it to last you? until the next revival, &gt;&gt; until grandma crosses your path, until the boss balls you out, until the day of your rep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; After you have died, after you have passed into that land that you're standing at with your loved ones, you are still filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. scripture. You're just as you are now. Only you've got you moved into another body. You've just changed houses. This one got old. You couldn't tack the shingles on it no more. The rafters got rotten. That's right. So, you just turn the old thing away and let it rot on down and moved into a new one. Is that right? &gt;&gt; For if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved, we have one waiting. &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember the other day going through that when a little baby's being formed in the womb of the mother and this little muscles are kicking and jumping and going on. But just as soon as the mother drops the baby and the baby's to earth, the first thing there is a spiritual body to catch that little natural body. Maybe the doctor will give it a like that or something or shake it, you know, when and immediately right to that mother's breast, it'll go moving its little head up and down on her mother's breast to make those milk veins bring milk on a little calf. As soon as it's dropped from the mother, it'll get up on its little knees. After a few minutes, what will it do? Move rice crepe back around, get a hold of that mother, and shake it little head up and down like that and get it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. When this natural body comes into earth, there's a spiritual body waiting for it. And when this natural body is dropped on the ground, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There is one waiting on earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We just move from one end to another. We change our dwelling places. &gt;&gt; This mortal must put on immortality. This spiritual, this corruption put on incorruption. this old wrinkled up troll suit over body, but it won't change its appearance at all. I mean, when it gets out of you'll still have the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a little something sounds twisting to you, but it's the Bible. Then I'll give you one little untwisted for you. Watch this one. One old Saul, the king that the old big old denominational preacher down there at that time, you know, it got head and shoulders above them all and was afraid. He didn't know nothing about the supernatural. David had to come and deliver the lamb out of the lion's mouth, kill Goliath, watch him. He got so far back from God, he got the hat in this holy royal preacher. &gt;&gt; And instead of being for him to try to help him, he turned against him. If that just isn't a picture exactly &gt;&gt; exactly picture &gt;&gt; turned right from him. How many is in here when I left on my first trip and preached David at slain Goliath? Well, I left many some of the few of the old-timers. I'm fixing to leave again on this. Remember, we'll see what just come around last Sunday. &gt;&gt; Is moving right into another phase. &gt;&gt; David's second campaign, second phase of his ministry. &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Which then he become king over Israel. &gt;&gt; Notice the ministry now is moving out into a greater phase, coming out greater. So did David. I notice this as he comes. David, oh, when God had David come out there and slay the lion, notice, and slay the bear, then slay the Philistine. &gt;&gt; Now, there come a time when God gave a evil spirit over to this old boy and I to what? To hate David. And I believe now these tapes. Now, listen, brethren, you own these tapes. If you disagree with me, forgive me. See, I love you. I'm gonna meet you over there anyhow. See, because if you're a man of God, I'm going to meet you anyhow. But I want to say this. Here's the reason. Just because that Saul saw that David had something that he didn't have. &gt;&gt; Then what happened? A little old ruddy draw over. The Bible said he was ruddy. That wasn't a very fair child. Rudy is just a little old drawed up sort of a fell and he went out there and Saul well he put Saul's armor on him and I imagine the shield come plumbing down over his feet &gt;&gt; and he said take this stuff off of me &gt;&gt; I maybe give him a doctor's degree a PhD or LLD or something you know &gt;&gt; he said I don't know nothing about that stuff because I haven't proved it let me have this what I know what I'm doing with &gt;&gt; Yes sir. He took the slingshot and it made David mad because the daughters, the churches, the churches was singing. Saul might have killed his thousands, but David killed his tens of thousands. Then he got jealous. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That old Jesus name stuff. There's nothing to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. And what did God do to him? God sent an evil spirit upon him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Exactly. What's happening? to hate David. And he hated David without a cause. &gt;&gt; David could have rung his neck a few times. &gt;&gt; He could, but he just let it go. He just never said nothing. He sure could have done. He went over, cut the tail of his coat off one night, come back, said, "Look at here. You see?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He could have done it, but he just let him alone. He could have broke his congregation up and scattered him and started an organization of himself if he wanted to, but he didn't do it. He just let Saul and let God do the fighting. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So as he went on out and the campaign finished on it and got on that evil spirit God so that Saul couldn't get no answer from God. After a while he the spirit of the Lord had departed from him and oh Samuel the one that they turned down. The one that really was the voice of God to him. &gt;&gt; The one that said to him before they even wanted to act like the world. Why does a church want to act like the world? Why does Pentecostal baptized Holy Ghost experienced Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterian want to act like the world? &gt;&gt; Why do they do it? I don't know. &gt;&gt; I I just can't understand it. You say, "Well, it's all fun to play poker. Just a little bit for fun." Just little piney or what you call it. It's a sin. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't have them things in your house. &gt;&gt; Well, it's no harm take this little bitty glass of beer. We just got a few men. My wife has a few in the afternoon and the first thing you know your children's got a few. &gt;&gt; Sure did. &gt;&gt; And you winning. &gt;&gt; Devil's just made a That's what he did in the beginning. And he certainly has made a target. I ye sisters. He just does that just because he knows what he can do. He can deceive a woman a thousand times quicker than a man. I know that hurts your feelings, but that's the truth. Exactly. That's what he done in the Garden of Eden. He can make She was honest. She was sincere, but she was deceived. &gt;&gt; Adam was not deceived. The Bible says he wasn't deceived, but she was deceived. &gt;&gt; So, he can deceive her. And yet, pastors will go right out in arname women preachers, put them out over congregations like that. And this Bible condemns it from Genesis to Revelation. &gt;&gt; They say, "Well, it's all right. It's all right. They got they preach the same as I know that's right. Like somebody starts speaking in tongues one time. I just kept on preaching. And when I got outside, a woman said to my son said, "I've got a message to give tomorrow night." Said, "Why your daddy comes on a platform?" Said, "Well, message me? What do you mean?" And that night when it got ready, when I was fixing to make the alter call, she fixed her hair all up and pulled up her stockings and everything, got ready, jumped up middle for jump up and down, spoke in tongues and prophesied. But I just kept on preaching. McMah recall. Well, I never respected it, but it wasn't right. So then, well, the Bible said not to said the the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's on the God speaking at the platform, let him speak. &gt;&gt; Paul said if something be revealed to one, let him hold his peace till the next finishes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now then, when I got outside, these people said, a big bunch of people said, "You grieve the Holy Ghost tonight." I said, "What doing? What did I do? Said, "Well, when that sister gave that message, Hallelujah." said that Well, I said I was preaching. She was out of order. Oh, I said that was fresh right off the throne. That's fresher than what she was preaching. Now, that just shows that shows either this, and I say to your respects, either insanity or either disrespect or illiterate teaching that don't know more about God than a rabbit knows about snowshoes. Now, that I don't say that to be a a silly remark because there's no place to joke, but that's that's exactly the truth. A person that would know that God's not an author of confusion. &gt;&gt; He's a peace. &gt;&gt; The Bible, they don't know. All they know how to do, jump up and down, speak in tong, say, "I got the Holy Ghost." Hallelujah. I've stood and seen in Africa witch doctors and things speak by the 5 thousands of them at a time jumping up and down blood all over their faces speaking in tongues and drink blood out of a human skull call on the devil and speak in tongues &gt;&gt; and yet speaking in tonesues is a gift of God &gt;&gt; but that's not the infallible proof of the Holy Ghost that &gt;&gt; I do believe that all inspired saints speak with tongues I believe a man sometime when you get so inspired with God because you speak with tongues. I believe that. But I don't believe that's any sign you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe there's times when you have faith. A person can walk out and lay hands on a little kid that's got a cancer and 50 preachers that pray for it and to be healed because that mother has faith for that child. God's given it to her. She's a member of the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe that. I've seen that done and I know that's true. But what it is is get the church in order, setting order so we can work. Now, let's finish the rest of this verse here before we go. After that, you receive, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise. Sealed. What is a seal? What is a seal? A seal is first thing it shows is a work that has been completed. A completed work. The next thing it shows is ownership. And the next thing it shows is security, keeping it. Say, for instance, I used to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. I used to work with my father on the railroad. We would load cars and we'd put in down here at this package company. We'd put in 10 cans and we'd set some up here and some down here and some up this way. But before that car was ever sealed, the inspector come through there and he pushed on it, shoved on this one, shook that one. Ah, condemn it. They'll break all the pieces before they get there. Condemn it. Take them out. Do it over. Inspector, condemn the car. The Holy Ghost is the inspector. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He shake you a little bit in your rattle. You believe all the word of God. I don't believe that old Jesus name stuff. &gt;&gt; Condemn it. &gt;&gt; You'll rattle. &gt;&gt; I don't believe in divine healing and those such a thing. &gt;&gt; Still rattled out. You believe Jesus Christ is saying yes to well in some way. You rattle. Kick it out. Get ready. Yes, &gt;&gt; brother. When it's ready to say amen. Have you received the Holy Ghost? Amen. Has everything been completed? Amen. Then what does the inspector do? Everything's packed in good and tight. Full of the gospel. Oh, every word of God is good. Everything is perfect. I believe every word. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do you believe that God still heals? Amen. You believe Jesus yesterday and forever? Amen. You believe the Holy Ghost is just as real as it ever was. Amen. You believe the same spirit fell on Paul on us? Amen. You believe it does the same things on us that did on them? Amen. Uh oh, she's getting tight now. &gt;&gt; Getting tight now. We're ready to close the door. &gt;&gt; All right. Then the inspector closes the door. What does he do? He puts a seal on it. Then he gets down here. He gets a hold of these little pliers of the thing. Reaches over there on this little thing and seals that. You'd better not break it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If that car is destination is Boston, it cannot be broken. It would be a penitentiary offense. They'll break that seal until it gets to Boston. And a man that has the authority can open that seal in him only. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's owned by this certain certain railroad company. It's their seal. It's their assurance that this car has been packed. This car is ready. It belongs to them. They couldn't put the BNO on the Pennsylvania. You've got to be sealed. And when it's sealed, and when the Christian is packed with the gospel, filled with the goodness of God, all the good things of God laying in him with an open heart, ready to work, willing to be positionally pleased, do anything that the Holy Spirit tells him to do, pass from death unto life, sanctified from all things of the world, walking in the light as the light comes to him, moving on. He's ready. Then God shuts the door of the world behind me, kicks it together like that and seals him with the Holy Ghost of power. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How long until the destination? &gt;&gt; Don't get him out here on the railroad track and break it open and see if everything's all right again. It's all right. Just leave it alone. &gt;&gt; The inspector has done inspected it. &gt;&gt; How long are you sealed? Until the day of your redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how long you're sealed. Well, when you die then, brother Brandham, what about if you die? You said you still have it. You have it forever. &gt;&gt; Where does life begin? At the altar right there, you see a little bit of shadow. That's the shadow, the seal, the Holy Spirit. Then it's a shadow of the shadows of the shadows, as I said the other day. But when you die, you keep on going through those shadows until you come to moisture. From moisture to a little trickling spring, from a spring to a creek, from a creek to a river, from a river to an ocean. See, of the love of God, &gt;&gt; you're just the same person. Look at here. Old Saul, the old backslider, he could not get through to God. Yet, he wasn't lost. &gt;&gt; He certainly wasn't. He was a prophet, but he just got outside of God. That's the reason, brother, and I said you're not lost. So then remember he just got out of the will of God. So then the first thing you know you wouldn't agree. Now maybe I shouldn't have said that. All right I'm just going on for a happy congregation tonight. &gt;&gt; So then you know and the first thing you know oh my then he went to the Yurundum. You know what the year of my mathundum was is a breastplate the f of at at the Aaron war and it was always God always has been a supernatural God answering in supernatural ways. And when a prophet prophesied and them mystic lights didn't come across that ur thunder, he was wrong. When a dreamer told a dream and it didn't flash on that urum thundum, I don't care how good it sound, it was wrong. &gt;&gt; And it's right. And I don't care just exactly how many doctor's degrees you got and how big your organization is. When you prophesy, preach it in according to this word, you're wrong, brethren. &gt;&gt; You're This is God's thunder. When you say you wasn't predestinated before the foundation of the world, she won't flash because the Bible said you was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you say that you are be baptized name of father, son, holy ghost, it doesn't flash because nobody in the Bible's ever baptized that way. &gt;&gt; Only the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; It won't flash. &gt;&gt; So there's something wrong somewhere. So the Europe thunder wouldn't answer old Saul. And he couldn't even have a dream. He was so far gone that he couldn't even have a dream. So, you know what he done? He went down to the witch and this old witch, the old devil doctor down there, witch doctor. And he said, "Can you divine?" She said, "Yes, but Saul said he'd kill everybody divine." He said, "I'll protect you dressed like a footman." He said, "Divine for me and bring me up from the world of the dead that's passed on beyond here." Now, listen to this. Bring me up the spirit of Samuel the prophet. And she went into to the vine. And when she did, she fell on her face. She said, "I see gods coming up." See, she's a heathen gods. Two or three of them, like father, son, holy ghost or something like that, you know. She said, she said, "I see gods coming up." Said, "Describe him. How does he look?" What does he look like? Said, "He's thin and he's got a mantle over his shoulders." &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's Samuel. Bring him in this room. Bring him here before me." And watch when Samuel come before Saul, he said, "Why did you call me seeing you become an enemy to God?" And watch, not only was he still Samuel, he still maintained the spirit of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say it's wrong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let anyone say it's wrong. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. He was still a prophet for he said he prophesied and said the battle's going against you tomorrow and you and your sons will fall in battle tomorrow and but this time tomorrow night you'll be with me. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; He was still a prophet. &gt;&gt; Now you say, "Oh, but that was a witch did that." All right. I'll tell you when it wasn't a witch. Jesus took Peter or James and John and went up the mount transfiguration one time and was standing up on top of the mountain and Jesus God was placing his son like I'm trying to had the other night placing son and when they did they looked around and found out that there stood Moses and Elijah &gt;&gt; they were talking communing not little white flags floating around or little white clouds rather floating around but they were Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking Moses had been buried in an unmarked grave for 800 years. &gt;&gt; And Elijah had went home in a chariot 500 years. And here they both was still just as much alive as they ever was alive, standing there talking to him before he went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. sealed until the day of our redemption. How many can say praise the Lord? Moses 800 years. Elijah 500 years. Brother, I'm only 60 years. Still a prophet, still alive. That's in the Bible. And when they come back, not if they come back, when they come back, they'll still be a prophet. And they maintain the spirit of prophecy. Amen. Is that what we heard tonight? Praise the Lord. Thank God. We have a few prayer requests here tonight. Please remember my nephew um let me see yeah Jonathan Wartz he's has some serious health issues and also brother Paul Batazi has a serious operation next Monday. Amen. Keep those in prayer. Remember my wife uh she had a little surgery with the dentist the other day and She has to finish that up tomorrow. So to pray the Lord will touch her. Um this coming Sunday night, Brother Robert Figareroa will be preaching for us. Be in prayer for that. Amen. And so is there anyone else that has a request here tonight like to make known? Yes. Yes.
