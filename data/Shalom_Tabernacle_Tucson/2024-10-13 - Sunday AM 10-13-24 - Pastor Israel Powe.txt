great men back in there how they sacrificed you'll see how little you've done makes me feel ashamed of myself sometimes how we have to have everything so easy and they had everything so hard wandered about Paul said in Hebrews 11 and sheep skins and goat skins tormented and Afflicted destitutes what will our testimony stand upside of theirs how will it be up the S side of that we have to have everything so nice now just in respects before we open the book I'd like for us all who can just stand for a moment for prayer now with the sincerity of your heart breathe a word of prayer for to God Lord God the creator of heavens and earth the author of everlasting life and The Giver of all good and perfect gifts we would ask you Lord first to forgive us of all of our indifferences and our sins and our trespasses against thee and against one another in our fellow man may this little time of coming together not only be for the edifying of our own Souls but may it be to Enlighten Us in such a way and Inspire us to we'll go tell others may it be a time of rededication uniting with the full body of Christ and being ready for the Rapture father God not by my own feelings knowing that thy servant and all other servants are insufficient for this great task realizing how great man gone by has hook up on their hearts to try to reveal this or to comment upon the great Revelation then we realize that we're more than they are insufficient but Thou Art our sufficiency I pray heavenly father that you will do something special during this time that the holy spirit will have pretence in their heart yes circumcise the lips that speak in the ears that hear and when this is all over and we dedicated to you may we walk from under the threshold of this house saying it was good for us to

women to take a Hal newly may you raise up speakers with tongues interpreter of Tong may you raise up gifts of Prophecy raise up preachers pastors evangelists so forth that the church might be edified

the End of the Age the consummation is near Hallelujah Grant these things father and above all things Lord at this time help thou me the needy one for I asked it as I commit myself to thee for these services in Jesus Christ's name amen fore [Music] [Music] to me my people let your ears be open to the moving of the spirit of God let your heart be understanding because I'm going to speak to you my people by this the prophet he's going to bring out of the depth of this my word things it's going to amaz your understanding he's going to open to you many things never understand excepted andal you your might to the prophet same the things to our to your attention that desire you he this is the warning this is the last time words are going to be said to many people's hearts this is a time that our understanding must be made fruitful so speak through our prophet and our hearts that have understanding let us gather close that we miss something that is two PR Mighty God who raised up Jesus from the dead Hallelujah we are so glad to know that your spirit dwells among us hallelujah always is he true and never a word of untruth and now father confirm further Thy word as we read For Your Glory and may ever heart as you have said said be prepared and ready for there will come forth something maybe the people will receive their last warning to turn from the things that they now do unto the way of right we thank thee holy God in the name of thy son the Lord Jesus amen amen turning now to the book of the revelation first chapter now the first I want to read the first three verses of Revelations the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel un to his servant John who bear a record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and to all of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand as I said before now in this we're going to try to give a little breakdown now of the book according to the histories and so forth and each time when you see me referring to pages that I have written here it's stuff that I have taken from commentaries and so forth now the writer of this book is John St John the Divine wrote to the future generation a be directed to the seven angels of the seven distinct periods of the Christian age a age from the days of the Apostles to the coming of the Lord and the Now the ages appear in succession each one from the Ascension of Our Lord to his coming again each Church age is the described of its spiritual condition e each Church age can behold Itself by its scriptural and spiritual speaking unto them as the spirit speaks each age can behold itself each age bore the True Vine of Christ the wise virgin and each age bore the grafted Vine the foolish version historians agree this is John's Life John lived the last of his years in the city of Ephesus and died there he was on the aisle of patmas at the time he wrote the book Revelation it was not the story of his life but the story of Christ in future ages the was a pro prophecy not the life of John not the life of Christ but prophesying of an age to come it was not his prophetic utterances but the Lord exaltation solemnly it was not the revelation of of St John the Divine but the revelation of Christ the Lord it is the last book of the New Testament yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dation of the Gospel go Bible scholars agreed the letters to the seven Church Ages were written prophetically to the Future ages Paul wrote of the life and glory of the seven churches present in his days John wrote of the life and glory of the seven churches in the future that John was addressing the seven pastors or Messengers as direct all Christians under these seven different angels now the Book of Revelations now we're going to take as we break this down for this morning and this evening and we'll try to let out about 11:00 and 11:30 something like that and then begin again tonight at 7 now the contents of this first chapter the first verse it it really speaks for itself because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ second verse St John the Divine is the Scribe and servant third verse the blessings pronounced the fourth to the sixth verse the salute to the church the seventh verse the announcement the eighth verse the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ the 9th to the 20 verse the patmas vision and all also the 14th and 15th verses describes his Sevenfold Glory of his person oh it's beautiful when we see Christ and his Sevenfold personages of his Sevenfold beings of his personages in his glorious Resurrection now the title describes the character the revelation of Jesus Christ not the revelation of St John the Divine but the revelation of Jesus Christ the son of God now the Greek word for Revelation is the apocalyps which means the unfolding and I was taking that word and searching it it means the apocalypsis is to like a sculpture has made a great statue and he's got it covered by a veil and then he he goes and tears back this Veil and reveals what he has behind the veil it's an uncovering and this book is not the uncovering of so much the person of Jesus Christ yet it certainly speaks of his deity and his Sevenfold personage and also of the things that he is like priest king and so forth but it is the revealing of the future of his works in the seven Church ages that's coming on it's when our Lord was on Earth the disciples asked him and said Master will you at this time uh restore the kingdom back to Israel and Jesus said it's not for you to know this hour or time and no one would know said even the son as yet did not know but after his death burial and resurrection and Ascension in the glory he received from God the future of the church then he returned back to bring this message to the church and this message of his coming and the condition of his churches down through the AG he could not do it before his death burial and Resurrection because he had not yet knew it but did you notice how the scripture reads here uh the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him Christ how that God the Father gave the Revelation to his son Jesus Christ and he sent his Angel to John to signify these things which was which was which is and which shall be oh it's set beautifully now in this great uh coming age that John saw now these um this Revelation was given to him strictly to unveil the specific purpose of Christ what he would be and be like in every age that's the reason I said this morning keep your mind on the True Church the true church begin on the day of Pentecost there's no Theologian Bible scholar or historian can ever say that it began in the days of Mart Luther Wesley Catholic age or any other age it begin at Pentecost that was the inauguration of the church that was the beginning so therefore in a discussion with anybody stand at that gate of Pentecost and they cannot go nowhere else just like putting a rabbit in a field you know wherever a hole is so you got to stopped up he'll have to come right back to this same place where you come in at well that's why anyone talking about churches and church ages and works of the Holy Spirit you'll have to come back to the original beginning it's got to come back to there because God is in infite and he's omnipotent therefore him being infinite he cannot do something here and do something contrary to it over here he's got to do each time like he did it the first time like Peter said on the day of when the Gentiles received the Holy Spirit he said can we forbid water seeing that they have received the Holy Ghost like we did at the beginning Jesus when he was on Earth spoke and said it someone come and said is it lawful for us put a we wise for any cause Jesus said uh he that made male made female for this cause a Manel he said but Moses suffered us a writing of divorce and Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning go back to the beginning therefore if we go talk on the church age we've got to go back to the beginning lay aside every statement that any man has made down to the age this is the most official book of any book in the Bible this is the only book that Christ put his seal upon it starts off with the blessing and ends with a curse blessing is he that readeth and curseth is he that takes anything out of it it's the only book that Christ wrote himself of the whole Bible The Ten Commandments he wrote with his fingers that's right Jews held on to that and today it's the the Revelation and if Satan hates any book in the Bible it's a revelation these two he hates all scripture and it's the whole Cannon of scripture but if anything he despises mostly is Revelations and Genesis because Genesis tells the beginning Revelation reveals what's going to happen to him in the last days going to be bound a thousand years than him and the false prophet the Beast is going to be thrown alive into the Lake of Fire and he'll attack the Book of Genesis upon it it's uh uh being authentic he'll say that it isn't authentic he'll stir the minds of people watch where the devil lays that book of Genesis or the Book of Revelations the first and the last and the Book of Revelations e under [Music] [Music] power [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] beautiful beautiful Maring upward Zion that beautiful city of God yes where marching to Zion beautiful beautiful Zion we're marching upward to Zion that beautiful city of god let's stand together this morning amen as David said I was glad when they said to me let's go into the house of the the Lord and we'll enter his gates with Thanksgiving in our heart enter his courts with praise and so if we all came with that mindset this morning then I'm not up here to try to get you in the right frame of mind we're already in the right frame of mind and amen I'm so excited what God has in store for us today brother Joel Jensen would you come open our service with a word of prayer this morning we just want to let their lord have preeminence from the get go till till the last chorus and we're dismissed today bless you let's bow our heads father I like what he said we want you to have the preeminence yes amen Lord like Solomon when he dedicated the temple and the oh that the shic glory would come and Lord the song leader or the minister couldn't even Minister because your shik glory would just come in this place Hallelujah Lord we hunger thank we thirst for more of you amen Lord we welcome your presence and I like what your Prophet said he said Jesus comes where he is welcome Lord we welcome you this morning Lord I know there's people here that I'm sure I could say 100% we need more of you we need a touch from Heaven Lord I hope there's no one in this church this morning that's satisfied because sometimes that satisfaction can be such a curse that was LE oia but Lord we realize that as long as a man or a woman hungers and thirsts for righteousness as you promised am they will be filled and [Music] so oh Jesus we love you this morning we just ask that you'd be here in the song service and anoint brother Israel in a special way this

for we ask your blessings now in Jesus name amen amen can I have some more on this monitor here amen how's everyone doing this morning glad to be in the house of the Lord good to see you Armando and Angel there and each of you all the visitors always brother Kurt and the Saints of the most high God Amen God bless you we like to go right into the word of the Lord uh this morning Ephesians chapter 6 we had a wonderful time there's a men's ministers meeting that they opened it up to all the brothers on Saturday there in Phoenix so we were able to go there and um dealing with bitterness and it was very good I'd say um brother Joe and brother uh um George was there and Levi myself and some of the other brothers Brother Art there in Phoenix Kurt was there and it was just really nice amen dealing with the root of bitterness and how things happen God allows it or God did it himself but there's nothing that can happen to you that God did not know because he knows all things so if it happened or is happening he allowed it or he did it himself and as a believer that helps places you in your mind how to approach things that are going on in your life amen and so we'd like to maybe talk a little bit on this great Weaponry that God has given us here in Ephesians chapter 6 in verse number 10 the scripture starts there finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil so he's preparing you that you got to be able to stand against him for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places we'll take one more scripture I think it's in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 quickly and then we'll come back to Ephesians verse number three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not what carnal But Mighty through God Amen to the pulling down of what strongholds strongholds strongholds this is a Battleground casting down imaginations and every High thing that does what that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity which thoughts every single thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled let's turn back to Ephesians 6 one more time verse 13 says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore amen may God add a blessing to the reading of his word let us pray if you have a need in your heart in your life right now I why don't you just think about it just for a moment what you need where you are and whatever that need is slip up your hand to him as we go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus you see those hands and the hearts and the needs behind the hand and father I just pray that you'll take full control of the service it is not my people it's your people it's not my church it's your church you brought them here none of us are responsible for bringing anybody here it's your responsibility Lord to care for your children and we believe that you're going to do that this morning we believe that you've given to us everything that we have need of and may you grant this blessing we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you may be seated let me start off by saying this right from the get-go the devil is real and he's a real enemy that is after the elected and the true child of God and what happens is he tries to muddy the waters in your life and in your thinking so you can start thinking well you're thinking this thought or this is you and you need to fight this battle I'm just a little weary today I'm feeling like things aren't flowing today um I wanted to do good but I'm not doing good um my bad I'm just no what that is is there's a real devil and anytime you go to do what's right or you hear what is right the enemy is there to hinder you and to stop you and if we would realize that Satan is real and if we can see his personage and know his origin his foundation where he's from the wisdom that he contains his ability to tempt his ability to persuade not just one or two people I'm talking about sanctified people even prophets even God's people he was able to get into their head get into their mind and cause them to do things and say things that were contrary so here the Bible is giving us a clear warning about the evil WS of the devil number one and number two the evil day that you and I would live in this is that day a day of lawlessness it's unfettered the the amount of wickedness that is taking place today the people don't care they'll abuse an old person a crippled person person a person who don't know no better and they just for no reason they'll go through and and they will they will shoot they will they'll punch a man or old man or old woman and video it and put it online and some of you all will look at it and some people will laugh at it and think it's funny but what is that Satan has poured out his anointing upon people and that anointing isn't just on the the the homie on the streets or the prostitute the drug dealer no it comes upon preachers pastors song leaders teachers people who's trying to follow the word because he has a goal and that is to influence and to get you to do what he wants to accomplish this is very clear instructions the Apostle Paul says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord how can you be strong in the lord well he tells you how to do it he says to put on the whole armor of God how many know what the armor of God is it's the helmet of salvation the Blessed breastplate of righteousness the belt of Truth The Shield of Faith the sword of the word the boots to cover you with peace the righteousness of the Gospel the Peace of the Gospel so the whole man is covered with salvation with righteousness his head is covered his breast is covered he has a shield of Faith he has a sword his Weaponry that's really the only weapon he has is his sword he has a girdle that goes around his waist his truth then he's got on his boots to cover his feet the Bible tells us to put on the whole armor of God six armors there I'm going to add a seventh armor and it's right there in the word it's Verse 18 I like to work with the numbers as the prophet told us and these SE are six armors but let's take a seventh one in verse 18 says praying always with all prayer and supplication we know the prophet told us that prayer is the greatest weapon that was ever placed in the hand of a man now you want something you want an angel to appear to you some Supernatural star like Superman in the movies or Hollywood and some magic wand to come over your head to make you change your mind you got to change your mind based on what God has given you and the Lord deals with each man and each Woman by their conscience we've been talking about this whole man that your see taste feel smell and hear that makes up your outer being and then conscience memory reasons affections and imaginations that's the Inner Man and the word of God was sent to heal the whole man not just the outside of you but the inside of you and Satan has come to steal to kill and destroy and this is where this is where we are uh um this morning I want to bring you a picture I know I won't be able to get entirely through this message sis in the back I apologize I didn't give you any quotes but you you've done it before so I have several scriptures if I don't get to the quot all of the quotations there are um we we brought that the seven compound names of redemption Jehovah Gyra Jehovah shama Jehovah Shalom how many remember that the prophet of God brings that to us and I brought it to the church this you know the you know the seven compound confessions that you can make you make that confession that he's your healer he's your peace he's your Shepherd he's your righteousness and you take those seven Stripes of blood the Seven Virtues in second Peter chapter 1 and you take the Seven Ages the Seven Seals All these numbers these sevens that God has given to the believer to protect him by and here in Ephesians speaks to us about this um the Warfare that we're in and that the battle ground that we're in now if we could see it we'll know that every evil thought and any bad mood bad agenda comes from somewhere and we all get anointed with the evil thinking the evilness that Satan will come in here you say I'm having a bad day well who gave you a bad day was it God was it the Holy Spirit who is trying to keep you from praying who determines whether this service breaks through under the anointing or not and let to show you in the scripture that this being called Satan he's not a new guy he's not a new character and he's not somebody to play with and we joke about it sometimes the devil made me do it um the devil ain't no joke and he's not a being that we should take lightly and play with the Bible says that we are not ignorant of his devices that's why we forgive our brothers and we know how to forgive because L Satan would place a trap upon us we're not ignorant of his devices he is a mastermind and you think the greatest Theologian uh uh that would make you feel um inferior just on the intellectual level that's nothing compared to Satan's ability and his wisdom and the power to influence Nations and large group of people even people who were called of God prophets even Kings even were influenced by him and so he's not nothing to play with let's take a scripture here the Old Testament deals with him in Ezekiel chapter 28 and the prophet Ezekiel 28:12 says son of man take up Lamentations upon the king of Tyrus and say unto him thus sayith the Lord God thou Sealth up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty he's talking about this devil now thou has has been in Eden the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering the Sardis the topass the Diamond the barrel the ax The Jasper the sapphire the emerald the Carbonic and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day thou was created Thou Art the anointed Cher that coverest and I have set thee so thou was upon the holy mountain of God thou walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire that was perfect you were perfect in in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the thy multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou H has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God and I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up thine heart his heart was lifted up because of what his Beauty he was telling ented he was handsome he was attractive he had a talent he had gifts and that's what lifted him up in Pride you think you start doing a little bit better you know you know when you don't have nothing you know how to pray when you broke you know how to pray when you're in trouble you know how to pray but as soon as God begins to bless you bless your ministry bless your church you don't have to help me preach it's okay I'm going to lay this word out here to do soon as God begins to bless any man any woman gifted talented can sing Satan is there to lift them up in Pride so that they can think it's them now my gift my talent my Ministry you're on your road out if you don't stay at the altar and keep that gift before the God who gave you life amen amen yes Satan came to church this morning he's at every Gathering yes he comes to take part in the service he don't want you to enter in he wants you to get up and go get a drink of water he wants you to think about work tomorrow he don't want you to catch a revelation of what the Holy Ghost is trying to do in your life amen amen somebody iniquity was found in his heart he was lifted up Ezekiel 2812 in the NIV talks about gives some more descriptions in there the ESV and some other translations there um talks about this beauty and how he was expelled he was a guardian cherub he was in charge of other angels He had a position he had the ability that God had except he couldn't create the prophet told us can I get a witness amen and he fell because of this position he he lost his first estate and any man I don't care who you are when something that you've never had before now is in your hands it's a Temptation now if you you know we at 10,000 and now you get 50,000 there's another test comes with that you win the lottery another test comes with that you start a business and God starts to bless it a test comes with that you start preaching the word and the Lord begins to bless you a test comes with that you start a little church you have four or five families and more families come a test comes with that and there is a place that the believer must stay and must know that there is a real devil that actually will come to you in your studying while you're studying the word to sway you into a Direction so he can influence the entire group of people that you're preaching to but I'm so glad there's a message of the hour that I can hear that's pure that's clean that is my example that will keep me on the firing line keep my mind focused where it needs to be not over fame not over popularity but staying with the word god amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen the scriptures go on in Isaiah I'm just going to show him paint this picture of this being just for a moment Isaiah 14:12 says how thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are th cut down to the ground which did weaken and na let me stop here just for a moment you know every time I go to witness Satan always gets upset it's like like if I could preach to you all for a week and you know I have my everyday battles but soon as I make the effort to go tell somebody who's never heard before Satan's on the track all the time I've noticed that it's not bad luck it's the devil he wants me to confine my little time my little Ministry to preaching to Y all all day preaching to the choir but to go tell the man on the street who never heard to leave from 21102 East Broadway and go tell somebody downtown that Jesus can save them and deliver them oh it moves our comfort zone CU we don't that's that's another level it's like we don't know what's going to happen they're going to reject us it's not going to like us they already don't like you so get over it amen Isaiah 14:12 says how art thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee so narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of the prisoners and all the kings of the Nations even all of them lie in glory e everyone in his own house but thou are cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as a reignment of those that are slain so the Bible is just giving some descriptions of this being Lucifer or Satan you call him the Devil he's known as the tempter he has many he's an accuser and he has many devices and power so this is prophetic These Old Testament prophets are catching in the spirit one is talking to a King and brother bandam says this King was not in Eden but he was talking about the spirit in this King was the spirit of Satan and when and when when the prophet saw him he says Thou Sealth up the sum of wisdom you were in Eden the Garden of God identifying that spirit and we'll see how he moves just a little bit in 1 Chronicles 21 God's Own handpick King King David the Bible says in verse number one and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number the people to number Israel who did that who tempted him to do that uhhuh job 1 and6 says this there was today when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and who was there too huh say all that's right I ask you guys not to help me preach that's okay there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among Satan what you comeing to church for huh why are you coming when the sons are coming he's got something in his plan something on his heart something in his scheme Satan's chance for Redemption is over Satan is not interested in hearing the word of the Lord Satan don't care one bit about what quote you just read or what's in your Bible that you highlighted all he's concerned about is trying to get you to stumble to fall to hinder you and we got to know he's these devices is that he has Psalms 1096 says set thou a wicked man over him and let Satan St Satan stand at his right hand Zechariah 3 1-2 look at this he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the Lord said unto Satan the Lord rebuke theee hallelujah oh Satan even the Lord that have chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee is no it's not it's not me I rebuke you Satan it's the Lord rebuke you even over the body of Moses Satan didn't bring a railing accusation but he just said the Lord rebuke you you think you got power to go toe to- Toe with the devil joke about him talk to him in his face you have no power except God give you the power that's why you got to stay with the word because the word has the authority over every evil power outside of the word you have no power you will fall you will lust you will commit the thing that you said you would never do if you walk out from beside that word greater Ministries than you failed greater men than you failed men that it all failed how did they fall Satan came to them gave them a proposition worked on them worked on them worked on them worked on them and then they cracked soon as a little crack happens work on it work on it he's got time he'll wait for you he's following you and studying everything that you do waiting for an opportunity to slip his fangs into you yes I'm talking to church church people this morning I'm looking around who who the brother preaching I'm preaching about everybody here Satan is an enemy to every one of us here and if I fail to pray and keep this armor on me I will fall the church will fail your ministry will fail your abilities will fail Glory if we don't take on the whole armor of God J amen yes look how he came in Matthew 16 it's also found in Mark chapter 8:33 can I take 20 more minutes the Bible says from that time forth Jesus began Jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and of Chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day and look at this look at his faithful servant Peter handpicked then Peter took him and begin to do what to him you got the nerve to rebuke your pastor I mean rebuke rebuke the Lord Jesus huh he rebuked him and look what he says and begin to rebuke him saying be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art an offense unto me for thou savest not the things that be of God but those that be of men now if you follow Peter in his life Peter was an anointed brother he's kind of quick on the trigger he's cutting folks ears off for the Lord he could get in a fight he'll scrap with you no problem he was the disciple he had his temperament and the Lord loved Peter and the Lord called Peter and when it was time for the church to get a revelation he used Peter to get a revelation that thou art the Christ the son of the Living God says where could we go we wouldn't go nowhere and in a few moments later he's now rebuking the Lord and Jesus turned and looked at him and says Satan I rebuke you now this kind of shows this nature he said Satan get thee behind me thou art an offense to me brother bner shows us that he loved the Apostle but now the spirit that was on the Apostle it was Satan using him see how quickly he just ease right into there and cause him to say things that was contrary take another one here Mark chap 3: 23 says and he called unto him and said unto them in Parables how can Satan cast out Satan and if the kingdom be divided against itself that Kingdom cannot stand and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand and if Satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but ha an end showing a little more insight into Satan's schemes his abilities he's got a he's got a program he's got hierarchy he's got Angels he's got demons he got people that work for him there's people that are literally on his side and he uses them and he'll get those people to get attached with you and you start getting mad at people mad at because he you know I know why he don't like me you know it's Satan that's after you my brother my sister this is not flesh and blood this is Satan trying to destroy you destroy your influence destroy your your your your your future and so Jesus identified this let's take this in Luke chapter 4 this is powerful here Satan comes to Jesus verse one Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost he returned from Jordan and was led by the spirit Into the Wilderness being 40 days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when it ended he afterward hungered and the devil said unto him if thou be the Son of God command this stone that it be made bread Jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and the devil taking him up into a high M high mountain who took him up the devil took him up into a high mountain showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and the devil said unto him look at this all this power will I give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered un to me and to whomsoever I will what I will give this is Satan talking to Jesus Jesus never said that ain't true he listened right to him Sat said I got the power to all the glories of the G all the glory of the Earth all of the kingdoms of the world all of the Power I'll give it to you if you just Bow Down and Worship me for it's been given to me to give it to anybody that I want to I can't think of the great rapper one of them rappers um some of y'all wouldn't know if I called it anyways but he said Satan came to him three times DMX I think you remember that you ever heard that interiew he said Satan he was a gifted and talented man his be ability to recall in rap music now and just on the Fly be able to hold paragraphs and S a whole song by memory and just the ability that he had couldn't God use that in the Pulpit that gift that talent to to retain he said in an own interview he said that Satan came to him and offered gifts and talents to him obviously he was dealing with some spiritual battles there he wrapped about it he asked God to help him he told God to show him a sign and some of his rap music showing that Satan comes to people and he comes to them with gifts and powers and opportunities oh I wish the church was praying this morning I wish the real reality of what we're dealing with it would it would re it would change the way you repent and you come to the house of the Lord it would change your motive and your objectives to the hour that you live in we're all dead men and I'm crying out judgment is coming it's already here and God has a purpose for us and so does Satan want to hinder that purpose so here he is in discourse with Jesus he has the power now to give it to whoever he wants to is that right Saints huh look at Luke chapter 10 the scripture says this verses 1-3 after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two and two before his face in every city and place whether he himself would come therefore said he unto them the Harvest truly is great but the laborers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth what labor laborers into his Harvest go your way behold I send you forth as Lambs as Lambs Among Wolves he that heareth you heareth me he that despiseth you despiseth me he that despiseth me despises him that sent me and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through what not through our church not through our abill ities but even the devils are subject unto us through thy name St Luke chap 10: 1 through3 and verses 16- 20 that they recognize that the devil was subject unto him to them through his name there's no name like that name demons tremble at the sound of that that name and in that name if you can't do it then don't do it at all if you can't do it in Jesus name but when you come in jesus' name pray in jesus' name study and preach in jesus' name there is no devil that can stand before the elected God gave us the power to overcome through his name behold I give you power to tread on serpents scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing should by any means hurt you notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven that's something to be happy about yes oh yes also many other scriptures Luke Chapter 13 Luke 22 uh the disciples are arguing who's going to be next who's going to be in charge next and Jesus deals with that John 1327 Satan enters Into the Heart of of of of of um Judas thank you and he goes and does what he does first he's playing a game with the money CU he was a trustee he worked with Jesus he saw Jesus wasn't a hypocrite he knew Jesus ministry was true but why did Judas betray our Lord and Savior Jesus the only thing that was pure and clean amongst the leadership was Jesus that had the authority Judas saw it all Judas was a part of the ministry what entered into him to cause him to go this way he was woed he was groomed and then finally he made that final step and Satan entered into his heart how does Satan groom you how would he be working on you your next scheme your next whatever you trying to do you know Satan is a mastermind Saints he's not nothing to play with if you're not in this world day and night you know what you just need to stop playing Church stop playing because Satan is watching your halfway lifestyle and the prophet preach it on tape it's in your Bible maybe you come up in Sunday school maybe you was raised in it and still going to go halfway oh God have mercy upon me God have mercy upon us the brother brought some statistics here and I had read them before myself but he was talking about how a person reading the Bible once a week it it it really it's like you didn't nothing it doesn't move anything there's no meaningful change in your life then after you go two two or three times a week it just moves a little bit more that the impact of reading the word of the Lord and then after that you know it's just unlimited the effects that the word of God has upon you just by picking it up and reading it it influences you just like many of you are influenced by Fox News news that's why you can argue politics all the time because that's what you was listening to why don't you put it down and pick up your Bible and read it read it till it makes you cry read it till you feel it in your bones read it until it changes your mind read the word of God daily take one page one chapter and read it it will begin to help you it will yes it will and so we see this Satan has this ability to influence influence David he come in the congregation with job job's going to to meet the Lord the sons of God to go to meet the Lord and Satan is right there with him too 2 Corinthians chapter 2 we read this let's read it one more time verse number nine for the this end also did I write that I may know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also so if you forgive him I forgive him also for if I forgive anything to whom I forgive it for your sakes forgive I it in the person of Christ lest or so that Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices amen you know Satan got some devices let me read this other translation same verse same scripture there maybe it'll help you a little bit anyone you forgive I also forgive and what I have forgiven if there was anything to forgive I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake in order that Satan might not out witht us for we are not aware unaware of his schemes amen it's a mind game Church your mind in the mind of Christ against Satan in his mind you know he's trying to out scheme you so I'm going to go serve the Lord and so I'm goingon to make this commitment I'll start praying on Wednesday night I used to didn't come I'mma start coming now oh Satan's gonna out scheme you like give him another job cause something to go bad in the home you got to do this and do that wrap his time he's trying to out it's a mind game but once you know the word of the Lord that you're supposed to be in the house of the Lord then you know anything that's coming against that is what yeah that's right you fill in the blank all right that Satan might not out witht us for we are not unaware of his devices 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse verse number seven I knew we wasn't going to dance this morning that's all right I knew it wasn't going to be one of those high five run up and down the a but I'm I'm preaching what's on my heart okay what the Lord put on my heart in this great tremendous warning you heard it before I know that and that's probably part of the problem you underestimate his power and I'm going to get into those quotes in just a minute [Music] if if Satan can get a hold of a leader oh how many people he can damage brother George if he can influence the mind of a leader a gift or a Talent somebody that can speak somebody that's connected oh what kind of damage can he do and this is why we are not ignorant of his devices 2 Corinthians chapter 12 says this unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of who of Satan to do what to Buffet me Les I should be exalted above measure interesting scripture isn't it think of that the Lord blessed me so well that he had to let Satan send a messenger to keep me humble Paul wasn't an overnight believer Paul gave his life for this go the greatest one we've ever seen and God used him he raised the dead amongst him cast out Devils with him used him mightily and gave him some Revelations to tie in the Old Testament law and bring it under grace and truth into where we can clearly see even the Lord's Supper even all the mysteries of the Old Testament and even him he needed some kind of pain some kind of situation some kind of pressure to keep him humble and God allowed Satan to Buffet him is that your Bible yes he sought the Lord three times for the Lord to take it away the Lord said no my grace is sufficient for you Paul sa so we see this we also 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verses number five it talks about when the um the the a Believer goes off the rails and won't be corrected that you deliver such a one over to Satan that's what the Bible says deliver such a one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that his Spirit might be saved in the day of Jesus that's what the Bible says all right can I take one more 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 for those of you that need to get up and get a drink of water we're going to start issuing cups of water at your seat no we're not now y'all don't look at me that way right God bless you now I know somebody really needed a drink if you need a drink go get it so don't first Thessalonians chapter 2 I want to get the scripture to you verse number 16 18 forbidding us to speak unto the Gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sin always for the Wrath has come upon them to the uttermost but we Brethren being taken from you for a short time in in in presence not in heart endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire wherefore we would have come unto you you even I Paul once and again but Satan hindered us you know Satan has that ability to hinder the thing that you're trying to do that is good and you got to know that it's not just circumstance if you're trying to do something and it's related to the word of God and it's commissioning his word in the furtherment of his word and something is hindering that who is going to hinder the furtherment of the word you got to know that you think it's just coincidence you think I'm just in a bad mood a bad mood is a bad spirit that makes you feel that way and we all get it on us get aggravated get anointed and it gets on us get on us so we can say something that we shouldn't say blow up at someone do something that we normally wouldn't do who orchestrates all that my goodness Satan's a liar we looking at Brothers we looking at sisters it's Satan he's got a trap set for you yes he does he knows you better than your mama knows you better than your wife or your husband know he knows you probably better than you know yourself in many respects he holds the sum of wisdom he knows what a human being wants desires capable of weaknesses when he's tired he thinks like this when he's around the believer he thinks like this I know I can catch him on a Monday don't mess with him on Sunday but on Monday go see him that's Satan that's a mastermind go heads up with you on the while the Altar and the fire of God is going on he go get you after the service after you done made up your mind to do what's right he's after you that's the word of the Lord Saints we got to know that stop getting mad at people I'm going to take the next 10 or 15 minutes and deal with this just for a minute now this Ephesians six tells us to be what in the Lord strong strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and he tells us to put on the whole armor of God he tells us that twice to put the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day when is the evil day that's this day that's this last day second Timothy chapter 3 talks about this saying this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boers proud blasphemers he say lovers of money proud arrogant abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful Unholy heartless one definition unpas slanderous without self-control brutal not love loving good just don't love anything that's good treacherous Reckless swollen with conceit just filled with conceit conceited through the music through the culture through the age that they're in the drug whatever the situation lovers of Pleasures rather than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away for this is the the sword are they that which creep into houses and Lead captive silly women Laden with sins laid away with diverse lust ever learning never able to come to the knowledge of the truth never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now in Romans chapter one I want you to turn there quickly talks about this evil day and I want to deal with this verse 27 28 and 29 just for a minute and then share a few quotations with you how you should never underestimate Satan's power to deceive you or to influence you or to get you to think in a certain way you can you can't over you can't over underestimate it Romans 8 vers 18 verse verse number 208 says this says Romans sorry Romans chapter 1 verse number 28 it says this and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness now we're commanded to be filled with the Holy Ghost and just follow me just a little bit I want you appreciate how you're doing that sis in the back just follow it down I'm going to read uh a few definitions out of this furthermore they did not retain uh the knowledge of God so God gave them over to a depraved mind so that they do what uh that they do what ought not to be done they have been become filled with every kind of wickedness evil greed depravity they're full of Envy murder Strife deceit and Malice slanderous God haters arrogant boastful they invent ways of doing evil they disobey their parents they have no understanding no Fidelity No Love No Mercy although they know God's righteous decree that those who do these things deserve death not only do they the same but have pleasure and them that do them so this is talking about that evil day that evil day is here this is where this is where this is what you run into and on streets this is what serving your food in the restaurant this is when you're going to do any kind of service in public this is what's driving around in traffic God gave them over to a reprobate mind and this is the evil day that the scriptures talk of but it tells us to Stand Fast put on the whole armor of God what is the whole armor of God Saints it's the word of God it's all of it it's the helmet of salvation it's the breastplate of righteousness Ephesians chapter 6 it's the belt of truth it's the shield he says above all take The Shield of Faith that's your Shield to quench all the fiery darts of the devil you mean the devil's throwing darts at us yes he's in some of you all's car waiting for you to get back in it yes yes he is that real he is after you to take away whatever word whatever anoint in whatever good God try to instill in you Satan is there to throw a fiery Dart this is why you got to have the whole armor of God got to have all of it it's not something you do on the side this is not a part-time position this is a soldier in the army of the Lord he wake up 2 o'clock in the morning and the devil is after him already up and you trying to do what's right and he's after you but the lord gave us the equipment didn't he he says put on the whole armor of God put it on how do you put it on you put each piece on in prayer prayerfully Hallelujah put the helmet of salvation on prayerfully you pick up the sword of the spirit prayerfully you take this weaponry and you dress yourself for a true child of God ready for the battle because the your enemy The Devil is after you sis after your brother but greater is he that is in us huh than he that is in the world now what did he give us his armor for so we're constantly defending oursel you know the you know in football say the greatest defense is a tremendous offense it's the ability to fight and and brother Caleb in one of the ministers meeting he he gave this uh five-fold Ministry and he talked about how brother brandom had it shared with brother Perry green what the each finger was he said this pointer was the I think the Apostle or no maybe it's this one here I'm GNA mess it up now but each of these are something this is the Evangelist here um this pointer was the prophet this one right here this ring this the longest one is the Apostle it goes first and this is the teacher here the ring finger and then you close it up it is wrapped together with the thumb which is the pastor that holds it all together and he says and then you use that to hit the devil and if you're really skilled you can give him a double portion and then one brother said this is where the scripture applies this better to give than to receive yeah it's better to give than to [Music] receive and so when we're in the army of the Lord we're not just running from the devil cuz we're in the evil day no he called you so you can stand and Fight Like a Man on running all the time brother can you pray for me brother can you help me man pray for your s get on your knees get the victory that God gave you and go and take the devil apply the token in your life God called you to be a soldier holding nobody's hand around here the devil's chasing me chasing you and I'm in the Battleground to fight and I must fight if I will reain increase my courage Lord give me the anointing to fight in this battle Yeah said brother isra I need to move out of this complex cuz there's too many Devils here why don't you go cast some devils out but we should build a church in a nice clean neighborhood where ain't no problems in it no the neighborhood that got the problems that's the one that need a church they need you in that neighborhood and the frowns go down I I see you I see your face let's go witness to the Saints out there oh I think I just smashed my glasses look at that I might as well smash the other one right let me see that ain't nobody mad but the devil yes you know Satan will come after you but greater is he that is in you than he is in the world who's who's stronger who's strong who got more power God or the devil because Jesus Christ gave you the victory man he gave you the power over sin he gave you the power over the demons that had you bound but I'm so glad that Jesus Set Me Free he set me free so I can be a witness to somebody tell them the truth hallelujah Hey Brother let's go witness on the street what time is it well at 1:00 it's too hot at 1 it's too hot we don't go out street well there's people walking up and down the streets at 1:00 can't you be out there preaching to them at 1:00 we need the perfect temperature the perfect atmosphere now I realize everybody can't go but everybody should be praying for somebody else to go and that is the truth cuz we don't wrestle against Prin principalities and Powers we wrestle against the rulers of Darkness the rulers of darkness and so you need this equipment to be able to stand and that is the word of God we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but we wrestle against principalities and power let me take two quotes for you I'm sorry I ran out of my time here but in the message 1962 paragraph number 40 uh uh take on the whole armor of God paragraph number 40 July 1 1962 the prophet of God says this here they're definitely going to have to help me with this thank you let's read now the scripture 6th chapter verse 10 verse finally Brethren be strong in the Lord and power of His might quoted on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God skip down just a little bit the army of the United States did receive me because I suppose there were men more eligible but I'm glad that I got enlisted in the army of the Lord and he gave me a uniform Paul is speaking is talking about preparing a soldier for battle the gospel has many lessons you can like it onto one thing or another and Paul speaks of it as a runner Hebrews 12 seeing that we're compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin thus easily beset us he's speaking there of Olympics perhaps the Roman circuits and so now he's speaking of armored men going into battle and how he's got to prepare himself and I was thinking this afternoon being that we're closing out here in the Armory today that I would take for text to take on the whole armor of God be equipped be ready because we wrestle so not against flesh and blood but against Satan God's enemy principalities and wickedness and evil spirits wickedness in high places and we're pressing towards the mark of the high calling and we are certainly in a battle amen we're certainly in the battle let's take one more in in the message the contest paragraph number 15 1962 December the 3D 1962 paragraph number 15 the prophet of God says this here oh my I find here quickly the contest paragraph number 15 now the enemy is going to study the our strategy with the word and now Satan studied that all out so perfectly till will he come till when he comes come to Eve he had the best strategy he could use upon her and that was to reason with the word now you never want to reason with God's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out now you cannot figure out God so God is the word and it's just made to believe and that's our strength just accept the word and anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind and we just take the word amen I got to take one more 1963 this will be my last one paragraph 121 1963 January 14th this is the message trumpet gives an uncertain sound paragraph 121 now the enemy spy Satan triy to find out what could he do to break into that so he knowed he just couldn't come out and Bluff her so the only thing that he could do was to get her on reasoning and that's what God uses today to fortify his church is his word and Satan comes around with reasoning power Satan knowed that was the loophole that was the place that people would break the easiest was at reasoning now you see how that whole man he's got to have all of those channels filtered and cleaned out through the word of God God's word has a power and has everything you need to overcome in such a wicked and dark hour without his word you're going to fall you'll be caught up you'll be in some foolishness and nonsense for hours and years
