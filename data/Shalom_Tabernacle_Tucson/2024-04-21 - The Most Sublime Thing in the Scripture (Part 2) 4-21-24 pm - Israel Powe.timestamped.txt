[32:19] greetings from our Pastor
[32:22] Dan um he says I should pass greetings
[32:26] to the Saints
[32:28] and it's just wonderful to be at Shalom
[32:31] Tabernacle since the pastor introduced
[32:34] me to this church I just feel that uh
[32:37] always a blessing and the atmosphere and
[32:41] the ministry I haven't agree that the
[32:44] pastor since the beginning of the year I
[32:47] prayed for the job and the lord gave me
[32:51] the job then that job took time for
[32:56] worship so at the Tabernacle they missed
[33:00] me for about three months I wasn't be
[33:03] able to be in service when it's the
[33:05] Sundays when is the Sundays then I said
[33:08] is it the Lord who gave me the job so
[33:11] you start wondering a little bit but
[33:14] here I am and um I texted the pastor
[33:18] because um today we don't have a service
[33:20] at our church and um we had a very
[33:23] wonderful time in the morning we had a
[33:26] visiting minister and the pastor says we
[33:28] are not going to have a service in the
[33:30] evening and right there I said I am
[33:32] going to Shalom tabernac tonight so
[33:35] after the
[33:37] service um I text the Pastor said pastor
[33:41] I'm going to the church that you
[33:42] introduce me to said go and greet them
[33:46] so I text the pastor say Pastor can I
[33:48] sing a song he didn't
[33:51] reply so I came from the service I took
[33:54] the song book because uh there was a
[33:57] song that wanted to sing which is in
[33:59] here so I went with it at home then he
[34:02] didn't reply so after my lunch again I
[34:05] text I said he didn't reply so I said
[34:08] okay so I'll go
[34:10] quietly and then I won't go with a song
[34:13] book I just go quietly so I sat there
[34:17] the brother follows me says brother
[34:18] Jonathan you are singing for us tonight
[34:20] say oh my
[34:22] goodness so the pastor CAU my mystery so
[34:26] we are very grateful to the Lord the
[34:28] song that I want to sing is not a new
[34:31] song and is not a special just a song
[34:34] that blessed me so much to today at the
[34:36] service at the church we we sang this
[34:39] song and I've been singing this song
[34:41] throughout the week is a song
[34:45] that this
[34:47] man lost a
[34:50] family that's how the inspiration Came
[34:52] Upon him he you have read about the
[34:57] tanic that
[34:58] ship and um it
[35:02] sunk and um his
[35:05] family perished in that
[35:08] ship and U the inspiration struck
[35:12] him and instead of
[35:15] crying and instead of complaining to God
[35:19] and instead of worry the inspiration
[35:22] came and he wrote this song which has
[35:25] been a generation song now
[35:28] It Is
[35:29] Well with My
[35:31] Soul there's a Bible story where this
[35:36] lady was prayed for by the
[35:39] prophet and the baby was born and that
[35:42] child grew and then he
[35:44] died and then this lady she runs to the
[35:49] prophet and uh the prophet is trying to
[35:52] wonder what could be the problem he says
[35:55] is there a problem and she says all is
[35:58] well but there is a cop at home a dead
[36:02] baby so there are so many lessons that
[36:05] the song teaches to us and uh as
[36:09] Believers as children of God we are
[36:12] always going through life
[36:14] turbulences each and everyone has got
[36:16] this portion this one is a sickness this

[36:29] that I have folks from the Tabernacle
[36:31] The Hope and Brother David so we didn't
[36:34] we didn't we didn't say let's go it was
[36:37] just personal inspiration and then we

[48:14] like to welcome our friends from the
[48:16] Tabernacle and all of our visitors and
[48:18] the saints of God Amen and so we want to
[48:23] go right into the word while you're
[48:24] standing in Revelations chapter 5
[48:27] um the most Sublime act in the
[48:30] scripture where we started this morning
[48:32] the most Sublime act in the scripture
[48:36] it's found in Revelations chapter
[48:41] 5 this great taking of the
[48:46] book then taking of the book he took our
[48:50] sins he paid for our
[48:53] Ransom and he redeemed Us by his blood
[48:59] Amen in verse one and I saw on the right
[49:02] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[49:04] book written within and on the backside
[49:07] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[49:10] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[49:12] voiced who is worthy to open the book
[49:15] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[49:18] man in heaven or in Earth neither under
[49:22] the Earth was able to open the book
[49:24] neither to look thereon and I wept much
[49:28] because no man was found worthy to open
[49:32] and to read the book neither to look
[49:35] thereon one of the elders saith unto me
[49:38] weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[49:41] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[49:45] to open the book and to loose the Seven
[49:48] Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the
[49:52] midst of the throne and of the four
[49:55] beast and in the midst of the elders
[49:58] stood a lamb as it had been slain having
[50:01] seven horns seven eyes which are the
[50:04] seven spirits of God sent forth into all
[50:07] the Earth and he
[50:10] came and took the book out of the right
[50:13] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[50:17] when he had taken the book The Four
[50:18] beasts four and 20 Elders fell down
[50:23] before the lamb having every one of them
[50:25] Harps and golden vows full of odors
[50:29] which are the prayers of the Saints and
[50:30] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[50:35] Worthy to take the book how many's glad
[50:38] to know that he's worthy to take the
[50:41] book may God add a blessing to the
[50:43] reading of his word you may be seated
[50:46] thank you for the song specials tonight
[50:48] just a real
[50:50] blessing apologize brother Jonathan I
[50:53] didn't have my phone with me you were
[50:55] texting me and no response and it was
[50:58] here at the church that church phone and
[51:01] so but we're so glad to have you folks
[51:03] here and all of the saints that are
[51:05] gathered here tonight amen you love the
[51:08] Lord each of you praise the Lord thank
[51:11] God for his great Mercy to us we spoke
[51:14] this morning on this uh the most Sublime
[51:17] thing or the most Sublime act in the
[51:20] scripture and here we see the lamb
[51:24] taking the book this was redemption's
[51:28] price being paid for you and I this is
[51:31] the most Sublime thing not only in the
[51:34] scripture it's the most Sublime thing in
[51:37] your life is the Lamb taking your sins
[51:41] away we couldn't even come to worship
[51:43] here tonight if there wasn't a bloody
[51:46] lamb we wouldn't be able to even say
[51:49] Amen to the word if there wasn't a
[51:51] bloody lamb we couldn't even have the
[51:56] attitude that we have of praise and
[51:58] worship if there wasn't a lamb he made a
[52:03] way and when Believers see this you
[52:06] don't have to push them to praise the
[52:09] Lord when they understand this when
[52:12] they've actually gone through this it's
[52:15] an experience that you'll tell over and
[52:18] over and over again it never gets old to
[52:22] the one it happens to can tell it early
[52:25] in the morning he can can tell it cold
[52:27] turkey he can tell it on a Sunday Monday
[52:30] Tuesday Wednesday tell it when he just
[52:33] fell tell it when he's getting up from
[52:36] falling this is a testimony that happens
[52:39] to a Believer it's your
[52:42] testimony every believer has one how
[52:44] many Christians here tonight let me see
[52:46] your hand all right God bless all those
[52:49] hands that are Christians if you're a
[52:51] Christian tonight it's because the lamb
[52:53] took the book book and this is what took
[52:56] place he took your sins and when your
[53:00] those sins were taken away oh the shouts
[53:04] the praise the glory how many's ever how
[53:08] many's ever sang to the Lord just in
[53:11] your truck or your car by
[53:13] yourself it it don't even have to match
[53:16] right it don't even have to rhyme it
[53:18] don't even have to be a song nobody's
[53:20] ever sang before I make up songs all the
[53:23] time because the Lord put the song in my
[53:26] heart
[53:27] and and we all have a song to sing and
[53:32] that song is our testimony it's the song
[53:35] of the redeemed amen oh God yes
[53:39] sir amen the redeemed people have a
[53:43] song they got something to sing about
[53:47] they got something to worship about and
[53:51] this great happening we see it here so
[53:54] in the message the breach brother bam
[53:57] says this in paragraph 200 I'll read it
[54:00] again this evening just to get a
[54:03] background here from the prophet here
[54:06] oh would not it be a glorious thing if
[54:09] our sinful thoughts tonight could be
[54:12] laid aside long enough to accept him and
[54:16] he would Advance all the way from Glory
[54:19] tonight to make himself known to any of
[54:23] you so you see John was weak weeping the
[54:27] great mature Apostle is weeping one of
[54:32] the elders is now weeping because no one
[54:36] was worthy to take the book but now
[54:39] brother bam tells us that he'll come
[54:41] from Glory tonight if you would move
[54:44] your sinful thoughts aside and he would
[54:47] come from glory and make himself known
[54:50] to any one of you what a tremendous
[54:53] thought to think that Christ doesn't
[54:56] send Mary or one of the Saints he comes
[55:01] himself to the believer He makes himself
[55:04] known to the believer as you repent of
[55:07] your sins and you say Lord Jesus I want
[55:10] you to come into my heart very simple
[55:13] prayer just a few words few mumbling
[55:17] words to some but to us it's the change
[55:19] of our life Lord Jesus would you come
[55:23] into my heart how beautiful is that when
[55:26] he comes down into your little heart
[55:28] there teenage heart 20 year old heart 40
[55:32] 50 year old however old the heart is
[55:35] when you ask him to come he'll come into
[55:37] that heart and he'll leave glory to do
[55:41] so but we also uh uh showed in the
[55:45] scriptures that repentance and this
[55:48] process of repentance is what each
[55:51] believer does as we come to Christ we
[55:53] repent and then we're baptized and I get
[55:56] a witness and after we're baptized we
[55:59] repent we're baptized and then we're
[56:01] candidates to receive the Holy Ghost and
[56:04] after the message tonight if the Lord
[56:06] will the altar will be open you can St
[56:08] at your seat and pray and I really
[56:10] believe with all my heart that we need
[56:13] the Holy Ghost all of us yes we do so
[56:18] this process is um the the repented
[56:21] heart and I said this to the church this
[56:24] morning I can't think of any great
[56:26] thing individual thing that the believer
[56:30] does as becoming a Christian that he'll
[56:33] do for the rest of his life and that is
[56:36] to repent there's nothing more beautiful
[56:40] than to be able to repent and ask God to
[56:44] forgive you of your sins and ask God to
[56:47] bring you back into fellowship and he
[56:50] forgets all about it he washes you white
[56:53] in his Precious Blood and I can't think
[56:56] of anything greater but this process
[56:58] brother random says here in the message
[57:00] if God be for us then where are all the
[57:03] Miracles this is from this morning in
[57:06] paragraph
[57:07] 193 he says if there's any of you God a
[57:10] duct nature we got a great big pool back
[57:13] here so if you can smell if you can get
[57:16] a whiff that God remains God if you got
[57:18] a whiff from Heaven tonight that God
[57:21] keeps his word and he's a miracle
[57:23] working God and you haven't received re
[57:26] the Holy Ghost yet smell the water the
[57:29] first thing he said do certainly repent
[57:33] from the bottom of your heart and lay
[57:35] yourself as a sacrifice on the Altar and
[57:38] you will be consumed of the world and
[57:41] Born Again of the spirit and be baptized
[57:45] in the name of Jesus Christ he'll fill
[57:47] you with the Holy Ghost go through the
[57:50] right process not come shake hands with
[57:53] the preacher put your name on the book
[57:55] but die so dead that you don't know the
[57:59] world no more thank you Lord Jesus what
[58:03] a beautiful process so he's dealing with
[58:06] this process of
[58:09] repentance now I just want to go a
[58:11] little bit further into this repentance
[58:15] and how the believer goes into this
[58:17] process of repentance and then we can
[58:20] sometimes lose our way and we do do
[58:23] things that's wrong and when we do
[58:26] things that's wrong we have to make
[58:28] those right and we use this Avenue of
[58:31] repentance because the blood is still on
[58:33] the mercy seat and we're so glad it is
[58:36] that we can come and ask God to forgive
[58:39] us but what happens when we don't ask
[58:41] him to forgive us what happens when we
[58:44] do wrong we know we've done wrong but
[58:48] yet we won't go make it right we call
[58:51] that and brother ram calls it the
[58:53] unconfessed sin and when you find
[58:56] yourself in that lifestyle or in that
[58:59] position in your life people can live
[59:01] for years and months and uh uh uh
[59:05] periods of time where they have this
[59:07] unconfessed sin in their life and how
[59:09] many you appreciate that portion of the
[59:11] tape this morning I played there with a
[59:13] Prophet this Sunday school teacher 30
[59:16] years old losing her mind trying to find
[59:20] Grace With God trying to to get right
[59:23] with God and she could couldn't be
[59:27] healed and she's taking all of these
[59:29] drugs and pills and so forth brother
[59:32] Brandon prayed for her twice ministers
[59:35] had prayed for her and then finally the
[59:39] answer came through a vision of the
[59:42] Prophet that she had unconfessed sin in
[59:44] her life now that was a GameChanger for
[59:47] her wouldn't you say would you say now
[59:50] she can move on and her husband had to
[59:53] confess the same thing he was the Deacon
[59:55] in the church church so the church is
[59:58] being hindered by this unconfessed sin
[1:00:00] she's a Sunday school teacher in the
[1:00:02] same church hindered by this unconfessed
[1:00:05] sin and this issue is going on but now
[1:00:08] God's grace because of the lamb and the
[1:00:11] blood still being on the throne they can
[1:00:14] make this right now it it might hurt a
[1:00:18] little bit it might cost you something
[1:00:21] but at the end of the day at least
[1:00:24] you're right with God is that right
[1:00:26] isn't that more important than anything
[1:00:28] else I just want to be right with God if
[1:00:31] you got to lose your house if you got to
[1:00:33] lose your Finance if you got to lose a
[1:00:36] family member or two or all of your
[1:00:38] family if you got to lose your freedom
[1:00:41] and lose your very life you still want
[1:00:45] to be right with God doesn't matter who
[1:00:48] like you or who don't like you if you're
[1:00:51] right with God that's all you need in
[1:00:53] your life and we as believers that is
[1:00:56] the most important thing to us numbers
[1:00:59] in the church or being able to sing or
[1:01:02] preach the best means doesn't mean
[1:01:04] nothing to the the believer wants to be
[1:01:07] right with God at what cost you'll say
[1:01:11] at all CA we want to do what's right we
[1:01:16] want to make it right between us and
[1:01:19] God and not only between us and God
[1:01:21] between us and one
[1:01:22] another us and our brother and our
[1:01:25] sister you leave your gift at the altar
[1:01:28] if there's an a with you and a brother
[1:01:29] and then you go to make that right is
[1:01:31] that what he said that's what Jesus told
[1:01:33] us and so this confess sin when it's not
[1:01:37] confessed it's unconfessed sin and then
[1:01:41] brother vom goes further in that very
[1:01:44] same testimony right at the end there
[1:01:46] see if I can take it here real quick he
[1:01:50] um it's talking about when we neglect to
[1:01:55] do something that God called us to do
[1:01:58] and we don't do it we're still on bad
[1:02:02] terms with God and he's dealing with it
[1:02:05] in the same channel under the same sub
[1:02:08] subject of unconfessed sin I'm not gonna
[1:02:11] be long help me preach for a minute okay
[1:02:14] in the message do you now believe
[1:02:17] brother brandom is going on in paragraph
[1:02:20] 53 this is the end of that quote that we
[1:02:23] played a little bit of this morning and
[1:02:26] he says brother Roberts is praying for
[1:02:28] people the way God told him to do it I'm
[1:02:30] doing it the way God told me to do it
[1:02:32] see so it just it's slow I want I want
[1:02:37] to know what I'm doing and before I
[1:02:39] condemn a satanic spirit and so forth I
[1:02:41] want to know first whether that's is
[1:02:44] God's legal plan it's God as brother
[1:02:48] bosart says Jesus die for everyone
[1:02:51] that's right then if you're living in
[1:02:53] above the reproach and doing right then
[1:02:55] Satan has to turn loose of you but if
[1:02:58] there's anything back behind there maybe
[1:03:01] something that you ought to have done
[1:03:04] maybe you're living clean and pure but
[1:03:08] God told you something to do and you
[1:03:10] neglected to do it and god holds that
[1:03:14] right on you until you go back and make
[1:03:17] that thing right again whether it's
[1:03:20] something you should have
[1:03:23] done of should or should not have done
[1:03:27] do you see what I mean oh really that
[1:03:29] opens it up a little bit more it's not
[1:03:32] just unconfessed sin it's
[1:03:36] Disobedience God has showed you what you
[1:03:38] need to do he's made it clear that you
[1:03:41] need to do it and you decide you're not
[1:03:43] going to do it and you think you're
[1:03:44] gonna get your praise on you're gonna go
[1:03:47] ahead and study more word you're G to go
[1:03:49] argue with the other Christians no you
[1:03:52] got to stop and go do what God told you
[1:03:54] to do you can't wait worry about what
[1:03:56] other people are trying to get you to do
[1:03:59] or pressure you to do when God told you
[1:04:01] to do something go do it because you
[1:04:04] want to be found in his grace and favors
[1:04:08] amen amen so brother manam brings this
[1:04:11] that way you neglect and in this
[1:04:15] neglecting God still holds that against
[1:04:17] you so let's go a little bit further
[1:04:20] here in the message
[1:04:22] expectations brother brandom says this
[1:04:24] here paragraph number 32
[1:04:28] 1954 I know you love the quotes that's
[1:04:30] why I read
[1:04:32] them you know if you all didn't want me
[1:04:34] to read quotes guess what I do thank you
[1:04:38] I'mma read them
[1:04:40] anyway I'm blessed when I read
[1:04:43] them glory
[1:04:45] amen I said well that's up to them I
[1:04:48] don't know but I said you know you never
[1:04:51] know no matter how much you scream how
[1:04:54] loud you scream how much you pray that's
[1:04:57] the that Devil's got a legal right to
[1:05:00] stay right there and he will stay there
[1:05:03] too that's right he's got a right to
[1:05:05] stay there not only that but if you're
[1:05:07] supposed to have done something and
[1:05:10] didn't do it he has a legal right of
[1:05:14] Disobedience so there's what it is
[1:05:17] combing that person you find out just
[1:05:20] where that cause is then you know where
[1:05:22] to start for the Cure see it's
[1:05:25] unconfessed sin many times so you watch
[1:05:28] what you say stomping this one out and
[1:05:32] stomping that one out see that's right
[1:05:34] see faith will move but not when he's
[1:05:37] got a legal right Satan knows what his

[1:06:04] life out brother bam continues on this
[1:06:08] message the church is in in its
[1:06:10] condition paragraph
[1:06:12] 160 that's what's the matter with people
[1:06:15] don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:06:17] they're baptized they just don't
[1:06:20] thoroughly repent God's trying to give
[1:06:23] them the Holy Ghost he wants you to be
[1:06:25] meek and gentle quiet that's the reason
[1:06:29] you get up with that same selfishness in
[1:06:31] your heart or you might get up shouting
[1:06:34] speaking in tongues or or or any that
[1:06:38] would make you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:06:40] got to get up from there a different
[1:06:43] person you got to get up from there

[1:06:58] time that's the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:07:02] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[1:07:05] meekness gentleness patience Faith now
[1:07:10] just repent and tell God you want that
[1:07:13] right now be real good brother bam
[1:07:16] continues on in paragraph number nine in
[1:07:20] the message the blushing Prophet so
[1:07:22] brother Adam is dealing with this
[1:07:24] thoroughly
[1:07:26] repenting and he's dealing with if you
[1:07:29] come through that process repent and be
[1:07:32] baptized at that moment you should
[1:07:34] receive the Holy Ghost if you're taught
[1:07:36] properly the word of God is there you
[1:07:40] understand it your heart is broken and
[1:07:42] repented right you should receive the
[1:07:43] Holy Ghost right there he continues on
[1:07:46] and says this is not an easy easy
[1:07:48] subject to speak on I could think of
[1:07:50] many things that were easier to speak on
[1:07:53] but brother if somebody don't stand out
[1:07:55] in this sinful adulterous day that we
[1:07:57] live in and call the colors what's going
[1:08:00] to happen somebody has got to speak the
[1:08:03] thing somebody's got to place it before
[1:08:05] the people perhaps Ezra didn't want to
[1:08:08] do it but it was in his heart and when
[1:08:10] you see a servant of God get so sincere
[1:08:14] till he's on his face with his hands in
[1:08:17] the air praying to God blessing because
[1:08:21] of the iniquity of the people then
[1:08:23] you're going to see a Revival will start
[1:08:26] a man cannot lay in the presence of God
[1:08:30] a church cannot stay in the presence of
[1:08:33] God under repentance unless the Holy
[1:08:37] Spirit comes down and gives unction and
[1:08:40] power to start a move of God in there
[1:08:43] among those people just got to be show
[1:08:47] me a man show me another Calvin Knox
[1:08:50] finny sanki or any of those who FS the
[1:08:54] burden of the people that'll lay on
[1:08:56] their face and cry and pray before God
[1:08:59] send us a John Smith of the Baptist
[1:09:02] Church again who prayed all night for
[1:09:05] the iniquity of the people until his
[1:09:07] eyes would be swelled shut the next
[1:09:09] morning from weeping till his wife would
[1:09:12] lead him to the table and feed him his
[1:09:13] breakfast out of a spoon show me a John
[1:09:17] Wesley again a fire brand snatched from
[1:09:20] the fire I'll show you a Revival so here
[1:09:25] brother bam is talking about a church a
[1:09:28] people a group living under repentance
[1:09:32] and that's living clean and making your
[1:09:35] testimony pure before God you know how
[1:09:38] we get little runin with people and we
[1:09:41] SN we we snub and this and that we go
[1:09:43] back and forth and we say little things
[1:09:45] and we go on and don't make it right and
[1:09:48] time goes on and time goes on and then
[1:09:51] the Lord has to really convict us to get
[1:09:54] us to you know come back back and make
[1:09:56] the thing right and many times we come
[1:09:58] to church and even take communion and
[1:10:01] even go on in church and knowing that
[1:10:04] these things should be right but if
[1:10:06] we're living under repentance all the
[1:10:09] time God's got to honor that I believe
[1:10:12] he will honor it if this whole group
[1:10:14] would live under that repentance God
[1:10:18] will his presence would come and that a
[1:10:20] church cannot stay in the presence of
[1:10:23] God under repentance unless the Holy
[1:10:26] Spirit comes down and gives unction and
[1:10:30] power that's what he
[1:10:31] said and so here brother vam brings it
[1:10:35] even further to us now we have to have
[1:10:37] something to point to a standard to look
[1:10:41] up to as Believers we don't just like I
[1:10:44] was telling the church this morning we
[1:10:46] don't want to just bring people to
[1:10:48] repentance and water baptism but nobody
[1:10:51] receives the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] is in there it is is a must it's not
[1:10:58] optional it's not like how you treat
[1:11:01] some of you treat the Wednesday night
[1:11:02] prayer meeting it is a must it is a
[1:11:07] requirement that every member receive
[1:11:10] the holy ghost or you're not going in
[1:11:12] the Rapture that is the truth I have to
[1:11:16] have the H you have to have the Holy
[1:11:18] Ghost every believer must have the Holy
[1:11:22] Ghost we can't preach it too much I
[1:11:24] think we preach preach it less than we
[1:11:27] should be we should be preaching it more
[1:11:30] and presenting it to our young people
[1:11:33] presenting it to the new converts that
[1:11:35] you must receive the Holy Ghost it is a
[1:11:39] must it's there for you it's for the
[1:11:43] believer and here how brother random
[1:11:46] says it here in the message um he cares
[1:11:50] for you 1960 there's only one way that
[1:11:54] you'll ever be able to receive this
[1:11:56] wonderful
[1:11:57] comforter is When You Believe on the
[1:12:00] Lord Jesus Christ confess your sins
[1:12:04] repent have Christian baptism
[1:12:06] administered to you and a promise that
[1:12:10] God will fill you with the Holy Spirit
[1:12:14] that's his promise he cannot go back on
[1:12:17] that it's his promise I've always said
[1:12:21] if a person was thoroughly taught and
[1:12:24] was repented from their heart and had
[1:12:27] believed on God with all that was within
[1:12:30] them and when they are baptized
[1:12:33] immediately the holy spirit will come
[1:12:36] upon them because he's promised to do so
[1:12:40] he promised it you shall receive the
[1:12:42] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you
[1:12:45] I'll go a step further the scripture
[1:12:47] shows us that even if a man is not even
[1:12:50] baptized if his heart is right the Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost will come on that man that's in
[1:12:56] your Bible how much more those of us who
[1:12:59] repent and are baptized the Holy Ghost
[1:13:02] is a must amen and if we're taught
[1:13:06] properly that's what the standard should
[1:13:08] be you say well brother Israel we don't
[1:13:10] see that happened too much that still
[1:13:12] should be the standard is that right huh
[1:13:17] I got any Witnesses here
[1:13:18] tonight when anytime someone comes to
[1:13:21] get
[1:13:23] baptized they should
[1:13:26] receive the Holy Ghost right
[1:13:28] there
[1:13:30] amen
[1:13:32] now so we want to stay under this
[1:13:36] repentance now this most Sublime act in
[1:13:40] the
[1:13:41] scripture we see the lamb coming and
[1:13:44] taking the book and brother banham
[1:13:46] shares it with us in the message the
[1:13:49] breach and we see that in Revelations
[1:13:53] chapter 5 I want you to turn there with
[1:13:55] me quickly and we'll see what's taking
[1:13:58] place here and for the next 15 minutes
[1:14:01] or 10 minutes or so try to get out here
[1:14:04] by 6:30 or
[1:14:07] so
[1:14:09] 6:30 in somebody's time all
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:14] now this book that was in the right hand
[1:14:18] of him that sat upon the
[1:14:21] throne it's the Book of Revelations can
[1:14:24] be intimidating for those who don't know
[1:14:27] or follow as brother Bram the word of
[1:14:30] the Lord has been
[1:14:31] revealed and we don't understand it all
[1:14:34] but you can read something and get
[1:14:36] something out of it so it's no excuse
[1:14:38] for not picking up the book and reading
[1:14:40] it it's in your Bible it's not just in
[1:14:44] the preacher's Bible it's in your Bible
[1:14:46] or the prophet's Bible you have your own
[1:14:48] Bible and that Revelations 5 is in there
[1:14:52] and here this great lamb comes out of
[1:14:55] the midst of the throne and the lion
[1:14:59] prevailed we see in verse number five
[1:15:03] says weep not Behold The Lion of the
[1:15:05] tribe of Judah the root of David hath
[1:15:09] prevailed so in the breach paragraph 195
[1:15:12] the prophet of God says this
[1:15:20] here now it's just words until the
[1:15:23] happening happens to you
[1:15:26] paragraph 195 notice when he came forth
[1:15:29] where did he come from it come from the
[1:15:32] father Strone where he had been seated
[1:15:35] since he had been slain and raised again
[1:15:38] he raised up and sat on the right hand
[1:15:41] of God ever living to make intercessions
[1:15:44] amen raised there today as an
[1:15:47] intercessor with his own blood to make
[1:15:50] intercession upon the ignorance of the
[1:15:52] people now that's the one I'm pending on
[1:15:56] he he still was covered with bleach the
[1:15:59] bleach of the forgiveness of sin John
[1:16:03] looked at the lamb and the lamb looked
[1:16:05] like he had been slain and then he
[1:16:07] noticed he was wounded and cut bruised
[1:16:10] and bleeding a bloody lamb that was
[1:16:14] that's what took our place isn't it
[1:16:17] strange a simple lamb had to take our
[1:16:20] place he saw the lamb he proceeded out
[1:16:24] John hadn't saw him because he had been
[1:16:27] way back in the
[1:16:29] eternities even making intercession and
[1:16:32] showing that those who had come to God
[1:16:35] under the offering of the blood of bulls
[1:16:37] and of goats and the substitutionary
[1:16:40] offering cuz them who believed it
[1:16:43] pointed to him and the blood had not
[1:16:45] been shed yet so he was there to clear
[1:16:48] them he was there to clear you and I and
[1:16:52] oh God I hope he's there tonight for
[1:16:55] every sinner the lamb been slain how can
[1:16:59] Jehovah see anything but that Bloody
[1:17:01] lamb standing there so we see this great
[1:17:06] event taking place not only in the
[1:17:10] scripture not only in the message that
[1:17:12] we listen to In The Prophet's Ministry
[1:17:15] but also in our very lives the lamb was
[1:17:19] slain for your sins brother and sister
[1:17:23] this is why when we conf confess our
[1:17:25] sins we we enter into where he justifies
[1:17:31] us and he takes the very sin away from
[1:17:34] us the Old Testament covered our sins in
[1:17:38] the New Testament blood it removed our
[1:17:41] sins so now we stand Justified as Sons
[1:17:46] and Daughters of
[1:17:47] God that ought to set any church on fire
[1:17:52] any heart that can hear that and see
[1:17:55] that reality in their life it will set
[1:17:58] their life on fire it will do to you
[1:18:02] what it did to the elders here in
[1:18:04] Revelations chapter 5 when they saw this
[1:18:07] lamb take the book it's a very emotional
[1:18:11] happening when they saw the lion the
[1:18:14] Elder said the lion has prevailed don't
[1:18:18] weep John stop crying stop worrying stop
[1:18:21] weeping John for the lion has prevailed
[1:18:25] and he turned to look it was a bloody
[1:18:27] lamb and that Bloody lamb come out of
[1:18:30] the eternities and he had blood all over
[1:18:34] him and then the elders saw him and then
[1:18:37] John saw him and then the four living
[1:18:39] creatures saw him and then they begin to
[1:18:42] Worship the Lord they begin to have a
[1:18:44] praise service they begin to thank the
[1:18:48] Lord for the lamb verse number eight in
[1:18:52] your Bible revelations 58 and when he
[1:18:55] had taken the book The Four beasts four
[1:18:58] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:19:01] having every one of them Harps so they
[1:19:04] got instruments golden vows full of
[1:19:06] odors which are the prayers of the
[1:19:09] Saints and they sung a new song and what
[1:19:12] did they say Thou Art Worthy to take the
[1:19:15] book and to open the seals thereof for
[1:19:19] thou was slain and Hast redeemed us to
[1:19:22] God by the by thy blood out of every
[1:19:24] Kindred out of the tongue and the people
[1:19:28] and nation and has made us unto our God
[1:19:32] Kings and priest we shall reain on the
[1:19:35] earth and behold and I heard the voice
[1:19:38] of many angels round about the throne
[1:19:41] and the beasts and the elders and the
[1:19:43] number of them was 10,000 times 10,000
[1:19:47] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:19:50] loud
[1:19:52] voice Worthy is the Lamb that was
[1:19:55] slain to receive power riches wisdom
[1:19:59] strength honor and glory and
[1:20:04] blessing how many come to bless the Lord
[1:20:07] how many come to say Thank You Lord Lord
[1:20:10] you're worthy you're the lamb that was
[1:20:13] slain I'm not worthy but you're worthy
[1:20:17] they're not worthy but you're worthy I
[1:20:19] don't know nobody's worthy but you are
[1:20:22] worthy and you alone receive my praise
[1:20:26] as much as I love the prophets in the
[1:20:28] Bible that can't get my praise as much
[1:20:31] as I love my parents and my pastor or
[1:20:34] those that I love they cannot get my
[1:20:35] praise my praise belongs to only one and
[1:20:39] that is the Lord Jesus Christ I will bow
[1:20:44] down my knees to the lamb that was slain
[1:20:48] for he alone was
[1:20:51] worthy this is in your Bible this was
[1:20:54] written in the Holy text and we can read
[1:20:57] it and as we think of it it brings
[1:21:00] emotion upon us but let's go a little
[1:21:02] bit further with
[1:21:04] John when John begins to see this
[1:21:07] happening in verse number 13 and he says
[1:21:11] this and every creature which is in
[1:21:14] heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:21:17] Earth and such as are in the sea even in
[1:21:20] the sea John and all that are there in
[1:21:23] them heard heard I saying what was John
[1:21:28] saying
[1:21:29] blessings honors glories Powers be unto
[1:21:35] him that sited upon the throne and unto
[1:21:38] the lamb forever and
[1:21:40] ever the four Beast said amen the 420
[1:21:44] Elders fell down and worship him that
[1:21:46] liveth forever and
[1:21:49] forever what a happening what a
[1:21:52] beautiful thing the most Sublime thing
[1:21:56] in the scripture let's read it for you
[1:21:57] in paragraph
[1:21:59] 243
[1:22:01] in the breach all
[1:22:04] right he what the prophet of God
[1:22:13] says you know brother Randon was
[1:22:15] preaching on this and he starts
[1:22:17] preaching he says oh my I feel religious
[1:22:20] that's right then he goes further he
[1:22:21] says Oho I feel like speaking in tongues
[1:22:26] like it ain't too many churches he can
[1:22:29] speak in tongues in
[1:22:31] anymore but how many how many's ever
[1:22:33] felt like speaking in
[1:22:35] tongues Are you ashamed to even say
[1:22:38] that you might speak in tongues one of
[1:22:41] these days who me yeah
[1:22:44] you that's one of the
[1:22:47] gifts don't get mad at me it's in your
[1:22:50] Bible huh why we so ashamed of speaking
[1:22:54] in
[1:22:55] tongues that make us feel
[1:22:57] funny huh make us feel
[1:23:01] nervous make us feel like we're in the
[1:23:03] wrong
[1:23:04] church if you do you might be in the
[1:23:07] wrong
[1:23:09] church but speaking in tongues don't
[1:23:11] scare no Believers dancing in the spirit
[1:23:14] don't scare no Believers you know what
[1:23:17] they gonna be doing up over there
[1:23:18] they're going to be doing up there what
[1:23:20] some of our churches won't let us do
[1:23:22] down here they going be praying PR in
[1:23:25] the Lord like they lost their mind like
[1:23:29] they got saved like they've been
[1:23:32] delivered like somebody set them free
[1:23:35] like they've heard the Jubilee trumpet
[1:23:38] sound and they can go free now
[1:23:42] Glory hallu won't be no complainers over
[1:23:46] there won't be no tight feelings over
[1:23:49] there be
[1:23:50] praising worshiping glory and honor and
[1:23:56] thank you Lord and the song of the
[1:24:00] redeemed
[1:24:03] amen praise His name amen so paragraph
[1:24:07] 243 let's take this quickly and then I
[1:24:10] want to play the first time this
[1:24:14] Revelations 5 is being broken to the
[1:24:17] people at the random
[1:24:18] Tabernacle what effect did it have upon
[1:24:21] them now we read about it in our text
[1:24:24] text as words we read about it in our
[1:24:27] Bible but what does it look like
[1:24:30] actually happening when the seals are
[1:24:32] opening it's the lamb that opens the
[1:24:35] book but you can't have the lamb opening
[1:24:38] the book without a seventh
[1:24:45] angel y'all want me to close I
[1:24:48] know you can't have a lamb open in no
[1:24:50] book without Revelations
[1:24:52] 10:7 the Angels got to be here so that
[1:24:57] the lamb can open the book and when the
[1:25:00] lamb opens the book you can see your
[1:25:03] name in there you'll see the Jubilee
[1:25:07] sound you'll know your day and its
[1:25:09] message you'll find out this is the
[1:25:12] seventh Church age and there was a
[1:25:15] prophet supposed to come and you're in
[1:25:17] it now
[1:25:20] amen somebody looking for Elijah's
[1:25:22] Mantle somebody is fasting for a great
[1:25:25] thing to happen We're In
[1:25:28] It praise His name how many thank God
[1:25:32] for it here what the prophet of God says
[1:25:36] here yes paragraph
[1:25:40] 243
[1:25:43] oh he's waiting there for me tonight who
[1:25:47] is that one church that's waiting there
[1:25:50] what else could wait there for you that
[1:25:53] Kinsman Redeemer oh my what a Sublime
[1:25:58] statement or
[1:26:01] act paragraph number
[1:26:04] 238 he says it here
[1:26:07] again notice he's not an animal he took
[1:26:11] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:26:13] that sat upon the throne who was it the
[1:26:16] original the the owner the original
[1:26:18] owner that had the book of redemption in
[1:26:21] his right hand and no angel no Angelic
[1:26:24] being nothing else could take the place
[1:26:28] and this bloody lamb walked out and took
[1:26:30] the book out of his hand who what was it
[1:26:35] brother this is the most Sublime thing
[1:26:39] in the scripture amen an act that no
[1:26:43] angel no nothing could do it and the
[1:26:47] lamb come and took it from the right
[1:26:49] hand of him that sat upon the throne all
[1:26:51] right so let's go to the let's go back
[1:26:54] in
[1:26:55] time to the brandham Tabernacle when the
[1:26:59] seventh angel is bringing these things
[1:27:01] to us amen he does this in the
[1:27:05] message in that message the
[1:27:08] breach he does it in paragraph number

[1:32:00] them is in them heard me ah saying

[1:32:20] four and 20 Elders fell down and
[1:32:23] worshiped him that lives forever
[1:32:26] know talk about a
[1:32:29] jubilee talk about a time when that land
[1:32:33] was
[1:32:35] for see the books even sealed in heaven
[1:32:38] the Mysteries
[1:32:39] are say is my name now I don't know I
[1:32:43] hope it is but if it is it was put on
[1:32:45] the book before the foundation of the
[1:32:47] world but the first thing that
[1:32:49] represented that Redemption come the
[1:32:51] lamb that have been slain from the
[1:32:53] foundation of
[1:32:54] amen and he took the
[1:32:58] book opened the book and tore off the
[1:33:01] seals and sent it down to the Earth to
[1:33:04] his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:13] people what happened the streams of
[1:33:16] shout Hall
[1:33:24] old John been stand brother crying while
[1:33:28] he said everything in heaven everything
[1:33:30] in the earth and everything in the Se
[1:33:37] Me blessings honoring might power be to
[1:33:40] him that lives forever and ever talk
[1:33:42] about a happy time when them seals broke
[1:33:45] John must have looked in and seen a pass
[1:33:47] a curtain of time and said there's
[1:33:51] John he was so happy said everything in
[1:33:54] heaven he must have really cried out
[1:33:56] didn't everything in heaven everything
[1:33:58] in the earth everything beneath the
[1:33:59] Earth every creature everything else
[1:34:02] heard me saying amen blessing and glory
[1:34:05] and wisdom and power and might riches to
[1:34:09] him amen Give the Lord a hand of Praise
[1:34:15] amen how many thank God for the
[1:34:18] word so what happened let's go over that
[1:34:21] again the John saw this lamb it comes
[1:34:25] forth and then everything begins to
[1:34:27] praise and scream the lamb takes the
[1:34:30] book and then he brings it to the Earth
[1:34:32] and he gives it to the Reverend Billy
[1:34:35] Graham to Reverend Bishop so and so he
[1:34:39] gives it to the seventh angel so how can
[1:34:42] I preach
[1:34:44] Redemption without mentioning the
[1:34:47] seventh angel how can you do it if I'm
[1:34:51] not mentioning the seventh angel just
[1:34:54] know that that is
[1:34:56] deliberate I'm deliberately doing it
[1:35:00] because Redemption comes through the
[1:35:02] blood and the Word was revealed through
[1:35:05] the seventh angel the messenger so we
[1:35:08] thank God for
[1:35:09] it if I'm not mentioning it know that
[1:35:12] that's
[1:35:17] deliberate but we're so glad to mention
[1:35:20] the seventh angel because the seventh
[1:35:23] angel is the one who revealed the Seven
[1:35:26] Seals and in those seals that's where we
[1:35:29] can see our name don't you love the Lord
[1:35:33] the most Sublime thing in the scripture
[1:35:37] you seeing your name John seeing his
[1:35:40] name brother B said John must have saw
[1:35:42] his name in there and he got happy when
[1:35:45] you see your name in there you'll get
[1:35:47] happy too I'm so glad I can see my name
[1:35:51] my name was written in the Lamb's Book
[1:35:52] of Life from before the foundation of
[1:35:55] the world and we thank God for it
[1:36:00] amen God bless you so much we trust the
[1:36:03] Lord will carry you
[1:36:05] through Psalm 68118 Psalm 66 Verse 18
[1:36:09] says if I regard iniquity in my heart
[1:36:12] the Lord will not hear me but I'm so
[1:36:16] glad that the Lord can pardon our
[1:36:18] iniquity and our
[1:36:20] transgressions and this takes place
[1:36:22] because the lamb took the book Hebrews
[1:36:26] 6:12 says that their sins and their
[1:36:30] iniquities will I remember no more how
[1:36:34] is it that he won't remember them
[1:36:35] anymore because the lamb took the book
[1:36:38] Hebrews 101 1-1 17 says this is the
[1:36:43] Covenant that I will make with them
[1:36:45] after those days sayeth the Lord I will
[1:36:48] put my laws into their hearts and in
[1:36:50] their minds will I write them and their
[1:36:53] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[1:36:57] more how many you know how many want God
[1:37:00] to forget your sins your iniquities your
[1:37:06] transgressions remember he can't forget
[1:37:08] your sins by your good works he forgets
[1:37:11] your sins through the blood that was
[1:37:13] shed at the cross and when you confess
[1:37:16] those sins in the bleach of the blood it
[1:37:20] is as though you never did it in the
[1:37:22] first place it say what sin are you
[1:37:25] talking about I've redeemed you thank
[1:37:28] you Lord this is the most Sublime thing
[1:37:31] not only in the scripture my personal
[1:37:34] testimony it's the most Sublime thing in
[1:37:37] my
[1:37:38] life when the lamb took my sins away
[1:37:43] amen Romans 4 1-8 what shall I say then
[1:37:47] that Abraham our father but turning to
[1:37:51] the flesh hath found he says now to him
[1:37:54] that worketh is the reward not reckoned
[1:37:57] of Grace but of debt but to him that
[1:37:59] worketh not but believeth on him that
[1:38:02] justifieth the ungodly his faith is
[1:38:04] counted for righteousness even as David
[1:38:08] also described the blessedness of the
[1:38:10] man unto whom God imputed righteousness
[1:38:14] without works saying blessed are they
[1:38:18] whose iniquities are forgiven and those
[1:38:21] whose sins are covered blessed is the
[1:38:24] man to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[1:38:30] now that has to take place through the
[1:38:32] blood of the Cross Colossians 2:13 our
[1:38:36] brother mentioned it in his song I
[1:38:38] believe it says and you being dead in
[1:38:40] your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[1:38:43] flesh hath he quickened together with
[1:38:46] him having forgiven you all trespasses
[1:38:51] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:38:53] ordinances that was against us which was
[1:38:57] contrary to us took it out of the way
[1:39:00] nailing it where nailing it to his cross
[1:39:05] he took all of our sins and he nailed it
[1:39:07] to his cross James
[1:39:10] 51315 is any among you Afflicted let him
[1:39:14] pray is any marry let him sing songs is
[1:39:18] any sick among you let him call for the
[1:39:20] Elders of the church and let them pray
[1:39:22] over him anoint him with oil in the name
[1:39:25] of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[1:39:27] shall do
[1:39:28] what shall save the sick and the Lord
[1:39:31] shall raise him up and if he's committed
[1:39:34] sins they shall be forgiven him first
[1:39:39] John 1 18-10 if we say that we have no
[1:39:42] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[1:39:45] is not in us if we confess our sins he
[1:39:48] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:39:52] our sins
[1:39:53] and to cleanse us from all
[1:39:57] unrighteousness everybody say
[1:39:59] all all unrighteousness not most of it
[1:40:03] not the big ones not just the little
[1:40:05] ones but all of them he's able to
[1:40:08] cleanse us from all
[1:40:11] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:40:13] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:40:16] word is not in US 1 John 2:12 I write
[1:40:19] unto you little children because your
[1:40:22] sins are are forgiven you for his name's
[1:40:26] sake how many thank the Lord for that
[1:40:29] how many thank God for your sins being
[1:40:32] forgiven how many of your sins are
[1:40:34] forgiven all of them he took my sins and
[1:40:38] he washed them all away and there's no
[1:40:43] more sins against us blessed is the man
[1:40:47] that God will not impute any iniquity
[1:40:50] because we've confessed them in the
[1:40:52] preci prous blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:54] Christ now we can receive the Holy Ghost
[1:40:58] and every promise that he has for us how
[1:41:00] many believe that tonight oh we love the
[1:41:03] lamb don't we oh we worship the lamb
[1:41:06] don't we he made a way for us it's not
[1:41:08] just the most Sublime thing in the
[1:41:11] scripture it's the most Sublime thing in
[1:41:14] all human history the most Sublime thing
[1:41:18] in any writing or anybody's life more
[1:41:22] importantly in your life that the lamb
[1:41:25] would take your sins away and not just
[1:41:27] take them away you can live a life under
[1:41:31] this repentance under the blood and have
[1:41:35] him blessing you every day of your life
[1:41:38] and we trust in believe that's what the
[1:41:40] bride is doing we thank God that he sent
[1:41:43] this great message in our day that's
[1:41:46] loose these things to the bride and
[1:41:49] we're glad about it amen what is
[1:41:52] Iniquity iniquity is to know to do right
[1:41:55] and do it anyway continue going on in
[1:41:59] your iniquity but we are those that hear
[1:42:02] the truth and will make the change that
[1:42:04] we need to that we need to make is that
[1:42:06] right disobedience is there the same
[1:42:11] iniquity unconfessed sin all those
[1:42:13] things can be dealt with and are dealt
[1:42:16] with with the lamb so tonight if you
[1:42:19] haven't received the Holy Ghost I want
[1:42:21] you to take your time and dedicate your
[1:42:24] life and rededicate what you're doing
[1:42:26] what the lamb has done for you revalue
[1:42:29] your repentance and see if you have
[1:42:31] thoroughly repented and if you have not
[1:42:35] thoroughly repented Lord help me to
[1:42:38] thoroughly repent so I can receive the
[1:42:41] Holy Ghost remember after you receive
[1:42:43] the Holy Ghost precious Holy Ghost comes
[1:42:46] in you and dwells in that human being
[1:42:48] but then now the Holy Spirit now does a
[1:42:51] work in you and he starts to take out
[1:42:53] other things in your life so that you
[1:42:55] can grow in his grace and mercy into the
[1:42:59] stature of a perfect man so the holy
[1:43:01] spirit is constantly working in that
[1:43:03] believer's life it starts and continues
[1:43:06] with repentance if you ever get to the
[1:43:09] place where you feel like you have
[1:43:11] nothing to repent about then repent for
[1:43:15] thinking that thought because Paul said
