Christ we pray amen amen you believe that you can say Amen brother brother M brother Hughes is a pastor of the Grace Covenant Church there in Columbia South Carolina and he's here with us he's no stranger he's been here a number of times and maybe we've treated him so well that he keeps coming back and so come on come on up brother Hughes As we sing the the song Amazing Grace amen how you know it's Grace God's grace Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound have that one this that one this like me I was I remember when I was lost but now so glad I found I was blind but now I see can we sing praise

Christ he's the first and the last Alpha and Omega amen do you love him tonight real honored to be with you and I appreciate your prayers as we approach the word of the Lord tonight if you have your Bibles I'll invite you to turn with me to the book of First Corinthians very familiar passage of scripture chapter 13 and uh we'll go then from there as we move forward and I'm certainly honored uh to be here tonight my dad always told me he said now son if you don't want a dog hanging around just don't feed him and uh you all have fed me real good when I come over this way and so I guess that's part of the reason I keep coming back oh I keep coming back to The Well of Grace great is the power sweet as the taste every Temptation every trial that I face I keep coming back to the well sing it with me oh I keep coming back to the will of Grace great is the power sweet is the taste every Temptation every trial that I face I keep coming back to the world I keep coming back to the world oh my are you thankful for spiritual food and good in due season amen amen you know brother Bram said I just kind of out especially the other churches I just scatter a little sheep food along and they'll Trail it back to the main source amen and so we we know who the main source is is that right sir the lovely Lord Jesus and so we're here tonight by the grace of the Lord to put emphasis on the Lord Jesus and um I really really do deem this a special privilege tonight because um even though by the grace of the Lord I've spoken to thousands I never get used to coming before God's children you just tremble in the presence of the God's children and when you realize that you have something more precious in your hands than the lovely the the literal blood of the Lord Jesus you are more precious in the sight sight of God than his own blood or he would have never made the transaction he would have never given his blood for you so let us remember that we are his main purpose I perhaps I've said that before even here but I can't seem to get away from it as the prophet of God says here in the church age book He said uh god let's say Elohim see the self-existing one in order to give himself a reason and a purpose for being had to predestinate a people that would need Redemption that's right that's us that's you we all need Redemption is that right amen so whole purpose of God before the foundation of the world was you not the moon and the stars the cosmos the cosmos the the galaxies Etc no the Earth and all of its fullness no that's not God's main purpose that's just a backdrop but his main purpose is you yes amen and so may we remember that as we approach the service tonight and uh uh I'd like to as a subtopic tonight refer to the Great Divine Romance that God had amen and still has and he's able to produce himself a bride amen amen may the Lord help us now if you have your Bibles again and shame on you if you don't have a Bible you need to sell something and get one you'll never understand the message until you have some conception of the Bible because even when the angel of the Lord come to brother Brenham he said if I hadn't seen it in the Bible I wouldn't have accepted it he said you might disagree with me now on my Doctrine and so forth but he said if you'll search your scripture search the Bible you'll find it hits the mark because the angel of the Lord came and taught it to me and he showed me in the Bible where to find it amen so we need to read our Bibles I think it was brother a brother from over in this part of the country I don't have my cell phone with me but he was up in the pull pit and he took his cell phone up and held it up like this and he said now what am I doing what am I reading nobody knows then he got his Bible he said now what am I reading thank God for the cell phones I'm not trying to you know and But be sure you have your Bible on your cell phone too is that right amen and uh so 1 Corinthians chapter 13 and we'll begin reading with the first verse though I speak with tongues of men and angels and I have not charity I am become as a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all the Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor though I give my body to be burned yeah become a martyr have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up do not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but where there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in heart shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now Paul speaking 2,000 years ago this was writing to the Corinthian Church about 2,000 years ago now we see through a glass Darkly but then I want to say that that then is now that then was not 2,000 years ago that then is now okay for now Paul said we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity let's pray Heavenly Father we're asking now that you will anoint both our ears and our tongue Lord our hearing and our speaking May our thoughts be your thoughts and may our Expressions be pleasing in thy sight we're claiming this service Together For Your Glory and Lord we're here to speak of thee we we're here as the Shepherds of old would car little honey in their script and they'd put the honey on the Rock oh and when the sick sheep got to lick in the Limestone Rock they get the minerals from the from the stone Lord we need your minerals tonight Lord we need those spiritual vitamins and minerals from the word of God that might bring healing Lord and deliverance Grant it we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated the Lord bless you now if you'll give me your undivided attention for just a little bit I'll try to condense I realize it's a Wednesday night and uh how many people have a job I want you to raise your hand if you have a job thank God you got a job amen there's people that don't have uh work you know a Christian is the one man who will work the they asked brother brandom a question will should a Christian work he said what should a Christian work he said that's the one fell will work is the Christian is that right and so Paul said he that don't work don't eat and so we want you to uh keep working we'll work we'll work till Jesus comes we'll work is that right amen then we'll be gathered home praise the Lord so we appreciate the good Lord and his grace toch page 61 of the church age book and I'll confess I'm just reading this to kind of set the atmosphere here our brother has some quotes that we're going to be pulling up God willing and um uh this I didn't give him this but I want to read to you from the church age book and how many in here has read the church age book all right wonderful wonderful you have it you need to because brother brandham on tape uh in the trying to do God a service without it being his will he said it come from God and not from my thinking he said you'll find it all drawn out in my book my book The Seven Church Ages which came from God and not from my thinking if you want a deeper understanding of the word of God and the will of God and what's taking place in the Church of God today study your church age book yes amen and so because in here you also find the uh culmination of the revelation of the seals is interwoven in here also because it wasn't finished until after the seals was preached but on page 61 here um now Paul said that the word came in power as well as voice yes okay the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set the captives free everywhere those early Believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed Devils were cast out and they spake with new tongues that was the word in action amen that here it is now I love this that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever ever in the true word bride did you hear that oh if I had have lived in Bible days what this is Bible days this is the greatest of all Bible days this is the climax of The Bible this is the interpretation of the Bible this is the Fulfillment of the Bible oh there's never been a day like this day never been a light that Shin so bright as this day do you realize Church do I realize that this is greater day than when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee oh yes the prophet of God said that why because the work of redemption hadn't been wrought at that time but now amen let the redeemed of the Lord say so the Holy Ghost had not yet been given at that time oh but this is a greater day than that we had not seen the seven manifestations of the seven spirits of God down through the seven Church ages but now we can look back with all of that and say praise be to God God give us a comprehension give us a revelation of the whole scheme of the program of God you save the best to last amen oh just like the turning the water to wine is that right save the best wine till last and the stimulation of the revelation of Jesus Christ sets our souls on fire amen but you got to hunger for it you got to thirst for it you got to long for for it amen that control tower amen down in the soul that creates that thirst that hunger for God Amen oh my let me say that again the word that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger yes and greater than ever where where is it at brother Hughes in the true word bright how many any true word bride members don't underestimate who you are amen don't underestimate the power of God don't underestimate the power of the spoken word when it's spoken from the heart when it's believed in the heart and spoken amen upon the mouths of believing Christians it's never failed oh little flock you little minority do you identify there little flock fear not Little Flock oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom not just half the kingdom it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I want to ask you how many of you here know how to pray good then pray for me I'm scheduled to go my first time to Pakistan next month and then the following month in December back into um oh East Africa Tanzania or tanzan and so I appreciate your prayers and this year has been a very busy year for me I've been in several different countries doing missionary work by the Grace of the Lord but do we really know how to pray I'm asking myself that question and uh did you ever notice how that man has a tendency to build their own kingdom build their own house build their own church build their own this build their own reputation you know especially our politicians all due respects but nonetheless when Jesus was ask Master teach us how to pray what is the first thing he taught us to ask for when we pray anybody remember right off hand don't ever let me ask you this question again without you raising your hand okay Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name we come worshiping him first is that right exalting him first amen any good wife knows you got to can't exalt your husband a little bit if you want to get something from him right got to give you you know the way to a man's heart is through his stomach cook him a good meal you know and talk to him a little bit worship him a little bit yes sir now not I'm not teaching worship your husband exactly but you do if you don't obey your husband you don't honor your husband you're not even a Christian brother Ram said now don't tell me that you are a Christian and you don't obey your husband somebody some some of you Brothers ought to say Amen to that it's okay for the Sisters to it's okay for the Sisters to say Amen too we'll get to the brothers in a minute okay we'll get we'll get to the the sisters part and it's okay for the Sisters to say Amen because brother Bram said ain't that right sister Nelly you ought sister Nelly you ought to be able to say or uh sister Cox you ought to be able to say Amen to that okay but let's consider now thy kingdom come what but we are always approaching God and dealing with him as a little Aaron boy wanting this that and the other selfish but the true spirit of God is unselfish and it's to promote God that's thy kingdom yes sir come that's thy not my not my will thy will be done where did the Fall start not in the Garden of Eden not with the woman e oh yes on Earth but there was another fall that caused that fall and that fall started in heaven Church order started getting out of order in heaven whenever you study the seals you'll notice in that series the first thing brother Brandon preached was God hidden and revealed in simplicity and he dealt with church order setting the church in order is that right so Church order is part of the revelation of the seals and church order is essential it's essential the first thing that H happened in heaven was the breaking of church order Lucifer wanted to exalt himself above God the song leader the worship leader wanted to become the pastor when God's the only Pastor I said there's only one Chief Shepherd hey and if you cannot honor the uh Pastor he said at least honor and respect the office is that right amen yes sir and so we we see that Lucifer got out of Heaven out of order in heaven and he got kicked out of heaven is that right and it didn't Shake God a bit no God didn't get upset no he took two-thirds of his congregation when he left the congregations of Heaven 2third of the angels went with Lucifer when he fell did God get excited he knew it was going to happen he seen the thoughts of Satan before he actually expressed those thoughts he was perfect in the day he was created but he was given self-will he was given free moral agency yes a choice you you're given a choice each one of us is given a choice choice is a wonderful thing but your choice amen will determine your Eternal destination oh yes your choice amen yet on the other hand Jesus said you've not chosen me I've chosen you he knows what your choice is going to be is that right and but now whenever see there's no Redemption for Angels Fallen Angels There's No Redemption for Angels period spoken of in the scriptures if you find it bring it to me I want to know it no Redemption for angels angels are not Heirs of Salvation angels can never sing the song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that Sav to like me no no angels are ministering Spirits sent forth to minister unto us who are Heirs of Salvation angels are not on the order of sons and daughters who would God hear and answer prayer for first an angel in his presence or a son of God in his presence a Son of God Amen it's a higher order amen because you're a very extens of God now think about that just a moment Elohim can never Remain the self-existing one anymore he's got a name Chang Jehovah God dwelling with his people the family brother bandam emphasizes this he's never can never be the self-existing one anymore why he's got Eternal ones existing with him and you've got to see yourself as those one of them one of them I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them how about you how do you know you are brother Hughes how do you know you are my brother my sister you hear the word of God my sheep hear my voice you've recognized your day and its message that's the evidence of the Holy Spirit and that's what we're going to be talking about here tonight oh my yes now so if you'll notice when the Angels fell God didn't move but oh my when Adam and Eve fell he came down in person is that right and God was the first one to slay blood to shed blood and he killed the lamb and the Sheep Etc and made skins for them in the place or aprons uh of skin for them in the in the stead of fig leaves fig Reaves fig Le religion just won't work we must have the blood it's the blood Hallelujah why the life is in the blood a minister in this message at a Minister's meeting got up and said the blood wasn't Divine yeah he said I was overseas uh talking and um I was U arguing with a a minister overseas and and that Minister was trying to tell me that the blood of Jesus Christ was divine Divine blood and he said I don't believe it what that made me and hey search the message search the scriptures catch a revelation acts 20:28 declares amen Paul speaking there said feed the flock of God wherewith the Holy Ghost hath made thee overseer which God hath purchased with his own blood I want to remind you tonight you wasn't purchased by the blood of a Jew he wasn't purchased by the blood of a gentile Joseph didn't contribute anything to the Virgin birth Mary didn't contribute anything God created both egg and sperm in that virgin womb Hallelujah that was Jehovah coming forth God the beginning of the creation of God God becoming part of his own creation what for to bleed and die for you to shed his own blood he didn't send a second person amen he didn't send a third person he came himself oh my thank God for the blood amen and then what is the token brother Hughes the life that was in that blood there's the new birth there's the Holy Ghost the blood cell of Jehovah had to be broken to release the life to come back upon the worshipper to change your nature Hallelujah I said to change your nature and the Bible Peter speaking over there said by these exceeding great and precious promises we are made partakers of the divine nature what yes the new birth it's deity not in heaven not deity in a Manger that's right it's deity in you Sons and Daughters of God Amen with ET the same Life Zoey life of God oh my if we could just read realize who we are may the Lord help us to do so oh my let's go to this quote a number one quote of number one number one of number one I they're all number one aren't they can we come up with this how do we uh yeah okay let's go forward look at this and can we voice that let the prophet speak it play it just that portion if it's not too much trouble otherwise I can just read it here everybody happy not happy you need to get saved because God's people are happy hey Life come out of the animal or not the animal but out of the Son of God coming back witnessing to your heart that he has accepted your faith and glory and you've got to get well now we're speaking of a miracle that taking place in the New Testament the healing of J's daughter uh Little Priest at the temple wonderful lesson if we just had the time to speak on it a while just pre previous to this chapter we find one place there where the Son of God spent so much time in prayer and if Jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was ining how much more do you and I have to spend in prayer much time in prayer if you only knew what time and prayer meant what sometimes when you're in prayer God changes the the complete destination of different things that's going to happen do you believe that might be something fixing that happened and your prayer could change the whole situation well you say if God knows it's going to happen what will my prayer do you remember when he stood there looking out upon the harest he said he was the lord of the Harvest he said the Harvest is right and labors are the few pray ye the lord of the Harvest that he'll send labors into his harvest in other words pray to me that I will send labors into my Harvest which I'm just telling you it's such a needy thing but part of it lays in human beings do you believe that the kingdom of God lays within the human beings now Jesus said in one place I am the vine ye are are the branches the vine can't bear fruit the branches in the vine bears fruit God cannot bear fruit on himself it's got to take the church is that right he's got to take you branches to bear fruit and when you branches are yielded to the vine then fruit comes forth see what I mean God wants your your hands you want your eyes you want your tongue want your lips want your ears want your hands and feet so he can bring forth fruit through you now Jesus put much time in prayer one day there he told his disciples he said now cross over to the other side he sent him away while he went up in the mountain to pray while he was up there alone really a storm coming up I believe I don't know but I believe if I've been the disciples I've said I know he told us to go over but I I believe I'll just wait till he comes and goes along I like for him to be along in these cases don't you so we see him now going up into the mountain to pray the disciples thrusted out into the sea and picked up their hores and their little ship sail went up and away they started oring across to the other side side where Jesus was to meet him on the other side then going in the absence of the Holy Spirit or of Christ that invisible form on the road over trouble set in and usually if you start anywhere without Christ troubles on its Road just as soon as the devil sees you out of fellowship with Christ right then he'll set out on as hard as he can just as soon as he you away from prayer away from consecration Satan will catch you right then if he possibly can amen all right I want you to notice something here in this and it really stood out to me it actually came to me early early very early this morning when I was praying about 4:00 in the morning praying about what the Lord would have me to speak on here thank you brother George you're a man after my own heart thank you brother appreciate it and you know with the great vast message that we've received a minister that has studied the message doesn't have any problem finding something inspirational to preach about but what's the most important thing is to find what's timely what's in season what's in time and what's in season what does the Lord want at that particular time see otherwise we're just spinning our Wheels doing God a service without it being his will but this came to me as I was praying and I I want to be the first one to confess that I don't pray as much as I should I really don't and I I desire of course uh to to pray more but then how do we pray and in this I want you to notice we're sons of God we're not the only begotten Son of God Jesus is the only only begotten born through the Virgin birth we're born by the word of God being born again not of corruptible seed but of The Incorruptible the word of God which liveth and abideth forever we're born by the Holy Spirit by the process of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit brings that full uh procedure to each individual but here the Jesus being the Son of God now think about it and not just a Son of God but the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelleth in him he was Jehovah of the Old Testament is none other than Jesus Christ of the New Testament is that true amen so what was it Emmanuel God Amen Among Us God in flesh amen condescending and becoming one of us to redeem us amen and to come into fellowship with us but notice here the prophet of God said and um uh if I raise my hand up like this I'd like for you to pause the tape next time if it's playing I I would like to emphasize something but here in this I want to emphasize this how that the prophet of God said notice how that Jesus had to pray much though he was the son of God he had to pray much Amen to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was within him what to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was within him you see Jesus was all man but he was also all God that's right he was tempted in every manner just like you are he was all man yet he was all God he was fully man he was man in every respect as a man Hallelujah he's a man who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he's the only mediator between God and men and that's the man Christ Jesus not the pope there's only one mediator amen not your pastor not your Bishop one mediator between God and all men and that's the man Christ Jesus he's the high priest of our profession is that right oh my he's the Holy Spirit that's within you and if you want to pray pray amen not to a god that's a far off brother Bram said but to pray to the god that is within you if you're born again believer if you have the Holy Ghost then stay in fellowship with that spirit that is within you that's right because Jesus said as the father sent me so send I you amen how did the Jesus send the father he got in him or how did the father send Jesus it was the father in Jesus is that right amen and it must be the same with us and we must pray oh God help us to catch a revelation of the necessity uh the need for True prayer amen praying and and letting amen God speak to you he'll bring his thoughts to you he'll bring his thoughts to you oh yes this great ministry gift that God brought to us was not just to discern our thoughts and the intents of our heart or to discern our diseases but more importantly it was to discern the very thoughts of God to pick up the thoughts of God and to reveal the thoughts of God and that's what the message is it's the interpretation of the thoughts of God God is his own interpreter let's go to this first quote now and it comes from uh questions and answers 1964 question ansers number two just that part that I have in yellow there dear brother just let it go uh record 57 First Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things are jumping up down like a kid trying to talk in tones and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication what did you say then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child amen let me read it to you now again First Corinthians 13 says this when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be be done away with we just read it in the scripture is that right now your Church of Christ uh preachers and teachers and many of the denominations say well and I actually well I have to be careful okay uh but notice here uh they say well you know prophecy was done away with so you know we don't believe in Prophecy today and we don't believe in prophets today because it was done away with you know when Jesus come that which is perfect has come and it's all you know okay but here notice what he said when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication then that which is imperfect uh that then that which is in part is done away with see okay so this message is the perfect interpretation of the word of God we had the old and the new we've had it for years ever since the it was finished being compiled and become canon in the days of John that's why he was banished to the AIS of patmas he and maray and Andrew were working together to put the Epistles of Paul and John and the gospels all together to compile it into the form of the New Testament Satan hates to be exposed amen but we see that we've had the word of God but even on the aisle of patmas if you'll remember John was told seal it up write it not but in the of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound all the mysteries of God shall be made known today by the grace of God we do have the full complete interpretation of the Bible I said by the grace of God today with the message only through the message through the Vindicated messenger of Malachi 4 we have the thorough full interpretation of this Bible that which is perfect the perfect interpretation of the Bible it is come hallelujah amen and so tonight we're going to be talking about the evidence of the Holy Spirit let's go forward to uh number two quote here and this um comes from broken sisters today I was talking with my good friend Dr Lee Vale who's present now and he's a quite a theologian and so we usually have some have some pretty good discussions on the scripture very smart and he asked me one time what I thought about the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost was it speaking in tongues it's been many years ago I said no can't you see that he said neither do I said though I've been taught that he said what would you think could be an Evidence I said the most perfect evidence I can think of is love and so we got talking on that then I thought that sounded pretty good so just help that if a man's got love but one day the Lord the Lord Vision continue straighten me out and he said that the evidence of the spirit was the those who could receive the word neither love nor speaking in tongues but receiving the word hallelujah and then neither love nor speaking in tongues but receiving the word is that what he said all right just that's part of it now so keep forward Dr Bale was saying to me that that is scriptural he said because in John 14 Jesus said when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things to you that I've taught you and will show you things to come so there is a genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost hallu he's never told me anything wrong yet that it is that evidence of the Holy Ghost is he who can believe the word you can receive it because Jesus never said when the Holy Ghost has come you'll speak with tongues he never said the Holy Ghost come you do anything else things but he said he will take these things of mine and show them to you and will show you things that is to come Hallelujah so there is a genuine evidence of the Holy Ghost According To Jesus himself so all these Sensations and things that people have and still live on you can see why they do it see it becomes a denomination or stagnated pool and there'll never be a denomination made upon the perfect word of God it can't do it because you can't nominate or denominate God no sir no amen so now you know Satan hates to be exposed and his tactics he don't like his tactics to be exposed that's right he knows know far better than 90% of the theologians and I think maybe sometimes a great percentage of the so-called ministers in this message Satan knows that God is immutable in his ways and he doesn't change and he also knows that the true church that was established at Pentecost is the true church and everything else is is wrong and so his business is to build his own kingdom my kingdom come my will be done and he's had 7,000 year or 6,000 years and that's why brother Brandon preached the message Satan's Eden God built his Eden in six days and rested on the seventh Satan has had now 6,000 years and it's come to a Satan's Eden feeding on the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it only brings death and Chaos amen Satan is the author of confusion he's the author of chaos but only God can bring peace and uniformity and order out of chaos and that's what the message is here for is to bring order in your home Amen to bring order in your church to bring order in your heart to bring order in your life why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to get this great Revelation 2 to you that the end is here we've arrived amen and we have everything we have need of now amen if we'll just feed on it hear ye him the evidence of the Holy Ghost has not changed it's been the same in every Church age read your Bible in each of the seven Church ages from Paul Amen to brother brandham and this last l and age that we're now in in the conclusion of every age it's written he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so the evidence of the Holy Ghost has not changed at all the evidence of the Holy Spirit has always been he that has an ear amen a predestinated ear a hunger a heart Amen to hear and a a predestinated representation to receive amen may I remind you of this also from the message who is this MDC brother bam said only the predestinated are considered in Redemption I said only the predestinated are even considered in Redemption redeem means to bring back and if you wasn't part of God if you wasn't in the Eternal thoughts of God if you wasn't in the hemoglobin of God the spiritual seed Gene Bank of God hallelujah then you'll never be there you'll never be a son or daughter of God but God thought of you God had Hallelujah this great all-sufficient one this great self-sufficient one this great self-existing one yet he had a need he needed you he had within him everything to produce and bring to pass this Great Divine Romance and this great love Union and love affair you see God is a man what yes in the evolution of God it shows that he was a man brother bad used the word Evolution there and he also talks about the evolution of God uh uh the evolution of the spirit of God justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit he sure not talking about Darwin's theory of evolution but it's it's the evolving it's the bringing forth and I'm here to tell you that God is still evolving tonight because we're part of his family we're his jeans his children Hallelujah God is a man God warned a family God's a father father he wanted a family God is a man he wanted a a bridegroom God is a man he's the author of Divine Romance all love he's the source of true love that great rainbow Fountain of love the seven colors God wanted a bride oh Hallelujah and he is has produced himself a bride Hallelujah in the midst of Satan's eeden a bride amen that is will not be deceived like that first Eve one that will be true one that proves to Satan's Eden in the midst of Satan's Eden proves to Satan that she will stand why oh my God help me to set this thing in order of my little message here tonight I'll come back to it maybe in conclusion let's go forward uh quote number four believe from the heart not from the head amen this is a very interesting quotation I was actually over in the Congo in a u one of our Distributors over there uh shared this quote with me as we was flying from deep into the Congo back into canasa many years ago but uh I'd never noticed it before listen to this it's very important and you can use any quote you want to to project the wrong thing but if we have the right revelation we know it will always bring glory to Jesus Christ is that right all right blessed Lord we could stay like those who stood on the mount that day and said it's good for us to be here and we would to build three Tabernacles put Pastors in each but the voice quickly turned and said hear ye him he's my son now let us turn from pastors from the Moses and the Elijah and from the great man of the earth although we're thankful for all of them but you said first the year him amen his word said this not the pastor's word neither the Evangelist whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive them you shall have them if you should say to this mountain be moved be cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say shall come to pass you shall have what you say not necessarily would it be momentarily neither was it momentarily with Abraham Sarah but you said if you believe that what you say shall come to pass you shall have what you say Amen you believe that now I want you to notice something in here and how many believes that brother Brenham was the Elijah that God promised to send to this day fulfilling Malachi 4 you really believe that and um Revelation 10:7 Etc we believe that sure but notice here oh my notice notice here such humility and and and he's putting the Holy Spirit through the prophet is putting the emphasis where the emphasis needs to be and we're going to come to that in the next quotation but notice right so there's something here that I'd like to emphasize tonight the Divine evidence of the Divine holy spirit is the ability to hear him okay hear ye him hear ye him now notice here brother bradam has been preaching about this subject on this particular tape that we're just now listening to or just listen to he he's been speaking on uh the mount Transfiguration experience and he also in another place said that every Christian ought to have a mount Transfiguration experience amen hallelujah and so when you have a true Mount Transfiguration experience you'll be coming down from that mountain saying hear ye him Hallelujah and you'll be pointing to him notice here Peter the man with the Keys of the Kingdom but before he got the baptism the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost see when he came down after being overshadowed by the cloud you know they're in the presence of Jesus but if you study uh Matthew Mark and also Luke has a different a little bit different uh rendition of this event study him all together sometime very interesting and uh Moses and Elijah was actually ministering to Jesus Christ there on that mountain pertaining to what he would accomplish in his death amen and so uh but nonetheless we see that while Peter was asleep the Bible says not knowing what he was saying he was kind of coming out of his sleep and and they were heavy with sleep the most important events Jesus suffered more in Gethsemane than he did on Calvary and when he was trying to get the people to stay awake and pray with him can't you wait one hour can't you pray one hour with me carry with me one hour and he come back and find him asleep oh it's time to shake ourselves folks I'm preaching to myself when I got my finger pointed out you I got three more pointing back at me it's time to wake up wake up asleep all of the church even the inner circle of Peter James and John which had went a little bit further in the Garden of Gethsemane went to sleep on Jesus at the most important time where he suffered more in Gethsemane than he did on Calvary and then here the most important event of the Transfiguration they were still asleep search the scriptures and you'll find that they were asleep and Peter then come out of the sleep kind of a little bit you know and they see this the cloud overshadowing and the voice speaking Etc but Peter got out of order Peter broke Church order on Mount Transfiguration he sure did and while Peter yet spake God spake now who was out of order Peter or God God don't interrupt God don't get out of order while Peter yet was speaking the Bible says God spoke God didn't get out of order Peter didn't know what he was saying the Bible says not knowing what he was saying let us build what was he saying let us build churches Jesus never commissioned anybody to build a church I know that might go down Crossways but it's still good for you swaller it I said Jesus said and the prophet of God reminded us of the fact that Jesus never did commission anybody to build a church you say brother Hughes well yeah we've got a nice church and I help build it and I've helped build several churches amen but that's not the main commission thank God for the church amen thank God for the churches brother Brandon built one amen and they and they built another and they they they renewed it and expanded it sure and he helped dedicate many churches but that was not the main commission G to say something stay with me see the main commission is preach the gospel power and demonstration as well as voice Amen Let God do that part whenever you do your part God will take care of the rest Jesus never did stress the works as much as he did the word because he knew if the church would get the word The Works would automatically follow the word demonstrates itself the signs automatically follow don't push the signs ahead right these signs shall follow don't try to push the signs ahead as the evidence no no no see gifts is wonderful but where there's gifts prophecy Etc they'll fail but perfect love will never fail and this perfect word will never fail is that right amen oh my that's one of the quotes here but here uh I want you to see how that he's saying let us turn now here he is knowing that his own office as an Elijah but let us turn from the elijas let us turn from the pastors and the Great Men of the earth oh how we'd like to build a tabernacle and put Pastors in each one of them he said amen oh yes and we've done that we've done that down through the years down through the decades we've did that build churches and put Pastors in them and thank God for the pastor now don't get in your mind or don't let the devil put a seed in your mind to think I'm against the true Pastor no no I'm for the true Pastor I'm for the True Church of the Living God but the main emphasis is what I want you to see let us turn from the Great Men of the earth as much as we appreciate them because you said hear ye him Hallelujah the main emphasis must be on the word of God because that is your evidence the main emphasis must be on the voice of God for your day the word the message for your day it takes the seed the message of the day to Quicken the predestinated seed of the day it takes the light the revelation of the message of your day to Quicken your seed to bring that seed to full maturity and to fruition and that's where that's what we're looking for is fruition and and trans ation oh God help us amen so here are some gifts you may have even got him a gift and uh he might have got you a Cadillac or a gold diamond ring who knows what he might have gotten you just to get your attention gifts gifts are wonderful but whenever it comes right down to the marriage on the day of the wedding that husband that bridegroom does not want you looking at the Cadillac and the and and all the other things and the gifts the main emphasis on the day of the wedding should be on The Giver of the gifts I said the main emphasis is not on the gifts the main emphasis is on him here ye him The Giver of all gifts right Satan was gifted he was so gifted he was co-equal with God in every respect except to be able to create Lucifer in heaven yes go listen to marriage and divorce if you don't believe it co-equal with God in every respect except to be able to create and he had all his power and wisdom and knowledge and uh he knew what pleased God he had perfect Church order and and he was leader of worship in the church Church Etc and he didn't lose any of that when he was cast out he kept all of his wisdom kept all his his gifts the gifts and callings of God are without repentance God will never take the gift away from you you don't repent for giv it to you he knew what you was going to do with it before he gave it to you you didn't have to repent to get it so don't depend on your gifts to justify yourself and don't depend in this church may you never look to manifestations of the spirit of God as your evidence Judas can produce Judas did produce all the different manifestations and the scripture says have we not cast out devils in thy name have we not done many great wonderful Works in thy name Jesus didn't deny that they hadn't done that amen let me tell you something the 70 were gifted they were Anointed with the message of the hour by the messenger of the hour e ordained ministers and 71 of them left the word only 11 stayed with the truth and the message of the hour it's a repeat I said it's a repeat that's not an easy thing it's certainly not a popular thing for a preacher to say but let me tell you something it has to be a repeat because the prophet of God taught it and he said the anointed ones of the end time would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if possible see is so very very close come preaching the M Judas had a knowledge of the Mysteries the prophet taught us oh yeah and in the message anointed ones the end time brother B said these anointed ones could not come forth until after the seals was opened so they have they're right in the message of the houry and handling the word of God deceitfully for their own benefit for their own gain building their own kingdom instead of building the kingdom of God Allelujah pointing to their own selves pointing to their own church instead of pointing to him here ye him oh my now we may have to build a church amen because we only got about six months over here left in this particular area we may have to and hey let's roll up our sleeves and go to It Whatever It Takes amen or or what however the Lord will provide don't be don't let nothing shake your faith Amen in god let's just go forward so we're not against churches and we're Ser God is how would God listen in in the same book here Paul Paul confirmed that these gifts were placed in the church and he confirmed that they were to they they the the in aable right to the church the gifts are God will never take a gift back that he gives amen it's the church's inalienable right the gifts not only the nine spiritual gifts but the five Ministry gifts are ordained of God and Paul confirmed that they were to remain in the church until the coming of the Lord so the gifts are part of God's program Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers are part of God's program they're God's dress Weare God hides himself and uses himself dresses himself in his ministry and they were given for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith amen and to the knowledge of the Son of God the statue of a perfect man and so forth and they're to remain in the church then amen till the coming of the Lord absolutely all right so don't get your thought that to think that brother Hugh is against the true five-fold Ministry but what I'm trying to emphasize here is the fact that if you put more emphasis on the gifts than you do the giver you're out of order especially in this hour when the wedding is come the marriage has come the Divine Romance is coming to its culmination this is the bride hath made herself ready this is the U the invisible Union of Christ and his bride it's here now it come right through this ministry the invisible Union amen is is here now the marriage is not uh in the future the marriage is here now and we only go to the wedding supper the prophet said in the message proving his word take notes write it down go listen to it he said we go to the wedding supper not the marriage we're United here hallelujah oh my that's pretty strong but it's the truth amen let's go forward uh and remember I I don't want to lose track of of of the time I have uh how many will give me 10 more minutes 10 20 30 40 50 60 oh my I can preach an hour put all those tens together okay but we want to consider uh we want to consider our time so you pray for me let's go forward here we go Church age book and uh I'll try to wrap it up after this okay we only go so far uh if I preach everything I knew tonight well you you wish you wouldn't be no need of me coming back would there you sure you wouldn't want me to come back all right watch this watch this outstanding quotation real closely now Church AGS book and uh I'll just read this because uh as we go forward now now we can see Jesus Christ is revealing himself Through the Ages by his Spirit In The Messengers okay they are as Moses was to the children of Israel as he had the Revelation for his day so each messenger had God's revelation and Ministry for that day thus when we see that the messengers are in his hand we see the Lord identifying himself with these men granting them his power it is not enough it is not enough okay everybody awake say Amen am it is not enough that he has Associated himself with the whole church which we saw when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden lampstands nor is it even enough are you awake nor is it even enough that we see the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4 Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors that's not enough that's not even enough okay what is enough brother Hughes what is enough brother brandom we got to have enough we got to have enough to get out of here we got to have enough for a translation stay with me now okay for in each age the church goes astray in each age where it's the bride age the wheed age the in in every age the Ephesian age the lean age in AG the church goes astray and it's not just the [Music] leoty but the clergy group what you mean preachers can be wrong shepherds are wrong as well as sheep somebody ought to say Amen then what happens what is enough brother brandom then Capital God God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and to the Abundant power of that truth God is in his people all of his people for If any man has not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and he is the word that would be the word recognized in the people but he has placed a special leadership in these men of his own choosing he's talking about the seven messengers of his own choosing see through these seven Messengers God brings himself on the scene see as the chief Shepherd amen through his own choosing and through the determined counsel of his own will will they appear once in each age amen it is the same spirit in them what a forec cry this is from the heresy of Rome they have a man of their own choosing one after the other nonproducing the power of God non abiding in the word of God each one differing from the one before him and adding where he desires as though he were God God is not in it but he is in his messenger and he who would have the fullness of God how many wants the fullness of God he who would have the fullness of God would follow the messenger as the messenger is a follower of the Lord by his word amen oh my again this is a time this is the time of the marriage oh my church listen to me the culmination of the marriage has come the bride hath made herself ready Revelations 197 the bride has made herself the the Lamb's wife okay not just a girlfriend the man and hey invisible Union and marriage and divorce put them together brother Braham said If a woman refuses a man a child he's got a right to put her away and get another one just like King orus did with vasy okay that's the Bible and that's the message and the church that re refuses to be pregnated by this word this message of the hour to produce word seeed Children of the Hour See Hallelujah okay then he also says this in this invisible Union it proves amen who she's United with be because of the children she's bringing forth see amen but when that lifegiving flow comes in the womb is sealed what womb the womb of your heart the womb of your mind the womb of your soul it's sealed by the revelation of Jesus Christ when you see the presence of this Chief Shepherd see I'm not talking about some Peruan doctrine of the past or this that or the other or some see Hey listen I'm not come here to for an offering I'm not come here for popularity I'm not here for women I'm here to point you to Jesus Christ I want you to fall in love with him and he he's the same yesterday today and forever he's here now he's here in his people he's here in Bride form amen the word is made flesh in the form of the Bride amen the same Ministry and everything has to repeat itself come right through this because she is him she is united with him in fact when that lifegiving flow of the word and the true Revelation comes into the individual amen that womb is sealed and there's no other seed can take hold let that be your heart let that be your mind this message is so great great my brother my sister amen we need to be feeding on it we need to be amen the transforming power of the word of God and it takes the spirit of God to Quicken the seed of the word see so let's pray God Quicken that seed let that seed be transformed every seed will bring forth of its own kind if you're a predestinated seed of God you have the full potential of God within you amen you have enough power in you to go create another world and live on it but of course it has to be guided and controlled by faith and time and season and the will of God Amen don't underestimate who you are believe Amen in Who You Are amen you are the bride you are the redeemed you are amen a child of God Amen may the Lord bless you I I wish somehow see I wish we had more time but I I just like to uh sometimes I I I preach on the a little subject on the mystery of marriage and then just show how that that and I know you know it it's all woven throughout the message so feed on the message amen I think uh all the answers I didn't come with the answers but I know the answers are in this message you just feed on the message amen God will open it up to you more and more and more amen I I'm I'm I'm getting ready to get out of here I want to get out of here my days are few and I I want to be sure amen that I I I've got the goods amen when I lay down I've got something in me that that seed has been gerti so it can come back up amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father such a attentive audience and Lord I'm sure it's been scattered uh but the holy spirit is able to put it together for us amen and I'm asking Lord that you will just minister to every heart now and if we've find ourselves maybe hearing other voices feeding on the wrong thing instead of hearing him you'd just Quicken that need to us Lord and give us a greater hunger greater desire than ever before with our heads bowed now our eyes closed in the light of these quotations tonight have you recognized the presence of the chief Shepherd he's Hebrews 13 [Music] and8 he's the one the prophet of God pointed to the last chapter of this church age book he said if I can accomplish one thing it's to establish a relationship between man and God to where they can hear the word of God feed on the word of God and manifest the spirit of God I've not come to point to myself or to my church or to start some new organization or something no but I've come to point to the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] with our heads bowed here tonight I know we've been challenged and that's The Minister's duty to challenge the people the prophet [Music] said they also said you evangelists never try to tell the pastor what to do and the pastors never tried to tell the prophet what to do there's an order but Lord you tell us all what to do may we all come to our place to our position come to church order you said let all things be done decently and in order may this little assembly lord always respect the the pastor and respect the office may they see the value of that office may they draw from it may they be edified as result May the love of God bind them together in such love to where nothing can separate them if a man has the spirit of God he'll have the action of God and the action of God never breaks us up the action of God always brings us together love one another oh Lord Jesus help us to fulfill that 11th commandment by this shall all men know that you're my disciple when you have that love one for another may we never speak evil of one another may we never try to kill one another's influence may we never be instruments of Satan to be used in the wrong [Music] way with our heads bowed and our eyes closed I want to ask you tonight I challenge you Search Your Heart this could be the very last service we'd ever have who knows the third world war is already escalating there's no de-escalating [Music] we've got our second Catholic President and we looks like we're maybe could have a third [Music] let's not put it off there's only one thing that will please God there's only one thing to bring displeasure to God and that's for us to leave the word there's only one remedy and that is back to the word to regain his favor is repentance and back to the word if you're here tonight and you realize you're lukewarm you're not where you should be feeding on this message like you should reading your Bible and praying like you should shame on you the prophet of God said that we ought to read chapter after chapter every [Music] day I'm not going to ask you to come to the altar I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand to me but I'm going to ask you to search your heart and lift your hand to the Lord if you realize you need to be drawn closer to him and you want a greater Revival in your home you want a greater Revival in your heart you want a greater Revival in your church defy gravity defy your own self your greatest enemy lift your hand and say Yes Lord I want to know how to pray and I want to pray more I want to know how to please you I want to know how to walk uprightly before for you I don't want to be as a rebellious House of Israel as you told Ezekiel but I want to feed on that which you've put before me son of man eat the scroll oh may we eat eat the book may we feed on the book and may we become the book written Epistles written and read of all men it's an open book help us father Lord Jesus you see the hands that have gone up you see the hearts that are underneath those [Music] hands May the Holy Spirit just create a greater hunger and a greater thirst and a greater desire than ever before and then come and satisfy that longing Hallelujah bringing us into that spiritual union that spiritual relationship with you granted father May these few words that was spoken tonight though they're kind of Lord I'm nervous and upset and different things but father you're able to put it together may you help [Music] us may the main emphasis Lord be upon the great Giver the greatest gift God could give a man outside of Salvation is a good wife vice versa the greatest gift God could give a woman outside of a Salvation is a good husband but Lord may we never put those gifts ahead of The Giver may you be first place in our hearts and lives father why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to get this great Revelation to you but you let some Pastor keep it from you you let your job keep it from you you let your husband you let your wife you let your family keep it from [Music] you oh Lord we want to put it all aside now and put you first forgive us Lord of anything that has got between you and us we don't
