[25:38] scripture and
[25:42] um this day in
[25:46] 1961 brother Brandon was concluding the
[25:49] church Age series and according to the
[25:51] voice of God website they said at the
[25:54] end of the service was when that Pillar
[25:57] of Fire came into the room and Drew out
[26:00] the uh Church ages on the back wall
[26:03] there it's a three-hour message we'll
[26:06] listen to a portion of it today but or
[26:08] this evening and if you want to go back
[26:10] and listen to you'll hear Brother bam in
[26:14] the service there's people being healed
[26:16] there's people shouting the Praises and
[26:19] he talks about a shadow appearing on
[26:22] there it's really a beautiful uh
[26:25] conclusion cuz he started that message
[26:27] in De December of 1960 12 or 13 sermons
[26:31] later it carries him over into the new
[26:34] year and he's wrapping up Revelations
[26:37] chapter 4 and he's going to go on a uh
[26:40] uh Evangelistic tour so he's kind of
[26:43] admonishing the church and uh has a
[26:46] small prayer line and then the Lord
[26:48] vindicates it all with this uh appearing
[26:51] there the pillar of fire and he speaks
[26:54] about it in this message
[26:56] here we would see Jesus paragraph number
[27:00] nine I'd like to read that to you they
[27:02] can get that for
[27:05] me
[27:07] he's um I believe he's in California he
[27:11] says now you know it's told
[27:13] us that the day when the Lord come it
[27:16] would be kind of unexpected and the
[27:19] church would be cooling off and I just
[27:21] got finished at my Tabernacle at home
[27:25] with the seven last Church ages and it's
[27:28] coming out it's on tape now and it's I
[27:31] took each Church age each night made the
[27:34] seven Church ages the seven last the
[27:37] candlesticks and the Seven messengers of
[27:39] the church ages and I of all I'm not
[27:42] much of a Preacher but all that I every
[27:46] effort I put forth for the Lord in all
[27:49] my life I don't believe ever was as
[27:53] effective as that was for as soon as I
[27:56] come down and not knowing what to draw
[27:59] these Church ages on the Blackboard
[28:01] showing just how much the Holy Spirit
[28:03] come in the Ephesus Church age and then
[28:06] on down to theuring and pergamus and the
[28:09] terror and on out and if that angel of
[28:12] the Lord that light had come right in
[28:14] before 300 people moved itself right
[28:18] over on the wall and draw with that
[28:21] round light just the way I draw the
[28:24] churches and showed exactly the same
[28:27] depths and everything as it went through
[28:30] while 300 people screaming and crying
[28:33] and looking at it on the side of the
[28:35] wall while it stood out here and
[28:38] reflected itself on the wall and made
[28:41] the same thing and they got it draw now
[28:46] on in pictures and it's standing in the
[28:48] Tabernacle Mr arganbright our dear
[28:50] precious brother has just left up there
[28:53] and went up to look at it where it was
[28:56] at on the wall amen praise the Lord so
[28:59] that's the me part of the message we're
[29:00] going to hear tonight I know it'll be a
[29:03] blessing to you let's take our Bibles
[29:05] and read because uh brother Ram kind of
[29:07] goes through the scriptures throughout
[29:09] and I just like you to maybe read it for
[29:12] yourself to get a context Revelations CH
[29:14] 4 veres
[29:16] 1-4 we'll read
[29:21] that
[29:24] amen and after these after this I looked
[29:28] and behold a door was open in heaven and
[29:32] the first voice which I heard was as it
[29:34] were of a trumpet talking with me which
[29:37] said come up hither and I will show you
[29:40] the things which must be Hereafter and
[29:44] immediately I was in the spirit and
[29:47] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[29:49] one sat on the throne and he that sat
[29:53] was to look upon like Jasper and sardin
[29:56] stone and there was a rainbow about the
[29:58] throne in sight like unto emerald and
[30:01] around about The Throne there were four
[30:03] and 20 seats upon the seats I saw four
[30:07] and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white
[30:10] rment and they had on their heads crowns
[30:13] of gold and out of the throne preceded
[30:16] Lightnings and thunderings and voices
[30:19] and there were seven lamps of
[30:21] fire burning Before the Throne which are
[30:24] the seven spirits of God Amen brother is
[30:28] going to go into that I think the
[30:29] portion of the message that we'll hear
[30:31] tonight will he will get into that so we
[30:33] trust the Lord to be a blessing to you

[35:48] the um we called one in bont and Ben
[35:51] they had 42 churches in cooperation of
[35:55] the United Pentecostals and so forth we
[35:57] thought with the big Auditorium be
[35:59] better to give them about 10 days
[36:02] instead of giving five and five of each
[36:04] place I think if you centralize it like
[36:06] that it's better and there's a lot of of
[36:09] needy people around in bont and down
[36:12] through that oral part of Texas there
[36:15] and so we're expecting a great time in
[36:17] bman and now we never try to go over
[36:20] these big centers and big places but we
[36:23] try to go as the Lord will lead us to go
[36:26] no matter how little how big just so the
[36:29] Lord is leading now at any time he could
[36:32] give us a Macedonian call and we'd leave
[36:35] the feeld at any time for whatever he'
[36:37] called us to do
[36:39] anywhere and we sure have enjoyed this
[36:42] time of Fellowship around the word of
[36:45] God with you fine
[36:48] people I trust that you'll be faithful
[36:50] now and come to church and obey the
[36:53] teachings of the Bible through our
[36:56] Gallant brother here brother Neville
[36:58] which I highly recommend as a servant of
[37:01] the Lord God and moving on deeper and
[37:05] deeper with God and I'm so happy for
[37:08] that and the little church I bonish you
[37:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus to grow in
[37:13] the grace of God hold yourself steady
[37:16] and look towards Calvary all the time
[37:19] amen taking all the roots of bitterness
[37:21] out of your heart and soul that God
[37:23] might use you at any time if you ever
[37:26] feel to do something or a revelation or
[37:28] something comes to you
[37:30] strangely something warningly or
[37:32] something be careful Satan is a slim
[37:36] slick as he can be see put it with the
[37:39] word of God and consult your pastor see
[37:42] and you find gifts and so forth creeping
[37:44] up in the church and the operation of
[37:46] these gifts before you let it go to
[37:48] operating and think first feel it
[37:51] pressing on your heart now the enem is
[37:54] real slick see and that's just what ter
[37:57] the churches the pieces every time is a
[38:00] true gift operated wrong see something
[38:03] God's trying to do and operated wrong
[38:05] it'll just it'll just simply not only
[38:07] hurt you but it'll tear the whole church
[38:09] up see consult it take it through and
[38:12] through the Bible then test it and see
[38:14] if it's God or not just keep testing it
[38:16] and trying see if it's perfect right
[38:18] down the line and right with the word
[38:20] then you're all right see as long as a
[38:22] word has said it would be here would
[38:24] operate this certain way stay right with
[38:27] it
[38:28] don't never get off no matter what
[38:29] anybody does how real it seems to be if
[38:32] it doesn't reflect in the scriptures
[38:35] from Genesis the revelations leave it
[38:37] alone amen don't take no chances we're
[38:39] in the last days when Satan is just
[38:42] deceiving as he can
[38:44] be forgive me if I try to take a place
[38:47] of a boss I'm no boss but I feel you
[38:50] like Paul said back to everybody's
[38:52] congregation mons you're the stars in my
[38:55] crown when I cross over over the land
[38:58] over on the other side down and meet you
[38:59] in that glorified condition I want you
[39:02] to stand there to shine like a stars in
[39:05] am and I I want you to be there I want
[39:08] to be there I remember in my vision when
[39:11] I seen the presence of the Lord or his
[39:14] people in that glorious land y I looked
[39:17] around I told them and they told me he
[39:19] would judge me first by the gospel that
[39:21] I preach I said just exactly the way
[39:24] Paul preached it and then millions of
[39:26] people screamed out we're resting on
[39:29] that see now I want it to be so and we
[39:33] are going to meet there
[39:36] someday and God never sent brother
[39:39] Neville and I to be bosses not at all
[39:42] we're just your brothers you see
[39:44] instructors in the gospel so let all
[39:47] work together and sometime if a if
[39:49] something operating has to be called or
[39:52] or said something about it called down
[39:54] or something on that order and the
[39:56] person that's got that gift rejects it
[39:59] just remember refuses it remember the
[40:02] gift wasn't right it wasn't God in the
[40:04] first place the spirit of God always is
[40:07] ready for correction sweet humble well
[40:11] see if it stands up and say I'll do it
[40:13] any how you know how sometime just
[40:15] remember arrogant Spirits are not of God
[40:18] see so why take a substitute when
[40:21] everything the whole Earth is filled
[40:24] with the glory of God you see real power
[40:28] of God why will we take a subtitute amen
[40:31] we're too late in the day now but
[40:33] remember the Bible said he come in like
[40:36] a just as Sly as he could be and deceive
[40:39] the very elected if possible thing and
[40:44] now sometimes we think we are the
[40:45] elected and I hope we are but let's just
[40:49] stay right straight with the Bible and
[40:50] then if everything is right with the
[40:52] scripture ordering the scripture
[40:53] bringing glory to God and the honor of
[40:55] the church and so forth then we know
[40:58] that it is of god because the Bible
[41:00] backs it up but just our Theory won't
[41:02] back it up it won't do no good it falls
[41:04] through so then if something has struck
[41:07] us no matter how real it seems if it's
[41:09] not right not scriptural get rid of it
[41:11] right now there's a real one waiting you
[41:14] see so pray now always and whatever you
[41:18] do pray for me pray for me go we're now
[41:22] striking the fields for the last times
[41:24] in my opinion we're now going
[41:28] and remember great things are taking
[41:30] place it's unknown amongst the world
[41:34] Jesus come lived died and sacrificed
[41:37] went back to glory and millions never
[41:38] even know nothing about it yeah it's not
[41:41] flowerly great big it's he came to his
[41:46] own see the he that has an ear let him
[41:50] hear what the spirit said to the
[41:52] churches not to the outside to the
[41:55] church amen it's the church that gets it
[41:59] shaking I used to think different from
[42:01] that the one day he spoke to me had me
[42:04] to go back in the word and think of how
[42:07] that the prophets all spoke of when John
[42:09] came said the high places will be made
[42:11] low and the Low Places made high and how
[42:14] the power of God would work know the all
[42:17] the mountains would skip like little
[42:18] Rams and the leaves would clap their
[42:20] hands well that looked like it something
[42:22] really was going to take place see and
[42:25] when it did what happened an old fell
[42:28] come out of the
[42:29] Wilderness probably beard grow all out
[42:32] an old piece of sheep skin wrapped
[42:33] around him there was no conveniences out
[42:35] there in the wilderness he been there
[42:36] since he 9 years old and he 30 then come
[42:40] walking out of the Wilderness stomping
[42:41] out preaching repentance standing mud to
[42:44] his knees probably on the banks of the
[42:45] jarden that's when the high places is
[42:48] made low and the Low Places made High
[42:51] see it's you have to have spiritual
[42:54] understanding remember God never did and
[42:58] never will on this Earth dwell in
[43:01] glamour he's against
[43:03] it he'll never the great messages will
[43:06] never be make great big so and so and so
[43:09] don't do that way his servants don't
[43:12] work in that manner his Glamour and
[43:14] glory is of above amen yesterday or two
[43:18] days ago going out to
[43:21] Kentucky up in Kentucky with my good
[43:23] friend brother Banks Woods there was a
[43:26] woman policeman standing out there and
[43:28] he said boy we better slow down and said
[43:30] she's rough and I said yeah that's
[43:35] right I said when a nation gets to a
[43:38] place where millions are employed and
[43:39] they have to take women make policemen
[43:41] and send them out there in cab drivers
[43:43] and things like that it's one of the
[43:45] great stains on our
[43:47] nation she's got just about as much
[43:49] business out there as
[43:51] uh is a rabbit's gotten a kid of Grease
[43:55] see it just it just just not a place and
[43:59] I said that used to bother me so bad but
[44:02] now I begin to remember why no wonder
[44:06] this is this is not our kingdom we're
[44:09] not of this world they you why don't
[44:12] women our women wear their their hair
[44:16] short and makeups and rock and rolls and
[44:19] all this stuff well people go to
[44:21] ordinary churches and things think
[44:23] that's all right why they they are
[44:26] Americans
[44:28] they are Americans got American Spirit
[44:30] we're not
[44:32] Americans we're
[44:34] Christians we live our spirit is of
[44:36] another kingdom if our spirit was of
[44:38] this Kingdom then we would worship with
[44:40] these things and would worship all these
[44:42] vulgar songs and worship all this rock
[44:44] and roll wherever your heart is there
[44:46] your Treasures is and our Treasures is
[44:49] above so therefore we're going to a
[44:52] kingdom this is not our home we're just
[44:55] sojourning here trying to bring other
[44:58] citizens out of the darkness and go into
[45:01] a city and maybe hold a Citywide
[45:04] campaign just plow away for a week or 10
[45:07] days for one precious soul out there one
[45:11] amen just one sitting out there you
[45:12] might say the meeting was a great
[45:15] success 5,000 came to the altar it might
[45:18] not be one of them saved not a one of
[45:21] them see and there might be you might
[45:24] think only two people can't all but one
[45:26] of them might be a jewel we just singing
[45:29] in the creek God picks out the fish he
[45:32] knows which is fish and which is not so
[45:34] see we're just preaching and remember
[45:37] you're doing the same thing in this
[45:40] Tabernacle but remember always this my
[45:43] sheep know my
[45:45] voice and the voice of God is his
[45:49] word I was thinking other day how these
[45:51] people says that there never was certain
[45:55] denomination churches saying Divine
[45:57] Healing wasn't right never was nobody
[45:59] given a gift of Divine Healing but St
[46:02] Paul or the apostles the 12 in the upper
[46:05] room is giving the gift of Divine
[46:07] Healing that was all that settled it but
[46:10] you see through this wonderful chart the
[46:12] brother Willie over here so marvelously
[46:14] fixed up for us that little thread has
[46:18] been through the churches all the way I
[46:21] wonder what that same denomination says
[46:23] about the history of the church about
[46:26] irenius
[46:29] about St
[46:30] Martin and all those Martyrs down
[46:33] through the age for hundreds of years
[46:35] after the death of the Apostles spoke in
[46:37] tongues and heal the sick and raised the
[46:39] dead and performed Miracles the whole
[46:42] church amen wonder what about them it
[46:44] was only through the apostles see how
[46:46] narrow it is they don't have spiritual
[46:49] understanding that's all blind dead and
[46:53] sin and trespasses sin means unbelief
[46:57] anything in unbelief is sin if a fell
[47:00] got a a title that long with DD L PhD
[47:05] lld D and says there's no such a thing
[47:07] as Divine Healing or baptism of the Holy
[47:09] Ghost a man dead in sin he might be able
[47:12] to explain all kinds of mysteries in the
[47:14] Bible but his very life his testimony
[47:17] proves that he's dead he's dead in sin
[47:20] and trespasses because he's a sinner sin
[47:24] is unbelief anybody
[47:27] sin isn't committing adultery and
[47:30] smoking cigarettes and dancing and
[47:32] carrying on like that that isn't sin
[47:34] that's the attributes of
[47:36] unbelief but a Believer no matter if a
[47:40] man don't drink don't smoke don't do
[47:42] these things never said a bad word keeps
[47:44] all the Ten Commandments he can still be
[47:46] a black
[47:48] sinner see this as rank as he can be if
[47:51] he denies anything of the power of God
[47:54] he's a sinner the word sin is unbel
[47:56] believe now you just fine and see if
[47:59] that's right or not an unbeliever in the
[48:01] word of God he is a
[48:04] sinner cannot enter the kingdom of
[48:07] heaven now oh I thought then this
[48:11] morning taking it up all myself by the
[48:14] will of the Lord by the Commandment of
[48:16] the Holy Spirit to come down to the
[48:18] Tabernacle again and maybe keep you all
[48:21] two or three hours but I want to finish
[48:25] the book of the fourth chapter of
[48:27] Revelations before go amen and now I
[48:31] hope it's not wearisome to you I hope
[48:33] it's it's glory to you I hope it's
[48:35] something that'll do you good and help
[48:38] you in the days ahead to
[48:41] come and now maybe I told Billy to come
[48:45] down here this morning and to give out
[48:47] prayer cards if there was any strangers
[48:51] in our midst because uh we'll be leaving
[48:55] and now I don't know when we'll be back
[48:58] God only knows that and I wanted thought
[49:00] maybe the last meeting if and when he
[49:03] called me up then about uh about 9:00
[49:06] and said dad there's some people there
[49:09] to be prayed for I've asked them but
[49:11] said it's people that uh people that
[49:14] comes to church all the time I said then
[49:16] don't give out any prayer cards see I
[49:18] said because as people we have prayer
[49:20] for the six morning we call people up
[49:21] and pray for them but I said if it uh
[49:24] it's people that comes to Tabernacle
[49:26] that we no I want some
[49:29] stranger and he said then he come out
[49:31] there a few minutes ago when he met me
[49:32] stand out there said well I gave out
[49:35] some prayer cards said just a few in
[49:37] there I gave prayer cards out said you
[49:39] can do whatever you want to I said well
[49:41] we'll see how the message gets along see
[49:43] where we're at and then we'll go he said
[49:46] well many of the people wanted prayer
[49:48] cards of course but said they were
[49:50] people that's there in the church see
[49:53] well we know that God is God and M just
[49:55] the things does why they the phone rings
[50:00] all time of people of different things
[50:02] just little bitty things sometime and
[50:03] how God answers prayer amen I wonder if
[50:06] that little lady or her husband here
[50:08] from down in new Al they brought that
[50:10] little choked out baby the other night
[50:12] with pneumonia in my house about 12
[50:15] 1:00 fine how is the
[50:18] baby fine good all right just let me
[50:23] show you see it's something that you
[50:24] wouldn't know going to go on when the
[50:25] Holy Spirit speaks Fred sofman our
[50:28] precious brother Fred I heard him say
[50:30] Amen a while ago but I couldn't Place
[50:31] him out where's he at is he here here
[50:34] right here brother Fred Stopman know
[50:36] this show how simple it
[50:37] is he had some friends coming which is
[50:40] brother Welch Evans I presume I don't
[50:42] know they had a trailer there that
[50:44] locked the doors and Fred lost the keys
[50:46] and been looking everywhere and couldn't
[50:48] find them anywhere and brother Welch is
[50:50] coming right on up so the day come that
[50:53] he was to arrive and things he couldn't
[50:55] find the key anywhere so he just called
[50:56] called up
[50:58] home so brother BR where is the keys at
[51:02] where would we find him now that might
[51:05] stump some of you for a man to ask a
[51:07] question like that but wait just a
[51:10] minute remember the sons of Jesse
[51:12] looking for the
[51:14] mules so if I had a gift in my hand I'd
[51:17] take it down and ask give it to the
[51:19] prophet and maybe he'd tell us where
[51:21] those mules were remember that and while
[51:24] he's walking on the street they met the
[51:26] prophet
[51:27] he said you're looking for them mules
[51:29] said there you going back home and said
[51:32] they've already returned is that right I
[51:35] prayed Fred walked over and picked up
[51:37] the keys amen that's it
[51:41] see brother Ed Dalton where you
[51:44] at where's Ed Dalton I know he's here
[51:46] somewhere I seen him a while ago oh back
[51:49] in there he is you heard me through the
[51:51] inom or the public address system the
[51:54] other night A call came in and brother
[51:56] Ed was in serious trouble I want to help
[51:59] him nope said I just wants you to ask
[52:02] God I asked the Lord to help him and
[52:04] next day his wife called up somebody
[52:07] come to the Rescue all right that right
[52:10] brother man
[52:11] see he's just God that's all he's just
[52:15] God see just it's just all the time
[52:17] constantly from one place to another one
[52:20] place to another no matter what trouble
[52:21] it is he's
[52:23] God we don't go around brag about those
[52:25] things we're not supposed to just don't
[52:29] let the right hand or left hand know
[52:30] what the right hand's doing we talking
[52:32] among ourselves but we don't blast that
[52:34] out somewhere because that self- Pride
[52:38] like God only could do it for one person
[52:40] he' do it for anybody it'll believing
[52:43] it's belief Faith whatever whatever you
[52:46] want to do whatever your thoughts are
[52:48] take it to God he he he he provides
[52:50] everything isn't that right so he
[52:53] answers prayer he's a God is a prayer
[52:57] answering father amen now so therefore
[53:01] in I thought closing in this last
[53:03] meetings and so forth as we were as
[53:05] we're doing we would we would have maybe
[53:08] some of the discernment at the last of
[53:10] the meeting if the Lord willing and
[53:13] maybe during the time of the meeting we
[53:14] just don't know what he's going to do I
[53:16] like it that way don't set no certain
[53:18] things just let him do as he wants to do
[53:21] now get the fourth chapter of the Book
[53:24] of
[53:25] Revelations and off the clock
[53:31] amen yes yes
[53:36] [Music]
[53:40] brother certainly I believe that
[53:43] absolutely believe here brother Welsh
[53:46] Evans I think that's him sitting right
[53:48] back there let me while we're turning to
[53:50] Revelations 4 you're not long ago you
[53:53] all heard and read in the papers about
[53:55] this band and loable it steals these
[53:57] cars takes them down to Kentucky
[53:59] somewhere real quick and in Kentucky you
[54:03] don't even have to have a tile they'll
[54:04] make you one in Kentucky so you just the
[54:07] only thing have to say want and sell it
[54:09] so they'll take these cars and run them
[54:10] in and repain them again and bring those
[54:14] cars out and sell them all you have to
[54:16] have is your number your block and
[54:18] they'll make you a title so they just
[54:20] take a car off the street get it off
[54:21] real quick and run to some shop
[54:22] somewhere just change the whole thing
[54:24] over all together see and um and uh
[54:27] repaint it and everything take it out
[54:29] and sell it there's a racket of it and
[54:31] especially all over the United States
[54:32] and a great great of it in Kentucky I
[54:35] read an article in paper here not long
[54:37] ago about it well big good-hearted
[54:41] precious brother Evans and his family
[54:43] driving all the way from Mak Georgia up
[54:46] here every Sunday to hear the gospel oh
[54:50] how loyal and what real friends then he
[54:53] goes over to Miller's cafeteria where
[54:56] I'm not plugging for Millers but I
[54:58] certainly think that they got the best
[55:00] food in Kentucky Louisville Kentucky
[55:03] anyhow as far i a mean you private homes
[55:06] I've eat in over there now I mean for
[55:08] you know outside and um I eat over there
[55:12] too I can feed my family there cheaper
[55:15] and I can feed them at home that's right
[55:17] so then I go in over there and so
[55:20] brother Evans he goes in and he gets him
[55:22] something to eat and Parks his car out
[55:24] there when he comes out with all all his
[55:26] clothes the family and all them he
[55:28] didn't have no car or nothing it was all
[55:31] gone well poor fell brother Evans is a
[55:34] man like all of us he has a little
[55:36] business down there he works on cars
[55:38] buys wrecks and picks them up he's a
[55:41] poor man spends his money coming up here
[55:44] because he believes in this type of
[55:45] gospel I'm praying that God will send
[55:48] him a messenger down there somewhere to
[55:50] help him down in that country
[55:53] now brother Evans come up so he didn't
[55:56] what to do he notified police they
[55:58] couldn't find it so he come over home he
[56:01] and brother Fred and then we sat in the
[56:03] room and talked about I said now that's
[56:05] the way we do we sit in the room find
[56:07] out what takes place then we go to God
[56:10] so when we ask the Lord to turn the man

[1:01:57] now in the fourth chapter of the Book of
[1:02:00] Revelations we ended up the third
[1:02:03] chapter and let us kind of be reverently
[1:02:08] and I'll try not to keep you too long
[1:02:11] but in this third chapter the church
[1:02:15] went up as a type when John was taken up
[1:02:18] the church went up and from that time on
[1:02:22] it's dealing with Israel until the
[1:02:26] coming again don't you see how it is the
[1:02:30] people today how they're great something
[1:02:34] going to shake the whole world and
[1:02:36] everything that's
[1:02:40] unscriptural no sir the next thing in
[1:02:43] order is the going of the
[1:02:47] church reading the church ages you see
[1:02:50] what now these other things is to take
[1:02:52] place is during the time of the wedding
[1:02:55] ceremony when the church is in glory god
[1:02:58] returns back with great wonders to
[1:02:59] perform
[1:03:01] International uh Miracles and Things by
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] Jews don't go to the church at all on
[1:03:08] the third chapter ends up the church age
[1:03:11] that's right in the church age goes out
[1:03:14] with such a little bitty minority that
[1:03:17] we find just listen here I I read this
[1:03:20] again this morning it just nearly tore
[1:03:22] me to
[1:03:24] Pieces the place and the attitude of
[1:03:28] Christ at the end of the church age
[1:03:31] found from the 21st to 22nd verse of
[1:03:35] Revelations 3 think of it Christ at the
[1:03:39] end where he's at where is at the end of
[1:03:41] the church AG outside his
[1:03:44] church pushed out by denominations
[1:03:48] Creeds what's his attitude trying to get
[1:03:51] back
[1:03:53] in that's a pitiful condition
[1:03:56] then we find out here after these things
[1:03:59] you heard a voes speaking to him the was
[1:04:01] it the spirit left the
[1:04:03] Earth after these things starts out the
[1:04:06] first chapter uh of the first verse
[1:04:08] after this I looked and behold a door
[1:04:11] was open in heaven Revelations
[1:04:14] 41 after the church was gone then a a
[1:04:19] door was open and we went through all
[1:04:21] that and founded that was Christ was the
[1:04:23] door and the same voice that was walking
[1:04:26] in the midst of the seven golden
[1:04:27] candlesticks also was the same voice he
[1:04:30] heard in heaven saying come up hither
[1:04:34] John went up that represented the church
[1:04:37] going in the Rapture John went up in the
[1:04:41] spirit was tuck away into heaven and
[1:04:45] foresaw all the things that God promised
[1:04:49] and said to the disciples what is it to
[1:04:52] you if he teres till I come he saw the
[1:04:54] coming of of the Lord and what would
[1:04:58] take place he saw on Earth what would
[1:05:00] take place on Earth to the Rapture of
[1:05:02] the church was taken up and show come on
[1:05:03] down even to a pass
[1:05:06] Millennium oh isn't that
[1:05:09] wonderful now we left him last Sunday on
[1:05:13] the fourth chapter and the fourth
[1:05:16] verse and round about The Throne were 4
[1:05:19] and 20 seats and upon the seats I Saw 4
[1:05:22] and 20 Elders sitting clothed in white
[1:05:25] Rond and they
[1:05:26] had on their heads crowns of gold now we
[1:05:30] found out that these were
[1:05:33] Elders an elder is never applied to an
[1:05:37] angel or any being it is a redeemed
[1:05:43] human
[1:05:45] being Elders because the
[1:05:48] Thrones crowns
[1:05:51] dominions is never referred to to Angels
[1:05:56] but the crowns and Thrones so forth
[1:06:00] pertain to human
[1:06:02] beings and these Elders was crowned and
[1:06:05] clothed and setting on Thrones and we
[1:06:08] found them over other parts of the
[1:06:10] scripture that they were uh the 12
[1:06:14] apostles and they were the 12
[1:06:18] Patriarchs 24 of them which means 24 12
[1:06:22] Apostles 12 Patriarchs we found even the
[1:06:24] city that descends from God out of
[1:06:27] heaven after the Earth is exploded and
[1:06:31] all gone to pieces and nothing left on
[1:06:34] the Earth but volcanic ashes that's all
[1:06:37] will be left there will be no more seed
[1:06:40] the sealed
[1:06:42] r i speaking last night to someone or
[1:06:44] yesterday and
[1:06:45] somewhere um the earth once stood up
[1:06:48] like this right around the Sun equal
[1:06:51] heat all the way up and down up in
[1:06:53] British ice Fields you can blast down
[1:06:55] there 500 ft and find
[1:06:57] Palms it comes suddenly Frozen like uh
[1:07:01] Refrigeration now like you're uh
[1:07:04] dehydrating and so forth and you freeze
[1:07:07] and deep freezes and keep strawberries
[1:07:09] and things for years and years and years
[1:07:10] to come see that's the same way it was
[1:07:13] in that time quickly that come an anel
[1:07:15] luian destruction and flooded the whole
[1:07:18] earth over and what it did Atomic Powers
[1:07:21] rocked it out of its orbits and it froze
[1:07:24] over and there she lay
[1:07:27] dig down in confin them up around the
[1:07:29] Arctic zones and things palm trees and
[1:07:31] so forth showed that it was once
[1:07:33] inhabited beautifully set up and now it
[1:07:36] shook back now where I think God got
[1:07:38] that water when the Genesis starts
[1:07:41] Genesis 1 the Earth was without form and
[1:07:44] void and water was up on the Deep the
[1:07:48] spirit of God moved up on the water and
[1:07:50] said let there be light God separated
[1:07:53] them the land and the water which made
[1:07:55] the Earth Earth but the whole earth was
[1:07:56] covered over now what he did he just
[1:07:59] through the atmosphere he just
[1:08:01] atmosphere is atmospheres is filled with
[1:08:05] hydrogen and oxygen and so forth then he
[1:08:08] just lifted it
[1:08:10] up off the Earth and separated it there
[1:08:13] was no Sea on the earth then God watered
[1:08:15] the Earth didn't he come rains he
[1:08:17] watered it through Springs and things
[1:08:20] irrigation then when he only thing he
[1:08:23] did then when man bloated out its orbit
[1:08:26] out to one side what happened it thred
[1:08:29] it back in the heat down here and the
[1:08:33] cold up there and hot and cold what
[1:08:36] accumulate on them windows right now hot
[1:08:38] in here and cold outside see the sweat
[1:08:40] and rain is nothing but sweat
[1:08:44] respiration and water is ashes and so
[1:08:49] then when it I like that song you laid
[1:08:53] your hand precious Lord on on the
[1:08:56] Prairies laid your wonderful hand on the
[1:08:59] rain Lord you poured forth the fountain
[1:09:02] raised up the mountain oh Lord keep your
[1:09:05] precious hand on me you made the clouds
[1:09:10] form the clouds that made the rain from
[1:09:12] the rain made the sea from the sea
[1:09:15] brought the clouds that give us life
[1:09:17] abundantly you hold the earth and the
[1:09:20] skies in your command Lord oh please
[1:09:23] keep your precious hand on on me oh how
[1:09:27] great
[1:09:29] yes the god of heaven then in this great
[1:09:32] time is leaning back like this now and
[1:09:36] he made us a promise no more water but
[1:09:39] fire this time instead of throwing they
[1:09:42] throw the Earth away from the Sun of
[1:09:44] course it got cold if you throw it into
[1:09:47] the sun it'll
[1:09:49] burn and just as he destroy it with
[1:09:52] water and put the boy in the sky
[1:09:54] wouldn't do it no more now I give
[1:09:55] promise he'd burn it so there you come
[1:09:58] we're sin and all Glamour and all filth
[1:10:02] and not long ago I was riding down
[1:10:04] through the prair a little boy I used to
[1:10:06] think get my history books and
[1:10:08] geographies and think of the Great
[1:10:09] Western Plains someday I said I'll live
[1:10:11] there peacefully and quiet where there's
[1:10:14] no sin and I'll roam the fields and I'll
[1:10:17] hunt like the Indian I I'll live there a
[1:10:19] peaceful life all the days of my life
[1:10:21] but now it's white man's been there
[1:10:25] where white man goes sin is with him he
[1:10:29] is the biggest murderer and killer of
[1:10:32] all the people on the Earth is a white
[1:10:34] man he's a renegade of all
[1:10:37] colors here not long ago in the paper
[1:10:41] brother Tom here from
[1:10:42] Africa um I seen a piece in the paper
[1:10:46] two weeks ago I believe it was and he
[1:10:49] said they said if the Americans are
[1:10:52] still permitted to go to Africa and 10
[1:10:55] years so now the great African line will
[1:10:57] be completely
[1:10:59] distinct the elephants the Renegades
[1:11:02] shoot just anywhere he can picture of
[1:11:04] two big males trying to hold a wounded
[1:11:06] male up look like tears running from her
[1:11:08] eyes they didn't want the males didn't
[1:11:09] want the female die and each one holding
[1:11:11] by her side like this keep her from
[1:11:13] falling down to her to the ground just
[1:11:15] shop to Pieces a guy to shoot anything
[1:11:18] like that don't deserve to have a gun in
[1:11:20] his hand right you ain't got gumption
[1:11:23] enough to handle it a couple years ago
[1:11:26] trying to run some herd elk into my good
[1:11:29] friend brother Roy Roberson then back
[1:11:31] there what a guiding up in Colorado know
[1:11:33] we had a nice herd Jeff and I had him up
[1:11:35] there for years and years about 80 head
[1:11:37] elk and a herd let some of these office
[1:11:40] guys out of Denver come out there these
[1:11:42] blouse pants on Lace Lake Dam
[1:11:45] Hunters you they come up there bunching
[1:11:48] jeeps and things like I got back in our
[1:11:50] territory there and I was driving these
[1:11:52] elk across the mountain behind him about
[1:11:54] a mile or two in this hurting along you
[1:11:56] have to keep them thinned out the big
[1:11:58] old bulls and things so don't you break
[1:11:59] your herd up just like raising cattle or
[1:12:02] anything while life should be the same
[1:12:04] to us it's not a Target going to shoot
[1:12:07] Target that got range out here to shoot
[1:12:08] them on right it's a disgrace to butcher
[1:12:11] up things like that it's sinful it's
[1:12:14] ungodly and I counted 123
[1:12:18] shots out of machine guns like faring
[1:12:21] from the shoulders and the next morning
[1:12:23] brother Banks wood chair with me went up
[1:12:25] on a mountain I counted 19 bloody
[1:12:28] beds didn't know nothing about hunting
[1:12:31] you shoot a big animal like that you
[1:12:32] might hit him deep enough to kill him
[1:12:34] they just turn bang bang bang shoot one
[1:12:36] then the other why they'll
[1:12:38] die why after the fever sets in them if
[1:12:41] youd find them they're no good they
[1:12:43] spoil right away and the Scavengers
[1:12:45] coyotes and things eat them up 19 bloody
[1:12:48] bed big bulls hoofs that big around and
[1:12:50] blood spting out two feet we been
[1:12:52] punctured like that with them guns they
[1:12:54] ought to allow a renegade like that to
[1:12:56] have a gun in his hand that's right he
[1:12:59] ain't got the gunion to handle a gun oh
[1:13:02] it's tremendous sinful to do like that
[1:13:05] that's awful but that's the Americans
[1:13:08] Canada you precious people from Canada
[1:13:10] if America keeps going on Canada be as
[1:13:14] low down as America after a while get
[1:13:16] around the borders of Canada anywhere
[1:13:18] and you got that American atmosphere
[1:13:20] this America is a prostitute of the
[1:13:23] Nations exact what she is and she's
[1:13:26] going to be worse than ever now she's
[1:13:28] coming to her end the Bible speaks of
[1:13:30] her Doom tells how she's going to be
[1:13:34] America Low Down Rotten filthy no good
[1:13:38] it's exactly right she's been a great
[1:13:41] nation she's car a gospel message what
[1:13:44] makes her the way she is because she's
[1:13:45] turned down the gospel message rejected
[1:13:49] the
[1:13:50] truth she's horrible she's got it coming
[1:13:54] don't worry
[1:13:56] I've seen it in the vision and thus
[1:13:58] sayith the lord it's coming she's going
[1:14:01] to pay for her sins back when America
[1:14:04] was America she was a great nation the
[1:14:06] greatest of Worlds ever known since
[1:14:08] Israel was America but she sure has
[1:14:11] polluted herself now she's rejected the
[1:14:14] message she's T nothing but just now
[1:14:16] she's got herself you see where she's at
[1:14:18] now everybody knows that in the last
[1:14:21] lection shows where her spiritual
[1:14:23] standing is she doesn't know now these
[1:14:27] Elders sitting up on the throne with
[1:14:30] these crowns now the fifth verse we're
[1:14:32] going to
[1:14:33] start and out of the throne
[1:14:36] proceeded Lightnings Thunders voices and
[1:14:40] there was seven lamps on fire burning
[1:14:43] Before the Throne which are the seven
[1:14:45] spirits of
[1:14:47] God oh I love this don't you oh I just
[1:14:51] feel like my coat fits me you know just
[1:14:54] when oh I meaning a spiritual code of
[1:14:57] course you know all
[1:15:00] right out of the throne let's speak of
[1:15:03] this Throne now for a few minutes this
[1:15:06] was not a throne of
[1:15:09] Mercy amen Mercy's Throne is finished no
[1:15:13] more Mercy it's without Mercy how are we
[1:15:17] going how the Judgment seat going to be
[1:15:19] the Judgment seat of Christ the Judgment
[1:15:21] seat the white Throne judgment is there
[1:15:23] going to be Mercy then there is not one
[1:15:26] stretch of Mercy to be given at the
[1:15:29] Judgment Throne you can scream Mercy
[1:15:31] till you couldn't scream no more and you
[1:15:33] might as well scream out in the air
[1:15:35] somewhere because there's no more Mercy
[1:15:37] now is the day of
[1:15:39] Mercy now let's go back in the Old
[1:15:42] Testament here just a little bit and
[1:15:43] find out what Mercy is go back and see
[1:15:46] what happened to this Throne this Throne
[1:15:49] of course is the the Judgment seat and
[1:15:54] be the reason reason today that there is
[1:15:57] Mercy is because The Mercy Seat is
[1:16:01] sprinkled with an
[1:16:03] atonement
[1:16:05] blood and as long as blood is on the
[1:16:09] Judgment seat then it is not judgment no
[1:16:12] more it's Mercy because something died
[1:16:15] to stay judgment
[1:16:18] amen if you see it say amen amen as long
[1:16:23] as blood is on the Mercy Seat show that
[1:16:27] something died the whole judgment back
[1:16:30] but when the church is raptured The
[1:16:33] Mercy Seat becomes a judgment
[1:16:37] seat over in the old in the New
[1:16:39] Testament year two and the sanctuary
[1:16:42] that's where the the jury in the
[1:16:44] sanctuary the judge on the seat in the
[1:16:46] sanctuary now that judgment seat and the
[1:16:50] sanctuary become full of smoke what was
[1:16:53] it like mount
[1:16:57] judgment Mercy had left the The Throne
[1:17:00] of God God will judge the world without
[1:17:03] Mercy how many know that amen only one
[1:17:07] thing you'll recognize in that day what
[1:17:09] is it
[1:17:11] blood that's the only thing that peed
[1:17:14] and Angry God Adam and Eve made just as
[1:17:16] good apron as any Methodist Baptist
[1:17:18] Presbyterian a Pentecostal could make am
[1:17:21] it covered their nakedness but God could
[1:17:23] see through it so he kill something and
[1:17:26] Tuck the dead skins of the skins of the
[1:17:28] dead animal and cover
[1:17:31] it blood had to take its
[1:17:34] place that stay his wrath he seen the
[1:17:37] blood and backed off from it because
[1:17:39] something had shed its
[1:17:42] life oh God think of it only thing
[1:17:47] that'll back off God is blood and
[1:17:50] there's only one blood that he'll back
[1:17:53] from and that's his own son
[1:17:55] when he sees that's his own son's bloody
[1:17:57] a back
[1:17:59] back because that's a gift that is God
[1:18:02] has given to his son to redeem those who
[1:18:05] he
[1:18:06] fornew and it brings God back from his
[1:18:10] judgment but when that blood is removed
[1:18:13] then all that was for known has been
[1:18:16] called into the precious body his church
[1:18:19] has been made ready and taken up and
[1:18:22] God's Wrath is on the people

[1:23:31] where the na and there inside of the Ark
[1:23:35] was the
[1:23:37] what the
[1:23:38] law and the law to trespass one
[1:23:43] commandment was to die without
[1:23:46] Mercy but that you could have mercy the
[1:23:50] blood had to lay on the
[1:23:52] altar they sprinkled The Mercy Seat and
[1:23:55] The Mercy Seat is the altar where you
[1:23:58] kneel and as for
[1:24:01] mercy God forbid it we ever take it from
[1:24:04] our
[1:24:05] churches the oldfashioned altar where
[1:24:08] man can kneel and call on God for
[1:24:12] mercy and mercy is Rich and flowing free
[1:24:18] from the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:21] now also that's the Mercy that's Mercy
[1:24:25] Seat but you notice in here it was not
[1:24:28] mercy seat for there was Lightnings and
[1:24:31] thunder and
[1:24:34] voices there's no lightning and Thunders
[1:24:36] at Mercy that's
[1:24:39] judgment let's turn to Exodus 19th
[1:24:43] Chapter of Exodus and the 16th
[1:24:48] verse Exodus

[1:24:58] verse and it came to pass listen what
[1:25:02] the when God ascended up on Mount sonion
[1:25:05] and it came to pass on the third day in
[1:25:08] the morning that there were
[1:25:11] Thunders
[1:25:13] lightning and a thick Cloud upon the
[1:25:16] mountain and the voice of the trumpet
[1:25:22] exceedingly loud
[1:25:26] what is the voice of the trumpet is the
[1:25:30] Archangel so that all the people listen
[1:25:34] all the people was in the camp
[1:25:38] trembled
[1:25:42] judgment they marched out there and God
[1:25:46] had given him Grace to travel by but
[1:25:48] they had demanded a
[1:25:50] law they God wanted to be in a
[1:25:52] denomination they want to make it
[1:25:54] denomination something they could argue
[1:25:56] about instead of just following God and
[1:25:58] living under his jurisdiction under his
[1:26:01] power Grace had provided a prophet Grace
[1:26:04] had provided an atonement a lamb Grace
[1:26:07] had provided all these things and yet
[1:26:09] they wanted judgment they wanted
[1:26:12] something they could do God said Sim
[1:26:14] them together I'll let them know what it
[1:26:17] is I'll show them what it is read listen

[1:26:25] and louder until it shut the
[1:26:29] Earth you see what judgment is I don't
[1:26:31] want that give me

[1:27:18] touched that mountain had to die right

[1:28:20] pieces and the and the Lord came down
[1:28:24] upon Mount Si on the top of the mountain
[1:28:27] and the Lord Called Moses up to the top
