========================================

for notice let me read it here it's in the the 10th verse and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwelt on the earth and white robes were given to every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet a little season see what a little season until their fellow see now what is it the prophets now are preaching to Israel see for thy fellow servants also thy fellow of servants and also thy Brethren that should be killed see once predestinated to be done so see to be killed as they were should be fulfilled see in other words it's predestinated to them it's the scriptures of they had to do it just rest for a little while now you got your robes you're going home and just sit there little while see wait just a little now notice now notice thy Brethren thy Brethren had yet be killed which means the 144,000 yet to be called in the tribulation 144,000 is called wish we had time we might get it tomorrow night if the Lord willing we but just before we get in on other seal see also now what they have to be martyred by the Antichrist we just come to and notice in his last ride where he breaks that Covenant then Jews down there in there these Jews 144,000 is to be called out by the two witnesses of Revelations 11 now you remember there was the prophesied you've read that how many's read that sure we all pled reading the scripture and they prophesy these two witnesses prophesy in the time of Daniel's second half of the 70 week that is the last three and a half years remember how we took to Daniel 70 week I said we need it when we got in here I didn't know why but something told me we need it here we are see notice in the time of Daniel I remember Daniel was told that the Messiah would come the prince the Messiah rather and and he would prophesy Israel still had 70 weeks left and in the midst of the 70 weeks the Messiah would be cut off and the daily sacrifice taken away is that right but there were still three and a half weeks determined in this block he takes the Gentile bride now she goes up and when she goes up two prophets arrive to Israel see and those Souls that's been martyred now down through your real true Jews down through there that had their name on the book that Liv the right life and done the right thing Liv Judaism to their do they were murdered by aan and many others honest people millions of them go down there and them Germans shot them to death and murdered them and killed them and hung them on fences and burn them up and create them and everything else that bloodless blood hearted hungry Hitler and staling and muscan and all that people that hated them Jews I think that's it one of the one of the things is holding this nation together because he've already respected the Jew amen give him a place you honor the Jew and God honor you now there's a bunch of Jews as Renegades just like there's Gentiles the same way but the real Jew God's put his name on the book before the foundation of the world and here he was murdered down in this time and remember think of it now how perfect this is right after that millions of slaughtered Jews innocent people by the nations of the world here the scripture says right in this time that they each one under the altar realize what's happened and they're given white robes and they said well what can't we go back to the kingdom right now the Jewish Kingdom to be set on the earth you know John said the kingdom of to be set not this is the kingdom of the Gospel you see but the kingdom of Jews will be preached by these these two prophets so notice the the kingdom of the earth here the Kingdom of Heaven is preached by the Jews uh to I mean to the Gentile the kingdom of here on the earth is be set up in the Millennium uh after the millennium the Jews now notice notice this now here why they why they're preaching see before these these prophets ever rise on the scene these Jews that had to die under I them is each one of them that is predestinated is given by Grace a white r each one of them giving him white r notice now what happens as soon as that takes place I'm watching that clock back there I know we're we're getting late but I don't want see I no that poor fell stand there God help you brother I hope each one of us get a white Rob that day standing changing back and forth with legs are hurting somebody worked all day I know what that is and look here and some of the poor little old women stand I notic some of these men give the women their seats and somebody else give some portal the mother of the baby and I I I see all that I'm sure he does notice but I don't want to keep you too long I just get you to see the message that's all I want you to do see now notice these Jews I have to do this in order to let you see the revelation of this seal see what it is the soier Under The Altar and who they are now notice in the time of Daniel now the second half of the 70th week now remember Messiah was to be cut off in the midst that's the middle what's half of seven three and a half how long did Christ preach three and that's right W but there is determined yet to the people what another three and A2 years well during this time well see what happened s is the Gentile bride is selected in the seven Church ages and goes up and when it does that way all these Jews is martyred along there because of blindness laying under the altar God comes over and says you see what it was now I'll give each one of you robe they said how long Lord are we going in now said no no no no your fellow man the Jews has got to suffer a little bit yet they got to be martyred like you was martyred the Beast has got to get them when he breaks his Covenant now notice and now notice once now just remember these prophets are to prophesy according to Revelations 11 you you rais your hands you read it see and they're given power and we're going to find out who they are just in a minute Lord I notice who these prophets are and now the Bible tells it here sure they does sure see I notice in the middle of this three and a half weeks now that they're prophesying down here and the the revelations here said and they they prophesy 1,3 and2 score days if now the regular Jewish calendar the regular time of God's calendar is exactly 30 days in a month the rolling calendar what makes it up the regular calendar is 30 days in a month now if you want to take 30 days and add three and a half years to it and see 30 days and you what you got 1,3 23 score days 1,23 score days 60 days exactly three and one half years now you see there's no mistake to that there it is just fits together like a a dove tail coming together no two prophets preach for three and a half years to the Jews in that is called out the 144,000 and then notice these two prophets are exactly Moses and Elijah amen now look look they look at their Ministry now watch what these prophets do they have power to Smite the Earth with a plague as of as they will who did it Moses amen they have power to shut the heavens and it rain not the day of their Ministry who closed the heavens for three and a half years there they are that's them see it's see the man when he dies he doesn't change his status he doesn't change his makeup see look when when before uh when Saul had backslid and there was no prophets in the land he couldn't understand what to do what to do he up against it he's going to battle he went to the witch of Endor now this a blood of bulls and goats she could do this and she called up the spirit of Samuel and when Samuel come up there he stood and his Prophet Ro not only that but he's still a prophet Hallelujah said GL you call me out of my rest he said see you become an enemy to God he said by this time tomorrow night you're going to fall in the battle and this time tomorrow night you'll be with me that's exactly what happened see not only he was still a prophet that's right and these fellas are still prophets now we're going to get a little deep in that just in a few minutes oh my I love that word no wonder a man should not live by bread

great sacrifice Lord for each one of us dying on the cross and giving us this great word Lord we we seem to have so much even looking back and when the prophets of old and the prophets of new were

then I was thinking about the words I'm like you can't wear out the grace of Jesus I'm like so let's just sing this with all our heart this morning once my soul was asay from the Heavenly way I was riched and vile as could be but my savior above he gave me peace joy and love then he reached down his hand for [Music] me oh when he reach down his hand for me he had to reach way down for me I was lost and [Music] undone without God for his son when he reach down his hand for me and I was nearing despair when he came to me there and he showed me that I could be free then he lifted my feet gave me Glory Rec complete when he reach down his hand for me and when he reached down his hand for me he had to reach way down for me for I was lost L stand undone without God or his son when he reached

hand for me amen as we continue to worship him this morning just play that Softly [Music] J [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's bow our heads word of prayer Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon the service today Lord as we come into your presence Lord we ask you to help us father to to get in the channel of your Holy Spirit Lord to move us into what you have for us today Lord move away all the unbelief and all the fears and cares of this life and speak to our hearts as our prayer may each one receive their portion today we ask it father in Jesus name amen amen Lord bless each of you we're so happy to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning welcome you to the house of the Lord God bless each of you visitors and Friends Lord bless you richly amen we like to go right into the word today and um and turn in our Bibles very familiar portion of scripture and acts chapter 1 and also St John chapter 7 just a little message that was born out of a question I had on my heart as we try to grow in the Lord and many times the Lord will put questions on your mind and questions out of the word and I trust that this will be a blessing to you today amen now in the scriptures Acts chapter 1 verses number four through 8 and the Bible says and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence and when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me in both Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth amen just take note that they were asking for um when these things would come to pass when would the kingdom come into its power they were looking for something St John chapter 7 we like to take a portion of the word there TR everybody is doing fine amen St John 7 and verse number 33 so our lord Jesus speaking again it says then said Jesus unto them yet a little while and my with you and then I go unto him that sent me ye shall seek me and shall not find me where I am thither you cannot come then said the Jews among themselves wheither will he go that we shall not find him will he go into the disperse among the Gentiles and teach the Gentiles what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where I am am thither you cannot come in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet others said this is the Christ but some said shall Christ come out of Galilee hath not the scripture said that Christ cometh of the seat of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was so there was a division among the people because of him amen and there's still a division today but our title of our message this morning is how to receive more power how do we receive more power let's pray Lord Jesus we ask your blessings upon the word that we'll bring today help us Lord to move out of the way say what you want us to say today let us hear what you want us to hear as our prayer we commit each Soul each one the youngest one to the oldest one into your hands today and we thank you in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated now this is um it's a simple question it's a valid question and I think every believer here every True Believer wants more of the power of God every true Christian you need that you need the power of God in your life you needed to overcome the devil and you and there is more of it to be had amen and it's like you know you're walking through life you have a journey that you're going through and in your life there's all these Crossroads of Junctions where the Lord is giving you more knowledge more wisdom and hopefully more power this is I'll call them the power Junctions that these are Crossroads that a man would come to First Kings 19 um The Prophet Elijah is told to go anoint Hazel juu and Elisha and Elisha is out in the field um plowing his family's oxen a piece of portion his inheritance and Elijah simply comes by him and cast his mantle upon him and this touching of the mantle somehow changes this man's life Elisha now goes and kills all he slays all of the oxen I mean he didn't put them for sale he didn't try to get money out of them he made a decision right there right there something happened to this young man's life to cause him to go slay his his family oxen and go follow a man do we don't know where you're exactly going and um what the purpose is but the Lord told Elijah to go anoint him and then annointing him he just simply takes that mantle and it touches him this is a game Cher for Elisha obviously we see him later following Elijah in second Kings chapter 2 veres 7-10 the Lord is now done working with Elijah and he's going to call him off the scene and this little buddy this little Minister this little second fiddle this guy that's always under the coattail of Elijah is asked a question it's a beautiful question that was asked him this is not a question that's asked many times maybe this was the only time it was asked him what a wonderful opportunity for a question like this to be asked this would be this would be in the fairy tales this would be you finding a genie in the bottle yes sir in the fairy tales you got three wishes from this great Genie and he's going to change and he's gonna offer that you're gonna think real good and real hard aren't you you gonna think like what should I ask for at this moment well this Prophet asked him that question what will I do for you today and Elisha asked him he saysi want a double portion of your spirit I don't want I I got something already because you touched me and I'm following you but now I want a double portion of your spirit the danger with many Believers and many Christians they stop asking for this portion of the Holy Spirit what does the bible saying Acts chapter one we just read there um when the Holy Ghost has come you will what you shall receive power that is not a one-time event when the Holy Ghost come whenever it comes you shall receive power can we say it like this when the Holy Ghost come you shall receive more power no matter first stage second stage third stage old man young man when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you shall receive power now the power of God we can you know we can misunderstand it many times because the way it's dispersed out and the way it's manifested many times it could throw us off and sometimes we think power is signs wonders and miracles and it is the scriptures say that you know when Jesus did Great and Mighty Miracles like the the little boy that was possessed with the demon and Jesus spoke the word and he went into this epilepsy fit and then the Lord delivered him they thought man what Mighty power this Prophet has to deliver him but it goes a little bit deeper than just the signs wonders and miracles okay and I'll read from you for you as I'm getting ahead of myself but I have to do this or I won't get to it in the message calling Jesus on the scene and this is 1964 now remember brother Van's Ministry consisted of the first second and third pool which we are benefactors of today amen and let me stop by saying this you know it was brother brandom's third pool and we thank God that we can we can touch into it as well this is why we preach and and a lot of times we say the same things we say different things but we mean the same as I was talking with one of our Fine Brothers here last night about the different churches that believe that brother brandom is gone now so the message is now the ministry is for the bride is for uh the pastors today because brother brandham is gone while they'll proceed to quote from Brother brandham so brother brandom is gone he's not here but you're reading quotations from the man you said is gone so how is he gone that's right so if he's gone then let him be gone and go forward in your third pool second pool in your first pool but many times we were saying the same thing and I I do know that we are benefactors of the third pool and we we can't preach the message that we have today because it was given to us in that fashion but it came in stages and that first pool signs wonders and miracles second pull the sign in the hand which caused a lot of uh impersonations and then the third pool the opening of the word and even greater manifestation but look at what brother random says here in 1964 calling Jesus on the scene he says this here he's reminiscing about the ministry from before he says paragraph 46 and that's what it takes to have a Revival it's everybody under the heat of the Holy Spirit that's brought down the powers of God and a Revival moving then there's the prayer meetings going day and night every minute everywhere why the people wouldn't even leave the grounds I remember in Jonesboro Arkansas when I first started about my third meeting St Louis and then Corning and then then down to Jonesboro the paper stated 28,000 people in the meeting for 20 or 30 miles from the city where the tent set up you couldn't get a farmhouse to stay in the little city of Jonesboro and people come from Miles packing lanterns walking through the jungles a bus come and set out in the wilderness I sat out in the wilderness one evening praying before the service started and I seen young ladies coming with their shoes and stockings under their arms then before then they get down there stop and brush off the dust from their feet put on their stockings and shoes and go into the meeting I seen them lay their sick children under an old Cotton trucks and stay there day and night hold papers and canvas over them while it was raining storm of blowing not leave their place waiting just to get inside the building there is where the blind was seen the deaf was hearing and the ministry tonight is a 100 miles beyond that but the Revival fires have died down see the people walk up there and just just point your finger and say well do you believe brother that's all he was out and gone that's all that had to be done they believed the Revival was moving so here brother random is highlighting the signs wonders and miracles of that was happening to the Physical Realm the body but now he brings in the word later on in his ministry and he's saying that the word here 196 before was a 100 miles beyond all of those signs wonders and miracles so we love the signs the Wonders and miracles but um that is just a portion that was a portion of one phase of power to take you to the next level of power and let me say this to you Saints here today if you're a Believer or Christian ever who you may be newcomer Oldtimer we all should be on our next phase or our next level of power God should be or we should be expecting God to pour out another portion of his power in our lives in our experience down in our souls we should be looking for that and it's dangerous when we don't we lose that so these disciples now they walk withes Jesus and the Lord is now telling them that um that that um come and drink drink of this Fountain and I will give you Waters flowing from your belly rivers of Living Water he's talking about them he says from your belly will flow rivers of Living Water and this is what he was talking about he was speaking about the oncoming of the Holy Spirit that was to come so they had something to look forward to amen and Acts says and when you shall receive power the and and and when and when the Holy Ghost has come you shall receive power to be Witnesses now one of the nice things that this um message has done for us particularly those of us who handle it who study it very seriously who look into it we never stop looking we never stop searching we're always looking at details it's in the DNA of a man even a carnal man not even a spiritual man the scientists have not stopped in their great achievements that they have achieved they're continuing on they're studying right now somebody's in their lab someone's in their workshop someone's working on a project for this disease or this equation or this they're always advancing because it's it proves to you and I that a man has a soul this what makes us different from the Animal Kingdom and if you don't have a desire in your heart to understand the moving of the spirit what the second and the third pool is it's just like a monkey or an animal because they don't care either and many Christians that come to the household of faith and all these tapes have been stored up and he preached a series on the church ages a series on the Seven Seals but we can't pick it up because we don't have time or we're not interested that's how the animals think that's what a monkey thinks like but a man of God a child of God is gonna pick that Bible up and begin to open it and look into the counsel of Life The Word of Life and try to find more of the blessings of God that pertains for his life this is the True Church of the Living God we don't stop searching we don't stop seeking brother brandom tells us in the message see I'll get to it quickly but in St John chapter 3:16 he reads that scripture and he says this in the message um love 1957 and he quotes it for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life you say brother Brandon would you read such a little text for a great service you see doesn't make much difference how small it is it's what it says it's the contents in it the context what makes it so valuable that is is enough scripture to convert the entire world to God and to Christ tonight if it be received in the right mental attitude it would do it it would bring every sinner to his knees and the reason I chose this tonight is because my theme has always been love I think love is the most powerful force that the world has because God is love and there's no more power more powerful force than God and love is one of the greatest things that I could speak of so nice little insight there right so we know that love is the greatest source of power that that the prophet brings to us that he can think of nothing greater than Love Now physically if I was to challenge each of you you to Armed wrestling contest of course we know who we win not me all right but let's say let's humor me okay let's say I am GNA win all right and I'm gonna win because I got the biggest I got 23 inch guns here all right or 24 whatever they are they're probably 13 but let's say I got 24 inch guns here know power so Joseph I bring you up here bam Brother Andy bam got him just wipe all of you Brothers out more power than anybody in here that's physically but let's say the love that a man would have for his son see that love is more powerful than any physical Force the love a woman would have for her child the love that God had for your soul there is nothing more powerful than love if you get the love right everything else will be right if your love is correct your ministry will be correct your ability to sing your study habits your giving your living your sacrifice your praying all comes in line when the love is right because it is the greatest source of power that you can think of it's love love for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so love is a great source of power brother phanom goes further and he says that a man fully surrendered to God so as a man would surrender himself to God now he surrendering himself to more of God more of his power he continues it tells us that that in you is the seed of God and in that seed is every fruit every gift every ounce of power that you'll ever need is already in you this is what Jesus said he says come unto me and drink you that are thirsty drink and I will give you I will quench your thirst with rivers flowing from within you so we think of power maybe as an outside Source power coming to us another Touch of power but the power if you have the Holy Ghost is already in you now and he's just releasing more of that power as you surrender to him here what the prophet of God says here in the message the Queen of Sheba paragraph number seven then if Satan and he was referring back to Jonah and many times we like to say about Jonah of him being backsliding now I'm not holding up so much for what he did but I believe that all things work together for good to them that love God sometimes we do things that we don't understand our own doings if we are led by the spirit of God every child of God in my hearing or hearing of my voice rather knows that sometimes that you do things that you think yourself is ridiculous when you become so closed in with God when the Holy Spirit gets you in such a condition till you're fully surrender to him I've seen men so filled with the devil until it would take several men to hold them and then if Satan can put that kind of a power on a man fully surrender to him how much more power can the Holy Spirit put on a man that surrendered to him to make a person in a wheelchair rise and walk to make the shadow of a man dying with cancer on a to jump to his feet screaming under the power of God for how much stronger is God than the devil so as we surrender our life to him We're surrendering ourselves to more of this power prophet God continues here paragraph number 34 in the message show us the father now that little tree just like you after you've accepted Christ in the little baby form then we are planted together in Christ now the only thing this little tree does you just have to pour the water to it and it starts drinking and when it drinks its a lotted portion it's got to drink more than that it has to drink so much until it starts pushing out limbs then it just keeps on drinking until it pushes out leaves then it just keeps on drinking till it pushes out blossoms then it just keeps on drinking till it makes it to every service is that what it said no it didn't say that let me me back up it keeps on drinking until it pushes out oranges all the time drinking drinking drinking and when we become Born Again Servants of God the seed of God planted in our heart we just keep drinking drinking and pushing out everything you have need of in this earth journey is in you when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the healing you ever need all the rejoicing you'll ever need all the power you ever need everything you got need of is in you when you're got Christ in you but the only thing you have to do is keep drinking drinking people don't get thirsty enough the Bible said blessed are you when you do hunger and thirst after righteousness when you're thirsty you can drink and the more you drink the more you can spread out the more grace you get the more power you have can you say Amen the more faith you have you have as you keep drinking from Christ who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life drinking the seed form God's word is a seed God is in his word look at him when he makes his word manifest Promises of what he would do look at 120 people taking God's word went up on the day of Pentecost and waited until that commission T into the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high so there's power in Waiting there's power in drinking from the spirit and what we're drinking is more of the word more of his of his goodness more of what he said about us the seed in US is growing it's already in you all the rejoicing you have need of is already in you all of the power that you have need of is already in you when you become a Christian that seed of life is in you so more power is already in you but you have to surrender yourself to him more and drink more of the inexhaustible Fountain I think maybe we get stagnant in our growth we get stagnant in our expectations of our life and our we get tired we get weary and doing the things and tasks that he's called us to because we need power and the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they'll Mount up with wings as Eagles waiting on the Lord waiting on his promises brings more of this power into your life and every one of us need more of this power how do we get that we get that by waiting upon him taking him at his word the more grace the more power the more we surrender the more he has to give to us so it's on us to surrender more and we would receive more remember the the the the outward man the outward Junctions for the church started with Wesley and then on with Luther and then or Luther and then Wesley and then the Pentecostals and then on into the briay that we're in now it's a series of changes a series of anointings remember there's not going to be Rapture until there's a body change and the body change is in type every time we receive healing it's a touch or taste of what uh the body change is when God comes down and anoints your heart you had heart trouble and he heals you or he heals some disease that you have that's just the foraste or it's the down payment it's the earnest of what your body change will be so our next move for the church is a body change and then after the body change is the rapture we're not going in the Rapture until our bodies are changed and so this series of changes in your life receiving more of God in your life has to be a part of what the Christian church has always been been experiencing along with you you the believer and so what's the next level of power for the Christian Church what's the next level of change for you what are you expecting to happen next in your life what is the next level that God is going to anoint you with you know this this change in Elisha's life it really was a tremendous change he had the man on him and then from the mantle touching him he went over into a double portion he says I want a double portion of your spirit now Elijah didn't tell Elisha what to ask for there's that comes from you that comes from your prayer life the desires that you have that comes from you uh you developing a way to witness to people that's you sharpening your iron I can't come and tell you how to what tape to give someone or how to do that but when you have burden and you have the love in your heart it will develop a strategy that works for you on how to witness to somebody about the goodness of the Lord if you care you'll study that if you if it's a part of you you will work on that Lord how can I do this on my John go keep something in handy with me take a track with me or put a script scripture on my mind how should I how should I move how should I operate in giving someone the word this is developed when you have Love in Your Heart properly when you have the love in your heart you go down on your knees and pray for these things to take place and then through your prayer life it starts to develop little customized ways of operating you can't follow the crowd you go down on your knees and that's where you get your instructions I don't go online to hear what other brothers are preaching to find out what to preach on no I go down on my knees I listen to the Tes I read my Bible and then from on high the Lord speaks to every heart that way we're not following crowds you got to find and develop how God is going to lead you and direct you this starts with a burden starts in your prayer closet amen you go down where'd you come up with that how' you where'd you get that idea from you people that's what they do they'll come in they'll see something working oh how' you how'd you figure that out and I'll try it too no why don't you go develop your own once you get down on your knees and find out how to make your own pork chops stop asking me for a recipe you can develop that yourself just keep trying right huh am I talking to anybody here yeah I like getting other recipes from other people but have can you create something yourself that tastes good huh that's what everybody does how to change at Tire go online how to love my spouse go online how to be a better person go online how do everything's going online what about going on on your knees how did they figure it out years ago how did they let me ask you this how did they serve the Lord before we had air conditioning how did they serve the Lord before we had the Comforts that we have today they figured it out didn't they they were believers they got a revelation on their knees and this is where it always starts Lord I want to surrender more of my life to you I need to give more of myself to you I need more grace and with more Grace comes more power now brother R makes this statement here and I like this it's kind of touchy but I'm going to say it anyways he talks about the Pentecostal church and he says this here in the message hear ye him paragraph number 52 you know our Lord he meets in the real a man sometimes he meets in great groups of men sometimes he meets with few we have record of him meeting with 500 one time after his resurrection then we have where he where he met with 70 and with the 12 and and even with three and then we have times where he'll meet with just one so nice that's what makes him God to me is because that he is humility I've had the privilege of doing much traveling and meeting great men when I meet men that tries to be great that's you can always class that man that there isn't very much to him great men that they try to make you think you're the great one but it's men that wants to be great if you'll just Chase it down to the bottom you find out it's a stuffed shirt now I don't mean that to be flat a group of Methodist Brethren that just received the Holy Spirit came to my church where I used to pastor and it was great man lived up in Indiana they said brother bam after we received the Holy Ghost we've been reading some books say should we wait on the Lord and seek the Lord to tell us our ministry I says don't do it at all he says well the book said I said but wait a minute brother if you ever take men that's so zealous that they want to always be doing something God couldn't trust that person what' he say did he say that paragraph 55 if you ever take men that's so zealous that they want to always be doing something I didn't have that in my notes but it's here I'm reading it God couldn't trust that person if you'll notice in the Bible the man that God used was the man was trying to get away from all of it that's the one that God used take for instance say Paul Moses and so forth trying to run from the very uh cause if a man God would give man uh give man to do a certain thing he was so zealous of it the first thing you know he'd be so swelled out but if a man doesn't want to do such maybe God can use him for a while anyhow if you just can get something out of him but men that usually wants to go and blast over the world and tear it down usually God can't trust him because he wants to do it himself he gets in his own way with it if a man don't want to go then God almost has to drive him into it that's the type of man that God usually uses in this scripture so let me read that was in the message what message was that hear ye him 0 6712 that's a good one that's not what I had here but that's really good let me read what I have here maybe you can pick it up for me sis I think it's further in that same message so that's all right as long as the organization stays with the power of God God blessed that organization that's the reason I'm Pentecostal today because I think it's got more power of God in it than any organ ganization I ever seen But when the Pentecostal power leaves the Pentecostal church I'll go with it so here here here look at what brother random is saying here he's equating the Pentecostal Church amongst all the other churches as the church that had the most power in it he said this is the reason why I went with the Pentecostal church because it had the most power in it a Pentecostal blessing Pentecostal power is in it but he says when the Pentecostal Church loses the Pentecostal power then I'mma leave with it and we can classify that with the churches today call them message churches whatever you want to call them what if we said If the message churches leave that Pentecostal power then that's not really that's not really a message Church they might call it a message church but what's what makes it what makes it the Church the true church has got the Pentecostal blessing in there and you know when you think of these the the humility it takes that the way up is actually down that more power comes as you you know uh as you stop trying to be more popular you try to be less popular and when you're becoming less popular there's more power in that and probably the great great Ministries that we're longing to see maybe they're in existence but they're so true nobody knows who they are yet maybe that's the case you know these big name that are out there their name is spread everywhere and they want to make sure they got so many people following them or liking them or are part of their Ministry they want to grow bigger and bigger and bigger and they become a stuffed shirt and you meet them in other country you meet them other places you can barely shake their hand because you don't know how important I am you don't know how big of a church I have I am Pastor so and so I'm the most important preacher in my city they have this atmosphere about them and that Spirit comes as you get you think you're getting greater and bigger and more popular that's in the eyes of men but what about the power of God the power of God lays in the dirt it's humble it don't have to be recognized it don't have to be appreciated because it ain't about him anyways it's about preaching the gospel big church little church no church they'll preach the gospel because that's a true Ministry and you probably don't know them you're not aware of them imp possibly because the Way Up Is Down can I go a little bit further yes this power when it leaves the church brother BR says I'll go with it he gives an example of Moses when he took that Spirit off of Moses and put it on 70 others brother B says that it wasn't more power given it was just more Machinery now he had more Health the the power was there but it was on more people so it can be used even greater oh my now look what the prophet of God says here in the message the everpresent water from the rock paragraph 161 just up a little bit above that 160s what we need today is does not pray for more power what you got enough power to make a new Earth what you need is Faith to use that power what you need is what faith to use that power and what you need is to control that life and live such a Godly life that when you ask God anything you know we have confidence in God of that we know if we keep his Commandments he'll withhold no good thing from us if we walk with him God walking with us oh my but they have one thing to do they have but one thing to do that's stay straight on the course so as you live a life living the life is the way that you get or receive more power we want some something external many times we want to feel something or see something but really we need to live that life and to control the life that God has given us in our life we have a way that we conduct and carry ourselves and this and this current atmosphere and cl uh climate is very proud very boastful me and my Ministry and my talents and my gift and wait till they hear me preach and I'm better and I'm more and I have the best and I'm greater that it's a common human it's a common human flaw the disciples had it Lord who who's gonna be in charge when you leave Lord who's the greatest Among Us Lord can I sit on this hand or that hand when they should have been following his example he's on his way to Calvary he the Lord Lord Of Glory sought no reputation was not looking for a reputation but he made himself of no reputation and what this age has done we've made it all about our reputation me and mine you might get a good following bigger following you might be more known it might be bigger in one sense but in the eyes of God where do you stand huh where do you stand in the power of God control that life you'll live such a life you remember Moses he comes to the burning bush when that burning bush approaches him or he approached it it spoke to him and told him take off your shoes Moses where you stand in this Holy Ground what is that in your hand Moses is that's a rod now go use that rod and go tell Pharaoh in his hand he had the rod it was a time where the rod meant nothing and then it really meant something it was a power moment that Lord what's that rod in your he took that Rod is it was equivalent of the name of Jesus Christ to the believer remember the disciples lived and they served in their Ministry without having the holy ghost so Jesus prepped him and told them to wait until you receive power from on high and now we want a rod in our hand don't we want the Lord to put a rod in our hand another step or another um unction another level of the spirit another height a deeper depth a higher height in the spirit I prefer that before God than to be known through wherever wouldn't you prefer that yes wouldn't you prefer that when you got down on your knees that the Lord heard your prayer wouldn't you prefer you had the power of God when you pray things move and things happen over the Fanfare being popular it's a it's a spirit of the day it's something that we all have to put aside amen it's Pride and Satan is behind all of it so he says don't pray for more power but pray for Faith to operate that power pray for God to give you Grace to control your life that in controlling your life that will produce the power of God in your life uhhuh brother Bram says this here in the everpresent water from The Rock paragraph 162 today we got the word we follow the word we see the word working in Believers we know it it's so God working with us confirming the word with signs foll when we stay with the word the word produces the results amen oh my and the message the token I don't have it here tonight to this this morning but as I prepare to close the message the token says as we fully obey the word all the word it entitles us to the token and now this entitlement comes as we wait on the Lord and fully obey the word and so there's there's things in the making of whatever scientific achievement you take that smartphone or you take the latest model vehicle and the computer in it or the iPad or whatever technology or whatever how to grow a plant or trees or how to operate whatever you're G to do you know man doesn't stop they'll take they'll take the achievement of where we are today and he'll start looking at how he can better that how he can make that better how he can uh uh uh capitalize on it or take out some of the you know the energy wasting or this taking too much time let's cut it down a little bit let's make this more you know make it more convenient make it more powerful so when people come in and you can serve them better and that's the way a a deacon is thinking that's the way a trustee thinks that's the way a Pianist or a organ or a musician a song leader a preacher Sunday school teacher this is how they should be thinking you know this is what's working thank God for it but is there a better way to make it work better you know these pews are great but is there a better seating arrangement that's better you know the air conditioning whatever it is you should always be looking at that like humans do in a a better way to make this work how can we do it we're not laying back and saying oh it's well enough it's good enough that's the wrong attitude I'm sorry well was you know and um and uh in that it's part of us it's in us to do that and brother vam get gives this type to us in the message the countdown he brings that type he says as it's happening in the natural in science it goes together with the spiritual so you see them scientifically out there blowing your mind they got a fully electric vehicle fully elect don't rent one now but if you got one they're beautiful scientific achievement and and um there are you know it's I mean goodness you think they're gonna be rolling with that same electric vehicle in five years you think they're gonna be doing the same thing they're doing today absolutely not they're rolling out another model next year another way of doing it you know NASA said we'll do it like this we'll do it like this all these protocol then Eli mus says you know what I think I want to make my own like no you can't do that no my mom didn't say no nobody ever did you ain't thinking about what nobody talking about go into the lab and figure it out and he did he did and all the haters in the back oh he can't do it own work he said he flying on you think he's gonna stop with his achievements what about the preacher today what about the Sunday school teacher today you know I think the greatest preachers in the message are among us today and the reason why I think that is because not that we got a new word but we have access to all the word now I can read it and study it on my way between other task it's on my phone it's I can comprehend it in a much greater way and consume it in a greater way so what kind of preachers and teachers should we be that's right the brothers who did it brother Neil Haba and the brothers who paid it forward to get that technology rolling and get it going and we all benefit from it but they don't go to our church so but they still ain't Believers though you see how we are we get but you know what we benefit from it I didn't do it but somebody else did it do you think you have some critics you think there's going to be a Critic hey let's put all this in print ah we don't need to do that just leave like it is leave it like it was but you know those are people who don't have grandkids those are people who are not keeping it alive for the Next Generation so glad somebody recorded it and not only recorded it didn't stop there with just a recording they put it in print then they put it on a computer then they put it in a tablet Heen that ought to equip the believer with more access on how to handle the word of the the Lord in this day amen sure yes now couple more minutes all right sir it's not even 12 o'clock all right he says now when they fully obeyed the word they God brought them the token in the message just once more he says this here paragraph number 15 Satan has no power only as he can Bluff with it if he can Bluff you into it all right you'll have to have it but legally he has no power at all every Power he had was taken from him at Calvary that's where the price was paid he's nothing but a bluff if you want to listen to his bluff well all right but you don't have to you are free tonight he has made you free and now if something in the word can make you realize that you are free by his grace or if something realize and the word makes you understand or some Act of God that it included you it includes us all then you just accepted on those basis and you're free also so this is what study the power of studying the word is when you're studying the word you already know the story many times David Daniel the Hebrew boys so forth and so on we know those stories but when you go back and read it again you're trying let the spirit strike something to Quicken something greater in your faith it's not nothing new but is quickening something more is there something in the word that when I read this is going to strike me in a greater way in a greater measure that's why we read it read it over read it over and over again because something in the word is there for the believer there's some Act of God and the word makes you understand or some Act of God that it included you it includes us all then you just accepted on those basis we realize that we're free now the prophet of God takes this message humble thyself I wanted to get to this and so we're here now in the message humble thyself we fully wait find something in the word that can make you realize you know you think you want Power you think you need power but you don't realize what power is he says he says God can only operate as we let him operate and there's so many wonderful things that I'm saying you know people people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't really know what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all of your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big loud of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ to see to humble yourself before him that's really power you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise so we see that humbleness humility there is power in that humility and trying to do God a service he says this someone someone said to me he said well now someday the Lord probably seeing visions brother B will reveal to you what these things are we can all get closer to God and have more power than we got than we get in speaking tongues and things I said it can't be that way he's talking about bringing the seals and so forth because you see I believe the word to be the truth and the Bible says whosoever should add one word or take one word from it it has to be in this word see it's the Mysteries that the people has overlooked for right there is where come my message message of serpent seed and the true belief of the security of the believer so Believers and people there are things in the word that I that you have overlooked be honest be honest with it there's some later messages 63 64 65 we overlooked them and then when covid happened we started finding things didn't we and you see the foolishness happening amongst churches and then we start find more things these are messages that we heard before tape services that we've heard but then there's things that we stumble over we just you know grows through or brace through and we Overlook them but those Mysteries is where the serpent SE come out of let me read it one more time for you all right because see I believe the word to be truth paragraph 73 and the Bible says whosoever shall add one word take one word from it it has to be in this word see it's the Mysteries that the people has overlooked for right there is where come my message of serpent seed true belief of the security of the believer so you see the stuff going on today you see all the stuff going on in the different churches and different even our local assembly and church out here church across overseas wherever you see this great landscape of differences and people people and you know you know people from the outside people from the inside they're in turmo they have these websites now they have these voices and platforms and they don't have a pullit but they're online and they're getting views and your young people are watching them mind to you everybody has access to it they're watching these things take place out there and they're not even in church we're hearing preachers across other states and state lines we're listening to them we don't even live in these places we've never even been in some of these churches but we know what the pastor is preaching but see these these points that have been overlooked that it really it it's going to uh push the True Believer to go back into the word because whatever is going on today please hear me Saints whatever is going on today you got to find it in the word so if somebody wants to turn a corner or tell you we're g to change this or do this differently you got to find it in the word if it ain't in the word then just stay on course stay with the word because in the word that's where the power of God lays in there I believe with all my heart there's another outpouring of the spirit for the True Believer I believe that for me I believe that for this church some people don't believe that Brothers we're just waiting we're just waiting yeah we're waiting for what that's right we're just waiting we're just waiting in one of these days it's but brother sister the next move is a body change huh it's a body change in the moment in the twinkling of the eye this Mortal will put on immortality that's our next move think about it Church think about that the next move is a body change after the body change then it's the Rapture if you're not in the body change how you're going to be in a Rapture if your desire is not for another touch in the body change I'm not talking about the outside body I'm talking about your soul the soul yes the word anointing you in your soul bringing up your faith to a level you never had before until one day you'll be like Enoch and you'll get up out of here sure so what is the next level of power for you what's the next level of power for you my brother my sister what's the next charge what's the next anointing brother bam takes the message to countdown I'll just skim through it real quick a couple of quotes and he says that those great achievements in paragraph number 36 says the natural Man by knowledge looks backward for his achievements that science to see what God has done in a former creation they go out and pick up Claws and get pieces of rocks fossils and elements ties them together on this achievement they are taking what God has done and perverting it from its original estate and making his living quarters and so forth his economy a little bit better by what has been created that's in the natural achievement by man but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward not going backward he's going forward looking into the word and believing the promises for things that never has come yet for the spiritual Revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as the scientist in his laboratory are working on different different things to help man taking creation the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God promised that has never yet been created the natural man looks backward the spiritual man looks forward are you looking to the third pool are you looking into the body change what are the Dynamics of a Rapture what does it mean to drop this Earthly to Tabernacle and put on a new one what happens if today or this week is

more same message continues on this same message he says what did it immediately medely after the airplanes come on he took to the air God showed by the airplanes that his church was arising he shows by the Natural Things what's happening in the spiritual they always follow what' you say brother Bram yeah say it again let me read it what did it immediately after the airplanes come on he took to the air God showed by the airplanes that his church was arising he shows by the Natural Things what's happening in the spiritual they always follow tell me somebody tell me science stopped studying they still studying they're still working on it you know the Nike Corporation how you wear your shoes how you exercise your diet the way you the way you build a home every single element of your daily life carnally speaking they're constantly advancing constantly working on it Monday working on it still work and what the believer doing today with the message play a tape that can't fall asleep come on play a tape can't take a note Prophet ain't say nothing worth note taking oh I know it already man pick that pen take a note somewhere I know you all take them in your mind and after the service you go write them down right look at your neighbor say neighbor let's take notes together from the word of the Lord huh yes see the it blows my mind what these people doing what the the ai ai I can write a poem I can do all kind of stuff with artificial intelligence that's science these are people that don't know nothing about no altar don't nothing about the Holy Ghost what am I doing as a preacher what kind of a pastor what kind of a father what kind of a mother what kind of a leader what kind of a whatever I am am I today in light of these great things and these great carnal achievements they do it by the power in their mind and their brains one man advancing to the next we do it by the power by the power of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost comes upon you you shall receive more power and we need more power let me read one more two more I'm almost out of this message all right he says this here I'm just getting started though Saints I'm just getting started yes immediately after that the prophet of God continues on he says this here paragraph 56 when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost there's something in him that's full of God's spiritual vitamin makes him praise God shout and act different because why he's no longer Earthbound he is in the heavens sailing around in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he left them Earthbound with their bicycles and Automobiles they went on to the air yes sir practically it's taking them out of there out of the date out out of date they healed the sick they spoken unknown languages done many things but now friends this is my last one paragraph 58 but now friends may I say this it has come to the age of astronaut we have moved out of the airplane airplane age we've got more power power now the astronaut age has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of astronaut see going above it's the same Spirit only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ not the audible will not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronut astronaut he sweeps on above of each one it's called The Eagle age in the Bible amen God calls his Prophet Eagle age we realize over in the Bible we find in Malachi 4 they were promised that in the last days now he likes His prophets to Eagles he calls himself an eagle he's a great Jehovah Eagle he is able to achieve to himself a bride he's going to in the last days be able to get a bride that with the ministry that's so exactly like a man and wife becoming one and when Jehovah gets his people like him then he lives in his people they are one to fulfill St John 1412 how did the astronaut find this how did the astronaut find this paragraph 66 he figured it out on paper it come off of paper what he had figured out the same thing that any man can sit down and read the word of God and see what's promised search the scriptures and then you think you have eternal life said Jesus they testified me that Earthbound Bunch they had back there in them days didn't know what he was let me say this search the message for in them it gives you the power that's supposed to be taking place today there's some unique things that God is doing I believe and wants to do if not for a group I'm believing it for myself there are things that my faith is raising up because I'm reading this in the message reading in the word of God if God is with us then where are all the Miracles if he's with us where's all those Miracles I love the tapes now where are the tapes in my life where are the tapes in my Ministry where are the effects of the tapes in my church this is a this is a scientific process this is a carnal man's process but what about a spiritual man what about a spiritual man that takes a text or takes a promise first pull second pull third pull now let's read it again let's hear it again and go back through it again what was the fir what was the second pull my goodness what was the third pull how do you right that's nothing but the truth I give you your family it's all what about that where is that at it's in the word something trying to strike it off you got to pick it up you got to read it bring it off the paper read it again The Mantel will strike you and then in your prayer life what if God ask you say brother Israel he won't ask you that says who what if God asked you what will I give you to today say Lord I want a double portion who can say that who would ask what kind of man would ask for a double portion it certainly ain't a carnal man it certainly ain't one of the prophets out there your Master's leaving today Elijah Elisha had this in him brother George this this thing I want what this man got yeah I love I love Elijah he's my mentor man look at the anointing in his life he's just following him along I love him I love I'm following I killed I left Mom and them I killed all the oxen I gave up everything I'm following this man I'm going on and my Master's leaving and and the prophets are telling me he's leaving today what you gonna do he's like be quiet I I got it I'm I'm following the prophet I don't know what I'm gonna do then the prophet turns around says what can I give you today what are you kidding me he asked a hard thing but nothing's too hard for the Lord sister Hattie sister Hattie what can I do for you today the spirit just told me give her what she wants what can I give her today she said my goodness now a carnal woman would have asked for carnal things but a spiritual woman ask for Spiritual things I want the salvation of my children you got it sis you got it right now it's yours absolutely what about us today what if the Holy Spirit would come down and ask you what can I do for you today what would you want more real estate more property more money but would you want a double portion of the spirit of God I want that portion that's going to change my body bring me to a Rapture God bless you so much thank the Lord Jesus amen thank him musicians come please praise His name when it's wrote here he's got it in his heart something tells him he just prepars right on out that's all goes right on out into space because we're living in an astronaut age yes sir out in space where all things are possible to them that believe he's got a guide which is his word the spiritual astronaut paragraph 77 he says the spiritual astronaut got in Christ and is listening to the countdown of the word and that's what we're listening to there's a great countdown 10 n 8 7 six 5 4 3 2 1 Z Martin or Luther Wesley the Pentecostal AE the airplane and now we're in the countdown we're going we get there's a Rapture to take place the countdown is in the word the countdown is in the word rapturing faith is in the word yes it's not online it's not on Tik Tock it's not out we're arguing with folks it's not debating the message and not trying to our church is bigger and better it's not trying to boost me and boost my our music is better than everybody else it's not none of that it's in the word like I'm trying to find out how to crack this code in my life I need more power in my life I need to overcome this temper this anger I need to lay hands on the sick they shall recover I need faith for a WRA I'm trying to uncrack I don't got time to argue with folks I don't got time to miss this opportunity because he comes out what can I do for you today Lord I want a double portion you got it there you go it's yours and he got it didn't he he got a double portion of Elijah's Spirit Elijah had seven miracles Elisha had 14 wow wow and then the others come along oh I would have asked for that too but you didn't give me what Elijah got you didn't ask asked for what Elisha asked for how did Elisha ask for it
