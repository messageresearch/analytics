many times where I wanted to just give up and throw in the towel just be done with it all it was so tormenting and I would pray about it here and there and I never thanked God in advance for it and someone told me that I needed to start doing that and so I finally got down and I prayed and I started thanking God and after that I told the devil that he had no more control over me and if he ever tried to attack me again I would just start thanking and praising God and um I a few days went by still felt the same and I just kept thanking God and I was in my car on the way to friend's house and

me a little bit uh you know my my my throats kind of rough I was preaching hard this morning so uh there was a time that I that I went and preach and I was getting tired and I said you know what I I'm going to start being so so given into it I'm going to kind of take a slow and something you know in my heart you know in my mind said oh so you're going to take a slow huh and I couldn't I'm like no if I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it right and then you know after that the Lord will take care of business amen so God bless you I'm happy to be here uh to me it's a uh it I I think it's easy for me to uh to come and and preach and talk to you but what is hard for me is to avoid mistakes I I find myself trying to be real careful and every word everything I say because that this is your native language it is not mine I learn it through education and so I don't I don't want to be I'm I'm afraid sometimes to to say things and I'm like I they really understanding what I'm really saying or or am I saying something that means something else you know and so that's my my fear not not to speak not to come and and try to you know to say something that the prophet has already said it is is is those human aspects of the of this thing but I think that if we have the right Spirit yes sir you know we all are going to be blessed amen God bless you so God bless brother George his family he was with us and I translated for him I thought it was going to be an easy task you know I told him I'm GNA translate for you brother George and I I I thought it was gonna be you know okay I seen brother George preach but somehow that day brother George got off the pulpit and he went walking and I'm like I I I stopped I I I couldn't I it was it was too much he was like you know and I'm like so but I I you know I have read in the message where this man told Brother Branham I was I was enjoying what you were preaching but then when the noise came and all the people saying amen and like that I didn't understand what you were saying and I and then brother Brenan said well that's the time for me not to speak but the Holy Spirit to do it remember that amen so I I I just let brother George do what the the spirit you know guided him to do and we had a great time we have great preachers wonderful men of God Amen and we got great singers Stars really star you know and uh I was telling brother John that I saw him about 15 years ago and I never in my mind um I know I'm getting old but in my mind is engraved his his uh his appearance and every time I see I can I I I would not see him for a long time and then I saw him again I that's him you know and and I saw him uh leading the songs over there with brother uh brother Baker when they were having meetings somewhere there and I used to come over there in those meetings and I saw him you know and that and that and I'm like you know if my brother John is going on I'm not gonna stop I gotta keep going too you know that's how I take every John I'm like if he's going I'm going you and it's not that there is no trials and disappointments there is a lot of disappointments you know so um I'm happy to be here God bless you brother John

the Holy Spirit take the war and take it to every heart according to the need in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I want to uh read something that I have that I have uh dear in my heart and that I have expressed many times and uh we we have we have the word we have the message we have listen to the to the messages and sometimes it is impossible for every word that we can have the cot or exactly where brother Bon said it but the scripture says that the Holy Spirit Will Reveal and bring you to remembrance what it what what is there already and we are people who have walked in this message for years and we know when something is according to the prophets and the law amen so but I I I want to I I want to read this and it is in the uh ER the the uh the age of leoa and it is in Spanish in in this books but I know that this is the uh translation when brother Bron was preaching and brother Bron says excuse me there is no salvation in this nation there is no salvation in any Nation salvation is in Christ Jesus sir and only him that is right now I am grateful for a America this is the word of the Prophet I am grateful for America I will I will prefer to live here than any other place in the world hallelujah amen so the there ain't there ain't isn't excuse me there is no salvation in this nation there is no salvation in any nation salvations is in Christ in Jesus Christ and him alone that's right now I am thanful for America I rather live here than any place in the world are you happy for America yes sir I asked you the question are you happy for America I I think there is a lot brother that we go through and there is a lot of a lot of uh negativity there is a lot of bad you know there is a lot of there is a lot of things that that uh uh people get in their minds and we don't appreciate sir what we have you know cuz we hear this bad bad and and everything is bad but this is this is according to brother Branham he will live better in this nation that's right that's right than any other place in the world yes sir hallelujah amen I am thankful for America I rather live here than any place in the world because outside of Canada Canada and the United States is twins we know that neighboring Nations wonderful place but I believe I rather live here than anywhere I know this is a great country Brothers this is a beautiful country we we we need to appreciate yes amen yes sir you know know how how God is been good to us and maybe because I I come from a country you know that really I tell the people if somebody you know should be like messed up in his mind it's me I'm like I I went through terrible things you know uh we used to go to the to the ocean and go to the they make some sort of walls and and the water uh when the when the when the uh when the when the sea Rises up so and then he goes down all the fish and everything that comes into it because of the wall which is made of stones then the water leaves and all the all the fish and crabs and everything stays there and so as a little child I went to this place M you know and and and things that will that will that will cause you harm but you walk in there without shoes and I was six seven years old and I was getting food for for the family with my brother and then the the the fish and and and this uh sea creatures you know they will hide under under a rock or or a hole and I have to I have to put my hand in there you you really have to be brave you know and and many times they C me brother I man I was like oh my God you know C me I I had you know but here I am happy content cuz the Lord has been good to us hallelujah that's why I said there is no country like America I know that we're looking for a city that is not in this world but as far as this world goes and this is the best you know and then I I uh since I come from from from Latin America you know you hear all of these that America is Sodom and gomorra America is this America is that but they don't read that the prophet the last messenger came to this land god send it here and we are blessed people because of the word that was sent to us brothers and sister sisters amen hallelujah so I wanted to read this I wanted to read it because brother Brandon said it and I believe it and I will prosper sir and I will not be put down I am in the best country and I don't care how the economy goes what happened in politics everything I am a blessed person yes because of the message of God in my heart and I believe that you are too Hallelujah he is in control he go brother the Reigns he hold he hold this all of this in his hands nothing is going to move without being his will Hallelujah and you are a blessed people we are a blessed people I don't care how much corruption there is how much evil there is that is good too amen so the Lord be blessed for America Hallelujah yes sir amen tonight I want to speak for for a little bit it's already six I don't know how long I have or how this is going to the Lord lead us but I want to talk about right and the reason that I read that scripture is because Leo means people's Justice and and it is the same or is another way to say it and he says here the name leoda which means people's right and it amazed me me I'm I'm I'm amazed of the word how perfect it is how there there there are seven ages yeah seven churches and how Le was taken as the last one and we know that it represented our time that's right and and how incredible that this is the time where people W right there the word is so perfect bro I'm like man this is all right you know this is so oh and I'm like there is no other age where people fought for rights more than this age you know I was reading even in the times of Joseph Stanley the Russian leader he he just said you're gonna die and you went to die it was like you're going to die and they were like yeah and and you read through history and and people didn't you know it was like this is it not today today there is right everywhere every little something has right you know anything that you think of has right I I tell the church I don't say here but I tell the church even the dogs they have more rights than we have sometimes if they get in the car you know they clean the dog if they whatever they do they clean it if a human being get in the car why are you so messy right everybody is right bro unbelievable and I'm like the prophet was right when he said this is the age of the people's rights oh my goodness but those are their rights Le rights now but when we come to Christ things change Hallelujah the church in its condition paragraph 50 if you got a little bit up where he says I have rights it says uh brother Brandon but we have right that what the Cote says oh he was there 50 sorry yes and that our people don't say that's Presbyterian Catholic that's Pentecostal amen you say I got a right to brother br brother said that's right he didn't say no you don't have it you have it and and this is something that that you know in my heart I'm like with these people that that come with these ideas about brother Brandon being some some sort of a dictator that whatever he said you got to do it or else I'm like these people are wrong they are not speaking truth brother bran didn't come that way he said I will preach the word I will give you the word it's up to you to believe it or not to believe it yes yes sir he didn't come to tell you you either do this or no no people have their own will they can do whatever they want brother BR was not that amen his responsible ability was to bring the word to the people but the seed the child of God and such a privilege to be a child of God Paul in the book of Hebrews said to whom to what Angel did he say my son you are to what Angel did he say you are my son that's right right no angel no creature but when it comes to you and me oh yes sir therefore brother Brandon said who has more power an angel or a son of God sir he said you are a son of God you don't have to be afraid hallelujah amen amen I got I got a right too brother brandham that's right but if you was a lamb you fulfill your rights Hallelujah you become if you are a lamb you you leave those rights out there you are like I came to the house of God I I'm I'm here to hear the Lord speak to me I'm living outside my right of Pride and living outside all of these things about this right I'm I'm getting rid of all of them if if the Lord tell me ENT I will say yes Lord if the Lord says you got to be better I'll be better it doesn't matter how the Lord speak to me my rights are not here no more these are the rights of the Lord hallelujah in can he can say whatever he wants to say Hallelujah remember job he was sick he was in a terrible condition and the Lord in the at the end of almost end of all this trial and difficulty the Lord said stand up like a man nowaday people with rights will say well that that's not soft that that's not consoling to a person who is sick but he didn't come up like that he was Lord I will be quiet and you speak Lord hallelujah he was a man that left his right out and let the Lord have his way amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus paragraph let's go to God's only provided plan uh paragraph 116 like you say about your short hair I am an American citizen I can wear shorts do anything I want to is not illegal does your right but a sheep always forfeits its right you are a lamb hallelujah amen so when we come here we leave all the rights that are outside that the the the the system has given to the people and we say no that's not my right my rights as what the Lord has provided in his word amen hallelujah glory to God but why is this why do we got to leave our rights out the the society gives us and take God's right cuz these are correct the other ones are not correct they are corrupted yes sir amen and the reason they are corrupted is because there is a creature that governs this world Amen the bridge between the edges and the seals paragraph 154 now now we find out where is the book now to his original owner because it has been forfeited by a son the first Son of God in a human race and when he forfit his right to listen to Satan he give up what did he do he accepted Satan's wisdom instead of God's word who is this creature Lucifer amen he was perfect he was wise he had the Seal of perfection according to the scriptures so and he came and took the rights that were given uh to Adam and now he had it on his own but he didn't not know how to handle brother Israel cuz God is the Fountain of all wisdom he gave him wisdom he gave them to be smart amen but God is far beyond God can change anything whenever he wants so Satan and his wisdom started to work on Earth trying to say I haven't lost anything I'm not gonna lose anything I'm gonna I'm gonna make it good I'm gonna with my wisdom I'm gonna make it right but the more he does the the worse he gets hallelujah amen oh that's why the wisdom of this world for us to us is craziness amen for the world we are crazy but to us they are crazy We are following a wisdom that is far beyond what Satan has provided Hallelujah that's why we we give that wisdom outside in with and we take the wisdom of God hallelujah amen oh that's why we got to live in this word that's why we gotta we gotta take every word sometimes we don't understand it amen but the question was not did you understand but the question was did you believe it Hallelujah come like the song says only believe brother Brown and when he heard that he said oh if we can only believe he said if all the reasoning that we have in our mind can we put aside and we can only believe the word oh oh oh I wish tonight that I can believe more than what I believe that I can say oh God I want to believe even more Lord things will be even better Lord any any unbelief anything that is not letting me grow in my faith and believe in you take it away father the wisdom of this world is of the devil amen yes sir that's why they they they look to you and to me like a weird people these people are a strange these people we don't I don't know what they are but is is that they are they they they they are full of the wisdom of this world but we have all wisdom we have the wisdom we have we have God we have the word we got the guidance of the holy spirit in our in our hearts hallelujah amen chrry is the mystery of God revealed 6307 28 paragraph 544 brother Brenan says now if you miss if you go back a little bit notice Lucifer in the last days is doing as he did at the first what did Lucifer do the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom a greater Splendor and seemingly more culture a greater Kingdom that Michael Christ had that's why we have today all of these advancement all of these things that has happening around the world and people claiming rights here and there because this is the age for those things but we have left those things and we are in the age of the word and the more time it takes we got we're going to be even more different yes cuz we are ready to go to our kingdom we are ready to go to our place brothers and sisters so the young people shouldn't get worried about why you said that I don't fit why is it doesn't seem like I don't I don't I don't fit in there you don't have to fit you don't have to try to live what you already have in God to fit in the society God is going to bless you Hallelujah his power amen I believe that I believe that if you stand for the Lord the Lord is going to stand for you and he has stood for us brother George we have had troubles problems but he has been with us Hallelujah and and through the preaching of the word what the what the people of the world call foolishness of the preaching of the word brother we are blessed Hallelujah so don't expect that people outside are going to say how great what you believe they're going to try to put it down even more and more and more only the the people the seed of God are going to catch it and believe it amen God is good the wisdom of this world is against God because the the powers of the air all that influence that is already working in on this Earth has the people's mind all H uh saturated so bad it this is beyond understanding but it's a power and Satan is doing more and more thinking that he's going to fix it the more Hospital the more sickness Satan brings sickness and problems Christ brought Solutions and healing yes sir amen that's right Amen brother bran tells us God did not send us to build hospitals that's right brother said there was a time where the sick people came to [Music] church Hallelujah and I believe that that time is still today because he is the same yesterday today and forever amen Lord he has done it for us we are perfect Hallelujah are you perfect are you saved Hallelujah are you Saint are you a Sanctified person amen message identification 63123 paragraph 99 that don't mean per perfection in yourself you can't be that I stop brother I I I I stop thinking that I I do not qualify I stopped thinking that I I was not worthy to raise my hands to God I sto thinking that because of the issues of life oh I I I'm not good enough I stopped thinking like that and I said oh no Lord you did it all for me Hallelujah and then brother bran said that Perfection is not in you you cannot be that Hallelujah brother bran continue continues there and he says people have forgotten holiness because we are perfect in him and his sacrifice we are not just going to live a loose life we are going to do our best to live a a life of Holiness before him Hallelujah are you not glad are you happy that you are not perfect sir he said that you cannot be perfect but he is perfect and I am in him Hallelujah and I I I I claim all the rights that he has bought for me for me yes amen message the token paragraph 142 brother B says Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved are you baptized are you saved I am saved no one nothing can tell me I'm not saved sir come on on there is nothing there is no I'm already baptized the right way Hallelujah oh I'm so glad brother the Revelation the message that God gave us in this age he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned this things shall follow them that believe how far to all the worlds to every creature in my name they shall cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues take up servants or drink deadly things he won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover apply the token and then claim your rights now you leave the rights of the world out there and you say I have no right the only rights I have is what Christ B for me the right that I have is to sit and listen L to the word and say Amen to it and worship Him Hallelujah that's what I have but that's not the only thing that he has given you he has given you the right to be healed Hallelujah brother if you are sick you are not sick because of God you are sick because of what the Satan has put in this world but he came to redeem us and now we have right and I have the right to tell Satan get away from [Music] me Hallelujah I have the right to be happy I have the right to be contempt I have the right to come and worship the Lord I have the right to come brothers and sisters and be clean before him Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so after all we are not without right we have right amen hallelujah do you love the Lord tonight blessed be his name are we happy sir you have rights to be healed you have rights for the things that you want in your life brother Brandon says and I had the cat but I didn't give it to the brother he said you have a right for all your family to be saved I am afraid that we have not claimed that right too much but it's a right amen we have the right to Worship the Lord amen no sin no problem no issue is going to come before me worshiping him brother it's so sad when people put their salvation and the worship and on the Lord according to their deeds no I I I can't tonight I'm I'm heavy loaded right and you see this you know going through the through the people that one day brother the church is so in fire you know people are praising God and then they come to the next service and they are like heavy loaded why why is that brother George like you said brother Armando how how do you keep these people all the time just singing and and going on cuz God is interested in a lot of things but one thing he's he is interested in is to look for [Music] worshippers and I have found out that when people worship God the miracle happen yes sir I have found out that when people raise their voices and they say oh God I'm here you know me Lord something happen yes sir miracles happen you find people in the scripture when they when they came to the Lord they didn't come in the right condition uh remember the the the copes woman he called them dog remember that she was not coming in the right way she had issues she was a gentile amen but she did one thing he said that she fell on her on her feet and worship I think that the people what they need today is that we have a lot of knowledge we know the Seven Seals yes sir we know that brother bran will resurrect from the dead do you believe that we know that we know about the two the the the two witnesses over there in Jerusalem we know all of that yes but the question is do we worship God oh God that's question amen hallelujah I'm not going to do this Brothers I'm gonna leave it here but I told my congregation am I your pastor they say yes what does the Bible say about your pastor obey him say so you are going to obey me we worship we're going to worship God yes stand on your feet not you stay there that's what I tell them stand on your feet now you're going to raise your hands they said nobody I don't feel like it that doesn't matter obedience is better than [Music] sacrifices obedience is fair that an I feeling right brother believe me I have come to church loaded many times I had come to the pulpit oh with issues things that had happened you know I have seen parents come to church because they have a little something with Johnny that he didn't want to get in the car or get ready or whatever and he had to turn he had to call the attention of this young man and then they come to church say I'm not worthy to worship because I got mad what what is that Jonah was mad and the Lord spoke to him he said Jonah are you mad he said I am mad Lord he said yeah I'm talking to you now the Lord can talk to anybody whether you sad you whatever you have he is our solution he brought the wisdom the real wisdom to us hallelujah hallelujah amen oh Hallelujah if it is for for the Lord give it give a clap of hand with all your strength Hallelujah brother Bon says oh you Satan you have no right you had it but you have no right he stripped them out of you on the cross he got right over me over my life it's not an imagination is real amen amen and when people are under his right yes he can do whatever he wants with them but blessed be the name of the Lord yes sir the one
