Father, let the word of God settle into our hearts like never before tonight, oh God, that we receive from you. Father, we look to you, the author and the finisher of our faith. Lord, we don't look to the left or to the right. We look to you, Lord, to move forward. As our brother is singing there, we're almost home. It's any day now. A few more turns in the road and we'll be out of here. Prophecies are being fulfilled, Lord. Every moment we see what's happening in Israel, the time piece. We see our nation, see the church. Then Lord, we look at our lives and we know we need something from you &gt;&gt; to have rapturing faith. Lord, &gt;&gt; that is the requirement for the rapture is to have rapturing faith. And we need that tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what our heart's desire is above anything else. And Lord, I just pray that we move one step closer to that. I believe, Lord, many of us have more than perhaps we realize. You've been so good to us. When the pressure comes and the squeeze comes, I believe we have more than what we realize. Lord, reveal it to us even greater the things that you've been doing all these years, building it up, making it up. Let it be tonight, Lord, another piece of the puzzle of our lives being unfolded that we'll know who we are and where we stand. Oh God, let it be is our prayer. We stand the test, Lord, to not move from that position that you called us to. Lord, we just know any day now. Just please help us. We pray. Get into the word, Lord, now and begin to minister to our needs. We ask from the young ones, even the old ones, even the youngest ones, even the oldest ones. Lord just grant it. I pray.

Amen. &gt;&gt; I'd like to go to the word of the Lord. Brother Bobby, is this your last week here? &gt;&gt; Two more. Okay. So, we want to make sure we can say uh goodbye or something properly to you. All right. &gt;&gt; Good to have you. We love how many you love brother Bobby and sister camera. They start looking at each other and looking at the spotlight on them. All right. So, tonight we'll just take a few moments and we'll go into the scripture. If you'll take your Bibles and turn with me to uh First Kings chapter 19 and stand, we'll read the word here. There was a funeral in um Mesa today. Brother David Carpenter, he's brother Carpenters's last sibling. I believe the youngest last one remaining. Is that right? I think so. He passed and they had that funeral today at 2 or 2:30 there at the Mesa Church. So, that service is cancelled. But we want to pray for that family. &gt;&gt; Lord will brother Lee and I forget Lee's sister's name. &gt;&gt; Julie. Julie. Yes. And that grandkids and all of that. The Lord will bless them and help them along. Amen. First Kings 19. Let's start with verse number 13. And it was so when Elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave. And behold, there came a voice unto him and said, "What do thou hear, Elijah? And he said, "I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I only am left." And they seek my life to take it away. And the Lord said unto him, "Go return unto thy way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when thou comest, anoint Hazel to be king of Syria, and Johi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Sheaphhat of Abel Mihah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room. And it shall come to pass that him that escaped the sword of Hazel shall Jahu slay. him that escape from the sword of Jahus shall Elisha slay. I'm sorry. Hes shall Ju slay. In him that escaped from the sword of Jahus shall Elisha slay. Yet I have left me 7,000 in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. So he departed thence and found Elisha the son of Sheaphat who was plowing with 12 yolk of oxen before him and he with the 12th. Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him and he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and says let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, "Go back again, for what have I done to thee?" And he returned back from him, took a yolk of oxen, slew them, boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. Amen. We'll take one more scripture in Mark chapter 1 again. Let's take actually uh Matthew chapter 7 verse 29. Matthew 7:29. It's pretty much saying the same thing as Mark 1, but I wanted to take this one. For he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes. Lord Jesus, we pray you'll bless your word today. This portion of the word again, Lord, may it uh touch every heart is our prayer. We know that your word will not return void. It has power in it in it all by itself. And you just ask us to believe it, Lord. Father, strike our faith that we can believe it and that we will believe it. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. We've been talking about authority. That was my title this morning, authority. But we've been on these orders of adoption. And so we got into this Roman centurion and Jarius, the believer who was a worker in the house in the synagogue. And the prophet of God is bringing to us bringing to us that this Jarius was taught as a Jew to lay hands and have to as a Jewish custom to have hands laid upon him and the need that he needed he needed hands laid upon him. But brother Random tells us that the gentile the Roman centurion was taught authority. And so the Lord takes this uh kind of a natural or carnal discipline of operation and he uses that uh to get a point across to us that this man when he finally came to Jesus they both went to the right place. They both had the right approach but the way they got what they needed was quite different. The gentile claimed that all you have to do is speak a word Lord and my servant will live. And he was speaking of the authority that Jesus had. He recognizes he recognized his authority. And this authority is what the prophet said that God is trying to get the church to. He's trying to teach the believers to have this kind of a faith. I believe that's the kind of faith we need in this hour. &gt;&gt; And I believe and I thank God for the for the the other faith and the other things that will bring us to and through and the helps that we have like you know special meetings are help and youth meetings are health and Bible studies and you know the different things that are associated with church. Um but we know that the believer will stay with the word no matter what the conditions are. You can put them in some place that's dysfunctional and a believer is going to hold his testimony. &gt;&gt; If he has to keep it by himself, he'll keep it by himself. And that's what you and I are. We are true believers. And this is where our faith is. And this is what we're trying to encourage you towards today as we see things change right before us. I've never seen a day like this day. and um so many changes in the message in the world and the things around us and so it requires a tremendous faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so many hearts are discouraged but this is not the time to be discouraged. &gt;&gt; This is the time to be encouraged. Amen. Amen. So Lord help us. Now the prophet as we stopped off the angel versus a son. Brother Bannon makes this statement here in kinsman redeemer and he makes this statement. He says now sons and daughters who has the most power before God. What is an angel? He says an angel is a servant. That's right. They're his servants. What are you? His son and daughter. Who has the most power in heaven? Uh uh who has the most power in heaven then? A sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side. The sinner that's been saved by grace has it say being said that so we can understand who we are as sons and daughters of God. Our authority in heaven is greater than that of an archangel. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, you got to internalize that and think that through. It's greater. Our authority on the earth is greater. Our authority as a son is greater. When a sinner gets down and you get down on your knees to pray and your little heart is hurting for whatever it's hurting for or you have a request in your life, which we all do, that authority that you come with is the highest of all of God's creation. is that relationship that he's ha that he made with you and that covenant that he's made with you. You know, the whole world and the ecosystem and the solar system and all of the systems that makes the world go around and do what it does, there's nothing more important than a true believer. In fact, if you take the believers out, your city's going down. It is the righteousness of the believers that's keeping the judgments off of the city that you live in. Remember Abraham with Lot. &gt;&gt; Lord was going to destroy that city. And he says, "Lord," Abraham asked, "Lord, would you destroy the righteous with the wicked?" And the Lord says, "No, I won't. If there's 10 there, if there's five, if there's 50 people in the wicked city, would you save that city?" The Lord said, "I'll save the city for 50 righteous." What about 40? What about 45? What about 30, Lord? What about 10? And he just And quickly you begin to know it's not about the number of righteous. It says, "Is there any righteous?" &gt;&gt; And if there's any righteous, the Lord's got his eye upon them. And he says, "I will not destroy the righteous with the wicked." &gt;&gt; Beautiful. And so we thank and we thank the Lord for all the protections police department and the the state police and and all of our nuclear whatever we have. That's not what holding this nation together. It's the believers. It's those that have the fear of the Lord. And so this um is what the prophet is trying to bring to us to to and I and you just have to ask yourself why would he's make making this such a strong comparison. I think if I saw an angel run through here or standing near me or somewhere like this, I would probably be very afraid, wouldn't you? I would probably want to get out of there or for whatever reason because that's a little too much. I I'm used to just the natural things. But the reality is is that the angels of God are encamped around those that fear him. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible said. &gt;&gt; We can't see them, but we can feel their presence and their influence if we look real good. &gt;&gt; We're just real just conscious just a little bit. The angels are present with us. And God has used these angels for many reasons throughout history through the Bible. But here the prophet now is taking these strong statements and saying who has more authority in heaven. So the angel wants something and the son wants something. God uh the prophet tells us that the believer has more authority than an angel. Beautiful. And he says they're his servants. What are you? His son and daughter. Who has the most power in heaven then? The sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that's standing by his right side. The sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that stood by his side without sin cuz he's a son. Son has more authority than a servant. Of course. Oh, we forget what we are. We forget many times what made us what we are. After we become what we are, then we forget how we got here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Prophet continues in the same thought in Revelations chapter 4 1961. He says, "Now is an angel a higher order than a man or a lower order?" The congregation answers him obviously. He says, "All right, sir. Which is the greatest, a son of God or an angel?" Son of God. Which would God hear the best? An angel standing there before him pleading for something or one of you all pleading? One of you all. See, cuz your sons and daughters, they're they're servants. See, they're servants and your sons and daughters. So, we see what authority you have. We're just afraid to use it. Now, these are not my words. This is the words of the seventh angel. He said, "This is the authority that we have. &gt;&gt; This is what been given to us. You have that authority. &gt;&gt; Yes, you have it right here in Tucson. You have it right on your job. Wherever you're going, you're a son of God. &gt;&gt; That's the high point. It's that's the highest point. You made it, sister. You made it, my brother. You're a son of God." Yes. &gt;&gt; And that authority of all of heaven is behind you. &gt;&gt; Oh, can we have faith for that? &gt;&gt; If you would come and pray for me or an angel would come and pray for me, many of us because of the way we're taught or our thinking before knowing these things, we'd say, "Well, I want the angel to come and pray for me." But really, it's a son of God that knows how to pray for another son of God. It's a son of God that really knows how to worship. &gt;&gt; It's a son of God that knows what redemption is all about. &gt;&gt; We were lost, but now we're saved. We were sick, but then he healed us. We had troubles, then he brought us through. That's an experience that we go through as sons and daughters of God. This is why when we meet people on our job and they're going through these troubles of their life and you begin to testify to them, the experience that you have as a son or daughter of God, it goes so far, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; It's your testimony. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You don't have to make it up. It's the same. It's a testimony. You can tell it 20 years from now, 50 years from now, it is your testimony. That's what the Lord has done for you. It's an experience that you had and you can share that with other people. And God uses men to bring other men in. That's how he does it. &gt;&gt; He uses men and all their falls and failures and the foolishness of preaching, low IQ, maybe not the most best looking. Some of them they don't have teeth. Some of them are they slumber. They they have all these other things. But God will use those vessels to fill his kingdom with &gt;&gt; because um because that's his choice. Amen. &gt;&gt; He uses sons and daughters of God. Amen. He doesn't use the most qualified. Doesn't use the ones that look like they're the most talented. He used whoever he wants to use. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He chose the foolishness. He chose a Paul. You think he'd have got somebody that didn't have this guilt in his life of seeing Stephen stone, but he chose Paul and elected Saul and Paul and changed him and used him to be the greatest one of the greatest missionaries the world has ever known. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He does that. That's the God that we serve. So here the prophet is bringing this to us this authority that you as sons and daughters of God that we have and this example with the Roman centurion and um uh Jarius is um in the Bible for that purpose to show us now the authority it's beautiful when you think of it this Roman centurion it it it would take him as I was looking it up for him to get that uh to to be a commissioned soldier like that and just be over a hundred men. It's it's it would take him 10 to 20 years of being in the army in the service. He's not a nobody. He's a man. This is somebody that knows how to work with people and different kinds of people. So this is how he understands authority. You have some people they they they they you know you tell them to go get and then you have others that are commanding and giving those orders. And it's amazing how in our training and our teaching as young men and young women, how God is trying to train us and teach us and mature us that many times in particular, I would say this age because this is the age that I'm living in. I this probably was going on a 100 years ago. I don't know. But particularly this age, you have so many people they show up on the job and they just have this entitlement. They want to eat the fruit from plants and trees that did not plant. They want to they want to reap the harvest from an orchard that they didn't water. They want to show up and just begin picking the fruit. You'll see this many times. And so they don't want to go through those stages of bumping and bruises. They want to come in and they're positioned and just everything just be perfect. And so there's no, you know, no challenges against them, no setbacks. And they they uh they'll come in and they'll see a gift or a talent or they'll see someone that's doing it well or doing it right. They say, "Oh, that's what I want to be." And they get the opportunity. Well, this is what you need to do to be that. Oh, no. I want a shortcut. And so they'll scheme and they'll scam to try to get where they want to go. But I'm here to declare to you that all the years of training that the Lord has us in, he's not wasting any time on any of us. &gt;&gt; And he's not in a hurry. Even if you are, &gt;&gt; he's going to take his time with you until you are ready to move on to the next stage. &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm glad about that because men will try to move you on. I remember I think I shared this before. I remember when I was seeking the Holy Ghost, a festive sister, she was one of the people that helped witness to me. She's gone on now. She said, "Brother Israel, what are you what are you always at the altar for, friends?" I I need the Holy Ghost. He said, "Well, Brother Israel, you have the Holy Ghost. Everybody can see that." And I was like, "Well, you know, I I need that assurance in my life." Oh, don't worry about it. You You're already in the message. You have the Holy Spirit. You know, that's a good way to Okay. All right. Well, Sister So and so said, "I had it, so I'm going to take that to the rapture." No, I don't think so. No. No. I need the assurance in my heart. &gt;&gt; And it might be true I might have had something but I needed something greater than what I had. &gt;&gt; And there is nobody that can advance you along to the next stage. Your pastor can't, your parent can't, the person, your coach, the person that witnessed to you, they can't move you along. The Holy Spirit has to do that. &gt;&gt; Can I preach for a few minutes? &gt;&gt; Yes. This is the training and the teaching. Brother Bam says, "What's happening here with Elijah and Elisha?" He takes that mantle and he touches Elisha with the mantle to see if the mantle was going to fit him. And he says that it took about 10 years for that mantle to fit him right. So here he is following Elijah and Elisha. Remember the Lord already told Elijah. One of the very rare places in the scripture where the Lord is showing who a successor is. And this is a problem with many churches. They don't know who the successor is. And so you have these man-made, you know, they're running like a family business or this one is next in line or this one is in charge. But God has to put that in order. He told Moses Joshua would take your place. He told Elijah, Elisha will take your place. And so it's a beautiful thing when you know what is the next uh uh uh the next the the the transition of the power of the order. So the Lord tells Elijah, "Go anoint him." He anoints him by throwing his uh uh uh mantle on him. The prophet tells us in the message the um oh secondhanded robe I'll get to it in a minute that it took him 10 years. 10 years to fit a role that was his. How long did it take for King David? You remember he was anointed as a little boy. He's a teenager. He didn't get anointed as king until he was 30 years old. &gt;&gt; And he has documents that the prophet anointed him with the oil that you take Saul's place. &gt;&gt; But look at all that he went through to to in order to take that place in that position. &gt;&gt; What about you and I? I was reading this guy this uh Gladwell I think Malcolm Gladwell. He's the intellectual years ago. He wrote a book on um I can't remember he me wrote several books but one of the things he brought out is this um the idea of 10,000 hours. How many's heard that it's about a 10,000 hour about a 10year the scientists and they they look at the people especially musicians that are very highly skilled musicians. It takes about 10,000 hours. It's just a number they throw out there. These are scientists. These are this is the world in carnality. But this is the number they come out with. It takes about 10,000 hours for you to perfect your craft. &gt;&gt; So So it's like like if who do you want performing surgery on you? That's what it I mean even painting your house. You want a master craftsman or you just want anybody know how to paint? Because everybody's got a brush. But a cra a a master craftsman been doing it for a while &gt;&gt; and he's got some insights for you &gt;&gt; now. Everybody a little sign on the building, a little thing on their truck, a little business card talking about he's an electrician. You better be careful. &gt;&gt; You want somebody who really knows what he's doing. And this this uh 10,000 hours rule comes out to about 10 years of you doing what you was called to do and doing it consistently. 10,000 hours. It's a it's a beautiful thing. And it's interesting how the Lord says this is how long it took Elijah and Elisha to get this across. Let me take it in the message. Second added robe here. What pro the prophet of God says here. Now notice paragraph 39. Elijah then after he threw this robe on him, he tried it on him. In other words, Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God on his shoulders, he came down and laid it across Elisha the farmer to see if it would fit him. And it taken about 10 years to get altar to fit that mantle. You know, God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up. &gt;&gt; Now, he didn't alter the robe to fit Elisha. He ordered Elisha to fit the robe. &gt;&gt; And that's what he does today. He alters us to fit the robe, not the robe to fit us. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? He alters us to fit the quote, not the quote to fit us. &gt;&gt; You got to fit the quote. Don't make the quote fit you. You need to change. You got to lose the carnal weight to put on this message. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; He alters the man to fit the robe. He alters us to fit the robe, not the robe to fit us. Sometimes we want to make the robe fit us, but we can't do that. You got to let be altered yourself for the robe. It's God's robe and he made it perfect. He has got to bring us into that realm to make the robe fit us. So, we can't be perfect ourselves. We know we can't. There's no way for us to be. And yet, he said for us to be. So, but what did he He made a propitiation for us. The Lord Jesus Christ and his righteousness. There's where the perfection comes of ignoring our own holiness of which we have none, our own thoughts which we have not. We ought not to be. But we rest solemnly upon the finished work of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; God sent him to the earth and it was him that we rest. &gt;&gt; Notice all these years, as far as we know, he just had that one baptism of the robe going over him. But through the years, God had molded the man's character into a place to where after his call that he would fit into the robe and be the servant of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when Elijah passed through and throwed it on him and they started up towards Gilgal and many of other places they went on in the school of the prophets and the road journey and on. Finally, Elijah was trying to get Elijah to turn back. Did you notice it? Trying to get him to turn back. Otherwise, maybe the road is a little too steep for you, son. Maybe it's a little too narrow for you to walk. Isn't that something? &gt;&gt; So, this is perhaps what our tests and trials are all about, &gt;&gt; huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Lord is trying to get this message, get you to fit these quotations. You take a series like this, this is already here. This doesn't need to change, &gt;&gt; but somebody else does. That somebody is me. &gt;&gt; And I want to I want to put that on. I want it tailor made. I want it to be what I'm wearing. I wanted to be the bride's garment. &gt;&gt; She was araid in white. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the word of the Lord. And so, &gt;&gt; are we being tailored today? &gt;&gt; Are we being trimmed up? Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing how so many Christians want to to continue on the way they've always done things. &gt;&gt; But we, the true believer, want to be trimmed up so that we can fit the robe of his righteousness. &gt;&gt; He's got a way for us. And there's a plan that he laid for us. And this this centurion wasn't just a newcomer. He had been in the military for years now in order for him to have this position. And the Lord uses him as an example. And you can't you can't really operate in that authority if you can't accept the authority. You come up in those ranks and you have to get the experience and then you learn how to, you know, you learn how to to to to take orders. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; You learn how to I know I know we all know how to give them, but we need to know how to take the orders. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who's in charge today? Who wants to be in charge? Well, I do. I sure do. Yeah, I'll be in charge. I think I can handle it. Be in charge for a year. Who wants to take orders for a year? No. All right. No, not me. But you got to have both in order to be a real good soldier. And this is the Lord using this example. So Elisha now 10 years of following Elijah and the promise was there that he was to take Elijah's place. Here Elijah now is trying to discourage him and um you know it's it's really sad how this age has been so feminized. The men culture has just totally been feminized on every level and it's constantly a feeling, a game of feelings and trying to work with people's feelings and trying to make sure everybody feels okay and they feel good and don't offend anyone. Well, saints, that's just not life. It's not real. It's fake. And if you got a ministry or if you're in a relationship and it's all about feeling, that's a fake relationship. It's not honest. That is not the scriptures. The scriptures are there to keep you lined up, to keep me lined up. And it would be false for me to go down that path of making sure like every every task that's given, you're given a task here, young man, you need to go take care of this or young sister, you need to take care of that. and you're given that task and hey everybody's not appreciating you in that task. Well, we can make sure we go over there and courage and keep the back rub going so so you don't get, you know, just keep it just keep an eternal just keep an eternal feel good. That's is not life. The wild would eat you up. &gt;&gt; You're living out there. You that just it doesn't work that way, saints. I mean, that's not human. That's not correct. That's false. And this is what Satan is trying to do. He's trying to present this false um version of the truth or Christianity to the people. And that thing try to woo itself in here. And then we, you know, it's the point where, you know, the pastor doesn't want to mention anything negative. He doesn't want to say talk about hell and condemnation and and those things. And it's just not correct. &gt;&gt; And um God help us is all I can say. God help us just to be honest, to be truthful because when we stand there on that day, you're going to be so glad that somebody told you the truth. &gt;&gt; I am so glad that this man told the truth. &gt;&gt; Even if it was his family, his own church, the other ministers, he told the truth. &gt;&gt; It was uncomfortable sometimes, but he did it in love, didn't he? And it helps us when we hear the clear, clean truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's like a good coach. He'll tell you, you know, and the coach in football, Chris would know this. You have what you call tryyous. You know, all those kids showing up for tryyouts and then everybody wants to be the quarterback. Everybody wants to be a running back or a receiver. Of course, you show up there, what, son? What position you want to be? Oh, I want to be the running back. I want number 32 or I want number 33 and you call your number. You want to call. So it doesn't work that way, son. You got to we got to go to practice. That's not your skill set. So a a true coach, an honest coach will tell you, you know what, that's not the position for you. Um here's your position. Here's the number you're going to get. And you know, I've seen it so many times that on the field that the kid wants to quit. He wants to leave because the coach and then he gets the parents involved. Then parents come and argue with the coach that you're not playing my son. And look, if we play your son, we're going to lose. &gt;&gt; You want to hear the truth? If we play your son or my son, we going to lose. But, you know, if we want to have fun, we can go to the park and have fun. &gt;&gt; But if we're having an organized team sport and we want to win, &gt;&gt; we want the best players playing, don't we? &gt;&gt; Am I right or wrong? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You know, and so even in on the streets, you know, the kids with these little pickup games will play football and the two best guys usually be the captains. And you begin you begin to pick your team. You pick your side. And you know the little sorry ones get picked last. You know how that is. You're just like, "Oh, you going to pick me? You going to pick nobody wants to like, all right, come on." But no matter how sorry you are, if you're on the winning team, you can brag just like the star player brag. Oh man, you're so sorry. Hey, but we won though. &gt;&gt; And that's what it's all about is, well, are you on the winning team? &gt;&gt; It don't matter. I didn't get the ball. It doesn't matter. I wasn't the star player. I'm on the winning team. &gt;&gt; And you know, that's what progress is. That's what the believers want. That's what you know as you're being trained these soldiers no doubt to become a centurion I think to become a captain in the navy it's 10 years or in the army it's four or five years after being a road soldier and then they then you're able to move up into those ranks. In other words, the point is you don't just come in at the top. There's some training involved. There's a time element there. And that time element is there to train and get you to know who you are. And let's say it is 10,000 hours. Let's say that is a good rule of thumb. 10 years of you doing whatever you think your talent is. And then you've become a master in that trade. You're a physician, a heart surgeon, and you've done it 10,000 hours. You have seen a lot. Your experience brings a lot to the table. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if you know when when this age is over, we're not going to heaven. After this age, we're going to a thousand years of a millennial reign. &gt;&gt; How many know that &gt;&gt; that is on the plan? &gt;&gt; Yeah. After after this age is over, the seventh age, then we have the marriage and the wedding supper. And then the Jews come into their kingdom. They come into their faith and God uses them and calls them. Then the saints come back on the earth and rule and reign &gt;&gt; for a thousand years. &gt;&gt; This is just a rehearsal. &gt;&gt; This is just a practice ground. &gt;&gt; We just come from the meetings in Bayer, New Mexico. So Bayard, that that little town. Bayard is a not a parish. I forget the name they call it. It has a name there. It's not a town, but you know, there are all these two or three little towns. Bayard, Santa Clara, and then Silver City. And in order to be a city or town, you have to have, I think, three or four businesses or five businesses. And one of those towns has exactly five. So one brother, he's not from that town. He kind of rolled his eyes said, "Yeah, they're a town because they have one more business than us." And this is how these little little towns are are established. And the the city of Bayard, there was a believer that was the mayor of that town. Fine, brother. He's retired from that. He was a mayor. Went to brother Mark's church. And I began to think, who who's running this town? Who's running this city? Who has the qualifications? Now, this town has one light through the city. If you miss that light and if you get lost in this town, that's on you for real. That's on you because this is not like Phoenix or LA. It's not even like Tucson. It's like a one road and you got a few little things. How you going to get lost in this town? But I begin to think about this great millennium that we're coming to and are you able to reign and rule in those cities? You know, the the the bride will be ruling and reigning during that time. She's given jurisdiction to cover and landscape to keep and he's they're ruling with Christ during this thousand years. and and we you know some of the little simp simple things that we can't seem to fully overcome. I believe we are overcoming them. I believe that with with the message coming and it's great you know it's it's so comprehensive. We have it in the books and tapes. We have it at all times where we can listen to it that it's really bringing us up in our faith. I believe that. I believe this message more now than ever before. And I believe it's equipping me and equipping the believer to really be something that they never thought they could be. &gt;&gt; It's really that's what the word is there for, to build you up. And I wonder, am I ready to rule or to govern even a little neighborhood in that great city? See, this is all not for nothing. We're going to the millennium. We got a thousand years of peace here on the earth in the millennium. &gt;&gt; So, what are we to be today? What should we be today? Now, here what the prophet of God says here in the secondhanded robe as I prepare to wind down. He says, paragraph 111, the thing that the world needs this morning is the power of God, the God of Elijah. You might have spoke with tongues and shouted and run over the floor. But what we need is the power of God of Pentecost to produce the the lives and things that was lived in that day in the apostolic power. A secondhanded robe was all right, but he needed a fresh call in his heart from God. He needed fresh anointing from God. He roar a secondhanded robe when he come to the river. But he needed a brand new fresh-handed call from God and a firsthanded power from God to perform the miracle. And my brother, don't you be afraid to ask God anything. &gt;&gt; You must demand God or ask God for anything that he has promised. Amen. &gt;&gt; For if I am introducing a God that's omnipotent and all powerful, and if I be a servant of God, I must do the works of God. &gt;&gt; And if I do the works of God, I must demand of God to bring these things to pass &gt;&gt; because he is demanding of me to produce the impossible. &gt;&gt; I have to ask him. I have to call upon him and stand there and say, "God, you promised it. &gt;&gt; So do you." &gt;&gt; Every person. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So we have to demand God to bring his word to pass. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; What he said would happen, I have to ask him. &gt;&gt; I have to demand of him. And this is what Elisha did. He says, "I want a double portion." 10 years of training, 10 years of watching Elisha, watching Elijah, watching him, watching the prophet, watching his style, watching the way he did things. And uh Elijah tries to tell him to go back. Go ahead and stay back. And some of us, you know, we have to be encouraged all the time. Here Elijah is discouraging him, &gt;&gt; trying, you know, stay back. go on back. No, no, I will. I'll stay with you. My soul will not leave from you. He follows him on and follows him to the next city and follows him as he knows he's getting ready to leave. Crosses Jordan, follows him and Elijah asked him, "What do I want to do with you? What are you asking of me?" He says, "I want a double portion of your spirit." And he said, "You've asked a hard thing, but if you see me when I go, you can have it." Oh my. This is the attitude of the believer. We ask for the impossible. &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints? &gt;&gt; That's what we ask for. We ask for the impossible because he's given this authority to the believers. And I'm I'm afraid that we're we're not catching it all the time. We're a little afraid of it. He says it in here. Brother Bham says, "I'm afraid." We're afraid sons and daughters. He says that we have that authority. We have that power, but we're afraid to use it. I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority. I'm afraid the Holy Ghostborn men doesn't realize their authority &gt;&gt; or the authority that God has permitted to his church. &gt;&gt; That's in the message, Who is God? Paragraph 12. He says, Joshua stopped the sun. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "All things are possible with God. Nothing impossible, but all things are possible to you also." &gt;&gt; Nothing impossible to them that believe. All things are possible brought right down and made you if you just know who God is. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm afraid that the church doesn't know their authority. I'm afraid the Holy Ghostborn men doesn't realize their authority or the authority that God has permitted to his church. Let's take a scripture here in Luke chapter 10 real quick. I have one I have two more points. I want to bring this and we'll close Luke chapter 10. Jesus gives the disciples gives them power and authority to cast out devils. Verse 18 says, "And he said unto them, I beheld Satan and lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Not withstanding in this, rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because of what? &gt;&gt; Because your name is written in heaven. You see the predestination again. &gt;&gt; You see your position in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, it's a beautiful thing to have the power and the authority and to know that Satan had fallen when they went through these towns and healed the sick and cast out devils. And Jesus tells them that the serpents and the scorpions, you have power over them and all power of the enemy. And this one I like very much. He says, "And nothing shall by any means harm you." &gt;&gt; Nothing can harm you. Oh my. Do you believe that today? &gt;&gt; You know, it's just a time of fear and and every time you're fearful, the enemy is telling you or the people are telling you how to protect yourself and how to, you know, if you're afraid of this, this is what you need to do. You need to have this, you need to buy this, you need to have all of this to protect yourself. But there's nothing that can hurt a true believer. &gt;&gt; This scripture tells us nothing shall by any means hurt you. This gives me a liberty to know that when I go in Jesus' name that he's got me covered. &gt;&gt; And I believe that I really can't, as much as I will try to defend myself and my family. No question about it. I do what I can to defend myself, defend my family, defend whoever I needed to defend. But I know good and well I cannot even take care of myself. &gt;&gt; You think you you have all this protection, you have all this, everybody, all the thieves have that plus &gt;&gt; everything you got, they got a bigger caliber. They got more of it and they got the illegal version of it &gt;&gt; because they're lawb breakakers. And where you're trying to believe in and stay within the confines of the law, they're going to break the law and have whatever they feel like they want. &gt;&gt; Is that right, brother Bob? But God is our protection. &gt;&gt; And there is nothing by any means can harm you. &gt;&gt; But he says, don't even rejoice over that. Don't rejoice that nothing will harm you. Don't rejoice that you have power over all the enemy. Don't rejoice that Satan fell down before your feet. But rejoice because your name was written in heaven. &gt;&gt; Why? Because in heaven you have an authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That authority is the highest of all authorities of any angel. &gt;&gt; Is the authority of the sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; This is what the prophet's trying to show us that we have this authority. So we are moving into another position. Can I close with this last point? Adoption number three par adoption number four sorry prophet makes this statement here. It goes into that inheritance of the believer and he says this here, paragraph number 75. How long has the prophet been off the scene since 1965 to 2025? Has been how long? Help me. 60 years. He's been off the scene. But his message and tapes have grown. His ministry today is bigger than what it was when he was preaching at the Brandom Tabernacle. Can we say amen to that? They didn't have all the tapes confined in one place to be able to give it all out like we have today. And they're still interpreting other languages as we speak. It's a great tremendous work. Do you think the people that's following the message are more equipped now than they were 50 years ago? I say yes. I say we have more information. I don't know when this book came out, but I guarantee you they didn't have it when he preached it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there God has given us this great tremendous word of the Lord. And we are in the the nastiest age that you could ever live in. An age of disrespect on every level. An age of ungratefulness and an age of total terror. And people are just mad and angry. The races are angry at one another. Human beings are angry at one another. People, family members are just angry at one another. Churches and people just this the the lack of love has grown people to be so cold and hard that even they will beat up an old woman or an old man. Young people disrespectful to elders on so many levels. But God in his great love and mercy has given us a great and tremendous message. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Yes. He's given us a great and tremendous message. And we got to we we we we can't stay here the way we are right now. We have to leave out of here. And we've been in training for some time. And we have been hearing these things for some time. I'm closing right now. &gt;&gt; And we're we're in a training. We've seen things happen. We've seen people who are church people. We've seen churches split. We've seen things happen. We've seen people just do all kind of things. Pastors and groups change their theology and even believers won't even fellowship with other believers because of some doctrine. We've seen that, haven't we? &gt;&gt; But we're being trained, aren't we? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it can't be everybody likes us. It can't be everything is great all the time. It's just, you know, this high and we're just so, you know, we're just bubbling over with joy and happiness and just glee and no test, no trials. That's just not real. &gt;&gt; Now, the joy of the Lord is always with us. But we can go through some tests and some trials that will simply cause us to weep and really cause us to hurt. And some of us are going through that right now. Amen. And and and and others are going through even greater things, right? And we know and we hear these stories. But here you know this great uh beautiful message that has been given to us is now calling us from from you know just being a church member just coming in the message to something even greater. And let me let the prophet let's read it here just a minute. Um he says he he has predestinated us to this inheritance. Drops down. He says, "But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time Jesus, the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance." To be what? What inheritance? The sunship to be a son of God. Now, this may just choke you to death, but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? How many ever know that? How many knows that Jesus said so? The Bible Jesus said, "Did not your law say itself that ye are God's?" And so, Brother Bam goes on. He says, "And uh he says uh and he he'll take every power that Satan's got away from him." Yes, sir. It belongs to him. He's the logos that went out of God. That is true. That was the son of God. Then he made man that little God. And they said, "If they call those who the word of God come to, the prophets, if they call them gods, who the word of God came to, God said so himself that they were gods." He told Moses, "I made you a god and made Aaron your prophet." Amen. Woo! I know I act a little like a religious crank, but I'm not. Oh, your eyes can come open and see those things. All right. He made man a god. A god in his domain. &gt;&gt; And your domain goes from sea to sea, from shore to shore. He has the control of it. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came being the one God without sin, he proved it. When the winds blow, he said, "Peace be still." And when the trees, he says, "No man eat from thee." Verily I say unto you, that's little gods. If you'll say to this mountain, &gt;&gt; be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that you what you said it will come to pass. You can have what you said. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are there any little gods in here? &gt;&gt; Now, there's a false doctrine in the word of faith movement and they've used this uh principle that god begets other gods. So, they're really junior gods and they're going around and that's why they can get a private jet and multi-million dollars because it's they're God's uh servants. They are gods walking in that authority, but they've denied the word. So, how can they be a god? &gt;&gt; They rejected the word, the purity of it. And so, there's this idea, this proud, boastful thought of being like a god, like Satan. take the knowledge but not take the character. &gt;&gt; So, it's like following the message but not living it. &gt;&gt; It's like throwing the message at people and using it for quotes and using it to argue it but it's not becoming one with you. &gt;&gt; But the gods that he's talking about are gods that take the word and every bit of the word and they stand with it five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. They take the test of time and they stay with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is what we're coming to. God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; Going right back to Genesis to the original. What is it? Now the world and nature is groaning, crying, everything's moving. What? For the manifestation of the sons of God. When true sons, born sons, filled sons speak and their word is backed. &gt;&gt; I believe we're on the border of it right now. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Say to this mountain, let it be so. Brother, I desire so and so a certain thing done. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. There's a manifestation. Oh brother, my crops are burning up out yonder. I haven't had any rain. I'll send you rain in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless your crops. Oh, waiting, groaning, all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; God ordained it at the beginning. He gave man the domain. &gt;&gt; Now, do you believe that &gt;&gt; if this quote isn't for us, then who is it for? Amen. &gt;&gt; And if not now, then when? &gt;&gt; Who's going to manifest this? &gt;&gt; He's not talking about the millennium. This is before the rapture. &gt;&gt; This is a time of the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; 60 years it's been laying on the earth. 60 years. Somebody's been listening to them tapes. 60 years the church doors have been open. 60 years the tapes have been playing and available. &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to believe it. &gt;&gt; Why not that be you? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about an amateur guy. That's a different level. Now I'm not talking about a church member. Church members fight with other church members. They hold a grudge. They can't let it go. They're carnal. They procelite. They're interested in their own self. They're uh imu. They're they're jealous. They're mean. They're arrogant. All those spirits that all of us, if we'll be honest, we had it come on us, too. &gt;&gt; The works of the flesh are these. Galatians 5. My one pastor would say 17 tickets to hell. That's what he called them. 17 of them. Those are the works of the flesh. How many of y'all in the flesh today? If you came here, you're in the flesh. And these are the works of the flesh. And you got to keep your flesh under the working of the Holy Spirit because those things will come on you. But we're moving from that, aren't we? &gt;&gt; We're moving into amateur gods. &gt;&gt; Can I receive that? &gt;&gt; 60 years of it going. I can take the attitude. So, brother Israel, you know, the other pastor, this is the way they did it. You know, live a nice life after 30 years, 40 years, you get old, you, you know, just be okay. Just die and just roll on over. And Satan is just going rampant on every level. I don't know of an age. I mean, it's just on every level. Satan has not stopped. It looks like every family is well intact and everything is lovey lovey. But Satan is no joke. &gt;&gt; He is no joke. He's fighting right now. &gt;&gt; Working dissensions and trying to tear things up and problems. And then the emotional guy, he's all emotional. He's all, "Yeah, I can't believe they did that. And why would they say that? And how could they lie?" and I was just getting things together. Well, you that's an emotion. I'm talking I'm talking about a little G. I'm looking for a little G. I'm looking for a little G. A little God. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for a little amateur God. Where are they? Or maybe they're in the Baptist church. Are they? You think they're in the Baptist church? &gt;&gt; In the denominational church? Where they at? They're online somewhere. &gt;&gt; Where are they at? Somebody, please. Where are the sons and daughters of God at? &gt;&gt; Elisha asked this question when he got the mantle after the years of studying the 10 years of the robe fitting him and God trimming him and shaping him. Then finally his master leaves. He gets the mantle. He has the message. He's the elected one. He comes to the river. He says, "Where is the God of Elijah?" He strikes the water and the power of God comes down. &gt;&gt; I had a question I wanted to ask you as I close. How have you been taught? Are you the Jarius side of teaching or are you the Roman side? Are you rejoicing because of your position in the Lamb's Book of Life? Are you capable of demanding God to do what he promised you to do for you to do? &gt;&gt; Are you a little God? God help us. God bless us. I believe we are little to gods. I believe we're coming into that authority and we thank the Lord for it, don't we? Amen. God bless you. The musicians come and we'll pray. Lord, what a responsibility that's been laid upon the church. as Elijah, a type of the Old Testament, Elisha, a type of the New Testament church, the works that I do, and even greater works. That's the believer, Lord. That's the Gentile church. That's he that has the spoken word that you've called us to be like a centurion. who knows the authority. He knows who's got the power. He knows where power lies. He knows that he that you're the jurisdiction of it all. And you have given us that authority tonight. Lord, I pray you'll bless us as we move forward and really look at the hour that we're living in. I can't preach it loud enough. I can't scream it, Lord. It's on the books. It's in the tapes. It's in our Bible. Opened up. It's been opened up to us, Lord. An example. Father, I pray that you'll help us. In Jesus' name we pray. We ask it. Amen. can make it know that I can stand. Better words come my way. I present your I know that with Jesus I Oh yes I can. I know I can stand. No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hands.

Oh, no matter what may come our way, life is in your hand. You don't have to worry and you don't have to worry and don't you be afraid. Brother John comes in the morning [Music] pass away.

So when your test and trials, they seem to get you down. And all your friends and loved ones are nowhere to be found. Remember, there's a friend in Jesus who will wipe your tears away. And if your heart is broken, just lift your hands and say, "Oh, I know that I can make it. I know that I can stand. [Music] No matter what may come my way, my life is in your hand. With Jesus, I can make it. With him, I know I can stand. Oh no matter what may come my way. My life is in your hands. In moments like these I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus [Music] in moments like thee. I lift up my voice. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. Sing it in. I love you, Lord. Sing it. I love you, Lord. I I love Sing it to him one more time. Yes. In moments like I sing out a song. I sing out a love song to Jesus. In moments like these, I lift up my hands. I lift up my hands to you, Lord. singing.

[Music] Dear Lord, what a message tonight, Lord Jesus. We can only find who we are, Lord Jesus. Your church, Lord, your body, Lord, to carry out your works, Lord Jesus. Dear Lord, our brother Lazy and Brother Shawn, Lord, they're on the road traveling. Lord Jesus, may your presence be with them, Lord. Keep them safe, dear Lord Jesus. Dear Lord, just be with everyone here, Lord. Dear Lord, if we know who we are, Lord, [Music] the church of God, Lord, nothing can stand before us, Lord Jesus. The works that you did, Lord, should be flowing through us, Lord. That's a promise, Lord. We're waiting for that manifestation, Lord. Lord Jesus, we ask for your anointing, Lord, just to &gt;&gt; bring it on to us, Lord Jesus. We can manifest these works of your body, Lord Jesus. We're waiting for that, Lord Jesus. That third pull, Lord. Oh Lord, that anointing Lord, please Jesus, just bring that down among us, Lord Jesus, and bless this your body of Christ, Lord Jesus. Give us the faith, Lord. Give us the faith we need, Lord, to bring this about, Lord Jesus. Not for our honor, but for your honor and glory, Lord, for you, Lord, to bring out your works in this world for us to see and be part of, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord, for your word. We thank you for the preaching of your word, for the encouragement, Lord, that we have. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you're a great God. We love you so much, Lord. Just be with us. Strengthen us, Lord. encourage us, Lord Jesus. We ask this in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; We sang a song this morning, fill my cup, Lord. And one of the lines in there is, "Bread of heaven, feed me till I can eat no more." &gt;&gt; And I just, we all have different appetites, different levels that we get full. But I think today we can all say that we're content. It's been good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. What a wonderful day. So wonderful to be able to fight this fight with each and every one of you. And I'm just just love you all and just am thankful for the opportunity to serve him with each of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing that song as as you're dismissed. Who I am, Lord, who I am. What key do we do that in B flat? Let's see if I have that there. Sure enough. Oh, glorious victory. That day he set me free and made my heart his very throne. My life is no longer mine. I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live to praise his name. Oh I am Lord. Who I am.
