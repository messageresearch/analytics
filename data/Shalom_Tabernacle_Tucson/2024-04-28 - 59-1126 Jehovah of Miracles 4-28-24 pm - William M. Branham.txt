think it's Jehovah of the Miracles something like that yeah Jehovah of Miracles sorry there was two tapes I wanted to play and this one I haven't heard it before but trust it'll be a blessing to you 1959 brother brandham is um going to be starting at paragraph number 14 and the scripture there he'll give us the scripture reading in Luke chapter 1 I believe verse 36 so as we prepare to go there let's sing only believe are you glad to be here tonight I mean I believe God's going to speak to our hearts amen singing only be [Music] only believe that all things are possible if you only [Music]

hallelujah it's possible Lord I [Music] be and Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen I'm not sure if we have to remain standing let's just remain standing for the reading of the word amen God bless you brother brandom I want you tonight that reads with me in the scripture or keeps it Mark down I want you to turn with me to St Luke the first chapter and we're going to begin at the 36th verse and read a portion of the scripture you know I like to see you bring your Bibles to the church there's something about it that I just love to carry the word I was thinking of my colored brother sitting here that the pastor of that fine group of singers a colored brother down in the South one time they said he was carrying a Bible and he couldn't even read one word and they asked him said why are you carrying this Bible he said I'm carrying it because I believe it that's a good sign he said well then how do you know what it says he says I can hear the others read it and he said I believe every word in it from kber to ker he said I believe the ker also because it's got Holy Bible and wrote on it he said Do you believe all that's written in it he said I believe everything that's written in it and he said whatever the Lord would tell me to do I'd do it he said now MOS you know better than that said what if the Lord would tell you to jump through that stone wall would you jump he said yes sir I would said how you go to get through that stone wall M he said well if the Lord told me to jump you'd have a hole there when I got there so that's just about it if the Lord told him to jump he'd have the whole time he got there how true that is let's read now from the 36th verse of St Luke and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her which was called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible possible and Mary said behold the hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her it must have been a the son was just rising and was climbing up into the bright judian Skies as it was reflecting its glistens over the Galilee as the little Maid was making her way down the street she had a picture under her arm it must have been Monday just after the Sabbath and she was on her way to the public well to get water for her days Supply and she as we look at her tonight she's walking with her head down she was the more than a child about 18 years old and she seemed to be studying in a deep study she was engaged to a young man by the name of Joseph he was a carpenter and he was building at this time a little house that had to have a special attention because he and his lovely little wife Mary was to live in this house and it had to have every just special day by day she would come up while he was eating his lunch at noon hour and would talk to him and how they would look over the plans of the house and how the little doors was to be set in and it was to be a special house and from where Mary lived let's say it was just across the hillside through the holler and up over the hill and on Sunday after the services while they would set out on the front porch after they had eaten their dinner and would look across on the other Hill at the little bunch of Evergreens and the little Gables of the house sticking up they would plan their future of what they were going to do the Sunday before had been an unusual Sunday at the synagogue in Nazareth the good Rabbi had preached a mighty sermon and he had told of the great God of Abraham how that in the days of his visiting his children down in Egypt how did he had brought them out with the mighty hand of power how he had showed himself to be ruler of both heavens and earth how that water could not stand in his path or nothing could hinder his Divine will how that he had sprinkle with his own hands bread upon on the ground of a night to feed his journey in children that had no bread and it also referred to a time that they run out of [Music] meat and the lord god Jehovah had caused the Great wind to blow and quailes come into the camp by the thousands and each Israelite without using anything more than their hands and caught these quailes and dressed them and had eaten all that they wanted and it was at this point that Joseph must have said did you realize dear how many quails that it would take to feed them people for there were about two and one half million people in that camp and each man could easily eat two Quail or more for satisfying so it would take more than 5 million quailes but he's Jehovah the Creator how that he could create Quail there probably wasn't five million quail in all Palestine or all the Wilderness but he's Jehovah God who can put them there if there's none there he can still cre create them for he did it in the days of Abraham on the mount where AB called him Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide anything he has need of then Joseph must have said something like this the message was striking but I thought the good Rabbi ruined it at the end when he said well it is true that Jehovah used to do Miracles but alas Jehova doesn't even do Miracles today that those days have passed long ago all Jehovah wants us to do is to go to church and pay our dues and just live a good normal life Joseph might have said I kind of disagree with the rabbi because if he is God he has to remain the same God if he was Jehovah gy could provide for them he can provide for us also how I would like the holler Amen to Joseph Mary slips back into the house and picks up a scroll and brings it out as their usually Sunday afternoon's Bible study and it happened to be this day we' say that she brought out the scroll of Isaiah and as Joseph took the scroll and opened it up he began to read the scroll to Mary and the comment finally he comes to the place of Isaiah 996 where it says something like this unto us a child is given unto us a son and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father and while he was reading he heard a sigh and he looked sideways and the little lady sweetheart of his her little face said flashed up and her eyes were glittering like the stars on a dark night and said read that again dear and he read it again and she must have said oh who will that be what is the prophet speaking of and he said something like this or would have said the prophet was speaking speaking of the Messiah which will come and one of our women someday will bear the Messiah that scripture seemed to grip the little virgin she just couldn't get away from it that's what she was studying about perhaps on this morning where we find her going to the well to get water maybe I would say it was Monday it was wash day and she had to go get the wash waterer early her mother was old and as she was thinking on that scripture unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and his name shall be called The Counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father she becomes so interested in what she was saying or thinking until she almost forgot to turn the corner and as she raised her head there was something strange seems like a light flashed and she turns down towards the city Square where the virgent well stands yesterday and she must have thought oh the sun flick on some D that's left up on the side of the hill or it might have hit a piece of polished metal somewhere or armor from a Roman soldier that's perhaps what I saw flicker before my eyes so she goes on dreaming oh it's too bad that the church today doesn't walk in the spirit like that more than we do for It's that kind of a time that when God comes to you you know it was on the road to emus when theopus and his friend was speaking and talking and thinking about Jesus that he walked out of the bushes by the side of them and walked with them it's why we are thinking upon him the trouble with the world today we're thinking about everything else but him then we wonder why we don't get blessings we just a few weeks ago about three weeks ago when I sat down by some sycamore trees as I was telling you and begin to think it was there for the first time that he came and declared the new ministry to me think on him Draw N unto me and I'll draw n unto you sayith the Lord think upon Him David spoke that he was right his Commandments up on the bedst and meditate on them day and night that's what the church ought to do would keep your heart tuned in with God day and night where it stands when he appears Solomon said as a man thinketh his heart so is he begin to think that you're one of his children that he saved you and he's good to you and you love him and he loves you don't just wait till you go to church or some convenient hour just keep him on your mind all the time and as she went on walking down the street the there was no one yet on the street and as she walked along the little dirt path for a sidewalk all of a sudden she begin to realize that there was something around her a real strange feeling oh that's the most wonderful experience I trust that everybody here has experienced some kind of a times if you haven't this would be a good night to start just start thinking about him and worship him in your heart and all of a sudden you'll feel the close Fellowship of the holy spirit all around you and it gets so anointed to you can't hold it any longer you raise up your hands and or do something you just can't stand still when it comes as she was thinking not noticing who was around her the little lady perhaps with a pair of sandals on her feet walking along this little Dusty path but thinking of the Lord and of his promises of of things to come and as she was thinking all of a sudden that feeling got so great around her until she just raised up her head and when she did standing before her was a light and standing by that light was Gabriel the Angel the Archangel of God if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on God and all the things of the world go about your business go to your church go to your washing of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long thank you Lord then God will do something you're drawing close to him you got the world shut out just you and he are together this appearing of the Angel frightened the little virgin she had been taught that the days of Miracles was passed but she had seen something happen the angel told her said Hail Mary hail means to stop and he had a message for her when an angel comes he's got a message for you and the Holy Spirit God's angel is here tonight with a message for every believer just keep him on your mind keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises if you're sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed keep your mind centered like that something will happen to you all of a sudden there will be a Something Draw N to you an anointing will come on you out of that CH you'll go Draw N to the Lord and he'll Draw N unto you and she looked at this great Angel and his name is Gabriel now there is angels of the Lord many of them and they come to the Earth and bring messages but Gabriel when he comes there's something major going to happen he was the one who announced the first coming of Christ he will be the one that will announce the second coming of Christ and he told Mary thou Hast found favor with God what a message to bring to her thou Hast found favor with God and while she was thinking on that script then that was the scripture that was confirmed to her now if you're sick think on that scripture if you're lost think on that scripture if you want the Holy Spirit think on that scripture and the Holy Spirit will confirm it to you there she was and the angel said told her that she was going to have a son and they would call his name Jesus he' save the people from their sins and he said your cousin Elizabeth is an old woman and it's six months with her now as a mother who was called Baron now Mary and Elizabeth were first cousins our Lord and John the Baptist were second cousins Elizabeth's husband's name was Zachariah he was the just man a priest at the temple he was a good man and all his life that he had been married to Elizabeth he had prayed and held on to God that God would give him a baby but she was Barren and she'd got some 60 years old and Zachariah was weighing 70 and still they had no children so Zachariah went up to the feast to do his duty at the feast which was to burn incense while the people were praying in the congregation while he was in there burning incense he looked standing at the right hand of the Altar and there stood Gabriel the Archangel live right do right angels are still living God still hasn't at his command there stood Gabriel the archangel and told him what was going to happen after this days of his administration at the the temple he go home and his wife was going to conceive and bear a child they called his name John and we know the story now the angel Gabriel 6 months later had visited Mary and told her that her cousin was going to have a baby also so Mary knew that that would be a miracle of that old woman well stricken in age having a baby but she said to the angel how shall it be with me seeing that I do not know a man and ask then you shall receive he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that Holy thing which will be born of you shall be called The Son of God that's how it's going to happen Mary never talked back to the angel she never discusted it in any way the only thing she said was behold their hands made of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word did you think even the priest zachari had questioned him being an old man and her old to how this would be done and a preach who should know the word and know what God did but this little virgin was just a child and she had no husband she had to believe the impossi something that had never happened before but she never argued she never questioned anymore his word was enough for her oh if the church could just get like that the word settles it if God said so that's all we need to know how it's going to be I can't tell you but if God said so it's going to be that way because God said so oh that's what I want the church to know if there's anything I want you to sink faith in is in what God has said it has to be true did you notice she had to believe The Impossibles she could not go back like U Zachariah could he could have went back to Sarah and Sarah was almost aund when she had the baby and Hannah at the temple she was old woman too and they had plenty examples of that where they had husbands but Mary had to believe something that never had happened you've got thousands of examples of Divine Healing look at the people's been healed with cancer blindness dumbness deafness all kinds of sicknesses and diseases we've got plenty of that to look at as example but this little girl didn't have nothing but just his word and that was sufficient praise the Lord his word was good enough for her and I want you to notice she didn't wait till she was positive it was going to happen she started testifying about it right away she didn't wait till she felt life so she could be positive she's going to have the baby just as soon as she heard his word she tuck him at his word and she started testifying and praising God for the baby before she felt anything that give us more marries around here that can take God at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not take him at his word God's trying to find somebody who will take his word I don't care how you feel someone say well I don't feel any better I was went to the meetings I was prayed for I that don't have nothing to do with it God said so and that settles it amen somebody will take his word that's what pleases him believe his word that's what pleases God that's the only way you'll ever find favor with him is believe his word and Mary tuck him at his word she said that's sufficient for me and she went around telling everybody she's going to have this baby before she had one sign of it at all one sign of anything she still she knew that it was going to happen because God said so don't you see the true seat of Abraham God speaks say believe it that's the reason I like the church today that can take God's word When God says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the church says amen Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also the church says amen Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe my they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpents drink deadly things they hands on the sick they shall recover the church says amen they don't worry about it wonder how it's going to happen to just take him at his word and move on that's the true Seed of Abraham that's the children of God Mary had to believe for The Impossibles but God takes The Impossibles and makes them real when his he's tuck at his word the doctor might might have said you'll never get rid of that cancer the doctor might have said you'll never be able to walk again well well it's impossible for you to do it but Impossibles Fade Out when God's tuck at his word no matter what the doctor says he's doing the best he can but God is God Amen and his word is just like his you take his word that settles it forever if thou can't believe say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but we'll believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what You' said God took at his word oh she started right away giving praise to God and telling the people that she was going to have a baby knowing no man I remember she had throw herself in liability liable for criticism but Mary didn't stop to think about criticism she didn't care about criticism Hallelujah when a man comes to get the Holy Ghost you don't care what the neighbors is going to say you don't care if you shout you speak with tongues or whatever you do it's a pass that you took God at his word you don't care for criticism you've lost all your devil made homemade intellectual society called Prestige the thing that you want is favor with God you don't care what the Holy Spirit causes you to do the Shout Scream or cry or ball or anything you want to do anything the Holy Spirit putts on you you do it because you don't care you've lost all that man-made stuff you're free in Christ Jesus the spirit of God has set you free and you're free in the power of God bathing in his beauy worshiping him in the spirit and truth you're a free person you tuck the word of God it tuck a hold in your heart you don't care you're throw yourself you say well if I I'll be standing on my job someday and the boss said say I heard you that a holy roll meat and got healed I'm prayed no you're not brother if you're the Seed of Abraham you've counted a joy to stand and testify of the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ certainly you do my people shall not be ashamed if you're ashamed of me before man I'll be ashamed of you before my father and the Holy Angel said the Lord Jesus so they're not ashamed they're not afraid so after Mary hearing the good news about Elizabeth oh she wanted to share the news you know there's something about this that when you really take God at his promise and see fulfill it you want to tell somebody else about it you just can't sit still you got to do something about it so she took off that little woman by herself up along the river over the up the hills into Judea into the Mountain Country Now Elizabeth as soon as she found out that she was going to be a mother she had hid herself went back into the room and I'd imagine let's just think she's sitting back there and making little booties and getting all her little work ready for this little fellow was to come and she's making the little blanket that she's going to have him dedicated in and all these things getting things ready because she's going to be mothered but the thing was wearing her it was six months with her as a mother and the baby had not yet moved now anyone knows that that's subnormal way out of way about two or three months or more maybe four the most there's life but there's no life yet but she was sitting back in a little room let's just look now get us a little seat along the side of the road and watch here comes a little virgin up the road her little eyes are sparkling her cheeks just as rosy as they could be not with Max factors no no but lit up with the power of God and the joy of God just as hard as she could run her little eyes are glistening you know and she I see Elizabeth raise back the curtain and look out and she sees a young lady coming up the judian hills as it got closer she recognized it to be her cousin Mary so she wraps a little shawl around her and out she goes to meet her oh she must have throwed her arms around her and hugged her and kissed her you know people used to be they cared for one another you know but nowadays they don't they don't care for each other people so cold so far away from one another it used to be when one of the neighbors that get sick we'd all go in sit down help them and cut their wood cut their Carn or help them plow or whatever was going on and help them but today you don't even know your neighbor's dead unless you read it in the paper it's so cold so indiffer honey I don't mean this to be bad to my wife sitting there but the other day some time ago it's been we were downtown together and it just seems to be a Trend and there was a a lady on the street and she said how do you do sister Brandon and I never heard her say a word and I said honey that lady spoke to you she said I spoke to her and I said I didn't hear you she said I smile oh I said honey a little old silly gin don't take the place of a good how do you do I I I like that to be friendly but a little old silly green I like for somebody to speak not give a little grin like a possum I I like for it to be a real howdy do I like a good old pump handle handshake not long ago I was in Florida and there was a some woman called a duchess or something that had let them have some ground where put the tent up that night brother Bosworth said The Duchess I thought now who am I going to meet now said she's back there wants to see you I said there's plenty of sick people out here too that wants to see me and he said well as you go out just shake her hand

you you see I I wish they'd all come at one night one time is anybody here that's never been in one of my meetings before let's see your hands well look at that we're so happy you're here I I may have to go through this just a little bit I purposed in my heart to do something else tonight I purposed in my heart just to bring that prayer line right straight through and pray for them that's what I was thinking of doing that's reason I call that line I might have to explain this to some of the people the newcomers after you just a minute you see we believe we're living in the last days we believe that Jesus Christ promised when he's on Earth he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also he said a little while and the world won't see me no more yet you'll see me for I will be with you even in you to the end of the world now if we can find out what Jesus was a long time ago the works that he did then we can find out the works that he do now is that right newcomers now let's just take just a moment and find out the works that he did let's just think did he call himself a Healer no did he claim to heal no he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me is that right and when he passed through the the pool by the pool of Bethesda are the Greek multitudes of people lame Hal blind withered waiting for the moving of the water and Jesus no there's one man laying there he he wasn't blind he could walk but he had some kind of a trouble maybe it's prostrate trouble or or two bir is it had it for many 38 years I believe it was not going to kill him he's laying on a padet and he said will thou be made whole and he said sir I have no one to put me into water I remember Jesus said he knew the man had been this way a long time now he knew it now he healed him and walked away and let that multitude laying there is that right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and did that he did then he was questioned and what did he say now that's St John 5:19 now listen at his words verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise let's go back and see if that's true after he was anointed of God filled with the Holy Ghost because the Messiah was the anointed one is that right Brethren the the anointed one he was a man when it comes to man he was born eat drink had Flesh and Blood like we have but his blood was not he wasn't a Jew neither was he a gentile he was God see the blood comes from the male sect how many knows that he wasn't his mother's blood she was Jewish and then who was his father who was his father God then God doesn't have blood because God is a spirit but he created a virgin blood cell into the WS of Mary without sexual desire it brought forth the son Christ Jesus through that blood I'm Sanctified through that blood a sinner is made clean through that blood is what I have faith for this healing here through that blood changes my life that's the blood when he was 30 years old the Holy Spirit came up on him like a dove and he started his first Ministry let's see what he did the works that I do the the first thing he did we find out there was a fellow Andrew went and found Peter his name was Simon then and brought him to Jesus and Jesus said to him your name is Simon and your father's name is Jonas Thou Art the son of Jonas is that right the first thing he did now do you believe that Simon he he was a Pharisee the Church of the Pharisees we're taught by The Chronicles of the Bible that he was a Pharisee therefore he had been taught that there would be a prophet raised up and Moses said there will be a prophet raised up how many knows that the Messiah was to be a prophet the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me said Moses is to be a god prophet and as soon as he found out that he knew who he was he recognized him then away went a fellow named Phillip went over another country 15 miles around the mountains and found a fellow by name of Nathaniel his friend under a tree praying he said come see who we found Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph he said now could there be any good thing come out of Nazar I think he give you the best answer any man could give said come and see just don't sit there and criticize come find out for yourself and I can imagine going around the hill they said say you know that old Fishman you bought that uh them fish from that time and he couldn't even sign that receip couldn't sign his name or nothing yes or Simon you're talking about the the fisherman the big fisherman yes he come up before this one we know to be the Messiah and he told him what his name was and told him his father's name one said Nathaniel you've gone off the deep end but as soon as he walked up before a congregation something like this Jesus was perhaps ministering to the sick he looked around he seen him coming and he said behold an Israelite in whom there's no gu why tuck him right off his feet how did he know he was an Israelite not the way he dressed because all the easterners dressed alike turban Ro he said an Israelite in whom there's no God in other words a a godess man a Christian a real believer we'd call him he said Rabbi means teacher when did you ever know me well this is our first time ever meeting when did you know me he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you what eyes 15 miles around the mountain I saw you before you come to the meeting under that tree he said by Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus said because I told you that you believe you'll see greater than this then of course there was those standing there who said now that man they couldn't deny it wasn't going on but they said he's be elub how many knows that be elub is a fortune teller a devil he's doing that through the power of the devil and Jesus said I forgive you for that but someday the Holy Ghost is coming to do the same thing that I do and one word against it will never be forgiven in this world or the world to come because they call the spirit of God an unclean thing the scripture says that now we find out that many of things he went up to Samaria that's another Nation another race of people like ham sham and Jac's people now he got to the Samaritan which is half Jew and Gentile and a woman was at the well and he talked to her a few minutes he said bring me a drink she said well it's deep it's not customary for you to uh to call to a Jew to a Jew as this American for something like that so we have no dealings with each other and as it went on the conversation went on finally he said go get your husband and she went to get she said well I have no husband and um is someone sick back there all right set her right down set her down now is that a minister with his hands on her lay your hands over owner Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ the son of God take the evil sickness off of that sister may the power of God heal her body we cast It Away by faith in Jesus name amen all right don't doubt be all right amen and so when the woman come and she said I have he said go get your husband she Saidi have no husband said that's true you've got five and the one you're living with not your husband what did she say sir I now listen to this now sir I perceive that you are a prophet how many knows that I perceive that if you run that reference it means that Prophet that was to come I perceive that you are the prophet she said we know when the Messiah cometh he'll tell us these things is that right well that was the sign of the Messiah and he Saidi he that speaks to you that same Messiah sign would be the same today as it was then is that right it have to be if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever The Works that I do shall you also now if the woman needs some air she's sick or kind of fainty all right you can take her get air all right if she wants to but she don't just have faith she'll be all right now give your attention this way I was going to run this l through just go right straight through and pray for you how many of says if I do that you believe you get well raise your hands go these signs shall follow and if you lay hands on how many in this building is strangers me and I don't know nothing about raise your hands all around I don't know nothing about all right if Jesus Christ is the same yest today and forever here I'm a stranger to you all right to the new audience just this one or somewhere somebody needs some help along the line with st I don't know this man I've never seen him don't know a bit more what he's standing here far and nothing God knows now if Jesus has risen from the dead and I've told the truth about him then if he has risen and this is the last sign that he promised just like he said as it was in the days of Sodom and that's exactly what God did in the days of Sodom how many's been here this week to understand that that's exactly the sign God gave to Sodom and Jesus said it would repeat again just before his coming how many knows the Bible says that and the angel with his back turned and said Abraham where is your wife Sarah how do you know who he was said she's in the tent he told what is going to happen to her and she laughed in the tent and he said why did she laugh see he said that'll happen again before the end time I do not know the man never seen but here's here's a case like when our Lord and Simon met together that's right way all right we being strangers now the man could be an Infidel he could be a hypocrite he could be a Christian he could be sick he could be needy I I don't know you need finances I don't know what he wants he's just standing there a man but to you newcomers and the man here's my hand I've never seen him in my life knowingly he raised his hand and I didn't know him or he didn't know me isn't that right sir that's right raise your hand so the people see it all right here's two men now if Jesus Christ is raised from the dead now if a man's sick and need needs healing I couldn't do that because any Redemptive blessing that Jesus died for is already paid for now if Christ is your old he could speak to you and tell you something about yourself is that right it's a nervous condition you're really extremely nervous and besides
