That's our prayer tonight. Lord, we love you and we thank you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You know, every time we [music] come to the the house of the Lord, you just don't know what kind of anointing will be there. Sometimes it's more, you know, loud and sometimes it's real sweet and quiet, but we every time he comes, it's just so nice [music] and we look forward to whatever he has for us. Amen. So, we like to welcome each of you. The the Murray's are here. God bless them. And of course, Ding Walls are still with us. And sister um Minnow's wife, Sister Irene, God bless you. And we have our good friend and special guest, Brother Minnow Freezen from Saskatoon um way up north in Canada there. And uh how many has heard Brother Minnow speak before? How many's never heard him be your first? Okay, wonderful. You're in for a real treat. Solid. solid. He was pastoring for overif over 50 years. 40 &gt;&gt; 40 &gt;&gt; 40. And so he's seen a lot and I just so much that you can just pull from him. And so he said, "What you want me to take 30 minutes?" I said, "Oh, no. Don't play with me like that." you know, [laughter] and so we told him no, just open his heart and pray that the Lord will uh bless us with his word. And so as he comes, let's sing Amazing Grace and let's make them feel welcome. Amazing [music] [singing] grace, how sweet the sound that save. [singing] [music] [music and singing] [music] I was. [music] It was [music and singing] grace that I brought my [music] heart to you and I [music] He live [music] that grace [music] [music] and through [singing] man [music] he gave church [music] and his name I have already [music and singing] [music] [singing] [music] and we're Praise will be [music] home.

Let's just pray one more time. Father, we thank you tonight. We welcome you to this service and to the pulpit [music] and to our hearts. Lord, search our hearts and if you should find unbelief, any wickedness, Lord, take it away. We've come to worship you in spirit and in truth and your word is truth. We believe that we're living in the golden age as we [music] heard the other night. This is the most glorious age of all that the prophets preached and longed for to see the closing of the book of redemption &gt;&gt; and to see a new dimension, a kingdom without end. Here we have no continuing city, but we are still seeking for that city which we know now is coming in plain view. Thank you for your goodness, our Lord, tonight. Would you bless us as we fellowship around your word? We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Thank you. God bless you. You could be seated. And uh [clears throat] it's good to be here tonight. I uh I always feel like I think all preachers do. Um you say yes too quick. Then you wonder what was I what did I do that? I want I come here to hear him. And uh I was uh glad to be here though in coming and seeing the final arrangement that you're done with the building. And it's nice. We were here when they, you know, I said last Sunday there was dust everywhere and fellas up in the ladder and in the ladder and in the door was in the holes everywhere. It was they was working and uh and kind of nice when we came back and seen it all transformed. &gt;&gt; Kind of nice kind of like a good conversion, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; you know, to know where to start sometimes, but just stay around the shepherd, the master builder. He knows how to build and after a while it's starting to take on a structure &gt;&gt; and then it begins to be comfortable. Then it begins to be a place to indwell and now that we thank now that's what buildings are for us. We're not looking at the building. We thank the Lord for those but volcanic ash &gt;&gt; as the prophet said anything you look at it's volcanic ash waiting to turn back to its original state again where there'll be no sin there'll be no tomorrow. let me know yesterday and we labor for that. That's what we press for and I'm I'm glad here to join by faith with you as is always our hope that um it we don't plan to change the whole church just maybe add a little bit here or maybe take away a little bit there rightly dividing the word of truth &gt;&gt; and after all that's a whole effort that we might rightly divide this blessed message which we believe is the last sounding message of redemption to the gentile dispensation &gt;&gt; and to the world, both Jews and Gentiles, gets a opportunity now to close up the finality of what God called the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; I'm glad my name was written there. &gt;&gt; I feel like John, I said, I'm so glad when you saw it that his name was written there. That means that you never had a beginning, [clears throat] no end to it. You're here for temporary. Excuse me. It'll clear off after a while. And good to see you, John. Good to see you. Chissy, it's good to see you. And you brought mom along today. Well, her and Irene had three-hour coffee break this morning or something like that. And they were budding in who's to take the lead. You ought to see them when they get together. They they've got so many grandchildren to talk about. It's amazing. And after all, they are our greatest joy. You know, when you see the grandchild, I was talking telling brother Israel here that I I saw him here the other night and with his wife playing the piano and the children sitting playing and I said, you know, there's a rich man sitting there. If we go in with your family, you're a rich person. &gt;&gt; You know, everyone has one objective as a parent. When we when when the Lord delivers us from unbelief and sin, then all your life you aim from that time on to see that you in influence those around you and above all your own family, which is the hardest thing for one human to lead another human to the Lord because there's always so much humanity there. Can you imagine? We always say, "Oh, if I would just be where Jesus was, everything would be fine." many mighty works she could not do because of unbelief. Could you believe that? That God could not do things with the people, but if they believed or not, he could do nothing for them. And the only the only sin that brother Brown says that God cannot help is unbelief. &gt;&gt; If you do not believe him, there's nothing he can do for you. With all the power reserved, he said, "Well, I don't believe that. I don't then it would do you no good." And a pardon is not a pardon. It's received as a pardon. &gt;&gt; And this message is the same way. It's a pardon of God. It is not another message. It's this living Bible. It's this Bible living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't believe the message is separate from the Bible. It is the revelation of the word of God. It is not added to it or taking away. It is a confirmation of what he prophesied, what he said and would do in the last day. And we can say this honestly from the heart and from the word of God and by vindication that all that God promised the angel to do, he did. &gt;&gt; I don't believe it was I believe it was finished when he took him off the earth. Uh he simply said there's a now the work wasn't finished. The pillar of fire still here because there's a bride still here yet. He said when it goes, she goes and I do believe we're so close. Of course, we've been that for the last 60 years. I believe that when brother Ram was still here when I heard him preach in marriage and divorce series I I we I thought I wouldn't get home [clears throat] seemed like the rapture was so near and how many of you were here around in 1977 were you around walking in the light boy everybody had one foot in the air you know hardly settled down to said it's going to happen it's going to happen [clears throat] it didn't happen like we thought &gt;&gt; but I didn't see any place in the message where to change it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He just had to change our thinking to his word. And it takes line upon line here a little, there a little. You notice how you read and how you listen sometimes all of a sudden you say, "Oh, I didn't see that before." Why? It's in the same place where I've read over so many times &gt;&gt; and a message. But in that day and their eyes came open and I thank the Lord. And one of the greatest things of all things is to have your your eyes open to the reality of the age that we live in. I was just making you don't mind if I just uh well I just calm myself down a little bit. I was I was looking at some pictures where in the place we're staying and [clears throat] there was um a picture of brother Carl Williams and his son Earl and I don't know the other brother had he had another son, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Anybody know? &gt;&gt; David. All right. I said it must be the other son. I don't know if I ever met him, but [clears throat] uh and it been in 1970, we were in Phoenix and brother Perry Green had invited the believers to come and sing and he was going to take the meetings there in the Ramada in and it was in 19 64 when brother Bam had the special meetings there in the Ramada that my my mother and dad went. My mother had heart trouble and she she said if in she said within her heart if I could get in the prayer line I believe the Lord would heal me. Her mother died at 54 years old and so she was always troubled that maybe she would be an early death and uh when she when she got there she got on the prayer line [clears throat] and walked through the prayer line. When she came up to brother Brandham he simply says heart trouble kills people but it doesn't have to kill you. She lived to be 90 years old. And when she did, the doctor said, uh, we about three, four days, she just laid there, wouldn't open her eyes and take any food, nothing. I said, doctor, what's the matter? I said, her heart's too strong. It won't quit. Well, I did. I wasn't happy, but I said, I'm glad. No one likes to see your loved ones go. You like to hang on to them as long as possible. But when we were there in the in the uh [clears throat] Ramada and brother Carl Williams was there and uh he invited us to his home afterwards and um of course we felt greatly honored because of his we'd heard brother Bam talk about him and he'd give us his testimony and I I I was thinking of when I looked at the the picture you know him being a well digger and u he said uh and if you ever anybody ever see his hands how they were all crippled some of you old people and u he said when brother Brown preached the MI in meetings he told the congregation [clears throat] I guarantee absolutely that there won't be one sick person one crippled one if you'll believe right now before you walk out of this building you'll receive what you have before you get through that building you God will God will you will receive it if you can believe it &gt;&gt; and brother Carl said he went out to the door looked at us hands like this, looking at his hands. When he went out of the door and he looked at his hands, stopped a little bit, they didn't change. He started walking. He said, "I started crying and I walked towards my car gradually, slowly crying because my hands were not changing." He said, "Lord, I guess I I guess I didn't have faith enough." He said, "When I got to the door of my car, I stood there for a minute looking at my hands and I felt somebody put his hand on my shoulder." He said, "It was Brother Brandon." He said, 'Brother Carl, what's the matter? He said, 'Look at these.' He said, ' Carl, God knows best. He said, he knows what you would do. He said, do you remember Paul when he cried the Lord for his eyes? And Paul and the Lord said to Paul, "My grace is sufficient. In fact, I'm made perfect in the weakness." &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Don't ask me again, for my grace is sufficient." He said, "And brother Bram said,"Brother Carl, God knows best. You probably would have went back to well drilling, but he said, "He's got you there to keep the doors open under the full gospel businessman for my ministry." He said, "That's the reason why God didn't touch you. He touched you." Said, "Don't ask him again." He said, "I never asked him again." He was that way when we when last we saw him. It just reminded me of the never failing reality of God. God is a great God. But [clears throat] he doesn't always he does not always do what we think he should be doing. &gt;&gt; There are many things that we might ask and might not get. But but I I tell you what, [clears throat] if you weigh it out, the Bible does say that all things do work together. doesn't say that they're they're always right. &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] I like the scripture who said, "But I know you're poverty." &gt;&gt; God is not not mocked. I like a little scripture. I mean, I want to take a little quote and I just picked this up in the same house and I I'd read it many times, but I appreciate some of the things that the prophet said that gives us so much strength along the way. And if I encouraged you along the way, that'd be good for me cuz uh I'm 83 years old and I'd like to be encouraged every day myself &gt;&gt; that I might still live when the rapture takes place. I'd kind of like to bypass death. To be honest, &gt;&gt; I I think there's every one of you, no matter how old you are, you say, "Oh, if I could just wait to see my body take on different all look and said, honey." Like Abram and Sarah said, "Your skin's getting all why your hair is turning." And I like this part here. He said, "You know, cloudy skies and storms of life are no sign of God's disapproval." Usually we think when things go wrong, something wrong. Doesn't have to be. Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. &gt;&gt; His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. &gt;&gt; His love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? Ah yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so. &gt;&gt; And I like to settle that in your heart. Take God at his word because he said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know you do. We shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us. For he brought us to himself and gave us his spirit placing us as sons. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's a richest people here tonight. The sons and the daughters of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And how shall we prove my love to him? By believing that what he said and by conducting myself with joy in the midst of trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass. And I know thy poverty, but thou art rich. There it is again. See him walking up and down in the midst of the church like a father. He is looking upon his family and he is head of the household. He is the provider. He is the protector. Yet he looks on his own poverty, their own poverty. Oh, how the untutored believer stumbles at this. &gt;&gt; How can God bear to look at upon his own in a time of need and just stop it all and just not stop it all and just give in and lavish everything material upon them? Here's where you have to believe again in his love. &gt;&gt; We could go on. I don't want to read spend all time on that's not my thought. But I I was encouraged when I read that today. I thought, "Oh, thank you, Lord. [clears throat] How marvelous, how wonderful." I want to read a scripture if I could first Corinthians and uh the first chapter. And I know that that all scripture is given for reproof, rebuke, exhortation, and there's nothing written but what is for the edification of the body. I did appreciate that, brother, brother Israel, when you're preaching on the gifts in the body. They are given there for the edification, for the uplifting and building up. and everything we do in in the in the Christian walk. That ought to always be our motive, Lord, to build up one another in the most holy faith. If you would stand with me, I'd like to read 1 Corinthians 1 and 18-31 just for [cough] if I [clears throat] miss it, this won't miss it. Pardon me. [clears throat] For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness. But unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of the word of the world? Disputers of this world. Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. Do you ever stop to really think why are we the the smartest of all and we need constant encouragement constant preaching conscient for and an animal he's happy with the way he's born never tries to alter never likes to improve he's just happy the way he is every feather is the same as the other feather was last year and the same thing and the same and they and they're happy &gt;&gt; but we need somebody constant just press on keep moving on Right? And we're in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are we are one who can choose. The animal cannot choose. But it shows that we're fallen people. &gt;&gt; We're longing to get back to the place. &gt;&gt; No matter how much you're saved here today, yet your body cries out, "I too want to be delivered." Your soul already rejoices, but your body we we must we want to get back to the place where God made us in the beginning before the fall. It'll never go away. That's the reason why we're always improving. You know what? You get 10 years. This Billy said, "You know what? &gt;&gt; We got to change something." &gt;&gt; Isn't that the way with your house? [clears throat] Never. Oh, if we if we renovate again, I'll change that. Let me read a little further. But after the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified. Unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness. But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God, because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. For you see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh. Not many mighty, not many noble are called. &gt;&gt; But God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise. And God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty. And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen. Yay. And things which are not, to bring to not things that are, the invisible correcting the visible. Now no flesh flesh should [clears throat] glory in his presence, but of him are of him are ye in Christ Jesus. Who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written, he that glorithth, let him glory in the Lord. May God bless his reading of his word. Your you may be seated. I'd like to add one scripture to that if I could and just uh trail along in this thought a little bit. There's [clears throat] something every once in a while, Brother Brand will say things and you'll you go into the scripture and they strike you as I as I often say that every time I get a little bit maybe melancholing, I think, well, I I'm not doing so good. I I like to turn to Romans 8. There's therefore now no condemnation of them which are in Christ Jesus. What I feel like you know you feel like brother B said if I get if I want to really get settled he said I get over there and uh thank you. [clears throat] Uh it's partly heritage 83 years of singing and talking too loud and and uh preachers have bad throat. I I heard brother Ram said the other day he kind of laughed. He said uh somebody [clears throat] somebody said uh about his hor his throat was real bad and he said uh uh somebody said something that I I think it was because of preaching he said and he kind of chuckled and said made me feel good that you should suffer a little bit. We do suffer because it's not easy just uh especially if you like to sing. You should sing on note if you're going to sing at all but but it doesn't always work. And [clears throat] but John said this here just changing our thoughts a little here. He that heareth my word I love to quote this same John 5:24. He that heareth my word and believeth on him that hath sent me hath everlasting eternal life. Zoe and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life &gt;&gt; or he that believeth. I like what brother Ram said now when he's praying for the sick now said if you He's getting ready to pray for the sick and he said now you people here if you'll you realize that that the scripture he went to the dialogue and he read where it says and if you believe with all your heart what you prayed for that it is coming to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not it will come to pass but that it is coming to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "You must believe it that way that the moment you ask, it is coming to pass. &gt;&gt; You might not see a stone move. You might not see anything happen, but it's already working because he knows before you want to ask if it's according to his word." And and in there little the message of questions and answers, uh, pardon me, discernment of the body. There's something that really uh blessed my heart and I I always strive to look at that said our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear. Our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see and what we hear but it's determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear. I' just let that sink in a little bit because faith comes by hearing the word and and that's where we rest at when we hear it. But unless the revelator reveals it to you &gt;&gt; for the entire body of Jesus Christ is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally. You know that's the new birth &gt;&gt; is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally. That you are in the book of life, lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. That you've always been a part of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we don't believe in eternal sunship. &gt;&gt; It's a temporary body we have here. But this body has a beginning has an end. &gt;&gt; But the one that it replaces when it not replaces but what changes it that he didn't say bodies replace it. Said when you come no matter what you went into the ground what nothing but nothing spoonful of ashes. Said when you come back it'll be a body immortal &gt;&gt; just like your soul is now. And in but in this it just it just blessed me when I read that that our eternal destination is not all together determined by what we see or what we hear but is determined on what discernment we have of what we see and what we hear. We [clears throat] are understanding that many times the things that we that we so desire to cannot be explained. &gt;&gt; And uh sometimes I I have a little sense of humor. We were going to Ohio, Irene and I. And I love driving, but I'm getting older. The roads are getting longer. I know that. But uh I don't like flying cuz uh with my my rather oversized body, the seats are just a little bit too narrow usually. Now, if they had them like that, it'd be nice. But but they're making the plane smaller rather than bigger. I can see that. But we were driving one day and I said, "How do you know I I like to my wife likes to she she was sleeping a little bit, but I so I talked to her because I was sleepy, too." And I said, "You know, let's talk a little bit." So So I said, "You know, we're strange people." I said, "Just think now. We've been driving three solid days. and we go to sleep at night and driving street going going east going east. I said, "How come we don't get to the edge where a car starts leaning this way and or I go over the edge or how come we're always up?" Yeah, you know, you I'm I'm joking. But how would I explain that now? How's it How's it that the people beneath us now way down there, you know, we say, "How can the Chinese are sleeping today now and uh they're all hanging upside down? Can you explain things? I can't explain it. How's this coming? No matter where you go, you're always up. I saw something the other day. He said, "Well, going left or right?" He said, "Go left." He said, "Because the women are always right." I saw that in your Walmart store. But I find out doesn't matter. You're still going the same way. But but try to explain, you know, the dynamics, you know, we we can sometimes explain the mechanics. But you know what? How do you explain the mechanics of the Holy Ghost coming into your life and saving a ranked sinner? Why were you a sinner to begin with? Because he ordained it that way. &gt;&gt; That he might be a savior, that he might be a deliverer, that he might be a a leader, a guide, a shepherd, as we just read, or I am the the the God of the household. And he allows things all of this so [clears throat] it can be expressed. &gt;&gt; But how could you how could you can explain the solar system? &gt;&gt; How do you explain it? You can do anything you want, but you can't make one thing make sense except God created it. &gt;&gt; How do you explain anything? How do you explain emotions and feelings and and uh somebody sits down and plays a song and says, "Oh, that's beautiful." Uh well, yeah. Next one. Oh, isn't that wonderful? It depends on what notes it strikes in your heart. &gt;&gt; A song sometimes make you cry, the next time it makes you laugh, next time you want to dance, next time you want to run or just, oh, look at that. Look at the emotions. How do you explain that? &gt;&gt; How do we explain God? I know we men especially in this age know everybody wants to know exactly we after all we have Google so we can we can find how it's made and where it's made and how you know where we got all the answers &gt;&gt; but faith doesn't need all the answers &gt;&gt; it just needs to believe &gt;&gt; just take God at his word you know and the the solar system itself it's impossible well the further they're going now with scopes and and they're going on and on and on. They said they're waking up. Said it's unbelievable. Said there's new galaxies arriving everywhere. Who do how do we explain it? That's what brother Brandham talked about. He said the mechanics and the dynamics. We we we we don't know sometimes the mechanics, but we know it when the dynamics hits us. I don't know how a man can find peace with God, but I know what it struck me. &gt;&gt; I began to rejoice. I began to realize my sins were gone. There was something happened to me. I said, "Oh." I said, "I know this. I I might not be, you know, what I want to be or what I ought to be, but this thing I do know I'm not what I used to be." Something began to change. And I begin to realize it took away the desire of sin to disbelieve the word of God. Took away the things of the Lord. Begin to make you look at something say, "Oh, Kabot. Oh, look at it." What once it was attracted, you find out that that what sin that what the Holy Ghost does when he comes in, he takes and changes it. that you say, "Oh, you shouldn't go there." No, should do. I know where to go. And when I get out of place, I also know that. &gt;&gt; You ever been in a place where you say, "What am I doing here?" &gt;&gt; Might have be might be the mall. Might be somewhere else. All of a sudden, I I I we we were we don't shop that much, but a little bit. And uh I was walking into the store one time looking for my wife. And I knew it was a lady's clothing store. But I walked in and I was in about quarters away. That's how I start feeling. So I got all nervous like I uptight and I and the music I said, "Man, there must be something horrible in that music. I don't know its lyrics. I don't know what it's playing." Said, "But that this makes me so nervous." I looked a little while. I said, "Well, she'll have to come out uh eventually, so I'll just stay out." But it's spirits. &gt;&gt; You don't understand the the mechanics of it, &gt;&gt; but you know the dynamics of it. And it's the same with the walking with this message. Look, I I can't explain a lot of things that the prophet said sometimes and and even in the scripture. Could everybody say here that if you read your Bible, you see Jesus Christ in every verse that you read? &gt;&gt; No. No, I can't. But I do know this that the prophet said all the Old Testament was a shadow and it was Jesus, the figure of Jesus that was cast into the shadow. And finally when it come up he said the shadow merged into the image itself and the old and the new it met in the middle &gt;&gt; and then the new be to reflect what all those prophets had said and done was reflected there stood the image of the ones that they' prophesied. Look at beyond the curtain of time. Brother Bam goes over there and he said when all those prophets they cried and they begin to identify the image they saw in their day &gt;&gt; and begin to cry out and said oh there's a wheel in the middle of the wheel remember you know the prophet talked about and how he goes into lets us know that that he appeared in different forms different mechanics &gt;&gt; but the dynamics was the same that's the reason why you never have to change the word of God if there's anything in the you come to the Bible and here comes a prophet in this day And he's even saying things at times. Now hear me right. Why those seven thunders or seven seals are not even written in the book. Well, I'm saying amen. Amen. That's they must be there somewhere. He gets to about the third seal and says I was wrong. said they were written there because it says at the last chapter there said if you add or take away one verse or add one to place said they were there all the time but our eyes were withheld &gt;&gt; with the mechanics were there but the dynamics had not reached us yet to quicken that work and make it alive but look at when the prophet come along and took the scriptures and went to the old testament took Abraham Jeremiah all the prophets and brought him their portion and brought them into Jesus Christ and so on there stood that's the one they were all looking for Amen. &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever, the unchanging. I know this is this is simple but &gt;&gt; even in the fallen creatures [clears throat] he said this even the fallen creatures if it's all wrapped up in time he said this the botney life solar life the lowest the highest the creature of a man even to the earth fully obeys its creator tour. And it's interesting, you know, here we are with all of that. The whole creation, you say, "Oh, the devil's been giving me so much trouble. The devil's doing this. The devil's doing that." He's only doing what God allows him to do. Do you know he's got a limit? &gt;&gt; Said, "Touch not my anointed. Do my prophets no harm." Oh, you killed the prophet's own. That doesn't mean it touch not my anointed. Don't ever touch that anointing of that redeemed soul. The oil in the wine, don't touch it. &gt;&gt; It doesn't belong. That's not yours. &gt;&gt; Satan's got a limit. Do you know how many times uh somebody was telling me the other day and I thought, no, in fact, I heard this heard brother Bam the message really struck me. You've heard brother Bam talk about the woman that was a saint way back in 1950. He said this in 1950. He said, "Now that was before I had the discernment ministry, and I and I I I took the people by the hand, and if it if it would get all red and run stripes run over to you, I knew whether it was a terminal cancer or a disease." And you you have all heard him talk about that. Well, anyhow, this little story struck me again when he tells about the the man that said his wife was insane and she was in the institute and they brought her to this house and she was in the basement. You I'll just say enough so that you'll know what what what it was about. And the man come and asked brother Bram to come pray for him because he believed. And there was some doctors involved and some friends and so on. But they brought her there to this this room and and uh Brother Bram said, "I walked down and the husband said, "Oh, don't go down there. She she she's dangerous." Well, he he says, "Well," he said, "I'm a son of God." He said, "I'm I'm a servant of God." He said, "I went down not not arrogantly, but he trusted God." He said, "And I thought I'd reached out and take her hand and find out what what was wrong with her when I reached her hand." He said, "As soon as I grabbed her, she jerked me." And he said, "I put up my knee and caught her and hit her in the chest and bounced off." And he said, "I got free." And he said, "And I ran up there real quickly up the stairs real quickly." Said, and said, "See, I told you he's dangerous." And then the voice, she cries out said, "William Brandon, &gt;&gt; I have nothing to do with you. You have nothing to do with me." And the husband says, "She doesn't know her own name. She doesn't know my name. How does she know your name?" He said, "That's not &gt;&gt; the woman. That's not your wife. &gt;&gt; That's Satan." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now I challenge him." &gt;&gt; Said, "Satan, come out of him in the name of Jesus Christ." said, "She laid still, didn't move." &gt;&gt; He said, "I waited a few moments. I said, "Take her back to the institution." &gt;&gt; He already saw the vision. &gt;&gt; Take her back to the institution. &gt;&gt; He said, "In three days, she'll be at home." They took her and bound carried her cut up the way she was, took her back to the institution and uh with with the next morning when they came to the to her cell to where she was at to get her dressed for for for breakfast, she was already dressed sitting there in her right mind beginning to hum gospel songs. Oh my. &gt;&gt; He said and a few months later he said I no he said about I think it was half a year later I was in a certain city in a meeting he said and in walked this the families and they were there and said this one woman woman started waving at me started waving at me. I thought my goodness. Okay. Yeah. You know he said and she was just laugh smiling and just waving. So finally her husband kind of quietened her down and then brother said I stopped and said yes ma'am do you do you want to say something? He said you don't recognize me? said, "No." He said, "You're the one that you prayed for. I'm the one that you prayed for." And she was sitting there. She said, he said, "Dressed well, five children, all dressed neatly, combed hair, and her husband sitting there, one beautiful family, &gt;&gt; just one touch of the invisible God, &gt;&gt; proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday." That's the whole ministry of the message was to turn our hearts back to the living reality of Jesus Christ that he never changes. He's the same tonight in every which way. He He cannot change. If he could change, [clears throat] he wouldn't be God. &gt;&gt; It's impossible because his thoughts in the beginning were perfect. That's right. But there's only one way and we realize even science is figuring this out now today. There's so many places that you get and you realize it's getting so tight in your in your identification line of identifications. How how we realize that anything that Satan has has been copied. You ever think of that Satan hasn't got an original idea? He's got to take God's word and twist it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to twist it much. Just one word &gt;&gt; as all he ever just caught. What Eve did is just just just heard him too long. &gt;&gt; She should have walked away. Said, "Get it behind me, Satan." I tell you as a Christian that's good behoo that's good message for all of us when Satan comes to you with something said and you know what there's no household but where the washing of the water of the word isn't necessary all the time &gt;&gt; your pastor will appreciate you if you stay washed in the water of the word keep washing washing washing walk with God he'll appreciate you'll appreciate one another and and you know you don't all have to go to this church to be in Christ I I'm I'm glad I'm I'm Brother, I'm so glad you got it. This church is in Tucson. &gt;&gt; Not just one. &gt;&gt; You know, there's room. Room. Yes, there's room. &gt;&gt; You don't have to see all like I see it. &gt;&gt; Or [clears throat] like your pastor or and all you want to do is look through the eyes of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just watch. And and one of the things that's that's so beautiful in life is that you know things don't always develop right away but prove all things and then you hold on to that which is good. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you say oh that there's that person. Oh, you ought to watch that. Maybe you but see whether that spirit is right or not. Then you watch it then watch your own spirit. That's a good one. &gt;&gt; That's a good one to do. Always watch your own spirit no matter what happens. And you can't and I I know this is quite a mouthful. Brother Bam says that it's quite a mouthful. He said, "If you can't bitterly disagree, &gt;&gt; that's right." &gt;&gt; I mean, bitterly disagree. Not even just slightly. Well, he looked at me wrong. No, didn't even say anything. Well, yeah. No, bitterly disagree. &gt;&gt; I don't think I've ever got to that place with my wife that I bitterly disagreed. I got a few things but but she had way more to disagree with. But what is a union? That we are made different for a purpose and a reason. And that's the reason why God has you here undoubtedly. See, he knows what what food you need and what what have and when he lays it on your pastor's heart, your pastor's heart, sometimes he's got to say things that sting. You don't feel good. &gt;&gt; But it's not made to destroy. It's made to correct. &gt;&gt; And I believe any man of God has that objective. Not to destroy, but to correct one another along the way. Make the thing settle it so that that it can continue to grow. Like you know, brother B talks about walking down there many times. This light little illustrations. as he goes. He says he looked at this one one uh uh log and uh how it was all it is all twisted because something laid over top of it and it makes it grow wrong. Sometimes you have to just remove the growth. It'll grow back again. Above all things was the scriptures say as we read here tonight these things that God has done. You know, we we're living in what we call sometimes I we at home is like, you know, the spirit of television and entertainment is is is a is a tremendous power and an influence, especially on the young people, but I I want you to just just hear me out. I don't mean it in any bad way, but I don't believe there's one single thing that can overcome is too great for God. He is no less to handle the latest device that Satan has put out there. &gt;&gt; He is no less God. He's able to conquer all things. &gt;&gt; Just trust him for it. You have different ways to raise your children than we did when we were there. Why? I mean, uh, you know what? Even when we grew up as kids on the farm, why we didn't have a quarter, we didn't know what temptation was hardly. We heard we never heard conversations today that it's been spoken and we didn't know words that they use today. &gt;&gt; They weren't even our vocabulary. &gt;&gt; And yet we had to fight to overcome. And it's the same thing here. You know, you've got some of the most powerful reality out you. If there is a question, it's in the it's in the answer book. It's in the Bible. If it isn't there, you don't find it. He'll say the find the prophet and say it'll go back there and show you in the scripture where it's written. sometimes and that and that's what's important and I really do believe that. I leave you with these thoughts as well. What I do really believe as a pastor or as a shepherd or as a brother that's preaching this gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you watch and watch the way the word of God kept unfolding progressively, there's many times brother Bram stops and he said, "See, I used to think, &gt;&gt; oh, I used to think that, oh, I I wish I could meet brother Neville and and and but there he is floating in a cloud. He said, "I used to think." Well, that when when he saw that it wasn't right, he didn't go back said, "Oh, there goes brother Neville floating in a cloud." He changed it. He said, "No, I'm when I meet brother Neville, I I'm going to shake his hand." He said, "Those people over there, they were they were human. They were like me." He said, "They hug me. I hugged them." The saints, look at the the that he went beyond the curtain of time said they were real. They were not myth. So, there's many things Brother Bam changed along the way. Sometimes you read a 1950 court or 1960 court, you find out he corrected in ' 62, 63. &gt;&gt; Well, one place he said the seals were closed. &gt;&gt; Later on he said they're open. &gt;&gt; One person told me said, "What?" I said, "What?" said they're closed. I said, "What are you going to do with the other part that they're open?" Well, I say they're closed, but they're opened. Hello. &gt;&gt; I'm talking revelation. &gt;&gt; It's not revelation. It It doesn't take science to do it either. Just trust the Lord. If God says it's changed, in fact, when brother Brandham preached the seven seals, I I always marvel at I I get all excited myself because I I know what happens. This Bible, if you ever read it through revelated eyes, [clears throat] it it it's it's different than what you might think it is. Sometimes when the revelation of Jesus Christ strikes you, you'll know that it's not you interpreting the word. &gt;&gt; It's God interpreting the word, revealing it to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Making it live, &gt;&gt; making it real. Because after all, that's what this and when you change it, &gt;&gt; just leave it the way it is. Sometimes sometimes God says things and you know, look at when he preached marriage and divorce. You know what he says is one of the one of the mysteries there was more trouble after he preached marriage and divorce than there was before almost around less people. Somebody's reading it wrong. I'm not saying I'm reading it right. But I tell you this, it was corrected. Everything that was corrected, he corrected it and did it right. I'm not here to I'm not here to stir up the pot. But I tell you this much. When he says it's been corrected, from that on you say what he said. &gt;&gt; Just say what he said. God takes care of his own word. &gt;&gt; There's a many things like that. is the evidence of the Holy Ghost. My for years &gt;&gt; Oh, perfect love. Nothing but perfect love will enter there. &gt;&gt; I still believe that's true. &gt;&gt; I don't believe there'll be one blemish, but nothing but perfect love. And that is not capable. We are not capable of doing that, &gt;&gt; but he is. &gt;&gt; And what we call love sometimes &gt;&gt; is a filio just not agile. love is able to bear one another. But when that prophet said things and corrected them along the way and just like what he said about the seventh seal said I I didn't I used to think it wasn't even written in there said come to find out it was written all the time but our eyes were withheld from it &gt;&gt; on an appointed time then when eyes come open then it shall be light about the evening time. You ever take that little course, it shall be light about the evening time? The path to glory you will surely find. Start so simple in the waterway is the light today. &gt;&gt; Buried in the precious name of Jesus Christ. Young and old, repent of all your sins. The Holy Ghost will surely enter in. Here's my part I like. It is a fact. &gt;&gt; I like that little part. It is a fact. &gt;&gt; Amen. that God and Christ are one. It is a fact that the mysteries of the seven thunders has been revealed. It is a fact that the invisible union is going on right now. It is a fact. Go back all the way back to Genesis. It is a fact that God is here doing the work &gt;&gt; while it's progressing daily on. He's just the Holy Spirit's moving just the same. And many times it's hard to keep up with it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But just walk with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it becomes greater and greater and greater because it is the reality of Jesus Christ to you personally and it'll never contradict the message. You'll find out. Then if you open it to say, "Well, he said it here, but he corrected it here. Then we'll keep going on with that. We keep doing that. We keep moving on with that." It keeps building, keeps building, keeps building. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until you look back and say, "Say, we've gained a little ground. &gt;&gt; We're moving higher. &gt;&gt; Set your wings to the winds of faith. Give me a key on that if you would. I'm going to set that. Who Who plays the piano here? Oh yeah. I'm sorry about that. I'm getting all I like that part. There are two roads you can take. &gt;&gt; One by faith, one by sight. &gt;&gt; And the law of good and evil contrast will always be here. I tell you, it's so simple. Sometimes you think if God ever removed it, we wouldn't appreciate a single thing. [clears throat] But because the law of God, it takes the negative to appreciate the positive. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "If there wasn't an evil, wicked man or woman out there, you wouldn't know a righteous one. If there wasn't a sinner, you wouldn't know what an overcomer was." &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If this one said, "I said, I just can't. Oh, I just can't overcome. Here comes one and said, "Oh [music] my, all I do is just set my wings." Cuz it's not you that does the overcoming. It's Christ in you, the hope of glory. Greater is he that's in you than he that's in [music] the world. Sing that together. [music] There are two roads. [singing] You can take one by one by way. Just take the word of God [music] or what you see. [music] What you believe is [singing] what will be. All set your way [music] to the wind. You [music] can lie [singing] in a higher place. Do [singing and music] not struggle. It's my grave. [music] Set your glory to the [singing] wind of pain. Oh, watch your knees. What is it tonight? Watch your cry. [music] Watch your mountain. Is it your cry? Just be the word of God. And by and by [music and singing] oh it will far [music and singing] you will fly. So set your way [music] to the waves of f [singing] you can fly [music] to a higher. Oh, do not struggle. [music] For it's [singing] by grace, [music] send your to [music] watch the eagle in the sky. It's not a chicken, it's an eagle. He does not [music] struggle. I like that. He does not cry [music] for the power [music] that makes him [singing] all. [music] So send your way to the [music] window. You can fly [singing] to a [music] higher place. Do not struggle for is my gra [music] to the you are faithful oh Lord [music] you are faithful oh Lord Every day and every [music] hour you are faithful, oh Lord. [music] Why don't we stand to our feet? You are faithful, oh Lord. Yes, you are [singing] faithful. [music] Oh, every day and [music] every hour you are faith. [music] Oh Lord, let's bow our hearts and close our eyes. Is there one here would [music] say tonight, Lord, I know you're faithful. Keep me faithful. Reward me with the reward of saying to him that overcomemeth, I would grant to sit with [music] my as I sit with my father. If you're sick tonight, he was wounded. If you're in a trial or a test, [music] greater is he that goes before you. Never hurry. Never be weary. Cast your [music] cares upon him for he cares. You don't have to change anything. It's already done. He was wounded, bruised for our iniquity. Pray with me as [music] we commit these requests in your heart's desire to the Lord. Father, we commit them to you, Lord Jesus. I believe there [music] are Christians here tonight that believes every word that stands for this truth. Their whole life [music] is dedicated to you. Yet the battle sometimes gets greater and sometimes to [music] a place to where we feel like, Lord, how shall I rise above that by obeying and [music] walking in the light and faithfully staying true to your word. Bless the saints, Lord, the shepherd, the pastor here, the deacons, the trustees, [music] the musicians. May this be a lighthouse when you come, Lord Jesus. May there be saints who are reaching out when the [music] rapture takes place, Lord. I pray God that you'd add more too. If there's anybody out there, Lord, Lord, may we find them, Lord. We don't know where they're at, but preach the good news. Go tell it on the mountain everywhere that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Take away our doubt, Lord. &gt;&gt; Forgive us of our trespasses, Lord. And as we press toward the mark, laying aside every evil thought, we press toward the mark of the prize of high calling. We commit ourselves to you tonight and take an encouragement as we go to our homes. We thank you for this evening here tonight and in fellowship with your elect lady unto the elect lady. Right. Wasn't to the church age altogether was to the elect lady in [music] the age. Now to you the king immortal, the only wise God. We commit all things to [music] you Lord. The only true God, the living God. We pray and ask in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. This world is not my home. [music] I'm just a passage. My treasure is all somewhere. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] [music] &gt;&gt; home in this [singing] world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I [music and singing] have no friend like you. Heaven is not my home. Lord, what [singing] will I do? Ain't no me. [music] I have this open door and I can't feel at home [singing] in this world anymore. [music] Amen. Let me enjoy the word of the Lord tonight. Amen. [music] And we thank the Lord for brother Minnow just like a meat sandwich. Certainly appreciate that. And um we have a few prayer requests um tonight as we'll go to prayer just for a few moments. Um in a week or so I'll be going to Bogotaa, Colombia and Perea on a missionary trip and I covet your prayers. if you could keep me in your prayers. Myself and brother Mark Castillo, our good friend there from Bayer, New Mexico. Also, Sister Heather, she pulled a muscle a muscle in her left knee today and she was in [music] pain and um she's asking for prayer there. Also, Brother Art Salceto sent a text from his cousin James [music] Gutteras. He's asking for four things. Deliverance from a drug addiction, [music] deliverance from alcohol, and will to stay in the service of the Lord. That's number three. And number [music] four, he's on dialysis and is looking to have his kidneys healed. So, he's specifically asking for those four things. Also, [music] Brother Arts got a number of his family that are still um they've been going to the Bible study. So, they have another one coming up [music] in on Tuesday or so and it's been growing and little just his family members. So, pray for that family that the Lord will continue to bless them. It's a mystery how the word of God just gets a hold of a life like that and keep them in prayer. [music] Was there someone else here that had a request tonight? Yes, brother. Yes, brother Sean's going to North Carolina there with Dylan. He's asking for traveling mercies. Was there someone else that had a request, brother? Yes, Jonathan. Yes. Yes. What's that family name? Sabrina and her family. was in an accident. Okay. Yeah, pretty tragic accident. I think they lost one of the children and then some of them were in and out of the hospital, I believe. So, we want to keep that family in prayer um from the Tucson Tabernacle there. Some of those folks are really sad and so we'll keep them in prayer. Was there someone else that had a request they wanted to make known? Amen. Let's sing a little bit of that. Every day, every hour, you are faithful, oh God. Every day, every hour, you are faithful, [music and singing] oh God. Every day, every hour, you [singing and music] are faithful. Oh God, every day, every [singing] hour, our faithful. [singing and music] Oh, can you help me sing it? Every day, every hour, [singing] you [music] are faith. Oh. Oh. One more time. Every [singing and music] day, every hour. You are faithful, [singing and music] oh God. every [music and singing] day, every hour, [singing and music] you are faithful, oh God. Amen. Always pray for one another. Um, and so we'll take a few moments and [music] you can pray right at your seat. You can go down on your knees and pray and ask God to hear these requests and to pray for one another. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank God for his goodness to us. I'm just thinking of the scripture that one of the scriptures that brother Menow referred to in 1 Corinthians 1 verse 18. For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved. It is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Amen. So, we thank God he calls us in our simplicity, in our little peculiar ways. Amen. It's just so simple. a man can go down on his knees and pray and all of heaven will hear him or he'll hear her and answer a prayer just miraculously. So, we'll stand to our feet. Uh remember, there's a youth Bible study. Brother Kim is going to uh teach that for us this Friday. It'll be here at 6. It's in the um the announcements there um for the older I think it's 14 and up, something like that. And um I think it'll be very good. Brother Kim is a real blessing to us and we kind of tease a lot and but he really is a blessing and I thank God for him. I look forward to um some of the things he would have to say. He's taught and he was an educator and dealt with the kids there in in a large school there up in Cloverdale and has done so much experience with different things. And I know and believe it'll be a blessing for you. And if you can uh get uh take the time and get uh someone that you think would help yourself is actually adults and and for the youth. I think it'll be a blessing. Amen. Let us sing that song. Any more announcements that I'm not thinking of? No. Let's sing that song. When we all get to heaven, what a day of rejoicing that will be. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. Sing the wondrous love of Jesus. [music] Sing his mercy and his grace. Oh, in the manions bright and [singing and music] blessed, he'll prepare for us a place.
