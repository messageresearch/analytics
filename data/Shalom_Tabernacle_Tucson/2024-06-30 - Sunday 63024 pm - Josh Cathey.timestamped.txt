[39:37] that I had I spoken at Mesa a few weeks
[39:40] ago I think maybe a month ago and um the
[39:43] last few days it just been on my heart
[39:44] again so I thought I would try and share
[39:47] that with you all um before I get too
[39:49] far I don't want to get in trouble I'm
[39:51] going tell everybody the title of my

[39:57] it was okay but you didn't tell nobody
[39:59] the title nobody knows what tell
[40:01] somebody the title next time so it's
[40:03] waiting on the victory just so I don't
[40:05] get berated and screamed at when I get
[40:08] home so while we're standing we'll turn
[40:10] to Hebrews chapter 10 thank you
[40:14] musicians Hebrews chapter 10 vers 31-38
[40:31] Hebrews 10: 31-38 verse 31 says it is a
[40:36] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[40:38] the Living God but call to remembrance
[40:41] the former days in which after you were
[40:43] illuminated you endured a great fight of
[40:47] afflictions partly whilst you were made
[40:49] a gazing stock both by reproaches and
[40:52] afflictions and partly whilst you became
[40:54] Companions of them that were so used for
[40:57] ye had compassion on me and my bonds and
[41:00] took joyfully the spoiling of your goods
[41:03] knowing in yourselves that ye have in
[41:05] heaven a better and an enduring
[41:07] substance listen to verse 35 and 36 cast
[41:10] not away therefore your confidence which
[41:13] hath great recompense of reward for ye
[41:16] have need of patience that after ye have
[41:19] done the will of God ye might receive
[41:22] the promise for yet a little while and
[41:25] he that shall come will come and will
[41:27] not tar now the just shall live by faith
[41:30] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[41:33] have no pleasure in him let's bow our
[41:36] heads Heavenly Father we just ask that
[41:38] you would bless this service tonight
[41:40] Lord that you would walk amongst us Lord
[41:42] that you would watch over me you would
[41:44] watch over each one here Lord that you
[41:46] would anoint ears to hear that you would
[41:48] anoint my mouth this vessel just to move
[41:51] out of the way just to just so you can
[41:53] work here tonight Lord father we trust
[41:55] you and we thank you for the service
[41:57] this morning we just ask that you would
[41:59] be here amongst us in Jesus Christ's
[42:01] name amen amen you may be
[42:04] seated so throughout the scripture you
[42:07] know we see great victories for the
[42:09] believer Old Testament New Testament you
[42:12] can see Victory after Victory but
[42:15] Victory as a Believer it is God's will
[42:17] but he he is Sovereign in his
[42:19] timing we know that our Victory is what
[42:22] he wants for us but his timing it's not
[42:24] the same as our timing it doesn't always
[42:26] happen when we want it doesn't happen in
[42:29] the best circumstances the best time
[42:31] it's not ever going to be the perfect
[42:32] time but he will come that's the promise
[42:36] you know there's times that we don't
[42:38] have to wait on Victory but sometimes we
[42:40] do there's times we do have to wait on
[42:42] Victory and that's all throughout the
[42:44] scripture you know a parent can tell a
[42:47] lot about a child's
[42:49] maturity by how they react when you tell
[42:51] them no or maybe when you tell them no
[42:54] not right now at this exact time you can
[42:57] tell how far along your child is in a
[42:59] lot of things when you just simply tell
[43:01] them no you can't have and it's not
[43:03] being mean to them but it's just seeing
[43:05] where they're at and that's what God
[43:07] does with us sometimes just to see where
[43:09] we're at he it it's the easiest thing in
[43:12] the world for him it's snap of a finger
[43:13] it could happen but he wants to see
[43:16] where you're at he wants to know what
[43:18] happens when he says no and you have to
[43:21] struggle a little bit when it has to get
[43:22] a little tight sometimes he wants to see
[43:25] where you are
[43:28] and I think this day that we live in and
[43:30] all the advancements and all the easy
[43:31] routes and all the you know everything's
[43:33] at the the touch of a finger every
[43:35] there's fast food there's everything is
[43:37] so convenient and it's made this an age
[43:40] of convenience and we can see it
[43:42] sometimes you know everything's
[43:43] convenient outside of the church and
[43:45] then sometimes we want convenience
[43:47] inside of the church but if you look
[43:49] through the scriptures convenience is
[43:51] not that's not something that Believers
[43:53] had in the scripture and I don't think
[43:55] God's going to change I don't think all
[43:57] of a sudden this day it's going to be
[43:59] convenient for everybody it's not all
[44:01] going to be smooth it's not going to be
[44:03] just an easy road to walk to be a
[44:05] believer because it never has been and
[44:07] it never will
[44:08] be but it's led to this also being an
[44:11] age of
[44:12] impatience nobody knows how to wait on
[44:14] anything anymore I mean in the fast food
[44:17] line if some if a car sits there too
[44:19] long ahead of you five minutes you're
[44:20] honking a
[44:21] horn things like that we and that as we
[44:25] said it spills into the church sometimes
[44:27] we had that same mindset coming into a
[44:29] service or maybe going down on our knees
[44:32] praying for something those carnal
[44:34] Tendencies can influence the spiritual
[44:37] Tendencies and they can start crossing
[44:39] over too much and when they do that we
[44:42] want everything at the tip of our
[44:44] fingers and luckily the Lord has done
[44:45] that we have the message all on our
[44:48] phones we have the scripture all on our
[44:50] phones but ju with the good comes bad
[44:54] too and it's got us comfortable it's got
[44:56] us a little little complacent with
[44:58] things like that we don't want to wait
[44:59] too long so there's a second scripture
[45:01] I'd like to go to it's judges 6 veres 7
[45:04] through
[45:05] 27 judges 6 verses 7- 27 now a little
[45:10] background on this scripture Israel at
[45:13] this point they had been delivered into
[45:15] the hand of Midian for seven
[45:17] years and from the first day to the last
[45:20] day when they got out of the hand of
[45:22] Midian they W it out they they didn't
[45:25] enjoy it in there but they had to way
[45:27] upon the Lord they had to sit for a
[45:29] minute and they had to wait they cried
[45:31] and they cried but they had to wait
[45:34] verse 7 it says and it came to pass when
[45:36] the children of Israel Cried unto the
[45:38] Lord because of the midianites that the
[45:40] Lord sent a prophet unto the children of
[45:42] Israel which said unto them thus sayith
[45:45] the Lord God of Israel I brought you up
[45:47] from Egypt and brought you forth out of
[45:49] the house of bondage and I delivered you
[45:52] out of the hand of the
[45:53] Egyptians and and out of the hand of all
[45:56] that oppressed you and drave them out
[45:58] from before you and gave you their land
[46:00] and I said unto you I am the Lord your
[46:03] God fear not the gods of the amorites in
[46:06] whose land ye dwell but ye have not
[46:08] obeyed my voice and there came an angel
[46:11] of the Lord and sat under an oak which
[46:13] was in ofra that pertained unto joash
[46:16] the abite and his son Gideon threshed
[46:20] Wheat by the wine press to hide it from
[46:23] the
[46:23] midianites now it's just like our enemy
[46:26] today he's going to try and take what is
[46:27] rightfully yours the ground that is
[46:30] rightfully yours Gideon here was
[46:32] threshing wheat at the wine press they
[46:34] did that at the threshing floor and that
[46:37] threshing floor by God's given Rights
[46:40] was Israel's but at this point it was in
[46:42] the hand of Midian they had taken it
[46:45] from him just as the enemy will and it
[46:48] goes on it says and the angel of the
[46:49] Lord appeared unto him and said unto him
[46:52] the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of
[46:54] Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my
[46:57] Lord if the Lord be with us why then is
[47:00] all this befallen us you know sometimes
[47:03] it's hard to see the purpose it's hard
[47:06] to see why the road behind you has been
[47:08] so rough it's hard to see why you've had
[47:11] to it was hard for Gideon to see why he
[47:13] had to be a part of this why he had to
[47:15] be captured by the
[47:17] midianites and then we ask the Lord why
[47:20] that may be one of the you know we
[47:22] probably don't say it outwardly but when
[47:23] we're down on our knees sometimes that
[47:26] might be the most asked question to the
[47:28] Lord is why why do I have to go through
[47:31] this why am I going through this because
[47:34] in the midst of the battle it's hard to
[47:35] see the end of the line it's not the
[47:37] easiest thing to
[47:39] see he says and where be all his
[47:42] miracles which are fathers told us of
[47:44] saying did not the Lord bring us up from
[47:46] Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us
[47:50] and delivered us into the hands of the
[47:52] midianites so this this is a day that
[47:55] Gideon and is Israel alike had been
[47:57] waiting on for seven years now for the
[48:01] Lord to move on the scene for them and
[48:03] the very first thing that Gideon wants
[48:05] to do when the Lord shows up on the
[48:07] scene is questioned not an amen not a
[48:10] Hallelujah not a praise the Lord but he
[48:12] asks questions he said well why is it
[48:14] had not not he's not rejoicing but he's
[48:17] questioning God he's asking questions
[48:19] right here and the Lord looked upon him
[48:21] and said go in this thy might and thou
[48:24] shalt save Israel from the hand of the
[48:26] midianites
[48:27] have not I sent thee now who sent Gideon
[48:30] Israel didn't send him nobody else sent
[48:32] him but the Lord sent Gideon that's what
[48:35] was important here is that the Lord had
[48:38] sent him says and he said unto him oh my
[48:41] Lord wherewith shall I save Israel
[48:44] behold my family is poor in Manasseh
[48:47] look at his selft talk look at Gideon
[48:49] what he's saying my family's poor in
[48:50] manessa and I'm the least in my father's
[48:53] house what was Gideon looking at at this
[48:56] point Gideon was looking at maybe who he
[48:58] and Israel had been up to this point
[49:01] maybe who he was in that moment but the
[49:03] Lord was looking at who Gideon could be
[49:06] the Lord was looking a little bit
[49:07] farther down the line he can see farther
[49:09] than what we can he was seeing what
[49:12] Gideon could do could be a savior for
[49:15] Israel and today the same thing the
[49:17] enemy he will keep you looking behind
[49:20] yourself he'll keep you looking at every
[49:23] mistake you've made at the one you made
[49:25] earlier today at the one you made last
[49:27] week he'll keep you honed in on that and
[49:30] not what God's purpose is in your life
[49:34] he'll he'll just repeat it'll be like a
[49:36] slideshow he'll repeat it over and over
[49:38] in your mind so you'll never think that
[49:41] you're good enough to do anything that
[49:42] God has for you to do in this life he
[49:45] wants you to doubt your position as a
[49:47] believer in this day he wants you to
[49:50] doubt any calling that you may have in
[49:52] your life in this day you know if you're
[49:55] a singer he wants you to doubt whether
[49:57] you're worthy to get up here and sing
[49:59] whether you're good enough to get up
[50:00] here and sing if you're a preacher he
[50:01] does the same thing if you're just a
[50:03] person that says Amen on the Pew he's
[50:05] goingon to do the same thing should I
[50:07] really be saying amen after what I did a
[50:10] few weeks ago he's gonna do that over
[50:13] and over but we have to push forward we
[50:15] have to push through that we can't buy
[50:17] into that nonsense because that's all it
[50:19] is is nonsense because God says
[50:21] different it's not what the enemy says
[50:23] in this day we go on verse 16 it says
[50:26] and the the Lord said unto him surely I
[50:28] will be with thee and thou shalt Smite
[50:30] the midianites as one man and he said
[50:33] unto him if now I have found Grace in
[50:35] thy sight then show me a sign that thou
[50:38] talkest with me let's skip down to verse
[50:40] 20 here now verse 20 this is Gideon
[50:44] presenting his
[50:45] sacrifice says and the angel of God said
[50:48] unto him take the Flesh and the unle
[50:50] cakes and lay them Upon This Rock and
[50:53] pour out the broth and he did so and I
[50:56] thought that was interesting that
[50:57] Gideon's sacrifice is laid on the same
[51:00] rock that he had cried over the same
[51:03] rock that that he had been worried over
[51:06] it was on that wine press he had to lay
[51:09] that sacrifice over this this place of
[51:12] bondage in his
[51:13] life but the sacrifice cleansed that
[51:16] area the sacrifice was accepted by the
[51:19] Lord as is
[51:21] ours says then the angel of the Lord put
[51:23] forth the end of the staff that was in
[51:25] his hand and touched the flesh and the
[51:27] unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire
[51:29] out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh
[51:32] and the unleavened cakes then the angel
[51:34] of the Lord departed out of his sight
[51:37] now notice here just after Gideon had
[51:39] seen this happen now th this is a cry
[51:42] that they've been crying for seven years
[51:44] out to God and it is answered he has
[51:46] moved on the scene but his first emotion
[51:50] after this after he sees this happened
[51:52] is fear that's his very first emotion
[51:55] that happens because what did the enemy
[51:57] do he wanted to make him think he did
[51:59] something wrong he wanted to make him
[52:01] think that he had messed up right here
[52:03] you know when you have a victory in your
[52:05] life the enemy will always try and scare
[52:08] you back into submission into that
[52:10] submission that he had you in if you're
[52:12] healed of something in your body he's
[52:14] going to make whatever that is Fester up
[52:18] again because he wants it to make you
[52:20] doubt your healing or anything like that
[52:23] mental healing he wants to make you
[52:26] doubt that in your life and so he's
[52:28] going to put scarecrows up and try and
[52:30] get you back into that bondage try and
[52:33] get you to confess that same bondage you
[52:35] were already
[52:36] in goes on it says and when Gideon
[52:39] perceived that he was an angel of the
[52:40] Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for
[52:43] because I have seen an angel of the Lord
[52:45] face to face and the Lord said unto him
[52:47] peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt
[52:50] not die then Gideon built an altar there
[52:53] unto the Lord and called it Jehovah
[52:55] shalom unto this day it is yet an ofra
[52:58] of the absit and it came to pass listen
[53:01] to this know this is hard to believe and
[53:04] it came to pass the same night so you
[53:07] mean to tell me that Gideon didn't have
[53:10] any time to go get a Manny and a petty
[53:13] in between these tough times in his life
[53:15] he didn't have any time to sit down and
[53:18] do something relaxing no it was working
[53:22] it was time to move forward again there
[53:25] he he had been in a challenge and up to
[53:27] that challenge here's one smack dab
[53:28] right on the back side of it there was
[53:31] no rest because the enemy he's not going
[53:33] to take a day off God doesn't want you
[53:35] to take a day off he doesn't want you to
[53:37] take a Sunday night off a Sunday morning
[53:39] off a Wednesday evening off that's not
[53:41] what we do especially in this age when
[53:44] he's so cunning and he's so deceitful we
[53:47] can't afford to take time off in this
[53:50] day we cannot afford
[53:54] it it doesn't matter if there's there's
[53:56] a Red Sea standing in our way as we see
[53:58] in the scripture the prophet says here
[54:01] in the message God keeps his word it's
[54:03] in
[54:03] 57 he says now that's what it is coming
[54:07] to now my brother it's coming to a place
[54:09] that those who reject Christ he's
[54:12] becoming Darkness to them to those who
[54:14] accept it it's becoming light to them we
[54:18] are living in that day just before
[54:20] Crossing and did you notice how easy it
[54:23] was for the Creator God to send down a
[54:26] strong East Wind and just divide the Red
[54:29] Sea and take his children
[54:32] across said oh the Red Sea got scared
[54:34] and just walled itself up because God's
[54:37] path LED through the middle of it that's
[54:40] the way God does things it wouldn't have
[54:41] matter if God's path that he wanted them
[54:44] to go on it wouldn't have mattered where
[54:45] it was through the middle of a jungle
[54:47] through the middle of a sea through the
[54:49] middle of the entire ocean there would
[54:51] have been a way made no matter what
[54:56] says ' these people who was keeping his
[54:59] word walking in the light moving on
[55:00] following God's commands everything just
[55:03] opened up for them and if you want
[55:05] things to open up Take God at his word
[55:09] and start moving forward we might say
[55:12] today but how do I Take God at his word
[55:15] and move forward this reminds me some of
[55:17] the message this
[55:18] morning it's in s be of a good cheer
[55:21] it's in 54 says now if you get that man
[55:24] up there to say forward that man up
[55:25] there to say forward this man down here
[55:28] say forward you'll go forward if you can
[55:32] get God to say I'm the Lord that Health
[55:34] Thee the first Conscience Says I'm the
[55:37] Lord that Health thee and the
[55:39] subconscious says I am the Lord that
[55:42] Health thee you're going
[55:45] forward but when God says I'm the Lord
[55:47] that Health thee and the subconscious
[55:49] said or the conscious said I believe
[55:51] it's so and the subconscious said are
[55:53] you quite sure then you're not going in
[55:56] anywhere you're just run around in
[55:59] circles we have to agree within
[56:01] ourselves we have to know it's a truth
[56:03] from top to bottom inside out we got to
[56:06] believe it that it is the truth in this
[56:08] day he said you've got to get both all
[56:11] working together here here and there all
[56:15] in harmony then you can move forward
[56:18] there's nothing can stand in your way
[56:21] you're moving forward then as we go to
[56:25] verse 26 in the
[56:27] scripture says and built an altar unto
[56:30] the Lord thy God this was Gideon moving
[56:32] forward and what the Lord's
[56:33] commissioning him to do says and build
[56:35] an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the
[56:38] top of this rock in the ordered place
[56:40] and take the second bulock and offer a
[56:43] burnt sacrifice with the wood of the
[56:45] Grove which Thou shalt cut down then
[56:48] Gideon took men of his servants and did
[56:51] as the Lord had said unto him and so it
[56:53] was because he feared his father's
[56:55] household and the men of the city that
[56:57] he could not do it by day that he did it
[57:00] by night so what a victory Gideon had
[57:03] just had with the Lord but he was still
[57:07] a little fearful to take the next steps
[57:09] but if the Lord
[57:11] spoken we can't be scared to walk
[57:13] through anything if he speaks to you
[57:16] personally if this word is Vindicated in
[57:19] you if you see it manifest if you know
[57:21] it's working in your life you cannot be
[57:24] scared to walk through you I'll rephrase
[57:26] that you shouldn't be scared to walk
[57:28] through anything to step in a fiery
[57:32] furnace where the Flames are so high
[57:34] step into it because he'll be there just
[57:37] as he was before he's the same yesterday
[57:40] today and forever he will still be there
[57:43] he'll still show up again he's still a
[57:45] miracle working God he can still move in
[57:48] your life he still heals cancer he still
[57:51] he heals diabetes he still does all
[57:54] these things
[57:56] we can't forget that today let's not
[57:59] forget it he hasn't forgotten
[58:02] us because you're on God's path now you
[58:05] you may not be able to see very far
[58:07] ahead on God's path but if you keep that
[58:10] light with
[58:11] you and you pray with that light with
[58:14] you it will illuminate that path it
[58:17] won't be guesswork you'll know where
[58:19] you're going you'll know where the Lord
[58:21] wants you to go but you have to keep
[58:23] that light with you that light in this
[58:25] day
[58:26] and it will illuminate that
[58:29] path in the message Victory Day in 63
[58:33] the prophet says now remember when God
[58:35] has counted you worthy when you have a
[58:38] test said now don't fail this to get
[58:41] this when you have a trial or a test it
[58:44] shows the grace of God has found he says
[58:47] you found favor with God you found favor
[58:51] with God and God believes that you'll
[58:54] send the test you know if God believes
[58:56] that you'll stand the test who are you
[58:57] to doubt whether you'll stand the test
[59:00] if God thinks that about you that highly
[59:01] about you who are you to doubt that who
[59:04] are we sometimes let's not doubt his
[59:07] word let's not doubt the commission
[59:09] maybe he's put in your life the calling
[59:11] he's put in your that's put in your life
[59:13] you have to know you have to know that
[59:16] you know that the Lord is going before
[59:19] you you'll fall on your face flat on it
[59:23] if you do it through your power you'll
[59:24] fall on your face it'll be a failure but
[59:28] if he's in it if he goes before you if
[59:30] you learn the weight on him sometimes
[59:33] and you let him walk that path before
[59:34] you you let the light go forth you won't
[59:37] fall on your face you'll see every
[59:38] pothole in front of you and you walk
[59:40] around it you'll see every trap in the
[59:43] road and you'll avoid it or even if you
[59:45] do fall into it that light will be there
[59:47] for you he'll be there to help you
[59:49] through it we can turn to judges 6 ver
[59:54] 36-40 going on with gide in a bit more
[59:57] he just needed a little bit more here he
[1:00:00] had to know
[1:00:03] this judges 6: 36-4 it says and Gideon
[1:00:07] said unto God if thou wil save Israel by
[1:00:10] mine hand as thou has said behold I will
[1:00:13] put a fleece of wool in the floor and if
[1:00:15] the D be on the fleece only and it be
[1:00:18] dry upon all the Earth beside then shall
[1:00:20] I know then shall after all this then
[1:00:24] shall I know
[1:00:26] then shall I know that thou wil save
[1:00:28] Israel by mine hand as thou has said and
[1:00:31] it was so for he rose up early on the
[1:00:33] tomorrow and thrust the fleece together
[1:00:35] and ringed the Dew out of the fleece a
[1:00:37] bowl full of water and Gideon said on
[1:00:40] the God he knew he was stepping on some
[1:00:43] Dangerous Ground here he knew he was
[1:00:44] starting to to press it a little bit
[1:00:47] said and Gideon said unto God let not
[1:00:49] thine anger be hot against me and I will
[1:00:51] speak but this once let me prove I pray
[1:00:54] thee but this one once ain't that funny
[1:00:57] but this once we already we just asked
[1:00:59] and it just happened but this
[1:01:01] once but this once with the fleece let
[1:01:04] it now be dry only upon the fleece and
[1:01:06] upon all the ground let there be due and
[1:01:09] God how merciful of God and how he is to
[1:01:13] us that merciful that graceful we ask
[1:01:17] over and over we stumble and stumble
[1:01:19] sometimes and the mercy he shows us when
[1:01:22] you think when you meditate on that a
[1:01:24] little bit and maybe when you're down on
[1:01:25] your your knees praying and you really
[1:01:27] let that Mercy you internalize it and
[1:01:29] you let that Mercy sink in you can't
[1:01:31] hardly imagine it you can't realize what
[1:01:34] that's like as as a carnal human being
[1:01:36] sometimes says and God did so that night
[1:01:39] for it was dry upon the fleece only and
[1:01:41] there was due on all the ground so from
[1:01:44] this moment on though if you follow that
[1:01:46] scripture throughout Gideon wasn't
[1:01:48] asking any more
[1:01:50] questions he was in action it was time
[1:01:53] to move forward it was time to take back
[1:01:55] what was his but the Lord had to get get
[1:01:57] his character to where he could use him
[1:02:00] he had to get him to where he could do
[1:02:02] something with him he had to mature him
[1:02:04] some and that's just the same as he does
[1:02:07] with us today you know a
[1:02:10] sheep a sheep isn't born to sheep it's
[1:02:13] born a
[1:02:14] lamb and then it has the maturing
[1:02:16] process it's got a lot of
[1:02:17] characteristics about it it's got a lot
[1:02:19] of things that change before it becomes
[1:02:21] a sheep and the mo it's very interesting
[1:02:24] one of the main things that shows that a
[1:02:26] lamb has become a sheep is that they
[1:02:28] finally recognize and listen to The
[1:02:31] Shepherd's voice that's one of the last
[1:02:33] things where they can say that that's a
[1:02:34] full grown matured sheep that's a sheep
[1:02:37] that knows what to do I can let that
[1:02:39] sheep out and let it go fulfill its
[1:02:41] purpose
[1:02:42] somewhere and it's not just hearing the
[1:02:44] voice but it's
[1:02:47] recognizing and listening to what the
[1:02:51] voice of the shepherd says it's not one
[1:02:53] without the other you have to recognize
[1:02:56] who the shepherd is first and that sheep
[1:02:58] has to know that Shepherd and it has to
[1:03:01] listen to that
[1:03:03] voice in the scripture here even if
[1:03:06] Gideon hadn't got an answer though even
[1:03:08] if he hadn't got an answer at this point
[1:03:10] when he did get that answer it would
[1:03:13] have only made it that greater it would
[1:03:15] have only made the miracle of Israel
[1:03:17] being delivered out of the midianites
[1:03:19] hands that greater when it did happen
[1:03:22] you know Gideon which I can respect him
[1:03:25] for Gideon didn't want some manufactured
[1:03:27] miracle that he had done himself he
[1:03:29] didn't want to go work the guys up and
[1:03:32] get them together no he wanted to make
[1:03:34] sure that this was God moving in this
[1:03:36] day he wanted to make sure that God was
[1:03:38] going to go before him he wanted it all
[1:03:41] to be the Lord and I believe that the
[1:03:43] Lord had respect on his desire and his
[1:03:46] motive I believe that's why the Lord
[1:03:48] didn't get mad angry at Gideon when he
[1:03:52] asked over and over because he knew what
[1:03:54] his desire and what Gideon's motive was
[1:03:57] it wasn't to be flashy it wasn't to walk
[1:03:59] out and say Lord do another miracle here
[1:04:01] do another miracle here I want these
[1:04:03] people to think I'm something that
[1:04:05] wasn't Gideon he wanted to be sure that
[1:04:08] God was going before him and sometimes
[1:04:11] we can be guilty of kind of
[1:04:13] manufacturing our own
[1:04:15] fleece you know we can we can say oh
[1:04:18] Lord I I don't know if I should buy this
[1:04:20] thousand dog Lord I don't know if I
[1:04:22] should get this new truck this new car
[1:04:24] Lord I don't know if I should do this so
[1:04:27] Lord if you would when I walk into
[1:04:28] church today I want the Pew that I sit
[1:04:30] on to be more comfortable than it's ever
[1:04:32] been and so we'll walk into church we'll
[1:04:35] get back here to our Pew and we'll go to
[1:04:37] sit down and there could be a hundred
[1:04:38] needles sticking out of that and you sit
[1:04:40] down you say oh yeah that's comfy that's
[1:04:43] how we do it sometimes you manufacture
[1:04:46] that fleece it wasn't comfortable the
[1:04:48] Lord might answered you right there but
[1:04:49] no matter what your mind's made up on
[1:04:52] what you want your fleece to do but we
[1:04:54] have to be open to God's change open to
[1:04:57] God's way we have to wait on him in this
[1:05:01] day but I like that get in didn't want
[1:05:04] to take it into his own
[1:05:06] hands in the message the restoration of
[1:05:08] the brid tree in 62 he says the prophet
[1:05:12] says you don't have to knck down to the
[1:05:14] devil he said we've got a law That's the
[1:05:18] Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing
[1:05:21] you know have to do is know how to let
[1:05:24] go and let God and I know that's that's
[1:05:26] became like the live laugh love thing
[1:05:28] like that everybody puts in their house
[1:05:30] let go and let God that's became almost
[1:05:33] people just overuse it but in reality
[1:05:35] it's very true and if we take that to
[1:05:38] heart in our prayer closets when we're
[1:05:39] down on our knees when we can really let
[1:05:42] go and let God and realize what that
[1:05:44] means he said you keep fighting at it
[1:05:47] see and it won't never work when you let
[1:05:50] go and let God that's all see and a
[1:05:53] couple paragraphs down in the same
[1:05:55] message there
[1:05:56] it might be 108 yeah 108 and the same
[1:06:00] way it is with us it isn't what we fight
[1:06:03] and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get
[1:06:05] this if I don't get that that's not it
[1:06:08] it's to know that the law of life is in
[1:06:10] you and you just let go and let God then
[1:06:14] he takes you to your healing you don't
[1:06:17] take yourself there he takes you to your
[1:06:19] healing he takes you to the baptism of
[1:06:22] the spirit or anything that he's
[1:06:24] promised any claim that he's given is
[1:06:27] yours and by letting go and letting God
[1:06:31] I believe that's what happened at that
[1:06:33] prayer meeting in the morning time
[1:06:35] letting go and letting God letting God
[1:06:37] move on the scene making God your number
[1:06:39] one choice not a medicine not a doctor
[1:06:42] but saying I I believe I'm gonna make
[1:06:44] the Lord My All In All today and every
[1:06:48] day I'm GNA take him at his word and I'm
[1:06:50] going to March forward no matter what
[1:06:52] the reports say and I'm going to get
[1:06:54] hands laid on me or I'm going to go by
[1:06:56] myself and I'm going to pray for it and
[1:06:58] I believe that the Lord will move on the
[1:07:00] scene for
[1:07:01] me but with Gideon God had spoken
[1:07:04] already it didn't matter at this point
[1:07:06] if Gideon had one man beside him if he
[1:07:09] had an army of a million men it didn't
[1:07:11] matter if he was by
[1:07:12] himself victory was his and he knew it
[1:07:15] the prophet said in a different place
[1:07:17] nothing will stop a man once he gets his
[1:07:19] answer from the
[1:07:21] Lord but what about before that answer
[1:07:24] comes how are we handling it are we
[1:07:27] listening for an answer are we making up
[1:07:28] our own answer are we manufacturing our
[1:07:32] own
[1:07:33] answer do we really want God's answer or
[1:07:36] are we so decided within ourselves of a
[1:07:38] way that we're going to go that it
[1:07:40] doesn't matter if he he could our answer
[1:07:42] could come on the front of a bus and it
[1:07:44] could hit us and we'd still ignore
[1:07:46] it are we that made up sometimes or is
[1:07:50] there room for him to move in our lives
[1:07:52] do we leave enough room for him today
[1:07:55] for him to do something for him to speak
[1:07:57] to us you know as a Believer I don't
[1:07:59] think there's any time in our lives
[1:08:01] where we're not waiting on the Lord for
[1:08:04] something if you think about that
[1:08:06] thought at all times it doesn't maybe
[1:08:09] the only thing you're maybe your life is
[1:08:11] great and the only thing you're waiting
[1:08:12] on is a body change you're still waiting
[1:08:14] on something you're still waiting on the
[1:08:16] Lord to
[1:08:18] move at all times we're waiting on him
[1:08:21] and we should be he wants us to he
[1:08:25] doesn't want us to take this whole life
[1:08:26] in our hands and try and let that's what
[1:08:28] we were doing before we met
[1:08:30] him he wants to lead the way he wants to
[1:08:33] be the light in another message
[1:08:36] remembering the Lord he says and then if
[1:08:39] we just sit still and let him answer us
[1:08:42] back said many things and one of the
[1:08:45] horrible things that I do I try to do
[1:08:49] all the talking and not sit still long
[1:08:52] enough for him to answer me back you
[1:08:54] know one of the most obnoxious things
[1:08:58] that another person can
[1:09:00] do is come to you for advice or just
[1:09:03] wanting you to help them with something
[1:09:05] and then they talk the whole time and
[1:09:08] never give you any room to help them
[1:09:11] they come to you with question after
[1:09:12] question and they're they're talking the
[1:09:15] whole time and they never I almost said
[1:09:18] shut up well I guess I did just say it
[1:09:20] but they never stop talking long enough
[1:09:23] for you to get a word in and that's how
[1:09:25] we are with the Lord sometime it's
[1:09:27] coming to the Lord this this this this
[1:09:29] and this and he never gets a word in
[1:09:32] God's Not A yes man that's not how he's
[1:09:35] going to work in your life he's going to
[1:09:37] be honest with you he's going to tell
[1:09:39] you the truth and he's going to tell you
[1:09:41] what's
[1:09:43] wrong as he goes on he said we do that
[1:09:45] so many times in prayer I think if we
[1:09:47] would get off of our hearts what's in it
[1:09:50] and express oursel to the Lord Jesus and
[1:09:53] then just kneel and just be still a
[1:09:55] while and just see what he would say
[1:09:58] back to us see now that sounds simple
[1:10:00] but how many's doing that how many's
[1:10:02] really having a quiet time right there
[1:10:04] at the end you you pour your heart out
[1:10:07] to him and then wait on an answer not
[1:10:09] you pour your heart out then hop up and
[1:10:11] you go do the next thing whatever you
[1:10:12] were actually thinking about during the
[1:10:15] prayer because that's where we get
[1:10:17] sometimes
[1:10:18] too you sit there and you act like
[1:10:20] you're praying to God God knows your
[1:10:22] heart he knows all of our hearts and I'm
[1:10:24] only saying I'm saying thank things I've
[1:10:25] done too you sit there and you pray but
[1:10:28] really you're thinking about that next
[1:10:30] meal really you're thinking about these
[1:10:32] other things in life but no we have to
[1:10:34] get consecrated we have to get quiet
[1:10:36] before and then we got to stay quiet
[1:10:38] long enough for him to speak back to us
[1:10:40] for him to tell us
[1:10:43] something the prophet says here and
[1:10:45] sometimes I've did that and my whole
[1:10:48] opinion was
[1:10:50] changed he did that and his whole
[1:10:52] opinion was changed let's turn to
[1:10:54] another scripture real quick if we can
[1:10:55] it is 2 Samuel
[1:10:58] 5: 17-
[1:11:02] 24 2 Samuel 5: 17-
[1:11:08] 24 now here's David and how he's had to
[1:11:11] or having to once again wait on Victory
[1:11:14] now in this scripture David he had just
[1:11:17] had some great victories in his life he'
[1:11:19] finally been made King over Israel and
[1:11:21] had also taken back Jerusalem some
[1:11:24] things he had waited for waited on for a
[1:11:27] very long time we start here with verse
[1:11:29] 17 but when the Philistines heard that
[1:11:32] they had anointed David King over Israel
[1:11:35] all the Philistines came up to seek
[1:11:38] David when the enemy sees a blessing in
[1:11:40] your life when he sees the Lord starting
[1:11:42] to move in your life he's coming so
[1:11:45] don't doubt that don't think it's going
[1:11:46] to be a road of ease he's coming after
[1:11:49] he sees that you know like in in war if
[1:11:52] there's a side that's approaching a
[1:11:54] stronghold some something that will win
[1:11:56] them the entire War the enemy is going
[1:11:59] to fire everything they can at them
[1:12:01] right there because they know if they
[1:12:03] get there it's over it's done with
[1:12:06] they've won it it's victory for
[1:12:08] them he goes on and he says and David
[1:12:11] heard of it and went down to the hold
[1:12:14] the Philistines also came and spread
[1:12:16] themselves in the valley of reim and
[1:12:18] David inquired of the Lord saying shall
[1:12:20] I go up to the Philistines wilt thou
[1:12:23] deliver them into mine hand and the lord
[1:12:25] said unto David go up for I will
[1:12:28] doubtless deliver the Philistines into
[1:12:30] thine hand now that's one of those
[1:12:32] victories you don't have to wait on
[1:12:35] that's one of those you send up a prayer
[1:12:36] and it's answered immediately it's one
[1:12:38] of those there's no waiting on that and
[1:12:40] David came to B pism and David smoted
[1:12:43] them there and said the Lord hath broken
[1:12:45] forth upon mine enemies before me as the
[1:12:48] breach of waters therefore he called the
[1:12:51] name of that place B pism and there they
[1:12:55] left their images and David and his men
[1:12:57] burned them and the Philistines came up
[1:13:00] yet again and spread themselves in the
[1:13:03] valley of reim look at that the enemy
[1:13:05] came up and spread themselves in the
[1:13:08] same exact Valley that they had just
[1:13:10] been in before isn't that how healing
[1:13:13] happens you have the problem the thing
[1:13:15] you need healed of you get healed and
[1:13:17] then the enemy comes back to that same
[1:13:19] exact spot he tries to hit you there
[1:13:22] again just to make you think that he
[1:13:24] might win this time time let's go on
[1:13:26] here he says and when David inquired of
[1:13:29] the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up
[1:13:31] but fetch a compass behind them and come
[1:13:34] upon them over against the mulberry
[1:13:37] trees now David knew he had just beat
[1:13:39] them in this exact Valley why would the
[1:13:42] Lord say no this time the first time was
[1:13:44] so simple it was so easy there was no
[1:13:47] waiting on the Lord why would the Lord
[1:13:49] say no this time why would he have to
[1:13:52] wait this
[1:13:53] time what did the Lord know that David
[1:13:56] didn't know well probably a lot but I
[1:13:59] imagine David wondered that to himself
[1:14:00] you know I've won this headon why do I
[1:14:03] have to lay and wait especially why do I
[1:14:05] have to do such a bizarre thing when I
[1:14:08] know I can take them head on why do I
[1:14:09] have to go around behind them and maybe
[1:14:11] laying some leaves and wait by some
[1:14:13] mberry trees that doesn't make any sense
[1:14:15] to me it reminds me sometimes you get
[1:14:18] stuck in traffic and you're sitting in
[1:14:20] that traffic maybe for five minutes and
[1:14:22] you're mad that you're stuck in traffic
[1:14:24] you're upset with it but then you get a
[1:14:26] little bit up the road and there's a
[1:14:28] crash that could have been
[1:14:30] you the Lord orchestrates those things I
[1:14:33] don't believe anything things by chance
[1:14:35] I believe he always watches his children
[1:14:38] he always watches over
[1:14:40] us but David was very used to Victory
[1:14:44] but Victory isn't always where the Lord
[1:14:46] teaches people it's the time leading up
[1:14:48] to the victory you know the true test
[1:14:51] it's not ever what we're actually going
[1:14:53] through but it's how we handle what
[1:14:55] we're going through you know the Lord
[1:14:58] let he he might let Satan afflict you in
[1:15:00] some way but he wants to see what you're
[1:15:02] going to do with it he wants to see how
[1:15:04] you're going to handle it but to us in
[1:15:07] our carnal Minds the test is the the
[1:15:09] hurting in our body or the pain in our
[1:15:12] minds the things that we're going
[1:15:14] through outwardly but the Lord wants to
[1:15:16] see what you're going to do with it he
[1:15:19] wants to see how you're going to react
[1:15:20] to it he wants some sons and daughters
[1:15:22] with some Backbone in this day that's
[1:15:25] not going to cower down that's not going
[1:15:27] to be handed a box of rattlesnakes and
[1:15:29] accept it no kick that box of
[1:15:32] rattlesnakes you don't got to take that
[1:15:34] thing that's no part yours don't sign
[1:15:36] for that don't sign for any of it and we
[1:15:40] would see Jesus in 59 the prophet says
[1:15:42] now sometimes when we meet the
[1:15:44] requirement we think about well it's why
[1:15:46] didn't he answer God does sometime that
[1:15:49] way Upon Our action to see what our
[1:15:52] reaction will be see sometimes look at
[1:15:55] the shunamite woman for instance see he
[1:15:57] wanted to see what her reaction would be
[1:16:00] and he does that many times just to see
[1:16:03] how we'll
[1:16:04] react but if if we're certain that we
[1:16:07] have met God's requirements just stay
[1:16:09] right with it and we have to be honest
[1:16:11] with ourselves if we've met his
[1:16:12] requirements or
[1:16:14] not we can't we can't go into it halfway
[1:16:17] not having met the requirements and
[1:16:18] expect something you got to be honest
[1:16:21] with yourself first meet those
[1:16:22] requirements and then move forward in
[1:16:24] the promise of God for this day just
[1:16:26] move forward in
[1:16:28] it says but if we're certain that we
[1:16:30] have met God's requirements just stay
[1:16:32] right with it he's got to act said you
[1:16:36] hear it he's got to act if we if he made
[1:16:40] the promise he's God and has kept that
[1:16:43] promise he's God he just can't take it
[1:16:46] back and say well I was mistaken God
[1:16:48] makes no mistakes when he said he could
[1:16:51] heal you when he said he could save you
[1:16:53] when he said he could redeem you none of
[1:16:55] that was mistakes that was all the
[1:16:57] perfect all right and another spot in an
[1:17:00] absolute in 63 says how David that great
[1:17:03] patriarch how we'd like to speak about
[1:17:05] him said we haven't time but and many
[1:17:08] times as we heard someone speaking a few
[1:17:10] moments ago about David and his sin but
[1:17:13] when all of it was forgiven when he was
[1:17:15] going to battle and we call it in the
[1:17:17] world the chips were down and the
[1:17:21] opposition was great and David laid
[1:17:23] under the tree and sweated it out I
[1:17:26] believe sometimes that's God's plan
[1:17:29] sometime for us we have to sweat it out
[1:17:32] you got to lay under that mulberry tree
[1:17:34] not knowing what's going to happen but
[1:17:36] believing what's going to happen by but
[1:17:39] what the word tells us and you have to
[1:17:41] lay there and you have to sweat it out
[1:17:42] sometimes he goes on he said until he
[1:17:45] heard the sound going through the
[1:17:46] mulberry bushes then it was different
[1:17:50] David Rose and went on because that he
[1:17:53] had an absolute that he knew that was
[1:17:56] God going on before him you know as
[1:17:59] David laid sweating it out there's a
[1:18:01] spot where the Prophet says that he
[1:18:03] could feel the enemy all around him that
[1:18:06] he might have been laying in some leaves
[1:18:08] or some bushes and that he could feel
[1:18:10] the enemy walking all around him now how
[1:18:14] unnerving would that be isn't that what
[1:18:16] we feel when we walk out here you can
[1:18:19] feel and you can see the enemy all
[1:18:22] around you you flip on if you got a TV
[1:18:24] and you flip it on he's there he's all
[1:18:26] around you if you look on your phone
[1:18:28] he's there he's all around you the enemy
[1:18:31] is constant he's everywhere we have to
[1:18:34] stay so Vigilant and then that's when
[1:18:36] all the Whata ifs start David's laying
[1:18:39] there he's had his promise given to him
[1:18:42] he's laying in these leaves these
[1:18:44] enemies are walking all around him it's
[1:18:46] a lot of pressure and he's laying there
[1:18:48] and these what if start you know what if
[1:18:50] the Lord doesn't
[1:18:52] come what if he doesn't show up
[1:18:55] or maybe today what if I claim my
[1:18:57] healing then still have symptoms what if
[1:18:59] I claim my healing in front of somebody
[1:19:02] and the next time they see me I'm still
[1:19:04] sick what if I try and confess my
[1:19:06] healing at work in front of my
[1:19:08] co-workers and then I come in next week
[1:19:11] and I'm still
[1:19:12] sick we worry about those things but
[1:19:14] that's God's business you don't worry
[1:19:17] about that you're not going to heal you
[1:19:18] so don't don't worry about it you
[1:19:21] confess that healing and step forward
[1:19:23] boldly yeah
[1:19:26] boldly not not not half-witted
[1:19:29] boldly with God's promise and see what
[1:19:32] happens see if it don't turn into a
[1:19:35] testimony next week see if that person
[1:19:37] don't come up and look at you and say
[1:19:39] they are healed maybe what they're
[1:19:42] talking about is the truth but as long
[1:19:44] as we're scared like that that testimony
[1:19:47] is never going to come forth it's never
[1:19:48] going to happen if you're too scared to
[1:19:50] take God at his word and wait on
[1:19:52] something a little bit May maybe another
[1:19:55] one what if I wait on the Lord and the
[1:19:57] situation only gets worse maybe not
[1:20:00] healing of the body but any situation
[1:20:02] that we deal with in everyday life what
[1:20:04] if you wait on the Lord for it you know
[1:20:05] you've been praying and it only gets
[1:20:07] worse maybe that's what David thought
[1:20:09] maybe thought because David he had won
[1:20:11] battles up to this point it probably
[1:20:13] crossed his mind well if I just jump up
[1:20:15] right now and surprise attack him I'll
[1:20:18] win this but that wasn't God's route it
[1:20:21] wasn't his route David might have
[1:20:23] thought that he might have been wor
[1:20:24] worried that they were going to look
[1:20:26] down see one of his men and then they
[1:20:27] were ambushed but that wasn't God's
[1:20:30] route that wasn't God's
[1:20:32] path David probably prayed and prayed
[1:20:35] while laying there wanting more guidance
[1:20:37] wanting to know more about the situation
[1:20:40] but it probably went silent because the
[1:20:42] Lord wanted to see David make the
[1:20:45] sacrifice of waiting on him he wanted to
[1:20:48] see if David would try and take it into
[1:20:50] his own hands or if he would wait on him
[1:20:55] I don't I don't know if David the
[1:20:57] scripture doesn't mention I don't know
[1:20:58] if David was a patient man but I this
[1:21:00] looks like a patience test to David to
[1:21:03] me to see if he would try and move out
[1:21:05] and from my own experience when you pray
[1:21:08] for patience or when the Lord is putting
[1:21:11] you through a test that's going to mold
[1:21:12] patience into you it's uncomfortable
[1:21:15] there there is no other way for it to be
[1:21:17] but uncomfortable I had a guy I worked
[1:21:19] with in Tennessee and he was his name
[1:21:21] was Terry km and he was talking to me
[1:21:24] one time about the scripture and he said
[1:21:26] my wife gets mad at me every time I pray
[1:21:28] for patience said I I come home and
[1:21:31] she's so mad at me because he would he
[1:21:33] would pray for patience and then the
[1:21:35] things that would have to mold the
[1:21:37] patience in his life would be happening
[1:21:39] to him and then he would be angry about
[1:21:41] it he'd be mad all the time at home and
[1:21:43] his wife would be like Terry you got to
[1:21:46] quit praying for patience this ain't
[1:21:48] good for our marriage just be unpatient
[1:21:50] don't pray for patience no more we don't
[1:21:52] need it that much but I I thought that
[1:21:54] was
[1:21:56] funny but as we're about to read we see
[1:21:58] David stayed faithful to the word of the
[1:22:00] Lord and faithfulness to the word and
[1:22:03] patience they go hand in hand you know
[1:22:06] you can look at how in this
[1:22:08] quote I found this other day and it I
[1:22:10] thought it was amazing in the exposition
[1:22:13] of the church ages you can look at how
[1:22:14] the Saints of the Dark Ages some of the
[1:22:16] toughest times to be a believer some
[1:22:19] stuff that we probably couldn't even
[1:22:20] imagine happening to them people just
[1:22:24] out landish things in the tharan age and
[1:22:27] he commended them for their faithful
[1:22:29] faithfulness and then their patience he
[1:22:31] says here I know your faith now he does
[1:22:35] not say here as he did to the church in
[1:22:38] pergamus y you hold my faith he is not
[1:22:41] talking about his faith now but he is
[1:22:43] commending them for their faithfulness
[1:22:45] and as he does he also mentions their
[1:22:48] patience how faithfulness and patience
[1:22:51] go together in fact patience is the
[1:22:54] outcome of
[1:22:56] faithfulness for it says in James 1:3
[1:22:59] the trying of your faith worketh
[1:23:01] patience there is absolutely no other
[1:23:04] way in which to gain patience listen to
[1:23:06] that there is absolutely no other way in
[1:23:10] which to gain patience it has to come by
[1:23:13] the trial of your
[1:23:15] faith says Romans 5:3 tribulation
[1:23:19] worketh patience how highly God regards
[1:23:22] this outworking of our patience is seen
[1:23:25] in James 1:4 but let patience have her
[1:23:28] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[1:23:31] entire lacking nothing God's will for us
[1:23:36] is
[1:23:37] perfection and that Perfection is
[1:23:40] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:23:43] God this is the process of character
[1:23:47] development now character that's that's
[1:23:50] what you're doing when nobody's looking
[1:23:52] that's what you're looking when you
[1:23:53] ain't got nobody body around to
[1:23:55] impress when the pastor ain't looking
[1:23:57] directly at you when your friend ain't
[1:23:59] looking right at you character
[1:24:01] development happens when you're all
[1:24:02] alone not all of it but a whole lot of
[1:24:06] it happens when it's just you and the
[1:24:07] Lord in a place and he's going to watch
[1:24:09] you he might put you he might allow
[1:24:11] something to come on you right there and
[1:24:13] he's going to see if that character has
[1:24:15] developed or not in you he's going to
[1:24:17] keep working it and working it and
[1:24:18] trying to mold it in you until he sees
[1:24:21] something come
[1:24:22] forth says how highly God has commended
[1:24:25] these Saints of the Dark Ages patient as
[1:24:28] Lambs led to the slaughter lovingly
[1:24:31] Faithfully i' have Lov to meet some of
[1:24:32] them people they served they Faithfully
[1:24:36] they served God that is all they wanted
[1:24:39] out of life just service to their lord
[1:24:42] how great was to be their reward you
[1:24:46] know how they worked for the Lord even
[1:24:49] when the trials came in the scripture
[1:24:51] when it's talking about this age it says
[1:24:53] the last to be more than the first
[1:24:56] talking about their service toward the
[1:24:58] lord talking about what they did for the
[1:25:00] Lord what they tried to do so in the
[1:25:02] Dark Age it only got darker as it went
[1:25:04] on and as it got darker all they did was
[1:25:08] work that much more for the Lord what
[1:25:10] else did they have to do what else were
[1:25:12] they going to do as it got harder as the
[1:25:15] squeeze got tighter all they did was
[1:25:17] work more for the Lord all they did was
[1:25:20] be more faithful be more patient in the
[1:25:22] Lord because they knew that there was a
[1:25:24] reward greater than anything they could
[1:25:26] get here greater than any popularity
[1:25:29] anything they could get
[1:25:31] here so we continue on in the scripture
[1:25:34] with David says and let it be when thou
[1:25:36] hearest the sound of a going in the tops
[1:25:39] of the mulberry trees that then Thou
[1:25:42] shalt bester thyself for then shall the
[1:25:45] Lord go out before thee to Smite the
[1:25:48] host of the Philistines when I was
[1:25:50] reading this scripture I just imagined
[1:25:53] that that sound going going through
[1:25:54] those mberry trees was a Russian Mighty
[1:25:56] Wind I imagine it probably sounded a
[1:25:59] whole lot like that when David was
[1:26:01] laying there and he looked over at those
[1:26:03] mulberry trees and he heard that Mighty
[1:26:05] Wind come through there and he said it's
[1:26:08] time to go now the promise of the Lord
[1:26:10] has been fulfilled we've waited we've
[1:26:12] done what God told us to do and now it's
[1:26:15] time to move the same wind as the day of
[1:26:18] Pentecost it's the same type of Promise
[1:26:20] given to David as the ones waiting in
[1:26:22] the upper room the same that type of
[1:26:24] promise it did he didn't give no time
[1:26:27] frame on when this would happen for
[1:26:28] David he didn't give any time frame to
[1:26:31] those 120 in the upper room but he said
[1:26:33] wait until wait until this happens and
[1:26:38] when it happens you'll know it and when
[1:26:41] it happens the promise will be fulfilled
[1:26:44] will you turn to one more place in the
[1:26:46] scripture very familiar
[1:26:48] spot Matthew
[1:26:51] 14 verses 22-33
[1:27:01] Matthew 14 verses
[1:27:03] 22-33 now this scripture keep in mind
[1:27:06] this is after a great miracle and a
[1:27:07] great Victory the disciples had just
[1:27:10] been a part
[1:27:11] of Jesus had just fed 5,000 plus women
[1:27:15] and children and they had seen that
[1:27:18] happen what what a miracle something
[1:27:20] that had probably never been done the
[1:27:22] likes of that had probably never been
[1:27:23] done before for nothing close to that
[1:27:26] and they had just seen the Lord move in
[1:27:28] this Mighty way verse 22 says and
[1:27:30] straightway Jesus constrained his
[1:27:32] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[1:27:35] before him unto the other side while he
[1:27:37] sent the multitudes away so we see
[1:27:41] here what we can see by this verse we
[1:27:44] can see that by Jesus's order he put
[1:27:46] them in that boat he put them in this
[1:27:49] boat and he knew where that boat was
[1:27:51] headed he knew the storm that it was
[1:27:53] headed towards verse 23 says and when he
[1:27:55] had sent the multitudes away he went up
[1:27:58] into a mountain apart to pray and when
[1:28:00] the evening was come he was there
[1:28:03] alone but the ship was now in the midst
[1:28:06] of the sea tossed with the waves for the
[1:28:09] wind was contrary you know in Mark 6
[1:28:11] when it's telling it in mark it says
[1:28:14] that from the mountain Jesus saw them
[1:28:17] toiling and now saw them toiling I I
[1:28:20] don't I don't know if it means Jesus saw
[1:28:22] them physically toiling I don't beli so
[1:28:24] but Jesus knew what they were going
[1:28:26] through he didn't have to be there to
[1:28:28] know what they were going through you
[1:28:30] know we find earlier in the Book of
[1:28:31] Matthew in chapter 8 where the Tempest
[1:28:34] arose in the sea they had been through
[1:28:35] this before they had seen this happen
[1:28:38] chapter eight in Matthew we're here in
[1:28:39] chapter 14 in Matthew that Tempest in
[1:28:42] the sea came up but Jesus was on the
[1:28:44] boat them so they had it as the
[1:28:47] disciples were seeing it right now for
[1:28:50] them Jesus is far off he's Out Of Reach
[1:28:52] he's out of touch what are we going to
[1:28:54] do because before we could go and we
[1:28:56] could shake him we could wake him up we
[1:28:58] could get him to move for us we could
[1:29:00] physically wake him up but here in this
[1:29:02] scripture they know Jesus is on land
[1:29:05] they know Jesus isn't there
[1:29:10] presently and in the Fourth Watch of the
[1:29:12] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[1:29:15] the sea now the Fourth Watch that's the
[1:29:17] last watch of the night that's 3:00 a.m.
[1:29:19] to 6:00 a.m. that's right before morning
[1:29:22] comes that's right before the sun
[1:29:24] Rises and so it goes forward it says in
[1:29:27] the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went
[1:29:29] unto them walking on the sea and it
[1:29:30] makes me wonder if they had question how
[1:29:32] this same Jesus that had just fed 5,000
[1:29:35] that they saw do this great miracle how
[1:29:37] did this same Jesus put me in a boat and
[1:29:40] send me into a storm I just saw him work
[1:29:43] this great miracle and you're telling me
[1:29:46] that man put me into this boat and push
[1:29:49] me towards a storm did he know this was
[1:29:52] going to happen and that Third Watch it
[1:29:54] must have been pretty tough that Third
[1:29:57] Watch the one right before the fourth
[1:29:59] that must have been pretty tough to go
[1:30:01] through you had to have some Faith to
[1:30:03] stick it out that long you had to be a
[1:30:05] real disciple of Christ to stick it out
[1:30:07] that long to wait on the Lord to believe
[1:30:11] that he's going to move on the scene and
[1:30:13] sometimes the Lord he waits in our lives
[1:30:15] until the Fourth Watch before he moves
[1:30:18] he'll wait he wants to see what you're
[1:30:19] going to do in the first the second he
[1:30:22] wants to watch you toil all night long
[1:30:24] and see what you're going to do he wants
[1:30:27] to see that reaction the prophet says in
[1:30:29] separation from unbelief sometimes it's
[1:30:32] just when the darkest time comes along
[1:30:34] in your life God gives you a little
[1:30:36] trial to see if you really do believe it
[1:30:39] when he really makes the thing known to
[1:30:42] you another spot the resurrection of
[1:30:44] Lazarus he says may be your darkest hour
[1:30:47] don't worry Jesus will be along it may
[1:30:50] be your darkest hour sister may be your
[1:30:52] sister may be yours brother
[1:30:54] but don't worry Jesus will come along
[1:30:58] he's always there just in the darkest of
[1:31:02] hours we pick up verse 26 right there
[1:31:05] says and when the disciples saw him
[1:31:07] walking on the sea they were troubled
[1:31:09] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[1:31:12] for fear they had a hard time
[1:31:13] recognizing their Victory come forth
[1:31:16] they had a hard time recognizing the
[1:31:18] Lord moving in their lives right then
[1:31:20] says but straight away Jesus spake unto
[1:31:22] them saying be of good cheer here it is
[1:31:24] I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him
[1:31:27] and said Lord if it be thou bid me come
[1:31:30] unto thee on the water and he said come
[1:31:33] and when Peter was come down out of the
[1:31:35] ship and he walked on the water to go to
[1:31:37] Jesus but when he saw the wind bous he
[1:31:41] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[1:31:43] cried saying Lord save me so they he had
[1:31:47] waited on the Lord through every watch
[1:31:50] it was a miracle in itself that the that
[1:31:52] boat had held together till the watch he
[1:31:55] had waited through every watch on the
[1:31:57] Lord and just think the Lord lets him
[1:32:00] come out and lets him take a few steps
[1:32:02] on that water but just the same as today
[1:32:05] Peter started looking around he started
[1:32:08] looking at what was still
[1:32:09] wrong and all that did to his faith was
[1:32:12] drive it down all that did to his doubt
[1:32:14] was drive it
[1:32:16] up he started looking around we don't
[1:32:18] have to look at anything but what this
[1:32:20] scripture says we don't have to look at
[1:32:22] anything but what this word says about
[1:32:23] about us about our lives about the
[1:32:26] healing in our body about the healing in
[1:32:27] our mind about a calling about a purpose
[1:32:31] we don't have to look to anyone else's
[1:32:33] opinion but God's
[1:32:34] opinion says and immediately Jesus
[1:32:36] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[1:32:39] and said unto him oh thou of little
[1:32:40] faith wherefore D thou doubt and when
[1:32:43] they were coming to the ship the wind
[1:32:45] ceased then they that were in the ship
[1:32:47] came and worshiped him saying oh the
[1:32:50] truth Thou Art the son of God
[1:32:55] and as musicians come i' just like to
[1:32:57] read another quote and this
[1:33:01] one I I was listening and I ran across
[1:33:03] it about a month ago I I never noticed
[1:33:05] it before but it it's really blessed me
[1:33:08] it's really helped with a lot of thing
[1:33:10] you know helped with patience helped
[1:33:11] with understanding why we have to go
[1:33:14] through what we go through why do we
[1:33:16] have to do it and this this quote really
[1:33:19] fills that
[1:33:21] out it's the it's exposition of the
[1:33:24] seven Church ages the sman church age it
[1:33:27] says in plain language the very
[1:33:29] character of Jesus was perfected by
[1:33:33] suffering and according to Paul he has
[1:33:36] left his church a measure of suffering
[1:33:38] that they too by their faith in God
[1:33:41] while suffering for him would come to a
[1:33:44] place of
[1:33:45] perfection why did he want this James
[1:33:49] 1 veres 2-4 my brethren count it all joy
[1:33:53] when you fall into into diverse
[1:33:54] Temptations knowing this at the trying
[1:33:56] of your faith worketh patience but let
[1:34:00] patience have her perfect work don't
[1:34:02] interrupt patience working in your life
[1:34:04] it's going to get hard it's going to get
[1:34:05] tight but let it have its perfect work
[1:34:09] in your life that ye may be perfect and
[1:34:12] entire wanting nothing why does he stand
[1:34:15] by it says the reason is in Romans 8:
[1:34:19] 17-8 and if children then Hees heirs of
[1:34:24] God and Joint HS with Christ if so be
[1:34:27] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:34:30] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:34:34] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:34:36] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:34:39] glory which shall be revealed in US
[1:34:42] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:34:45] reign with him you have to suffer to
[1:34:48] rain your patience has to be tested to
[1:34:51] rain you have to wait on the Lord a
[1:34:54] little bit to rain if you want Power you
[1:34:57] got to wait on the Lord sometimes if you
[1:35:00] want him to move in your
[1:35:02] life the requirement is you wait on him
[1:35:06] sometimes he goes on he says you have to
[1:35:08] suffer to rain the reason for this is
[1:35:11] that character simply is never made
[1:35:14] without
[1:35:15] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:35:19] gift think about that character is a
[1:35:21] victory not a gift
[1:35:24] that character and molding that
[1:35:25] character into you it's not just going
[1:35:27] to be dropped down one day it's going to
[1:35:29] be a life full of Trials a life full of
[1:35:32] test a life full of you being pushed to
[1:35:35] the absolute Max and not breaking and
[1:35:38] waiting on the Lord to move says a man
[1:35:41] without character can't Reign because
[1:35:43] power apart from character is satanic
[1:35:45] but Power with character is fit to
[1:35:49] rule and since he wants us to share even
[1:35:52] his throne on the same basis that he
[1:35:54] overcame and is sat down in his father's
[1:35:57] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[1:35:59] with him and the little temporary
[1:36:02] suffering we go through now is not
[1:36:04] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:36:06] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:36:08] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[1:36:12] for those who are willing to enter into
[1:36:14] his kingdom through much tribulation
[1:36:17] said think it not strange concerning the
[1:36:19] fiery trials that are to try you that is
[1:36:22] what Peter said is it strange that God
[1:36:24] wants us to develop to develop a
[1:36:27] Christlike character that comes through
[1:36:28] suffering no sir and we all have trials
[1:36:33] we are all tried and chastened as
[1:36:36] Sons not one but goes through that
[1:36:40] listen to what it says about the church
[1:36:41] this is something that we can
[1:36:43] all maybe rally around maybe all when we
[1:36:46] feel like we're being attacked as a
[1:36:47] church we feel like maybe it's hard to
[1:36:50] find a building something like that
[1:36:52] listen to what he says right here the
[1:36:54] church that is not suffering and is not
[1:36:56] being tried hasn't got it it isn't of
[1:37:00] God the church that is not suffering is
[1:37:03] not being tried hasn't got it it isn't
[1:37:06] of
[1:37:07] God Amen that quote it just makes it a
[1:37:10] little bit easier to walk this walk it

[1:49:45] what what brother Josh repeated there at

[1:49:49] Lydia
[1:49:51] no Timothy ver Timothy no
[1:49:57] suffering suffering who had to suffer we
[1:49:59] talked about that in detail this morning
[1:50:02] um in the Sunday School who had to
[1:50:05] suffer the very Lord Jesus had to suffer
[1:50:09] he was perfected it said that's just
