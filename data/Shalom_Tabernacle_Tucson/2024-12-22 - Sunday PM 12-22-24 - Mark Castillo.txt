eternality father that we commit ourselves into your hands in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen [Music] May [Music] [Laughter] in your go free [Music] [Music] amen I once was lost but now I'm found sir amen I have a reason to be happy this evening was lost but now I've been found and now that I've been found I know where I'm going and I'm getting ready to go where I came from because we come from eternity amen and we're going back to Eternity can you imagine living forever yes don't have to show up to work on Monday because there will be no Mondays up there every day will be Jesus day and you know what's the great about it is that there will be no electric lights up there no electric posts up there because Jesus will be the light up there amen what a what a beautiful thing that we we have waiting for us up ahead amen God bless you once again welcome to the house of the Lord I trust you rested I trust you had a good lunch I know I did and it made it a little bit sleepy but that's the the curse of the Mexican food has it puts you to sleep that's why I like eating some chili so can keep me awake but we're glad to be back here once again uh thank you for your patience and for your prayers and if you'll open your Bible with me to the Book of Job 4 and: 17 we're going to read one verse from there and then we're going to jump to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and then verse 53 and 54 the these are scriptures that are very well known we've been hearing them for for years just like we've been hearing for years Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created and it goes back to the question why did God create in the beginning because we were on his mind amen you want something for us you know when you're a father and you have children you do all you can for your children whether they deserve it or not we even threaten them you're not getting nothing you're being bad go to your room and then they go to the room we're thinking like man I should have given him his gift you know love my boy I I have that problem with my grandkids right now sometimes I got to give him timeout you're on timeout for how long for five minutes sit down oh why because you're not listening to me I'll listen next time no wait till your time's up and then when the time's up they getting a f fight again another five minutes and I tell you guys don't deserve no more toys from Grandpa but that's a lie because Grandpa got a bunch of toys for and I get SCH why you buying more toys I go because I love them and if if if I can feel like that towards my grandkids what does God feel towards us think about that because his love is greater amen he has so much to give to us the Bible says if you have not it's because you ask not and if you don't ask it's because you don't believe amen you want something from the Lord ask for it believe it but for heaven's Sak be grateful for what you get when he gives it to you Amen in the Book of Job chap 4:1 17 and it reads shall mortal man be more just than God it's a question that's been asked shall mortal man be more just than God shall a man be more pure than his maker and I think it's a good question to ask because a lot of times we think we're somebody you know by me a nice $4,000 suit and I'm somebody nice Gucci shoes not that I ever buy those shoes I get M get Walmart or Coal's but we we think we're somebody but the question is are you really somebody without the Lord amen and then let's jump to 1 Corinthians chapter 15:53 a very well-known scripture 1 Corinthians 1553 and it reads for this corruption must put on incorruption what are we right now corruption I don't care how much vegetables you eat and try to stay young how much lotion you put on that Jurgens you know Reviving skin lies you're still corruption you're still going to die church I know that sounds like bad news but wake up we're dying church because this corruption must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when the corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory can I get an amen Church death is swallowed up in Victory one more scripture Ephesians chapter 4 verse 4 when when when I when I when I speak of the church I have a a tendency to keep the church standing for a while and it's it's it's not on on purpose but my dad used to sco me say boy read your scripture and sit the people down they get tired too you know I go Dad I go I got to stop the whole sermon I ain't complaining well read your scripture sit them down so let's read this and you can sit down real quick Ephesians 4 verse4 and it reads there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given a Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he sath when I when he ascended unto on high he let captivity captivity cap and gave gifts unto men amen Heavenly Father your word is blessed thank you Lord for your word father a a soul that is that is weary Lord that feels maybe heavy laden from the PRS of the life father when he picks up your word and he reads it he can find comfort in your word to know that this was written way before he even came to the Earth and it Comforts us father it stir our souls Lord as your word should stir our souls this evening father we commit ourselves into your hands Lord in this Church in this service and we give you all the honor and the glory in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you now you may be seated I believe that one of the greatest gifts that man has is to be able to pick free choice uh the prophet calls it free moral agency that means that that you as a human being can pick whatever you want you could have picked to stay home this evening and say you know brother castil tired me out in the morning I'm going to rest it out for the evening that's your choice and and not I'm not going to condemn you for that because that's your choice you do whatever you want amen uh I I I uh when I took over the pastorship my father was one who never liked preaching about ties and offering because he felt if I preach about ties the people are going to think I want your money but since I was a pastor I preached about ties because I never got nothing anyways I had my own job so I preached about it because to me I believe that paying tithe is important I'm not sure why I'm going down this road but tithing is important and so when I became the pastor you know I kept on preaching ties and offering because to me the church runs on the offerings of the people we we are not funded by the government I mean the church didn't get us stimulus check but you all did and I ask the Church of you all you that God has stimulat checks how many of you paid tithings from that please don't raise your hand because it's a blessing from the Lord yes it's the devil's money hello this the devil's world but who doesn't need money nowadays and there's nothing wrong with money it's the love of money and so I I I've tried to instill in our church that it's okay to give offerings because we can go to Walmart and spend 250 on stuff that's on sale and then we come to church and we got $5 bill and a 20 and we'll put the five oh how do I know I see it I'm on the P I see people put offering there I see some that don't put it they have a good job and they don't put offering and the ones that that are barely making it like the elderly women give all they can give to the Lord I at women that have been there for years elderly women faithful with their tithings amen it's because they they they have a revelation and they choose because they love the Lord and so they express with their actions that they love the Lord because those that don't pay tithings are considered what thieves before the eyes of God when when my dad was a pastor he he would tell me his assistant son I want you to go check all the men all the musicians and find out who's paying tithe and who's not and the ones that aren't sit him down and I'm thinking wait wait I'm not the pastor I'm the assistant pastor but that was my job you know what I wasn't very popular amongst the N amongst the non tithing musicians why because they had to sit down why am I sitting down brother you know already the Bible says and then the pastor says brother says that you can't pay you got to sit down well want to catch up but when you do you can play right now you got to sit down and they didn't like me for that but you know that was a choice we have we we can either give or not give we can come to church and we can praise or not praise right right that's your choice you know that that but you'll have to answer for it one day you can choose to go to work or not go to work that that's the beauty of of of a of a free moral agency we can choose amen but a child of God who has a fire in his soul that's L hungering for more of God his choice is always going to be to want more of God he's always going to want to be more in the presence of God to me the most beautiful presence is to be in the presence of God to feel the anointing church because that tells me that that when I can feel his anointing I'm a nobody brother they they say that real men don't cry that's a big lie I have I have no problem crying when the Lord touches me if it offend you that's your problem you know if I want to cry in the presence of the Lord I'm going to cry you know Jesus cried because they rejected him we should be crying because he accepted us gave us Hope G gave us freedom gave us the opportunity to to hear this message you know when we first came into the message there there was a burning in the in the air of excitement because they had received a message when I when I was young I remember that that the church had so much Unity you'd go from place to place and they were always on fire they were always talking about the prophet that was the topic of the conversation the Prophet this oh you what the prophet said oh wow what the prophet said and people were on fire you know because the message had come to the ears it had stirred their souls it was something to make a noise about church but you know as the years passed by okay that that that that joy that that fire it it dwindled you know it it's still there I'm not saying it's it's still there but it's is not burning like it should be burning in our souls because the more that we are in this message the more that we're serving the lord should we be that much closer to him that's right should there be a change in our lives you know should there be a joy you know sometimes we should we should be coming to church with a little kicking us because we're happy to be in the house of God instead of coming to church dragging our feet making dust CU I I see I I see people when when they come to church cuz I see on the pulpit when they come in and I watch them come in I'm thinking huh wonder what happened to him he ain't smiling one day I told the church you know as a pastor I know all your problems I know what you're going through I know what you're going through I know what you what you're going through I know what you're all going through you all got problems including me but if you're serving the lord should those problems be to a side at least for two hours right can can we give the Lord at least two hours of our time you know instead of dragging a the house rents due tomorrow oh and we're trying to figure out how to solve it during church while God's preaching his word but that's your choice if I want to think about my home and I come to church that's my choice I'll do it but a child of God when he's on fire for the Lord he'll put those things to his side and he'll focus on the Lord and he'll realize hey when I get to the end of my journey I Want to Be Right amen I want my ticket now I don't want to be scrambling last minut trying to buy a ticket to Cross Jordan I want my ticket right now Church and so he strives to get close to God are we perfect no sir we're not perfect we make mistakes like I said this morning even brother Bram said that many times I Tred upon God's grace you know because we we're human beings church we we make mistakes we get sleepy in church I know that because I see them I tell people the most safest place in the world is in the church because we come in here there's a beautiful sweet anointing the music compl and we close our eyes Oh Glory to God this feels like heaven heaven nobody's going to rob us here going past the offering it's not a robbing it's a blessing yes and we should be you know safe here in the house of God and not wondering when are they going to quit good grief I got things to do you know Sunday is the day of the Lord amen yes I remember growing up we we used to have morning Sunday school from 10: to 1200 and then we had prayer from 1 to 3: in the church and then evening service from 5: to 7: all day long in church so much religion there me always in church you my friends will tell me bro you're always in church but you're you're so religious and I'm thinking I ain't religious that's just that's my life amen that's what I live for you know I like being in the house of the Lord I like to be here I like to hear somebody else preach because this is the best place to to be this is the time to reflect on your soul to reflect on your spirit and your life it's the time to to reflect on the song that are being sung that have been inspired by men of old to to write amazing graad or at the cross at the cross or I first saw the light there's a song in Spanish called f Fountain of Mercy oh brother I have found that Fountain of Mercy when I didn't deserve it God led me to that Fountain and I can come every day with my cup and I can I can draw from that Fountain of mercy and live a life that's pleasing before the Lord and I tell the lord lord I can't do it by myself sir if you don't help me I'm going to be lost I I need you father every day I need you amen you know my dad said m whatever you do in life always put God first when you're looking for a job put God first ask the Lord if it's your will give me the job if it's not it's not your will yes every time that I I went to seek for a job I would tell my dad dad I'm going for a job here over there but there's a downside to it Dad if I get it I got to travel 101 miles to get there that sound like a good move to make and then I said and then once I get the job dad I'm going to be on call for two weeks I'm going to miss church for two weeks what do you think Dad I was putting all the weight on him and he's a pastor of the church he goes well Miko if it's the will of the Lord you'll get it if it's not you won't get it h so I prayed about it I said Lord I I I I would love to have that job not that I need it but I would love to have it Lord if it's your will open the door well I went to my job interview with a nice suit tie you know look at professional did really good and after interview they called me Mr Castile we're sorry about you didn't get the job you know I had a choice to get angry but I just kept call well Lord I guess it wasn't your will you know drove back 100 miles back to my house two weeks later he called me hey Mr Castillo the guy that we offered the job to he quit on the day he started putting for it again I said Woo praise the Lord so I put him for it again said dad did this happen this happened he goes Mi put him for it if it's the Lord's will you get it I put him forth and I got it and it bugged me it really did to miss church now for some people they love to you know oh we need help on Sunday I'll go the pastor will understand God will understand I hate it working on Sundays but you know I I I did it for a few months and then the Lord opened the door never had to work on Sunday again after that amen I said Lord thank you because you're you're good in your mercy and and because you're you're you're good to me and and and I thank God that we we can make those choices in life you have the choice to to pick whatever wife you you want you you want to know what kind of wife you have look at the mother talking about the swas now if it's a good mother-in-law it's going to be a good daughter my mother-in-law when she came into the message she testified to a lot of people about this message like wow what what a woman ain't afraid to to to show other or give others you know that God sent a prophet in this last hour to these days she's still alive still serving the lord but it's one of the greatest gifts that we have is to be able to pick in life amen sometimes the choices that we make there's a price attached to it whether it's a good choice or a bad choice you know growing up in the house of a of a pastor uh we we're know we're known as PKS Pastor kids and PKS are not perfect but we live in the glass house and we were used as the example in the church and you know I was still home at 21 22 I'm still living at home because my dad told me Mi as long as you abide by my rules you can live in my house you you you you got to be home by 10:00 every night I don't care how old you are those are my rules in my house and if you don't like it there's the door me right there go find you a house somewhere else you think I lived no way free rent food was cooked my mama washed my clothes who's going to want to leave the house and and one day my dad he he went to visit some church members about an hour away from the house and said M we're going to go visit brother so and so let's go I said dad I don't feel like going why not well I just want to stay home he said okay you stay home now when he says you stay that means not leave your house it means stay home but as a young man that had other plans as soon as my dad leaves I'm leaving too I just bought a brand new Mustang that the lord gave me yes that's right praise the Lord he gave you a new Mustang you know nice two-tone electric windows you know I was I was looking really really cool in that Mustang you know pastor's kid nice cool car you know Shiny Bright rims and my thought was when my dad leaves I'll go to Pizza Hut with some of my friends and we'll have a good time nothing crazy and before my dad gets home I'll get back home cuz my dad used to love to fellowship once you got talking about brother brandom hours passed by and I'm calculating okay hour to get there talk for 2 hours 3 hours maybe four come back I got six hours to I'm good I took off soon as he left I took off went to Pizza Hut hung with my friends drank Pepsi ate pizza I looked at my clock I'm like it was about 10:30 I'm like you know what I probably should be getting home by now I told him I got to get home why um I'm getting tired right now I'm a little tired right now liar I was 22 still being control by my daddy my house boy you don't like it there's a door I get home brother happy you know I'm I'm I'm doing good and I realize that there's a light on in the living room I'm like I know I didn't leave that on and I creeped in with my car and turned off the lights and just Coast it down and stopped got off and walked inside and there's my dad sitting on his chair he was already in his pajamas bro you talk about the fear of the Lord I was so scared of my father because he he was a serious man yes he told my mother babes when we get married I want to know right now that I've given my heart to the Lord and he is all for me he's number one in my life when I walked in I'm like oh Jesus save me again I I he he looked at me he said he said sit on right there I sat down my knees were trembling but you couldn't tell but they were trembling and he says uh where were you I said well I I I went to to pizza with some friends and we're just eating pizza dad and drinking Coke he goes did I not tell you to stay home I said yes sir why did you leave I don't know that's always like I don't know he says you know son you're you're told to get whooped I was about 22 20 years you're told to get whooped he goes but you know what give me the keys to your car you're walking to work for two weeks I don't want to see see you riding with nobody I don't want to see you to to asking for a ride you will walk from my house to your job for two weeks brother you talk about being humbled walking to work you when my clothes you know and Friends hey bro you need a ride no I'm good thank you g some exercises you know cuz I didn't want to tell what happened to my car it's embarrassing and for two weeks I walked to work back home I look back now that my father's gone and and I wish that I could hug him and say Dad thank you for being strict with me thank you for standing on the word thank you for in your house you applying the token yes and not giving me a break and say no he's my son no he he applied the token and we paid a price and we might have thought that was mean to us but he wasn't mean he loved us amen like sometimes we think God is punishing me no God loves you church but sometimes the choices that we make got to pay a price for it amen you know I heard a brother say all I want to hear when I get to heaven is those words from my father that says Son Well Done well would that be awesome that you know all the struggles in life and brother when you finally get there that Jesus will tell you Son Well Done enter to the joy of your lord I like what brother brandham says I like to read quotes from brother Brandon because that's that's the only place I can pull them from is from brother Brandon the message so one day somebody criticized me mother Castillo you sure read a lot of quotes brother like brother I go where am I supposed to get my message from if I don't read quotes that's why God sent the prophet so we can quote to us what he said cuz sometimes we forget what he says and we need to be reminded of what he said you know uh uh we we we I preach to the church you about all these things you know and sometimes they say Amen sometimes they don't and one day a minister came and preached the same thing and the people were like wow am man and man glory to God and they're like brother that was awesome I go I know it was cuz I preached the same thing last week and nobody said nothing why you don't pay attention in church that's why it's good sometimes to have a visiting minister to come and remind you what your pastors already said anyways this is what the prophet says he says in the message early spiritual experiences preached in 1952 he says I've never been ashamed and God helped me to always be man enough okay to stand up and speak my convictions you know at work not that I'm religious but people knew who I was at work and when they would start to say a dirty joke they would stop and they say oh sorry bro I didn't mean to say it I never complained I never said hey hey I'm religious I don't want to hear those things never they knew already who I was and they respected me for that and brother BR says I'm not afraid to speak my convictions if I'm not I'd be a traitor to Christ a traitor I believe in the old-fashioned baptizing of the Holy Ghost I believe that a man's got to be born again or he's still a sinner you know a lot of times today we don't speak about being boring enough we try to speak about the Mysteries and there nothing wrong with the Mysteries we need those there's nothing wrong with the Seven Seals we need that but what good does it have to have all this knowledge of the Seven Seals and be able to quote all the message if we still haven't been Born Again Church the most important thing that we've got to be born again it's the choice you have you know whether you want it or not that's up to you I believe that a man's got to be born again or he's still a sinner I believe it's only through the grace of God that he's called of the Holy Ghost we do not receive the Holy Ghost by faith believing it's the free gift of God given to us by God's grace that's where I different with my own church the church that I come from the Baptist Church they said you said you receive the Holy Ghost when you believe I said that's contrary to the Bible amen Paul said in Acts 19 he asked those Baptist up there that was following a PA us he said have you received the Holy Ghost since ye believed not when you believe but since you have believed you believe First and the Holy Ghost is the gift of God see it comes to you there is one Spirit as you read in the verse one Spirit one Lord one baptism uh one one day I ran to some friends at a restaurant and they were catholic friends and she she happened to mention in front of her husband she goes you know I'm not very happy with the church right now I go what's wrong she goes well she goes I don't believe that I should have to confess to a man I'm like well praise the Lord neither do I I go as a matter of fact I told you the Bible says that there's only only one interceded between God and man and that is Jesus Christ that is who we confess our sins to and she said I like that I go what's in the word of God he said it and then you invite him to church oh we want to go we want to go but they never show up no what can you do baham says the body of Christ Jesus Christ is not an organization the body of Jesus Christ is a mystical body it is a body of in the Kingdom that's a spiritual Kingdom that's set upon the Earth by Jesus Christ who is the king of that Kingdom the high priest to offer sacrifices for the warfaring in his kingdom he's a prophet he's the word that preaches the truth that brings the light of God in this Kingdom and he is both Prophet priest and King in this Kingdom and how do we get into this Kingdom by the denomination by a letter by hand shaking by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and were baptized in there not by not by sprinkling not by pouring not by any kind of of of water baptism but by one Spirit the Holy Spirit we're all baptized into that body 1 Corinthians 12 yes we are baptized into this body by one Spirit the Holy Spirit then we're then we're don't belong to anything but Christ you are Christ you belong to him it's the mystical kingdom of God that's set up that we come into it by Holy Spirit baptism and brother Bram says at the end I love that he says you know when something's good you say that's good that's right and B says oh I just love that look at the importance Church of having to know what we're talking about and knowing god and his word and being able to take God at his word how important it is for the church to know their message know your scripture uh we've had ministers that have come to our church to preach before in the past that come out with some weird things and I had to interpret for some of them and I am so glad that when he says that nobody says amen I'm thinking yeah someone's being paying attention to this church cuz if someone would have said amen I would have gone who said amen that but they they they know that there script because we we've instilled into them you better know your message you better know where you're standing you better know who Jesus is because it's not an intellectual Faith it's a revelation amen but look at the the importance of of having a strong Foundation of having a sound Doctrine I'm I'm going to tell you a story but I don't want nobody to say Amen just listen to my story okay just just listen to it what if one day I have a vision how many believe in Visions dreams I believe dreams are very spiritual I love to have a spiritual dream I've had spiritual dreams where in the dream itself I feel anointed I feel good and I wake up happy because I I I I played the piano in the dream inspired I was awesome I don't know how to play it but in the dream I sounded really good it was inspired not thought why that that was that was an inspired dream I sang a song that I never sang before it was inspired and I wake up wow that's beautiful that even in my dream God blesses me you don't have to but he does and what if I told that I had a vision and in this Vision I saw Jesus Christ standing before me in all his glory with his crown and angels all around him and he tells me me my son my son I have a job for you to do I want you to go over there and I want you to preach my my word I want to go and preach over here I want you to do this over there I want you to do that over there and do it for the honor and glory and and I feel so anointed I can feel the presence of God that the hairs of my arms are sticking up like wow this is awesome because you know the presence of God if unless you're dead you'll recognize it that's right is it possible to not feel the presence of God God even if you're back sliding you can still feel it because the rain falls in the just and the unjust am even the devil trembles at the sound of the name of Jesus you imagine that's how powerful Jesus is and what if I told you this dream was so awesome and I could hear all the angels singing and all the glory and I like wow what a beautiful dream Church how how many believe it everybody would say Amen beautiful it's a dream but if you know your scripture you know there's something wrong with the dream look what brother brandham says he says I believe that the church today only in this Condition it's only a place that God's bringing the church that when it all breaks what a time of rejoicing when the redeemed shall stand one day to Crown Jesus that's right yes sir you know many people that don't read their Bible if Jesus was to appear to them in the crown they'd probably believe it but if you're a Son of God you know wait a minute why is he wearing a crown we haven't crowned him yet and he says will crown him king of King and Lord of lords when he's seting on Mount Zion and all around the earth is circled with the Redeeming the redeemed singing of redemption the angels will stand a far off with their heads bowed yes these are angels that have never known sin that have never know what what it is to be redeemed but they'll be to a side where their heads bowed you know I can only imagine what heaven would be like church for Satan to want the glory that God had he wanted that Glory as well what did he do he took two-thirds of the angel trying to seek That Glory that he saw there because it's so awesome what what what it is to be in the presence of God brother if just feeling his presence here is glorious what will it be when we stand before him and we crown him King of Kings yes brother there won't be a dry eye there there won't be a shut mouth there we'll all be praising in his name I qu I can't understand why we can't do it here on Earth I said I had a bad day and is that God's fault I got pulled over speeding is that God's fault that's your fault and he says when he sitting on Mount Zion and all around the earth is circled with the redeemed singing of redemption the angels will stand off on the sideline with their heads bowed they won't understand he says they've never been redeemed they never fa to be redeemed only we Mortals know what it meant to be lost an angel doesn't know what it means to be lost and we are the only ones that can get joy out of singing the song of redemption and I think that's the way it'll be in the church now the question is what is Immortal one day I told the church I'm going to give you a definition of what a Jew is but don't get shook up it's a very deep Revelation what is a Jew a Jew is someone who's not a gentile and they're like wow that's pretty deep that's deep what what is a mortal what does mortal mean the definition of mortal is something that's likely to cause death oh how scary death you know the man you were born you're dying you know when when we're young we don't think about death because we're strong we can get up we can run we have a good memory we don't need glasses we don't need hearing aades we don't even need benay we're we're strong you know but the time passes by we you know start to squint you know in class what's wrong I'm going blind can't hear well some of us have selective hearing but hearing lost you know and then we get you know get to a place where we we can't move everything hurts why we're dying Church we're dying every day we're dying you know and my my my family always tell me dad you don't need enough vegetables I go Mi I am up to here with vegetables give me something that like gardet with with green chili or something give me some good tortilla something but vegetables they're killing me mortal is someone that's likely to cause death or someone that has the ability to die every one of us as Mortals has the ability to die and we will die one day sooner or later some of us will still be around when the coming of the Lord comes and we'll see him will be alive to to greet him but others will be called from the dead if you're a child of God and your name is called brother you'll rais from the dead to be in the Rapture I don't care if they they they sprinkle Dr I'll cross Hawaii when your name is called I will be there amen that's the that's the promise that we have if our creator if our founder rose from the dead how much more will these children not raised from the dead also who have Christ Living in them who've been born again if you refer to the fact that people are mortal you mean that they only have to die and cannot live forever this is man's definition that you cannot live forever as a mortal man is deliberately designed to be mortal he grows he ages and then he dies a moral which is us we are driven by desires and feelings we have five senses and those senses tells when we're sick it hurts and when we hear the word of God that says your faith can heal you we say Amen to that but then our body tells us but I still feel the pain it hurts it's like a headache when I rebuke a headache I say devil you're a liar you know what happens the headache gets more intense and I'm thinking wait a minute I just said the name of Jesus what's going on here well the devil has a job and that's to discourage you but if you stand on the word of God that discourages the Devil Immortal is d by desires and feelings you know we choose whatever we want one day I was working in my shop and I got the craving for a Big Mac now McDonald's is about 8 miles from my house what did I have to do I had to shut down the shop jump in my truck and drive eight miles to McDonald's because I was craving that because this Mortal wanted a Big Mac and nothing was going to stop me now Big Macs are not good for you they're they're they're hazardous to Health but I was craving one so I drove 8 miles to McDonald's I was happy W I'm going to have a McDonald's I pulled up get my hamburger and I ate it in the parking lot cuz I don't like cold McDonald's I sat there I prayed for my food yes I prayed for my food I said thank you Jesus for this Big Mac for this golden fries with cold Coke thank you Jesus and I ate it and I was happy wrapped on my trash went in the trash D my truck went back home8 8 Miles back to the house thought to myself wow I that's choice I can do whatever I want if I'm hungry I'll I'll I'll satisfy my hung my physical hungry but but but then I begin to wonder why is it so difficult for the spiritual man to be the same way too because you don't have to drive eight miles you just got to Fall on Your Knees you got to say Lord I'm hungry amen for more of you I need you every day I I I can't live with without you have you ever been to a part where you can't live without somebody you know what blows me away is that when we first fall in love amen let's go down memory lane young men when you first fall in love there's nothing that can separate us from going to see our girlfriend at their house nothing if I got to work late I'll get up ready say go see her and always buying her flowers and there's that first love you know back back in my day we didn't have cell phones so I would stop at my wife's house and I would leave a note you know there on the windshield good morning love you see you later that was my cell phone piece of paper we we nothing stop us from that but as we got older the flower stopped hello and now you only get them on your birthday and Valentine's that's it you know why cuz they're expensive we have to watch our costs we're on the budget and you're only going to get flowers and I can't afford a teddy bear just the flowers only and the chocolates well there's a bag of Oreos in the in the in the cabinet over there we we we change we we we we we we put Li I I don't mean to be funny but that's the truth you know my my my my daughter tells me dad you're not romantic anymore with mom anymore I'm like a romantic girl and we forget about those things because after a while it becomes so common then we find excuses yeah and and and and those desires of Mortals they die away after a while they they become so common just like when you first gave your heart to the Lord you know I remember gave my heart to the Lord I was a young man I got baptized on Super Bowl day when the when the the Broncos played the Cowboys and the Broncos lost to the Cowboys I didn't care even though I like the Broncos you know I like the horse it's a beautiful horse and I didn't care why I had gotten baptized there was joy in my heart you know there was days that that would be in my house you know and we only had one bathroom and five of us living in one house and I wanted to cry out to God I want to just cry and I would go to the bathroom and I'd close the door and I'd get on the ground I'd be to cry I was so happy because God had G me another chance and I felt the joy of the Lord I said wow what a great feeling it's the greatest feeling in the world to to give your heart to the Lord and live for him and be in love with him maybe knock on the door hey are you almost done almost and go back to praying again and crying because I want to be alone I just want to cry to God because I I was so in love with him I was still single didn't have no no wife no no children no responsib I was single and and you know when we're young we're dying to grow to grow older you know the young child are dying to be teenagers the teenagers are dying to get married and we were trying to advance life and I tell my children you know what enjoy your life when you're young don't be so so quick to grow up enjoy life when you're small you know enjoy it but that Joy with with with time it it begins to get squished out now you come to church and now you got a job now you got Mustang payment like four something a month plus Insurance gas oh my God and then then they got to repair and buy new tires and you come to church and and that joy that you once had for serving the lord it's being squashed by a Mustang hello you know when I first got my car I didn't like nobody eating in my car cuz I don't like the smell of burgers in my car I don't like to smell of any food in my car it had to be clean put your feet on the ground don't touching my Windows please don't be smudging just sit there buckle up and shut up but as the time pass by you allow somebody to bring a Coca-Cola you know Hamburg after a while after after months there's dried french fries under the seat nobody cares anymore about the car because you've lost that joy of the new car and it's it's just a car you know still paying for it but it's still a car and serving the lord it's like that sometimes oh my when you first come to the house when you first when we first got our church and and and and and I'm glad that you all got are getting a new church brother there's no place like having your own place respect it take pride in your church it's it's the house of the Lord when you dedicate it dedicate to the Lord that one day that you'll be truly blessed in your own place it's okay to live in another tent but you have you need to have your own tent instead God bless you for that take pride in your church it's your it's your home it's a place you've dedicated to the Lord this is is your place and and after a while when when when when that Joy begins to dwindle after a while church becomes chore when people complain why are we having church again you know that bugs me you know why why are we having convention to again it's a lot of work and I'm like good lordy what you complaining about did you ever see Jesus complaining when he was carrying the cross why they got to carry the cross for you in great I already know how what what you g to do I already know what you think I already know how you going to live why am I carrying the cross for you you're ungrateful not even his own disciples recognized who was walking in their midst and for three and a half years they walk with the Son of God the the the Creator the king of kings and they didn't realize why they didn't have a revelation they hadn't been born again and with time passes by that that Joy begins to get crushed after a while the same quote you heard 10 years ago now it's just a quote today right and it's not that the word of God has lost L its power God will never lose his power he'll never lose its value we're the ones that lose our sight of things we we we lose our hope we we let the devil crush it because that's the devil's job and he does a very good job Church there's no church persecution here you can come to church whenever you want you can pray whenever you want I told people in my church if you want to go pray in the church I'll go open it for you it's there for you to pray it that's your church we have prayer meeting on Mondays and tell you what you know who the faithful months are on Monday morning or Monday evening when it comes time for prayer meeting because praying is a job huh it's a job to to try to break that challenge to get try to get through but once you break through Oh What a Feeling Amen to feel the presence of God to cry out I don't care who's there if I'm going to cry you know snot coming out that's all right I'm I'm I'm In God's Presence I want to be there but sometimes we're afraid to know hide our tear I don't want to see me I'm crying we've lost that Joy Church it's time to reevaluate where we're at today it's time to reevaluate has God's word changed or have I changed or maybe I need to like David said Lord return to me the joy of my salvation bbam says he never lost it he never was lost he had just lost the joy he he forgot the value of serving the lord he he forgot the value of being in his presence but one day he recognized thank God for his grace that he reminds us Lord return to me the joy of my salvation Mortals that's us as Mortals to avoid danger we use our sight but if we ignore our sight we'll get into trouble everyone can see the Bible everyone can touch the bible everybody can read from the Bible but but if it's not a revelation it's just your senses touching a book with with ink on it and it's more nothing more than just a book to you but when it's real when it's when it's alive in you there's something that drives you that Mo motivates you amen glory to his name when you see somebody who's who's on fire for the Lord it inspires you to to to want to live for the Lord because they have an anointing that jumps on you those are the kind of anointings that we want in the church anointing from people that love the Lord we don't want no bad attitudes Church you get on with the bad and after you kick the poor dog what fault did he have he wasn't at work with you and after all that attitude it jumps on everybody and after a while everybody's in the bad mood at the house what happened I don't know Dad came home in a bad mood for what I don't know why you in a bad mood I don't know the spirit jumped in you that's why but we need God's spirit to jump on us in this hour and don't just jump for it to stay there church yes take it with you to work tomorrow morning when you go to work Mortals Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing of the word of God you know what God requires from us is a clean heart where we're living in a time where there's a lot of negativity going against the message of the hour against people that's the time to pray for them that God will help them and God be merciful to them because when they label one message believer they label all of us the same and we're not all the same church amen we're under the same message but we're not the same church God help us I I I I I was remembering a dream my father had there there's a town about maybe 30 some miles from our house it's called Hillsboro up in the mountains it's a beautiful drive to get there nice turns get to the top there it's a cute little town up there and it's called Hillsboro and my dad one day had a dream that in this dream he went to Hillsboro with my mother and one of his sisters uh that goes to our church and he he walks into a store and my dad was looking for a loaf of bread so he walks in gets his loaf of bread and he goes to the counter to pay for it but there's nobody at the counter so my dad begins to think and say well if they're not here I'll just take it now for my dad to say that in his dream he's pretty backslid cuz my dad never stole from anybody but in the dream as a mortal he said well if they're not here to to collect my money I'll just take it and he picked up the bread and was getting ready to walk out and one of his sisters banged the counter Hey where's everybody at and when she said that my dad dropped a loaf of bread on the ground he got scared he dropped to the ground and when he B to pick it up about that time the owner came to the front of the counter and says can I help you and my dad says yes I wanted to buy this bread would like to pay you for it so my Dad paid for the bread took his loaf of bread walked outside he said that when he got outside he stood there looking outside and he heard a voice that said for you to walk with me your heart has to be clean brother it was just a loaf of bread it's just a Lo of bread you know just nothing but our hearts have to be clean before the Lord and how is it clean I can't clean it myself church but he can I can't change my life but he can I I can't fill myself you know with false hope but he can give me true Hope Church he can guide my path he can he if he has to correct me correct me but Lord don't leave me walk with me Father be be with me whever I go watch over me you know sometimes when I'm driving I fall asleep why I'm Immortal hello I don't know how I got home many times I'd fall asleep and I'd wake up and I'm in the oncoming l beep beep beep thank you Jesus God's grace am one of the things worst I hate is getting pulled over by a cop for speeding Christians shouldn't speed Christians shouldn't lead her either but sometimes I've seen people throw trash out the window Believers are like get and we believe the message you know one day I got pulled for a speed and the C P I said Lord please Jesus please have mercy on me I won't do it again and the God's thinking you're a little liar I know you will but you know what he he he gave me Grace and the cop came and said Mr castill miss your license you know here's your registration do you know why I stopped him like uh yeah I was speeding so he goes to the computer and pulls out my name in the system you know I've got a clean record by the way used to work for the state of New Mexico and he comes back he says you used to work for the state go yes sir in safety department by the way well watch your speed next time I go yes sir thank you Jesus I'll never do it again guess what I got pulled over again in Lordsburg Liars we we we trample on God's grace that's right you know and I try to be you know I try to be very conscious that because I don't like tickets I work too hard for my money to give it to the cop really do 120 bucks for a ticket I have to work a couple hours for that you know a whole day for for that a a minimum wage and I try to be very C but sometimes as human beings we let them over slip us and we forget and then when we we in trouble there we are crying to Lord have mercy on me I love you I'll never do it again moso you liar Lord if you heal me I'll serve you better lies if you if you give me this I I'll live better to you my my thought was Lord give me a new car and and I'll be on church all time all the time lies God God God knows you he knows us already all right but look at his grace he still covers Us his blood is still there on the altar covering for us interceding for us you know when brother B talked about being at the cafe and he was condemning the waitress for being you know one of those worldly women is disgraceful woman he's condemning her and then b b him seeing you know where the world was and there was all these blood splatting against you know this world and all this big boom and all that and it was the sins and bbam thought those must be her sins but the Lord said no those are your sins and sometimes we're we're so quick to judge other people and and and and we point the finger to them and through them are pointing to us was they like that brother over there you know I tell people when people fall when people backslid I tell them pray for them don't condemn them pray pay for them that's right Faith cometh by the hearing and the hearing of the word and when we Mortals get that faith our senses will have nothing to do with that Faith you know we've been preaching for years about faith and Faith cometh by the hearing of the word 40 years hearing this message what kind of Faith should we have by now Church think about that the hour is getting late since man left the Garden of Eden he's had to walk by senses and not by faith and he's struggled for doing that but thank God that he's sent his son to show us the way Amen to to to press on in this life thank God for this message of the hour church amen whenever you feel discouraged whenever you feel you know that that life is is not fair to you and you don't understand things in life brother listen to the word of God and I guarantee you that in that word in that message somewhere God will be speaking to you giving you what you need amen What What In closing now one one one day I uh somebody was complaining that that I always go to the mission Fields y y always taking off and what about your church you know you're you're not here and like well you know the the the the call is great out there because people are hungering for the word of God and the ones that got it don't eat it amen so I it kind of bothered me you know and it's like you know I feel kind of bad and then one day I couldn't sleep so I put a tape of brother brandom on and I fell asleep of course God forgive me I fell asleep but you know and then I woke up and right when I woke woke up I heard brother bam said this he goes you know I have to really just praise my wife for the way she is I I I'm always taken off to the mission Fields you know and and and then when I come back I need a vacation for the mission Fields so I go a week up to the mountain and my wife never complains I thought wow why she recognized her place that she was standing by a prophet of God that he had a job to do and that was to preach the message to to to preach this message and to find the last one because this message will give you the faith for Rapture church I remember growing up there there was a rumor you needed a passport to go in the Rapture because we can all jump in the plane and go to Israel so we can be there on the mountain when the Rapture takes place and my dad was like you know I already got the I already got a passport it's called the Holy Spirit he said I don't need a physical passport I already got the Holy Spirit when my day comes I'll hear his name I'll go wherever I'm at I'll go in the Rapture church one day this Mortal will put on immortality amen God help us to understand that that we that we've got to get more in tune with God if he speaking to our hearts listen to him amen if if if you lack understanding ask for understanding if you lack Revelation ask for revelation let me share this prayer with you that Paul Harvey said one time how many know who Paul Harvey was all the old-timers the new are like who's Paul Harvey well for us Old-Timers I used to like listening to his news is very very insightful and one day he said this story he he he he aired the prayer over his radio program during the rest of the story program the rest of the story and received a larger response to this program than any other he has ever aired and this what is what he prayed he said Heavenly Father we have come before you today to ask your forgiveness do you know that daily we have to ask for forgiveness church because daily we backslide and we ask for your forgiveness and to seek your direction and guidance we know your word says woe to those who call evil good yes but that is exactly what we have done we have lost our spiritual equilibrium and reversed our values we have exploited the poor and we call it the lottery I people say man if I could win the lottery I would pay my tithing you can't even pay with a regular job how you going to pay with a lottery cuz the more money you have the less you want to let go of we have rewarded laziness and we call it welfare we have killed our unborn and called it choice we have shot abortionist and called it justifiable we have neglected to discipline our children and we called it building self-esteem you know my my dad didn't believe in building self-esteem he believed in whipping it out of you you want some esteem come here boy I give you some esteem right here you know even even tells me and my brother go get him a belt right now he would send us for the own weapon the one that he was going to punish us with he would send us to his room for it we were always looking for the skinniest belt and they were all the same then we bring it to him bend over okay we have abused power and called it politics we have coveted our neighbor position and called it ambition we have polluted the air with profanity and pornography and called it freedom of expression we have ridiculed we have ridiculed the time honored values of our forefathers and called it Enlightenment search us oh God and know our hearts today cleanse us from every sin and set us free amen you know for a for a non- message believer it's a pretty powerful prayer sometimes I get more Revelation from non-believers than Believers God help us in this hour Church to be more like him who wants to be more like Jesus I do amen God help us to be more like Jesus in this coming year we're already at the end of 2024 2025 is already a couple of weeks away can you imagine you know it's it's who would have thought we' have gone this far in life you know the Rapture she had taken place a long time ago Church it should have taken place a long time ago but somebody ain't ready yet God's waiting for the last one maybe uh the missionary will reach it out there in in in the fields of that are so you know absolete out there or maybe it'll be a ex-church member who backslid who comes back to the Lord we don't know but until then we keep preaching the gospel we keep hearing tapes don't be afraid to press play at home church we need to hear the word of God you need to feed your spiritual man just like you feed the Mortal man and you'll drive eight hours or eight eight miles for a Big Mac you know walk 10t to a player and hit the play button and listen to a message during the day church amen it'll do you some good and the more you hear the more you realize hey you going to start feeling spiritual you can start feeling good wow praise the Lord you'll even start saying amen by yourself there's times when I'm in my shop and I hear tape I'm like praise the Lord about myself I can do that cuz I I can act crazy cuz I'm by myself and I hear some that that inspires me like wow praise the Lord I can act religious when I'm alone I can act crazy cuz nobody can condemn me but it's the word of God Amen and it inspires and the more you hear the more you're you'll start to walk on a spiritual level you walk higher higher after a while the small things of the church won't bother you at all somebody singing out a tune ain't going to bother you because I've heard people say man that woman sings Out Of Tune why they let her sing for she's wrecking my song you know what just you sing to the Lord she'll see that's all that's the only voice she got and she's praising the Lord with that voice don't be judging her you know when I'm on myself and I'm singing with a Brooklyn Techo choir man I sound good more better than them I'll have you know right now but when I'm with somebody when I'm with somebody they talk hey Castile u t it down a little bit you know you're at a tomb amen God help us in this hour to be sincere first of all to love him with all your heart the Bible says love him with all your heart with all your might with all your strength amen amen and if you don't feel that way then Lord then make me feel that way revive me again give me some CPR Lord Jesus I need a good you know a good uh you know a transfusion of something but give it to me Lord so I can be a better person not to impress you church that's right not to impress the pastor but to live before you say Lord I'm Living For You amen you won't have to go around testify you're a Christian the world will know that you're a Christian because they'll see something in you when someone can tell your brother there's a light that follows you you're like wow thank God that I can't see because we probably get conceited you know but when others can see it it's humbling to know that God's with you even though we don't deserve it church God help us in this last hour do you do you love the Lord this evening do you love your pastor no really do you love your pastor do you love one another because if we can't love one another how you going to love Jesus we all got fault we all got problems but if he could Overlook them so can we Overlook and pray one for another I like what John said as he said there on the pulpit when he got up to speak everybody thought he was going to say some really deep words and he said my brothers he said loved ones beloved he goes love one another because the greatest weapon that we have is love when it's God's love amen God help us in this hour let us stand to our feet God bless you this evening um pray for us as we travel back home uh that we don't fall asleep and if we do well we have cruise control one day my dad fell asleep driving and my brother was in the back seat and you know my my father he loved the Lord with all of his heart he really did and he fell asleep as a moral he fell asleep and they're going down the highway and there's this big curve ah head and my brother's in the back and he's think oh my God there's a curve coming up and he wanted to wake my dad up but something told him hold off so he didn't wake my dad up he was just watching them when the car got to the curve the car turned by itself along the curve and then it straightened up again about the time my dad picked up his head you know and kept on driving and my my my brother goes dad you were asleep no I wasn't dad you were asleep Dad and that curve back there he goes the car made the turn by itself and my dad said thank you Jesus amen it's it it's by God's grace that we're here this evening thank you Jesus for that it's by God's grace that
