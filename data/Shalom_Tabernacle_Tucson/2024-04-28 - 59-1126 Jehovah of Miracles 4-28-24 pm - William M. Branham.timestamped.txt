[38:49] bring your Bibles to the
[38:52] church there's something about it that I
[38:55] just love to carry the

[39:02] brother sitting here that the pastor of
[39:05] that fine group of
[39:08] singers a colored brother down in the
[39:11] South one time they said he was carrying
[39:14] a Bible and he couldn't even read one
[39:18] word and they asked him said why are you
[39:22] carrying this
[39:23] Bible he said I'm carrying it because I
[39:26] believe it
[39:28] that's a good
[39:30] sign he said well
[39:33] then how do you know what it says he
[39:37] says I can hear the others read it and
[39:40] he said I believe every word in it from
[39:43] kber to
[39:44] ker he said I believe the ker also
[39:48] because it's got Holy Bible and wrote on
[39:51] it he said Do you believe all that's
[39:53] written in it he said I believe
[39:55] everything that's written in it and he
[39:57] said whatever the Lord would tell me to
[39:59] do I'd do
[40:01] it he said now MOS you know better than
[40:04] that said what if the Lord would tell
[40:07] you to jump through that stone wall
[40:09] would you jump he said yes sir I
[40:11] would said how you go to get through
[40:14] that stone wall M he said well if the
[40:16] Lord told me to jump you'd have a hole
[40:18] there when I got there so that's just
[40:21] about
[40:22] it if the Lord told him to jump he'd
[40:25] have the whole time he got there how
[40:27] true that is let's read now from the
[40:31] 36th verse of St
[40:34] Luke and behold thy cousin
[40:38] Elizabeth she has also conceived a son
[40:42] in her old
[40:44] age and this is the sixth month with her
[40:48] which was called
[40:51] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[40:56] impossible
[40:59] possible and Mary said behold the hands
[41:03] made of the
[41:05] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[41:10] and the angel departed from
[41:16] her it must have been a the son was just
[41:23] rising and was climbing up into the
[41:26] bright
[41:29] judian Skies as it was reflecting its
[41:32] glistens over the
[41:36] Galilee as the little Maid was making
[41:40] her way down the
[41:43] street she had a
[41:46] picture under her
[41:49] arm it must have been
[41:52] Monday just after the Sabbath and she
[41:55] was on her way to the
[41:57] public well to get water for her days
[42:04] Supply and she as we look at her
[42:09] tonight she's walking with her head down
[42:12] she was the more than a child about 18
[42:15] years
[42:18] old and she seemed to be studying in a
[42:22] deep
[42:25] study she was engaged to a young man by
[42:29] the name of
[42:32] Joseph he was a
[42:36] carpenter and he was building at this
[42:40] time a little house that had to have a
[42:43] special
[42:45] attention because he and his lovely
[42:49] little wife Mary was to live in this
[42:53] house and it had to have every
[42:57] just
[43:00] special day by day she would come up
[43:04] while he was eating his lunch at noon
[43:06] hour and would talk to him and how they
[43:09] would look over the plans of the house
[43:11] and how the little doors was to be set
[43:14] in and it was to be a special
[43:19] house and from where Mary lived let's
[43:23] say it was just across the hillside
[43:28] through the holler and up over the
[43:30] hill and on
[43:33] Sunday after the services while they
[43:35] would set out on the front porch after
[43:39] they had eaten their dinner and would
[43:41] look
[43:42] across on the other Hill at the little
[43:44] bunch of
[43:46] Evergreens and the little Gables of the
[43:49] house sticking up they would plan their
[43:53] future of what they were going to do
[43:58] the Sunday before had been an unusual
[44:01] Sunday at the
[44:03] synagogue in
[44:06] Nazareth the good Rabbi had preached a
[44:09] mighty
[44:12] sermon and he had told of the great God
[44:16] of
[44:18] Abraham how that in the days of his
[44:22] visiting his children down in
[44:25] Egypt how did he had brought them out
[44:28] with the mighty hand of
[44:31] power how he had showed himself to be
[44:35] ruler of both heavens and
[44:39] earth how that water could not stand in
[44:42] his
[44:44] path or nothing could hinder his Divine
[44:50] will how that he had sprinkle with his
[44:53] own hands bread upon on the ground of a
[44:57] night to feed his journey in children
[45:00] that had no
[45:02] bread and it also referred to a time
[45:06] that they run out of
[45:07] [Music]
[45:08] meat and the lord god Jehovah had caused
[45:12] the Great wind to blow and quailes come
[45:16] into the camp by the
[45:19] thousands and each Israelite without
[45:22] using anything more than their hands and
[45:24] caught these quailes and dressed them
[45:27] and had eaten all that they
[45:32] wanted and it was at this point
[45:35] that Joseph must have
[45:39] said did you realize dear how many
[45:43] quails that it would take to feed them
[45:46] people for there were about two and one
[45:49] half million people in that
[45:52] camp and each man could easily eat two
[45:56] Quail or more
[45:58] for satisfying so it would take more
[46:01] than 5 million
[46:05] quailes but he's Jehovah the
[46:10] Creator how that he could create Quail
[46:14] there probably wasn't five million quail
[46:16] in all Palestine or all the
[46:19] Wilderness but he's Jehovah God who can
[46:23] put them there if there's none there he
[46:26] can still cre create
[46:28] them for he did it in the days of
[46:32] Abraham on the mount where AB called him
[46:36] Jehovah
[46:37] Gyra the Lord will provide anything he
[46:41] has need
[46:43] of
[46:45] then Joseph must have said something
[46:47] like this the message was
[46:50] striking but I thought the good Rabbi
[46:53] ruined it at the end when he said well
[46:57] it is
[46:58] true that Jehovah used to do
[47:02] Miracles but alas Jehova doesn't even do
[47:06] Miracles
[47:08] today that those days have passed long
[47:12] ago all Jehovah wants us to do is to go
[47:15] to church and pay our dues and just live
[47:19] a good normal
[47:22] life Joseph might have said I kind of
[47:25] disagree with the rabbi
[47:28] because if he is God he has to remain
[47:33] the same God if he was Jehovah gy could
[47:37] provide for them he can provide for us
[47:42] also how I would like the holler Amen to
[47:48] Joseph Mary slips back into the house
[47:52] and picks up a scroll and brings it out
[47:55] as their usually Sunday afternoon's
[47:58] Bible
[47:59] study and it happened to be this day we'
[48:02] say that she brought out the scroll of
[48:06] Isaiah and as Joseph took the scroll and
[48:10] opened it up he began to read the scroll
[48:14] to Mary and the
[48:16] comment finally he comes to the place of
[48:20] Isaiah
[48:23] 996 where it says something like this
[48:27] unto us a child is
[48:30] given unto us a
[48:34] son and the government shall be upon his
[48:37] shoulders and his name Shall be Called
[48:39] counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God
[48:42] Everlasting
[48:45] father and while he was reading he heard
[48:48] a sigh and he looked sideways and the
[48:52] little lady sweetheart of his her little
[48:56] face said flashed up and her eyes were
[49:00] glittering like the stars on a dark
[49:03] night and said read that again
[49:09] dear and he read it
[49:11] again and she must have
[49:14] said oh who will that be what is the
[49:17] prophet speaking
[49:19] of and he said something like this or
[49:22] would have
[49:24] said the prophet was speaking speaking
[49:27] of the
[49:28] Messiah which will come and one of our
[49:31] women someday will bear the
[49:34] Messiah that scripture seemed to grip
[49:38] the little virgin she just couldn't get
[49:40] away from
[49:42] it that's what she was studying about
[49:46] perhaps on this morning where we find
[49:49] her going to the well to get
[49:52] water maybe I would say it was Monday it
[49:55] was wash day and she had to go get the
[49:58] wash waterer early her mother was
[50:01] old and as she was thinking on that
[50:06] scripture unto
[50:09] us a child is born unto us a son is
[50:15] given and his name shall be called The
[50:18] Counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty
[50:22] God the Everlasting father she becomes
[50:28] so interested in what she was saying or
[50:33] thinking until she almost forgot to turn
[50:37] the corner and as she raised her head
[50:40] there was something strange seems like a
[50:42] light
[50:44] flashed and she turns down towards the
[50:48] city Square where the virgent well
[50:50] stands
[50:52] yesterday and she must have thought oh
[50:55] the sun flick on some D that's left up
[50:59] on the side of the hill or it might have
[51:01] hit a piece of polished metal somewhere
[51:03] or armor from a Roman
[51:07] soldier that's perhaps what I saw
[51:10] flicker before my eyes so she goes on
[51:15] dreaming oh it's too bad that the church
[51:20] today doesn't walk in the spirit like
[51:24] that more than we do
[51:28] for It's that kind of a time that when
[51:31] God comes to
[51:33] you you know it was on the road to
[51:37] emus when theopus and his friend was
[51:40] speaking and talking and thinking about
[51:44] Jesus that he walked out of the bushes
[51:47] by the side of them and walked with
[51:49] them it's why we are thinking upon him
[51:54] the trouble with the world today we're
[51:57] thinking about everything else but
[52:00] him then we wonder why we don't get
[52:03] blessings we just a few weeks ago about
[52:06] three weeks ago when I sat down by some
[52:09] sycamore trees as I was telling you and
[52:12] begin to think it was there for the
[52:15] first
[52:16] time that he came and declared the new
[52:19] ministry to
[52:21] me think on him Draw N unto me and I'll
[52:25] draw n unto you sayith the
[52:29] Lord think upon Him David spoke that he
[52:33] was right his Commandments up on the
[52:35] bedst and meditate on them day and
[52:40] night that's what the church ought to do
[52:43] would keep your heart tuned in with God
[52:47] day and
[52:49] night where it stands when he
[52:52] appears Solomon said as a man thinketh
[52:56] his
[52:57] heart so is he begin to think that
[53:01] you're one of his children that he saved
[53:04] you and he's good to you and you love
[53:08] him and he loves
[53:10] you don't just wait till you go to
[53:13] church or some convenient hour just keep
[53:17] him on your mind all the
[53:21] time and as she went on walking down the
[53:25] street the there was no one yet on the
[53:28] street and as she walked along the
[53:31] little dirt path for a sidewalk all of a
[53:35] sudden she begin to realize that there
[53:39] was something around
[53:41] her a real strange
[53:46] feeling oh that's the most wonderful
[53:51] experience I trust that everybody here
[53:53] has experienced some kind of a times if
[53:56] you haven't this would be a good night
[53:59] to
[54:00] start just start thinking about him and
[54:03] worship him in your heart and all of a
[54:05] sudden you'll feel the close Fellowship
[54:09] of the holy spirit all around
[54:12] you and it gets so anointed to you can't
[54:16] hold it any longer you raise up your
[54:18] hands and or do something you just can't
[54:21] stand still when it
[54:24] comes as she was thinking not noticing
[54:28] who was around her the little lady
[54:30] perhaps with a pair of sandals on her
[54:33] feet walking along this little Dusty
[54:36] path but thinking of the Lord and of his
[54:39] promises of of things to come and as she
[54:44] was thinking all of a sudden that
[54:46] feeling got so great around her until
[54:49] she just raised up her head and when she
[54:52] did standing before her was a
[54:55] light and standing by that light was
[54:58] Gabriel the
[54:59] Angel the Archangel of
[55:03] God if you want angels to appear to you
[55:06] keep your mind on God and all the things
[55:09] of the
[55:11] world go about your
[55:14] business go to your church go to your
[55:17] washing of dishes wherever you are keep
[55:20] your mind on him all day and all night
[55:24] long thank you Lord then God will do
[55:28] something you're drawing close to him
[55:31] you got the world shut out just you and
[55:34] he are
[55:35] together this appearing of the Angel
[55:39] frightened the little virgin she had
[55:41] been taught that the days of Miracles
[55:43] was
[55:44] passed but she had seen something
[55:49] happen the angel told her said Hail Mary
[55:55] hail means to stop
[55:57] and he had a message for
[56:00] her when an angel comes he's got a
[56:04] message for you and the Holy Spirit
[56:07] God's angel is here tonight with a
[56:10] message for every
[56:13] believer just keep him on your
[56:16] mind keep thinking about him how lovely
[56:21] he is how sweet he
[56:23] is of his promises if you're sick get
[56:27] this on your mind he was wounded for my
[56:32] transgressions he was bruised for my
[56:35] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[56:38] was upon him and with his stripes I was
[56:43] healed keep your mind centered like that
[56:47] something will happen to you all of a
[56:50] sudden there will be a Something Draw N
[56:53] to you an anointing will come on you out
[56:56] of that CH you'll
[57:01] go Draw N to the Lord and he'll Draw N
[57:06] unto
[57:07] you and she looked at this great Angel
[57:11] and his name is
[57:13] Gabriel now there is angels of the Lord
[57:15] many of them and they come to the Earth
[57:18] and bring messages but
[57:22] Gabriel when he comes there's something
[57:26] major going to happen he was the one who
[57:29] announced the first coming of Christ he
[57:32] will be the one that will announce the
[57:33] second coming of
[57:36] Christ and he told
[57:39] Mary thou Hast found favor with God what
[57:44] a message to bring to her thou Hast
[57:48] found favor with
[57:52] God and while she was thinking on that
[57:55] script
[57:58] then that was the scripture that was
[58:00] confirmed to her now if you're sick
[58:03] think on that
[58:05] scripture if you're lost think on that
[58:08] scripture if you want the Holy Spirit
[58:11] think on that scripture and the Holy
[58:14] Spirit will confirm it to
[58:17] you there she was and the angel
[58:21] said told her that she was going to have
[58:24] a son
[58:26] and they would call his name Jesus he'
[58:29] save the people from their
[58:31] sins and he said your cousin
[58:36] Elizabeth is an old
[58:38] woman and it's six months with her now
[58:42] as a mother who was called
[58:45] Baron now Mary and Elizabeth were first
[58:50] cousins our Lord and John the Baptist
[58:54] were second
[58:57] cousins Elizabeth's husband's name was
[59:01] Zachariah he was the just man a priest
[59:04] at the
[59:05] temple he was a good man and all his
[59:10] life that he had been married to
[59:13] Elizabeth he had prayed and held on to
[59:17] God that God would give him a baby but
[59:20] she was
[59:23] Barren and she'd got some 60 years
[59:27] old and Zachariah was weighing
[59:31] 70 and still they had no
[59:34] children so Zachariah went up to the
[59:37] feast to do his duty at the feast which
[59:40] was to burn incense while the people
[59:43] were praying in the
[59:45] congregation while he was in there
[59:47] burning incense he looked standing at
[59:50] the right hand of the Altar and there
[59:53] stood
[59:54] Gabriel the
[59:56] Archangel live right do right angels are
[1:00:00] still living God still hasn't at his
[1:00:05] command there stood Gabriel the
[1:00:08] archangel and told him what was going to
[1:00:12] happen after this days of his
[1:00:15] administration at the the temple he go
[1:00:18] home and his wife was going to conceive
[1:00:21] and bear a child they called his name
[1:00:24] John and we know the story
[1:00:29] now the angel Gabriel 6 months later had
[1:00:33] visited Mary and told her that her
[1:00:35] cousin was going to have a baby
[1:00:38] also so Mary knew that that would be a
[1:00:41] miracle of that old woman well stricken
[1:00:44] in age having a baby but she said to the
[1:00:48] angel how shall it be with me seeing
[1:00:52] that I do not know a man
[1:00:57] and ask then you shall
[1:01:01] receive he said the Holy Ghost is going
[1:01:03] to overshadow
[1:01:05] you that Holy thing which will be born
[1:01:08] of you shall be called The Son of
[1:01:12] God that's how it's going to
[1:01:15] happen Mary never talked back to the
[1:01:18] angel she never discusted it in any way
[1:01:21] the only thing she said was behold their
[1:01:25] hands made of the Lord be it unto me
[1:01:28] according to Thy
[1:01:30] word did you think even the priest
[1:01:34] zachari had questioned him being an old
[1:01:37] man and her old to how this would be
[1:01:40] done and a preach who should know the
[1:01:43] word and know what God did but this
[1:01:46] little virgin was just a
[1:01:48] child and she had no husband she had to
[1:01:52] believe the
[1:01:54] impossi something that had never
[1:01:56] happened
[1:01:57] before but she never argued she never
[1:02:01] questioned anymore his word was enough
[1:02:05] for her oh if the church could just get
[1:02:08] like that the word settles it if God
[1:02:13] said so that's all we need to know how
[1:02:17] it's going to be I can't tell you but if
[1:02:19] God said so it's going to be that way
[1:02:22] because God said so
[1:02:26] oh that's what I want the church to know
[1:02:29] if there's anything I want you to sink
[1:02:31] faith in is in what God has said it has
[1:02:35] to be
[1:02:37] true did you notice she had to believe
[1:02:39] The
[1:02:40] Impossibles she could not go back like U
[1:02:45] Zachariah could he could have went back
[1:02:47] to Sarah and Sarah was almost aund when
[1:02:50] she had the baby and Hannah at the
[1:02:54] temple she was old woman too and they
[1:02:58] had plenty examples of that where they
[1:03:00] had husbands but Mary had to believe
[1:03:03] something that never had
[1:03:06] happened you've got thousands of
[1:03:09] examples of Divine Healing look at the
[1:03:12] people's been healed with cancer
[1:03:13] blindness dumbness deafness all kinds of
[1:03:17] sicknesses and diseases we've got plenty
[1:03:19] of that to look at as example but this
[1:03:22] little girl didn't have nothing but just
[1:03:25] his word and that was
[1:03:28] sufficient praise the Lord his word was
[1:03:31] good enough for her and I want you to
[1:03:33] notice she didn't wait till she was
[1:03:36] positive it was going to
[1:03:39] happen she started testifying about it
[1:03:42] right
[1:03:43] away she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:03:46] so she could be positive she's going to
[1:03:48] have the baby just as soon as she heard
[1:03:50] his word she tuck him at his word and
[1:03:53] she started testifying and praising God
[1:03:56] for the baby before she felt anything
[1:03:59] that give us more marries around here
[1:04:02] that can take God at his word and praise
[1:04:04] him whether you feel anything or not
[1:04:06] take him at his
[1:04:09] word God's trying to find somebody who
[1:04:12] will take his word I don't care how you
[1:04:15] feel someone say well I don't feel any
[1:04:16] better I was went to the meetings I was
[1:04:18] prayed for I that don't have nothing to
[1:04:20] do with it God said so and that settles
[1:04:24] it amen
[1:04:27] somebody will take his
[1:04:29] word that's what pleases him believe his
[1:04:33] word that's what pleases God that's the
[1:04:36] only way you'll ever find favor with him
[1:04:38] is believe his
[1:04:40] word and Mary tuck him at his word she
[1:04:43] said that's sufficient for me and she
[1:04:45] went around telling everybody she's
[1:04:47] going to have this baby before she had
[1:04:50] one sign of it at
[1:04:52] all one sign of anything she still she
[1:04:56] knew that it was going to happen because
[1:04:58] God said so don't you see the true seat
[1:05:01] of
[1:05:02] Abraham God speaks say believe
[1:05:05] it that's the reason I like the church
[1:05:08] today that can take God's word When God
[1:05:12] says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:05:14] today and forever the church says
[1:05:16] amen Jesus said the works that I do
[1:05:18] shall you do also the church says
[1:05:21] amen Jesus said these signs shall follow
[1:05:24] them that believe my they shall cast out
[1:05:26] Devils speak with new tongues take up
[1:05:28] serpents drink deadly things they hands
[1:05:29] on the sick they shall recover the
[1:05:32] church says
[1:05:34] amen they don't worry about it wonder
[1:05:36] how it's going to happen to just take
[1:05:37] him at his word and move on that's the
[1:05:40] true Seed of Abraham that's the children
[1:05:43] of
[1:05:44] God Mary had to believe for The
[1:05:47] Impossibles but God takes The
[1:05:50] Impossibles and makes them real when his
[1:05:52] he's tuck at his word the doctor might
[1:05:55] might have said you'll never get rid of
[1:05:56] that cancer the doctor might have said
[1:05:58] you'll never be able to walk again well
[1:06:01] well it's impossible for you to do it
[1:06:04] but Impossibles Fade Out when God's tuck
[1:06:06] at his word no matter what the doctor
[1:06:09] says he's doing the best he can but God

[1:06:33] word oh she started right away giving
[1:06:36] praise to God and telling the people
[1:06:39] that she was going to have a baby
[1:06:41] knowing no man I remember she had throw
[1:06:44] herself in
[1:06:46] liability liable for
[1:06:48] criticism but Mary didn't stop to think
[1:06:50] about criticism she didn't care about
[1:06:53] criticism
[1:06:56] Hallelujah when a man comes to get the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost you don't care what the
[1:07:00] neighbors is going to say you don't care
[1:07:03] if you shout you speak with tongues or
[1:07:05] whatever you do it's a pass that you
[1:07:07] took God at his word you don't care for
[1:07:11] criticism you've lost all your devil
[1:07:14] made
[1:07:15] homemade intellectual society
[1:07:19] called
[1:07:21] Prestige the thing that you want is
[1:07:24] favor with God
[1:07:26] you don't care what the Holy Spirit
[1:07:28] causes you to do the Shout Scream or cry
[1:07:30] or ball or anything you want to do
[1:07:33] anything the Holy Spirit putts on you
[1:07:35] you do it because you don't care you've
[1:07:37] lost all that man-made stuff you're free
[1:07:41] in Christ Jesus the spirit of God has
[1:07:44] set you free and you're free in the
[1:07:47] power of God bathing in his
[1:07:49] beauy worshiping him in the spirit and
[1:07:52] truth you're a free person you tuck the
[1:07:56] word of God it tuck a hold in your heart
[1:07:58] you don't care you're throw yourself you
[1:08:00] say well if I I'll be standing on my job
[1:08:03] someday and the boss said say I heard
[1:08:05] you that a holy roll meat and got healed
[1:08:08] I'm prayed no you're not brother if
[1:08:11] you're the Seed of Abraham you've
[1:08:12] counted a joy to stand and testify of
[1:08:15] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[1:08:17] Christ certainly you
[1:08:20] do my people shall not be ashamed if
[1:08:24] you're ashamed of me before man I'll be
[1:08:26] ashamed of you before my father and the
[1:08:28] Holy Angel said the Lord Jesus so
[1:08:32] they're not ashamed they're not
[1:08:34] afraid so after Mary hearing the good
[1:08:38] news about Elizabeth oh she wanted to
[1:08:41] share the news you know there's
[1:08:44] something about this that when you
[1:08:46] really take God at his promise and see
[1:08:49] fulfill it you want to tell somebody
[1:08:51] else about it you just can't sit still
[1:08:54] you got to do something about
[1:08:57] it so she took off that little woman by
[1:09:01] herself up along the river over the up
[1:09:04] the hills into Judea into the Mountain
[1:09:06] Country Now Elizabeth as soon as she
[1:09:09] found out that she was going to be a
[1:09:11] mother she had hid
[1:09:13] herself went back into the room and I'd
[1:09:17] imagine let's just think she's sitting
[1:09:19] back there and making little
[1:09:21] booties and getting all her little work
[1:09:23] ready for this little fellow was to come
[1:09:26] and she's making the little blanket that
[1:09:29] she's going to have him dedicated in and
[1:09:31] all these things getting things ready
[1:09:34] because she's going to be mothered but
[1:09:36] the thing was wearing her it was six
[1:09:39] months with her as a mother and the baby
[1:09:41] had not yet moved now anyone knows that
[1:09:45] that's
[1:09:46] subnormal way out of way about two or
[1:09:49] three months or more maybe four the most
[1:09:52] there's life but there's no life yet but
[1:09:55] she was sitting back in a little room
[1:09:57] let's just look now get us a little seat
[1:10:00] along the side of the road and watch
[1:10:02] here comes a little virgin up the road
[1:10:04] her little eyes are sparkling her cheeks
[1:10:06] just as rosy as they could be not with
[1:10:08] Max factors no no but lit up with the
[1:10:11] power of God and the joy of
[1:10:14] God just as hard as she could run her
[1:10:17] little eyes are glistening you know and
[1:10:19] she I see Elizabeth raise back the
[1:10:22] curtain and look out and she sees a
[1:10:24] young lady coming up the judian hills as
[1:10:28] it got closer she recognized it to be
[1:10:31] her cousin Mary so she wraps a little
[1:10:36] shawl around her and out she goes to
[1:10:39] meet her oh she must have throwed her
[1:10:41] arms around her and hugged her and
[1:10:44] kissed her you know people used to be
[1:10:46] they cared for one another you know but
[1:10:49] nowadays they don't they don't care for
[1:10:52] each other people so cold so far away
[1:10:55] from one another it used to be when one
[1:10:57] of the neighbors that get sick we'd all
[1:10:59] go in sit down help them and cut their
[1:11:02] wood cut their Carn or help them plow or
[1:11:04] whatever was going on and help them but
[1:11:07] today you don't even know your
[1:11:08] neighbor's dead unless you read it in
[1:11:10] the paper it's so cold so
[1:11:14] indiffer honey I don't mean this to be
[1:11:17] bad to my wife sitting there but the
[1:11:19] other day some time ago it's been we
[1:11:21] were downtown together and it just seems
[1:11:24] to be a
[1:11:26] Trend and there was a a lady on the
[1:11:29] street and she said how do you do sister
[1:11:31] Brandon and I never heard her say a word

[1:36:18] remember is there anybody here for the
[1:36:20] first
[1:36:21] time oh my
[1:36:26] thank
[1:36:31] you you see I I wish they'd all come at
[1:36:34] one night one
[1:36:36] time is anybody here that's never been
[1:36:38] in one of my meetings before let's see
[1:36:39] your hands well look at that we're so
[1:36:43] happy you're here I I may have to go
[1:36:46] through this just a little bit I
[1:36:48] purposed in my heart to do something
[1:36:50] else tonight I purposed in my heart just
[1:36:52] to bring that prayer line right straight
[1:36:53] through and pray for
[1:36:56] them that's what I was thinking of doing
[1:36:59] that's reason I call that line I might
[1:37:01] have to explain this to some of the
[1:37:03] people the newcomers after you just a
[1:37:05] minute you see we believe we're living
[1:37:07] in the last
[1:37:08] days we believe that Jesus Christ
[1:37:11] promised when he's on Earth he that
[1:37:14] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:37:16] shall he do also he said a little while
[1:37:19] and the world won't see me no more yet
[1:37:20] you'll see me for I will be with you
[1:37:23] even in you to the end of the world now
[1:37:26] if we can find out what Jesus was a long
[1:37:30] time ago the works that he did then we
[1:37:32] can find out the works that he do now is
[1:37:34] that right newcomers now let's just take
[1:37:37] just a moment and find out the works
[1:37:39] that he
[1:37:40] did let's just think did he call himself
[1:37:44] a Healer
[1:37:46] no did he claim to heal no he said it's
[1:37:51] not me that doeth the works it's my
[1:37:52] father that dwelleth in me is that
[1:37:55] right and when he passed through the the
[1:37:58] pool by the pool of Bethesda are the
[1:38:00] Greek multitudes of people lame Hal
[1:38:02] blind withered waiting for the moving of
[1:38:04] the
[1:38:06] water and
[1:38:08] Jesus no there's one man laying there he
[1:38:12] he wasn't blind he could walk but he had
[1:38:16] some kind of a trouble maybe it's
[1:38:17] prostrate trouble or or two bir is
[1:38:19] it had it for many 38 years I
[1:38:22] believe it was not going to kill him
[1:38:25] he's laying on a padet and he said will
[1:38:28] thou be made whole and he said sir I
[1:38:31] have no one to put me into water I
[1:38:32] remember Jesus said he knew the man had
[1:38:35] been this way a long time now he knew it
[1:38:39] now he healed him and walked away and
[1:38:41] let that multitude laying there is that
[1:38:44] right Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:38:46] today and forever and did that he did
[1:38:50] then he was
[1:38:51] questioned and what did he say now
[1:38:53] that's St John 5:19 now listen at his
[1:38:56] words verily verily I say unto you the
[1:39:00] son can do nothing in himself but what
[1:39:02] he sees the father doing that doeth the
[1:39:05] son likewise let's go back and see if
[1:39:08] that's true after he was anointed of God
[1:39:11] filled with the Holy Ghost because the
[1:39:12] Messiah was the anointed one is that
[1:39:15] right Brethren the the anointed one he
[1:39:18] was a man when it comes to man he was
[1:39:21] born eat drink had Flesh and Blood like
[1:39:23] we have but his blood was not he wasn't
[1:39:26] a Jew neither was he a gentile he was
[1:39:30] God see the blood comes from the male
[1:39:33] sect how many knows that he wasn't his
[1:39:36] mother's blood she was Jewish and then
[1:39:38] who was his
[1:39:40] father who was his father
[1:39:43] God then God doesn't have blood because
[1:39:47] God is a spirit but he created a virgin
[1:39:51] blood cell into the WS of Mary without
[1:39:54] sexual desire it brought forth the son
[1:39:56] Christ Jesus through that blood I'm
[1:40:00] Sanctified through that blood a sinner
[1:40:02] is made clean through that blood is what
[1:40:05] I have faith for this healing here
[1:40:07] through that blood changes my life
[1:40:11] that's the blood when he was 30 years
[1:40:13] old the Holy Spirit came up on him like
[1:40:15] a dove and he started his first Ministry
[1:40:19] let's see what he did the works that I
[1:40:22] do the the first thing he did we find
[1:40:24] out there was a fellow Andrew went and
[1:40:27] found Peter his name was Simon then and
[1:40:30] brought him to Jesus and Jesus said to
[1:40:32] him your name is Simon and your father's
[1:40:36] name is Jonas Thou Art the son of Jonas
[1:40:38] is that right the first thing he did now
[1:40:42] do you believe that Simon he he was a
[1:40:45] Pharisee the Church of the Pharisees
[1:40:47] we're taught by The Chronicles of the
[1:40:49] Bible that he was a Pharisee therefore
[1:40:52] he had been taught that there would be a
[1:40:55] prophet raised up and Moses said there
[1:40:57] will be a prophet raised up how many
[1:40:59] knows that the Messiah was to be a
[1:41:01] prophet the Lord your God shall raise up
[1:41:03] a prophet like unto me said Moses is to
[1:41:06] be a god
[1:41:07] prophet and as soon as he found out that
[1:41:10] he knew who he was he recognized him
[1:41:14] then away went a fellow named Phillip
[1:41:16] went over another country 15 miles
[1:41:18] around the mountains and found a fellow
[1:41:20] by name of Nathaniel his friend under a
[1:41:22] tree praying
[1:41:23] he said come see who we found Jesus of
[1:41:26] Nazareth the son of Joseph he said now
[1:41:29] could there be any good thing come out
[1:41:30] of Nazar I think he give you the best
[1:41:33] answer any man could give said come and
[1:41:34] see just don't sit there and criticize
[1:41:37] come find out for yourself and I can
[1:41:39] imagine going around the hill they said
[1:41:41] say you know that old Fishman you bought
[1:41:42] that uh them fish from that time and he
[1:41:46] couldn't even sign that receip couldn't
[1:41:47] sign his name or nothing yes or Simon
[1:41:50] you're talking about the the fisherman
[1:41:52] the big fisherman yes
[1:41:53] he come up before this one we know to be
[1:41:56] the Messiah and he told him what his
[1:41:58] name was and told him his father's name
[1:42:01] one said Nathaniel you've gone off the
[1:42:03] deep end but as soon as he walked up
[1:42:05] before a congregation something like
[1:42:07] this Jesus was perhaps ministering to
[1:42:09] the sick he looked around he seen him
[1:42:11] coming and he said behold an Israelite
[1:42:13] in whom there's no gu why tuck him right
[1:42:16] off his feet how did he know he was an
[1:42:18] Israelite not the way he dressed because
[1:42:20] all the easterners dressed alike turban
[1:42:24] Ro he said an Israelite in whom there's
[1:42:27] no God in other words a a godess man a
[1:42:29] Christian a real believer we'd call him
[1:42:32] he said
[1:42:33] Rabbi means teacher when did you ever
[1:42:36] know me well this is our first time ever
[1:42:38] meeting when did you know me he said
[1:42:40] before Philip called you when you were
[1:42:42] under the tree I saw you what eyes 15
[1:42:47] miles around the mountain I saw you
[1:42:49] before you come to the meeting under
[1:42:51] that tree he said by Thou Art the Son of
[1:42:55] God Thou Art the king of
[1:42:57] Israel Jesus said because I told you
[1:43:00] that you believe you'll see greater than
[1:43:02] this then of course there was those
[1:43:05] standing there who said now that man
[1:43:07] they couldn't deny it wasn't going on
[1:43:08] but they said he's be elub how many
[1:43:11] knows that be elub is a fortune teller a
[1:43:15] devil he's doing that through the power
[1:43:17] of the devil and Jesus said I forgive
[1:43:19] you for that but someday the Holy Ghost
[1:43:22] is coming to do the same thing that I do
[1:43:25] and one word against it will never be
[1:43:27] forgiven in this world or the world to
[1:43:29] come because they call the spirit of God
[1:43:32] an unclean thing the scripture says that
[1:43:35] now we find out that many of things he
[1:43:38] went up to Samaria that's another Nation
[1:43:41] another race of people like ham sham and
[1:43:43] Jac's people now he got to the Samaritan
[1:43:46] which is half Jew and
[1:43:48] Gentile and a woman was at the well and
[1:43:50] he talked to her a few minutes he said
[1:43:53] bring me a drink she said well it's deep
[1:43:55] it's not customary for you to uh to call
[1:43:58] to a Jew to a Jew as this American for
[1:44:01] something like that so we have no
[1:44:03] dealings with each other and as it went
[1:44:05] on the conversation went on finally he
[1:44:07] said go get your husband and she went to
[1:44:11] get she said well I have no husband and
[1:44:15] um is someone sick back there all right
[1:44:18] set her right down set her down now is
[1:44:20] that a minister with his hands on her
[1:44:22] lay your hands over owner Lord
[1:44:25] God In The Name of Jesus Christ the son
[1:44:28] of
[1:44:29] God take the evil sickness off of that
[1:44:32] sister may the power of God heal her
[1:44:37] body we cast It Away by faith in Jesus

[1:46:20] somebody needs some help along the line
[1:46:22] with st
[1:46:25] I don't know this man I've never seen
[1:46:27] him don't know a bit more what he's
[1:46:28] standing here far and nothing God knows
[1:46:32] now if Jesus has risen from the dead and
[1:46:35] I've told the truth about him then if he
[1:46:38] has risen and this is the last sign that
[1:46:40] he promised just like he said as it was
[1:46:42] in the days of Sodom and that's exactly
[1:46:44] what God did in the days of Sodom how
[1:46:46] many's been here this week to understand
[1:46:48] that that's exactly the sign God gave to
[1:46:51] Sodom and Jesus said it would repeat
[1:46:53] again just before his coming how many
[1:46:55] knows the Bible says that and the angel
[1:46:58] with his back turned and said Abraham
[1:47:01] where is your wife Sarah how do you know
[1:47:03] who he was said she's in the tent he
[1:47:05] told what is going to happen to her and
[1:47:07] she laughed in the tent and he said why
[1:47:08] did she
[1:47:09] laugh see he said that'll happen again
[1:47:12] before the end time I do not know the
[1:47:15] man never seen but here's here's a case
[1:47:18] like when our Lord and Simon met
[1:47:21] together that's right way all right we
[1:47:24] being strangers now the man could be an
[1:47:26] Infidel he could be a hypocrite he could
