Minor in the a ageny just oppos of the Church of philadelph the church of Ephesus where the first message was given where John was pastor at that time in other words look right back to the east he's looking right straight at his church amen from where he was at and the first message was to his church that represented a church age all right the vision was given to St John the Divine who was the pastor of the church at Ephesus at that time what condition then was this is where was it what condition all right it's not in history as a Rocky Island full of serpents scorpins lizards and so forth it's 30 Mi around it and full of rocks it was used in the days of John as a Alcatraz a place where the Roman uh emperor empire Exile criminals real bad criminals that they couldn't keep them in jail and so forth they put him out there on that island to die let them stay there until they were dead question the reason why John was there a Godly Man a righteous man a man of good reputation good character never in trouble why was this man there the Bible said for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ now we got the setting the aisle of patmas in the a agenc 30 Mi off the coast approximately 30 m Around It Rocky full of lizards and scarpins and so forth and used for a prison house like Alcatraz is to get a prisoner they can't keep in prison here they so such a horrible criminal they put him out on Alcatraz and now they took this Saed John the Divine the last of the disciples and the only one who died a natural death John before going to the island was accused of being a witch and was boiled in a bat of grease for 24 hours without scotching amen hallelujah glory to God you can't borrow the holy ghost out of a person Hallelujah B him for 24 hours in a bad of Grease without any harm and said the reason the the Romans give that he was a witch and bewitched the Greece [Applause] what the carnal mind can think of now you see when they call us mind readers and fortune tellers and BLB you see where the old Spirit come from but you see where the real Spirit come from it's the church age 24 hours bored him in hot bubbling grease and never even touched him hallelujah oh how God gting in him with his holy spirit his work wasn't finished they put him on the aisle for two years years and while God had him out there alone to himself he wrote the Book of Revelations as the angel of the Lord revealed it to him and then as soon as that was over he come back to Homeland and passed to the church in Ephesus and died and was buried in Ephesus John the Divine oh what a setting now all right the church stand under John or under great persecution John writes the ninth verse I John who also am your brother in tribula and companion in tribulations and in the kingdom and in the patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle that is called patmas for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ in other words he took the word of God and was proving it that was a word of God and Christ came back through him and testified that he was right am amen there you are God's word being made manifest in him proving that he was God's servant then they couldn't deny that so they had to tell him that he was a witch he Bewitched the grease and wouldn't hurt him and he Bewitched the people and they wasn't healed and he was a fortune teller that couldn't uh some kind of a bad person ill spir a foul spirit and that's the reason they uh put him out there thought he was dangerous to be amongst the society but he was only carrying out the will of God and God had a under all that condition he could not use him and all the persecutions and things because the Saints is coming Oh Brother John what will we do about this and what would he do John was a prophet we know that and so they were asking these questions so God just had the Roman Empire to pick him up and set him out there on the is and said now come on John I want to show you something that's going to happen the last of the Apostles there was no more to write it but John so they set him out on the aisle of patmas from 95 until 1896 and he wrote it and he said I am your brother and companion in tribulations now I didn't speak of the Great Tribulation that was not the Great Tribulation and does not come to the church the Great Tribulation comes to the Jews not to the church so it wasn't the tribulation the Great Tribulation now the 10th verse I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me the voice of a trumpet I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit God can't use you Hallelujah your your all your efforts are are in vain until first you do it in the spirit if I will sing I will sing in the spirit if I'll pray said Paul I'll pray in the spirit amen and then if there is anything that comes to me it's any good it has to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word made manifest by the results it Bears now like other words if I say Jesus Christ promised in his word that if I would repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the first thing we do is repent it's revealed to me that that's truth and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then the result is I receive the Holy Ghost if I'm sick and he promised me if I would believe and I have the Elders of the church anoint me to pray over me the prayer of Fai shall save the SI Lord I believe I follow your instructions an elder prays over me an me all that settles it just go on it's all over say you don't feel any difference though Jesus wasn't born when God slay him before the foundation of world when he was he was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world but in God's own mind he was already done I wasn't here than neither neither was you but in God's book if our names is ever on there it was put on before the foundation of the world When God says anything a has to take place so when you meet God's qualifications just remember God will manifest itself and take care of the rest of it you just go ahead as a finished work oh isn't that wonderful oh my than just tell God God said you do this and I'll do this well if I go do this he's got to do that now the devil say see he delays that don't make any difference Daniel Prayed one time and it was 21 days before the angel ever got to him but he wasn't discouraged he know he'd come anyhow so he just waited till he got there that's joh hallelujah oh that's when you're getting Faith now we have to get off of that we'd have a healing service right quick wouldn't yeah a faith but we want a soul healing service to heal the inside because that is what's going to last you get eternal life eternal life does not vanish or grow old it stays Remains the Same now he got in the spirit before anything took place the first thing he did he was in the aisle called pacas all these things that he did and he said I Heard a Voice and all these other things but before anything took place he was in the spirit and if you notice that in your Bible big Capital Spirit holy spirit amen he got in the spirit oh I just think that's wonderful I was in the spirit on the large day on what day the large day now there's a big discussion let's just quieten at this for a minute now as we said this morning some said at the revelation of St Matthew 17 was uh Peter the Catholic Church said he built his church up on Peter he was the first pope how could have been a pope been married see and it said Peter went with Rome is buried over there and to tell me one place history already where Peter ever went to Rome Paul did but not Peter all right so we find out at all these isms and things that just crept up see but and people today are everywhere you go they some great church has got a certain nail that was in his hand you know how many nails they got authentic nails today that was 19 they got bones they got they got pieces of robes and touch and handling we don't we don't have those things we don't need that Christ is alive he's in us not some nail or piece of cross or piece of bone or something he's the Living God living in us now manifesting himself oh yeah Hallelujah we only have one article of a memorial that's the Lord's Supper commemoration of his death but as far Christ himself he is with us and in us and that's the thing that we want to wave the glory of the Holy Spirit to the world wave it until the light goes out all right now the um so you see we tuck that other side of the road you know I've always tried to be this and our the Lord has always revealed it to me there's one extreme and another extreme but right in the middle of the road lays a truth did you notice Isaiah where he said that there shall be a highway Isaiah 35 and you remember how our precious Nazarene Brethren used to sing that song you know uh the Highway of Holiness Highway of Holiness now if you read their Bible right it doesn't say the Highway of Holiness it said there shall be a highway and a w amen and it shall be called not the Highway of Holiness but the way of Holiness and there a conjunction that finishes your sentence see it shall be a highway and a way and it shall be called a way of Holiness not a Highway of Holiness see a Road's built a way a good road is built highest Parts in the center because it lets all the trash wash off to both sides that's it when a man really comes to Christ he's got his eyes centered on Christ if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a little bit cold he'll get on this other side and be just a cucumber over on that side see is intellectual but the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you to keep you warm and moving amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit and move just as the spirit moves not till or not after just as the spirit moves the Catholic Church said the Revelation was Peter the Protestant Church said it was Christ but the Bible teaches it was the Revelation that he gave God gave him our Christ th Christ the son of the Living God blessed Simon son of Jonas flesh and blood is not revealed this to you no man Seminary or Monastery anything taught it to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you you're a Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it now we come to another place here where you get two different ideas I may be wrong if I am God forgive me but I'm going to disagree with the 7 Day Adventist that says that it was the seventh day he was in the Lord's Day the 7day advent's Brethren and many of them claim that it was the Sabbath day that he called the Lord's Day the Christian Church calls it the Lord's Day the Sunday the first day and we noticed a lot of times that at the Christian church yet today the Protestant people refer to it as the Lord's day Sunday that is not scriptural Sunday was the first day of the a week in the Bible not the large day and neither was it the seventh day Sabbath it would be impossible for it to be either one of those days because it taken John two years to write the Revelation which they was there be many of those uh seventh days and first days Passover the Bible the Revelation is wrote from 80 95 to 96 two years it was the large day the large day is exactly what it said and that's what it was John was carried in the spirit over into the Lord's day this is the day of man but the day of the Lord shall come Amen on down through the scriptures we'll find that he was in the large day caught up in the spirit and taken over to the large's day right amen see he was in the large day the Bible speaks of the large day we'll get to it in a little bit the many scriptures the first thing the Sabbath day as we talk about it the Sabbath day is not keeping a certain day we have no commandment to keep Saturday for a Sabbath we have no commandment to keep the first day for a Sabbath in the New Testament the Bible said in Hebrews the 4th chapter if Jesus would have given them rest would have not had would spoke of another day right but there remains a rest or Sabbath keeping to the people of God for we who believe to have entered into his rest we cease from our works like God did from his watch praise the Lord I just gets a feeling so good good I get ahead of myself notice in the Sabbath day God made the Earth in six days and the seventh day he entered into arrest and never returned no more to build any more worlds then he gave it to the people as a memorial because you couldn't keep it now because when you keep the Sabbath year the other side of the world is Sunday then again see so it showed it for a people of space and time for Israel but then there remains a Sabbath keeping for the people of God for we which believe to enter into his rest allthough the works I'm quoting Hebrews the 4th chapter although the works was finished from the foundation world for he spoke in a certain place on this wise the seventh day and again he limited a certain day saying in David you put it down Hebrews 4 um again he limited a certain day saying in David to a day after so long a time that is heard when you or said when you hear his voice Harden not your heart for if Jesus would have given them rest day would he not after to spoke of another day but there remaineth a rest or Sabbath keeping the word rest Sabbath is a strange word to us which means rest it's a Hebrew word which means a rest day a Sabbath day don't work rest for Jesus would have given them rest would he not have spoken of another day but there remaineth a rest or Sabbath keeping to the people of God for we which have entered into his rest we cease from our works like God did from his we never turn back to it on the next day of the week and heart again we've entered into AR rest Jesus speaking on the Beatitudes she said you've heard them say of the old time Thou shalt not kill I say un you who's ever angry with his brother without a CA is killed already you've heard say them of Old Times Thou shalt not commit adultery that's the Commandment but I said to you whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery already with her in his heart is that right so all these things were memorials just signs wonders waiting for the real time to come now when Jesus finish that Matthew 11 the beatitude he said come unto me all ye that are laboring tired and are heavy laden and I will give you rest unto your souls take my yoke upon me and learn of me for I'm meek and lowly is that right come unto me all yet labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest to your soul if you've labored one day 10 days 5 years 35 years 50 years 90 years and you're tired and weary come unto me I'll give you rest I'll take all that load of sin off of you and enter into you and give you perfect rest and satisfaction amen now what is that rest let's just settle this just a little bit see what some of them said why you go John Church no you put your name on the book no certain kind of water baptisms no let's just settle it and see what it is would you like to do that right here while we're waiting we see where John went over into what kind of a day did he go to when Jesus died upon Earth and his work was finished he entered somewhere now let's go back to Isaiah the 28th chapter and the 8th verse I believe it is now Isaiah 288 and let's read Isaiah 28 the prophet speaking 712 years before it happened now how many would like to know what the true Sabbath is the true rest is here it is now here's where the Prophet spoke it and I'll show you where it come to pass watch Isaiah 288 for all the prophet prophesying of these days for all tables are full of bment and filthiness people taking communion that smokes and drinks and lies and steals so that there is no clean Place who shall he teach knowledge who Could you teach knowledge today how many heard Billy gaham today it was a wonderful sermon he preached on how that a people could believe a lie just keep on in that line and even justify themselves and think that they were doing what was right the American public uh taking he said it and saying a wise man's filter and a smoking man's cigarette taking a one of the a devil's lies and instead of making him a fool whatever he is to smoke such a thing and try to make him a wise man he's a fool to even smoke it when the when it's full of death and cancer and everything else and still he Puffs it down his lungs he's a fool not a not a a wise man's filter there is no such a thing a wise man don't use the stuff there's no life unless it's a ndles 92 or something like that there's no life outside of Christ that's the real true life what makes men and women drink that stuff because you're trying to satisfy that thirst in there that God putting their thirst after him and they're trying to satisfy it with the things of the world that's the reason we have those things that's the reason people act like that because they're trying to quench that thirst that's in them for God and the devil's giving them death instead of Life all tables are full of vomit the clergymen everything else speak of it's all right have a little clean fun there's no such a thing Whom Shall he teach knowledge and to whom shall he make understand Doctrine then that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast now we're no more babies for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammer lips and other tongues will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the what Sabbath keeping the rest whereing you may cause the weary come on me all get weary in heav may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear when did that happen 712 years later when on the day of Pentecost stammer lips set upon the people and they were all fill with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues and the Holy Ghost tuck their lives over and cease from their worldly things then they entered into a rest with Christ Paul said in Hebrews the fourth chapter we which have entered into his rest has ceased from our worldly doings as God did on the day of his creation he entered into his rest and we enter in with him after our world he works is through there is your real true Sabbath amen so was picked up and got into that Spirit of Sabbath am and

you're welcome to use that or be in the back whatevers let's make yourself at home and comfortable as we hear this precious word this morning God bless you now now tonight I want to call your attention to a portion of God's word found in the fourth chapter of St Luke the 4th chapter and the 16th verse it will begin Jesus speaking this day is this word fulfilled in your ears now we want to draw from that a conclusion of how Dynamic is the word of God now we all can figure out the mechanics but it takes a Dynamics to make it work we can figure out what the mechanics of a machine automobile but then it takes the Dynamics to make the wheels go to operating and moving now Jesus had returned to to Nazareth where he was brought up on down in the scriptures here we find that they said we heard you did such and such over capernium now let us see you do it here in your own country Jesus said uh a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and of course that's where you're brought up at and where people know you and there he had a a a bad name to begin with by him being born without an Earthly father they called him an illegitimate child that Mary was actually pregnant before uh she married officially Joseph but that isn't so we know it isn't so and on this scripture what caused me to fall My Eyes Upon This was something that happened just recently in Phoenix Arizona it was the last day of the service that I was to speak at the International Convention of the Full Gospel businessman and in this convention there was a visitor with us which was um Catholic bishop which is uh is uh of the childing rights of the apostolic Catholic Church the most reverent John S Stanley OSD um he is the Archbishop of Metropolitan United States in the Catholic church this had to be his card and his and his address and he was a visitor uh with the Christian businessman and I had seen there the day before and when I was speaking on Saturday night I believe it was or Saturday morning at the breakfast and I as I was speaking he uh kept watching me I thought that man certainly is disagreeing with everything I saying and um you know you could you could just see me keep his head up and down but I didn't know what was just exactly working on him so on Sunday afternoon when I got up to speak I was going to take my text on birth pains where Jesus said that as a woman intervail with a child she's travailing in birth and uh so I was going to speak from there as birth pains the subject saying that the world is in birth pains now the old has to be done away with so the new can be born just like a a seed has to rot away in order to give New Life how the pains birth pain struck um the world in World War I she had a terrific pain because he had poison gas and so forth that almost could destroy the world and in World War II she struck another harder pain they had Blockbusters and also an atomic bomb she cannot stand another labor pain with these missiles and things today one more war will throw her out into space for she will now be delivered and there will be a new Earth the Bible said there will be under every prophet's message Israel got a birth pain because that these prophets that come on the scene after the theologians and clergymen would have the church all in Organization for him and when that prophets come on the scene with thus sayeth the Lord they Shu them churches and she had a birth pain finally she had birth Plains flown up until she delivered a son of the Gospel which was the word itself made flesh so the church really is in birth pains tonight uh again for the Deliverance of the son son of God to come again all of our theologians all of our systems all of our denominations have rotted right out from under us so we are in birth pain and a message from God always stores the church in heavier pain but after a while she's going to be delivered of a bride that will bring forth Jesus Christ to his bride and then thinking this man had disagree with me so much when I raised up to speak this message I turned in my Bible to find the page and my wife had just given me a new Bible for Christmas my old Bible is about 15 years old and the thing was just about tore to Pieces the pages every time it open up and fly out of it and but I know just where to find every scripture so I studied Post in that Bible and I just picked up the new one because doesn't looks a ragged to go to church with and when I started to to turn over in St John where the scripture was found I started to read the 16th chapter and the verse that I was looking for wasn't there so I thought strange I turned back again still it wasn't there and brother Jack Moore from streetport Louisiana a bosom friend of mine he was sitting there I said brother jack isn't that found in St John 16 he said yes and this Catholic priest got up out of his seat from about a 100 clergymen sitting on the platform walked over close to me with all of his robes and gowns and crosses and so forth and got right up close to me and he said my son Be steady God is fixing to move I thought a Catholic bishop telling me that he said read it out of my book and I read the scripture out of his book and took my text and went on preach my sermon afterwards when I got through he got up after I was gone and said this one thing has to happen after that the church has to get out of the mess that sit in or we have to get out of the mess the churches in so one of the other and um I was on my road home back down to Tucson that evening the kids was crying for a sandwich and I stopped to get a sandwich at little standing my wife said bill I never was so nervous in all my life to see you stand up there fuming to that Bible said didn't it make you nervous I said no I said I know it was in there somewhere they just didn't have the pages a misprint and she said to think that I got you that Bible and look like every eye in there was right up on me and I said well you couldn't help that there was a misprint in the Bible I said they just never put the page in well I got down and looked at it again just perfect if it could be but the 16th chapter ends portion the portion of it just about 3 Ines from the bottom over at the 17th chapter on the other side does the same thing and being a new Bible those two pages had perfectly stuck together now I was reading from the 17th chapter instead of the 16th well I said that's all fine for some cause and justce plain as you could hear any voice a voice come to me and said he entered into Nazareth the where he was brought up at and went into the synagogue as it was was his custom and the priest gave him the scriptures to read and he read Isaiah 61 and when he had read the scriptures he sat down handed the priests back the Bible the book and sat down and all the eyes of the congregation was up on him and precious words proceeded from his mouth and he said this day this this scripture is fulfilled this day this scripture is fulfilled how accurate is the scripture if you'll notice this in Isaiah 61 1-2 is where our Lord was reading from Isaiah 61 1-2 but in the middle of the second verse of Isaiah 61 he stopped where it said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year then he stopped why the other part to bring judgment didn't apply to his first coming but his second coming see it didn't apply there how the scriptures never make a mistake they're always perfect Jesus stopped just where the scripture stopped because that was exactly what was to be Vindicated in his day now in that first coming the second coming he will bring judgment upon the Earth but not then he was to preach the acceptable year notice the Messiah standing in the platform to identify himself with the Word of Promise for that age how strange the Messi standing up before the church and look at these precious words when he says here to preach the acceptable year the acceptable year as we all know his Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves and prisoners as they were uh been taken prison and it had to give a son to pay a debt or a daughter to pay a debt and they were in bondage no matter how long they'd been in bondage or how long they SP to stay there when the year come of the Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if you wanted to go free were free you was no more slave but if you desired to remain a slave then you had to be taken down to the temple stood by the temple post and they took a awe and Bor a hole in your ear and then you had to serve that slave master the rest of your days what a perfect example it is of the Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's preached the acceptable time and the time of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are what color you are what denomination you belong to how far you stooped in sin or what's wrong with you you can go free when you hear the Dr gospel trumpet sound out you are free but if you turn your back upon the message and refuse to hear it notice you were bored in the ear with an awe that means to say that you have crossed the line between grace and judgment and you will never hear the gospel again you'll never get any further you must be a Slave to the system you're in the rest of your days if you refuse to hear the acceptable year now the other part of it as I said didn't need to be answered because this coming Messiah time now is when he will bring judgment now how could those people ever fail to see who he was how did they ever Miss how could it be when it was so plainly made known and showed how could they have ever miss seeing when he what a word think of it this day is this scripture fulfilled before your eyes who said it God himself who is The Interpreter of his own word this day is this scripture fulfilled the Messiah himself standing in the presence of the congregation and reading a word out of the Bible pertaining to himself and then saying today this scripture is fulfilled and they still fail to see it what a tragedy that that would be but it's happened it's happened many times how could it happen of course like it did in other times by believing man interpretation of the word that's what caused it those Believers in them days so-called Believers was taking the interpretation of what the priest had said about the scripture therefore Jesus not belonging to any of their ranks or their societies he was uh excommunicated from their company and therefore they could not identify him with them because he was different from them the person of Jesus Christ was so unique that no one should have Miss seing that was a Son of God because he was a perfect identification of the scripture that was wrote of him it's the way any Christian is known when his life identifies the very things that a Christian supposed to do how he could stand there and say this day this scripture is fulfilled right before your eyes how outstanding how so plainly and yet those people misunderstood why is because they took the interpretation of some order of priest that they were listening to and history always repeats itself and scripture has a compound meaning to it and a compound Revelation for instance like it says in the Bible that out of Egypt I've called my son referring to Jesus run the marging on that you find out it also referred to Jacob same scripture Jesus was his greater son Jacob was his son he called out of Egypt which the Scofield reference and all other references give to it because that's a scripture it was referring to so it had a a double answer it had an answer to Jacob called out and to Jesus called out and so is it today is because that we're in such a turmoil as we are and people fail to see the truth of God is because there's too many man-made interpretations of God's word God don't need nobody to interpret his word he is his own interpreter God said in the beginning let there be light and there was light that doesn't need an interpret ration he said a virgin shall conceive and she did that doesn't need any interpretation when God's interpretation of his word is when he vindicates and proves it to be so that's his interpretation by making it come to pass that's where God's interpretation is it's when he makes his word come to pass he's interpreted it to you like if it never been light you said let there be light if there was that don't need anybody to interpret but we get man-made systems mixed into it and when you do you you get it out of line it's always been that way but I still think of how striking it must have been think of it the Messiah why did they fail to see him because they're very leaders that ought to have know him that ought to been first in the scripture that ought to be understanding of the scriptures they belittle this name and said he's the illegitimate child to to begin with we wouldn't believe that years later we don't believe that we would die for the purpose to say that he was a virgin born son and it'll come to pass someday that the very things that we see Jehovah doing today men the ages to come if there is will die for the thing that we're talking about today you'll have to do it for the mark of the beast comes on and you're not allowed to preach the gospel this way when the Great Union of churches comes together which is in order right now for the World Church you'll have to seal your testimony with your own life to this you must believe it now if those priests could rise up and condemn him would not condemn him but you say if I have been there I would have done so and so well that wasn't your age but this is your age this is the time you say well if he was sh the Bible say he's the same yesterday today and forever the same so he is here but he sh as the world has civilized become greater and educated more he's sharing a spirit form which they cannot kill or put to death he died once he cannot die again he had to be made flesh in order for God to be put to Death In the Flesh for sin but this time he can never die it's the Holy Spirit now how to think that they had them things against him another thing that he would not join any of their ranks then you see that still made him a bad person he wouldn't join their their organizations wouldn't join their priesthood and he wouldn't have nothing to do with it and then besides all that he tried to tear down what they buil up he went in into the temple we call him a meat man he was but many times we misunderstand what meekness is he was a man of compassion but yet we fail sometime to understand what compassions is not human sympathy isn't compassion but compassion is doing the will of God he passed through the pool of Bethesda the gate there laid people multitudes of them multitudes is no certain number but they laid multitudes Le blind Hal wither and he had compassion on the people always and he went to one person that was not lame blind Hal or withered maybe had a prostrate trouble maybe he had some little infirmity that was had it 38 years it wasn't going to bother him wasn't going to kill him he was laying on a pallet and he said will thou be made whole and a man said I have nobody to put me in the water but while I'm coming or someone steps down a I mean see he could walk he could see he could get around but he was just feeble and Jesus said to him rise up take up your bed and go to your house and Jesus's question on that but you remember the scripture said this no wonder if he'd come to Jeffersonville tonight and make an act like that they'd still talk about him but remember he came to do one thing was the will of God now that's found in St John 5 19 you'll get the answer he said verely verely I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doth the son now they ought to have known that that was a very Vindication of the prophecy of Moses for the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me you notice when he seen the man he said Jesus knew that he had been in this condition for many years see being a prophet he saw that man in that condition and went down there and wave waved his way around to those people mincing through the crowd until he found that certain Man passed by the lame Halk blind and withered yet a manful of compassion but compassion is doing the will of God now we find him as he would not join up with them he would not have nothing to do in their ranks then he was an outcast he would not have any besides that he went into the temple one day a man went in there and found the house of God just out contaminated as it is today they were buying selling changing money and he turned over the money tables tuck ropes and plaided them and beat the money changers out of the temple and looked upon them with anger and said it's written Hallelujah my father's house is a House of Prayer you made it a to Fe and you with your Traditions has made the Commandments of God of non effect all could have bunch like had ever believe in in ner they had been so hogw watered in the muck of societies and filth of the day until they were so ecclesiastical frow up until they couldn't feel the vibrations of the power of almighty God no wonder a little woman could touch His Garment and get heal by and a drunen soldier could spit in his pace and feel no virtue depends on how you approach it depends on what you're looking for when you're going to church it depends on what you're looking for now we see him standing there no doubt but what the people had already warned warned the priest had warned the people now he's coming over here next Sabbath and when he does don't you listen to him now you might go and sit here but don't pay no attention what he says because he don't belong to our group he's an outcast he has no Fellowship card he don't even have an or uh organization paper with him he doesn't have nothing like that what is he some renegation boy that was born down here illegitimate Birth by an a carer's home that a mother conceived him before they were married they're trying to hide the thing up with some Supernatural thing we don't know that when the Messiah cometh he'll come down the corners of heaven and go to our high priest and say Here I Am CES but we find out that he didn't do it that way because it wasn't written in the word that way it was a manmade tradition that caused him to believe that the word word said that he would come just the way he come there he stood reading the word and saying to them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes and still they fail to see him or recognizing like he did in all other ages Noah could have said the same thing the day that he entered into the ark and the door closed Moses could have raised that wind in the top of the Ark looked out upon the congregation remember God closed the door and he could said this day this scripture is full of pill in your eyes but it was too late for than that he had preached 120 years to try to get him into that boat that he had built telling him that the scriptures said thus sayith the lord it's going to rain but they waited too long but Noah could have easily said that today this day the scripture is fulfilled Moses the same day that the pillar of fire come down on Mount Si and give witness to his testimony Moses could have said this day this scripture is fulfilled Moses you know was a called man of God a prophet and while he was being called being a prophet he had to have a supernatural experience in order to be a prophet he had to meet God face to face and talk with him and another thing what he said had to come to pass or no one would have believed him so no man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with God on a backside of a desert somewhere where he met God himself all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him he was there he know it happened every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience I talked to my nephew a while ago a little catholic boy and said Uncle Bill I run from Pillar To Post going everywhere trying to find something night tonight before this meeting started he's been crying and at night time he's been dreaming dreams of coming in running up to the altar we preaching and making a confession that he's been wrong I said Melvin no matter where you try to go how many churches you jar how many Hail marries you say or how many blessings you get from man you got to be born again of the spirit of God it's the only thing that'll satisfy the human heart that's I know they got a substitute today of being born again to shake hands with the preacher and put your name on the book but friends that is a Dogma it's not a Bible truth if it would the Acts of the Apostles in the second chapter have to read like this when the day of Pentecost is fully come the pastor walk out and shook hands with the people but said when the day of Pentecost and fully cometh the inauguration of the church there came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind and it build all the house where they were setting that's how the Holy Spirit Come the first time that's how it's come ever come since that time he's God and changes not now it stumbles people they say that was for another day well he's the same yesterday today and forever every time the church ever received the Holy Ghost it's always come like it did the first time under the same prescription acts 238 never has changed never will change like a doctor's prescription for a disease you write out a prescription for a disease the doctor does and take it to some quack drug us and he puts too much of the antidote in it it's so weak it won't do you any good he puts too much of the Poise then it'll kill you it's got to be wrote just according to the doctor and the doctor's prescription on how to receive the Holy Ghost is given to us by Dr Simon Peter on the day of Pentecost I'll give you a prescription repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the prescription is the them is fall and even as a man is the Lord Our God shall call the Eternal prescription Moses had had this experience he went down into the country and he began to tell the people I met a pillar of fire he was in a burning bush and he told me to tell you I am that I am go down I'll be with you take up the stick in your hand and hold it up over Egypt whatever you you ask it'll be done well probably s priest said nonsense but when they seen the real facts of this take come to pass they couldn't hold it any longer they know he was s of God then if Moses said he saw that and testified to it to be the truth then God obligated if that is the truth to identify and vindicate that man's word the truth that's true if Jesus Christ stood there and read that day this day is this word fulfilled before you God's obligated to make that word come to pass we stand here tonight and say that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever God's obligated to prove that to be so because it's his word yes now what does it do it takes faith in believing him FES faith in believing his word that it is the truth notice what come to pass when Moses brought the children out and all those that followed him those who did not follow stayed in Egypt but those who followed Moses when they come out of the Red Sea and got out into the Wilderness God came down upon Mount Si that pillar fire set the whole Mountain on fire and a voice spoke out of there God gave the 10 commandments Moses could have walked up there before the people and say this day the scripture that I have have told you as his Prophet comes to pass this day I've told you that God let me and not Bing a burning bush and a pillar of fire and he said this I'll this will be a sign you will bring them people right back to this place here again and there's God in the same pillar I told you was in hanging right down her on the mountain this day this prophecy is fulfilled here he is to vindicate that the things I've said is the truth God give us more man like that that's honest and sincere and tell the truth that God Almighty could vindicate that his word is still truth he remains the same yesterday ever why wouldn't he do it he promised to do it Joshua he might have said the same the day that he' come back to kades Baria where they had journeyed so far in the wilderness they were doubting the land being the kind of land that God said it would be but God told them it was a good land it was flowing with milk and honey and Joshua and Caleb was the only two that would believe it out the other 10 that left when they come back they had the evidence they had a bunch of graps that two strong man could only carry Joshua and Caleb could have stood right there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled here's the evidence that it is a good land sure one there's the evidence that it's a good land where did you ever get such things as that in Egypt there was no such places but this day this scripture is fulfilled he could have said the them see when he prophesied and said the walls of Jericho would fall down as they marched around seven times seven days seven times a day and when they marched around that last time the walls fell down Joshua could a step and said this this day the chief captain of the host of the Lord that told me weeks ago that it would happen like this this day this scripture is fulfilled there laid the walls flat on the ground come on let's go take it it belongs to us this day this scripture is fulfilled how wonderful man of God has stood for the things that's right Israel at the river when they possessed the land went over how are they going to do it it's the month of April the flood are coming down because the snow was melting up in Judea oh what a poor uh General it seemed like a God was to bring these people there in the month of April when the Jordan was higher back than it ever was sometimes I might get stop here if I had time to give you just a little tip sometimes you may be studying out with cancer you might be study with the disease you think why me being a Christian would be in this way why would I be sitting like this if I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it for she might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace they said our God is able to deliver us in this fiery furnace but nevertheless we not bow down to your image when they walked out there at the smell of the Furnace upon them no smell of the Furnace rather upon them they could have said this day is this scripture fulfilled Daniel come from the Lions then he could have said the same thing John the Baptist after 400 years of ecclesiastical teaching no wonder that church is in a mess at that time when he appeared in the wilderness the Jordan he could stood right there on the bank as he did and say this day this scripture Isaiah Authority is fulfilled how I could stop here and tell you what that old priest told me said Son you never finish that message I said keep still he said you mean them Pentecostals don't see that I said no he said I see it in a Catholic preach [Music] he said why didn't you go I said keep still he said glory to God I see it and about that time the Holy Ghost fell on his sister sitting out there in a meeting and she raised up speaking in unknowing tongues and gave the interpretation of the very thing that the priest and I were talking about on the platform the whole church the whole place went into a roar turn on over old Robert's convention last week or week before last was to talk of the convention how did that priest setting on the Holy Spirit reveal out there through a woman his sister I believe it was what was taking place up there on the platform and revealed that thing that we were hiding the hour that we're living this day this scripture is fulfilled this day the evening lights have come and we fail to see it notice John said this day I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness I said the prophet Isaiah prepare the way for the Lord they didn't understand said oh you're Jesus you're you're the Christ rather he said I am not the Christ he said I'm not worthy to loose his shoes but he said he's standing among you somewhere for he was sure that he would be there he' be in his day because God told him he was to introduce the Messiah one day a young man's come walking down through there and he seen a a like a light over the top of him a sign and he cried out Behold the Lamb of God this day this scripture is fulfilled before you sure at the day of Pentecost how Peter stood up and quoted their scripture of Joel 238 when they was all laughing at those people they couldn't talk in their own language they were jabbering off something else the Bible said clothing tongues clothing is a party tongue not saying nothing just a jabber running around like a bunch of drunk people they all said well these people are drunk look at them look how they're acting how them women and men they're disorderly said that religious group of that day Peter stood up in the midst of them said man and Brethren you that dwell in Jerusalem and you that dwell in Judea let it be known unto you that these are not drunk as you supp supp sing it's the third hour of the day but this is that which is spoke of by the prophet Joel it'll come to pass in the last day I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this day this scripture was fulfilled certainly Luther was right on time Wesley was right on time Pentecost was right on time nothing out of the order now I asked you to consider the age and time we now live in with the promised word for today if back in other ages man could say this day this scripture this day this scripture then what about the scripture for this day what's promised for this day amen where are we standing what hour are we living when the clock is beating the scientific clock 3 minutes before midnight world has got the Jitters the church is in a bed of corruption nobody knows where they're standing what time of day is it what about the scripture for this day the conditions of the church the conditions of the church today in the world politics our world system is just as rotten as it can be I'm not a politician I'm a Christian but I got no business talk about politics but I just want to say they're rotten on both sides I voted once that was for Christ I got to win the devil voted against me Christ voted for me depends on which way I cast my vote I'm glad I cast it on him let the world say what they want to I still believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever he'll prove it certainly will certainly the increase in crime juvenile delinquency look at our nation want the flower of the earth our great democracy was formed back there and the Declaration of Independence and decoration independ signed and we had a democracy our great forefathers and the things that they done we had a great nation but she is now rotting and crumbling and shaking and giving away and trying to tax people to get money to send over to buy friendship with their enemies they're throwing it back in our face One World War Two World War and still moving on to a third certainly politics is rotten corrupted rotten to the bottom just exactly what Matthew 24 said it would be Nation be against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom all these things would take place let's consider this now all right notice another the increase in scientific research now one time Mr my grandfather went to see my grandmother in an ox cart now it's a jet plane or even orbit into the Earth in the outer space it's great how who said this Daniel 12:4 said knowledge shall increase in the last days we see the hour We're living notice our the the conditions of the world the condition of Science and notice again today in our educational system a don't try to now this I've got the newspaper clippings teaching sex in our church in our schools of young students to have sexual affairs with one another to see if they can mate in the world yes sir how about in our priesthood tonight I got a piece out of the paper over in Los Angeles California where a bunch of clergymen Baptists and Presbyterians ministers brought B to homosexuals and imp pacce homosexual say is trying to win him to God when that's why the curses of the hour a sodomite the law even arrested him now where we at our whole system is rotten out for ners I've seen the increase of homosexual across the United States has increased 20 to 30% over last year think of that man living with man just exactly like they did in s increase in crime juvenile delinquency what hour are we living this day hey this word of Prophecy is fulfilled the religious world the church itself the church the called out church that we call the called out Church the last Church age the Pentecostal Church age where is it it's in lady OA as the scripture said the they they've let down the bars their women are half dressed or man it's a horrible thing some of them married three four times on Deacon boards and everything everything else they let down and brought in corruption because of setting councils and took the place with the world and today they got better buildings they ever had some place one of them is building a $50 million Auditorium $50 million Pentecostals that used to be down the corner 25 years ago beating a tambourine said we because the scripture said in Revelations 3 that you are rich that I'm rich I said as a queen I have nether nothing and knowest thou not that th wretched miserable poor naked blind and don't know it this day this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes amen amen mean so be it I'm not amening myself but I mean I believe it's the truth this day this scripture is fulfilled the Pentecostal church is in a lady of seen condition oh they still jump and hollering carry on When the Music's beating when the music stops beating or the beat that music someone play and call it Christianity and whenever that stops all the glory is gone it's a real praise of God there isn't enough whistles in enough enough power in the world to stop it when it really comes from God it don't take music to be beat up it takes the spirit of God to come down and long forgot it the that CL the gift to the Holy Ghost initial evidence of speaking in tongues and I heard devils and witches speak in tongues the Holy Ghost is a word of God in you that identifies Itself by accepting that word outside of that it can't be the Holy Ghost if it says it's the Holy Spirit and denies one word of that Bible it cannot be the Holy Spirit that's the evidence whether you believe or not notice another great sign the Jews are in their Homeland their own Nation their own money a member of the United Nations they got their own army they got everything they're in their Homeland which Jesus said learn a parable of the Fig Tree there they are right back in their Nation this day

see the hand of God the next few hours I told Mr Woods is present tonight and I guess eight or 10 of a man of 15 that was there at that time when it took place the next morning where the Lord came down in a horror wind and ripped them Mountain out around as they cut the tops of the trees loose and made tree blast and said judgment is headed towards the West Coast amen two days after that Alaska almost sunk beneath the Earth and since then up and down the coast the beles of God judgment against that spiritual screen there is a Armon curtain there is a bamboo curtain and there is a sin curtain civilizations travel with the Sun so has the gospel they've come from the East and went West like the sun goes and now it's on the west coast it can't go no further if it goes further it'll be back East again the prophet said there will come a day that cannot be called night or day a disal day a lot of rain and fall just enough how to know how to join a church or put your name on a book but it shall be light about the evening time this day this scripture is fulfilled the same the same s n that rises in the East is the same s n that sets in the west and the same s o n of God that come in the East and Vindicated himself as God's manifested in the flesh is the same so in a God in the Western Hemisphere here that's identifying your among the church tonight the same yesterday today the evening like the son has come this day this scripture is fulfilled before us where are we at in this abrahamic age where are we in this great time we're standing the great hour that we're living all the Visions has been fulfilled I about one little Minister friend of ours here associate sister Church Junior Jackson come running up to us one night me down there said I had a a dream brother Grand is bother me I seen Aller Brethren gathered upon a hill and set upon this hill you were were teaching us out of letters that was wrote look like in some letters that time had carved out in The Rock when he finished that all that was finished you told us said come close and we all gathered up said you reached from somewhere and look like got like a crowbar and whipped the top of this little Pyramid open and what it did said granite rock with no riding on it and you told us to look in upon this and you all we all started looking said I turned my head and I noticed you going towards the West just as hard as you could towards the setting of The Sun how many remembers it now I stood there a little bit till the Holy Spirit revealed it I said the entire Bible as much has been revealed to man through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name and all these things has been revealed but there is secret that's hid inside because the Bible seal with Seven Seals I must go there to find it that morning when those seven angels come down and blasted the Earth and rocks through every way seven angels stood there and said return back to Jeffersonville from where you come from for the Seven Seals of the seven Mysteries will all be open here we are today understanding sereny in a few days of God willing we understand the correctness of marriage and divorce and all these things that God's open ever seal the Mysteries since the foundation of the world and we've been enjoy the presence of His blessings that is true this day the Scripture A Life Magazine packed an article of it Mystic circle of light goes up in the air above Tucson and Phoenix in the same way that I told you nearly a year before it happened how it would be in like a triangle the picture hangs in the church down there you took that magazine has it there it was just exactly it said it's 27 mil high and 30 Mi across they don't understand yet what happened it appeared mysteriously and went away mysteriously and brother Fred sofman brother Jean Norman and I stand there three is a witness like it up on the top of the mount Peter James and John they give witness good there watched it might happen and seen it done there it is hanging in the sky so far there's no humidity no marer nothing to make them a fog how could they come there was the angels of God returning back after their message this day that prophecy has been fulfilled in our this day this scripture has been fulfilled Watch Seven Seals has been open the wh winds to the West Coast now don't miss it like they did back Yonder now our attention a little closer to our day what does the scripture say about today and about the time we live in Jesus speaking won't have time to take them all but I want to take this one before we close Jesus said in St Luke the 17th chapter the 30th verse Jesus Christ the word himself do you believe that Jesus Christ the word himself made flesh spoke and said what the word would be in the end time what would be the sign of the end of the world he told him Nation to Rise Against Nation but he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the day when the son of man is being revealed now when Jesus came to the Earth he came in the name of Three Sons son of man which is a prophet Son of God and Son of David now he Le your own Earth he never did say he was the son of God he said I'm the son of man Jehovah himself called Ezekiel and the prophets son of man because he had to come to fulfill scripture as a prophet Moses said the larger God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me that's the reason he could not be the Son of God there because he was the son of man he the word came to the prophets and he was the word in his fullness amen son of man the the m Prophet not the major prophet but the god Prophet the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him therefore he was the son of man now for 2,000 years he's been known to us as Son of God spirit and in the Millennium he'll be son of David up on the throne we all know that who believe the scriptures now Jesus said just at the end of this church age that we're living in that the son of man would be revealed again in the same manner it was was as it was at Sodom watch how historically he gave it he said as it was in the days first of Noah how they were eating drinking marry and giving a marriage then he brought next the last to the son of man at Sodom because there he was dealing with Jews here at Sodom he's dealing with Gentiles there he drowned of all the water in judgment here at the Gentiles he burn them all at the day of Sodom that's right the Gentile World burnt there and so will it be when the Son of Man reveals there's not no more water but it be fire this time Jesus read from the same Genesis 23 that we read from when he read about Sodom now we admit the conditions that spoke of of the world condition of Sodom sodomites Sodom condition we everyone will say Amen to that we believe that all right in the spiritual condition of Lady oia the church natural we'll say Amen to that and and accept their signs we know that every sign is there the church is in lady OA we know that we know the world is in a Sodom condition is that right we'll accept that but what about the sign of Abraham the one waiting for the promised son that was another remember they had a Sodom back there they had their messenger and Abraham had a messenger to him Abraham was waiting day by day for a almost an impossible thing to happen Sarah 90 and him 100 according to the promise of God he was still waiting in the midst of all criticism he was waiting for that son so is a True Believer still waiting for that promised son to return notice just before the sun arrived there was a sign given him is not the sign of the coming son to be revealed to the Royal Seed of Abraham that's waiting for the royal son as s as it was to Father Abraham for the natural son that right Jesus said so here in St Luke 17:30 before this time come that the son of man would be revealed like he did in the days of Sodom before the destruction of Sodom now we're looking for a sign now let's take the conditions of time as it was in Sodom notice that all went out in sodomite the world I think one of the movie directors put on a picture not long ago and I got to see it that was Sodom if you ever see it there's nothing else on with that take a look at it it's a certainly a good picture of the United States today Hollywood just exactly same kind of dressing everything else that they did is right then big drunken spre and everything else a religious Cult of people so-called religious notice and Sodom had a wit and it was a fellow by the name of L which was just a nephew to to Abra Abraham now Abraham did not go down in Sodom he and his group he had a big group with him enough to fight off about a dozen Kings in their army so he had a big group with him and he was sitting out there under an oak tree one day when everything was going wrong for him nobody had anything to do with him but he was still holding on to that promise watch him closely before we closed while he was sitting there down down come three men walking to him two of them went down into Sodom and preached the gospel to them to come out to L is that right but L stayed with Abraham notice the one that stayed with Abraham was God himself the other two were Angel Messengers now down in Sodom had done no Miracles only smiting and blind and preaching the gospel always smites and blind I look at just said of that day there is a church natural always in trees as I said last night God is represented there was sodomites the latites and the Abraham ites it's in the same position tonight the world setting just like that let me ask you something look at this setting up Abraham called this man to talk to him Elohim the Hebrew word Elohim means the alls sufficient one the one that's the Eternal one Elohim God himself in the beginning Genesis one said in the beginning God take the Hebrew word there in Greek word rather in the beginning Elohim created heavens and earth here he is Genesis about 22 here he says again or about uh 20 he said and he called this man's name Elohim why did he do it God represented in a human flesh that sat down with Abraham and eat a c sandwich drinking some milk and eat some bread God himself and disappeared right before Abraham but he gave him a sign notice and that sign was that he had his back turned to the tent and remember Abraham his name was Abram a few days before that and Sarah was Sarah before that s a r r a then s a r a h and a r a m to a r a h m Abraham means father of Nations now watch real close here and we'll see the setting of The Hour That We're now living as Jesus told us to look for this setting we've seen all the rest of it right now let's see to the Royal Sea what setting they're supposed to see now this man said Abraham where is your wife Sarah and Abraham said she's in the tent behind you now he had never seen her how do you know that his name was Abraham how do you know her name was s amen Abraham where is your wife Sarah said she's in the tent behind you he said I I personal pronouns I am going to visit you according to the promise your wife's going to have that baby youve trusted me not I'm going to make it come to pass and Sarah in the tent behind e dropping or E dropping or what you call it listen to the tent she said laughed up her sleep and she said now I'm me on old woman like I am have pleasure of my Lord in him old too out there 100 years old W this hasn't happened for many many years and the man m a n sitting there eating in human flesh drinking and eating like an ordinary man with dust on his cloes and had dust on his feet and Abraham watched it off God himself looked around and he said why did Sarah laugh back in the tent saying this he knew could discern the thoughts of Sarah in the tent behind him is that right now when the Royal Seed of Abraham come on the earth what sign did he show son of man Simon came up to him one day Andrew brought him he said your name is Simon you're the son of Jonas he said be a believer out of me Philip went over and got theel come back said come see a man who we have we've found Jesus of Nazareth son of Joseph he said now wait a minute could anything good come out of that fanaticism he said come see so when Philip come up in the presence of Jesus with Nathaniel Jesus Jesus looked over at him and said behold an Israelite in whom there's no gu he said Rabbi when did you know me he said before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you said Rabbi th the Son of God you're the king of Israel and the little woman at the well in her immoral condition come up a little panoramic something like this to draw some water Jesus had send his disciples away to get fiddles when she come up to draw water he said bring me a drink woman she said it's not customary for you to say that we have segregation here now you Jews have nothing to do with us Samaritans we have nothing to do with you he said but woman if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask me for a drink I'd give you wat as you don't come here to draw he found where condition was what it was he said go get your husband and come here she said I don't have any husband he said you said the truth you've had five and the one you're living with now is not your she said sir I perceive that th the prophet we know when the Messiah cometh he'll show us these things Jesus said I am he on that she run into the City and said come see a man who's told me the things I've done isn't this the very Messiah watch he did that before the Jews and the Samaritans but never the Gentiles the Gentiles we people were heathens in them days the other nations packing a club on her back worshiping Idols we wasn't looking for no Messiah he only appears to those who's looking for him and we're supposed to be looking for him but those who claim to be looking for him the church itself when they seen that done they said he's a devil he's a fortune teller a be and Jesus said that sin would be forgiven them because he hadn't died yet but said someday the Holy Ghost will come and do the same thing and speak one word against it will never be forgiven that's this day where every word has to hang together speak a word against them never be forgiven in this world or the world to come that was the Royal Seed of Abraham and here that Royal seat of Abraham which come because of that identification of that man sitting there with Abraham come to prove it was the same God promis that in this day as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when he is revealing himself as son of man amen this is the day for the script to be fulfilled look at the setting we are today look at the church for the Son of God look at the Dismal day look at all the prophecies now a strange thing our business are doe them if the setting has to be like it's stopping there were three of them come along three outstanding men Sent From Heaven we'll admit that three of them one stay with Abraham they all started there but one stayed with Abraham the rest of them went out in Sodom is that right and Abra Abraham had a changed name from Abram to Abraham true not one time has the history Church of the world ever had an Advan to go to it with a name ending in h m to this day Billy g r a h a m is that right g r a h a m six letters a b r a h a m is seven letters but g r a h a m is six letters which is the world man see look what's went out there today is that Messengers from Heaven is there a man on Earth that's got repentance so preached so plainly as Billy Graham has there been a man that has had an effect upon the people like Billy Graham never has there been internationally a man of Billy Sunday and so forth here in the United States but Billy Grims know worldwide see where he's calling out of Sodom and he's got his companying party there with the Pentecostal church and or Roberts but what about the elect group what kind of sign are they supposed to see what are they supposed to have Hallelujah it shall be light in the evening time this [Applause] day this scripture is fulfilled this day God's promis is fulfilled we know that to be the truth he's here tonight as he was there got to preach it I said a while ago if you preach anything and it's a gospel truth then God's obligated to V is that true now if that be so let the god that wrote the word let the god that made the prophecy Let The God Who is God of the word come forth [Music] and prove that he's still God as Elijah went up on the mountain watching Elisha went watching Elijah he said I want a double potion and the manle that was on Elijah fell off on Elijah he walked down and double that blanket up and struck the river and said where is the god of Elijah and the same thing that happened
