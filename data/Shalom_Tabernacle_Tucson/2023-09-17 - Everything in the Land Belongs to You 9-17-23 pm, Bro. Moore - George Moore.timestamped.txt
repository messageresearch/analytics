[35:22] appreciate Brother Scott laboring
[35:24] through today and as he's recovering
[35:31] Genesis the 14th chapter I want to take
[35:34] a little subject a little further I
[35:36] talked about this on Wednesday night in
[35:38] Phoenix but I guess we could call this
[35:41] part two and want to go a little deeper
[35:43] into this uh thought here in Genesis the
[35:47] 14th chapter
[35:57] and the eighth verse
[36:03] and there went out the king of Sodom the
[36:06] king of Gomorrah and the king of adma
[36:08] and the king of Zebulon and the king of
[36:11] Bela the same as zor and they joined
[36:14] battle with them in the valley of sidom
[36:16] with cheddar lomer the king of Elam and
[36:19] with title king of Nations and with
[36:22] amphil king of sonar and arak the king
[36:26] of elisar Four Kings with five and the
[36:29] valley of sidom was full of slime pits
[36:31] and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled
[36:35] and fell there and they remained fled to
[36:39] the and they that remained fled to the
[36:41] mountain and they took all the goods of
[36:45] Sodom and Gomorrah and all their
[36:47] victuals and went their way and they
[36:49] took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt
[36:53] in Sodom and his goods and departed and
[36:56] there came one that had escaped and told
[36:58] Abram to Hebrew for he dwelt in the
[37:01] plane of mammary the Amorite the brother
[37:03] skull of the brother of Aynor and these
[37:06] were the in these were Confederate with
[37:09] Abram and when Abram heard that his
[37:11] brother was taken captive he armed his
[37:14] trained servants born in his own house
[37:16] 318 and pursued them unto Dan and he
[37:19] divided himself against them he and his
[37:22] servants by night and smote them and
[37:24] pursued them unto hoba which is on the
[37:27] left hand of Damascus
[37:29] and he brought back all the goods and
[37:31] also brought again his brother lot and
[37:34] his goods and the women also and the
[37:36] people and the king of Sodom went out to
[37:38] meet them after his return from the
[37:40] slaughter of Cheryl lomer and of the
[37:42] Kings which were with him at the valley
[37:44] of Shiva which is the King's Dale and
[37:47] Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth
[37:50] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[37:52] the most high God and he blessed him and
[37:55] said Blessed Be Abram of the most high
[37:57] god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he
[37:59] blessed and blessed be the most high God
[38:02] which hath delivered thine enemies into
[38:06] thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
[38:10] can you say Amen to the word of God

[38:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God
[38:50] bless you and you may be seated and I
[38:53] want to take a subject tonight of
[38:56] everything in the land belongs to you
[39:00] and I'll read you this quote from the
[39:02] way of a true prophet of God brother
[39:04] Branham said when as I said Abraham see
[39:09] he was in the promised land God gave it
[39:12] to him lot was taken by some Renegade
[39:15] Outlaws took away that was his nephew
[39:18] all right everything was in that land
[39:22] belonged to Abraham
[39:24] so he wasn't a warrior he never did
[39:27] fight he didn't have any warriors with
[39:30] him he had some servants but when he
[39:32] seen that something the devil had come
[39:34] and robbed him of something that was a
[39:37] promise to him he armed his servants and
[39:40] took an arm himself he didn't know how
[39:43] he was going to overcome this whole
[39:45] company of Kings just a handful of
[39:47] servants but God told him how to do it
[39:50] and he divided himself and slaughtered
[39:53] the Kings and come back triumphant
[39:55] why he laid his faith upon God's promise
[40:00] that everything that was in the land was
[40:03] his and lot was a part of it that's
[40:06] right was a part of the land oh my and
[40:09] there he met Melchizedek after the
[40:11] battle was over could you just see
[40:14] Abraham coming up the road he didn't
[40:16] know he was a warrior but he knew then
[40:18] he was yes sir and he met the one who
[40:22] gave the promise Melchizedek now Saints
[40:25] I'll tell you everything that was in
[40:27] that land belonged to Abraham is that
[40:29] what brother Branham said and we find
[40:31] that Abraham was minding his own
[40:33] business he was in the valley of mammary
[40:36] and he was minding his own business and
[40:38] these kings came in and they took Sodom
[40:40] and Gomorrah captive and when they did
[40:42] they took lot away with them and Saints
[40:45] that's where they messed up right there
[40:46] because they took something that
[40:48] belonged to Abraham
[40:50] amen and keep in mind saints that Lots
[40:53] was down in the wrong place he was
[40:55] amongst the wrong crowd he was in with
[40:58] the wrong company and he deserved
[41:00] everything that was coming at him but it
[41:02] didn't matter because he was still a
[41:03] part of Abraham
[41:05] amen and he said in a message God's word
[41:08] calls for a total separation from
[41:11] unbelief brother Brown said all these
[41:13] Believers as we could go on for hours
[41:15] all these were like a bunch of change in
[41:17] your out of your pocket in God's hands
[41:19] he said you pull out a bunch of change
[41:21] and there's pennies nickels dimes
[41:24] quarters half dollars dollar all in
[41:26] coins and that's what the world is in
[41:28] God's hands there are some people that
[41:30] just can have a Penny's worth of it and
[41:33] God can only use them in a penny way
[41:35] that's all they can buy don't reject
[41:37] them brother Branham said and it's like
[41:40] what brother Israel is preaching on this
[41:41] morning if you run into somebody at the
[41:43] grocery store and they tell you that the
[41:45] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has saved
[41:47] them and and has delivered them then
[41:49] praise God don't
[41:51] don't reject them brother Branham said
[41:53] if they can't believe the real truth
[41:55] don't turn them down don't kick them out
[41:56] and say they're not of it because God
[41:58] uses pennies sometimes
[42:01] and lot was just a penny and Abraham was
[42:04] a silver dollar so it taken a hundred
[42:06] lots to make an Abraham and so will it
[42:09] take a hundred carnal uh Believers will
[42:12] never stand in the presence of a genuine
[42:15] Christian that's separated from the
[42:18] carnal things of the world living in
[42:20] Christ Jesus where the word now listen
[42:24] Saints where the word can flow through
[42:27] them and I'm here to say tonight saints
[42:29] that this should be our goal is that we
[42:31] live a Christian Life That's separated
[42:34] from the carnal things of the world
[42:36] living in Christ Jesus where the word
[42:38] can flow through US amen that's got to
[42:41] be our goal today is to have the word of
[42:44] God flowing through us it's got to be
[42:46] our our motive our objective is to have
[42:49] the word of God flowing through us today
[42:51] see the Lord separated that's got to be
[42:55] your desire today saints that the Lord
[42:57] separates you from the carnal things of
[43:00] the world and that the word of God flow
[43:02] through you is that your desire today
[43:04] Saints say it ain't just about what
[43:06] you're doing it ain't just about your
[43:08] life but you're not just standing for
[43:09] yourself you're standing for your
[43:11] children you're standing for your
[43:12] husband you're standing for your wife
[43:14] you're standing for your loved ones
[43:17] you're standing for your church you're
[43:19] standing for your family you're standing
[43:21] for your community you're standing today
[43:23] it ain't just about you it's about
[43:25] everybody you come in contact with it's
[43:27] about the people you're related to it's
[43:29] about
[43:30] and we got to get to the point to where
[43:33] the word of God can flow through us
[43:35] because we can have an impact on those
[43:37] around us you create an atmosphere
[43:41] that has an impact on those around you
[43:43] so it's not just about you that's
[43:45] selfish real Christianity brother Brown
[43:47] said is living for others
[43:50] amen so we're not just living for a
[43:52] sample we're living for those that's
[43:54] around us we're living for those that's
[43:55] coming in contact with us and we got to
[43:57] have the word of God flowing through us
[43:59] and when they see us they can say
[44:01] there's something different about that
[44:03] brother there's something different
[44:04] about that sister
[44:07] there's a presence about them there's an
[44:09] anointing about it there's something
[44:10] about them that I like to be around I
[44:13] want to be around it I want more of it
[44:16] yeah
[44:17] amen
[44:19] and we're standing for something tonight
[44:21] we're standing for a message tonight
[44:23] we're standing for our brother tonight
[44:25] amen turn to your neighbor and say I'm
[44:28] standing for you
[44:29] see brother Brown talked about that that
[44:32] train car about the seal being placed on
[44:35] the outside of it and he said it
[44:37] couldn't be placed on the outside until
[44:39] everything else on the inside was just
[44:41] right
[44:42] amen and he said in a token message he
[44:45] said full obedience to the whole word of
[44:48] God
[44:49] will entitle you
[44:52] to the token
[44:54] full obedience not the part of it as far
[44:57] as your denomination goes but all of it
[45:02] full obedience to the word which is
[45:04] Christ
[45:06] brings you into Christ now what if you
[45:09] was just all in but your feet hanging
[45:11] out
[45:12] what if you was all in with your hands
[45:15] hanging out most all of us sin but the
[45:18] heart hanging out see see the hearts in
[45:21] the world yet see but we don't do that
[45:23] full complete obedience puts you and the
[45:28] word one you believe it every bit all of
[45:32] you it's it's in you and now you watch
[45:35] it working through you man
[45:39] we need to become one with the word
[45:42] because we got people that need saving
[45:45] Saints we need to come one with the word
[45:49] because we need the ability to apply the
[45:52] token in their life
[45:56] and if we are one with the word we're
[45:58] entitled to the token
[46:01] is that right so our prayer has got to
[46:04] be Lord separate us from the world
[46:08] separate us from the things of the world
[46:10] because I got family I got friends
[46:13] that needs you Lord I separate me let
[46:17] the word flow through me Lord separate
[46:19] me from the world so that the word can
[46:21] flow through my life because my family
[46:24] needs you my children needs you my
[46:26] friends needs you the people that work
[46:28] needs you and I need you Lord to flow
[46:31] through me
[46:32] [Music]
[46:34] amen
[46:36] separate us from the things that were
[46:38] Saints this ain't no time to let the
[46:40] world creep into our lives
[46:43] it's too late to have the world creeping
[46:46] into our lives it's no time to see how
[46:49] close to the edge we can get
[46:52] amen that's not who we won't drive in
[46:54] The Chariot we won't stay as close to
[46:56] the wall as we can
[46:58] come on somebody tonight
[47:00] it's no time to see how close we can get
[47:02] it's no time to have one foot out in the
[47:04] world it's no time this is a time of
[47:06] separation
[47:09] not separation from Brotherhood we got
[47:11] enough of that going on not separation
[47:13] for Fellowship we got too much of that
[47:15] but separation from the things of this
[47:19] world
[47:20] so that the word of God can flow through
[47:23] Us Saint sometimes it feels like we're
[47:25] losing the battle against worldlyism in
[47:28] this message Saints amen it seems like
[47:31] it's creeping in from all sides Saints
[47:33] it looks it looks like they're close
[47:35] keep getting tighter
[47:38] it looks like the dress keeps getting
[47:40] more and modest it looks like the paint
[47:42] keeps getting thicker it looks like the
[47:44] men keep keep cowering down like women
[47:53] well Saints men got to be men men got to
[47:56] leave their home man
[47:58] gotta work man got to provide man got to
[48:01] take care of the families men got to be
[48:03] a support to their wife a support to
[48:06] their children
[48:07] yes
[48:11] amen and we got men that you're just
[48:14] turned into whether and have no control
[48:15] over their own flesh just to pass the
[48:18] least resistance that's the way they go
[48:19] but thanks that ain't being a man being
[48:22] a man is doing the right thing whether
[48:24] you feel like it or not
[48:26] then being a man is going to work
[48:27] whether you feel like it or not
[48:36] it ain't time to be one with the world
[48:38] it's time to separate from the things of
[48:40] the world it's time to separate from
[48:42] worldly amusements worldly
[48:44] entertainments I know it's hard
[48:45] preaching tonight but it's time to
[48:46] separate from the things of the world
[48:49] Saints amen because the guy takes full
[48:51] obedience to the word of God to apply
[48:54] the token
[48:57] and we don't want to see how much more
[48:59] worldly we can get we won't see how much
[49:01] cleaner we can get we'll see how much
[49:03] closer we can get
[49:06] amen
[49:08] amen we got a
[49:10] we got to take care of God first and
[49:12] then and then our family next and then
[49:14] ourselves last Saints
[49:16] is that right
[49:18] hey man we got to have that kind of
[49:20] character in our lives and the message
[49:22] cries out against these things but
[49:23] people go on like like brother Ram
[49:25] didn't say it
[49:30] but he did say it he cried out against
[49:32] it
[49:33] amen but but you don't hear a lot of
[49:35] crying out against it anymore but but
[49:37] since we got to separate from the things
[49:40] of the world it ain't no time to let a
[49:42] ball game or a TV program or some kind
[49:45] of entertainment keep us out of the
[49:46] house of the Lord
[49:48] it ain't no time for that it ain't no
[49:51] time to let things come more important
[49:52] to us on Sunday they're coming to church
[49:54] it ain't no time for it it ain't no time
[49:57] to have no energy for church on
[49:59] Wednesday but we got energy for a TV
[50:01] program
[50:03] it ain't no time for it since it's time
[50:05] to separate from the things of the world
[50:10] brother Brown's sitting in unconditional
[50:11] Covenant that God made with his people
[50:13] he said God wants separators separate
[50:17] yourself that's right God always calls
[50:20] for separation separate from your
[50:22] Kindred from your people separate from
[50:24] your Associates separate from your
[50:26] habits separate from everything and come
[50:29] out and stand alone with God
[50:34] that's where the first man was called by
[50:36] election that's where the last man's
[50:38] been called to do the same thing
[50:40] separate yourself from the associates
[50:42] and the things of the world and come out
[50:44] from among them and be separate he said
[50:46] then I'll bless you how many of you want
[50:49] to be blessed tonight
[50:52] he said if you want a blessing separate
[50:55] yourself from the things of the world
[50:59] oh yeah
[51:00] now we're gonna have to go through some
[51:02] homes to do that
[51:05] you got to go in and look around
[51:07] and say is this profiting me or is this
[51:09] hindering me is this bringing me closer
[51:11] to the Lord or is it driving me further
[51:13] away
[51:15] and then you go to the next room and do
[51:17] it again and go to the next room and do
[51:19] it again and say is this a help or a
[51:21] hindrance
[51:23] because if it's not bringing us closer
[51:25] to the lord it's pulling us further away
[51:27] you can't remain neutral
[51:28] [Music]
[51:30] and so you see people many times in
[51:34] churches and different places and and
[51:37] then they claim to believe the message
[51:38] many times and you wonder what they ever
[51:41] really see do they ever really see it do
[51:43] they ever really get a hold of something
[51:45] do they have that Revelation it seems
[51:48] like they never really sell out it seems
[51:50] like they're just they're always around
[51:52] but they don't ever really sell out and
[51:55] you wonder why don't they sell out why
[51:57] don't they give it all the gods
[52:00] they may come to church or just maybe
[52:02] they're just not as consecrated as as we
[52:04] think they are to be or or maybe they
[52:06] just don't maybe they just don't
[52:08] understand what we think they should but
[52:10] Saints I'll tell you
[52:12] some are pennies
[52:14] and some are nickels
[52:16] and some are dimes
[52:18] and summer quarters
[52:20] and some are silver dollars
[52:23] but let me caution you
[52:25] that I'm not really interested tonight
[52:28] and trying to classify who everybody is
[52:33] I'm not really interested in trying to
[52:36] say you're a carnal believer or you're a
[52:38] a natural believer you're a spiritual
[52:41] believer or you're a foolish version or
[52:43] your version I don't know since I've
[52:45] been wrong too many times I've seen too
[52:47] many people that I thought wasn't going
[52:49] to make it and something snapped and
[52:51] something happened and they rose up in
[52:53] the in the power of God and live
[52:55] differently
[52:58] I've seen God do it too many times I've
[53:00] seen him change people
[53:03] I've seen people go for years just
[53:06] living a certain kind of life and then
[53:08] all of a sudden something set fire
[53:11] and everything changed so it ain't how
[53:13] you start it's how you finish I don't
[53:15] know how anybody's gonna end up you
[53:17] don't know how anybody is going to end
[53:18] up
[53:20] that's all in God's hands amen so we
[53:23] don't give up on nobody we just believe
[53:25] for everybody
[53:28] I've seen it go the other way too I've
[53:30] seen what I thought was real Believers
[53:32] and they're not around no more today
[53:36] amen those things are up for God it's up
[53:39] to us just to preach the word
[53:41] it's up to us just to testify
[53:44] we don't we don't put nobody in we don't
[53:46] take nobody out
[53:48] those things are all God's business
[53:51] amen now Lots brother Brown said was a
[53:53] carnal believer
[53:55] but he was still a believer
[53:57] now the Bible said that the sins of
[53:59] Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily
[54:04] is that right Saints
[54:06] but he was hanging around with the wrong
[54:08] crowd he was hanging around with the
[54:10] wrong people and the people that you're
[54:12] around have an influence on you
[54:15] and it doesn't matter how strong a
[54:17] Believer you are it doesn't matter how
[54:19] much of the message you know if you hang
[54:21] around the wrong people it'll have a
[54:23] negative impact on your testimony
[54:26] is that right Saints it doesn't matter
[54:29] it's me you anybody if you're around the
[54:32] wrong people it's gonna have an effect
[54:34] on you
[54:36] and lot was around the wrong crowd down
[54:39] in Sodom
[54:41] and Saints if you get around the wrong
[54:43] people it'll have a negative effect
[54:45] consequently you cannot get around Holy
[54:48] Ghost Field Bible believing Christians
[54:50] and it not have an influence on you
[54:55] is that right if you want to be Godly
[54:57] hang around godly people
[55:00] if you want to be worldly hang around
[55:02] worldly people
[55:04] and it'll rub off on you
[55:07] is that right Saints that's why we have
[55:10] to assemble ourselves together
[55:13] amen this might be the only time all
[55:15] week long that we're around other
[55:17] believers
[55:18] this might be the only opportunity that
[55:21] you have to shake the hand of a brother
[55:23] or sister and tell them God bless you
[55:27] once you leave this place you might not
[55:30] come across another believer until you
[55:32] come back here
[55:37] amen
[55:38] that's why we assemble together more not
[55:40] less
[55:42] amen
[55:44] and we find also
[55:47] that we don't need to look around
[55:50] and try to size everybody up
[55:52] say
[55:53] pennies nickels dimes quarters okay that
[55:55] brother there looks like about 17 cents
[55:59] a sister over there
[56:01] by 37 cents
[56:06] see we could get a critical spirit on us
[56:09] where we're just looking around
[56:12] trying to find everything that's wrong
[56:14] with everybody
[56:15] trying to pick on everything that
[56:17] everybody's doing wrong
[56:20] is that right Saints
[56:22] now the Bible said that the sins of
[56:24] Sodom vexed slots righteous Soul daily
[56:27] another thing brother Branham said is
[56:29] Lord had wife trouble
[56:34] always gets quiet here brother Ezekiel
[56:37] he said he had wild trouble
[56:39] I'll tell you Saints if you got a good
[56:42] wife
[56:44] you sisters if you got a good husband
[56:47] that's a huge blessing
[56:50] the best thing God could give a man is a
[56:52] good wife outside of his salvation
[56:56] most important decision we can make
[56:58] outside of our Salvation is who we're
[57:01] going to spend our life with
[57:03] brother bear said the sins of Sodom
[57:05] vexed his soul only his wife wouldn't
[57:08] permit him to do anything about it
[57:11] she belonged to all the clubs and things
[57:15] and see lot had got himself into quite a
[57:17] predicament he was in quite a situation
[57:20] but it didn't matter because he was a
[57:22] part of Abraham
[57:24] and everything that was in that land
[57:27] belonged to Abraham
[57:29] and because he was a part of Abraham
[57:31] think about it when the destroying
[57:33] Angels Came to take care of Sodom they
[57:36] couldn't even touch Sodom until April
[57:39] until lot left because Lots was a part
[57:42] of Abraham
[57:44] they couldn't even destroy it until they
[57:47] got lot out of there not because lot was
[57:49] lot but because Lots was a part of
[57:51] Abraham you remember when Sarah laughed
[57:55] within herself brother Branham said that
[57:56] that angel would have would have took
[57:58] her life right then but he couldn't do
[58:00] it because Sarah was a part of Abraham
[58:03] that's what it means for you to be a
[58:06] believer tonight that's what it means
[58:08] Saints for you to serve the Lord that's
[58:11] what it means for you to live this
[58:13] message that's what it means for the
[58:15] word of God to flow through you
[58:19] amen
[58:21] because you're a part of Abraham
[58:25] amen
[58:27] and see Saints you might have family
[58:29] today that's got themselves in a similar
[58:32] predicament
[58:33] we've all got family that's got
[58:35] themselves I'm sure in quite a quite a
[58:38] mess quite a bad shape and it maybe it
[58:40] doesn't look like there's any way they
[58:41] can get out of it
[58:43] we've all got maybe we got children
[58:45] that's gotten in a bad shape you don't
[58:47] look it looks like they're so far gone
[58:48] you don't understand how God's ever
[58:50] going to bring them back
[58:53] but Saints everything that is in this
[58:57] land belongs to you
[59:02] because you're the Seed of Abraham and
[59:04] the Seed of Abraham is heirs with him
[59:07] according to the promise
[59:09] everything that's in the land belongs to
[59:12] you just like the The Prodigal Son in
[59:15] Luke 15 the man that we all know the
[59:17] story I talked about this the other
[59:19] night in in Phoenix but we we talk we
[59:22] know of the story of the man that had
[59:24] his inheritance given to him early and
[59:26] he went out with that inheritance and he
[59:29] blew it all he spent it all on worldly
[59:31] riots it's living and he found himself
[59:35] broke and then a famine hit the land and
[59:38] he found himself so low until he was in
[59:42] a Hog Pen
[59:44] and his job was to feed the swines and
[59:48] he was in such a condition
[59:51] that he didn't even have his own food to
[59:53] eat and the Bible said that he was
[59:56] eating the corn husk
[59:59] That was supposed to be fed to the swine
[1:00:03] that's how low he had gotten he was in
[1:00:06] the shape of eating a corn husk and I
[1:00:10] told him the other night Saints I'm not
[1:00:12] a farmer I don't know a lot about corn
[1:00:14] but I do know that the corn husk is the
[1:00:17] part of the tamale that you throw away
[1:00:23] that ain't what you eat
[1:00:26] now I don't know about farming but I
[1:00:28] know a lot about tamales pastor
[1:00:31] and I know
[1:00:33] that you throw the corn husk away
[1:00:36] but he was trying to eat that
[1:00:38] and he was in such a low estate now many
[1:00:41] of us might say to the prodigal son or
[1:00:44] to lot well you deserve what you got
[1:00:46] because the mess you're in is the mess
[1:00:48] you made and Saint sits that way a lot
[1:00:50] of times most of the time the problems
[1:00:53] that we're dealing with are problems we
[1:00:54] created ourselves most of the time the
[1:00:57] problems that we fight are things that
[1:00:59] we've done by the decisions that we have
[1:01:01] made
[1:01:04] and you might say well he deserved it
[1:01:06] but I'll tell you saints that according
[1:01:08] to the word of God we all deserved it
[1:01:12] Corinthians the book of correction he
[1:01:14] said all of us deserve death because we
[1:01:17] are rebellions against God correct
[1:01:19] notice we all deserve dying but God is
[1:01:23] so merciful till he shouldn't never
[1:01:25] thought of us but he's so merciful till
[1:01:28] he took the sins of every one of us and
[1:01:30] struck it upon his own beloved Son
[1:01:34] Christ that we might not perish but
[1:01:37] would have eternal life and you say well
[1:01:39] say you say well I'm a pretty good
[1:01:41] person I I've lived a message all all of
[1:01:44] my life that's good but you still had to
[1:01:46] have your sins taken from you you say
[1:01:47] well I've been a pretty good person I've
[1:01:49] done a lot of good works and that's good
[1:01:51] but you still have to have your sins
[1:01:53] taken from you
[1:01:57] and I'll tell you Saints we all would be
[1:02:00] in that same situation tonight except
[1:02:02] for the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:06] we all would be in that same situation
[1:02:08] except for what God did for each and
[1:02:11] every one of us it's not by my own will
[1:02:13] that I'm here tonight it's because God
[1:02:16] who is rich in Mercy call me out of this
[1:02:18] world
[1:02:22] and I'll tell you Saints we got to have
[1:02:24] a little bit of Grace in this day and
[1:02:26] age for people
[1:02:28] we got to have some love for people we
[1:02:31] got to understand that we never know
[1:02:33] what people are going through we never
[1:02:35] know the battles people are fighting we
[1:02:38] never know the trouble they're in we
[1:02:40] never know what's going on when they
[1:02:41] leave this church you don't know what
[1:02:43] happens when they leave here you don't
[1:02:45] know what they're fighting before they
[1:02:46] get back
[1:02:48] you don't know what people deal with
[1:02:50] before they come into work
[1:02:52] you don't know what they deal with in
[1:02:53] their homes you don't know what they
[1:02:55] deal with at school we never know what's
[1:02:57] going on behind the scenes
[1:02:59] and we got to have a little Grace this
[1:03:02] is a deceitful age people make mistakes
[1:03:06] the devil sets traps for everybody and
[1:03:09] we get caught from time to time come on
[1:03:11] somebody we get caught from time to time
[1:03:13] it's so deceiving it's so polluted it's
[1:03:16] so wretched it's so vile it's almost
[1:03:19] impossible outside of the Holy Ghost you
[1:03:22] can't keep yourself pure
[1:03:27] you can't keep yourself it's God keeping
[1:03:30] us
[1:03:32] so we got to have a little bit of Grace
[1:03:34] now we talked about it the other night
[1:03:36] it's a Bible study in Galatians 1 it
[1:03:39] says Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:03:41] fault ye which are spiritual is that us
[1:03:44] Saints is the bride spiritual
[1:03:48] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[1:03:52] one in the spirit of meekness
[1:03:54] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:03:57] tempted amen
[1:04:00] see we all
[1:04:01] are not above temptation
[1:04:04] we're all not above making a mistake
[1:04:06] and we got to have a little Grace
[1:04:11] come on somebody tonight
[1:04:13] Brother Band listen is the message of
[1:04:15] Grace
[1:04:17] he says but now
[1:04:19] according to the prophecy there will
[1:04:21] come The Headstone and I want you to
[1:04:24] notice when that headstone comes the
[1:04:26] prince that's going to cry out the
[1:04:29] message will cry Grace Grace
[1:04:34] for it's by Grace were saved not that of
[1:04:37] Works lest any man should boast and the
[1:04:40] message of Grace has been trampled on
[1:04:42] the feet of man until it's become a
[1:04:45] disgrace
[1:04:46] say we don't believe anything goes we
[1:04:49] don't believe in worldly living we don't
[1:04:51] believe that just let everybody do what
[1:04:53] they want to and God's going to save you
[1:04:55] we don't believe that that you just can
[1:04:57] get by with anything God's a good God we
[1:04:59] don't believe that's TV preaching
[1:05:05] amen but we believe that if somebody
[1:05:08] makes a mistake there is Grace for them
[1:05:13] we believe that if somebody comes up
[1:05:15] shorts they can have Grace
[1:05:18] we believe that God forgives us we
[1:05:21] believe that if you ask God God will do
[1:05:23] that for you
[1:05:25] we don't believe in making it a disgrace
[1:05:27] but we do believe that every one of us
[1:05:31] is potentially fixing to fall in some
[1:05:34] way
[1:05:37] none of us is above it
[1:05:39] and there's Grace if we make a mistake
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:44] brother Bram said it's the disgrace some
[1:05:46] of them runs out into eternal security
[1:05:48] some runs out into everything but the
[1:05:51] true message of Grace Remains the Same
[1:05:55] and that's where Satan tries to knock it
[1:05:57] out from the church but it's the grace
[1:05:59] of God that we're all saved by can you
[1:06:02] say Amen to that then why let me skip
[1:06:05] down a little bit then why could anyone
[1:06:07] criticize and say grace is wrong that
[1:06:10] we're saved by works we're saved by
[1:06:12] grace through faith not by works works
[1:06:15] shows that you have been saved but what
[1:06:18] saves you is the grace of God grace
[1:06:20] saves you Grace is what God does for you
[1:06:25] works is what you do for God to show
[1:06:29] appreciation of what God did for you
[1:06:34] but by grace
[1:06:36] are you saved
[1:06:39] what a beautiful example of The Prodigal
[1:06:42] Son
[1:06:43] the Bible sentence Luke 15 17 that when
[1:06:46] it came to himself
[1:06:49] now Saints I want you to remember he was
[1:06:52] in the pig pen when it come to itself
[1:06:55] he was eating corn husk when it came to
[1:06:58] himself he was in a famished backslidden
[1:07:01] decrepit dirty rotten condition when it
[1:07:06] came to itself
[1:07:07] foreign
[1:07:08] and I remember the day that I came to
[1:07:11] myself
[1:07:13] I remember the hour
[1:07:15] when I came to myself
[1:07:18] I remember the time when God reached
[1:07:20] down into that same Hog Pen
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:24] and pulled me out
[1:07:27] I remember that day and I believe that
[1:07:30] if he does it for me he can do it for
[1:07:33] anybody
[1:07:35] I believe that the same God that saves
[1:07:38] me can save my family I believe the same
[1:07:42] God that protects me can protect my
[1:07:45] children
[1:07:46] I believe the same God that came got me
[1:07:49] in the whole pen can't come get my my
[1:07:52] friends at work
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:56] I believe the same God that God me can
[1:07:59] come get the man on the streets
[1:08:02] I believe the same God that got me can
[1:08:05] come get the girl at the grocery store
[1:08:08] I believe the same God that keeps his
[1:08:11] hand on us can't keep his hand on our
[1:08:14] young people
[1:08:20] and I remember when I came to myself I
[1:08:23] remember the hour everything changed
[1:08:28] and this young man was sitting in a hog
[1:08:30] pan eating corn husk
[1:08:32] in the mud
[1:08:34] in the manure
[1:08:36] and he said you know what
[1:08:38] my father
[1:08:40] has got slaves that's living better than
[1:08:43] I am
[1:08:45] he said it'd be better
[1:08:47] to be a servant in My Father's House
[1:08:51] it'd be better to be a slave in my
[1:08:55] father's house than to be sitting out
[1:08:57] here in this manure pile eating these
[1:08:59] corn husks
[1:09:04] see it's better to be a doormat in the
[1:09:07] house of God
[1:09:09] than to dwell in the tits with the
[1:09:10] wicked
[1:09:12] and he said I'll arise and I'll go to my
[1:09:14] family and I'll say in Him Father I
[1:09:16] sinned against heaven and before Thee I
[1:09:19] like the approach here Saints I like the
[1:09:23] repentance I like that attitude I like
[1:09:26] the way he went see say so many times we
[1:09:29] see people they try to serve the Lord
[1:09:31] but they don't ever really repent they
[1:09:34] don't ever really feel sorry for the
[1:09:36] life that they lived they don't feel
[1:09:38] sorry for the sinus in their life this
[1:09:40] man knew he'd messed up he knew he
[1:09:43] needed help
[1:09:45] he was willing to admit that
[1:09:48] and he said I'm no more worthy to be
[1:09:50] called thy son
[1:09:52] but make me as one of the hard servants
[1:09:54] that he rose he came to his father but
[1:09:57] when he was yet a great way off his
[1:09:59] father saw him
[1:10:01] and had compassion
[1:10:03] and ran and fell on his neck and kissed
[1:10:06] him
[1:10:07] and his son said father I'll sinned
[1:10:09] against heaven and in our sights and I'm
[1:10:12] no more worthy oh God
[1:10:15] to be called thy son
[1:10:17] is that the way you feel tonight's
[1:10:19] Saints I'm no more worthy to be called
[1:10:22] thy son
[1:10:24] but the father said to his servant bring
[1:10:26] forth the best robe
[1:10:29] and put it on him
[1:10:31] and put a ring on his hand and choose on
[1:10:34] his feet and bring hither the fatted
[1:10:37] calf
[1:10:38] and kill it and let us eat and be merry
[1:10:41] for my son was dead and is alive again
[1:10:44] he was lost and is found and they began
[1:10:47] to be merry see Saints God what
[1:10:52] he deserved everything that he got he
[1:10:56] deserved to be in that Hog Pen but his
[1:10:58] father had Grace on him his father had
[1:11:01] mercy on it no matter what he done he
[1:11:04] was still his son
[1:11:06] and he had Grace for him
[1:11:09] amen
[1:11:12] I remember the day when he had Grace for
[1:11:14] me
[1:11:16] I remember the hour when that Grace
[1:11:19] changed my life
[1:11:23] now we find back it a lot
[1:11:26] that lot had got itself into a bad
[1:11:29] situation his life was in shambles his
[1:11:31] life was kind of a mess but he still
[1:11:34] belonged to Abraham and brothers and
[1:11:37] sisters there might be people in our
[1:11:39] lives that have got their self into a
[1:11:41] bad situation their life might be a mess
[1:11:43] too but they still belong to you
[1:11:46] their life might be a mess but that's
[1:11:49] your mess
[1:11:52] because everything that's in the land
[1:11:55] belongs to you
[1:11:57] your children might not be where they
[1:11:58] want them to be they might not be doing
[1:12:00] like you want them to do but they're
[1:12:02] yours they belong to you and everything
[1:12:06] that's in the land belongs to you
[1:12:10] your family might not be where you want
[1:12:12] it to be but it's your family it belongs
[1:12:15] to you
[1:12:19] and they might have done things to
[1:12:20] deserve the mesitarian but it doesn't
[1:12:23] matter because they're a part of you
[1:12:26] they're still yours and you still apply
[1:12:30] the token to their life
[1:12:33] just like Abraham was moved with
[1:12:35] compassion for his nephew we got to be
[1:12:38] moved for compassion with the church has
[1:12:41] to be moved with compassion
[1:12:46] say Saints this message is my family
[1:12:51] this message is the greatest people in
[1:12:55] all the world
[1:12:57] there are no people nowhere on Earth
[1:13:00] better than the brothers and sisters in
[1:13:02] this message it's the greatest people
[1:13:04] I've ever been associated with it's the
[1:13:07] greatest people I've ever been around
[1:13:08] and I know we got problems and I know we
[1:13:11] got faults and I know people make
[1:13:13] mistakes but they're still the best of
[1:13:15] the best the cream or the crop
[1:13:17] and you can't get no better than the
[1:13:20] people in this message
[1:13:23] and I know there's disagreements and I
[1:13:25] know there's bickering and I know
[1:13:27] there's trials and I know churches don't
[1:13:28] get along but Saints they're still my
[1:13:31] family
[1:13:33] they're still my family
[1:13:35] and we might get into it in the backyard
[1:13:38] but if you get around to the front yard
[1:13:41] and you need a hand I'm gonna be there
[1:13:43] to help
[1:13:46] now brother Brown said there was 10 of
[1:13:47] them branhams and they fought like cats
[1:13:50] and dogs in the backyard but if you got
[1:13:52] around to the front yard and you started
[1:13:54] messing with one of them Brands you're
[1:13:56] gonna get all 10 of them on you
[1:13:59] and he said that's the way the church is
[1:14:02] amen I'll tell you Saints I know we got
[1:14:04] disagreements I know we got problems but
[1:14:07] we got to have each other's backs
[1:14:14] we got to have each other's backs
[1:14:18] there's so much evil in the world today
[1:14:21] and I see people and I see churches and
[1:14:23] I see that we may not agree with
[1:14:25] everybody's Doctrine
[1:14:28] but Saints I'll tell you when you look
[1:14:29] around and you see the attack that's
[1:14:31] coming against these churches in the
[1:14:33] message today
[1:14:35] I may not agree with them
[1:14:37] but I don't want to see that
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:41] I don't like these websites
[1:14:43] it's cropping up
[1:14:46] to cause problems for these churches
[1:14:49] amen that's all right it's that church
[1:14:51] but it might be this one next
[1:14:55] I don't like these news articles and
[1:14:58] these interviews that's against these
[1:15:00] message churches I don't want to see
[1:15:02] that I may not agree with them and they
[1:15:05] might have done things to deserve some
[1:15:06] of that but I still don't want to see
[1:15:08] them come against
[1:15:11] they're still my brothers and sisters
[1:15:13] and I still got their back
[1:15:18] and if they need my help I'm going to be
[1:15:21] there
[1:15:22] if there's something I can do I'm gonna
[1:15:24] do it
[1:15:25] because everything that's in this land
[1:15:27] belongs to me
[1:15:33] now I want you to notice
[1:15:35] that lot had gotten taken away
[1:15:38] and these Kings had come down and they'd
[1:15:40] already defeated five Kings in their
[1:15:42] armies and they took Sodom and they took
[1:15:45] Gomorrah and they took lot and it took
[1:15:48] all of his stuff and it left and Abraham
[1:15:51] was faced with the tax the task of going
[1:15:54] and rescuing lot he was moved with
[1:15:57] compassion for his nephew
[1:16:01] and lot brother Brown said that Abraham
[1:16:03] wasn't a warrior
[1:16:05] and he didn't have any Warriors working
[1:16:07] for him
[1:16:09] he said he took 318 of his own servants
[1:16:12] and he armed him and then he armed
[1:16:15] himself I like that Abraham wasn't
[1:16:17] scared to get his own hands dirty
[1:16:21] he didn't just send his folks he went
[1:16:24] with him
[1:16:29] and he went out and and what I like
[1:16:31] about that is we don't read in the Bible
[1:16:33] of anywhere
[1:16:35] that God came to Abraham in a vision or
[1:16:39] and said Abraham go get lot or any time
[1:16:42] we don't read in there where the Angels
[1:16:45] appeared to Abraham at that particular
[1:16:47] time and said go get lot now we do know
[1:16:49] brother Branham said that God showed him
[1:16:51] how to do it
[1:16:54] but we don't see him anywhere where
[1:16:56] there was an audible voice from God that
[1:16:58] spoke to Abraham or where an angel told
[1:17:00] him how to do it or or where a staircase
[1:17:02] rolled down from heaven and told him how
[1:17:04] to do it he didn't do any of that but
[1:17:06] lot was was part of Abraham and Abraham
[1:17:09] already had the promise that everything
[1:17:13] in that land belonged to him
[1:17:17] is that right Saints and see sometimes
[1:17:20] brothers and sisters When Trials come we
[1:17:22] begin to pray we begin to seek God and
[1:17:25] we should and we're waiting on the
[1:17:27] leadership of the Lord but sometimes
[1:17:29] we're looking for a supernatural sign or
[1:17:31] we're looking for an audible voice and
[1:17:33] we want to see a vision or we want to
[1:17:35] dream a dream when God has already give
[1:17:38] us his word
[1:17:42] amen
[1:17:43] see Abraham acted on the word of God
[1:17:45] that he already had God had already told
[1:17:48] him that that land was his and
[1:17:50] everything in it was his and he went
[1:17:52] upon that word
[1:17:54] brother Brown said and why Christ speak
[1:17:57] he said there's no place to retreat in
[1:18:00] God
[1:18:03] oh come on
[1:18:04] there's no place to retreat in God he
[1:18:08] said go forward
[1:18:09] he said the doctor says it's cancer go
[1:18:13] forward it says it's TB go forward
[1:18:17] if the devil says you can't give this up
[1:18:20] go forward
[1:18:22] if your home says you're going to be a
[1:18:24] fanatic go forward the church turns you
[1:18:27] out go forward
[1:18:30] there's no retreating back go forward
[1:18:32] speak and go forward speak what his word
[1:18:36] and go forward the saith the Lord and
[1:18:40] move on
[1:18:42] amen Saints if you get sick the word has
[1:18:47] already told you you're healed
[1:18:52] amen
[1:18:55] you're the Seed of Abraham Saints and a
[1:18:58] Seed of Abraham is heirs with Abraham
[1:19:01] according to the promise everything in
[1:19:04] this land right here belongs to you
[1:19:07] what land is he talking about the
[1:19:10] promised land now to us that's the Holy
[1:19:12] Ghost
[1:19:14] everything in this word belongs to you
[1:19:19] you have become part
[1:19:21] of the laws of God
[1:19:24] now there's a
[1:19:25] a little quote I read I think the last
[1:19:27] time I preached here I read it again in
[1:19:30] Mesa I'm going to read it again tonight
[1:19:33] because it's
[1:19:35] it's
[1:19:37] too good not to believe
[1:19:40] it's too powerful not to believe it's
[1:19:43] too true not to believe
[1:19:46] he said in a restoration of the Bright
[1:19:48] Tree he said then we have the privilege
[1:19:51] to enforce upon Satan the claims that
[1:19:55] God gave us
[1:19:57] for God has a law and his word is a law
[1:20:01] and God is in this word made certain
[1:20:05] claims to the church
[1:20:07] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:20:10] claims upon Satan and say give it back
[1:20:15] and he has to do it because we can take
[1:20:18] God's agent the Holy Spirit and go right
[1:20:21] down on our knees and say it's thus
[1:20:24] saith the Lord and he's got to give it
[1:20:27] up that's all because the holy spirit is
[1:20:30] there to make him do it
[1:20:34] skip down just a little bit 89 he said
[1:20:36] but the law of the spirit of God is to
[1:20:39] force Satan to give up that which he has
[1:20:42] unrightfully deceitfully taken from God
[1:20:46] Souls of men he took from God Souls of
[1:20:50] women children sickness of the body he
[1:20:53] placed upon people where God made him in
[1:20:55] his image to be like him and the church
[1:20:58] is given the rightful legal rights by
[1:21:01] the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and
[1:21:03] enforce this upon him
[1:21:06] so you have a right as a Believer
[1:21:09] tonight you have rights as a Believer
[1:21:12] tonight he said and he swore by himself
[1:21:14] I don't think I gave y'all this quote he
[1:21:16] said and he swore by himself paragraph
[1:21:18] 286 he said now by faith my brethren and
[1:21:22] my mother moved right into this blood
[1:21:24] cell
[1:21:26] with the Lord Jesus
[1:21:28] where all those Redemptive blessings are
[1:21:32] yours
[1:21:34] your everyone Christians I presume
[1:21:39] then if you are Christians you have a
[1:21:42] right a legal right for everything that
[1:21:46] Christ died for
[1:21:48] it's your possession you own it it's
[1:21:51] yours
[1:21:52] now the only thing you can do is do like
[1:21:55] Abraham and after he had endured a fight
[1:21:58] he obtained the promise Satan just don't
[1:22:02] let you take it easy you got to have
[1:22:04] faith
[1:22:06] you gotta believe it you got to endure
[1:22:10] but everything Saints it's in this land
[1:22:13] belongs to you you have a right to the
[1:22:16] Redemptive blessings of God tonight do
[1:22:19] you believe that tonight do you believe
[1:22:21] you have a rights to the Redemptive
[1:22:23] blessings of almighty God
[1:22:26] but we gotta fight for every inch of
[1:22:29] ground that we're standing on
[1:22:32] amen
[1:22:33] we got to quit waiting for everything to
[1:22:35] fall in our lap we got to stop hoping
[1:22:38] the devil doesn't do anything else bad
[1:22:40] to us
[1:22:42] and start taking back what he's took
[1:22:45] from us
[1:22:47] now these things don't come easy they
[1:22:49] take time they take prayer they take
[1:22:51] fast and they take they take
[1:22:53] consecration they take separation from
[1:22:55] the things of the world but the
[1:22:57] Redemptive blessings of God are yours
[1:22:59] tonight
[1:23:01] eternal life is a Redemptive blessing of
[1:23:04] God forgiveness of sin is a Redemptive
[1:23:06] blessing of God freedom from the curse
[1:23:08] of the law is a Redemptive blessing

[1:23:53] belong to the believer tonight
[1:23:57] everything in that land
[1:24:01] belongs to you
[1:24:04] because he died for it
[1:24:07] he made a way for it
[1:24:09] and it belongs to you
[1:24:12] so we just believe God's word and we go
[1:24:15] forward we don't go backwards you say

[1:24:45] there's no going backwards in God
[1:24:49] everything in the land
[1:24:51] belongs to you
[1:24:53] and these four kings came and they took
[1:24:56] Sodom and it already whipped the five
[1:24:58] Kings in their armies but where they
[1:25:00] messed up is when they took a lot
[1:25:01] because Lots belonged to Abraham
[1:25:06] and Abraham
[1:25:08] didn't know he was a warrior but he knew
[1:25:11] everything in that land belonged to him
[1:25:13] and brother Brown said he divided
[1:25:15] himself and slaughtered the Kings and
[1:25:17] came back triumphant why he laid his
[1:25:19] faith upon God's promise that everything
[1:25:23] in that land was his and lot was a part
[1:25:26] of it that's right was a part of that
[1:25:29] land say Saints Abraham didn't know he
[1:25:32] was a warrior
[1:25:34] David didn't know he was a Warrior when
[1:25:37] he smote Goliath
[1:25:39] shamgar didn't know he was a Warrior
[1:25:42] when he picked up that Ox gold
[1:25:45] amen and Abraham didn't know he was a
[1:25:48] warrior but brother Brown said on his
[1:25:50] way back he knew
[1:25:55] and Saints I don't know what your
[1:25:57] testimony is I don't know what kind of
[1:25:59] background you got I know that I grew up
[1:26:01] fighting
[1:26:02] mom had to come get me from school all
[1:26:04] the time because I got into it with
[1:26:06] somebody
[1:26:08] they kicked me out of high school
[1:26:09] several times because I was always in a
[1:26:11] fight with somebody I grew up that way I
[1:26:14] grew up rough
[1:26:16] so I was always a fighter
[1:26:19] and it served me well in the message
[1:26:21] pastor
[1:26:25] and that may not be your background you
[1:26:27] might say well I didn't grow up like
[1:26:28] that I'm not a fighter you might say
[1:26:30] well I'll tell you brother George I just
[1:26:32] was born in the message and I've been
[1:26:34] raised in a message home and I got the
[1:26:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've lived
[1:26:38] for the Lord every day of my life Saints
[1:26:40] that's the best testimony that I know of
[1:26:42] there's no greater testimony than the
[1:26:44] testimony if I was born in a message I
[1:26:47] was raised in the message and I'll
[1:26:49] served the Lord every day of my life
[1:26:52] that's the testimony I want for my
[1:26:54] children that's what I want for my
[1:26:56] grandchildren you don't have to go out
[1:26:58] in the world so that you can say you got
[1:27:00] a testimony
[1:27:04] you can live with the Lord every single
[1:27:07] day of your life and that's the greatest
[1:27:09] testimony that there ever was
[1:27:12] what a testimony that is
[1:27:14] amen and you might say well I don't know
[1:27:16] if I'm a fighter or not I don't have one
[1:27:18] else or it's shattering testimonies I
[1:27:20] didn't get shot four times I I wasn't
[1:27:22] member of a gang I didn't run and I was
[1:27:25] I've been good all my life and I and the
[1:27:27] Lord saved me and he and he said he's
[1:27:28] helped me and he's taking care of me you
[1:27:30] might not have that kind of Earth
[1:27:32] shattering testimony but that don't mean
[1:27:34] you're not a fighter
[1:27:37] see Abraham didn't know it was a fighter
[1:27:39] Sam guard didn't know it was a fighter
[1:27:41] and you you might not know if you're a
[1:27:43] fighter or not but I'll tell you Saints
[1:27:45] the devil does not want to go to battle
[1:27:47] against a mama fighting for her children
[1:27:54] the devil does not want to go to battle
[1:27:56] against a housewife fighting for her
[1:27:58] marriage
[1:28:00] the devil does not want to go to battle
[1:28:02] against a child praying for a wayward
[1:28:05] parents
[1:28:06] the devil does not want to go to battle
[1:28:08] against a grandmother building a hedge
[1:28:11] of protection around her grandchildren
[1:28:14] the the devil does not want to go to
[1:28:16] battle against the daddy fighting for
[1:28:18] his little girls
[1:28:21] amen it ain't the size of the dog in the
[1:28:24] fight it's the size of the fight that's
[1:28:25] in a dog all right
[1:28:27] because everything that's in that land
[1:28:30] belongs to you
[1:28:33] see Abraham was forced into battle he
[1:28:35] didn't go looking for trouble but he
[1:28:37] wasn't going to run from it when it came
[1:28:39] he didn't go looking for it but he
[1:28:41] wasn't backing down when it got there I
[1:28:43] love the verse and if I must fight then
[1:28:46] I must Reign Saints if we gotta fight
[1:28:48] anyways we might as well win
[1:28:52] if we got a battle every day anyhow we
[1:28:55] might as well be victorious
[1:28:58] amen if you got a loose if you gotta tie
[1:29:01] your boots up something's got to go down
[1:29:09] if we're gonna fight anyways why don't
[1:29:11] we win Saints and we're going to fight
[1:29:13] every one of us is going to fight every
[1:29:15] one of us is going to battle why don't
[1:29:17] we win tonight
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:29:21] we're gonna have to do it anyway
[1:29:23] and I'll tell you if you got to take out
[1:29:25] the sword of the of the word if you got
[1:29:27] to take the sword of the truth about
[1:29:29] Saints then something's got to go down
[1:29:31] somewhere there's a devil's got to be
[1:29:33] taking a whooping when you get the word
[1:29:34] outs
[1:29:37] it's like Peter Cartwright
[1:29:40] when it went into that little town and
[1:29:42] he had the word of the Lord and the Lord
[1:29:44] told him to hold a Revival
[1:29:46] and when he went into that little town
[1:29:47] he was watching the windows getting
[1:29:49] ready for the Revival and a town bully
[1:29:51] told him
[1:29:53] we ain't having no revivals around here
[1:29:56] he said well the Lord told me to
[1:30:00] is that right is that the story of
[1:30:01] saints the Lord told me to hold a
[1:30:03] Revival here he said if you're going to
[1:30:04] have a Revival here you'll have to whip
[1:30:06] me first he said well I just do that
[1:30:08] next then
[1:30:11] yeah
[1:30:12] I just handled that next
[1:30:15] and he said he got on top of it he said
[1:30:17] if I must fight then I must Reign
[1:30:20] increase my courage Lord
[1:30:24] and he said that bully got saved at
[1:30:26] nights caused everything that was in
[1:30:29] that land belonged to him
[1:30:34] man
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:38] so if the Hellman's salvation goes on
[1:30:40] the gloves got to come off Saints
[1:30:43] if we gotta fight anyways we might as
[1:30:46] well win
[1:30:48] amen
[1:30:50] ever present water from the Rocks see
[1:30:52] Saints the brine
[1:30:55] has got to recognize who she is
[1:31:00] he said if there wasn't a law to that
[1:31:03] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:31:05] would create them a world out here
[1:31:08] and go live a private life on it
[1:31:18] he said you have
[1:31:20] the power in you to do it
[1:31:24] if you've got a shadow
[1:31:27] of the power of God in you you've got
[1:31:30] power to do it
[1:31:31] my my mind
[1:31:36] is that what it says Saints
[1:31:40] he said God is omnipotent see what I
[1:31:44] mean the power that's in you will make
[1:31:47] you could speak a world into existence
[1:31:50] and go live on it
[1:31:53] now keep in mind brother Israel read
[1:31:55] this morning those things are
[1:31:57] sovereignly given
[1:32:03] see because the way we are now if I
[1:32:05] spoke something into existence you'd go
[1:32:07] speak it out of existence
[1:32:14] he said the power that's in you will
[1:32:16] make you could speak a world into
[1:32:17] existence and go live on it Hallelujah
[1:32:20] there you are that's the power is in the
[1:32:23] church now
[1:32:25] but it is controlled by a law
[1:32:29] and that law is not to just keep a bunch
[1:32:31] of Commandments it's a law of faith
[1:32:36] and Jesus said all things are possible
[1:32:39] to them that believe
[1:32:42] that is yours every place the soul of
[1:32:45] your foot can set upon by faith God
[1:32:47] gives it to you amen it's yours you
[1:32:50] possess it
[1:32:52] and if you find the key to this law of
[1:32:54] faith that opens it to you you see what
[1:32:56] I mean that power controlled by if you
[1:32:59] are a son of God you are a daughter of
[1:33:01] God that never leaves you
[1:33:05] it's with you all the time by your faith
[1:33:09] gets away from it but it's still there
[1:33:12] Hallelujah
[1:33:16] now recognizing your day in his message
[1:33:18] he said the spirit of God which is the
[1:33:20] word of God and I'm closing now matter
[1:33:22] of fact the musicians can go ahead and
[1:33:24] come he said the spirit of God which is
[1:33:27] the word of God my word is spirit and
[1:33:32] life we'll put the bride in her place
[1:33:37] want to put the bride in her place
[1:33:39] Saints the word will put the bride in
[1:33:42] her place
[1:33:44] he said well put the bride in her place
[1:33:46] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:33:50] the word
[1:33:52] then she's in Christ we'll put her in
[1:33:55] her place no National Force will do it
[1:33:57] but the National Force did Drive Israel
[1:34:00] into the Homeland the national forces of
[1:34:03] the Council of churches will drive every
[1:34:04] organization into it but the power of
[1:34:07] God will raise the bride into Glory
[1:34:13] out of it
[1:34:14] amen so Abraham took God at his word and
[1:34:19] he went and took back Lots because
[1:34:20] everything that was in that land
[1:34:22] belonged to him
[1:34:24] Abraham wasn't sure he was a fighter but
[1:34:27] he knew on his way back that he was a
