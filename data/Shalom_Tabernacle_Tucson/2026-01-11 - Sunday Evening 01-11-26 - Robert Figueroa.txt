There's a song that he said that he wouldn't need the words for, but we all know it. It's my hope is in the Lord. We'll try it maybe in the key of F with him. Brother Kim, you're going to need to come up here to sing from up here, though. So, we can bring you the mic there. Sure. They're going to miss the dingles when they head back north again, but sure want to take advantage of them as all we can while they're here. So, amen.

Hallelujah. Amen. They can sing a song as well. Enjoy it. You come Well, when I think of how he came so far from glory, came to dwell among the lowly such as to suffer shame and such disgrace. And on Mount Calary, take my place. That's when I ask myself this question. Who am I? Oh, who am I that a king would bleed and die for? Who am I that he would pray? Not my will thine fall. The answer I may never know why he ever loved me so and to an old rugged cross he would go for who am I then I'm reminded of his words. I'll leave you never. If you'll be true, I'll give to you life forever and forever. I wonder what I could have done to deserve God's only son. He'll fight my battles until they're won. For who am I? Oh, who am I? that a king would bleed and die more. And who am I that he would pray not my will thine? The answer I may never know just why he ever loved me so that to an old rugged cross he would go. Oh, to an old rugged cross he would go. Yes. to an old rugged cross he would go. For who am I? Stand and let's all sing it together. Oh am I that a king would bleed and die for? And whoever that he would bring, not my will, my Lord. know the answer. I may never know just why he never loved me so rugged cross. He was gone for Hallelujah. Amen. God bless everyone. We have a few prayer requests this evening. Brother Andy's mother and father-in-law will be moving back to Haiti on Friday. So, we've really enjoyed seeing them worship with us. So, we want to pray for God's hand upon them there. Jackie Lloyd sick in the hospital in New Mexico and Bethany McFaten is sick and needs a touch from the master. Let's bow our heads and go to him in prayer. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're grateful that we can stand before you. Joining our hearts, Lord, and spirits being in one mind and one accord, Lord, to bring these requests before you, Father. Lord, we pray that the Holy Spirit by their angels, Lord, would just keep them safe. Raise them up, Lord, Lord, and just, Father, let them know that the hand of God has touched their lives, Lord Jesus. We're thankful for the things that we've heard this day, Lord. Help us, Father, to get out of the way, Lord. That realize and recognize every gift among us, Lord, that has been edifying would continue that way, Lord. Never let it be about ourselves, but just you, Father, and your word. Lord, lead us and we'll follow. God, we need you tonight. Lord, we pray the gift of preaching that's going to come before us now. just be blessed mightily. Lord, let it fill our souls, Father. Let us leave better people for it.

Amen. I love that. My hope is in the Lord. Amen. I'm trusting in him. So, we welcome each of you to the house of the Lord. So glad to be in his presence once again. I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord. It was two years I was running from the Lord. And when he finally got a hold of me, I was a pl in a place that I shouldn't be. And I got down on my knees and I prayed a simple prayer and I said, 'Lord, if you would change my desires and but put in my heart to be in church, I will serve you. And there was no shining miracle. I didn't speak in I didn't shout or anything. But when I got up off my knees, it was just like that. &gt;&gt; All those desires had left me. Things I struggled with have was just gone. And I know it doesn't happen like that for everybody, but that's what happened for me. &gt;&gt; And I love being in church. Even if you cancel church, I'mma find somewhere to go praise the Lord on Sunday night or whenever. And so we count it a privilege to be here with you all tonight. Amen. So good to have you. And I appreciate brother Mow there and we try to squeeze on him a little bit more. Amen. Um, but uh, we found somebody else to squeeze on tonight. That's our good friend, brother Robert Figureroa from the lighthouse in the desert there in Fort Wuka. He's a pastor there. He's been a friend to our ministry for many years. I've preached for him and he's come to speak for us and we just have a love and respect for brother Figureroa. How many can say amen to that? And that's his dear wife there in the back there. God bless them. And so let's uh let's just give them a hand for just being who they are. Amen. We'll do it at his funeral, too, but it's better to do it when they're alive. And so as he comes, let's all stand to our feet and sing that old hymn of the church, Amazing Grace. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound and sing a rich like me. Like me, like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. Was blind but now I see. God bless you. It was grace that on my heart to raise my fears. Hallelujah. Oh, how precious that praise appear they are. I first you praise God for that this evening. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise. Praise the Lord. Amen. Are you happy this evening? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be in the house of the Lord? &gt;&gt; As our brother said, he loves to be in the house of God. Amen. I think it was David who said, I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. Amen. And so here we are this evening and I brother Beno a man of such caliber and here I am. I'm a nobody preaching. But you know I believe in God's in God's economy we're all somebody. Amen. But I appreciate our brother his ministry and I both your ministry because when he calls a man he calls a wife as well. We're thankful for that. My wife is here with me as well tonight and but you know I'm Bobby's father. That's how I'm known around here. Amen. So God bless you all. If you have your Bibles tonight, uh, with this, turn to Psalms 37, verse 23 and 24. And as we're talking back there in the office, you're turning there, uh, Brother John Yarro walked in, he said, "Bro, he's a brother uh, Israel says something." And he said, "Well, he's a good man talking about me." And I said, "Well, coming from a good man, I said that's I take that as a compliment." And I didn't realize that the first uh scripture here in Psalms 37:23, it reads, "The steps of a good man. &gt;&gt; The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord." Aren't you happy, Brother John? &gt;&gt; Amen. He gave you testimony that I'm a good man. I gave you testimony. He's a good man. Amen. So, here we are in the scriptures, brother John. The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delightth in his way. You know, God delights in our way. &gt;&gt; God actually likes us. &gt;&gt; He smiles when he looks at us. You think? &gt;&gt; You think he smiles when he when he looks at us? &gt;&gt; There goes my son. There goes my daughter. &gt;&gt; Come here, Gabriel. Look, I want you to see. Look what they're going through. Yet, look, they're in church tonight. Give me praise, honor, and glory. Amen. The Lord delightth in his way. Though he fall, see never said the earth is going to go just perfect all the time &gt;&gt; as we know the word perfect. &gt;&gt; Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down. For the Lord uphold of him. Amen. With his hand. &gt;&gt; Can you say praise the Lord tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, tonight as we gather around your word, Lord, Father, and your spirit is already here, Lord. We we've invited you, Lord. You're the guest of honor, Lord. You're the main one, Father. We want to put all our thoughts upon you tonight, Lord, and your eternal word, Father. Speak to us, Father, and help us, Lord, to to be able to say the right thing, Lord, and and anoint every heart to receive, Father, for we here, Lord God, for these few moments here tonight, Lord, to to just get closer to you, Father. We thank you, Father, for your mercy and your grace, for delighting in our way, Lord. Amen. How precious, Lord, is your word, Father. How we thank you tonight. We ask that you be with us, Father, in all that we do and say and you bless your people. We ask it in Jesus' name. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; God bless you. Be seated tonight. I was telling brother Israel, I spoke this morning on on the word of God, the actually the Bible. I brought my little Bible with me tonight. Uh but uh you know this this Bible we just don't seem to re uh value it as we should. &gt;&gt; Uh this this Bible is is dripping with blood. &gt;&gt; And I I told the church this morning I said you know I said William T William Tindale he he translated this Bible into English and he paid a price for that. &gt;&gt; They burned him alive. And I said, you know, this this little Bible, I said, is dripping with the blood of William Tinddale. &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; It's dripping with the blood of millions &gt;&gt; and millions who took it to their heart. &gt;&gt; And we don't value it as we should. Brother Brand said we should read it every day. &gt;&gt; If it's just one verse, read one verse. &gt;&gt; There's power &gt;&gt; in the word of all you need is one verse. &gt;&gt; I've heard of one verse as saved. souls of the past. &gt;&gt; They just heard one verse, &gt;&gt; one little pamphlet, one little brochure. That's all it took. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Lupe Lopez, you you remember brother Lupe from from uh Awapeta uh Mexico and uh he said that he found he was in the in the gu in the in the in the at the dump and he found a track and it was it was about brother Brandham and that's all it took out of the dump. Amen. God God works in wondrous ways, does he not? &gt;&gt; So, who we here we find my my message tonight is the steps of the righteous. I believe that they're ordered by the Lord. Do you believe that tonight? &gt;&gt; Uh a lot of times we make plans and we think we're going to do this and we're going to do that and tomorrow we're going to run over here and this is going to be my land. And and God has other plans. I I think his plans supersede brother m our plans &gt;&gt; a lot of times &gt;&gt; you know there's a how many know Spanish here this this evening now any Spanish speaking well we we make a plan and God he's got other plans and he he because he's ordering our steps. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's watching over his flock. He's watching over you and I. In Psalms 37:31, the there David writes, "The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide." &gt;&gt; My my my I'll give you a few more witnesses of that. Psalms 119:13, "Order my steps in thy word, &gt;&gt; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me." And over here, Paul gave an answer in the New Testament. He says, "Sin shall not have dominion over you." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Sin shall not have dominion over me. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's given us the power. Amen. The authority over every every serpent, scorpion, and snake, and everything of the of Satan. He's given us authority over all that &gt;&gt; and over all the power of the enemy. He said, &gt;&gt; "My my my." &gt;&gt; Why? Because our steps are ordered. &gt;&gt; God's watching every little from the first step we took as a little baby. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When mama and papa would say, "Come on, come on." And we took our first, God ordered that step. &gt;&gt; And every step thereafter, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Until he calls us home, &gt;&gt; he's ordered my steps. Amen. I know in whom I had believed. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. My my brother Israel left this pulpit anointed here for me tonight. My my my Proverbs chapter 2:7 and 8. He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous. He is a buckler. Hallelujah. To them that walk uprightly. &gt;&gt; He keepeth a path of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints. You know, God's always gone before us. Amen. We're just following in his footsteps. Amen. He's watching all our days upon this earth. God is watching us every moment. Amen. He's watching. He's He's taking care of us. He said he would. He He's His hand is up is holding us up. &gt;&gt; Amen. I like that little song. I can't even walk without without him holding my hand. &gt;&gt; In Revelations chapter 2 verse 8 to10, sometimes the steps will take us into places where we don't want to go. Who wants a trial? &gt;&gt; Who wants who wants to go into the fiery furnace of trials? But yet he he he he takes our steps and he brings us right into that. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for that. &gt;&gt; God is not a God of chaos. He's not a God of of just He is a God of purpose. There's a reason for every I said this morning to the church, he every word he has spoken has a purpose behind it. &gt;&gt; He doesn't waste words. Well, we waste words. We waste time. We waste everything. But God does not waste his words. &gt;&gt; Every word has a purpose, amen, behind it. And there's power in every word of God. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. &gt;&gt; Revelations 2:8. And unto the angel of the church in Smeirna, write these things the first and the last, which was dead and is alive. I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, but thou art rich, and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, but they are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Fear not of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried, that ye shall have tribulation 10 days. You know that every day represented a hundred years or a thousand years in Smeirna. He be thou faithful. He says unto death and I will give thee a crown of life. &gt;&gt; My my my. &gt;&gt; But he doesn't hold back. He says you know some of you are going to really going to suffer. You're going to go you you you may even go to death, but you're going to receive a crown of life. &gt;&gt; In the smearing and church age in the church age book, paragraph 116-2, brother Brandham says this. Now the Lord God Almighty says, "I know there he is walking in the midst of his people. &gt;&gt; There he is, the chief shepherd of the flock. &gt;&gt; But does he hold back the persecution? Does he stem the tribulation? No, he does not. My my He simply says, "I know your tribulation. I am not at all unmindful of your suffering." What a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel. They wonder if God really loves them. How can God be just just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer? Surely God won't let me suffer. You know, we don't understand the love of God. He says what that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1-3. The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. I have loved you sayaeth the Lord. Yet we say, "Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? Sayaith the Lord. Yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness." You see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. Those of you that have a little baby, you only want to fly the land on his forehead. That that's parental care. That's not God. Our God is not like that. He has a purpose in what he allows in our life. &gt;&gt; He says, "But God said that his love was elective love." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The proof of his love is election. that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that he they were chosen unto salvation. And this night I can say, "Praise be to God. We've been chosen to salvation." God has chosen us. Jesus said, "Many are called." &gt;&gt; Many. The call goes out. Whosoever will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Israel. Whosoever will, let him come. Many are called but few are chosen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My my my think of that because God has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit, listen to this now, he may commit you to death as he did Paul. Wow, those are strong words. uh he says he may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign &gt;&gt; but it is all with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect. be established, strengthened, and settled. &gt;&gt; As Job said, he put strength in us. &gt;&gt; And he says, you see, he himself suffered. He learned, Christ learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul in he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. I was telling brother Israel the word perfection. Many times we think of something that no no mistakes or you know something is just uh we use perfect but perfection many times it means to come of age to to come to maturity to become a man as Paul said when when I was a child I speak as a child I I I I as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things there's got to be maturity that come that comes into our life &gt;&gt; and and what brings that is this the things that God allows in our life, the things that go wrong, the things that go the way they shouldn't go sometimes and the pain and the heartache and all that we go through in life. And those of us that are 16, 15, 16 and above, you know what I'm talking about. Maybe some of younger ones have not suffered yet, the death of a loved one, but we have. And we know what it is. We know what the pain is to lose someone like that. And it's such a it's it's a it's a horrible thing, but but God knows how to use that to our good &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in Romans 8:28 that that all things work together for good. &gt;&gt; All things work together for good to them that love God &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; There's this purpose always. He has a purpose. James 1 chapter verses 2 and 4. 2 to 4. My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. There's that word perfect again. The the the that we're not how are we going to be perfected unless the trials come? &gt;&gt; How how are we going to be honed unless these things come against us? to to home that to bring that character because God's not working on this. He's working on our character. &gt;&gt; We understand that's the only thing we're taking home with us &gt;&gt; is our character. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not taking our homes or our cars or our bank accounts. They're going to stay behind. &gt;&gt; But he's t we're taking our character &gt;&gt; and and and God is working on that because that's the only thing we're going to have up there. That's what's going to allow us to stand there with Christ as as kings and priests with character &gt;&gt; because we've gone through we've gone through the that that fiery furnace of temptations and of trials and heartaches. Romans 8:17 says, "And if children," he says, "then hes of God." Oh, we like that. Joiners with Christ. Yes. Amen. Yes. I love that. &gt;&gt; If so be. If so be &gt;&gt; that we suffer with him &gt;&gt; that we may be also glorified together. See, it's all through the Bible. &gt;&gt; For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. My my my &gt;&gt; everything we go through, God is he's perfecting us. He's bringing us to that maturity that we become real men and women of God with backbone. &gt;&gt; Amen. With character that we know how to take our stand. Amen. We know when to when to speak and when not to speak. &gt;&gt; When is better to remain silent? We we we we're we're we're supposed to be uh uh led by the spirit of God every moment of our life, allowing the spirit of God to have control of our of our thoughts, having control of our of our words that we speak. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the spirit church 117-1, brother says, "Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him." &gt;&gt; My my you have to suffer to reign. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the reason for this is that character, and we've heard this many times, character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a victory, not a gift. &gt;&gt; A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is what? &gt;&gt; Satanic. But power with character is fit to rule. When we see men that are reigning here on earth now and have reigned in the past like Saddam Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler and Stalin and and all these men and even even Castro in Cuba and and these this man uh Kmeni Ayatollah over in in Iran how they've killed and murdered h some hundreds some thousands some millions. See that's that's reigning without character. There's no character in these men. But God won't bring us to that place. He'll not put that power in our in our hands unless we have the character to handle the power. He had Jesus had the character to handle the power. &gt;&gt; When he he when he lay on that cross &gt;&gt; and he had the the power he said I can I can call my my father will send 12 legions of angels. &gt;&gt; He had the power. It laid the tip of his tongue. Think of it in my mind's eye. back and see the archangel uh Gabriel standing there maybe not understanding the whole plan of God. You we we hear the song a song that brother John used to sing for us many a time where they're standing on there on the hill of Goltha and all the powers of Satan over here and all the powers of God. Maybe Gabriel and I see my mind's eye Gabriel standing there with his sword in his hand and saying Lord just speak the word Lord and I'll change the scene. Think of it. He had the power to change it, but he had character. He knew what he was doing. And there was a last night as I was praying, I was reading there where where Christ was at Gethsemane and and he was going through that great battle. And I thought, oh my, what a battle he had to fight, folks. You know, brother Brandon says he he went to he went to Calvary as a man like you and I. He couldn't die as God. He had to die as a man. He felt he he he he said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." You think he was just making words up? It was it was from the depth of his soul, his heart. That that part of him didn't want to do that because he knew how painful, how horrendous it would be. But he but he knew that if he didn't do it, we'd all be lost. And he did it for us. Next time you read the story of Gethsemane, I hope it touches you like that. You realize the price that he paid. He went to Calvary as a man. He suffered as a man. He died as a man. My my. So a man without character can't reign. Power without character is sitanic. And since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is sat down in his father's throne, then we have to overcome to sit with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be sitting at the overcomers table. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're not an overcomer, you can't sit there. I'm sorry. But I pray every one of you this this evening are overcomers. Amen. And we're all going to sit at that table, the overcomers table. Amen. And the little temporary suffering he says we we go through now. Temporary. Come on. Temporary &gt;&gt; suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes. Oh, what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation. I like the song that says, "Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas. Sure, I must fight if I would reign. Increase my courage, Lord." Would that be our prayer tonight? increase my c my courage, Lord. I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, supported by thy word. I'm so glad that the, you know, the word of God, as I was talking on the Bible, 8,800 promises in the word of God. Here's one. Psalms 34:17-19. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and deliverth them out of all their troubles. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, &gt;&gt; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the righteous. &gt;&gt; I said many are the afflictions. Are you hearing me this evening? &gt;&gt; Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver them out of them all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's my deliverer tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Man, I might be afflicted, but I've got a deliverer. Hallelujah. I've got one that knows. He He's ordered these steps for me. He's watching my steps for me. He knows what's coming. He knows that I can endure. &gt;&gt; He He knows. He's placed it in me. &gt;&gt; There has no temptation taken you, but such as is coming to man. But God is faithful. who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able &gt;&gt; but will with the temptation also provide a way to escape &gt;&gt; that you might be able to bear it and that's it brothers just bear it temporary. It's only for a short while. &gt;&gt; One day we'll break through all this and we'll step into eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. 1 Peter 4:12-16 says, "Beloved, I think think not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you." It's talking. It's a sure thing like I guess death in taxes. You're going to get tried. If you're a Christian, you're going to get tried. You're going to suffer for that. You know, before when Satan had you as a trophy in his in his little cabinet cabinet up there, he worried about you. As soon as you start serving God, he's like, "Who's this?" And they all start turning their eyes toward you. And then now you're under the guns. There was no battle back then, but you were losing. You're you're going to hell, but now you're going to heaven. Now you've got a battle in your hands. You've got you've got you've got every trained gun trained upon you &gt;&gt; to destroy you. Amen. As it says, many of the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord deliver them out of them all. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't think it's strange. Why am I going through this? You ever had pastors, pastors, someone come why am I why am I suffering this? Why is this happening to me? People ask that question. It's a It's a good question to ask if they don't know the answer. But if we're serving God, there's your answer right there. &gt;&gt; Don't think it's strange. Don't Don't think it's something that shouldn't be happening. It should be happening. &gt;&gt; It's going to happen. It's it's a sure thing. As though some strange thing happened unto you. He said, "But rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ, of Christ's sufferings. But when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding oh my I think just one minute in that presence. We're gonna forget all of that. &gt;&gt; We It won't even come through our mind, brother Israel, no more. We won't even think about it anymore. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It could have been the worst. You might have been gone through the worst trials of your life of anybody here. But it doesn't matter. One minute, one second in the presence of God will change all of that. What glory &gt;&gt; God has prepared for us. &gt;&gt; Oh exceeding glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my my. &gt;&gt; He says here, he said, "You may be glad with all exceeding joy if you be repro reproached for the name of Christ. Happy are ye." &gt;&gt; They can call us a cult all they want. To them, anybody that doesn't believe the Trinity is a cult. &gt;&gt; You can call me a cult all you want. I'm I don't believe in no three gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe in one God. &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So here here we we're going to get reproached. Don't be ashamed. Don't be ashamed of that. Let him call you a brandomite. I take that badge with honor. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, that you find me worthy enough to to even carry the name of of of a great man named Brandom. a great man of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of glory of God restth upon you. On their part, he is evil spoken of, but on your part, he's glorified. My my my. Can you imagine that? Our life is glorifying him. That's why we're here on earth. &gt;&gt; We're here to glorify him. &gt;&gt; Our life should be a a glory to our Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer. I know some brothers that that are in prison today. And they were brothers, but they did wrong things. They're suffering. They're not suffering for as Christians. They're suffering for e for evil they did. And maybe they deserve what they're getting. And God will forgive them. They're in prison. And I believe God can forgive a man in prison. You believe that, brother Israel? &gt;&gt; But you know something? I've always said this. I might have said it here before that we're all farmers. Did you know you as a farmer, we're planting seeds every day? &gt;&gt; Come on. Every choice we make is a is a seed &gt;&gt; we plant. &gt;&gt; If you make the wrong choice, you planted the wrong seed and you keep planting those seeds. Just wait a little while. You're going to have a harvest. &gt;&gt; The wrong kind of a harvest. &gt;&gt; You see, God will forgive you. But then you got to deal with that harvest. &gt;&gt; You got to deal Amen. What you reap, you reap. What you sow is the law of God. &gt;&gt; It is a law of God. It's unbendable. It's unbreakable. What you sow, you will reap. &gt;&gt; God will forgive you. &gt;&gt; But you got to deal with those things. &gt;&gt; It's going to be that much harder. &gt;&gt; It's going to be that much more difficult. &gt;&gt; It's going to take that much more surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let none of us suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busy body in other men's matters. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, hallelujah, let him not be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Don't don't be ashamed. If if they they if they call you sister because you you you're you're dressed decently in this world that we're living in right now. You stand out like you know you you know you do you stand out like a circle. I can I can look across a Walmart or whatever and see some see some ladies and oh their message &gt;&gt; right away. I I can pick you up because you're you you're you're you're an you're you're you're like an emblem like a like something that's just you you you what's the word I want to say? You're a representation &gt;&gt; of the church of the living God. Because the church is is a is is typed as a woman and you as women, God God has given you that. Amen. Brother B said your body is a sacred thing. You want to cover it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the world is is a different way. But you you God God will bless you for that. Don't be ashamed of that. &gt;&gt; Wear it as as a badge of honor. Amen. that you are a child, a daughter of God, and you conduct yourself as one. Like that slave that would walk around and with his chest out and and they, oh, we want to buy him. Oh, he's not for sale. Well, why is he different? Well, we found out that back home, he's a son of a king. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Back home, you're a daughter of the king this evening. &gt;&gt; Back home, we're the sons of the king. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Spirit and church age 117-2. Think it not strange. Well, I think I read this already. I think I must have gone up. You know, every child, Brother Brand says, must be tested and tried. And we're going to be tried. God's going to try us. He's going to see if we're made up of the the stuff we should be made up of. If we're the real thing. Hebrews 12:6 it says, "For whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth and scourgeth." You know, a son of God, brother Israel, he don't get away with anything. &gt;&gt; If you're a if you're a child of God, daughter, daughter of God, you don't get away with anything. You ever notice that? &gt;&gt; Every time it never fails. &gt;&gt; We find out all we find ourselves on our knees saying, "Oh, God, I sure messed up. Please forgive me. &gt;&gt; I sure messed. father just have have have mercy upon me. &gt;&gt; Because we don't get away with anything. And the Bible says here, "Whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth &gt;&gt; and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth." &gt;&gt; If you endure chastening, God dealeth with you as a as with sons. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For what son is he whom the father chastineth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons. Well, I'm so glad that I don't get away with anything. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. You know, I cannot chasen somebody else's child. Sometimes I wish I could. Especially when you're standing behind the pull brother Israel and little kids, they're they're laying them people haven't been taught right. They just they're running up and down the the aisle or whatever, you know, and they just they're just riing. They just don't they don't sit down for a moment and and all they need is just a little bit of chastening. You don't have to hurt the child, but let them know this this is not done in church. This is church. My kids when they were two years old, they knew how to sit in church. They we used to go to a church where our services were six hours long &gt;&gt; and they learned they learned real quick as soon as they start getting I would take them and I take them outside &gt;&gt; and I and I give them a little bit of a on the backside and then I wait till they stop crying and I bring them back inside and sit down and then they did it again. I sometimes in service I got up three times. But let me tell you something. It only took about two weeks. &gt;&gt; Two weeks of that and they're done. They know what's going to happen. Kids are smarter than we are. Believe me, the little guys, they're smarter than we are. They understand. And so, you teach a child how to behave. Amen. And like I some I can't I cannot chastise somebody else's child, but I could chastise mine. &gt;&gt; And God don't just chastise other other children that are not his. He'll chastise his kids. &gt;&gt; If we're his kids this evening, he's gonna he's going to chastise us. He's not going to let us get away with anything. And I praise God for that. I'm glad that God is he does that with us. Amen. In Proverbs 3 11 and 12, my son despise not the chastening of the Lord. Neither be weary of his correction. For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth even as the father the son in whom he delightth. &gt;&gt; My my my. In spirit churches 117-3. Now this special condition of smeirnina must be applied to every age. But we spoke about smeirnina. There is no age free from it. See there is no true believer free from it. This is of God. Listen. He says he'll put you on a on a he'll put you to he he'll take you to death. He'll he'll he'll allow all the one place he says he'll bring tensions in the church in your church to test you. Come on. In the church, &gt;&gt; he he'll he'll he'll put you in a hospital. Whatever it takes, &gt;&gt; God will do. And here, brother says, "This is of God. This is the will of God. It is needful." My my my. We need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be Christlike in doing it. love sufferth long and is kind. See, character comes at a cost. It comes as as as with sacrifice. We we here in this lady seeing lazy church age sometimes that spirit gets around us. We become lazy. We don't want to pay a price. We don't know what it is to sacrifice anymore. you know you this this evening coming to church that you came to church tonight it was a sacrifice and it's also it's an investment that you given to the kingdom of god but you know we we need to realize that that it takes sacrifice you think William Tinddale wasn't didn't know the the price that he would pay for what he did but yet he did it he paid a price it was a great sacrifice for him and all those that that have suffered in the past because of sacrifice. People today in this day and age, they don't want to sacrifice. It's too hard to to to spend an hour or two reading their Bible. But we we can sure get on with Facebook or Tik Tok or I don't know what they call these things. And we can spend hours. Come on. &gt;&gt; We can do that. Stand in front of a television or play video games or whatever it might be. &gt;&gt; Uh you know, but to to to to take a sacrifice to go and sit down somewhere and get your Bible and start reading and praying and meditating upon God and spending two or three hours a day doing that. Can we do that? Can we sacrifice that much? I know we're busy. I know there's some of you are really busy. You got a lot you got a lot on your plate, but you've got to take the time. It's for it's for your own good. That's what strengthens you. I I preached a message some time ago. I think it was with a with a men and I talked about prayer and you know prayer is is the victory is won on our knees. It's not won when we're out there and the temptation comes and we're and we and we went over it. No, it was won won back there on our knees. I saw a picture some years ago. She must have been a Pentecostal lady, a black a black lady, long hair, decently dressed. She's on her knees and she knows she's touching God. Her hands are up in the air like this and she's just praising the Lord and and that really caught me because I said, "Wow, that's that's a beautiful picture of a of a young lady, her dress, ride and hairs and and just worshiping God and on her knees." But what it said underneath really caught my attention. It said, "This is how I fight my battles. &gt;&gt; This is how I fight my battles." How do I fight my battles? I you sit somewhere you read the you read the word of God. You listen to a tape. You spend that free what free time you have. You give it to the Lord. That sacrifice, you know, the flesh would rather probably watch Facebook or Tik Tok or or whatever they have out there. I'm not real coined with all that stuff, but you know, if we spend that time with God, Amen. And that strengthens the inner man. It gives us strength that when we're we're in the temptation, &gt;&gt; Amen. we have the power, Amen. to to be victorious over it &gt;&gt; and to win in every battle that we come. We're we're we should be a church of gate takers tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. every gate that's before us that we are ready to to take it immediately because we're walking in the light of the word of this day that strengthens us every hour. Amen. To that every victory for that God has given us. Amen. Others have fought those those those fights and those battles before us and now it's fallen in our hands. Amen. We have we have to continue on with his torch and take this battle to the devil and destroy him on every hand. &gt;&gt; God has given us that. &gt;&gt; We are more than victors. We are more than conquerors. The Bible said through him that loved us. &gt;&gt; Amen. What shall separate us from the love of Christ till tribulation distress or nakedness or peril or sword? Amen. As it is written, we are killed all the day long. We are as accounted as sheep for the slaughter. My He's on us every day. 24 hours a day, seven, seven days a week, all year long. He don't let up. But man, we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; That power that lays within us. Amen. Just let it be unleashed. Amen. But you got to be the right kind of vessel. &gt;&gt; You've got to be a vessel that's paying that that sacrifice and and sacrificing yourself to the Lord and giving him. The Bible says that we should be a living sacrifice. That's that's scriptural. Friends, &gt;&gt; I beseech you, brethren, by the mercy of God that you present your body as a living sacrifice, &gt;&gt; holy, acceptable, not unto yourself or unto the pastor or somebody unto God, &gt;&gt; holy, acceptable unto the Lord, which is your reasonable service. It's a given. &gt;&gt; God expects that from us. &gt;&gt; Amen. That our lives should be holy before him. &gt;&gt; My my my. And if they're not, because we're not spending enough time fighting our battles. How do we fight our battles? On our knees. How do we win them? On our knees. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Pray that you enter not into temptation." It's one thing to be tempted. It's another thing to enter into the temptation. We're all tempted. To be tempted is not sin. It's when you allow that sin to to come on your life, you enter into it. Jesus said, "Pray that you enter not." Amen. Character comes as a as a cost. Matthew 5:11-12, Jesus said, "Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake." He says, "Rejoice again." Every time we should we be rejoicing and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. &gt;&gt; Again the spirit and church age 118-11. The cloudy skies and the storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. If you're going through a hard time right now that doesn't mean God's against you. God's ordering your steps, friend. He's watching over you. &gt;&gt; You're the apple of his eye. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you ever see yourself that way? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The apple I'm the apple of God's eye. &gt;&gt; God really cares for me. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Cast your cares upon him." &gt;&gt; For he cares. &gt;&gt; He cares for you. The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. Neither neither or. His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. His love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us? Ah yes. But how shall we know? We shall know. Brother is because he said so. &gt;&gt; He said he don't lie. &gt;&gt; My God don't lie. &gt;&gt; He's truth. He is He is the very the very foundation of all truth. He's a fountain of all truth. &gt;&gt; Why? How am I going to know Lord that you love me? Son, I I I said so. I told you that I love you. &gt;&gt; That should be enough. &gt;&gt; His word is enough. Amen. I said his word is enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says here and it says we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons. How shall I prove my love to him? By believing what he said &gt;&gt; and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials. &gt;&gt; Anybody got any trials tonight? Come on, don't be afraid to raise up your hand. &gt;&gt; We all got trials. &gt;&gt; We all got temptations. &gt;&gt; If you if you don't, you're dead. Better check your pulse. If you don't have any trials or temptations, he says here, "Conducting thyself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass." My my my. So because everything is going good and oh I got money in the bank, my tank is full of gas and I feel good and my children are okay. That doesn't mean that God is is is could be happy with you. You understand what I'm saying? Doesn't mean that that everything is good with God. Just like if everything is going wrong and everybody's sick and you and you're broke and you can't make your you can't even make a payment on the mortgage or whatever, it doesn't mean that God's against you. &gt;&gt; Amen. measure your life. You know, Paul said, "Examine yourself &gt;&gt; to see if you're in the faith or not." &gt;&gt; He said, "What?" He says, "Don't you know yourself. &gt;&gt; Don't you know?" He said, "I I don't know. You don't know me, but you know yourself. I know myself. I know this guy. &gt;&gt; I know the problems he gives me." &gt;&gt; I said, "The worst the worst enemy we got is the one that looks at us in the mirror when we're brushing our teeth. That's the guy we got to watch out for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He says now he said how by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst a trial. That's that's the key to find the joy in the trial. To find how can it be you say you you'd have to be mad or crazy but no but there's something it's on the inside. He can't get on the inside. He can attack this outside all he wants. He can attack my mind and depress me. I was reading some of David's writings and he says why? He's talking about his depression. He's so depressed and he doesn't know what to do and he's asking God why am I like this? I'm just par paraphrasing that. But you know he went through depressions. David did. Who who who doesn't from time to time. &gt;&gt; We all go through depressions. Sometimes you can wake up after a good Sunday night, wake up on Monday morning and you're depressed and don't even know why because he's got access to this. But there's something on the inside of the inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God put a no fishing sign there. He says, "Satan, you stay away. That belongs to me." &gt;&gt; That's a soul. Amen. That's the eternal part. That's a part he predestinated. That's a part that we're that's going to see God again. Hallelujah. This flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; But that soul, hallelujah, will stand in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. In first John 3:1, behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. That's God's love. Amen. He chose us. He He bestowed that upon us. Therefore, the world knoweth us not. Amen. In the world, we're just a sore thumb sticking out. We don't listen to their dirty jokes and their and all their cor all their talking about sports and I don't even know who got a touchdown or who I don't know when the Super Bowl has already passed or still I don't know. I have no idea. I don't care. &gt;&gt; Has nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; And and 10 years now, who cares who won the touchdown? Who had the winning touchdown for the for the game? Nobody cares anymore. It's all temporal. &gt;&gt; And those men that were playing on the field, a lot of them afterwards are fighting dementia from all the hits they took on their head. &gt;&gt; And a lot of them, they've lost all the money they had because they didn't know how to handle it. They're they're poor and their bums and and they're living on the streets &gt;&gt; when one time they were in a Super Bowl. &gt;&gt; That's the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the pay that they get. &gt;&gt; But there's a glory that's awaiting us. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's Amen. The bi Bible says that our mind our we can't even imagine how wonderful it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. What manner of love has the father bestowed upon us that we should be called that what a what an honor brother Israel this brother min to be called a son of god. &gt;&gt; No greater honor amen that god should bestow upon me to be a son of god. No, even the president, the kings, they never attained that honor. We will, we have attained an honor way above anything in this world with his temporaless. 1 John 3:1 says, "Behold, what manner of love has he says, therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not." 1 John 4:10, here it is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins. First John 4:19, we love him because he first loved us. Do you realize how how John would write about love? Little children, love one another &gt;&gt; because love, God is love, he would say. And you would think, surely, John, you got greater revelations of that. Uh you you know, John, you you were on the aisle of Pat. Listen, man. You you you saw the church ages as they unfolded before you. You you saw the the messengers. You saw you saw the messenger came in this last church. You looked into the eternal day. You look you saw the judgment, the white throne, judgment, and the eternal day. be all that. Surely you've got you you you you were there when when the seven thunders sounded out and you you were you were John, you were about to write them down. &gt;&gt; Think of it. What revelations, John, you have &gt;&gt; and he comes back with the middle. Little children love one another. Amen. For love is that's that's of God. You say you love your God and and you hate your brother. He says the love of God is not in you. You're a liar. He he he put such an emphasis for us to love one. There was that to me there. If there's a revelation you could receive that's above every revelation is to have love one for the other because Satan he knows how to come in and cause differences among a group. He's an expert. He's been doing it for a long time. We're no match for him. We need to come back to the word and regardless of what I think my sister my brother said still say Lord I want to love that person. You know, if if you if you have somebody in your I'm going to I'm going to quit now, but I don't want to hold you too long as I think I already have. But you know, if you think that I lost my train of thought happened to you, brother Minnow, I'm 72, so I guess I got a good excuse. Brother Israel don't have an excuse yet. He's too young. Amen. 1 Peter 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to the abundance mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and death fadeth not away." It's not temporal, friends. Everything here is temporal. You buy a new car, oh, it's got that smell good. That new car smell good. Just give it a couple of years. After you paying the paying the uh the monthly payment, it gets old real quick. You got a new house that goes, it gets old real quick. Everything here is temporal. Every joy this world could produce, every euphoria, everything, every high is temporal. &gt;&gt; But God's highs are eternal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I said God's highs are eternal. &gt;&gt; Oh my. His blessings are eternal. There's no time limit to it. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Verse six. Wherein we greatly rejoice. For now, for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. It's worth more than gold, friends. that character that comes out. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Bram talked about himself where God took him like a rose and crushed him to get the fragrance out. You know, sometimes God has to take us like that and crush us a little bit to cause a fragrance to come out. The right hopefully the right kind kind of fragrance does come out. So, I ask you as I close tonight, what is the difference between a believer and an unbeliever? What is the difference? You know the believer his house burns down. The unbeliever his house burns down. The unbeliever he loses the child. The believer he loses a child. So what's the difference? What's the difference? The pain is the same for both I would think. But there is a difference. See, God is doing something in our lives. &gt;&gt; We're in his hands. He has ordered our steps before us. &gt;&gt; Every step that I take, I like that song. Every move that I make, every tear that I cry, he knows my name. &gt;&gt; There's there's there's something about that. There's a there's a a a intimacy between me and my God, between you and the Lord Jesus as he orders your steps and he brings you through these hard times. As we know, he he carried us through those hard times. He never left. I'll never leave you nor forsake you, &gt;&gt; but I'll be with you until the end of the age. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if the musicians would come tonight, I just feel to sing one song and then I'll be giving it back to brother Israel or or the song leader, whoever comes here. But I want to live the way he wants me to live. I want to walk the steps he has ordained for me to walk. I want to be I want I want my heart to be encouraged every day. Not not a coward. God doesn't respect cowards. That armor that we're given in Ephesians, it's only for the front. There's no armor for the back. I don't want to be like Ephraim that turned his back on the day of battle and ran. but to stand. That's where the Bible says, "Stand, therefore, stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world." Amen. We are to take a stand. Stand therefore stand having your loins uh girdled about and your and having a breastplate of righteousness, your feet shaw with a preparation. All this is for the front to face the enemy. Amen. To be able to live that life. Say, Lord, I want to live that life. How many want to live that life? Sacrifice. It's going to take sacrifice. It's going to take pain. Are you willing? Are you willing? There's a price to pay. Amen. That that that man that found that pearl a great price. Jesus said in the parable, he sold everything he had to go purchase that because that was more important than everything he had. He said, "He that loves son or father or mother more than me or son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me." Are we willing to pay the price and say, "Lord, I'm I'm going to live the way you want me to live as a promise to him." He's given us in this Bible over 8,000 promises. Can we give him just one? &gt;&gt; Can you give him just one? Say, "Lord, I want to live the way you want me to." You stand with me tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I want to live the way he wants me to. I want to give until there's just no more to give. I want to know. Yes. There's just no more. I could never ever love the Lord. Father, tonight as we stand in this congregation here, Lord, every one of us knows ourselves, Lord, as we reminded tonight to to prove ourselves, to examine ourselves, to see if we're in the faith or not, Lord, are we somewhere wrong somewhere, Lord? Oh God, would you just show it to us, Lord, and that we can make it right? Because I I want to live, Lord, the the way you want me to live. I I want to give until there's just no more to give. I I'm willing to pay the price, Lord. Make the sacrifice, whatever it takes, Lord Jesus, that you might reign in this heart of mine, Lord. That I might be able to help others, Lord. that you would bless this this uh uh vessel here to be a blessing to others, Lord. And and that they could turn around and they could be a blessing to others. And Lord Jesus, they could just be a a a time of self-sacrifice of one for the other, putting our brother before us, Lord, preferring our brother before us. And Lord, not thinking of ourselves as being too highly. And Lord, humbling ourselves in your presence. Realize that as the prophet said, we're nothing. We are nothing, Lord. And we until we realize that we're nothing. Then God can come and make something out of that nothing. And Lord, tonight, Father, as we surrender and and we sing this song as a promise to you, not just words to speak out in a little nice little harmony, not because it sounds just right to the ear, but Lord, may it sound right to the heart as we sing this, Father. And and we just give our hearts to you, Lord, and say, "Father, this Sunday night, I I'm going to drive my stake in the ground tonight." Hallelujah. this 11th of January of 2026. And who'd ever thought we'd be here tonight, Lord, but you knew, Lord, we we drive the stake down and say, Lord, as of tonight, I'm willing to pay the price. I'm willing I'm willing to sacrifice, Lord. Lord, that I might be a living sacrifice unto God. Oh, bringing every thought to the obedience of Christ, Lord, as as I give myself to you, Lord Jesus. Father, we just ask it, Lord, as we sing this promise to you. Father, receive it from every every heart tonight. Lord, I'm going to live the way he wants me. I want to give until there's just more to give. I want to love to just no more love. I could never ever out love. Tell him that one more time. I am going to live the way he wants me to live. I'm going to give until there's just no to. I'm going to love love love till there's just no more love. I can never ever out of Amen. Praise the Lord. Let me enjoy the word of the Lord tonight. And so, um, this is brother Andy's, uh, father-in-law and mother-in-law, and they are going back to Haiti, and they've been with us for some time, and we certainly thank the Lord for the fellowship that we've had with them. They don't speak English, but they have been here rejoicing with us for some time. And if you heard the news and what's going on in Haiti, it's a lot of trauma and troubles there, bandits and gang members that have taken over uh many of those areas.

We want to commit that to the hand of the Lord. Amen. So, let's bow our heads. Ask for brother Chris, why don't you come pray with me? Brother Joe. Yes. both Joseph want to come just just to join my faith in prayer for the brother and his family and sister Angela and those those beautiful children and we'll just put it in God's hands once again. Dear Lord Jesus, you see the court case that's coming, Lord. And really, Lord, you are the judge. You're the righteous judge. And we'd never get a better deal than anyone outside of you, Lord. and whatever we need is in you. And Father, we just simply just ask your blessings on this entire case and what it's led up to.
