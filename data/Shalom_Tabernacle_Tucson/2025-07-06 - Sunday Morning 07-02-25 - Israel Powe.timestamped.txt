[9:41] I do not know
[9:47] just why
[9:49] he came to love me so.
[9:56] He looked beyond
[10:02] my walls.
[10:05] He saw my need.
[10:11] And I shall forever
[10:18] lift my eyes to Calary
[10:27] to view the cross
[10:32] where Jesus
[10:36] died for me.

[14:23] said, "No." He said, "Well, you can take
[14:25] it to the judgment, Lord."
[14:30] So he went there and the Lord said, "Did
[14:33] you lie? Have you stealed?"
[14:37] And he the man had done
[14:40] one souls to to Lord Jesus Christ. And
[14:46] he was felt like he was going to be cast

[25:42] Amen. Aren't you thankful for redemption
[25:44] this morning, church? Sure to be with
[25:46] each one of you. God bless you this
[25:48] morning. For our Sunday school report,
[25:50] we had 12 children, 10 Bibles, $9 in the
[25:54] offering this morning. So, it's nice to
[25:55] see a robust Sunday school. It's nice to
[25:58] be in church with each one of you. Our
[25:59] guests, Brother Rick's friends. I don't
[26:01] see Brother Rick. We're missing him. But
[26:03] our friends Faith and Danica, we're sure
[26:05] welcoming you this morning and
[26:07] appreciate you joining us for our prayer
[26:09] request. Kind of a praise report and
[26:11] prayer request for brother Ben Deasset
[26:13] Jr. He was in a severe car accident this
[26:16] week and just came away with some pretty
[26:18] good bumps and bruises. So we praise the
[26:20] Lord for sparing his life, but a lot to
[26:23] recover and the injuries and things. So
[26:26] you uphold uh Ben Jr. and the family in
[26:29] your prayer life.
[26:31] Want to remember mom Wheeler. Sister
[26:34] Carlina asked us to re remember Sister
[26:36] Wa this morning. So keep her in your
[26:39] upheld in your prayers. Our precious
[26:42] sister Heather Carpon in Canada passed
[26:44] with cancer this week. So remember the
[26:46] Carpon family, the Riley family in your
[26:48] prayer life. Still got some traveling.
[26:51] Sister Jesseline, different ones. So
[26:53] there's a seat missing by you. Let's uh
[26:55] remember those together. Let's all stand
[26:57] and we'll uphold Denise this morning.
[27:05] was still missing Sister Snow. I think
[27:07] she's back in town. Is that correct,
[27:08] Sister Barb? So, just keep her in
[27:10] prayer. The Lord would continue to mend
[27:13] her and her long recovery. Brother Bob,
[27:15] we might be missing him this morning.
[27:18] So, remember Brother Bob and the family
[27:20] as well. Dear God, we're so thankful to
[27:21] be in church. Lord, I'm res design
[27:23] resigned to you to give all. Lord, we're
[27:26] thankful for the redeeming blood that
[27:27] does that for us. We know that we can't
[27:31] merit this, Lord. Anything that we would
[27:33] say or do or in our lives, Lord, even
[27:36] many souls saved. And it's just filthy
[27:38] rags that we bring. We bring an
[27:40] offering, a sacrifice of praise this
[27:42] morning because of the righteousness of
[27:45] the perfect sacrifice, Lord, a precious
[27:47] lamb of God. And we're so thankful to
[27:49] reapply that token this morning to our
[27:52] lives, Lord, as we remember our families
[27:55] as well. And as Rahab of old, Lord, and
[27:58] bringing in them under that token, the
[28:00] the precious blood of the lamb, Lord
[28:02] Jesus, thank you for that this morning.
[28:04] We uphold our precious friends, the
[28:07] Daset family back in North Carolina.
[28:09] Lord, we understand Brother Ben Jr. was
[28:11] in a severe car wreck that you preserved
[28:14] his life. Lord, he must have yet a work
[28:16] to do. this young man is uh fairly new
[28:20] marriage. Lord, we hold them in prayer
[28:22] that you'd bless and keep them. Sister
[28:24] Wa, Lord, we miss her. We know she tries
[28:27] to stream and is getting up there in
[28:29] years and just needs the encouragement
[28:31] this morning. And we pray that she would
[28:33] know that we love her more than
[28:34] anything. Lord, we would want to do
[28:35] anything that we could to encourage her.
[28:37] And so we bring her and the family
[28:39] before you this morning. Sister Heather
[28:41] Carpon, the Carpent family, the Riley
[28:43] families with the loss of this mother,
[28:45] this sister. Lord, that you'd comfort
[28:48] them as only you can. May they look to
[28:50] the precious lamb as well this morning.
[28:52] Those traveling, those missing among us,
[28:54] Lord. Those streaming, pray that you'd
[28:57] comfort and be with them this morning as
[29:00] only you can. As we collect tithes and
[29:02] offerings, we know that you own
[29:04] everything, Lord. You don't necessarily
[29:06] need something, but you said you love a
[29:08] cheerful giver. So, we want to be that
[29:10] this morning and give to the kingdom of
[29:11] God. We know time is short. Father, we
[29:13] see the signs of the times. We're here
[29:15] to get a little closer draw to you,
[29:18] Lord. We pray for our precious pastor,
[29:19] Brother Israel. He means the world to
[29:21] us, his family. So, we uphold him in
[29:23] prayer that you'd speak through him this
[29:25] morning. We know that you will do that.
[29:27] May our ears be open to hear something
[29:28] from heaven today. We thank you for it.
[29:31] We love you. We appreciate you. In the
[29:33] precious and lovely name of our savior,
[29:34] the Lord Jesus Christ, all God's people
[29:37] say, "Amen."
[29:46] Let's go to the key of Bat.
[29:51] Oh, can't you hear the sound of heaven?
[29:58] It's the sound of penny waters.
[30:04] It's the sound of worship
[30:08] coming from the throne.
[30:15] Hear the cries of adoration.
[30:20] Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. As the
[30:23] saints from every nation
[30:29] lift their voice to make his glory
[30:35] known.
[30:39] They're singing
[30:41] holy, holy,
[30:44] holy are
[30:47] you.
[30:51] We're singing
[30:53] holy, hol,
[30:56] holy are you, Lord.
[31:01] [Music]
[31:04] All the elders and angels
[31:09] bow.
[31:11] The redeemed
[31:14] worship you now.
[31:18] Holy, holy,
[31:21] holy are you, Lord. Just sing that
[31:25] chorus to him again. Holy, holy. I'm
[31:29] singing.
[31:31] Holy, holy,
[31:34] holy arms
[31:37] you Lord.
[31:41] We're singing
[31:44] holy, holy,
[31:46] holy
[31:48] are
[31:49] you, Lord.
[31:54] All
[31:56] the elders
[31:58] angels bow.
[32:02] The redeemed
[32:04] to worship you now.
[32:09] Holy,
[32:11] holy, holy are you Lord.
[32:20] Oh yes. Holy, holy,
[32:25] holy
[32:27] are. Tell him that one more time. Holy,
[32:32] holy.
[32:34] Singing holy, holy,
[32:38] holy, holy,
[32:41] Lord.
[32:45] Amen. You can be seated. We'll sing a
[32:48] song together. the old rugged cross made
[32:50] the difference. After that, I have a
[32:52] song that I'd like to sing for you this
[32:54] morning and we'll turn the service over
[32:55] to our pastor.
[32:57] [Music]
[33:01] It was a life
[33:04] filled with aimless
[33:07] desperation.
[33:13] And without hope
[33:16] [Music]
[33:17] the shell
[33:19] of a man.
[33:24] All but then a hand
[33:28] with a nail print stretched downward.
[33:33] Oh, just one touch and there is just one
[33:37] touch
[33:39] and a new life.
[33:42] How many can say that's my testimony
[33:43] this morning? I'm so thankful for that.
[33:46] Oh, and the old
[33:50] rugged cross. It's what made the
[33:54] difference. In this life that was bound
[33:57] for heartache. In this life
[34:01] bound for heartache and defeat.
[34:08] Oh, I will praise him. I will praise him
[34:13] forever
[34:16] and ever.
[34:20] For the cross made all the difference
[34:26] for me.
[34:31] Old barren walls
[34:34] echoed harshness
[34:37] and anger.
[34:42] Little feet
[34:45] ran in terror
[34:48] to hide.
[34:52] But now those walls
[34:56] bring with love warmth and laughter
[35:04] for the giver
[35:06] of life.
[35:10] Let's sing that last verse. And there's
[35:11] a room filled with sad ashen faces. Know
[35:14] there's a room
[35:17] filled with sad
[35:20] ash and faces
[35:25] without home.
[35:28] Death had wrapped him
[35:31] in. Although we have nothing to be
[35:33] discouraged about this morning. For at
[35:36] the sight
[35:39] of a savior, there's
[35:42] rejoicing.
[35:43] [Music]
[35:46] For life it can be sealed
[35:52] in a tomb.
[35:56] [Music]
[35:58] The old
[36:00] rugged cross
[36:03] made the difference
[36:05] [Music]
[36:08] in this life
[36:10] bound for heartache
[36:13] and new fear.
[36:16] [Music]
[36:18] Oh, I will praise him
[36:22] forever
[36:24] and ever. How many can say that's your
[36:27] testimony this morning? I will praise
[36:31] him forever
[36:35] and ever. Yes, I'll praise you, Lord.
[36:40] I will praise
[36:42] him forever
[36:45] and ever.
[36:50] for the cross
[36:53] made the
[36:56] for me.
[37:00] [Music]
[37:02] [Applause]
[37:04] [Music]
[37:07] I live
[37:09] a wasted life
[37:12] that had no meaning.
[37:15] [Music]
[37:18] And I found no peace in anything
[37:25] that I tried.
[37:30] Oh, but I saw my life quickly end.
[37:37] [Music]
[37:38] And a brand
[37:40] new one began.
[37:46] The day
[37:48] I saw
[37:50] the cross where Jesus
[37:54] died.
[37:59] And because
[38:01] of Calary,
[38:05] I never will be the same again.
[38:11] [Music]
[38:13] I found
[38:15] the joy
[38:18] that I never
[38:21] thought could be.
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] Oh,
[38:29] he took a life
[38:31] that was shattered by sin.
[38:36] He put it together
[38:39] once again.
[38:44] Oh, and oh what a change there's been
[38:51] because of Calary.
[38:54] [Music]
[38:55] Hallelujah.
[38:59] Now where
[39:01] my heart is sad
[39:05] and growing weary.
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] Well then I just journey
[39:15] in my mind
[39:19] way back to Calary.
[39:25] [Music]
[39:26] And I kneel beneath
[39:30] its flow
[39:34] that washes
[39:36] white as snow.
[39:41] And I find your strength awaiting
[39:46] there for me.
[39:50] [Music]
[39:53] And it's because
[39:56] of Calvary.
[39:58] I'll never
[40:00] be the same again. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[40:07] I found
[40:09] the joy
[40:11] that I never
[40:15] thought could be.
[40:19] [Music]
[40:22] He took a life
[40:25] shattered by sin.
[40:29] He put it together
[40:32] once again.
[40:36] And oh, what a change there's been
[40:43] because of Calary.
[40:48] Yes, it's because
[40:51] of Calary.
[40:54] I will never
[40:57] be the same again. Oh, I found that joy.
[41:03] I found that joy
[41:07] that I never
[41:11] thought could be.
[41:15] [Music]
[41:18] He took a life
[41:21] shattered by sin.
[41:25] He put it together
[41:28] once again.
[41:33] And oh, what a change there's been.
[41:39] I know my life will never be the same
[41:44] again.
[41:46] because of Calary.
[41:56] Hallelujah.
[41:58] Hallelujah.
[42:00] [Music]
[42:03] Maybe we could just play that chorus. So
[42:05] I'll cherish the old rugged cross as our
[42:06] pastor comes this morning.
[42:09] So I'll cherish
[42:13] the old ruged
[42:16] cross
[42:21] until my trophies
[42:25] at last.
[42:27] I lay down
[42:33] and I will cling
[42:36] to the old rugged
[42:40] cross
[42:44] and I'll exchange
[42:47] it someday
[42:50] for a crown.
[42:54] Jesus
[43:03] [Music]
[43:08] Christ
[43:10] [Music]
[43:14] down.
[43:18] [Music]
[43:36] for a crown.
[43:38] Let us bow our heads and pray. Lord
[43:41] Jesus, we thank you for bringing us
[43:43] together once again. Lord, as we come
[43:46] into this place,
[43:48] uh, this portion of the service, Lord,
[43:50] the preaching of your word, Lord, we
[43:52] thank you for the worship that has gone
[43:54] forth, Lord. Father, you're truly worthy
[43:57] to be praised.
[43:59] And Lord, we lift up our hearts to give
[44:01] you the praise today. We thank you,
[44:04] Father. You've been so good to us and
[44:08] our future, our life is in your hand.
[44:12] And we've laid,
[44:14] oh God, we counted up the cost and we've
[44:17] made our decision to follow you, Lord.
[44:20] And in following you, Lord, we follow
[44:22] your word. We follow the scriptures by
[44:26] the Holy Spirit. And Lord, lead us today
[44:30] into the greener pastures of the word
[44:34] that our souls can be filled
[44:37] with the vitamins needed to overcome in
[44:40] this hour. Give us rapturing faith,
[44:43] Lord. Give us faith to get up out of the
[44:46] grave one day. Give us faith for a body
[44:49] change and also faith Lord for our
[44:54] immediate needs and circumstances and
[44:56] problems, sicknesses, diseases, requests
[45:00] for our families and all the other
[45:04] things that we desire that's acquired
[45:06] through faith. Now bless us now we pray.
[45:09] Bless each one we ask in Jesus name.
[45:12] Amen. Amen. God bless each of you
[45:15] saints. It's so good to be in the house
[45:16] of the Lord with you today. We welcome
[45:19] you to the house of the Lord. So happy
[45:21] to have you with us. Amen. And so I
[45:25] trust that um the Lord Jesus will bless
[45:27] you with something that you can take
[45:30] with you that will stay with you for the
[45:32] rest of your life. Amen.
[45:34] So we welcome you to the house of the
[45:36] Lord. Tonight we're going to have um
[45:39] we'll do the voting for the brothers.
[45:42] And first of all, I apologize for
[45:44] putting it off for so long. We've really
[45:46] no excuse. We just could put it off. We
[45:49] had the the financial report put
[45:51] together back in March. Brother John
[45:54] actually helped us with that with some
[45:55] of the stuff that we needed for our
[45:57] paperwork and brother Chris indeed was
[46:00] ready. But we have
[46:03] so many different changes and different
[46:05] people traveling and myself. But so
[46:08] we'll do that tonight. We've had kind of
[46:10] brother uh Galante lingering kind of
[46:14] just hanging out there and we wanted to
[46:16] dedicate him and so but we'll go through
[46:19] the vote process first if that's okay. I
[46:22] would love to dedicate him on a Sunday
[46:24] morning. I think that's more better. But
[46:25] we'll do that tonight after the vote. I
[46:28] just trust that all would be well. So on
[46:30] the ballot there that will be given to
[46:33] you after at the end of this service
[46:35] this morning. We'll dis and um we will
[46:40] um how will we do that? So, brother
[46:43] Chris will come up afterwards and give
[46:44] the financial report. We'll dismiss the
[46:48] main audience and the members,
[46:50] tiesayers, supporters can remain. We'll
[46:53] go through that financial report and
[46:55] then we'll give you a ballot at the end
[46:56] of the service. You take that home,
[46:59] think about it, pray about it. You need
[47:01] a week to contemplate on who to vote
[47:04] for. Yes or no? But it shouldn't take
[47:07] that long, I don't think. But
[47:11] we will calculate those tonight and then
[47:14] uh bring the results tonight, the Lord
[47:17] willing. And so, um,
[47:22] small twist on the board there, Brother
[47:24] Scott is put in his 10 years of service
[47:29] and and Amy's done a very fine job with
[47:32] that.
[47:33] And so thank the Lord for him.
[47:40] So he said enough is enough. No. And so
[47:43] we appreciate brother Scott's service
[47:45] and done a wonderful job and he is going
[47:48] to step down from that post and it'll
[47:51] give an opportunity for someone else to
[47:53] step in there. In the meantime, we also
[47:57] have brotherh Edward McFaten. He'll be
[48:01] he's been in our some of our meetings
[48:03] and talking about bringing him along and
[48:05] so he will be put on the ballot tonight
[48:08] to vote for as a trustee along with
[48:11] brother Joe Galante and um of course
[48:15] others in the church do a phenomenal job
[48:19] in helping us. They do the work of
[48:21] deacons and trustees and we lean on many
[48:24] of you brothers and this is not making
[48:26] one group of brothers better than the
[48:28] other but this is part of the process of
[48:31] the body. This is your opportunity to
[48:34] speak and you have a you normally have a
[48:37] place for comments but you can put a
[48:38] comment on the back there. Say something
[48:41] good. I only want the good comments
[48:44] actually. So,
[48:46] no, put honest report, something on
[48:49] there, encouragement, what you can see,
[48:51] what you say, whatever. Also, we always
[48:54] have in the back there a little box that
[48:56] you can put your comments in. I'm always
[48:59] available by my phone or I'm I pretty
[49:03] much live here uh many days of the week
[49:07] I'm here. So, I'm easy to find, easy to
[49:09] get a hold of. If you if you can catch
[49:12] me, I can sit down and talk with you if
[49:15] you need that. All right. So, we always
[49:17] want to be available and the deacons and
[49:19] trustees
[49:20] um are available. Brother Joe, a deacon,
[49:23] brother Joe Galante on the ballot there,
[49:26] trustee Edward McFaten, and brother
[49:28] Chris Smith, treasurer, and these
[49:31] brothers along with brother Scott have
[49:33] done a phenomenal job. And I would just
[49:36] thank the Lord for them. Amen. And so
[49:39] we'll do that this after after the um
[49:43] after the service this morning. We'll
[49:45] dismiss the main crowd. The saints tithe
[49:48] payers voters will set. We'll go over
[49:50] the financial report very quickly and
[49:53] then give you the ballot and then you
[49:55] can bring that back and we'll announce
[49:57] the results tonight. All right.
[50:00] Now, how many visitors are here? God
[50:03] bless you two visitors. Welcome. Happy
[50:06] to have you here. that were you invited
[50:09] to come? Oh, good. I'm glad you accepted
[50:11] the invitation. And so, um, you know, we
[50:14] give out a lot of invitations. And who
[50:17] is that? Oh, Rick. Brother Rick. All
[50:19] right.
[50:20] Huh.
[50:22] Okay. Well, I don't know. So, this is
[50:25] how it goes to you visitors. Uh, we
[50:28] invite people all the time on our job at
[50:30] work and you run into people. Hey, what
[50:32] church you go to? Oh, I go over here.
[50:34] What time is the service? Oh, this is
[50:35] what time. Hey, I'd like to come. Oh,
[50:37] we'd love for you to come. I'll be there
[50:39] Sunday. And most of the time, they don't
[50:42] show up. How many know what I'm talking
[50:44] about? You give those invitations out,
[50:47] they don't show up. So, when when the
[50:48] visitors do show up, we appreciate you
[50:50] coming and we trust the Lord will bless
[50:52] you. Welcome. Amen. And so, um, we got
[50:56] back from our trip. We went there uh for
[50:59] brother Ferguson's 75th birthday party
[51:03] and we went up there for the weekend and
[51:06] um had a great time. I did not get any
[51:10] rest at all. It was a very strenuous
[51:14] trip and I came back. I looked in my
[51:18] face. It looked like I had been digging
[51:21] ditches. Maybe I was tired and I didn't
[51:25] really even do anything. just ran up and
[51:28] down and so forth. But the week before
[51:30] that, Levi and I were able to do some
[51:32] fishing. And that time, I did get a
[51:34] rest. And so, I I'm glad to be back. My
[51:38] wife, Sister Sharon, is home. She's
[51:41] fighting this infection of some kind.
[51:43] It's a flu or something. It's really uh
[51:47] knocked her down. So, please pray for
[51:49] her that the Lord would strengthen her
[51:51] and bring her back um in strength. And
[51:55] so, all right. So, God bless each of
[51:58] you. Um, you're getting a little bit of
[52:01] a late start, but not too bad. We like
[52:04] to go and I do want to read a Psalms,
[52:06] and it's Psalms chapter 80. If you can
[52:09] stand and turn with me there.
[52:28] And then we'll take a scripture in Mark
[52:32] chapter 4, a parable of Jesus.
[52:41] And we'll read this together as a class.
[52:43] I'll read the first verse and as a class
[52:46] you can alternate
[52:49] all the evens. I'll take the odds and
[52:52] we'll take the last verse all together.
[52:54] If you don't have a Bible, they normally
[52:57] put it up on the screen for you. And if
[53:00] you don't have a Bible, we would love to
[53:02] give you one. You just put that request
[53:05] in and we'll get you a Bible. Amen.
[53:10] You know, it's interesting as returning
[53:12] there when I went to Liberia, this
[53:15] version Bible, this Scullfield Bible, it
[53:18] has the 100redy year anniversary in
[53:20] there, some pictures and so forth.
[53:22] Brother Hughes gave many of the brothers
[53:26] that Bible and for many of them that was
[53:28] the first time they saw that version of
[53:31] the Bible, that Scoffield edition, and
[53:33] they were so happy and blessed to get
[53:35] it. And I thought I thought everybody
[53:38] had access to it, but doesn't work that
[53:41] way. Um when you travel, you'll see how
[53:44] other people live and do and what they
[53:47] have to go through. And so we we want to
[53:50] be faithful and providing the word of
[53:52] God to those that need it. Amen.
[53:58] Psalms 80 verse1. Give ear, oh shepherd
[54:00] of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
[54:04] a flock. Thou that dwellest
[54:08] between the cherubims, shine forth.
[54:16] Come and save us.
[54:18] Turn us again, oh God, and cause thy
[54:20] face to shine, and we shall be saved.
[54:23] Oh Lord,
[54:25] how long would thou be against the
[54:28] prayer of thy people? Thou feedest them
[54:31] with the bread of tears, and givest them
[54:33] tears to drink in great measure.
[54:36] Thou wickedest us to strife.
[54:43] Turn us again, oh God of hosts, and
[54:46] cause thy face to shine, and we shall be
[54:50] saved.
[54:58] Thou preparest room before it and did
[55:01] this cause it to take deep root and it
[55:03] filled the land.
[55:12] So she sent out her bows unto the sea
[55:15] and her branches unto the river.
[55:22] There it is.
[55:26] The boar out of the wood doth waste it,
[55:30] and the wild beast of the field doth
[55:33] devour it.
[55:37] [Music]
[55:44] And the vineyard which thy right hand
[55:46] hath planted and the branch that thou
[55:49] madeest is strong for thyself.
[55:52] It is burned as fire is cut down that
[55:56] perish.
[55:59] Let thy hand be upon the man
[56:03] of thy right hand upon the son of man
[56:05] whom thou madeest strong for thyself.
[56:09] So we will
[56:12] quick
[56:15] alto together. Turn us again, oh Lord
[56:18] God of hosts. Cause thy face to shine
[56:22] and we shall be saved.
[56:25] Isn't that what you want today?
[56:27] You want the Lord to shine his face upon
[56:31] you
[56:32] to turn us towards his great goodness
[56:36] that he has for us. Amen. One more
[56:38] scripture found in Mark chapter number
[56:41] four.
[57:04] in verse number 13.
[57:09] And he said unto them, this is our Lord
[57:11] Jesus.
[57:15] Know ye not this parable? And how then
[57:18] will ye know all parables? The swer
[57:22] sweeth the word. And these are they by
[57:24] the wayside where the word is sown. But
[57:27] when they have heard, Satan cometh
[57:30] immediately and taketh away the word
[57:34] that was sown in their hearts.
[57:38] Amen. Let us pray. Lord Jesus, we ask
[57:41] your blessings on this service today.
[57:45] Bless every heart we pray. have your way
[57:48] in the meeting this morning in Jesus
[57:51] name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'm
[57:54] going to take you may be seated. The
[57:57] title of the sermon this morning is the
[58:00] placing of the seed.
[58:02] The placing of the seed. We've been
[58:06] going through the orders of adoption.
[58:08] How a son is born into a family in the
[58:12] in in Israel. After 8 days, that child
[58:16] is circumcised
[58:17] and then it would be a son, but it would
[58:22] have to grow up until the time appointed
[58:24] that he would be adopted. It's a Greek
[58:28] or a Roman ceremony really, but the
[58:32] scriptures well speak of it in uh the
[58:36] New Testament. The apostle Paul talks
[58:38] about how a heir
[58:41] different nothing he he's no different
[58:43] than a servant. A son and a servant.
[58:46] They're born in the same house. But a
[58:48] son has to prove himself to be worthy of
[58:52] the father's business. And then that
[58:55] father has a ceremony, robes that child
[58:59] and adopts him or places him as an
[59:02] official son where now you can have my
[59:06] checkbook. What I say, you can say. It's
[59:10] the same voice. You have the authority.
[59:13] I've given that to you. This is a public
[59:15] ceremony and this is the position that
[59:18] the believers are predestinated to.
[59:22] Amen. So, we know that all of our tests
[59:26] and trials and all that we would go
[59:29] through is pointing us to this great
[59:33] adoption.
[59:35] As believers, it's in the scriptures. We
[59:38] are predestinated to the adoption of
[59:42] children, the adoption of sons.
[59:45] And I fear that maybe we don't talk
[59:48] about it enough. Maybe that word might
[59:52] throw us off a little bit, the adoption
[59:54] word, but it's really the placing of the
[59:58] son. And so, every son or daughter of
[1:00:01] God, Christian, young person, older
[1:00:04] person, they have a place.
[1:00:08] And we all want to find our place.
[1:00:12] And we can be very good, very talented,
[1:00:17] very gifted and very capable of doing
[1:00:22] many many tasks
[1:00:25] and uh most of us I would say all of us
[1:00:28] has a strength that's unique to us. If I
[1:00:32] were to sit and talk to each of you, you
[1:00:35] have something about you, a certain
[1:00:37] little making that made you who you are.
[1:00:41] And it's unique to you. I could never
[1:00:43] replace that. You couldn't replace the
[1:00:46] person sitting next to you. God made us
[1:00:49] all very different. And we all have a
[1:00:52] unique purpose.
[1:00:54] And so, we all have a place.
[1:00:57] This hand has five fingers. It has a
[1:00:59] thumb. and they're all placed in a
[1:01:01] particular order and they're there.
[1:01:04] Someone put them there. But what we can
[1:01:08] do that is um maybe on the negative side
[1:01:11] if we can take our gifts, our talents,
[1:01:14] our abilities and then move or use them
[1:01:18] in the wrong way. It's misplaced.
[1:01:23] And so the great tempter, Satan, is the
[1:01:25] one behind this challenge of trying to
[1:01:30] get you out of your position, out of
[1:01:32] your place. Remember, Satan wants you to
[1:01:36] take a position, too.
[1:01:39] The Holy Spirit wants you to take a
[1:01:41] position.
[1:01:43] And Satan in the beginning, he was
[1:01:45] Lucifer. He had troubles and problems in
[1:01:50] heaven because of position,
[1:01:54] because of the placing. He wanted more.
[1:01:57] He needed more authority. He wanted to
[1:01:59] be above this. He wanted and he had
[1:02:02] everything. It seemingly he was the most
[1:02:04] beautiful. He was the most gifted, the
[1:02:06] most talented. And he was the son of the
[1:02:09] mourning. Lucifer was his name. But
[1:02:12] iniquity was found in his heart. And
[1:02:15] there is the first battles that we see.
[1:02:19] They started in heaven, not on the
[1:02:21] earth. And then that battle from heaven
[1:02:24] drops down on the earth. And now this is
[1:02:27] what all of our battles has to deal
[1:02:29] with. Our position, our placing. Have I
[1:02:34] found my position in my place? And so
[1:02:38] it's the placing of the seed. Everything
[1:02:40] has to find its position. And in this
[1:02:42] parable in Mark chapter 4, we'll see
[1:02:46] that Jesus gives them this parable. If
[1:02:49] you take time, you can read it starting
[1:02:51] from verse three. And Jesus said, "There
[1:02:54] was a swer that sowed. It came to pass
[1:02:57] that some fell by the wayside and the
[1:03:00] fowls came and devoured it. Some on
[1:03:02] stony ground where there was not much
[1:03:05] earth. Immediately it sprang up but
[1:03:08] because it had no depth of earth.
[1:03:11] Uh but when the sun was up it was
[1:03:14] scorched because it had no root it
[1:03:16] withered away. Some fell amongst thorns
[1:03:19] the thorns grew up and other fell on
[1:03:22] good ground. This is out of five or four
[1:03:27] um places that the seed couldn't fall.
[1:03:30] There's only one place that the seed
[1:03:32] really should fall and that is in good
[1:03:34] ground.
[1:03:35] So the seed itself needs a place. It has
[1:03:40] a position.
[1:03:42] And although it's the true seed, it's
[1:03:44] the swer sewing the seed. It's the word
[1:03:47] of God, it's Jesus himself sewing the
[1:03:50] seed, if you sew the seed in the wrong
[1:03:52] place, you'll get the wrong results.
[1:03:55] Huh?
[1:03:57] So, it's not just being right,
[1:04:00] but it's being right and in the right
[1:04:03] place.
[1:04:05] It's not just knowing who you are, but
[1:04:07] it's knowing who you are and knowing
[1:04:10] where you belong.
[1:04:12] Amen.
[1:04:14] It's a lot of people that were eligible
[1:04:16] to get married when I was single. A lot
[1:04:19] of sisters available, but they and
[1:04:23] legally I could have married whoever.
[1:04:25] But there come a time I needed to find
[1:04:27] the right one.
[1:04:29] And that's you need supernatural
[1:04:31] instructions with that. And when you
[1:04:34] find the right one, it's the right
[1:04:36] place, it settles it.
[1:04:39] And although others can be qualified,
[1:04:41] although others maybe can can do the job
[1:04:45] as a wife, but God had one specially for
[1:04:48] me. That that was Sister Sharon.
[1:04:51] Can I brag on her a minute since she
[1:04:53] ain't here?
[1:04:56] Never mind. I won't brag on her. But she
[1:04:58] was the one for me. That's it for the
[1:05:02] rest of my life.
[1:05:04] That is it. That was our place. We found
[1:05:09] that. And so the seed had to find the
[1:05:12] its right place. You know this position.
[1:05:16] you'll see that Satan is behind
[1:05:20] causing great trauma and damage
[1:05:24] throughout the scripture. And I just did
[1:05:26] a little marginal on his um the word
[1:05:30] Satan. Of course, you can take the devil
[1:05:32] as well. And in the Old Testament, they
[1:05:35] might use the word the accuser. Some
[1:05:38] translations won't use the word Satan,
[1:05:40] but it's the same being that we're
[1:05:42] talking about. And we first see this
[1:05:45] character, one of the first places in
[1:05:47] 1st Chronicles 21. I want you to turn
[1:05:50] there just quickly.
[1:05:53] And this is King David.
[1:06:00] He's over Israel.
[1:06:04] in in 1 Chronicles 21. It's also in 2
[1:06:09] Samuel
[1:06:11] uh chapter 24. And the Bible says, "And
[1:06:15] Satan stood up against Israel." And what
[1:06:18] he do? Well, let me let me Some of you
[1:06:21] are turning there. This is Satan. He's
[1:06:23] standing up against Israel. And look at
[1:06:25] what he does. He provokes David to
[1:06:28] number Israel.
[1:06:31] And so David gets this in his head. He
[1:06:33] gets this in his mind. I do not think
[1:06:36] Satan came in his person as Satan and
[1:06:40] said, "Hey, David, I am Satan. I want to
[1:06:43] talk to you. I want to provoke you to do
[1:06:46] something against the will of God." And
[1:06:48] do not think that's the way it happened.
[1:06:50] You follow the scriptures. Satan is very
[1:06:53] shrewd.
[1:06:55] He's a thief and he knows he's a thief.
[1:06:58] He's a crook and he knows he's a crook.
[1:07:01] He's a liar and he knows he's a liar and
[1:07:04] he doesn't want you to know that he's
[1:07:06] the liar though. So he has to hide
[1:07:09] himself under the canopy of truth or
[1:07:13] where things that are decent and holy
[1:07:15] are. And he hides in that like he
[1:07:18] pretends to be your friend or pretends
[1:07:21] to really care for you when all along
[1:07:23] he's trying to nail you.
[1:07:26] And so Satan is now going to provoke
[1:07:30] David. I wonder I wonder how that
[1:07:34] happened. I wonder was it a thought in
[1:07:35] his head? I wonder did he read of
[1:07:38] another king that did the same thing? I
[1:07:40] wondered how this provoke this provoking
[1:07:43] happened for David to do this that was
[1:07:46] contrary.
[1:07:48] He's even his captain Joab says, "David,
[1:07:50] what are you doing?"
[1:07:53] And David does it anyway. number them. I
[1:07:55] want to number them. And when he does
[1:07:58] it,
[1:07:59] God is angered at him for it. The
[1:08:03] prophet comes to him and tells him,
[1:08:06] "What you did, David, was wrong." And
[1:08:08] David can say, "Well, the devil made me
[1:08:10] do it." Yes, the devil did make you do
[1:08:13] it. The devil provoked you, but he
[1:08:17] didn't make you.
[1:08:19] He presented it to you. He worked it up
[1:08:21] in your mind and you made the decision
[1:08:24] to do what the devil wanted you to do.
[1:08:28] If the devil made you do it, then the
[1:08:32] devil can make you kill yourself. He can
[1:08:37] make you jump off a bridge. He can make
[1:08:39] you. No, he cannot make you. All that he
[1:08:42] can do is what God would allow him to do
[1:08:45] to you.
[1:08:46] You have to make the choice. You have to
[1:08:48] make the decision. Amen.
[1:08:50] How many here today knows of cases where
[1:08:54] Satan provokes you? He whispered to you.
[1:08:57] He got you in a trap. He baited the trap
[1:09:00] and then he got you.
[1:09:03] How many of you here can Christians can
[1:09:05] say that
[1:09:06] and look back and say, you know what,
[1:09:08] that dirty devil,
[1:09:10] it was the devil all along. Right.
[1:09:14] But I didn't know it was if I had known
[1:09:16] it was the devil, I wouldn't have I
[1:09:18] would I wouldn't have I wouldn't even
[1:09:19] conversated with him.
[1:09:20] If I would have known it was the devil
[1:09:22] in all of this, I would have never
[1:09:24] engaged with him.
[1:09:26] I would have handled him differently.
[1:09:28] I wouldn't have went out to lunch with
[1:09:30] him if I knew it was the devil.
[1:09:33] Can I get a witness?
[1:09:36] The devil wants your phone number.
[1:09:38] You going to give it to him?
[1:09:41] Wants your email account.
[1:09:44] want your contact info. You'll give it
[1:09:46] to the devil,
[1:09:48] but you'll give it to a handsome guy,
[1:09:49] won't you?
[1:09:51] And that just might be the devil.
[1:09:55] Y'all ain't saying that then. It's all
[1:09:56] right.
[1:09:59] So, Satan provokes David to do this.
[1:10:03] Let's take one more. In Job chapter 1,
[1:10:08] just show you these some of these
[1:10:09] dynamics, how he moves and how he works.
[1:10:12] There was a day when the sons of God
[1:10:14] came to present themselves before the
[1:10:16] Lord. Satan came also among them. And
[1:10:20] the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence come
[1:10:22] thou?" Then Satan answered the Lord. He
[1:10:26] answered the Lord and said, "From going
[1:10:28] to and fro in the earth, from walking up
[1:10:30] and down in it?" And the Lord said unto
[1:10:33] Satan, "Hast thou considered my servant
[1:10:38] Job,
[1:10:40] that there is none like him in the
[1:10:42] earth, a perfect and an upright wind,
[1:10:44] one that fearth God and assureth evil."
[1:10:47] So the Lord is asking Satan, "What are
[1:10:49] you doing, man? Where are you going?" He
[1:10:51] said, "I'm just going up and down the
[1:10:52] earth, doing this. Have you considered
[1:10:54] my servant Job?"
[1:10:57] Out of all the sons of God that came
[1:10:59] here, the Lord points out Job. The Lord
[1:11:03] asks questions not because he don't know
[1:11:05] the answer. Remember that. He already
[1:11:08] knows the answer. And Satan answered,
[1:11:10] "The Lord thus Job fear God for not?
[1:11:14] Hast not thou made a hedge about him
[1:11:16] about his house and about all that he
[1:11:18] hath on every side? Thou hast blessed
[1:11:21] the work of his hands? His substance is
[1:11:23] increased in the land. But put forth thy
[1:11:26] hand now, and touch all that he hath,
[1:11:28] and he will curse thee to thy face. And
[1:11:30] the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all
[1:11:34] that he hath is in thy power, only upon
[1:11:38] himself, put not forth thy hand. So
[1:11:42] Satan is sizing Job up.
[1:11:47] He's looking at him top to bottom.
[1:11:51] And when he comes before the Lord, he
[1:11:54] actually tells the Lord, "You have a
[1:11:56] hedge around this man."
[1:11:59] Now, if Satan sized you up today,
[1:12:04] if Satan, the accuser of the brethren,
[1:12:08] our main and common enemy that we all
[1:12:11] have, remember, I'm not your enemy.
[1:12:14] Brother, sister, is not your enemy.
[1:12:16] Satan is our enemy.
[1:12:19] And if he was to size you up today, what
[1:12:22] what would he see? What would he see?
[1:12:24] How how where's the flaw at in you?
[1:12:27] Where's the weak spot in you? He looks
[1:12:29] him up. He says, "You have a hedge
[1:12:31] around this man
[1:12:34] over all that he has." And this is a
[1:12:37] conversation that Satan is having with
[1:12:41] God about a son.
[1:12:45] Remember when Satan is let loose on Job
[1:12:47] and takes all that he has and goes
[1:12:49] through his family, goes through his
[1:12:51] wealth and goes through everything that
[1:12:53] he has, he never, you never hear no
[1:12:56] mention of Satan ever talking to Job.
[1:12:58] There's no other quotations of Satan
[1:13:01] ever saying that it's me doing all this
[1:13:03] to you. He lays quiet. He lays silently
[1:13:07] after he did all the damage and the dust
[1:13:09] is now settling. his friends come to
[1:13:12] console him. And all of this happened
[1:13:15] because of Satan was turned loose on me.
[1:13:21] And remember last Wednesday or two
[1:13:22] Wednesdays ago, we're talking about
[1:13:24] Joseph.
[1:13:26] You remember that anointed brother
[1:13:27] Joseph and how God would use him and
[1:13:31] anointed him in Piper's house and
[1:13:33] anointed him with gifts and and and how
[1:13:36] how he was just the Lord blessed him. He
[1:13:39] was a slave. Yes. But then Piper's
[1:13:41] house, he rose up to where he had a
[1:13:44] great position in Pterer's house. And
[1:13:47] his integrity was intact. His service
[1:13:50] was intact. And the Egyptians loved him.
[1:13:54] Potterer loved him.
[1:13:57] And it's just a beautiful target for a
[1:14:01] nice fat juicy lie to be told. Right?
[1:14:06] That's what that is. This is your reward
[1:14:08] for being faithful.
[1:14:11] This is your reward for standing for
[1:14:12] what's true and what's right.
[1:14:16] Is there is coming a test
[1:14:19] and that test is coming to position you
[1:14:21] or to move you. So, Joseph needs to move
[1:14:25] to another prison. He's things are going
[1:14:28] too good for him. So, we need to get him
[1:14:30] in Pharaoh's house. But in order to get
[1:14:33] him there, we need to test him. We need
[1:14:35] to position him. And we need to move
[1:14:37] him. And we move him by dropping another
[1:14:40] test in his life.
[1:14:43] You know, finding our position, it can
[1:14:46] be
[1:14:48] quite complicated because Satan wants
[1:14:50] all of us to take a position through
[1:14:53] pride, through greed.
[1:14:57] He wants us to take somebody else's
[1:14:59] position.
[1:15:01] He wants us to get in power, to get in
[1:15:04] authority by breaking all the rules. And
[1:15:07] the same Holy Spirit is trying to get us
[1:15:10] in position and authority and power by
[1:15:14] doing it the right way.
[1:15:18] Is that right or wrong?
[1:15:19] The Holy Spirit is trying to place his
[1:15:23] church who was here on Wednesday night
[1:15:26] when he talked about speaking the word.
[1:15:30] and calling cancer out of a
[1:15:32] congregation,
[1:15:34] delivering saints, the little sheep that
[1:15:37] are afflicted by Satan's power.
[1:15:40] That God rose up sons and daughters of
[1:15:43] God with the power of the Holy Spirit to
[1:15:47] deliver them.
[1:15:48] But what happens? Satan gets in there
[1:15:51] and he misguides our our ambitions.
[1:15:56] So now we want things that we shouldn't
[1:15:59] want and we desire things that shouldn't
[1:16:02] we shouldn't desire.
[1:16:05] We want to be like Ephraim or we want to
[1:16:07] be like the other sister. We want you
[1:16:10] know brother so and so's wife or sister
[1:16:13] so and so's husband or we envy their
[1:16:16] children. We envy their church and we
[1:16:18] envy this other successful group and
[1:16:21] these other people and it's full of it.
[1:16:24] Yes sir. But when you find your place
[1:16:28] and you know your place, then it doesn't
[1:16:31] really matter what others are doing.
[1:16:34] Really,
[1:16:37] you remember the parable when Jesus paid
[1:16:40] those agreed to them for a penny for a
[1:16:42] day. Remember that
[1:16:44] they agreed to pay, they agreed to work
[1:16:46] in the harvest. What's the agreement? A
[1:16:48] penny for the day. Is that a deal? Deal.
[1:16:51] Got a deal. We'll work for a penny for
[1:16:54] I'm so glad. Man, I'm so appreciative of
[1:16:55] this job, Lord. I'm so glad to have this
[1:16:58] job for a penny for the day. And then as
[1:17:01] the time goes on, others come in at the
[1:17:03] last minute. Like some church folks,
[1:17:06] they come in in at the last minute.
[1:17:11] They showed up late and they come in and
[1:17:13] they just start dancing in the spirit
[1:17:15] and get the blessing of the Lord. and
[1:17:17] you showed up early and you just as dry
[1:17:19] and cold as
[1:17:23] like what's going on here? I was here
[1:17:25] first.
[1:17:26] I should be the one getting blessed.
[1:17:29] Well, your blessing is there. Go get it.
[1:17:33] Here these are working. So appreciative
[1:17:35] to get this job. I'm so happy to be
[1:17:37] here. I'm glad for the opportunity.
[1:17:39] Lord, I work. And then you find out
[1:17:41] others come in late and they get paid.
[1:17:44] How much of y'all get paid?
[1:17:47] How? How? Wait, when did y'all start?
[1:17:49] Oh, we just got in. I'm so glad to be
[1:17:51] here. You glad to be here? I've been
[1:17:54] here since 6 a.m. this morning. And you
[1:17:57] glad to be How much you paying you? They
[1:17:59] You better not tell me we getting paid
[1:18:00] the same.
[1:18:03] How much they paying you? I'm getting a
[1:18:05] penny a day. Oh man.
[1:18:09] Unbelievable. I hate this job.
[1:18:16] Now the blessing, the job that it was
[1:18:18] supposed to be, you should have been
[1:18:19] appreciative of, now you're all twisted.
[1:18:22] You're all upset. Why? The agreement
[1:18:24] didn't change. The amount didn't change.
[1:18:27] The only thing that changed is that you
[1:18:28] saw somebody else get something that you
[1:18:34] feel like it didn't belong to them.
[1:18:36] This is Satan now. This is Satan at his
[1:18:39] greatest.
[1:18:41] He moves in congregations.
[1:18:43] moves and causes is called emulations,
[1:18:47] competition,
[1:18:49] competing against
[1:18:52] Lord Jesus, help me
[1:18:55] to keep my nose in your business
[1:18:59] and out of everybody else's business to
[1:19:02] stay on the battlefield for the Lord to
[1:19:05] hold the position and post that God
[1:19:08] called me to.
[1:19:10] Lord, help us. And so we see Satan, he
[1:19:13] confuses all of this. And we see Job. We
[1:19:16] see him there in Matthew chapter 16.
[1:19:20] The Lord's talking about how Satan, if
[1:19:23] he cast out Satan, his kingdom would be
[1:19:25] divided. Continues in Mark chapter 3.
[1:19:29] And it's our text this morning
[1:19:34] that these by the wayside.
[1:19:39] Let's read it just quickly. I know my
[1:19:42] time is rolling up really fast, but Mark
[1:19:47] talks about
[1:19:50] in verse 13 says, "Know ye not this
[1:19:53] parable?" It's like he's saying, "Do you
[1:19:55] not understand this parable?
[1:19:58] How then will you understand the other
[1:20:00] parables? But a few verses before that,
[1:20:03] he says, "It wasn't given to them to
[1:20:05] know these things, but you was given."
[1:20:08] I love that balance, how the Lord puts
[1:20:12] it on us. But then, you know, it's on
[1:20:14] him, too, though. If he doesn't open
[1:20:17] your eyes to see it, you're not going to
[1:20:19] see it.
[1:20:20] But then he asked the question, if you
[1:20:22] don't know this, how are you going to
[1:20:24] know the other parables? So like the
[1:20:27] revelation that we need in our life, we
[1:20:30] should be praying for it. We should be
[1:20:32] studying and digging for it. New
[1:20:33] Christians, new believers should be
[1:20:36] taking down every scripture that's
[1:20:39] mentioned in the service and going back
[1:20:42] and reading those things so the Holy
[1:20:45] Spirit can
[1:20:47] position them
[1:20:49] and place them in the word of God.
[1:20:54] Know ye not that this parable? And how
[1:20:57] then will you know all the parish? The
[1:20:59] swer
[1:21:01] sweethth the word.
[1:21:03] These are they by the side where the
[1:21:06] word is sown. But when they have heard
[1:21:09] Satan cometh immediately
[1:21:13] and taketh away the word that was sown
[1:21:16] in their heart. That immediately is
[1:21:18] mentioned again in verse 17.
[1:21:22] Verse 16. And these are they likewise
[1:21:24] which are sown on stony ground who when
[1:21:27] they have heard the word immediately
[1:21:29] receiveth it with gladness and have no
[1:21:31] root in themselves and so endure. But
[1:21:35] for a time afterward when affliction and
[1:21:38] persecution ariseth for the word's sake
[1:21:40] immediately they are offended.
[1:21:45] So these these two happenings here
[1:21:48] there's four of them. One is the seed
[1:21:50] falls on good ground. And in these two
[1:21:53] happenings, he he that heareth the word,
[1:21:55] then Satan comes to take the word that
[1:21:58] they heard immediately away from them.
[1:22:03] And then those that hear the word and
[1:22:05] they receive it with gladness. They've
[1:22:08] heard it. They they immediately they
[1:22:11] receive it, but there's no root. There's
[1:22:14] no root. They don't have any the that
[1:22:16] the the the seed didn't find its final
[1:22:19] resting place.
[1:22:22] It's almost as if you came to a service
[1:22:24] and the sermon was right on point. The
[1:22:28] scriptures were balanced correctly. It
[1:22:30] was absolutely God all the way, but you
[1:22:33] leave from there without taking away
[1:22:36] anything.
[1:22:38] It was the seed, yes, but it didn't go
[1:22:41] deeper.
[1:22:43] It didn't take root. Many times after
[1:22:47] the preaching of the service, after the
[1:22:49] preaching of the word, that's the time
[1:22:51] to worship afterwards. That's the Holy
[1:22:55] Spirit watering in your mind what just
[1:22:58] took place and what is taking place.
[1:23:00] It's supernatural all the way.
[1:23:04] Amen. It's supernatural all the way.
[1:23:06] Lord, how does this word apply to me
[1:23:09] today?
[1:23:11] Oh God, let it retain in my spirit. Let
[1:23:15] me receive it, Lord.
[1:23:20] And so the we see this
[1:23:24] in this parable of Jesus
[1:23:27] that the seed is placed there. It
[1:23:29] doesn't find its final resting place as
[1:23:33] it should and there it moves on.
[1:23:40] Now finding our position is not finding
[1:23:44] a position but our position.
[1:23:49] And there's a lot of positions that are
[1:23:51] there that are available that need to be
[1:23:54] filled in the kingdom of God.
[1:23:58] But is it my place?
[1:24:00] Is it has it has it been revealed to me
[1:24:04] what that is? Now, the prophet of God
[1:24:06] takes in the adoption message on from um
[1:24:11] Wednesday, adoption number four. And I
[1:24:14] was going through my my message on this
[1:24:18] um preparing for this during the week.
[1:24:20] And then it got right back to these
[1:24:22] mysteries and it exactly what brother
[1:24:24] Brandham had told us about. Get the Holy
[1:24:27] Spirit on you sometime and start running
[1:24:29] that and just watch how it goes. But
[1:24:32] look at what he says. and he's referring
[1:24:34] to the book of Ephesians and and we'll
[1:24:37] take um adoption number four paragraph
[1:24:40] number 16 and he says this here the
[1:24:42] mystery of his will and remember how we
[1:24:45] hung on that how many was here this
[1:24:48] morning let's see how we struck on that
[1:24:51] the mystery of his will now it's not
[1:24:55] just a little thing then it's a mystery
[1:25:00] God's will is a mystery
[1:25:03] And each man has to seek out the will of
[1:25:07] God for his or herself, God's mystery.
[1:25:11] How many of us are doing that today? How
[1:25:14] many know that's a lifetime of doing,
[1:25:16] Lord? What is your will
[1:25:19] for my life? What is your will? Should I
[1:25:22] take this job? Should I move forward in
[1:25:25] in this investment or where should where
[1:25:27] should I do? Should I attach myself to
[1:25:30] these people that want to be in my
[1:25:32] circle or be my friend? Lord, please
[1:25:35] lead me
[1:25:37] because Satan is not going to come and
[1:25:39] tell me that it's Satan.
[1:25:42] I need the Holy Spirit. I need the
[1:25:44] revelation of Jesus Christ to lead me.
[1:25:48] It's a mystery of his will. How many
[1:25:51] knew that you would be sitting in the
[1:25:53] seat you're sitting today when you were
[1:25:56] 18 years old? How many of you knew who
[1:25:58] you'd be married to? What kind of family
[1:26:01] you would have? How many of you knew
[1:26:03] that you would be standing up in the
[1:26:06] pull pit preaching or leading a song
[1:26:09] service or a Bible study? How many of
[1:26:12] you know, you don't know, but we seek
[1:26:16] out his will for our lives?
[1:26:19] I was raised in church my entire life. I
[1:26:22] was raised on a church pew. I saw the
[1:26:25] good, the bad, the indifferent, the
[1:26:28] ugly. I've seen it all. I've heard about
[1:26:30] it. I've seen it. And I've heard the
[1:26:33] Bible stories coming up
[1:26:36] and some stuck to me more than others.
[1:26:39] And then you go out and you live your
[1:26:41] life and you're running out and then now
[1:26:43] you're in you have what you call your
[1:26:45] freedom. Finally, you get your freedom.
[1:26:49] You can make your own choices. I don't
[1:26:51] have to go to church now.
[1:26:55] I can actually stay home on a Sunday all
[1:26:58] day if I want to. As you get grown or
[1:27:02] old enough,
[1:27:05] but then you know life happens to you
[1:27:07] and you start going through things
[1:27:09] through your life. You start trying to
[1:27:11] find out really who are you? Your your
[1:27:15] friends will tell you who you are. Your
[1:27:17] your grades tell you who you are. your
[1:27:21] your your your society and the people
[1:27:23] around you try to tell you and define
[1:27:25] who you are, but you really got to know
[1:27:27] who you are. And until you realize that
[1:27:31] you are a son or daughter of God,
[1:27:35] it's just a big question mark. You're
[1:27:38] just jumping through life's hoops trying
[1:27:41] to find the next high, the next quick
[1:27:44] scheme to happiness, the next, you know,
[1:27:47] the human heart was made to be happy.
[1:27:50] And so the the world is filled with
[1:27:53] trying to find this happiness
[1:27:56] apart from the word of God. The word of
[1:27:59] God places a man or a woman
[1:28:03] to their place and their position.
[1:28:06] It calibrates them of where they should
[1:28:09] be going and what they should be doing.
[1:28:13] Amen.
[1:28:15] So we work out those details, don't we?
[1:28:18] and we're trying to find the will of
[1:28:20] God. We think we might know. We might
[1:28:22] have a dream. Someone might tell us we
[1:28:24] don't think. But we still need to know
[1:28:27] by revelation what is the will of God
[1:28:29] for my life. And the prophet of God says
[1:28:34] in paragraph number 18. And now he said
[1:28:37] he made known to us the mystery. Get the
[1:28:39] Holy Spirit on you sometime and start
[1:28:42] running that and just watch how it goes.
[1:28:45] This afternoon, I had about 30 minutes
[1:28:47] to study just to look at the lesson
[1:28:49] over. Maybe not, I'll say half of that,
[1:28:51] 15 minutes between the times. And I got
[1:28:54] to running and I thought, the mystery,
[1:28:57] how mysterious.
[1:28:59] And the scripture packed me back into
[1:29:01] the Old Testament, then back over into
[1:29:03] the New Testament, tied something
[1:29:05] together, see the mystery of his coming,
[1:29:08] the mystery of his will, the mystery of
[1:29:11] us sitting together. Remember it cannot
[1:29:14] be taught in any seminary.
[1:29:18] It is a mystery.
[1:29:20] You cannot know it by education, by
[1:29:23] theology. It's a mystery
[1:29:26] that's been hidden since the foundation
[1:29:29] of the world waiting for the
[1:29:32] manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:29:37] And so he goes into those mysteries in
[1:29:39] the message surges this the end time.
[1:29:43] And the scripture talks about the
[1:29:45] mystery of God being in Christ, the
[1:29:47] mystery of iniquity, the mystery of the
[1:29:50] seven stars, the mystery of Babylon, the
[1:29:53] prostitute, the mystery all the the
[1:29:56] mysteries of Israel being blinded so the
[1:30:00] Gentiles can come into salvation. the
[1:30:03] mysteries that are surrounded in the
[1:30:05] kingdom of heaven. The mysteries of how
[1:30:09] we'll be translated.
[1:30:11] All these great mysteries the prophet
[1:30:13] brings out and Scoffield brings it out
[1:30:16] in his notes in the Scoffield Bible
[1:30:19] in this message. This is this sign of
[1:30:22] the answer. The prophet brings out all
[1:30:24] these mysteries. I don't I don't know if
[1:30:27] they have it here, but I wrote it down.
[1:30:29] I didn't I read it many many times. I
[1:30:32] took this one just came to me is 2
[1:30:34] Timothy 3:16. Great is the mystery of
[1:30:37] godliness. That's another mystery that
[1:30:41] God was manifested in the flesh, seen of
[1:30:43] the angels, believed on, come to the
[1:30:47] Gentiles, and was received up into
[1:30:49] glory. That's a great mystery. Who is
[1:30:53] God? That's a mystery.
[1:30:56] That's not something you can learn on
[1:30:57] Google.
[1:30:59] That's not an internet knowledge that
[1:31:01] you're going to receive. That's
[1:31:02] something that has to be revealed to you
[1:31:06] apart from your ability to read or your
[1:31:09] IQ or any of those things. God has to
[1:31:13] reveal his will to you.
[1:31:16] And when that will is revealed to you,
[1:31:19] you can start to take your position.
[1:31:23] Now, Satan wants you to take a position
[1:31:25] as well.
[1:31:27] He wants you to He wants you to take a
[1:31:30] position that doesn't belong to you.
[1:31:33] Huh?
[1:31:35] He wants you to lust for knowledge
[1:31:41] like he did with Eve in the garden. He
[1:31:45] tempted her, didn't he?
[1:31:47] If if you do this, you will be like God.
[1:31:51] You'll know. You'll have knowledge.
[1:31:54] And that lust, that little twist of
[1:31:57] knowledge just to know. You know, it's
[1:32:00] something how when I'm preparing for a
[1:32:02] service or putting things together,
[1:32:06] I have so many highlights and amen
[1:32:08] moments and and I'm amening for you all.
[1:32:12] Many times I'm studying. I'm I I'm I'm
[1:32:15] getting in front of the amen. I'm
[1:32:17] saying, "Oh, yeah. They gonna like
[1:32:18] this." And I'll just amen for you. So,
[1:32:22] so, so it's like you're it's like if
[1:32:24] you're doing all the cooking at home and
[1:32:26] you're just nibbling away
[1:32:29] and then when it's time to eat, it's
[1:32:31] like, "Well, bro, why ain't you eating?"
[1:32:33] Well, I've been eating all day.
[1:32:36] And so my question is, if you're
[1:32:39] preparing a meal, should you not taste
[1:32:42] the food, Brother John and just prepare
[1:32:45] while you're fasting or so you just eat
[1:32:48] all along all along and then when you
[1:32:50] sit down at the table just pretend
[1:32:54] like everybody else like, "Wow, that's
[1:32:56] so good, so delicious."
[1:33:00] And so as I'm going through this, like I
[1:33:02] This is where I don't get my sermons
[1:33:04] intact. Brother Joe, Brother Joe and
[1:33:06] Brother Joe
[1:33:08] is that I get on one point and I start
[1:33:11] eating. I'm not preparing a sermon now.
[1:33:15] I'm feeding.
[1:33:18] Oh, and it tastes so good.
[1:33:21] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:33:24] Yes, sir. So, so if you would obey, obey
[1:33:27] the prophet and get in your concordance
[1:33:30] the mystery
[1:33:32] and you start to read that all in one
[1:33:34] channel, all on one plate, all in one
[1:33:37] sitting,
[1:33:38] you will be so grateful
[1:33:42] for what God has revealed in this day.
[1:33:46] Hallelujah.
[1:33:48] Go do it, saints. Do it sometimes.
[1:33:51] We take the mystery and just how it was
[1:33:53] hidden until this time.
[1:33:55] He kept it reserved until this time, but
[1:33:59] now is being made known to his own.
[1:34:02] Who is his own? That's me. That's you.
[1:34:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:09] Amen.
[1:34:11] His great unfolding of his great love
[1:34:14] towards us. The great mystery how he
[1:34:17] unfolds it. So it's not just a position,
[1:34:20] it's our position that Christ has placed
[1:34:23] in us. And we can see the total as our
[1:34:29] life and our ministry is directed. When
[1:34:31] I say ministry, I'm talking about men,
[1:34:33] women, everybody has a ministry, a
[1:34:36] servitude that God has called you to.
[1:34:40] And you find your you're finding your
[1:34:42] correct position. That's what it's all
[1:34:44] about. And Satan is there trying to
[1:34:46] twist you up to to get you involved in
[1:34:50] battles that you shouldn't be involved
[1:34:51] in. That you should be concentrated in
[1:34:54] on what God has for your life.
[1:34:59] I've said this a number of times this
[1:35:01] year. I've said it here a couple of
[1:35:03] times that the best deal you'll ever get
[1:35:06] in this life is going to come from God.
[1:35:10] There is nobody going to offer you a
[1:35:12] better deal.
[1:35:14] There is no sec. Look, if God offers you
[1:35:17] something, just know that is the best.
[1:35:20] There is no secondary deal. There is no
[1:35:24] secondary offer that you can compare
[1:35:26] with his deal. His offer is the best
[1:35:29] offer.
[1:35:32] And if you leave that offer,
[1:35:35] where are you going to?
[1:35:38] Who's going to give you a better deal
[1:35:39] than God? Who's more just than God
[1:35:42] himself?
[1:35:44] Who in giving out gifts and giving out
[1:35:47] talents and blessing and withholding a
[1:35:50] blessing? Who alone can tell God he made
[1:35:54] a mistake
[1:35:56] in giving out whatever he gives.
[1:36:02] See, we get upset because you know this
[1:36:04] one has it. I'm fighting against that
[1:36:05] one. I'm fighting against Well, who's in
[1:36:07] control of all of that?
[1:36:10] Well, I will be doing a lot better, but
[1:36:12] my boss don't like me. Well, who is your
[1:36:14] boss? Wait a minute. Wait, let's back up
[1:36:16] here. Who is the boss anyways?
[1:36:19] Who's the one who brought you here?
[1:36:24] If God ain't in control of your life,
[1:36:26] then please tell me who is. And if he is
[1:36:29] in control, he's not partway in control.
[1:36:33] Everything that happens, he allows it to
[1:36:36] happen
[1:36:38] for his glory, for his purpose, to get
[1:36:41] you where you need to be.
[1:36:45] The best deal is going to come from him.
[1:36:50] Lord, I don't want to be a Sunday school
[1:36:52] teacher. Well, I'm not asking you,
[1:36:58] and I'm not going to force you to be
[1:36:59] one, but I'll make you willing.
[1:37:04] How many know what I'm talking about?
[1:37:08] How many want God's way?
[1:37:11] Lord, Lord, no. Oh, Lord, that's too
[1:37:13] much for me. I can't handle that. Oh,
[1:37:15] really?
[1:37:16] I made you. I built you so you can go
[1:37:20] 75,000 miles. I manufactured you and I
[1:37:24] approved it. I put a warranty on you
[1:37:29] upon this church. I built this church
[1:37:33] upon this rock. I built whose church? My
[1:37:36] church. And the gates of what came from
[1:37:40] there is there is no power that can stop
[1:37:42] this church. It's guaranteed.
[1:37:46] And God who built us and made us who
[1:37:48] placed us and positioned us. Tell me
[1:37:51] he's not going to finish the work with
[1:37:53] us.
[1:37:54] He's going to and he is doing it.
[1:37:57] God bless you so much.
[1:38:00] It's a position
[1:38:03] that God gives to us. It's a placing
[1:38:06] that he has for us. Remember Israel and
[1:38:10] crossing over with Joshua? It wasn't a
[1:38:13] random anybody goes and just build a
[1:38:16] house anywhere. No, your tribe had a
[1:38:19] specific borders that was established
[1:38:22] for that tribe. Your tribe, you're going
[1:38:25] over here, Reuben.
[1:38:28] The tribe of Levi is going to do like
[1:38:30] this here. The tribe of Ephraim is over
[1:38:34] here. Manasseh over here.
[1:38:37] Gad is down below here. Each one had
[1:38:39] their position. Is that right? So it's
[1:38:42] not like we all received the Holy Ghost
[1:38:45] and we all just end up doing the same
[1:38:47] thing. Some free random just run it
[1:38:51] however you want to. Just show up and
[1:38:53] just do whatever you want to anytime you
[1:38:55] want to. No, no, no, no, no. That's not
[1:38:58] placing of a son. The placing of a son
[1:39:00] is specific.
[1:39:02] He is moving you and positioning you.
[1:39:08] You think it has anything to do with the
[1:39:09] preacher. A preacher come on Sunday
[1:39:11] morning. You go to a special meeting.
[1:39:13] He's up there reading the scriptures.
[1:39:15] You don't like how tall he is or he's
[1:39:17] too short for you or he's baldheaded or
[1:39:19] he has a whine in his voice. and you all
[1:39:22] caught up into that, not knowing that
[1:39:24] the Holy Spirit
[1:39:25] is the one trying to place you.
[1:39:28] And if it's the Holy Spirit over your
[1:39:30] life, then you need to take notes of
[1:39:32] that
[1:39:33] because he's the tutor trying to teach
[1:39:35] you.
[1:39:37] Amen, somebody.
[1:39:38] And I trust that one day out of here,
[1:39:41] we'll graduate from something
[1:39:43] that will promote be promoted from some
[1:39:46] level to another level
[1:39:49] by the grace of God.
[1:39:51] not by some satan satanic power
[1:39:56] or strategy the devil would have for us.
[1:39:59] So
[1:40:01] Eve, she brother Random deals with this
[1:40:04] in the harvest time message talking
[1:40:06] about Eve and the three temptations of
[1:40:09] the church, the three temptations of
[1:40:11] Jesus, the three temptations of the
[1:40:14] individual, how Eve was offered these
[1:40:18] supernatural
[1:40:20] things of knowledge, but it it moved her
[1:40:23] out of her position.
[1:40:26] And how many believers, how many
[1:40:28] Christians get moved out of their
[1:40:30] position
[1:40:32] because of their lack of maturity of
[1:40:35] knowing that it's the father. I mean,
[1:40:38] Joseph really could have got mad
[1:40:41] and really could have just thrown in the
[1:40:44] towel at all of it.
[1:40:46] He said, "You know what? I'm just going
[1:40:47] to be a straightup heathen. They lied on
[1:40:50] me. I don't belong down here. I'm poor.
[1:40:53] I don't haven't seen my family. I'll
[1:40:55] just be I'll just become a crook like
[1:40:57] the rest of these prisoners. What if he
[1:41:00] did that? But he had to demand over his
[1:41:03] life that you know what? You need to be
[1:41:05] down in Egypt so that you can save life.
[1:41:09] There's coming a famine.
[1:41:12] Nobody knows it but me, God. There's
[1:41:14] coming a famine and we need you to save
[1:41:17] life. So we we're going to send you down
[1:41:19] to E. Oh yeah, Lord. I'll go down to
[1:41:21] Egypt. Uh what bus you know what what
[1:41:25] airlines am I traveling through?
[1:41:29] Make sure it's first class, Lord. Yes,
[1:41:31] it's first class. All right.
[1:41:35] It's my first class.
[1:41:38] This is a class, boy. You're going to
[1:41:41] learn something. And this is going to be
[1:41:43] a class that will that will expand the
[1:41:46] ages
[1:41:48] that for hundreds of hundreds of years
[1:41:51] all of my sons and daughters that were
[1:41:54] ever in your shoes will have an example
[1:41:57] of how you should conduct yourself with
[1:42:00] the integrity
[1:42:01] of the most high God
[1:42:04] and not lose faith
[1:42:06] when you don't even have a witness
[1:42:10] to say amen with you.
[1:42:13] What an example. What a test. And so we
[1:42:17] see this, don't we? This Eve and this
[1:42:21] temptation and this this is a temptation
[1:42:23] in this last day. The temptation for
[1:42:26] knowledge.
[1:42:28] The the the lust for knowledge.
[1:42:32] You know, there there are many that have
[1:42:35] lost their position and there's many
[1:42:38] that have gained a position by staying
[1:42:40] with the word and staying with the Lord.
[1:42:44] And we see that sometimes when the seed
[1:42:47] is out of place that it doesn't really
[1:42:51] produce the fruit like it should. Now
[1:42:54] the prophet deals with this in the
[1:42:56] message
[1:42:58] um the unveiling of God.
[1:43:03] You know what? I'm going to move from
[1:43:04] that one. I'll take the message planting
[1:43:07] the vine and where to plant it. Prophet
[1:43:09] God says this here.
[1:43:14] This is our psalm that we read this
[1:43:16] morning. Psalms 80 paragraph 45. You
[1:43:19] plucked up a vine out of Egypt. you
[1:43:21] brought it out and planted it in a good
[1:43:23] place. That was Israel, God's people
[1:43:26] that was in Egypt. They were a good
[1:43:29] vine. They were God's chosen. But if a
[1:43:32] good vine isn't set in good ground, it
[1:43:36] will not bring forth good fruits.
[1:43:40] It depends on where the vine is planted
[1:43:44] will determine the results of the crop.
[1:43:47] So God picked up Israel out of a barren
[1:43:51] ground. Something like today we got in
[1:43:53] the land many great and fine believers
[1:43:56] and they are mixed in all denominational
[1:43:59] churches. They come from different
[1:44:00] denominations and different walks of
[1:44:02] life. That's why in my ministry I've
[1:44:05] never tried at any time to run down any
[1:44:07] certain person, any certain denomination
[1:44:11] because in them all is good people. They
[1:44:14] are God's called and chosen people.
[1:44:20] Amen.
[1:44:26] So here the prophet is now talking about
[1:44:28] the the different types of people that
[1:44:31] are in all walks of life and all the
[1:44:33] organiza organizations and
[1:44:35] denominations. They're good people
[1:44:38] and that's why many people are in
[1:44:40] churches today. Good people just planted
[1:44:43] in the wrong place.
[1:44:47] Let me take that verse 40 paragraph 47
[1:44:50] quickly. Let's go back up. Sorry. Could
[1:44:53] you have condemned Israel while it was
[1:44:55] in Egypt? They just got off on the wrong
[1:44:57] foot and their sins had separated them
[1:45:00] from God and they were planted in Egypt.
[1:45:04] And that's the way many people are in
[1:45:06] churches today. good people just planted
[1:45:09] in the wrong place.
[1:45:12] Now, if a real believer is brought to
[1:45:15] Christ and he's planted in some great
[1:45:17] denomination that doesn't believe in
[1:45:19] miracles and signs and wonders of the
[1:45:21] Lord, that person may be a genuine
[1:45:25] Christian and a Catholic, Baptist,
[1:45:27] Presbyterian, Jehovah Witness, something
[1:45:30] else in that church, a genuine vine of
[1:45:33] God. But the denominational creed cuts
[1:45:36] off the life of that vine. It can't bear
[1:45:41] its fruit.
[1:45:43] And usually what fruit you get off that
[1:45:45] vine that's stunted or not in good
[1:45:47] ground is bad fruits. It'll come forth
[1:45:50] like apples and be naughty. Worm eaten
[1:45:53] becomes a subject to all insects. A good
[1:45:56] healthy vine doesn't even have to be
[1:45:58] sprayed. It's healthy enough to throw
[1:46:00] off the enemies. So it is with a bornag
[1:46:05] again Christian.
[1:46:07] Can I get a witness here? So it is with
[1:46:10] a born again Christian. You don't have
[1:46:12] to be spraying them all the time and
[1:46:15] patting them on the back. They are
[1:46:19] spiritually healthy enough to do what?
[1:46:22] To throw off all the scandal of the
[1:46:25] world. They are living off of the true
[1:46:29] nourishment.
[1:46:33] So, we don't have to pat you on the back
[1:46:35] all the time. Now, we don't want to be
[1:46:37] punching you all the time either, but a
[1:46:40] true Christian doesn't have to be patted
[1:46:42] on the back all the time. A true
[1:46:45] believer,
[1:46:46] you can't make them leave.
[1:46:49] If you tried,
[1:46:51] you try to shake them off. They might
[1:46:53] leave and get hurt, but they'll come
[1:46:56] back to the word.
[1:46:57] Oh, yes. You can't stop a true believer.
[1:47:00] Yes, sir.
[1:47:01] No, they'll come back again. Yes. Yes.
[1:47:04] Because God made them that. Yes. And
[1:47:07] this is this planting of the vine,
[1:47:13] planting of a good seed in the wrong
[1:47:15] place. It's out of position. The seed is
[1:47:18] the true seed, but it's not in the right
[1:47:21] position. And Satan is behind it all,
[1:47:25] trying to get and to manipulate you from
[1:47:29] finding your position in Christ Jesus.
[1:47:32] This is a place that God has called for
[1:47:34] us to be
[1:47:36] is in Christ and he's there to get us
[1:47:42] off
[1:47:43] of focus.
[1:47:46] Remember in St. Luke chapter 22,
[1:47:50] if I have time? Yes, we have time. Let's
[1:47:52] go to that real quick. St. Luke 22.
[1:48:12] This is Jesus getting ready to go to
[1:48:13] Calvary
[1:48:15] and he is talking about Judas is about
[1:48:19] to betray me. One of you are going to
[1:48:22] betray me. Never never tells him who it
[1:48:24] is in the beginning. And they begin to
[1:48:27] inquire among themselves. Luke 22:23.
[1:48:31] They begin to inquire among themselves
[1:48:33] which of them it was should do this
[1:48:36] thing. And there was also a strife among
[1:48:39] them, which of them should be accounted
[1:48:43] the greatest.
[1:48:45] Now, these are the disciples that walk
[1:48:47] with Jesus, right? And they wanted to
[1:48:50] know, we don't have this problem here.
[1:48:52] 2025, that's all cured. We're all filled
[1:48:56] with the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:58] We're all very nice people. We don't
[1:49:00] have this problem, do we?
[1:49:04] Don't you lie in church now?
[1:49:07] We don't have this problem. Who's the
[1:49:09] great? Yeah, he's great, but I'm greater
[1:49:12] than him.
[1:49:14] He's clearly a number three.
[1:49:20] I know I'm number two
[1:49:26] now, but I'm really going to be number
[1:49:28] one.
[1:49:31] You see, this this is this is Satan.
[1:49:36] uh moving on our on on our emotions
[1:49:41] and and when and when we don't keep it
[1:49:43] together, when we don't keep it
[1:49:45] together, we make it emotional and then
[1:49:48] we have hurt feelings and then we we're
[1:49:50] all upset and then but think think of
[1:49:54] Joseph.
[1:49:56] Think of Joseph how things fall and fell
[1:50:00] and the way things turned and the way
[1:50:02] things happened. Remember
[1:50:06] today is is the present and there's a
[1:50:11] future coming if the Lord would terry
[1:50:15] and nothing stays the same.
[1:50:19] What God has for you up a road up ahead
[1:50:22] the road could it be his training for up
[1:50:26] the road is what's happening to you
[1:50:28] today.
[1:50:31] I mean let's look at your attitude
[1:50:32] today.
[1:50:35] And let's remove all the people that
[1:50:37] made you the way you are today
[1:50:41] in in in your defense, in your
[1:50:43] explanation. The reason you are so
[1:50:45] upset, the reason why you're you didn't
[1:50:48] get or the reason why you're you're so
[1:50:50] successful is because of this one,
[1:50:52] because of that one, is because of Let's
[1:50:54] remove all of the characters out of your
[1:50:57] life and let's just look at your
[1:51:00] attitude.
[1:51:03] What kind of attitude is working on you
[1:51:05] today,
[1:51:08] your frame of thinking?
[1:51:13] God is in control
[1:51:16] and he's the one who places and plants
[1:51:19] the seed in good ground. That's a the
[1:51:23] original place for a seed is in good
[1:51:27] ground.
[1:51:29] But these outside elements are always
[1:51:31] trying to pull that seed into a
[1:51:35] different kind of a ground.
[1:51:40] The word isn't any different. The word
[1:51:43] this week, next week on the tapes, no
[1:51:46] matter it's no different. But you're
[1:51:48] changing constantly and you should be
[1:51:50] changing constantly for the better.
[1:51:53] You should be moving
[1:51:56] into your position in Christ Jesus.
[1:52:01] You need to find your place. I need to
[1:52:03] find my place. When you see the word of
[1:52:05] God and you see what the church should
[1:52:07] be in this hour,
[1:52:09] then
[1:52:12] many of us are short
[1:52:14] thinking about the church and calling
[1:52:18] and having dominion and power over the
[1:52:22] devil.
[1:52:24] You remember that woman that came? She
[1:52:26] was afflicted with with this devil upon
[1:52:29] her and it was the Sabbath day and Jesus
[1:52:32] went to go heal her and the Pharisees
[1:52:34] got upset and he says, "How is it that
[1:52:37] you could get upset with with with with
[1:52:39] me delivering a daughter of Abraham?" It
[1:52:44] didn't even mention her name, but she's
[1:52:46] a daughter of Abraham that needs to be
[1:52:48] set free.
[1:52:51] And so he set her free.
[1:52:53] And that's what the word of God is here
[1:52:55] to do for you is to set you free.
[1:53:00] Free from your negative ways.
[1:53:04] Free from, you know, being upset all the
[1:53:07] time.
[1:53:08] Free from being the victim.
[1:53:12] Free from blaming other people.
[1:53:14] The word of God comes to establish you
[1:53:17] and to set you free. You remember God is
[1:53:20] no respector of persons.
[1:53:24] He will take you and he will bless you
[1:53:28] and he will move you forward if you
[1:53:31] trust and believe in him. It don't
[1:53:32] matter where you come from. It don't
[1:53:34] matter what your background is. It
[1:53:36] doesn't matter if you're a newcomer. It
[1:53:37] doesn't matter if you just got here. It
[1:53:39] doesn't even matter if you come
[1:53:42] correctly with the right approach and
[1:53:44] right attitude. God will respond to you
[1:53:48] cuz he is no respector of person.
[1:53:53] I thank God for that. That's the best
[1:53:56] deal you're going to get.
[1:53:58] That's the best deal you're going to
[1:54:00] get.
[1:54:03] Why can't I, you know, my family? Why
[1:54:04] can't we live up on the hill? Why can't
[1:54:06] we be wealthy? Why could we never have a
[1:54:08] pro? Why couldn't I have my own bedroom
[1:54:09] growing up? Why did I get a car when I
[1:54:11] was 18? Why did I have to go through?
[1:54:13] Why do I have to stand in unemployment
[1:54:14] line? Why am I broke? Why am I my
[1:54:17] health? Why am I Hey, hey, hey, stop.
[1:54:19] Stop.
[1:54:20] You're a son or daughter of God.
[1:54:24] He's in control of it all.
[1:54:27] And he allows it to move that seed
[1:54:31] into good ground.
[1:54:34] Good ground.
[1:54:36] That's where you're going to flourish is
[1:54:37] in good ground.
[1:54:39] If it's in stony places, you're not
[1:54:40] going to flourish. You're still
[1:54:41] talented. You're still cute. You're
[1:54:44] still anointed. But you're not in the
[1:54:46] right place.
[1:54:47] You're not going to flourish until you
[1:54:48] get in good ground. What is good ground
[1:54:50] is right here.
[1:54:52] The good ground of the word of God.
[1:54:55] Find yourself in good ground. When you
[1:54:59] get in that ground, he will bless you,
[1:55:03] multiply you, anoint you,
[1:55:10] bless his wonderful name.
[1:55:14] Yes.
[1:55:16] I'll close in Luke chapter 22. You
[1:55:18] notice that they're striving amongst
[1:55:20] themselves. Can I close here?
[1:55:23] Chapter 22 verse 24. And there was also
[1:55:26] a strife among them. Which of them
[1:55:28] should be accounted the greatest? And he
[1:55:31] said unto them, the kings of the
[1:55:33] Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
[1:55:36] and they that exercise authority upon
[1:55:38] them are called benefactors.
[1:55:41] But ye shall not be so.
[1:55:46] But he that is greatest among you, let
[1:55:50] him be as the younger, and he that is
[1:55:54] chief as he that doth serve.
[1:56:00] For whether is greater he that siteth
[1:56:03] that meat, or he that serveth? That's a
[1:56:06] loaded question.
[1:56:08] Is not he that sitth that meet but I am
[1:56:12] among you as he that serveth
[1:56:17] then then
[1:56:20] so that was the middle of that chapter
[1:56:22] the beginning of that chapter it says
[1:56:24] then Satan entered into Judas surname is
[1:56:27] being of the number 12 that's Luke 22:3
[1:56:32] we see Satan again now entering into
[1:56:35] Judas causing him to do this And then in
[1:56:38] the middle of the chapter, we're dealing
[1:56:40] with this greatest among you. And then
[1:56:43] look at the end of the chapter. Look at
[1:56:45] Peter. Simon, verse 31. And the Lord
[1:56:49] said, Simon, Simon, behold,
[1:56:53] Satan hath desired to have you, that he
[1:56:58] may sift you as wheat.
[1:57:02] But I have pray for thee that thy faith
[1:57:05] fail not. When thou are converted,
[1:57:10] strengthen
[1:57:12] your brethren.
[1:57:15] What if we could put your name in there?
[1:57:17] What if you could say, "Brother so and
[1:57:18] so, sister so and so, Satan desires
[1:57:24] to have you. If he sized you up today,
[1:57:28] what's his next scheme? What's the next
[1:57:31] attack towards you and your family? What
[1:57:34] do you think the next thought is coming
[1:57:36] from from him? If he sized you up this
[1:57:40] morning, if he wanted to get you, if
[1:57:43] he's he's he's putting his his attack,
[1:57:46] he's getting ready to launch it towards
[1:57:48] you and he
[1:57:52] is trying to get you off your balance,
[1:57:57] get you distracted, get you caught up in
[1:57:59] who's who's the greatest among us. He
[1:58:02] says,
[1:58:04] you know, Peter, Peter there is talking
[1:58:08] with the other disciples about who's the
[1:58:10] greatest. Jesus drops a bomb on him.
[1:58:12] Says, "Satan desires to sift you."
[1:58:16] I mean, he wants you. And Jesus pointed
[1:58:19] it out and told him that. What would
[1:58:21] that be like to you if Jesus told you?
[1:58:24] Satan desires to have you and to sift
[1:58:29] you.
[1:58:30] But I pray for you.
[1:58:33] And after you're converted,
[1:58:36] do what? Don't become a lord over your
[1:58:38] brethren. Don't tell them how you're the
[1:58:40] greatest and all this and that. Don't do
[1:58:42] what to them? Strengthen them.
[1:58:49] God, help us. Lord bless us as the seed
[1:58:54] finds his place, the true believer finds
[1:58:55] his place in the name of the Lord. God
[1:58:58] bless you richly.
[1:59:00] Let us pray.
[1:59:02] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Heavenly
[1:59:05] Father, we thank you
[1:59:07] for your word this morning. We thank you
[1:59:09] for the Holy Ghost that's been shed
[1:59:12] abroad in our hearts. Thank you for the
[1:59:14] saints there in Mesa that's gathered so
[1:59:17] faithfully.
[1:59:18] We pray that each one receive their
[1:59:20] their portion today. Lord, I pray that
[1:59:23] every son or daughter of God
[1:59:27] will take notice of the tutor trying to
[1:59:32] lead them and guide them today. I pray
[1:59:35] Lord Jesus
[1:59:38] that we would not be sleep
[1:59:41] and ignorant of his devices to try to
[1:59:44] move us into
[1:59:47] a a a position of pride and and and and
[1:59:50] desiring authority,
[1:59:53] desiring to take over, desiring to be
[1:59:57] better than,
[2:00:00] but Lord
[2:00:02] to find ourselves humbly ly in good
[2:00:06] ground and good soil and good solid
[2:00:10] Bible teaching.
[2:00:13] Good solid anointed Holy Ghost
[2:00:17] outpouring
[2:00:19] [Music]
[2:00:20] upon our lives.
[2:00:23] Oh God, that's my prayer today. That's
[2:00:26] my desire today, Lord, as we move
[2:00:29] forward with the last few years that we
[2:00:31] have to proclaim
[2:00:35] as we just have a few more days left in
[2:00:39] the freedom to proclaim it and declare
[2:00:42] it, Lord. As we prepare and make ready
[2:00:46] for the coming of the Lord,
[2:00:49] as we make ready for the great advent
[2:00:54] that all the ages were looking to
[2:00:57] where the last people, Lord, we're the
[2:01:01] 11th hour worker.
[2:01:04] We're standing, Lord, in the greatest
[2:01:07] mystery being revealed in all of the
[2:01:11] ages.
[2:01:12] the mystery of our lives.
[2:01:16] Open it up to us. Open it up to each
[2:01:18] one. Lord, bless the newcomers, the
[2:01:21] strangers, the visitors, the old-timers,
[2:01:25] old mom and dad. Bless them, elders.
[2:01:31] each one, Lord, our young people, Lord,
[2:01:34] a refreshing and outpouring of the Holy
[2:01:37] Ghost,
[2:01:39] a rededication in the lives of our
[2:01:43] believers, our those that proclaim your
[2:01:46] name.
[2:01:48] Father, we commit each one into your
[2:01:50] hands. Break the power of Satan from off
[2:01:53] of our lives.
[2:01:55] Send a great Holy Spirit anointing
[2:01:59] to destroy the yoke of the enemy,
[2:02:01] bondage and chains of darkness.
[2:02:04] Set us free by your word, Lord Jesus.
[2:02:08] Lord, we come in under your control,
[2:02:10] under your dominion, under your domain.
[2:02:14] You're the great teacher. You're the
[2:02:15] tutorer. You're the great planter.
[2:02:18] You're the great farmer.
[2:02:21] Plant us, Lord, in good soil.
[2:02:24] Water us by the Holy Spirit. Lord, let
[2:02:27] us come forth and bring forth
[2:02:30] seeds, fruits of the seeds of
[2:02:33] righteousness is our prayer. Grant it,
[2:02:36] oh God. We love you and we thank you in
[2:02:39] Jesus name we pray.
[2:02:42] Amen. Change my heart, oh God.
[2:02:51] Make it ever
[2:02:54] true.
[2:02:56] That's your prayer this morning. Change

[2:08:40] there's uh there's those that are blind
[2:08:43] spiritually and there's those that are
[2:08:45] blind naturally, but you are the same
[2:08:48] one who open the ones that are blind
[2:08:51] naturally and the ones that are blind
[2:08:54] spiritually. I pray take away all blind
[2:08:57] blindness among us. So Lord Jesus, oh
[2:09:01] help us to see. Lord Jesus Christ, take
[2:09:03] away the sins among us, all that so

[2:09:50] those who fear his name. May the fear of
[2:09:52] God be established in our hearts because

[2:09:57] beginning of wisdom. Bless dear God the
[2:10:00] visitors in our gates. Oh God, bless
