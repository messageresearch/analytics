[23:22] [Music]
[23:33] [Music]
[23:35] and sweeping up to glory to see his face
[23:48] [Music]
[23:55] [Music]
[24:01] blessed be the name of the Lord
[24:04] [Music]
[24:05] amen our God is good
[24:08] amen thank you sisters and my precious
[24:12] brother
[24:13] thank you I greet every one of you in
[24:17] the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[24:19] Christ
[24:21] our God is good
[24:23] I said our God is good
[24:27] if God is good to you then you have to
[24:30] praise him
[24:31] your mouth don't have to be zipped you
[24:34] have to praise the Lord you know how
[24:36] many people didn't wake up this morning
[24:40] even in balancing here do you know how
[24:43] many people could not even lift off
[24:45] their hands they couldn't even open
[24:48] their mouth they have maybe millions of
[24:50] dollars but the amount can open and if
[24:54] God has opened your mouth if God has
[24:57] brought you here and he says praise the
[25:01] Lord then you want to put a zip on your
[25:03] mouth what's the matter with you praise
[25:06] Jesus I am a man that I when I come here
[25:09] let me tell you you have to Praise Jesus
[25:12] because let me tell you if you don't
[25:15] know him
[25:16] look what he have done for you
[25:20] he has done so much in your life my life
[25:24] if it was not for Jesus where would I be
[25:27] if it is not for him where would you be
[25:30] somewhere else could have been drug
[25:32] added as a sister some prostitutes some
[25:37] whatever thiefs some will be killed and
[25:41] all kinds of things could have
[25:45] because
[25:46] the grace of God
[25:48] has watch over race
[25:50] so when you come here you will pray that
[25:54] gift don't look at me
[25:57] Look Away to Jesus when you look away to
[26:01] Jesus you pull the gift God will do as
[26:04] Pride to you for you to know that he's
[26:07] alive
[26:09] some of us sometimes we don't get
[26:11] blessings because God when we come to
[26:14] his presence the culture has bound us
[26:17] and we don't want to praise him but God
[26:20] wants us to get loose this is the hour
[26:23] God need your praise this is the hour
[26:26] God need your worship this is the hour
[26:29] you have to shout and praise him because
[26:32] he's he is his spirit is moving he's
[26:35] moving if you have spiritual eye to know
[26:39] him you can see that his spirit is
[26:43] moving moving in Good Neighbor moving
[26:46] around the world
[26:47] so you want to do things in your life
[26:50] all the cultural things that the world
[26:54] has put families the system has put on
[26:57] us God wants to Shake it up Shake It Out
[27:01] up rip all of it so that when we come
[27:04] here we could lift up our hearts and
[27:07] praise him
[27:09] Praise Jesus
[27:12] because he is good
[27:14] the Lord is good
[27:16] the Lord is good
[27:19] blessed be the name of the Lord that's
[27:21] the appetite
[27:23] please be a
[27:26] okay I'm sorry let us get into the word
[27:29] straight uh I forgot to give you the
[27:32] title
[27:34] but I'm gonna speak on many a call
[27:38] but few
[27:40] are chosen
[27:43] so you can use that as a background of
[27:46] what I'm going to speak
[27:48] and we will tend to
[27:52] Matthew 22
[27:57] Matthew 22 14.
[28:01] and we'll read Romans
[28:04] chapter 9
[28:07] Romans 9 verse
[28:12] 9 to 18.
[28:17] that will be the scripture but my
[28:19] background will be many are called few
[28:21] are chosen
[28:26] uh
[28:29] brother can you come here and pray
[28:32] pray leaders in prayer
[28:35] before we open the way whatever just
[28:37] stand there and pray
[28:48] amen
[28:51] yes Lord
[29:01] hear me
[29:05] amen
[29:07] amen God is good okay Matthew chapter 22
[29:12] 14 many are called
[29:15] but few are chosen
[29:19] then we turn to Romans 9
[29:23] verse 9
[29:27] okay for this is the way of promise at
[29:33] this time will I come and Sarah shall
[29:37] have a son
[29:40] and not only this but when Rebecca also
[29:45] had
[29:46] conceived by one
[29:49] you see the Lord when Jacob and Esau
[29:53] were in the womb they were twins right
[29:55] but the Lord only looked
[29:58] by what one because he seed
[30:02] even by sorry
[30:06] okay by one even
[30:09] by Our Father Isaac
[30:12] for the children being not yet born
[30:15] neither have done any good or evil that
[30:20] the purpose of God according to election
[30:24] Must Die not of works but of him that
[30:30] calling
[30:31] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[30:36] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[30:41] have I love but Esau have I hated
[30:46] what shall we say then is there
[30:50] unrighteousness with God God forbid
[30:54] for he said unto Moses I will have mercy
[30:59] on whom I will have mercy and I will
[31:04] have compassion on whom I will have
[31:07] compassion
[31:09] so then it is not of him that Willy nor
[31:15] of him that run it but
[31:19] of God that show Mercy
[31:23] for that
[31:25] for the scripture said unto pharaoh
[31:29] even for this same purpose have I raised
[31:35] thee up that I my show my power indeed
[31:41] and that my name might be declared
[31:46] throughout all the Earth therefore
[31:51] had he Mercy on whom he will have mercy
[31:55] and he whom he will he hide in it
[32:00] may the Lord add his Blessing
[32:04] please everyone be seated
[32:12] thanks be to the Lord
[32:14] our God is good
[32:17] because God
[32:20] knows his children
[32:23] that he has chose
[32:27] even when we came to this world we came
[32:31] with the seed of godliness
[32:33] because anything that the Lord does
[32:38] is not just now that we are here that is
[32:41] going to do it he has it's a finished
[32:44] work
[32:46] that salvation is what a Finnish work
[32:52] if you have it you have it before you
[32:55] came to this world
[32:58] God knew that while we are here
[33:02] the enemy will be here
[33:06] because he was cast down to the Earth
[33:08] this
[33:10] so he will be here
[33:12] and
[33:13] because
[33:15] we are born into as I was saying
[33:18] cultural
[33:20] the family
[33:22] they teach us how to behave how to do
[33:26] things according to the world that we
[33:29] are in
[33:30] but God knows all that
[33:35] and most of the things they teach us is
[33:37] contrary to his word
[33:41] is contrary to God's word
[33:45] so God don't wait for us to be here
[33:48] before he says I choose Danny I choose
[33:51] uh brother Brian
[33:53] and I live Philip no
[33:57] God has already chooses
[34:01] he has already chosen us predestinated
[34:05] as
[34:06] and he knows
[34:08] when we were up there
[34:11] Lucifer took one third of the Angels
[34:14] down to the air
[34:16] and we that stood for him he has already
[34:19] chosen us and sent us here and he know
[34:23] who will come to him and who wouldn't
[34:26] come to him
[34:27] he don't wait
[34:30] for us to be here before he make that
[34:33] decision the decision has already been
[34:36] made
[34:37] that's why salvation we can never give
[34:40] it to anybody I'm not here to bring a
[34:43] new message
[34:44] I'm just repeating what God has used our
[34:49] beloved Pastor to preach to us
[34:53] God is repeating to us
[34:56] so that it will sink down into our heart
[35:00] because the Bible says every seed must
[35:03] bring forth his kind
[35:05] so it's a repeating like when you have a
[35:08] children
[35:10] the child when you tell them oh don't go
[35:12] here they always go here
[35:16] they'll always go the place you said
[35:18] they shouldn't go but you have to keep
[35:20] on repeating repeating repeating even
[35:24] when you get old and die one day the
[35:28] things you have said to them they will
[35:30] remember
[35:31] it will come back to them so you see God
[35:36] the scripture said we shouldn't forsake
[35:38] the assemblies in the presence of God we
[35:40] shouldn't forsake but how many people
[35:42] are forsaking
[35:44] right how many people forsake the house
[35:47] of God
[35:49] so God sometimes go back repeating to us
[35:53] repeating to us repeating to us because
[35:56] you know what the culture has hooked us
[36:00] and the world has spook us that we are
[36:04] so attached to the world
[36:08] but God wants us to be attached to him
[36:12] God wants us to be attached to him more
[36:15] than the world because the world can
[36:17] never give you anything anything that
[36:20] have beginning have an ending
[36:23] so let me tell you if you are living
[36:27] with anything that I have beginning one
[36:30] of these days you're gonna have an end
[36:33] when you were coming here the only thing
[36:35] you brought was the seed if you are one
[36:38] of his bride the seed of God that you
[36:41] brought here
[36:43] apart from that
[36:45] that's the thing you are going with
[36:49] everything your I see have beginning
[36:52] have an end
[36:54] so trust in God because he has already
[36:58] prophesied it he says many are called
[37:02] but few are chosen
[37:05] if you are chosen and even you don't
[37:08] have one cent in your pocket you have to
[37:10] rejoice
[37:12] you have to praise him you have to thank
[37:14] him you have to worship him you have to
[37:17] honor him because look at the world
[37:20] right now we are about eight billion
[37:24] eight billions of humanity Naturally
[37:27] Speaking
[37:30] and you God looked down that eight
[37:33] billion and choose you he saw that 8
[37:37] billion before we were in Ed reaching 8
[37:41] billion
[37:42] he have already seen it God is not man
[37:46] that or he waits until the 8 billion he
[37:49] knows all people that will come to the
[37:51] Earth
[37:53] he knows at the end everything
[37:56] and yet God has chose you
[38:01] God has chose you
[38:04] it's not by words
[38:07] he saw he was before even Jacob was in
[38:11] his mother womb God said I love Jacob I
[38:15] hate Esau
[38:17] even he told pharaoh anything Pharaoh
[38:21] was going to do he thought he was smart
[38:23] you're gonna chase the Israelites with
[38:26] them slave them do all kinds of things
[38:29] but God said for this purpose
[38:33] that I might I have raised you up
[38:37] Pharaoh even what Pharaoh was fulfilling
[38:40] was fulfilling God's purpose
[38:43] so you you came here for a purpose
[38:47] what purpose are you gonna fulfill
[38:50] because the scriptures said many are
[38:53] called
[38:55] few are chosen
[38:57] are you one of the chosen one
[39:00] this is the hour
[39:02] when Christ is displaying himself
[39:05] in the 5-4 ministry around the world
[39:09] on Gentile Nations because the time has
[39:13] come whether we like it or not even
[39:16] natural economy and the way the world is
[39:19] is telling you that everything is
[39:23] winding up
[39:24] to fulfill
[39:27] we've seen it it's playing before our
[39:30] own eye is playing before you don't need
[39:34] a computer or anything to know just
[39:37] watch your news let's turn the news is
[39:41] playing before you the scriptures are
[39:43] fulfilling right what side are you
[39:47] playing
[39:48] what side are you gonna stand are you
[39:52] gonna stand with Jesus or are you gonna
[39:55] attach to the world because the things
[39:58] of Sodom is the things of the world
[40:01] which people will act are attaching
[40:05] themselves at this hour into I am not
[40:08] saying we shouldn't work we should not
[40:11] uh
[40:12] I mean drive car or buy house or eat or
[40:17] wear clothes yes you need all those
[40:20] things
[40:21] but anything that will take you away
[40:24] from Jesus Christ is of the devil and
[40:29] you have to let it go
[40:32] straightforward you have to let that
[40:35] thing go so that Christ may have
[40:38] preeminence over your body over your
[40:42] soul over your mind over your heart so
[40:45] that he will project himself in you
[40:48] because this our Christ is serious he
[40:53] wanted to possess his own that bride he
[40:56] wanted to possess us so that the world
[40:59] may know that this Bible is not just
[41:02] written pen and ink only or just what
[41:07] brother Brahm spoke gonna be in the
[41:10] books and we're gonna cut it back and
[41:12] forth and slap us with our face or with
[41:15] our uh all that we know and we call it
[41:19] the word of God no God wants you to
[41:23] fulfill that word
[41:24] God wants that word to be alive
[41:28] when Pastor Simon got two books two
[41:31] books he had two books he's sitting here
[41:35] two books that two books if he couldn't
[41:39] have
[41:40] eaten it became his his heart bitteness
[41:45] but he hold up and says no matter what
[41:49] is the truth I'm gonna let this word of
[41:53] God project
[41:55] possess me that's our God is calling us
[41:59] I want her to possess you
[42:01] I wanted to demonstrate my my wedding
[42:05] you
[42:06] it's not just gonna be in a book form no
[42:11] sir no sir
[42:13] Simon since he's here
[42:16] we that I repeat has been here long no
[42:21] the power of God we have seen it we are
[42:25] eyewitness
[42:26] that God was using him mightily we
[42:31] that's why we are here otherwise none of
[42:33] us will be sitting here all of us we
[42:36] used to go to some of us churches or
[42:39] parties or or
[42:42] oh my all kinds of places but the grace
[42:47] of God has come to you
[42:51] he has paid the price
[42:55] the Baton is now on your hands
[42:59] the Baton is now on your head because
[43:03] Eagles
[43:04] let me tell you
[43:06] when your your father feed you feel you
[43:11] feel you and you'll be coming so puffy
[43:14] like that a time will come that your
[43:16] father will say no son no it's your time
[43:19] to eat go and look for your own food
[43:23] otherwise you are born bastard
[43:27] bastard son no sir
[43:30] Eagles you eat what you eat
[43:35] a Time come you're projected
[43:38] you let it come alive
[43:40] you let the people see
[43:43] that yes
[43:44] this is what you have been eating all
[43:47] the time
[43:48] for 30 years
[43:50] I've been under Pastor Simon 31 years or
[43:52] so going almost 32 if let's say
[43:56] naturally if I was going to school from
[43:59] grade one to get PhD
[44:02] let me tell you
[44:04] didn't I appeared
[44:07] PhD already
[44:10] so how long are you gonna train me to
[44:12] know the word of God
[44:14] how long
[44:16] does some of us God have to beg us
[44:19] drag us before we come to his presence
[44:24] how long we still going to be babies
[44:27] 30 years people want to be babies
[44:30] they won't make they don't want to eat
[44:33] the meat because when you either make
[44:36] you become bitterness in your heart but
[44:39] in your lips it becomes thicker
[44:42] yes sir
[44:44] the word of God is real
[44:47] it's not he just wanted to be a book he
[44:50] wanted to be you
[44:52] you
[44:54] the word one take you to become the word
[44:58] in flesh so that the people when they
[45:01] see you they are seeing
[45:03] your father who is your father the Lord
[45:07] and Savior Jesus Christ
[45:09] because when he was here he has told us
[45:12] in the word he said I am he that was
[45:16] dead end of my life forever more how
[45:19] would the people know Jesus is Alive
[45:22] by your testimony
[45:24] by Your Word
[45:26] by your manifestation on the word of God
[45:30] the people who know that Christ is alive
[45:34] Christ is resurrected because to the
[45:38] world Jesus Is Dead even to the
[45:41] denomination they just talk about Jesus
[45:44] Jesus they don't they never seen the
[45:48] power of God
[45:50] so many people in the message
[45:53] they know the cause but they never seen
[45:56] the power of God one time in their life
[46:00] Christ
[46:01] said no if I'm in you if the Same Spirit
[46:07] that raise up Jesus Christ from the dead
[46:11] dwell in you
[46:13] he shall also Quicken your mortal body
[46:17] he will do the same thing
[46:20] let me tell you
[46:22] our Christ is not a dead God One Pastor
[46:25] someone demonstrate the word of God he
[46:28] don't demonstrate the word of look at
[46:30] his age when he's Tanya preaching don't
[46:34] you see the power of God he looked like
[46:37] 16 years God boy with a word of God I
[46:42] tell you if you put me in the grip and
[46:45] put oxygen for me
[46:47] and he is preaching I will and I hear
[46:50] his voice I will know that that voice
[46:54] comes from heaven
[46:56] it doesn't come from man
[46:58] let me tell you God has used him
[47:01] mightily but I'm afraid so many of us we
[47:05] are playing with jokes
[47:07] yes sir I'll tell us it is uh listen
[47:11] when it comes to the word of God
[47:14] listen me
[47:16] I'm not scared of no man
[47:19] because Jesus
[47:22] let me tell you the places he has taken
[47:24] me only him alone know
[47:27] only him
[47:29] sometime even government
[47:31] I remember Gaddafi signature have to
[47:34] come and move to get me out from jail
[47:38] in Libya I I don't know how I like I
[47:42] will come out but God the Mighty God the
[47:47] God that I know now
[47:50] it was him that brought me out
[47:53] one time I was deep deep sleep I have no
[47:57] money God
[47:59] wake me up midnight I was sleeping at 12
[48:03] flip and Desmond
[48:05] that house Stone was all around very
[48:09] dark in African area
[48:12] and the spirit of God I didn't know wake
[48:15] me up walk I'm walking hello
[48:19] I don't know nobody in that place I walk
[48:24] that voice led me straight to a man
[48:27] who was a soldier that I used to punish
[48:31] his shoe
[48:32] and he gave me money to go back to
[48:35] Nigeria a lot of money
[48:38] and during that time within three months
[48:42] I was in Germany let me tell you
[48:46] I'm not scared of nothing me God no I'm
[48:50] telling you
[48:53] this
[48:54] I'm not scared of nothing only him
[48:58] only him it will lead me
[49:01] only Jesus Will Lead Me
[49:04] no man
[49:06] will lead me I respect I respect my
[49:08] pastor respected because I respect every
[49:11] single one of you but let us shake off
[49:14] the dust
[49:16] and worship Christ
[49:18] the Mighty God
[49:20] let us come face to face in reality
[49:24] because if Pastor someone didn't come
[49:26] face to face
[49:28] let me tell you what I came to the
[49:31] church I count the numbers 17.
[49:36] the congregation was 17 I counted it
[49:40] that time
[49:41] I've been here long
[49:44] and I know I've seen what God has done
[49:47] I see what God I may not able to quote
[49:52] the prophet message this that that
[49:56] backwards forward like as my brothers
[49:58] called blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:01] as they call it I love it I love you
[50:05] Brothers but let me tell you a greater
[50:09] than Solomon he's the only one we have
[50:12] to praise
[50:13] he's the only one we have to worship
[50:16] he's the only one we have to lift him up
[50:19] Pastor Simon has demonstrated the gospel
[50:23] to my soul and it has become so real to
[50:28] me that even if he's not here today
[50:30] brother I give God all the praise for
[50:33] what you are free to me let me tell you
[50:36] I am so setting what is in me will lead
[50:41] me back to Jesus Christ
[50:44] I am so certain if he's not here
[50:46] wherever you put me whether perfect
[50:49] weather streak where the corner is able
[50:54] to do the job
[50:55] the word of God that he has placed in my
[50:59] heart
[50:59] it will do the job I have confidence my
[51:04] confidence is not in a man our
[51:07] confidence shouldn't be in a man we have
[51:09] to respect we have to honor where God is
[51:12] hiding where God is moving
[51:15] and be serious
[51:18] and get the word out
[51:21] so that God will have preeminence in our
[51:26] life
[51:27] that even when we we go our children if
[51:32] the Lord is telling not coming then we
[51:35] said my father
[51:37] my mother was a true Christian you think
[51:41] Pastor someone children who know they
[51:44] know
[51:45] Grace Mike Michelle they know that your
[51:50] father wasn't drunk with the gospel look
[51:55] at brother babe
[51:56] who witnessed to him Pastor someone sang
[51:59] Mike saw him
[52:02] says come to my father
[52:05] why even though he doesn't see him here
[52:10] he have
[52:11] he know what was in his father
[52:15] let me tell you but someone is our
[52:18] father
[52:20] and let me say this not because he's
[52:22] sitting here every time I'm going to
[52:25] Africa he's sitting here question I said
[52:27] brother I'm going
[52:29] sometimes he tell me and I tell him
[52:31] where I'm going he says you go and take
[52:35] the word and slap the people the
[52:38] intellectual doors that God wanted to
[52:41] speak to and exactly you tell me happy
[52:45] I know this message is real
[52:48] this message is real it's not joke it's
[52:52] reality
[52:54] but people we want to pray jokes jokes
[52:58] won't do it because we think we can cut
[53:01] that message we know the prophet Message
[53:05] In and Out by letter form quoting is
[53:08] that no say his time will get serious we
[53:13] got serious on the word
[53:15] when we get serious
[53:17] let me tell you God will move
[53:20] Hillary will take place
[53:23] in the Bible check
[53:25] the Lord
[53:27] says his children they'll be going to
[53:31] streets and begging bread
[53:33] get on back God's children does not dead
[53:37] God may bring you out poor
[53:40] but let me tell you if you surrender it
[53:44] may take yes it may take a month but the
[53:49] time God has set for you you make a way
[53:53] you make a way let me tell you
[53:57] he will make a way
[54:00] if you are not seeing him making a way
[54:03] that means you are short of something or
[54:06] he is trying you let me tell you
[54:10] sometimes stubbornness whole less
[54:12] backwards but God is saying my sin will
[54:17] never return unto me void my seed will
[54:21] accomplish what I send for when brother
[54:24] Brown was here the word saw the power of
[54:29] God
[54:30] this day
[54:32] the churches must say churches a lot of
[54:36] them are not seeing the power of God no
[54:39] more
[54:39] because they have pushed the word out
[54:42] they put the Holy Spirit out even in the
[54:46] message
[54:46] they've put a great Holy Spirit out
[54:49] Christ himself is out all they have is
[54:53] called
[54:55] back and forth God by where is the word
[54:59] that have to open to the people the word
[55:02] that was set the people free the word
[55:05] that will let the people know that Jesus
[55:09] is alive he's real he's not dead He's
[55:13] Alive
[55:14] let me call you when the world is in you
[55:18] you don't fear nothing
[55:20] the church even can put you out because
[55:23] they did to Jesus they don't want Jesus
[55:26] they don't want Jesus the storm that the
[55:30] building
[55:31] refusing became the head of the corner
[55:35] right that was Christ
[55:38] that was Christ and it's the same thing
[55:41] going through the messages
[55:44] in the prophet is here you think
[55:47] they were accepting so many churches who
[55:51] are accepting because of
[55:53] what they want to be big trust listen me
[55:57] I don't care
[56:00] even if my pastor tell me coffee step
[56:02] down Don't Preach I will obey
[56:06] I don't care I'm not here for popularity
[56:08] me popularity is helped out of my life
[56:12] because the Bible tells me playing Jesus
[56:16] there was no Beauty
[56:19] he was the most ugly person that have
[56:22] ever been on Earth
[56:23] but inside him was the beauty in the
[56:26] world have never seen when he speak
[56:30] and that's the way our life supposed to
[56:32] be
[56:33] that's the way we have to be so that God
[56:37] can get the glory he came like that by
[56:42] disguising himself so that he could come
[56:45] to you he could let you know look at
[56:49] what he have done for us
[56:51] the same voice
[56:53] was speaking to Moses
[56:55] the same voice was in William Abraham
[56:59] the same voice is speaking to you even
[57:02] in the message how many you think
[57:06] are receiving what we are receiving here
[57:09] they know the cause I've met so many
[57:12] people
[57:13] even preachers Philip know one friend
[57:18] one time
[57:19] I was telling
[57:21] him I said when you eat this message it
[57:25] becomes bitter in your belly but it's
[57:28] sweeter in your mouth the brother says
[57:32] if you hear the bitters
[57:34] then you can be a child of God you'll be
[57:37] a bastard son I said you are right
[57:40] then why continue fellowshipping access
[57:43] to him
[57:46] for me I love my pastor I'd love to be
[57:49] under my pastor Ministry oh brother I
[57:52] don't want nobody to control me
[57:55] you see
[57:57] you see the spirit
[57:59] how he has projected himself he don't
[58:02] want to be subject lot of people think
[58:06] they stay home
[58:07] they listen to the tape they don't want
[58:10] leadership
[58:12] even you but they will go to work
[58:15] and the work they have for my
[58:20] they are managers
[58:22] they have sometimes they have CEO
[58:27] if they are educated all kinds of levels
[58:30] and they control their life
[58:33] they tell them
[58:35] today you can't go home because we are
[58:37] busy I'm not saying we shouldn't work
[58:39] take it spiritually
[58:42] okay
[58:43] and they will stay and work
[58:47] but when they come to the house of God
[58:49] when the pillow fire is moving
[58:52] God is making his way to know
[58:56] and they do something audio like God
[58:59] want to ship it
[59:00] they don't want it
[59:02] they don't want it but because of the
[59:05] ability I call them ballet Christian
[59:08] like it's all like uh Judas because of
[59:13] his belly what you eat and just two
[59:16] minutes go to the washroom and all gone
[59:18] he loved that
[59:21] he loved that more than the word of God
[59:25] the word of God should be our priority
[59:28] the word of God should be our absolute
[59:31] the word of God should be the one we
[59:34] love more than anything
[59:36] if not so then get out and go and do
[59:41] what you want to do
[59:42] but if God be God serving
[59:46] if the Lord be Lord you that are
[59:48] watching me on the uh on on the program
[59:52] let me tell you if you are staying home
[59:55] not because you are you came late from
[59:58] work or you are sick or maybe you are
[1:00:02] too old you and you can't be here I'll
[1:00:06] say to you shame unto you come to the
[1:00:09] house of God
[1:00:10] don't sleep
[1:00:12] come to the presence of God
[1:00:15] why are you gonna be fat
[1:00:17] by staying home
[1:00:20] let me tell you God
[1:00:23] wants you to be in his presence
[1:00:26] when he created Adam and took one of
[1:00:29] Adam's ribs and made Eve
[1:00:33] he used to come and talk to them the
[1:00:37] cooling of the day God himself used to
[1:00:39] preach to them but when sin became in
[1:00:42] their heart
[1:00:44] they took leave to cover themselves
[1:00:46] they don't want to be in the presence of
[1:00:48] God no more that is what is happening
[1:00:52] and Lord don't want to be in the
[1:00:53] presence of God no more because what
[1:00:56] they have least covering themselves
[1:00:59] but God is saying Shake It Off
[1:01:02] as a child of God check it out this is
[1:01:06] not legalistic preaching
[1:01:08] let me tell you I'm not a legalistic
[1:01:10] preacher but I tell you what God placed
[1:01:13] in my heart I will speak
[1:01:14] I'll speak
[1:01:16] I don't care all I care that Jesus
[1:01:20] gathered Glory
[1:01:22] only Jesus
[1:01:24] because I don't know when my time
[1:01:28] on Earth I'm gonna be finished
[1:01:30] and the seed in me is the only thing I
[1:01:35] came to this welfare and when I'm coming
[1:01:38] I the Lord brought me along
[1:01:41] he didn't brought me with so many people
[1:01:43] he brought me along on Earth I come
[1:01:46] alone I'll go back hello and as as
[1:01:49] matter of fact what did Jesus say told
[1:01:52] me in the bed I'll take one and leave
[1:01:54] one right he says junk as we are
[1:01:57] individuals
[1:01:58] we are not bodies or Nation like he's
[1:02:01] right where you call tribe together like
[1:02:05] that we are individuals so I have only
[1:02:09] my taking
[1:02:11] a long going the word in me is my
[1:02:14] talking I'm going with that Holy
[1:02:17] everything I'm living it here and this
[1:02:21] is the hour God is saying
[1:02:24] pull yourself into his presence because
[1:02:28] the time has come can't you see he's
[1:02:31] moving
[1:02:33] in the Firefall Ministry
[1:02:35] through the word
[1:02:37] he's coming moving
[1:02:40] that's one preached Christ Donnie
[1:02:43] preached Christ Temple preached Christ
[1:02:45] flip preach Christ Christopher preach
[1:02:48] Christ in different form of himself
[1:02:51] going out past the salmon and talk about
[1:02:54] it because it's through him
[1:02:57] the cake was given to him at the age of
[1:03:01] 12 years he started seeing the cake and
[1:03:05] that cake he has divided it
[1:03:07] for us and I have my passion
[1:03:12] that portion is coming out
[1:03:14] Danny's of his portion I may be the
[1:03:18] least in the king of all the brothers
[1:03:20] that preach you see my preaching is
[1:03:23] different my preaching is not like Danny
[1:03:26] like Philip like Christopher like
[1:03:30] Desmond all like even Glory but let me
[1:03:33] tell you if you check inside you'll get
[1:03:36] nuggets
[1:03:38] there's nuggets inside for you to eat
[1:03:41] if you eat that nuggets you'll never be
[1:03:45] get angry you'll never be hungry because
[1:03:49] the power of God is inside
[1:03:52] because it's portion of the fivefold
[1:03:55] ministry
[1:03:56] I've gone to places and I said it
[1:03:59] even here in Toronto
[1:04:02] one time I was at work
[1:04:05] and my boss came
[1:04:07] doing something which was not right and
[1:04:11] God let me spoke something just came out
[1:04:14] from my lips
[1:04:16] and he was his pulse
[1:04:19] I didn't mean to do that it just came
[1:04:22] out even I wanted to say something and
[1:04:24] all of a sudden the word just come come
[1:04:27] out and he himself what was hidden in
[1:04:30] him was exposed one of the guy that was
[1:04:35] working there that time he was a
[1:04:37] Pentecostal like brother Danny
[1:04:40] let's say brother and that Pastor Simon
[1:04:42] call Pastor still here
[1:04:45] and he says coffee when one day I become
[1:04:48] I have my own church I'm gonna call you
[1:04:51] to preach I says get away from me
[1:04:55] do you know
[1:04:57] that thing came to pass
[1:05:00] God let that thing came to pass
[1:05:03] he was so
[1:05:06] entrusted for what he saw God did that
[1:05:10] let me tell you when he became a
[1:05:13] preacher in a church he even wanted to
[1:05:15] ask me he says if the congregation
[1:05:17] wouldn't mind you I have a friend on
[1:05:20] television
[1:05:21] who preach I'm gonna take you there
[1:05:24] because what he saw the power of God
[1:05:27] made manifest
[1:05:30] let me tell you
[1:05:33] the word that Pastor Samuel has been
[1:05:36] preaching to us
[1:05:37] I am eyewitness
[1:05:39] he does the job
[1:05:42] I said he does the job for me
[1:05:47] he does the job
[1:05:50] I'm not scared
[1:05:51] not because I'm praising him all this if
[1:05:54] you think I'm praising him that's all
[1:05:56] right I'm praising Jesus because God hid
[1:06:00] in that skin
[1:06:03] God hid in that skin
[1:06:06] well listen do you know it's hard even
[1:06:10] in the message to find solid preacher
[1:06:14] people are thinking it's Pentecostal no
[1:06:17] moving through the message
[1:06:19] the message has become message
[1:06:22] out of the message the life is coming up
[1:06:26] so you need that life that is coming out
[1:06:28] from the message and that is what God
[1:06:31] has given to us and people are playing
[1:06:34] with it
[1:06:36] you play with the fire the fire will
[1:06:38] burn you
[1:06:40] that fire that is in Pastor John Simon
[1:06:44] has transformed himself
[1:06:47] into five four ministry right here
[1:06:50] right here
[1:06:52] and moving
[1:06:54] and is projecting himself to the
[1:06:57] congregation
[1:06:58] it's not because Dan is so powerful
[1:07:01] tembia is so powerful there's no power
[1:07:04] for your Christopher or Desmond or me
[1:07:07] coffee or Philip or even call it no
[1:07:10] is God
[1:07:12] I said is Jesus
[1:07:15] is Jesus because he has chosen
[1:07:19] many are called
[1:07:22] few are chosen because the children not
[1:07:25] yet born the Lord says I love Jacob I
[1:07:29] hate Israel
[1:07:30] and yet
[1:07:33] when Jacob came to the world

[1:11:43] much
[1:11:43] sometimes it bring quora between you and
[1:11:46] your wife and kids
[1:11:48] because they are young they want their
[1:11:50] way
[1:11:51] and you are telling them by Grace not

[1:11:58] the old days of legalistics are gone
[1:12:01] you are telling them as God is showing
[1:12:04] you

[1:16:31] the guy look at me

[1:16:39] he looked at me he says do you know
[1:16:42] anybody that can help you sign for you

[1:17:15] do you know
[1:17:17] he says you can't find nobody to give
[1:17:19] you their 2000 I says where

[1:17:25] thousand
[1:17:26] but I said but the car is mine I'm going
[1:17:29] home with the car
[1:17:31] whatever it will take you to do it do it
[1:17:34] I'm going home with a car
[1:17:36] the guy believed me
[1:17:39] speaking like that
[1:17:40] the guy that was selling the car
[1:17:44] put his own two thousand dollars and
[1:17:48] give me the car
[1:17:49] that's why UJ has bought car from him
[1:17:52] his father has bought car from him
[1:17:55] I took Yuji to him Eugene older man
[1:17:59] and I got that car
[1:18:02] what is that by faith
[1:18:06] if we are surrendered to unto the Lord
[1:18:10] we are not going to be shocked of
[1:18:12] anything
[1:18:14] nothing
[1:18:17] we're going to be fed
[1:18:20] as the Lord wants
[1:18:23] he gonna Prosper us
[1:18:25] as we follow him
[1:18:28] God's children doesn't beg they don't go
[1:18:31] and beg
[1:18:33] okay
[1:18:35] we are number one
[1:18:37] in his eye
[1:18:39] we are number one in his heart
[1:18:44] all God desire is his children should
[1:18:47] worship Him
[1:18:48] if we worship Him
[1:18:51] whatever we need
[1:18:53] he will give it to us according to his
[1:18:56] word
[1:18:58] but many a times
[1:19:01] we let Tommy blocks come in front of us
[1:19:06] and
[1:19:08] the road becomes so hard
[1:19:11] by worshiping God
[1:19:14] by praising him
[1:19:16] by putting him first
[1:19:18] but let me tell you
[1:19:21] God
[1:19:22] if you worship God you have to go
[1:19:24] through prosecution
[1:19:26] if you scared of prosecution
[1:19:30] don't worship God and go your way
[1:19:34] because look into the Bible
[1:19:36] all the prophet the sons of Gods
[1:19:42] that went before us
[1:19:44] they all suffer prosecution
[1:19:48] and you are not obligated to go out
[1:19:54] you are going to
[1:19:55] face prosecution
[1:19:58] if you scared of that
[1:20:01] let me tell you
[1:20:04] just look at Africa
[1:20:06] Libya go watch the news
[1:20:10] there's some people crossing to brother
[1:20:12] down in your old country Italy
[1:20:15] you know how many die
[1:20:17] last year over 400 and something died
[1:20:20] but still that doesn't stop people to go
[1:20:24] because they determine
[1:20:27] to go there
[1:20:29] to change their life their natural life
[1:20:34] some of them when they are going there
[1:20:35] says if I perish let me perish and they
[1:20:38] really perish
[1:20:40] underwater
[1:20:42] some make it and your life change
[1:20:48] the gospel that the Lord has given to us
[1:20:51] you have to make up your mind
[1:20:55] if I perish
[1:20:57] let me perish with the gospel
[1:21:02] let me perish
[1:21:05] I'm not just talking
[1:21:07] listen
[1:21:08] this gospel
[1:21:11] Let Me Tell You Only God know me
[1:21:15] better than anybody here
[1:21:19] it has gripped my heart and they're not
[1:21:22] able to cut
[1:21:24] cut it
[1:21:25] of bringing the way proper way no no no
[1:21:29] no
[1:21:30] listen God give me one stone that's all
[1:21:34] right
[1:21:34] I'm gonna stay with that stone
[1:21:37] that word he has given me if it is five
[1:21:39] words that will slay Goliath I'm Gonna
[1:21:42] Keep It
[1:21:45] like I was preaching in Jungle
[1:21:48] and one nine years girl came to me I
[1:21:51] never forget he says brother when you
[1:21:53] were preaching you said Jesus Christ is
[1:21:55] God
[1:21:57] and Heaven on that
[1:21:59] there's no name whereby we will be saved
[1:22:02] only Jesus name when I go he says that
[1:22:06] that's what I come to you to baptize me
[1:22:09] When Heaven though is hoping
[1:22:12] Jesus name is on me and I'm going there
[1:22:15] with that name
[1:22:16] says I can't read and write
[1:22:19] but I'm going there I'm keeping that
[1:22:21] name in my heart
[1:22:23] and I'm going there when Heaven door is
[1:22:26] open nine years girl God is my witness
[1:22:29] he told to me like this in prison of
[1:22:32] people says I'm going there with that
[1:22:36] name
[1:22:39] what about you and I
[1:22:42] God by his grace
[1:22:45] has poured himself
[1:22:47] so much
[1:22:50] so much
[1:22:52] that we take it for granted
[1:22:55] everything
[1:22:57] we don't want to come to the house of
[1:22:59] God
[1:23:00] but we are chosen
[1:23:02] if you are charging
[1:23:04] you better come and take your medicine
[1:23:07] there's a medicine for you
[1:23:10] that medicine is not sweet it's better
[1:23:14] but come and take it
[1:23:16] some people they want sweet sweet honey
[1:23:19] you know children
[1:23:21] they want to be children always they
[1:23:23] love candy
[1:23:25] they sweet candy
[1:23:27] the chocolate that is bitter there's
[1:23:29] some chocolates they are so bitter you
[1:23:31] don't want to even eat it
[1:23:33] but that chocolate is good for the kids
[1:23:37] that bitter chocolate is good that
[1:23:40] bitter word of God is good for your soul
[1:23:43] because when you eat it
[1:23:46] it won't be easy
[1:23:48] sometimes we bring tears
[1:23:51] it bring pain
[1:23:53] and it will bring joy to
[1:23:56] it will bring prosperity to
[1:23:59] it will bring the word in your life to
[1:24:02] let the word manifest
[1:24:05] then you yourself let me tell you you'll
[1:24:09] be standing someplace
[1:24:11] God sometimes even he loved to do that
[1:24:15] it will take you not even in the church
[1:24:17] in a corner quiet place or somewhere
[1:24:22] and display himself
[1:24:24] when you go out from that place
[1:24:28] you will save my God lord
[1:24:32] it will bring tears to you we'll say I
[1:24:35] can but I can do this
[1:24:37] I saw this I see this I saw God move and
[1:24:42] it shocked you you know you don't have
[1:24:44] that knowledge
[1:24:47] and God is a yes
[1:24:49] you see because you take every
[1:24:51] bitterness
[1:24:53] every bitterness medicine I gave you you
[1:24:56] take it
[1:24:57] so I'm displaying to you that bitterness
[1:25:00] medicine what
[1:25:02] it has produced for you
[1:25:05] a lot of people want to see dead race
[1:25:07] walk blind scene I'm not
[1:25:10] blessing my preaching on that that is
[1:25:13] the the absolute no
[1:25:17] the absolute is when you have Christ
[1:25:20] but why we are here we need that
[1:25:24] it's part of the Gospel like the Lord
[1:25:26] won't put it in
[1:25:27] healing is part of the Gospel
[1:25:31] is part of the Gospel
[1:25:34] casting out devil is part of the Gospel
[1:25:36] all those things are good speaking in
[1:25:39] tongues prophecies all those things are
[1:25:42] good right but the main focus is on
[1:25:46] Christ
[1:25:49] you understand the Bible says this son
[1:25:52] shall follow that that belief in my name
[1:25:56] they will cast out what devils and if
[1:25:59] they eat any deadly thing it shall not
[1:26:02] add them
[1:26:05] somebody tried to poison you you didn't
[1:26:08] know don't hurt you because you know why
[1:26:10] the spirit of God is light it will cast
[1:26:14] that devil out
[1:26:19] many are called
[1:26:21] few are chosen
[1:26:23] at the day of Pentecost when the pillar
[1:26:26] of fire came down
[1:26:28] did you saw Judas was part of it
[1:26:31] on the pillow fire setting on their head
[1:26:34] no
[1:26:36] because even though he had all the calls
[1:26:40] like a lot of people they know all the
[1:26:44] prophet quotes they know all the Bible
[1:26:47] quotes
[1:26:49] but
[1:26:51] if they are not chosen they won't go in
[1:26:54] the rapture
[1:26:55] because the Rapture will vindicate
[1:27:00] the true bride the few that are chosen
[1:27:04] before we live here God will come and
[1:27:07] make himself manifest through us
[1:27:11] and show us and declares to the people
[1:27:15] and let them know he's with us the Lord
[1:27:19] does not hide because anything when they
[1:27:22] make a car
[1:27:23] when the car is finished it goes
[1:27:26] showroom
[1:27:27] right for everybody to see that car they
[1:27:31] look at it before they buy when they
[1:27:33] build a house
[1:27:34] their brother in the cell house
[1:27:37] the real estate people they're going
[1:27:39] with their customers
[1:27:41] and let me tell you Brian is sitting
[1:27:44] here
[1:27:45] when I was buying house the way even he
[1:27:47] checked the house I was my God
[1:27:52] is that how the brother looked the house
[1:27:54] even I would say oh brother it's okay
[1:27:57] let's he says no no no no no brother we
[1:27:59] eat check and Shake everything is good
[1:28:02] and you understand that is the way it is
[1:28:06] the gospel we are coming to an end
[1:28:10] that God will declare
[1:28:12] the chosen ones the few
[1:28:16] in the hidden in the message
[1:28:18] he's starting to prove himself
[1:28:22] he's starting it
[1:28:24] showing us even myself look at me I
[1:28:28] never thought I'll be standing here
[1:28:32] preaching I'll never talk I'll be
[1:28:35] standing in the congregation
[1:28:38] but listen it doesn't matter
[1:28:42] God
[1:28:44] said so
[1:28:46] now 24 hours I'm not afraid you put me
