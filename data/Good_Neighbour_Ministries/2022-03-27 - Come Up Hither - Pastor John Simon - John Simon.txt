[Music] thank you praise the lord so we enjoy it and we're glad to see our friends our homecoming believers praise the lord we're glad to see all of you and slowly the saints are trickling back into the services and we want to thank god for that i know it's been a rough time a very uh troublesome year and were troubles on every hand but god has brought us through it amen and i'm thankful to god for that praise his marvelous wonderful name now as we come together today i see the spirit of god already witnessing in the song service towards the word because you know worship precedes the word the tribe of judah always went forth singing praising and giving glory to god before the coming forth of the word of god we would like to speak from revelation chapter 4 reading from verse 1 verse 1 is the only verse that we will read and before we even read it just let us pray our gracious heavenly father in the name of jesus once again we have this privilege and honor to approach thee by the way of prayer and to stand before your beloved people as you draw near oh father may your spirit settle upon your people may the word of god go forth may every life be revived and inspired father as we commit ourselves to you now with the life from the word coming to us as your people in jesus name amen and amen the lord bless you praise god god bless you brothers and sisters amen after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shoot these things which must be here after amen god bless you just that one verse will do praise god after this of course brother branham says after this meaning after the church ages after the church jesus are over the last one is done after this a door is opened in heaven praise god the word begins to open up but let me not begin to speak on those things i want to quote from brother branham himself christ is the mystery of god revealed and he says here paragraph 6 37 being spiritual if you're watching spiritual things not knowing this but god knows it but if you turn now and look at the clock behind you it's on the dot of two o'clock it's the end of the second pull the third pull is at hand oh at the name of jesus bowing falling prostrate at his feet king of kings in heaven will crown him when our journey is complete oh precious name yes friends the second pull has been made manifested amen praise god and now he says did you notice that the spirit took the same song not another song but the same song but now picking it up taking it into a higher octave the next pull is now at hand amen oh friends don't you see god taking us with the same message that was always there he didn't change the song he didn't change the message the quotes are the same the word is the same but there is i don't know if you don't know it but i am feeling it i i'm experiencing it praise god there is something supernatural going on you can't explain it you can't it's nothing you can talk about but you either have to be a part of it in it or you won't even know what's happening because god has brought us in the middle of the pyramid praise god he's brought us into his secret chamber the bride's chamber the king's chamber and there we're having constant conference with the living god now and up picking the same song and picking it up into an octave higher like that what is it the next pull is at hand and take the name of jesus with you praise god hallelujah amen did you notice the scripture come up hither the changes are over it's all over it's now come up to a higher dimension go into a higher revelation a higher place with god the spirit at the end of the church ages john being a type of the true believer the spirit is telling him john the ages are over and now you've got to come up higher praise god hallelujah amen now how do we go up higher now we find in matthew chapter 17 verses 1 right on down to verse three after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringing them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured he jesus the same word that they knew all that three and a half years it's the same word it hasn't changed but now the word is transfigured before them o praise god and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was as white as snow and behold there appeared unto them moses and elijah speaking talking with them amen hallelujah praise god not only did he take him up into the mountain where they begin to see him the word uh under another influence they saw the word now revelated translated uh transformed before their very eyes they were looking at it every day every day for years they're reading it they're hearing it they're seeing it they heard every sermon that the prophet preached they heard every sermon jesus preached but now it's the same jesus but he's transfigured before them [Music] and when he he was transfigured before them their god so empowered by the holy spirit they begin to see a clear revelation from the beginning of the bible right to the times of jesus it says that moses and elijah were talking to them up there they were able to see the path of life the revelation of the word making itself clear before them praise be to god hallelujah listen to god's prophet man speaks on the message at thy word may every person that's been bound by sense bound right living in a sense bound existence where they are only trusting in what they can see what they can hear what they can feel or what they can smell oh my friends may you all begin to allow that to fall away from you may it go from you so that you might rise into the realms the higher realms of the holy spirit oh may this church rock with the power of the holy ghost oh praise god lose your self-bound existence forget about yourself it's nothing to do with us friends it's nothing to do with us not our works not our trying to work yourself up into an emotion or into a man-made holiness that you produce by your own efforts but this is now to a place where god has brought us into the perfect liberty of jesus christ this is the hour when the holy spirit has freed us amen to a place where we are really free we are really liberated we are not even trusting in our own works you don't even trust in yourself you're only trusting in god to keep you amen paul said we are kept by the power of god through our revelation amen praise peter god hallelujah amen moses one day god said to moses moses tell them so long i'm going to tell them something here that i'm going to call you up higher come up the mountain come up today rise to the top of the mountain calling moses to the top of the mountain amen praise god i believe god is calling every one of us to the top of this pyramid i believe the holy spirit is calling every one of us to go higher in the realms of god amen oh praise god uh well i appreciate that here's what i want to say science as we know it today it does not even know god see they're on the tree of knowledge but the tree of knowledge only goes so far and then when you get that is as high as they can go oh climb up that tree of knowledge as far as you can you see what he's saying he's not putting aside you don't need education you don't need knowledge he says climb the tree as far as you can climb it as far as you can and then when you get there step right off onto the tree of faith and go to believing god like that and you'll see the glory of god hallelujah let's take a step tonight today and step on the tree of faith and believe god's word to the very end amen hallelujah oh he says here i used to sing a little song oh lord lead me higher up the mountain give me fellowship with thee it will light up to me the fountain and the blood that blood that cleanses me may the living god lead us up the mountain today may the holy spirit take us to the top of the pyramid and minister to us amen oh praise god greater witness than john there is a higher realm that we can climb into i want you to go there and we are going there higher someday amen but we can't stay here praise god hallelujah oh my god is good isn't he many of you have followed this message believe this message myself i believe the message of the living god since my teenage oh following the line of the holy spirit all the way i could not explain everything i did not understand everything but from the very first day i heard the message of god i felt something in my soul telling me even though i can't understand it here something here tells me that's right amen and i've held to god's word to this hour and i'll continue to the hall to god's war to the end oh my praise god hallelujah oh thank god you know god portrays himself as an eagle jehovah eagle he portrays his prophets also as eagles great eagles now listen to the prophet speaking about eagles right here in this marvelous message if an eagle can have confidence in the two wings that god gave him how much more can we as believers have confidence in the holy ghost that save your soul and baptize your soul amen now i watch that eagle there from in the woods he didn't push he didn't squabble he just made one leap i would say leap of faith he made one leap see and he just decided that's it i'm not standing this anymore praise god and he jumped out and set his wings and when he did that the first time he had to flop a couple of times he had to flop those wings you got to do some works at first it looks like works and looks like hard life hard christianity you got to really try hard to be a christian everything else like that and he flopped a couple of times and once he got above the rest of it amen the rest of all they are get to that just set his wings what did he do he put his faith in them wings that god gave him to get now into action now i want you to recognize whether branham preached this message but you've got to understand the voice that came through him was not brother branham that was god using a prophet to speak through the spirit speaks through the prophet that was the holy spirit ministering onto his bride hallelujah and so we understand what was going on here that he he put his faith into his wings and got into action brother branham preached recognizing hearing you heard the word you've been hearing it for all these years then it got to a certain place where revelation struck you you begin to recognize of course brother bradley explains recognize means understand see perceive observe you perceive it and you take it in after you hear it you recognize it then the next thing you got to put it into action right many messages have been preached about the angels that were around the throne when isaiah saw them you know with their various wings and so on but he says get into action praise god but you see is humanly speaking we still thinking sense bound get into action mean that you gotta run out here run out there run after this person chase after that wong lasso the next relative you have throw them to the ground and put a brand a message brand on them and you know what i'm saying oh my but we understand friends that that's not what it is telling us about get into action it's not you getting into action but positioning your wings and positioning yourself that the spirit of god can take you and begin to act and work through you for this is the writing of another book of acts and the book of acts says the prophet of god it's not the action of the apostles but the acts of the holy spirit himself working through the apostles so that getting into action is letting go yourself and let the holy spirit begin to act through you be yourself don't try to be somebody else don't try to be like brother branham with a belt buckle and stand up like him and talk like him and act like him oh my goodness there's only one god sent like him is that right we are we are just following what he left behind the word amen right just relax right seven church ages the prophet said uh be simple be humble he said don't go walking and making yourself well in the midst of the people you might not say it but the way you're walking and acting i'm a christian i'm born again i'm different from you no he says we are all the same amen only that you are the weak weeping crying and thanking god that out of the midst of this mess that we have in the world today god called you out and cleansed you and washed you by his precious blood and that's why you're here today by the grace of god amen not by the will of man not by the will of man but by the will or purpose of the living god you're here led by the holy spirit he said how do you think you come in here tonight you think you just walked in of yourself you think you just come like that he says you're here because the spirit of god led you here amen and you are hearing what you're supposed to hear because you're the ones that supposed to hear what you're hearing god placed the day the time the person the word of everything everything praise god just as in the vision of the prophet except everything being placed nothing will happen but god set you here he set the time set the place set everything up so praise god hallelujah some of you heard my message where in the book of proverbs when the uh jesus speaking the spirit of god speaking the spirit of christ speaking saying a body has now prepared me i was set up before the foundation of the world i want to tell you you were set up you you didn't just do this or do that on your own you were set up praise god hallelujah i was set up you were predestinated you were elected or you were placed by the grace of almighty god that's why you're here today and that's why god is sending forth the word to your soul oh praise his name hallelujah amen at this time of my life amen at my age i should be old and helpless in the crippet but instead i feel more life i feel more anointed i feel more preserved by the grace of god it's like the eagle renewing its strength praise god hallelujah praise his wonderful name amen amen hallelujah watch that eagle all he was waiting for is a puff of wind just one little puff that he could take advantage of amen and once he got that puff of wind he never flopped in that wind ever again no more works your work's over he just rode the wind which is the type of course of the holy spirit he just set his wings and rods the wind and the wind took him higher and higher and another wind come and it took him even higher and he rose higher and higher until i could not see him no more hallelujah amen he went right out of sight glory be to god oh my friends this is not of works just be yourself be who you are amen eat what you want drink what you want i'm not saying that you see and i don't need to explain that to a true believer but unless there be any cardinal i must explain it doesn't mean eat what you want you go out and eat whatever is out there drink what you want you go drinking johnny walker whiskey or heidi no it doesn't mean that but it means you are free is that right you're free praise the lord absolutely free and if the holy spirit really is having his preeminence within your soul you don't have to worry amen because even if even if if if i'm going to say three times so people hear it and i say oh my god brother simon said he was in a baru no i didn't say that i said if even if you were into a bar room and you are right there the spirit of god in you is going to control you is going to tell you what to do and what not to do nothing can overcome you because now you're an overcomer not by yourself he said how can you overcome by him who is in you that has already overcome [Applause] you're not going to overcome by your working anything up yourself or trying to oh i i shouldn't be drinking this but oh no thank you no it's not of works unless any man should boast it's by the holy spirit that's in you amen blessed be the name of the lord now i want you to know this also does not mean once now run over to this meeting run over here go over there join that kick over the metals run to the baptist go to the assemblies go to the oneness no that isn't it it is just to set your faith in the action of god's word and let that ride you away on every wind of the holy spirit that breathes down from heaven upon your mortal being then when you set your faith in god and begin to say and believe god's word is right here are my wings lord here is what i see with the new and old testament i believe every word of it amen oh my when you do that then it will begin to pack you amen hallelujah you see you had the word but now the words got you is that right you had the holy i got the holy now the holy ghost has got you it's a different thing i've always said it like when the child holding on to the mother skirts but when there's danger it might get scared and loose loose off our skirt and run into the traffic but when the mother says we're crossing this street here i don't want nothing to happen to you and she grabbed that hand she'd rather die before that child nobody is getting that child no amen and that's what god is saying to you now i got you in my hands i'm not gonna lose one not one that i've got a hold of i'm not gonna lose you amen praise god you're his he is your elected saints of the living god amen here is my rings lord he brought you from a sinner to a christian he brought you from a cursing sinner to a preacher amen instead of cursing in other words you're speaking the word it took you take you and brought you from blindness to health amen he brought you from sickness into health and one day he's gonna take you from this heart right into glory amen hallelujah my faith rests alone in jesus christ my lord hallelujah amen you see that's what all them he wrote hebrews 11. then he wrote old testament their faith it was showing that they put it into action hallelujah you got them for an example now rise up take your faith put it on him into action then ride away on the powers of the holy spirit of the living god amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah aren't you glad you're a christian and glad you're a believer [Applause] amen amen hallelujah oh praise god i tell you friends it's wonderful to know that god is great now brothers i tell you when god sets a a man for a world task he has got to have something better than the world has got he's got to have something better than the church has got he's got to have a double portion of the spirit than they have got if there ever was a time that we need a double portion it is today can you say amen [Applause] hallelujah we need that double portion while we live in the realms of people in the midst of people we got to have something in us bigger better and higher amen we cannot continue eating just beans on cornbread that's all good is anything wrong with beans i like uh beans and rice and like corn bread oh my corn cornbread from them in the salt the way they make it it's really tasty i love a nice cornbread amen praise god see oh my you see it's good it's very good he says but sometimes you just have to reach up a little higher in god and we do that you see you've got to do it you've got to keep claiming you see instead of backsliding like israel did you've got to keep climbing climbing but don't stay on the same ground all the time you'll be back sliding like israel did praise god you know that it's like any fish if the fish decide well i'm i'm not gonna swim anymore and yeah hey and just stop he's going with the stream he's going to go back but if he if he flops and everything else then he's going to go up right upstream so that's what he's talking about here amen now notice jesus did not put on public shows to make himself into some kind of a club is that right now he's talking about how some of the people every night coming to his meetings and all they want to see is miracles all they want to see is them calling out the people like like somebody putting on a show they don't realize it was for a purpose it it's going to it's the attraction on the mountain it's the sign of the time it's going to track the rainbow trout it's going to catch the attention of the true believers now watch i want you to see jesus's ascension and how the ascension started amen they didn't even realize it where the ascension started now watch him jesus as he stands there this is from the infallible proof of the resurrection as he stands there gravitational begins to lose its power amen now watch his feet begin to come up from the earth and there's a light beneath his feet and he rises higher and higher and higher for gravitation lost his power and death lost its power now i know he's talking about jesus but the speaks of you too if you see the true word of god gravitation is losing its power over you hallelujah another place he says you know how it's losing his power you're being pressurized for the journey amen he says them other birds hawks and all those things he said they can't fly up where the eagles are why he says they're not pressurized amen so come to a joy when you pass through fiery trials for the trying of your faith work and patience amen yes sir your fail of your faith amen listen see he was the center of all gravitation he is the creator of gravitation he holds gravitation at his command just as he holds death at his command praise god he stops there but the rest of it how i'm talking here with you is that as you believe this word and recognize that you are not only believing the word you begin to see that you are a part of that word so when he is talking about him now and the gravitational power leaving him and he's starting to rupture or ascend he don't even know it but he's going i want you to know the rapture is now in progress the rapture is now in progress the rapture as people believed and many still believe is not just at an event on a certain day but it is a process glory unto glory unto glory until at the last on a certain dead time i don't know when nobody knows when you step right into glory oh praise god you step out of this looking glass world right into the reality of the perfect will and powers of god hallelujah oh my praise god listen brother brandon speaking now the manifestation of these gifts are given to any man to prophet wherewithal and i believe all gifts are wonderful and we need gifts and we respect them praise god in the church of god but i believe that time is coming when it's taking this and we are going to a higher standard than gifts after all these things is done away with all gifts all speaking in towns all this all that you heard paul say it in first corinthians 13 then he says when all this will be done away with only love will endure hallelujah the love of god will endure you see people when they think of the love of god they think of love of god like the love of man that a man loves his wife or a man as a you know he loves his brother he loves his family or something like that but that's human love but the love of god is love but a different kind of love right but because you only see love from one perspective right you got to understand what love is john for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son is that right what is god's love to you then that he gave his word the revealed word is that right that is telling his bride how much he loved her among all these people among all these believers that believe the message prophet says remember the remnant will be is the same it's the same pattern they cut from he says this one is the same material amen it's not a different cloth but god elected you to be within that pattern and that is the love of god to you that he brought you in the pattern of the bride uh the bright class of saints amen that elected lady of the last day that he brought to him that's what this is all about i'm talking about the love of god hallelujah this love of god this fact that god has revealed his word to you not explained not informed not give you a religious education you know you know there's educational departments in the churches today to educate you into sunday school educate you religious education we're not talking about religious education this is not my religious education as you know it talks about that some old woman could be up in the woods somewhere there and all of a sudden she's reading her vibe all of a sudden she gets a flash of revelation on that word and the curtain is now torn and once that curtain is torn it begins to open up and you can walk into that holy of holies amen hallelujah and then you begin to see the glories of god within the word of god not by outside teacher right but by the inside tuition of the holy spirit teaching you the word of god hallelujah not that you don't respect outward teachers they're only your guides they will guide you to the water hole but you have to drink hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen friends jesus doesn't have a freak body he don't have no six fingers on one hand he only has five fingers on one hand hallelujah and the body of christ will never be some freak see and when the last person comes into this body of christ then it's all over right now i don't know which one this might have been the last one come in this morning you might have been the last one but maybe over in africa today somewhere the last one someday will be brought in but when that last one is done you may go ahead doing all your preaching preach the gospel that's all right but at that time there will be no response to it see what i'm telling you you will preach the same gospel amen but see there is no response whatsoever praise god god keeps his word friends you see where we're at now i thought last week i was telling you that door is closing fast and we are like no before the whole thing closes up we are noah in the ark door screaming to the people come run come quickly come up hither come in quick while you have time hallelujah we're crying to them hallelujah for them to get into the art door praise god here brother branham he says you know i've been preaching all these years but there's now a change coming in my ministry hallelujah see now that person see uses my voice and then it or he i use the word he he use the word it it will speak out but i say he will speak out and tell them what is wrong with them you remember that i told you how the holy spirit told me that night when i talked with him and said if you will be sincere and will come to that place i will let show you even the secret of their hearts hallelujah but then he said if you will then continue to be sincere and humble i will make it grow greater and greater and greater and now this ministry hallelujah is going to step now higher into another realm where it'll be far beyond what it ever was amen i don't know just what it is yet but i'm warned of the holy spirit to go quickly now close off all the rest of my meetings that i've been having see because when i come out again it will be a new ministry the minister this ministry of course will never cease but this one will continue on this will continue on it will just be the same but this new ministry will continue on in other words the message will continue on that's okay but this ram that is going into this one octave higher that he is breaking into that my friends that one is going to continue right on to the very end of time oh thanks be to god hallelujah i'm so glad friends that after jesus 40 days with his disciples ministering to them that he decided it's time for him to ascend and go into the presence of the father reading that's from living dying buried rising coming 1959 now i'm quoting from another place simeon read in the scriptures where there was coming a messiah amen he was reading the scripture he didn't care about prestige when he began to tell them people about that scripture you see he knew he was going to live to see the messiah so he wasn't ashamed praise god are you ashamed to talk about the rapture are you ashamed to talk that you're going to be caught up are you going to be ashamed to tell people that you're going to be caught into the presence of god sudden secret catching away the bride of jesus christ this is what he's talking about here in parables was that right oh my see he didn't care about prestige when he was talking about that all right of course you know there were what the world would have thought about that they would have taught that old man's gone insane he's off a little bit in his head his mind is slowly leaving him and it be said you see friends remember that will also be said about you when people begin to take this word and begin to believe that promise with all their heart it will become so supernatural in them till people of the people of the world they will seem to them like they are crazy and you did use the word crazy you're gonna seem to be crazy first of all what god you're talking about what do you mean when you say god you talk about rapture leaving this place here you see because remember god is so much greater his promises his power and his being is so much greater and his expectations of us is so much higher than the things of the world till to them because we are living according to his word and his expectation but the world is seeing it from the way the world is acting on what they're doing and because we live according to this higher expectation of him you see he says according to the scripture all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions but blessed are you when you are persecuted amen hallelujah oh thank god i'm so glad that when you receive this word you become an eagle you realize that you are of an eagle spirit praise god we don't need but quickly you know we all come from the great logos god himself and that's why god was showing the little licks of fire on the head of the apostles to show that he allowed each one of them a part of himself in them and this is what the message is doing now not by a big carrying on in the top of an upper room amen praise god and i can see how the crowds would gather because i was there in israel and it's easy when we got you were there at the top of the stairs if people started keeping noise a lot of people are passing they would all want to know what in the world is going on amen see but here it is my friends he says but today you know what will be uh if you're an eagle you get tired of listening to them squirrels chattering chattering chattering chattering all the time i know this i know that i the bible says this the bible says that prophet said this they even want to bury you as one man i heard one man tell another well i'll bury you with coats if you you don't know what you're talking about i'll bury you with quotes everything like that see but you said you get so tired of listening to that squirrel and some of them squirrels and this is not me he's saying it here they even curse you chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter he just looked over amen now that eliza just looked over sideways at that squirrel and he got so annoyed with him the only thing that he could do is give a big jump right and flop his wings twice and then set his sails his wings and rise up in the wind oh praise god isn't that what we have to do listening to all this chatter all around everybody knows praise god everybody has revelation do you know that now we're preaching revelation we're talking a lot about revelation all of a sudden everybody's got revelation but they don't know what revelation is but anybody can say they have revelation is that right but then when you talk to them on the word or listen to the things they're saying you know they're completely off is that right praise god hallelujah it's just like some false person writing my wife a letter the moment she gets that letter and begin to read it she'll know definitely that's a fake because that's not the way i write that's not the way i talk that's not the way i say things amen that's that's somebody else trying to take my words and now trying to make them sound like if it's me but but then the person that has a personal private relationship with him they know it's not him they know that's you talking there amen praise god so we look on the word keep your eyes on the word and let the world take control over your senses preeminence the preeminence of christ takes control over the senses of man hallelujah amen see he got so tired of all the chatter chatter chatter amen looking looking back talking about days of miracles is past amen hallelujah all we can talk about brother i remember i was in this meeting with brother branham and this happened and that and that's wonderful but that's not where this is at now it's gone much higher than that we're no more back in this meeting and that meeting and this miracle happened and he called out this person by their name but the holy spirit is trying to call you now by your name and tell you what is your address exactly what state you're in and what you're living in and you need to come here quickly come up here come into the perfect word come up hither if you heard from your theophany rise up in the name of jesus christ and come up into a hierarchy of the revelation of the word of god hallelujah amen yes sir don't listen to them chattering all the time set your wings in the power of god and let the holy spirit rise you up above it all go on what break through the sound barrier break through the sun barrier voices voices voices voices all around you he says but you listen for the voice amen praise god you get tired whatever you want they want to call you or whatever you got tired of that chatter chatter chatter amen listening to all them chipmunks oh if if the church one of these days would only get tired of that you'll know how to set your wings and then like enoch take a walk with god take a walk with god right out of it amen that's what he wants you to do do you believe it amen see god will take you right out of this if you'll believe it in every form and fashion the discernment is now leaving me see he's saying this from that time listen to the message from this time that's the time john 6 6 when the bible says because of the things jesus began to say like eat my flesh drink my blood i and my father are one him and before abraham was i am praise god he begins to say things like that amen brother branham said see when he was a nice young rabbi preaching preaching the torah they they followed flocked after him and believed him when he become in his years of popularity begin to be the great healer oh he said trumps them follow him but when he began to speak the word hallelujah i and my father are one amen abraham you say you are abraham's children you say you believe the prophet you say that you believe elijah before abraham was i am praise god hallelujah and the bible says john chapter 6 listen how god's mathematics 66 he says here and they walked with him no more and it's from this message brother branham says it says from that time they walk with him no more he preached on from that time right and he's look at where he's placing it now this discernment is now leaving i am now stepping into a higher ministry what is it it's the ministry of speaking the word is that right i want to say that again because these little simple things it's just a little short thing he's talking about he says the discernment and the ministry of discernment is now leaving i am stepping now into a higher ministry it's the ministry of speaking the word greater works than these shall you do brother mike great works hallelujah you see the carnal person is looking at oh my god the third pull on brother mike he's gonna call open the heavens he's gonna speak on uh legs on people oh praise god brother let's follow brother mike now he knows that i'm just i'm preaching we're just talking praise the name of the lord you've got to understand brother the thing has switched amen and now it's speaking of the word and it's so much that even when i say that you can be cast off because you think might be speaking the bible it can be mean just speaking the message but it's not that the logos word is not the written word it's the it's the unwritten word it's he himself because god is not the writing on the page god is the being that's rides on the world you're right he says you're looking at the tv he says you know all those pictures and everything comes he says you know those demon spirits ride on those pictures and those images right into your mind right well i'm just telling you in the same way the holy spirit rides on the white horse of the word of god into your soul amen amen he rides into your soul praise god by the word of god hallelujah and the discernment is leaving and now i'm stepping into a higher ministry just preaching just talking the word just sharing with people is that all uh but simon i'm not saying any speaking in terms but simon i don't feel i'm growing because i i don't feel i'm commanding any demons well judas cast out devils and jesus turned around and and he heard every sermon jesus ever preached and he still wasn't converted is that right and then jesus said depart from me you workers of iniquity is that right oh my you can have all those things but it's gone past that you see and it's gone into another realm that's why he says god hides in simplicity and he manifests himself in the same so don't feel oh i don't know the message all i can tell the people is is about the prophet and jesus and this and that well god will take you higher and higher once you're sincere and you hold to his word and believe his promise he'll take you right through don't judge yourself and say oh i i'm not strong in a message i don't know it like brother so and so i don't know what it likes is you know what god didn't ask you to know anything he asked you do you believe do you know this no you didn't ask them that he said do you believe so if you believe the rest will he'll bring the rest when he wants to you another place brother branham said and there will know when it is time for them to know right oh my oh praise god hallelujah amen you see i was in brother up lost out lost church up there we were all singing we're going up hallelujah how many knows that song we're going up in the first resurrection praise god of course while i was referring this message i was singing lord plant my feet on higher ground i higher plane than i have found lord plant my feet on higher ground amen we're going on up amen you see we are climbing the first round of the ladder then the first round we know was justification of that ladder the second round was sanctification the third wrong glorification the holy spirit himself now come down i started up up up up up until my friends now i seem to have struck the milky white way i thought we go up any higher or church of god if you as the church keeps going that's what we need today is to go higher higher until we hit strike that milky white way calvary's way rise up in the power of the holy ghost lay aside your creeds differences and feelings and sensations start up up up up that's what we need to do praise god hallelujah i believe that amen praise god hallelujah now remember when he was speaking to john revelation you have your bible there you may not have to read it but revelation 4 1 he says john after this come up hither and i will show thee things that must shortly come to pass hallelujah you see what he was telling john is john come up hither and i will show you what is going to be taking place after them church ages are over hallelujah god don't forget the quote john is a type of the the bride the believer the type of the bright believer and he says after them church age is over then come into a revelation come in come up higher come into a higher octave come on heather come into a hierarchy i'm calling you to come up higher so that from that high place like an eagle can see further than any other bird amen then i can show you the things that are going to be taking place and what's going to be hereafter amen when he the spirit of truth is come he'll guide you into all truth and he will show you things that are to come oh glory to god amen hallelujah oh praise god what is it you must recognize that my thoughts are higher than your thoughts amen and my ways are higher than your ways that is the blueprint do you understand what he's saying here you you're still thinking like just man but but you gotta come into my thoughts come up here let me bring you into my way of thinking bring you into my thoughts that you begin to start thinking like me acting like me walking like me moving like me praise god take you from man's thoughts into god's thoughts praise god around this time some people are going to think i'm speaking in tongues but this is the new tongues you may not understand it but oh glory to god hey amen but it's a word of the living god amen praise god john come up here though come up after them ages are over so that i can't i can't talk to you down there at that realm anymore oh praise god amen i can't talk to you down there in that age like that anymore so come up here though amen right oh come up here the prophet says here i mean come up higher see come up here with me now john i'll show you what's going to take place oh my my my and he was caught up in the vision then caught up into glory praise god hallelujah oh my do you know you know what you get caught up into right now you you say is this a vision boy what is it you're walking in it right now the next step is right into glory in the presence of the living god you see remember paul was still on earth brother branham said ii corinthians 12 2 and 4 he was already on the earth a man but yet he was caught up in a vision praise do you believe that can happen praise god hallelujah and he was but it wasn't uh expedient for him to talk about what he saw amen oh my but it was different when john was caught up jesus said john go and write this in a book send it back tell the churches you see one was forbidden to speak the seals were not yet open and as the first church aged messenger just like god back in the beginning of genesis god show abraham the plan of salvation the coming of the redeemer that's why jesus could say yes abraham rejoiced to see my day abraham being a prophet already saw right but now being the first church h messenger god allow him to get some understanding of the seven church ages that was to come right and there with that understanding of what he had he was not allowed to say or speak anything he wasn't allowed to speak paul was forbidden to speak but john was even asked to put it in a book so that it could go down through the ages oh my do you see it's revealed now it was to be revealed in the last day but it's revealed now and you repeat it again it wasn't revealed in the last day but it's revealed now as we go along praise god keep following walk keep walking don't stop keep walking don't stop keep walking with the word keep don't stop keep walking praise god oh oh lord he said to the the angel should i turn through the street should i stop now no just keep walking keep walking i'll tell you when to stop but you keep walking and that's all we got to do now amen root my friends resting and then root rewarded hallelujah praise god notice john was taken up i want you to i want to say this again see john was taken up john type of the believer immediately after the church age which is a type of the raptured church immediately after the church age is over after this leodisian church age then comes the rapture hallelujah praise god then comes the rapture after the radiation church age is over you understand what i'm what's going on it doesn't mean you go up in the rapture but he's telling them here the minute the edition church edge is over the rapture process is started the process of the rapture is started amen hallelujah and you are caught in it now you've been set up brother bill you've been set up and now you're caught in the process of the word of god hallelujah you're being carried or carried away by the bright winds of the holy spirit john it did what it did to john it'll do to you it took him into the presence of god hallelujah he was caught up amen the rapture the church oh my don't you see how things are that right now we're talking from the book of revelation and that the book of revelation was written at the end of the church age amen don't you understand friend hallelujah all the ages are over amen the books were open oh my goodness and then the book was open praise god i'm glad at this hour that we are just here now all the books compendium of the books come together in a bright form all the word has come together in the form of a bride which we know now the son of man now being revealed in a bright form as he the headship was in a physical body there as a man his wife who comes from his side now comes in the form of a woman and she comes in the form of a woman their word sons and daughters of god children of god now being made manifested right but it's not him you're not going to see him because now it's her now it's the bride being manifested now it's the bright form of god hallelujah and that bride is now going back to his side that she was taken out of right back where she come from hallelujah to be know and recognize her oneness with him praise god hallelujah amen think about it how god told him after these things what did he mean after means after them church ages have ceased revelation chapter four see after them chances of cease that's when the believer john is summoned to come up hither come up into a hierarchy come out of those church ages come out of all them ages out of everything they were wonderful they're good it's not that they disappear right is that jesus was explaining to the pharisees i didn't come to do away with the law i come to magnify or fulfill that is the greek says magnify i want to put light in other words on the whole thing so you understand all the types and shadows in the old testament in the temple and the tabernacle all was speaking about me yeah come to magnify to fulfill praise god not to do away and you don't come to do away with the message but to magnify the word of the living god that believers must recognize who they are and the day that they are living in oh praise god john was summoned to come up here though hidden higher which means come up here you see and he showed him what was going to happen in the rest of the of the show him the rest of the world what was happening in the rest of the world then after them ages was over john the type of every true believer that will be summoned like that by christ on high amen the summon is come up hither come into a hierarchy forceful body healing second pull discernment spirit amen third paul the word going right straight to your soul praise god the speaking of the word to appeal to your soul what is the attraction of the mountain the unveiling of the mighty god the word revealing itself or making itself known to you hallelujah oh my yes sir think about it enoch how he was taken home raptured from death noah was there in the ark door hallelujah but then that enoch he found he was walking one day and found like he was losing touch with with his hole or there you see and one of his foot went a little higher than the other and then when he tried to make another step that other foot went even a little higher and then the other again another foot higher and the first thing you know he just had to look back and say farewell world and he just walked right up into glory and when no amen was that the remnant they're just same pattern same same clock they're virgins just like you that just weren't allowed to be in the elected pattern right oh my he looked around and he didn't know where enoch went oh my and he knew it was time for him to work on that ark to carry over and he uses the word i just used so you think it's that's me saying it to carry over that remnant right you see he built that ark there to carry over that remnant and that's the same thing that takes place right here now amen see john in type is taken up hallelujah every christian the same voice is saying to you come up my my he stops there my oh there what's what a summons what a reality amen to hear that clear distinct trumpet voice turn around serve me come up to where i am hallelujah moses representing the dead saints elijah with his group at the last day amen not the old elijah back there now you see he brought that all monk transfiguration thing down to our time and he's saying now this elijah with his group at this last day with his raptured group now standing there all before before the lord jesus hallelujah amen see and i want you to know friends before i leave here that this is an individual affair how many believe that out of revelation chapter 4 he says for we everyone live a private life and you even live live a private life with your god is that right each one of us when you get in your prayer closet or even when you get by your table with your bible open or or you just sit there and like i do many times and you you think i'm just sitting there with my eyes closed and like that sometimes my eyes are wide open but i'm praying amen praise god hallelujah he says but you have that private life with your god it's an individual affair see these things of the spirit will then carry you into places that sometimes you dare not even speak of it you'll dare not amen praise the name of the lord i'm so happy that we are one of them and that i'm a part of this great uh accomplishment that's taken place thank god how many of you like the changes going on in the world today they are they're emphasizing about electric car praise god hallelujah and um it's gone to the point where we move from from the uh the ox cart with the stone wheels and we move on up until we start getting bicycles with rubber little rubber tires and cars that had some tires that look like bicycle wheels and everything else but listen to him out of the countdown you see everything is going higher the automobile was a higher form of transportation then the horse came was a higher form the horse was a higher form of transportation than the bicycle the automobile was a higher form of transportation then the airplane came that was a higher form of transportation but they all accompanied one another see oh see they were using horsepower but now we are here with god's power the holy ghost power the holy ghost is the one see they were natural scientists by education but now comes god's spiritual scientist hallelujah they believe god's word man did that by education amen it means going into space by education right the natural science and natural scientists but the spiritual scientist is doing it by revelation praise god one by education the other by revelation do you believe it praise god simpson he says blessed art now simon uh jonas peter you remember he says it he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it amen praise god remember it's no more talking about holy church there is no somebody may say i'm criticizing no right i'm criticizing church and churches and all this kind of stuff but a real preacher as b brings judgment and he has to be a critic by the word if he uses his emotion to be a critic then he's guilty but he's got to go by the word there's no such thing as any holy church there is no holy organization whatsoever see the holy spirit may even be preached in it but in there you'll still find good and bad and ugly the good the bad and the ugly right in the chair he says they're renegades you'll find them in there indifferent ones and everything else so organization will not hold you can't i got it none of the rest of them has it no sir you see as an organization as a group no you can't say that the holy spirit is only poured out upon individuals praise god you see individuals and that is why i say that even this tabernacle is not a holy ghost tabernacle you see there is no such a thing as a holy church the individuals that come into this church them is the holy ghost tabernacles see they are tabernacles that contain the holy ghost but not the church the church the building the group that's not in the body it's them whom the holy ghost tabernacles in them hallelujah that's where it is amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god oh my glory to god i can't say it like brother branham amen it's not two o'clock so don't look around but at that time he said see look at the clock it's two o'clock the spirit of god takes the same song we've always seen picking it up but now he's taking it into a hierarchy do you get the gist of this message he's taking the very word not making something extraordinary something no no but he's taking it into a higher dimension right he's taking you into the perfect world come up higher praise god into the word of god come up hither he says it's later than you think come out of the mud come up into a higher life come up pull away from that what is it you're done in a mud all you little flowers you've got a life buried within you and that life in you is pressing you is pushing you and that's what is calling you and it's calling come up out of the mud amen praise god that's out of the message how can i overcome yes friends the holy spirit calling us to come up here though amen do you know the messenger was to bring the word every messenger to every church age how many knows that he's the angel to the age but now he is speaking here now i don't know all these things how i'm all these years and the message and now i'm finding these little stakes and praise god what do you think really was each messenger what was martin luther the messenger was not just to speak bring the word but the messenger was there to rebuke that catholic church what was wrestling he was a rebuke to the lutherans what was pentecost now we don't say him he doesn't mention himself because he is the messenger of the pentecostal church ace which is the ledecian church age he said he is a rebuke to them but where has the life gone when it left there where has it gone it's gone from them group and organization the thing is no more a shock it's gone to the grain what is that it is a rebuke to pentecost to fulfill the scriptures of this hour notice not when the messenger of the age starts out but when he begins to declare the message the word amen the forceful healing second paul prophesying but under that third poll comes the opening of the word when he begins to declare that the mysteries are then revealed and there is no higher order than that than to reveal the word no matter what hallelujah no higher order than the revealing of the word remember the third pull was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word i know you're getting a little tired now i know that you're ready to go home and have your wonderful supper but praise god that one will last you for about two hours and you'll be hungry again but this one will take you right to eternity amen [Applause] i'll be finished shortly anyway praise god hallelujah amen oh my think about it nor enter into the ark i want you to notice it was not noah that shut the door from them people it was god himself that shut the door see oh my see oh the clouds they doubted and doubted but when them rains began to fall and the sewers began to back up and the fountains of the deep broke up when that begin to happen the spree springs belching forth their waters people began to climb under the roofs of their houses you see the old arc set the same but after a while when enough began to get around the ark the ark began to rise hallelujah this word that they're doubting doubting doubting the evil outside is going to rise to such a height and because the word had your hearts your lies your soul prepared that evil god is going to use it to turn and lift lift the ark higher he says the people knocked on the windows they batted at the doors they screamed but it did them no good at that time even no he repeats again could not open that door god himself had closed it god's the only one that can open it so is it today for our ark is jesus christ the word and god has opened the door for us aren't you glad he opened the door for us to enter in amen and he'll close it as surely as he opened it for us he'll close it for others praise the lord isn't that something my goodness i thank god for his grace that i'm in the car i'm in the rocket ship because when you're in the car in the odyssey and night and the car had light shining the lights that is shining in the eyes of the people in the darkness blinds them but it makes you see where you're going so we're so happy that we are a part of him musicians come along here praise the name of the lord i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them come up hither come up into a higher octave come into the perfect word there is much more that could be said but there's enough said here that can fertilize and irrigate the minds of preachers and people who are thinking on the word that can expand on this and uh make it something even greater and a greater blessing to god's people god bless every one of you hallelujah god bless brother anthony as he comes along here and leading the word of god hallelujah thank god aren't you glad let him lead us to a higher plane with all the scriptures we searched and studied and stay up all night and pray until three o'clock in the morning and all that but still it takes him the holy spirit when we set our wings for him to lift us up and take us to a higher plane than we have found by searching and searching is that right [Music] you see the satan works in so many ways but god's holy spirit takes charge and works in his own blessed way and i'm thank god i'm glad we're together again amen i'm glad we're back in the house of god [Applause] and one by one as the saints come back into god's house we'll gain the portals come up hither into the perfect word god bless you amen [Applause] oh hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] [Applause] [Music] give me [Music] hey [Music] and
