[5:38] from the bottom of our hearts
[5:42] with the trail of expectancy
[5:45] that jesus
[5:46] is coming
[5:48] soon hallelujah
[5:50] amen so
[5:52] because he's coming soon
[5:55] let us hold fast
[5:58] to this message
[6:00] to the treasures and the riches of
[6:02] christ
[6:04] that we have received through the
[6:06] ministry
[6:08] of brother william marion branham
[6:11] the prophet of malachi 4.
[6:15] we have received this
[6:18] because of his sacrifice
[6:21] of bearing the reproach
[6:24] of the word of god
[6:26] father
[6:27] we we certainly thank god
[6:29] for this wonderful
[6:32] man of god servant of christ
[6:34] and that we are beneficiaries and
[6:37] recipients
[6:39] of this great deposit of truth
[6:43] placed in the storehouse
[6:45] of the holy spirit
[6:47] god's bank of heaven upon which we can
[6:51] draw
[6:52] and be blessed within our hearts and
[6:55] souls o praise god forevermore
[6:59] amen
[7:00] what do we have that we have to hold
[7:02] faster
[7:04] we have not just the bible
[7:08] not just the message
[7:11] but god has given us
[7:14] his on the unfailing reality
[7:17] of understanding the revelation
[7:21] of the word of god for our day and we
[7:23] are so thankful to god for it amen
[7:28] hallelujah while others
[7:31] are wandering
[7:34] and some are wondering
[7:37] why others are quibbling
[7:39] analyzing debating
[7:42] some
[7:43] are lowering standards changing
[7:46] standards
[7:47] changing the word
[7:49] denying
[7:51] the word
[7:53] i want to
[7:54] encourage you
[7:57] on this glorious evening
[7:59] to hold fast as he said till i come
[8:03] called to god's unchanging hand
[8:07] called to the
[8:09] revelation from the word hold to
[8:13] the rock
[8:14] beneath the rock
[8:17] that we
[8:18] might be stabilized
[8:20] that we might my friends just be made to
[8:24] a place where we have the true spiritual
[8:28] steadfastness and balance that is
[8:31] necessary and needed in this message
[8:35] that we don't go
[8:36] to
[8:37] the left or the right from formalism to
[8:41] fanaticism
[8:43] but that we go straight down the middle
[8:45] of the road
[8:47] of course we are fanatics because
[8:50] we are
[8:51] fanatics of the revelation of this word
[8:55] because we have been to that holy ghost
[8:58] attic of the little room
[9:00] and we have caught the revelation
[9:03] of this last prophet's message
[9:06] and it has set her soul of fire by the
[9:09] anointing of the holy spirit
[9:11] that's the reason why we're here tonight
[9:14] to give god glory and honor for this
[9:18] burning shining light
[9:20] of the word of god that shines and
[9:23] illuminates our pathways oh thanks be to
[9:27] god coming soon
[9:29] we know he's coming quickly
[9:32] amen
[9:34] and we know that
[9:35] because we know that we are now living
[9:39] in the end
[9:41] of the end times
[9:44] amen not only are we in the end times
[9:48] but we are in the ending of the end
[9:51] times hallelujah
[9:54] and that's why he says hold fast to what
[9:57] you have
[9:59] and let no man take thy crown
[10:03] hallelujah and i said what do we have
[10:06] what does the elect have
[10:09] they elect not only have they written
[10:13] word but they have the unwritten word
[10:17] not only do they have
[10:19] the intellectual understanding of
[10:22] reading the word of god passing the word
[10:24] of god analyzing the word of god
[10:27] debating the word of god and going into
[10:30] all kinds of partials
[10:34] you know divisions of the word of god
[10:37] but having the reality revealed to you
[10:40] until you are speechless
[10:43] you can not so profound
[10:47] yet so simple that you cannot even put
[10:51] it into
[10:53] human words
[10:55] or uh
[10:56] explanation
[10:58] it you can't speak it because it's not
[11:00] allowed and it cannot be
[11:03] for it must not and cannot be
[11:05] impersonated
[11:07] oh praise god if we could express all of
[11:11] it if we could put it into english terms
[11:14] or whatever language then the devil is
[11:19] so wise
[11:21] having thousands of years
[11:24] of wisdom above
[11:26] the human being
[11:28] without god
[11:30] oh my
[11:31] he would quickly be able to take that
[11:35] and turn it into his kind of
[11:38] so-called enlightenment and reality
[11:42] to deceive even millions more so god has
[11:47] to bring his people
[11:49] into the little room and there make
[11:53] known to him to them himself oh thank
[11:57] god forevermore so
[12:00] in this end time
[12:02] with earthquakes with fires with floods
[12:06] with all manner of trouble and strife
[12:09] and war
[12:10] amen that's when jesus comes that's when
[12:15] the prince of peace comes hallelujah and
[12:19] with his scrumming
[12:21] he's bringing a resurrection hallelujah
[12:25] he's bringing a rapture glory to god
[12:28] amen because you know there must be a
[12:32] rapture first for paul tells us in the
[12:35] bible we
[12:37] who are alive amen the they that are
[12:41] dead
[12:42] and are asleep
[12:44] will be raised up by the hand of god and
[12:48] we who are alive
[12:52] will be raptured
[12:54] while we are yet alive by god's divine
[12:57] design and process we shall be raptured
[13:02] into the very presence of almighty god
[13:06] amen praise god those who are in the
[13:09] dust will be raised up and those who are
[13:12] alive are waiting for his return for for
[13:16] his return will be caught up
[13:19] into the presence of the lord hallelujah
[13:23] and we are caught up the bible says be
[13:26] given crowns glory to god hallelujah
[13:31] amen why why where are we going to be
[13:34] given crowns because we are sons and
[13:38] daughters
[13:39] genuine sons of god and daughters of the
[13:43] living god
[13:45] not because we say so
[13:49] because he vindicates it so
[13:52] and he
[13:53] sanctifies it so
[13:56] he stamps his approval he puts a crown
[13:59] on our head he's given he's giving us a
[14:03] chariot ride to glory
[14:05] divine transportation
[14:08] then he gives us a crown upon our head
[14:10] all glory be to god hallelujah amen
[14:15] and makes us
[14:17] kings and priests
[14:20] unto god hallelujah that we may reign
[14:24] with him
[14:26] that we may rule with him
[14:29] in righteousness for the glory of god
[14:33] hallelujah that is the promise
[14:37] to all those who suffer with him

[14:46] the
[14:47] earthly shame
[14:49] in bearing his name and baptism and walk
[14:53] and talk and action in life we bear his
[14:57] name and because we suffered with him we
[15:01] shall reign with him hallelujah praise

[15:22] in the words of the bible those who
[15:25] endured
[15:26] patiently the word of his patience
[15:30] hallelujah knowing that god
[15:33] who is a just judge
[15:36] as abraham his servant asked one time
[15:39] shall not the judge of the earth do
[15:42] right
[15:43] oh praise god god promised to reward us
[15:47] and here he is his promise to his own o
[15:51] blessed be the name of the lord that be

[23:23] of the living god hallelujah and he is
[23:27] going to make the overcomer a pillar in
[23:31] the temple of
[23:34] of god
[23:35] what is a pillar
[23:37] a pillar is actually
[23:40] a part of the foundation
[23:43] part of the overall
[23:45] super
[23:46] structure hallelujah thank god we must
[23:50] believe we are a part of the super
[23:53] structure
[23:54] that we are a part of the foundation now
[23:58] that would be another topic but just to
[24:00] give you a glimpse
[24:02] what is the foundation of the pyramid
[24:05] what is the foundation the foundation is
[24:08] jesus christ himself being the
[24:10] foundation as the bible tells us our
[24:13] faith is not built on this
[24:16] sense shifting sands of man's opinion
[24:18] but our fate is based upon him on the
[24:22] unchanging unmovable word of god his own
[24:26] person just like he swore by himself to
[24:29] abraham
[24:30] now
[24:31] he comes and for makes us a part of that
[24:35] foundation and that foundation is
[24:38] himself jesus christ the word and we are
[24:42] a part of that foundation the word he is
[24:47] the word she is the word o glory be to
[24:51] god on high he who raised that body
[24:55] jesus from the dead hallelujah now is
[24:58] about to resurrect and rapture his pride
[25:01] from out of the graveyard of this earth
[25:04] back into glory into his divine presence
[25:08] hallelujah to him we give praise honor
[25:11] and glory here blessed be the name of
[25:14] the lord amen amen and that puts
[25:19] watch this
[25:21] the bible tells us
[25:24] the foundation is made up of jesus
[25:27] christ
[25:28] and the apostles but now he's saying
[25:32] that
[25:33] i'll make you pillars in the temple of
[25:36] my god
[25:38] and let me say this quoting directly
[25:41] from the prophet of malachi 4 5 william
[25:44] marian branham
[25:46] praise be to god
[25:49] that puts us
[25:52] puts the overcomer
[25:55] right in with them apostles and all them
[25:59] prophets that went before for it says so
[26:03] in ephesians 2
[26:05] 9 to 19 to 22.
[26:09] now therefore
[26:11] you are no more strangers and foreigners
[26:16] but fellow citizens
[26:18] with the saints
[26:20] and of the household of god and are
[26:25] built upon the foundation
[26:28] of the apostles and prophets you see up
[26:33] to that time it was the apostles and
[26:35] prophets but now
[26:38] he is
[26:39] showing us our identification
[26:42] and showing us where we come from where
[26:44] we're going back to
[26:46] as part of the original superstructure
[26:50] in the foundation
[26:52] as pillars of the temple of my god in
[26:57] whom all the buildings fitly framed
[26:59] together grew it unto a holy temple
[27:03] in the lord in whom you also are builded
[27:08] together
[27:10] for a habitation of god for a temple for
[27:15] a habitation a house of god
[27:19] through the spirit hallelujah praise be
[27:22] to god amen
[27:25] of course a pillar speaks of strength
[27:29] it speaks
[27:31] of stability
[27:33] immovability
[27:35] that is why
[27:36] even in foreign lands where i might have
[27:39] toured even the all banks the old
[27:42] temples that they built always had
[27:46] sure
[27:47] mighty pillars
[27:49] in the front of it are all around it
[27:53] and this is a symbol
[27:56] even in our modern times
[27:58] certain banks will always put large
[28:01] pillars in front
[28:03] and subliminally it's really speaking to
[28:06] the customers we have stability
[28:10] we
[28:11] have immovability
[28:14] we have the financial
[28:16] strength what god is saying
[28:19] by them seeing you they're going to know
[28:22] i have the power i have the glory i have
[28:25] the strength i have your mobility amen
[28:28] you are now foundations pillars in the
[28:32] temple of my god hallelujah amen god is
[28:37] trying to tell the on overcomer
[28:40] you are not going to be
[28:43] like the buildings
[28:45] that were back
[28:46] in the age of philadelphia at that time
[28:50] for philadelphia
[28:52] was
[28:54] an area that was
[28:56] prone to frequent earthquakes
[29:00] buildings would
[29:01] demolish
[29:03] fall to the ground
[29:06] and come to nothing
[29:08] amen
[29:09] but oh
[29:11] thank god
[29:13] we are supporting pillars
[29:16] of the rest of the world for the world
[29:20] has not changed
[29:22] and by our walk our talk our lives
[29:25] reproving the
[29:27] all the immutability the unchanging
[29:30] power of the unchanging god
[29:32] in every age no matter how wicked the
[29:36] age becomes god can always raise up a
[29:39] people raise up a standard that still
[29:42] proves that his word is right and
[29:45] they'll keep in the midst of any storm
[29:47] and hold to his unchanging hand blessed
[29:51] be the name of the lord do you know in
[29:54] solomon's temple
[29:56] and many wise men of earth will
[29:58] understand this
[30:01] in solomon's temple
[30:03] and our bible tells us
[30:05] that it had two main supporting pillars
[30:09] there might have been others but
[30:11] speaking of two main pillars and the
[30:14] bible takes the time to mention these
[30:17] two main pillars
[30:19] and even gave them names
[30:22] one pillar was called boaz
[30:26] another pillar was called
[30:29] jack in
[30:30] hallelujah
[30:32] boyz meaning strength
[30:36] and jacking
[30:37] meaning
[30:38] established oh praise god forevermore
[30:43] thanks be to god that god will give us
[30:47] strength
[30:48] and would establish us
[30:51] firmly within the word of god and to
[30:56] recognize our position in the body
[31:00] as
[31:01] foundation's pillars hallelujah but make
[31:06] no mistake about it
[31:08] the foundation stone and the capstone
[31:11] are the same stone praise god hallelujah
[31:15] you are part to him and he is part of
[31:18] you and together we are one glory to god
[31:22] hallelujah everything has to pass
[31:25] through the door
[31:28] and the door is jesus
[31:30] and jesus is a part of that body or of
[31:34] that temple he is the temple he is the
[31:38] door he is the everything and we are a
[31:41] part of him hallelujah and when god puts
[31:44] a man or a woman
[31:47] in the temple
[31:49] as a pillar and makes him or her
[31:52] a part of that foundation group
[31:56] what is he doing
[31:58] and how is he doing it he is doing it by
[32:01] giving him or her that individual
[32:05] the revelation of the word himself a
[32:10] revelation of the word himself
[32:14] because that is exactly what the
[32:17] apostles and the prophets had amen
[32:22] matthew 16
[32:24] 17 oh he's in the word and he stands in
[32:28] the word and we can't get him out of the
[32:31] word christ is revealed in his own word
[32:35] and he stands behind the lattice work of
[32:38] his word
[32:40] amen
[32:41] looking out at you and many try to peer
[32:44] in and all they can see is a form and
[32:47] the shape but they're still presuming
[32:49] and guessing and they can even say oh
[32:52] it's jesus but they don't have a clear
[32:56] revelation of who he is but i'm so
[33:00] thankful
[33:01] god in the shadows is watching over his
[33:05] own
[33:06] not one will fall to the ground not one
[33:10] given to him and his hands will fail or
[33:13] praise god but every one that was given
[33:16] to him is going back with him right into
[33:19] glory no matter what you think of
[33:22] yourself no matter how you feel about
[33:25] yourself no matter if you feel you're
[33:27] unworthy oh thank god paul said even if
[33:32] your own heart condemns you god is
[33:35] greater than your heart hallelujah and
[33:38] this word revealed to you makes you
[33:42] become firm and stable recognizing that
[33:45] you're a pillar in the temple of your
[33:48] god who is he that overcome it
[33:53] who is he that overcome it
[33:55] he that is a part of jesus christ
[33:58] he that is a part of the revealed word
[34:01] for jesus christ himself is the
[34:04] overcomer how can we overcome
[34:07] and the answer is by him who has already
[34:11] overcome greater is he that is in you
[34:14] than he that is in the world glory to
[34:16] god hallelujah so we are a part of him
[34:19] that's how we overcome oh praise god
[34:23] amen jesus is the christ
[34:27] hallelujah alpha and omega
[34:31] amen hallelujah he that believeth that
[34:34] jesus is the christ not a christ but the
[34:39] christ there's only one christ jesus one
[34:43] person one anointed one
[34:46] hallelujah and that is why
[34:49] we baptize in no other name
[34:53] but in the name of jesus christ
[34:57] for we know father is not a name son is
[35:00] not a name holy spirit or holy ghost is
[35:04] not a name they are titles the name is
[35:08] jesus christ hallelujah and be baptized

[52:10] but we know it's illustrious it's
[52:12] wonderful oh my hey praise god
[52:17] hallelujah it would have to be a
[52:19] revelation of the spirit given to us
[52:22] individually and conclusively
[52:24] and none would dare that none will dare
[52:27] to deny
[52:30] that that revelation is in you on you
[52:33] through you oh praise god all over you
[52:37] praise his wonderful name and no doubt
[52:40] he will leave that revelation to the day
[52:44] when he desires to give forth his name
[52:48] suffice it to know hallelujah it'll be a
[52:52] wonderful time for you
[52:54] and a wonderful time for me
[52:57] he that had an heir to hear
[53:01] let him hear what the spirit said or is
[53:04] saying
[53:06] to the churches
[53:08] o praise god every age
[53:11] ends with the same warning
[53:14] for in every age
[53:17] there is an elected few
[53:20] that were given heirs given eyes
[53:24] given their supernatural ability
[53:27] to receive
[53:29] and understand the word of god
[53:32] hallelujah
[53:33] or praise god and so god is crying out
[53:38] to all of the church
[53:40] to listen to his voice
[53:42] yet he knows only a few are going to
[53:45] hear and understand and receive it but
[53:48] he still cries out whosoever will
