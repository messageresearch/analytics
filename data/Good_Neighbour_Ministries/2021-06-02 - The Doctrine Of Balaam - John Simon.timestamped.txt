[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] hi
[0:16] it's wednesday night and it's
[0:19] great to be again here with you
[0:23] thanking god that i can speak to you
[0:26] from
[0:27] heavenly places in christ
[0:31] preaching from on board the good ship
[0:35] grace may the holy spirit
[0:40] give you the heart and mind
[0:44] to receive the word of god and be
[0:47] built up and to be made steadfast
[0:52] in christ as we go along
[0:57] this great journey from earth to glory
[1:01] preaching the word in this fashion
[1:04] which is not very much in
[1:08] the uh regular denominational or normal
[1:12] style
[1:13] expected but just plain
[1:16] food and as it was in the wilderness
[1:21] many may become tired
[1:24] of the manna which was just plain
[1:28] simple bread and water
[1:32] and that's all they had in their
[1:35] journey from earth to glory
[1:39] so that is why i'm expressing this
[1:44] don't become tired
[1:48] in eating the bread of life
[1:51] and drinking the refreshing waters
[1:55] flowing from the fountain of god
[1:58] praise god god has deliberately set it
[2:02] so
[2:04] and proving his word may the great holy
[2:07] spirit
[2:08] apply this text and this scripture
[2:12] to our hearts for where i ask it in the
[2:16] name of jesus christ
[2:19] our topic for tonight
[2:23] is the doctrine of
[2:26] balaam what did balaam
[2:30] teach the children of israel
[2:34] my friends that is what we want to speak
[2:36] about
[2:37] and our scripture is found in revelation
[2:41] chapter 2 verse
[2:44] 14 god speaking to the
[2:48] uh pergamos church age
[2:52] and warning them in these words
[2:58] but i have a few things against thee
[3:04] because thou has there them
[3:08] that hold the doctrine
[3:11] of balaam
[3:14] who taught balak to cast
[3:18] a stumbling block before the children of
[3:21] israel
[3:24] to eat things sacrificed
[3:27] onto idols and
[3:30] to commit fornication
[3:34] god bless the reading of his word
[3:38] gracious father into your hands we
[3:42] commit
[3:43] our spirit and we pray
[3:47] that you will now lord descend upon us
[3:52] tonight take glory and honor
[3:56] as we surrender all to jesus
[3:59] all to him lord god take us
[4:03] for your glory in jesus name we ask it
[4:08] amen the
[4:11] doctrine of balaam
[4:16] first of all my friends
[4:19] balaam was teaching
[4:22] the children of israel
[4:26] by not just by words only
[4:30] but by his actions as you know
[4:34] parents consciously and
[4:37] unconsciously teach their children
[4:41] by action and
[4:45] by talk or by teaching
[4:49] so was it with balaam by
[4:52] both word and by action
[4:56] every preacher the same thing by word
[4:59] by action and the bible
[5:03] tells us in our text quickly
[5:08] that balaam taught or balaam's teaching
[5:12] was
[5:13] taught king balak
[5:17] how to be a stumbling block how to get
[5:20] in the way
[5:21] and to block the churn of israel
[5:25] and secondly he taught
[5:28] them to eat things sacrificed
[5:32] onto idols
[5:35] and thirdly he taught them
[5:40] how to commit fornication
[5:43] now let us consider tonight the
[5:46] characteristics of balaamism
[5:50] the doctrine of balaamism
[5:53] and let us therefore see what
[5:57] lessons we can learn
[6:00] from observing
[6:04] balaam and his doctrine
[6:10] you can't have a nicolithian church
[6:13] without having balaamism
[6:17] mixed into it because the moment you
[6:21] take away the spirit of god
[6:23] and the word of god as a means of
[6:27] worship from amongst the people
[6:30] immediately balaamism sets in
[6:34] because you know worship real
[6:37] true worship is not just
[6:41] having a lot of spirit in the church
[6:45] or it's not having just a lot of bible
[6:49] teaching and truth
[6:51] in the church because jesus said there
[6:54] ought to be
[6:55] that balance the true worshipers
[6:59] will worship me in spirit
[7:04] and in the truth now you may have all
[7:07] the spirit you like
[7:08] signs wonders miracles healing all kinds
[7:11] of prosperity
[7:13] all kinds of shouting jumping
[7:14] hallelujahs praise god and everything
[7:17] else
[7:18] but you miss the truth
[7:22] of the doctrine of one god water baptism
[7:24] in jesus name serpent seed
[7:27] and so on you miss the messenger
[7:31] you miss the seven stars you
[7:34] miss the seven spears of god and the
[7:37] blasting of the seven thunders of the
[7:39] holy spirit
[7:41] and when you miss that it doesn't matter
[7:44] how much your church is spirited
[7:48] or a life or with music and drums and
[7:52] singing
[7:53] and famous singers and preachers coming
[7:57] in
[7:57] wonderful but if the truth is
[8:00] not there my friends you've missed it
[8:05] a myth is as good as a mile says the
[8:08] british
[8:09] and indeed it is oh friends
[8:13] think of it jesus i repeat said
[8:17] they that the true worshipers
[8:21] will worship me in spirit
[8:25] and then truth we have a lot of people
[8:28] worshiping in spirit
[8:29] then we have a lot of people even those
[8:32] that even some that believe this message
[8:35] have a lot of truth
[8:37] but they the moment you get emotional
[8:41] and begin to praise god and shout
[8:43] they want to brand you as a pentecostal
[8:47] not realizing that we ought to be
[8:50] worshipping
[8:51] in spirit and in the truth praise god
[8:55] we weren't called to be with truth only
[8:58] or with spirit only but when the spark
[9:02] the fire
[9:03] hits the gasoline room then you hear
[9:08] songs coming out of it and when the holy
[9:10] spirit
[9:11] comes upon the word oh my when the
[9:14] spirit quickens the word brother sister
[9:17] then it comes alive in the hearts
[9:21] and in the mind of every believer praise
[9:24] god
[9:25] and wherever there is no real
[9:28] true worship satan
[9:32] will of course insert
[9:36] or give you a substitute form or worship
[9:40] that may satisfy your flesh
[9:44] or a form of worship that is
[9:47] satisfactory
[9:48] to your mind in other words you'll make
[9:50] it so
[9:51] high that that those that are mentally
[9:54] inclined
[9:55] will cause them to feel sophisticated
[9:58] and to feel intellectual dignified
[10:02] with that form of worship because he has
[10:05] created that atmosphere
[10:08] and in the next realm if you love
[10:11] a lot of that emotional outburst and
[10:15] all of the moving of the spirit he'll
[10:17] let you have that too
[10:19] as long as you miss the truth
[10:23] so in other words if you are still
[10:24] teaching trinity doctrine
[10:26] if you're still teaching uh uh what a
[10:29] baptism
[10:30] in father son and holy ghost if you are
[10:33] teaching that eve at an apple
[10:35] if you are teaching that women can get
[10:38] in the pulpit and jump around and be
[10:40] preachers
[10:41] if you are still teaching things of that
[10:44] matter and i haven't gone down into all
[10:47] of that
[10:47] but to just show you if one is teaching
[10:50] all those things and missing the basic
[10:54] truth hero israel
[10:57] the lord thy god is one lord
[11:01] one god one god hallelujah
[11:05] and if they miss that it doesn't matter
[11:07] what else they're teaching
[11:09] they're off of the word of god and they
[11:12] have a substitute
[11:14] form of worship the bible calls it
[11:17] balaamism balaamism
[11:21] for they have a form of worship
[11:24] amen see but jesus is talking about
[11:28] true worship where the worshipers
[11:31] worship him in spirit and with
[11:35] revelation of the truth
[11:38] now if we're going to understand fully
[11:40] this doctrine of balaam
[11:43] it is understandable and obvious
[11:46] that we have to go back and look at the
[11:50] beginning of it
[11:51] all in the old testament
[11:55] then apply it to the third age
[12:00] this pergamos and then
[12:04] bring it down to our time
[12:07] this is what we need to do this story
[12:11] is found in numbers chapters
[12:14] 30 22 through 25
[12:18] you may go and read it at your leisure
[12:23] praise god now we know israel
[12:26] were the chosen people of god in that
[12:29] day
[12:30] similar to when god actually chose
[12:34] and used the pentecostals for
[12:38] his purpose and for his glory
[12:42] for these people had taken
[12:45] refuge under the
[12:49] blood the shed blood of animals
[12:52] which was a type of christ hallelujah
[12:56] these were also having in a symbol
[13:01] what a baptism in the red sea
[13:05] amen and came out of the waters of the
[13:10] red sea
[13:11] singing shouting praising god
[13:14] hallelujah and giving him glory and the
[13:18] bible
[13:18] tells us that miriam moses
[13:22] sister picked up a tambourine and began
[13:25] to play it
[13:26] and begin to dance in the spirit and to
[13:29] sing
[13:30] and appraise the name of the living god
[13:33] hallelujah
[13:35] miriam the prophetess now make no
[13:39] mistake about this
[13:41] not miriam the preacher not miriam the
[13:44] missionary
[13:46] not miriam the deaconess not
[13:49] miriam of anything of that nature
[13:52] but miriam who was a woman
[13:56] that had a gift of prophecy
[14:00] and that's what she had in
[14:03] her life amen now
[14:07] my friends she praise god
[14:10] and give him glory for total deliverance
[14:14] and so ought we to give glory and praise
[14:17] to god
[14:18] for our total deliverance from that
[14:22] land of bondage into the freedom
[14:26] that we now enjoy in the lord and savior
[14:30] jesus christ well
[14:34] israel was on her journey
[14:38] and she came to the land of moab
[14:43] now moab if you uh should uh
[14:46] get some knowledge of who moab was
[14:51] moab was the son
[14:55] of lot he was the son of lot
[15:00] but listen to this by incest
[15:04] with one of his daughters so
[15:07] muab was a relative
[15:12] relative to israel
[15:15] who came of course from abraham
[15:20] so here we see two relations
[15:24] like you have the truth we have the
[15:27] revelation
[15:28] but yet there are many out there
[15:32] calling themselves by various christian
[15:34] names
[15:36] and we may be we are
[15:39] relatives but being
[15:42] relatives doesn't mean that you
[15:45] are right on with the truth of the word
[15:49] of god
[15:50] let me continue here now you must
[15:54] understand it's not that the moabites
[15:58] not that the denominationalists are
[16:02] ungodly or that they
[16:05] don't know the bible or they don't know
[16:08] the word
[16:10] but moab knew the word
[16:14] just as much as israel did
[16:17] they knew the word but that's one thing
[16:20] to know the word
[16:21] is another thing to have a revelation of
[16:24] that same
[16:25] word amen
[16:29] now my friends one know the word
[16:33] and live by the word but moab
[16:36] knew the word but did not live
[16:40] by the word having no clear
[16:43] revelation of it now israel and their
[16:47] journey
[16:48] came to the borders of the land of moab
[16:52] whose king was called balak
[16:57] and israel asked the moabites
[17:01] to allow them to pass through their
[17:04] country and go out of it on the other
[17:08] side
[17:09] and they would pay them for any
[17:13] drink or food
[17:16] or water that they had to use
[17:20] they would pay them for it
[17:24] but balak king of the moabites
[17:27] got all worked up and excited
[17:31] you see whenever there's a move of god
[17:34] uh
[17:34] these bishops superintendents
[17:37] whatever else they get very worked up
[17:42] because here is israel
[17:45] passing through their land with signs
[17:48] wonders and miracles
[17:50] with the pillar of fire the power of god
[17:52] the holy spirit
[17:54] revealing the word and his people are
[17:57] going to see
[17:58] that and compare it with what
[18:01] he has and he realized this
[18:05] is pretty risky to have people like that
[18:08] with
[18:09] joy in their hearts shining lights upon
[18:12] their
[18:12] faces and the joy the love of
[18:15] god within their being many of them
[18:18] healed saved delivered their lives
[18:22] changed forever never can be the same
[18:25] again
[18:26] but transformed by the power and the
[18:29] presence
[18:30] of almighty god hallelujah amen
[18:33] and he got uh he got worked up because
[18:36] it's kind of risky because if
[18:40] those people continue worshiping like
[18:42] that if they continue having god
[18:44] moving like that he might lose some
[18:47] membership
[18:49] he might lose some of his best people
[18:52] so that was a big risk for them to pass
[18:56] through
[18:57] so he absolutely refused
[19:00] even though he was a relative even
[19:03] though he was claiming the name of
[19:05] uh let me say the number nationalist
[19:07] claiming the name of christ
[19:09] and like balak they'll do everything in
[19:13] their power
[19:14] to obstruct whatever we are trying to do
[19:17] for the glory of god oh my
[19:21] and so he had a great fear
[19:25] of this little group of people
[19:28] amen hallelujah you look and see those
[19:31] great big organizations out there
[19:34] great big man out there giants out there
[19:38] but when they look at this little
[19:41] message
[19:42] group when they look at this thing
[19:45] called the message of the hour voice of
[19:49] god in his last days they shake and
[19:53] tremble
[19:53] up in their boots even though they would
[19:56] not
[19:56] outwardly publicly admit it but they
[20:00] know what they are hearing is thus saith
[20:03] the lord
[20:04] they know what they are hearing is the
[20:07] truth
[20:07] from the word of god from the many
[20:10] voices of the many ministers anointed
[20:13] with the holy spirit
[20:14] across the land across the world the
[20:18] earth is shaking god said i'll shake the
[20:20] heavens
[20:21] and i'll shake the earth one more time
[20:24] amen
[20:25] the holy spirit is riding true upon this
[20:28] word for this day for this time and in
[20:31] this
[20:32] hour brother sister and it's a big risk
[20:35] to them
[20:36] to just allow you to go on the way
[20:39] you're going so prepared
[20:41] because this the devil will use them
[20:44] to attack you in every possible way
[20:48] and who are they going to use how's the
[20:51] devil going to attack you
[20:54] the very way he attacked jesus he did
[20:57] not find
[20:57] bandits he did not find robbers by the
[21:01] roadside
[21:02] oh no but he found my friends
[21:06] he found preachers he had found
[21:10] anointed man he found
[21:14] men that are preaching the same bible
[21:18] from the bible that you were preaching
[21:20] from
[21:21] and they would surrender to him
[21:26] by hiring them preachers for hire
[21:30] we're living in this day where everybody
[21:33] is a preacher
[21:35] all of a sudden they get there they
[21:36] claim god called them
[21:39] oh all of a sudden the church called
[21:41] them
[21:42] all of a sudden the bishop called them
[21:45] their mother their father somebody
[21:47] called them
[21:49] or they have a desire a greed
[21:52] or lust for money and gold so they
[21:56] desire
[21:57] decide to become a preacher and it
[22:00] becomes like a
[22:01] more like a tradition or like
[22:04] some other form of work
[22:08] or job that they go to they study for it
[22:11] they they receive degrees for it
[22:14] they receive all kinds of accommodations
[22:17] for it
[22:18] and they believe that gives them their
[22:20] credibility and authority
[22:22] to preach the word of god when it
[22:25] is not so in the bible god said i'm the
[22:29] one who ordained you
[22:30] before the foundation of the world god
[22:34] ordained you
[22:35] god calls you god trains you god puts
[22:38] his spirit
[22:39] in you and uses you praise god
[22:43] hallelujah amen so moab went out
[22:48] to find a prophet he can hire
[22:51] i and this is a day where there's a lot
[22:54] of preachers for hire
[22:56] preach for pay preach for filthy luca
[23:01] preach for offerings that they can
[23:04] preach about prosperity
[23:07] about how you give them money
[23:11] they're not preaching about telling you
[23:13] how you can prosper and you can get
[23:16] money but they'll
[23:17] tell you that if you give them then
[23:19] you'll get money
[23:20] now my friends this kind of false
[23:24] doctrine and false prosperity teaching
[23:27] is absolutely against the word of god
[23:31] there is a genuine prosperity there is a
[23:33] genuine success
[23:35] there's a genuine blessing as god told
[23:37] joshua
[23:38] i will give you good success
[23:41] you see there's the true and the false
[23:44] oh
[23:44] my that's not my subject today
[23:48] but they hired a prophet just like they
[23:51] can hire them today
[23:53] you can hire uh experts to give witness
[23:56] in the court
[23:58] telling lies one will tell say this and
[24:00] the other one is an expert also
[24:03] and he'll be totally opposite you you
[24:05] can hire
[24:06] scientists one will tell you this the
[24:09] other that hire lawyers one will tell
[24:10] you this you have to tell you
[24:12] depending on how you pay them and if you
[24:15] paid enough they'll say anything you
[24:17] want
[24:18] oh my god have mercy but a real
[24:21] man of god i don't care they'll eat dry
[24:24] bread they'll walk my friends if it's
[24:27] necessary with rags they'll do with
[24:30] nothing all they want is so oh honor
[24:33] their
[24:33] master of their lord and to preach the
[24:36] truth from the word of god
[24:38] even it will skin the height off of you
[24:40] amen
[24:41] if they have to pull every feather out
[24:43] to your nest and pick you clean as
[24:46] a christmas turkey oh praise god now
[24:49] preach that word and clean up your life
[24:51] if you're willing and ready to accept
[24:54] the word of god
[24:55] for your day and for your time amen
[24:58] hallelujah
[25:00] and so he tempted balaam
[25:04] and bought him out or hired him he hired
[25:08] him
[25:08] one with money and secondly
[25:12] he tempted and hired him with the
[25:17] the temptation of honor that you're
[25:20] going to get
[25:20] glory you're going to be the man
[25:25] that did this or did that
[25:28] and i can connect you
[25:31] to such and such powerful person in the
[25:34] political realms
[25:36] oh and that that uh
[25:39] my friends encourage balaam
[25:43] to a condition of pride where he would
[25:47] be able
[25:48] to realize he can be a big man a great
[25:51] man
[25:52] a man of renown and his names would
[25:56] be on the paper he'll be in the
[25:57] spotlight
[25:59] and he'll be able to pray with the with
[26:02] the president he'll be able to go
[26:04] and speak to the minister of this or the
[26:07] minister of that
[26:08] oh my friend and so that great
[26:12] lust was upon him to
[26:15] take part in political affairs
[26:19] and become a great person oh
[26:22] my friends hallelujah amen
[26:26] he wanted to he wanted
[26:30] balaam to go and curse the church of
[26:32] israel
[26:35] but balaam realized that he couldn't
[26:38] crush them himself
[26:40] he had to have god do it
[26:44] so therefore he had to go
[26:47] pray to get god's permission
[26:50] to be able to do it all my friends
[26:54] just like a lot of the balance and the
[26:57] nike legends we have today
[27:00] they still got to go back to god
[27:03] amen they want to curse everyone
[27:07] that won't go on their way or believe
[27:11] their way or see things the way
[27:14] they see it if you are different
[27:17] or you differ from them they're so angry
[27:20] with you they're ready to
[27:22] curse you they're ready to call you all
[27:25] mandarin names and everything else but
[27:28] my friends
[27:29] that's when you call to god's unchanging
[27:33] hand
[27:34] amen hold to him who will not leave you
[27:37] praise god amen he said i'll never leave
[27:41] you
[27:41] i'll never forsake you oh praise god
[27:45] amen so balaam asked god's permission to
[27:49] go
[27:51] amen just think of just the thought
[27:54] of asking god's permission to go and
[27:57] pray a prayer
[27:58] to put a curse on somebody that is not
[28:01] even in the scripture
[28:04] and here it is my friends balaam
[28:07] prayed for god's permission
[28:11] to go curse israel and god turned him
[28:14] down what else did he expect
[28:16] but you know what he had the lust for
[28:19] gold and money and glory
[28:21] and he kept coming back and coming back
[28:25] and bothering god and coming back to god
[28:28] and so all at once
[28:32] god had enough of it and he said okay
[28:35] balaam
[28:36] even if i tell you i told you already
[28:38] don't go the first time should have been
[28:40] enough
[28:40] i told you don't go but it's in your
[28:43] heart to go
[28:44] so i'm not going to stop you it's still
[28:47] in your heart
[28:48] to go down there and to do that so go
[28:50] ahead
[28:51] go ahead do it and that saw all his
[28:54] crookedness
[28:56] all of his perversity and perversion
[29:00] and told him he can go and ride away
[29:05] balaam saddle up his donkey oh praise
[29:09] god
[29:09] here is the prophet now excited
[29:13] i i got permission from god to go
[29:16] but what he did not realize is that he
[29:20] had only god's
[29:21] permissive will that wasn't god's
[29:24] perfect
[29:25] will god just said oh since you're doing
[29:27] that you're coming back i already told
[29:29] you no
[29:30] it's in the word telling you no and the
[29:32] bible tells you no
[29:33] but yet you're coming back to me and
[29:35] asking because you want me to answer
[29:38] according
[29:39] to your desire in your heart so if
[29:42] you're desiring your heart
[29:43] you think is greater than i am go ahead
[29:46] follow the desire of your heart
[29:48] and that's what god allow him to walk in
[29:51] his permissive will
[29:52] now you remember paul speaking of the
[29:54] good will of god
[29:56] amen he speaks about
[30:00] the perfect or again
[30:03] the acceptable will of god and then the
[30:06] perfect will of god
[30:08] these like the tree wills of god
[30:12] three stages of god's will
[30:16] you may be looking good to your eyes but
[30:19] it's not god's will
[30:21] no there again ah
[30:24] oh it this thing may be perfect
[30:27] everybody else may say this is perfect
[30:31] this is beautiful oh a million
[30:34] people's opinions can't be wrong but my
[30:37] friends we don't live by people's
[30:39] opinions we
[30:40] live by the word of god the voice of god
[30:43] the acceptable will god's perfect
[30:47] will to walk in the perfect will
[30:51] perfect word and the revelation
[30:54] of this day and so
[30:58] quickly balaam saddled his donkey
[31:02] and began to ride that donkey away
[31:06] to go to fulfill his work
[31:09] that bedham had asked him to do that's
[31:12] like a lot of
[31:13] of these preachers a lot of these
[31:17] superintendents they
[31:20] ride on the backs of their
[31:23] membership write them
[31:26] to accomplish their goals
[31:31] even if balaam had gone back to god 20
[31:34] times
[31:34] more god would still tell him no
[31:38] but he wanted to go anyway so god says
[31:41] okay
[31:42] go ahead and balaam is very much
[31:45] like a lot of people a day the bible
[31:48] tells you clearly there is one god
[31:50] oh but my church teaches tree but i
[31:53] believe
[31:53] in this holy blessed trinity you can
[31:56] bless it
[31:57] all you want you can bless blessed
[31:59] trinity holy trinity immaculate
[32:02] trinity whatever you want to call it but
[32:04] the word of god
[32:06] says there is only one god
[32:09] and his name is jehovah in the old
[32:12] testament
[32:13] which is the same jesus christ of the
[32:16] new testament
[32:17] the name jesus actually means jehovah
[32:21] who has become our savior that jehovah
[32:25] of the old testament
[32:27] came and died upon calvary's cross
[32:29] physically
[32:31] that he might become our savior praise
[32:34] be to god
[32:35] hallelujah you tell them and
[32:38] show them from the word of god
[32:42] and it doesn't take even a revelation to
[32:45] clearly see from the bible
[32:49] that baptism ought not to be in the
[32:51] titles of the
[32:53] person but in the name of the person
[32:56] the name of the person who
[33:00] is father son and
[33:03] holy spirit and the name of that person
[33:07] who is father son and holy spirit the
[33:11] same person
[33:12] not three persons when peter
[33:15] who is considered to be the first pope
[33:19] was us which we know he was never a pope
[33:22] but he was asked in acts chapter 2 verse
[33:25] 38
[33:26] men and brethren what shall we do to be
[33:29] saved
[33:30] repent be baptized in what name
[33:33] he knew the name of that person who
[33:36] is father son and holy ghost in the
[33:39] name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[33:43] and again 4 12 he says for there
[33:46] is no other name given unto heaven
[33:48] whereby we must be saved
[33:50] but the name of jesus christ i believe
[33:53] he knew what he was speaking of
[33:55] because his words words have stood the
[33:58] test of time
[33:59] and they are inscribed in our bible
[34:02] here it is my friends god
[34:07] telling us clearly there are people
[34:11] with the spirit of balaam and the
[34:13] teaching
[34:14] of balaam in our day and in our time
[34:18] still holding to truths
[34:22] or scriptures or thoughts that are
[34:25] not in not in the taught by the word of
[34:28] god
[34:29] but taught by the spirit of balaam
[34:32] the oh my holding to trinitarian
[34:35] doctrines
[34:37] holding to water baptisms and titles
[34:41] my friends amen and
[34:44] god would still send his spirit upon
[34:46] them
[34:48] just like he did upon balaam they don't
[34:51] realize the scripture tells us in romans
[34:54] for god so loved the world he sends his
[34:57] reign on the just and on the unjust
[35:02] on the weed and on the width
[35:07] the range is false god is impartial
[35:10] but the seed will reveal
[35:14] what the plant really is the nature
[35:17] of that plant will be exposed
[35:20] by the falling of the rain
[35:23] upon that life here it is
[35:27] they're perfect belamites today
[35:30] that i have taken in and are taking in
[35:34] the doctrine of balaam
[35:37] amen oh my you tell them about it they
[35:41] don't want to hear
[35:42] go ahead go ahead believe that way if
[35:45] you want to believe that way
[35:47] you'll see the end of it amen and many
[35:50] of them will be saying oh
[35:52] god is blessing us look at us look at
[35:55] our church look at our this look at
[35:57] all of that look at our bible schools
[35:59] look at our seminaries
[36:00] look at our cathedral god is blessing us
[36:04] amen amen see that's how they look at it
[36:08] it must be all right if god is blessing
[36:11] us amen and sometimes you will have to
[36:14] say to them i know
[36:15] god bless you i don't deny it but it's
[36:18] the same
[36:20] organizational root
[36:23] that balaam took that many are choosing
[36:27] to take that same organizational rule
[36:33] my friends that route was open to me
[36:36] open to me by the assemblies of god open
[36:40] to me
[36:40] by the seventh day adventist i was
[36:44] invited by the ame
[36:46] zion invited by look i won't name all of
[36:50] them
[36:50] numbers of them the methodists my
[36:53] mother's uh cousin and
[36:56] was the bishop of the
[37:00] uh methodist church and just wanted me
[37:03] to go in that light
[37:04] but it doesn't go by that doesn't go by
[37:08] men taking positions offering you
[37:11] parishes with five six churches
[37:13] you're going to be over this great big
[37:16] area and whatever
[37:16] no you are all you ready to surrender
[37:20] your life to jesus christ hallelujah
[37:22] and let him take divine control amen
[37:26] and so i have and so you should
[37:29] and everyone should do that the same way
[37:32] amen praise god balaam what my friends
[37:36] the pathway
[37:38] that balaam took was in defiance to
[37:41] god's word
[37:42] because he was knowingly preaching
[37:46] and promoting false teaching
[37:50] for profit and for
[37:53] pay oh god have
[37:56] mercy isn't that the same thing being
[37:59] repeated in this day
[38:01] and in this hour amen so
[38:05] here comes balaam riding wildly
[38:09] down the road oh my riding on his donkey
[38:14] riding on that church member their
[38:16] support
[38:17] is riding on them because remember their
[38:20] support
[38:20] and so he's riding on that until the
[38:23] angel
[38:24] stood in his way oh my
[38:27] and my friends in our day another angel
[38:30] has come
[38:32] another messenger from god has come
[38:36] and the messenger and the messenger won
[38:40] and when they come in contact with this
[38:43] message
[38:44] that's the angel with the sharp shining
[38:46] sword
[38:48] waiting for them to make their decision
[38:51] life or death christ or chaos amen
[38:54] or jesus or judgment my god and judgment
[38:58] begins at the house of god
[39:00] judgment begins with your attitude to
[39:04] the word
[39:04] of god and promise of god for this
[39:08] age and for this time and so
[39:11] that prophet that preacher that bishop
[39:15] that overseer oh friend
[39:18] there it is that president that
[39:22] chairman of the presbyters
[39:25] oh that general over
[39:28] shepherd all all of that they were
[39:31] so blinded by spiritual
[39:35] things and by their all the spiritual
[39:39] teachings they had and by their thought
[39:42] of human glory
[39:46] gold and honor that they
[39:50] lost sight of the truth of the word
[39:53] of the living god money
[39:58] the mighty dollar was right in front
[40:00] their eyes
[40:02] they could not even see the messenger
[40:06] standing in front of them to arrest them
[40:09] they could not see the angel standing
[40:12] before them
[40:13] oh but even though they did not see it
[40:17] the members of their church see it oh my
[40:21] i tell you the members of that church
[40:23] see the word
[40:25] and they recognize the word and they
[40:27] swerve this way and they swerve that way
[40:29] and the next thing you know uh uh
[40:31] balaam's
[40:32] leg got squashed against a rock he got
[40:35] mad at the donkey and began to beat the
[40:38] donkey
[40:39] and everything else and that that god
[40:42] that donkey was no hybrid the donkey was
[40:46] my friend a pure bread donkey amen
[40:49] he said what do you mean brother simon
[40:51] well a
[40:52] mule is a mixture of across
[40:56] with horse and donkey but a
[41:00] donkey is a created thing that has been
[41:03] original
[41:04] through all the ages anything that is
[41:07] hybrid can not reproduce itself
[41:12] amen but the original seed
[41:16] can wrap your truce itself and saw a
[41:19] donkey
[41:20] is redeemable amen but the mew
[41:23] can't be redeemed oh we'll talk about
[41:27] that another time
[41:28] but here a simple member of the church
[41:32] could see the word and the overseer the
[41:35] bishop the preacher the prostate the
[41:37] president
[41:38] whatever the chairman can't see the word
[41:41] of god
[41:42] miss the truth of god's word that he
[41:46] might
[41:47] attain gold and glory
[41:50] and receive the honors of this world
[41:54] so the donkey asked balaam didn't i
[41:56] carry you faithfully for so many years
[41:59] and now you're beating me and you want
[42:02] to kill me
[42:03] and everything else my god a talking
[42:06] donkey
[42:06] god anoint the donkey to talk and
[42:09] sometimes god anoint the member
[42:12] with the word that the blinded priest
[42:15] and
[42:16] preacher and president could not see to
[42:19] tell him
[42:20] what the word is
[42:24] and here the donkey showed him
[42:27] that man that's the that's the messenger
[42:30] of the age
[42:31] that's the 20th century prophet you're
[42:34] calling his name
[42:35] as if it's a curse word but that's not a
[42:37] curse word
[42:38] that's the messenger of this age that's
[42:41] the
[42:42] voice of god speaking through him to
[42:45] these last days
[42:46] and the donkey had more sense
[42:50] than balaam had he called the
[42:54] donkey an ass but in actual fact
[42:57] he was the one making the ass options
[43:01] the assumptions and the presumptions
[43:04] he was the one that was off the word
[43:08] and the donkey was on the word of the
[43:11] living god
[43:13] my friends god speaking through a donkey
[43:16] and god has always spoken
[43:18] in tongues to people and and they don't
[43:22] hardly understand
[43:23] remember at belches feast many many take
[43:26] care of your person
[43:28] god speaking in tongues
[43:31] and there again my friends god
[43:34] at pentecost spoken tongues god of jesus
[43:39] spoke in towns but it's not the way many
[43:42] of them think
[43:43] it's a sign of judgment judgments is
[43:46] fixed into strike
[43:47] amen you're found wanting your way
[43:51] in the balances you found wanting oh my
[43:54] god
[43:54] think about it amen yes sir here it is
[43:58] the warning of oncoming judgment and
[44:01] then
[44:02] the angel was made visible
[44:05] to balaam and said balaam
[44:09] except for that donkey warning you
[44:12] you would have been a dead man now you
[44:16] turn right around and go back
[44:19] where you come from and back there
[44:23] you go back and admonish them
[44:28] to lay off the children of israel
[44:31] okay balaam went back but you know what
[44:34] happened
[44:36] balak came and offering even more money
[44:39] bigger than the amount he had before oh
[44:43] my the money was so big he couldn't see
[44:45] pass it
[44:46] it blocked his vision it blinded him he
[44:49] couldn't see
[44:50] where he was going oh the new car the
[44:53] new house
[44:54] they knew this oh everything else it
[44:57] blinded him
[44:58] the honors oh the great prayer
[45:01] at this great place he has to go to he
[45:04] has this engagement that engagement
[45:07] no time to pray rather than to pray he
[45:09] seeks
[45:10] his pillow rather than to my friends
[45:13] have uh
[45:13] you know agony in the presence of god he
[45:16] wants to argue
[45:17] with the people of god but god wants
[45:20] true men and women of god
[45:21] that will stand by the truth until the
[45:24] crown again
[45:25] will stand and hold to god's unchanging
[45:28] hand
[45:29] so balaam went up
[45:32] and he set up seven altars that shows he
[45:36] knew something about the truth seven
[45:38] number of perfection and offered up
[45:41] clean beasts a sacrifice
[45:44] and even kill the ram which shows he had
[45:48] knowledge of a coming messiah
[45:51] a sign of the coming lamb of god
[45:56] that would die for the sins of the world
[45:59] amen he knew how to approach god
[46:02] he actually had that he had all the
[46:05] mechanics right
[46:06] he could quote all the scripture tell
[46:08] you the chapter the verse the year
[46:10] the history the archaeology and so on he
[46:13] knew it
[46:14] back in front but he had not the
[46:17] revelation
[46:18] the dynamics of the holy spirit coming
[46:21] upon that word
[46:22] to make the word life once again
[46:26] amen but there was israel
[46:30] done in the valley offering praises to
[46:34] god and sacrifices to god
[46:36] doing the very same thing and blessing
[46:40] the name of the living god amen
[46:43] or praise god brother sister
[46:46] the same thing that happened at nicaea
[46:50] it's happening again
[46:53] there put over balaam's doctrine then
[46:57] and nicoletianism them
[47:00] and they're doing the same thing once
[47:03] again
[47:05] not the doctrine of god not the doctrine
[47:08] of the truth but of
[47:12] nicolasianism and balaamism
[47:16] and there the church has stumbled
[47:20] and has fallen from when she came
[47:24] and they're all becoming like dead men
[47:28] oh my think of it brother sister
[47:32] balaam was ready to prophesy
[47:35] once again but god tied up his tongue
[47:40] he ended up with tight towns god
[47:43] just tied it up that he could not
[47:46] curse israel amen instead of cursing
[47:50] them
[47:51] he find himself prophesying a star
[47:54] would rise out of jesse amen
[47:57] and he bless israel instead of cursing
[48:01] israel i want to tell you when god has
[48:05] blessed you
[48:06] none can curse you when god has
[48:09] delivered you
[48:11] none can put a spell and curse upon you
[48:14] none can put voodoo on you none
[48:18] could bring anything against you because
[48:21] god
[48:22] has blessed you and brought you out of
[48:24] the mary clay
[48:26] brought you from darkness into light
[48:29] brought you from
[48:30] bondage into freedom into the glorious
[48:33] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[48:37] of the living god hallelujah
[48:40] and saw my friends he began to look
[48:44] upon israel balak said no no
[48:48] balaam go down amongst the israelites
[48:53] and spy out if they got any faults
[48:57] weaknesses amongst them
[49:01] if they any of them in there make any
[49:04] mistakes
[49:05] you see that's what the devil loves
[49:07] because not like we're not going to make
[49:09] mistakes as you become he's still human
[49:12] and we're going to make mistakes but
[49:14] jesus christ
[49:15] that if you sin he says i provided a
[49:18] blood that you can corrupt
[49:20] confess and be cleansed and wash from
[49:24] your sins
[49:25] but they're gonna still look for your
[49:27] faults and you know what they're gonna
[49:28] do
[49:28] spread it everywhere and they'll talk
[49:31] about that
[49:32] and they'll spread it everywhere they
[49:35] can
[49:37] that's the tactics that the devil always
[49:41] loves to use but i want you to know
[49:43] friends
[49:45] that even though the devil uses scandal
[49:50] even though he uses lies
[49:53] even though he uses rumors to blackball
[49:57] you
[49:59] put put you down
[50:02] give your black name a bad name
[50:06] see all manner of evil against you
[50:10] amen i tell you friends
[50:13] they don't understand that in spite of
[50:17] your mistakes and you impart your
[50:20] imperfections
[50:22] your back parts in other words god is
[50:25] not
[50:25] looking upon that because he knows a
[50:28] true child would repent
[50:30] a true child would ask for forgiveness
[50:33] but god has offered them his grace
[50:38] and his goodness so in spite
[50:42] even the nation of israel in our day
[50:45] people look at them and say oh they've
[50:47] done this they've done that
[50:48] they made this mistake they made that
[50:50] mistake and maybe they have
[50:53] but they do not understand god is not
[50:55] looking at the mistakes
[50:58] he is looking at his word that must
[51:01] be fulfilled and must come to pass
[51:05] amen and that god works not by
[51:09] works but he moves through
[51:12] grace not by the works of
[51:15] righteousness which we have done but by
[51:18] his grace and mercy
[51:20] he has called us to attention by his
[51:22] word
[51:23] thank god while they were cursing israel
[51:26] and speaking against
[51:27] israel as i'm winding up this talk
[51:30] they failed to recognize that israel
[51:34] had the pillar the pillar of cloud
[51:37] by day and a pillar
