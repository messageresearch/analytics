hallelujah amen praise god look at him give it over to brother danny god bless you amen praise god hallelujah you may be seated just for a moment uh some of you may or may not be aware the the skyway bridge there's issues there this morning and so uh pastor simon is just delayed for a little bit but we thought that um take the opportunity to just come up and say a few words about our prayer meetings on friday nights we've been having our online prayer meeting every friday night for those of you that have been joining us every friday night you know what's been happening you know the testimonies that are coming forth we have not missed i think we only missed one in all of the in since we started because we don't want to miss one of them they have been absolutely spectacular the testimonies that have been coming forth have been tremendous yes i'm going to allow brother desmond to come and um you know we've had some tremendous tremendous testimonies so even if you can't make it i'm telling you get your prayer requests in call your deacon call one of the brothers uh you know that you know are regularly there you can call me anytime because i i basically administer it like the the actual online um uh you know director right to you know because i have to run it and so forth but we have different brothers that rotate to minister the services they have been tremendous saints and so this this past friday night we had a prayer request uh you know you know i'd say you know come on up and give it but i'm just gonna give it anyway because just to keep it down from the amount of people coming and moving but sister patsy uh caitlyn she's got a brother in trinidad that um you know always kind of never wanted to have anything to do with the message was stubborn um you know because her family and so forth her parents they you know they believe this word but you know there's always that one or two siblings that they just don't you know they don't want to know that's okay it's not because they don't want to know it's because it's not their time that's what it is but there's a time in a season for every single son and daughter of god and so he just so happened to be on his deathbed on friday night hadn't eaten anything in over two weeks they basically said he's on his way out and so the prayer request was brought to the meeting and we prayed for uh her brother what is his name nello nello brother nello and so anyways saturday morning she gets note a call he's [Music] [Music] she says he's been crying he's had a meal [Music] then he says i want to be baptized by pastor simon [Music] so what's going on saints when i heard that testimony this morning i was rejoicing i said you know god's timing on everything is perfect he's never ever ever off he knows exactly what he's doing that should give us faith as sons and daughters of god to know that there's nothing out of order god is dealing with his children he knows exactly when to deal with them speak to them raise them up from the dead whatever needs to be done amen praise god so you know that's just one testimony but we've had so many it's it's just been like brother chris could come up here he was testifying on friday night of you know certain things that were brought before the lord in our prayer meetings tremendous like it just what is it it's just god saying that you know what like you have faith i will always honor your faith and you know we we have this conception oh we've got to be in the church and we've got to be gathered together you know praying all together in order for him to move he sits back and he says are you kidding me yes that is something that i really love and i will always bless and i will but that doesn't limit him from how he wants to deal and and answer prayer and do things and he knows all about this pandemic he knows exactly the circumstances that we're dealing with but if we can be faithful to be at the services no matter where they are i know there's a lot of you out there today that are sitting in the comfort of your home you have a reason for being there like we said last week not every one of you could be here we'd have to be turning you away at the door and then you'd have made the trip and missed the service because you got to drive all the way home but there's an order and god has provided that order for us and everybody is being led and moved in a certain way so if you're at home you can you can receive everything that we receive right here there's no difference because he's honoring your faith he doesn't he doesn't say well i'm going to be at 5270 new street too bad if you're not there [Music] if it was that way we missed it a long time ago praise god amen so praise god for that um i'm gonna let brother desmond come on up and say a few words and give testimony of the things that he sees happening praise god god bless you brother praise the lord praise the lord we are here to glorify him hallelujah thank you jesus this is our purpose of calling to glorify the lord jesus christ to bring him on the scene who can tell me our god is not real but abraham's message stand for jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he never changed you know last week about four days ago i was at work and i feel like somebody told me to go to my neighbor i said no i'm busy i just tried to go and i stopped on the door i went back to work and he told me about go back there so i went there when i went there this man he was peeling blood for two days every time he go to washroom the water is blood so when i went there they were discussing who gonna take him to the hospital so i stood there for a while and after they finished i said do you want me to pray for you he said yes so i began to pray with them because when i went there the son said the whole night they couldn't sleep the whole family was scared they were all up satan has teared them up fear put a fear on them so i rebuke that spirit in the name of the lord jesus christ to lose that family and i know i believe god so much that if if i pray it will happen amen there's no doubt in my heart because the message that we receive is real hallelujah it's not just sitting here there's a supernatural being is here that with us let me tell you your eye cannot see but you can feel it in your in your soul hallelujah our god is real so i pray with him after i finish i left i didn't say nothing i want to do my job [Music] so the following day i went there and i said how you feel they said after i prayed for him and i left when they go to worship there was no there was no blood the following day there was no blood empty today even brother gabriel tested for the cochlear implant before that [Music] before i went there gabriel told him they spoke to brother gabriel about that man and brother gabriel said he was gonna call me to go over there to help that man there and he forgot but jesus never forgot hallelujah hallelujah i'll go reign let me tell you you are more than what you think do not underestimate yourself god has given you something tremendous that the people in the world doesn't know does not know but let me tell you stand on your porch stand on your position and see the hand of god in your life each and every one has a place in the kingdom of god don't ever say that on your the the your god-given right he said every promise in the book is ours hallelujah firm and know that our god is the same yesterday today and forever god bless you [Music] pastor simon has arrived he'll be out in a minute uh but while we have a moment here he wanted me to share this with you um on behalf of himself and sister desiree to the saints of good neighbor ministries even though you didn't have to do it you did it anyway and it was much appreciated he wants to thank you each and every one for your kind words your kind thoughts your gifts your your love towards him and his family at this time from the pastor appreciation day that we we had for him last week thank you very much god bless you all and so um we certainly uh do appreciate our pastor and we thank god for him and um we appreciate what you do you know as the leadership of this ministry we appreciate all that you do for him always keeping him in prayer his family and uh as the lord leads you to bless and and pray for our precious pastor amen praise god let's just sing one more song as we prepare for the word of the lord um word of god speak remedy is under a great expectation this morning amen i don't know about you but these services have been absolutely tremendous the word in season talk about the word in season saints this is the thing that caught every single one of us it was because jesus came to you personally and he spoke to you personally he called you personally he he loved you personally he healed you personally he met your needs personally and that's the thing that that has changed every one of us we don't come here because we want to be seen we come because we've been personally invited into the presence of the king amen word of god speak pour down like the rain washing my eyes [Music] please let the word of god [Music] was [Music] [Applause] [Music] washing my eyes [Music] grace grace [Music] god's grace [Music] oh it's amazing praise [Music] [Applause] it's amazing [Music] god's grace [Music] oh god speak to us this morning lord jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] presence [Music] salvation [Music] is there anything is there anything in your heart is there anything that you need the lord to speak to then you need to let it go you need to repent you need to turn away and you need to not listen to that lying devil that will always try to convict you and condemn you for things because god has provided a way this morning amen god bless you pastor simon the lord bless you my pastor lord bless all of you here today praise god [Applause] thank god we already have a victory before we even started so we want to thank god and give him all the glory praise please be seated uh we have with us today here brother gabriel prospero and his two sons praise the lord we're very brother amen god bless you brother praise the lord god bless you [Applause] the brother's wife uh he you know is just preparing to send for her saving his money and just trying to get her over from africa from the congo and just to receive word that she had passed away so um they they had the burial over there he's going to have some kind of a gathering of fellowship over here and we will of course do our best to support him and help him with that but we share our sympathies and the feeling in our heart when a loved one has passed on may god be with you strengthen comfort and heal all of you at this particular time thanks be the god may your prayers go out also for sister ismae uh pascal here she has some challenges that she is facing and with the counseling pastoral counseling as well as the help of the deacon or deacons god is helping her to work things out we also want to give praise and thanks to god for sister patsy's brother whom god has touched we certainly believe that prayer changes things we believe in the miraculous power of god the pentecostals have it one way but he does things as the bible says severally as he will not just what we think well he'll give you you know good for his good will right he'll give you his uh perfect will and so on but the fact is you got to come right down to his will his perfect will because you may want something and because god loves his children he might give them the candy that they want right another one may ask something and he may give it to them that doesn't mean that that's his perfect will because he's granting you all of those things but when you are willing to humble yourself surrender and whether you see one two or none no miracles no signs you are in the perfect will of god when he wills he'll send it if you call and call and you ask him for it you can have a whole lot but once i had the blessing now i have the lord it's not what a.b simpson's got that revelation said once i wanted healing now the healer i own in that wonderful praise god what what you prefer the product or the or the factory the owner of the factory which one so we thank god that we own the we have the owner we have the factory we have the ocean we have everything and when we need it then he supplies praise the lord but if you keep calling call and calling for it oh yeah he'll give you that's fine so brother branham said the same thing in the sense of if you want tongues oh sure he'll give you give you a whole lot of tongues he give you this he give you that but you're seeking for his perfect will i'm not going to take up your time but i'll get into the word of god we're going to talk about the bride at the judgment seat of christ amen praise the lord and that we'll read our scripture out of second corinthians chapter 5 verse 10 1 verse and then we'll make our comments on the word of god amen praise god hallelujah by the way is that clock back there okay all right 5 10 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according that he had done whether it be good or bad amen father we thank you for the reading of your word we pray that the great holy spirit will bless us together and lift us up we pray as we commit ourselves in their gracious keeping in jesus name amen god bless you please be seated wherever you are as we look into the word of god we want to continue and uh and complete if we can where we were last week we talked in uh the seventh seal book page uh of 460. where brother branham spoke that he was standing there and says while i'm standing here there are voices passing through this room do you believe that amen we know it now because uh radio television all kinds of the internet have captured that there's voices passing through the wavelengths in this atmosphere and uh and you can hear them praise god you'll have to turn on a computer a phone or something else but you can pick up those voices praise the lord of course a prophet didn't really need that to pick up those voices but the fact is there are voices passing through the room praise the lord and so um for for you to be able to pick up those voices i believe i quoted also out of the church age book where he said right now god is broadcasting amen hallelujah thank god he's a broadcaster anyway the word is going out amen but not everyone can pick it up you can hear the word red you can hear the word preached but not everyone will pick it up everyone in the crowd may hear with their ears right but you've got to have a crystal to pick it up if it's radio amen you got to have some kind of a computer chip in you to be able to translate and and and you know get that thing processed properly so you can understand what it is that's passing what it is you're really hearing praise god hallelujah so you see you can read the word of god you can read your bible and you can hear the word and still not hear the voice of god coming out of that word you see because one is the written word one is the spoken word and then one comes alive to the hearer whom the bible says he that hat and ear past tense when did he get that ear praise the lord he that hat and ear who eat it has an ear to hear let him or her here praise god so that ear was in you from before the foundation of the world that germ was in you before the foundation of the world he knew that there would be a people on the earth that had a crystal to pick up the word that he was going to send and now you are recognizing that you are one of those people because somehow no matter how like jacob you look like a trickster you look like a crook you look like a bad woman or a bad person everything else that's on the outside of you but thanks be to god you're starting to find out respective of how you seem or look or appear on the outside god looks in there and he sees one of his children he sees one of his saints praise god they must still be suffering from a bit of amnesia but the holy spirit is here to bring you back to recognize the day you're living in who your father is where you come from and where you're going back to glory to god hallelujah the jews were reading the same story the same scriptures that jesus was reading the apostles all of them were reading the same scripture but yet when jesus picked it up he used the same scripture and said not moses said this this and the way he would express it what what would reveal to them what was in their hearts and instead of being glad they got mad they got mad at was what was being expressed from the word of god but they did not hear the voice of god coming out of the word and the disciples even said master how is it that we we can hear we can understand what you're saying but the jews they can't understand it what you're saying and he said well you see unto you it's given to know and understand the mysteries of the kingdom of god but unto them it is not given so that ability is a gift that ability is grace that ability is god's choice being manifested amen from that you are no i am one of the few i am one of the few by god's grace i know i'm one of the few praise god hallelujah oh but i don't know the message i don't know this i don't know that god didn't ask you what you know he asked brother branham said do you believe he asks you what you believe not what you know praise god hallelujah glory to his name so i thank god for this and i give him glory praise god so the prophet spoke his message jesus spoke judas heard all the sermons and it didn't do him no good because he had no receptor praise god hallelujah amen now the prophet spoke the prophet brought his message we read the books we listen to all the tapes all day all night and everything else they hear the words they hear even brother branham's voice but they don't hear god's voice behind that voice amen praise god see because he don't have a receptor to be able to pick that up and recognize what it is they're hearing praise god glory to his wonderful name and without something inside of you to pick that up you'll perish no matter how religious outside you appear you may even appear so good better a good charitable a good person this and that that has nothing to do with it amen nothing to do with it the guy outside may be a renegade a god looks inside what's inside there and that's what he recognizes and that's what appeals to him praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so i'm glad that at least i have a part of that chinese laundry attack amen once he's finished washing my sins away and i got a piece and he's got the pace when that deep calls back to the deep and the two deeps meet amen he says oh when to omnipotence is meat he says something has got to give something's gotta take place when to omnipotence this meat and now the deep crawls back to the deep and the deep must respond why my sheep hear my voice praise god that statement takes on a lot more than just saying it my sheep hear my voice not hear my message not hear the prophet that's good you're hearing all that but do you hear his voice my god glory to his wonderful name let me tell you the bible become a new bible the message is a new message everything is exploding it's just opening up and praise god hallelujah i almost spoke in tongues there but anyway oh hallelujah amen yes sir i tell you my friends like i said the bride the world is now sitting at the very judgment seat of christ and if you don't know it the judgment seat of christ is the word revealed praise god hallelujah of course this is now revealing itself but then face to face amen praise god i'm not telling you it's happening now and it's not going to happen then i'm telling you it's starting to happen right now is that right for he that liveth and believeth in me shall not come into judgment what's he talking about you will not have to go to the white throne judgment which is judgment whether to heaven or hell or whatever that's judgment to hell praise god you you passed already why because you allow yourself to be judged by the word by christ you've come to the white drawn judgment and you right now praise god and you allow yourself to be judged by the word or when the word judges you you repent when the word points out something to you you didn't know or didn't see you repent amen remember satan fell from heaven praise god before the fall of man even started go to the scripture prayed do it before the fall you must understand and realize what is happening its pray did that in heaven and it's prayed for men to repent praise god hallelujah and turn to god forsake their sins ask for his forgiveness glory to god ask for his forgiveness my friends right there he is merciful willing and ready to give it to us praise the lord hallelujah amen whoa praise god so we are at the judgment seat of christ and your attitude to the word shows you exactly where you are just like the two thieves on the cross one goes this way and one goes that way both went to their inheritance well what was their inheritance one straight today you'll be with me in paradise and the other one goes to his inheritance on the other side so you are we sitting in here but we are positioning and placing ourselves by our attitude to the word of god you see we sit here and when we start to realize that not by wisdom not by our own understanding not by boasting how many years i've been in the message how many books i read how many tapes i read how many bibles i read oh if that was boasting then i will be able to really both then oh my goodness boxes of different bibles that i've uh given away and things like that different translations this that and the other but that's not even it that's not it my friends not by all that paul himself could tell you and paul knew and being the wisest man of his day not by works of righteousness which we have done amen but let me tell you mercy and grace reveals the word of god to you and that is what saves you from the judgment the white trump judgment your attitude to that word and the opening of your ears and eyes and understanding is what saves you praise the lord grace and mercy praise god hallelujah so of course we can sit here and not hear the revelation you hear the word of god and uh you don't hear the revelation and thus your hearing becomes your judgment right there your hearing becomes your judgment instead of mercy so you see there goes the twins there goes the two people again one set everybody's listening but to one it's mercy and grace and to the other one judgment because the one isn't doing anything to receive it it's just coming because god like he did to abraham didn't say abraham i know this you're a good man that's why i came to you first in ur of the childish no unconditionally god saw his seed his life in him when god came to him nothing abraham had to do no learning no wisdom no nothing but i have trouble i'm the one tell you get up and go out i am the one praise god unconditional covenant by the opening of the word of god you and i are seeds of abraham we have the royal seed we got the same attitude amen we're going out anyway oh but you don't know where you're going where is this heaven is it up there is it down there is it crossed there where is this some secret valley some part of the world is is a shangri-la is a little island somewhere no we don't care where it is because heaven is where jesus is anyway glory to god hallelujah amen paul said what is not of faith revelation is sin you see what is not a face is so you missed it already because uh not again you use another scripture he said and they they they run into trouble because they're not being mixed with faith right what they're receiving is not mixed with faith they don't have any revelation with it all they got to do all they have is knowledge all they have is intellectuals might be religious intellectuals but as intellectuals anyway praise god praise god hallelujah oh my there's a lot of doctors of divinity of this message now you know so many years later we end up having lots of doctors and divinities of the message they may not call themselves that but the way they are you know they can absolutely tell here praise the lord oh my praise god you sit here you hear the literal voice of god speaking out of the message that's the mercy of god to you amen that is the mercy of god being shed abroad in our hearts didn't he say two will be in a field gospel field one shall be taken and the other one left mercy and judgment right there two in a field one taken one left husband and wife two in a bed one taken one left praise god the summit will bring them joy but the others sorrow despair when our lord and glory comes he has come seven seals oh my will meet him in the air oh thanks be the god hallelujah amen this word sets one free and the other one it mixes up and binds and ties them up in every possible way it's beyond human understanding it's beyond any humanity praise god forevermore i give him all the glory and all the praise for everything that our lord jesus has done oh my think about this question and answers on the seals page 468 now you say you can't say those things it's best to leave it alone you remember the third poll you remember what it was don't tell anybody what did it say how many remembers that i remember standing there trying to last that eyelet in that little pair of shoes of course shoulders walk walking and all that and the islet speaks of the eyes amen praise the lord or in the vision and he said now remember you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things praise the lord oh my i said this will be the third poll i said it will not be known so help me by the grace of god but now we are right at the end time and it won't be too long until what is a mercy seat will become a judgment seat amen the whole thing starts to change from mercy to judgment after his people are receiving the lord and when the last one goes out that mercy changes to a judgment seat amen there's nothing left but judgment my brothers and sisters oh pray right now and ask god to bring our loved ones in to bring our luck praise god we pray pray all we want it's his election but we don't know until we pray pray pray maybe with the last breath maybe while they're just about to guess their last breath they show god and there's repentance in that hallelujah there's change in that transformation in that all the thief had to say was lord one word remember to me that it was over he's born again he's saved from all his sins for all them years he killed him murder he steals this that that three words and it was done glory to god god can do the same for every one of us our family and everybody if we trust the word of the living god oh hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah i tell you while it's setting some people free others are being left for their souls imprisoned now why they weren't chosen so they're imprisoned in that position they can't come out of it oh praise god oh praise god hallelujah oh my uh we hear the gods prophet speaking listen clearly in the word amen you see a mor that mercy seat will become a judgment seat and you may be you're gathered now in heavenly places it also means more than just for you to be rejoicing in heavenly places you're assembled in christ it's a fearful thing see mercy and judgment standing by the angel of the lord you'd think one would just be shouting and screaming oh that's not it that it scares you to death nearly see you see that there is a difference in just rejoicing and just being bubbling and uh and that's all right but then now we're coming down to the real thing amen you're going to shout you're going to dance you're going to have all of that praise god but now all that you do paul said do it with the understanding we're coming down to where we're shouting with understanding we are dancing with understanding we're praising god with understanding all we do even when we pray our prayer is with understanding understanding revelation is everything you do do it by revelation praise the name of the living god hallelujah oh praise god you say oh you mean to say the simplest thing yes god likes to be in everything you got a call even that talk to him about it he loves to hear from you about it amen praise god oh my when will that be brother branham i cannot tell you that see i do not know that but one of these days if we meet again on this earth we're going to meet see we're going to meet seat where are you going to meet round the world at the judgment seat the judgment seat of jesus christ glory to his marvelous and wonderful name glory to god hallelujah aren't you glad that you're one of them praise god think about it that we are hearing jesus christ himself speaking to us in this hour you see you go back and see how god's word is so wise who could have thought that when he talks about the coming of jesus christ and how he's going to come on the earth by the seventh seal and then when he comes he will open up or expose or show to the world or manifest to the world or interpret to the world what is that seventh seal you you know i when the message first came and i'm reading those things you are thinking that the lord is gonna come down and it's just the lord you weren't thinking that i am a part of that i'm in him and that's just the head coming down to identify his body he's just coming down and now it's the sec it's the coming of christ but in the bride for that was the mystery and is the mystery that was hid through the ages the jews didn't know nothing about it it was revealed to none of them for if the princes of this world knew they would not have crucified him so that the bride will be separated from him and adam and eve but yet god called them adam amen the the real body and the head together jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever glory to god in that day you'll know i am in the father the father in me and i in you and the two was one for the twain shall be one flesh praise peter god hallelujah so through the prophet is telling us that he's here to identify his bride identify his people his own this secret and to reveal the secrets of whose name was on the book is that right by this opening of the word it identifies whose name was on the book for if your name is in the book he's going to call your name i remember back there in the old days that teacher will get up early in the morning before classes start and and say you know a bell white present oh my god danny mazzilli oh present lord of god and call another name glory to god and a person jump up and raise their hand to identify that they are present they are one lord of god no wonder you're shouting hallelujah when the word of god is preached because you recognize in the word yourself is in the word sometimes you're happy you don't even know why you're happy but but something is registering in here there's something hitting that there's the spoon the sound oh my they got a sounding fork in you and when that sound of the gospel strikes on him oh my lord of god something responds your answer to your name he said of course that name is not jim james or or lee vale or whatever but what that the spirit is saying from the word you know and i believe that is exactly that part of the word that you are he deliberately makes that preacher start to talk about that and and immediately there's a response within your soul because it's you he's talking about you'll always think the preacher is talking about you amen and he is but not knowingly unless god would reveal something to him that would be the holy spirit you know um i used to have that problem where the holy spirit would reveal things but that's in the message but the early part still under that anointing you know pentecostal anointing you may want to call it where you you'll tell a brother something and you know and oh no that wasn't god that was just you you just telling me i said no brother that that just wasn't me i wasn't even thinking that i just you know just came out of me like that and i just told you right praise god hallelujah said well you know in one case the person came with a dream and you know and what's the meaning of this dream and whatnot so i said just leave it alone the manifestation will be in the interpretation and it just happened that maybe uh months later the brother rose up in the church while i'm preaching because he thinks that i am talking about something happen in his house which and i wasn't there but the holy spirit is doing it and revealing it and he got mad and he got up and you know right in the service while it's going on and trumping out to grab his wife and he's trumping out and everything else and while he's going out they said brother you remember your dream and in the dream you were fighting and arguing with somebody and you couldn't see who it was and everything else i said you're doing it right now you just you see you just don't recognize it that's why i tell you left leave it alone the manifestation will be the interpretation and it's happening right now praise god well i'm saying that just to let you know that is what it is we are manifesting the word of the hour and proving my friends this is not a dream that we are in we are now living in a reality praise god we're walking in the light of the day praise god her name is on the book as i said amen and when the eternal word jesus christ calls out to the other part of the eternal word amen oh my like the written call the unwritten calling to the written like the unseen calling to see right the the one must respond to the other one but in actual fact because in actual fact they are the same you can't see where one is joined or the other one ends because they are the same so she is him revealed brother branham said christ is revealed in his own word and he only reveals himself in his chosen people his chosen word for that day and for that hour oh praise god so she finds out if he is doing that revealing himself through her then it identifies her to herself and she finds out that she is him that eternal word now being revealed in time through and by her and that her walking and living is the living interpretation of a living bible living epistles being made known to all men praise god recognizing the word hallelujah amen because my friends she recognized that she has heard his voice she became aware of his call she felt his touch glory to god hallelujah she had an invisible yonyan i don't know about you but i've had one an invisible union christ and his bride hallelujah i felt the pull and i still feel it because now he's pulling me to his father's house he's saying come and go with me to my father's house i'm taking you out of here after you've done all that you can praise god you're going out of here they're gonna try to close you up but as the prophet said they can do that but we're going up praise god we're going up praise the name of the lord jesus oh my yes sir so we we are we are part of that great invisible marriage that uniting time and so we can now take our stand and be a real help meet or mate yes we can help your mission a name to declare a mission to die praise god a word to perform lord of god we can be a part and we are a part of that amen in this day and in this hour oh praise god take your stand here today i want to challenge you take your stand here today and say it with confidence believe it in your heart i and my father are one say it let's say it together i and my father are one more time i and my father are one amen you are by the spirit led by the spirit of the living god amen oh my so if you and the father of one and you are part of that eternal word a piece of that word a chip of that word an attribute of that word is in you then my friends you come from eternity if you're part of that eternal world where else can you come from you come from the eternal you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity where you come from that's what jesus said when he said i come from god and i go to god i'm not one even you i've got the written the the quotations here printed out where brother branham said don't you realize amen that he is the word of god that being revealed to you amen hallelujah and that word you are that word in this hour let me just find that you got to hear that for yourself not just my telling you remember he is the one who opened those seals and he is those seals for all the word of god the whole word of god is christ the whole word whether from this age that is that is once they're called out and they're all sum total together that's why it says in him was the fullness of the godhead how bodily part of that was in bodies human bodies right and he he totaled up he's the sum total of it we just chips and pieces of it praise the name of the lord we he made us into nice diamond needles so that when we we we go down when we touch the word the word starts speaking to us through that needle well because we built with that needle within us lord of god hallelujah so here it is he is whole word of god is christ and that's the seals that was revealed what was it doing revealing christ all of christ was revealing all of him amen now you see that's what the seven angels represented the seven churches are completed why they were going back the seven churches is over amen and these seven angels that came down they uh represented those seven church ages and we couldn't see it they did that took the picture not us they're here standing there supreme judge showing he is alpha and omega he and he is the body he is the first created manifested and he is also the last he is bride and bridegroom amen praise the name of the lord the beginning and the end oh what an identification that is do you realize that quickening power what that did and is doing for us quickening power is what us lets us see his coming is that right quickening power snatched you and i away from death into life quickening power is what gives you discernment right now to know what is wrong amen and what to do and what you have done and what you are not to have done quickening power does that what you should have done and what you will be quickening power does all of these things praise the name of the lord oh my our lord jesus was so full of quickening power he was all of it together he was so full of that quickening power he said destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days talk about confidence in the quickening power destroy this body destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days oh my why why did he say that he knew that it was written of him it was written of him by the word of god which could not fail the word said it see he know the quickening power would raise him up and not one of his cells could become corrupt is that right do you believe it oh my praise god he said destroy the temple i'll bring it back again why that was prophecy not right then just the the resurrection back then but the prophet is saying here now that was prophecy the word of god and it's prophecy if it's true the word of god cannot fail and this that same prophecy and word of god that he said he would raise up says that we are already raised up you see how he made that change right quickly there that you are that word that he said he would raise up and he has raised us up right now he said you are raised up right now you're raised up by the power and the quickening power of the living god and the spirit that is now in us was in him now in us and it is now quickening our mortal bodies praise the name of the lord you realize that you got the vibrations of the rapture in you right now you know this is vibrations keeping all these things together that we can see by the word of god everything consists amen hallelujah the rapture is now in progress you don't realize it but you are on a different octave and you are vibrating to a different level that they know nothing about you don't feel nothing i'm not telling you to feel anything you don't have to feel nothing but it's happening whether you feel that you don't feel it god's holy spirit is doing it brother sister being quickened by the power of god hallelujah blessed be the holy blessed name of the living god oh my yes sir so we see friends that the seventh seal actually speak uh of our way spoken of way back in the book of genesis and it was spoken of as the seed of the woman christ the word praise god and when it was spoken uh one and one made two is not what we say one and one makes two but god in genesis said no that's okay for you naturally but adam and eve makes adam one on one doesn't make two one and one is still one is that right if you want to go to the electroluxe way right praise god see no systems that satan set up it will be that way if you want to exist in this system that's the way you got to add it up for them but according to the word of god one and one is still one eve and adam together is adam praise the name of the living god hallelujah so that's him and us making up the fullness of the word of god the fullness of the eternal word not just this written word but the eternal word we make up of the fullness of that eternal word of god hallelujah amen and so that's why only he could interpret himself right and he is the eternal word so who else could interpret you who could understand the word of god for the hour we were so well hidden praise god that he had to make himself clear and known to us amen hallelujah so this seventh seal if you can clearly see it now uh reveals christ that he was those seals and that now it reveals us the bride that we are the last seal that whose flesh he hides behind right because uh they're you know when they they pierce them in the side of course the the the bride for the church ages all the churches just came out and now um he is hidden behind our skin veil oh my i'm just going to have to stay here because my mind is going into unveiling of the mighty god the badger skins and so on and so on and so on because that's what he's done we are the seal for him and he's hiding behind our veil his mass behind our veil well it's got no color of the skin whether it's black badger or whether it's a goater sheep or whatever he's hiding behind that veil and he uses whoever he wills whenever he wills glory to god hallelujah amen i'm gonna wind this up now praise god hallelujah so friends we know that after uh i'm jumping over stuff here but after this six seals was over because that's history there was nothing else to be said because all the word all the written word was already made known under those six seals all the written word all the history all the human knowledge that you can get amen the the fault that not the politicians the um theologians could follow that as far as the sixth but when it get to the seventh now unwritten unwritten unspoken word amen it's just there praise god you can't enter into that holy of holies unless you are a king and priest to god unless you are invited in unless you are invited him to go and bring your sacrifice your offering of course that sacrifice is a living sacrifice which is yourself amen which you offer to him a living sacrifice which is your your service praise god that the only service you could give to him is to offer yourself not to wait till you're dead but you're alive and you are living sacrifice giving yourself over to him completely amen hallelujah so the prophet had to wait for christ revelation 10 1 to come to him revelation 10 7 to fulfill the unwritten word to fulfill all of that and reveal his own word to us amen oh hallelujah revelation 2 of course he that hasn't here to hear let him hear what the spirit said praise god amen yes sir oh my praise god i tell you friends when he speaks the word reveals to us the revelation of whom he is and it also brings about the separation just as how god separated eve from adam and yet they were one it's making you know your identification but yet you are one with him praise the name of the lord glory to god amen some have ears to hear and some don't have ears some can hear this and some can't hear it some can listen and follow it up to the sixth seal man can they ever explain those six seals all the vials all the wine all the oil all the judgments all the persecution they can do all right there up but they don't know him the seventh seal and you know they don't know him because they can't unveil that part they can't unveil it because to unveil it is to unveil yourself is to reveal yourself praise the lord hallelujah in that marvelous and wonderful i know i'm starting to repeat myself and that's let me know i'm coming to end of what i'm have to say praise god hallelujah uh to recap it identifies christ and because we are part of him it also identifies the bride he is the seventh seal she is a bride of the seventh seal she is part of that seventh seal amen she is revealing him in this hour in this seventh age we thank god for it and we give him the praise the honor and the glory so as this word identifies christ it also exposes the antichrist spirit working through the very message that we claim to believe do you believe that where else is it going to go it went right into heaven in the presence of god and began trying to make mayhem and confusion there so where do you think it's going to go here today is going into the highest places can possibly go and that is to sit in the message and all they can do is mystify and get your mind up caught up with all those six but and they can even they can even talk about the seventh seal they can make it sound great but it once you experience that i can't explain that to you but once you experience that unveiling itself to you doesn't matter who it is they're going to walk right in the presence of the word test because god proved this word and now the word turns around and tests anything and everything that comes in the spread not judging but testing praise the lord anything that comes in the presence of god hallelujah amen so thank god that only god can send his word in the middle of a sinful corrupt generation right straight to his bride and they will come out of it and he's proving like how jesus came out of the grave and out of death only they can overcome this age no ordinary person by human instrumentality or even with satanic wisdom cannot overcome this sinful and evil age praise the lord amen praise god may god bless every one of you here this afternoon and i want to end by saying no matter your mistakes friends hallelujah because we're still in human bodies so never mind of all the perfection all the glorious marvelous things have talked about you still subject to mistakes there go i but for the grace of god oh that guy is doing this that woman is doing that that woman is doing that right in front of your eyes you may be even seeing it but i might put it this way don't even believe you naturalize believe the word of god that's been revealed to you amen listen i'm saying it because i've seen preaching the word of god while i'm just 14 years old and i've seen prostitutes lean out to the windows listen to the world and their lives changed i've seen those fishermen that are cursed words and carry on and everything else go down amongst them preach the word of course people calling me all kind of name what kind of preacher is that going among people like that and see those guys lives changed raise their families next thing you know they're going to church their lives completely change so don't look at your outward mistakes i'm not saying go out there and make mistakes or or just be relaxed because you're making mistakes you will want to cry out to god but the fact is don't let the devil use those outward things to throw you off the word don't get knocked down no matter where you are and who you are don't become discouraged praise god because his grace and mercy will see you true because you are already predestinated to stand no matter what comes against you you've been predestinated to stand predestinated to hear his voice and to answer his call you're predestinated for this hour you are the ones chosen to meet the challenge of this hour and to overcome it for the glory and praise of the living god stand and testify of his deliverance of this mighty hand within your lives let me let me close with this last reference here just like the three wise men of old the bible said they brought to him gifts and they gave him brother branham call it appropriate gifts he said why because it made you can see that they had a revelation they didn't just give because they were kings and they're wealthy and they got gifts but they give by revelation one give more he already revealed that he had a revelation that this messiah gonna die for the sins of the world one bring gold showing that he was king royalty and so on franken says that he was the high priest amen so their their gifts had a revelation behind it so i'm by saying won't you give him your lives as you are the wise men and women of today offering your life and let him take your life and receive it as our gift to him we're giving back to him what he has but we want to show him our love our appreciation and our worship for him not just by human understanding but by revelation we are worshiping him and giving him glory honor and praise may god bless every one of you here today and i trust the word of god will find its deep roots with you because this tree of life is a tree with deep roots you can't uproot it you can't pull it up you can't get rid of it it's all over me and it's keeping me alive and i give god the glory and praise god bless you rather amen hallelujah amen his grace and mercy has brought me true brother and i think we can sing that right now praise the lord his grace and mercy has brought me through i live in this moment let's all stand because of you cause of you [Music] i want to thank let's worship him and praise you too your
