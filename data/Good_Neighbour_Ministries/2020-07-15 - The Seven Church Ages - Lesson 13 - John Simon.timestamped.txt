[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] welcome to the house of god
[0:17] it's good to be here this evening
[0:22] as we looked into god's
[0:25] unchanging and infallible word
[0:29] found in the book of revelation
[0:32] chapter 1. i'm reading from
[0:36] revelation 1 verses 10 to 12.
[0:43] i was in the spirit on the lord's day
[0:48] and i heard a voice behind me
[0:53] a great voice as of a trumpet
[0:57] saying i am alpha
[1:00] and omega the first and the last
[1:05] and what thou seest write
[1:08] in a book and send it
[1:12] unto the seven churches which
[1:15] are in asia onto ephesus
[1:19] onto smyrna and onto pergamos
[1:23] and unto thyatira and onto sardis
[1:27] and onto philadelphia and onto
[1:31] laodicea and i
[1:34] turned to see the voice that spake with
[1:38] me
[1:39] and being turned i saw
[1:43] seven golden candle sticks
[1:48] our gracious heavenly father
[1:52] we thank you so much that you
[1:55] gave us your unchanging word
[2:00] may the great holy spirit now bring the
[2:03] word to life
[2:05] as we look into this perfect law
[2:08] of liberty and out of it may you receive
[2:12] all your glory and all your praise for
[2:15] we surrender ourselves to thee
[2:18] for service in the name of our lord
[2:21] jesus
[2:22] christ amen and amen
[2:26] the topic tonight is
[2:29] the voice like a trumpet
[2:34] john heard behind him
[2:37] in the vision a voice
[2:41] behind him sounding like
[2:44] a trumpet us tentorian
[2:48] voice for he was in the spirit
[2:51] and when you are in the spirit you hear
[2:54] the things of god
[2:56] you see the things of god
[2:59] and what ah an experience it is
[3:03] also for he was transported
[3:07] into that wonderful great day of the
[3:10] lord
[3:11] and there he was in the presence of god
[3:15] with the future uh about to unfold
[3:20] before his very eyes
[3:24] now god while he was in the spirit
[3:27] and that's the place all of us should be
[3:30] is in the spirit and then
[3:33] god was able to teach
[3:37] john teach him thanks be to god
[3:42] isn't that the place we all should be in
[3:45] what a place how we need
[3:49] in this hour the teaching of the holy
[3:52] spirit
[3:53] himself god himself coming to interpret
[3:58] his own word to the believer
[4:01] oh what a comfort what a strength
[4:05] what an encouragement when we we know
[4:08] that the
[4:09] children of god in that day will be
[4:12] taught of the lord himself and are being
[4:16] taught
[4:16] of the lord now it says that
[4:20] john heard a voice
[4:24] did not say it was a trumpet
[4:27] but that voice sounded like
[4:31] a trumpet now if
[4:34] it was like a trumpet we know
[4:37] that when ever a trumpet is blown
[4:42] it denotes urgency it's a
[4:45] call to attention it's
[4:49] heraldry like a herald
[4:52] goes before the coming of the king
[4:56] and says clear the way make his path
[4:59] straight
[5:00] the king is coming the king is coming
[5:04] let everyone pay attention because the
[5:08] king is coming
[5:09] i'm so happy that in our day god has
[5:13] sent a herald according to malachi
[5:16] chapter 4 verse 5 to clear the way
[5:20] clear all the the is out clearly
[5:24] high places out make the low places
[5:28] plain and straight carry away all the
[5:31] things that were contrary to god
[5:34] that our eyes may be open that we may
[5:37] welcome the
[5:38] coming of our beloved the coming of the
[5:41] lord
[5:42] jesus christ how happy we ought to be
[5:45] at the return of this blessed king
[5:49] so the trumpet sounds urgency the
[5:52] trumpet sounds
[5:53] the heraldry of the messenger
[5:57] and the word of god and also
[6:01] i want to make note of israel the nation
[6:05] of israel
[6:06] their affinity to trumpets
[6:10] for in the bible we know they are they
[6:13] have
[6:13] their silver trumpets blown by the
[6:16] priests
[6:17] we know brother sister that in the last
[6:21] day as time begins to blend
[6:24] back into eternity that they will
[6:27] be partaking fully of the feasts
[6:31] of the trumpet feast of atonement oh
[6:34] what a great time when they will be come
[6:37] back to a place to recognize their
[6:40] messiah
[6:41] and enter into their atonement
[6:45] by the very word of god that
[6:49] renewed and brought us to our atonement
[6:52] that very word which to us
[6:56] takes us to the wedding supper of the
[6:59] lamb
[7:00] and we are feasting upon that word
[7:03] now a seven course meal
[7:06] served by the hand of jesus christ
[7:09] himself through the ministry of his
[7:12] messenger
[7:13] all glory be to god hallelujah
[7:16] but to us it's the seventh seals reveal
[7:20] revealing what christ is the mystery
[7:24] of god revealed now to them it
[7:27] will be the feast of the of the trumpet
[7:31] out of the feast of the trumpets will
[7:34] unfold to them the marvelous
[7:37] revelation of jesus christ the
[7:41] jehovahness
[7:42] of jesus that the jesus
[7:45] the jehovah of the old testament
[7:48] is that jesus of the new testament
[7:53] and it will place their faith
[7:56] in this messiah whom a fourth time
[8:00] they had rejected but now because
[8:04] god says there's a time for everything
[8:06] there is a
[8:07] season for everything and in the
[8:10] fullness of
[8:11] time god sends forth his son so in the
[8:14] fullness of
[8:15] their time god will break
[8:19] the scales from off their eyes
[8:22] as he did in typical form on paul a saw
[8:26] and take the scale off of their eyes the
[8:29] veil will be lifted
[8:31] and they will be able to say i can see
[8:34] clearly now the gloom is gone
[8:36] the clouds are gone the fog is gone all
[8:40] of the distractions are gone and when
[8:43] they look
[8:44] they will see only jesus only jesus
[8:48] why for only jesus can satisfy
[8:52] their longing and their expectations
[8:56] and their waiting and their suffering
[8:59] right through the holocaust and many
[9:02] other
[9:03] tragedies and trials and tribulations
[9:07] through which they have come as a nation
[9:10] but there will that will all come to its
[9:13] culmination
[9:15] when they enter into the great
[9:18] revelation
[9:19] of jesus christ their messiah
[9:22] their lord their master and
[9:25] their soon-coming king who is also
[9:29] the king of all kings and the
[9:32] lord of lords for the kingdom of this
[9:35] war kingdoms of this world
[9:37] will become the kingdom of our lord
[9:40] and of his christ thanks be to god
[9:42] hallelujah
[9:43] amen amen so hearing this voice
[9:48] behind him this voice of urgency
[9:52] this voice proclaiming the
[9:56] coming of the king amen
[9:59] trumpets also symbolize
[10:02] when israel or the trumpet it means it's
[10:05] time to assemble
[10:07] it's time for the the tribes to assemble
[10:10] whether it's around the tabernacle or
[10:13] whether it was around
[10:14] moses or the high priest when those
[10:17] trumpets
[10:18] sounded it was a sign for them to
[10:21] assemble
[10:22] and when the gentiles hear the trumpet
[10:25] voice
[10:26] of the holy spirit speaking through a
[10:29] prophetic
[10:29] ministry in this hour it's a time to
[10:32] assemble
[10:33] it's the time for oneness it's a time to
[10:37] return
[10:38] back for it's the jubilee trumpet for
[10:40] the gentiles
[10:42] and they hear the blowing of the
[10:44] trumpets of liberty they hear the
[10:46] blowing of
[10:47] the trumpets and knowing their hearts
[10:50] that even though the devil held them
[10:53] captive
[10:54] made them prisoners to himself it is
[10:57] time for them to
[10:59] walk out of their prison doors and walk
[11:02] out of their habits walk out of their
[11:04] sins
[11:04] trials and tribulations and walk into
[11:07] the glorious freedom
[11:09] of the lord and savior jesus christ
[11:12] hallelujah
[11:13] the voice like a trumpet is also a call
[11:17] to worship
[11:18] oh praise god for this last day
[11:22] called to worship to worship him
[11:25] in spirit and in truth not a one-sided
[11:29] worship
[11:30] not an unbalanced worship not
[11:33] fleshly worship with strange fire
[11:36] but my friends genuine worship
[11:39] where jesus said that we must worship
[11:42] him
[11:43] and the father seeks us to worship him
[11:46] that will worship him in spirit
[11:50] and also in the truth there's a lot of
[11:53] worshipping in the spirit
[11:55] a lot of emotions a lot of running
[11:58] around
[11:59] a lot of speaking in towns worshiping in
[12:01] the spirit
[12:02] but also friends we need to
[12:05] worship him in the truth then on the
[12:09] other hand
[12:10] there are many that have received the
[12:12] message of the messenger
[12:14] and they are worshiping in the truth
[12:17] but with a hardly any spirit hardly any
[12:21] spirit
[12:22] any kind of life to them but just an
[12:25] emotionless
[12:26] uh one that has no real
[12:30] revelation upon it no fire has fallen
[12:33] upon that truth
[12:34] no fire has fallen upon the altar and
[12:37] therefore
[12:38] they worshipping me in the truth but
[12:40] without the spirit
[12:42] but a real genuine balance worship
[12:45] is to worship god in spirit
[12:49] and in truth thanks be to god hallelujah
[12:53] also the voice like a trumpet
[12:56] a trumpet sound is
[12:59] also a call to arms it's a
[13:02] call to let you know we are about
[13:06] to be engaged in a war i have heard that
[13:09] voice
[13:10] i hope you have and we know that we
[13:14] are not called to a picnic or to a
[13:16] barbecue
[13:17] or to a church potluck supper but we are
[13:20] called to fight against not against
[13:24] flesh and blood
[13:25] but against principalities powers
[13:28] spiritual wickedness in high places
[13:31] and thanks be to god we have the victory
[13:35] before we have already before the war is
[13:38] even over
[13:39] we are assured we have the victory for
[13:42] we are more than conquerors
[13:46] through him that loved us praise be to
[13:49] god
[13:50] hallelujah now i'd like to make an
[13:52] observation
[13:54] that if john was in the spirit
[13:57] or when john was in the spirit
[14:00] and he was transported into the future
[14:05] and john city heard a voice behind him
[14:09] now if he heard the voice behind him
[14:13] speaking then the voice that john
[14:16] heard was the voice
[14:19] of the lord jesus christ speaking to
[14:24] all of the church ages all
[14:27] of the ages of the church
[14:30] and giving to each messenger his
[14:33] message for each church age
[14:37] so john being in the future
[14:40] but hearing the voice behind him
[14:44] could hear the voice of jesus christ
[14:47] speaking to the church ages
[14:51] speaking first of all to the patriarchs
[14:55] way back in the old testament
[14:59] he heard the voice the same voice
[15:02] this voice of melchizedek that spoke to
[15:06] abraham the voice that spoke to
[15:09] job all of the patriots that same
[15:13] voice he heard it speaking to the
[15:16] prophets
[15:17] and through the prophets and then
[15:20] that voice we began to hear it
[15:23] speaking in the new cup under the new
[15:26] covenant
[15:27] to the seven messengers
[15:30] of the seven church ages hearing that
[15:34] trumpet voice behind him
[15:36] through all of these ages
[15:39] so i can say he heard the voice of
[15:42] history
[15:44] he heard the voice of experience praise
[15:47] god hallelujah oh glory to god
[15:51] and then he must have heard the voice
[15:55] voice in revelation 19 i believe
[15:59] where he said and i heard the voice
[16:03] amen after the voices in heaven had said
[16:06] for the marriage of the lamb is
[16:08] come and the wife was made herself ready
[16:11] he said he heard the voices say amen
[16:15] hallelujah and then voices like
[16:19] thundering waters oh glory to god
[16:22] hallelujah it's the voice of god the
[16:25] very voice of god
[16:27] with the bible says break at the cedars
[16:30] in lebanon
[16:31] the voice of god hallelujah that roars
[16:35] like a lion
[16:36] the voice of god the bible says psalm 40
[16:39] verse 6
[16:40] that he spoke and the earth moved
[16:43] it trembled at the voice of the living
[16:46] god hallelujah
[16:47] and john was hearing this voice
[16:50] behind them this very voice that made
[16:54] the
[16:54] earth heave and move and tremble
[16:57] at the voice of god and it will in the
[17:00] future
[17:01] at the time of the judgment the voice of
[17:04] god
[17:05] will cause the rocks to break and try to
[17:08] hide themselves but
[17:10] none can hide from the trumpet voice
[17:13] of jesus christ this is the same voice
[17:16] that said to the deaf the blind the
[17:20] lame the dead speak to them
[17:23] rise take up your bed and walk that
[17:26] same voice that trumpet voice which the
[17:29] bible said he lifted up his voice and
[17:32] said
[17:32] lazarus come forth that very voice is
[17:36] the voice
[17:37] that will be heard at the day of the
[17:40] resurrection
[17:41] when he said the lazarus is as much as
[17:44] if he
[17:45] will say to us come forth hallelujah
[17:48] and all the dead that died in the lord
[17:52] will come forth he was just
[17:55] demonstrating
[17:56] that he is the resurrection and the life
[18:00] and at the sound of his voice it gives
[18:03] life to even dead things and bring
[18:06] things to life and so the dead
[18:09] will come back to life in the
[18:12] resurrection by the trumpet
[18:15] voice of jesus christ the living god
[18:18] hallelujah
[18:20] i want to say yet also
[18:24] he heard that voice of many waters
[18:27] and that was the voice of the people of
[18:29] god
[18:30] in other words it was living voices
[18:34] but we will speak of that praise god
[18:36] hallelujah
[18:38] it calls you to attention something
[18:40] important
[18:41] is about to comfort pay attention
[18:44] pay attention to the word of god shake
[18:47] yourself
[18:48] out of your stupor and come to yourself
[18:51] and recognize that it's god speaking
[18:54] by his word it's an urgent call
[18:57] to pay attention to god's word god's
[19:01] word comes sometimes startlingly
[19:03] to shake us to awareness and to awaken
[19:07] us to his presence to recognize him
[19:10] in our day and in our time praise god
[19:14] hallelujah
[19:15] then if the trumpet voice was sounding
[19:18] forth like that to john
[19:21] and john was in the future
[19:24] when he was hearing that voice then he
[19:27] was hearing the voice of prophecy
[19:30] it was prophecy and he was hearing
[19:34] this voice which was not only the voice
[19:36] of the resurrection
[19:38] but the voice of prophecy the
[19:41] word of prophecy and by being
[19:44] having that prophecy being told
[19:48] to john who is a type of the bride
[19:52] or of the wife of christ it was god
[19:56] allowing john to be come
[19:59] or john a type of the bride to be aware
[20:03] of what is to come and by being aware
[20:08] of what is to come in the future
[20:11] john could be prepared also
[20:14] for what is to come thanks be the god
[20:17] that god never leaves his people without
[20:21] a witness
[20:22] god never takes anyone to judgment
[20:25] without first giving them a warning
[20:29] and thanks be to god it's written
[20:32] in the book hallelujah and blessed are
[20:35] your eyes that's
[20:36] it blessed are your ears that
[20:39] hear the word of god and the voice of
[20:42] god
[20:43] in these last days listen revelation
[20:46] chapter 1 verse 11
[20:49] i am alpha and omega
[20:53] the first and the last what thou seest
[20:58] write in a book and send it
[21:01] onto the seven churches which
[21:04] are in asia under ephesus on the smyrna
[21:08] on the bergamos onto tarot onto sardis
[21:12] onto philadelphia and antolio
[21:16] praise god he is the first and he is the
[21:20] last
[21:20] he is same on the beginning of all
[21:22] things and i am the finality of
[21:26] all things i am the author
[21:29] and i am the finisher after all
[21:32] everything else has passed away back
[21:35] into nothingness
[21:36] he remained standing firm for he is our
[21:40] god who change it not the author and
[21:44] the finisher of our faith glory to god
[21:47] hallelujah
[21:48] the one true god the one true and only
[21:52] god
[21:53] whose name is jesus christ for the
[21:56] word god only means object of worship
[22:00] and lots of people like to say oh god
[22:02] said this god told me that which god
[22:05] there are many gods many lords but there
[22:07] is only
[22:08] one true god and his name is
[22:12] the lord jesus christ hallelujah
[22:15] so the voice of the word of god
[22:19] speaking to john hallelujah meaning to
[22:22] let him know
[22:24] not just prophecies at the end but truth
[22:26] is at hand
[22:27] reality is at hand the unfailing reality
[22:31] of the living god is at hand so pay
[22:33] attention
[22:34] to the word of god what a thing what an
[22:37] experience
[22:38] to be in the spirit caught up by the
[22:41] spirit of god
[22:43] and to be in the presence of the lord
[22:46] under the anointing waiting in his
[22:48] presence
[22:49] and to hear from the lord himself
[22:53] listen listen to the instructions to
[22:56] john
[22:56] three full instruction
[23:00] what thou seest
[23:03] first of all john was to see
[23:06] these things were done for him to see
[23:09] not only meaning that john should be to
[23:12] be there to observe
[23:14] or to spectate but he was to
[23:17] understand he was to visibly see
[23:21] and inwardly to understand
[23:25] what god was saying to him and in
[23:28] type what god was saying to the entire
[23:32] church of all ages first he had to see
[23:36] and secondly god said what thou see us
[23:39] right john was supposed to
[23:42] write right in this marvelous
[23:46] book of revelation hallelujah that's the
[23:50] second command
[23:51] what does yes cs write and then he said
[23:55] send it
[23:56] unto the churches praise god well
[23:59] some of those churches not just
[24:02] the the uh churches that were there
[24:06] at the time that uh held the
[24:10] character of the ages that were to come
[24:14] but that also has a double meaning
[24:17] of going to those churches at that time
[24:21] yeah around the asia minor of praise god
[24:25] and this it also means that
[24:28] that letter that john wrote which is
[24:31] this book of revelation
[24:33] is supposed to go to the
[24:36] churches even in history or the future
[24:41] at the time when john was there which
[24:43] means to us
[24:45] and here we are reading out of the book
[24:48] of revelation
[24:50] those very things that john was
[24:53] commanded by the divine inspiration
[24:56] and anointing to write within the book
[25:00] oh blessed be the name of the lord glory
[25:02] to his holy name
[25:04] my friends how marvel it is to know that
[25:06] that great
[25:07] voice of god that sounded off the word
[25:11] of god
[25:12] in the garden of eden to adam and
[25:15] eve glory to god when they came
[25:18] down and had a gospel meeting
[25:22] fellowship with god sitting down
[25:25] and god speaking to his children in the
[25:29] evening
[25:30] time that voice will once more
[25:33] be heard in the land the voice of the
[25:36] turtle dove
[25:37] heard in the land once again the queen
[25:41] of the great dove of peace oh
[25:44] the wings of a snow white dove
[25:47] god sent down this pure sweet love
[25:51] a sign from above oh praise god
[25:55] on the wings of a dove oh glory to his
[25:58] god
[25:58] what a what a place of rest to be what a
[26:01] place of
[26:02] peace to be under the wings of the great
[26:05] snow white
[26:06] dove of god hallelujah that voice that
[26:09] spoke
[26:10] of peace that voice that spoke
[26:12] fellowship
[26:13] that sports that spoke redemption to
[26:16] them
[26:17] in the garden of eden that same voice
[26:20] roared upon the mountain of sinai
[26:24] speaking with thunders and thundering on
[26:26] lightnings and judgments of the living
[26:29] god
[26:29] and commandments oh my god that voice
[26:33] the same voice
[26:34] it spoke there oh glory to god but
[26:37] thanks be to god
[26:39] there was an age of grace coming and we
[26:42] heard the same voice again
[26:44] upon the mount transfiguration speaking
[26:48] grace
[26:49] grace grace that hip stone
[26:52] which is jesus christ crying out
[26:55] grace grace grace mercy
[26:59] pardon hallelujah for he was the
[27:03] fulfillment of that headstone
[27:06] that that that cornerstone that would
[27:09] come forth in zion
[27:10] crying of grace grace grace
[27:13] and that great that great stone
[27:18] this great person jesus christ upon the
[27:21] monk transfiguration
[27:23] was conformed by the voice saying this
[27:26] is my beloved son hear
[27:30] ye him why he is the word so hear what
[27:34] the word of god is saying
[27:36] and the word speaks not judgment
[27:39] but us back there and commandments but
[27:42] grace
[27:43] mercy pardon freedom liberty redemption
[27:48] oh praise god unto him who
[27:52] washed us and loosed us from
[27:55] from our sins in his own blood unto him
[27:58] with praise
[27:59] and honor and glory forever
[28:03] and forever blessed be the name of the
[28:06] lord god
[28:07] oh that voice that was heard in the
[28:09] excellent
[28:10] glory in the presence of god is again
[28:14] sending forth praise god but it's
[28:17] sounding forth
[28:18] within this seven church
[28:21] ages at that time oh praise god
[28:25] hallelujah
[28:26] and up and from that time and you know
[28:30] the seven church ages if you do not know
[28:33] came from john's time paul's time
[28:37] when paul was as the main messenger
[28:40] of the ephesians church age which later
[28:43] on we will take
[28:44] them individually and begin to teach
[28:48] upon them
[28:49] their implications what their
[28:51] confirmations their vindications
[28:54] whatever it is that they are expressing
[28:57] and type
[28:58] and in reality we will try to
[29:01] make it clear as taught by the holy
[29:03] spirit
[29:04] through the prophet of god in this
[29:07] end time praise god hallelujah and we
[29:11] know we're at the final part of these
[29:13] church ages
[29:14] for we are now living in the age of
[29:17] laodicea
[29:18] we are now living in the last church age
[29:24] there are no more church ages for the
[29:27] gentiles
[29:28] after this as i have said before
[29:31] after the gentile seasons of time
[29:35] and dispensations are over
[29:38] it all is now beginning to return
[29:42] back to our jewish brethren to welcome
[29:45] the
[29:46] coming of their king hallelujah
[29:49] so that voice is sending forth again to
[29:52] these seven churches
[29:54] oh praise god and the seven churches
[29:58] as some of you will know in the form of
[30:01] the pyramid
[30:02] it expresses and types and
[30:05] shows the fullness and finality
[30:10] of the person of the lord jesus christ
[30:14] himself and it gives us an
[30:17] insight into the final the
[30:21] and final revelation of jesus christ
[30:24] to his church in these last days praise
[30:29] be to god listen to god write the
[30:32] visions
[30:32] john write divisions
[30:36] make a record of them
[30:39] make this record for the ages that
[30:42] are to follow for john was in the spirit
[30:46] spiritually physically john
[30:50] was in the ephesian church age
[30:53] john was in the ephesian church age and
[30:56] so
[30:57] god is saying right john
[31:00] for the ages not only for your age
[31:04] but for all the other church ages
[31:07] that are to come for these
[31:10] are true prophecies and they will
[31:13] surely come to pass we know god's word
[31:17] must surely come to pass
[31:19] for heaven and earth will pass away but
[31:22] my
[31:23] word will never pass away so john
[31:26] write them first of all see what i'm
[31:29] saying
[31:30] write them and send them making
[31:33] them known to the people praise god
[31:36] hallelujah
[31:38] so that they can know and be prepared
[31:41] and be aware
[31:42] of what is to happen what is to take
[31:45] place
[31:45] in their day and in their time
[31:49] that they will have at least a general
[31:51] awareness
[31:53] of the nature of their age of some of
[31:55] the activities
[31:56] that will be taking place in their age
[31:59] and so on
[32:00] so that the church of god is left
[32:04] with awareness prophecy
[32:07] modern events being made clear
[32:10] by the fulfillment and the vindication
[32:13] of prophecy in our day so that we may
[32:16] recognize our day and the message
[32:20] that god sent for our day praise be to
[32:23] god
[32:24] and just as much as the bible tells us
[32:27] john recognize the voice
[32:29] oh praise god if you're a son a daughter
[32:33] a
[32:33] child of god you will also
[32:36] recognize that voice for as you know
[32:40] in the book of john i believe it's
[32:42] chapter
[32:43] 15 he says my sheep hear my voice
[32:47] my sheep know my voice that oh praise
[32:50] god if you are a seed son oh
[32:54] a certified seed son and daughter and
[32:57] child of god
[32:58] then my brother sister you will know
[33:02] the voice of god you will recognize that
[33:05] voice
[33:06] and in closing you may say brother simon
[33:08] how am i going to
[33:10] recognize a voice like that oh will you
[33:13] ask
[33:13] a baby how will it recognize
[33:17] its mother's voice does the baby need
[33:20] theology
[33:21] does the baby need to have an education
[33:25] before it knows how to recognize it
[33:28] its parents voice it does so
[33:31] by what god already placed in it the
[33:34] ability
[33:35] god placed an ability in that child
[33:38] before it was even born to recognize the
[33:42] voice of his parent and even so within
[33:45] the heart of
[33:46] a believer before the foundation of the
[33:49] world
[33:50] god placed that innate ability
[33:53] that inspiration to recognize
[33:57] the voice of your heavenly parent praise
[34:01] god hallelujah so here we are being
