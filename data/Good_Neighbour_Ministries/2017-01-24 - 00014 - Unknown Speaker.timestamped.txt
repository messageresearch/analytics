[0:00] together with the world and so I
[0:02] preached that back there and my God
[0:05] confusion tell me I'm trying to tell him
[0:08] not born again and all this Stu like
[0:10] that thrown out almost beaten up by
[0:13] another one there in Detroit my Lord
[0:16] wouldn't even see me out the door but
[0:19] praise God I'm still here
[0:22] today by the grace of God and I see most
[0:24] of them have come around in a big circle
[0:27] and beginning to understand um that amen
[0:31] praise the Lord so that's the way it is
[0:33] praise God hallelujah amen now he says
[0:38] now we know in this last
[0:41] days many of these churches and
[0:45] people they
[0:47] believe in a carnal
[0:51] way they believe you can't tell them
[0:53] they don't believe they're doing Bible
[0:55] studies they're reading the Bible they
[0:57] can even put up graphics and graphs and
[0:59] everything else better than you can is
[1:01] that
[1:02] right and they do
[1:05] that he says but you see
[1:08] what is
[1:11] that they are in the last days they're
[1:15] going to impersonate the real spirit
[1:20] this is what he say they're going to
[1:22] impersonate the real script the
[1:25] spirit they'll pick up a certain
[1:28] scripture and that that man will make
[1:31] take that scripture and make it live new
[1:34] make it live exactly what it promised
[1:36] here in the
[1:37] Bible another man will see him do that
[1:41] and he'll come around and try to do it
[1:44] and it won't be the same I hope you're
[1:47] reading between the lines Why one has
[1:52] the scripture and the spirit with him
[1:55] but the other one the scripture is not
[1:59] inspired
[2:00] by the spirit
[2:01] to amen they got the same qu same Bible
[2:06] same
[2:07] book but
[2:09] one saying the same thing the other one
[2:11] saying the same thing but it's inspired
[2:13] to one and not inspired to the other one
[2:16] we don't want to go back to Canan and
[2:17] come up the Book of Genesis of the rainb
[2:20] back again but you can follow that
[2:21] yourself in your own
[2:23] mind one's uh one's one's gift one's
[2:27] offering is accepted and the other one
[2:29] is not
[2:31] it's as simple as that he says what is
[2:33] it you see he's trying to act that way
[2:37] you can even do the same thing Jesus
[2:40] said it it's just like jer's and jam
[2:43] with stood Moses it's the same thing
[2:46] it's happening again today see they
[2:50] believe but they believe in a carnal way
[2:54] amen and that spirit in these last days
[2:59] will go to impersonate the real
[3:03] spirit and that's where your real
[3:06] trouble is coming from right that's what
[3:10] I'm talking about the message settled
[3:12] down now the prophets of God everybody
[3:14] got the books we all got to take and
[3:17] everybody say oh we all the same yeah
[3:20] Ally yeah we all the same but yes sir
[3:23] you got the word but it's not word
[3:26] insired or revealed the way should be
[3:29] revealed he amen hallelujah he says
[3:32] people come up to me and say I got the
[3:34] Holy Ghost too but look at the way they
[3:40] live the way they live don't last from
[3:43] even one Revival to
[3:46] another doesn't even last from the one
[3:49] meeting to another it's all made
[3:51] manifest the haveen
[3:53] God for man's born of the spirit of God
[3:56] and I'm winding up now or a woman they
[3:59] have the fruits of the spirit amen they
[4:02] walk Godly yes and they live that life
[4:06] amen uh I'm going to add a little piece
[4:08] here it's not here in that quote but he
[4:11] says a sheep doesn't have to work up
[4:14] itself to Bear wo so if it's a genuine
[4:17] sheep it automatically Bears amen is
[4:21] that right me I don't have a piece of
[4:23] here because I don't look I'm not
[4:25] looking too much like a sheep right so
[4:27] you going to add on a piece you going to
[4:29] try to work harder to be a Christian no
[4:32] he says just in the word live amen is
[4:35] that right amen one BL he say I don't
[4:38] how a black cow eat green grass and
[4:41] produce white
[4:42] milk is that right all the to do is in
[4:45] the
[4:46] grass I don't have to explain it I don't
[4:49] have to know how God do all that stuff
[4:51] like that I don't need to know the
[4:53] mystery of we don't have to know the
[4:55] mystery of this and the Mystery of that
[4:57] no all you got to do is feed on revealed
[5:00] word of God Amen and it will work out
[5:03] your salvation it will work in you
[5:06] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen
[5:09] amen I go to I I almost started
[5:11] preaching there I'm teaching but I
[5:13] almost start preaching talking about the
[5:15] word we'll work it out because we'll
[5:17] start to purge and all kinds of other
[5:19] stuff start coming to me there that we
[5:20] can just preach a nice little
[5:23] message in there praise the Lord let me
[5:26] wind this up here see they keep keep
[5:30] away from the things of the world not
[5:33] because the Bible tells you separate
[5:35] yourself from
[5:36] unbelief and so you a sister or a
[5:39] brother that you heard did did something
[5:41] you're sitting in the que and they sit
[5:43] beside you and you start to slightly
[5:45] leave this way for what you going to
[5:48] catch
[5:49] something is there some virus going
[5:52] around like that that you going to catch
[5:54] no praise the Lord Jesus didn't think
[5:57] something wrong to go sit by the well
[5:58] and wait
[6:01] so that he could speak the word into her
[6:03] soul she he knew that she was a part of
[6:06] him that need to be revealed and to
[6:09] recognize who she really was she was
[6:11] under delusion of the devil thinking
[6:13] that she was supposed to be living the
[6:16] life she was reveal no that's not your
[6:19] real life this is your real life amen
[6:21] praise the Lord hallelujah back there I
[6:25] mean David drank from The Well of
[6:26] Bethlehem and he say you think you're
[6:28] drinking from Jacob's Well that's not
[6:31] not the well need to be drinken from
[6:34] that well is only natural thirst for a
[6:36] little while come back to the again you
[6:38] drink from this well never again praise
[6:42] the name of the Lord hallelujah amen see
[6:45] they keep away from the things of the
[6:47] world it's God moving in
[6:51] them God moves in them and makes himself
[6:56] manifest and proves that he is God
[6:59] working in there and the other one is
[7:04] really
[7:05] impersonating
[7:07] Christianity impersonating the message
[7:11] in the message impersonating the
[7:13] message it's not this wicked people and
[7:16] they go out there deliberately to go do
[7:19] it but they're trying to do the same
[7:22] thing the genuine believer is doing
[7:24] without the gine holy spirit amen is
[7:27] that right you Beat It Down by
[7:31] music you can't bring it up by Bible
[7:35] study it has to be real and gine and
[7:38] then speaks for itself is that right
[7:41] praise the Lord for it's God moving in
[7:44] them and making themselves manifest
[7:47] that's how you going to overcome because
[7:49] it's not you other plac he said they
[7:51] think many times they're going to speak
[7:54] evil against you he said but they think
[7:56] it's you they're speaking evil against
[7:57] it's not you amen he that is in you
[8:01] because they don't understand your
[8:03] action why because we are not of this
[8:06] world Amen and we are not acting like
[8:09] the people of this world and when you
[8:12] don't act like the people of this world
[8:14] and you don't get into their system and
[8:16] their way the world system is
[8:19] selfishness and you're not selfish
[8:22] am the world system is
[8:25] Revenge and you don't have anything like
[8:27] that to do
[8:29] and many of these other things and they
[8:31] can see the difference and they want to
[8:34] know why in the world you're not Jing
[8:37] fighting claing cursing swearing caring
[8:41] on uh misbehaving participating with
[8:44] everything they're doing you know you're
[8:47] a devil on a on a on a Friday night and
[8:50] a Saturday night and a saint on a Sunday
[8:53] morning they find out that no this guy
[8:56] is a Christian every single day
[9:00] is that right that's right but he just
[9:02] ordinary guy he not going like one of
[9:05] these really super spiritual super
[9:07] natural on you know like that he's just
[9:09] regular gu like me praise God amen
[9:12] hallelujah amen oh you guys are drinking
[9:15] give me an orange
[9:17] juice That's Right Said brother
[9:20] compromising what was Jesus doing s
[9:23] those guys that were drinking the wine
[9:25] why didn't think they call him a wine B
[9:27] cuz he was sitting there while they
[9:29] drinking wine and then he gives them out
[9:31] talk to
[9:32] them but I had to tell one brother I
[9:35] said the reason why you upset is because
[9:38] you're not confident in your
[9:39] Christianity you think that the smell of
[9:40] the wi will draw you
[9:43] back right and and that's why you don't
[9:46] even want not that they going to want to
[9:48] walk into a situation like that but I'm
[9:50] saying if you're found in that situation
[9:52] don't go
[9:54] acting like you Scorn the people and
[9:56] this going on and your relative drinking
[9:59] not the drun and
[10:01] all that's the old
[10:04] message to go amen you just grab your
[10:08] juice and drink your juice and enjoy
[10:10] your juice and talk to them
[10:12] amen and the walls are going to fall
[10:15] that's right amen and you going to have
[10:17] a better opportunity glory to share what
[10:20] is in your heart amen praise the Lord
[10:22] amen I hope you're blessed amen the Lord
[10:25] bless you tonight praise the Lord let's
[10:28] all stand word of pra
[10:32] the Le k for the spirit his life I can
[10:36] say whatever I want unless the Holy
[10:38] Spirit comes to give life to what I'm
[10:41] telling you what I am saying will kill
[10:44] you is that right but if the spirit is
[10:47] here and he
[10:50] anoints the word anoints the most holy
[10:54] then that word will come to life in you
[10:58] praise God the let K but the spirit
[11:03] gives it life think about it throw this
[11:06] in you can think about the rest of the
[11:08] week the same thought is what he tried
[11:11] to share many many ways in the message
[11:13] when he talks about the
[11:14] gasoline and the spark from the from the
[11:18] spark CL you can have all the gas you
[11:21] want the letter
[11:23] kills but the spirit gives it
[11:27] life Spirit has to come to Quicken the
[11:30] word for the hour glory to God
[11:34] hallelujah our gracious Heavenly Father
[11:37] we thank you for these that are here
[11:40] tonight I fully understand their
[11:44] sacrifice and the courage it takes to
[11:48] come and be in the presence of
[11:51] God we and tired in their physical body
[11:55] sometimes we in their
[11:57] mind sometimes their backed into a
[11:59] corner by the
[12:01] devil and yet they realize that being in
[12:05] the house of God is the source of their
[12:07] strength
[12:09] Hall and the place for them to have
[12:13] spiritual
[12:14] recovery so I praise them Father and I
[12:19] admire them for their strength and their
[12:22] courage and for their
[12:25] perseverance and for their desperation
[12:28] [Music]
[12:31] help us and strengthen us everyone for
[12:34] the greatest temptation is what to
[12:36] forsake the assembling to together as
[12:39] the manner of sist more that we see the
[12:42] day
[12:44] approaching draw us closer to you father
[12:47] and as we read the Bible and go back and
[12:50] reread the messages and listen to the
[12:52] text again we ask that you inspire the
[12:55] word with our hearts and our ears like
[12:57] we've never heard it before
[13:01] let's
