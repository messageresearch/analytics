[0:05] [Music]
[0:19] goodnight folks
[0:21] I beloved brethren it's wonderful to be
[0:26] together again we live in a marvelous
[0:29] time much is happening and then you are
[0:34] there Here I am we're just in our homes
[0:39] by ourselves we're passing through the
[0:43] wilderness and it's a testing time a
[0:47] time when God tests us after our
[0:51] faithfulness to him and his word as of
[0:57] tonight I will begin this study on the
[1:04] seven churches
[1:07] I will begin tonight starting on page 12
[1:15] of the church age book you may find that
[1:20] while I'm yet making my comments now
[1:26] next this coming Sunday I will speak on
[1:31] the second part of the Spirit quickens
[1:35] the word actually the Spirit quickens
[1:39] the word to the elect of the age in
[1:43] which we are living in so that will be
[1:48] the approach on Sunday morning but for
[1:53] tonight's lesson let us pray and read
[2:01] out of the book of Revelation chapter 1
[2:06] verses 1 to 3 Lord Jesus we thank you
[2:14] for another day you've kept your people
[2:19] thus far safe covered by the blood
[2:22] protected by your love mercy and grace
[2:26] take all the praise all the honor and
[2:30] the glory father we give all that we are
[2:34] and all that we have
[2:36] we surrender it to You Father forgive us
[2:41] of our sins cleanse us by the precious
[2:44] blood and make us fit for service both
[2:49] hearers and speaker and in all of this
[2:54] father may you be glorified we ask it in
[2:58] the name of Jesus Christ give us the
[3:01] understanding of the word as we read it
[3:05] Lord in Jesus name Amen and amen
[3:09] no the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[3:16] God gave unto him to show unto his
[3:21] servants things which must shortly come
[3:26] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[3:33] his angel unto his servant John who bare
[3:39] record of the word of God and of the
[3:43] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[3:48] things that he saw blessed is he that
[3:52] readeth and they that hear the words of
[3:56] this prophecy and keep those things
[3:59] which are written therein for the time
[4:04] is at hand blessed be the name of the
[4:08] Lord thank you Jesus now let us commence
[4:15] we understand looking into the seven
[4:19] churches page 12 beginning from page 12
[4:22] let the scribe not the author
[4:28] of this book is st. John the Divine that
[4:32] is clear who is the scribe
[4:37] john is a scribe he is not the author
[4:41] now bring that to our day in our day we
[4:46] have received a revelation by the Word
[4:51] of God and we understand that this crane
[4:55] not the author this speaker of the
[4:59] spoken word not the author is brother
[5:04] William Marion Branham God used him to
[5:09] be the scribe pick up your pen and write
[5:13] God use him to be the speaker to voice
[5:17] that he might use him and the Spirit of
[5:21] God might speak through the Prophet to
[5:24] bring the Word of God to our age that we
[5:28] might know these things for God's glory
[5:33] now for the writing of this book he was
[5:37] placed on the Isle of Patmos I will not
[5:41] make any commentary on that now but we
[5:45] understand that this of course is not
[5:49] John's life story the book of Revelation
[5:56] is not the ruminations of a sick man
[6:05] this book of Revelation is not the
[6:12] hallucinations of a man suffering from
[6:18] colic because of over eating this book
[6:26] of Revelation is a book where while we
[6:32] were yet studying it the Bible says
[6:34] you're already blessed just to read it
[6:37] and blessed is he
[6:40] they understand it it's a marvelous and
[6:44] wonderful book now the third thing is
[6:49] that this book of Revelation is not the
[6:52] biography of John the Revelator it is
[7:02] the revelation of Jesus Christ himself
[7:08] his works all his plans and the things
[7:15] that would come to pass in the future
[7:20] ages of John's time of course referring
[7:24] to our time and the times that are yet
[7:29] to unfold like the rapture the
[7:35] tribulation the hundred and forty-four
[7:38] thousand the the third temple the the
[7:44] restoration of the red heifer the
[7:48] sacrifice of atonement all these things
[7:52] are they Armageddon and so on all those
[7:55] things are written and in this book so
[7:59] blessed is he that readeth and
[8:03] understand it what is in the book even
[8:06] if a person reads this book with no
[8:09] understanding they're still blessed and
[8:11] then if they have an understanding
[8:13] they're even more blessed so it is very
[8:17] important that we read this book and
[8:22] understand it by the precious Holy
[8:25] Spirit now this book of Revelation is a
[8:28] book of prophecy let us understand that
[8:32] clearly that it is a book of prophecy
[8:37] let me cook now the book is usually
[8:42] termed a revelation of st. John but that
[8:46] is incorrect it is the revelation of
[8:49] Jesus Christ given to John
[8:51] for Christians of all ages who wasn't
[8:55] given for for Christians of all ages
[8:59] which means this book is meant for you
[9:03] just look book is meant for us we should
[9:07] receive it in our hearts with great
[9:10] delight in this day and in this out now
[9:15] it's the last book in our Bible it's the
[9:19] last book in our Bible
[9:21] but yet it tells the beginning and the
[9:25] ending of the entire gospel the
[9:30] dispensations of the gospel right from
[9:34] Genesis right through the various ages
[9:37] of the patriarchal age in the age of law
[9:41] and the age of plants and the age of
[9:46] prophecy right on them it comes right to
[9:49] us in listening and in this time where
[9:53] we break into the seven ages of the
[9:58] church of the Gentile the dispensation
[10:02] now the this word revelation in the
[10:07] Greek is apocalypsis in other words an
[10:10] apocalypse which is to say an unveiling
[10:14] and uncovering revealing something that
[10:21] was previously hidden it's uncovering
[10:25] the revelation of the person of Jesus
[10:29] Christ and of his future works in the
[10:33] oncoming 7 Church ages at that time
[10:37] today we are standing physically in the
[10:43] last church age so John looked from the
[10:48] eye of Patmos under the anointing of the
[10:51] Holy Spirit and saw through the ages and
[10:57] years of time he saw this age and right
[11:03] to the
[11:04] and beyond our age John even saw the
[11:09] things that were going to be and all of
[11:13] the future works that were going to come
[11:17] John saw it all
[11:19] now notice carefully let me give you a
[11:22] quotation from brother Branham and is
[11:26] this the sign of the answer page 62 what
[11:31] uh a mystery he's speaking about a
[11:34] mystery and I'd like to say it what is a
[11:38] revelation a revelation is a mysteries
[11:43] scripture or previously hidden truth now
[11:49] divinely revealed which is a
[11:53] supernatural element still remains
[11:58] despite the revelation praise be to God
[12:03] hallelujah no we see friends that some
[12:07] truths that was hidden now revealed in
[12:12] our wonderful time
[12:15] thanks God hallelujah so here we see
[12:20] clearly in the Word of God the
[12:24] importance of Revelation to the true
[12:27] believer it cannot be over emphasized
[12:32] and revelation means more to us than we
[12:36] have realized
[12:38] prior to this prophet coming and making
[12:42] it clear to us so I'm not he said I'm
[12:47] not talking about the book of Revelation
[12:49] I'm talking about all revelation it's
[12:54] tremendously important to the church see
[12:59] oh oh you must realize that revelation
[13:04] is the key to understanding the entire
[13:07] Bible no wonder he said I all the key of
[13:11] David I shuttin no man opens I open
[13:17] no man can shuttle let me repeat the
[13:21] principle and truth of Revelation is the
[13:27] foundation for the understanding of the
[13:31] entire Bible
[13:34] now when Jesus was here he said who do
[13:38] you say I know son of man and who do you
[13:42] say I am and one they gave the opinions
[13:46] of men rather than their by the spirit
[13:51] of Revelation going into the Word of God
[13:54] catching the application bringing it
[13:58] back and saying oh you are the seed of
[14:02] the woman or you were the ram caught in
[14:06] the thicket of our or to catch the
[14:09] relation or you are buaas here I can see
[14:13] you pictured in in such-and-such you you
[14:16] see but they went by the opinions of men
[14:21] they said some say as we will say in our
[14:25] time the people say some say let you are
[14:31] Isaiah the prophet and others say you
[14:39] are Jeremias or one of the prophets and
[14:43] he says that's good people's opinions
[14:47] anyone can get their opinions about this
[14:49] Bible about this Word of God what they
[14:53] think and you can have schools that were
[14:56] founded on the basis of train to
[14:59] investigate penetrate and interpret what
[15:02] this Bible is all about whom do you but
[15:07] he asked the question not men's opinions
[15:09] or any colleges from the seminaries from
[15:12] the universities from their higher
[15:15] institutions of learning or from the
[15:18] rabbis or or whatever not who do people
[15:22] say I am he says but who do you you
[15:26] personally say that I am right so
[15:30] revelation is a personal thing God
[15:33] dealing with individuals God loves to
[15:37] deal with us as individual and when we
[15:41] come together each with his individual
[15:45] revelation in union and in harmony
[15:49] then it's the restoration of his
[15:52] wonderful body and all of the Godhead
[15:57] brought back into unity for his glory
[16:01] amen so here he says but who say he that
[16:07] I am then rose up rough fisherman Peter
[16:14] and he says thou art the Christ the Son
[16:20] of the Living God and jesus answered and
[16:23] said unto him blessed art thou simon
[16:26] barjona for flesh and blood has not
[16:30] revealed this unto you but my father
[16:34] which is in heaven has revealed this on
[16:37] you thou art Peter and upon this rock I
[16:41] will build my church and the gates of
[16:45] Hell will not prevail against it oh
[16:49] praise God for evermore you see these
[16:54] disciples were influenced by the
[16:56] opinions of man we should not be
[17:00] influenced by the opinions of men are
[17:04] coming out of their colleges their Bible
[17:07] schools keep your eyes up on the world
[17:10] keep your eyes on Jesus and ask God for
[17:13] wisdom for understanding and for
[17:16] revelation if there is something in the
[17:20] Word of God you do not understand
[17:23] something in the message that's not
[17:25] clear to you go to God and prayer and
[17:28] ask God to open up the word which is
[17:32] himself to reveal himself to reveal his
[17:36] word to you that you might know him in
[17:39] the power of
[17:41] his resurrection see no we understand
[17:45] just as it was back there
[17:48] when the question was asked who who do
[17:52] men say I am and they said well some say
[17:56] you Jeremiah some say you're Isaiah's
[17:59] now right down through history and even
[18:02] in our day the Roman Catholics say that
[18:06] the church is built upon Peter now we
[18:11] know that's a carnal interpretation and
[18:15] that God could not build his church on
[18:19] sinking sand he could not build this
[18:22] church in words to say on an unstable
[18:27] man at that time before his conversion
[18:31] he could not be the foundation of God's
[18:35] church so Jesus was not telling them to
[18:41] that his church would be built upon
[18:43] Peter
[18:44] then came the protesters and they said
[18:48] we are sure the church is built on Jesus
[18:52] now watch the Roman Catholics say that
[18:56] is built on Peter of course that's a
[18:58] false opinion that is a false
[19:02] proposition and that is false teaching
[19:06] contrary to the word of God now the
[19:10] Protestants come along and this is
[19:12] history repeating itself and the
[19:15] Protestant opinion proposition and
[19:19] teaching is that the church is built on
[19:22] Jesus but Jesus himself was just the
[19:26] body that God dwelt in and you see so
[19:31] we're not going to discuss that
[19:33] particularly here now but many today the
[19:37] point is that many today are going by
[19:41] the opinions of man and many don't know
[19:45] it thank God for those whose eyes are
[19:49] open and can recognize it in our day
[19:54] now we understand friends that he says
[19:57] that gates of hell shall not prevail
[20:00] against the church and I've taught on
[20:04] this before
[20:05] but you understand there right there we
[20:09] understand we have a marvelous and
[20:11] wonderful promise from this we recognize
[20:15] his prophesy Satan will come against the
[20:19] church Satan will attack the church
[20:21] Satan will do everything to destroy the
[20:24] church Satan will do everything to
[20:26] overcome the church and overcome the
[20:29] entire believer but jesus said that
[20:32] gates of Hell shall not prevail against
[20:36] the church he will try to prevail
[20:39] against the church by by bringing sin to
[20:43] bear you in a gram of sin he will come
[20:46] against the church by bringing the gates
[20:49] of Hell denominationalism opening up
[20:52] their gates to receive you and there
[20:56] you'll find your way into hell see now
[21:00] we understand that he will try to
[21:02] overcome the true church but this
[21:04] promise we must hold to it they it shall
[21:09] not prevail against us because we are
[21:12] more than conquerors through him that
[21:14] loved us with with him with our sight
[21:18] with him in the inside of us we are more
[21:22] than conquerors through him that loved
[21:24] the strength God hallelujah so they're
[21:27] taking men's opinions rather than
[21:31] reading their own Bible and receiving
[21:35] the revelation of God's Word
[21:39] now clearly Jesus said to Peter he says
[21:43] know this it was by revelation read it
[21:48] the way it is written
[21:49] flesh and blood has not revealed it but
[21:54] my father in heaven has revealed it and
[21:58] upon this rock what rock the rock of
[22:02] Revelation the rock of day of the very
[22:06] truth
[22:08] principle scriptural principle of
[22:12] Revelation is what the church will is
[22:16] built on that's what it's melt on it's
[22:19] built on thus saith the Lord God
[22:22] hallelujah
[22:23] now what does the Bible say the
[22:26] foundation of the true church is to be
[22:29] we know the true church is built on the
[22:32] truth and scriptural principle of
[22:36] Revelation take your stand right there
[22:39] that every word of God in this Bible
[22:45] must be revealed to you
[22:47] it's not to be read like a novelist not
[22:51] to be read like a a biography it's not
[22:53] to be read like old history or a book of
[22:57] poetry or a higher learning of
[23:00] literature any of those things but the
[23:04] Bible must be read prayerfully sincerely
[23:09] humbly reverently while asking God for
[23:13] wisdom and revelation for he alone can
[23:18] give you the understanding now the
[23:25] prophet of God speaking
[23:28] how did he'll know what to do in order
[23:34] to offer a proper sacrifice to God
[23:39] Hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 to 3 you'll
[23:44] find there by faith by revelation we
[23:46] understand that the worlds were framed
[23:48] by the Word of God
[23:50] and then it goes on to say by faith Abel
[23:54] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[23:58] Cain see why now the question has been
[24:02] asked how did he offer a more excellent
[24:06] sacrifice why was a sacrifice for
[24:09] excellent let us recognize that there
[24:13] was no written bite at that time there
[24:18] wasn't let me repeat there was no
[24:20] written
[24:21] binded at that time so how did evil know
[24:26] exactly what to offer to God it means
[24:31] that there was a spiritual communication
[24:34] between God and a bells heart and God
[24:41] spoke right into the heart of a bell and
[24:46] revealed made known to him that what he
[24:52] desired was a land and that Lamb of
[24:58] course was a bell was given the
[25:02] understanding that there was a a
[25:05] redeemer with a lamb light nature that
[25:09] was to come
[25:11] so by revelation evil offered a better
[25:17] sacrifice to God see now it's the
[25:22] revelation of God that made the
[25:25] difference in his offering came made an
[25:28] offering - but he had no understanding
[25:30] of what he was supposed to offer he was
[25:36] blind to the understanding of the holy
[25:40] spirit he had no connection he had no
[25:43] real communication he had no no sonship
[25:49] see so anyway the Holy Spirit spoke and
[25:54] revealed to Abel what it was so if I did
[25:58] not have to guess he did not have to go
[26:02] to a school of learning - to presume and
[26:07] to try to penetrate the deep things of
[26:10] God by human skill and by human
[26:13] knowledge by by research and comparing
[26:17] Scripture with Scripture which is all
[26:19] good but revelation comes like a flash
[26:24] of light from the presence of Almighty
[26:26] God knowledge that was previously
[26:30] not sense knowledge not knowledge that
[26:34] can be accumulated by the five senses
[26:38] but revelation knowledge knowledge that
[26:42] comes from God alone wisdom that comes
[26:46] from above and fills the human heart and
[26:50] makes things clear for this day thanks
[26:54] be to God for His marvelous and
[26:56] wonderful grace see know he says Lord
[27:00] clearly hear evil offered a better
[27:06] sacrifice and gave that made a
[27:10] difference and God gave email eternal
[27:16] life
[27:17] they said salvation is by revelation
[27:23] salvation is by revelation no matter the
[27:29] seminary teacher the pastor teaches you
[27:31] God reveals to you that Jesus Christ
[27:34] that Jesus is the Christ that is the
[27:38] blood that cleanses you and God is your
[27:41] Savior you will never have eternal life
[27:44] it's the spiritual revelation that
[27:48] doesn't in other words it's the
[27:50] spiritual revelation that gives you
[27:52] genuine salvation the revelation of
[27:56] Jesus Christ who is the word of God in
[27:58] the beginning was the word the Word was
[28:00] with God and the Word was made flesh the
[28:03] spiritual revelation of him Jesus Christ
[28:07] not just Jesus but Jesus Christ revealed
[28:11] and make clear to you it's what gives
[28:14] you salvation hallelujah now the
[28:19] disciples asked Jesus in the book of
[28:21] Acts Lord I who at this time going to
[28:25] restore the kingdom to Israel see they
[28:29] were taking of an earthly Kingdom they
[28:31] have no understanding no revelation yet
[28:34] that his kingdom was not yet of this
[28:37] world and to a great degree we
[28:40] understand that even Jesus
[28:43] not give them a clear revelation on that
[28:47] because before his revelation he says I
[28:51] don't know what the father has in his
[28:55] mind concerning these things but after
[28:58] his read the resurrection he rose up and
[29:02] he was able to tell them clearly about
[29:06] his ministry his mandatory of ministry
[29:09] oh and the Word of God glorified now the
[29:15] glorified Word of God kid could now make
[29:18] itself clear to these various apostles
[29:23] quotation now the father had not yet
[29:27] revealed it to him but now after his
[29:30] death and resurrection at this
[29:33] particular time in this editorial
[29:35] ministry he is able to set forth here in
[29:39] this revelation of himself and to John
[29:44] what his glory and presence in the
[29:47] church would mean and do hallelujah now
[29:51] what is his glory and presence in the
[29:54] church supposed to do o believers what a
[29:58] revelation do you recognize what I'm
[30:01] saying that you and I and many others
[30:06] have caught this revelation just of that
[30:10] this talk of the glory of his personal
[30:13] presence his presence in the true church
[30:16] what that would do what did it do to you
[30:20] when it was revealed to you that you are
[30:23] his gene you are his attribute and that
[30:26] he was in you and is in you from the for
[30:30] the foundation of the world and puts you
[30:33] in the position that you recognize Jesus
[30:36] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[30:39] forever his power his presence his glory
[30:44] in the church today brother he lives he
[30:48] lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today
[30:52] oh he walks with me and he talks with me
[30:55] all
[30:56] life's wonderful way amen
[30:59] this glorious revelation is what reveals
[31:04] to us and gives to us the authority the
[31:07] power and the boldness and the certainty
[31:10] of who we are so that we have instead of
[31:14] the devil prevailing against you or I
[31:17] are against the church that Church the
[31:20] true church will prevail against him and
[31:24] overcome him by the Word of God and my
[31:27] are testimony to the token blood of
[31:30] Jesus Christ than a sprinkler that has
[31:33] been dubbed upon the doorpost of our
[31:37] hearts where God said I'll pass over you
[31:39] hit man thanks me the God as sons and
[31:43] daughters of the Living God
[31:45] that we can be here tonight looking at
[31:48] the Word of God and saying I can see
[31:50] clearly now because all the darkness is
[31:54] gone the gloom is gone
[31:56] the crowds are gone and I can see Jesus
[31:59] only I cannot see all of these
[32:03] denominational opinions I can't hear the
[32:07] opinions of men anymore I can't hear
[32:10] anymore of the voices in the world all I
[32:13] can hear is a voice of God in these last
[32:17] days speaking to my heart thanks God for
[32:20] evermore now Satan hits this revelation
[32:26] and he hits all revelation and a reason
[32:32] why is because this especially of
[32:37] Revelation tells about the end of the
[32:40] devil of course the book of Genesis
[32:43] tells about his his past and where he
[32:48] came from and a book of Isaiah and many
[32:52] other prophets reveal his rise his
[32:56] deceit trail of the serpent his lies his
[33:01] murders his destruction and his his
[33:06] being cast down
[33:08] not heaven demotion demoted
[33:11] he was absolutely demoted from his
[33:14] original position and became nothing but
[33:17] a loser a wastrel a wayward blackguard a
[33:22] renegade and one that is a wonder of the
[33:27] wastelands here we see clearly in the
[33:31] Word of God why Satan has the cause to
[33:35] hit Revelation he hates revelation
[33:39] instead of education education is good
[33:44] he hates revelation and he hates but he
[33:50] he just loves systems because by systems
[33:55] he can anticipate he knows what is
[34:00] coming but revelation comes upon the
[34:05] sons and daughters of God and in the
[34:08] words of Jesus the wind bloweth where it
[34:11] listeth and no man knows where it would
[34:15] but he that is born of the Spirit so
[34:19] Satan cannot anticipate what God is
[34:23] going to do through your life and that
[34:26] sends him wild and crazy whipping his
[34:30] tail around doing everything possible to
[34:33] upset unbalance and try to prevail
[34:36] against you discourage tempt lie
[34:41] rumors whatever against you but thank
[34:45] God the word says he shall not prevail
[34:49] against the true Church of the Living
[34:52] God but he hits on revelation he hates
[34:55] this book of Revelation and he spews out
[34:58] his lies true
[35:00] lots of preachers teachers theologians
[35:05] scientists bringing up all kinds of
[35:09] theories conspiracies against the Word
[35:13] of God and so in this in this book these
[35:17] books of Genesis and revelation and one
[35:21] with
[35:22] plane is a rigid and in the other book
[35:25] in the book of Revelation we find his
[35:28] total destruction
[35:30] and his end it's all written before it
[35:34] actually happens we see all of his awful
[35:39] ways of destruction that he will bring
[35:43] on the face of the earth and Jesus made
[35:46] it clear John 10:10 but the thief cometh
[35:50] not but for to kill not to steal but I
[35:53] am come that you might have life and
[35:56] that you might have it more abundantly
[36:00] oh the devil is a father of lies the
[36:04] devil is a destroyer but God is a healer
[36:10] for he said I am the Lord that healeth
[36:13] thee he God is our God is a deliverer
[36:17] and we thank God for that now Satan
[36:22] hates revelation because revelation
[36:26] exposes him every time he tries to
[36:29] ambush you ambush the church hide behind
[36:33] some disguise he's unveiled he's
[36:36] uncovered he's revealed his work is made
[36:41] clear and so the believer can take the
[36:46] necessary steps to withstand him so this
[36:50] book of Revelation tells of his end and
[36:53] it tells us the end of his followers
[36:57] those death will hold on to his tales
[37:01] his line tales that he tells and follow
[37:05] him all the way and allow him to drag
[37:10] them right into hell along with it with
[37:13] himself for if you identify with Christ
[37:16] you're gonna Hammond you're identifying
[37:19] with the devil and be a slave of the
[37:22] devil with his habits with his sin with
[37:25] his evil thoughts and his evil character
[37:27] then you
[37:29] paying the price with your
[37:31] representation certainly we see friends
[37:35] that these two books expose him and
[37:38] Satan hates to be exposed lay because
[37:43] the word expose is is like saying
[37:48] casting light on a person or a spotlight
[37:52] on a person or a situation so Satan
[37:58] hates the light he hates to be exposed
[38:02] or revealed to who he is he loves to
[38:06] make himself appear as a as a angel of
[38:11] light
[38:12] but then when God's light is turned on
[38:15] it's revealed that he is an angel of
[38:19] darkness he is the devil and that is
[38:23] he's a creature of darkness his people
[38:27] and his children are a children of
[38:29] darkness by darkness I mean Satan lusts
[38:33] to keep people in spiritual ignorance
[38:37] and in spiritual darkness of who they
[38:42] are who their father is their real
[38:46] origins where they come from and where
[38:51] is their destiny this is what he does he
[38:55] hits the entire Bible and keeps trying
[38:59] to keep it from people he tries to do it
[39:03] what he does it first of all by
[39:06] hindering its writing first of all the
[39:10] Bible was not yet written
[39:12] and after believers begin to write the
[39:17] Bible Paul and some of the others look
[39:22] Matthew and the others began to write
[39:25] the Bible then certain ones he began to
[39:29] try to hitter it because what he'll take
[39:33] it and hold on to it
[39:34] lock it up within his various seminaries
[39:39] and monasteries and places like that and
[39:42] claim ownership over it like that and
[39:47] then when that began to creep out or
[39:51] seep out into the population then what
[39:56] did he do he began to try to hinder the
[39:59] printing of it men like William Tyndale
[40:03] in 1494 that began to try to trick the
[40:08] Bible so that can be had by the common
[40:11] people under the auspices of this
[40:13] wonderful this King James I think it was
[40:18] Good King James later on that wanted
[40:22] this Bible printed so that all the
[40:25] common people can have access to the
[40:27] Bible once the Bible got printed he
[40:31] changed the strategy and started burning
[40:33] the vital burning the people that read
[40:37] the Bible killing them persecuting them
[40:40] oh thank god
[40:43] I say again for King James who began to
[40:46] proliferate
[40:47] the Bible and then once he continued
[40:52] doing that the next thing he did after
[40:55] that was start locking the Bible up in
[41:00] the churches and as a boy I literally
[41:03] saw one of those Bibles in one of those
[41:09] churches with a literal brass padlock on
[41:14] it it had a latch and had a key and a
[41:19] padlock was on it and only the priest
[41:23] had a key that he could open that lock
[41:26] and read out of this book which brought
[41:30] fear and mystery upon the people and
[41:35] they were given this lie that only the
[41:39] priests only the preachers could
[41:42] understand the Bible but
[41:44] thank God that's been lifting away from
[41:47] the people that's been the scales have
[41:50] dropped off all right and we could
[41:52] recognize that when we look we can see
[41:54] Jesus only standing there in all of his
[41:59] marvelous glory yes sir
[42:02] you know he began to perpetrate that lie
[42:05] that only the priests and the preachers
[42:08] had the right to interpret the Word of
[42:10] God but we know that God is his own
[42:14] interpreter and he is the one only he
[42:17] the author can tell you about himself
[42:20] only God can reveal his own word to his
[42:25] own people and make it plain and clear
[42:27] to them blessed be the name of our Lord
[42:31] God forevermore thank you Lord Jesus
[42:34] hallelujah now we understand revelation
[42:38] does not come by study it does not come
[42:42] by burning the midnight oil it is not
[42:45] based upon human intelligence but it's
[42:49] based upon God's grace and to whom he
[42:53] would reveal his word and make it known
[42:55] to themselves Oh
[42:58] blessed be the name of the Lord friends
[43:00] I thank God that he opened my eyes one
[43:04] day and you ought to thank God wherever
[43:06] you are that he opened your eyes to be
[43:09] able to see this message of this power
[43:12] and if you have not heard of this as yet
