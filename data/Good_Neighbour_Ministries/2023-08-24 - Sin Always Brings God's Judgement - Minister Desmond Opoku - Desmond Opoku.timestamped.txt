[46:24] the elders your parents they've been
[46:27] through there is no place you've ever
[46:30] been that we parents have not been there
[46:34] so when we tell you something listen
[46:38] Hallelujah
[46:39] God did for us he gonna do for you I
[46:43] don't know why I'm telling I'm saying
[46:45] this that's not my message right there I
[46:46] don't know but I think they need it
[46:49] glory to God
[46:51] amen
[46:54] when God gave them this
[46:58] instructions about about
[47:02] that that shall not worship any other
[47:05] gods before me
[47:07] when they went to the the the the the
[47:10] the the
[47:11] they crossed the land
[47:13] there was
[47:15] they started doing things that they're
[47:18] not supposed to do
[47:19] God told me not to do
[47:21] so they have one time they have a king
[47:24] his name is aham
[47:27] you know Ahab
[47:29] was
[47:31] was Israelite
[47:33] how he became a king
[47:35] as you are here we are all Christians
[47:41] that's what I was telling you about you
[47:42] young people
[47:45] became a king and one day
[47:49] he decided to have a wife
[47:51] instead of him to have a wife in his own
[47:55] town he's so congregation or he's not
[47:58] not congregation around where God dwells
[48:03] in the kingdom of God
[48:05] he went and picked up a wife from Egypt
[48:09] his name was Jezebel
[48:12] and this Jezebel
[48:15] LED Ahab LED
[48:18] through this Jezebel
[48:21] you see
[48:24] when you left the house of God and you
[48:27] go outside without the leadership of the
[48:29] Holy Ghost
[48:31] you think
[48:35] you're gonna bring somebody also uh
[48:38] somebody in your life
[48:40] that you're gonna control or you're
[48:42] gonna convert him to
[48:43] to be a Christian
[48:46] but if it's God didn't lead you and you
[48:50] go over there that's what happened to
[48:52] this King
[48:53] he went
[48:55] and pick up this woman
[48:57] the adult worshiper
[49:00] thinking that you're gonna tell him to
[49:02] be Israelite
[49:04] to be a Christian but it does not work
[49:08] so by the time you realize the woman's
[49:12] adult has overcome him
[49:15] and bow down to the other and what
[49:18] happened
[49:19] he led him astray
[49:22] and what happened not only him he
[49:25] started
[49:27] to bring in this adultery that God told
[49:30] them not to break down
[49:33] to the children of Israel by the time he
[49:36] realized the he caused a lot of children
[49:40] of Israel to worship adults that God
[49:44] warned them
[49:45] Hallelujah
[49:51] you have to recognize Who You Are
[49:57] sometimes good thing people think
[50:01] oh God is a merciful god so anything
[50:05] that I do
[50:07] you have mercy
[50:09] and Grace oh sure his grace is
[50:11] sufficient
[50:13] his Mercy is precious Mercy
[50:16] but it's also a god of judgment
[50:20] Hallelujah
[50:23] so what about you do let the Holy Ghost
[50:26] leads you
[50:28] Hallelujah he's God of judgment
[50:33] he will not allow you to tell his grace
[50:37] to be disgraced
[50:40] Hallelujah
[50:45] you know sometimes people shorten their
[50:48] lives
[50:51] for things that they do
[50:54] because if you're a child of God you're
[50:56] a child of God
[50:57] you cannot change
[50:59] as a child of God
[51:01] but if you disobey the word of God
[51:03] sometimes God will shorten your life
[51:08] to what to not to disgrace his word one
[51:12] time brother Abraham has a friend
[51:14] I forgot his name
[51:16] and this man was a drunker
[51:19] even some time
[51:21] goes to him he want the brother Abraham
[51:24] to buy drink for him
[51:26] one time he saw him so much drunk
[51:29] and after that the following day here
[51:31] that God take his child home
[51:35] he shortened his life
[51:39] so God is God is a god of judgment
[51:43] he won his people to be faithful to his
[51:47] word
[51:48] he cannot go against his word
[51:51] the word of God is absolute you cannot
[51:54] change it

[1:03:10] you cannot be
[1:03:13] you cannot do anything for yourself but
[1:03:16] God is going to build you
[1:03:18] God is in you but you have to recognize
[1:03:22] the god that itself is real
[1:03:28] that's why if you pray with fire
[1:03:32] fire will burn you
[1:03:34] don't play with fire if you play on fire
[1:03:37] fire will burn you
[1:03:39] you stay away from the word of God God
[1:03:43] will give you mercy and Grace
[1:03:45] for a certain period of time
[1:03:49] but
[1:03:50] remember you have to repent and come
[1:03:53] back to him
[1:03:54] God always give Israelites a chance
[1:03:58] to repent and come back to him if you
[1:04:01] read the Bible all the time we forgive
[1:04:03] them
[1:04:04] all the time he forgive them all the
[1:04:07] time he forgive them they do the same
[1:04:09] thing and go back but now Joshua time
[1:04:12] yes
[1:04:14] we are going home we got to prepare no
[1:04:18] more time
[1:04:19] Hallelujah if you stay aware that we're
[1:04:23] gonna leave you there is going home time
[1:04:26] Brethren this is not a joke
[1:04:29] this is real
[1:04:31] Hallelujah
[1:04:35] so what Elijah did is
[1:04:40] they blame Elijah said he is the trouble
[1:04:43] he's the one who caused the trouble
[1:04:46] that there's no rain
[1:04:49] and and Elijah said
[1:04:53] I'm not a trouble you are the trouble
[1:04:56] because you disobey God
[1:04:58] so what he did
[1:05:02] he call All The Jezebel those people
[1:05:06] worshiping the others
[1:05:09] he brought them down
[1:05:12] he want to see the other that they
[1:05:14] worship if they can help them
[1:05:17] India is good at all
[1:05:21] let them prove himself
[1:05:24] so he gathered them that's why we read
[1:05:27] the Bible there is what he said
[1:05:29] he make them he bring the altar he put a
[1:05:33] sacrifice water wood and everything
[1:05:36] inside it said put more for you put him
[1:05:39] off put more water put more you know
[1:05:41] when you soak wood with water it's very
[1:05:43] hard
[1:05:45] to to burn it everybody know if the wood
[1:05:48] is not not uh it's not dry it's very
[1:05:53] hard to put a match there to to light
[1:05:56] the wood
[1:05:58] so he want to prove them that the adult
[1:06:01] cannot
[1:06:03] help them
[1:06:05] so he did that and when he did it
[1:06:10] he said if you people
[1:06:15] can bring the fire
[1:06:17] can your other can bring a fire to burn
[1:06:20] this offering I would leave my God and
[1:06:23] save your God
[1:06:25] see this is the word eh if you leave God
[1:06:30] there is nothing out there for you it's
[1:06:32] death
[1:06:33] it's death
[1:06:35] so
[1:06:36] when that thing happened
[1:06:38] they couldn't do it they cut themselves
[1:06:41] they do all kind of thing you see now
[1:06:44] the churches they do everything
[1:06:47] thinking that God is there but God is
[1:06:51] out from their Camp God is here right
[1:06:53] now he's speaking to his people
[1:06:58] so
[1:06:59] a rich important a certain a certain
[1:07:01] point of time
[1:07:03] Elijah said okay
[1:07:08] God told them what to do he said wipe
[1:07:10] all of them out
[1:07:13] so it's okay you set aside
[1:07:16] Elijah wait till the time of sacrifice
[1:07:20] of God I ran through the cross said you
[1:07:23] guys done in part
[1:07:24] and meanwhile he set up the people
[1:07:27] around them don't let anybody run away
[1:07:29] from here
[1:07:30] because they couldn't do what they're
[1:07:32] supposed to do if you couldn't do what
[1:07:34] he's supposed to do you have to get a
[1:07:35] punishment if you go to school
[1:07:39] and he give you the teacher put a
[1:07:41] something on the board and he gave it to
[1:07:43] you that's something that he attacked
[1:07:44] you before
[1:07:45] and and you couldn't pass what do you do
[1:07:48] you give me zero
[1:07:51] so he has to give them zero
[1:07:53] so
[1:07:54] Elijah
[1:07:57] spoke the word of God
[1:07:59] and called God
[1:08:01] and God came down
[1:08:03] and burned the sacrifice and lick all
[1:08:07] the water
[1:08:08] everything they said because
[1:08:12] he's saving the others the adults go
[1:08:15] hate he cannot help you while all of
[1:08:17] them up
[1:08:19] you took all of them out
[1:08:22] he white of them
[1:08:24] so if you stay away from the presence of
[1:08:27] God what is what what next that
[1:08:33] so I'm telling you
[1:08:36] tonight young people stay with the word
[1:08:39] of God

[1:29:16] three days ago
[1:29:18] we set in a place and if that man didn't
[1:29:21] tell me everything that's happened this
[1:29:23] morning I'm not standing here he told me
[1:29:25] that you all were fixing the questioning
[1:29:27] on his Doctrine and he told me that I
[1:29:29] have to cancel out that other place in
[1:29:31] the year and told me exactly where a
[1:29:32] doctor meet and these people would be
[1:29:33] setting Justin Zachary and here they are
[1:29:36] he said you might have disagree with him

[1:29:41] he said now brother Randall floor is
[1:29:44] yours I said before we start
[1:29:46] I read what I did this morning I was not
[1:29:47] disobedient to the heavenly vision I
[1:29:49] said now
[1:29:51] let's settle this
[1:29:52] now you all speak of being doctors of
[1:29:55] divinity and I stand here by myself
[1:29:58] I said if that's so you want to question
[1:30:00] me on the baptism Jesus name we'll start
[1:30:02] with that first
[1:30:04] I want one of you men to bring your
[1:30:05] Bible and stand here by my side on
[1:30:08] anything that I've taught
[1:30:10] I said stand here by my side
[1:30:13] and with the word of God disprove it
[1:30:18] I waited nobody said nothing
[1:30:21] I said I'm asking for some of you man to
[1:30:24] come stand on my side
[1:30:28] so what's the matter with you
[1:30:33] if you're afraid to Stand Here by me
[1:30:36] it's nothing either for you huh it's
[1:30:38] that angel of the almighty God amen if
[1:30:42] he could force tell me to come David
[1:30:44] brighter than I thought they were
[1:30:46] they know it's better to stand there
[1:30:51] you know you've been at times then
[1:30:54] see
[1:30:55] where is the word of God now is it you
[1:30:58] Brad Brown didn't take that word with
[1:31:01] him
[1:31:02] he said you now the word of God is in
[1:31:07] the bright mouth
[1:31:08] you are the mouthpiece of God
[1:31:14] you see
[1:31:16] they knew what Brahm said they knew the
[1:31:20] angel of God
[1:31:22] was standing beside me
[1:31:24] when they go over there what will happen
[1:31:27] the same thing Elijah called him off
[1:31:31] they knew this time they were smart but
[1:31:34] Elijah people were not smart
[1:31:38] Hallelujah
[1:31:40] so this is what I'm talking about the
[1:31:43] word of God is real
[1:31:45] let the word of God be real in your
[1:31:48] heart
[1:31:49] not just to be a Christian
[1:31:52] with a long dress
[1:31:54] nice hair
