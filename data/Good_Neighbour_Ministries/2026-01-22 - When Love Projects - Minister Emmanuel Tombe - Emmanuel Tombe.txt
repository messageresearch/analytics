[music] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints of God. It's good to [clears throat] be in the house of the Lord. Um, you know, it's rough weather outside, but it's always a sacrifice. Well, God blesses your sacrifice whenever you come here. So, we are grateful and thank you musicians. God bless you. So without wasting too much time, uh we're just going to be very brief tonight and u just go through a very simple message and I trust that uh the Lord will speak to your hearts and uh just give you something that you can use to keep fighting this battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So while we are standing, we're going to turn to our scriptures and read from St. John chapter 13. St. John chapter 13. Tonight I just want to speak on a simple subject. When love projects. &gt;&gt; Amen. When love projects. All right. So St. John chapter 13 verse uh 34 and 35. [clears throat] Praise God. It says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another. Praise God. You may have your seats. [clears throat] So tonight I just want to uh speak on this subject when love projects and um we all know as human beings we are we all have that fundamental desire to be loved. And this is a need that God placed in every one of us and it needs to be satisfied I believe both in man and in God as well. You know the Bible tells us that we should love the Lord our God with all of our hearts with all of our strength. So you can see that even God himself he has a desire in him to be loved. Amen. And I don't think there's anyone here tonight who enjoys the experience of hatred. Amen. We like to be loved. We like to be appreciated. And so this is just going back to the one of the fundamental principles that Christ talks about when he said in the scripture that we read that by this shall all men know that you are my disciples. Amen. So I believe that love is the the greatest or one of the greatest uh marks of true disciplehip because that's what Jesus said that when you can express love to one another then this is how men will identify you as being one of my disciples. Praise God. And so since the inception of the message which we know that uh this message has been around for well over 60 years and for those who've been around the message circles uh you know we've witnessed a lot of things that have happened uh you know time has proven that you know without love at the center of every doctrine or the great personalities that have come and gone. It all comes to nothing when there is an absence of godly love. We've seen all these things happen. Doctrines have come, personalities have risen, but you see, without love being at the center of it all, it all comes down to nothing. And I believe this testifies to what Paul uh was speaking about in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 when he said these words. He says, "Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Verse two. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I think that establishes the foundation of real true Christianity that no matter what we claim to be or have without love we are nothing. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I want to read this quote where uh in this message God projecting his love the prophet says this. He says, "And I think if one thing is needed in the great universal church of God tonight is love, we do not need other things as much as we think." And all these other things, our emotions and our gifts, they are wonderful. And to God we give praise. But if those gifts are not governed by love, then they are not effective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we all say amen to that? &gt;&gt; He says love should govern the home. Love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of men. A home thus not disciplined by love is not much of a home. If the husband and wife does not solemnly love one another, they cannot trust each other. Praise God. Then he says, "That's why I think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which is all right or some gift which is all right like shouting, speaking with tongues or with other things that we take for saying that we have the Holy Spirit when we do these things." In other words, evidences those things are all right. But if we would come back to the principle love first and then those things I those things I think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get God first &gt;&gt; and God is love. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I want to talk about wounded Christians because I think that you know in this message or in this Christian walk at least I can talk about my own experience. you find that there are a lot of hurting people who are still trying to serve God but with deep scars, complexes and things that have not really been dealt with. And you know, I believe that no matter how much a situation exists in a person's life, until it's dealt with, you really cannot progress. And so the idea of brushing things under the carpet and pretending like it doesn't exist. Well, we as human beings, we might do that, but God does not want us to operate like that. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said that he whom the son has set free is free indeed. And I believe that God wants all of his children to be happy, to be free, to enjoy life, to enjoy their Christian walk, just to be happy Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no need for us to carry bondages and and weights of things of the past. God wants us to be free. Amen. &gt;&gt; So whenever you open your heart to express love to people, I want you to understand that you are actually potentially opening up yourself to be scarred. And I'll back up that statement. You enter into a position of being vulnerable and which sometimes can lead to inward pain. and scars in our spirits. And you've noticed this for people who are very loving. You find that people who tend to love the most are the ones who easily get hurt. Is that right? You've heard this saying that um or you find that people who are considered nice people often times the world looks at that today as a sign of weakness. And many times people will try to exploit those individuals because they think that being nice or loving is weakness. And so when people open their hearts, basically what you're doing is that you are placing yourself in a position of being vulnerable to being hurt. But it does not mean that you should shut yourself up. We are still required to love one another, to open our hearts for each other. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So you look at the example of the lily of the valley. This is a a a plant or the flower which of course the prophet talked about A LOT IS ALWAYS GIVING. It's always vulnerable. It's selfless, kind, and expecting nothing in return. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this reinforces the the idea that when it comes to loving one another, we should not really expect anything in return. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul was talking about. He defines what love is. I I won't go back to that because of time. So it's a paradox just like the lily of the valley or the the flower the lily flower it has to be crushed in order to produce what perfume AND SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR US Christians if we are expected to be the expressions of love the ones who actually the prophet says says that actually true love will only be found in the bride. So if this attribute of love is to be expressed through the bride, that means that there will be moments in our lives where we are going to be crushed. &gt;&gt; You must expect those moments to come. And so I want to encourage you tonight that when those things happen, don't allow those moments to put you in a place where you develop a complex because it's so easy &gt;&gt; to get into a complex. &gt;&gt; And people who get into that state eventually they shut themselves up &gt;&gt; because they are wounded. And a wounded animal is very very defensive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want to look at the characteristics that were displayed in our Lord Jesus because I think he was the greatest example of how we should be like. So going to Isaiah 53, a very familiar scripture. I want to read it and just break it down. It says this in verse two. For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground. He hath no form nor clumliness. And when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Just picture this now as we read this. The image that is being painted of what kind of a personality our Lord would be. Okay? He is present tense despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid as it were our faces from him. Then watch this. He was despised. That to me is the fulfillment of Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Because if he is despised now, in what form is he being despised? He's not here physically, but he's in you, in every one of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So he was despised and we esteemed him not not. So I want you to notice the consistency of the scripture. Verse four. Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows. This was the kind of a man that our Lord was. Yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions. So these were now the attributes that came out of him. A healer. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And by his stripes we are healed. A byproduct of being crushed. A man acquainted with sorrow, acquainted with grief, despised, rejected, not being esteemed. And yet from this came our healing, our salvation. So what about us? What should we be as Christians, followers of Christ? Do we do we give up so quickly just because some minor thing happens? Maybe some misunderstanding and we are ready to call it quits. Look at our Lord the things he went through rejected of men. We esteemed him not. And yet from that after God crushed him today we are beneficiaries because we get our healing from what came out of this. Praise God. And so under the weight of rejection and persecution, Jesus stood the test. Why? Because he was built to stand this test. Amen. Now, every mortal being has buckled under the pressure of rejection and persecution. I'll be the first to admit that I'm guilty. Every one of us, I'm sure at some point in our lives, we have come to that place where we feel like giving up. Look at brother Brham and let's study this story that he talks about of the complex that he developed as a result of being rejected. Amen. Are we familiar with this message standing in the gap? And I'm going to read portions of this because there's something I want to bring out here which I think is very relevant to show me and you that even brother Brham as gifted as he was as much as God used him he buckled under the pressure. He says this, "Moses lost the feeling." I want to emphasize on that word, the feeling of his people because they won't listen to him. And brother Roy, you see your dream. I'll just skip. Now I I now I want I cannot go now. He says, "Now I cannot go with a ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it. no matter if God did tell me. I'll read that again until I feel different in my heart about it. No matter if God did tell me, but that is that change that brother Roy uh saw coming. Something has got to change me because in my heart if I go out there feeling the way I do now I still feel that they ought to have heard the message. So, brother Brham is expressing telling us that something has to change in his heart and that is a feeling because he had developed a complex and this complex had changed the way he felt towards his brethren. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS AND I DON'T HAVE the feeling for the PEOPLE THAT I SHOULD HAVE. I LIKE his honesty. Until I can get that feeling, there is no need in me going because I'd be a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Praise God for an honest man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart. And I won't go out being a hyp being a hypocrite. Listen to this again. I got to feel that. There's a reason why I'm emphasizing on that word feel because sometimes we become so desensitized and we you heard people say, "Well, what does feelings have to do with it?" Well, we're going to see. We're going to see. He says that it isn't Ricky and Ricetta and it isn't this bunch. It's God's children that's in bondage that I must go to. Until I can feel that way, I'll just have to loaf around, preach some conventions and things. But wait, praise God. Now, we've all been misunderstood in our lives at some point or another. Every one of us has been misunderstood. And sometimes it doesn't matter how good our intentions might be, we will be misunderstood. You will be misjudged even with good intentions. I believe it's just part of life. Sometimes people will resent you. It could be at work. It could even sometimes be at home or even ministers preaching behind the pullpit. Sometimes it's in fact some of the worst places you can feel a spirit of resentment moving. Oh yeah, it can be felt right from the pulpit. Now just imagine brother Abraham how he felt with the gift that he had to be able to discern and look and see what was going on in the hearts of the people and he knew for example let's just use brother Kofi for example that he's resenting everything that I'm saying criticizing everything that I'm saying and yet behave like nothing is going on and still be able to treat him like a brother and mean These things happen in life. And I believe God is bringing us to a place where he is now coming to the part where the rubber meets the road because this gospel that we have the message I don't believe is meant to just remain here but it should come here. &gt;&gt; Amen. whereby it's no longer what we just say with our mouths, but it's what our lives speak without necessarily saying it with our mouth. For by this shall men know that you are my disciples when they can see Christ on display. It [snorts] doesn't matter how much I can talk and how revelated I sound, even how much I can preach, that means nothing. At the end of the day, it's when I walk out or we all walk out of these doors and we go to our homes, our jobs and whatnot and the people at work see the way we live, the way we treat one another, our husbands, our wives, our kids, that is where it really matters. Amen. So God expects every one of us to be responsible and sensitive with how we treat one another. Why? Because humans, I'm coming back to this word, have feelings. Brother Danny is not made out of bricks. He's not made out of wood or stone. any e every one of us we are human beings who have feelings. We are made out of flesh and blood with five senses both in our flesh and in our spirit. So in the flesh we have see, taste, smell, touch, hear. And the prophet says in our spirit we also have imagination, reasoning, conscience, re uh memory and affection. Amen. And those aspects of our humanity get affected. And so sometimes, like I said earlier on, we cannot just say, well, it doesn't really matter how you feel. Because in Hebrews chapter 4:E1 15 it says this. For we have an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but WAS IN ALL POINTS TEMPTED like we are yet without sin. I want to read the amplified version because I think it will express it better. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize and understand our weakness and temptations. But one who has been tempted knowing exactly how it feels to be human in every aspect as we are yet without committing any sin. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So when you are sick and laying in bed in pain, you know, Jesus has to be able to understand what it feels like. When you are rejected, persecuted, the Bible says that he understands how you feel. So in order for him to be the right kind of a high priest, he must be able to have to understand how we feel because the Bible says he's touched with the feeling of our infirmities. I want to use one example of Apostle Peter, Peter the Apostle. Now we all know uh Peter was one of the most outspoken men among the disciples of Jesus. He was um well at times in trouble with his mouth saying things rebuking the Lord and whatnot. But you know I like Peter because he was just who he was. There was nothing to hide about him. What you saw is what you got. Amen. And you remember that when Jesus was going to Calvary, Peter feeling that he had so much zeal and he felt that it he he had what it took to stand that moment when men were going to forsake Jesus. You remember what Peter said that as for me I will not deny you Lord. And Jesus turned around and says you know what Peter before the Crows you will deny me three times. Well, it looked like Peter with his boldness, you know, he would he would have actually been successful in carrying out the way he felt. But you know, God is not a liar. He knew exactly what was going to happen. Amen. And we know the story. Peter eventually denied him three times. Exactly like what Jesus said. Now, I want to bring this out just to show you that because I believe Peter meant well and sometimes even in our best efforts to do what's right, we do the wrong things. And you could just imagine how Peter felt when he heard that crow and the words of Jesus now coming to his memory knowing that he had denied the prince of life. Put yourself in his shoe and imagine what he felt like. And just to show you that God is mindful of what we go through, I want to read this passage of scripture found in Mark chapter 16. And we will see what happens here. This is now after the resurrection of our Lord. And when the Sabbath was passed, Mary Magdalene, the mother of James Salom, had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him. And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they came unto the sepiler at the rising of the sun, and said among themselves, who shall roll away the stone from the door of the sepilchar? And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away. And entering into the sepiler, they saw a young man, this was now an angel, sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment. And they were afrighted. And he said unto them, "Be not afraid. Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified. He is risen. He is not here." Now watch this in verse 7. But go your way. Tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee. I believe that God was trying to make it very personal that Peter, I am mindful of you &gt;&gt; and I'm going to address you very specifically just TO YOU PETER. &gt;&gt; TELL MY disciples and Peter, HALLELUJAH, BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT GOD KNEW the condition that Peter was in &gt;&gt; and so he needed comfort. He needed encouragement. He needed to know that Peter, even though you messed up, it's not finished. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So God is mindful of how you feel. I believe God is very personal and sometimes you know we try to present a God who is so mysterious but I don't believe God is so mysterious. And you know the prophet talked about uh he told that story of that boy you know who was um you know there was a thunderstorm and he ran to his mom and said you know you know I I want to I want a god with skin on. And sometimes I think we just want to experience God with skin on. A brother that you can go to a sister and feel that God is in my brother is in my sister. Amen. That's what I believe this gospel is about. God with skin on. And it's not always what we say to people that leaves an impact, but it's always how you make others feel in your presence. Talk is cheap, but our actions speak louder than anything that we could ever say. You see, like tonight, maybe after a week, after a month or three months from now, you may forget everything that I've said in this sermon tonight or any other minister, every true servant of God. You might forget everything, but you will never forget how I treat you once I walk out of those doors. How I make you feel. How I interact with you. my attitude and whatn not that will leave an impact not so much my sermon as good as it might be or any minister but it's the way we treat one another and the prophet says this and did you know you are a little creator yourself you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around you don't know why just that loving type of person. Have you seen that? Just kind. You like to be around them. They create that atmosphere by the life they live, the way they talk, their conversation. Then you've seen those that every time you shun them, you know what I'm talking about. all the time they want to talk about something evil and talk about somebody else say, "Oh, there they come. They're going to criticize somebody there. Here he is now. He's going to talk about this man. You just hate to get around them." See, because they create and then he says this, seemingly pretty nice people, but they create that atmosphere. Seemingly nice people, but they create an atmosphere. You know, if we feed on gossip and talking about other people, even though you might not be heard, but it creates an atmosphere whereby if you're sensitive enough to the spirit of God, you will just feel that distance towards that person. seemingly nice people and the prophecies but you just shun them just feel no I'm not comfortable around this person because we create atmospheres so it's important what we feed on the things that we talk about even the meditations of our hearts like David said let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord because those things create atmospheres. &gt;&gt; So, do feelings matter to God? I believe they do. And I'm going to wind down with this. I just want to come back to what I began with and speak on offenses and forgiveness because I believe that it's very important. &gt;&gt; Offenses and forgiveness. You know, in my Christian walk, I've come across a lot of believers and in trying to serve God, you find that like I said earlier on, they are wounded people. In other words, there are many people who are just merely coping. Even though on the surface everything looks fine, but they're just really just coping. And you find that when you fellowship with such people, such individuals, really what they need in their lives is some form of closure. They need some form of closure to really get rid of those deep scars that they're carrying. And you know, I find that it's so easy to tell people, especially those who've been hurt, that, "Oh, you know what? Just forgive and forget. Just forgive and forget. Yes, it's scriptural that we must forgive. Every Christian must forgive. It's true. But that's only half of the coin. Because the the Bible tells us in Proverbs chapter 18, he says, "A brother offended is harder to be worn than a strong city." and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. So even though God stills still expects us to display unconditional love to our enemies, it does not give us the license to offend others. Sorry. However, this is not a license for those who offend to escape accountability. &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 5:8 says this, "But God commended his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. But God is still waiting for every one of us at the door of Acts 2:38 whereby he says, "Repent." SO WHEN WE COME TO GOD, GOD STILL REQUIRES WHAT? REPENTANCE. That's the first thing he says. Repent and be baptized. I'm just using that as a concept to show you that offending people and expecting just to walk free. Meanwhile, somebody is drowning with scars. You are still responsible to make that thing right. Especially if I know I've hurt my brother or done wrong to him, I owe it to God. I owe it to my brother to put that thing right. Praise God. And so sometimes we forget these things and you find that people start to look at Christianity as some hypocritical religion. And that's exactly what the devil wants to paint this gospel as. Because if he can get people to believe that Christianity is just hypoc, that's exactly what he wants. And yet we know that well the gospel of Christ is the truth. So Joseph in the Bible, we're familiar with this story. I'm just going to use this to wind down. Before Joseph could reveal himself to his brethren in Egypt, I believe that there was one attribute that he was looking for before he made himself known to his brethren. And so why did Joseph demand? You remember when when his brethren came, he demanded that Benjamin, the youngest one, be kept back as his servant. After the silver cup was placed in one of the sacks and was found in his in Benjamin sacks, Joseph said, "As for Benjamin, keep him behind here. The rest you can go." I believe that Joseph was using Benjamin as the litmos test because he wanted to see one thing in his brethren. Those same brothers who had at some point displayed such hatred, animosity that they were willing to kill him or even sell him off. He wanted to see if those same brothers had now changed and that brotherly kindness had now taken a hold. Because remember, Joseph understood who his brethren were. He understood everything they were saying, but to them they didn't know who he was. And so he gives them this test by using Benjamin. And if you go and read when you have time, go and read Genesis 44 and you will see that now here is Judah bargaining with Joseph and unknowingly he is revealing everything. All the words that he spoke was literally the conversation that had taken place at home with his father Jacob. and he told the whole story of Joseph's past experiences. And when Joseph saw that, that's the thing that broke him. He realized that yes, something has now taken place. And it was at that moment that Joseph broke down and eventually revealed himself to his brethren. What did he see? brotherly kindness. So saints of God, if we have offended somebody, if you have offended somebody, I urge you in the name of the Lord, go put that thing right because we know as we've been hearing the teachings that the rapture is at hand and we must make sure that everything in our lives is put right. If you have offended somebody, done something wrong, and you know that somebody is hurt because of your actions, I urge you in the name of the Lord, put that thing right. It's for your own good. And so, because you see, wounds bring memories. And you notice this as I close in Zechariah when um this is now when uh uh Benjamin is um of course who's a type of the 144,000 Jews. We know that they will be saved in the 3 and 1/2 years. Okay. And Zechariah 12:10 and 13 speaks about how there will come a moment when they will recognize the atonement and they will ask one specific question. Where did you get those wounds and Jesus we know it will be Christ will tell them in the house of my friends. I'm just going to say this because it's a principle I want to apply. Wounds bring back memories. And when they saw those wounds, they questioned and said, "Where did you get those wounds?" And when he revealed himself and he told them that in the house of my friends, these were actually the Jews. The same people crucified him. And so there came a recognition that yes, WE ARE THE ONES who crucified the Messiah. We are guilty of causing those wounds, those scars in his hands. And the Bible says they all went to their homes and wept and whatnot because they recognized they recognized that they were responsible for those scars in his hands, the wounds on his side. So what am I saying? A wounded person needs closure because wounds carry memories. And to make it easier for anyone that we've offended, it's actually very simple. It's just two simple words. I'm sorry. That's all. I'm sorry. You know, by saying I'm sorry, it relieves you, the one who was offended, and it also frees the one who's been offended. It gives a chance for reconciliation to take place. Saying I'm sorry, does not make you less of a Christian. It actually simply means that you are interested in the well-being of another person. As Jesus said in Luke 17, as I close, he said, "Then he said unto his disciples that it is impossible, but that offenses will come, but woe unto him through whom they come." God help me that I am not the one who is guilty of causing an offense to a child or a daughter, a son or a daughter of God. I make it also your desire that you will not be one who's responsible for being a stumbling block to somebody else. Because as we know people, a lot of people are hurting even in this message by bad experiences, the way they've been treated. On Sunday, our pastor spoke about those things, the way they've been handled. And you know it's so quick to judge people and say well like for example those who left the message. It's so easy to judge a lot of those people and say well they they left us because they are not among us. But if you listen to some of the stories of things they went through the way they were handled in the message. You almost can't blame them for turning against the message. So we are responsible how we handle one another. So saying sorry it's it's not going to make you anything less but if anything is going to make you more of a Christian and this story touched me as I close just to show you that humility can really go a long ways. Brother Brham was confronted with the killer bull and he tells this story in a way that when I read this story I realized that I have a long ways to go and I believe every one of us still has a long ways to go. The prophet was crossing a field to go and pray for his brother and he encounters this killer bull and this is what he says. He says, "Poor creature, I am on your territory. This is an animal. You are an animal. You don't know any different. That's the only thing you know is to protect your rights. And I said to this bull in these words, "Oh creature of God, I am a servant of God and I am on my way to pray for my sick brother." Now listen to this. I'm sorry I disturbed you, but in Jesus name, go lay down. How many of us would have thought of speaking the word and speaking it out of existence? This is just one example. You remember the story too of the killer, I mean of the u the hornets. Same thing. The prophet approaches, these are creatures don't that don't have a soul, no mental capacity to think. And yet this is how he approached animals. I'm sorry for disturbing him. In closing, the prophet says this. Now he's talking now to humans. This is human to human. We've just left the animals. He says, "I want you to shake hands." Musicians, you can come. Brother Anthony, he says, "I want to shake hands with somebody standing by you. If there's anybody that you've done harm to, make your way to them and shake their hand and say, "God bless you." That's right. Say, "Forgive me, brother. If I've harmed you, I love you. I appreciate you. You're my brother. I need you. I must have you. We are brothers together. We want to see God move." Praise God. This is my message to you tonight. Thank you. &gt;&gt; And it's my my desire and my prayer that these things will become a manifestation in my life and in your life &gt;&gt; because by this shall men know that you are my disciples. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Anthony, if you could sing this song, fill my way every day with love as we stand up. Praise God. Fill my way [singing] every day with [music] love. &gt;&gt; Oh, with love.
