[40:36] today that's going to encourage fathers
[40:39] we're certainly not here today to rebuke
[40:43] fathers or to try and bring all kinds of
[40:46] teachings on what it means to be a good
[40:48] father and no today uh the the the the
[40:51] whole the way the Lord has led me is
[40:54] that he wants us to know how blessed we
[40:58] are to be fathers how blessed we are to
[41:02] have fathers
[41:03] amen and how blessed we are to know that
[41:06] he is our heavenly father
[41:07] praise God and so
[41:10] um we're going to be uh
[41:12] just uh trusting the Lord that he's
[41:14] going to do something that will
[41:16] encourage
[41:18] each and every father in our midst
[41:20] praise God so before we do that let's
[41:23] just pray and ask the Lord to anoint his
[41:26] word father

[42:34] in due season in Jesus name amen praise
[42:38] God God bless you Saints
[42:41] we're going to read from
[42:43] our first scripture here from
[42:46] Psalms 37.
[42:52] verses 23 to 24.
[42:55] it says the steps of a good man are
[42:58] ordered by the Lord
[43:00] and he's delighteth in his way
[43:03] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[43:06] cast down for the Lord upholdeth him
[43:11] with his hand amen praise God
[43:15] and our next scripture
[43:17] is from Galatians chapter 4.
[43:20] verse 6.
[43:22] and it says and because ye are Sons
[43:25] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[43:28] son
[43:29] into your hearts
[43:31] crying Abba Father
[43:36] you may be seated
[43:37] Hallelujah
[43:39] what a wonderful scripture
[43:42] you know
[43:43] Abba means father
[43:46] he's given us his spirit
[43:48] he's given us a revelation of himself
[43:50] he's given us an understanding of how
[43:54] much he loves us and he has given us
[43:57] this anointing in our lives that we can
[44:00] call him Abba
[44:01] you know if you talk to the Jewish
[44:03] people they say Abba they say father
[44:06] that's you know that's that's their
[44:10] their relationship you know the Jews
[44:13] growing up their father was everything
[44:16] to them it was their first teacher you
[44:18] just go back into the scriptures and you
[44:20] look at all the Patriarchs and you know
[44:23] you look at Abraham and you look at
[44:25] Isaac and you look at Jacob and they all
[44:27] had sons and they all had relationships
[44:29] with their sons and and it was important
[44:32] to them their first son was given the
[44:35] you know the full authority of of the
[44:38] father when he became of age you know
[44:40] there was tutoring and there was time
[44:42] and you know if you read this scripture
[44:43] if you go and read actually read about
[44:45] Galatians it's talking about how we've
[44:47] come out of our slavery out of our
[44:51] bondage as humans
[44:53] under the under the law under the
[44:56] teachings of of of of of the law that
[44:59] that makes us do everything because if
[45:02] we don't do something we're going to be
[45:04] punished if we do something wrong we're
[45:06] going to be punished but yet God has
[45:09] shown us here that he says but because
[45:12] you are Sons because you have entered
[45:14] into that that that relationship with me
[45:17] you're no more just governed and
[45:20] controlled by the law you can actually
[45:23] come to me and and Call Me Abba you can
[45:26] you can say Lord God my father Lord I
[45:30] have needs I have I have needs in my
[45:33] life and you can trust and know that
[45:35] he's he he cares and he's concerned and
[45:38] he wants to meet your needs amen praise
[45:40] God forevermore Hallelujah
[45:43] so today
[45:44] you know when and when I got into this
[45:47] study it wasn't easy
[45:48] I'm going to tell you right now
[45:50] it was not easy because as you're going
[45:53] through it as you're studying as you're
[45:55] you know you're researching all about uh
[45:59] being a father and you know the
[46:01] relationship of a father with his son
[46:03] and his relationship with his children
[46:05] and all those things you start to you
[46:08] know examine yourself and I'm not here
[46:10] today to say oh I've done well as a
[46:14] father that I'm a great father
[46:17] I'll tell you I've made a lot of
[46:19] mistakes as a father
[46:21] I'll tell you I'm ashamed of things as a
[46:25] father
[46:27] I've done things and said things to my
[46:30] children that I wish I never did
[46:33] but yet
[46:34] there's a relationship
[46:37] and today we're talking about the heart
[46:39] of a father that's what the lord gave me
[46:42] all I couldn't get away from that that
[46:44] title and the Heart of a father
[46:48] and and I just said okay I'm gonna I'm
[46:50] gonna search the scriptures I'm going to
[46:52] see what it is Lord that it is that that
[46:54] that that stirring within me that's
[46:57] drawn me to this this scripture and this
[47:00] theme and this uh Ministry this morning
[47:03] and I came to realize I I got I got
[47:07] tested in so many ways I got on my knees
[47:11] and cried unto the Lord I repented
[47:14] before God I got I got into situations
[47:17] before God while I was researching this
[47:20] and realized oh God what Mercy you have
[47:24] shown what Grace you have shown to me
[47:28] a father in this life
[47:32] in this society that we're living in
[47:36] so I'm not here to tell you I'm perfect
[47:37] in any way
[47:39] I want you to know that as as we're
[47:41] ministering here this morning it's it's
[47:44] all pointing right back and if you're a
[47:46] father here this morning I want you to
[47:49] pay close attention I want you to search
[47:51] your heart and and because this is about
[47:54] the relationship that you have with the
[47:57] Lord
[47:59] we're living in a day right now
[48:02] where fatherhood is under a massive
[48:06] attack
[48:09] it's been under attack for many many
[48:11] many years
[48:14] in the 1960s
[48:16] there was a sitcom called Father Knows
[48:19] Best I don't know if anybody remembers
[48:21] it I didn't really remember it until I
[48:23] saw the characters and then I remembered
[48:26] it
[48:27] and it's with a couple of act an actor
[48:30] and an actress by the name of Robert
[48:33] Young and Jane Watt and they played
[48:36] their parts as Jim and Margaret Anderson
[48:38] and they were just a common family and
[48:41] whenever there was a situation within
[48:43] that home with the children the mother
[48:45] would say Well when your daddy gets home
[48:49] he knows best
[48:51] and that's why it was titled Father
[48:53] Knows Best
[48:55] and so here back in the 1960s I don't
[48:59] know back then fathers had a lot more
[49:02] respect
[49:04] and fathers when they waved
[49:07] the belt
[49:09] there was a lot of respect
[49:15] you know a lot of times you would make
[49:18] the excuse you know play dumb
[49:20] you play dumb when something oh what do
[49:23] you mean Dad I what I drove the car
[49:26] no I didn't move the car
[49:28] play dumb you can play dumb all you want
[49:31] but once you've tasted of the
[49:33] belt
[49:35] a few times it's amazing how your brain
[49:38] starts to work a lot better
[49:41] and you start to think differently
[49:43] and you know there was a time when when
[49:46] when all those things really mattered
[49:48] and oh when Mom would say you wait till
[49:51] your father gets home
[49:53] it was like I'm out of here
[49:56] I'm gonna run for my life
[49:59] you know because because father had a
[50:01] lot of respect father was was was the
[50:04] breadwinner he was the the final say in
[50:07] the house
[50:08] but I'm saying to you this morning
[50:10] fatherhood is under attack
[50:13] it is under attack in the world because
[50:17] if they can attack fatherhood and they
[50:20] can break it down and make it make it so
[50:22] that it doesn't matter like it did
[50:25] before what happens the families break
[50:28] down
[50:29] relationships break down respect breaks
[50:33] down your children will talk to you in
[50:36] ways that you had never imagined they
[50:39] would say things like that and speak
[50:41] things like that and use the kind of
[50:44] language that they use like that right
[50:46] in your face and still knowing that
[50:48] you're you're you're you're a Christian
[50:50] you're a Godly mother a Godly father you
[50:53] believe the Lord you trust the Lord
[50:56] but this is the age that we're living in
[51:00] Hallelujah
[51:03] you know it was back in 1909
[51:07] When a Woman by the name of Sonora
[51:10] smart Dodd
[51:13] was listening to a Mother's Day sermon
[51:16] and was inspired
[51:18] to come up with Father's Day and
[51:20] apparently she's the one that came up
[51:22] with the idea
[51:24] that we should have a Father's Day
[51:26] and the reason why she did that was
[51:29] because her father had raised six
[51:31] children
[51:33] as a single parent
[51:37] now we know that that's almost unheard
[51:40] of these days
[51:43] for a father
[51:45] to be raising as a single parent
[51:49] mothers
[51:51] they're everywhere
[51:54] they're everywhere
[51:56] single mothers are absolutely everywhere
[51:58] why because the whole system in the
[52:02] whole social system and the whole uh
[52:04] everything about government and the way
[52:07] everything is set up and designed is
[52:09] designed to produce that type of
[52:13] environment for our children
[52:15] and so now children more than ever ever
[52:19] before are being brought up
[52:22] without fathers
[52:28] let's go to um
[52:33] the next slide
[52:36] now don't go any further just leave it
[52:38] right there
[52:40] father deprivation
[52:42] is a more reliable predictor of criminal
[52:45] activity
[52:47] then race environment or poverty
[52:53] children are growing up without fathers
[52:58] in society right now at a record pace
[53:01] like never before
[53:04] and when a father is not present
[53:07] certain things take place now these are
[53:10] facts listen
[53:13] 63 percent
[53:16] of Youth suicides are from fatherless
[53:19] homes
[53:22] 90 percent
[53:24] of all runaway children are from
[53:27] fatherless homes
[53:30] 85 percent of all children with
[53:34] behavioral disorders are from fatherless
[53:38] homes
[53:40] eighty percent of rapists with violent
[53:43] anger disorders are from fatherless
[53:46] homes
[53:47] 71 percent of high school dropouts are
[53:51] from fatherless homes
[53:53] 75 percent of all adolescent chemical
[53:56] abuse patients in drug treatment centers
[54:00] are from fatherless homes
[54:04] 85 percent of all youths in prison
[54:09] are from fatherless homes
[54:12] this is mind-blowing
[54:14] it's staggering
[54:19] what is it Saints
[54:22] father deprivation
[54:24] if they can get
[54:27] where fathers
[54:30] be get belittled
[54:33] and you know it's a serious form of
[54:36] child abuse is what it actually is
[54:40] and
[54:41] it's been entrenched within our systems
[54:46] powerful sexist people have a vested
[54:49] interest in diminishing the role of men
[54:52] especially their role as as fathers
[54:55] research proves that children Thrive
[54:58] with the active and meaningful
[55:01] participation of both biological parents
[55:05] and is true for post-divorce families
[55:08] also
[55:18] in 1999 August of of 1999 there was an
[55:23] article in Time magazine that was titled
[55:25] how man evolved
[55:27] you see they're trying to they're trying
[55:29] to put man and Humanity under this
[55:34] Evolution Theory
[55:36] and we know that evolution
[55:39] is absolutely unscriptural
[55:41] it has no Foundation
[55:45] in the scripture whatsoever
[55:48] but by using that they can try and
[55:51] implement it into such a way that to say
[55:54] well man is evolving
[55:58] and man is evolving to the point now
[56:00] where man can be a woman
[56:08] and if they could get that to you know
[56:11] to to the place where and it already is
[56:15] being fully adopted into society
[56:18] and into the school systems I heard this
[56:21] morning
[56:22] that one of our friends they're they're
[56:24] they're they're they're they're moving
[56:25] their child out of that school because
[56:28] their child came home and said Daddy am
[56:33] I a boy or a girl
[56:38] and they decided no way they're moving
[56:41] their children they're going to move
[56:43] them into a Catholic School System
[56:46] they'll do whatever it takes because
[56:48] they recognize well wait a minute here
[56:51] this is getting way too carried away
[56:54] like look at where we're at Saints when
[56:57] it gets that close to home you know
[57:00] things are right at the door
[57:05] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[57:08] this article makes numerous breathtaking
[57:11] assertions
[57:13] but basically what they're saying is
[57:15] this
[57:16] fathers aren't essential to the
[57:19] well-being of children
[57:21] gay lesbian and single parents are as
[57:25] good as any other
[57:29] heterosexual marriage isn't necessary to
[57:33] produce healthy well-adjusted
[57:37] children
[57:39] oh my God help us Jesus
[57:45] let's go to the next slide
[57:50] we're going to be reading from
[57:51] Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[57:54] verses 1 to 9.
[57:56] and we're going to be looking at um
[58:02] how your relationship that as a father
[58:06] if you don't have a right relationship
[58:09] with your heavenly father
[58:12] you'll have a hard time having
[58:15] a great relationship with your children
[58:19] now there's a lot of psychology out
[58:22] there there's a lot of teaching out
[58:23] there and you know there's people that
[58:26] they don't need the scripture they don't
[58:28] need the word of God they've decided to
[58:30] go to psychology they've decided to go
[58:32] to the teachings of man and that you
[58:35] know that communication is the key
[58:37] element you know you just communicate
[58:39] well with your children I'm not putting
[58:41] any of this down don't get me wrong you
[58:43] need proper communication you need to
[58:46] have time communication with your
[58:49] children it's very very important
[58:51] but they've left the word of God out of
[58:53] it
[58:54] you know I like as I was doing this
[58:57] study I came to realize I started to
[58:59] look at my whole life and I realized I
[59:01] didn't spend enough time with my
[59:02] children
[59:04] I did not spend enough time with my
[59:06] children I my lot was you know I was an
[59:09] entrepreneur I I was caught up with
[59:11] business I was caught up with with like
[59:14] you know growing up I grew up in a house
[59:17] where my dad where if I went to my dad
[59:19] and I said dad you know can I have 10
[59:22] cents to you know to go buy gum he say
[59:24] go get a job
[59:27] go get a newspaper go go cut lawns go
[59:30] shovel driveways you want money and I
[59:33] used to go to the store for him to get a
[59:35] pack of cigarettes bring it home and
[59:36] there'd be 10 cents left over and he's
[59:38] where's the dime
[59:40] he says you want it you earn it
[59:43] you go to work and I started as a young
[59:45] kid I realized that if I got to get if I
[59:47] want any of these things you know if I
[59:49] want a nice bike if I want something I'm
[59:51] gonna have to work for it if I want a
[59:53] car I'm going to need to work for it I
[59:55] bought my own car with my own money
[59:58] I worked for that money I bought all the
[1:00:00] things that as a young man and so you
[1:00:03] got to understand your upbringing and
[1:00:05] your your your your time as a child and
[1:00:08] growing up in the influences that you
[1:00:10] had from your father and your mother how
[1:00:13] to had a massive effect on your life
[1:00:16] my dad came to Canada in 1951 with ten
[1:00:20] dollars in his pocket and he knew
[1:00:24] absolutely nothing and he had to start a
[1:00:26] life completely on his own
[1:00:28] so his his understanding of life
[1:00:33] and how to get ahead it came on me
[1:00:38] certain things have come on you in the
[1:00:40] way that you were brought up and taught
[1:00:42] by your fathers and by your mothers
[1:00:45] and so when I looked at my life I
[1:00:47] realized my God I was working 15 16
[1:00:51] hours a day seven days a week thank God
[1:00:55] I had a wife that that that wanted to
[1:00:57] raise her children and be with her
[1:00:59] children and she spent time with those
[1:01:02] children when we had children she
[1:01:04] stopped working in order to raise those
[1:01:06] children that's how passionate it was
[1:01:09] about and we weren't financially capable
[1:01:11] of doing that
[1:01:13] but because she wanted to do it I said
[1:01:15] you do it
[1:01:17] because in my mind
[1:01:19] and I still think the same way I do what
[1:01:22] I gotta do
[1:01:23] in order to get ahead I do if I gotta
[1:01:27] work 16 hours a day I work 16 hours a
[1:01:29] day
[1:01:31] if I gotta go seven days a week I go
[1:01:33] seven days a week
[1:01:34] now obviously that's changing as I'm
[1:01:36] getting older
[1:01:40] [Applause]
[1:01:42] I can tell you that
[1:01:44] I don't I don't have the same
[1:01:47] it's not the same anymore
[1:01:49] up here
[1:01:50] but then when this thing tries to go
[1:01:52] it's like
[1:01:53] it's like holy smokes man what's the
[1:01:55] matter with this body it's not it's not
[1:01:57] responding in the same way
[1:02:01] but I come to realize there's stages in
[1:02:03] life
[1:02:04] but I looked back and I said Lord I
[1:02:06] didn't spend enough time with my kids I
[1:02:08] didn't give them the kind of nurturing
[1:02:10] that they needed
[1:02:12] it was
[1:02:19] difficult
[1:02:20] when you got it deal with it
[1:02:26] but God showed me
[1:02:30] when he called me
[1:02:33] he says
[1:02:35] I
[1:02:37] took your heart
[1:02:47] now these are the Commandments the
[1:02:49] statutes
[1:02:52] and the judgments which the Lord your
[1:02:54] God commanded
[1:02:56] to teach you
[1:02:58] that ye might do them in the land wither
[1:03:01] ye gold to possess it
[1:03:03] that thou mightest fear the lord thy God
[1:03:07] to keep all his statutes
[1:03:11] and his Commandments which I command
[1:03:13] thee
[1:03:15] thou
[1:03:17] and thy son
[1:03:19] and thy son's son son
[1:03:21] all the days of thy life and that thy
[1:03:24] days may be prolonged notice who he is
[1:03:28] speaking to
[1:03:30] he's speaking
[1:03:32] to the fathers he's speaking to the
[1:03:36] family he's speaking to the the
[1:03:39] individual this is speaking to each and
[1:03:42] every one of us here this morning
[1:03:44] if we don't have that right relationship
[1:03:47] with God we can never have the right
[1:03:49] relationship with our families our loved
[1:03:53] ones our children and get through the
[1:03:55] battles that you will have to fight
[1:03:58] it's not that you're going to have
[1:04:00] perfect relationships with your children
[1:04:06] I do not have perfect relationships
[1:04:09] with my children
[1:04:12] they are not serving the lord
[1:04:15] do I love them with all my heart
[1:04:19] but who do I love first
[1:04:23] he took my heart
[1:04:27] I am now a father
[1:04:30] but the father's Spirit has come upon me
[1:04:34] has come upon you as a father has come
[1:04:37] to test you and to see if you're really
[1:04:40] going to stand in this hour where
[1:04:42] fatherhood is under attack
[1:04:45] like never before
[1:04:54] here therefore
[1:04:56] verse 3.
[1:04:58] o Israel
[1:04:59] and observe to do it all these things
[1:05:02] while I was reading these scriptures and
[1:05:05] I realized you know like it's almost 30
[1:05:08] Years it'll be 30 years in in another
[1:05:12] year I guess 93 I came in 94. so it's 29
[1:05:16] years July that I was baptized
[1:05:20] and that the Lord took my heart
[1:05:24] and I realized all the things that have
[1:05:27] happened in those 29 years and how I
[1:05:31] raise those children how my wife and I
[1:05:33] raise them how we we were doing it
[1:05:36] because we loved God we came into a
[1:05:38] relationship with the Lord so when we
[1:05:40] discipline them we discipline them
[1:05:42] according to the word of God according
[1:05:45] to what God had showed us in our hearts
[1:05:47] and we believed it with all of our
[1:05:49] hearts that if we corrected them in the
[1:05:51] right way that God would not depart from
[1:05:53] them and I still believe it
[1:05:56] I will never stop believing it
[1:05:59] I will still correct them when they come
[1:06:01] to me and they say certain things and
[1:06:04] they you know and they give me their
[1:06:05] opinion I say I you know I appreciate
[1:06:09] your opinion
[1:06:11] but understand that it is not my opinion
[1:06:15] I don't agree with that
[1:06:18] and I need you to understand why I don't
[1:06:20] agree with that
[1:06:22] because I've made the word of God my
[1:06:25] absolute
[1:06:26] [Music]
[1:06:27] without the word of God as my absolute
[1:06:30] I'm done and so are you
[1:06:34] it's as simple as that
[1:06:37] as long as I can stay and stand and
[1:06:39] believe that word and there ain't
[1:06:41] nothing going to take me off it they're
[1:06:43] protected by the grace of God
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:47] they don't realize it they don't
[1:06:49] understand it but God
[1:06:51] will stand behind his word
[1:06:58] he says o Israel and observe to do it
[1:07:00] that it may be well with thee and that
[1:07:03] he may increase mightily as the Lord God
[1:07:06] of thy fathers hath promised thee in the
[1:07:09] land that floweth with milk and honey
[1:07:13] hear o Israel the Lord our God is one
[1:07:16] Lord oh he made that so clear
[1:07:19] oh that became such a reality that is
[1:07:22] the link you go and talk to any Jews
[1:07:25] they recite that they they will recite
[1:07:27] this on a daily basis they will say the
[1:07:29] Lord our God is one Lord and they will
[1:07:33] say and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:07:37] with all thine heart
[1:07:40] [Music]
[1:07:42] and with not just that with all thy soul
[1:07:46] and with all thy might you know what
[1:07:49] that is interpreted with everything that
[1:07:51] is within you love the Lord God
[1:07:54] make him your absolute
[1:07:58] as a father when you make God your
[1:08:00] absolute and you trust in God as your
[1:08:02] absolute he will stand behind his word
[1:08:09] Hallelujah glory to God Amen
[1:08:12] let's continue to read
[1:08:14] and these listen what he says here
[1:08:16] and you know and while I was reading all
[1:08:19] this it was just
[1:08:20] just encouraging me
[1:08:23] it was encouraging me he said in these
[1:08:26] words which I command thee this day
[1:08:28] shall be in thine heart
[1:08:30] it's in your heart and thou shalt teach
[1:08:33] them diligently unto thy children we sat
[1:08:36] we taught we got them to memorize
[1:08:38] scripture we had them in every Camp
[1:08:40] every Sunday school we did all all that
[1:08:44] we could to raise those children we we
[1:08:46] love them with with the love of God we
[1:08:49] we taught them the best that we could
[1:08:51] but then we come to realize they become
[1:08:53] adults
[1:08:55] and God doesn't have any grandchildren
[1:09:00] God has Sons and Daughters of God
[1:09:02] attributes of God
[1:09:05] and so they need to come to know him and
[1:09:08] they need to know when he gets a hold of
[1:09:10] their heart because I I wasn't looking
[1:09:12] for God I didn't give my heart to God
[1:09:16] if you know that you've come into a
[1:09:18] relationship with God God stole your
[1:09:20] heart
[1:09:21] God took it from you God God says you're
[1:09:25] mine now I I said Lord how's this
[1:09:27] possible how could I be so in love with
[1:09:30] you how could I possibly you know at my
[1:09:33] age I you know my life was a mess an
[1:09:36] absolute mess but he decided that when
[1:09:39] that love and when that love touches you
[1:09:42] saints that love of God it just changes
[1:09:45] everything
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] everything nothing can nothing can
[1:09:50] remain the same
[1:09:52] he says and thou shalt teach them diligy
[1:09:54] unto thy children shall talk shall talk
[1:09:57] of them when thou sit us in thine house
[1:09:59] and when thou walkest by the way and
[1:10:02] when thou liest down and when thou Rises
[1:10:05] up and thou shalt bind them for a sign
[1:10:08] upon thine hand and they shall be as
[1:10:12] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[1:10:16] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[1:10:19] house and on thy Gates and my God my
[1:10:23] wife and I every scripture we could
[1:10:25] possibly put up and every picture that
[1:10:28] we could put up we wanted the face of
[1:10:30] God we wanted to see the word of God we
[1:10:32] all we wanted was the word of God and we
[1:10:35] live that now you can't you know you
[1:10:37] hear of people you know you know some
[1:10:40] people will say well I've got a I've got
[1:10:42] a Pulpit in my house
[1:10:45] my kids come home I sit them down
[1:10:49] I stand and I preach him a message
[1:10:51] that doesn't work today
[1:10:54] that does not work today
[1:10:56] they've they they they're they're tuned
[1:10:59] out
[1:11:00] they're looking at their phone
[1:11:04] they're making sure that when you look
[1:11:05] down at the Bible they're looking at
[1:11:07] their phone
[1:11:08] they're tuned out they're not looking
[1:11:10] God needs to become a reality but what
[1:11:13] they will never forget
[1:11:16] is when they see you sitting there
[1:11:18] reading your Bible
[1:11:20] every day when they see you on your
[1:11:22] knees praying with your wife
[1:11:25] or your husband
[1:11:27] they'll never forget those things
[1:11:29] those are things that they will never
[1:11:31] forget they they won't forget those
[1:11:34] experiences that they had
[1:11:36] in the Lord
[1:11:37] because God
[1:11:39] promised that if we would do these
[1:11:42] things
[1:11:44] he would honor his word
[1:11:47] Hallelujah
[1:11:56] there's an attack
[1:11:58] on fathers
[1:12:00] and this morning
[1:12:03] we've got Arsenal
[1:12:06] to attack against it
[1:12:09] to attack against this influence this
[1:12:12] power this this teaching this it's all
[1:12:15] it's throughout the whole school system
[1:12:17] it's throughout the the judicial system
[1:12:20] everything is designed in such a way
[1:12:22] that children can can go fatherless that
[1:12:26] children don't need to have a father
[1:12:31] but if God gets a hold
[1:12:34] of us which he has done
[1:12:38] it changes everything
[1:12:41] the power and the influence that's out
[1:12:43] there cannot have power
[1:12:46] over you
[1:12:47] as a son or a daughter of God
[1:12:50] because
[1:12:52] he's got your heart
[1:12:54] he's got your heart listen to the next
[1:12:57] scripture here go to the next slide
[1:13:03] perhaps of a good man are ordered by the
[1:13:04] Lord and he delighteth in his ways
[1:13:08] though he fall he shall not be utterly
[1:13:11] cast out we will make mistakes
[1:13:15] we will you know like this is the whole
[1:13:18] thing this is what the the the healing
[1:13:20] bomb here that God you know laid on my
[1:13:23] heart this morning to to minister to you
[1:13:26] this morning there's a healing bomb here
[1:13:28] that God he's he's he's he's gone beyond
[1:13:32] all of the the things that you see right
[1:13:36] now you're you're looking at you know
[1:13:37] some of us are looking at our families
[1:13:38] we're looking at our children we're
[1:13:40] looking at the circumstances around it
[1:13:42] and we can get very discouraged when we
[1:13:45] do that
[1:13:46] but God says you shall not be utterly
[1:13:49] cast down you're sure you're going to
[1:13:51] make mistakes sure you're going to do
[1:13:52] things that are that are wrong you know
[1:13:55] you're going to say things that are
[1:13:56] wrong but God says I'm going to raise
[1:13:58] you up by my hand

[1:14:02] I'm gonna make a way for you
[1:14:05] Hallelujah
[1:14:07] glory to God Amen
[1:14:12] I want you to go to the next slide
[1:14:18] in Deuteronomy 5 28
[1:14:20] and 29 uh now you need to understand the
[1:14:23] setting here
[1:14:25] this is where Moses was
[1:14:28] um you know with the children of Israel
[1:14:30] out in the wilderness and they had
[1:14:33] approached God and they didn't want
[1:14:35] God's voice
[1:14:37] they didn't want to hear God's voice
[1:14:39] coming directly from God because it it
[1:14:42] was it was too much for them it would it
[1:14:45] was destroying them they would die they
[1:14:46] would touch the mountain they would die
[1:14:48] they said no no you speak through Moses
[1:14:51] you you uh it's Moses you go and you go
[1:14:55] before God and and you get the the the
[1:14:58] teaching you get the understanding and
[1:15:00] then you bring it to us and God heard
[1:15:03] that and the Lord heard the voice of of
[1:15:06] your words when you spake unto me and
[1:15:09] the Lord said unto me because Moses now
[1:15:11] he's talking to the people okay you
[1:15:13] gotta put this into context he's talking
[1:15:15] to the people and he's saying that you
[1:15:17] know the Lord heard you when you said
[1:15:20] that when you decided that you would
[1:15:22] allow me to be your voice allow me to be
[1:15:25] the voice of God aren't you glad that
[1:15:28] God has sent prophets
[1:15:31] aren't you thankful that God sent us a
[1:15:33] prophet Malachi 4 in order to turn the
[1:15:36] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:15:38] of the fathers aren't you grateful to
[1:15:41] know because there's a lot of teaching
[1:15:43] out there on the word of God and there's
[1:15:45] a lot of teaching on on being a father
[1:15:48] and there's a lot of principles and if
[1:15:50] you apply those principles you can be a
[1:15:52] good father but yet we're not talking
[1:15:54] about fathers that are just in the world
[1:15:56] here we're talking about the Rapture
[1:15:59] we're talking about Sons and Daughters
[1:16:02] of God that are in positions as fathers
[1:16:05] that need to understand the day the
[1:16:07] season the hour that we're living in and
[1:16:10] how important it is to have the
[1:16:12] revelation of what God is doing in our
[1:16:15] day and that God has sent us a message
[1:16:18] that God has sent us a prophet to to
[1:16:21] interpret the word of God to turn our
[1:16:23] hearts back to the original word
[1:16:25] you can you can take the teachings of
[1:16:28] the of the scriptures that I just read
[1:16:30] you and yet there's all kinds of
[1:16:33] ministers that are teaching these
[1:16:35] scriptures
[1:16:36] but they don't have the same effect
[1:16:38] as it would to a son or a daughter of
[1:16:41] God
[1:16:42] this is this is the hour where we are
[1:16:45] being we are being transformed by the
[1:16:48] word of God
[1:16:50] we're not just normal fathers and
[1:16:52] mothers we're attributes of God
[1:16:56] we're more than just a mother we're more
[1:16:59] than just a father
[1:17:01] not because we did anything special
[1:17:03] but because we've been given the ability
[1:17:06] to recognize the word for our day
[1:17:09] we've been given the ability to
[1:17:11] recognize rapturing faith
[1:17:14] there's a reason why I believe the word
[1:17:17] of God and I believe in the relationship
[1:17:19] that I have with my heavenly father
[1:17:21] there's more than just a father-son
[1:17:24] relationship here there's a relationship
[1:17:27] in the Supernatural there's a
[1:17:30] relationship that changes our complete
[1:17:32] walk it changes our homes it changes our
[1:17:36] atmospheres it has an effect upon
[1:17:38] everything that we do because we are not
[1:17:42] just normal fathers and mothers we are
[1:17:44] Sons and Daughters of the Living God
[1:17:48] and we're being we're being perfected
[1:17:52] for a rapture
[1:17:54] we're being changed here a little
[1:17:56] they're a little
[1:17:58] this is more than just a Father's Day
[1:18:01] sermon this morning
[1:18:02] there's more here there's there's
[1:18:04] something here that we need to we we
[1:18:06] need to connect with we need to
[1:18:08] understand that as an attribute of God
[1:18:11] there's a supernatural element that is
[1:18:14] taking place
[1:18:15] and here Jesus or God was was telling
[1:18:20] now Moses telling the people that God
[1:18:22] had told him that the Lord said unto me
[1:18:24] I have heard the voice of the words of
[1:18:26] this people
[1:18:28] you are that special people
[1:18:30] you are that special people that have
[1:18:32] come out under a prophet Ministry
[1:18:35] that are now entering into that perfect
[1:18:38] land that would that that we're being
[1:18:41] translated into the promised land we're
[1:18:43] in that transition right now everything
[1:18:45] is in tight form here
[1:18:48] and we need to realize that we are the
[1:18:50] people we've heard and uh we've heard
[1:18:53] the voice of the words of this people
[1:18:55] I've heard the Lord says which they have
[1:18:57] spoken unto thee they have well said all
[1:19:01] that they have spoken God was pleased
[1:19:04] God is pleased when you when you repeat
[1:19:07] back and you say yes God sent us a
[1:19:10] prophet God sent us a a sign God sent us
[1:19:14] a message that is turning our hearts
[1:19:16] back to the original word
[1:19:18] it's it's it's greater than just a a
[1:19:21] Christian teaching amen all that there
[1:19:25] were such an heart in them that they
[1:19:29] would fear me and keep all my
[1:19:32] Commandments always that it might be
[1:19:34] well with them and with their children
[1:19:37] forever
[1:19:40] I want you to know
[1:19:42] that God sent
[1:19:45] William Miriam Branham
[1:19:48] into a Christian chaos
[1:19:52] where churches
[1:19:54] were believing and trusting in their own
[1:19:57] teachings
[1:19:59] man's teachings man's interpretation on
[1:20:02] the word of God
[1:20:03] everything has been man's interpretation
[1:20:07] but the holy spirit is still his own
[1:20:09] interpreter
[1:20:10] he's still the one that's making it
[1:20:12] plain what it is to be a true son and
[1:20:15] daughter of the Living God
[1:20:17] what it means to be a real father
[1:20:20] in your office you're not really listen
[1:20:23] I'm a father here
[1:20:25] Pastor Simon is my pastor he's a father
[1:20:29] he's a grandfather
[1:20:31] he's a son
[1:20:33] we're all
[1:20:35] living in these different offices
[1:20:39] but who are you really
[1:20:43] you're an attribute of God brother Gabe
[1:20:47] you're a part of God
[1:20:49] only God
[1:20:51] if the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:20:54] from the dead dwell in you it's going to
[1:20:56] Quicken your mortal body
[1:20:58] it's going to Quicken you into that
[1:20:59] other dimension when you move into that
[1:21:02] other dimension you're gonna you're
[1:21:04] gonna it's like going through a door
[1:21:05] when you get to that other side you're
[1:21:07] going to look at your hands you're going
[1:21:08] to look at your body you're going to
[1:21:09] look into the mirror and you're going to
[1:21:10] see that young absolutely perfect
[1:21:13] attribute body of Jesus Christ the body
[1:21:17] reflected you as an attribute you are
[1:21:20] part of God
[1:21:21] you're not going to be a father there
[1:21:23] you're not going to be a mother there
[1:21:26] but you are here
[1:21:28] and you've got a battle between those
[1:21:31] two dimensions
[1:21:32] and there's a great attack
[1:21:35] constantly on you as a father and as you
[1:21:38] a mother
[1:21:46] let's look at some scriptures but I'm
[1:21:48] not going to be keeping you along here
[1:21:49] we're going to be done within 15 minutes
[1:21:53] we're looking at the heart of a father
[1:21:56] in PR in Psalms 37 31
[1:22:00] it says the law of his God is in his
[1:22:04] heart
[1:22:06] God took our hearts
[1:22:10] and he put his law within our hearts
[1:22:13] and that is the overcoming power that's
[1:22:16] in you
[1:22:17] none of his steps shall slide aren't you
[1:22:21] glad
[1:22:23] these are his promises
[1:22:25] aren't you glad to know that he's taken
[1:22:27] your heart
[1:22:28] and that more than that he's taken your
[1:22:31] life he's he's put it into his hand he
[1:22:34] says not not one is going to be plucked
[1:22:36] out brother Phil
[1:22:37] the one is going to be lost all that the
[1:22:40] father hath given me will come
[1:22:44] not one of them is going to be lost
[1:22:46] can't you see the beauty in this promise
[1:22:49] in the word of God can't you see that
[1:22:51] that you know when when we reflect on
[1:22:54] these things
[1:22:55] we get we get encouraged to keep
[1:22:58] pressing on and we we look at those
[1:23:00] circumstances with our homes with our
[1:23:02] children with sickness with with
[1:23:04] financial issues we look at all those
[1:23:06] things but they have only a temporary
[1:23:09] effect on you if you allow it to control
[1:23:13] you
[1:23:16] there you go
[1:23:18] next Psalms 40. I Delight to do thy will
[1:23:23] o my God
[1:23:25] yea thy law is written
[1:23:29] is within my heart
[1:23:34] it's there
[1:23:35] David knew
[1:23:37] David knew listen I could give you so
[1:23:40] many you think David
[1:23:42] was a good father
[1:23:46] he had problems
[1:23:47] [Laughter]
[1:23:51] he had a son that wanted to kill him
[1:23:56] these are examples of fathers in the
[1:23:58] Bible
[1:24:01] if he was such a good father why would
[1:24:02] he go and commit adultery
[1:24:05] BC then he came to know
[1:24:11] that God's law was written in his heart
[1:24:12] you know what God's law was
[1:24:15] my word shall not return unto me void
[1:24:18] it will accomplish that which I have
[1:24:20] sent it forth to accomplish
[1:24:22] you might look at your circumstances you
[1:24:24] might look at your mistakes as a father
[1:24:26] you might look at your mistakes as a
[1:24:28] mother but God is looking at his
[1:24:30] attribute
[1:24:31] God is looking at his word
[1:24:34] God is looking at his his promises his
[1:24:37] will his plan his purpose and it is to
[1:24:41] bring you home
[1:24:45] next scripture Psalms 119 Thy word have
[1:24:49] I hid in my heart that I might not sin
[1:24:52] against thee
[1:24:54] you don't have a desire to sin as a son
[1:24:56] or a daughter of God
[1:24:59] but all you could do was take that word
[1:25:01] and place it there this thing makes
[1:25:04] mistakes this thing it falls it it gets
[1:25:07] tired it gets upset it says things that
[1:25:11] it shouldn't say but God has allowed you
[1:25:14] to hide his word within your heart
[1:25:18] you know heart in the Bible and mind
[1:25:20] when you look it up they mean the same
[1:25:23] thing
[1:25:25] with all your heart
[1:25:27] with all your soul
[1:25:29] with all your mind
[1:25:31] it's all God
[1:25:34] saying I'm there
[1:25:36] I have made a way for you you will not
[1:25:39] fail
[1:25:40] you will overcome
[1:25:44] Colossians 3 16 let the word of Christ
[1:25:48] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:25:51] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:25:55] Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:25:58] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[1:26:02] Lord
[1:26:02] let it permeate you
[1:26:06] aside from today that I will sing the
[1:26:09] glory of God I will sing the Praises of
[1:26:11] the Lord I will receive what he has
[1:26:14] given me the overcoming power to to to
[1:26:17] overcome in this Dimension to overcome
[1:26:19] in an age where everything is attacking
[1:26:23] the the the the truth of God's word this
[1:26:26] is an attack against God's word
[1:26:28] remember a father represents
[1:26:32] the home
[1:26:34] our heavenly father had a plan he put
[1:26:38] Adam and Eve into the garden he wanted
[1:26:39] to express himself so that he could have
[1:26:42] fellowship and the enemy the enemy has
[1:26:45] not changed he's still attacking the
[1:26:48] relationship what did he do when he went
[1:26:51] to Eve he was attacking the relationship
[1:26:54] he was attacking the relationship that
[1:26:57] they had with God the father Jesus
[1:26:59] didn't come to the Earth
[1:27:01] to it to to to to to make himself great
[1:27:04] he says I come
[1:27:06] to express the father
[1:27:10] all that I do
[1:27:12] the father shows me what I do he shows
[1:27:15] me what I need to do
[1:27:17] all the father hath given me will come
[1:27:20] I and the father are one
[1:27:23] you see he was expressing what we are to
[1:27:26] express as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:27:29] that we are one with God we are one with
[1:27:32] the Holy Spirit
[1:27:35] and so as we wind down now I just got a
[1:27:38] couple of quotes here
[1:27:40] but these quotes really touch my heart
[1:27:42] you know
[1:27:43] um
[1:27:45] there's a quote here
[1:27:46] where brother Branham is talking about
[1:27:51] from the message Jehovah Jireh
[1:27:54] and now I want you to understand the
[1:27:57] context of by which I've I'm going to
[1:27:59] read you this quote and understand this
[1:28:01] quote that Abraham
[1:28:03] is a father
[1:28:05] and God is going God goes to Abraham and
[1:28:08] says I want you to go to the mountain
[1:28:11] and I want you to sacrifice
[1:28:14] your son
[1:28:16] he says take the wood take this take a
[1:28:18] night get everything you need go there
[1:28:20] you're going to offer me your son now
[1:28:23] can you imagine what Abraham went
[1:28:25] through listen
[1:28:27] he says now notice as they go up the
[1:28:29] hill Abraham packing the fire
[1:28:32] and when they got up there he said
[1:28:34] father he said here I am he said here is
[1:28:38] the wood and here is the fire here is
[1:28:40] the altar but where is the Lamb for the
[1:28:43] sacrifice
[1:28:46] oh could you imagine that Father's Heart
[1:28:50] pumping hard
[1:28:52] his only child where is the sacrifice
[1:28:56] Abraham choking back the tears think of
[1:28:59] your own self choking back the tears
[1:29:02] with a stern look towards heaven he said
[1:29:04] my son
[1:29:06] God will provide for himself a lamb for
[1:29:11] the sacrifice
[1:29:12] you've had hard times with your children
[1:29:15] you've had hard situations in your life
[1:29:18] that you've had to deal with you've had
[1:29:20] situations that you didn't think you
[1:29:22] could get through it you didn't know if
[1:29:24] you would be able to do that or say that
[1:29:27] or or have to stand the way that you
[1:29:30] stood
[1:29:31] but something in you rolls up
[1:29:36] Abraham
[1:29:37] he said turn around he said God will
[1:29:40] provide himself he said turn around
[1:29:42] Isaac turn your back to me son he did
[1:29:45] Isaac thought what's this it's leather
[1:29:48] cords taking my hands surely father
[1:29:51] understands what he's doing around his
[1:29:54] feet with some cords tied them together
[1:29:56] he looked over Abraham looked at him
[1:29:58] brushed back his hair out of his eyes
[1:30:01] kissed him on the cheek he says God be
[1:30:04] with you my son laid him upon the altar
[1:30:07] do you think Abraham had a revelation of
[1:30:09] God
[1:30:11] do you think he knew where he stood
[1:30:13] in the midst coming into a situation
[1:30:16] like that do you think that he
[1:30:18] understood do you think that maybe God
[1:30:20] had taken his heart
[1:30:22] and he understood that that there's
[1:30:24] nothing that that can separate him from
[1:30:26] the love of God
[1:30:29] and laid upon him laid him on the altar
[1:30:33] look back choking back the tears little
[1:30:35] Isaac obedient to death not asking a
[1:30:37] question Abraham pulled a big knife from
[1:30:40] his sheath from the knife from his
[1:30:43] sheath brushed back the hair away from
[1:30:45] his Little Neck looked up to God and
[1:30:47] started to take the life of his own son
[1:30:51] just as he raised his hand the Holy
[1:30:53] Spirit caught his hand and said Abraham
[1:30:57] stand your hand
[1:31:00] God is going to keep you
[1:31:02] God is going to stand your hand God is
[1:31:05] going to hold your hand God is going to
[1:31:07] when when things get tough and rough and
[1:31:09] hard in this life as a father or as a
[1:31:12] mother you don't worry you might stumble
[1:31:15] you might fall but God is going to hold
[1:31:16] your hand because at the last moment

[1:31:57] people could not do but you're standing

[1:34:34] minutes and he run up there and they
[1:34:36] wrapped him in blankets and rushed him
[1:34:38] to the hospital and I run out real quick
[1:34:40] here come the doctor down like dot took
[1:34:43] off his hat said Billy I've killed your
[1:34:44] boy

[1:34:51] over him and everything and pumping and
[1:34:53] giving him adrenaline over his heart and
[1:34:55] he was just heart going on down and down
[1:34:59] I said could I be with him a moment
[1:35:02] and so he just walked out of the room I
[1:35:04] knelt down put my hands upon him I said

[1:35:09] how many of us have gotten down
[1:35:12] and said oh God please

[1:35:16] situation is right now that you're

[1:35:45] looked and I saw a vision of him falling
[1:35:47] like that turning over and over like it
[1:35:50] was a couple of nights before that when
[1:35:52] I seen him in the vision and I seen two
[1:35:55] big arms come out and catch him
[1:35:59] like this and started burying him right
[1:36:02] back up going right back up like that I
[1:36:05] raised up and Billy turned around just
[1:36:08] as black as he could be and his lips
[1:36:10] swelled way out and his eyes turned real
[1:36:13] red and turned back he said Daddy

[1:36:31] God is he's our heavenly father
[1:36:34] Hallelujah he's our heavenly father and
[1:36:38] our position as husbands are to to to
[1:36:41] declare that we are spiritual
[1:36:45] fathers in this Society
[1:36:48] we're not just normal fathers
[1:36:51] we're fathers that stand on the word of
[1:36:53] God
[1:36:55] God bless you Saints
[1:36:57] [Applause]
[1:37:11] foreign
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:41] I know
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:38:20] through
[1:38:24] it is
[1:38:26] [Music]
[1:39:10] it's time
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:26] [Music]
[1:39:30] yes I
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:46] am happy
[1:39:51] [Music]
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:40:04] how wonderful to know
[1:40:07] we have a father like this that we
[1:40:10] appreciate with all our hearts and the
[1:40:13] reason is because we have a revelation
[1:40:16] and understanding of the depths of what
[1:40:20] he has done for us
[1:40:23] self for for his own you know the
[1:40:26] scripture tells us Jesus was his son but
[1:40:28] we know the father was in the son was
[1:40:30] actually God gave himself
[1:40:33] for his own
[1:40:35] Jesus said and loving his own he loved
[1:40:38] them unto death
[1:40:39] he didn't say he loved him until death
[1:40:42] when he died then his love ended but
[1:40:45] he's telling you
[1:40:46] I love you until you die your death and
[1:40:51] you come back to me
[1:40:53] loving his own he loved them unto death
[1:40:58] not his death their death because of
[1:41:01] their death releases them
[1:41:03] it frees them it sends them back where
[1:41:06] they come from because they're not just
[1:41:09] Mortals of Earth
[1:41:11] they're not of time they are of Eternity
[1:41:14] they are not of the seven day week but
[1:41:17] they are of the Eighth Day the Eternal
[1:41:20] day and we are glad that we are already
[1:41:22] a part of it in our spirit in our soul
[1:41:26] we are in there praise the name of the
[1:41:28] Lord I want to thank the Lord Jesus for
[1:41:32] this uh talk this wonderful message our
[1:41:35] brother brought as he applied the token
[1:41:40] see I can stand and preach the message
[1:41:42] wonderfully bringing forth The Marvelous
[1:41:45] things out of the word but applying the
[1:41:48] token to the situation to the needs it's
[1:41:53] a different matter
[1:41:54] so the application of that talk no on
[1:41:57] this specific day which relates the
[1:42:00] fathers and the needs of fathers and
[1:42:04] specifically I thought I touched on uh
[1:42:07] the influence of fathers I'm not going
[1:42:09] to preach one another sermon I'm just
[1:42:11] going to talk about 10 minutes or so
[1:42:14] because our brother certainly touched on
[1:42:17] the fact of Abraham
[1:42:19] and how God reflected himself in
[1:42:24] Abraham's life really God was trying to
[1:42:27] show the world and to show the human
[1:42:30] race this is what I am going to do this
[1:42:34] is the price I am willing to pay right
[1:42:37] and Abraham was willing to pay that uh
[1:42:40] price amen now um
[1:42:44] we understand clearly here friends that
[1:42:48] the position of being a father is both a
[1:42:51] very solemn and sacred position right
[1:42:54] it's a sacred and a solemn role and not
[1:42:59] to take it simply as it is out there in
[1:43:02] the world the uh you know people feel
[1:43:05] the young men young women you just go
[1:43:07] out there and they're they're making
[1:43:10] children and all this stuff but that
[1:43:11] just means you're a male
[1:43:13] or that you're a female
[1:43:15] but fatherhood is a different matter
[1:43:19] altogether
[1:43:20] so it's a sacred thing
[1:43:23] it's an obligation it's something we
[1:43:26] need to dedicate ourselves to but the
[1:43:30] grace of God within our lives as was
[1:43:33] Said Today We Are Spiritual fathers with
[1:43:35] spiritual understanding amen now
[1:43:40] many years ago one woman was dying
[1:43:44] and as she was dying she said to her
[1:43:47] husband
[1:43:48] bring all the children with you when you
[1:43:51] are coming home
[1:43:53] and I'll meet you on the other side
[1:43:56] she's talking about bringing all the
[1:43:58] children that he could with him when he
[1:44:01] goes back into the presence of the
[1:44:03] Living God that should be our desire to
[1:44:06] do that and that should be in the heart
[1:44:09] of every father to do that now with the
[1:44:12] opening of the word relation of this
[1:44:15] message we understand that in the early
[1:44:17] days of the message
[1:44:19] fathers Believers made lots of mistakes
[1:44:24] a lot of things that were not right
[1:44:28] because we felt that we need to make
[1:44:31] sure we
[1:44:33] um
[1:44:34] almost forced the children to be in
[1:44:36] church
[1:44:37] to be at Sunday school to be at all
[1:44:40] these uh religious events that we have
[1:44:42] to have
[1:44:43] and
[1:44:45] um yeah we did that and it had to be
[1:44:48] done in the early stages of the message
[1:44:50] when it was just coming and unveiling
[1:44:53] itself to us but now we understand
[1:44:57] um even you know that it's all salvation
[1:45:01] is by election
[1:45:03] is that right
[1:45:05] salvation is by revelation
[1:45:09] it's not just my somebody running up to
[1:45:12] the altar saying oh I love Jesus I give
[1:45:13] you my heart and oh you've got him
[1:45:15] you're saved no no no no no no it's by
[1:45:19] election this is what the prophet taught
[1:45:21] so
[1:45:22] once we know it's by election
[1:45:25] God gave you your children but you don't
[1:45:28] know amongst those children
[1:45:31] of who they are what they are whether
[1:45:35] they're going to be in his presence out
[1:45:36] of his presence but what he commanded us
[1:45:39] is to love them
[1:45:42] love them and lead them to him and to
[1:45:47] his influence as long as you can
[1:45:50] they will become adults and they will
[1:45:52] make their own choice of what they will
[1:45:56] do but while they're under your
[1:45:58] jurisdiction on your leadership you do
[1:46:01] the best that you can in leading them
[1:46:04] close to the Lord and so the age of
[1:46:09] pushing wrestling lasso
[1:46:12] tying them up and uh no no no no no no
[1:46:15] we're not here to Brand them with a with
[1:46:18] a with a B on there
[1:46:21] I'm sorry I'm I said I wasn't going to
[1:46:24] preach but anyway
[1:46:26] um what I'm saying is that the influence
[1:46:29] of fathers are very very important
[1:46:32] especially in this wicked and chaotic
[1:46:34] age and we in which we live because
[1:46:38] whether you like it or not it's
[1:46:40] somewhere or the other you are
[1:46:42] influencing your children
[1:46:44] you may not like it but that's the way
[1:46:46] it is whether for good or for evil you
[1:46:50] are bringing some influence upon their
[1:46:52] lives and I believe that every father in
[1:46:57] some way should be secretly admired by
[1:47:01] his children
[1:47:03] some even if it's one thing in him his
[1:47:06] children ought to look up to him and
[1:47:08] admire him for that one thing that they
[1:47:11] can see in his life now we know that
[1:47:15] Abraham will beg God in all things he he
[1:47:20] just obeyed God and I believe every
[1:47:22] father ought to obey God obey God's word
[1:47:25] and live according to God's word Abraham
[1:47:29] was also very much concerned about
[1:47:32] others
[1:47:33] right concerned about others when Sodom
[1:47:37] was going to be destroyed he turned to
[1:47:40] God and he says if there was 40 you
[1:47:43] think you might spare them yeah he says
[1:47:45] yeah I I think I'll spare them well he
[1:47:48] goes down he brings the number down 40
[1:47:50] you know 30 20 down to 10 he said yeah
[1:47:54] if I can find 10. but he couldn't even
[1:47:56] find 10. but the fact I'm bringing out
[1:47:59] is that Abraham was not only concerned
[1:48:04] about himself and his own family but he
[1:48:08] had a concern for others
[1:48:10] and the influence of a father should go
[1:48:14] out first to his children to his family
[1:48:16] and then it should go out also for
[1:48:19] others because children in the
[1:48:21] neighborhood neighbors neighbors all
[1:48:24] around they are watching and they are
[1:48:27] receiving your influence whether you
[1:48:30] like it or not we know also that Abraham
[1:48:35] had held nothing back from God he did
[1:48:39] not hold back even his from giving God
[1:48:41] his son
[1:48:42] giving God his child giving everything
[1:48:46] to God and we should hold nothing back
[1:48:49] from God we should give our all to him
[1:48:52] for his glory and for his honor one day
[1:48:56] time will blend right into
[1:48:59] eternity
[1:49:00] and each father is going to be asked
[1:49:03] what did you do with this Jesus called
[1:49:07] the Christ what did you do with the
[1:49:09] revelation of the word that you did
[1:49:13] receive what did you do for your
[1:49:17] children what did you do with your
[1:49:20] children uh did you were you concerned
[1:49:23] with them were you a part of their lives
[1:49:26] amen I believe when this life's journey
[1:49:30] is finished
[1:49:32] and our race is all done
[1:49:36] when our work is over and as the old
[1:49:39] song says when the bibles are closed
[1:49:41] upon the altar what then my friends I
[1:49:46] want you to know certainly that at that
[1:49:49] time we should be able to stand and look
[1:49:52] into the face of our Lord and savior and
[1:49:55] just say these few words Lord
[1:49:59] I just did what I could
[1:50:02] you did what you could and you did it
[1:50:05] with your whole heart and that's all God
[1:50:07] asks us to do
[1:50:09] what you can and so to every father
[1:50:12] that's here today I pray God will let
[1:50:16] you know you have influence whether you
[1:50:19] recognize it or not you have influence
[1:50:22] and that you that influence touches your
[1:50:26] children as our brother spoke of uh
[1:50:29] today of his father's influence my
[1:50:32] father's influence amen but the
[1:50:36] influence of that Earthly father that I
[1:50:39] had who has now gone on
[1:50:41] that influences molded the physical part
[1:50:45] but I have another influence
[1:50:47] and that's the part that I'm relying on
[1:50:50] now my heavenly father influences me his
[1:50:54] word influences me his word changes me
[1:50:58] his word transforms me praise the name
[1:51:01] of the Lord and he's pleased while I'm
[1:51:02] saying this praise God I just want you
[1:51:05] to know that our gracious heavenly
[1:51:08] father is is certainly a wonderful
[1:51:11] father and I'm glad that I I just
[1:51:14] accepted him as my father and I did not
[1:51:18] just take him but he took me and he
[1:51:21] caused me to recognize him and that's
[1:51:23] the reason why I'm here today by the
[1:51:26] grace of God hallelujah aren't you glad
[1:51:28] that you could be a child of God
[1:51:31] aren't you glad that you can be one of
[1:51:34] them
[1:51:35] praise the name of the Lord we have here
[1:51:37] this wonderful Bulletin
[1:51:41] and this was designed by our sister
[1:51:44] Marsha
[1:51:46] and in in uh collaboration with the a
[1:51:51] lot of the young people young men women
[1:51:55] or should I say children in the church
[1:52:00] and now we've ended up with this
[1:52:03] beautiful bulletin which you can have
[1:52:06] one at the end of this service praise
[1:52:10] the name of the Lord now let's go back
[1:52:12] and sing that hymn that chorus
[1:52:15] sing it with meaning and with
[1:52:18] understanding and also not just sing but
[1:52:23] Paul said sing with understanding sing
[1:52:25] with Revelation So Close Your Eyes slip
[1:52:29] your hand up and then don't sing to me
[1:52:32] When I close my eyes and I began to sing
[1:52:35] like that I'm singing to the Lord my
[1:52:39] heart is going out to him because the
[1:52:41] prophet said the one whom you worship
[1:52:44] you can't see him but one day he'll be
[1:52:48] made personalized before you
[1:52:50] make himself manifest first in the word
[1:52:52] and then he'll make himself physically
[1:52:54] uh available to you that you will see
[1:52:57] him with your eyes amen you're singing
[1:53:00] here one day and all of a sudden he
[1:53:01] decides to appear what are you going to
[1:53:03] do amen praise the Lord if these things
[1:53:06] are not gone these days are not passed
[1:53:08] Bible days are still here praise the

[1:53:26] don't have to make up stories it's real
[1:53:29] but the people today have not seen any
[1:53:32] of it so therefore they have a bit of uh
[1:53:35] quibble about it you know but let me
