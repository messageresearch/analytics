hour we know they're Believers but it's the physical parting from your loved ones until you meet again is still difficult amen right both for the children and also for the dad but there's no way that you're going to have somebody in your life for 20 30 40 50 years and then all of a sudden you disappear and you don't feel it right uh anybody will feel it and God says we need to grieve but don't grieve with excessive grief left you lest you make the Sinners say uh why are they grieving so much it looks like they don't believe they'll meet their loved ones again right so we have to grieve but with a balance in that grief so we thank the Lord for that and thank you for allowing me to take the time to express this because even though they are not here if they were to listen to this cing today they'll hear the Expressions uh that we made and trusting that it will strengthen and comfort them and more so we will take our presence and go there God bless you now let's turn our attention to the word of God Amen Hebrews 10 11-2 and the topic today is why do we take the Lord [Music] before we read the scripture let us pray and ask God's blessing you find it Hebrews 10 11 to2 let us pray our dear God our gracious Heavenly Father we are so blessed thank you for the offices in the church every member we thank you for the service the soft worship service and the blessing we receive from it as we sung hymns of Praise praising our great Redeemer for Redemption by Blood thank you Father we give you praise bless the word now and bless for gathering together for this time of a love Feast this time of a memorial that we are to take and we pray that you bless our coming together in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you all and every priest stand up daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of of God hallelujah God bless you please be seated on the Old Testament dispensation or in the Old Testament you will find that no sacrifice that was ever offered by any priest was of sufficient value to pay the sin the depth of sin that the human race ow it could not suffice and it could not take also it was not logical that the blood of one animal or 10 million animals could accr to the value of one Soul much less the that for the sins of the world it was not possible and so the priest found himself with a dilemma where they had to come offering sacrifices and offerings that would call their sins but not wash away their sins it could not take away the stain and the guilt of sin so over and over the priest had to come offering the same sacrifice over and over again and at the same time while it covered their sins it shows that it was not efficacious it was not effective enough and that's the reason why he had to come again and again and again bringing the same sacrifices because as we would say today it wasn't working yes amen it just wasn't working but it worked just enough where God accepted it as a substitute God accepted it as a covering until the real lamb the real do came on the seed and we know that to be the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bily amen so the priests were Faithful Men we're not putting them down they were faithful amen but what they did never put away sin it never did it but their position was a symbol of the great high priest who would come and offer the Eternal sacrifice that would take away sin so they had to play their part in the drama of redemption as types as shadows as symbols of what was to come amen you see the Old Testament uh is casting Shadow it's like a shadow being cast so that you know what's coming right that's what it is what was in the Old Testament concealed in tes and general is now in the New Testament revealed am you see it was concealed but now it's revealed amen it was hidden then but now it's made know that said it was a mystery now it's a revelation and we are the recipients in the beneficiaries of the rising of the Sun the light of the word that has been brought to us amen praise the Lord so they came to God in faith and because they came in faith God honored that faith God honored it and waited for the real sacrifice to come so when they confess their sins it does not cancel their sins it only cover their sin it didn't cleanse the sin it just uh scooted over and covered the sin that they had praise the Lord let me put it this way it's just as much like if someone owed a a note you owed a debt just a minute give me a chance to move this I can hear it uh giving some funny sounds and I'd like to corage that okay I think it will work better there all right so this man PA a certain sum of money just as much as we owe the debt we couldn't pay he ow the sum of money and what happen is when you b a son ofone a sum of money right away you bought it from someone right you go and borrow the devil's stuff you going to have to pay and the thing about it is that they're going to make you sign a note you have to sign some note sign your name to it that you commit yourself to pay that debt and then you pay the debt and it might be for 6 months and maybe for a year or whatever uh but when the time comes and you end up not having the money to pay the debt then what do you have to do you have to renegotiate and renew the debt at the higher interest rates rate and and sign the that again so in a nice way I'm trying to tell you that's what the sinner was doing in the Old Testament he was signing a note to pay but yet not knowing how he could pay right keep signing a note and every time he resigns the not the Deb is getting higher praise the Lord of course not some of you have never been in debt so you don't really know about it but those who have been in death uh uh are fully aware of it and you have to pay it so sometimes when a man has the death and it's mounting up it's getting to a uncontrollable level and the bleeding is not stopping and all you trying to bail out the water getting in your boat of Life the water is coming in faster than you can bail it out are you listening to me now it's it's coming in faster than you can bail it out and so you're hoping that you somehow something will happen a miracle will take place I wouldn't say that you're going to win the Bingo or the lottery or something like that but you're hoping something will happen and the bills are ping up and you left Hess you left miserable helpless you can't sleep in the night I know what I'm talking about I've been there praise the Lord don't look at me like you haven't been there you've been there the sweaty Pals and waking up at the night with you know cold sweat on you because they want their money and you got to pay and you don't know where it's coming from everything else but you know if you happen to have a wealthy friend and that friend happened to know that you were in that kind of a position and that friend of his own choice decided to help you out bail you out take you out of that situation that friend will come with you when you're going back to sign that Lord and that friend will do what come to sign and say look yes he going to have to pay you his de by confessing his sin but I come to sign him to say I am taking full responsibility for this day thank you right amen all he's got to do is confess it but I'm taking the responsibility to P off this entire death amen amen hallelujah and by endorsing that not the friend is actually telling his friend and know Jesus is the Friend of Sinners if you not able to pay it when the Lord comes through I pledge myself myself to pay that debt for you we certainly we take the Lord's Supper because it's telling us by taking the Lord's Supper we giving out the sign that the the work of the Lord that the Lord Jesus Christ did it is finished amen it's finished the Battle Is Over amen the stress is over the misery is over the problems that you have it's than whatever WIS the devil was putting upon you seizing this and taking that and going away with this and carrying you away captive back in the old days they would throw you in jail and stuff like that that's over why because he went to Cal his cross on our behalf and said look don't do worry now it's finished I pay the de to you are the de to could but I P it off it's finished amen time finished it's finished time finished it's finished if my life it's finished my life is finished we the Lord serer also because the S question is settled amen my doubts are settled the S question is settled by the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh praise God when the scripture say say here in the word of God Jesus said lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God in Galatians 44 to5 but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons Hallelujah in he said I'm going to come and take the that and in the course of time he came born of a woman made under the law and went to Calvary and there gathered up all the notes of all the saints of the past amen and pay those notes and took responsibility for every believer till the very end of D amen hallelujah not just the past notes but the notes till the end of time glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir so by doing that he settled the question of what man is going to do about Sin and he sett it to God satisfice yes amen because God's requirement was judgment all have sin and have come short of the glory of God and all came under the Judgment of God but by him settling the question oh the battle was over and if he sett it to God's satisfaction until God says sit at my right hand that don't mean an old man sitting on the throne in and a young man come and sit beside him but the right hand of God means coming to a place of power place of authority and control that's why said all power is given unto me both in heaven and in Earth amen praise the Lord for he was God himself there praise the Lord John 19:30 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and he gave gave up the ghost Colossians 2:14 says blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross hallelujah praise God blocking out every note he crossed over every note hey heay heay hey Hallelujah glory to God just took the red streak of his blood and blooded mark it off all the debts are paid your not are settled and are free for whom the son of man set free is free indeed glory to God hallelujah so indeed we are free by the grace of God hallelujah now we know that this sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ it always has a backward look and a forward look because the cross is in the center but what happened these Saints before the cross they believe unto M salvation unto Redemption they believe in the types and shadows of lambs and Bulls and substitute offerings and S sacrifices until the true Lamb of God came that's why you look at the cross and it's like this because it's pointing backwards and it's also pointing forwards and he is in the center of it is that right amen they were believing onto but now we are looking back they were looking forward to his coming we are looking back because he's already B the price is already paid he already died for our sins on the cross there I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rose away it was there by faith I receive my sight and now I'm happy all the day praise the Lord do you know that it was the blood we love that little song We tap our feet and we say I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me amen oh my god when Jesus died upon the cross brother sister I know without that I would be lost amen hallelujah yes sir but he died upon the cross for me amen yes sir Hallelujah so now that he has died every sinner needs to make this make himself make it available uh for himself to come and accept the salvation and the grace of God hallelujah and to admit that your lost and your guilty to be able to accept that sacrifice not to go back into Works in other words you still think you all the Death even though your friend paid it and so now you're going to work your way in or work the Salvation or try to do it by just uh different gen religious gen flections kneeling bowing crawling up a cathedral step on your knees flatulating yourself with a uh with a rope and with with nails and spikes on it on Easter morning so oh I'm going to bleed like Jesus blood I'm going to sacrifice for the death of our Lord he doesn't want you to mourn about that he wants you to Rejoice that he died in your than Rich he that you might have life and he that live believe in me he was dead amen that's what he di for brothers and sisters and we have to Rejoice Hallelujah don't come to church The More Jesus dying we black onter amen that was a tradition in the old days people wor black hats black clothes everything was black black black because we were black and sin and so they were just doing that to commemorate Jesus death and if rain fell on that Easter day it was God the heaven are crying for Jesus all the whole Heaven are crying and the rains in the FL the heaven angels are all crying because Jesus died but let me tell you he died but he rose again and thank you Lord he's risen from the dead amen and he's alive forever more praise God hallelujah amen he he seated that God's right we take the Lord's Supper because it also signifies that he's coming again every time we drink the wine and we eat the bread it symbolizes he's coming again hallelujah amen now uh a certain Minister visited a certain church and when he was there he was invited to speak and when he was there he spoke on the second coming of the Lord hallelujah how many knows brother brand spoke on that second come the Lord he spoke on that under many titles because that was his message Jesus here Jesus come amen praise the Lord he's appearing Among Us right now preparing his coming he's appearing by the opening of the word among us to prepare us for his com amen so here we are brothers and sisters and this Minister after he was finished the pastor took him and said brother I I'm just so sorry that I have to tell you that uh why did you touch on that subject uh about the second coming of the Lord because we here in this church we do not believe in the second coming with the Lord so the preacher was taken back he said oh you don't he says no he said then uh what is that uh table that you have in front of the pit there about what kind of a table is that P of course is the Lord's table so he said and what do you do with it uh what do you do with that table Pastor can't figure out what why the brothers asking that he said well uh we take the Lord's Supper he said well what do you take the Lord's Supper for amen he said because the word of God tells us that we must take the Lord's Supper how many milli are doing that today taking the Lord's Supper taking the soal Holy Eucharist H taking all these various things by tradition and they really have no Revelation no understanding of what it is but we are doing it because the word of God tells us legal you just doing it because you read it in the law you read it in the book so you're just doing it but you have more Revelation so here it is uh and and the brother said well I can't say anything about that the word says it and you're doing it but I want to know how long are you going to keep doing takeing it and the Pastor said well as long as we are here on Earth I suppose so the preacher said what does the Bible say about it preacher said well I don't know what you mean he says let's go get the scripture and read it as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come that is how long we've got to take it because it signifies that he's coming again and if you don't believe that he's coming again you better stop taking it is that right because if we take the Lord supper because we are symbolizing and signifying that we believe he's coming again amen do you believe that yes sir praise God forever more Hallelujah a husband a soldier a s they go out on the sea one goes to Bo wherever they went and before they left they tell their wife uh you know just keep a lamp in a light in the window so that when I'm coming home I can see the light in the window and it will just make me be real anxious and want to hurry to get back home is that right but you put the light in the window what a simple thing put a light in the window or or or the Sailor will say uh you know hang a a ribbon or something you know I'm a rib him by the gate so that I can see it when I'm coming up the road it'll make his footsteps get faster he'll get more anxious about it is that right praise the Lord hallelujah so it's the same way the Lord Jesus is telling us as a husband to a wife do this in remembrance of me so while I'm aware I know I'm on your mind is that right while I'm not in your presence I know you're thinking about me amen is that right and when I start to come back and I look I see that you're doing what I tell you to do by putting a light in the window by putting this certain ribbon right by the front gate and it will make me walk to hurry home and get back to you brothers that's how we bring back the king amen amen amen that's how we bring him back by our faith in the word and by obeying what he says in Simplicity that's why we take the Lord's Supper because we are signifi now we believe him and we believe that he's coming again to take us out of here amen hallelujah oh my so taking the Lord's Supper is a winess yes to all the neighboring churches all the neighbors about my husband is coming home my husband is coming back and I'm rejoicing and I'm anxious praise the Lord amen you know reading somebody old history they said Peter and them Apostles they had a habit uh you know of if there's if they're sitting talking to somebody and a stranger starts coming up the road all of a sudden they get distracted and they're taking a key look at that stranger to see who it is you know why because he appeared he walked with them and the root their M and he appeared to them in the room they didn't know who it was until he said Peace be up to you and they don't want that to happen yet so they're watching for his coming and whatever form he come scrutinizing every stranger that's coming up the road and you know it's the same thing that would happen to a wife that truly loves her husband and watching for his my God every time there's a s from the street she pull is that right every time there look somethings like footsteps it might be the post man but she wants to know if it's him is that right that's the state we ought to be here because this is R time this is going home time amen this is the time when the Lord promise he's coming again and he's coming for you amen I said the boss's son said get ready I'm coming for you amen amen glory to God hallelujah amen why you w from our com do this in remembrance of me amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah this is the little locket it has my picture in it now again open it do this in remembrance of me my picture is right there close to your heart every time you open it you look at it remembrance of me that's why we are here today brother and sister it's not just to eat bread and drink wine but what it's represents by the revelation of the word hallelujah wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy now you got a better understanding what that means that don't mean that the person oh this believer went out and smoke or that person did that or they commit fornication the LI of the the prophet says casting out sin casting out devil unbelief and when he's talking about unworthy is somebody taking it without Revelation without genuine salvation and without Revelation they're taking it not knowing the full significance of it only with a surface understanding and without a clear revelation of why we have taken the Lord's Supper Hallelujah now you know how Saul brother Paul formerly known as Saul what kind of a person he was he was he he he had a sword out for every Christian and he was chopping heads off amen praise the Lord chopping heads off I was in the little prison where they kept him in r a c damp dark little room that that he was in but anyway he was there and we know that God gave him a special Revelation and even though John and the other disciples never broke down the Lord's Supper Paul was never in the room he was not at the Last Supper but yet if you go read First Corinthians 11 he said as was delivered unto me by the Lord himself amen that means the Lord Jesus came to Paul personally appeared to him and told him what happened that the same night that he was betrayed he took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as us as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death until he come again I don't have this in my notes but I'm remembering of a missionary going into India and when he was in India he went to a remote village where um you know he wasn't aware of anybody preaching there when he got there he started preaching about Jesus and an old Hindu gentleman invited him into the home and so he went into the home and the gentleman placed the food on the table and just before he broke the bread he started praying and saying thank you Lord Jesus for this you know uh bread para uh let you provideed and so on like that and then when he got to the drink the tea that they're supposed to drink again he took the tea and he says we thank you for this uh tea that you have provided and made uh uh give strength to our bodies and so like that and every time they would pick up something to eat that's how this gentleman would pray so the missionary said why are you praying like this he said because um many years ago about 20 years somebody uh passed through here and left a book and I got a hold of that book and I've read that book over and over from cover to cover and said what the book he brought the book out and it was just the book of The Gospel of Matthew and it was read so many times until the pages were all torn and some of them even getting unreadable but he had read about how Jesus broke the bread and give thanks and took the cup and give thanks and then says take the and eat the all of it so he the missionary says oh that's wonderful you read that so how long have you been doing this he said for 20 years every meal that he at he was giving thanks for that bread every meal for anything that you drank and he was doing it for 20 years Jesus said do this as often as you drink this cup and eat this bread I'm not telling you to take it every time like that but just to show you that there are people so committed that they will do that by the grace of God of course the missionary explained to him that he doesn't have to do it every time but do it as often as the Lord places on your heart so that you will keep him on your mind and in your heart at all times parents the thought for today I trust that it will be a blessing to your soul and the Simplicity of it will Anor you and strengthen you in this hour as we turn our attention now I'm going to ask the musicians to come up towards uh taking of the Lord's supper and we will have the washing of the Saints feet praise the Lord and um we we want to do all of this so that we can be out of here uh and those of you act on the invitation and we have the time to do that meanwhile let's focus on having the Lord's Supper praise the Lord amen s
