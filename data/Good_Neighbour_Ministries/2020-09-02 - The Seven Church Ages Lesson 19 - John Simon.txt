========================================
[Music] praise the lord it's wednesday night again it's bible study time we are thankful to god for this marvelous and wonderful opportunity to be standing here in his name and to represent him our study continues in this our bible study on the seven church ages now uh we are we have now arrived at the point of studying the ephesian church age now to understand the ephesian church age we will study tonight this city of ephesus the city of ephesus and that is found in revelation chapter 2. let us read out of god's beloved and blessed word revelation chapter 2 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things said he that hold that this seven stars in his right hand [Music] who walk it in the midst of this golden seven golden candlesticks amen our gracious heavenly father as we approach you by the way and means of prayer through the blessed precious blood of the lord jesus christ who has given us a more excellent way to approach thee may your blessing rest upon this the word of god for the day take glory and honor in the name of jesus christ amen as we begin our study tonight on this topic of the ephesian church age we will begin by touching on this city the great city of ephesus now we realize that this is not a word for word commentary on the seven church ages but we will certainly take our liberty to be able to declare the word of god as we see it using the background and the setting and backdrop of the wisdom and knowledge given by god through his divine prophet you may put it this way i am saying what he says for god's glory and honor now we know that this great city of ephesus is one of the three great cities [Music] mentioned in the new testament in the area of asia one of the three great cities of asia it was often called the third city of the christian faith jerusalem of course is always mentioned as the first city of the christian base after which comes this great city of ephesus followed by antioch the city of antioch it was known in its day and time of being a very rich city rich in every respect culturally financially uh people-wise diversity of nations uh that sort of thing ephesus was indeed a very rich city the government of that city was roman the language of the city was greek very important for the romans gave us the roads and laws and of course the the greeks gave us the language the laws and the roads to be able to take or transport the gospel was given by the romans and the greeks with their language facilitate the dispersal of it also now we real historians do believe that john mary peter andrew and philip were all buried in this great city this beautiful city of ephesus now we to looking at the city of ephesus we must be able to extract our understanding because this city is a precursor of the age that is to come it gives us a picture an analogy when we look at the city and what the city was what occurred in the city what actually was displayed in the city it helps us to understand the age and what the age will be like what would be displayed in the age what we have to look for in this age that is here to come now first of all look at the city of ephesus its reputation look upon the city and look at its religion then look upon the city of ephesus and see its culture that controlled the minds and thoughts of the people in that day look upon its quality and customs that also dominated that hour and that time that they were living in the language we mentioned which was greek it was commonly greek of course people spoke their different individual languages but the main language for business for any form of public public understanding was the language of greek when we look at the city of ephesus we must also take into mind at the legacy that that city left for that legacy that the city left was a legacy that would influence future ages that were to come now paul was the one who founded the true faith in this great city of ephesus and he loved that city and even when he was away from that city and his mind turned to the great city of ephesus how that he continually prayed for them that the hand of god will be with them and upon them of course paul pastored the church in ephesus for about a period of about three years now we understand paul being uh pastoring it means that paul came to ephesus as a missionary and as a real missionary he spent three years pastoring founding and pastoring this church that he had founded in the city of ephesus now while pastoring while being a missionary while ministering the word of god he was watchful mindful and waiting for god to reveal to him who would be the local pastor or bishop for you know the word pastor bishop is the same thing it's not as the modern interpretation of a bishop being someone above pastors but that a pastor is a bishop a bishop is a local pastor and so here he was ministering god's word to the people of ephesus and while paul was doing this spiritually he had his eye of discernment and his eye of faith waiting on god to reveal to him who would be the pastor after that he leaves ephesus to go on with his great missionary journey we understand from the bible from the scriptures that timothy who had the great faith of his grandmother and mother placed in his heart from the time that he was a child where he spent his time thinking and talking about the lord in first timothy chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 we read paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and the lord jesus christ which is our hope unto timothy my own son in faith you see timothy became converted by paul's ministry so he calls timothy his son in the faith grace and mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus then i went into macedonia that thou might discharge some that they teach no other doctrine of course i will not touch on that but already paul was seeing the very appearance of those religious spirits trying to invade the faith and teach some other doctrine some other teachings those spirits were already there and he was already advising timothy to be aware of these demonic powers the seductive and enticing spirit that would invade the faith and that he timothy as the local bishop was to stand with the original word as was delivered by him paul no wonder he later said though an angel were to come down from heaven and say or try to say anything different from what i have said then you commit him to be a curse by the spirit of almighty god now the very name ephesus has a compound meaning to it meaning spiritual naturally and also as a spiritual meaning to it the name speaks of one aim that or what one is aspiring to or aiming to accomplish see the name ephesus means aim that aspired to reaching out to it also means relaxed showing a different from your aspiration to getting a relaxed laid-back attitude and slowly beginning to drift away from your original aspiration and aim now it began with the fullness of the spirit it began with the depths of god with the great anointing and leadership of the spirit of god and they were aiming at this high calling of the saints that was in god and that began to slowly slip away from them and to give way to a less watchful attitude in the presence of god of course a less ardent attitude towards the word of god began to be manifested among the saints of god of course that was a sign and oh man towards the future ages of what they would be how that the church which we know is the physical vehicle by which god makes himself manifested and showing how the true church the physical manifestation of the spirit of god would slowly begin to drift away from the things of god from the depths of god right into the depths of satan or satanism drifting away completely becoming relaxed becoming one that is drifting away from the original foundations already we see the spirit and attitude action of apostasy backsliding taking place in this the very first original church age the bible tells us you that it had left its first love its first love already was waning becoming still warm but becoming colder and colder as it drifted away from the original faith of god now that was a tiny seed planted by satan in that original first age which would later on grow into a spirit of error in the middle of the kingdom of god until the every fallen evil bird or spirit of that age would roost rest within the branches of that church isn't that just like the day in which we are living in where the church of god which should be a a seed of faith a a tree of faith a tree of faith and trust in god's word and his supernatural presence instead it becomes a tree that is a roost uh a refuge a hiding place for every foul unclean spirit every foul and unclean bird finds itself within those branches though they are found within those branches coming in as religious spirits they will make themselves appear to be inoffensive they seem so innocent so good that this plant would now become the new eve that is deceived by satan subtility by his wisdom in that day in which they were living in and would again be deceived by satan that ephesian church age represented to the church god's great opportunity for them to be able to aspire to reach out and to grasp the original faith it was theirs to be had but she prevailed only but for a while and after prevailing for a while then she began to relax and in that relaxed in that less vigilant that unguarded moment satan quickly planted within the framework of the church his seeds of ruin and complete destruction later on now in this city of ephesus the ruling religion or ruling faith except the tenor uh for the ages that were to come within this great beautiful city of ephesus was the great and beautiful noticeable placed on a high place the beautiful temple of the goddess diana and there were so many years in building it and how's within these sacred courts there was a lusterless and unobstrusive a picture of this great image or idol of diana the great at that time this image of course this great idol that was within these courts was unimaginable something that one could not imagine you would think of something magnificent but it was not at the time for it was simply the shapeless female figure that finally found itself as a block of wood from which this figure was guard two arms came out of this block of wood and those those two arms were made of iron and this of course uh perfectly portrays uh it figures out what would happen in the future ages how that the spirit of antichrist would be loosed in this first age of ephesus that is a pre-figure of revelation chapter 6 the opening of the first seal the white horse writer at this matter of fact shall be read out of the book of revelation chapter 6 as the bible reads to us verses 1 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the four be saying come and see and i saw and behold the white horse and he that sat on him had a ball and that crown was given unto him and he went for conquering and to conquer revelation chapter 6 verses 1 and two so under the first seal we see this spirit of antichrist being loosed or coming forth so suddenly as we see the white horse rider white being the uh a symbol of righteousness of religion and the faith showing that this horse rider this evil one would come under the guise or disguise of faith as if he was a believer and writing on religion he would come him acting as if he has the word of god he has a bow but no arrows he's going forth to conquer but not out there he is really going to conquer the people of god the kingdom of god yes sir here he was the conqueror by this seat that was his purpose to conquer by the seat on that white horse of religion there is the deceit that comes from appearing so innocent and appearing to be so harmonious along with the original fate that was there he would make himself appear to be harmonious with it and create this atmosphere of an innocent religious appearance as i've said this was a wooden idol with two arms that were made of iron this idol of wood the arms were made of iron so it appeared innocent but once it got a hold of the individuals it would hold them with arms that were bands of iron and control them and crushed them and hold them to itself see back then while appearing as wood no one would notice its ability its power to crush and to destroy and that way he will be able satan will be able to make inroads in the kingdom of god of what he wanted to do but one day they would come to notice that his deeds his deeds that were unacknowledged unnoticed would become doctrines his deeds would become doctrines and then manipulation of the government figures will turn his doctrines into deeds into actions he could take action by and through his doctrine and from that he will then go a little further and turn his deeds into laws where the uh civil or federal government will then be able to end act his deeds his doctrines as law then be able to command and control even those who claim they do not believe to force them to believe with his bands of iron he will be able to crush them if they do not claim what it is that he was and his teaching at this time now the order the temple worship was very revealing there were first of all priests who were eunuchs the priests were not allowed to marry visibly they were not allowed to marry there's priesthood was sterile and this terrible priesthood my friends it was a pre-figure of how god's people would become so sterile the word of god would be so taken away from them until they will become so sterile that they would drift away from the word of god but still yet believing that they had it but they would actually have drifted away from the original i believe that's happening right now while we speak that we who have received the message of the hour from the prophet of malachi 4 5 god's people are drifting away from that original message my friends drifting away into what they think or claim to be the word of god but really it's far from the original truth from which they receive and now entering into that period where they're drifting from that message from the word of god given by god's sermon and prophet into a life of spiritual barrenness baron yes because we are drifted from the world we are not feeding on the original word of god and they become what sterile messengers sterile a sterile priesthood that does not have the original faith anymore in it it has nothing to pass on it has no life to give none whatsoever for it has become sterile drifting from the original truth of the faith or revelation of the word of god secondly we find out that that temple had within its confines virgin priestesses who claim that they were one with diana and that there were virgins yes this showed the day would come when farm ceremony ritual and works would then take the place of the great holy spirit over the church of the living god there will be no more charismatic manifestation no holy spirit growth and manifestation or action or demonstrations amongst the people because the holy spirit himself will be pushed out of the church the very original people that accepting god's patriarchs prophets and of late receive god's prophet's messenger of this hour has come to the point where they have believed that they are no more pentecostal in origin but that they are different from being pentecostal in origin which and i'm speaking of your old original pentecost acts 2 4 right on right from there not this modern day nonsense that we see being carried out but my friends we've got to come back to the original faith back to the original word the original pattern the original blueprint what paul had and be able to say like god's servant i preach what paul preached i preached under the same inspiration i preach under the same anointing in the same atmosphere where the people are free to praise and glorify the name of god and to prophesy and to speak in towns if necessary to be in the spirit to act as if they are in the spirit we are in the spirit of almighty god not in the spirit of diana or the denominations of this day and of this time now thirdly in this temple of diana remember the central figure being a woman diana over them they had certainly a high priest there was this high priest a man of high position a man of political power and a man of public influence pro-training and showing manifesting already what was already in progress satan had put his plans already in progress and his his evil was manifesting itself within the very house of god this of course was showing that one day the church of god which was supposed to be led by the spirit of god would be wholly given over towards the leadership teachings doctrines darkness deeds of man rather than the inspiration or revelation of the holy spirit which they would place it as if it's out of order it's not within the registered system it's not acceptable anymore for he would use his laws his doctrines and deeds he would make into laws using those laws to outlaw deregister delegitimize the genuine true faith of the word of god and find her friends the leadership of man man's plans would become preeminent man's ambitions would become preeminent so controlling that it would be counted greater than thus saith the holy spirit of god and thus saith the lord or thus saint the holy spirit would no longer be a reality in the minds hearts and hearing of the people where their hearing will be taken away from them for hearing they will hear nothing seeing they would see not they will not recognize the word of god for their day and for their time underneath fourthly underneath all of this within the temple there were also temple slaves as i'm beginning to try to wind this up there were also masses of temple slaves within the the temple of diana and these type of slaves had no other uh cure but to obey they had no other choice than to obey that which was given down to them by this man of high position through the sterile priesthood and so-called virgin priestesses they had to obey because they were controlled and ruled over by a religious hierarchy rather than by the holy spirit of almighty god what does this mean what does it mean it means that the day was looking for that the day would come when a vested chirp clergy by political maneuvering by state help by the substitution of the word of god by the substitution of the spirit of god for the creeds and dogmas of man human leadership would create an environment of religious enslavement over the laity while the religious leaders luxurated or lived lives of unimaginable luxury made or gained by ill-gotten wealth and enjoying their filthy pleasures the filthiness of sin and the wages of sin and instead of them living a life of humility like jesus like the apostles live they live lives of extreme luxury still claiming to be man of god still claiming to be holy still claiming to be carrying the word still claiming to serve god and being the voice of god my friends contrary to the will and word of god for originally the true church was meant to serve the poor and serve the people amen and up from their way they've twisted it around where the poor and the people are now serving them when the reality should be that they should be the servants of the poor and of the people instead may god bless these thoughts to your hearts may god quicken them to your mind may god implant them within your soul may they grow up in the trees of righteousness blessed is the man planted by the rivers of waters that he might grow up and be a great tree a tree of the righteousness of the living god so may the seeds of this word this message that we have taught here tonight under inspiration of the holy spirit take root within your heart and grow up for his glory and for his honor and praise in the name of our lord jesus christ god bless you my friends until we meet each other again next wednesday night when we touch upon the topic in this ephesian church age of jesus his messengers and his message may he praise and bless his own as we gather once again amen may god bless you [Music] you
