TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends a joy to be back with you in the presence of the lord certainly he is lord as the song says he is lord he is lord he has risen from the dead and he is lord every knee shall bow and every town confess that jesus christ is lord he's my lord he's my lord he has risen from the dead and he is my lord every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord yes my brothers and sisters i want to proclaim him today and every day of my life that jesus christ is lord let us read our scripture today let us pray and then we will go into the word of god speaking today or teaching today on jesus the living word out of revelation chapter 2 verse 12 it reads and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things said he which had the sharp sword with two edges praise god let us pray father we ask your blessing upon the bread of life that as we break this bread you said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god may the living word proceed out of the written and spoken word and make himself manifested by the revelation opening of the word opening of the heart the mind and may thy spirit lord god rest eternally within our being take all the glory honor and praise we are just here to represent you for your namesake in jesus name amen the lord bless you my dear brothers and sisters bear in mind that our scripture which we just read says and to the angel of the church in pergamus now this is not an angel in heaven but this is to the angel in the church not an angel uh in the heavenly places but an angel on the earth that is moved by the holy spirit to bring god's message or word to the church of his day that these things yet he which had the sharp sword with two edges the one that is speaking is now identifying himself and making it known who he is now we understand that the message to the third church age is about to come forth third unfolding drama of jesus christ in the midst of his church is about to be revealed and now we hear the sound of the trumpet-like voice of god the spirit presenting the matchless one in his glorious divine splendor walking up and down among the candlesticks he which had the sharp sword praise god with two edges hallelujah all the new testament cut you going forward and coming backwards the word of god cuts the very individual that's preaching the word of god it comes back and it searches the heart the mind the very life of the one who is bringing forth the word of god for it is a two-edged sword and here we see friends in the ephesian church age there was a revelation of god and in that church age god he was set forth as the unchanging god unchanging god then here in the smernian church age he presented himself to us as the one true god and beside him there is no other no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ in the protagonist church age which we are now studying we are now receiving a further revelation of this mighty god in christ and so we see he presents himself as the one with the sharp to edged sword which is the word of god this great unfolding revelation now god never does something without a reason and there is a reason and a purpose why he under identifies himself having one name but yet he identifies himself with different titles and different representations of himself unfolding through the ages and now we see here he says he is the word of god now why is a fresh revelation given because just as much as satan is changing his strategy he is changing his attacks changes the way that he approaches the the church and the believers within the church [Music] now revelation chapter 6 when the first four seals were opened a voice cried out in the temple of god come and see and when john looked john saw first a white horse then he saw a red horse then he saw a black horse and then he saw a pale horse under the first four seals now there's a reason why god made that known to us and we will study that later on but that was the spirit of the antichrist riding on the white horse of religion under the disguise of religion he is riding on the white horse deceiving and seducing the minds and hearts of those whose names were not written on the land's book of life before the foundation of the world this is his spirit of deception and death and he is deceiving through the angel ages for she came as a as a white horse hiding under behind religion which he still is doing then he changed himself to a red horse after people began to recognize what he was doing through the evil of the uh wicked uh church at that time working through it he changed to another horse and there he began to use the white red horse and after that was discovered or exposed that he had changed his way of approach under the red horse of war and blood and inquisitions and that then he changed to a black horse that was going forth with plagues and death and and hunger and thirsting and starvation and killing out multitudes of people just to get to the believers but many others in europe and many other countries were being killed and it seemed like if it was just a worldwide plague that was aimed at the entire human race but in actual fact his aim was to get to god's little flock god's elect people his few that was mixed into the whole human bundle oh he was finally light shined upon that and he was exposed and he changed jumped off that horse and jumped on another horse and began to ride the horse but that was a pale horse well pale horse he had a mixture of the first three horses a mixture of those colors mixed together made up the pale horse which means he had all the same qualities propensities for evil for lying for deceiving for death and suffering it was all in him still but coming up under a different color so when he does his changes thank god we serve a god who never leaves himself without a witness no matter how dark the day dismal the times perilous the hour god always has a witness and so god never left himself without a witness but god as the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will rise up a standard against him amen and to god's standard god's highest standard is to raise up the standard of his word you know what a standard is it just means a level but also going to war they'll carry the flag and the flag tells clearly whose side you're on so god's in this age god is emphasizing that the word of god is his standard and jesus christ is a living word of god which is the standard revelation of who god is in christ is the standard hallelujah it divides between truth and era it lets you know right and wrong you recognize clearly in that day when the people were faced with all manner of evil on all manner of different beliefs they needed an anchor something that will hold them firmly we know god said uh his word does not change his word does not lie his word does not pass away for heaven and earth may pass away but my word stands forever excuse me but god uses his word as his standard in that age now we understand in the god's word and we understand why he is associating pointing to and representing himself in the word for that is his name the word of god first john 1 1. in the beginning was the word hallelujah now we understand that of course genesis 1 says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth in the beginning the earth the world was without form and void and god said see the word hallelujah so in the beginning was the word now they root the root of the word of that word that we are saying now word the root of it is logos l-o-g-o-s which really means the thought or the concept in the beginning was the logos before the written word before the spoken word before any other thing in the beginning what they thought or the concept the idea that was in the mind of god that came first then the other levels of the unfolding of the word of god came afterwards amen now we know that that logos has a double meaning of both thought and speech first the logos or the word when it is in the thoughts but then when it it uh and morphed itself to speech it is still the word in spoken form and then when that word is believed and received in the heart of a person a believer then that word becomes the living word living in the hearts living in the bodies living in the minds of god's people a people that were elected by god before the foundations of the world to be the receptors the vessels the receptacles that will receive him in your age or your time when he will come to find his true seed when the son of man comes shall he find faith upon the earth yes he will but he will come to find those whom he had allocated predestinated to each age for him to be able to have these consecrated dedicated bodies to indwell and use so that he could reveal himself not just as the word as a thought not just the word only spoken but the revealed living word the word of god living again on the earth to fulfill hebrews chapter 14 verse 8 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever today in you and me today in the true believer and forever the eternal one oh blessed be the name of the living god let's get back to it logos the root meaning thought or concept hallelujah so a thought expressed becomes a word that we can hear the thought expressed becomes a word that we can hear see the origin is back there in god's mind it was the thought it was the concept the idea that was in this mind that is the logos the original these are only an unfolding of that logos that is here now we are still making himself known by revealing himself to us and then through us so that he may be glorified by his people who see him and recognize him in the written word you see that is why i keep emphasizing and re-emphasizing over and over again and i will never stop re-emphasizing it and trying to make it clearer and clearer to everyone that will believe the word of god that we are not here to just emphasize the writing or the quotations of the written word that is why we say it's not bible schools it's not colleges not universities they have their place but we don't rely upon the right thing or the written word which we can see or anything like that but we are trying to bring god's people back or restore god's people back to the sought to the idea to what was in the mind of god bring you back to the original though because the word of god is the original sea life of the genuine sons and daughters of the living god amen you see the thought or concept amen was represented by writing the writing only represented the concept and still represents the concept so the writing is true the writing is the word but this is the written word we are not just talking about the written word but the life behind the word the sought the death the eternal realities of the living god that's beyond the veil hallelujah praise his marvelous name amen the original thought idea or meanings behind the writing that is upon the pages thank god that is marvelous and wonderful and beautiful and john tells us that this meaning expression of god was mad clear in christ in jesus christ for jesus is the fullness of the godhead bodily the very substance of god the very essence of god the word was made flesh they sought the concept the idea or meaning of who god is was mad flesh and dwelt among us oh glory be to his marvelous name hallelujah that great spirit god unto which no man could approach before in genesis down through the ages thousands of years ago abraham might have caught the first early revelation that there is a god almighty god one of the first revelations but they could not see him they did not know him and most of the people feared him for when he came down on the mountains with smoke and fire and oh the light of god thunderings lightnings upon the mountains and the voice of god roaring out like a lion and so fear came upon the people when they heard god in the heavens on the mountain in the thunder when it rolls and god in the lightning when the lightning flashes they were afraid of that god amen but now jesus christ that god that was there thundering with lightning was in christ tabernacled in a human body that he might be known believed loved and served by his people that would believe him and love him praise god he dwelt among men to express the fullness of god to men to bring a clear understanding and knowledge to men who god is what god's characteristics are what his personality is like all of that was pictured in jesus christ that we could see that he is a god of love but he's a god of justice also we can see him with a power to raise the dead hallelujah but he is a god that can give life fear not him that can kill the body but fear him that can kill both body and soul first john 1 john chapter 1 the gospel of john 1 verse 18 no man had seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him hallelujah that god has now become emmanuel god with us remember god above us god with us in our day god who used to be with israel walk with them that god has now come to dwell in them so god above us god with us now god in us oh he lives in me i want to say today he lives in me the god of all heaven and earth he lives in me i praise him and thank him that he chose me as a vessel to use in my age my day my time and to live in me you say oh uh brother simon you may have outward faults and flaws you may not be perfectly outside 100 percent but that is the love of god that is the grace of god that he chose him perfect people that he could now perfect himself in and through them by the potter can take the clay and and make it over again he could take my life your life the life of anyone no matter how mixed up tangled up no matter how dirty filthy no matter how man may call it pure but in the eyes of god that's not pure god can take the entire vessel with its aims ambitions all of its fears and complexes and depressions and the pressures that come upon us take us and make us and shape us all over again into what he wants us to be amen not what i want to be but what he wants me to be that my will o lord but thy will be done amen praise god forevermore may the will of god be done within our lives and let us be shaped by the unchanged and transformed by the living word of god hallelujah do you believe this word of god is living this written word represents the thought the original root the very concept the meaning the idea the very essence of god himself and the word of god has come to live in us and move in us that we might become living voices living people living epistles to be read and known of all men not just the bible here being read but you and i have to become living representations of this written word so that men who know not god or think they know about god will see christ in you and will be able to read the bible read the word read the manifestation the rev unfolding revelation of god himself amen amen emmanuel god made flesh and dwelt among us and his dwelling among us and making himself known once again to the world amen praise god hallelujah god with us amen the bible says john 1 18 he jesus christ had declared him now that word declare doesn't mean just someone standing up and unknown saying that's part of it but declared let me use a theological word here the exit jesus the xe jesus e x e g e s i s which means to thoroughly explain and to make something clear hallelujah and that is what the living word jesus christ has done is doing and will do to the very end of the age you see he jesus christ exegesis god to us he made god clear he made god fully explained and revealed to us by the words he spoke by the life he lived oh praise god and the holy spirit continues his work now by coming to the written word and giving the genuine elected believer and exegesis of this word others may read it others may write it others may make books about it videos dvds all kinds of uh things they can do from it but only the elected will be allowed into beyond the veil to a clear understanding of the exegesis clear explanation revelation and declaration of the word of god oh in speaking i am trusting that the great holy spirit for i'm only a man that can speak words and bring forth thoughts but he can declare what it is i'm trying to say to you oh many years it may sound strange others it may sound like fantastics but may the great god of heaven the great living holy spirit not just heal your body but may he heal your wounded broken spirit and give you life again may you be born again may the sea life be germinate again may it come up to life and spring up to bear fruit in the days to come and declare from what seed you came from for every seed shall bring forth after its kind i may call one may say i'm a christian i'm this i'm that but the seed that you are originally against your own will it will bring forth after its kind the lemon can't say oh it's going to expose me to the people that i'm a lemon so i i want to be changed into a cherry so that they will love me oh the left the lemon can't change its origin amen and oh oh my friend let me say this whatever seed was in you before the foundation of the world the you see that's why the evidence is not just the reign of the holy spirit coming on the seed but the holy spirit is just a rain coming but the seed itself the rain brings out what the seed originally is and that's what the holy spirit has come to do is to make you know you're a daughter of god you're a son of god you are children of the living king of hosts the lord of hosts amen the lord of hosts the jehovah wow of the armies of heaven of the family of heaven and earth in whom their name and the name is jesus christ glory be to god on high hallelujah amen he was making jesus the living word was making one or explaining and making clear who god is and now he comes in us and that's what the holy spirit is in us to do is to make god clear not by just talk talking but by him revealing himself in and through you for your life and your talk must line up with your walk let me say that again your life your walk and your talk must line up together to present to the people a clear understanding of who god is god is not a sex exposure god is not a uh some kind of a sex loving man god is not a greedy god is not a liar cheat or any of those things i won't go down my entire list that's where your spirit can follow those things but god is not that he's he's come to show you how to live like him who he is how he walked how he dressed praise god why would a man go around wearing all kinds of pants himself bulging in the front and bulging behind and walking around like that claiming he's pretending representing god why would a woman go out with all manner of sex exposure clothing exposing our breasts exposing her behind exposing every part of her body and presenting herself with with the with sex attraction rather than with the attraction of the word of god and the purity and the holiness and the life that was in christ now living in you why would that man want to go around like that or that woman shorts tight jeans why would a woman when the bible says she shall not put on anything that pertains to a man that is the bible that's not brother simon telling you that that's the word of god saying that to you that is how we should walk like holy women of god like sarah like mary oh like rules oh the children of god man that walk like man not mice or mangoes or or rats or snakes in the grass liars and cheats and seducers and liars of every form but real men will stand with the word of god and live like men take care of their responsibilities wives and children like god takes care of his own protects them provides for them even will go as far as dying for them that's the love of god he wants to see reflected in us as men and as women praise god now satan may put all kinds of veils on us and we look uh the world looks on us and once we we were a drunk once we were we were this once we were that that's what he presented you as to the world but now we are changed we are transformed we are anointed the scales have come off of our eyes and we recognize and we can see clearly now as jimmy cliff says i can see clearly now the rain is gone i can see all obstacles in my way hallelujah all of the dark clouds all praise god hallelujah they're driven away amen wow hallelujah oh my it's a it's a bright bright sunshiny day for the sun is up the word is declared the light is shining upon our hearts glory to god all the foggy presumption days of the presumption are now being cleared away and the gloom is going past and now we can look into tomorrow and see there's a new life there's a rapture at hand there's a power in the presence of the living god i'm going out of here but while i'm here let me live as close as i possibly can to the to the representation jesus christ has given and is giving within the revelation of the word of god hallelujah amen first john 1 1-3 which was from the beginning which we have heard amen praise the lord see which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon our hands have handled their word of life or the living word the word of life for that life was manifested and we have seen it we have seen the manifestation of what was an invisible life that was in god we have seen it because now that invisible life has now made itself manifested in a man now in our day true men and women so that it may be known recognize that you're not just a woman or a man walking on the street but there's something different about you something in you makes you different he lights up your life your life becomes a shining light walking in this dark and dismal day of conflict disease depressions and death oh my that life manifested to be seen that life manifested to bear witness amen the life manifested to show display make clear to the people hallelujah that eternal life that you have in you that eternal life that was in the father and was the father amen now made manifest each one of us that we have seen what we have heard declare unto you that you may have fellowship with us that's real fellowship not by bringing a bunch of people through church organization or denomination but when a bunch of people begin to see on an individual basis the same things within the word of god they are brought together not by man but by god himself into what is a fellowship if you will look in your bible you will see paul himself saying oh i i wish i could make all men see what is the fellowship of this mystery the revelation of this mystery how it draws people together and if there's any elected seed around you or in your area or in your city or nearby or anywhere god will draw them with the cards of love with the magnetizing power of the one who said if i be lifted up i will draw all men unto me o glory to god he is drawing the third pull is on the power of god is on the presence of god is on you see in the smyrna church age where the church was being challenged and confronted by the belief in many gods god to counteract satan's strategy had to present himself as the one god for they were presenting to the people that he's a trinity he is a he's this he's a folly a god you know many gods and he says no i'm not trinity i'm not three i'm not million i'm not a thousand i'm not a fight-headed or five-armed god i'm one god one person one god and so he had to emphasize that in the smyrna church age now in this age of pergamos the people who were being challenged by all kinds of false manifestations tongues is the evidence oh a prophecy of this is the evidence or or or some other sign is the evidence bearing false witness of the word of god you see if you put a sign by the side of the road which has boys many times we would turn the sign that was on the road uh let it point in a different direction it is still a sign but that sign is bearing false witness it's telling a lie of which direction you are supposed to go into and so this is what was happening back there the devil was twisting the word to point in a different direction the very word he was preaching the very word he was so-called bible teaching the very word he was using for his denominational objectives but it was pointing in a completely wrong direction and that is why we say back to the original word of god so god is presenting himself in this age of pergamos as the living word to point the people and bring them back to the original faith of the original life of god to live and walk within the hearts of his people praise god forevermore hallelujah my friends as i'm going to begin to wind this down i want you to know that the word will only come to the spirit filled or the way i would express it the word of god can only and will only come to the predestinated vessels that he prepared from before the foundation of the world as mary was sarah ruth different ones man that he prepared women that were predestinated for his purpose that when he comes to a certain age he has bodies he has vessels satisfied by himself you don't sacrifice yourself but he sanctifies clean you up for his own use and for his own glory thanks be to god not of works of righteousness by which we have done but by his mercy that he saves us and cleans us and so the word of god comes to the predestinated vessel the holy spirit the great eagle will seek he will search until he finds that those vessels but the word will always only come to the predestinated vessels that's why unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of the kingdom of god unto you it is given to recognize the shepherd's call unto you it is given to recognize the cry of the great jehovah eagle speaking to your soul bearing witness as the deep crawls to the deep and the deep response back to the word oh praise god forevermore and that is why he has to pass your way because you and i you are ones that he has to pick up there cannot be any rapture there can not be any catching away of the church until that last one is brought in by his mighty hand by his divine call hallelujah god is now giving his last altar call by the blessed holy spirit speaking into our minds our hearts our lives and transforming us by his glory amen he'll search for you he'll seek for you hallelujah no wonder god is calling today out in the desert seeking seeking o my dear brothers sisters he's seeking for thee hallelujah oh gently revealing divinely calling o my dear loved ones oh come on to me jesus is calling jesus is calling oh praise god oh my dear brother oh beloved ones come to christ if you're already a believer know him deeper in the power of his resurrection into this life this deeper life into which we are called to walk with god oh praise god he's calling you today jesus is calling jesus is calling praise god could it be you who are listening watching here today could it be that you are now recognizing that he's calling you may god creating us a spiritual realization of who he is who we are recognize his voice and answer his call jesus is still the living word and may that living word that proceeded out of this bible out of my life out of my heart and my human frail expressions somewhere in there that the great holy spirit will call you may god bless you my brothers and sisters around the world wherever you are may god truly bless you and take the scales from off your eyes as ananias was told pray for brother paul let him know who he is and when you pray for him the bible tells us in the book of acts the scales fell off of fall's eyes and his eyes were opened to walk with god may your eyes be opened to walk with god to love him and serve him and to fulfill his divine will and become another living word of god in fellowship with him once again our gracious heavenly father we thank thee for the voice of god in these last days and they're going forth of the word of god as he expresses himself and makes himself clear i pray you'll touch hearts change life oh lamb of god may revival fires break out across the world may this word father be the combustion that will cause spiritual forest fires that will burn in the bushes and bring them to life to recognize i am that i am oh god in christ christ in the church the kingdom now being restored we give you the praise honor and glory in the name of the lord jesus christ amen my friends god bless you with humbled hearts with refreshed lives let us walk with him and live for him and while you're doing that please do
