TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends it's wonderful to be together once again as the people of god gathered together around his throne of his word here we are on this wonderful wednesday evening and may the lord jesus christ bless you richly and wonderfully praise god hallelujah our topic is jesus the keeper of the keys i repeat our subject for tonight is jesus the keeper of the keys and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 7. and to the angel of the church in philadelphia right these things said he that is holy he that is true he that had the key of david he that opened it and no man shut it and shut it and no man open it thanks be to god let us pray our gracious loving heavenly father with joy we come into your presence boldly before the throne of grace thank you lord for including us in your great purpose and plan and here we are in this day speaking the word of god back to you as you have taught your little children take glory and take honor for we are dying and thine alone in jesus name amen and amen now for this topic of jesus the keeper of the keys i would like to for you to focus your thoughts upon the the fact of the importance of revelation as found in pages 13 to 17 of the church age book now the importance of revelation to the true believer should never be underestimated or it can never be over emphasized because revelation means to us more than many of us realize and we are not talking about the book of revelation we're talking about all revelation now jesus did say that he would build his church up on revelation some say god built his church on a rock some say he built his church on you know jesus jesus himself but the bible says let me give you the words of the bible itself when peter answered him and said flesh jesus said flesh and blood had not revealed it but my father had revealed it and upon this rock what rock the rock of revelation i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against against it because of revelation oh praise god so the church's true foundation is revelation is thus saith the lord now i want to ask you a question from the book of genesis showing the importance of revelation the flow and continuity of revelation from eternity back to eternity here we find abel in the uh beginning of the world off in hebrews 11 by faith a bell by faith faith is what faith is a revelation so then let us say this way by revelation abell offered a better sacrifice notice carefully by faith by revelation he was shown or told how to offer his sacrifice and what sacrifice it was that he had to offer hallelujah he did it by revelation uh cain offered up a sacrifice also but he did that by commandment not by god opening his his mind his soul to revelation from the word so he could not offer the right sacrifice he was doing it by commandment he was spiritually blind to the real things of god even though he was religious and ready to offer a sacrifice also oh praise god but it was revelation that made the difference between the two young men at that particular time twins then twins now revelation then revelation now just reading the bible theologizing studying analyzing debating doing these various things with the bible it's wonderful that's all by commandment oh praise god one may say oh i'm obeying the word yes that is obedience to the word indeed but not by revelation for by faith by revelation abel offered a better sacrifice now let me give you some insight into what i am uh trying to say if you have the facilities to be able to catch it absorb it and go out and live it remember in the days of a ballon cane there was no not yet any written bible there was no written scriptures so how did a bell no in contrast to his brother how did he know what to offer and i've said this before uh did he stand there wondering if he was to offer a fish or or or a bird or or or some fruits on the altar or something else no he did not have to wander abel was certain of god for he had received a revelation which only will come from god and only could be given by grace amen and god making known to him amen to offer up a lamb and the shed blood would be a type a shadow but he was to offer that meaning revealing to him the entire story of what actually happened before he was even born again born or on the scene amen praise god of course a true son the same thing will take place to him god revealing to him or her what happened from way before the foundation of the world until this time revealing it right through the word so they're not worshiping serving and living for god by guests by by commandment but by faith by revelation out of the mouth of god revealed to his servants praise god amen hallelujah amen amen so revelation is the true foundation of the church and in particular the revelation of who jesus christ really is that he is god he is very god and god manifested in the flesh as we say emmanuel god with us the god who was above us came down from his glory put on a tent of human flesh that he might walk with us talk with us oh that he could be tried tempted and and be touched by the feelings of our infirmities to recognize and know what it is to be a human and to uh have a a taste of these things for this he learned or obedience that he might know amen praise god hallelujah yes sir oh we are here my friends not to just be a christian by taking what the pastor says or even what i say even though it may be a blessing to you to try to bring you to the fullness of revelation amen praise god this is not by eloquence this is not my logic this is none of the religious things that we receive in schools but thank god i tell you my friends god has to reveal it to you by grace amen god has to turn on the light god is the one who has to open the eyes of your heart that you might see the word that it is jesus christ that is his blood his spirit that washes and cleanses you and reveals to you hallelujah that you might recognize that god is your savior that salvation is of the lord amen only spiritual revelation will do that for you for revelation is the key it is the master's key by which we are given supernatural understanding of the scriptures which their world cannot withstand for it's the wisdom of god flowing through men and women of this hour anointed by the holy spirit here we stand and here we believe that once again the holy spirit has returned to man anointing men and women that are given this facile faculty uh and this ability of reception of the gods broadcast of revelation through the voice of this prophet that was set upon the face of the earth by which we can enter in to another dimension through revelation of the holy spirit this master key is given that we might open up god's treasure house of his word of all the precious things hidden things the secret things of god are made known hallelujah and i want you to know that jesus christ himself is the keeper of the keys to god's treasure house of revelation as the old song says no only to him are the great hidden secrets known only to him are the great hidden secrets oh praise be to god hallelujah and that is why satan hates these two books of genesis and of revelation because it shows his beginning and his end that he is not god but a creation of god and as a creation he has a beginning and will have an end my friends i thank god that as we study this church age of philadelphia we can accept the reality of jesus christ that is why in our last talk we spoke about perfect realization showing that all the type shadows coming to their fulfillment magnification and reality in jesus christ jesus christ lived displayed and manifested to us these marvelous wonderful hidden truths and secrets of the word of god even my friends as we look we find this beautiful phrase he that hat the key of david hallelujah and it comes out or flows from the preceding phrase he that is true jesus christ the per the perfect realization contrasted with partial realization or recognition hallelujah partial and a partially f epiphany uh in contrast to uh you know a partial uh a complete epiphany a perfect epiphany in contrast to a partial epiphany ah a moment when you come to yourself a moment when you wake up a moment when you are struck by the light of god or lightning of god and you recognize what god has been trying to say to you all through the years jesus is the perfect fulfillment of all prophecy jesus christ is the perfect fulfillment or the reality of all the types all of the shadows and the perfection of all realities thanks be to god now moses was a prophet of god but when jesus christ came on the scene he was god come to be his own prophet and to speak his own word and say moses said but i say unto thee for it was the great i am speaking true a veil of flesh named jesus christ and saying i am that i am hallelujah praise god it's clear in the word of god oh that my friends david being king of israel but jesus is the greater king of israel david was just foreshadowing christ hallelujah amen david was casting a shadow on the wall of time so for folks everyone to know that a real king the real king is coming and i'm only a partial reflection of the coming of that king and we know him to be jesus christ king of kings and lord of lords hallelujah amen praise god listen what the scripture says in isaiah chapter 22 verse 22 and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open praise god the spirit of god is using this old testament scripture and prophecy and referring and pointing directly to jesus christ himself who stands in the midst of his of the lamp stands type of the church ages and showing that rep the this this revelation he is the keeper of the keys and he will reveal or open the heart eyes of the heart of those who he will and shut the eyes of those to whom he also will amen praise god now we know jesus standing in the midst of the lampstand this has to do with jesus christ after his resurrection i spoke on this last sunday talking about knowing jesus in the flesh before the resurrection that's just knowing the written word that's just knowing the bible but when that word was crucified buried and rose again and then met him then explained he to them the scriptures from moses right on down to himself and the bible records then were their eyes opened that they might no really know who he was may the lord help us may the lord bless every one of us may that god open the eyes of our understanding to recognize that he is the keeper of the keys there is no bible teacher there is no human element not by the will of man the word of man only by the grace will purpose and election of the living god can the eyes of the heart be really opened all thanks be to god yes he is the one who opens the door of revelation he opens the door of opportunity to salvation as he did with noah in the ark yes he holds the keys of death hell and the grave he is the eternal warden of the great temple of god where god he holds the responsibility of opening and shutting praise god he shuts up my friends and he opens up he shuts the door of time and opens the door of eternity to those who he wants to enter when it is their time for them to enter hallelujah not to know him while he was in his earthly pilgrimage of his flesh but to know him in his glorified resurrected body of truth made manifest in this hour by the spirit of the living god hallelujah oh glory to his marvelous and wonderful name now what does the key signify this key as you see in the scripture it's the position of the key that speaks to us and gives us insights into the word of god for this this key it is not found in his hand it is not worn around his neck neither does he give the keys to anyone else is not placed in the hands of any man or praise god hallelujah amen he was giving peter revelation at that time but my friends it was not a natural ordinary key that can be handed down or passed down for up the gifts and things of god are not by spiritual inheritance or succession but by revelation through the holy spirit amen so he never placed the it in the hands of other men he alone uses that key for he alone opens and he alone shuts and the bible makes it clear for no man can open or shut but he alone and no man has the right to say he can open and shut for only jesus christ alone can do that now where is this key the bible tells us it is on his shoulder what does his shoulder speak of rev isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder now what does that mean the answer speaks to us out of the jewish tradition and practice of their the wedding ceremony of the east now when a bride has committed herself to a groom then she takes off the veil that she had upon her face and places the veil on the groom's shoulder and that is significance but she is signifying by that that she willingly accepts him as her head her master her leader her guide her provider her all in all and she now surrender herself to his dominion she has transferred her rights to him and that he now bears responsibility protection and care for her and she looks to him and him alone no other man no one else no other power in in the heavens or in the earth has any right or any responsibility of making any such claims for she has committed herself to jesus christ and jesus christ alone yes beloved only he holds the key of david for god being sovereign already foreign who would be his bride and in his bride hallelujah and he chose her as he said in the book of john you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you hallelujah before the foundation of the world not you choosing christ now in your time frame of this day on a certain day time year or date but him he chose us before the foundation of the world now you say but god has us under uh you know wonderful uh ability of choice here we are in this age and we are able to choose well that is to say accept because her acceptance of her bread room that points to her choice but not her looking at him and choosing him no he first chose us and then we accept him as our lord and savior he is the one that chose us we didn't choose him he called the bride he called us we didn't call him hallelujah thank god we didn't even come on our own but led by the spirit were brought to jesus christ thank god he washed us in his own blood amen he is the one that redeemed us paid the price for our salvation brought us back out of the devil's old pawn shop and we belong to him and to him alone is our heart committed and that is why we are committed to him and thank god he accepts the obligation and responsibility and of protection provision guidance every supernatural thing in our lives he accepts the obligation and the responsibility for the government is upon his shoulders thanks be to god for he is the head of his church do you hear what i said jesus christ is our headship our lord spiritually our husband or all in all hallelujah and he speaks we obey and walk in obedience to his word and that is our joy and our delight is to obey the word of the lord hallelujah yes full sovereign authority over his own amen my friends he does not have sovereignty in the modern nominal church no he does not for in every age the church so-called the has allowed itself not to be ruled by the headship and preeminence of the word of god the revealed word of god instead the church has allowed itself to be ruled by hierarchies by priesthoods by various forms of church boards and has allowed herself to be ruled by claims of apostolic succession which are totally on scriptural and not within the boundaries of the word of god these close the door of mercy and grace upon multitudes and keep them from the very hand and will of god instead of assuming love and responsibility of the church of the living god we find these church spirits these spirits of religious devils on the various hierarchies church boards uh priesthoods apostolic successions have become so mercenary and have prayed upon and are praying upon that church of the living god and destroying her in every possible way most and many of the clergy live in luxury while the poor church feeds on the husks of their continuous abuse over and over again you hear you read or you may have experienced the abuse and abuses within the so-called church and not one age has been any different listen to me i'm speaking to you the word of god for this day and for this hour may the holy spirit break through my friends the crusts of unbelief and churchianity so that you might recognize jesus christ making himself known in the present stage of his ministry by the opening of your understanding to the word of god hallelujah amen oh praise god every one of these ages before us and even the present age they bound themselves to an organization or to that organizational spirit yes and committed the church to the government of men and the government of that organization and if any of the people were to see some glimmer of light and to try to raise up and break away from the cage the prisons with stained glass windows to break away from it then they're brutally suppressed or excommunicated cast out oh god have mercy and every single denomination upon the face of the earth has that same kind of spirit upon it every denomination swears that it has the real genuine key to church government everyone claims that they have the key of opening the door but that is not true not at all for it is jesus oh it is jesus it is jesus in my soul oh praise god my friends jesus and jesus alone opens up the eyes of our understanding the eyes of the heart and makes himself known he is the one that sets every member into his body and positions them for his glory he endows an ordains with their various ministries he puts the gifts into the church of the living god oh thank god he cares for his church his bride he leads and guides her and she is his sole property through the price of redemption not by with silver and gold but by the precious blood of jesus christ who was wounded for our transgressions blows for our iniquities amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we are healed oh thank god he has no other wife no other one but her and her alone thanks be to god amen what a what a far cry from this church age and every other church age hallelujah men now even purport to speak for the church my friends out of that kind of religious lie will arise the economical council and the ecumenical move they're trying to create a ground swell a wave towards an ecumenical move so that they may place a living antichrist at the head of their organization and dispose of the word the lord himself while making lots of religious phraseology and using bits and pieces out of the scriptures they shift the attention away from the lord himself excuse me and begin to place it first on the mother and soon it shifts again and he'll keep moving until the washer will go towards the antichrist himself who will sit on the throne of god claiming that he is of god meanwhile the real christ is put outside of the door as is found in revelation chapter 3 verse 20. behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door individually you must hear individually not if any church if any man any individual hear my voice i will open the door hallelujah i i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me praise god hallelujah let me say my friends our lord jesus christ is not defeated men claim to open the door to god and the things of god and shut the door but they are liars complete liars amen because all that the father has given him by election will come to him they may not even understand why they are drawn by the presence and power of almighty god but in them were the seeds of revelation of the spoken work planted amen hallelujah amen the last elected member of the body of christ will come in and when they do come in the lord himself shall appear a rapture will be on the scene or praise his marvelous name hallelujah the key of david amen the wonderful marvelous key and thank god jesus christ is the keeper of the keys he is the master of the keys hallelujah amen it is jesus who will bring in the millennium for he has the keys of death and hell and will raise up his own hallelujah rapture his own raise up his own that they may share his glory in the millennium praise god amen for he alone has all the answers christ is the answer to all our longings christ is the answer to all our fears all our doubts all our desires every question in our mind he is the answer oh thank god amen yes sir he is the one this great millennium is coming this dispensation of divine government by the lord himself thanks me to god and i'm glad that we are on track by being on the king's highway to walk right into a rapture and then into a menelium for the millennium is nothing but the thousand-year honeymoon between christ and his bride thank god here he stands the lord of glory jesus christ once in the eternity he was surrounded by myriads of angels as the father surrounded by angels i can see him surrounded by archangels surrounded by cherubims surrounded by seraphims and the whole hosts of heaven crying out with a loud voice holy holy holy is the lord god of hosts oh yes such was the holiness of god amen and now we see him that he has given that holiness to his beloved bride to share in that holiness through him we have become the righteousness of god in him thanks be to god hallelujah thank god here he stands before us jesus perfect reality perfect everything lily of the valley the bright and the morning star the fairest of ten thousand to our souls the alpha the omega the beginning and the end the first and the last root and offspring of david glory to god father son and holy ghost one true god and his name is jesus christ the jehovah of the old testament now jesus christ god in flesh appearing before us for his glory all in all amen isaiah 9 6 for unto us a child is born and unto us our son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god hallelujah the everlasting father there's only one mighty god there's only one everlasting eternal father lord of god hallelujah their prince of peace thank god in him is perfection of perfection and he is the perfect fulfillment of every scripture every promise every prophecy that has ever been given we esteemed him not but now we love him with joy unspeakable and full of glory here he understands in the midst of the church and we are here to sing his praise to worship him to speak about him that he might step out of the bushes of time and speak the truth of the word to our heart and open our eyes to him he the mighty conqueror head over his church head over his bride oh for with his own blood he bought her and for her life he died she is his and his alone he cares for her he is our king thank god for king jesus amen he is our king and his king and we are his kingdom we are eternal we are his eternal possession praise god hallelujah amen amen jesus set himself forth as he that is true lord of god or he that is the reality of all things the unfailing reality of the living god made manifest the one with the key of david the keeper of the keys the one who opens and no man shuts and when he opens your understanding none can shut it and when he makes you spiritually blind or shuts your understanding no man by theology or by the toothpicks of seminary education can open it only by the grace of god can the eyes of the heart be opened oh hallelujah amen the jews of his day refuse him and all that he was they rejected their own messiah their savior on all that he meant to them and now in our day in the gentile dispensation that is exactly what the nominal church has done to him and the nominal believer has done to him and just as the jews crucified him through their spiritual blindness and then turned on the disciples and apostles at that time that they had to flee so is it happening in our time the nominal church again having a second crucifixion of jesus christ the word crucifying him again from off of their pulpits from off of their high places of worship their high altars blaspheming his name crucifying the word calling him wrong calling this false oh my giving him a name of a quote blackening his name and everything else oh my crucifying him afresh and then turning on the true church of the living god which is in the minority but god is true and god is real and he's above all and he has promised that he would yet return oh my friends and when he does let me say that he is the only true potentate the only great sovereign of our heart and he proves himself and will prove himself to the entire world and make all the world bow at his feet that he is king of kings and lord of lords above all and in you all that truly believe and at that that time the world will come and bow at the feet of his saints proving that they were right in their stand in the position that they took within his body oh my with him blessed be our god forevermore amen for the far for the bride to the bride their rapture is their ultimate vindication of their rightness of the rightness of their belief of their revelation of their faith and their love submission on obedience to the word of god that has been given to them in this day and in this hour by the voice of god for our day and time and we thank the lord jesus that he has done this for us to him be all praise honor and glory and john said i heard a voice like sundering waters in the heavens saying honor glory and power be unto our god the 24 elders cast down their crowns and said amen amen and together they worshipped the lord god in the temple of heaven they were allowed to worship him for jesus christ himself is the keeper of the keys and thank god the keys have turned in the lock and the lock has opened up in the doorways of the dimensions of the glory and presence of god in this day in this hour has opened up the bible has opened up and become a new bible to me as to many others hallelujah oh praise god and the scintillating truths oh are the star bursts out of the word of god is my delight may he become your delight also this great lord of glory for ever and forever amen god bless you god bless us all as we continue to worship and to serve him once again we'll gather together as sons and daughters of
